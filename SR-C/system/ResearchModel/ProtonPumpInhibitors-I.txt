TI  - The effects of lansoprazole on erosive reflux oesophagitis are influenced by
      CYP2C19 polymorphism.
PG  - 965-73
AB  - BACKGROUND: The acid suppressive effect of lansoprazole is influenced by the P450
      2C19 (CYP2C19) polymorphism. AIM: To investigate whether the CYP2C19 genotype is 
      related to the healing of erosive reflux oesophagitis during treatment with
      lansoprazole. METHODS: Eighty-eight Japanese patients with erosive reflux
      oesophagitis were treated with a daily oral dose of 30 mg lansoprazole for 8
      weeks. The CYP2C19 genotype, Helicobacter pylori infection status and serum
      pepsinogen I/II ratio were assessed before treatment. At 4 and 8 weeks, the
      healing of erosive reflux oesophagitis was evaluated endoscopically. RESULTS: The
      healing rates were 57.1%, 69.2% and 72.7% at 4 weeks and 77.4%, 95.0% and 100% at
      8 weeks in homozygous extensive metabolizers, heterozygous extensive metabolizers
      and poor metabolizers, respectively. At 8 weeks, the healing rate of erosive
      reflux oesophagitis was significantly lower in homozygous extensive metabolizers 
      than in the other two groups (P < 0.05). The H. pylori status and serum
      pepsinogen I/II ratio had less influence than CYP2C19 polymorphism on the healing
      rate of erosive reflux oesophagitis. CONCLUSIONS: The therapeutic effect of
      lansoprazole on erosive reflux oesophagitis is influenced by the CYP2C19 genotype
      status. Therefore, a test of CYP2C19 genotype may be useful for the medical
      treatment of reflux oesophagitis with lansoprazole.

TI  - A randomized, double-blind, comparative study of standard-dose rabeprazole and
      high-dose omeprazole in gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 479-85
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rabeprazole has a faster onset of antisecretory action than
      omeprazole, and it is of interest to determine whether this translates into
      faster symptom relief in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. AIMS:
      To assess the relief from heartburn after 3 days of treatment with standard-dose 
      rabeprazole or high-dose omeprazole (primary end-point). Secondary end-points
      included the decrease in score for other symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux
      disease, healing rates and quantification of antacid use. METHODS: Patients with 
      endoscopically confirmed erosive oesophagitis were randomized to receive 4 weeks 
      of double-blind treatment with rabeprazole (20 mg) or omeprazole (40 mg).
      Patients who were not healed after 4 weeks received a further 4 weeks of
      treatment. RESULTS: Two hundred and seventy-four patients were screened, 251
      patients were randomized and 230 patients completed the trial. The numbers of
      patients with relief from heartburn on day 4 were similar in the two groups (84% 
      for rabeprazole; 95% confidence interval, 76-90%; 83% for omeprazole; 95%
      confidence interval, 75-89%). There were no significant differences between the
      treatments in the relief from other gastro-oesophageal reflux disease symptoms or
      in healing rates. The number of reports of severe heartburn during the first 3
      days was higher in the omeprazole group (daytime heartburn: 4.7% for rabeprazole 
      vs. 10.3% for omeprazole, P=0.005; night-time heartburn: 4.7% for rabeprazole vs.
      9.8% for omeprazole, P=0.01; statistical comparisons defined post hoc).
      CONCLUSIONS: Standard-dose rabeprazole was as effective as high-dose omeprazole
      in relieving symptoms by day 4 of treatment and in healing oesophageal lesions,
      but had a faster onset of action in patients with severe heartburn. This suggests
      that the improved pharmacological properties of rabeprazole translate into a
      clinically relevant advantage.

TI  - Ulcer prevention in long-term users of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs:
      results of a double-blind, randomized, multicenter, active- and
      placebo-controlled study of misoprostol vs lansoprazole.
PG  - 169-75
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies that report prevention of ulcer recurrence among long-term
      users of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that do not stratify for
      Helicobacter pylori status may not be generalizable to the large population of
      individuals without H pylori. METHODS: This was a prospective, double-blind,
      multicenter, active- and placebo-controlled study among 537 patients without H
      pylori who were long-term users of NSAIDs and who had a history of endoscopically
      documented gastric ulcer. Patients were randomized to receive placebo, 200 microg
      of misoprostol 4 times a day, or 15 or 30 mg of lansoprazole once daily for 12
      weeks. Ulcer status was determined by endoscopy at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. RESULTS:
      Patients receiving lansoprazole (15 or 30 mg) remained free from gastric ulcer
      longer than those who received placebo (P<.001) but for a shorter time than those
      who received misoprostol. By week 12, the percentages of gastric ulcer-free
      patients were as follows: placebo, 51% (95% confidence interval [CI],
      41.1%-61.3%); misoprostol, 93% (95% CI, 87.2%-97.9%); 15-mg lansoprazole, 80%
      (95% CI, 72.5%-87.3%); and 30-mg lansoprazole, 82% (95% CI, 75.0%-89.6%). A
      significantly higher proportion of patients in the misoprostol group reported
      treatment-related adverse events and early withdrawal from the study. When the
      impact of withdrawals on ulcer development was considered (as failures), therapy 
      was successful for 69% for each of the active treatment groups and 35% for the
      placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Proton pump inhibitors such as lansoprazole are
      superior to placebo for the prevention of NSAID-induced gastric ulcers but not
      superior to misoprostol, 800 microg/d. When the poor compliance and potential
      adverse effects associated with misoprostol are considered, proton pump
      inhibitors and full-dose misoprostol are clinically equivalent.

TI  - Symptom relief in gastroesophageal reflux disease: a randomized, controlled
      comparison of pantoprazole and nizatidine in a mixed patient population with
      erosive esophagitis or endoscopy-negative reflux disease.
PG  - 2849-57
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in primary care practice
      presents symptomatically, and resources to distinguish promptly between erosive
      esophagitis and endoscopy-negative reflux disease (ENRD) are limited. It is
      therefore important to determine the roles of proton pump inhibitors and
      histamine-2-receptor antagonists for first-line symptom-based therapy in patients
      with erosive esophagitis and ENRD. The aim of this study was to compare
      pantoprazole 40 mg once daily versus nizatidine 150 mg b.i.d. in a mixed GERD
      patient population with ENRD or erosive esophagitis (Savary-Miller grades 1-3).
      METHODS: A 4-wk randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter study
      conducted in Canada. Eligible patients had experienced GERD symptoms > or = 4
      times weekly for > 6 months. Patients were randomized to pantoprazole 40 mg once 
      daily or nizatidine 150 mg b.i.d.. Endoscopy was performed before randomization
      and after 4 wk of therapy. RESULTS: Of 220 patients randomized to therapy, 208
      were available for a modified intent-to-treat analysis. Erosive esophagitis was
      present in 125 patients; 35 patients were Helicobacter pylori positive. There was
      complete symptom relief after 7 days of therapy in 14% of patients on nizatidine 
      and in 40% of those on pantoprazole (p < 0.0001), and after 28 days of treatment 
      in 36% and 63% of patients, respectively (p < 0.0001). After 28 days of
      treatment, adequate heartburn control was reported by 58% of the nizatidine group
      and in 88% of the pantoprazole (p < 0.0001); erosive esophagitis healing rates
      were 44% for nizatidine and 79% for pantoprazole (p < 0.001). Rescue antacid was 
      needed by a greater number of patients using nizatidine than of those using
      pantoprazole (p < 0.001). H. pylori infection was associated with an increased
      probability of erosive esophagitis healing. CONCLUSIONS: Pantoprazole once daily 
      was superior to nizatidine b.i.d. in producing complete heartburn relief in a
      mixed population of GERD patients and in achieving erosion healing. The
      proportions of patients with complete symptom relief were greater with
      pantoprazole after 7 days of therapy than with nizatidine after 28 days. The
      present study data suggest that pantoprazole is a highly effective first-line
      therapy for the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease in a primary care
      practice setting.

TI  - Comparable clinical efficacy and tolerability of 20 mg pantoprazole and 20 mg
      omeprazole in patients with grade I reflux oesophagitis.
PG  - 1585-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several clinical trials have shown that pantoprazole (40 mg) and
      omeprazole (40 or 20 mg) have similar efficacy and safety in the treatment of
      grade II-IV reflux oesophagitis (Savary-Miller classification). AIM: To compare
      the efficacy and safety of once-daily doses of pantoprazole (20 mg) and
      omeprazole (20 mg) with respect to symptom relief and healing of patients with
      grade I reflux oesophagitis. METHODS: Patients with endoscopically established
      grade I reflux oesophagitis (non-confluent, patchy red lesions with/without white
      fibrin coating) were enrolled into this randomized, open, parallel-group,
      multicentre study. A total of 328 patients (n=166 in the pantoprazole group,
      n=162 in the omeprazole group) were recruited in 23 centres. Patients received 4 
      weeks of treatment. If the reflux oesophagitis was not completely healed, the
      treatment was extended to 8 weeks. RESULTS: After 2 and 4 weeks of treatment with
      either pantoprazole or omeprazole, the rate of symptom relief was similar (70%
      vs. 79% and 77% vs. 84%, respectively). High healing rates were observed after 4 
      and 8 weeks (pantoprazole: 84% and 90%, respectively; omeprazole: 89% and 95%,
      respectively). Both treatments were well tolerated. The most frequently reported 
      adverse events on pantoprazole and omeprazole, respectively, were nausea (8% vs. 
      7%), diarrhoea (5% vs. 6%) and headache (6% vs. 3%). CONCLUSIONS: After 4 and 8
      weeks of treatment with pantoprazole (20 mg) or omeprazole (20 mg), patients with
      mild gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (grade I) showed comparably high rates of 
      symptom relief and healing. Both treatments were safe and well tolerated.

TI  - Healing and relapse rates in gastroesophageal reflux disease treated with the
      newer proton-pump inhibitors lansoprazole, rabeprazole, and pantoprazole compared
      with omeprazole, ranitidine, and placebo: evidence from randomized clinical
      trials.
PG  - 998-1017
AB  - BACKGROUND: The older proton pump inhibitor (PPI) omeprazole and the newer PPIs
      lansoprazole, rabeprazole, and pantoprazole are approved for the acute and
      maintenance treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). OBJECTIVE: On
      the basis of the results of randomized clinical trials, this study sought to
      estimate healing and relapse rates in acute and maintenance treatment of GERD
      with the newer PPIs compared with omeprazole, the histamine2-receptor antagonist 
      ranitidine (the most frequent non-PPI comparator in studies of PPIs), and
      placebo. METHODS: A search of MEDLINE was conducted to identify randomized,
      controlled clinical trials that included a PPI in > or =1 treatment arm and
      assessed the healing of erosive esophagitis endoscopically. The primary outcome
      for studies of acute therapy was healing rate, and the primary outcome for
      studies of maintenance therapy was relapse rate. RESULTS: Fifty-three studies
      were identified, of which 38 involved acute therapy (12 excluded) and 15
      maintenance therapy. None of the studies of pantoprazole met the inclusion
      criteria for maintenance therapy. The 8-week overall healing rate ratios in the
      comparison of newer PPIs with omeprazole 20 mg/d were as follows: lansoprazole 30
      mg/d, 1.02 (95% CI, 0.98-1.06): rabeprazole 20 mg/d, 0.93 (95% CI, 0.87-1.00);
      and pantoprazole 40 mg/d, 0.98 (95% CI, 0.90-1.07). In the comparison of any PPI 
      with ranitidine 300 mg/d, the ratios were as follows: lansoprazole, 1.62 (95% CI,
      1.46-1.76); rabeprazole, 1.36 (95% CI, 1.20-1.54); pantoprazole, 1.60 (95% CI,
      1.33-1.96); and omeprazole, 1.58 (95% CI, 1.41-1.78). Relapse rates over 1 year
      of treatment were similar between lansoprazole and rabeprazole. Compared with
      ranitidine, there were statistically significant differences in the rates of
      resolution of heartburn symptoms (P < 0.002), ulcer healing (P < 0.05), and
      relapse (P < 0.01). Similar results were seen in the comparison of PPIs with
      placebo in terms of rates of resolution of heartburn symptoms (P < 0.01), ulcer
      healing (P < 0.001), and relapse (P < 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the
      newer PPIs were of similar efficacy to omeprazole in terms of heartburn control, 
      healing rates, and relapse rates. All the PPIs were superior to ranitidine and
      placebo in healing erosive esophagitis and decreasing relapse rates.

TI  - Relapse prevention in reflux oesophagitis with regard to Helicobacter pylori
      status: a double-blind, randomized, multicentre trial to compare the efficacy of 
      pantoprazole versus ranitidine.
PG  - 811-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare prospectively the effectiveness of 1 year's treatment with 
      pantoprazole versus ranitidine in order to prevent relapse after initial cure of 
      reflux oesophagitis. For the first time the influence of the initial Helicobacter
      pylori status on therapeutic results was also taken into account. METHODS: In
      order to cure reflux oesophagitis, 396 patients with Savary/Miller stage II or
      III reflux oesophagitis were treated with pantoprazole 40 mg once daily for 8
      weeks. Those who were H. pylori positive (n = 140) were also given 1 week of
      eradication treatment with clarithromycin 2 x 250 mg daily, metronidazole 2 x 400
      mg daily, and a further 40 mg pantoprazole daily. The 303 patients who were
      endoscopically cured after the 8-week period were randomized and treated with
      either pantoprazole 20 mg (n = 199) or ranitidine 150 mg (n = 104) daily in
      double-blind fashion. The primary objective was to assess the time to
      endoscopically proven recurrence of reflux oesophagitis. RESULTS: In the
      intention-to-treat (ITT) population, 66.3% (118/178) of the pantoprazole group
      and 34.0% (32/94) of the ranitidine group showed neither endoscopic nor clinical 
      symptoms of relapse after the 1-year treatment period (P < 0.0001) (per-protocol 
      populations: 70.3% [109/155] in the pantoprazole group and 39.4% [28/71] in the
      ranitidine group). In the pantoprazole group, the relapse rate in initially H.
      pylori-positive patients who underwent eradication was 30.9% (17/55) and in H.
      pylori-negative patients 29% (29/100). CONCLUSIONS: Long-term treatment with 20
      mg pantoprazole daily to prevent relapse of reflux oesophagitis in H.
      pylori-negative patients is significantly more effective than 150 mg ranitidine
      daily. The initial H. pylori eradication treatment does not influence the outcome
      of the long-term treatment.

TI  - Proton pump inhibitors versus H2-antagonists: a meta-analysis of their efficacy
      in treating bleeding peptic ulcer.
PG  - 917-26
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate whether proton pump inhibitors are more effective than
      H2-antagonists (H2-A) for the treatment of bleeding peptic ulcer. DATA SOURCES:
      PubMed database until January 2000. STUDY SELECTION: Comparative randomized
      trials of proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole, lansoprazole, or pantoprazole) vs. 
      H2-A (cimetidine, ranitidine or famotidine). DATA EXTRACTION: Meta-analysis
      combining the odds ratios (OR) of the individual studies in a global OR (Peto
      method). OUTCOMES EVALUATED: Persistent or recurrent bleeding, need for surgery, 
      or mortality. DATA SYNTHESIS: Eleven studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and
      contained data for at least one of the planned comparisons. Persistent or
      recurrent bleeding was reported in 6.7% (95% CI: 4.9-8.6%) of the patients
      treated with proton pump inhibitors, and in 13.4% (95% CI: 10.8-16%) of those
      treated with H2-A (OR 0.4; 95% CI: 0.27-0.59) (chi2-homogeneity test, 18;
      P=0.09). Surgery was needed in 5.2% (95% CI: 3.4-6.9%) of the patients treated
      with proton pump inhibitors, and in 6.9% (95% CI: 4.9-8.9%) of the patients
      treated with H2-A (OR 0.7; 95% CI: 0.43-1.13). Respective percentages for
      mortality were 1.6% (95% CI: 0.9-2.9%) and 2.2% (95% CI: 1.3-3.7%) (OR 0.69; 95% 
      CI: 0.31-1.57). SUB-ANALYSIS: Five studies evaluated the effect of both therapies
      given in bolus injections on persistent or recurrent bleeding rate, which was 6% 
      (95% CI: 3.6-8.3%) and 8.1% (95% CI: 5.3-10.9%), respectively (OR, 0.57; 95% CI: 
      0.31-1.05). Persistent or recurrent bleeding in high risk patients (Forrest Ia,
      Ib and IIa) occurred in 13.2% (95% CI: 7.9-8%) of the patients treated with
      proton pump inhibitors and in 34.5% (27-42%) of those treated with H2-A (OR 0.28;
      95% CI: 0.16-0.48). In patients not having endoscopic therapy, persistent or
      recurrent bleeding was reported, respectively, in 4.3% (95% CI: 2.7-6.7%) and in 
      12% (95% CI: 8.7-15%) (OR 0.24; 95% CI: 0.13-0.43). Less marked differences were 
      observed in patients having adjunct endoscopic therapy: 10.3% (95% CI: 6.7-13.8%)
      and 15.2% (11.1-19.3%) (OR 0.59; 95% CI: 0.36-0.97). Moreover, the significance
      disappeared in this group when a single outlier study was excluded. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Proton pump inhibitors are more effective than H2-A in preventing persistent or
      recurrent bleeding from peptic ulcer, although this advantage seems to be more
      evident in patients not having adjunct sclerosis therapy. This beneficial effect 
      seems to be similar or even more marked in patients with Forrest Ia, Ib or IIa
      ulcers. However, proton pump inhibitors are not more effective than H2-A for
      reducing surgery or mortality rates. Nevertheless, the data are too scarce and
      heterogeneous to draw definitive conclusions, and further comparative trials are 
      clearly warranted.

TI  - Pantoprazole versus lansoprazole in French patients with reflux esophagitis.
PG  - 245-50
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of pantoprazole 40 
      mg and lansoprazole 30 mg given for 4 to 8 weeks on endoscopic healing and
      symptom relief in grade II-III reflux esophagitis patients (according to
      Savary-Miller classification). METHODS: Four hundred and sixty one patients were 
      included (pantoprazole n=226, lansoprazole n=235) in this prospective,
      randomized, multicenter double-blind study. Endoscopic control was performed at 4
      weeks and at 8 weeks if esophagitis was not healed. RESULTS: In the
      intention-to-treat analysis, the healing rates at 4 weeks were 81 and 80% in the 
      pantoprazole and lansoprazole groups, respectively (NS), 90 and 86% at 8 weeks
      (NS). In the per-protocol analysis, the healing rates at 4 weeks were 86% in the 
      2 groups and at 8 weeks 97% in the pantoprazole group and 93% in the lansoprazole
      group (NS). The heartburn relief rates at day 14 were 88% and 86% in the
      pantoprazole and lansoprazole groups, respectively. Only esophagitis grade at
      entry was shown to be a predictive factor for healing at 4 weeks (P<0.0001).
      CONCLUSION: This study showed that pantoprazole 40 mg once daily is as effective 
      and well tolerated as lansoprazole 30 mg once daily in the treatment of grade
      II-III acute reflux esophagitis.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of esomeprazole compared with omeprazole in GERD patients
      with erosive esophagitis: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 656-65
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), esomeprazole,
      the S-isomer of omeprazole, has demonstrated pharmacological and clinical
      benefits beyond those seen with the racemic parent compound. This study was
      designed to further evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of esomeprazole
      relative to that of omeprazole in healing erosive esophagitis and resolving
      accompanying symptoms of GERD. METHODS: Esomeprazole 40 mg was compared with
      omeprazole 20 mg once daily in 2425 patients with erosive esophagitis
      (Helicobacter pylori negative by serology) in an 8-wk, multicenter, randomized,
      double-blind, parallel-group study conducted in 163 centers throughout the US.
      The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with healed
      esophagitis at wk 8. Secondary endpoints were the proportion of patients healed
      at wk 4, resolution of heartburn at wk 4, time to first resolution and sustained 
      resolution of heartburn, and proportion of heartburn-free days and nights. Safety
      and tolerability were also assessed. RESULTS: Significantly more patients were
      healed with esomeprazole versus omeprazole at wk 8 (93.7% vs 84.2%, p < 0.001;
      life table estimates, intention-to-treat analysis). Healing rates at wk 4 were
      81.7% and 68.7%, respectively. Esomeprazole was superior to omeprazole for all
      secondary measures and had a similar safety profile. The most common adverse
      events in both treatment groups were headache, diarrhea, and nausea. CONCLUSIONS:
      Esomeprazole demonstrates significantly greater efficacy than omeprazole in the
      treatment of GERD patients with erosive esophagitis. The tolerability and safety 
      of esomeprazole are comparable to that of omeprazole. (Am

TI  - Rabeprazole, 20 mg once daily or 10 mg twice daily, is equivalent to omeprazole, 
      20 mg once daily, in the healing of erosive gastrooesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 1245-50
AB  - BACKGROUND: Proton pump inhibitors are the most potent pharmacologic inhibitors
      of gastric acid secretion currently available, and have proven effective in the
      treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The object of this study
      was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of a new proton pump inhibitor,
      rabeprazole at two different dosages, with that of omeprazole in the healing of
      erosive GERD. METHODS: Rabeprazole 20 mg once daily (QD) and 10 mg twice daily
      (BID) were compared with omeprazole 20 mg QD in a double-blind, multicentre,
      parallel group study involving 310 patients with erosive GERD. The primary
      efficacy endpoint was oesophageal mucosal healing determined by endoscopy.
      Secondary endpoints included reduction in symptoms and improvements in
      quality-of-life scores. RESULTS: The healing rates between both rabeprazole
      groups and the omeprazole group were equivalent in both the per-protocol and
      intent-to-treat populations. In the per-protocol population, rabeprazole 20 mg
      was noted to have a numerical trend toward more rapid daytime heartburn relief.
      However, by 4 and 8 weeks of treatment, no significant differences were found
      between groups for secondary endpoints, adverse events, or laboratory
      abnormalities including elevation of serum gastrin levels. CONCLUSIONS:
      Rabeprazole 20 mg in two different dosing schedules is as effective as omeprazole
      20 mg QD with regard to efficacy and tolerability in patients with erosive GERD.

TI  - Long-term follow-up and serologic assessment after triple therapy with omeprazole
      or lansoprazole of Helicobacter-associated duodenal ulcer.
PG  - 45-8
AB  - We assessed both the effectiveness of two Helicobacter pylori (Hp) eradication
      triple therapies and the usefulness of serology in the follow-up. Fifty patients 
      with active or scarred duodenal ulcer were randomized to lansoprazole or
      omeprazole for 1 to 4 weeks, with clarithromycin 250 mg twice a day and
      tinidazole 500 mg twice a day for the first week. Endoscopies were scheduled
      before treatment, after 8 weeks, and after I year. H. pylori status was
      determined before therapy by rapid urease test and histology and during the
      follow-up by histology and culture. Serology was determined at baseline and at 6 
      and 12 months. The regimens were equally effective in inducing ulcer healing
      (95.8% vs. 87.5%) and eradicating Hp with no recurrences at 12 months. Among 44
      patients eradicated, a significant reduction of immunoglobulin G (IgG) titer
      occurred at 6 (p < 0.0001) and 12 months (p < 0.0001). If a titer reduction of
      more than 30% was taken as an indicator for Hp eradication, the specificity of
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was 75% at 6 and 95.4% at 12 months with a 100%
      sensitivity. Either lansoprazole or omeprazole combined with antibiotics are
      effective in eradicating Hp. Serology is useful for monitoring Hp eradication
      provided that an appropriate percent reduction in IgG titer is used after more
      then 6 months after therapy.

TI  - One-week triple therapy with esomeprazole provides effective eradication of
      Helicobacter pylori in duodenal ulcer disease.
PG  - 1605-11
AB  - BACKGROUND: Esomeprazole is the first proton pump inhibitor to be developed as an
      optical isomer for the treatment of acid-related diseases. METHODS: Four hundred 
      and forty eight duodenal ulcer patients with Helicobacter pylori infection,
      confirmed by 13C-urea breath test (UBT), and no current ulcer, were randomised to
      double-blind treatment with esomeprazole 20 mg twice daily (b.d.) (n=224) or
      omeprazole 20 mg b.d. (n=224), in combination with amoxicillin 1 g b.d. and
      clarithromycin 500 mg b.d. for 1 week (EAC and OAC, respectively). A negative UBT
      at both 4 and 8 weeks after completing therapy indicated successful H. pylori
      eradication. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis comprised 400 patients
      (EAC, n=204; OAC, n=196) and per protocol (PP) analysis 377 patients (EAC, n=192;
      OAC, n=185). Eradication rates (95% confidence intervals) for ITT and PP
      populations were: EAC, 90% (85-94%) and 91% (86-94%); OAC, 88% (82-92%) and 91%
      (86-95%). Between-group differences in eradication rates were not statistically
      significant. Both regimens were well tolerated, with an adverse event profile and
      frequency typical of proton pump inhibitor plus antibiotic combination therapy.
      CONCLUSIONS: Esomeprazole-based triple therapy for 1 week is highly effective in 
      eradicating H. pylori infection in duodenal ulcer disease, offers comparable
      efficacy to omeprazole-based therapy, and is well tolerated.

TI  - Esomeprazole improves healing and symptom resolution as compared with omeprazole 
      in reflux oesophagitis patients: a randomized controlled trial. The Esomeprazole 
      Study Investigators.
PG  - 1249-58
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pharmacologic profile of the new proton pump inhibitor
      esomeprazole has demonstrated advantages over omeprazole that suggest clinical
      benefits for patients with acid-related disease. METHODS: 1960 patients with
      endoscopy-confirmed reflux oesophagitis (RO) were randomized to once daily
      esomeprazole 40 mg (n=654) or 20 mg (n=656), or omeprazole 20 mg (n=650), the
      standard recommended dose for RO, for up to 8 weeks in a US, multicentre,
      double-blind trial. The primary efficacy variable was the proportion of patients 
      healed at week 8. Secondary variables included healing and heartburn resolution
      at week 4, time to first resolution and sustained resolution of heartburn, and
      per cent of heartburn-free days and nights. Safety and tolerability were also
      evaluated. RESULTS: Significantly more patients were healed at week 8 with
      esomeprazole 40 mg (94.1%) and 20 mg (89.9%) vs. omeprazole 20 mg (86.9%), using 
      cumulative life table estimates, ITT analysis (each P < 0.05). Esomeprazole 40 mg
      was also significantly more effective than omeprazole for healing at week 4 and
      for all secondary variables evaluating heartburn resolution. The most common
      adverse events in all treatment groups were headache, abdominal pain and
      diarrhoea. CONCLUSION: Esomeprazole was more effective than omeprazole in healing
      and symptom resolution in GERD patients with reflux oesophagitis, and had a
      tolerability profile comparable to that of omeprazole.

TI  - Rabeprazole versus ranitidine for the treatment of erosive gastroesophageal
      reflux disease: a double-blind, randomized clinical trial. Raberprazole Study
      Group.
PG  - 1894-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of 
      the proton pump inhibitor rabeprazole to that of the histamine-2 (H2)-receptor
      antagonist ranitidine in the treatment of erosive gastroesophageal reflux
      disease. The primary indicator of efficacy was the absence of esophageal erosions
      or ulcerations as determined by posttreatment endoscopy. Secondary indicators of 
      efficacy included improvement in frequency and severity of daytime and nighttime 
      heartburn. METHODS: A total of 338 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned
      to therapy with rabeprazole 20 mg once daily in the morning or to ranitidine 150 
      mg four times daily. At baseline and at 4 wk, patients underwent endoscopy for
      evaluation of esophageal lesions. Patients whose lesions healed by wk 4 had
      therapy discontinued; others remained on therapy and had repeat endoscopy at 8
      wk. Also recorded at study visits were patients' ratings of heartburn symptoms
      and overall sense of well being, patients' reports of time lost from daily
      activities, antacid use, and adverse events. Serum gastrin levels were measured
      and argyrophil enterochromaffin-like cell histology evaluated at baseline and
      when the patient ended therapy. RESULTS: At wk 4, healing was observed in 59%
      (98/167) of patients assigned to rabeprazole therapy, compared with 36% (60/169) 
      of those receiving ranitidine (p < 0.001). By 8 wk, healing was seen in 87%
      (146/167) and 66% (112/169) of patients in the rabeprazole and ranitidine groups,
      respectively (p < 0.001). There were also significant differences between the two
      groups favoring rabeprazole with respect to resolution or improvement of
      heartburn symptoms and improvement in sense of well-being. No drug-related
      serious adverse events were seen with either therapy; fewer patients assigned to 
      rabeprazole had treatment-emergent signs and symptoms. Serum gastrin levels
      increased over baseline in the rabeprazole group, but the mean value remained
      within normal limits. CONCLUSIONS: Rabeprazole was superior to ranitidine in
      esophageal healing and symptom relief in patients with erosive gastroesophageal
      reflux disease, and was equally well tolerated.

TI  - Review article: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection with ranitidine
      bismuth citrate- or proton pump inhibitor-based triple therapies.
PG  - 991-9
AB  - Triple therapy, combining a proton pump inhibitor with clarithromycin (C) and
      either amoxycillin (A) or a nitro-imidazole (I) is the standard in Helicobacter
      pylori eradication therapy. Recently, triple therapies based on ranitidine
      bismuth citrate (RBC) have emerged as an alternative. This review examines the
      current literature for studies directly comparing proton pump inhibitor- with
      RBC-based triple therapies. Seventeen studies were identified, of which three
      have been published as a full paper. Eradication rates in an intention-to-treat
      analysis ranged from 51 to 98%. No large difference in cure rates between the
      different regimens was demonstrated, although the RBC-I-C combination was
      somewhat superior. No definite conclusions could be made about the impact of
      metronidazole or clarithromycin resistance since only three studies performed a
      formal resistance analysis. No serious side-effects were reported, and dropout
      rates were equal for the two regimens. Both RBC- and proton pump inhibitor-based 
      triple therapies are highly effective. If one prefers a imidazole/clarithromycin 
      combination the evidence presented here suggests that RBC should be used instead 
      of a proton pump inhibitor. Larger studies comparing both forms of triple
      therapy, using proper resistance analysis, are needed before final conclusions
      can be reached regarding efficacy in the setting of bacterial resistance.

      anti-inflammatory drug-associated gastric ulcers: results of a double-blind,
      randomized, multicenter study. NSAID-Associated Gastric Ulcer Study Group.
PG  - 1455-61
AB  - BACKGROUND: The usefulness of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is
      limited by adverse gastrointestinal tract events. OBJECTIVE: To identify the
      optimal antisecretory therapy for healing of gastric ulcer in patients using
      NSAIDs and the impact of concurrent Helicobacter pylori infection on ulcer
      healing. DESIGN: Prospective, double-blind, multicenter, parallel-group study.
      SETTING: Gastroenterology practices in ambulatory and referral center settings.
      PATIENTS: Three hundred fifty-three patients with an active, nonmalignant gastric
      ulcer at least 5 mm in diameter confirmed by endoscopy and biopsy and who
      continued to receive stable doses of NSAIDs. INTERVENTION: Patients were
      randomized to receive ranitidine hydrochloride, 150 mg twice daily, or
      lansoprazole, 15 mg or 30 mg once daily, for 8 weeks. MEASUREMENTS: Healing was
      assessed by endoscopy at 4 and 8 weeks in an intent-to-treat population.
      Helicobacter pylori status was assessed by histological examination. RESULTS:
      After 8 weeks of treatment, healing was observed in 61 (53%) of 115, 81 (69%) of 
      118, and 85 (73%) of 117 patients receiving ranitidine lansoprazole, 15 mg, and
      lansoprazole, 30 mg, respectively (P<.05 for ranitidine vs both lansoprazole
      doses; 95% confidence interval, 3.2-28.0 for ranitidine vs lansoprazole, 15 mg,
      and 7.4-31.8 for ranitidine vs lansoprazole, 30 mg). The gastric ulcer healing
      rates were similar between H pylori-infected and -noninfected patients, with a
      statistically significant increase with the use of lansoprazole vs ranitidine.
      CONCLUSIONS: In patients who require continuous treatment with NSAIDs,
      lansoprazole is superior to ranitidine for healing of NSAID-associated gastric
      ulcers. Healing is not delayed by the presence of H pylori infection.

TI  - Rabeprazole is superior to ranitidine in the management of active duodenal ulcer 
      disease: results of a double-blind, randomized North American study.
PG  - 936-42
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and
      tolerability of rabeprazole versus ranitidine in the treatment of patients with
      active duodenal ulcer disease. METHODS: This multicenter, double-blind,
      randomized, parallel-group study enrolled 376 patients. Patients were randomly
      assigned to receive rabeprazole 20 mg administered once daily in the morning
      (q.a.m.) with matching ranitidine placebo twice daily (b.i.d.) (n = 188), or
      ranitidine 150 mg b.i.d. with matching rabeprazole placebo q.a.m. (n = 188).
      Three visits were scheduled: wk 0 (baseline; days -3 to -1), wk 2 (day 15+/-3
      days), and wk 4 (day 29+/-3 days). The primary efficacy response variable was
      defined as complete regeneration of the mucosa at the site of all ulcers
      identified during the study. Secondary efficacy variables included patients'
      ratings of frequency and severity of ulcer pain, frequency of antacid use, and
      improvement of overall physical well-being. Tolerability was evaluated with
      analyses of adverse events, laboratory evaluations, fasting serum gastrin levels,
      vital signs, body weight, and electrocardiograms. RESULTS: Up to 4 wk of
      treatment with rabeprazole 20 mg q.a.m. produced significantly greater healing
      rates, compared to treatment with ranitidine 150 mg b.i.d. (83% vs 73%; p =
      0.017). Significant differences between treatment groups were also observed for
      secondary efficacy indices. At wk 2, rabeprazole was more likely than ranitidine 
      to produce complete resolution of duodenal ulcer pain (39% vs 25%; p = 0.006),
      improvement in duodenal ulcer nighttime pain severity (76% vs 65%; p = 0.044),
      and improvement in overall well-being (55% vs 41%; p = 0.009). At wk 4, the
      proportion of patients with normalization of overall well-being was significantly
      higher in the rabeprazole group than in the ranitidine group (45% vs 29%; p =
      0.003). Rabeprazole was safe and well tolerated in this study. CONCLUSIONS: In
      patients with active duodenal ulcer disease, rabeprazole 20 mg q.a.m. is superior
      to ranitidine 150 mg b.i.d. in healing, resolving ulcer pain frequency, improving
      nighttime pain severity, and improving overall well-being. Rabeprazole is an
      effective and well-tolerated alternative treatment for patients with active
      duodenal ulcer disease.

TI  - Pantoprazole versus ranitidine in the treatment of duodenal ulcer: a multicenter 
      study in Brazil.
PG  - 62-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness and tolerance
      of pantoprazole versus ranitidine in the treatment of duodenal ulcers in the
      Brazilian population. METHODS: A total of 222 patients with active duodenal
      ulcers (DU) were randomly allocated to a double dummy blind treatment, either
      with ranitidine (RAN) 300 mg (111, aged from 20-68 yr old, 56 female) or with
      pantoprazole (PANT) 40 mg (111 patients, 18-70 yr old, 45 female). After a 2-wk
      course of treatment, each patient was clinically and endoscopically assessed for 
      ulcer healing. Failure to heal required a further 2-wk course of treatment and a 
      new evaluation thereafter. RESULTS: In all, 77 of the 103 patients in the PANT
      group (74.8%) and 42 of the 94 patients in the RAN group (44.7%) who completed
      the study had ulcer healing after one 2-wk treatment course, and an additional 23
      in the PANT group (22.3%) and 28 in the RAN group (29.8%) after the second 2-wk
      treatment course, totaling 100 (97.1%) and 70 (74.5%), respectively. Therapeutic 
      gain in favor of pantoprazole was significant both at the end of the first and
      the second 2-wk treatment course (p<0.001). At 2 wk, symptoms remission was
      significantly higher in the PANT group (97.6%) than with the RAN group (77.5%)
      (p<0.001). The Intention-to-treat analysis showed results statistically similar
      to those observed in the per-protocol analysis. Minor adverse events were
      reported by four patients in the PANT group and three in the RAN group. No
      relevant laboratory abnormalities were seen. No patient withdrew from the study
      due to adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that pantoprazole is more
      effective than ranitidine in the treatment of duodenal ulcer providing faster
      ulcer healing in most patients (97.1%), in 4 wk. Adverse events were rare and
      were similar in both groups, and had no influence on the therapeutic outcome.

TI  - Standard-dose lansoprazole is more effective than high-dose ranitidine in
      achieving endoscopic healing and symptom relief in patients with moderately
      severe reflux oesophagitis. The Dutch Lansoprazole Study Group.
PG  - 1611-20
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the treatment of reflux oesophagitis, H2-receptor antagonists are 
      still widely used in spite of the apparent higher efficacy of proton pump
      inhibitors. In an attempt to compensate for the lower efficacy, H2-receptor
      antagonists are now increasingly being used at a higher dose. OBJECTIVE: To
      assess whether or not standard-dose lansoprazole (30 mg o.d.) is more effective
      than high-dose ranitidine (300 mg b.d.) in moderately severe reflux oesophagitis 
      (grades II-III). METHODS: Lansoprazole or ranitidine was given to 133 patients
      for 4-8 weeks in a double-blind, randomized, parallel group, multicentre trial.
      RESULTS: The percentage of patients with endoscopically-verified healing was
      significantly higher on lansoprazole than on ranitidine both after 4 weeks (79%
      vs. 42%) and 8 weeks (91% vs. 66%), though smoking had a negative impact on
      oesophagitis healing with lansoprazole. Heartburn, retrosternal pain and belching
      improved significantly better with lansoprazole than with ranitidine, as did the 
      patient-rated overall symptom severity. Relief of heartburn appeared somewhat
      faster with ranitidine, but was more pronounced with lansoprazole. The number of 
      patients with adverse events was similar in both treatment groups. CONCLUSION:
      Standard-dose lansoprazole is better than high-dose ranitidine in moderately
      severe reflux oesophagitis.

TI  - Lansoprazole versus omeprazole for duodenal ulcer healing and prevention of
      relapse: a randomized, multicenter, double-masked trial.
PG  - 1321-32
AB  - The aim of this randomized, multicenter, double-masked, parallel-group study was 
      to compare the efficacy of lansoprazole with that of omeprazole monotherapy in
      duodenal ulcer healing and prevention of relapse. A total of 251 patients with
      duodenal ulcer were treated with either lansoprazole 30 mg/d (n = 167) or
      omeprazole 40 mg/d (n = 84). Patients with healed ulcers were then randomly
      allocated to 12 months of maintenance therapy with lansoprazole 15 mg/d (n = 74),
      lansoprazole 30 mg/d (n = 71), or omeprazole 20 mg/d (n = 73). Healing rates at 4
      weeks (intent-to-treat analysis) were 93.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 90.2% 
      to 97.6%) with lansoprazole and 97.5% (95% CI, 93.7% to 100%) with omeprazole;
      there were no significant differences between groups. Endoscopic relapse rates
      after 6 months were 4.5% (95% CI, 0% to 10.6%) with lansoprazole 15 mg, 0% with
      lansoprazole 30 mg, and 6.3% (95% CI, 1.5% to 12.5%) with omeprazole 20 mg,
      compared with 3.3% (95% CI, 0% to 8.2%), 0%, and 3.5% (95% CI, 0% to 8.8%),
      respectively, at 12 months. Again, there were no significant differences between 
      groups. The incidence of adverse events during acute treatment was 6.0% and 7.1% 
      in the lansoprazole and omeprazole groups, respectively; during maintenance
      therapy, the incidences were 12.2% (lansoprazole 15 mg), 5.6% (lansoprazole 30
      mg), and 11.0% (omeprazole 20 mg). Within treatment groups, pain was
      significantly ameliorated after the acute phase but not after maintenance therapy
      (P < 0.05); no differences were observed between groups. Gastrin values increased
      significantly after acute therapy (P < 0.05), persisted at these increased levels
      during maintenance therapy, and returned to normal after 6-month follow-up. Both 
      lansoprazole and omeprazole were highly effective and well tolerated in the
      treatment of duodenal ulcer; relapse rates were similar for all doses studied.
      Thus no additional benefit is to be gained from using a proton-pump inhibitor at 
      a dose > 15 mg lansoprazole to prevent relapse.

TI  - Comparative treatment of Helicobacter pylori-positive duodenal ulcer using
      pantoprazole at low and high doses versus omeprazole in triple therapy.
PG  - 178-84
AB  - BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori eradication has become the standard treatment for
      peptic ulcer disease. H. pylori-eradicating triple therapy with omeprazole plus
      two antibiotics has been used until recently; however, the efficacy of
      pantoprazole and antibiotics for H. pylori eradication has not been researched
      thoroughly until now. The aim of this randomized clinical trial was to verify the
      efficacy of triple oral therapy comparing the effects of pantoprazole using two
      different doses versus omeprazole twice daily in H. pylori eradication, in ulcer 
      healing and relapses, and in gastritis improvement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We
      enrolled 243 patients with H. pylori-positive duodenal ulcer and randomized them 
      into three treatment groups: 84 patients (group Ome40) were assigned to receive
      omeprazole, 20 mg twice daily, plus amoxicillin, 1 gm twice daily, and
      clarithromycin, 500 mg twice daily for 10 days; 79 patients (group Pan40) were
      treated with pantoprazole, 40 mg daily, plus amoxicillin and clarithromycin at
      the same doses as those of group Ome40; and 80 patients (group Pan80) were
      treated with pantoprazole, 40 mg twice daily, plus amoxicillin and clarithromycin
      at the same doses as those of group Ome40. RESULTS: Ulcer healing was observed in
      81 of 84 patients (96.4%) in group Ome40; in 66 of 79 patients (83.5%) in group
      Pan40; and in 77 of 80 patients (96.2%) in group Pan80. H. pylori was eradicated 
      in 79 of 84 patients (94%) in group Ome40; in 63 of 79 patients (79.7%) in group 
      Pan40; and in 75 of 80 patients (93.7%) in group Pan80. CONCLUSIONS: We found
      that 10-day triple therapy with amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and either
      pantoprazole, 80 mg daily, or omeprazole, 40 mg daily, is highly effective in
      ulcer healing and is very well tolerated, achieving the 90% cure recommended for 
      an ideal first-line anti-H. pylori positive duodenal ulcer treatment regimen.

AB  - To study the effects of treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in a
      hyperendemic population, 143 infected patients from the region of Narino,
      Colombia, were treated for 2 weeks with clarithromycin (500 mg twice a day),
      amoxicillin (1 g twice a day), and either lansoprazole (30 mg twice a day) or
      omeprazole (30 mg twice a day). All patients belong to a low socioeconomic
      strata, had multifocal atrophic gastritis documented by gastric biopsies, and had
      been treated previously and unsuccessfully for 2 weeks with bismuth subsalicylate
      (262 mg four times a day), amoxicillin (500 mg three times a day), and
      metronidazole (400 mg three times a day). 13C-urea breath tests were performed 6,
      12, 24, and 60 weeks after completing therapy. The 13C-urea breath test was
      negative in 79.7% of patients 1 month after finishing therapy, and in 69.2% of
      patients 1 year after finishing treatment. There were no differences in
      eradication rates between patients treated with omeprazole versus lansoprazole.
      Dyspepsia symptoms decreased from 74% in patients at baseline to 19% at the time 
      of finishing treatment. In low-socioeconomic status populations with hyperendemic
      infection, triple therapy using omeprazole or lansoprazole plus clarithromycin
      and amoxicillin is an effective alternative when previous standard bismuth-based 
      triple therapy has failed.

TI  - Double-blind comparison of lansoprazole 15 mg, lansoprazole 30 mg and placebo as 
      maintenance therapy in patients with healed duodenal ulcers resistant to
      H2-receptor antagonists.
PG  - 959-67
AB  - BACKGROUND: Maintenance antisecretory therapy is often used to prevent duodenal
      ulcer recurrence and control symptoms. This study compared the efficacy and
      safety of lansoprazole 15 mg and 30 mg daily with placebo in preventing ulcer
      recurrence in patients with a recent history of duodenal ulcer disease. METHODS: 
      Fifty-six patients were treated with either lansoprazole 15 mg, 30 mg or placebo 
      o.m. RESULTS: Within 1 month of study initiation, 27% (four out of 15) of
      placebo-treated patients experienced ulcer recurrence as compared to 13% (two out
      of 15) and 6% (one out of 18) of lansoprazole 15 mg and 30 mg treated patients,
      respectively. Median time to first ulcer recurrence was > 12 months in
      lansoprazole patients. At Month 12, significantly (P < 0.001) more lansoprazole
      15 mg patients (70%) and lansoprazole 30 mg patients (85%) remained healed.
      Eighty-two per cent of lansoprazole 15 mg and 76% of lansoprazole 30 mg patients 
      remained asymptomatic during the entire study period. All placebo patients became
      symptomatic, experienced ulcer recurrence, or withdrew from the study by month
      six. The incidence of adverse events was comparable among the three treatment
      groups. CONCLUSIONS: Lansoprazole safely and effectively reduces duodenal ulcer
      recurrence and ulcer-related symptoms.

TI  - Evaluation of treatment regimens to cure Helicobacter pylori infection--a
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 857-64
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess effectiveness of treatment to cure Helicobacter pylori
      infection. DATA SYNTHESIS: Meta-analysis of 666 manuscripts (full papers,
      abstracts, letters to the editor) identified through Medline and a manual search 
      (1986 to January 1998). Data were overviewed by regression analysis with weighted
      random effects models. SUBJECTS: 53 228 patients with H. pylori infection.
      INTERVENTIONS: Patients were treated with 132 different medication combinations. 
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Cure of H. pylori infection per protocol and
      intention-to-treat basis at least 28 days after treatment. RESULTS: The
      nationality of the patients and therapeutic regimen have a significant impact on 
      the results, after correction for the heterogeneity in the precision of the cure 
      rate caused by different study sizes and random effect for study. On the basis of
      the original sample size, cure rates of 80-85% were achieved using combinations
      of a proton-pump inhibitor or ranitidine bismuth citrate with two antibiotics
      including clarithromycin, amoxycillin and metronidazole or tinidazole. Comparable
      cure rates were also achieved using a combination of a proton-pump inhibitor or
      H2-receptor antagonist with bismuth subcitrate or tripotassium dicitrato
      bismuthate, metronidazole and tetracycline. The dose of clarithromycin influenced
      cure rates. Treatment duration did not influence the outcome. CONCLUSION: Several
      therapeutic regimens are eligible to cure H. pylori infection. However, none of
      the medication combinations were able to cure H. pylori infection in more than
      85% of the patients assessed by intention-to-treat. The countries in which the
      studies were performed also had a significant impact on eradication rates.

TI  - Comparison of rabeprazole 20 mg versus omeprazole 20 mg in the treatment of
      active duodenal ulcer: a European multicentre study.
PG  - 179-86
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rabeprazole sodium is the newest member of a class of substituted
      benzimidazole molecules known as proton pump inhibitors. Other proton pump
      inhibitors have been shown to be effective in healing active duodenal ulcer.
      METHOD: This randomized, double-blind, multicentre study, conducted at 25
      European sites, compared the efficacy and tolerability of rabeprazole and
      omeprazole in patients with active duodenal ulcers. One hundred and two patients 
      with active duodenal ulcer received rabeprazole 20 mg and 103 patients omeprazole
      20 mg once daily for 2 or 4 weeks, with ulcer healing monitored by endoscopy.
      RESULTS: After 2 weeks, complete ulcer healing was documented in 69% of patients 
      given rabeprazole 20 mg and in 62% of patients given omeprazole 20 mg (N.S.).
      After 4 weeks, healing rates were 98% in the rabeprazole group and 93% in the
      omeprazole group (P = 0.083). Rabeprazole-treated patients had significantly
      greater improvement in daytime pain symptom relief than those treated with
      omeprazole at the conclusion of the study (P = 0.038). Both drugs were well
      tolerated over the 4-week treatment period. Mean changes from baseline to
      end-point in fasting serum gastrin were significantly greater in the rabeprazole 
      group, but at end-point mean values were well within normal limits for both
      groups. No clinically meaningful changes or other between-group differences were 
      observed in laboratory parameters. CONCLUSION: In this study, rabeprazole
      produced healing rates equivalent to omeprazole at weeks 2 and 4, and provided
      significantly greater improvement in daytime pain. Both treatments were well
      tolerated.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori eradication with proton pump inhibitor-based triple therapies
      and re-treatment with ranitidine bismuth citrate-based triple therapy.
PG  - 163-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that short-term triple therapy comprising a
      proton pump inhibitor, plus clarithromycin and amoxycillin be used as first
      choice in treating H. pylori infection, while eradication failure patients should
      be further treated with a quadruple therapy. Nevertheless, conflicting results
      have been reported using these treatment regimens in different countries.
      METHODS: A total of 278 patients with H. pylori infection were randomised to
      receive one-week triple therapy, comprising clarithromycin 500 mg b.d.,
      amoxycillin 1 g b.d., and either omeprazole 20 mg b.d. (OAC; 90 patients), or
      pantoprazole 40 mg b.d. (PAC; 95 patients), or lansoprazole 30 mg b.d. (LAC; 93
      patients). H. pylori infection at entry, and eradication 4-6 weeks after therapy 
      had ended, were assessed by rapid urease test and histology on biopsies from the 
      antrum and the corpus. When eradication did not occur, patients were given a
      2-week treatment comprising ranitidine bismuth citrate 400 mg b.d., tetracycline 
      500 mg t.d.s. and tinidazole 500 mg b.d. (RBTT). Eradication in these patients
      was assessed 4-6 weeks after conclusion of treatment by a further endoscopy.
      RESULTS: Six patients were lost to the follow-up. At the end of the first course 
      of treatment, the overall H. pylori eradication rate was 78% (95% CI: 73-83) and 
      79% (95% CI: 75-84) at 'intention-to-treat' (ITT) and 'per protocol' (PP)
      analysis, respectively, without any statistically significant difference between 
      treatment regimens, although a trend for better results with the omeprazole
      combination was observed. Moreover, H. pylori eradication was achieved in 82%
      (95% CI: 75-97) (ITT) and 86% (95% CI: 69-94) (PP) of 38 patients re-treated with
      RBTT regimen. CONCLUSIONS: Our data found that this short-term triple therapy is 
      not a satisfactory treatment (< 80% eradication rate) for H. pylori infection.
      The 2-week triple therapy used as re-treatment in eradication failure patients
      yielded more promising results.

TI  - Lansoprazole and omeprazole in the prevention of relapse of reflux oesophagitis: 
      a long-term comparative study.
PG  - 985-90
AB  - BACKGROUND: Proton pump inhibitors are superior to H2-receptor antagonists in the
      prevention of relapse of oesophagitis, but few data directly compare the relative
      efficacies of lansoprazole and omeprazole in preventing oesophagitis relapse over
      a prolonged period. METHODS: Patients with healed Grade II, III or IV
      oesophagitis were treated with lansoprazole 30 mg o.d. or omeprazole 20 mg o.d.
      for 48 weeks. Endoscopy and symptom assessment were performed after 12. 24 and 48
      weeks of treatment and an additional symptom assessment 36 weeks after starting
      treatment. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analysis included 248 patients
      (lansoprazole n = 126, omeprazole n = 122). Comparison of time to endoscopic
      and/or symptomatic relapse revealed no difference between the treatments. There
      was no significant difference between treatments with respect to the proportion
      of patients in whom endoscopic and/or symptomatic relapse was reported
      (lansoprazole 12/126 (9.5%), omeprazole 11/122 (9.0%)). No difference between the
      treatments in either the number or severity of adverse events was reported.
      CONCLUSIONS: Continuous treatment with either lansoprazole 30 mg or omeprazole 20
      mg is effective in preventing the relapse of oesophagitis over a 48-week period
      in a majority of patients. Both treatments exhibit a similar side-effect profile.

TI  - Pantoprazole 20 mg is effective for relief of symptoms and healing of lesions in 
      mild reflux oesophagitis.
PG  - 865-72
AB  - AIM: To investigate the efficacy of a low dose of pantoprazole, a gastric proton 
      pump inhibitor, for the relief of symptoms and healing of lesions in mild
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and to compare it with the efficacy of 
      ranitidine. METHODS: Patients with endoscopically established GERD (Stage I,
      Savary-Miller classification) were enrolled into a randomized, double-blind,
      parallel-group and multicentre study (intention-to-treat n = 209, age range 19-82
      years). They were treated once daily with oral pantoprazole 20 mg or ranitidine
      300 mg, for up to 8 weeks. End-point parameters included relief of symptoms
      (heartburn, acid regurgitation, pain on swallowing) and the healing of GERD
      lesions. Relief from symptoms was assessed after 2 and 4 weeks, and
      endoscopically confirmed healing of lesions after 4 and 8 weeks. RESULTS: The
      proportion of patients reporting complete relief from symptoms after 2 weeks was 
      greater in the pantoprazole than in the ranitidine group (69 vs. 48%, P < 0.01), 
      with further improvements seen in the pantoprazole group after 4 weeks (80 vs.
      65%, P < 0.05, Cochran-Mantel/Haenszel test). Healing of lesions was confirmed in
      70/87 (80%) patients after 4 weeks (pantoprazole group), as compared with 55/86
      (64%) patients (ranitidine group) (P < 0.05, per protocol population); after 8
      weeks the respective results were 78/87 (90%) and 63/86 (73%) patients (P <
      0.01). Both study medications were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Low-dose
      pantoprazole (20 mg) is clinically superior to ranitidine (300 mg) in providing
      fast relief from symptoms and healing of lesions in patients with mild GERD.

TI  - Efficacy of lansoprazole in eradicating Helicobacter pylori: a meta-analysis.
PG  - 195-201
AB  - BACKGROUND: The combination of lansoprazole with antibiotics either as double or 
      triple therapy has demonstrated an H. pylori eradication rate of between 80 and
      90%. With the aim of providing a complete revision of the results of these
      clinical studies and a quantification of the efficacy of lansoprazole in
      eradicating H. pylori and healing peptic ulcers, we have undertaken a
      meta-analysis of all the controlled studies published in the literature. METHODS:
      This meta-analysis reviewed all randomized, controlled clinical trials published 
      as full text articles in English between 1993 and 1996 that reported the efficacy
      of lansoprazole treatment as monotherapy or in combination with antibiotics in
      the treatment of peptic ulcer and in eradicating H. pylori. Articles were
      identified from the literature, which included both manual and computerized
      research (MEDLINE) and references provided by articles in this area. In order to 
      compare the efficacy of triple therapy comprising lansoprazole vs. another PPI,
      data from abstracts (n = 5) were used, as no full text articles were located.
      RESULTS: This systematic review of the literature documents that lansoprazole has
      a high degree of efficacy in eradicating H. pylori, above all when used within
      treatment schemes including amoxicillin or clarithromycin, and metronidazole or
      tinidazole. This efficacy is comparable to that of other PPIs. CONCLUSIONS:
      Triple therapy allows the eradication of H. pylori in more than 85% of cases in
      patients with peptic ulcer. In addition, there is a substantial comparability of 
      the efficacy of lansoprazole and omeprazole when they are used together with
      other anti-infective agents. Thus, lansoprazole appears to offer an option in the
      eradication of H. pylori.

TI  - Comparison of rabeprazole 20 mg vs. omeprazole 20 mg in the treatment of active
      gastric ulcer--a European multicentre study. The European Rabeprazole Study
      Group.
PG  - 789-95
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rabeprazole sodium is the newest member of a class of substituted
      benzimidazole molecules known as proton pump inhibitors. Other proton pump
      inhibitors have been shown to be effective in healing active, benign gastric
      ulcers. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, multicentre study, conducted
      at 25 European sites, rabeprazole and omeprazole were compared in patients with
      active gastric ulcers. Two hundred and twenty-seven patients with active benign
      gastric ulcer were randomized to receive either rabeprazole 20 mg (n = 113) or
      omeprazole 20 mg (n = 114) once daily for 3 or 6 weeks, with healing monitored by
      endoscopy. RESULTS: After 3 weeks, complete healing (ITT analysis) was documented
      in 58% of patients given rabeprazole and 61% in patients given omeprazole (N.S.).
      After 6 weeks the healing rates were identical in both groups at 91%.
      Rabeprazole-treated patients had numerically greater symptom relief at all 12
      points of comparison. The differences significantly favoured rabeprazole at week 
      3 for daytime pain improvement (P = 0.023) and at week 6 for pain frequency (P = 
      0.006) and complete resolution of night pain (P = 0.022). Both drugs were
      well-tolerated over the 6-week treatment course. Mean changes from baseline to
      end-point in fasting serum gastrin were comparable. No significant differences in
      laboratory parameters were seen. CONCLUSION: In this study, rabeprazole produced 
      healing rates comparable to omeprazole at weeks 3 and 6, but provided more
      consistent and occasionally significantly superior symptom improvement. Both
      treatments were well-tolerated.

TI  - Incidence of duodenal ulcer healing after 1 week of proton pump inhibitor triple 
      therapy for eradication of Helicobacter pylori. The Lansoprazole Helicobacter
      Study Group.
PG  - 741-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: A number of clinical studies have assessed the efficacy of short-term
      twice-daily Helicobacter pylori eradication regimens but few have investigated
      the proportion of patients in whom duodenal ulcer disease was healed with these
      regimens. AIM: To compare the safety and efficacy of four 1-week H. pylori
      eradication regimens in the healing of H. pylori associated duodenal ulcer
      disease. METHODS: Following endoscopic confirmation of duodenal ulcer disease and
      a positive CLO test, patients underwent a 13C-urea breath test to confirm H.
      pylori status. Treatment with one of four regimens: LAC, LAM, LCM or OAM, where L
      is lansoprazole 30 mg b.d., A is amoxycillin 1 g b.d., M is metronidazole 400 mg 
      b.d., C is clarithromycin 250 mg b.d., and O is omeprazole 20 mg b.d., was
      assigned randomly to those patients who were H. pylori positive, with 62 (LAC),
      64 (LAM), 61 (LCM) and 75 (OAM) patients in each treatment group. Follow-up
      breath tests and endoscopies were performed at least 28 days after the end of
      treatment. RESULTS: Duodenal ulcer disease was healed 28 days after treatment in 
      53/62 (85.5%) patients who were treated with LAC, 52/64 (81.3%) of patients
      treated with LAM, 49/61 (80.3%) of patients treated with LCM and 60/75 (80.0%) of
      patients treated with OAM (intention-to-treat analysis, n = 262, assumed unhealed
      if no follow-up endoscopy was performed). All the treatments were of similar
      efficacy (P = 0.85, chi-squared test) with regard to the healing of duodenal
      ulcer disease. CONCLUSIONS: The four 1-week treatment regimens were equally
      effective in healing H. pylori associated duodenal ulcer disease.

TI  - A comparison of omeprazole, lansoprazole and pantoprazole in the maintenance
      treatment of severe reflux oesophagitis.
PG  - 49-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: Proton pump inhibitors are effective for the healing of oesophagitis.
      Standard doses of omeprazole, lansoprazole or pantoprazole are sufficient for
      healing in mild to moderate cases of oesophagitis. AIM: To compare the efficacy
      of double the standard doses of omeprazole, lansoprazole or pantoprazole for
      maintenance treatment of severe oesophagitis complicated by a stricture. METHODS:
      Thirty-six patients with reflux oesophagitis and stricture confirmed by endoscopy
      were included in a prospective study comparing three maintenance therapies. In
      all cases weekly dilatation of the stenosis was performed and patients were
      treated with omeprazole 20 mg b.d. until healing of oesophagitis and dysphagia
      relief were achieved. Thirty participants responded to therapy and were then
      randomly assigned to 4 weeks of maintenance treatment with omeprazole (20 mg
      b.d.; n = 10), lansoprazole (30 mg b.d.; n = 10) or pantoprazole (40 mg b.d.; n =
      10). Subsequently, endoscopies were performed-the endoscopists were blinded to
      the therapy assignment. The endpoints were defined as the absence of
      oesophagitis, oesophageal stricture and complaints. RESULTS: After 4 weeks of
      treatment, the number of patients remaining in remission (no oesophagitis or
      stricture and no symptoms) was nine out of 10 (90%) in the omeprazole group, two 
      out of 10 (20%) in the lansoprazole group (P < 0.01) and three out of 10 (30%) in
      the pantoprazole group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In our study omeprazole was
      superior to either lansoprazole or pantoprazole in the maintenance treatment of
      complicated gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.

TI  - Omeprazole compared with misoprostol for ulcers associated with nonsteroidal
      antiinflammatory drugs. Omeprazole versus Misoprostol for NSAID-induced Ulcer
      Management (OMNIUM) Study Group.
PG  - 727-34
AB  - BACKGROUND: Misoprostol is effective for ulcers associated with the use of
      nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) but is often poorly tolerated
      because of diarrhea and abdominal pain. We compared the efficacy of omeprazole
      and misoprostol in healing and preventing ulcers associated with NSAIDs. METHODS:
      In a double-blind study, we randomly assigned 935 patients who required
      continuous NSAID therapy and who had ulcers or more than 10 erosions in the
      stomach or duodenum (or both) to receive 20 mg or 40 mg of omeprazole orally in
      the morning or 200 microg of misoprostol orally four times daily. Patients were
      treated for four weeks or, in the absence of healing, eight weeks. Treatment
      success was defined as the absence of ulcers and the presence of fewer than five 
      erosions at each site and not more than mild dyspepsia. We then randomly
      reassigned 732 patients in whom treatment was successful to maintenance therapy
      with 20 mg of omeprazole daily, 200 microg of misoprostol twice daily, or placebo
      for six months. RESULTS: At eight weeks, treatment was successful in 76 percent
      of the patients given 20 mg of omeprazole (233 of 308), 75 percent of those given
      40 mg of omeprazole (237 of 315), and 71 percent of those given misoprostol (212 
      of 298). The rates of gastric-ulcer healing were significantly higher with 20 mg 
      of omeprazole (but not 40 mg of omeprazole) than with misoprostol. Healing rates 
      among patients with duodenal ulcers were higher with either dose of omeprazole
      than with misoprostol, whereas healing rates among patients with erosions alone
      were higher with misoprostol. More patients remained in remission during
      maintenance treatment with omeprazole (61 percent) than with misoprostol (48
      percent, P=0.001) and with either drug than with placebo (27 percent, P<0.001).
      There were more adverse events during the healing phase in the misoprostol group 
      than in the groups given 20 mg and 40 mg of omeprazole (59 percent, 48 percent,
      and 46 percent, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The overall rates of successful
      treatment of ulcers, erosions, and symptoms associated with NSAIDs were similar
      for the two doses of omeprazole and misoprostol. Maintenance therapy with
      omeprazole was associated with a lower rate of relapse than misoprostol.
      Omeprazole was better tolerated than misoprostol.

TI  - A comparison of omeprazole with ranitidine for ulcers associated with
      nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Acid Suppression Trial: Ranitidine versus
      Omeprazole for NSAID-associated Ulcer Treatment (ASTRONAUT) Study Group.
PG  - 719-26
AB  - BACKGROUND: Suppressing acid secretion is thought o reduce the risk of ulcers
      associated with regular use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), but 
      the best means of accomplishing this is uncertain. METHODS: We studied 541
      patients who required continuous treatment with NSAIDs and who had ulcers or more
      than 10 erosions in either the stomach or duodenum. Patients were randomly
      assigned to double-blind treatment with omeprazole, 20 mg or 40 mg orally per
      day, or ranitidine, 150 mg orally twice a day, for four or eight weeks, depending
      on when treatment was successful (defined as the resolution of ulcer and the
      presence of fewer than five erosions in the stomach, and fewer than five erosions
      in the duodenum, and not more than mild dyspepsia). We randomly assigned 432
      patients in whom treatment was successful to maintenance treatment with either 20
      mg of omeprazole per day or 150 mg of ranitidine twice a day for six months.
      RESULTS: At eight weeks, treatment was successful in 80 percent (140 of 174) of
      the patients in the group given 20 mg of omeprazole per day, 79 percent (148 of
      187) of those given 40 mg of omeprazole per day, and 63 percent (110 of 174) of
      those given ranitidine (P<0.001 for the comparison with 20 mg of omeprazole and
      P=0.001 for the comparison with 40 mg of omeprazole). The rates of healing of all
      types of lesions were higher with omeprazole than with ranitidine. During
      maintenance therapy, the estimated proportion of patients in remission at the end
      of six months was 72 percent in the omeprazole group and 59 percent in the
      ranitidine group. The rates of adverse events were similar between groups during 
      both phases. Both medications were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with 
      regular use of NSAIDs, omeprazole healed and prevented ulcers more effectively
      than did ranitidine.

TI  - Prevalence and clinical spectrum of gastroesophageal reflux: a population-based
      study in Olmsted County, Minnesota.
PG  - 1448-56
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Gastroesophageal reflux is considered a common condition, but 
      detailed population-based data on reflux in the United States are lacking. The
      aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and clinical spectrum of
      gastroesophageal reflux in Olmsted County, Minnesota. METHODS: A reliable and
      valid self-report questionnaire was mailed to an age- and sex-stratified random
      sample of 2200 Olmsted County residents aged 25-74 years. RESULTS: The prevalence
      per 100 of heartburn and/or acid regurgitation experienced at least weekly was
      19.8 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 17.7-21.9). Heartburn and acid
      regurgitation were associated with noncardiac chest pain (odds ratio [OR], 4.2;
      95% CI, 2.9-6.0), dysphagia (OR, 4.7; 95% CI, 2.9-7.4), dyspepsia (OR, 3.1; 95%
      CI, 1.9-5.0), and globus sensation (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.0-3.6) but not with
      asthma, hoarseness, bronchitis, or a history of pneumonia. Among subjects with
      reflux symptoms, 1.0% reported an episode of hematemesis and 1.3% had a past
      esophageal dilatation. CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms of reflux are common among white men
      and women who are 25-74 years of age. Heartburn and acid regurgitation are
      significantly associated with chest pain, dysphagia, dyspepsia, and globus
      sensation. The percentage of patients reporting complications is low, but the
      absolute number is probably considerable given the high prevalence of the
      condition in the community.

TI  - Lansoprazole heals erosive reflux esophagitis resistant to histamine H2-receptor 
      antagonist therapy.
PG  - 429-37
AB  - PURPOSE: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, multicenter clinical trial to
      determine whether lansoprazole was superior to continued therapy with histamine
      H2-receptor antagonist therapy in healing erosive reflux esophagitis. METHODS:
      Investigators from nine medical centers enrolled 159 patients with endoscopically
      documented esophageal erosions and/or ulcers that had failed to heal with 12 or
      more wk of at least standard dosages of histamine H2-receptor antagonist therapy.
      Patients received ranitidine 150 mg b.i.d. for 8 wk or lansoprazole 30 mg for 4
      wk followed by either lansoprazole 30 mg or lansoprazole 60 mg for another 4 wk
      of treatment. Patients underwent endoscopy at screening and at weeks 2, 4, and 8.
      RESULTS: At 2, 4, and 8 wk of therapy, healing rates were significantly higher in
      the lansoprazole group compared with the ranitidine group (p < 0.001). By 8 wk,
      84% of the lansoprazole group were healed as opposed to only 32% of the
      ranitidine group. Lansoprazole was superior to ranitidine in providing relief of 
      upper abdominal burning and daytime heartburn (p < 0.001) and reducing the need
      for antacids (p < 0.001). Lansoprazole patients had less interference with sleep 
      and less day time drowsiness than ranitidine patients (p = 0.05). The percentages
      of patients with adverse events were similar in both groups. Fasting serum
      gastrin levels at weeks 4 and 8 were significantly higher in the lansoprazole
      group compared with the ranitidine group. CONCLUSION: Eight weeks of lansoprazole
      therapy is safe, superior to continued ranitidine therapy, and effective in
      healing more than 80% of patients with erosive reflux esophagitis previously
      resistant to histamine H2-receptor antagonist therapy.

TI  - Lansoprazole 30 mg versus omeprazole 40 mg in the treatment of reflux
      oesophagitis grade II, III and IVa (a Dutch multicentre trial). Dutch Study
      Group.
PG  - 1101-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy and safety of lansoprazole 30 mg daily
      (LAN30) and omeprazole 40 mg daily (OME40) in the treatment of moderate
      (Savary-Miller grade II) as well as severe reflux oesophagitis (grade III/IVa).
      DESIGN: A double-blind, randomized, multicentre study, involving 211 patients at 
      29 Dutch hospitals. METHODS: Healing was assessed by endoscopy, performed on
      admission, after 4 weeks and after 8 weeks if the patient was not healed after 4 
      weeks. Symptom relief was determined by symptom assessments at the same time
      points. Safety was evaluated by determining the incidence of adverse events.
      RESULTS: There was no significant difference in intention-to-treat (ITT) healing 
      rates after 4 weeks (LAN30 87.5%, OME40 80.6%; 95% CI (-4.0; +17.8)) and in the
      ITT overall healing (LAN30 96.1%, OME40 93.1%; 95% CI (-4.2; +10.2)) rates
      between the LAN30 and the OME40 group. Relief of reflux-related symptoms at 4
      weeks as well as 8 weeks did not differ significantly between the treatment
      groups. No difference in the incidence of adverse events was observed between the
      groups. CONCLUSION: Treatment of patients with reflux oesophagitis grade II, III 
      or IVa with LAN30 was as effective as with OME40 with respect to healing as well 
      as symptom relief.

TI  - Rapid symptom relief in reflux oesophagitis: a comparison of lansoprazole and
      omeprazole.
PG  - 757-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lansoprazole, a substituted benzimidazole, is a proton pump inhibitor
      which is highly effective in the control of 24-h intragastric acidity. The aim of
      this multicentre, randomized, double-blind study was to compare lansoprazole 30
      mg once daily and omeprazole 20 mg once daily in the symptom relief and healing
      of patients with reflux oesophagitis. METHODS: Six hundred and four patients with
      endoscopically proven oesophagitis and a recent history of heartburn were
      randomly assigned to receive lansoprazole 30 mg or omeprazole 20 mg daily for 4-8
      weeks. Daily assessment of symptoms was made by the patient using a 100-mm Visual
      Analogue Scale. Clinical symptoms were evaluated at weeks 0, 1, 4 and 8.
      Endoscopic assessment of healing, defined by normalization of the oesophageal
      mucosal appearance, was made at weeks 4 and 8. RESULTS: Two hundred and
      eighty-two patients in the lansoprazole group and 283 patients in the omeprazole 
      group were eligible for inclusion in the per protocol analysis. At 3 days, there 
      was a significant improvement in daytime symptoms of heartburn for patients in
      the lansoprazole group compared with the omeprazole group (P = 0.05). A similar
      but non-significant trend was seen at 7 days (P = 0.18). Clinical assessment at 7
      days demonstrated significant improvement in daytime epigastric pain in the
      lansoprazole group compared with the omeprazole group (P = 0.03), with a similar 
      but non-significant trend in night-time epigastric pain (P = 0.07). Healing rates
      of oesophagitis at 4 and 8 weeks were 70 and 87%, respectively, with
      lansoprazole, and 63 and 82%, respectively, with omeprazole. Logistic regression 
      analysis of the cumulative healing rates, which included baseline factors
      affecting outcome, resulted in an odds ratio of 1.46 (95% CI = 0.87-2.45),
      suggesting a higher chance of being healed with lansoprazole treatment compared
      with omeprazole treatment. A total of 615 adverse events were reported by 308
      (51%) patients during the study period. The majority of events were mild in
      nature and the incidence was similar in both treatment groups. The most
      frequently reported events were headache, diarrhoea and nausea. CONCLUSION:
      Lansoprazole provides greater symptom relief compared with omeprazole during the 
      first week of treatment. Both treatments were effective in healing oesophagitis.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of lansoprazole in the treatment of erosive reflux
      esophagitis. The Lansoprazole Group.
PG  - 1749-57
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to compare lansoprazole 30 mg, lansoprazole
      15 mg, omeprazole 20 mg, and placebo in the treatment of erosive reflux
      esophagitis. METHODS: In a double-blind, multicenter study, 1284 patients with
      endoscopically diagnosed erosive reflux esophagitis were randomized to received
      lansoprazole 30 mg (n = 422), lansoprazole 15 mg (n = 218), omeprazole 20 mg (n =
      431), or placebo (n = 213) once daily for 8 wk. At 2, 4, 6, and 8 wk, healing was
      evaluated endoscopically. Patients kept daily diaries of symptoms. RESULTS:
      Healing rates at 2, 4, 6, and 8 wk were 65.3%, 83.3%, 89.4%, and 90.0%,
      respectively, for lansoprazole 30 mg; 56.3%, 74.6%, 80.3%, and 78.8% for
      lansoprazole 15 mg; 60.9%, 82.0%, 89.7%, and 90.7% for omeprazole 20 mg; and
      23.9%, 32.8%, 36.6%, and 40.0% for placebo (all active treatments higher than
      placebo, p < 0.001). Healing rates with lansoprazole 30 mg were significantly
      higher than with lansoprazole 15 mg at all time points (p < 0.05). Healing rates 
      with omeprazole 20 mg were significantly higher than with lansoprazole 15 mg at
      4, 6, and 8 wk and were similar to those with lansoprazole 30 mg. Based on
      patient diaries, lansoprazole 30 mg produced better symptomatic relief than
      lansoprazole 15 mg or omeprazole 20 mg, primarily early in the treatment course. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Both lansoprazole 30 mg and omeprazole 20 mg were more effective
      than lansoprazole 15 mg in esophageal mucosal healing. Compared with omeprazole
      20 mg, lansoprazole 30 mg was as safe, was similarly effective with respect to
      esophageal healing, and provided superior symptomatic relief, primarily early in 
      treatment. Lansoprazole 30 mg provided greater symptomatic relief than
      lansoprazole 15 mg.

TI  - Pantoprazole and omeprazole in the treatment of reflux oesophagitis: a European
      multicentre study.
PG  - 667-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pantoprazole is a new substituted benzimidazole which inhibits
      gastric H+,K(+)-ATPase. METHODS: In this double-blind, multicentre study,
      pantoprazole 40 mg once daily was compared with omeprazole 20 mg once daily in
      the treatment of grade II and III (Savary-Miller) reflux oesophagitis. Endoscopy 
      was repeated after 4 weeks of treatment, and also after 8 weeks in patients
      unhealed at 4 weeks. RESULTS: The primary efficacy variable was ulcer healing;
      after 4 weeks, 81/103 (78.6%) patients in the pantoprazole group and 83/105
      (79.0%) patients in the omeprazole group had healed completely. After 8 weeks,
      the cumulative healing rates were 94.2% and 91.4% in the pantoprazole and
      omeprazole groups, respectively (P > 0.05 at 4 weeks and 8 weeks). Both groups
      experienced rapid relief of the key symptoms: heartburn, acid regurgitation and
      pain on swallowing. The time course of relief of the individual symptoms was
      similar in both groups after 2 and 4 weeks (P > 0.05). Both treatments were well 
      tolerated, with only three patients withdrawing owing to adverse events.
      CONCLUSION: Pantoprazole has been shown to be as effective as omeprazole in the
      treatment of reflux oesophagitis.

TI  - Pantoprazole and ranitidine in the treatment of acute duodenal ulcer. A
      multicentre study.
PG  - 511-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pantoprazole is a new substituted benzimidazole that inhibits the
      parietal cell H+,K(+)-adenosine triphosphatase. METHODS: Pantoprazole (40 mg) was
      compared with ranitidine (300 mg) in the treatment of acute duodenal ulcer. Two
      hundred and sixty-six patients with endoscopically diagnosed duodenal ulcers
      entered this multicentre, double-blind study. The primary efficacy variable was
      complete ulcer healing at 2 weeks; treatment then continued for a further 2 weeks
      if ulcers were unhealed. RESULTS: After 2 weeks 112 of 164 (68%) patients in the 
      pantoprazole group had healed ulcers, compared with 36 of 81 (44%) taking
      ranitidine (p < 0.001). After 4 weeks the cumulative healing rates were 96% and
      85% (p < 0.01). Improvement in ulcer pain was also significantly better with
      pantoprazole than with ranitidine (81% versus 62% with no pain at 2 weeks, p <
      0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Pantoprazole is clinically superior to ranitidine in the
      treatment of acute duodenal ulcer, in terms of both healing and symptom relief.

TI  - Double-blind comparison of pantoprazole and omeprazole for the treatment of acute
      duodenal ulcer.
PG  - 407-10
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the healing rates of acute duodenal ulcer in patients
      receiving pantoprazole 40 mg or omeprazole 20 mg once daily and to assess drug
      tolerance. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind study evaluating patients with healed
      duodenal ulcer on endoscopy after 2 weeks of treatment and patients unhealed at 2
      and after 4 weeks of treatment. SETTING: Hospital or private gastroenterology
      practice outpatients. PATIENTS: Men or women, aged at least 18 years, with one or
      two duodenal ulcers. Patients with ulcer complications or with other significant 
      acid-related disease were excluded. A total of 270 patients entered the study, of
      whom 255 were included in the per-protocol analysis. RESULTS: The primary measure
      of efficacy was the healing rates of duodenal ulcers. Complete healing of ulcers 
      was observed in 88 (71%) of the 124 patients in the pantoprazole group and in 85 
      (65%) of the 131 patients in the omeprazole group after 2 weeks of treatment. The
      cumulative healing rates after 4 weeks were 118 (95%) out of 124 and 117 (89%)
      out of 131 patients, respectively. There was no significant difference between
      treatment groups with respect to either healing rates or freedom from ulcer pain 
      at 2 weeks. Both treatments were well tolerated: only 10 and 11 patients in the
      pantoprazole and omeprazole groups, respectively, reported adverse events.
      Diarrhoea was reported by two patients in each group. CONCLUSIONS: Pantoprazole
      40 mg daily and omeprazole 20 mg daily are equally effective in inducing ulcer
      healing.

TI  - Comparative trial of pantoprazole and ranitidine in the treatment of reflux
      esophagitis. Results of a German multicenter study.
PG  - 192-5
AB  - In 249 patients with acute symptomatic reflux esophagitis grade II and III
      (Savary-Miller classification), we compared the efficacy and safety of
      pantoprazole, a newly developed proton pump inhibitor given at a once-daily dose 
      of 40 mg, with a standard dose of the H2 receptor antagonist ranitidine (150 mg
      b.i.d.) in a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study. Complete healing was
      achieved after 4 and 8 weeks of therapy (protocol-correct) in 69 and 82%
      (pantoprazole) and 57 and 67% (ranitidine), respectively (p = 0.054 at 4 weeks
      and p < 0.01 at 8 weeks). The predominant symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux,
      i.e., heartburn and acid eructation, were more effectively reduced in
      pantoprazole- than in ranitidine-treated patients. The frequency of adverse
      events was low and did not differ between the two treatment groups. We conclude
      that pantoprazole is superior to ranitidine in the acute treatment of reflux
      esophagitis.

TI  - Lansoprazole versus ranitidine for the treatment of reflux oesophagitis. UK
      Lansoprazole Clinical Research Group.
PG  - 145-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lansoprazole is a H+.K(+)-ATPase (proton pump) inhibitor with an
      anti-secretory action and is therefore potentially useful in the treatment of
      gastro-oesophageal reflux. METHODS: This study was conducted to determine the
      efficacy and short-term safety of lansoprazole at doses of 30 mg or 60 mg once
      daily, compared with ranitidine 150 mg twice daily, in the treatment of patients 
      with reflux oesophagitis. This was a double-blind, stratified, randomized,
      comparative, parallel group study conducted in five centres in the UK. A total of
      229 patients (155 men) aged 18-79 years with endoscopically-confirmed
      oesophagitis were randomized to receive lansoprazole 30 mg p.o. daily,
      lansoprazole 60 mg p.o. daily, or ranitidine 150 mg p.o. b.d. Efficacy was
      assessed by endoscopic examination at 4 weeks and 8 weeks, together with symptom 
      relief and antacid usage. RESULTS: Lansoprazole 30 mg and 60 mg were superior at 
      4 and 8 weeks (P < 0.01) to ranitidine in healing reflux oesophagitis: respective
      healing rates being 84%, 72% and 39% after 4 weeks and 92%, 91% and 53% after 8
      weeks. Relief of heartburn with lansoprazole 30 mg and 60 mg was superior to that
      achieved with ranitidine at both week 4 (P < 0.01) and week 8 (P < 0.02).
      Sixty-four patients experienced a total of 85 adverse events, one-third of which 
      were considered drug-related. The incidence and severity were similar in the
      three groups. CONCLUSION: Lansoprazole 30 mg and 60 mg once daily are more
      effective than ranitidine 150 mg twice daily in the short-term treatment of
      reflux oesophagitis.

TI  - Lansoprazole versus omeprazole in active duodenal ulcer. A double-blind,
      randomized, comparative study.
PG  - 210-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lansoprazole is a new substituted benzimidazole that inhibits the
      H+,K(+)-adenosine triphosphatase in the parietal cell and, like the first
      developed proton pump inhibitor omeprazole, gives a strong inhibition of gastric 
      acid output. METHODS: In this double-blind randomized comparative study patients 
      with active duodenal ulcers were treated with either 30 mg lansoprazole or 20 mg 
      omeprazole in the morning. All demographic data in the two treatment groups were 
      comparable. RESULTS: A total of 279 patients entered the study. There was no
      difference in healing rates between the groups either after 2 weeks (86.2% for
      lansoprazole and 82.1% for omeprazole) or after 4 weeks (97.1% and 96.2%). No
      patient ceased treatment owing to side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Both lansoprazole
      and omeprazole generate very high healing rates and good symptom relief in active
      duodenal ulcer. Side effects are few and mild.

TI  - Comparison of serum anti-gliadin, anti-endomysium, and anti-jejunum antibodies in
      adult celiac sprue.
PG  - 17-21
AB  - We compared the diagnostic accuracy of a new immunological marker of celiac sprue
      (CS), the antijejunum antibody (JAB), with that of antigliadin (AGA) and
      antiendomysium (EmA) antibodies. One hundred untreated adults with biopsy-proven 
      CS, 52 healthy controls, and 57 patients with inflammatory bowel disease,
      lymphoma of the small bowel, Whipple's disease, and irritable bowel syndrome were
      investigated. Only JAB and EmA were detected at a similar titer in all patients
      with untreated CS but in no controls (100% sensitivity and specificity).
      Sensitivity of AGA was, respectively, 55% for IgA and 78% for Ig class, with a
      100 and 82% specificity. The differences in frequencies between both EmA and JAB 
      with IgA and IgG AGA were highly significant. We conclude that JAB and EmA
      provide a reliable noninvasive screening test for clinically significant
      gluten-sensitive enteropathy. The lower cost of IgA-JAB is a major advantage,
      owing to the different availability of the lower third of the esophagus and
      jejunum from primates. The sensitivity and specificity of the two tests are
      almost identical, but we find interpreting EmA easier than JAB especially when
      the titer is low.

TI  - A multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled study of omeprazole versus
      ranitidine in the treatment of duodenal ulcer in Israel.
PG  - 757-61
AB  - A multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled study of 203 Israeli patients
      with endoscopically proven duodenal ulcer is described. The study compares the
      efficacy (i.e., ulcer healing and relief of symptoms) and safety of 20 mg
      omeprazole once daily in the morning, with those of 300 mg ranitidine once daily 
      at night. The omeprazole group had significantly higher cumulative healing rates 
      than the ranitidine group both at day 15 (71% vs. 55%, P < 0.03) and day 29 (94% 
      vs. 86%, P < 0.05). The efficacy was unaffected by known risk factors such as
      smoking. The omeprazole group had significantly fewer days with pain than the
      ranitidine group (median 1 vs. 3.5 days) (P < 0.03). There were no differences in
      ulcer size, symptoms or healing rates between Ashkenazi and Sephardic patients
      who were born in Israel, or who had immigrated to Israel. In summary, the present
      study confirms the efficacy and safety of omeprazole in the treatment of duodenal
      ulcer. Omeprazole provides more rapid relief of the symptoms and heals a greater 
      proportion of duodenal ulcers, within 2-4 weeks, than ranitidine.

TI  - Double-blind comparison of lansoprazole, ranitidine, and placebo in the treatment
      of acute duodenal ulcer. Lansoprazole Study Group.
PG  - 1191-200
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study in a double-blind controlled manner the effects of
      lansoprazole 15 mg or 30 mg daily compared with ranitidine 300 mg once daily and 
      placebo in the relieving of symptoms and healing of acute duodenal ulceration.
      METHODS: Two hundred eighty patients with duodenal ulcer entered in to the study 
      from 30 centers. They were randomized in a double-blind manner into four groups
      with 80 patients entered into each active treatment group and 40 patients into
      the placebo group. Endoscopy was performed at 2- and 4-wk intervals to assess
      healing. Symptom relief was recorded, serum gastrin levels were measured, and
      gastric mucosal biopsies were obtained to evaluate for the presence of acute and 
      chronic inflammation, the presence of neoplasia, and the extent of gastric
      endocrine growth at the time of endoscopy. RESULTS: After 4 wk of treatment using
      per protocol analysis, 19 of 40 (47.5%) patients receiving placebo had healed
      compared with 55 of 78 (70.5%) receiving ranitidine (p < 0.05 vs. placebo), 61 of
      76 (80.3%) receiving lansoprazole 30 mg (p < 0.05 vs. placebo), and 72 of 78
      (92.3%) receiving lansoprazole 15 mg (p < 0.05 vs. placebo and ranitidine). In
      patients with evaluable data, lansoprazole 30 mg and ranitidine produced greater 
      relief of night-time symptoms and lansoprazole 15 mg produced greater relief of
      both day- and night-time symptoms than did placebo after 4 wk of treatment.
      Ranitidine increased fasting serum gastrin levels (22%; p < 0.05 vs. placebo),
      whereas both lansoprazole regimens produced more marked rises in serum gastrin
      (54% and 60%; p < 0.05 vs. placebo and ranitidine). Lansoprazole 15 mg and 30 mg 
      also increased the density of antral G-cells (105.8% and 128.80%; p < 0.05 vs.
      baseline) and greater curvature Grimelius-positive cells (20.33% and 28.8%; p <
      0.05 vs. baseline); there were no increases in the density of antral EC- or
      D-cells, and there was no alteration of gastric endocrine growth as judged by the
      Solcia classification. Both ranitidine and lansoprazole were associated with
      decreased antral Helicobacter pylori density accompanied, in the lansoprazole
      groups, by decreased antral inflammation scores. All antisecretory regimens were 
      associated with increased inflammatory scores in the greater curvature.
      CONCLUSIONS: In acute duodenal ulceration, treatment with lansoprazole 15 and 30 
      mg produced 4-wk healing rates and symptom relief superior to those produced by
      placebo and the 15-mg dose similar to those produced by placebo. The 15-mg dose
      of lansoprazole was also superior to ranitidine in healing duodenal ulcer after 4
      wk of therapy.

TI  - Comparison of pantoprazole and ranitidine in the treatment of acute duodenal
      ulcer. Pantoprazole-Duodenal Ulcer-Study Group.
PG  - 81-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pantoprazole is a new substituted benzimidazole that blocks the
      H+/K(+)-ATPase in the gastric mucosa and thus inhibits acid secretion. METHODS:
      Efficacy and tolerability of pantoprazole (40 mg at breakfast) and ranitidine
      (300 mg at bedtime) in the treatment of uncomplicated acute duodenal ulcer were
      compared in a double-blind randomized multicentre trial. RESULTS: Of 202
      outpatients who entered the study, 185 terminated the treatment without violation
      of the protocol. After 2 weeks of treatment, healing rates (protocol correct)
      with pantoprazole and ranitidine were 81 and 53%, respectively (P < 0.001), the
      corresponding results after 4 weeks were 97 and 83% (P < 0.01). Pantoprazole was 
      more effective with respect to symptom relief. Both treatments were well
      tolerated. CONCLUSION: Pantoprazole 40 mg at breakfast is superior to ranitidine 
      300 mg at bedtime in the short-term treatment of acute, uncomplicated duodenal
      ulcer.
