TI  - Effects of statins on nonlipid serum markers associated with cardiovascular
      disease: a systematic review.
PG  - 670-82
AB  - BACKGROUND: Statins reduce cardiovascular events to a greater extent than can be 
      explained by their effect on lipids. Several studies have attempted to elucidate 
      mechanisms by which statins reduce cardiovascular risk. PURPOSE: To summarize the
      effects of statins on nonlipid serum markers and to correlate statins' effect on 
      serum markers with lipid levels and cardiovascular outcomes. DATA SOURCES:
      MEDLINE (1980 to 2003) search limited to English-language articles. STUDY
      SELECTION: Studies reporting original data in at least 10 participants on the
      effect of statins on outcomes of interest, excluding studies of cerivastatin,
      drug combinations, and patients with organ transplants. DATA EXTRACTION: Study
      design, sample size, treatment, and outcome data extracted on the basis of
      preestablished criteria. When appropriate, meta-analysis was performed by using a
      random-effects model. DATA SYNTHESIS: All statins are effective at lowering
      C-reactive protein levels, and the effect is not dose-dependent. Studies do not
      demonstrate a correlation between statins' effects on C-reactive protein levels
      and on lipids or cardiovascular outcomes. Statins do not affect fibrinogen
      levels, and limited data suggest little effect on lipid oxidation, tissue
      plasminogen activator, or plasminogen activator inhibitor. Platelet aggregation
      data are inconclusive. CONCLUSIONS: Among nonlipid serum markers examined, only
      C-reactive protein levels are statistically significantly affected by statins.
      These findings suggest that statin-mediated anti-inflammatory effects may
      contribute to the ability of statins to reduce risk for cardiovascular disease.
      Overall, however, available data are insufficient to support recommendations for 
      using nonlipid serum markers in decisions regarding statin therapy for individual
      patients.

TI  - Comparison of the efficacy and safety of rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin,
      simvastatin, and pravastatin across doses (STELLAR* Trial).
PG  - 152-60
AB  - The primary objective of this 6-week, parallel-group, open-label, randomized,
      multicenter trial was to compare rosuvastatin with atorvastatin, pravastatin, and
      simvastatin across dose ranges for reduction of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
      cholesterol. Secondary objectives included comparing rosuvastatin with
      comparators for other lipid modifications and achievement of National Cholesterol
      Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III and Joint European Task Force LDL
      cholesterol goals. After a dietary lead-in period, 2,431 adults with
      hypercholesterolemia (LDL cholesterol > or =160 and <250 mg/dl; triglycerides
      <400 mg/dl) were randomized to treatment with rosuvastatin 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg; 
      atorvastatin 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg; simvastatin 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg; or
      pravastatin 10, 20, or 40 mg. At 6 weeks, across-dose analyses showed that
      rosuvastatin 10 to 80 mg reduced LDL cholesterol by a mean of 8.2% more than
      atorvastatin 10 to 80 mg, 26% more than pravastatin 10 to 40 mg, and 12% to 18%
      more than simvastatin 10 to 80 mg (all p <0.001). Mean percent changes in
      high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the rosuvastatin groups were +7.7% to
      +9.6% compared with +2.1% to +6.8% in all other groups. Across dose ranges,
      rosuvastatin reduced total cholesterol significantly more (p <0.001) than all
      comparators and triglycerides significantly more (p <0.001) than simvastatin and 
      pravastatin. Adult Treatment Panel III LDL cholesterol goals were achieved by 82%
      to 89% of patients treated with rosuvastatin 10 to 40 mg compared with 69% to 85%
      of patients treated with atorvastatin 10 to 80 mg; the European LDL cholesterol
      goal of <3.0 mmol/L was achieved by 79% to 92% in rosuvastatin groups compared
      with 52% to 81% in atorvastatin groups. Drug tolerability was similar across
      treatments.

TI  - Effect of fluvastatin on cardiac outcomes in renal transplant recipients: a
      multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 2024-31
AB  - BACKGROUND: Renal transplant recipients are at increased risk of premature
      cardiovascular disease. Although statins reduce cardiovascular risk in the
      general population, their efficacy and safety in renal transplant recipients have
      not been established. We investigated the effects of fluvastatin on cardiac and
      renal endpoints in this population. METHODS: We did a multicentre, randomised,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 2102 renal transplant recipients with
      total cholesterol 4.0-9.0 mmol/L. We randomly assigned patients fluvastatin
      (n=1050) or placebo (n=1052) and follow up was for 5-6 years. The primary
      endpoint was the occurrence of a major adverse cardiac event, defined as cardiac 
      death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), or coronary intervention procedure. 
      Secondary endpoints were individual cardiac events, combined cardiac death or
      non-fatal MI, cerebrovascular events, non-cardiovascular death, all-cause
      mortality, and graft loss or doubling of serum creatinine. Analysis was by
      intention to treat. FINDINGS: After a mean follow-up of 5.1 years, fluvastatin
      lowered LDL cholesterol concentrations by 32%. Risk reduction with fluvastatin
      for the primary endpoint (risk ratio 0.83 [95% CI 0.64-1.06], p=0.139) was not
      significant, although there were fewer cardiac deaths or non-fatal MI (70 vs 104,
      0.65 [0.48-0.88] p=0.005) in the fluvastatin group than in the placebo group.
      Coronary intervention procedures and other secondary endpoints did not differ
      significantly between groups. INTERPRETATION: Although cardiac deaths and
      non-fatal MI seemed to be reduced, fluvastatin did not generally reduce rates of 
      coronary intervention procedures or mortality. Overall effects of fluvastatin
      were similar to those of statins in other populations.

TI  - MRC/BHF Heart Protection Study of cholesterol-lowering with simvastatin in 5963
      people with diabetes: a randomised placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 2005-16
AB  - BACKGROUND: Individuals with diabetes are at increased risk of cardiovascular
      morbidity and mortality, although typically their plasma concentrations of LDL
      cholesterol are similar to those in the general population. Previous evidence
      about the effects of lowering cholesterol in people with diabetes has been
      limited, and most diabetic patients do not currently receive cholesterol-lowering
      therapy despite their increased risk. METHODS: 5963 UK adults (aged 40-80 years) 
      known to have diabetes, and an additional 14573 with occlusive arterial disease
      (but no diagnosed diabetes), were randomly allocated to receive 40 mg simvastatin
      daily or matching placebo. Prespecified analyses in these prior disease
      subcategories, and other relevant subcategories, were of first major coronary
      event (ie, non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death) and of first major 
      vascular event (ie, major coronary event, stroke or revascularisation). Analyses 
      were also conducted of subsequent vascular events during the scheduled treatment 
      period. Comparisons are of all simvastatin-allocated versus all placebo-allocated
      participants (ie, intention to treat), which yielded an average difference in LDL
      cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L (39 mg/dL) during the 5-year treatment period.
      FINDINGS: Both among the participants who presented with diabetes and among those
      who did not, there were highly significant reductions of about a quarter in the
      first event rate for major coronary events, for strokes, and for
      revascularisations. For the first occurrence of any of these major vascular
      events among participants with diabetes, there was a definite 22% (95% CI 13-30) 
      reduction in the event rate (601 [20.2%] simvastatin-allocated vs 748 [25.1%]
      placebo-allocated, p<0.0001), which was similar to that among the other high-risk
      individuals studied. There were also highly significant reductions of 33% (95% CI
      17-46, p=0.0003) among the 2912 diabetic participants who did not have any
      diagnosed occlusive arterial disease at entry, and of 27% (95% CI 13-40,
      p=0.0007) among the 2426 diabetic participants whose pretreatment LDL cholesterol
      concentration was below 3.0 mmol/L (116 mg/dL). The proportional reduction in
      risk was also about a quarter among various other subcategories of diabetic
      patient studied, including: those with different duration, type, or control of
      diabetes; those aged over 65 years at entry or with hypertension; and those with 
      total cholesterol below 5.0 mmol/L (193 mg/dL). In addition, among participants
      who had a first major vascular event following randomisation, allocation to
      simvastatin reduced the rate of subsequent events during the scheduled treatment 
      period. INTERPRETATION: The present study provides direct evidence that
      cholesterol-lowering therapy is beneficial for people with diabetes even if they 
      do not already have manifest coronary disease or high cholesterol concentrations.
      Allocation to 40 mg simvastatin daily reduced the rate of first major vascular
      events by about a quarter in a wide range of diabetic patients studied. After
      making allowance for non-compliance, actual use of this statin regimen would
      probably reduce these rates by about a third. For example, among the type of
      diabetic patient studied without occlusive arterial disease, 5 years of treatment
      would be expected to prevent about 45 people per 1000 from having at least one
      major vascular event (and, among these 45 people, to prevent about 70 first or
      subsequent events during this treatment period). Statin therapy should now be
      considered routinely for all diabetic patients at sufficiently high risk of major
      vascular events, irrespective of their initial cholesterol concentrations.

TI  - Prevention of coronary and stroke events with atorvastatin in hypertensive
      patients who have average or lower-than-average cholesterol concentrations, in
      the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial--Lipid Lowering Arm (ASCOT-LLA): a 
      multicentre randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 1149-58
AB  - BACKGROUND: The lowering of cholesterol concentrations in individuals at high
      risk of cardiovascular disease improves outcome. No study, however, has assessed 
      benefits of cholesterol lowering in the primary prevention of coronary heart
      disease (CHD) in hypertensive patients who are not conventionally deemed
      dyslipidaemic. METHODS: Of 19342 hypertensive patients (aged 40-79 years with at 
      least three other cardiovascular risk factors) randomised to one of two
      antihypertensive regimens in the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial, 10305
      with non-fasting total cholesterol concentrations 6.5 mmol/L or less were
      randomly assigned additional atorvastatin 10 mg or placebo. These patients formed
      the lipid-lowering arm of the study. We planned follow-up for an average of 5
      years, the primary endpoint being non-fatal myocardial infarction and fatal CHD. 
      Data were analysed by intention to treat. FINDINGS: Treatment was stopped after a
      median follow-up of 3.3 years. By that time, 100 primary events had occurred in
      the atorvastatin group compared with 154 events in the placebo group (hazard
      ratio 0.64 [95% CI 0.50-0.83], p=0.0005). This benefit emerged in the first year 
      of follow-up. There was no significant heterogeneity among prespecified
      subgroups. Fatal and non-fatal stroke (89 atorvastatin vs 121 placebo, 0.73
      [0.56-0.96], p=0.024), total cardiovascular events (389 vs 486, 0.79 [0.69-0.90],
      p=0.0005), and total coronary events (178 vs 247, 0.71 [0.59-0.86], p=0.0005)
      were also significantly lowered. There were 185 deaths in the atorvastatin group 
      and 212 in the placebo group (0.87 [0.71-1.06], p=0.16). Atorvastatin lowered
      total serum cholesterol by about 1.3 mmol/L compared with placebo at 12 months,
      and by 1.1 mmol/L after 3 years of follow-up. INTERPRETATION: The reductions in
      major cardiovascular events with atorvastatin are large, given the short
      follow-up time. These findings may have implications for future lipid-lowering
      guidelines.

TI  - Hemostatic effects of atorvastatin versus simvastatin.
PG  - 478-84
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of simvastatin and atorvastatin on hemostatic
      parameters. METHODS: Sixty-one patients with primary hypercholesterolemia without
      coronary heart disease were treated with atorvastatin 10-20 mg/d or simvastatin
      10-20 mg/d. At baseline, 4, 12, and 24 weeks, lipid levels such as low-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol (HDL-C), very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C),
      triglycerides (TGs), and hemostatic parameters such as platelet counts, partial
      thromboplastin time (PTT) prothrombin time (PT), and fibrinogen levels were
      measured. RESULTS: At 12 weeks, the doses of the statins were increased to 20
      mg/d in 10 of 35 (28.5%) patients treated with atorvastatin and 18 of 26 (69.2%) 
      patients treated with simvastatin when the target level of LDL-C (130 mg/dL) was 
      not reached. Mean doses were atorvastatin 12.8 mg/d and simvastatin 16.9 mg/d.
      After 24 weeks, 5 patients (14.3%) in the atorvastatin group and 4 patients
      (15.3%) in the simvastatin group had not reached the goal. In patients with
      diabetes, target level (LDL-C <100 mg/dL) was not reached in 35.7% of patients in
      the atorvastatin group and 44.4% of patients in the simvastatin group. Both
      simvastatin and atorvastatin were effective in lowering TC and LDL-C levels (p < 
      0.001). Atorvastatin lowered TGs significantly (p < 0.01). Neither atorvastatin
      nor simvastatin significantly reduced VLDL-C levels. HDL-C levels increased with 
      atorvastatin, but there was no significant difference between the 2 groups.
      Platelet counts decreased with both statins nonsignificantly. Moreover,
      fibrinogen levels decreased with simvastatin and atorvastatin, but these
      reductions were significant only for simvastatin (p < 0.05). We detected
      prolongation of the PT with both drugs (p < 0.05); however, prolongation of the
      PTT was significant only with simvastatin (p < 0.001). Effectiveness of both
      statins on lipid and hemostatic parameters was dose related. Adverse effects were
      seen in 5 patients (14.2%) treated with atorvastatin and 3 patients (11.5%)
      treated with simvastatin. Elevations in serum transaminase levels >3 times the
      upper limit of normal and in creatine phosphokinase >5 times the upper limit of
      normal were not observed in any group. CONCLUSIONS: Atorvastatin was more
      effective than simvastatin on lipid parameters, although statistically
      insignificantly, while simvastatin produced more significant changes than
      atorvastatin on hemostatic parameters. The mean dose of simvastatin was greater
      than that of atorvastatin. Both statins had increased effects on lipid and
      hemostatic parameters when doses were increased. Atorvastatin and simvastatin
      were well tolerated. Different effects of statins on lipid levels and on
      coagulation parameters should be considered in patients with hypercholesterolemia
      and tendency to coagulation, especially in preventing thrombotic events. Further 
      studies in larger trials are needed to confirm these observations.

TI  - A 52-week, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, double-dummy
      study to assess the efficacy of atorvastatin and simvastatin in reaching
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride targets: the treat-to-target
      (3T) study.
PG  - 119-38
AB  - BACKGROUND: Guidelines for the prevention of coronary heart disease call for
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction as the primary target of
      treatment and reduction of triglycerides (TG) as an additional target. OBJECTIVE:
      The purpose of this study was to investigate the ability of atorvastatin and
      simvastatin to reduce LDL-C and TG concentrations and to meet 3 target lipid
      levels: LDL-C <or=2.6 mmol/L; TG <or=1.5 mmol/L; and both LDL-C <or=2.6 mmol/L
      and TG <or=1.5 mmol/L. METHODS: The Treat-to-Target (3T) Study was a 52-week,
      multicenter, randomized, parallel-group study. Using the double-blind,
      double-dummy technique, adult patients aged 35 to 75 years with cardiovascular
      disease and dyslipidemia, defined as LDL-C concentration >or=4.0 mmol/L (>or=155 
      mg/dL), were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive once-daily oral treatment with 
      20 mg atorvastatin or 20 mg simvastatin. Fasting (12-hour) blood samples for the 
      estimation of lipid levels and clinical laboratory values were collected after 4,
      8, 12, 26, and 52 weeks. The dose was doubled after 12 weeks if the target
      National Cholesterol Education Program level of LDL-C (<or=2.6 mmol/L [100
      mg/dL]) was not reached at 8 weeks. RESULTS: The intent-to-treat analysis
      included 552 patients (418 men, 134 women) randomized to receive atorvastatin and
      535 (404 men, 131 women) randomized to receive simvastatin. The number of
      patients enrolled in the study allowed the evaluation fo the drugs' effects on
      TG. Patient demogrpahic characteristics were similar for the 2 treatment groups, 
      and there were no differences in baseline lipid values. Compared with
      simvastatin, atorvastatin produced significantly greater reductions in LDL-C (8
      weeks: -46% vs -40%, P < 0.001; 52 weeks: -49% vs -44%, P < 0.001) and in TG (8
      weeks: -23% vs -14%, P < 0.001; 52 weeks: -24% vs -16%, P < 0.001). Compared with
      simvastatin-treated patients, a significantly greater number of
      atorvastatin-treated patients reached the LDL-C target after 8 weeks (45% vs 24%;
      P < 0.001). Fewer atorvastatin patients needed to have their dose doubled;
      nevertheless more atorvastatin patients reached the LDL-C target after 52 weeks
      (61% vs 41%; P < 0.001). Both statins were well tolerated. Muscular symptoms
      occurred in 12 patients (2.2%) in the atorvastatin group and in 13 patients
      (2.4%) in the simvastatin group. CONCLUSIONS: Atorvastatin 20 or 40 mg/d for up
      to 1 year of treatment was significantly more effective than simvastatin 20 or 40
      mg/d in reducing LDL-C and TG levels and at achieving recommended lipid targets
      in this selected patient population with cardiovascular disease and dyslipidemia.
      Both statis were well tolerated.

TI  - Comparative effects of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin across their dose ranges in 
      patients with hypercholesterolemia and without active arterial disease.
PG  - 33-41
AB  - The lipid-lowering effects of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin were determined
      across their dose ranges in a 6-week, randomized, double-blind trial. Three
      hundred seventy-four hypercholesterolemic patients with fasting low-density
      lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol > or =160 but <250 mg/dl (> or =4.14 but <6.47
      mmol/L) and fasting triglycerides <400 mg/dl (<4.52 mmol/L) and without active
      arterial disease within 3 months of entry received once-daily rosuvastatin (5,
      10, 20, 40, or 80 mg [n = 209]) or atorvastatin (10, 20, 40, or 80 mg [n = 165]).
      The percentage decrease in plasma LDL cholesterol versus dose was log-linear for 
      each drug, ranging from -46.6% to -61.9% for rosuvastatin 10 and 80 mg, compared 
      with -38.2% to -53.5% for atorvastatin 10 and 80 mg. The dose curve for
      rosuvastatin yielded an 8.4% greater decrease in LDL cholesterol compared with
      atorvastatin at any given dose (p <0.001). Similarly greater decreases were
      observed for rosuvastatin across the dose range in total cholesterol (-4.9%),
      non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol (-7.0%), apolipoprotein B
      (-6.3%), and related ratios versus atorvastatin (all p <0.001). Because dose
      responses for HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein A-I were
      non-log-linear and nonparallel between the 2 drugs, percentage changes from
      baseline were compared at each dose. Significantly greater increases for
      rosuvastatin compared with atorvastatin were observed for HDL cholesterol at 40
      and 80 mg, and for apolipoprotein A-I at 80 mg. Significantly greater
      triglyceride decreases were seen at 80 mg with atorvastatin over rosuvastatin.
      Both rosuvastatin and atorvastatin were well tolerated over 6 weeks.

TI  - Major outcomes in moderately hypercholesterolemic, hypertensive patients
      randomized to pravastatin vs usual care: The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering 
      Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT-LLT).
PG  - 2998-3007
AB  - CONTEXT: Studies have demonstrated that statins administered to individuals with 
      risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD) reduce CHD events. However, many of
      these studies were too small to assess all-cause mortality or outcomes in
      important subgroups. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether pravastatin compared with
      usual care reduces all-cause mortality in older, moderately hypercholesterolemic,
      hypertensive participants with at least 1 additional CHD risk factor. DESIGN AND 
      SETTING: Multicenter (513 primarily community-based North American clinical
      centers), randomized, nonblinded trial conducted from 1994 through March 2002 in 
      a subset of participants from the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment
      to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT). PARTICIPANTS: Ambulatory persons (n = 10 
      355), aged 55 years or older, with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) of
      120 to 189 mg/dL (100 to 129 mg/dL if known CHD) and triglycerides lower than 350
      mg/dL, were randomized to pravastatin (n = 5170) or to usual care (n = 5185).
      Baseline mean total cholesterol was 224 mg/dL; LDL-C, 146 mg/dL; high-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol, 48 mg/dL; and triglycerides, 152 mg/dL. Mean age was 66 
      years, 49% were women, 38% black and 23% Hispanic, 14% had a history of CHD, and 
      35% had type 2 diabetes. INTERVENTION: Pravastatin, 40 mg/d, vs usual care. MAIN 
      OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, with follow-up for
      up to 8 years. Secondary outcomes included nonfatal myocardial infarction or
      fatal CHD (CHD events) combined, cause-specific mortality, and cancer. RESULTS:
      Mean follow-up was 4.8 years. During the trial, 32% of usual care participants
      with and 29% without CHD started taking lipid-lowering drugs. At year 4, total
      cholesterol levels were reduced by 17% with pravastatin vs 8% with usual care;
      among the random sample who had LDL-C levels assessed, levels were reduced by 28%
      with pravastatin vs 11% with usual care. All-cause mortality was similar for the 
      2 groups (relative risk [RR], 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.89-1.11; P
      =.88), with 6-year mortality rates of 14.9% for pravastatin vs 15.3% with usual
      care. CHD event rates were not significantly different between the groups (RR,
      0.91; 95% CI, 0.79-1.04; P =.16), with 6-year CHD event rates of 9.3% for
      pravastatin and 10.4% for usual care. CONCLUSIONS: Pravastatin did not reduce
      either all-cause mortality or CHD significantly when compared with usual care in 
      older participants with well-controlled hypertension and moderately elevated
      LDL-C. The results may be due to the modest differential in total cholesterol
      (9.6%) and LDL-C (16.7%) between pravastatin and usual care compared with prior
      statin trials supporting cardiovascular disease prevention.

TI  - Effects of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin compared over 52 weeks of treatment in
      patients with hypercholesterolemia.
PG  - 1044-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the demonstrated benefits of low-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction in reducing the risk of coronary heart disease,
      many patients receiving lipid-lowering therapy fail to achieve LDL-C goals. We
      compared the effects of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin in reducing LDL-C and
      achieving LDL-C goals in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia. METHODS AND 
      RESULTS: In this 52-week, randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial
      (4522IL/0026), 412 patients with LDL-C 160 to <250 mg/dL received a 5-mg dose of 
      rosuvastatin (n = 138), a 10-mg dose of rosuvastatin (n = 134), or a 10-mg dose
      of atorvastatin (n = 140) for 12 weeks; during the following 40 weeks, dosages
      could be sequentially doubled up to 80 mg if National Cholesterol Education
      Program Adult Treatment Panel II (ATP-II) LDL-C goals were not achieved. At 12
      weeks, 5- and 10-mg doses of rosuvastatin were associated with significantly
      greater LDL-C reductions than 10-mg doses of atorvastatin (46% and 50% vs 39%,
      both P <.001). At 12 weeks, both rosuvastatin dosages brought more patients to
      within ATP-II and European LDL-C goals than atorvastatin (86% and 89% vs 73% and 
      75%, and 86% vs 55%, respectively). At 52 weeks, compared with atorvastatin, both
      initial rosuvastatin treatment groups significantly reduced LDL-C (47% and 53% vs
      44%, P <.05 and P <.001). Overall, more patients in the initial rosuvastatin
      10-mg group achieved their ATP-II LDL-C goal than those in the initial
      atorvastatin 10-mg group (98% vs 87%), with 82% of patients treated with
      rosuvastatin achieving their goal at the 10-mg starting dosage without the need
      for titration, compared with 59% of patients treated with atorvastatin. Both
      treatments were well tolerated over 52 weeks. CONCLUSION: Compared with
      atorvastatin, rosuvastatin produced greater reductions in LDL-C, which may offer 
      advantages in LDL-C goal attainment over existing lipid-lowering therapies.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of rosuvastatin compared with pravastatin and simvastatin in 
      patients with hypercholesterolemia: a randomized, double-blind, 52-week trial.
PG  - 1036-43
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this trial was to compare the efficacy of
      rosuvastatin with that of pravastatin and simvastatin for lowering low-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. METHODS: In this randomized,
      double-blind, multicenter trial, lipid levels were measured in 477 patients
      (baseline LDL-C > or =160 and <250 mg/dL) who received fixed doses of 5 mg of
      rosuvastatin, 10 mg of rosuvastatin, 20 mg of pravastatin, or 20 mg of
      simvastatin for 12 weeks. For an additional 40 weeks, individual daily doses were
      sequentially doubled to a maximum of 80 mg of rosuvastatin, 40 mg of pravastatin,
      and 80 mg of simvastatin, according to investigator discretion and if National
      Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel II (ATP II) LDL-C goals were 
      not achieved. RESULTS: At 12 weeks, percent LDL-C reductions after both 5-mg and 
      10-mg rosuvastatin treatment, which were 39.1% and 47.4%, respectively, were
      significantly different (P <.05) from LDL-C reductions after 20-mg pravastatin
      (26.5%) and 20-mg simvastatin (34.6%) treatment. After 52 weeks, more
      rosuvastatin-treated patients remained at their starting dose than did
      simvastatin or pravastatin patients. After dose titration, 88% and 87.5% of the
      rosuvastatin 5-mg and 10-mg groups, respectively, achieved their ATP II LDL-C
      goals, compared with 60% for pravastatin and 72.5% for simvastatin. All study
      treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Rosuvastatin reduced LDL-C levels
      more than pravastatin or simvastatin in patients with hypercholesterolemia in a
      52-week dose-titration study.

TI  - Effect of fluvastatin on ischaemia following acute myocardial infarction: a
      randomized trial.
PG  - 1931-7
AB  - AIMS: Residual ischaemia following acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is related
      to an adverse outcome, although the effect of early initiation of statin therapy 
      is unknown. METHODS: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel
      study was performed, which compared fluvastatin 80 mg daily with placebo in
      patients with an AMI and total cholesterol of <6.5 mmol.l(-1). Ischaemia was
      measured by ambulatory electrocardiographic (AECG) monitoring over 48-h at
      baseline, after 6 weeks and at 12 months. RESULTS: Five hundred and forty
      patients were included (83% male, age 61+/-11 years); 43% had an anterior AMI and
      50% were treated with fibrinolytics in the acute phase. After 12 months, the
      total cholesterol (TC) level was reduced by 13% and LDL-C
      (low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol) by 21% (from 3.5 mmol.l(-1) to 2.7
      mmol.l(-1)) in the fluvastatin treatment group. Both TC and LDL increased by 9%
      in the placebo group (P<0.001 between groups). At baseline, ischaemia on AECG was
      present in only 11% of patients, and absent in 77%; in the remaining 11%,
      recordings were technically inadequate. After 6 weeks, 32/48 (67%), and 12 months
      35/46 (76%) of the patients with ischaemia on the baseline AECG, no longer showed
      signs of ischaemia. Nevertheless, ischaemia at baseline was predictive for the
      occurrence of any major clinical event (RR=2.35; 95% CI 1.39-3.2;P <0.001).
      Fluvastatin treatment did not affect ischaemia on AECG, nor the occurrence of any
      major clinical events as compared to placebo. Post-hoc analysis in patients with 
      the most pronounced ischaemia at baseline showed a trend for a beneficial effect 
      of fluvastatin on major clinical events (P=0.084). CONCLUSION: Residual ischaemia
      after AMI is observed less frequently in the present study, than in earlier
      studies, although it is predictive for future cardiovascular events. As a result,
      the present study was underpowered, and no effect of fluvastatin on AECG
      ischaemia, or major clinical events in the first year after AMI, could be
      detected. The present data do not confirm other reports which support widespread 
      use of statin treatment early after AMI.

TI  - Pravastatin in elderly individuals at risk of vascular disease (PROSPER): a
      randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 1623-30
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although statins reduce coronary and cerebrovascular morbidity and
      mortality in middle-aged individuals, their efficacy and safety in elderly people
      is not fully established. Our aim was to test the benefits of pravastatin
      treatment in an elderly cohort of men and women with, or at high risk of
      developing, cardiovascular disease and stroke. METHODS: We did a randomised
      controlled trial in which we assigned 5804 men (n=2804) and women (n=3000) aged
      70-82 years with a history of, or risk factors for, vascular disease to
      pravastatin (40 mg per day; n=2891) or placebo (n=2913). Baseline cholesterol
      concentrations ranged from 4.0 mmol/L to 9.0 mmol/L. Follow-up was 3.2 years on
      average and our primary endpoint was a composite of coronary death, non-fatal
      myocardial infarction, and fatal or non-fatal stroke. Analysis was by
      intention-to-treat. FINDINGS: Pravastatin lowered LDL cholesterol concentrations 
      by 34% and reduced the incidence of the primary endpoint to 408 events compared
      with 473 on placebo (hazard ratio 0.85, 95% CI 0.74-0.97, p=0.014). Coronary
      heart disease death and non-fatal myocardial infarction risk was also reduced
      (0.81, 0.69-0.94, p=0.006). Stroke risk was unaffected (1.03, 0.81-1.31, p=0.8), 
      but the hazard ratio for transient ischaemic attack was 0.75 (0.55-1.00,
      p=0.051). New cancer diagnoses were more frequent on pravastatin than on placebo 
      (1.25, 1.04-1.51, p=0.020). However, incorporation of this finding in a
      meta-analysis of all pravastatin and all statin trials showed no overall increase
      in risk. Mortality from coronary disease fell by 24% (p=0.043) in the pravastatin
      group. Pravastatin had no significant effect on cognitive function or disability.
      INTERPRETATION: Pravastatin given for 3 years reduced the risk of coronary
      disease in elderly individuals. PROSPER therefore extends to elderly individuals 
      the treatment strategy currently used in middle aged people.

TI  - Treatment with atorvastatin to the National Cholesterol Educational Program goal 
      versus 'usual' care in secondary coronary heart disease prevention. The GREek
      Atorvastatin and Coronary-heart-disease Evaluation (GREACE) study.
PG  - 220-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atorvastatin is very effective in reducing plasma low-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. However, there is no long-term survival
      study that evaluated this statin. PATIENTS-METHODS: To assess the effect of
      atorvastatin on morbidity and mortality (total and coronary) of patients with
      established coronary heart disease (CHD), 1600 consecutive patients were
      randomised either to atorvastatin or to 'usual' medical care. The dose of
      atorvastatin was titrated from 10 to 80 mg/day, in order to reach the National
      Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) goal of LDL-C <100 mg/dl (2.6 mmol/l). All
      patients were followed up for a mean period of 3 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
      Primary endpoints of the study were defined as death, non-fatal myocardial
      infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, revascularisation
      (coronary morbidity) and stroke. Secondary endpoints were the safety and efficacy
      of the hypolipidaemic drugs as well as the cost-effectiveness of atorvastatin.
      RESULTS: The mean dosage of atorvastatin was 24 mg/day. This statin reduced total
      chlesterol by 36%, LDL-C by 46%, triglycerides by 31%, and non-high-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) by 44%, while it increased HDL-C by 7%; all
      these changes were significant. The NCEP LDL-C and non-HDL-C treatment goals were
      reached by 95% (n = 759) and 97% (n = 776), respectively, of patients on
      atorvastatin. Only 14% of the 'usual' care patients received any hypolipidaemic
      drugs throughout the study and 3% of them reached the NCEP LDL-C treatment goal. 
      The cost per quaility-adjusted life-year gained with atorvastatin was estimated
      at $US 8350. During this study 196 (24.5%) CHD patients on 'usual' care had a CHD
      recurrent event or died vs. 96 (12%) CHD patients on atorvastatin; risk ratio
      (RR) 0.49, confidence interval (CI) 0.27-0.73, p < 0.0001. In detail,
      atorvastatin reduced, in comparison to 'usual' care, total mortality (RR 0.57, CI
      0.39-0.78, p = 0.0021), coronary mortality (RR 0.53, CI 0.29-0.74, p = 0.0017),
      coronary morbidity (RR 0.46, CI 0.25-0.71, p < 0.0001), and stroke (RR 0.53, CI
      0.30-0.82, p = 0.034). All subgroups of patients (women, those with diabetes
      mellitus, arterial hypertension, age 60 to 75 years, congestive heart failure,
      recent unstable angina or prior revascularisation) benefited from treatment with 
      atorvastatin. Withdrawal of patients because of side-effects from the
      atorvastatin group was low (0.75%) and similar to that of the 'usual' care group 
      (0.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Long-term treatment of CHD patients with atorvastatin to
      achieve NCEP lipid targets significantly reduces total and coronary mortality,
      coronary morbidity and stroke, in comparison to patients receiving 'usual'
      medical care. Treatment with atorvastatin is well tolerated and cost-effective.

TI  - MRC/BHF Heart Protection Study of cholesterol lowering with simvastatin in 20,536
      high-risk individuals: a randomised placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 7-22
AB  - BACKGROUND: Throughout the usual LDL cholesterol range in Western populations,
      lower blood concentrations are associated with lower cardiovascular disease risk.
      In such populations, therefore, reducing LDL cholesterol may reduce the
      development of vascular disease, largely irrespective of initial cholesterol
      concentrations. METHODS: 20,536 UK adults (aged 40-80 years) with coronary
      disease, other occlusive arterial disease, or diabetes were randomly allocated to
      receive 40 mg simvastatin daily (average compliance: 85%) or matching placebo
      (average non-study statin use: 17%). Analyses are of the first occurrence of
      particular events, and compare all simvastatin-allocated versus all
      placebo-allocated participants. These "intention-to-treat" comparisons assess the
      effects of about two-thirds (85% minus 17%) taking a statin during the scheduled 
      5-year treatment period, which yielded an average difference in LDL cholesterol
      of 1.0 mmol/L (about two-thirds of the effect of actual use of 40 mg simvastatin 
      daily). Primary outcomes were mortality (for overall analyses) and fatal or
      non-fatal vascular events (for subcategory analyses), with subsidiary assessments
      of cancer and of other major morbidity. FINDINGS: All-cause mortality was
      significantly reduced (1328 [12.9%] deaths among 10,269 allocated simvastatin
      versus 1507 [14.7%] among 10,267 allocated placebo; p=0.0003), due to a highly
      significant 18% (SE 5) proportional reduction in the coronary death rate (587
      [5.7%] vs 707 [6.9%]; p=0.0005), a marginally significant reduction in other
      vascular deaths (194 [1.9%] vs 230 [2.2%]; p=0.07), and a non-significant
      reduction in non-vascular deaths (547 [5.3%] vs 570 [5.6%]; p=0.4). There were
      highly significant reductions of about one-quarter in the first event rate for
      non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death (898 [8.7%] vs 1212 [11.8%];
      p<0.0001), for non-fatal or fatal stroke (444 [4.3%] vs 585 [5.7%]; p<0.0001),
      and for coronary or non-coronary revascularisation (939 [9.1%] vs 1205 [11.7%];
      p<0.0001). For the first occurrence of any of these major vascular events, there 
      was a definite 24% (SE 3; 95% CI 19-28) reduction in the event rate (2033 [19.8%]
      vs 2585 [25.2%] affected individuals; p<0.0001). During the first year the
      reduction in major vascular events was not significant, but subsequently it was
      highly significant during each separate year. The proportional reduction in the
      event rate was similar (and significant) in each subcategory of participant
      studied, including: those without diagnosed coronary disease who had
      cerebrovascular disease, or had peripheral artery disease, or had diabetes; men
      and, separately, women; those aged either under or over 70 years at entry;
      and--most notably--even those who presented with LDL cholesterol below 3.0 mmol/L
      (116 mg/dL), or total cholesterol below 5.0 mmol/L (193 mg/dL). The benefits of
      simvastatin were additional to those of other cardioprotective treatments. The
      annual excess risk of myopathy with this regimen was about 0.01%. There were no
      significant adverse effects on cancer incidence or on hospitalisation for any
      other non-vascular cause. INTERPRETATION: Adding simvastatin to existing
      treatments safely produces substantial additional benefits for a wide range of
      high-risk patients, irrespective of their initial cholesterol concentrations.
      Allocation to 40 mg simvastatin daily reduced the rates of myocardial infarction,
      of stroke, and of revascularisation by about one-quarter. After making allowance 
      for non-compliance, actual use of this regimen would probably reduce these rates 
      by about one-third. Hence, among the many types of high-risk individual studied, 
      5 years of simvastatin would prevent about 70-100 people per 1000 from suffering 
      at least one of these major vascular events (and longer treatment should produce 
      further benefit). The size of the 5-year benefit depends chiefly on such
      individuals' overall risk of major vascular events, rather than on their blood
      lipid concentrations alone.

TI  - Fluvastatin for prevention of cardiac events following successful first
      percutaneous coronary intervention: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 3215-22
AB  - CONTEXT: Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is associated with excellent
      short-term improvements in ischemic symptoms, yet only three fifths of PCI
      patients at 5 years and one third of patients at 10 years remain free of major
      adverse cardiac events (MACE). OBJECTIVE: To determine whether treatment with
      fluvastatin reduces MACE in patients who have undergone PCI. DESIGN AND SETTING: 
      Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 77 referral
      centers in Europe, Canada, and Brazil. PATIENTS: A total of 1677 patients (aged
      18-80 years) recruited between April 1996 and October 1998 with stable or
      unstable angina or silent ischemia following successful completion of their first
      PCI who had baseline total cholesterol levels between 135 and 270 mg/dL (3.5-7.0 
      mmol/L), with fasting triglyceride levels of less than 400 mg/dL (4.5 mmol/L).
      INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive treatment with
      fluvastatin, 80 mg/d (n = 844), or matching placebo (n = 833) at hospital
      discharge for 3 to 4 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Survival time free of MACE,
      defined as cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or reintervention
      procedure, compared between the treatment and placebo groups. RESULTS: Median
      time between PCI and first dose of study medication was 2.0 days, and median
      follow-up was 3.9 years. MACE-free survival time was significantly longer in the 
      fluvastatin group (P =.01). One hundred eighty-one (21.4%) of 844 patients in the
      fluvastatin group and 222 (26.7%) of 833 patients in the placebo group had at
      least 1 MACE (relative risk [RR], 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64-0.95; 
      P =.01). This result was independent of baseline total cholesterol levels (above 
      [RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.56-1.04] vs below [RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.57-1.02] the median).
      In subgroup analysis, the risk of MACE was reduced in patients with diabetes (n =
      202; RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.29-0.97; P =.04) and in those with multivessel disease
      (n = 614; RR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.48-0.91; P =.01) who received fluvastatin compared 
      with those who received placebo. There were no instances of creatine
      phosphokinase elevations 10 or more times the upper limit of normal or
      rhabdomyolysis in the fluvastatin group. CONCLUSION: Fluvastatin treatment in
      patients with average cholesterol levels undergoing their first successful PCI
      significantly reduces the risk of major adverse cardiac events.

TI  - Comparison of efficacy and safety of atorvastatin and simvastatin in patients
      with dyslipidemia with and without coronary heart disease.
PG  - 667-71
AB  - The efficacy and safety of atorvastatin 10 mg versus simvastatin 20 mg and
      atorvastatin 80 mg versus simvastatin 80 mg was determined in a 6-week,
      prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end-point trial of dyslipidemic
      patients with and without coronary heart disease. A total of 1,732 patients with 
      hypercholesterolemia and triglycerides < or =600 mg/dl (6.8 mmol/L) were
      randomized to receive either atorvastatin 10 mg (n = 650), simvastatin 20 mg (n =
      650), atorvastatin 80 mg (n = 216), or simvastatin 80 mg (n = 216). The primary
      efficacy parameter was the change in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol
      from baseline to week 6. Secondary efficacy parameters included the percent
      change from baseline to week 6 in total cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density
      lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol,
      apolipoprotein B, and the percent of patients achieving their National
      Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) LDL cholesterol goal at study end.
      Atorvastatin had significantly greater reductions from baseline in LDL
      cholesterol than simvastatin in both comparator groups: atorvastatin 10 mg
      (37.1%) versus simvastatin 20 mg (35.4%) (p = 0.0097), and atorvastatin 80 mg
      (53.4%) versus simvastatin 80 mg (46.7%) (p <0.0001). Atorvastatin 10 and 80 mg
      also provided significantly greater reductions in total cholesterol,
      triglycerides, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B
      than simvastatin 20 and 80 mg, respectively (all p <0.05). All treatment groups
      had a significantly decreased LDL cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio from baseline
      (all p <0.0001). In both comparator groups a higher proportion of
      atorvastatin-treated patients reached their NCEP LDL cholesterol goal compared
      with simvastatin. All 4 study treatments were well tolerated.

TI  - Rosuvastatin demonstrates greater reduction of low-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol compared with pravastatin and simvastatin in hypercholesterolaemic
      patients: a randomized, double-blind study.
PG  - 383-90
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rosuvastatin (Crestor), a new, highly efficacious statin, has
      demonstrated dose-dependent low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)
      reductions of up to 65% in a dose-ranging programme with doses of 1 to 80 mg.
      DESIGN: A randomized, double-blind multicentre trial compared rosuvastatin with
      commonly used starting doses of pravastatin and simvastatin to determine relative
      efficacy in LDL-C reduction and impact on other lipid parameters in primary
      hypercholesterolaemia. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 502 patients
      (greater-than-or-equal 18 years; LDL-C greater-than-or-equal 4.14 mmol/l [160
      mg/dl] and < 6.50 mmol/l [250 mg/dl] and triglycerides less-than-or-equal 4.52
      mmol/l [400 mg/dl]) were randomized to 12 weeks of rosuvastatin 5 mg (n = 120) or
      10 mg (n = 115), pravastatin 20 mg (n=]137) or simvastatin 20 mg (n = 130).
      Rosuvastatin 5 and 10 mg reduced LDL-C by 42 and 49%, respectively, compared with
      28% for pravastatin (P < 0.001 versus both rosuvastatin doses) and 37% for
      simvastatin (P < 0.01 versus rosuvastatin 5 mg; P < 0.001 versus 10[?]mg).
      National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel II (NCEP ATP II)
      goals were achieved by 87% of rosuvastatin 10[?]mg patients, 71% of rosuvastatin 
      5[?]mg patients, 53% of pravastatin patients, and 64% of simvastatin patients;
      similar proportions of patients achieved NCEP ATP III goals. European
      Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) goals were achieved by 83, 63, 20 and 50% of
      patients, respectively. All study treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS:
      Both doses of rosuvastatin were more effective than pravastatin and simvastatin
      in meeting NCEP ATP II and EAS LDL-C targets. Rosuvastatin 10 mg was more
      effective than pravastatin and simvastatin in meeting NCEP ATP III targets.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic interactions between protease inhibitors and statins in HIV
      seronegative volunteers: ACTG Study A5047.
PG  - 569-77
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Lipid lowering therapy is used increasingly in persons with HIV
      infection in the absence of safety data or information on drug interactions with 
      antiretroviral agents. The primary objectives of this study were to examine the
      effects of ritonavir (RTV) plus saquinavir soft-gel (SQVsgc) capsules on the
      pharmacokinetics of pravastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin, and the effect of
      pravastatin on the pharmacokinetics of nelfinavir (NFV) in order to determine
      clinically important drug-drug interactions. DESIGN: Randomized, open-label study
      in healthy, HIV seronegative adults at AIDS Clinical Trials Units across the USA.
      METHODS: Three groups of subjects (arms 1, 2, and 3) received pravastatin,
      simvastatin or atorvastatin (40 mg daily each) from days 1-4 and 15-18. In these 
      groups, RTV 400 mg and SQVsgc 400 mg twice daily were given from days 4-18. A
      fourth group (arm 4) received NFV 1250 mg twice daily from days 1-14 with
      pravastatin 40 mg daily added from days 15-18. Statin and NFV levels were
      measured by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Fifty-six
      subjects completed both pharmacokinetic study days. In arms 1-3, the median
      estimated area under the curves (AUC)(0-24) for the statins were: pravastatin
      (arm 1, n = 13), 151 and 75 ng.h/ml on days 4 and 18 (decline of 50% in presence 
      of RTV/SQVsgc), respectively (P = 0.005); simvastatin (arm 2, n = 14), 17 and 548
      ng.h/ml on days 4 and 18 (increase of 3059% in the presence of RTV/SQVsgc),
      respectively (P < 0.001); and total active atorvastatin (arm 3, n = 14), 167 and 
      289 ng.h/ml on days 4 and 18 (increase of 79% in the presence of RTV/SQVsgc),
      respectively (P < 0.001). In arm 4, the median estimated AUC(0-8) for NFV (24 319
      versus 26 760 ng.h/ml; P = 0.58) and its active M8 metabolite (15 565 versus 14
      571 ng.h/m; P = 0.63) were not statistically different from day 14 to day 18
      (without or with pravastatin). CONCLUSIONS: Simvastatin should be avoided and
      atorvastatin may be used with caution in persons taking RTV and SQVsgc. Dose
      adjustment of pravastatin may be necessary with concomitant use of RTV and
      SQVsgc. Pravastatin does not alter the NFV pharmacokinetics, and thus appears to 
      be safe for concomitant use.

TI  - FDA adverse event reports on statin-associated rhabdomyolysis.
PG  - 288-95
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the number of cases of statin-associated rhabdomyolysis
      reported to the Food and Drug Administration for 6 statins and to profile the
      cases. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all domestic and foreign reports of
      statin-associated rhabdomyolysis between November 1997 and March 2000 was
      conducted. Outcome measures included the total number of reports (initial plus
      follow-up), the number of unique cases, age, gender, percentages of report codes 
      and role codes, and frequencies of concomitant interacting drugs that may have
      precipitated rhabdomyolysis, outcomes codes, and report source codes. RESULTS:
      There were 871 reports of statin-associated rhabdomyolysis in the 29-month time
      frame examined, representing 601 cases. The following number of cases were
      associated with each of the individual statins: simvastatin, 215 (35.8%);
      cerivastatin, 192 (31.9%); atorvastatin, 73 (12.2%); pravastatin, 71 (11.8%);
      lovastatin, 40 (6.7%); and fluvastatin, 10 (1.7%). Drugs that may have interacted
      with the statins were present in the following number of cases: mibefradil (n =
      99), fibrates (n = 80), cyclosporine (n = 51), macrolide antibiotics (n = 42),
      warfarin (n = 33), digoxin (n = 26), and azole antifungals (n = 12). The reports 
      of 62.1% of cases were classified as expedited. Statins were designated as the
      primary suspect in 72.0% of the cases. Death was listed as the outcome in 38
      cases. The majority of reports (n = 556) were from health professionals.
      CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the other statins, simvastatin and cerivastatin were
      implicated in a relatively higher number of reports. Because of the various
      limitations of a spontaneous reporting-system database, caution is urged when
      interpreting the relative number of cases reported.

TI  - Comparison of effects on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol with rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin in patients with
      type IIa or IIb hypercholesterolemia.
PG  - 268-75
AB  - This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 52
      centers in North America to compare the effects of the new, highly effective
      statin, rosuvastatin, with atorvastatin and placebo in hypercholesterolemic
      patients. After a 6-week dietary run-in, 516 patients with low-density
      lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol > or =4.14 mmol/L (160 mg/dl) and < 6.47 mmol/L
      (250 mg/dl) and triglycerides < or =4.52 mmol/L (400 mg/dl) were randomized to 12
      weeks of once-daily placebo (n = 132), rosuvastatin 5 mg (n = 128), rosuvastatin 
      10 mg (n = 129), or atorvastatin 10 mg (n = 127). The primary efficacy end point 
      was percent change in LDL cholesterol. Secondary efficacy variables were
      achievement of National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment
      Panel II (ATP II), ATP III, and European Atherosclerosis Society LDL cholesterol 
      goals and percent change from baseline in high-density lipoprotein (HDL)
      cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, non-HDL cholesterol,
      apolipoprotein B, and apolipoprotein A-I. Rosuvastatin 5 and 10 mg compared with 
      atorvastatin 10 mg were associated with greater LDL cholesterol reductions (-40% 
      and -43% vs 35%; p <0.01 and p <0.001, respectively) and HDL cholesterol
      increases (13% and 12% vs 8%, p <0.01 and p <0.05, respectively). Total
      cholesterol and apolipoprotein B reductions and apolipoprotein A-I increases were
      also greater with rosuvastatin; triglyceride reductions were similar.
      Rosuvastatin 5 and 10 mg were associated with improved achievement in ATP II (84%
      in both rosuvastatin groups vs 73%) and ATP III (84% and 82% vs 72%) LDL
      cholesterol goals, and rosuvastatin 10 mg was more effective than atorvastatin in
      achieving European Atherosclerosis Society LDL cholesterol goals. Both treatments
      were well tolerated.

TI  - Achieving and maintaining National Cholesterol Education Program low-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol goals with five statins.
PG  - 185-91
AB  - PURPOSE: Most patients fail to achieve and maintain low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
      cholesterol goals established by the National Cholesterol Education Program
      (NCEP). The Atorvastatin Comparative Cholesterol Efficacy and Safety Study
      (ACCESS) was a randomized study comparing the efficacy and safety of five statins
      and their ability reduce LDL cholesterol to the NCEP target level. SUBJECTS AND
      METHODS: Of 7542 patients screened, 3916 hypercholesterolemic patients were
      randomly assigned to treatment with a statin, beginning with the lowest
      recommended dose (atorvastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin, 10 mg; fluvastatin 
      and lovastatin, 20 mg). If the NCEP target was not achieved, the dose was
      titrated up to the recommended maximum (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, and
      lovastatin, 80 mg; pravastatin and simvastatin, 40 mg). The total duration of
      treatment was 54 weeks. RESULTS: Atorvastatin achieved the greatest mean
      reduction in LDL cholesterol: 36% +/- 11% at 6 weeks (initial dose) and 42% +/-
      13% at 54 weeks. More patients receiving atorvastatin at its initial dose (53%,
      997 of 1888) achieved their NCEP target levels than patients receiving
      simvastatin (38%, 174 of 462), lovastatin (28%, 134 of 472), pravastatin (15%, 71
      of 461), or fluvastatin (15%, 69 of 474) at the initial dose.
      Atorvastatin-treated patients were more likely to maintain their target levels
      from week 6 to week 54. The percent reduction in LDL cholesterol achieved at the 
      initial dose correlated strongly with the proportion of patients who maintained
      their goals at 54 weeks (r = -0.84). CONCLUSION: For patients treated with
      statins, providing a greater margin between the NCEP target level and the
      achieved LDL cholesterol level enhances the likelihood of maintaining NCEP goal
      levels.

TI  - Lipid-lowering drugs and risk of myopathy: a population-based follow-up study.
PG  - 565-9
AB  - We conducted a population-based cohort study to estimate the risk of myopathy
      associated with use of lipid-lowering drugs. Using data from general practices in
      the United Kingdom in 1991 through 1997, we identified three cohorts of
      individuals 40 to 74 years of age. One cohort comprised 17,219 persons who had
      received at least one prescription for lipid-lowering drugs in the period; a
      second cohort consisted of patients with a hyperlipidemia diagnosis who had not
      been prescribed lipid-lowering drugs (N = 28,974); and a third cohort comprised
      50,000 individuals from the general population with no diagnosis of
      hyperlipidemia. The incidence rate of myopathy in the cohort of users of
      lipid-lowering drugs was 2.3 per 10,000 person-years [95% confidence interval
      (95% CI) = 1.2-4.4], which exceeded the incidence rates observed in the
      nontreated hyperlipidemia cohort [0 per 10,000 person-years (95% CI = 0.0-0.4)]
      and the general population [0.2 per 10,000 person-years (95% CI = 0.1-0.4)]. The 
      relative risks of myopathy in current users of fibrates and statins compared with
      nonusers were 42.4 (95% CI = 11.6-170.5) and 7.6 (95% CI = 1.4-41.3),
      respectively. Potential risk factors other than drug use could not explain our
      findings in the nested case-control analysis. We conclude that use of
      lipid-lowering drugs is associated with a substantially greater risk of myopathy,
      which is most pronounced for fibrates. The absolute risk of myopathy in users of 
      lipid-lowering drugs is, however, small.

TI  - Statin-fibrate combination therapy.
PG  - 908-17
AB  - BACKGROUND: Precautionary warnings for severe myopathy and rhabdomyolysis from
      the coadministration of statins and fibrates have been well publicized. However, 
      a recent cerivastatin labeling change made the combined use with fibric acid
      derivatives a contraindication. Practical recommendations for clinicians who care
      for patients with refractory mixed hyperlipidemia are needed. OBJECTIVE: To
      provide recommendations for clinicians in the treatment of refractory mixed
      hyperlipidemia. DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive MEDLINE (1966-July 2000) and
      bibliographic search was performed. DATA SYNTHESIS: Thirty-six published clinical
      trials and 29 case reports involving combination therapy with
      hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors and fibric acid
      derivatives regarding the occurrence of rhabdomyolysis or myopathy were reviewed.
      The literature review demonstrated that combination therapy with a statin and
      fibrate increases the risk of muscle damage, with an incidence of 0.12%. Risk
      factors that predispose patients to myopathy caused by combination statin-fibrate
      therapy include increased age, female gender, renal or liver disease, diabetes,
      hypothyroidism, debilitated status, surgery, trauma, excessive alcohol intake,
      and heavy exercise. CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy with a statin and fibrate
      offers significant therapeutic advantage for the treatment of severe or
      refractory mixed hyperlipidemia. Although such a combination does increase the
      risk of myopathy, with an incidence of approximately 0.12%, this small risk of
      myopathy rarely outweighs the established morbidity and mortality benefits of
      achieving lipid goals. Nevertheless, a higher incidence of myopathy has been
      reported with statin monotherapy. When monotherapy with a statin fails to control
      mixed hyperlipidemia, combination therapy may be considered. Niacin may be added 
      before a fibrate is considered, as it appears to have less risk of myopathy.
      Statin-fibrate combination therapy must be undertaken cautiously and only after
      careful risk-benefit analysis. Patient counseling on the risks and warning signs 
      of myopathy is extremely important.

TI  - Pravastatin in acute ischaemic syndromes: results of a randomised
      placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 300-4
AB  - Therapy with individual 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase
      inhibitors (statins) has been shown conclusively to diminish coronary event rates
      and mortality in both primary and secondary prevention. To date, scant attention 
      has been paid to whether initiation of such regimens in the hospital phase of
      acute coronary syndromes might confer cardioprotective benefits. The purpose of
      this study was to determine the safety and tolerability of early initiation of
      statin therapy in patients with acute coronary syndromes. In this randomised,
      double-blind, three-month, pilot study, 100 patients with acute myocardial
      infarction or unstable angina and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol > 3.5
      mmol/l were randomly assigned to pravastatin 40 mg daily or placebo initiated
      within 48 hours of hospital admission. Pravastatin proved safe and well tolerated
      in these patients, who were well matched at baseline. No statistically
      significant differences in death, MI and drug-related adverse events were
      observed in the pravastatin group compared with control subjects. This pilot
      study shows that therapy with pravastatin early after an acute coronary event is 
      safe and well tolerated. Larger, long-term studies are needed to confirm these
      findings.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the primary hypothesis that a newer antihypertensive treatment
      regimen (calcium channel blocker +/- an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor) 
      is more effective than an older regimen (beta-blocker +/- a diuretic) in the
      primary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD). To test a second primary
      hypothesis that a statin compared with placebo will further protect against CHD
      endpoints in hypertensive subjects with a total cholesterol < or = 6.5 mmol/l.
      DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, open, blinded endpoint trial with a
      double-blinded 2 x 2 factorial component. SETTING: Patients were recruited mainly
      from general practices. PATIENTS: Men and women aged 40-79 were eligible if their
      blood pressure was > or = 160 mmHg systolic or > or = 100 mmHg diastolic
      (untreated) or > or = 140 mmHg systolic or > or = 90 mmHg diastolic (treated) at 
      randomization. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received either amlodipine (5/ 10 mg) +/- 
      perindopril (4/8 mg) or atenolol (50/ 100 mg) +/- bendroflumethiazide (1.25/2.5
      mg) +K+ with further therapy as required to reach a blood pressure of < or = 140 
      mmHg systolic and 90 mmHg diastolic. Patients with a total cholesterol of < or = 
      6.5 mmol/l were further randomized to receive either atorvastatin 10 mg or
      placebo daily. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) and
      fatal coronary heart disease (CHD). RESULTS: 19 342 men and women were initially 
      randomized, of these 10297 were also randomized into the lipid-lowering limb. All
      patients had three or more additional cardiovascular risk factors. CONCLUSIONS:
      The study has 80% power (at the 5% level) to detect a relative difference of 20% 
      in CHD endpoints between the calcium channel blocker-based regimen and the
      beta-blocker-based regimen. The lipid-lowering limb of the study has 90% power at
      the 1% level to detect a relative difference of 30% in CHD endpoints between
      groups.

TI  - Effects of atorvastatin on early recurrent ischemic events in acute coronary
      syndromes: the MIRACL study: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 1711-8
AB  - CONTEXT: Patients experience the highest rate of death and recurrent ischemic
      events during the early period after an acute coronary syndrome, but it is not
      known whether early initiation of treatment with a statin can reduce the
      occurrence of these early events. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether treatment with 
      atorvastatin, 80 mg/d, initiated 24 to 96 hours after an acute coronary syndrome,
      reduces death and nonfatal ischemic events. DESIGN AND SETTING: A randomized,
      double-blind trial conducted from May 1997 to September 1999, with follow-up
      through 16 weeks at 122 clinical centers in Europe, North America, South Africa, 
      and Australasia. PATIENTS: A total of 3086 adults aged 18 years or older with
      unstable angina or non-Q-wave acute myocardial infarction. INTERVENTIONS:
      Patients were stratified by center and randomly assigned to receive treatment
      with atorvastatin (80 mg/d) or matching placebo between 24 and 96 hours after
      hospital admission. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary end point event defined as
      death, nonfatal acute myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest with resuscitation,
      or recurrent symptomatic myocardial ischemia with objective evidence and
      requiring emergency rehospitalization. RESULTS: A primary end point event
      occurred in 228 patients (14.8%) in the atorvastatin group and 269 patients
      (17.4%) in the placebo group (relative risk [RR], 0.84; 95% confidence interval
      [CI], 0.70-1.00; P =.048). There were no significant differences in risk of
      death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or cardiac arrest between the atorvastatin
      group and the placebo group, although the atorvastatin group had a lower risk of 
      symptomatic ischemia with objective evidence and requiring emergency
      rehospitalization (6.2% vs 8.4%; RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.57-0.95; P =.02). Likewise, 
      there were no significant differences between the atorvastatin group and the
      placebo group in the incidence of secondary outcomes of coronary
      revascularization procedures, worsening heart failure, or worsening angina,
      although there were fewer strokes in the atorvastatin group than in the placebo
      group (12 vs 24 events; P =.045). In the atorvastatin group, mean low-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol level declined from 124 mg/dL (3.2 mmol/L) to 72 mg/dL
      (1.9 mmol/L). Abnormal liver transaminases (>3 times upper limit of normal) were 
      more common in the atorvastatin group than in the placebo group (2.5% vs 0.6%;
      P<.001). CONCLUSION: For patients with acute coronary syndrome, lipid-lowering
      therapy with atorvastatin, 80 mg/d, reduces recurrent ischemic events in the
      first 16 weeks, mostly recurrent symptomatic ischemia requiring
      rehospitalization.

TI  - Safety profiles for the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors: treatment and trust.
PG  - 197-206
AB  - Hypercholesterolaemia is a chronic condition that often requires life-long
      treatment, making the safety of lipid-lowering drugs a critical issue.
      3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors ('statins') 
      are commonly used as the pharmacotherapeutic treatment of choice for patients
      with hypercholesterolaemia. These agents have consistently demonstrated a
      positive safety and tolerability profile, and are recommended by the US National 
      Cholesterol Education Program guidelines and by the European Joint Task Force for
      Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease to be used after, or in addition to, a
      first-line approach with diet. Several large-scale clinical trials have shown
      HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors to be efficacious and well tolerated, and to be
      associated with a low rate of treatment withdrawal due to adverse events. These
      studies included mortality and morbidity end-points, and comprised both primary- 
      and secondary-prevention trials. Hepatic, renal and muscular systems are rarely
      affected during HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor therapy and the few drug interactions
      that can occur with concomitantly administered drugs are well documented. There
      is no conclusive evidence linking HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors to the development
      of cancer in humans. In long term studies with various HMG-CoA reductase
      inhibitors, there was no increase in cancer rates compared with placebo. Thus, it
      can be concluded that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are well tolerated, effective 
      treatments for hypercholesterolaemia.

TI  - Comparison of efficacy and safety of atorvastatin (10mg) with simvastatin (10mg) 
      at six weeks. ASSET Investigators.
PG  - 554-9
AB  - The 6-week efficacy and safety of atorvastatin versus simvastatin was determined 
      during a 54-week, open-label, multicenter, parallel-arm, treat-to-target study.
      In all, 1,424 patients with mixed dyslipidemia (triglyceride 200 to 600 mg/dl
      [2.26 to 6.77 mmol/L]) were stratified to 1 of 2 groups (diabetes or no
      diabetes). Patients were then randomized to receive either atorvastatin 10 mg/
      day (n = 730) or simvastatin 10 mg/day (n = 694). Efficacy was determined by
      measuring changes from baseline in lipid parameters including low-density
      lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and
      apolipoprotein B. Compared with simvastatin, atorvastatin produced significantly 
      greater (p < 0.0001) reductions from baseline in LDL cholesterol (37.2% vs
      29.6%), total cholesterol (27.6% vs 21.5%), triglycerides (22.1% vs 16.0%), the
      ratio of LDL cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (41.1% vs 
      33.7%), and apolipoprotein B (28.3% vs 21.2%), and a comparable increase from
      baseline in HDL cholesterol (7.4% vs 6.9%). Atorvastatin was also significantly
      (p < 0.0001) more effective than simvastatin at treating the overall patient
      population to LDL cholesterol goals (55.6% vs 38.4%). Fewer than 6% of patients
      in either treatment group experienced drug-attributable adverse events, which
      were mostly mild to moderate in nature. Diabetic patients treated with either
      statin had safety characteristics similar to nondiabetics, with atorvastatin
      exhibiting superior efficacy to simvastatin. In conclusion, atorvastatin, at a
      dose of 10 mg/day, is more effective than simvastatin 10 mg/day at lowering
      lipids and reaching LDL cholesterol goals in patients with mixed dyslipidemia.
      Both statins are well tolerated with safety profiles similar to other members of 
      the statin class.

TI  - Beneficial effects of pravastatin (+/-colestyramine/niacin) initiated immediately
      after a coronary event (the randomized Lipid-Coronary Artery Disease [L-CAD]
      Study).
PG  - 1293-8
AB  - Secondary prevention of coronary heart disease by antilipidemic therapy beginning
      at > or =3 months after an acute coronary syndrome is well documented. The
      impact, however, of immediate initiation of antilipidemic therapy on coronary
      stenoses and clinical outcome in patients with acute coronary syndrome is
      unknown. In our study, patients were randomized, on average, 6 days after an
      acute myocardial infarction and/or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty
      secondary to unstable angina, to pravastatin (combined, when necessary, with
      cholestyramine and/or nicotinic acid) to achieve low-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol levels of < or =130 mg/dl (group A, n = 70). In controls (group B, n 
      = 56), antilipidemic therapy was determined by family physicians. Quantitative
      coronary angiography was performed at inclusion, and at 6- and 24-month
      follow-up. The combined clinical end points were total mortality, cardiovascular 
      death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, need for coronary intervention, stroke,
      and new onset of peripheral vascular disease. Minimal lumen diameter in group A
      increased by 0.05 +/- 0.20 mm after 6 months and 0.13 +/- 0.29 mm after 24
      months, whereas it decreased by 0.08 +/- 0.20 mm and 0.18 +/- 0.27 mm,
      respectively, in group B (p = 0.004 at 6 months and p <0.001 at 24 months). After
      2 years, 29 patients of 56 patients in group B, but only 16 of 70 patients in
      group A, experienced a clinical end point (p = 0.005; odds ratio 0.28, confidence
      intervals 0.13 to 0.6). We conclude that pravastatin-based therapy initiated
      immediately after an acute coronary syndrome is well tolerated and safe, lessens 
      coronary atherosclerosis, and has a pronounced clinical benefit.

TI  - Colesevelam hydrochloride: a non-absorbed, polymeric cholesterol-lowering agent.
PG  - 2663-71
AB  - Colesevelam hydrochloride (formerly known as Cholestagel((R)) and re-named
      WelCholtrade mark, GelTex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Sankyo Parke-Davis) is a new,
      polymeric, high potency, water-absorbing hydrogel. It has been shown to be a safe
      and effective cholesterol-lowering agent with a non-systemic mechanism of action,
      good tolerability and minimal side effects. To date, the lipid-lowering activity 
      of colesevelam has been evaluated in approximately 1400 subjects. Colesevelam
      reduces low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels, in a dose-dependent
      manner, by as much as 20% (median) in patients with hypercholesterolaemia. Dosing
      regimen evaluations indicate that colesevelam is effective at both once per day
      and twice daily dosing and that concurrent administration of colesevelam with
      hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins),
      specifically lovastatin, does not alter the absorption of the statin. Combination
      therapy with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including lovastatin, simvastatin and 
      atorvastatin, produces an additional reduction (8 - 16%) in LDL-cholesterol
      levels above that seen with the statin alone. The overall incidence of adverse
      effects with colesevelam alone and in combination with statins is comparable with
      that seen with placebo. Colesevelam lacks the constipating effect seen with
      typical bile acid sequestrants, a trait that would be expected to improve
      compliance with lipid-lowering therapy. Colesevelam, recently approved by the US 
      FDA, represents a valuable non-absorbed alternative in the armamentarium against 
      hypercholesterolaemia, both for monotherapy and combination therapy, as an
      adjunct to diet and exercise.

TI  - HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors: assessing differences in drug interactions and
      safety profiles.
PG  - 637-44
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the cytochrome P450 system and associated metabolic
      differences between the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE
      search (1993-99) was conducted for English-language articles using key search
      terms including adverse drug reactions, cytochrome P450, drug metabolism, drug
      interactions, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, myopathy,
      and rhabdomyolysis. STUDY SELECTION: Review articles, clinical trials, and case
      reports concerning HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor metabolism, drug interactions, and
      adverse drug reactions were evaluated. DATA EXTRACTION: By the author. No
      software or assistants were used to extract information from the chosen studies. 
      DATA SYNTHESIS: The cytochrome P450 enzymes, which can be divided into families, 
      subfamilies, and isoenzymes, act as a major catalyst for drug oxidation in the
      liver. CYP3A4 is a major enzyme, accounting for about 60% of drug metabolic
      capacity in the liver and 70% of such function in the intestine. Lovastatin,
      simvastatin, and atorvastatin are substrates of CYP3A4, whereas fluvastatin is
      metabolized by CYP2C9. Pravastatin is not extensively metabolized by either of
      these isoenzymes; rather, it is transported into hepatocytes by a
      sodium-independent, carrier-mediated uptake system that normally transports bile 
      acids. Compared with other statins, pravastatin thus has a reduced potential for 
      drug interactions with other substrates, inhibitors, or inducers of the CYP3A4
      and CYP2C9 systems. CONCLUSION: Pharmacists must understand the functions of
      these enzymes to identify potential drug interactions, especially in high-risk
      patient populations, and to make appropriate therapeutic recommendations that
      prevent or minimize adverse clinical outcomes.

TI  - Long-term effects of cholesterol lowering and angiotensin-converting enzyme
      inhibition on coronary atherosclerosis: The Simvastatin/Enalapril Coronary
      Atherosclerosis Trial (SCAT).
PG  - 1748-54
AB  - BACKGROUND: This long-term, multicenter, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, 2 x 2 factorial, angiographic trial evaluated the effects of 
      cholesterol lowering and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on coronary
      atherosclerosis in normocholesterolemic patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: There were
      a total of 460 patients: 230 received simvastatin and 230, a simvastatin placebo,
      and 229 received enalapril and 231, an enalapril placebo (some subjects received 
      both drugs and some received a double placebo). Mean baseline measurements were
      as follows: cholesterol level, 5.20 mmol/L; triglyceride level, 1.82 mmol/L; HDL,
      0.99 mmol/L; and LDL, 3.36 mmol/L. Average follow-up was 47.8 months. Changes in 
      quantitative coronary angiographic measures between simvastatin and placebo,
      respectively, were as follows: mean diameters, -0.07 versus -0.14 mm (P:=0.004); 
      minimum diameters, -0.09 versus -0.16 mm (P:=0. 0001); and percent diameter
      stenosis, 1.67% versus 3.83% (P:=0.0003). These benefits were not observed in
      patients on enalapril when compared with placebo. No additional benefits were
      seen in the group receiving both drugs. Simvastatin patients had less need for
      percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (8 versus 21 events; P:=0.020),
      and fewer enalapril patients experienced the combined end point of
      death/myocardial infarction/stroke (16 versus 30; P:=0.043) than their respective
      placebo patients. CONCLUSIONS: This trial extends the observation of the
      beneficial angiographic effects of lipid-lowering therapy to normocholesterolemic
      patients. The implications of the neutral angiographic effects of
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition are uncertain, but they deserve further 
      investigation in light of the positive clinical benefits suggested here and seen 
      elsewhere.

TI  - Comparison of the efficacy and tolerability of simvastatin and atorvastatin in
      the treatment of hypercholesterolemia.
PG  - 682-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Simvastatin and atorvastatin are effective statins for treating
      hypercholesterolemia. HYPOTHESIS: The study was undertaken to compare the
      efficacy and tolerability of simvastatin 20 and 40 mg/day and atorvastatin 10 and
      20 mg/day. METHODS: In this multinational, open-label, crossover study, 258
      patients with primary hypercholesterolemia were randomized after 4 weeks of diet 
      plus placebo to once-daily administration of a starting dose sequence of
      simvastatin (20 mg) or atorvastatin (10 mg), or a higher dose sequence of
      simvastatin (40 mg) or atorvastatin (20 mg) for 6 weeks. Patients were then
      switched after a 1-week washout to the corresponding starting or higher dose of
      the alternate drug for a second 6-week period. The primary endpoint was the mean 
      percent change from baseline to Week 6 in low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
      cholesterol; percent changes from baseline in total cholesterol, high-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B were also compared. 
      Safety was assessed through adverse experiences and laboratory measurements.
      RESULTS: Both statins produced statistically significant improvements in all
      measured plasma lipids and lipoproteins. The main treatment comparison showed no 
      statistically significant difference in changes in LDL cholesterol and
      triglycerides, whereby the overall effects were comparable when doses of 20 mg
      and 40 mg of simvastatin were compared with atorvastatin 10 mg and 20 mg. The
      mean percent reductions for LDL cholesterol from baseline to Week 6 ranged from
      35-42% for the entire study cohort. An LDL cholesterol level < or = 130 mg/dl
      (3.4 mmol/l) was achieved in approximately 70% of patients treated with both
      drugs in this study. Simvastatin and atorvastatin were well tolerated at the
      doses studied. CONCLUSION: In patients with hypercholesterolemia, the most
      commonly used doses of simvastatin and atorvastatin produced similar changes in
      LDL cholesterol and achieved an LDL cholesterol level < or = 130 mg/dl (3.4
      mmol/l) in a similar number of patients. Both statins were well tolerated.

TI  - HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and myotoxicity.
PG  - 441-57
AB  - The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors
      specifically inhibit HMG-CoA reductase in the liver, thereby inhibiting the
      biosynthesis of cholesterol. These drugs significantly reduce plasma cholesterol 
      level and long term treatment reduces morbidity and mortality associated with
      coronary heart disease. The tolerability of these drugs during long term
      administration is an important issue. Adverse reactions involving skeletal muscle
      are not uncommon, and sometimes serious adverse reactions involving skeletal
      muscle such as myopathy and rhabdomyolysis may occur, requiring discontinuation
      of the drug. Occasionally, arthralgia, alone or in association with myalgia, has 
      been reported. In this article we review scientific data provided via Medline,
      adverse drug reaction case reports from the Swedish Drug Information System
      (SWEDIS) and the World Health Organization's International Drug Information
      System (INTDIS) database, focusing on HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor-related
      musculoskeletal system events. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 is the main isoenzyme
      involved in the metabolic transformation of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.
      Individuals with both low hepatic and low gastrointestinal tract levels of CYP3A4
      expression may be at in increased risk of myotoxicity due to potentially higher
      HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor plasma concentrations. The reported incidence of
      myotoxic reactions in patients treated with this drug class varies from 1 to 7%
      and varies between different agents. The risk of these serious adverse reactions 
      is dose-dependent and may increase when HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are
      prescribed concomitantly with drugs that inhibit their metabolism, such as
      itraconazole, cyclosporin, erythromycin and nefazodone. Electrolyte disturbances,
      infections, major trauma, hypoxia as well as drugs of abuse may increase the risk
      of myotoxicity. It is important that the potentially serious adverse reactions
      are recognised and correctly diagnosed so that the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor
      may at once be withdrawn to prevent further muscular damage.

TI  - Hyperlipidemia associated with HIV protease inhibitor use: pathophysiology,
      prevalence, risk factors and treatment.
PG  - 111-23
AB  - Despite potent antiretroviral activity, the HIV-1 protease inhibitors have
      recently been associated with abnormal serum lipoprotein concentrations. The
      purpose of this review is to describe serum lipid abnormalities related to
      protease inhibitor use. A MEDLINE search up to June 1, 1999, and abstracts from
      recent scientific meetings were primary data sources. Lipid disturbances in
      HIV-infected patients receiving protease inhibitors generally consist of elevated
      triglycerides and total cholesterol levels; HDL cholesterol is often reduced. The
      pathophysiological mechanism by which the protease inhibitors induce these lipid 
      abnormalities has been hypothesized, but is unknown. Cases of pancreatitis and
      coronary heart disease have been described in hyperlipidemic patients receiving
      protease inhibitors. Treatment of protease inhibitor-related hyperlipidemia is
      unknown. Exchanging the offending protease inhibitor for nevirapine may be
      helpful in certain patients. Atorvastatin in combination with gemfibrozil has
      been used with limited success in a small number of individuals.

TI  - Current perspectives on statins.
PG  - 207-13
AB  - Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) are used widely for the treatment of
      hypercholesterolemia. They inhibit HMG-CoA reductase competitively, reduce LDL
      levels more than other cholesterol-lowering drugs, and lower triglyceride levels 
      in hypertriglyceridemic patients. Statins are well tolerated and have an
      excellent safety record. Clinical trials in patients with and without coronary
      heart disease and with and without high cholesterol have demonstrated
      consistently that statins reduce the relative risk of major coronary events by
      approximately 30% and produce a greater absolute benefit in patients with higher 
      baseline risk. Proposed mechanisms include favorable effects on plasma
      lipoproteins, endothelial function, plaque architecture and stability,
      thrombosis, and inflammation. Mechanisms independent of LDL lowering may play an 
      important role in the clinical benefits conferred by these drugs and may
      ultimately broaden their indication from lipid-lowering to antiatherogenic
      agents.

TI  - Effect of statins on risk of coronary disease: a meta-analysis of randomized
      controlled trials.
PG  - 2340-6
AB  - CONTEXT: Lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is known to reduce 
      risk of recurrent coronary heart disease in middle-aged men. However, this effect
      has been uncertain in elderly people and women. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the risk
      reduction of coronary heart disease and total mortality associated with statin
      drug treatment, particularly in elderly individuals and women. DATA SOURCES:
      Trials published in English-language journals were retrieved by searching MEDLINE
      (1966-December 1998), bibliographies, and authors' reference files. STUDY
      SELECTION: Studies in which participants were randomized to statin or control
      treatment for at least 4 years and clinical disease or death was the primary
      outcome were included in the meta-analysis (5 of 182 initially identified). DATA 
      EXTRACTION: Information on sample size, study drug duration, type and dosage of
      statin drug, participant characteristics at baseline, reduction in lipids during 
      intervention, and outcomes was abstracted independently by 2 authors (J.H. and
      S.V.) using a standardized protocol. Disagreements were resolved by consensus.
      DATA SYNTHESIS: Data from the 5 trials, with 30 817 participants, were included
      in this meta-analysis. The mean duration of treatment was 5.4 years. Stati n drug
      treatment was associated with a20% reduction in total cholesterol, 28% reduction 
      in LDL-C, 13% reduction in triglycerides, and 5% increase in high-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol. Overall, statin drug treatment reduced risk 31 % in
      major coronary events (95% confidence interval [CI], 26%-36%) and 21 % in
      all-cause mortality (95% CI, 14%-28%). The risk reduction in major coronary
      events was similar between women (29%; 95% Cl, 13 %-42 %) and men (31 %; 95% CI, 
      26%-35%), and between persons aged at least 65 years (32%; 95% CI, 23%-39%) and
      persons younger than 65 years (31 %; 95% CI, 24%-36%). CONCLUSIONS: Our
      meta-analysis indicates that reduction in LDL-C associated with statin drug
      treatment decreases the risk of coronary heart disease and all-cause mortality.
      The risk reduction was similar for men and women and for elderly and middle-aged 
      persons.

TI  - Concomitant use of cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors and simvastatin.
PG  - 811-5
AB  - The long-term safety profile of simvastatin, established over 10 years of
      clinical use, is excellent. The principal adverse effect of all inhibitors of
      hydroxymethylglutarate co-enzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, myopathy, is infrequent. 
      Simvastatin is a substrate for cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). CYP3A4 inhibitors
      can elevate the plasma concentration of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity
      derived from simvastatin. Clinical experience has shown that concomitant use of
      potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 increase the risk for myopathy. Evaluation of data
      from clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance allows assessment of whether 
      concomitant use of weaker CYP3A4 inhibitors, as represented by calcium channel
      blockers, has any effect on the risk of myopathy. Cases of myopathy in long-term 
      clinical megatrials and in analyses of postmarketing adverse event reports have
      been surveyed. In megatrials with simvastatin, the overall incidence of myopathy 
      was 0.025%. The proportion of patients developing myopathy who were taking a
      calcium channel blocker with simvastatin (1 of 3) was similar to the proportion
      of patients taking a calcium channel blocker overall. Among marketed-use adverse 
      event reports, concomitant medication with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor was more
      frequent among reports of myopathy than among reports of nonmusculoskeletal
      adverse events. No excess use of calcium channel blockers among myopathy reports 
      was observed. We conclude that the overall risk of myopathy during treatment with
      simvastatin is very low. Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, especially cyclosporine,
      significantly increase the risk. There is no evidence that weaker CYP3A4
      inhibitors such as calcium channel blockers increase the risk.

      atherosclerosis PTCA trial (CLAPT).
PG  - 1393-406
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Cholesterol Lowering Atherosclerosis PTCA Trial (CLAPT) is a
      prospective, randomized trial with blinded angiographic end-points to assess the 
      effect of 2-year's treatment with lovastatin initiated 4 weeks prior to PTCA,
      compared to usual care on non-dilated coronary segments and on dilated coronary
      lesions in male patients with total cholesterol between 200 and 300 mg. dl(-1)who
      underwent elective PTCA. METHODS and RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty six patients
      were randomized 4 weeks prior to PTCA to special care (diet plus lovastatin
      n=112) or usual care (diet; n=114). One hundred and ninety-nine patients
      underwent PTCA at baseline and were finally included in the study. Quantitative
      coronary angiographic assessment was performed on blinded cinefilms at baseline
      (PTCA) and repeated after 4 and 24 months in 91% and 81% of the patients. The
      primary end-point was a change in the mean segment diameter of non-dilated
      segments. The mean lovastatin dose was 33 mg. day(-1). Total- and LDL-cholesterol
      decreased by 21% and 29% in the special care group and by 7% and 11% in the usual
      care patients. After 2 years, the mean segment diameter of non-dilated segments
      decreased by 0.03 mm in the usual care group and 0.004 mm in the special care
      group (P=0.27). The decrease in the mean segment diameter of dilated lesions was 
      0.17 mm (usual care) and 0.06 mm (special care) (P=0.04) after 4 months; 0.16 mm 
      (usual care) and 0. 002 mm (special care) after 24 months, respectively (P=0.05).
      In both groups, the mean segment diameter of dilated lesions increased between 4 
      and 24 months after PTCA compared to a decrease in mean segment diameter of
      non-dilated segments (P<0.05). Restenosis (>50% diameter stenosis at follow-up)
      occurred in 28.4% of usual care and 22.2% of special care patients (P=0.17).
      CONCLUSIONS: Lovastatin reduced the progression of dilated lesions in men with
      elective PTCA. Independent of treatment allocation, the dilated lesions regressed
      and the non-dilated segments progressed during the study follow-up. Four weeks of
      pre-treatment with lovastatin did not influence the rate of restenosis.
      Lovastatin had no statistically significant effect on non-dilated segments.

TI  - Safety of low-density lipoprotein cholestrol reduction with atorvastatin versus
      simvastatin in a coronary heart disease population (the TARGET TANGIBLE trial).
PG  - 7-13
AB  - Reduction in plasma lipids has been recognized as one of the primary
      cardiovascular risk reduction strategies in the secondary prevention of coronary 
      heart disease (CHD). The primary end points of TARGET TANGIBLE were the safety
      (adverse events and laboratory measurements) and efficacy (responder rates) of
      therapy with atorvastatin versus simvastatin with the aim of achieving
      low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol lowering to < or =100 mg/dl (2.6
      mmol/L). A total of 3,748 CHD patients with LDL cholesterol levels > or =130
      mg/dl (3.4 mmol/L) entered a run-in diet phase of 6 weeks without any
      lipid-lowering drug therapy. At the end of the diet phase, 2,856 patients met the
      lipid criteria and were randomized to active treatment for 14 weeks. Patients
      received 10 to 40 mg of either drug in an optional titration design at 2:1
      randomization for atorvastatin versus simvastatin. Adverse event rates were
      statistically equivalent (p<0.01) for simvastatin (35.7%) and for atorvastatin
      patients (36.3%). Both drugs were well tolerated; <5% of patients in both groups 
      were withdrawn due to adverse events. In all, 37 atorvastatin patients (2%) and
      27 simvastatin patients (3%) had serious adverse events. Drug-related side
      effects (elevations in creatine kinase, liver enzymes) occurred in both groups at
      similar rates with 10 atorvastatin patients (0.5%) and 5 simvastatin patients
      (0.5%) presenting confirmed transaminase elevations >3 x the upper limit of the
      normal range. Significantly fewer patients in the atorvastatin group (n = 724)
      required titration to 40 mg compared with the simvastatin group (n = 514) (38%
      vs. 54%, respectively; p<0.001). Atorvastatin resulted in a significantly greater
      number of patients reaching the LDL cholesterol goal than those treated with
      simvastatin, with 67% of atorvastatin patients and 53% of simvastatin patients
      reaching the target LDL cholesterol level of < or =100 mg/dl (2.6 mmol/L)
      (p<0.001). Both atorvastatin and simvastatin are safe for use by patients in the 
      secondary prevention of CHD, with patients in both drug groups having similar
      adverse event rates. Despite the use of concomitant medications there was no
      drug-induced rhabdomyolysis with either atorvastatin or simvastatin.

TI  - Pravastatin prevents clinical events in revascularized patients with average
      cholesterol concentrations. Cholesterol and Recurrent Events CARE Investigators.
PG  - 106-12
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This analysis was carried out to determine if revascularized patients
      derive benefit from the 3-hydroxy-3 methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase
      inhibitor pravastatin. BACKGROUND: The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors result in
      substantial reductions in serum cholesterol and stabilization of atherosclerotic 
      plaques in patients with coronary artery disease. METHODS: Pravastatin was found 
      to reduce clinical cardiovascular events in the Cholesterol and Recurrent Events 
      (CARE) trial consisting of 4,159 patients with a documented myocardial infarction
      and an average cholesterol level (mean 209 mg/dl and all <240 mg/dl). A total of 
      2,245 patients underwent coronary revascularization before randomization
      including 1,154 patients with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty
      (PTCA) alone, 876 patients with coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) alone, and
      215 patients with both procedures. Clinical events in revascularized patients
      were compared between patients on placebo and on pravastatin. RESULTS: In the
      2,245 patients who had undergone revascularization, the primary endpoint of
      coronary heart disease death or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) was reduced
      by 4.1% with pravastatin (relative risk [RR] reduction 36%, 95% confidence
      interval [CI] 17 to 51, p = 0.001). Fatal or nonfatal MI was reduced by 3.3% (RR 
      reduction 39%, 95% CI 16 to 55, p = 0.002), postrandomization repeat
      revascularization was reduced by 2.6% (RR reduction 18%, 95% CI 1 to 33, p =
      0.068) and stroke was reduced by 1.5% (RR reduction 39%, 95% CI 3 to 62, p =
      0.037) with pravastatin. Pravastatin was beneficial in both the 1,154 PTCA
      patients and in the 1,091 CABG patients who had undergone revascularization
      before randomization. CONCLUSIONS: Pravastatin reduced clinical events in
      revascularized postinfarction patients with average cholesterol levels. This
      therapy was well tolerated and its use should be considered in most patients
      following coronary revascularization.

TI  - Aggressive lipid-lowering therapy compared with angioplasty in stable coronary
      artery disease. Atorvastatin versus Revascularization Treatment Investigators.
PG  - 70-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Percutaneous coronary revascularization is widely used in improving
      symptoms and exercise performance in patients with ischemic heart disease and
      stable angina pectoris. In this study, we compared percutaneous coronary
      revascularization with lipid-lowering treatment for reducing the incidence of
      ischemic events. METHODS: We studied 341 patients with stable coronary artery
      disease, relatively normal left ventricular function, asymptomatic or
      mild-to-moderate angina, and a serum level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
      cholesterol of at least 115 mg per deciliter (3.0 mmol per liter) who were
      referred for percutaneous revascularization. We randomly assigned the patients
      either to receive medical treatment with atorvastatin, at 80 mg per day (164
      patients), or to undergo the recommended percutaneous revascularization procedure
      (angioplasty) followed by usual care, which could include lipid-lowering
      treatment (177 patients). The follow-up period was 18 months. RESULTS: Twenty-two
      (13 percent) of the patients who received aggressive lipid-lowering treatment
      with atorvastatin (resulting in a 46 percent reduction in the mean serum LDL
      cholesterol level, to 77 mg per deciliter [2.0 mmol per liter]) had ischemic
      events, as compared with 37 (21 percent) of the patients who underwent
      angioplasty (who had an 18 percent reduction in the mean serum LDL cholesterol
      level, to 119 mg per deciliter [3.0 mmol per liter]). The incidence of ischemic
      events was thus 36 percent lower in the atorvastatin group over an 18-month
      period (P=0.048, which was not statistically significant after adjustment for
      interim analyses). This reduction in events was due to a smaller number of
      angioplasty procedures, coronary-artery bypass operations, and hospitalizations
      for worsening angina. As compared with the patients who were treated with
      angioplasty and usual care, the patients who received atorvastatin had a
      significantly longer time to the first ischemic event (P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: In
      low-risk patients with stable coronary artery disease, aggressive lipid-lowering 
      therapy is at least as effective as angioplasty and usual care in reducing the
      incidence of ischemic events.

TI  - The effect of fluvastatin on cardiac events in patients with symptomatic coronary
      artery disease during one year of treatment.
PG  - 263-70
AB  - The primary objective of the present study was to investigate the
      cholesterol-lowering effect of fluvastatin on the incidence of cardiac events in 
      hyperlipidaemic patients with symptomatic, clinically-diagnosed (exercise-ECG)
      coronary heart disease (CHD) during 1 year of treatment. Exercise tolerance,
      incidence of angina pectoris episodes, use of anti-anginal medication and
      intimal-medial-thickness (IMT subgroup) of the A. carotis were secondary
      endpoints. In the double-blind trial a total of 365 male and female patients with
      stable symptomatic CHD and a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) above
      160 mg/dl on a lipid-lowering diet were randomised to fluvastatin 40 mg (o.a.d.
      or b.i.d.) or placebo for 1 year. Fluvastatin lowered total cholesterol by 17%
      and LDL-C by 27%. There was a significantly lower incidence of cardiac events
      (cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris) in the 
      fluvastatin group (3 events) as compared to the placebo group (10 events) (P <
      0.05). Exercise tolerance improved and the incidence of angina pectoris episodes 
      decreased in both groups, but more pronounced on fluvastatin (n.s.). Exercise-ECG
      discontinuation due to angina pectoris and ST-segment depression decreased in the
      fluvastatin group by 55.6 and 70.9%, respectively, and in the placebo group by
      39.6 and 46.5% (n.s.). At baseline, a subgroup of 76 patients showed a mean IMT
      value of 0.73 mm which remained uninfluenced in the fluvastatin and the placebo
      groups. Fluvastatin was safe and well tolerated. In conclusion, patients with
      symptomatic CHD get cardiovascular benefit from lipid-lowering therapy with
      fluvastatin even during the first year of treatment.

      and triglycerides to a comparable degree, but simvastatin raised high-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I more than atorvastatin, suggesting
      differences in metabolic effects of the 2 agents on plasma lipids and
      lipoproteins.

TI  - MRC/BHF Heart Protection Study of cholesterol-lowering therapy and of antioxidant
      vitamin supplementation in a wide range of patients at increased risk of coronary
      heart disease death: early safety and efficacy experience.
PG  - 725-41
AB  - AIMS: In observational studies, prolonged lower blood total cholesterol levels - 
      down at least to 3 mmol. l-1 - are associated with lower risks of coronary heart 
      disease. Cholesterol-lowering therapy may, therefore, be worthwhile for
      individuals at high risk of coronary heart disease events irrespective of their
      presenting cholesterol levels. Observational studies also suggest that increased 
      dietary intake of antioxidant vitamins may be associated with lower risks of
      coronary heart disease. The present randomized trial aims to assess reliably the 
      effects on mortality and major morbidity of cholesterol-lowering therapy and of
      antioxidant vitamin supplementation in a wide range of different categories of
      high-risk patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Men and women aged 40 to 80 years were
      eligible provided they were considered to be at elevated risk of coronary heart
      disease death because of past history of myocardial infarction or other coronary 
      heart disease, occlusive disease of non-coronary arteries, diabetes mellitus or
      treated hypertension; had baseline blood total cholesterol of 3.5 mmol. l-1 or
      greater; and no clear indications for, or contraindications to, either of the
      study treatments. Eligible patients who completed a pre-randomization run-in
      phase on active treatment were randomly allocated to receive simvastatin (40 mg
      daily) or matching placebo tablets and, in a '2x2 factorial' design, antioxidant 
      vitamins (600 mg vitamin E, 250 mg vitamin C and 20 mg beta-carotene daily) or
      matching placebo capsules. Follow-up visits after randomization are scheduled at 
      4, 8 and 12 months, and then 6-monthly, for at least 5 years. Between July 1994
      and May 1997, 15 454 men and 5082 women were randomized, with 9515 aged over 65
      years at entry. Diagnostic criteria overlapped, with 8510 (41%) having had
      myocardial infarction (most of whom were either female, or elderly or with low
      blood cholesterol), 4869 (24%) some other history of coronary heart disease, 3288
      (16%) cerebrovascular disease, 6748 (33%) peripheral vascular disease, 5963 (29%)
      diabetes mellitus (of whom 3985 had no history of coronary heart disease) and
      8455 (41%) treated hypertension. Baseline non-fasting total cholesterol levels
      were less than 5.5 mmol. l-1 in 7882 (38%) participants, and LDL (low density
      lipoprotein) cholesterol less than 3.0 mmol. l-1 in 6888 (34%). During a mean
      follow-up of 25 months (range: 13 to 47 months), no significant differences had
      been observed between the treatment groups in the numbers of patients with muscle
      symptoms, other possible side-effects leading to termination of study treatment, 
      or elevated liver and muscle enzymes. After 30 months of follow-up, 81% of
      randomized patients remained compliant with taking their study simvastatin or
      placebo tablets, and allocation to simvastatin produced average reductions in
      non-fasting blood total and LDL cholesterol of about 1.5-1.6 mmol. l-1 and
      1.1-1.2 mmol. l-1 respectively. Eighty-seven per cent of patients remained
      compliant with taking their vitamin or placebo capsules, and allocation to the
      vitamin supplement produced an average increase in plasma vitamin E levels of
      about 24 micromol. l-1. Based on this initial follow-up period, the estimated
      annual rate of non-fatal myocardial infarction or fatal coronary heart disease is
      2.4%, annual stroke rate is 1.3%, and annual all-cause mortality rate is 2. 2%.
      CONCLUSION: The Heart Protection Study is large, it has included a wide range of 
      patients at high risk of vascular events, and the treatment regimens being
      studied are well-tolerated and produce substantial effects on blood lipid and
      vitamin levels. The study should, therefore, provide reliable evidence about the 
      effects of cholesterol-lowering therapy and of antioxidant vitamin supplements on
      all-cause or cause-specific mortality and major morbidity in a range of different
      categories of individuals for whom uncertainty remains about the balance of
      benefits and risks of these treatments. Copyrig

TI  - A randomized placebo-controlled trial of fluvastatin for prevention of restenosis
      after successful coronary balloon angioplasty; final results of the fluvastatin
      angiographic restenosis (FLARE) trial.
PG  - 58-69
AB  - BACKGROUND: The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase
      inhibitors competitively inhibit biosynthesis of mevalonate, a precursor of
      non-sterol compounds involved in cell proliferation. Experimental evidence
      suggests that fluvastatin may, independent of any lipid lowering action, exert a 
      greater direct inhibitory effect on proliferating vascular myocytes than other
      statins. The FLARE (Fluvastatin Angioplasty Restenosis) Trial was conceived to
      evaluate the ability of fluvastatin 40 mg twice daily to reduce restenosis after 
      successful coronary balloon angioplasty (PTCA). METHODS: Patients were randomized
      to either placebo or fluvastatin 40 mg twice daily beginning 2-4 weeks prior to
      planned PTCA and continuing after a successful PTCA (without the use of a stent),
      to follow-up angiography at 26+/-2 weeks. Clinical follow-up was completed at 40 
      weeks. The primary end-point was angiographic restenosis, measured by
      quantitative coronary angiography at a core laboratory, as the loss in minimal
      luminal diameter during follow-up. Clinical end-points were death, myocardial
      infarction, coronary artery bypass graft surgery or re-intervention, up to 40
      weeks after PTCA. RESULTS: Of 1054 patients randomized, 526 were allocated to
      fluvastatin and 528 to placebo. Among these, 409 in the fluvastatin group and 427
      in the placebo group were included in the intention-to-treat analysis, having
      undergone a successful PTCA after a minimum of 2 weeks of pre-treatment. At the
      time of PTCA, fluvastatin had reduced LDL cholesterol by 37% and this was
      maintained at 33% at 26 weeks. There was no difference in the primary end-point
      between the treatment groups (fluvastatin 0.23+/-0.49 mm vs placebo 0.23+/-0.52
      mm, P=0.95) or in the angiographic restenosis rate (fluvastatin 28%, placebo 31%,
      chi-square P=0.42), or in the incidence of the composite clinical end-point at 40
      weeks (22.4% vs 23.3%; logrank P=0.74). However, a significantly lower incidence 
      of total death and myocardial infarction was observed in six patients (1.4%) in
      the fluvastatin group and 17 (4.0%) in the placebo group (log rank P=0.025).
      CONCLUSION: Treatment with fluvastatin 80 mg daily did not affect the process of 
      restenosis and is therefore not indicated for this purpose. However, the observed
      reduction in mortality and myocardial infarction 40 weeks after PTCA in the
      fluvastatin treated group has not been previously reported with statin therapy.
      Accordingly, a priori investigation of this finding is indicated and a new
      clinical trial with this intention is already underway.

TI  - Comparative efficacy and tolerability of low-dose pravastatin versus lovastatin
      in patients with hypercholesterolemia.
PG  - 458-62
AB  - BACKGROUND: The HMG CoA reductase inhibitors have quickly become the most widely 
      prescribed family of agents for the treatment of patients with elevated
      low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. The incidence of side effects with
      these agents increases as the dose increases within the recommended dosage range.
      A lower dosage presumably would have a lower incidence of adverse effects. In
      addition, lower doses should translate into reduced drug costs. METHODS AND
      RESULTS: We compared the efficacy of 10 mg of pravastatin and 10 mg of lovastatin
      in a randomized, crossover design trial among 30 patients with
      hypercholesterolemia. At baseline, their total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol
      levels were 249.0 +/- 27.3 and 185.1 +/- 25.5 mg/dL. After 4 weeks of treatment
      with lovastatin, the total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels fell to 202.8
      +/- 29.6 and 141.0 +/- 25.3 mg/dL, decreases of 19% and 24%, respectively. Four
      weeks of pravastatin treatment resulted in levels of 212.6 +/- 30.8 and 150.5 +/-
      25.5 mg/dL, or 15% and 19%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: There were highly
      significant changes in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels with each
      agent and no differences in effect between the 2 agents. In 13 (43%) of the 30
      patients, LDL levels were reduced to </=130 mg/dL with one of the agents. Both
      agents were generally well tolerated, with no clinically important change in
      liver function tests or creatinine kinase levels.

TI  - Treating to meet NCEP-recommended LDL cholesterol concentrations with
      atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, or simvastatin in patients with risk
      factors for coronary heart disease.
PG  - 349-56
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our study compared use of atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, and 
      simvastatin for lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration 
      in patients at risk for coronary heart disease (CHD). The goal was to reach the
      LDL cholesterol levels recommended by the National Cholesterol Education Program 
      (NCEP). METHODS: A combined total of 344 men and women took part in this 54-week,
      multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel-group, active-controlled,
      treat-to-target study. Patients were selected on the basis of their LDL
      cholesterol concentration and their risk for CHD. During treatment, doses were
      titrated at 12-week intervals to a maximum of 80 mg per day of atorvastatin and
      lovastatin, or 40 mg per day of fluvastatin and simvastatin, with colestipol
      added if necessary to attain the NCEP-recommended LDL cholesterol concentration. 
      RESULTS: At the starting dose, atorvastatin decreased plasma LDL cholesterol
      significantly (P < .05) compared with the other reductase inhibitors, and the
      percentage of patients reaching target LDL cholesterol concentration at the
      starting dose was significantly greater in the atorvastatin group (P < .05).
      Overall, a significantly (P < .05) greater percentage (95%) of
      atorvastatin-treated patients achieved target LDL cholesterol concentration. The 
      safety profile was similar among all reductase inhibitors tested. CONCLUSIONS: At
      the starting dose, a significantly (P < .05) greater percentage of
      atorvastatin-treated patients at risk for CHD reached the target LDL cholesterol 
      concentration than patients with treated with other reductase inhibitors.

TI  - Drug interactions of lipid-altering drugs.
PG  - 355-71
AB  - The use of lipid-altering drugs has been shown to reduce the progression of
      atherosclerotic lesions and reduce the risk of atherosclerotic events (such as
      myocardial infarction and stroke). In general, these lipid-altering drugs are
      well tolerated but there is the potential for drug interactions. For example,
      HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may interact with macrolides, azalides, azole
      antifungals and cyclosporin. Resins (such as cholestyramine and colestipol) may
      impair the absorption of many concurrent medications. Fibrates have potential
      drug interactions with warfarin, furosemide (frusemide), oral hypoglycaemics and 
      probenecid. Nicotinic acid (niacin) may have potential drug interactions with
      high dose aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), uricosuric agents (such as
      sulfapyrazone) and alcohol (ethanol). Finally, probucol may have potential drug
      interactions with antidysrhythmics, tricyclic antidepressants and phenothiazines.
      In addition, lipid-altering drugs, used in combination, may have the potential
      for drug interactions, enhancing some of the risks of adverse effects, such as
      myositis and hepatotoxicity. Therefore, in order to use lipid-altering drugs in
      the most effective, and safest manner, it is important for the clinician to have 
      an understanding of the mechanisms of potential drug interactions, which drug
      interactions may theoretically occur, and specifically, which spe cific drug
      interactions have already been described.

TI  - Metabolism and drug interactions of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A
      reductase inhibitors in transplant patients: are the statins mechanistically
      similar?
PG  - 1-34
AB  - 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (EC 1.1.1.88) inhibitors are the 
      most effective drugs to lower cholesterol in transplant patients. However,
      immunosuppressants and several other drugs used after organ transplantation are
      cytochrome P4503A (CYP3A, EC 1.14.14.1) substrates. Pharmacokinetic interaction
      with some of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors,
      specifically lovastatin and simvastatin, leads to an increased incidence of
      muscle skeletal toxicity in transplant patients. It is our objective to review
      the role of drug metabolism and drug interactions of lovastatin, simvastatin,
      pravastatin, fluvastatin, atorvastatin, and cerivastatin. In the treatment of
      transplant patients, from a drug interaction perspective, pravastatin, which is
      not significantly metabolized by CYP enzymes, and fluvastatin, presumably a
      CYP2C9 substrate, compare favorably with the other statins for which the major
      metabolic pathways are catalyzed by CYP3A.

TI  - Treating patients with documented atherosclerosis to National Cholesterol
      Education Program-recommended low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol goals with
      atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin and simvastatin.
PG  - 665-72
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study compared the efficacy and safety of atorvastatin,
      fluvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin in patients with documented
      atherosclerosis treated to U.S. National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP)
      recommended low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration (< or = 100
      mg/dl [2.59 mmol/liter]). BACKGROUND: For patients with advanced atherosclerosis,
      NCEP recommends lipid-lowering drug therapy if LDL cholesterol remains > or = 130
      mg/dl (3.36 mmol/liter). METHODS: A total of 318 men or women with documented
      atherosclerosis and LDL cholesterol > or = 130 mg/dl (3.36 mmol/liter) and < or =
      250 mg/dl (6.5 mmol/liter), and triglycerides < or = 400 mg/dl (4.5 mmol/liter)
      participated in this 54-week, multicenter, open-label, randomized,
      parallel-group, active-controlled, treat-to-target study. Patients were titrated 
      at 12-week intervals until the LDL cholesterol goal was reached. Number of
      patients reaching target LDL cholesterol levels and dose to reach target were
      evaluated. RESULTS: At the starting doses, atorvastatin 10 mg produced
      significantly greater decreases (p < 0.05) in plasma LDL cholesterol than the
      other treatments. Subsequently, the percentage of patients reaching goal at the
      starting dose was 32% for atorvastatin, 1% for fluvastatin, 10% for lovastatin
      and 22% for simvastatin. Atorvastatin-treated patients required a lower median
      dose than other treatments. Median doses at week 54 with the last available visit
      carried forward were atorvastatin 20 mg/day, fluvastatin 40 mg/day + colestipol
      20 g/day, lovastatin 80 mg/day, simvastatin 40 mg/day. CONCLUSIONS: A
      significantly greater number (p < 0.05) of patients with confirmed
      atherosclerosis treated with atorvastatin reached the target LDL cholesterol
      concentration at the starting dose than patients treated with fluvastatin or
      lovastatin, and significantly fewer (p < 0.05) patients treated with atorvastatin
      required combination therapy with colestipol to achieve target LDL cholesterol
      concentrations than all other statins tested.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of a new cholesterol synthesis inhibitor, atorvastatin, in
      comparison with simvastatin and pravastatin, in subjects with
      hypercholesterolemia.
PG  - 131-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: High levels of total and LDL-cholesterol are associated with an
      increased risk of atherosclerotic vascular disease. Lowering of serum cholesterol
      levels by pharmacologic intervention with inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis,
      the so-called statins, reduces the incidence of cardiovascular events in subjects
      with and without atherosclerotic manifestations. In a 16-week, multicenter,
      randomized, open-label cross-over study we compared the efficacy and safety of
      the new compound atorvastatin for reducing LDL-cholesterol with simvastatin or
      pravastatin. METHODS: Following a 4-week placebo-controlled baseline period
      patients with LDL-cholesterol between 4.1 and 6.2 mmol/l and serum triglycerides 
      below 3.4 mmol/l were randomly assigned to treatment either with 5 or 20 mg
      atorvastatin, or with 10 mg simvastatin or 20 mg pravastatin once daily for 4
      weeks. After a placebo-washout period of 4-6 weeks, patients switched to the
      alternate treatment. At the end of weeks 3 and 4 of each study phase the serum
      concentrations of lipid parameters and apolipoproteins as well as safety
      parameters were determined. RESULTS: A total of 78 subjects entered the study.
      Treatment with 5 mg atorvastatin reduced total and LDL-cholesterol by 21 and 27%,
      respectively, which was similar to 10 mg simvastatin (total cholesterol -20%,
      LDL-cholesterol -28%) and 20 mg pravastatin (-18 and -24%, respectively). The
      effects of this low dose of atorvastatin on triglyceride levels (-16%) was not
      different from that of simvastatin and pravastatin (-8 and -11%, respectively).
      Treatment with 20 mg atorvastatin caused significantly larger reductions in total
      cholesterol (-33%) and LDL-cholesterol (-44%), serum triglycerides (-23%), and
      apo B (-40%) compared to simvastatin and pravastatin. Atorvastatin was
      well-tolerated, and no serious or medically important adverse events were
      observed. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that atorvastatin is a safe and very
      efficacious cholesterol-lowering agent, which also possesses significant
      triglyceride-lowering properties.

TI  - Simvastatin compared to fluvastatin in the reduction of serum lipids and
      apolipoproteins in patients with ischaemic heart disease and moderate
      hypercholesterolaemia.
PG  - 7-14
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase are widely used for the treatment of
      hypercholesterolaemia and have recently been shown in the Scandinavian
      Simvastatin Survival Study (4S), to reduce coronary mortality as well as total
      mortality in CH D patients. Although a couple of studies have already established
      the efficacy ratio between simvastatin and fluvastatin, one of the newest members
      of this class, we considered it to be important to verify the comparative
      efficacy in patients with coronary artery disease in the same type of patients
      that were included in 4S particularly since the previous studies include rather
      few patients with CHD, 17-28% only. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three Scandinavian lipid
      clinics participated in this randomized double-blind study and enrolled a total
      of 113 hypercholesterolaemic patients with a profile similar to the 4S patients, 
      i.e. either a history of typical angina pectoris lasting at least three months or
      a myocardial infarction at least six months before the study and with moderate
      hypercholesterolaemia, total serum cholesterol between 5.5 and 8.0 mmol/l. After 
      a diet run-in period lasting at least 8 weeks, followed by a two week placebo
      period, patients received treatment with active drug for a 16 week period, with
      measurement of lipids using the same technique and laboratory as was used in 4S. 
      Patients were randomly assigned to simvastatin 20 mg or fluvastatin 20 mg. If
      after 6 weeks of double-blind treatment, the 4S total cholesterol target of < or 
      = 5.2 mmol/l total serum cholesterol had not been reached, the dose was doubled
      at the next visit, i.e. at week 10 based upon blinded titration information from 
      the central lipid laboratory like in the 4S study. A final assessment of serum
      lipids and lipoproteins was made at week 16. The mean percent reductions in
      LDL-cholesterol from baseline were 37% and 40% in the simvastatin group compared 
      to 19% and 26% in the fluvastatin group, at weeks 10 and 16, respectively (p <
      0.001). In the simvastatin group 18 percent of the patients needed an increase in
      the dose to 40 mg compared to 63 percent in the fluvastatin group (p < 0.001). At
      the 20 mg dosage, simvastatin produced a lowering of LDL-cholesterol
      approximately twice that of fluvastatin 20 mg and resulted in 82% of patients
      achieving the cholesterol target levels as defined in the 4S study, compared to
      19% for fluvastatin. All other recorded lipid variables showed differences which 
      favoured simvastatin over fluvastatin at comparable doses including serum
      triglyceride reductions where serum triglycerides at week 6 were borderline
      significantly different between the two groups. Patient tolerability of the two
      drugs was similar. CONCLUSION: At the recommended doses in patient with angina or
      a prior MI and mild to moderate hypercholesterolaemia simvastatin is considerably
      more effective than fluvastatin in lowering serum total cholesterol,
      LDL-cholesterol as well as other serum lipid risk factors. At an average titrated
      dose of 32 mg less than 50% of the fluvastatin patients reached the 4S
      cholesterol target of < 5.2 mmol/l compared to 89% of the simvastatin patients at
      an average dose of 23 mg daily and only 13% of the fluvastatin patients achieved 
      an LDL-cholesterol reduction of at least 40% compared to 63% of the simvastatin
      patients.

TI  - Primary prevention of acute coronary events with lovastatin in men and women with
      average cholesterol levels: results of AFCAPS/TexCAPS. Air Force/Texas Coronary
      Atherosclerosis Prevention Study.
PG  - 1615-22
AB  - CONTEXT: Although cholesterol-reducing treatment has been shown to reduce fatal
      and nonfatal coronary disease in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), it
      is unknown whether benefit from the reduction of low-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol (LDL-C) in patients without CHD extends to individuals with average
      serum cholesterol levels, women, and older persons. OBJECTIVE: To compare
      lovastatin with placebo for prevention of the first acute major coronary event in
      men and women without clinically evident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease
      with average total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-C levels and below-average
      high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. DESIGN: A randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Outpatient clinics in Texas.
      PARTICIPANTS: A total of 5608 men and 997 women with average TC and LDL-C and
      below-average HDL-C (as characterized by lipid percentiles for an age- and
      sex-matched cohort without cardiovascular disease from the National Health and
      Nutrition Examination Survey [NHANES] III). Mean (SD) TC level was 5.71 (0.54)
      mmol/L (221 [21] mg/dL) (51 st percentile), mean (SD) LDL-C level was 3.89 (0.43)
      mmol/L (150 [17] mg/dL) (60th percentile), mean (SD) HDL-C level was 0.94 (0.14) 
      mmol/L (36 [5] mg/dL) for men and 1.03 (0.14) mmol/L (40 [5] mg/dL) for women
      (25th and 16th percentiles, respectively), and median (SD) triglyceride levels
      were 1.78 (0.86) mmol/L (158 [76] mg/dL) (63rd percentile). INTERVENTION:
      Lovastatin (20-40 mg daily) or placebo in addition to a low-saturated fat,
      low-cholesterol diet. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: First acute major coronary event
      defined as fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or sudden
      cardiac death. RESULTS: After an average follow-up of 5.2 years, lovastatin
      reduced the incidence of first acute major coronary events (1 83 vs 116 first
      events; relative risk [RR], 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50-0.79;
      P<.001), myocardial infarction (95 vs 57 myocardial infarctions; RR, 0.60; 95%
      CI, 0.43-0.83; P=.002), unstable angina (87 vs 60 first unstable angina events;
      RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.49-0.95; P=.02), coronary revascularization procedures (157
      vs 106 procedures; RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52-0.85; P=.001), coronary events (215 vs 
      163 coronary events; RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.61-0.92; P =.006), and cardiovascular
      events (255 vs 194 cardiovascular events; RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.62-0.91; P = .003).
      Lovastatin (20-40 mg daily) reduced LDL-C by 25% to 2.96 mmol/L (115 mg/dL) and
      increased HDL-C by 6% to 1.02 mmol/L (39 mg/dL). There were no clinically
      relevant differences in safety parameters between treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Lovastatin reduces the risk for the first acute major coronary event in men and
      women with average TC and LDL-C levels and below-average HDL-C levels. These
      findings support the inclusion of HDL-C in risk-factor assessment, confirm the
      benefit of LDL-C reduction to a target goal, and suggest the need for
      reassessment of the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines regarding
      pharmacological intervention.

      study)
PG  - 582-7
AB  - The objective of this multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, 8-week
      study was to evaluate the comparative dose efficacy of the
      3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor atorvastatin 
      10, 20, 40, and 80 mg compared with simvastatin 10, 20, and 40 mg, pravastatin
      10, 20, and 40 mg, lovastatin 20, 40, and 80 mg, and fluvastatin 20 and 40 mg.
      Investigators enrolled 534 hypercholesterolemic patients (low-density lipoprotein
      [LDL] cholesterol > or = 160 mg/dl [4.2 mmol/L] and triglycerides < or = 400
      mg/dl [4.5 mmol/L]). The efficacy end points were mean percent change in plasma
      LDL cholesterol (primary), total cholesterol, triglycerides, and high-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations from baseline to the end of treatment
      (week 8). Atorvastatin 10, 20, and 40 mg produced greater (p < or = 0.01)
      reductions in LDL cholesterol, -38%, -46%, and -51%, respectively, than the
      milligram equivalent doses of simvastatin, pravastatin, lovastatin, and
      fluvastatin. Atorvastatin 10 mg produced LDL cholesterol reductions comparable to
      or greater than (p < or = 0.02) simvastatin 10, 20, and 40 mg, pravastatin 10,
      20, and 40 mg, lovastatin 20 and 40 mg, and fluvastatin 20 and 40 mg.
      Atorvastatin 10, 20, and 40 mg produced greater (p < or = 0.01) reductions in
      total cholesterol than the milligram equivalent doses of simvastatin,
      pravastatin, lovastatin, and fluvastatin. All reductase inhibitors studied had
      similar tolerability. There were no incidences of persistent elevations in serum 
      transaminases or myositis.

TI  - Effect of pravastatin on angiographic restenosis after coronary balloon
      angioplasty. The PREDICT Trial Investigators. Prevention of Restenosis by Elisor 
      after Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty.
PG  - 863-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine whether pravastatin affects clinical
      or angiographic restenosis after coronary balloon angioplasty. BACKGROUND:
      Experimental data and preliminary clinical studies suggest that lipid-lowering
      drugs might have a beneficial effect on restenosis after coronary angioplasty.
      METHODS: In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial, 695 patients were
      randomized to receive pravastatin (40 mg/day) or placebo for 6 months after
      successful balloon angioplasty. All patients received aspirin (100 mg/day). The
      primary angiographic end point was minimal lumen diameter (MLD) at follow-up,
      assessed by quantitative coronary angiography. A sample size of 313 patients per 
      group was required to demonstrate a difference of 0.13 mm in MLD between groups
      (allowing for a two-tailed alpha error of 0.05 and a beta error of 0.20). To
      allow for incomplete angiographic follow-up (estimated lost to follow-up rate of 
      10%), 690 randomized patients were required. Secondary end points were
      angiographic restenosis rate (restenosis assessed as a categoric variable, > 50% 
      stenosis) and clinical events (death, myocardial infarction, target vessel
      revascularization). RESULTS: At baseline, clinical, demographic, angiographic and
      lipid variables did not differ significantly between groups. In patients treated 
      with pravastatin, there was a significant reduction in total and low density
      lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels and a significant increase in
      high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. At follow-up the MLD (mean +/- SD)
      was 1.47 +/- 0.62 mm in the placebo group and 1.54 +/- 0.66 mm in the pravastatin
      group (p = 0.21). Similarly, late loss and net gain did not differ significantly 
      between groups. The restenosis rate (recurrence > 50% stenosis) was 43.8% in the 
      placebo group and 39.2% in the pravastatin group (p = 0.26). Clinical restenosis 
      did not differ significantly between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Although pravastatin
      has documented efficacy in reducing clinical events and angiographic disease
      progression in patients with coronary atherosclerosis, this study shows that it
      has no effect on angiographic outcome at the target site 6 months after coronary 
      angioplasty.

TI  - Effects of fluvastatin on coronary atherosclerosis in patients with mild to

      [LCAS]).
PG  - 278-86
AB  - Despite the potential for reduced morbidity and mortality, aggressive
      intervention against mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia in patients with
      coronary heart disease (CHD) remains controversial and infrequently practiced.
      Eligible patients in the 2.5-year Lipoprotein and Coronary Atherosclerosis Study 
      were men and women aged 35 to 75 years with angiographic CHD and mean low-density
      lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol of 115 to 190 mg/dl despite diet. Patients (n =
      429; 19% women) were randomized to fluvastatin 20 mg twice daily or placebo. One 
      fourth of patients were also assigned open-label adjunctive cholestyramine up to 
      12 g/day because prerandomization LDL cholesterol remained > or = 160 mg/dl. The 
      primary end point, assessed by quantitative coronary angiography, was
      within-patient per-lesion change in minimum lumen diameter (MLD) of qualifying
      lesions. Across 2.5 years, mean LDL cholesterol was reduced by 23.9% in all
      fluvastatin patients (+/- cholestyramine) (146 to 111 mg/dl) and by 22.5% in the 
      fluvastatin only subgroup (137 to 106 mg/dl). Primary end point analysis (340
      patients) showed significantly less lesion progression in all fluvastatin versus 
      all placebo patients, deltaMLD -0.028 versus -0.100 mm (p <0.01), and for
      fluvastatin alone versus placebo alone, deltaMLD -0.024 versus -0.094 mm (p
      <0.02). A consistent angiographic benefit with treatment was seen whether
      baseline LDL cholesterol was above or below 160 or 130 mg/dl. Beneficial trends
      with treatment were also consistently seen in clinical event rates but were not
      statistically significant. Thus, lipid lowering by fluvastatin in patients with
      mildly to moderately elevated LDL cholesterol significantly slowed CHD
      progression.

      hypercholesterolemia.
PG  - 142-7
AB  - The effects of simvastatin and pravastatin administered alone at initial doses of
      5 and 10 mg/day, respectively, on normalization of abnormal lipid metabolism in
      patients with hypercholesterolemia were evaluated by a crossover method. Patients
      whose serum levels of total cholesterol (TC) were > or = 220 mg/dl were randomly 
      divided into two groups, and one of the groups (group S-P: 17 patients) was
      treated with simvastatin first and then with pravastatin whereas the other group 
      (group P-S: 19 patients) was treated with pravastatin first and then with
      simvastatin. Simvastatin or pravastatin was replaced with the other drug after
      8-week administration in each group. These drugs were administered for 8 weeks
      each. Simvastatin and pravastatin significantly reduced the following serum
      lipids as compared with the levels in the observation period: TC by 23.2 +/- 8.1%
      and 18.1 +/- 10.9%, triglyceride (TG) by 13.0 +/- 24.7% and 5.8 +/- 47.1%, and
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by 31.3 +/- 10.1% and 23.1 +/- 14.3%,
      respectively. TC and LDL-C levels were significantly (p < 0.001) lower and
      decreased to significantly (p < 0.001) greater degrees after simvastatin
      treatment than after pravastatin treatment. TC was normalized in 77.8% of the
      patients (28 of 36) after simvastatin treatment and in 68.9% of the patients (23 
      of 36) after pravastatin treatment. LDL-C was normalized in 63.9% of the patients
      (23 of 36) after simvastatin treatment and in 44.4% of the patients (16 of 36)
      after pravastatin treatment. The percentage of patients whose LDL-C was
      normalized by simvastatin was significantly (p < 0.05) higher as compared with
      pravastatin. Results of this trial, which was conducted by a crossover method,
      show that the initial dose of simvastatin reduces serum cholesterol and LDL-C
      more potently than the initial dose of pravastatin in patients with
      hypercholesterolemia.

      atorvastatin versus simvastatin in patients with hypercholesterolemia.
PG  - 39-44
AB  - We directly compared the safety and efficacy of atorvastatin and simvastatin in
      hypercholesterolemic patients. This 1-year, randomized, double-blind study was
      performed at 9 community- and university-based research hospitals in Australia.
      One-hundred seventy-seven patients between the ages of 18 and 80 years with
      baseline low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol > or = 4.14 and < or = 7.76
      mmol/L (160 and 300 mg/dl, respectively) and triglycerides < or = 4.52 mmol/L
      (400 mg/dl) received once-daily dosing with atorvastatin (Lipitor) 10 mg or
      simvastatin (Zocor) 10 mg. At week 16, the dose of medication was titrated to
      atorvastatin 20 mg or simvastatin 20 mg if patients did not meet LDL cholesterol 
      target of < or = 3.36 mmol/L (130 mg/dl). Efficacy was reported as percent change
      from baseline in LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, very low density lipoprotein
      cholesterol, total triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol,
      apolipoproteins AI and B, and lipoprotein(a). Atorvastatin caused significantly
      greater reductions from baseline than did simvastatin for LDL cholesterol, total 
      cholesterol, very low density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and
      apolipoprotein B (p <0.05). No patient in either treatment group had clinically
      important elevations in creatine phosphokinase, alanine aminotransaminase, or
      aspartate aminotransaminase. No serious adverse events were considered associated
      with treatment. With atorvastatin 10 mg, 46% of the patients achieved LDL
      cholesterol target goal by week 16, whereas only 27% of the simvastatin patients 
      achieved the target goal at the 10-mg dose. This cholesterol-lowering profile
      affords utility in many patient types.

      inhibitor (reductase inhibitor) to an accepted drug of this class in patients
      with moderate hypercholesterolemia. Participants remained on a
      cholesterol-lowering diet throughout the study. One thousand forty-nine patients 
      were randomized to receive atorvastatin 10 mg, lovastatin 20 mg, or placebo. At
      16 weeks the placebo group was randomized to either atorvastatin or lovastatin
      treatment. At 22 weeks, patients who had not met low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
      cholesterol target levels doubled the dose of reductase inhibitor. Efficacy
      evaluation was mean percent change from baseline in LDL cholesterol,
      triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, and
      apolipoprotein B (apoB). Safety profiles as determined by change from baseline in
      laboratory evaluations, ophthalmologic parameters, and reporting of adverse
      events were similar for the 2 reductase inhibitors. After 52 weeks, the
      atorvastatin group maintained a significantly greater reduction in LDL
      cholesterol (-37% vs -29%), triglyceride (-16% vs -8%), total cholesterol (-27%
      vs -21%), and apoB (-30% vs -22%) (p <0.05). More patients receiving atorvastatin
      achieved LDL cholesterol target levels than did lovastatin patients (78% vs 63%, 
      respectively), particularly those with coronary heart disease (37% vs 11%,
      respectively). Atorvastatin is highly effective and well tolerated in patients
      with primary hypercholesterolemia with no increased risk of adverse events.

PG  - 191-7
AB  - Plasma cholesterol and other lipoproteins play a significant role in the
      development of atherosclerosis and subsequent coronary heart disease (CHD). This 
      1 year study was designed to confirm the efficacy and safety of atorvastatin
      (Lipitor) compared to pravastatin, a marketed agent for low density lipoprotein
      cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction in hypercholesterolemic patients. Patients were
      recruited at 26 centers in six European countries. After a 6 week placebo
      baseline phase, patients were randomized to receive atorvastatin 10 mg or
      pravastatin 20 mg daily. The dose could be doubled at week 16, if LDL-C levels
      remained > or = 3.4 mmol/l (135 mg/dl). Atorvastatin significantly lowered LDL-C 
      from baseline by 35% compared with 23% for pravastatin (P < 0.05). A total of 72%
      of atorvastatin patients attained the LDL-C target level of < 3.4 mmol/l,
      compared to 26% of pravastatin patients. Atorvastatin also significantly reduced 
      TC, TG and apo B (P < 0.05). Safety was assessed by recording adverse events and 
      measuring clinical laboratory parameters. The adverse event profile was similar
      for both treatment groups and neither treatment caused clinically relevant
      laboratory abnormalities. Atorvastatin 10 and 20 mg once daily is superior to
      pravastatin 20 and 40 mg once daily in treating patients with
      hypercholesterolemia.

TI  - The effect of simvastatin on progression of coronary artery disease. The
      Multicenter coronary Intervention Study (CIS).
PG  - 226-34
AB  - BACKGROUND: In several angiographic trials, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have
      shown a beneficial effect on the progression of coronary artery disease. Using 20
      mg simvastatin, day-1, a treatment period of up to 4 years was necessary to show 
      a significant reduction in coronary artery disease progression. The question
      remains however whether higher dosages of simvastatin would be more advantageous 
      in respect to the magnitude of the effect and the required time interval to
      demonstrate treatment efficacy. METHODS AND RESULTS: In the Coronary Intervention
      Study (CIS), a multicentre randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study, the 
      effects of lipid-lowering therapy with simvastatin on progression of coronary
      artery disease in 254 men with documented coronary artery disease and
      hypercholesterolaemia were investigated. Following a period of lipid-lowering
      diet, treatment with 40 mg simvastatin or placebo was maintained for an average
      of 2.3 years. Two primary angiographic endpoints were chosen: the global change
      score (visual evaluation according to the method of Blankenhorn) and the per
      patient mean change of minimum lumen diameter (evaluated by the CAAS I system).
      The mean simvastatin dose was 34.5 mg day-1. In the placebo group, the serum
      lipids remained unchanged; in comparison to the placebo group the simvastatin
      group showed a 35% LDL-cholesterol decrease. Coronary angiography was repeated in
      205 patients (81%) and 203 film pairs (80%,) were evaluable by quantitative
      coronary angiography. In the simvastatin and placebo groups, the mean global
      change scores were +0.20 and +0.58 respectively, demonstrating a significantly
      slower progression of coronary artery disease in the treatment group (P = 0.02). 
      The change in minimum lumen diameter assessed by computer-assisted quantitative
      evaluation with the CAAS I system was -0.02 mm in the simvastatin group and -0.10
      mm in the placebo group (P = 0.002). In the simvastatin group, there was a
      significant correlation between the LDL cholesterol levels achieved
      therapeutically and the per patient mean loss of minimum lumen diameter (r =
      0.29; P = 0.003). During the study period, there was no significant difference in
      the incidence of serious cardiac events (15 of 129 patients in the simvastatin
      group and 19 of 125 patients in the placebo group, ns). CONCLUSION: Treatment
      with 40 mg simvastatin day-1 reduces serum cholesterol and slows the progression 
      of coronary artery disease significantly within a short period of treatment time.
      In the treatment group, retardation of progression is inversely correlated to the
      LDL-cholesterol levels achieved.

TI  - The effect of aggressive lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels
      and low-dose anticoagulation on obstructive changes in saphenous-vein
      coronary-artery bypass grafts. The Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Trial
      Investigators.
PG  - 153-62
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obstructive changes often occur in aortocoronary saphenous-vein
      bypass grafts because of atherosclerosis and thrombosis. We studied whether
      aggressive lowering of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels or
      low-dose anticoagulation would delay the progression of atherosclerosis in
      grafts. METHODS: We studied 1351 patients who had undergone bypass surgery 1 to
      11 years before base line and who had an LDL cholesterol level between 130 and
      175 mg per deciliter and at least one patent vein graft as seen on angiography.
      We used a two-by-two factorial design to assign patients to aggressive or
      moderate treatment to lower LDL cholesterol levels (with lovastatin and, if
      needed, cholestyramine) and to treatment with warfarin or placebo. Angiography
      was repeated an average of 4.3 years after base line. The primary angiographic
      outcome was the mean percentage per patient of grafts with a decrease of 0.6 mm
      or more in lumen diameter. RESULTS: As measured annually during the study period,
      the mean LDL cholesterol level of patients aggressive treatment ranged from 93 to
      97 mg per deciliter; with moderate treatment, the range was from 132 to 136 mg
      per deciliter (P<0.001). The mean international normalized ratio was 1.4 in the
      warfarin group and 1.1 in the placebo group (P<0.001). The mean percentage of
      grafts with progression of atherosclerosis was 27 percent for patients whose LDL 
      cholesterol level was lowered with aggressive treatment, and 39 percent for those
      who received moderate treatment (P<0.001). There was no significant difference in
      angiographic outcome between the warfarin and placebo groups. The rate of
      revascularization over four years was 29 percent lower in the group whose LDL
      cholesterol level was lowered aggressively than in the group receiving moderate
      treatment (6.5 percent vs. 9.2 percent, P= 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive
      lowering of LDL cholesterol levels to below 100 mg per deciliter reduced the
      progression of atherosclerosis in grafts. Low-dose warfarin did not reduce the
      progression of atherosclerosis.

TI  - The effect of pravastatin on coronary events after myocardial infarction in
      patients with average cholesterol levels. Cholesterol and Recurrent Events Trial 
      investigators.
PG  - 1001-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: In patients with high cholesterol levels, lowering the cholesterol
      level reduces the risk of coronary events, but the effect of lowering cholesterol
      levels in the majority of patients with coronary disease, who have average
      levels, is less clear. METHODS: In a double-blind trial lasting five years we
      administered either 40 mg of pravastatin per day or placebo to 4159 patients
      (3583 men and 576 women) with myocardial infarction who had plasma total
      cholesterol levels below 240 mg per deciliter (mean, 209) and low-density
      lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels of 115 to 174 mg per deciliter (mean, 139). 
      The primary end point was a fatal coronary event or a nonfatal myocardial
      infarction. RESULTS: The frequency of the primary end point was 10.2 percent in
      the pravastatin group and 13.2 percent in the placebo group, an absolute
      difference of 3 percentage points and a 24 percent reduction in risk (95 percent 
      confidence interval, 9 to 36 percent; P = 0.003). Coronary bypass surgery was
      needed in 7.5 percent of the patients in the pravastatin group and 10 percent of 
      those in the placebo group, a 26 percent reduction (P=0.005), and coronary
      angioplasty was needed in 8.3 percent of the pravastatin group and 10.5 percent
      of the placebo group, a 23 percent reduction (P=0.01). The frequency of stroke
      was reduced by 31 percent (P=0.03). There were no significant differences in
      overall mortality or mortality from noncardiovascular causes. Pravastatin lowered
      the rate of coronary events more among women than among men. The reduction in
      coronary events was also greater in patients with higher pretreatment levels of
      LDL cholesterol. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that the benefit of
      cholesterol-lowering therapy extends to the majority of patients with coronary
      disease who have average cholesterol levels.

TI  - Treatment of hyperlipidemia after heart transplantation and rationale for the
      Heart Transplant Lipid Registry.
PG  - 532-5
AB  - Hyperlipidemia occurs frequently after heart transplantation, and accelerated
      coronary artery disease remains the major cause of morbidity and mortality in
      patients who survive more than 1 year after heart transplantation. However, the
      risks and benefits of lipid-lowering therapy after heart transplantation remain
      poorly defined, and national guidelines for lipid-lowering drug therapy do not
      specifically address treatment of dyslipidemia in transplant recipients. Since
      the initial reports in the 1980s of rhabdomyolysis in heart transplant patients
      receiving high-dosage lovastatin, results of 11 post-transplantation series that 
      used lovastatin, simvastatin, or pravastatin at lower dosages as drug monotherapy
      have been published. These studies have shown an overall 1% incidence of
      rhabdomyolysis, defined as creatine kinase > 10 times the upper limit of normal
      plus muscle symptoms. One randomized, controlled prospective trial has
      investigated the effects of lipid-lowering pharmacotherapy on patient outcome in 
      cardiac transplant recipients. At 1-year follow-up in this nonblinded,
      single-center trial, patients treated with pravastatin (20 or 40 mg/day)
      initiated within 2 weeks of transplantation had a significant reduction in
      mortality rate and a significantly lower incidence of transplant arteriopathy. A 
      number of important issues remain unanswered regarding treatment guidelines in
      patients with hyperlipidemia after heart transplantation. In January 1995 we
      began the Heart Transplant Lipid Registry, with 12 participant centers, to gather
      data prospectively on the efficacy and safety of lipid-lowering drugs in the
      treatment of dyslipidemia after heart transplantation.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of lovastatin in 459 African-Americans with
      hypercholesterolemia.
PG  - 420-4
AB  - A paucity of substantive data from clinical drug trials is available specifically
      evaluating the effects of therapy for hypercholesterolemia in African-Americans, 
      even though a substantial number are candidates for medical advice and
      intervention for high blood cholesterol. The efficacy and safety of lovastatin in
      459 African-Americans with hypercholesterolemia were studied in the Expanded
      Clinical Evaluation of Lovastatin study, a multicenter, double-blind, diet- and
      placebo-controlled trial. This trial involved 8,245 patients who were randomly
      assigned, regardless of race, to receive placebo or lovastatin at doses of 20 mg 
      once daily, 40 mg once daily, 20 mg twice daily, or 40 mg twice daily for 48
      weeks. Among African-Americans, lovastatin produced sustained, dose-related (p
      <0.001) decreases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (20% to 38%), total
      cholesterol (14% to 28%), and triglycerides (8% to 15%). From 75% to 96% of
      African-Americans treated with lovastatin achieved the National Cholesterol
      Education Program goal of low-density lipoprotien cholesterol <160 mg/di, and
      from 33% to 71% achieved the goal <130 mg/di. The safety profile of lovastotin in
      African-Americans was generally favorable. A relatively high incidence of
      creatine kinase levels greater than the upper limit of normal was observed in
      African-Americans during the study, i.e., 63% in the placebo group and similar
      levels in lovastatin treatment groups. Lovastatin is highly effective and
      generally well tolerated as therapy for primary hypercholesterolemia in
      African-Americans.

PG  - 475-9
AB  - This multicenter study compared the effects of lovastatin (40 mg) and pravastatin
      (40 mg) on quality of life. Men, aged 20 to 65 years old, with primary
      hypercholesterolemia (types IIa and IIb) were eligible for enrollment if baseline
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol met the first National Cholesterol Education 
      Program adult treatment guidelines. Eligible patients were enrolled into a 6-week
      diet baseline period, followed by a 6-week diet-plus-placebo period. Patients
      whose low-density lipoprotein cholesterol still met National Cholesterol
      Education Program guidelines for drug therapy were randomized into the
      double-blind, active-treatment period to receive either lovastatin 40 mg or
      pravastatin 40 mg/day for 12 weeks. Clinic visits were scheduled every 4 weeks
      and included complete serum lipid profiles, monitoring of adverse experiences,
      and patient completion of health-related quality-of-life questionnaires. The
      primary end point of the study was the change in quality of life, as measured by 
      the Nottingham Health Profile (part 1) after 12 weeks of treatment. Secondary end
      points included responses to a general health question from the National Health
      and Nutrition Examination Survey, sexual function questions from the Medical
      Outcomes Study, and stress/life event questions from the National Institutes of
      Health Post-Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Study. No significant differences
      between the 2 groups were observed in tolerability, health-related
      quality-of-life measures, or changes in lipid profiles.

TI  - Prevention of coronary heart disease with pravastatin in men with
      hypercholesterolemia. West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study Group.
PG  - 1301-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lowering the blood cholesterol level may reduce the risk of coronary 
      heart disease. This double-blind study was designed to determine whether the
      administration of pravastatin to men with hypercholesterolemia and no history of 
      myocardial infarction reduced the combined incidence of nonfatal myocardial
      infarction and death from coronary heart disease. METHODS: We randomly assigned
      6595 men, 45 to 64 years of age, with a mean (+/- SD) plasma cholesterol level of
      272 +/- 23 mg per deciliter (7.0 +/- 0.6 mmol per liter) to receive pravastatin
      (40 mg each evening) or placebo. The average follow-up period was 4.9 years.
      Medical records, electrocardiographic recordings, and the national death registry
      were used to determine the clinical end points. RESULTS: Pravastatin lowered
      plasma cholesterol levels by 20 percent and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol
      levels by 26 percent, whereas there was no change with placebo. There were 248
      definite coronary events (specified as nonfatal myocardial infarction or death
      from coronary heart disease) in the placebo group, and 174 in the pravastatin
      group (relative reduction in risk with pravastatin, 31 percent; 95 percent
      confidence interval, 17 to 43 percent; P < 0.001). There were similar reductions 
      in the risk of definite nonfatal myocardial infarctions (31 percent reduction, P 
      < 0.001), death from coronary heart disease (definite cases alone: 28 percent
      reduction, P = 0.13; definite plus suspected cases: 33 percent reduction, P =
      0.042), and death from all cardiovascular causes (32 percent reduction, P =
      0.033). There was no excess of deaths from noncardiovascular causes in the
      pravastatin group. We observed a 22 percent reduction in the risk of death from
      any cause in the pravastatin group (95 percent confidence interval, 0 to 40
      percent; P = 0.051). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with pravastatin significantly
      reduced the incidence of myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular
      causes without adversely affecting the risk of death from noncardiovascular
      causes in men with moderate hypercholesterolemia and no history of myocardial
      infarction.

TI  - Pravastatin limitation of atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries (PLAC I):
      reduction in atherosclerosis progression and clinical events. PLAC I
      investigation.
PG  - 1133-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to evaluate the effect of pravastatin on
      progression of coronary atherosclerosis and ischemic events in patients with
      coronary artery disease and mild to moderate hyperlipidemia. BACKGROUND: Few
      clinical trial data support the use of lipid-lowering therapy in patients with
      coronary artery disease and mild to moderate elevations in cholesterol levels.
      METHODS: Four hundred eight patients (mean age 57 years) with coronary artery
      disease and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol > or = 130 mg/dl (3.36
      mmol/liter) but < 190 mg/dl ([4.91 mmol/liter]) despite diet were randomized in a
      3-year study to receive pravastatin or placebo. Atherosclerosis progression was
      evaluated by quantitative coronary arteriography. RESULTS: Baseline mean LDL
      cholesterol was 164 mg/dl (4.24 mmol/liter). Pravastatin decreased total and LDL 
      cholesterol and triglyceride levels by 19%, 28% and 8%, respectively, and
      increased high density lipoprotein cholesterol by 7% (p < or = 0.001 vs. placebo 
      for all lipid variables). Progression of atherosclerosis was reduced by 40% for
      minimal vessel diameter (p = 0.04), particularly in lesions < 50% stenosis at
      baseline. There was a consistent although not statistically significant effect on
      mean diameter and percent diameter stenosis. There were also fewer new lesions in
      those assigned pravastatin (p < or = 0.03). Myocardial infarction was reduced
      during active treatment (8 in the pravastatin group, 17 in the placebo group;
      log-rank test, p < or = 0.05; 60% risk reduction), with the benefit beginning to 
      emerge after 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with coronary artery disease and
      mild to moderate cholesterol elevations, pravastatin reduces progression of
      coronary atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction. The time course of event
      reduction increases the potential for a relatively rapid decrease in the clinical
      manifestations of coronary artery disease with lipid lowering.

TI  - Kuopio Atherosclerosis Prevention Study (KAPS). A population-based primary
      preventive trial of the effect of LDL lowering on atherosclerotic progression in 
      carotid and femoral arteries.
PG  - 1758-64
AB  - BACKGROUND: The atherosclerotic progression-reducing effect of LDL cholesterol
      (LDL-C) lowering has been established in subjects with severe atherosclerotic
      disease but not in persons with elevated LDL cholesterols without severe
      atherosclerosis. KAPS (Kuopio Atherosclerosis Prevention Study) is the first
      population-based trial in the primary prevention of carotid and femoral
      atherosclerosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: The eligibility requirements were serum
      LDL-C > or = 4.0 mmol/L and total cholesterol < 7.5 mmol/L. Out of a
      geographically defined population, 447 men aged 44 to 65 years (mean, 57) were
      randomized to pravastatin (40 mg/d) or placebo for 3 years. Less than 10% of the 
      subjects had prior myocardial infarction. Thirty-nine men discontinued study
      medication; however, efficacy data were available for 424 men. The primary
      outcome was the rate of carotid atherosclerotic progression, measured as the
      linear slope over annual ultrasound examinations in the average of the maximum
      carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) of the far wall of up to four arterial
      segments (the right and left distal common carotid artery and the right and left 
      carotid bulb). For the carotid arteries, at the overall mean baseline IMT of 1.66
      mm, the rate of progression of carotid atherosclerosis was 45% (95% CI, 16 to
      69%) less in the pravastatin (0.017 mm/y) than the placebo (0.031 mm/y) group (P 
      = .005). In the common carotid artery there was a treatment effect of 66% (95%
      CI, 30 to 95%; pravastatin 0.010 mm/y; placebo 0.029 mm/y; P < .002) at the
      overall mean baseline IMT of 1.35 mm. A treatment effect of 30% (95% CI, -1% to
      54%) was found for the carotid bulb (pravastatin, 0.028; placebo, 0.040; P =
      .056) at the overall mean baseline IMT of 2.0 mm. The treatment effect was larger
      in subjects with higher baseline IMT values, in smokers and in those with low
      plasma vitamin E levels. There was no significant treatment effect on
      atherosclerotic progression in the femoral arteries. CONCLUSIONS: These data
      establish the antiatherogenic effect of LDL-C lowering by pravastatin in
      hypercholesterolemic men in a primary prevention setting and suggest a greater
      effect in smokers than in nonsmokers.

TI  - Effects of lipid lowering by pravastatin on progression and regression of
      coronary artery disease in symptomatic men with normal to moderately elevated
      serum cholesterol levels. The Regression Growth Evaluation Statin Study
      (REGRESS).
PG  - 2528-40
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intensive lowering of serum cholesterol may retard progression of
      coronary atherosclerosis in selected groups of patients. However, few data are
      available on the potential benefit of serum cholesterol reduction in the broad
      range of patients with coronary atherosclerosis and normal to moderately elevated
      serum cholesterol levels who undergo various forms of treatment. The Regression
      Growth Evaluation Statin Study (REGRESS) addresses this group of patients.
      METHODS AND RESULTS: REGRESS is a double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter
      study to assess the effects of 2 years of treatment with the
      3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor pravastatin on
      progression and regression of coronary atherosclerosis in 885 male patients with 
      a serum cholesterol level between 4 and 8 mmol/L (155 and 310 mg/dL) by
      quantitative coronary arteriography. Primary end points were (1) change in
      average mean segment diameter per patient and (2) change in average minimum
      obstruction diameter per patient. Clinical events were also analyzed. Of the 885 
      patients, 778 (88%) had an evaluable final angiogram. Mean segment diameter
      decreased 0.10 mm in the placebo group versus 0.06 mm in the pravastatin group (P
      = .019): The mean difference between treatment groups was 0.04 mm, with a 95% CI 
      of 0.01 to 0.07 mm. The median minimum obstruction diameter decreased 0.09 mm in 
      the placebo group versus 0.03 mm in the pravastatin group (P = .001): The
      difference of the medians between the treatment groups was 0.06 mm, with a CI of 
      0.02 to 0.08 mm. At the end of the follow-up period, 89% (CI, 86% to 92%) of the 
      pravastatin patients and 81% (CI, 77% to 85%) of the placebo patients were
      without new cardiovascular events (P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: In symptomatic men
      with significant coronary atherosclerosis and normal to moderately elevated serum
      cholesterol, less progression of coronary atherosclerosis and fewer new
      cardiovascular events were observed in the group of patients treated with
      pravastatin than in the placebo group.

AB  - We randomized 151 coronary patients to placebo or pravastatin and treated them
      for 3 years. B-mode ultrasound quantification of carotid artery intimal-medial
      thickness (IMT) was obtained at baseline and sequentially during this period. The
      primary outcome was the change in the mean of the maximal IMT measurements across
      time. Effects on individual carotid artery segments (common, bifurcation, and
      internal carotid) and on clinical events were also investigated. Plasma
      concentrations of total cholesterol were lower with active treatment than with
      placebo (4.80 vs 6.07 mmol/L [186 vs 235 mg/dl], respectively) as were
      concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (3.11 vs 4.30 mmol/L [120
      vs 167 mg/dl], respectively). Plasma concentrations of high-density lipoprotein2 
      cholesterol were higher with active treatment (0.16 vs 0.14 mmol/L [6.1 vs 5.5
      mg/dl], respectively). Active treatment resulted in a nonsignificant 12%
      reduction in progression of the mean-maximum IMT (from 0.068 to 0.059 mm/year)
      and a statistically significant 35% reduction in IMT progression in the common
      carotid. Active treatment was also associated with a reduction in fatal and
      nonfatal coronary events [corrected] (p = 0.09) and of any fatal event plus
      nonfatal myocardial infarction (p = 0.04).

TI  - Randomised trial of cholesterol lowering in 4444 patients with coronary heart
      disease: the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S)
PG  - 1383-9
AB  - Drug therapy for hypercholesterolaemia has remained controversial mainly because 
      of insufficient clinical trial evidence for improved survival. The present trial 
      was designed to evaluate the effect of cholesterol lowering with simvastatin on
      mortality and morbidity in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). 4444
      patients with angina pectoris or previous myocardial infarction and serum
      cholesterol 5.5-8.0 mmol/L on a lipid-lowering diet were randomised to
      double-blind treatment with simvastatin or placebo. Over the 5.4 years median
      follow-up period, simvastatin produced mean changes in total cholesterol,
      low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol of 
      -25%, -35%, and +8%, respectively, with few adverse effects. 256 patients (12%)
      in the placebo group died, compared with 182 (8%) in the simvastatin group. The
      relative risk of death in the simvastatin group was 0.70 (95% CI 0.58-0.85, p =
      0.0003). The 6-year probabilities of survival in the placebo and simvastatin
      groups were 87.6% and 91.3%, respectively. There were 189 coronary deaths in the 
      placebo group and 111 in the simvastatin group (relative risk 0.58, 95% CI
      0.46-0.73), while noncardiovascular causes accounted for 49 and 46 deaths,
      respectively. 622 patients (28%) in the placebo group and 431 (19%) in the
      simvastatin group had one or more major coronary events. The relative risk was
      0.66 (95% CI 0.59-0.75, p < 0.00001), and the respective probabilities of
      escaping such events were 70.5% and 79.6%. This risk was also significantly
      reduced in subgroups consisting of women and patients of both sexes aged 60 or
      more. Other benefits of treatment included a 37% reduction (p < 0.00001) in the
      risk of undergoing myocardial revascularisation procedures. This study shows that
      long-term treatment with simvastatin is safe and improves survival in CHD
      patients.

TI  - Lack of effect of lovastatin on restenosis after coronary angioplasty. Lovastatin
      Restenosis Trial Study Group.
PG  - 1331-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Experimental and clinical observations suggest that lowering serum
      lipid levels may reduce the risk of restenosis after coronary angioplasty. We
      report the results of a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial evaluating
      whether lowering lipid levels with lovastatin can prevent or delay restenosis
      after angioplasty. METHODS: Seven to 10 days before angioplasty, we randomly
      assigned eligible patients to receive lovastatin (40 mg orally twice daily) or
      placebo. Patients who underwent successful, complication-free, first-time
      angioplasty of a native vessel (the index lesion) continued to receive therapy
      for six months, when a second coronary angiogram was obtained. The primary end
      point was the extent of restenosis of the index lesion, as assessed by
      quantitative coronary arteriography. Of 404 patients randomly assigned to study
      groups, 384 underwent angioplasty; 354 of the procedures were successful, and 321
      patients underwent angiographic restudy at six months. RESULTS: At base line, the
      patients in the lovastatin group (n = 203) and the placebo group (n = 201) were
      similar with respect to demographic clinical, angiographic, and laboratory
      characteristics. At base line the mean (+/- SD) degree of stenosis, expressed as 
      a percentage of the diameter of the vessel, was 64 +/- 11 percent in the
      lovastatin group, as compared with 63 +/- 11 percent in the placebo group (P =
      0.22). Despite a 42 percent reduction in the serum level of low-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol in the lovastatin group, after six months of treatment
      the amount of stenosis seen in the second angiogram was 46 +/- 20 percent in the 
      placebo group, as compared with 44 +/- 21 percent in the lovastatin group (P =
      0.50). Similarly, there were no significant differences in minimal luminal
      diameter or other measures of restenosis. A trend was noted toward more
      myocardial infarctions in the lovastatin group, as a result of acute vessel
      closure or restenosis at the site of angioplasty, but there were no other
      important differences between the two groups in the frequency of fatal or
      nonfatal events at six months. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with high-dose lovastatin
      initiated before coronary angioplasty does not prevent or delay the process of
      restenosis in the first six months after the procedure.

TI  - Expanded Clinical Evaluation of Lovastatin (EXCEL) study results: two-year
      efficacy and safety follow-up.
PG  - 667-73
AB  - The Expanded Clinical Evaluation of Lovastatin study, a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo- and diet-controlled multicenter trial, evaluated the efficacy and
      tolerability of lovastatin over 48 weeks in 8,245 patients with moderately severe
      hypercholesterolemia. During year 1 of follow-up of the full cohort, lovastatin
      at 20 or 40 mg/day, or 20 or 40 mg twice daily, produced dose-dependent decreases
      in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (24% to 40%) and triglyceride levels
      (10% to 19%), and increases in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (6.6%
      to 9.5%). In all, 977 patients continued their original blinded treatment for an 
      additional year. In year 2, the LDL cholesterol response to lovastatin was
      maintained, the triglyceride reductions were somewhat less, and the increases in 
      HDL cholesterol were moderately greater than in year 1. Successive transaminase
      elevations > 3 times the upper limit of normal were observed in only 1 patient in
      year 2, yielding a cumulative 2-year incidence of from 0.1% (placebo or
      lovastatin 20 mg/day) to 1.9% (lovastatin 80 mg/day). Myopathy occurred in only 1
      patient during year 2, and over the 2-year study was observed rarely and only at 
      lovastatin dosages of 40 and 80 mg/day. This study indicates that lovastatin
      maintains its efficacy over long-term follow-up, particularly in effectively
      lowering LDL cholesterol, is generally well tolerated, and has a favorable safety
      profile.

TI  - Effect of lovastatin on early carotid atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events. 
      Asymptomatic Carotid Artery Progression Study (ACAPS) Research Group.
PG  - 1679-87
AB  - BACKGROUND: HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (or statins), a new class of
      lipid-lowering compounds, have raised expectations for more widespread use than
      that of the older lipid-lowering drugs. Not only are they more effective in
      lowering LDL cholesterol, but they are better tolerated as well. No data exist
      concerning the effect of statins on early carotid atherosclerosis and clinical
      events in men and women who have moderately elevated LDL cholesterol levels but
      are free of symptomatic cardiovascular disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: Lovastatin
      (20 to 40 mg/d) or its placebo was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized
      clinical trial with factorial design along with warfarin (1 mg/d) or its placebo.
      This report is limited to the lovastatin component of the trial. Daily aspirin
      (81 mg/d) was recommended for everyone. Enrollment included 919 asymptomatic men 
      and women, 40 to 79 years old, with early carotid atherosclerosis as defined by
      B-mode ultrasonography and LDL cholesterol between the 60th and 90th percentiles.
      The 3-year change in mean maximum intimal-medial thickness (IMT) in 12 walls of
      the carotid arteries was the primary outcome; change in single maximum IMT and
      incidence of major cardiovascular events were secondary outcomes. LDL cholesterol
      fell 28%, from 156.6 mg/dL at baseline to 113.1 mg/dL at 6 months (P < .0001), in
      the lovastatin groups and was largely unchanged in the lovastatin-placebo groups.
      Among participants not on warfarin, regression of the mean maximum IMT was seen
      after 12 months in the lovastatin group compared with the placebo group; the
      3-year difference was statistically significant (P = .001). A larger favorable
      effect of lovastatin was observed for the change in single maximum IMT but was
      not statistically significant (P = .12). Five lovastatin-treated participants
      suffered major cardiovascular events--coronary heart disease mortality, nonfatal 
      myocardial infarction, or stroke--versus 14 in the lovastatin-placebo groups (P =
      .04). One lovastatin-treated participant died, compared with eight on
      lovastatin-placebo (P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: In men and women with moderately
      elevated LDL cholesterol, lovastatin reverses progression of IMT in the carotid
      arteries and appears to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events and
      mortality. Results from ongoing large-scale clinical trials may further establish
      the clinical benefit of statins.

TI  - Effect of simvastatin on coronary atheroma: the Multicentre Anti-Atheroma Study
      (MAAS)
PG  - 633-8
AB  - It has yet to be established whether substantial reduction of plasma lipids will 
      lead to retardation, and to what extent and how quickly, of diffuse and focal
      coronary atheroma. The Multicentre Anti-Atheroma Study (MAAS) is a randomised
      double-blind clinical trial of 381 patients with coronary heart disease assigned 
      to treatment with diet and either simvastatin 20 mg daily or placebo for 4 years.
      Patients on simvastatin had a 23% reduction in serum cholesterol, a 31% reduction
      in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and a 9% increase in high-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol compared with placebo over 4 years. Quantitative coronary
      angiography was done at baseline, and after 2 and 4 years. 167 patients (89%) on 
      placebo and 178 (92%) on simvastatin had baseline and follow-up angiograms. In
      the placebo group there were reductions in mean lumen diameter (-0.08 mm) and in 
      minimum lumen diameter (-0.13 mm). Treatment effects were +0.06 (95% CI 0.02 to
      0.10) and +0.08 mm (0.03 to 0.14) for mean and minimum lumen diameter,
      respectively (combined p = 0.006). Patients on placebo had an increase in mean
      diameter stenosis of 3.6% and the treatment effect of simvastatin was -2.6% (-4.4
      to -0.8). Treatment effects were observed regardless of diameter stenosis at
      baseline. On a per-patient basis, angiographic progression occurred less often in
      the simvastatin group, 41 versus 54 patients; and regression was more frequent,
      33 versus 20 patients (combined p = 0.02). Significantly more new lesions and new
      total occlusions developed in the placebo group, 48 versus 28, and 18 versus 8,
      respectively. There was no difference in clinical outcome. The numbers of
      patients who died or had a myocardial infarction were 16 and 14 in the placebo
      and simvastatin groups, respectively. In the placebo group more patients
      underwent coronary angioplasty or re-vascularisation, 34 versus 23 on
      simvastatin. The trial showed that 20 mg simvastatin daily over 4 years reduces
      hyperlipidaemia and slows progression of diffuse and focal coronary
      atherosclerosis.

TI  - Effects of monotherapy with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor on the progression of 
      coronary atherosclerosis as assessed by serial quantitative arteriography. The
      Canadian Coronary Atherosclerosis Intervention Trial.
PG  - 959-68
AB  - BACKGROUND: 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors are widely
      prescribed for hyperlipidemia, yet their effect on the evolution of coronary
      atherosclerosis has not been defined. METHODS AND RESULTS: To address this issue,
      331 patients with diffuse but not necessarily severe coronary atherosclerosis
      documented on a recent arteriogram and with fasting serum cholesterol between 220
      and 300 mg/dL were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      trial. All patients received intensive dietary counseling. Lovastatin or placebo 
      was begun at 20 mg/d and was titrated to 40 and 80 mg during the first 16 weeks
      to attain a fasting low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol < or = 130 mg/dL.
      The mean lovastatin dose was 36 mg/d. Coronary arteriography was repeated after 2
      years. In 299 patients (90%), 3858 coronary segments containing 2309 stenoses
      were measured blindly on pairs of films with an automated computerized
      quantitative system. Total and LDL cholesterol decreased by 21 +/- 11% and 29 +/-
      11%, respectively, in the lovastatin-treated group but changed by < 2% in placebo
      patients. The primary end point, coronary change score, defined as the
      per-patient mean of the minimum lumen diameter changes (follow-up minus baseline 
      angiogram) for all lesions measured, excluding those < 25% on both films,
      worsened by 0.09 +/- 0.16 mm in the placebo group and by 0.05 +/- 0.13 mm in the 
      lovastatin group (P = .01). Progression (a worsening in minimum diameter of one
      or more stenoses by > or = 0.4 mm) with no regression at other sites occurred in 
      48 of 146 lovastatin and 76 of 153 placebo patients (33% versus 50%, P = .003).
      New coronary lesions developed in 23 lovastatin and 49 placebo patients (P =
      .001). The beneficial effect of treatment was most pronounced in the more
      numerous, milder lesions and in patients whose baseline total or LDL cholesterol 
      levels were above the group median. CONCLUSIONS: Lovastatin slows the progression
      of coronary atherosclerosis and inhibits the development of new coronary lesions.

PG  - 244-54
AB  - Simvastatin and pravastatin, two 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase 
      inhibitors, were compared in a multinational, randomized, double-blind trial.
      Patients demonstrating moderate hypercholesterolemia after 10 weeks on a
      lipid-lowering diet received 6 weeks of treatment with 5 mg/day simvastatin (n = 
      143) or 10 mg/day pravastatin (n = 138); the simvastatin dose was increased to 10
      mg for an additional 6 weeks while the pravastatin dose remained at 10 mg. When
      administered at lower or equivalent daily doses, simvastatin was significantly
      more effective than pravastatin in reducing total and low-density lipoprotein
      (LDL) cholesterol. Reductions in plasma total and LDL cholesterol were
      significantly greater with 5 mg simvastatin (16 and 23%) compared to 10 mg
      pravastatin (12 and 18%; p < or = 0.01). The efficacy of 10 mg simvastatin in
      lowering these lipid parameters was also superior (19 vs. 11% and 27 vs. 17%,
      respectively; p < or = 0.01). At 6 and 12 weeks, a significantly higher
      percentage of simvastatin patients (45 and 59%, respectively) achieved a
      desirable LDL cholesterol level of < 130 mg/dl (< 3.4 mmol/l) compared to
      pravastatin patients (32-33%; p < or = 0.05). Both drugs were well tolerated and 
      had comparable safety profiles.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of simvastatin 20 mg vs pravastatin 20 mg in patients
      with primary hypercholesterolemia. European Study Group.
PG  - 541-54
AB  - The safety, tolerability, and efficacy of 20 mg daily doses of simvastatin and
      pravastatin were compared in this double-blind, randomized trial of 210 patients 
      with primary hypercholesterolemia. Simvastatin was found to produce significantly
      greater mean percent reductions from baseline in total cholesterol (28% versus
      21%), LDL cholesterol (38% versus 29%), and apolipoprotein B concentrations (25% 
      versus 17%) than did pravastatin, and a greater percentage of patients receiving 
      simvastatin (94% versus 80%) had at least a 20% reduction in LDL cholesterol.
      Both simvastatin and pravastatin produced similar significant mean percent
      reductions from baseline in triglyceride concentrations (14% and 11%) and
      significant mean percent increases in the concentrations of HDL cholesterol (7%
      for both) and apolipoprotein A-I (4% for both). Resulting reductions in the
      ratios of total cholesterol: HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol: HDL cholesterol,
      and apolipoprotein B: apolipoprotein A-I were significantly greater in the
      simvastatin group. Both simvastatin and pravastatin were well tolerated. The
      incidence and severity of clinical and laboratory adverse experiences were
      similar in both groups, and none were classified as serious. The results of this 
      study confirm the results of prior studies that have found simvastatin to produce
      lipid-lowering effects superior to those of pravastatin when administered at
      equivalent mg doses, while demonstrating similar safety profiles.
