TI  - Reduced perception of urgency in treatment of overactive bladder with
      extended-release tolterodine.
PG  - 605-11
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of once-daily, extended-release tolterodine on 
      urinary urgency in patients with overactive bladder. METHODS: Patients with
      urinary frequency (eight or more micturitions per 24 hours) and urge incontinence
      (five or more episodes per week) were randomized to oral treatment with
      tolterodine extended release 4 mg once daily (n=398) or placebo (n=374) for 12
      weeks. Efficacy was assessed by use of patient perception evaluations. RESULTS:
      The results presented are a secondary analysis of this double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study. Of patients treated with tolterodine extended release, 
      44% reported improved urgency symptoms (compared with 32% for placebo), and 62%
      reported improved bladder symptoms (placebo, 48%) (both P<.001 compared with
      placebo). The odds of reducing urgency and improving bladder symptoms were 1.68
      and 1.78 times greater, respectively, for patients in the tolterodine extended
      release group than for patients receiving placebo. In response to urgency, there 
      was a more than six-fold increase in the proportion of patients able to finish a 
      task before voiding in the tolterodine extended release group. The proportion of 
      patients unable to hold urine upon experiencing urgency was also decreased by 58%
      with tolterodine, compared with 32% with placebo (P<.001). The proportion of
      patients reporting "much benefit" from treatment was greater for tolterodine
      extended release than for placebo (43% versus 24%; P<.001). The only adverse
      events with an incidence of greater than 5% were dry mouth, headache, and
      constipation, with only dry mouth markedly more frequent with tolterodine than
      with placebo. CONCLUSION: Tolterodine extended release has demonstrable efficacy 
      in reducing the severity of urinary urgency and is associated with improvements
      in overactive bladder symptoms that are meaningful to patients.

TI  - Controlled, double-blind, multicentre clinical trial to investigate long-term
      tolerability and efficacy of trospium chloride in patients with detrusor
      instability.
PG  - 392-9
AB  - Our objectives were to ascertain the tolerability and efficacy of trospium
      chloride in doses of 20 mg twice daily for long-term therapy (52 weeks) in
      patients with urge syndrome. The trial comprised a total of 358 patients with
      urge syndrome or urge incontinence. After randomisation in the ratio of 3:1,
      participants were treated continuously for 52 weeks with either trospium chloride
      (20 mg twice daily) or oxybutynin (5 mg twice daily). At intervals of 4-8 weeks, 
      patients were physically examined with measurements of blood pressure and pulse
      rate, were questioned about any adverse events, checked for compliance and
      underwent relevant laboratory tests. As an additional safety measure, an ECG was 
      made at 26 and 52 weeks. Urodynamic measurements were performed at the beginning,
      and at 26 and 52 weeks to determine the maximal cystometric bladder capacity.
      Among others things, the frequencies of micturition, incontinence and number of
      urgency events were recorded in patient diary protocols in weeks 0, 2, 26 and 52.
      The evaluation of vital parameters, laboratory results and ECGs did not show any 
      relevant changes attributable to the action of the anticholinergics. Analysis of 
      the micturition diary clearly indicated a reduction of the micturition frequency,
      incontinence frequency, and a reduction of the number of urgencies in both
      treatment groups. Mean maximum cystometric bladder capacity increased during
      treatment with trospium chloride by 92 ml after 26 weeks and 115 ml after 52
      weeks (P=0.001). Further comparison with oxybutynin did not reveal any
      statistically significant differences in urodynamic variables between the drugs. 
      Adverse events occurred in 64.8% of the patients treated with trospium chloride
      and 76.7% of those treated with oxybutynin. The main symptom encountered in both 
      treatment group was dryness of the mouth. For patients on trospium chloride, the 
      estimated risk of an unexpected adverse event was 0.027 per patient per week for 
      all adverse events and 0.009 for dryness of the mouth, resulting in a
      considerably lower risk during treatment given with trospium chloride than with
      oxybutynin (0.045 and 0.021, respectively). An overall assessment for each of the
      drugs reveals a comparable efficacy level and a better benefit-risk ratio for
      trospium chloride than for oxybutynin due to better tolerability.

TI  - Does gender or age affect the efficacy and safety of tolterodine?
PG  - 1027-31
AB  - PURPOSE: We compared the importance of patient age and gender relative to the
      intensity of baseline symptoms of overactive bladder in the therapeutic response 
      to the muscarinic receptor antagonist tolterodine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data
      from an open label, observational study of 2,250 patients with overactive bladder
      treated for 12 weeks with tolterodine were analyzed for alterations in frequency,
      urgency and urge incontinence, and for global efficacy and tolerability using
      logistic regression analysis, stratifying for gender, age, baseline symptom
      intensity and tolterodine dose. RESULTS: Gender or tolterodine dose were not
      consistently associated with altered treatment efficacy. Greater age was
      associated with a slight but statistically significant decrease in treatment
      efficacy. Patients with great baseline symptom intensity had greater treatment
      associated improvement but a lesser chance to become symptom-free. Even with a
      large number of patients no statistically significant gender or age associated
      alterations in the tolerability of tolterodine treatment were detected.
      CONCLUSIONS: The extent of the therapeutic response to tolterodine is largely
      determined by the extent of baseline symptoms. While gender does not affect the
      efficacy or tolerability of tolterodine in a clinically relevant manner, advanced
      age is associated with a slight decrease in efficacy but not in tolerability.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial of tolterodine and oxybutynin on tolerability and
      clinical efficacy for treating Chinese women with an overactive bladder.
PG  - 375-80
AB  - Objective To compare the tolerability and clinical efficacy of tolterodine and
      oxybutynin in the treatment of Hong Kong Chinese women with an overactive
      bladder. Patients and methods A randomized controlled trial was conducted at two 
      urogynaecology centres in Hong Kong. In all, 106 women with urodynamically
      confirmed detrusor instability were recruited. Baseline severity assessments
      included a visual analogue scale (VAS), urinary diary and urinary pad-test. The
      women were randomized to receive either oral tolterodine 2 mg or oxybutynin 5 mg 
      twice daily for 10 weeks. Treatment responses were assessed at 4 and 10 weeks
      using the VAS and urinary diary. Treatment tolerability was assessed at baseline,
      4 and 10 weeks using the Xerostomia Questionnaire. A urinary pad-test was
      repeated at 10 weeks. Results The perceived change from baseline VAS was better
      in the tolterodine than the oxybutynin group after 10 weeks of treatment
      (per-protocol analysis, P = 0.043). The two drugs were effective in reducing the 
      symptoms of frequency (P < 0.001). Tolterodine was significantly better than
      oxybutynin in reducing urinary leakage (urinary pad-test; median change - 5.00 g 
      vs 0 g, P = 0.019). Both drugs caused a significant worsening of dry mouth
      (overall dryness, P < 0.005; discomfort, P < 0.005; sleep, P = 0.021; speaking, P
      = 0.045; swallowing, P = 0.004; and liquid consumption, P = 0.017). Conclusions
      Both oxybutynin and tolterodine were effective in ameliorating the severity of
      the symptoms of detrusor instability. Tolterodine was better than oxybutynin in
      both subjective and objective outcome measures, but both drugs caused similar
      worsening of dry mouth that may limit the tolerability of these medications.

TI  - Long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy of extended-release tolterodine in
      the treatment of overactive bladder.
PG  - 588-95
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of the present study was to examine the long-term
      safety, tolerability and efficacy of tolterodine extended-release (ER) in
      patients who had completed 12 weeks' treatment in a randomised, double-blind
      study comparing tolterodine ER 4 mg once daily (qd), tolterodine
      immediate-release (IR) 2mg twice daily and placebo. METHODS: Of the 1377 patients
      completing the 12-week study, a total of 1077 (78%) chose to continue with 12
      months' open-label treatment with tolterodine ER 4 mg once daily, irrespective of
      their previous treatment. Safety was assessed after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months'
      treatment in the study. Efficacy was evaluated from micturition diary variables
      and patients' perception of bladder condition and urgency following 3 and 12
      months' treatment. RESULTS: 71% of patients completed the 12-month study.
      Tolterodine ER was safe and well tolerated. Adverse events of the general
      (14.5%), autonomic (13.2%), gastrointestinal (11.4%), respiratory (9.8%) and
      urinary (9.1%) systems were the most frequently reported. Dry mouth was the most 
      common event, occurring in 12.9% of patients, and was generally mild in severity.
      Other adverse events occurred in less than 5% of patients. There was no increase 
      in the frequency of adverse events with long-term relative to short-term
      treatment. The efficacy of tolterodine was maintained over the 12-month treatment
      period; relative to baseline there were reductions in the number of incontinence 
      episodes per week (median change -83%) and micturitions per 24 hours (median
      change -21%) and an increase in volume voided (median change +25%) after 12
      months' treatment. An improvement in patient perception of their bladder
      condition was found in 75% of patients completing the study, and 51% had an
      improvement in patient perception of urgency. CONCLUSIONS: Tolterodine ER 4mg qd 
      displayed a favourable safety, tolerability and efficacy profile during 12
      months' treatment of patients with overactive bladder.

TI  - Tolterodine: as effective but better tolerated than oxybutynin in Asian patients 
      with symptoms of overactive bladder.
PG  - 247-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: This double-blind, multicenter study compared the efficacy and
      tolerability of tolterodine (Pharmacia, Los Angeles, USA) with that of oxybutynin
      (Alza, Palo Alto, USA) in Asian patients with overactive bladder. METHODS:
      Two-hundred-and-twenty-eight adults with overactive bladder symptoms were
      randomized to receive tolterodine 2 mg twice daily (bid) (n = 112) or oxybutynin 
      5 mg bid (n = 116). After 8 weeks' treatment, changes in micturition diary
      variables, patients' perception of treatment benefit, and tolerability endpoints 
      were determined. RESULTS: The mean (+/- SD) number of micturitions/24 h decreased
      by 2.6 +/- 2.9 (-21%) with tolterodine and 1.8 +/- 4.2 (-15%) with oxybutynin
      (both P = 0.0001 vs baseline). The mean number of incontinence episodes/24 h
      decreased by 2.2 +/- 2.3 (-85%) in the tolterodine group and by 1.4 +/- 1.8
      (-58%) in the oxybutynin group (both P = 0.0001 vs baseline). Patient perception 
      of treatment benefit was over 70% in each treatment group. Adverse events were
      significantly lower in the tolterodine group compared with oxybutynin-treated
      patients (55% vs 82%; P = 0.001). Dry mouth was reported by significantly fewer
      patients on tolterodine, compared with oxybutynin (35% vs 63%; P = 0.001) and
      withdrawals due to adverse events were lower in the tolterodine group than with
      those treated with oxybutynin (10% vs 16%). There were no safety concerns.
      CONCLUSIONS: Tolterodine 2 mg bid is equally or more effective than oxybutynin 5 
      mg bid in the treatment of Asian patients with overactive bladder, and shows
      significantly better tolerability. This may enhance compliance during long-term
      treatment.

TI  - Urinary antispasmodic use and the risks of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden
      death in older patients.
PG  - 117-24
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The introduction of new medications to treat overactive bladder has
      resulted in a significant increase in the number of individuals with this
      condition who use medications for symptoms. Formal epidemiological studies of the
      safety of these medications in typical patient populations are lacking,
      particularly studies of serious events. We sought to determine whether the use of
      urinary antispasmodics increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmias or sudden
      death. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Retrospective analysis of
      data of participants in community, hospital or nursing home setting.
      PARTICIPANTS: Fourteen thousand six hundred thirty-eight subjects with a
      diagnosis of urinary incontinence made between January 1, 1991, and June 30,
      1995; all were aged 65 and older and enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid or the
      Pharmacy Assistance for the Aged and Disabled programs of New Jersey.
      MEASUREMENTS: Filled prescriptions for oxybutynin (Ditropan), flavoxate
      (Urispas), hyoscyamine (Cystospas), and hyoscyamine sulfate (Cystospas-M) were
      used to define days of exposure to these drugs. We also identified all use of
      nonsedating antihistamines and cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors, and their
      concurrent use, to serve as a positive control exposure. Two outcomes were then
      defined: a new diagnosis of ventricular arrhythmia combined with initiation of an
      antiarrhythmic medication and sudden death. Other covariates, including clinical,
      demographic, medication use, and healthcare utilization variables, were also
      assessed. Adjusted risk ratios of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death were
      derived from multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: There was no
      significant association between periods of use of urinary antispasmodics and the 
      development of ventricular arrhythmias (adjusted risk ratio (RR) = 1.23, 95
      confidence interval (CI) = 0.87-1.75) or sudden death (adjusted RR = 0.70, 95% CI
      = 0.28-1.74). A significantly increased risk of ventricular arrhythmia was
      observed for the positive control regimen, concurrent use of nonsedating
      antihistamines and cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (adjusted RR = 5.47; 95% CI =
      1.34-22.26), but not for use of either drug group alone. Concurrent use of
      nonsedating antihistamines and cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors was also associated
      with a significant increase in the risk of sudden death (adjusted RR = 21.50, 95%
      CI = 5.23-88.37). Other variables significantly associated with ventricular
      arrhythmia included ischemic heart disease and congestive heart failure, whereas 
      nursing home use before the index date was associated with a decreased likelihood
      of receiving a diagnosis of and treatment for ventricular arrhythmia. Other
      variables significantly associated with sudden death included male gender, black 
      race, and congestive heart failure. CONCLUSIONS: Antimuscarinic urinary
      antispasmodics available before 1996 were not associated with an increased risk
      of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death. Additional study will be required to
      confirm these results, exclude the possibility of unmeasured confounders
      contributing to any lack of an observed relationship, and extend these findings
      to newer agents such as tolterodine.

TI  - Urodynamic changes associated with behavioral and drug treatment of urge
      incontinence in older women.
PG  - 808-16
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe changes in bladder function and voiding frequency
      associated with behavioral and drug treatment for urge incontinence and to
      examine whether these variables mediate the positive effects of treatment on the 
      frequency of incontinence. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blinded,
      placebo-controlled, clinical trial. Eligible patients were stratified according
      to type of incontinence (urge only vs mixed urge and stress) and severity of
      incontinence (frequency of accidents as documented in bladder diary). SETTING:
      University-based outpatient geriatric medicine clinic. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred 
      five ambulatory, nondemented, community-dwelling women; mean age 67.0 (range
      55-91); 98% white, 2% African American. INTERVENTION: Four sessions (over 8
      weeks) of biofeedback-assisted behavioral training, drug treatment with
      individually-titrated oxybutynin chloride, or a placebo control condition.
      MEASUREMENTS: Two-channel cystometry was performed to determine threshold volumes
      for first desire to void (FDV), strong desire to void (SDV), bladder capacity,
      and the volume at which detrusor instability (DI) or leakage occurred, before
      randomization and after completion of treatment. Two-week bladder diaries were
      used before and after treatment to document episodes of incontinence and voiding 
      frequency. RESULTS: Bladder capacity increased by 68.9 mL in the oxybutynin group
      (P <.001) and 17.3 mL in the behavior group and decreased 6.0 mL in the control
      group. SDV increased 69.9 mL in the oxybutynin group (P <.001), 40.5 in the
      behavior group (P <.05), and 7.8 mL in the control group. FDV increased by 44.4
      mL in the oxybutynin group (P <.001), 18.8 mL in the behavior group, and 8.9 mL
      in the control group. One of seven patients who presented with DI (12.0%)
      resolved in the behavior group, seven of eight (87.5%) resolved in the oxybutynin
      group, and seven of 12 (58.3%) resolved in the control group. These differences
      were not statistically significant. Voiding frequency was significantly reduced
      after treatment in both the behavior and the oxybutynin group. Behavioral
      training resulted in a mean 82.3% reduction in frequency of accidents, oxybutynin
      (final doses 2.5 mg daily to 5 mg three times a day) resulted in a mean 78.3%
      reduction, and the control condition resulted in a mean 51.5% reduction (P
      =.002). Although oxybutynin and behavioral treatment were both effective, and
      oxybutynin increased SDV and bladder capacity, the structural equation modeling
      did not demonstrate that the clinical improvement was mediated through the
      effects of these treatments on urodynamic or voiding frequency measures.
      CONCLUSIONS: Studies using more-complex urodynamics and studies with larger
      sample sizes are needed to better characterize changes in bladder function and
      explore other urodynamic changes that may accompany treatment. In addition, other
      factors, both physiological and behavioral, need to be explored as mechanisms by 
      which conservative therapies improve urge incontinence.

TI  - Efficacy, safety, and tolerability of extended-release once-daily tolterodine
      treatment for overactive bladder in older versus younger patients.
PG  - 799-807
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of a new,
      once-daily extended-release (ER) formulation of tolterodine in treating
      overactive bladder in older (> or =65) and younger (<65) patients. DESIGN: A
      12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. SETTING: An
      international study conducted at 167 medical centers. PARTICIPANTS: One thousand 
      fifteen patients (43.1% aged > or =65) with urge incontinence and urinary
      frequency. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized to treatment with tolterodine
      ER 4 mg once daily (qd) (n = 507) or placebo (n = 508) for 12 weeks.
      MEASUREMENTS: Efficacy, measured with micturition charts (incontinence episodes, 
      micturitions, volume voided per micturition) and subjective patient assessments, 
      safety, and tolerability endpoints were evaluated, relative to placebo, according
      to two age cohorts: younger than 65 and 65 and older. RESULTS: Mean age in the
      older and younger patient cohorts was 74 (range 65-93) and 51 (range 20-64),
      respectively. Compared with placebo, significant improvements in micturition
      chart variables with tolterodine ER showed no age-related differences.
      Irrespective of age, significantly more tolterodine ER recipients than placebo
      recipients reported an improvement in urgency symptoms. After 12 weeks of
      treatment with tolterodine ER, a fivefold increase in the percentage of patients 
      able to finish tasks before voiding in response to urgency was noted in both age 
      groups (<65: from 6.5-32.8%, > or =65: from 5.1-26.2%). Tolterodine ER
      recipients, irrespective of age, also had significant improvements in their
      bladder condition than did placebo recipients. Overall, a greater percentage of
      patients, irrespective of age, perceived any benefit with tolterodine ER than
      with placebo (P <.001). Dry mouth (of any severity) was the most common adverse
      event in both the tolterodine ER and placebo treatment arms, irrespective of age 
      (<65: ER 22.7%, placebo 8.1%; > or =65: ER 24.3%, placebo 7.2%). Few patients
      (<2%) experienced severe dry mouth. No central nervous system, visual, cardiac
      (per electrocardiogram), or laboratory safety concerns were noted. Withdrawal
      rates due to adverse events on tolterodine ER 4 mg qd were comparable in the two 
      age cohorts (<65: 5.5%; > or =65: 5.1%; P =.87). CONCLUSIONS: The new, once-daily
      ER formulation of tolterodine is efficacious, safe, and well tolerated in the
      treatment of patients with symptoms of overactive bladder, irrespective of age.

TI  - A multicenter, prospective, open-label study of tolterodine extended-release 4 mg
      for overactive bladder: the speed of onset of therapeutic assessment trial
      (STAT).
PG  - 616-28
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimuscarinic agents are the primary treatment for overactive
      bladder (OAB), but there is a lack of information regarding when maximum symptom 
      relief and maximum perceived patient benefit occur. OBJECTIVE: This study
      assessed the speed of onset of therapeutic benefit with tolterodine
      extended-release (ER) 4 mg. METHODS: This 12-week, multicenter, prospective,
      open-label study enrolled patients with OAB who either had received no previous
      pharmacologic treatment for OAB (drug naive) or were receiving such treatment at 
      enrollment (previously treated). Efficacy was assessed at 1, 4, and 12 weeks
      using a micturition diary and measures of patients' and physicians' perceptions
      of improvement. Safety was assessed in terms of adverse events and study
      withdrawals. RESULTS: The intent-to-treat population included 1138 patients (302 
      men, 836 women; 88.4% white; age range, 18-91 years), 735 drug naive and 403
      receiving treatment for OAB at enrollment. After 1 week, tolterodine ER 4 mg had 
      produced a significant improvement in all efficacy variables in both groups of
      patients (P < 0.01); 72% of the maximum effect on urge incontinence was observed 
      in both groups; and 84.7% of drug-naive patients and 83.6% of previously treated 
      patients perceived a benefit from treatment. After 4 weeks, drug-naive and
      previously treated patients reported a respective 93% and 100% of the maximum
      effect on episodes of urge incontinence. Tolterodine was well tolerated, with dry
      mouth (mostly mild) the most commonly reported adverse event (15.5% in each
      group). The 330 (81.9%) patients who had reported unacceptable efficacy and the
      87 (21.6%) patients who had reported unacceptable tolerability of previous OAB
      treatment responded favorably to tolterodine ER 4 mg. CONCLUSIONS: Tolterodine ER
      4 mg was effective and well tolerated in both drug-naive and previously treated
      patients with OAB. More than 80% of patients reported benefit from treatment
      after 1 week, but maximum symptom relief was achieved with longer treatment.

TI  - Safety profile of tolterodine as used in general practice in England: results of 
      prescription-event monitoring.
PG  - 703-13
AB  - BACKGROUND: Unstable bladder symptoms are a common problem in general practice.
      Drug therapy with anticholinergic drugs is frequently used in the management of
      this condition. However such drugs are associated with a high incidence of
      anticholinergic adverse effects. Tolterodine is a competitive anticholinergic
      agent, selective for the bladder as opposed to the salivary glands. OBJECTIVE: To
      monitor the safety of tolterodine as used in general practice patients in England
      for the treatment of urinary frequency, urgency and incontinence. DESIGN:
      Prospective observational cohort study. Patients and participants: 14,526
      patients [mean age 62.7 (SD 16.4) years; 68.6% female]. METHODS: Patients
      prescribed tolterodine in general practice, soon after the release of the drug in
      the UK, were followed up for a minimum of 6 months using the technique of
      prescription-event monitoring (PEM). RESULTS: The most common adverse events
      reported were dry mouth, headache, malaise, constipation, dyspepsia, nausea and
      vomiting and pain in abdomen. We identified some uncommon events as possible
      adverse drug reactions--notably hallucinations, tachycardia and palpitations. The
      prevalence of these events was compared with that in patient cohorts for other
      drugs on the PEM database. The age- and sex-adjusted relative risk of
      hallucinations on tolterodine compared with 10 drugs of other therapeutic
      classes, and with terodiline, another drug indicated for bladder instability, was
      4.85 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.72 to 8.66] and 1.25 (95% CI 0.62 to 2.53), 
      respectively. There was no significant difference for tachycardia/palpitation in 
      this comparison. CONCLUSIONS: Tolterodine is well tolerated in general practice
      at the recommended daily dose. Hallucinations, tachycardia and palpitations are
      infrequently associated with the drug.

      Ireland. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and seventy-seven older patients (age > or =65
      years) with symptoms of urinary urgency, increased frequency of micturition (> or
      =8 micturitions/24 hours), and/or urge incontinence (> or =1 episode/24 hours).
      INTERVENTION: Tolterodine 1 mg or 2 mg twice daily (bid), or placebo, for 4
      weeks. MEASUREMENTS: Safety and tolerability were evaluated through spontaneously
      reported adverse events, electrocardiogram, and blood pressure measurements.
      Efficacy was assessed using micturition diary variables: mean change from
      baseline in frequency of micturition and number of incontinence episodes/24
      hours. RESULTS: The mean age of the patient population was 75 years. Overall, >
      or =87% of patients completed the study. Neither dosage of tolterodine was
      associated with serious drug-related adverse events during the study. No cardiac 
      arrythmogenic events were noted. Dry mouth (mild to moderate intensity) was the
      most common adverse event in both the placebo and tolterodine treatment groups.
      Three percent of patients in the tolterodine 2 mg bid group discontinued
      treatment because of dry mouth, compared with 2% of placebo-treated patients.
      Compared with placebo, statistically significant decreases in micturition
      frequency were apparent in both tolterodine treatment groups. Furthermore,
      patients treated with tolterodine 2 mg bid had statistically significant
      decreases in urge incontinence episodes/24 hours and increases in volume voided
      per micturition compared with placebo. CONCLUSION: Tolterodine (taken for 4
      weeks) is safe and shows efficacy, particularly at a dosage of 2 mg bid, in the
      treatment of older patients with urinary symptoms attributable to overactive
      bladder.

TI  - A crossover randomized trial of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and
      oxybutynin in patients with detrusor instability.
PG  - 146-9
AB  - PURPOSE: Management of idiopathic detrusor instability is difficult in most
      patients mainly due to the lack of a complete understanding of the
      pathophysiology. Oxybutynin and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation have 
      been used but to our knowledge no direct comparisons have been made. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: Patients with frequency, urgency, urge incontinence and proved
      detrusor instability were studied with urodynamics, quality of life instruments, 
      and frequency and volume charts. Patients were randomized to transcutaneous
      electrical nerve stimulation or oxybutynin. After 6 weeks of treatment, they were
      reassessed and after a washout of 2 weeks, they were started on the second arm of
      treatment and reassessed 6 weeks later. RESULTS: A total of 13 male and 30 female
      patients were studied. Functional capacity had increased and number of voids
      daily had decreased significantly compared with before treatment in both arms (p 
      <0.005). There were significant improvements in symptom specific quality of life 
      measures but no changes were found on the global Short Form 36 (SF-36) quality of
      life questionnaire. The volume to first desire to void and first unstable
      contraction had increased significantly with oxybutynin but not with
      transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. Of 23 patients 7 were stabilized
      with treatment, including 2 with oxybutynin only, 2 with either nerve stimulation
      or oxybutynin and the remaining 3 with only nerve stimulation. Total bladder
      capacity did not change significantly with either treatment but patients noticed 
      side effects more commonly with oxybutynin. CONCLUSIONS: Both treatments clearly 
      improved subjective parameters. However, only oxybutynin showed significant
      improvements in objective urodynamic parameters. Transcutaneous electrical nerve 
      stimulation can be used in patients who cannot take oxybutynin. Further studies
      are needed to show the long-term efficacy and cost analyses of nerve stimulation.

TI  - Treatment of overactive bladder: long-term tolerability and efficacy of
      tolterodine.
PG  - 141-7
AB  - Previously available antimuscarinic therapies for overactive bladder are poorly
      tolerated due to a high incidence of adverse events, notably dry mouth.
      Tolterodine is a bladder-selective, antimuscarinic agent for the treatment of
      frequency, urgency, and urge incontinence that characterize overactive bladder.
      In a 9-month open-label study, the safety, tolerability, and clinical efficacy of
      tolterodine 2 mg twice daily was evaluated in 854 patients with overactive
      bladder symptoms who had completed one of four 12 week randomized, controlled
      trials of tolterodine. Safety and tolerability were assessed in terms of adverse 
      events and clinical/laboratory variables. Efficacy was assessed using micturition
      diaries and patient perception of their bladder condition. In all, 70% of
      patients remained on treatment for 9 months. Dry mouth was the most frequently
      reported adverse event, occurring in 28% of patients (intensity: 19% mild, 7%
      moderate, 2% severe). A total of 9% of patients withdrew due to adverse events.
      Dosage reduction occurred in 13% of patients. Significant improvements (P <
      0.0001) in micturitions per 24 h (-22%), urge incontinence episodes per 24 h
      (-76%) and volume voided per micturition (+22%) were observed after 9 months of
      treatment, with 65% of patients reporting an improvement in perception of their
      bladder problems. The incidence of adverse events and improvements in micturition
      diary variables during open-label treatment were comparable with those observed
      during a 12 week randomized treatment. It was concluded that tolterodine is well 
      tolerated and maintains its clinical efficacy during 9 months of treatment. The
      high proportion of patients remaining on treatment indicates that tolterodine is 
      an effective long-term treatment for overactive bladder.

TI  - Tolterodine: superior tolerability than and comparable efficacy to oxybutynin in 
      individuals 50 years old or older with overactive bladder: a randomized
      controlled trial.
PG  - 1452-6
AB  - PURPOSE: We compared the tolerability and clinical efficacy of tolterodine with
      those of oxybutynin in patients with an overactive bladder using an upward
      oxybutynin dose titration strategy analogous to that used in routine clinical
      practice in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In
      a randomized double-blind trial 378 male and female patients 50 years old or
      older with symptoms of overactive bladder (a urinary frequency of 8 or more voids
      per 24 hours with urgency and/or urge incontinence, that is 1 or more urge
      incontinence episodes per 24 hours) received 10 weeks of treatment with 2 mg.
      tolterodine twice daily/or an initial dose of 2.5 mg. oxybutynin twice daily,
      increasing to 5 mg. twice daily after 2 weeks of treatment. The main outcome
      measures were changes in voiding diary variables combined with detailed
      tolerability-safety assessments. RESULTS: Patients treated with tolterodine had
      significantly fewer adverse events (69% versus 81%, p = 0.01), notably dry mouth 
      (37% versus 61%, p <0.0001), as well as a lower incidence of dose reduction (6%
      versus 25%, p <0.0001) than those in the oxybutynin group. Each agent had
      comparable efficacy for improving urinary symptoms. Tolterodine and oxybutynin
      caused a significant decrease (p = 0.0001) in the mean number of voids per 24
      hours (-1.7 or -15% and -1.7 or -15%, respectively), urge incontinence episodes
      per 24 hours (-1.3 or -54% and -1.8 or -62%, respectively) and mean voided volume
      per void (33 ml. or 22% and 34 ml. or 23%) after 10 weeks of treatment.
      CONCLUSIONS: Tolterodine is as effective as oxybutynin for improving the symptoms
      of overactive bladder but it has superior tolerability. The combination of these 
      qualities makes tolterodine the preferred pharmacological therapy for the
      long-term treatment of this condition.

TI  - Prospective randomized controlled trial of extended-release oxybutynin chloride
      and tolterodine tartrate in the treatment of overactive bladder: results of the
      OBJECT Study.
PG  - 358-63
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and tolerability of extended-release
      oxybutynin chloride and tolterodine tartrate at 12 weeks in participants with
      overactive bladder. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The OBJECT (Overactive Bladder: Judging
      Effective Control and Treatment) study was a prospective, randomized,
      double-blind, parallel-group study conducted between March and October 2000 at 37
      US study sites. Participants who had between 7 and 50 episodes of urge
      incontinence per week and 10 or more voids in 24 hours received extended-release 
      oxybutynin, 10 mg/d, or tolterodine, 2 mg twice daily. The outcome measures were 
      the number of episodes of urge incontinence, total incontinence, and micturition 
      frequency at 12 weeks adjusted for baseline. RESULTS: A total of 315 women and 63
      men were randomized and treated, and 332 participants (276 women, 56 men)
      completed the study. At the end of the study, extended-release oxybutynin was
      significantly more effective than tolterodine in each of the main outcome
      measures: weekly urge incontinence (P=.03), total incontinence (P=.02), and
      micturition frequency episodes (P=.02) adjusted for baseline. Both drugs improved
      symptoms of overactive bladder significantly from baseline to the end of the
      study as assessed by the 3 main outcome measures (P<.001). Dry mouth, the most
      common adverse event, was reported by 28.1% and 33.2% of participants taking
      extended-release oxybutynin and tolterodine, respectively (P=.32). Rates of
      central nervous system and other adverse events were low and similar in both
      groups. CONCLUSIONS: Extended-release oxybutynin was more effective than
      tolterodine as measured by end-of-study urge incontinence, total incontinence,
      and micturition frequency episodes. Both groups had similar rates of dry mouth
      and other adverse events.

TI  - Tolterodine once-daily: superior efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of
      the overactive bladder.
PG  - 414-21
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a new extended-release
      (ER), once-daily, capsule formulation of tolterodine, relative to placebo and the
      existing immediate-release (IR), twice-daily, tablet formulation, for treatment
      of the overactive bladder. METHODS: This was a double-blind, multicenter,
      randomized, placebo-controlled trial. One thousand five hundred twenty-nine
      patients (81% women) with urinary frequency (eight or more micturitions every 24 
      hours) and urge incontinence (five or more episodes per week) were randomized to 
      oral therapy with tolterodine ER 4 mg once daily (n = 507), tolterodine IR 2 mg
      twice daily (n = 514), or placebo (n = 508) for 12 weeks. Efficacy was assessed
      at the end of the treatment period on the basis of the micturition diary
      variables. Tolerability and safety were assessed by evaluating the adverse
      events, electrocardiogram parameters, laboratory values, and treatment
      withdrawals. RESULTS: Tolterodine ER 4 mg once daily (P = 0.0001) and tolterodine
      IR 2 mg twice daily (P = 0.0005) both significantly reduced the mean number of
      urge incontinence episodes per week compared with placebo. The median reduction
      in these episodes as a percentage of the baseline values was 71% for tolterodine 
      ER, 60% for tolterodine IR, and 33% for placebo. The ER formulation was 18% more 
      effective than the IR formulation (P <0.05). Treatment with both formulations of 
      tolterodine was also associated with statistically significant improvements in
      all other micturition diary variables compared with placebo. For both
      formulations, the mean decreases in micturition frequency (P <0.0079) and pad
      usage (P <0.0145) were significant, and the mean volume voided per micturition
      increased (P = 0.0001). The rate of dry mouth (of any severity) was 23% for
      tolterodine ER, 30% for tolterodine IR, and 8% for placebo. The overall dry mouth
      rate for patients taking tolterodine ER was 23% lower than for tolterodine IR (P 
      <0.02), and the rate of severe dry mouth in the ER group was only 1.8%. The rates
      of withdrawal were comparable for the two active groups and the placebo group. No
      safety concerns were noted. CONCLUSIONS: Tolterodine ER 4 mg once daily is
      effective and well tolerated in the treatment of overactive bladder with no
      safety concerns. Tolterodine ER demonstrated an improved efficacy for reducing
      urge incontinence episodes and a lower frequency of dry mouth compared with the
      existing IR twice-daily formulation.

TI  - Neonatal outcome of infants born at 23 weeks' gestation.
PG  - 49-52
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the neonatal outcome in accurately dated 23-week
      deliveries. METHODS: We reviewed the records of consecutive births between 23 0/7
      and 23 6/7 weeks at Brigham & Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, from
      January 1995 to December 1999. Women were excluded if they presented for elective
      termination or had known fetal death or poor dating criteria. Neonatal records
      were abstracted for mortality and short-term morbidity, including the respiratory
      distress syndrome (RDS), intraventricular hemorrhage, chronic lung disease,
      necrotizing enterocolitis, periventricular leukomalacia, and retinopathy of
      prematurity. Survival was defined as discharge from neonatal intensive care.
      RESULTS: Thirty-three singleton pregnancies met criteria for inclusion, 11 of
      whom survived to discharge (survival rate 0.33; 95% CI 0.18, 0.52). More advanced
      gestational age was associated with increased likelihood of survival: 0 of 12 at 
      23 0/7 to 23 2/7 weeks, 4 of 10 at 23 3/7 to 23 4/7 weeks, and 7 of 11 at 23 5/7 
      to 23 6/7 weeks (P =.02). All 11 survivors developed RDS and chronic lung
      disease. One of 11 survivors had necrotizing enterocolitis, and 2 of 11 had
      severe retinopathy of prematurity. One survivor had periventricular leukomalacia 
      on head ultrasonography, compared with 7 of the nonsurvivors who had head
      ultrasonography (P =.03). One survivor developed severe intraventricular
      hemorrhage (grade 3 or 4) compared with 8 of the 12 at-risk nonsurvivors who had 
      head ultrasonography (P =.01). CONCLUSION: About one third of infants delivered
      at 23 weeks' gestation survived to be discharged from neonatal intensive care.
      More advanced gestational age was associated with increased likelihood of
      survival. No neonates survived free of substantial morbidity.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial comparing the efficacy of controlled-release
      oxybutynin tablets (10 mg once daily) with conventional oxybutynin tablets (5 mg 
      twice daily) in patients whose symptoms were stabilized on 5 mg twice daily of
      oxybutynin.
PG  - 793-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of a controlled-release (CR) formulation of
      oxybutynin with that of conventional oxybutynin in patients with detrusor
      instability or detrusor hyper-reflexia whose symptoms were stabilized on
      conventional oral oxybutynin tablets. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study comprised a
      randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial involving 130 patients drawn from 
      15 centres in the UK. The study was of 6 weeks' duration, i.e. 2 weeks of
      screening whilst taking conventional oxybutynin tablets (5 mg twice daily)
      followed by 4 weeks of double-blind treatment with either CR oxybutynin tablets
      (10 mg once daily) or conventional oxybutynin tablets (5 mg twice daily). Outcome
      measures were changes in 24-h frequency and 24-h incontinence episodes recorded
      throughout the study on diary charts. Adverse events were recorded by patients in
      their diary charts and serum concentrations of oxybutynin and its active
      metabolite, N-desethyloxybutynin, were measured at baseline and at completion of 
      the study to detect possible drug accumulation. RESULTS: The treatments did not
      differ significantly in any of the outcome measures. The primary efficacy
      criterion was the daytime continence at completion of the study; 53% and 58% of
      patients were continent on CR and conventional oxybutynin treatments,
      respectively (the 95% confidence interval of the difference in the proportion
      being - 22% to 13%; P = 0.62). The total number of side-effects experienced by
      those patients receiving treatment with the CR formulation was 57% of that for
      patients receiving treatment with conventional oxybutynin. Individual
      side-effects showed a similar distribution within treatment groups. There was no 
      evidence of the accumulation of oxybutynin or N-desethyloxybutynin during the
      multiple dosing of CR or conventional oxybutynin tablets. CONCLUSION: The CR and 
      conventional formulations of oxybutynin did not differ in their efficacy, and the
      CR formulation was associated with fewer side-effects. In addition, CR oxybutynin
      appeared to maintain therapeutic blood levels over the 24 h dosing interval with 
      no accumulation of oxybutynin or its active metabolite. Once-daily dosing with a 
      CR tablet is seen as convenient for the patient and is expected to result in
      improved compliance in patients already stabilized on conventional oxybutynin
      treatment.

TI  - Dry mouth with conventional and controlled-release oxybutynin in urinary
      incontinence. The Ditropan XL Study Group.
PG  - 718-21
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of controlled-release oxybutynin
      with conventional, immediate-release oxybutynin and determine rates of dry mouth.
      METHODS: Patients (n = 226) who were known to be responsive to anticholinergic
      therapy and who had seven or more urge incontinence episodes per week were
      randomized to receive controlled-release oxybutynin or immediate-release
      oxybutynin. After an initial placebo run-in period, dosing in each began at 5 mg 
      per day and increased weekly by 5 mg per day to a maximum of 20 mg per day or
      when a balance between improvement of incontinence symptoms and tolerability of
      side effects was achieved. Rates of urge incontinence and dry mouth were
      compared. Post hoc Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to describe
      elimination of incontinence episodes by dose and to analyze dry mouth risk by
      dose. RESULTS: Reductions in urge urinary incontinence episodes from baseline to 
      the end of treatment were 18.6 to 2.9 per week (83% mean decrease) and 19.8 to
      4.4 per week (76% mean decrease) in the controlled- and immediate-release
      oxybutynin groups (P =.36), respectively. At equal doses, comparable proportions 
      of patients in both groups reported the absence of urge incontinence (P =.85).
      The incidence of dry mouth increased with dose in both groups, but there was no
      difference in dry mouth rates between the groups: 47.7% and 59.1% for the
      controlled- and immediate-release oxybutynin (P =.09), respectively. However,
      Kaplan-Meier analysis to examine first report of dry mouth at a given dose
      revealed that a significantly lower proportion of patients taking
      controlled-release oxybutynin had moderate to severe dry mouth (P =.007) or any
      dry mouth (P =.003) compared with those taking immediate-release oxybutynin.
      CONCLUSION: At the same daily dose, controlled- and immediate-release oxybutynin 
      demonstrated comparable efficacy in reduction of urge incontinence episodes. The 
      incidence of dry mouth was dose dependent but equal in both groups; first report 
      of moderate to severe dry mouth was significantly lower in the controlled-release
      group.

TI  - Immediate-release oxybutynin versus tolterodine in detrusor overactivity: a
      population analysis.
PG  - 470-5
AB  - We evaluated adherence to treatment with immediate-release (IR) oxybutynin (515
      patients) and tolterodine (505 patients) for detrusor overactivity through
      retrospective analysis of a pharmacy claims database. Outcomes included
      percentage of patients continuing therapy for 6 months, medication possession
      ratios, and time to discontinuation of therapy. The proportion of patients
      continuing therapy for 6 months was statistically superior for tolterodine (32%) 
      compared with IR oxybutynin (22%, p<0.001). Medication possession ratios were
      also superior for patients in the tolterodine group (medians 0.83 and 0.64,
      ranges 0.11-1.15 and 0.07-1.13, respectively, p<0.001). Oxybutynin was
      discontinued significantly earlier (mean 45 days) than tolterodine (mean 59 days,
      p<0.001) and was switched to another therapy more commonly than tolterodine (19% 
      and 14%, respectively). Tolterodine was favored over oxybutynin for several
      measurements of patient adherence. However, less than one-third of patients
      continued therapy with either agent for 6 months. The clinical relevance of these
      differences is unknown.

TI  - Efficacy of trospium chloride in patients with detrusor instability: a
      placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, multicentre clinical trial.
PG  - 659-64
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of trospium chloride (TCl, 20 mg
      twice daily) in the treatment of detrusor instability, compared with placebo.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, 208 patients were allocated at random to either TCl
      or placebo in a double-blind clinical study; the patients were treated for 3
      weeks. Urodynamic values were measured at the beginning and end of the treatment 
      period. Adverse events were recorded on patient diary cards. A confirmatory
      adaptive procedure with one planned interim analysis was used to evaluate
      efficacy. RESULTS: Trospium chloride produced significant improvements in maximum
      cystometric bladder capacity (median treatment effect 22.0 mL, mean 37.3 mL,
      one-sided P = 0. 0054) and urinary volume at first unstable contraction (median
      treatment effect 45.0 mL, mean 63.6 mL, one-sided P = 0.0015). The patients'
      assessment of efficacy showed significantly greater clinical improvement in the
      TCl group than in the placebo group (two-sided P = 0.0047). Furthermore, TCl was 
      well tolerated, with similar frequencies of adverse events reported in both
      groups (68% in the TCl and 62% in the placebo group). CONCLUSION: Trospium
      chloride (20 mg twice daily) is an effective and safe option for the treatment of
      detrusor instability.

TI  - Pregnancy outcomes in healthy nulliparas who developed hypertension. Calcium for 
      Preeclampsia Prevention Study Group.
PG  - 24-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine maternal and perinatal outcomes in nulliparas with
      pregnancy-associated hypertension or preeclampsia. METHODS: We conducted (and
      reported elsewhere) a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial calcium
      supplementation of 4589 healthy nulliparas assigned at 13-21 weeks' gestation.
      This well-defined and characterized data set provided an opportunity to detail
      more precisely adverse maternal, fetal, and newborn outcomes in women who
      developed hypertension among a prospective series of healthy nulliparas. RESULTS:
      Of 4302 women observed to or beyond 20 weeks' gestation, 1073 (24.9%) developed
      mild or severe pregnancy-associated hypertension or preeclampsia. One hundred
      sixteen women of the 1073 with hypertension (10.8%) and 336 of the 3229 without
      hypertension (10.4%) were delivered before 37 weeks' gestation. Fetal and
      neonatal mortality were similar in those groups; however, selected maternal and
      newborn morbidities were significantly greater in women with hypertension.
      Significantly increased maternal morbidities included increased cesarean
      deliveries, abruptio placentae, and acute renal dysfunction; and significantly
      increased perinatal morbidities included respiratory distress syndrome,
      ventilatory support, and fetal growth restriction. Adverse outcomes were highest 
      in women with severe pregnancy-associated hypertension or preeclampsia.
      CONCLUSION: Hypertension, especially severe hypertension, was associated with an 
      appreciable increase in important maternal and perinatal morbidity but not
      perinatal mortality.

TI  - Ketoconazole inhibits the metabolism of tolterodine in subjects with deficient
      CYP2D6 activity.
PG  - 564-72
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the pharmacokinetics and safety of tolterodine and
      tolterodine metabolites after single-and multiple-dose administration in the
      absence and presence of ketoconazole, an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, 
      in healthy volunteers with deficient CYP2D6 activity, i.e. poor metabolisers of
      debrisoquine. METHODS: Eight healthy volunteers received single oral doses (2 mg)
      of tolterodine l-tartrate. Following a wash-out period of about 3 months, six of 
      the subjects participated in a multiple-dose (1 mg twice daily) phase of the
      study. Ketoconazole 200 mg was given once daily for 4-4.5 days during both the
      single and multiple dose tolterodine administration phases. Blood samples were
      drawn and the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine and its metabolites were
      determined. RESULTS: A decrease (P<0.01) in apparent oral clearance of
      tolterodine, from 10- 12 l h-1 to 4.3-4.7 l h-1, was obtained during concomitant 
      administration of ketoconazole, yielding at least a two-fold increase in the area
      under the serum concentration-time curve after single as well as after multiple
      doses following single dose administration of tolterodine. The mean (+/-s.d.)
      terminal half-life increased by 50% from 9.7+/-2.7 h to 15+/-5.4 h in the
      presence of ketoconazole. CONCLUSIONS: CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in the
      elimination of tolterodine in individuals with deficient CYP2D6 activity (poor
      metabolisers), since oral clearance of tolterodine decreased by 60% during
      ketoconazole coadministration. This inhibition resulted in 2.1-fold increase in
      AUC.

TI  - Fluoxetine inhibits the metabolism of tolterodine-pharmacokinetic implications
      and proposed clinical relevance.
PG  - 553-63
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the change in disposition of tolterodine during
      coadministration of the potent cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) inhibitor fluoxetine.
      METHODS: Thirteen patients received tolterodine l-tartrate 2 mg twice daily for
      2.5 days, followed by fluoxetine 20 mg once daily for 3 weeks and then
      concomitant administration for an additional 2.5 days. They were characterized as
      extensive metabolizers (EM1 with one functional CYP2D6 gene, EM2 with two
      functional genes) or poor metabolizers (PM). RESULTS: Nine patients, three EM2
      and four EM1 and two PM, completed the trial. Following tolterodine
      administration, the area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) of
      tolterodine was 4.4-times and 30-times higher among EM1 and PM, respectively,
      compared with EM2. The AUC of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite (5-HM) was not
      quantifiable in PM. Fluoxetine significantly decreased (P<0.002) the oral
      clearance of tolterodine by 93% in EM2 and by 80% in EM1. The AUC of 5-HM
      increased in EM2 and decreased in EM1. However, the exposure to the active moiety
      (unbound tolterodine +5-HM) was not significantly increased in the two
      phenotypes. The subdivision of the EM group showed a 2.1-fold increase in active 
      moiety in EM2 but the exposure was still similar to EM1 compared with before the 
      interaction. CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests a difference in the pharmacokinetics
      of tolterodine and its 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite depending on the number of
      functional CYP2D6 genes. Fluoxetine significantly inhibited the hydroxylation of 
      tolterodine. Despite the effect on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine in
      extensive metabolizers, the clinical effect is expected to be within normal
      variation.

      patients with overactive bladder.
PG  - 283-9
AB  - This study compared the clinical efficacy (determined from micturition diaries)
      and safety of 12 weeks' treatment with either tolterodine 2 mg twice daily,
      oxybutynin 5 mg three times daily or placebo in patients with an overactive
      bladder. A total of 277 patients were randomized and treated at 25 centers. Both 
      tolterodine and oxybutynin significantly increased volume voided/micturition
      compared to placebo. Both treatment groups evoked greater decreases in
      micturitions per 24 hours and incontinence episodes per 24 hours compared to
      placebo; however, only tolterodine was significantly better than placebo in
      reducing micturition frequency. Tolterodine and oxybutynin were equivalent in
      their effectiveness. Tolterodine was significantly better tolerated than
      oxybutynin when adverse events (particularly frequency and intensity of dry
      mouth), dose reduction and patient withdrawals were considered. Oxybutynin is an 
      effective drug whose frequent adverse effects limit its clinical usefulness.
      Tolterodine has equivalent efficacy to oxybutynin, but with less severe adverse
      effects. This will allow patients to receive more effective treatment for their
      condition, with better compliance.

TI  - A placebo-controlled, multicentre study comparing the tolerability and efficacy
      of propiverine and oxybutynin in patients with urgency and urge incontinence.
PG  - 646-51
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the tolerability and efficacy of propiverine and oxybutynin 
      in patients with urgency and urge incontinence in a randomized, double-blind
      placebo-controlled clinical trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, 366 patients
      (149 on propiverine, 145 oxybutynin and 72 placebo, ratio 2:2:1) with urgency and
      urge incontinence were recruited in 32 study centres. Propiverine (group 1, 15 mg
      three times daily), oxybutynin (group 2, 5 mg twice daily) or placebo (group 3)
      were administered for 4 weeks, using the double-dummy technique. The dosages were
      selected specifically to compare the tolerability profile of propiverine with the
      commonly used therapeutic dosage of oxybutynin. Tolerability was assessed by
      directly questioning the patients about adverse events at four visits (V-1 before
      and V0 after a 1-week 'washout' period, V1 after 1 week and V4 after 4 weeks of
      treatment) during a 5-week surveillance period, and by tolerability ratings of
      the physicians. Efficacy was assessed using urodynamics at V0 and V4, evaluating 
      the cystometric bladder capacity at maximal and first desire to void, and
      postvoid residual urine, according to the criteria of the International
      Continence Society. Additionally, a voiding protocol, overall assessment of
      clinical symptomatology and efficacy ratings by the physicians were documented.
      RESULTS: A remarkably high percentage of adverse events was reported in the
      washout period (VO: 13%, 16% and 18% in groups 1-3, respectively). At V4, the
      clinically most relevant symptom (dry mouth) occurred in 53% of patients in group
      1, in 67% of group 2 and in 28% of group 3. Furthermore, dry mouth was less
      severe in group 1 than group 2. In contrast to groups 2 and 3, only patients in
      group 1 showed increasing tolerability during the treatment (from V1 to V4).
      These tolerability results were further supported by the overall tolerability
      assessment ('very good' or 'good' tolerability in 67% of group 1, in 59% of group
      2 and in 83% of group 3). The urodynamic assessment of efficacy (comparing V0 and
      V4) showed a statistically significant increase in the mean (sd) maximal
      cystometric bladder capacity in group 1, being 222 (77) mL at V0 and 311 (125) mL
      at V4, an increase of 89 (108) mL, and in group 2, at 226 (75) mL and 322 (123)
      mL, an increase of 96 (106) mL, compared with group 3, at 211 (77) mL and 263
      (93) mL, an increase of only 52 (92) mL. The cystometric bladder capacity at
      first desire to void also increased in group 1 (93 to 160 mL) and group 2 (89 to 
      160 mL), whereas in group 3 there were only minor changes (93 to 120 mL). Changes
      in the residual urine volume within and between the treatment groups were minimal
      and clinically irrelevant. The overall assessment of efficacy showed significant 
      differences between the drugs when compared with placebo. CONCLUSION: Propiverine
      is a safe and effective drug in the treatment of urgency and urge incontinence;
      it is as effective as oxybutynin, but the incidence of dry mouth and its severity
      is less with propiverine than with oxybutynin. The availability of alternative
      pharmacotherapeutics such as propiverine should reduce the therapeutic failure
      rate and improves the success rate in the treatment of patients suffering from
      urgency and urge incontinence.

TI  - Evaluation of a new once-daily formulation of oxbutynin for the treatment of
      urinary urge incontinence. Ditropan XL Study Group.
PG  - 420-3
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate in a 1 6-center, single-treatment study once-daily
      controlled-release oxybutynin (Ditropan XL) for urinary urge incontinence.
      METHODS: Two hundred fifty-six participants with urge incontinence or mixed
      incontinence with a significant urge component were treated. After baseline
      measurements, participants converting from conventional oxybutynin started
      Ditropan XL at their previous oxybutynin dose; others started at 5 mg/day. Doses 
      were adjusted until participants reached a maintenance dose that produced
      continence or the best balance between continence and side effects. This dose was
      continued for 12 weeks. Effectiveness was assessed by urinary diaries. RESULTS:
      Effectiveness was achieved across all doses studied (5 to 30 mg/day), with 70.8% 
      of participants using maintenance doses of 5 to 15 mg/day. Mean urge incontinence
      episodes per week decreased from 18.8 at baseline to 3.9 in maintenance week 1,
      2.7 in week 4, and 2.8 at the end of the study. For those participants who
      reported urge incontinence episodes at baseline but were free of urge
      incontinence at maintenance week 1, 31% remained free of urge incontinence at
      every subsequent assessment. Participants who converted from other medications
      showed symptomatic improvement after conversion. At some time during the study,
      58.6% of participants reported dry mouth, with 23.0% of participants rating it
      moderate or severe. Only 1.6% of participants discontinued the medication because
      of dry mouth. CONCLUSIONS: Ditropan XL treatment reduced the number of
      incontinence episodes. Maximum benefit was demonstrated by maintenance week 4 and
      was sustained through 12 weeks of maintenance therapy.

TI  - Once daily controlled versus immediate release oxybutynin chloride for urge
      urinary incontinence. OROS Oxybutynin Study Group.
PG  - 1809-12
AB  - PURPOSE: We compared the efficacy and safety of once daily controlled and
      immediate release oxybutynin for incontinence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This
      multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active control, parallel study was
      designed to evaluate urge urinary incontinence episodes using a 7-day diary.
      RESULTS: A total of 97 women and 8 men 34 to 76 years old with urge incontinence 
      or mixed incontinence with a clinically significant urge component were enrolled 
      in the study. The number of weekly urge incontinence episodes decreased from 27.4
      to 4.8 after controlled and from 23.4 to 3.1 after immediate release oxybutynin
      (p = 0.56), and total incontinence episodes decreased from 29.3 to 6 and from
      26.3 to 3.8, respectively (p = 0.6). Weekly urge incontinence episodes from
      baseline to end of study also decreased to 84% after controlled and 88% after
      immediate release oxybutynin (p = 0.7). Continence was achieved in 41% of the
      controlled and 40% of the immediate release group (p = 0.9). Dry mouth of any
      severity was reported by 68 and 87% of the controlled and immediate release
      groups, respectively (p = 0.04), and moderate or severe dry mouth occurred in 25 
      and 46%, respectively (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Participants taking a single daily
      does of controlled release oxybutynin had similar reductions in urge incontinence
      and total incontinence episodes compared to those taking oxybutynin 1 to 4 times 
      daily. A lower incidence of dry mouth was reported for controlled release
      oxybutynin.

TI  - Clinical efficacy and safety of tolterodine compared to placebo in detrusor
      overactivity.
PG  - 1551-5
AB  - PURPOSE: We evaluated the efficacy, patient acceptability and side effect profile
      of tolterodine, a new antimuscarinic agent for treating bladder overactivity.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: In our randomized, placebo controlled, parallel group
      study 123, 129 and 64 patients 18 years old or older with proved detrusor
      overactivity (idiopathic detrusor instability or detrusor hyperreflexia) were
      randomized to receive 1 or 2 mg. tolterodine, or placebo, respectively, twice
      daily for 12 weeks. Main outcome measures were number of voids per 24 hours,
      urine volume per void and episodes of urge incontinence per 24 hours on a
      frequency-volume chart with detailed recording of side effects. RESULTS: After 12
      weeks of treatment mean number of voids per 24 hours plus or minus standard
      deviation decreased from 11.2 +/- 3.1 to 9.0 +/- 2.6 with the 2 mg. dosage (p =
      0.0045 versus placebo). At this dose mean urine volume per void increased from
      155 +/- 52 to 190 +/- 70 ml. (p <0.0001 versus placebo), while mean number of
      incontinence episodes per 24 hours decreased from 3.6 +/- 4.0 to 1.8 +/- 3.1 (p =
      0.19 versus placebo). Similar efficacy was observed in patients receiving the 1
      mg. dose. Severe dry mouth was reported by only 2, 1 and 2% of patients given the
      1 and 2 mg. dose, and placebo, respectively. There was no clinical or
      electrocardiographic evidence of significant cardiac adverse events. CONCLUSIONS:
      Tolterodine administration resulted in a significant decrease in the frequency of
      voiding and improved voided volume but it was seldom associated with troublesome 
      or severe side effects.

TI  - Tolterodine, a new antimuscarinic agent: as effective but better tolerated than
      oxybutynin in patients with an overactive bladder.
PG  - 801-10
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and tolerability of tolterodine with that of
      oxybutynin in patients with an overactive bladder. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multinational
      phase-III study was conducted in urology and gynaecology clinics in the UK,
      Republic of Ireland and Sweden. The study enrolled 293 patients with
      urodynamically confirmed bladder overactivity, increased frequency of micturition
      (> or = micturitions/24 h) and symptoms of urgency and/or urge incontinence (> or
      = 1 episode/24 h). Patients received either tolterodine (2 mg twice daily) or
      oxybutynin (5 mg three times daily) or placebo. Doses could be reduced, to
      prevent withdrawal, to 1 mg or 2.5 mg, respectively. The main outcome measures
      were the mean change from baseline in frequency of micturition/24 h, the number
      of incontinent episodes/24 h and volume voided per micturition. RESULTS: After 12
      weeks' treatment, the mean frequency of micturition decreased by 21% and 19.5% in
      those receiving tolterodine (n = 118) and oxybutynin (n = 118), respectively, and
      by 10.5% in those on placebo (n = 57). Among those with urge incontinence at
      baseline (75% of patients), the mean number of incontinent episodes decreased by 
      47%, 71% and 19%, respectively, in those receiving tolterodine, oxybutynin and
      placebo. The effect of tolterodine and oxybutynin on these two micturition
      variables was statistically equivalent. There was also a comparable increase in
      mean volume voided per micturition in the tolterodine (27%) and oxybutynin groups
      (31%), compared with 7% in the placebo group. Dry mouth was the most common
      adverse event and was reported with greater frequency and intensity among
      patients receiving oxybutynin than among those receiving either tolterodine or
      placebo. In the oxybutynin group, more patients also withdrew because of adverse 
      events and a greater proportion required dose reduction as a result of adverse
      events. Despite dose reduction, the frequency of adverse events and the intensity
      of dry mouth remained higher among those receiving oxybutynin (2.5 mg three times
      daily) than in patients who remained on tolterodine 2 mg twice daily. CONCLUSION:
      Tolterodine 2 mg twice daily is effective and well tolerated in the treatment of 
      bladder overactivity. Tolterodine was better tolerated than oxybutynin,
      particularly with respect to the frequency and intensity of dry mouth, but had
      comparable clinical efficacy. The superior tolerability of tolterodine therefore 
      allows more patients to remain on effective therapy than the current most
      commonly prescribed agent for the treatment of the overactive bladder.

TI  - The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin is unaffected by gender and contraceptive
      steroids.
PG  - 351-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: The effect of gender and concomitant use of contraceptive 
      steroids on the absorption and metabolism of oxybutynin was investigated in 49
      healthy volunteers, 24 females and 25 males. Serum concentrations of oxybutynin
      and its active metabolite, N-desethyloxybutynin, were measured for up to 48 h
      after ingestion of a single dose of 10 mg oxybutynin. RESULTS: Intake of oral
      contraceptive steroids had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetic
      parameters of oxybutynin or its metabolite. Both in males and females, the mean
      area under the curve (AUC0-t) of N-desethyloxybutynin was about 13 times higher
      and the peak concentration (Cmax) 15 to 19 times higher than the AUC0-t and Cmax 
      of the parent oxybutynin, with no significant differences between males and
      females. CONCLUSIONS: The pharmacokinetics of orally administered oxybutynin
      shows a considerable interindividual variability, but is unaffected by gender and
      use of contraceptive steroids.

OAB - PIP: This is a study of the effect of gender and concomitant use of contraceptive
      steroids on the absorption and metabolism of oxybutynin, a commonly used
      anticholinergic agent. 49 healthy volunteers--25 males and 24 females (13 using
      contraceptive steroids)--were given a single dose of 10 mg oxybutynin, which was 
      ingested under standardized conditions. The serum concentrations of oxybutynin
      and its active metabolite, N-desethyloxybutynin, were then measured for up to 48 
      hours after ingestion. Results showed that concomitant use of contraceptive
      steroids had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of
      oxybutynin or its metabolite. Neither was there any significant difference in its
      concentration between the male and female participants. Therefore, the
      pharmacokinetics of orally administered oxybutynin are unaffected by either
      gender or contraceptive steroids.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of tolterodine in patients with detrusor instability: a
      dose-ranging study.
PG  - 42-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and safety of tolterodine, a new
      antimuscarinic agent, and define the optimum dosage in patients with symptoms of 
      detrusor instability (urgency, increased frequency of micturition and/or urge
      incontinence). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      multicentre study was carried out; after a 1-week run-in period to establish
      baseline values, 81 patients were randomized to receive placebo or tolterodine
      0.5, 1, 2 or 4 mg twice daily for 2 weeks. Micturition (diary) variables,
      urodynamics and subjective urinary symptoms were assessed after 2 weeks'
      treatment. RESULTS: A per-protocol analysis of efficacy in 64 patients showed
      dose-related improvements in recorded micturition and urodynamic variables, e.g. 
      at a dosage of 2 mg twice daily, the frequency of micturition, episodes of
      incontinence and pad use were reduced by 20%, 46% and 29%, respectively, while
      the volume at first contraction increased by 89 mL. The 4 mg dosage was
      associated with a large increase in residual urinary volume and an increased
      incidence of dry mouth. The incidence of adverse events (mainly mild or moderate 
      antimuscarinic effects) was comparable with placebo at tolterodine dosages of <
      or = 2 mg. No serious adverse events were observed and tolterodine had no
      clinically significant impact on electrocardiographic or laboratory findings.
      CONCLUSION: The results indicate that tolterodine offers an effective treatment
      for the symptoms of detrusor instability. The optimum dosage appears to be 1-2 mg
      twice daily.

TI  - Identification of medications that cause cognitive impairment in older people:
      the case of oxybutynin chloride.
PG  - 8-13
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cognitive effects of acute challenges with the
      antispasmodic agent oxybutynin hydrochloride in normal older volunteers and to
      compare these effects with those attributable to diphenhydramine, another
      commonly used medication with anticholinergic (muscarinic-blocking) activity.
      DESIGN: A double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study. SETTING: Laboratory 
      evaluations of community subjects. PARTICIPANTS: A convenience sample of 12
      volunteers, average age 69.17 years. INTERVENTION: Baseline assessment was
      followed by randomized administration of a placebo, oxybutynin hydrochloride (5
      and 10 mg), and diphenhydramine hydrochloride (50 mg) in test sessions separated 
      by 1 week. MEASUREMENTS: Evaluation of cognitive performance with a 1-hour
      battery of pencil and paper, interviewer-administered, and computer-administered 
      tests beginning 90 minutes after drug (or placebo) administration. RESULTS:
      Random regression analyses demonstrated that oxybutynin caused significant
      cognitive decrements on seven of 15 cognitive measures, and diphenhydramine
      caused decrements on five measures. The most sensitive measures for detecting the
      effects of oxybutynin hydrochloride were the Buschke Selective Reminding Test and
      Reaction Time. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that oxybutynin can cause 
      cognitive impairment and suggest that physicians prescribing it should monitor
      their patients to facilitate the early recognition of those who experience
      drug-related cognitive deficits. More generally, the findings demonstrate that
      systematic research with normal volunteers can identify cognitive toxicity not
      recognized during the process of drug development or postmarketing surveillance.

PG  - 144-51
AB  - Tolterodine is a new competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist developed for the
      treatment of the unstable bladder. A total of 242 patients were enrolled in a
      multicenter, multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study
      conducted over a period of 4 weeks in patients with detrusor overactivity and
      symptoms of frequency, urgency, and urge incontinence. The objective of the study
      was to compare the efficacy and safety of tolterodine given at 1 or 2 mg b.i.d.
      versus placebo. At week 4 a statistically significant increase in the volume at
      first contraction (p = 0.030) and maximal cystometric capacity (p = 0.034) was
      only in the tolterodine 2 mg b.i.d. group. Tolterodine was safe and generally
      well tolerated. The incidence of dry mouth, as the most commonly reported adverse
      event, was only 9% and of mild to moderate intensity.

TI  - Oxybutynin with bladder retraining for detrusor instability in elderly people: a 
      randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 287-91
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of oxybutynin plus bladder
      training in the treatment of detrusor instability in frail elderly patients
      living independently in the community. It was a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled parallel-group trial of oxybutynin in 57 elderly patients
      (mean age 82.2, SD 6.06), with frequency and incontinence due to detrusor
      instability. After a 2-week run-in period patients received a bladder training
      and drug or placebo for the next 6 weeks. Outcome measures were changes in
      frequency and incontinence, recorded throughout on diary charts, and subjective
      evaluation of symptoms ('better'/'not better', and using a four-point scale
      'cure' to 'no change'). Oxybutynin was superior to placebo in reducing daytime
      frequency [95% confidence interval (CI) of difference in change in frequencies
      totalled over 14 days was -27.0, -6.0; p = 0.003] and in producing subjective
      benefit (at day 29 only), when 24/28 (86%) patients on oxybutynin described
      benefit compared with 16/29 (55%) on placebo (p = 0.02). There was no difference 
      between the groups in reduction of incontinent episodes. The median dose of
      oxybutynin titrated for therapeutic effect was 5 mg/day, and for placebo 10
      mg/day (CI of difference 0.001, 5.001; p = 0.05). Side-effects reported were of
      similar frequency (50%) in the two groups. We conclude that oxybutynin with
      bladder training is superior to bladder training alone in reducing frequency due 
      to detrusor instability in very elderly people living at home.

TI  - Does oxybutynin add to the effectiveness of prompted voiding for urinary
      incontinence among nursing home residents? A placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 610-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if oxybutynin, a bladder relaxant medication, adds to the
      effectiveness of prompted voiding (PV) in the management of urinary incontinence 
      among nursing home residents. DESIGN: Randomized, placebo-controlled,
      double-blinded, dose-adjusted, crossover trial of oxybutynin added along with PV.
      SETTING: Seven nursing homes in Los Angeles County, California. PARTICIPANTS:
      Seventy-five nursing home residents with predominantly urge incontinence, whose
      incontinence did not respond well to a trial of PV. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The
      frequency of incontinence, measured as the percentage of hourly (7 AM to 7 PM)
      physical checks over a 3-day period at which the resident was found wet. RESULTS:
      Sixty-three (84%) of the residents completed the study. Among those completing
      the trial, the percent of checks wet went from 26.5% to 23.7% on placebo to 20.2%
      on active drug. These changes were statistically significant but not clinically
      meaningful. A clinically significant decrease in the frequency of incontinence,
      which we defined as a relative reduction in the percent of checks wet of > 33%,
      occurred in 20 subjects (32%) while on active drug and in 12 subjects (19%) while
      on placebo (P = .48 by chi-square). Twenty-five subjects (40%) met our
      "continence criteria" of an average of one or less wet per day while on active
      drug, and 11 subjects (18%) achieved this goal on placebo (P = .005 by
      chi-square). CONCLUSION: Oxybutynin does not add to the clinical effectiveness of
      PV in the majority of nursing home residents with urge type urinary incontinence.
      Selected residents may, however, become more responsive to PV while on
      oxybutynin. Our data are consistent with other studies of bladder relaxant
      medications in functionally impaired populations. New drugs and/or other
      interventions are needed for the large number of incontinent nursing home
      residents who do not respond well to PV.

TI  - Trospium chloride versus oxybutynin: a randomized, double-blind, multicentre
      trial in the treatment of detrusor hyper-reflexia.
PG  - 452-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare trospium chloride (TCl), a quaternary ammonium derivative
      with atropine-like effects and predominantly antispasmodic activity, with
      oxybutynin (Oxy) in terms of efficacy and adverse effects. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      In a randomized, double-blind, multicentre trial, 95 patients with spinal cord
      injuries and detrusor hyper-reflexia were studied. Treatment consisted of three
      doses per day over a 2 week period, with either Oxy (5 mg three times daily) or
      with TCl (20 mg twice daily) with an additional placebo at midday. The results
      were evaluated with regard to changes in objective (urodynamic) data and
      subjective symptoms as well as the incidence/severity of adverse effects.
      RESULTS: With both drugs there was a significant increase in maximum bladder
      capacity, a significant decrease in maximum voiding detrusor pressure and a
      significant increase in compliance and residual urine; there were no
      statistically significant differences between the treatment groups. The
      percentage of patients who reported severe dryness of the mouth was considerably 
      lower (4%) in those receiving TCl 2 x 20 mg/day than in those receiving Oxy (23%)
      3 x 5 mg/day. Withdrawal from treatment was also less frequent in those receiving
      TCl (6%) than in those receiving Oxy (16%). CONCLUSION: Trospium chloride and
      oxybutynin, judged in terms of objective urodynamic parameters, are of
      substantially equal value as parasympathetic antagonists. However, assessment of 
      tolerance in terms of adverse drug effects showed that TCl had certain
      advantages.
