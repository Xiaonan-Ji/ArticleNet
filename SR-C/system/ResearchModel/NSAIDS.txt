TI  - Comparing the efficacy of cyclooxygenase 2-specific inhibitors in treating
      osteoarthritis: appropriate trial design considerations and results of a
      randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 3102-11
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of the cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2)-specific
      inhibitors celecoxib and rofecoxib in treating the signs and symptoms of
      osteoarthritis (OA). METHODS: In this randomized, placebo-controlled,
      double-blind, multicenter study, 475 patients with OA of the knee received either
      celecoxib 200 mg/day (n = 189), rofecoxib 25 mg/day (n = 190), or placebo (n =
      96) for 6 weeks. Arthritis assessments were performed at baseline, week 3, and
      week 6 (or at the time of early termination). RESULTS: In primary measures of
      efficacy (OA pain score on a 100-mm visual analog scale [VAS] and total domain
      score on the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index),
      celecoxib 200 mg/day and rofecoxib 25 mg/day demonstrated similar efficacy. At
      week 6, celecoxib was associated with a 34-mm mean improvement on the VAS for OA 
      pain, compared with 31.6 mm for rofecoxib and 21.2 mm for placebo. The difference
      between celecoxib and rofecoxib was -2.5 mm, with an upper limit of the 95%
      confidence interval of 2.7 mm and within the prespecified definition of
      noninferiority. Secondary measures of efficacy showed similar results. All
      differences in primary and secondary measures of efficacy between the 2 active
      treatments and placebo were statistically significant (P < 0.02), whereas all of 
      the comparisons of efficacy between celecoxib and rofecoxib met the predefined
      criteria for noninferiority. All treatments were well tolerated throughout the
      study, with similar proportions of patients withdrawing due to adverse events.
      CONCLUSION: Celecoxib 200 mg/day and rofecoxib 25 mg/day are equally efficacious 
      in treating the signs and symptoms of OA.

TI  - Gastrointestinal tolerability and effectiveness of rofecoxib versus naproxen in
      the treatment of osteoarthritis: a randomized, controlled trial.
PG  - 539-46
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity mediated by dual cyclooxygenase
      (COX)-1 and COX-2 inhibition of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can
      cause serious alterations of mucosal integrity or, more commonly, intolerable GI 
      symptoms that may necessitate discontinuation of therapy. Unlike NSAIDs,
      rofecoxib targets only the COX-2 isoform. OBJECTIVE: To assess the tolerability
      of rofecoxib compared with naproxen for treatment of osteoarthritis. DESIGN:
      Randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: 600 office and clinical research sites.
      PATIENTS: 5557 patients (mean age, 63 years) with a baseline diagnosis of
      osteoarthritis of the knee, hip, hand, or spine. INTERVENTION: Rofecoxib, 25
      mg/d, or naproxen, 500 mg twice daily. Use of routine medications, including
      aspirin, was permitted. MEASUREMENTS: Discontinuation due to GI adverse events
      (primary end point) and use of concomitant medication to treat GI symptoms
      (secondary end point). Efficacy was determined by patient-reported global
      assessment of disease status and the Australian/Canadian Osteoarthritis Hand
      Index, as well as discontinuations due to lack of efficacy. Patients were
      evaluated at baseline and at weeks 6 and 12. RESULTS: Rates of cumulative
      discontinuation due to GI adverse events were statistically significantly lower
      in the rofecoxib group than in the naproxen group (5.9% vs. 8.1%; relative risk, 
      0.74 [95% CI, 0.60 to 0.92]; P = 0.005), as were rates of cumulative use of
      medication to treat GI symptoms (9.1% vs. 11.2%; relative risk, 0.79 [CI, 0.66 to
      0.96]; P = 0.014]). Subgroup analysis of patients who used low-dose aspirin (13%)
      and those who previously discontinued using arthritis medication because of GI
      symptoms (15%) demonstrated a relative risk similar to the overall sample for
      discontinuation due to GI adverse events (relative risk, 0.56 [CI, 0.31 to 1.01] 
      and 0.53 [CI, 0.34 to 0.84], respectively). No statistically significant
      difference was observed between treatments for efficacy in treating
      osteoarthritis or for occurrence of other adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: In
      patients with osteoarthritis treated for 12 weeks, rofecoxib, 25 mg/d, was as
      effective as naproxen, 500 mg twice daily, but had statistically significantly
      superior GI tolerability and led to less use of concomitant GI medications.
      Benefits of rofecoxib in subgroup analyses were consistent with findings in the
      overall sample.

TI  - A randomised, double-blind, clinical trial comparing the efficacy of nimesulide, 
      celecoxib and rofecoxib in osteoarthritis of the knee.
PG  - 37-46
AB  - Joint pain is the main complaint in patients affected by osteoarthritis (OA), and
      NSAIDs are commonly used to treat pain associated with OA. Over the past few
      years, cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2-selective inhibitors have been proved to have
      certain advantages over non-selective NSAIDs and have been increasingly used for 
      pain management in patients with OA. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this
      randomised, double-blind, within-patient study was to compare the analgesic
      efficacy of three COX-2 inhibitors in 30 patients affected by symptomatic OA of
      the knee. We evaluated the effects of oral nimesulide (100mg), celecoxib (200mg) 
      and rofecoxib (25mg). Each drug was administered for 7 days. METHODS: Analgesic
      efficacy was determined using the patient's assessment of pain on a visual
      analogue scale (VAS) and by total pain relief over 3 hours (TOPAR3) on the first 
      and last days of treatment. In addition, the overall analgesic efficacy and
      tolerability were determined by a global assessment by the patient at the end of 
      each week of treatment, using 5-point categorical scales. At the end of the
      study, each patient was asked about which of the three forms of treatment they
      would choose as a continuation of the pain therapy. RESULTS: Taking all the
      results into consideration, nimesulide proved to be significantly more effective 
      in providing symptomatic relief than did celecoxib and rofecoxib. Furthermore,
      nimesulide provided more rapid relief of pain associated with walking than did
      the other two drugs tested. Patients expressed similar preference for nimesulide 
      and rofecoxib, but a lesser preference for celecoxib treatment. No patient
      withdrew from the study because of adverse events and the three different forms
      of treatment were generally safe and well tolerated. CONCLUSION: The present data
      confirm our previous observations in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, further 
      suggesting that nimesulide represents an effective agent for the treatment of
      joint pain, with particular reference to the rapid onset of its analgesic effect.

TI  - Cardiovascular thrombotic events in arthritis trials of the cyclooxygenase-2
      inhibitor celecoxib.
PG  - 411-8
AB  - To determine whether the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor celecoxib affects
      cardiovascular thrombotic risk, we analyzed the incidence of cardiovascular
      events for celecoxib, placebo, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 
      in the entire controlled, arthritis clinical trial database for celecoxib. The
      primary analysis used the Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration end points, which
      include: (1) cardiovascular, hemorrhagic, and unknown deaths, (2) nonfatal
      myocardial infarction, and (3) nonfatal stroke. Other secondary thrombotic events
      were also examined. Separate analyses were performed for all patients and for
      those not taking aspirin. Data from all controlled, completed arthritis trials of
      > or =4 weeks duration, including 13 new drug application studies and 2 large
      post-marketing trials (CLASS and SUCCESS) were included for analyses. Patients
      were randomized to celecoxib at doses from 100 to 400 mg twice daily (18,942
      patients; 5,668.2 patient-years of exposure), diclofenac 50 to 75 mg twice daily,
      ibuprofen 800 mg thrice daily, naproxen 500 mg twice daily (combined NSAID
      exposure of 11,143 patients; 3,612.2 patient-years), or placebo (1,794 subjects; 
      199.9 subject-years). Data from a long-term uncontrolled trial with 5,209
      patients (6,950 patients-years) treated with celecoxib were included in a
      supplemental analysis. The entire 15-trial database was searched for possible
      serious thrombotic events as well as to identify all deaths. For these patients, 
      detailed clinical data were obtained and reviewed by 2 of the investigators (WBW 
      and JSB), who were independently and blinded to exposure, to classify the event
      as primary, secondary, or neither. All analyses were done using the
      intent-to-treat population, and time-to-event analyses were performed using
      per-patient data. To examine heterogeneity of results among studies, tests of
      interaction were performed using the Cox model. Incidences of the primary and
      secondary events were not significantly different between the celecoxib and
      placebo groups, nor for the celecoxib group compared with the NSAIDs group,
      regardless of aspirin use and NSAID type. The relative risks comparing celecoxib 
      with the NSAIDs for the primary events were 1.06 (95% confidence interval 0.70 to
      1.61, p = 0.79) for all patients, and 0.86 (95% confidence interval 0.48 to 1.56,
      p = 0.62) for the subgroup not taking aspirin. Similarly, for secondary
      cardiovascular end points, all relative risks were < or =1 for celecoxib compared
      with either placebo or NSAIDs. These comparative analyses demonstrate no evidence
      of increased risk of cardiovascular thrombotic events associated with celecoxib
      compared with either conventional NSAIDs or placebo.

TI  - Interaction of rofecoxib and celecoxib with warfarin.
PG  - 1319-23
AB  - The interaction of celecoxib and rofecoxib with warfarin was studied. Patients
      stable on warfarin therapy and concurrently taking a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)
      inhibitor comparator (traditional nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications,
      salsalate, or acetaminophen) randomly received celecoxib 200 mg/day or rofecoxib 
      25 mg/day for three weeks. After a one-week washout period, the patients were
      crossed over to treatment with the opposite COX-2 inhibitor for three more weeks.
      The International Normalized Ratio (INR) was measured at baseline and at weeks 1,
      2, and 3 of therapy with each COX-2 inhibitor by testing blood samples obtained
      by finger stick. Data for 16 patients were analyzed. The INR increased by 13%,
      6%, and 5% on average in patients taking celecoxib at weeks 1, 2, and 3,
      respectively, and by 5%, 9%, and 5% in patients taking rofecoxib. Changes in the 
      INR were statistically significant at week 1 for celecoxib and at week 2 for
      rofecoxib. Of the 12 subjects who had a clinically significant > or = 15% change 
      in the INR while receiving either COX-2 inhibitor, 4 showed this change for both 
      agents. Adverse drug reactions were similar for each COX-2 inhibitor, but the
      rate of edema requiring medical intervention was higher in the rofecoxib group.
      Significant increases in the INR were observed in patients who were stable on
      warfarin therapy after the addition of therapy with rofecoxib or celecoxib.

TI  - Valdecoxib is as effective as diclofenac in the management of rheumatoid
      arthritis with a lower incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers: results of a 26-week
      trial.
PG  - 1207-15
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and upper gastrointestinal (GI) safety of
      valdecoxib 20 and 40 mg daily with those of diclofenac 75 mg slow release (SR)
      twice daily in treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Seven hundred and
      twenty-two patients with adult-onset RA were enrolled into this 26-week,
      randomized, multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group study (246 in the
      valdecoxib 20 mg daily arm, 237 in the valdecoxib 40 mg daily arm and 239 in the 
      diclofenac 75 mg SR daily arm). Acetylsalicylic acid use (< or =325 mg per day)
      was similar across all groups: 5.4% in the diclofenac group, 5.7% in the
      valdecoxib 20 mg group and 5.9% in the valdecoxib 40 mg group. Efficacy was
      measured by the Patient's Assessment of Arthritis Pain [visual analogue scale
      (VAS)] and the modified Health Assessment Questionnaire (mHAQ) at baseline and at
      weeks 2, 6, 8, 12, 18 and 26 of treatment, or at early termination. Upper GI
      safety was evaluated by endoscopy at the end of treatment, which took place no
      more than 2 days after the last dose of study medication or at early termination.
      RESULTS: Valdecoxib 20 and 40 mg daily were comparable to diclofenac 75 mg SR
      twice daily in treating the signs and symptoms of RA. No significant differences 
      were observed between treatment groups with respect to mean changes from baseline
      in the Patient's Assessment of Arthritis Pain (VAS) or mHAQ. The incidence of
      gastroduodenal ulcers in patients receiving valdecoxib 20 mg daily (6%) and
      valdecoxib 40 mg daily (4%) was significantly lower (P < 0.001) than in patients 
      receiving diclofenac 75 mg SR twice daily (16%). Valdecoxib 20 mg daily was also 
      associated with significantly improved GI tolerability (P = 0.035) compared with 
      diclofenac. CONCLUSIONS: Single daily doses of valdecoxib 20 and 40 mg provided
      efficacy comparable to that of diclofenac, with a superior upper GI safety
      profile in the long-term treatment of RA patients.

TI  - Incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers in patients with rheumatoid arthritis after 12
      weeks of rofecoxib, naproxen, or placebo: a multicentre, randomised, double blind
      study.
PG  - 820-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies in patients with osteoarthritis have suggested that 
      the selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor rofecoxib results in less
      gastrointestinal damage than non-selective non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs
      (NSAIDs). This study compared the incidence of endoscopically detected
      gastroduodenal ulcers in rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with rofecoxib or 
      a non-selective NSAID. METHODS: In this multicentre, randomised, double blind, 12
      week study, patients with rheumatoid arthritis were allocated to rofecoxib 50 mg 
      once daily (n=219), naproxen 500 mg twice daily (n=220), or placebo (n=221).
      Endoscopy was performed at baseline and at six and 12 weeks. Lifetable analysis
      and log rank tests were used to analyse the incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers > 
      or =3 mm. Gastric or duodenal ulcers > or =5 mm and erosions were also evaluated 
      as secondary end points. Tolerability was assessed by adverse events. RESULTS:
      The cumulative incidence of ulcers > or =3 mm at 12 weeks was significantly
      higher in patients on naproxen (25.5%) than in patients receiving rofecoxib
      (6.8%; difference 18.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 11.7%, 25.7%); p<0.001) or 
      placebo (2.9%; difference 22.6% (95% CI 16.1%, 29.1%); p<0.001). The difference
      between rofecoxib (6.8%) and placebo (2.9%) did not reach statistical
      significance (p=0.066). Results were similar for ulcers > or =5 mm and for mean
      changes from baseline in the number of gastroduodenal erosions. The overall
      incidence of clinical adverse events was similar among treatment groups (61% of
      patients on placebo, 62% in patients on rofecoxib, and 66% in patients on
      naproxen). CONCLUSIONS: Rofecoxib 50 mg daily (twice the dose recommended for
      this patient population) resulted in a lower incidence of endoscopically detected
      gastroduodenal ulcers and erosions than treatment with naproxen 500 mg twice
      daily.

TI  - Celecoxib versus diclofenac and omeprazole in reducing the risk of recurrent
      ulcer bleeding in patients with arthritis.
PG  - 2104-10
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommend that patients at risk for ulcer disease 
      who require treatment for arthritis receive nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs
      (NSAIDs) that are selective for cyclooxygenase-2 or the combination of a
      nonselective NSAID with a proton-pump inhibitor. We assessed whether celecoxib
      would be similar to diclofenac plus omeprazole in reducing the risk of recurrent 
      ulcer bleeding in patients at high risk for bleeding. METHODS: We studied
      patients who used NSAIDs for arthritis and who presented with ulcer bleeding.
      After their ulcers had healed, we randomly assigned patients who were negative
      for Helicobacter pylori to receive either 200 mg of celecoxib twice daily plus
      daily placebo or 75 mg of diclofenac twice daily plus 20 mg of omeprazole daily
      for six months. The end point was recurrent ulcer bleeding. RESULTS: In the
      intention-to-treat analysis, which included 287 patients (144 receiving celecoxib
      and 143 receiving diclofenac plus omeprazole), recurrent ulcer bleeding occurred 
      in 7 patients receiving celecoxib and 9 receiving diclofenac plus omeprazole. The
      probability of recurrent bleeding during the six-month period was 4.9 percent (95
      percent confidence interval, 3.1 to 6.7) for patients who received celecoxib and 
      6.4 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 4.3 to 8.4) for patients who
      received diclofenac plus omeprazole (difference, -1.5 percentage points; 95
      percent confidence interval for the difference, -6.8 to 3.8). Renal adverse
      events, including hypertension, peripheral edema, and renal failure, occurred in 
      24.3 percent of the patients receiving celecoxib and 30.8 percent of those
      receiving diclofenac plus omeprazole. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with a recent
      history of ulcer bleeding, treatment with celecoxib was as effective as treatment
      with diclofenac plus omeprazole, with respect to the prevention of recurrent
      bleeding. Renal toxic effects are common in high-risk patients receiving
      celecoxib or diclofenac plus omeprazole.

TI  - Comparison of low-dose rofecoxib versus 1000 mg naproxen in patients with
      osteoarthritis. Results of two randomized treatment trials of six weeks duration.
PG  - 337-44
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of rofecoxib 12.5 mg once daily to 
      naproxen 500 mg twice daily in patients > or = 40 years of age with knee or hip
      osteoarthritis (OA). METHOD: Two identical 6-week, randomized, double-blind
      studies were conducted (1 in Africa, Australia, Europe, Canada, Mexico, & South
      America; 1 in Asia). Primary endpoints were pain walking on a flat surface,
      patient global assessment of response to therapy, and investigator global
      assessment of disease status. RESULTS: Overall, 944 patients participated. For
      all efficacy endpoints, treatment effects for rofecoxib and naproxen were
      comparable and seen at the first measures of efficacy. Both compounds were
      generally well-tolerated, with an improved gastrointestinal safety profile for
      rofecoxib versus naproxen. CONCLUSIONS In these studies, rofecoxib 12.5 mg once
      daily (the lowest indicated dose) and naproxen 500 mg twice daily showed similar 
      treatment effects in OA patients. Rofecoxib and naproxen were generally well
      tolerated.

TI  - Effects of celecoxib and rofecoxib on blood pressure and edema in patients > or
      =65 years of age with systemic hypertension and osteoarthritis.
PG  - 959-63
AB  - Concomitant use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including the
      cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) specific inhibitors, with antihypertensive medication is
      common practice for many patients with arthritis. This study evaluated the
      effects of celecoxib 200 mg/day and rofecoxib 25 mg/day on blood pressure (BP)
      and edema in a 6-week, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind study in patients
      > or =65 years of age with osteoarthritis who were treated with fixed
      antihypertensive regimens. One thousand ninety-two patients received study
      medication (celecoxib, n = 549; rofecoxib, n = 543). Significantly more patients 
      in the rofecoxib group compared with the celecoxib group developed increased
      systolic BP (change >20 mm Hg plus absolute value > or =140 mm Hg) at any time
      point (14.9% vs 6.9%, p <0.01). Rofecoxib caused the greatest increase in
      systolic BP in patients receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or
      beta blockers, whereas those on calcium channel antagonists or diuretic
      monotherapy receiving either celecoxib or rofecoxib showed no significant
      increases in BP. Clinically significant new-onset or worsening edema associated
      with weight gain developed in a greater percentage of patients in the rofecoxib
      group (7.7%) compared with the celecoxib group (4.7%) (p <0.05). Thus, in
      patients with controlled hypertension on a fixed antihypertensive regimen,
      careful monitoring of BP is warranted after the initiation of celecoxib or
      rofecoxib therapy.

TI  - Incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers associated with valdecoxib compared with that 
      of ibuprofen and diclofenac in patients with osteoarthritis.
PG  - 1101-11
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether valdecoxib, at chronic arthritis doses, has the
      characteristics of a cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2) specific inhibitor, as measured by
      a reduced incidence of upper-gastrointestinal ulceration compared with
      conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). METHODS: This
      double-blind, multicentre, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study compared the 
      incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers associated with valdecoxib 10 mg daily (q.d.) 
      and 20 mg q.d. with that of ibuprofen 800 mg three times daily (t.i.d.) or
      diclofenac 75 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) when administered over a 12-week period.
      The incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers was assessed by upper-gastrointestinal
      endoscopy, performed at baseline and again at the end of week 12 (or at early
      study termination). Efficacy assessments were performed at baseline and at weeks 
      2, 6 and 12 using Patient's and Physician's Global Assessments of Arthritis.
      RESULTS: A total of 1052 osteoarthritis patients were enrolled into the trial.
      The incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers over 12 weeks was 5% in patients receiving
      valdecoxib 10 mg q.d., 4% in patients receiving valdecoxib 20 mg q.d., 7% in
      patients receiving placebo, 16% in patients receiving ibuprofen 800 mg t.i.d. (P 
      <0.05 v. placebo), and 17% in patients receiving diclofenac 75 mg b.i.d. (P <0.05
      v. placebo). The incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers at week 12 seen in the
      ibuprofen 800 mg t.i.d. and diclofenac 75 mg b.i.d. groups was significantly
      higher than that in the valdecoxib 10 mg q.d. and valdecoxib 20 mg q.d. groups (P
      <0.05). The incidence rates of gastroduodenal ulcers were not significantly
      different between the valdecoxib treatment groups or between valdecoxib- and
      placebo-treated patients. Efficacy responses to valdecoxib 10 mg and 20 mg q.d.
      were significantly greater than placebo and comparable with both ibuprofen 800 mg
      t.i.d. and diclofenac 75 mg b.i.d. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study
      demonstrate that valdecoxib has an upper-gastrointestinal safety profile typical 
      of a COX-2 specific inhibitor. Overall, the data indicate that administration of 
      valdecoxib offers similar efficacy for the treatment of osteoarthritis but
      improved upper-gastrointestinal safety compared with the conventional NSAIDs,
      ibuprofen and diclofenac, based on the significantly lower incidence of
      gastroduodenal ulcers detected by endoscopy.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of valdecoxib in treating the signs and symptoms of
      rheumatoid arthritis: a randomized, controlled comparison with placebo and
      naproxen.
PG  - 1008-16
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of the COX-2 specific inhibitor valdecoxib
      with the conventional NSAID naproxen and placebo in treating rheumatoid arthritis
      (RA). METHODS: This multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      trial compared the efficacy and safety of valdecoxib 10 mg (n=209), 20 mg (n=212)
      or 40 mg once daily (q.d.) (n=221) with naproxen 500 mg b.i.d. (n=226) or placebo
      (n=222), in treating the signs and symptoms of RA. Efficacy was assessed by the
      number of patients responding to treatment according to the American College of
      Rheumatology-Responder Index (ACR-20). RESULTS: ACR-20 response was recorded for 
      all randomized patients who received a single dose of study medication (above).
      Valdecoxib, at all administered doses, produced significant improvements in the
      ACR-20 Responder Index at weeks 2, 6 and 12 compared with placebo (P<or=0.01).
      Valdecoxib and naproxen did not differ in terms of ACR-20 response rate and the
      three doses of valdecoxib were similar to one another. All three doses of
      valdecoxib were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Single daily doses of valdecoxib 10,
      20 and 40 mg demonstrated efficacy that was superior to placebo and similar to
      naproxen in treating the signs and symptoms of RA. All three doses provided
      similar levels of efficacy.

      with naproxen in patients with osteoarthritis.
PG  - 530-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We compared the efficacy and upper gastrointestinal safety of the
      cyclooxygenase-2-specific inhibitor valdecoxib with naproxen and placebo in
      treating moderate to severe osteoarthritis of the knee. STUDY DESIGN: This
      multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study compared the
      efficacy and upper gastrointestinal tract safety of valdecoxib at dosages of 5,
      10, and 20 mg once daily with placebo and naproxen at the dosage of 500 mg twice 
      daily. POPULATION: We included patients who had been diagnosed with moderate to
      severe osteoarthritis of the knee according to the modified criteria of the
      American College of Rheumatology. OUTCOMES MEASURED: The Patient's and
      Physician's Global Assessment of Arthritis (PaGAA, PhGAA), Patient's Assessment
      of Arthritis Pain-Visual Analog Scale (PAAP-VAS), and Western Ontario and
      McMaster's Universities (WOMAC) Osteoarthritis indices were assessed at baseline 
      and at weeks 2, 6, and 12. Upper gastrointestinal ulceration was assessed by pre-
      and posttreatment endoscopies. RESULTS: Valdecoxib 10 and 20 mg once daily (but
      not 5 mg once daily) demonstrated similar efficacy to naproxen at 500 mg twice
      daily, and all 3 dosages were superior to placebo for the PaGAA, PhGAA, PAAP-VAS,
      and WOMAC Osteoarthritis indices at most assessments throughout the 12-week study
      (P <.05). The incidence of endoscopically proven ulcers was significantly higher 
      in the naproxen group than in the 5- and 10-mg valdecoxib groups, but not in the 
      20-mg valdecoxib group. All 3 valdecoxib doses were comparable to placebo in
      ulcer incidence. CONCLUSIONS: Valdecoxib (10 and 20 mg once daily) is
      significantly superior to placebo and as effective as naproxen (500 mg twice
      daily) in improving moderate to severe osteoarthritis of the knee. Upper
      gastrointestinal tract safety of valdecoxib (5 and 10 mg) was comparable to that 
      of placebo and significantly better than that of naproxen.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of the COX-2 specific inhibitor valdecoxib in the management 
      of osteoarthritis of the hip: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      comparison with naproxen.
PG  - 290-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Non-steroidal antiinflammatory agents are commonly used to treat pain 
      and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis (OA), but have poor
      gastrointestinal (GI) tolerability. This study compared the efficacy of the COX-2
      specific inhibitor valdecoxib with naproxen and placebo, in treating symptomatic 
      OA of the hip. DESIGN: This multicenter, randomized, double-blind 12-week study
      compared the efficacy and tolerability of single daily doses of valdecoxib 5 mg
      and 10 mg with placebo or naproxen 500 mg BID. Efficacy was assessed by Patient's
      and Physician's Global Assessment of Arthritis, and the WOMAC (Western Ontario
      and McMasters) OA Individual and Composite Indices. The incidence of adverse
      events was monitored throughout the study. RESULTS: Valdecoxib was clinically and
      statistically superior to placebo for Patient's and Physician's Global Assessment
      of Arthritis and for all WOMAC OA Indices over the 12 week study period (P<or=
      0.05). Valdecoxib 10 mg was similar to naproxen in terms of efficacy, and
      demonstrated greater numerical improvements compared with valdecoxib 5 mg.
      Valdecoxib 5 mg and 10 mg demonstrated similar tolerability compared to placebo
      and a lower incidence of GI-related adverse effects compared with naproxen.
      CONCLUSIONS: Single daily doses of valdecoxib 5 mg and 10 mg were similar to
      naproxen and superior to placebo, in treating symptomatic OA of the hip. Both
      doses of valdecoxib were well tolerated and demonstrated improved GI tolerability
      compared to naproxen.

TI  - Dose response and safety study of meloxicam up to 22.5 mg daily in rheumatoid
      arthritis: a 12 week multicenter, double blind, dose response study versus
      placebo and diclofenac.
PG  - 436-46
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This Phase III, placebo and active controlled, multicenter trial
      evaluated the efficacy and safety of meloxicam 7.5, 15, and 22.5 mg daily for the
      treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: A 12 week, randomized, double
      blind, double dummy, parallel group trial compared daily oral meloxicam 7.5, 15, 
      and 22.5 mg to placebo (negative control) and diclofenac 75 mg BID (positive
      control). A total of 894 patients (18 years of age with confirmed RA who flared
      following an NSAID-free period) were randomized to be treated. Baseline scores
      for all endpoints were similar among the treatment groups. Patient assessments
      were at 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks or early termination. RESULTS: All treatment
      groups demonstrated significant improvement from baseline (p < 0.001). Meloxicam 
      7.5 and 22.5 mg was significantly superior to placebo in all 5 primary efficacy
      endpoints (swollen joint count, tender joint count, patient pain, patient and
      physician global; all p < 0.05). Diclofenac 150 mg was superior to placebo for 4 
      of 5 primary efficacy measures (all but swollen joint count; p < 0.05) and
      meloxicam 15 mg was superior for 3 of 5 primary endpoints (patient pain and
      patient and physician global). AUC of patient global, patient pain, and modified 
      Health Assessment Questionnaire demonstrated dose-response (p < 0.04), while AUC 
      ACR20 showed a qualitative trend in the same direction. The rate of
      gastrointestinal (GI) events during the 12 week trial for all doses of meloxicam 
      and diclofenac did not differ significantly from placebo (23.2-32.0%). GI
      withdrawals were comparable and not significantly different across all treatment 
      groups (4.3-5.7%). CONCLUSION: This trial demonstrated a dose response
      relationship for meloxicam 7.5, 15, and 22.5 mg using AUC measurement of response
      for the treatment of RA. All 3 doses of meloxicam. and positive control, were
      effective in the treatment of RA. The overall incidence rate of GI events did not
      differ significantly from placebo in either the meloxicam treatment groups or the
      positive control.

TI  - Ulcer prevention in long-term users of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs:
      results of a double-blind, randomized, multicenter, active- and
      placebo-controlled study of misoprostol vs lansoprazole.
PG  - 169-75
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies that report prevention of ulcer recurrence among long-term
      users of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that do not stratify for
      Helicobacter pylori status may not be generalizable to the large population of
      individuals without H pylori. METHODS: This was a prospective, double-blind,
      multicenter, active- and placebo-controlled study among 537 patients without H
      pylori who were long-term users of NSAIDs and who had a history of endoscopically
      documented gastric ulcer. Patients were randomized to receive placebo, 200 microg
      of misoprostol 4 times a day, or 15 or 30 mg of lansoprazole once daily for 12
      weeks. Ulcer status was determined by endoscopy at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. RESULTS:
      Patients receiving lansoprazole (15 or 30 mg) remained free from gastric ulcer
      longer than those who received placebo (P<.001) but for a shorter time than those
      who received misoprostol. By week 12, the percentages of gastric ulcer-free
      patients were as follows: placebo, 51% (95% confidence interval [CI],
      41.1%-61.3%); misoprostol, 93% (95% CI, 87.2%-97.9%); 15-mg lansoprazole, 80%
      (95% CI, 72.5%-87.3%); and 30-mg lansoprazole, 82% (95% CI, 75.0%-89.6%). A
      significantly higher proportion of patients in the misoprostol group reported
      treatment-related adverse events and early withdrawal from the study. When the
      impact of withdrawals on ulcer development was considered (as failures), therapy 
      was successful for 69% for each of the active treatment groups and 35% for the
      placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Proton pump inhibitors such as lansoprazole are
      superior to placebo for the prevention of NSAID-induced gastric ulcers but not
      superior to misoprostol, 800 microg/d. When the poor compliance and potential
      adverse effects associated with misoprostol are considered, proton pump
      inhibitors and full-dose misoprostol are clinically equivalent.

TI  - Comparative efficacy and safety of celecoxib and naproxen in the treatment of
      osteoarthritis of the hip.
PG  - 467-79
AB  - Osteoarthritis (OA) is responsible for more disability of the lower extremities
      in the elderly than any other disease in the US. The pain associated with OA is
      the primary symptom leading to disability in these patients. Current ACR
      guidelines recommend consideration of acetaminophen for mild-to-moderate pain and
      conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or COX-2 specific
      inhibitors for moderate-to-severe OA symptoms. The aim of this study was to
      compare the efficacy and safety of the COX-1 sparing, COX-2 specific inhibitor,
      celecoxib, with the conventional NSAID naproxen, and placebo, in the treatment of
      OA of the hip. In this multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 1061
      patients with symptomatic OA of the hip were randomized to receive celecoxib at
      doses of 100 mg, 200 mg, or 400 mg/day; naproxen 1000 mg/day; or placebo, for 12 
      weeks. Patients were evaluated using standard measures of efficacy at baseline,
      2-4 days after discontinuing previous NSAID or analgesic therapy, and after 2, 6,
      and 12 weeks of treatment. All doses of celecoxib and naproxen significantly
      improved the symptoms of OA, at all time points compared with placebo. This
      sustained treatment effect of celecoxib was dose dependent. In terms of pain
      relief and improvement in functional capacity, celecoxib 200 mg/day and 400
      mg/day were similarly efficacious and were comparable to naproxen. Both drugs
      were generally well tolerated. Celecoxib at a dose of 200 mg/day is as effective 
      as a standard therapeutic dose of the conventional NSAID, naproxen, in reducing
      the pain associated with OA of the hip.

TI  - Efficacy of rofecoxib, celecoxib, and acetaminophen in osteoarthritis of the
      knee: a randomized trial.
PG  - 64-71
AB  - CONTEXT: Osteoarthritis (OA) is often treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, or specific inhibitors of cyclooxygenase 2
      (COX-2). OBJECTIVE: To assess the relative therapeutic efficacy of rofecoxib,
      celecoxib, and acetaminophen in adults with OA. DESIGN AND SETTING: Randomized,
      parallel-group, double-blind trial, conducted from June 1999 to February 2000, in
      29 clinical centers in the United States. PATIENTS: Three hundred eighty-two
      patients aged at least 40 years who had OA of the knee that was previously
      treated with NSAIDs or acetaminophen. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly
      assigned to receive rofecoxib, 12.5 mg/d (n = 96); rofecoxib, 25 mg/d (n = 95);
      celecoxib, 200 mg/d (n = 97); or acetaminophen, 4000 mg/d (n = 94) for 6 weeks.
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Assessments over days 1 to 6 and over 6 weeks included
      pain on walking, night pain, pain at rest, and morning stiffness as measured on a
      Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (100-mm visual analog 
      scale [VAS]) and global response to therapy compared among 4 treatment groups.
      RESULTS: 79% of patients completed the study. More patients treated with
      acetaminophen discontinued early due to lack of efficacy than patients treated
      with COX-2 inhibitors (31% vs 18%-19%). Efficacy assessed in the first 6 days of 
      therapy showed greatest response to rofecoxib, 25 mg/d, followed by rofecoxib,
      12.5 mg/d, celecoxib, and acetaminophen, respectively, in terms of relief of pain
      on walking (-32.2, - 29.0, - 26.4, and -20.6 mm change on the VAS; P</=.04 for
      all others vs acetaminophen; P =.05 for 25-mg rofecoxib vs celecoxib), rest pain 
      (-21.8, - 18.6, - 15.5, and - 12.5 mm; P</=.02 for either dose of rofecoxib vs
      acetaminophen and P =.02 for rofecoxib, 25 mg/d, vs celecoxib), night pain
      (-25.2, - 22.0, - 18.7, and - 18.8 mm; P =.04 for rofecoxib, 25 mg/d, vs both
      acetaminophen and celecoxib), and morning stiffness (-30.4, - 28.4, - 25.7, and -
      20.9 mm; P</=.02 for either dose of rofecoxib vs acetaminophen). Over 6 weeks,
      rofecoxib, 25 mg/d, provided greatest response for night pain (P<.002 vs
      celecoxib and P =.006 vs acetaminophen and P =.02 vs rofecoxib, 12.5 mg/d),
      composite pain subscale (P</=.03 vs all other treatments), stiffness subscale
      (P</=.04 vs celecoxib and acetaminophen), and physical function subscale (P =.001
      vs acetaminophen). Global responses over 6 weeks showed a similar pattern (good
      or excellent response at week 6: 60%, 56%, 46%, and 39%, respectively; P</=.03
      for rofecoxib, 25 mg/d, vs celecoxib and acetaminophen; P =.02 for rofecoxib,
      12.5 mg/d, vs acetaminophen). All treatments were generally safe and well
      tolerated. CONCLUSION: Rofecoxib, 25 mg/d, provided efficacy advantages over
      acetaminophen, 4000 mg/d, celecoxib, 200 mg/d, and rofecoxib, 12.5 mg, for
      symptomatic knee OA.

TI  - Reduced incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers with celecoxib, a novel
      cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, compared to naproxen in patients with arthritis.
PG  - 1019-27
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) block prostaglandin
      production by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX); they are believed to cause
      gastroduodenal damage by inhibiting the COX-1 isoform and to have analgesic and
      anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the COX-2 isoform. As compared to
      conventional NSAIDs, celecoxib, a COX-2 specific inhibitor, has been shown in
      previous single posttreatment endoscopy studies to be associated with lower
      gastroduodenal ulcer rates. In response to concerns that such studies may
      under-represent ulceration rates, the present serial endoscopy study was designed
      to compare cumulative gastroduodenal ulcer rates associated with the use of
      celecoxib to those of naproxen, a conventional NSAID. METHODS: In this
      double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter study, 537 patients with osteoarthritis
      (OA) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were randomized to treatment with celecoxib 200
      mg b.i.d. (n = 270) or naproxen 500 mg b.i.d. (n = 267) for 12 wk. Gastroduodenal
      damage was determined from esophagogastroduodenoscopy after 4, 8, and 12 wk of
      therapy. Arthritis efficacy was evaluated with Patient's and Physician's Global
      Assessments. RESULTS: Gastroduodenal ulcer rates after celecoxib and naproxen
      treatment were 4% versus 19% in the 0-4 wk interval (p < 0.001), 2% versus 14% in
      the 4-8 wk interval (p < 0.001), and 2% versus 10% in the 8-12 wk interval (p <
      0.001), respectively. After 12 wk of treatment, the cumulative incidence of
      gastroduodenal ulcers was 9% with celecoxib and 41% with naproxen. In the
      celecoxib group, gastroduodenal ulcers were significantly associated with
      Helicobacter pylori status (p < 0.05), concurrent aspirin usage (p = 0.001), and 
      a history of ulcer (p = 0.010), but not with disease type (OA/RA), age, gender,
      other relevant medical histories, or concurrent corticosteroid or
      disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs usage (p > 0.05). Celecoxib produced a
      significantly lower incidence rate of both gastric (p < 0.001) and duodenal (p < 
      0.030) ulcers. The two agents produced similar improvements in Patient's and
      Physician's Global Assessments of arthritis efficacy. The incidence of adverse
      events and withdrawal rates did not differ significantly between treatments.
      CONCLUSIONS: As compared to naproxen (500 mg b.i.d.), use of celecoxib (200 mg
      b.i.d.), a COX-2 specific agent, at the recommended RA dose and twice the most
      frequently prescribed OA dose, was associated with lower rates of gastric,
      duodenal, and gastroduodenal ulcers but had comparable efficacy, in patients with
      OA and RA.

TI  - Cyclooxygenase-2--specific inhibitors and cardiorenal function: a randomized,
      controlled trial of celecoxib and rofecoxib in older hypertensive osteoarthritis 
      patients.
PG  - 85-95
AB  - BACKGROUND: Arthritis and hypertension are common comorbid conditions affecting
      elderly adults. Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in patients treated
      with antihypertensive medication can lead to destabilization of blood pressure
      control and other cardiorenal events. The potential for similar interactions with
      cyclooxygenase-2-specific inhibitors has not been fully explored. The authors
      evaluated the cardiorenal safety of two new cyclooxygenase-2-specific inhibitors,
      celecoxib and rofecoxib. METHODS: This study was a 6-week, randomized,
      parallel-group, double-blind trial in patients with osteoarthritis who were > or 
      =65 years of age and were taking antihypertensive agents. Patients received
      once-daily celecoxib 200 mg or rofecoxib 25 mg. The primary endpoints were the
      development of edema, changes in systolic blood pressure, and changes in
      diastolic blood pressure as measured at any time point in the study. Measurements
      occurred at baseline and after 1, 2, and 6 weeks of treatment. FINDINGS: Eight
      hundred ten patients received study medication (celecoxib, n = 411; rofecoxib, n 
      = 399). Nearly twice as many rofecoxib- compared with celecoxib-treated patients 
      experienced edema (9.5% vs. 4.9%, P = 0.014). Systolic blood pressure increased
      significantly in 17% of rofecoxib- compared with 11% of celecoxib-treated
      patients (P = 0.032) at any study time point. Diastolic blood pressure increased 
      in 2.3% of rofecoxib- compared with 1.5% of celecoxib-treated patients (P =
      0.44). At week 6, the change from baseline in mean systolic blood pressure was
      +2.6 mmHg for rofecoxib compared with -0.5 mmHg for celecoxib (P = 0.007).
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients taking antihypertensive therapy and receiving
      cyclooxygenase-2-specific inhibitors should be monitored for the development of
      cardiorenal events. Patients receiving celecoxib experienced less edema and less 
      destabilization of blood pressure control compared with those receiving
      rofecoxib.

      weeks treatment in patients with osteoarthritis.
PG  - 19-24
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the incidence of selected spontaneously reported adverse
      events (AEs) in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) treated with rofecoxib (VIOXX, 
      12.5 mg qd) or Arthrotec (diclofenac 50 mg/misoprostol 200 mcg bid). METHODS:
      Double-blind, parallel-group, 6-week study of patients aged > or = 40 years with 
      a clinical diagnosis of OA treated with rofecoxib or Arthrotec. Primary endpoint:
      self-reported diarrhea; secondary endpoints: abdominal pain, discontinuations due
      to AEs, GI AEs and NSAID-type GI AEs (ie., acid reflux, dyspepsia, epigastric
      discomfort, heartburn, nausea, vomiting). RESULTS: Among 483 patients (80.3%
      females, mean age 62.1), the rofecoxib group vs the Arthrotec group respectively 
      reported diarrhea 6.2% vs 16.2% (p<0.001); drug-related diarrhea 3.7% vs 16.2%
      (p<0.001); one or more clinical AEs 52.9% vs 73.0% (p<0.001); GI AEs 28.9% vs
      48.5% (p<0.001); NSAID-type GI AEs 18.6% vs 29.9% (p=0.004); discontinuations due
      to abdominal pain 0.4% vs 3.7% (p<0.05); and discontinuations due to any AE 4.1% 
      vs 9.1% (p=0.029). No significant differences were observed in efficacy.
      CONCLUSION: Rofecoxib 12.5 mg qd has improved GI tolerability and similar
      efficacy compared to Arthrotec (diclofenac 50 mg/misoprostol 200 mcg bid).

TI  - Celecoxib versus diclofenac in the management of osteoarthritis of the knee.
PG  - 11-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A clinical trial was conducted in 600 patients with OA of the knee to 
      test the hypothesis that the specific COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, has equivalent 
      efficacy and a superior tolerability/safety profile when compared to diclofenac, 
      the current worldwide standard of care. METHODS: Patients were administered
      celecoxib 100 mg BID, diclofenac 50 mg TID or placebo for 6 weeks in a
      multicentre, double-blind. placebo-controlled trial. RESULTS: Primary efficacy
      measures (index joint pain by VAS, WOMAC index) indicated statistically
      significant improvement versus placebo for both celecoxib and diclofenac and no
      statistically significant differences between celecoxib and diclofenac. American 
      Pain Society (APS) measures to assess the rapidity of onset of action showed
      statistically significant and comparable pain relief versus placebo within 24 h
      for both celecoxib and diclofenac. More diclofenac patients reported GI side
      effects than patients treated with either placebo or celecoxib.
      Diclofenac-treated patients experienced statistically significant elevations in
      mean hepatic transaminases and serum creatinine and reductions in haemoglobin
      concentration when compared to placebo, events not observed with celecoxib.
      CONCLUSION: Celecoxib 200 mg daily is as effective as diclofenac 150 mg daily for
      relieving signs and symptoms of OA of the knee, including pain, and has a rapid
      onset of action. However, celecoxib appears to have a superior safety and
      tolerability profile.

TI  - Efficacy of celecoxib, a cyclooxygenase 2-specific inhibitor, in the treatment of
      ankylosing spondylitis: a six-week controlled study with comparison against
      placebo and against a conventional nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug.
PG  - 180-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the short-term efficacy of celecoxib, a cyclooxygenase
      2-specific inhibitor, in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis (AS). METHODS:
      The study was a 6-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 3 
      treatment arms: placebo, ketoprofen 100 mg twice daily, and celecoxib 100 mg
      twice daily. Patients who had AS according to the modified New York criteria,
      without peripheral synovitis and with active disease (pain > or =40 mm on a
      100-mm visual analog scale [VAS] and an increase in pain of at least 30% after
      nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug withdrawal) were eligible for study. Primary
      outcome measures were change in pain intensity (VAS) and change in functional
      impairment (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index [BASFI]). RESULTS: Of
      the 246 randomized patients, 76 were allocated to receive placebo, 90 ketoprofen,
      and 80 celecoxib. There were no statistically significant differences between
      treatment groups at study entry. During the 6 weeks of the study, the decrease in
      pain and functional impairment was greater in the active treatment groups than in
      the placebo group, with a trend in favor of celecoxib when the 2 active
      treatments were compared. The mean changes were -13 mm, -21 mm, and -27 mm (P =
      0.006) for pain and 1, -6, and -12 (P = 0.0008) for BASFI score in the placebo,
      ketoprofen, and celecoxib groups, respectively. During treatment, the number of
      patients reporting epigastric pain was 6 (8%), 13 (14%), and 10 (13%) in the
      placebo, ketoprofen, and celecoxib groups, respectively. CONCLUSION: The results 
      of this study confirm the clinically relevant antiinflammatory effect of
      celecoxib at a 200-mg daily dosage, with significant improvement of both pain and
      function in patients with AS.

TI  - Rofecoxib, a new cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, shows sustained efficacy, comparable
      with other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: a 6-week and a 1-year trial in
      patients with osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis Studies Group.
PG  - 1124-34
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Rofecoxib, a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor (sometimes known as a
      specific cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor or Coxib), is used in osteoarthritis (OA).
      Published information indicates rofecoxib's improved gastrointestinal safety
      profile over nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs).
      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of rofecoxib in treating OA in 2
      studies. METHODS: Two randomized, double-blind, parallel-group studies in
      patients with OA of the knee or hip were conducted using identical entry criteria
      and end points. A 6-week placebo-controlled trial in 736 patients compared 12.5
      and 25 mg of rofecoxib once daily with 800 mg of ibuprofen 3 times daily, and a
      1-year study compared 12.5 and 25 mg of rofecoxib once daily with 50 mg of
      diclofenac 3 times daily in 693 patients. RESULTS: Rofecoxib, at 12.5 and 25 mg, 
      demonstrated efficacy clinically comparable with ibuprofen, assessed by 3 primary
      end points according to predefined comparability criteria. Both rofecoxib doses
      and ibuprofen provided significantly greater efficacy than placebo on all primary
      end points at 6 weeks. Both rofecoxib doses and diclofenac showed similar
      efficacy over 1 year. All treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Rofecoxib 
      is effective in treating OA with once-daily dosing for 6 weeks and 1 year.
      Rofecoxib was generally safe and well-tolerated in OA patients for 6 weeks and 1 
      year. Arch Fam Med. 2000;9:1124-1134

TI  - Comparison of upper gastrointestinal toxicity of rofecoxib and naproxen in
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis. VIGOR Study Group.
PG  - 1520-8, 2 p following 1528
AB  - BACKGROUND: Each year, clinical upper gastrointestinal events occur in 2 to 4
      percent of patients who are taking nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory
      drugs (NSAIDs). We assessed whether rofecoxib, a selective inhibitor of
      cyclooxygenase-2, would be associated with a lower incidence of clinically
      important upper gastrointestinal events than is the nonselective NSAID naproxen
      among patients with rheumatoid arthritis. METHODS: We randomly assigned 8076
      patients who were at least 50 years of age (or at least 40 years of age and
      receiving long-term glucocorticoid therapy) and who had rheumatoid arthritis to
      receive either 50 mg of rofecoxib daily or 500 mg of naproxen twice daily. The
      primary end point was confirmed clinical upper gastrointestinal events
      (gastroduodenal perforation or obstruction, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and 
      symptomatic gastroduodenal ulcers). RESULTS: Rofecoxib and naproxen had similar
      efficacy against rheumatoid arthritis. During a median follow-up of 9.0 months,
      2.1 confirmed gastrointestinal events per 100 patient-years occurred with
      rofecoxib, as compared with 4.5 per 100 patient-years with naproxen (relative
      risk, 0.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.3 to 0.6; P<0.001). The respective
      rates of complicated confirmed events (perforation, obstruction, and severe upper
      gastrointestinal bleeding) were 0.6 per 100 patient-years and 1.4 per 100
      patient-years (relative risk, 0.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.2 to 0.8;
      P=0.005). The incidence of myocardial infarction was lower among patients in the 
      naproxen group than among those in the rofecoxib group (0.1 percent vs. 0.4
      percent; relative risk, 0.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.1 to 0.7); the
      overall mortality rate and the rate of death from cardiovascular causes were
      similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with rheumatoid arthritis,
      treatment with rofecoxib, a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2, is
      associated with significantly fewer clinically important upper gastrointestinal
      events than treatment with naproxen, a nonselective inhibitor.

TI  - Gastrointestinal toxicity with celecoxib vs nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
      for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis: the CLASS study: A randomized
      controlled trial. Celecoxib Long-term Arthritis Safety Study.
PG  - 1247-55
AB  - CONTEXT: Conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are
      associated with a spectrum of toxic effects, notably gastrointestinal (GI)
      effects, because of inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1. Whether COX-2-specific 
      inhibitors are associated with fewer clinical GI toxic effects is unknown.
      OBJECTIVE: To determine whether celecoxib, a COX-2-specific inhibitor, is
      associated with a lower incidence of significant upper GI toxic effects and other
      adverse effects compared with conventional NSAIDs. DESIGN: The Celecoxib
      Long-term Arthritis Safety Study (CLASS), a double-blind, randomized controlled
      trial conducted from September 1998 to March 2000. SETTING: Three hundred
      eighty-six clinical sites in the United States and Canada. PARTICIPANTS: A total 
      of 8059 patients (>/=18 years old) with osteoarthritis (OA) or rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA) were enrolled in the study, and 7968 received at least 1 dose of
      study drug. A total of 4573 patients (57%) received treatment for 6 months.
      INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive celecoxib, 400 mg twice
      per day (2 and 4 times the maximum RA and OA dosages, respectively; n = 3987);
      ibuprofen, 800 mg 3 times per day (n = 1985); or diclofenac, 75 mg twice per day 
      (n = 1996). Aspirin use for cardiovascular prophylaxis (</=325 mg/d) was
      permitted. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of prospectively defined symptomatic 
      upper GI ulcers and ulcer complications (bleeding, perforation, and obstruction) 
      and other adverse effects during the 6-month treatment period. RESULTS: For all
      patients, the annualized incidence rates of upper GI ulcer complications alone
      and combined with symptomatic ulcers for celecoxib vs NSAIDs were 0.76% vs 1.45% 
      (P =.09) and 2. 08% vs 3.54% (P =.02), respectively. For patients not taking
      aspirin, the annualized incidence rates of upper GI ulcer complications alone and
      combined with symptomatic ulcers for celecoxib vs NSAIDs were 0.44% vs 1.27% (P
      =.04) and 1.40% vs 2.91% (P =.02). For patients taking aspirin, the annualized
      incidence rates of upper GI ulcer complications alone and combined with
      symptomatic ulcers for celecoxib vs NSAIDs were 2.01% vs 2.12% (P =.92) and 4.70%
      vs 6.00% (P =.49). Fewer celecoxib-treated patients than NSAID-treated patients
      experienced chronic GI blood loss, GI intolerance, hepatotoxicity, or renal
      toxicity. No difference was noted in the incidence of cardiovascular events
      between celecoxib and NSAIDs, irrespective of aspirin use. CONCLUSIONS: In this
      study, celecoxib, at dosages greater than those indicated clinically, was
      associated with a lower incidence of symptomatic ulcers and ulcer complications
      combined, as well as other clinically important toxic effects, compared with
      NSAIDs at standard dosages. The decrease in upper GI toxicity was strongest among
      patients not taking aspirin concomitantly. JAMA. 2000;284:1247-1255

      rofecoxib vs ibuprofen in patients with osteoarthritis. Rofecoxib/Ibuprofen
      Comparator Study Group.
PG  - 1781-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit both
      cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). It is not known whether a 
      specific inhibitor of COX-2 will provide efficacy in osteoarthritis (OA)
      comparable with NSAIDs. Therefore, we compared the efficacy and safety of the
      rofecoxib, which specifically inhibits COX-2, with those of the NSAID ibuprofen
      in patients with OA. OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical efficacy and tolerability
      of rofecoxib (12.5 and 25 mg once daily) with ibuprofen (800 mg 3 times daily).
      METHODS: A randomized, double-blind trial of 809 adults with OA was conducted.
      Patients with OA in whom the knee or hip was the primary source of pain were
      randomized to 1 of 4 treatment groups on demonstration of disease activity:
      placebo; rofecoxib, 12.5 or 25 mg once daily; or ibuprofen, 800 mg 3 times daily.
      Clinical efficacy and safety were monitored during a 6-week treatment period.
      RESULTS: Both doses of rofecoxib demonstrated efficacy clinically comparable with
      ibuprofen as assessed by 3 primary end points (pain walking on a flat surface
      [Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index], patient global 
      assessment of response to therapy, and investigator global assessment of disease 
      status) according to predefined comparability criteria. Both rofecoxib doses and 
      the ibuprofen dose provided significantly (P<.001) greater efficacy than placebo 
      on all primary end points. Results from secondary end points were consistent with
      those of the primary end points. All treatments were well tolerated; the overall 
      incidence rates of clinical adverse experiences were not significantly different 
      (P>.05) among the treatment groups. CONCLUSION: Rofecoxib was well tolerated and 
      provided clinical efficacy comparable with a high dose of the NSAID ibuprofen.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical efficacy of rofecoxib, a specific inhibitor of
      cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), with that of diclofenac in patients with osteoarthritis
      (OA) and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of rofecoxib. METHODS: We
      performed a randomized, double-blind, active comparator-controlled trial in 784
      adults with OA of the knee or hip. Patients were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment
      groups: 12.5 mg of rofecoxib once daily, 25 mg of rofecoxib once daily, and 50 mg
      of diclofenac 3 times daily. Clinical efficacy and safety were evaluated over a
      1-year continuous treatment period. RESULTS: Rofecoxib at dosages of 12.5 and 25 
      mg demonstrated efficacy that was clinically comparable to that of diclofenac, as
      assessed by all 3 primary end points according to predefined comparability
      criteria. Results from secondary end points were consistent with those of the
      primary end points. There were small statistical differences favoring diclofenac 
      for 2 of the end points. All treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSION:
      Rofecoxib was well tolerated and provided efficacy that was clinically
      comparable, according to predefined statistical criteria, to that of 150 mg of
      diclofenac per day in this 1-year study. Specific inhibition of COX-2 provided
      therapeutic efficacy in OA.

TI  - Comparison of the effect of rofecoxib (a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor), ibuprofen, 
      and placebo on the gastroduodenal mucosa of patients with osteoarthritis: a
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The Rofecoxib Osteoarthritis 
      Endoscopy Multinational Study Group.
PG  - 370-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This randomized, double-blind study tested the hypothesis that
      rofecoxib, a drug that specifically inhibits cyclooxygenase 2, would cause fewer 
      gastroduodenal ulcers than ibuprofen (in a multicenter trial), and its side
      effects would be equivalent to those of placebo (in a prespecified analysis
      combining the results with another trial of identical design). METHODS: Seven
      hundred seventy-five patients with osteoarthritis were randomized to receive
      rofecoxib at a dosage of 25 mg or 50 mg once daily, ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times
      daily, or placebo. Gastroduodenal ulceration was assessed by endoscopy at 6, 12, 
      and (for active treatment) 24 weeks. The primary and secondary end points were
      the incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers at 12 and 24 weeks, respectively. RESULTS:
      Ulcers were significantly less common (P < 0.001) following treatment with
      rofecoxib (25 mg or 50 mg) than with ibuprofen after 12 weeks (5.3% and 8.8%
      versus 29.2%, respectively) or 24 weeks (9.9% and 12.4% versus 46.8%,
      respectively). In the combined analysis, the 12-week ulcer incidence with 25 mg
      rofecoxib (4.7%) and with placebo (7.3%) satisfied prespecified criteria for
      equivalence. CONCLUSION: At 2-4 times the therapeutically effective dose,
      rofecoxib caused fewer endoscopically detected ulcers than did ibuprofen.
      Rofecoxib at a dose of 25 mg (the highest dose recommended for osteoarthritis)
      satisfied prespecified criteria for equivalence to placebo.

TI  - Celecoxib versus diclofenac in long-term management of rheumatoid arthritis:
      randomised double-blind comparison.
PG  - 2106-11
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit
      cyclo-oxygenase (COX), which leads to suppression of COX-1-mediated production of
      gastrointestinal-protective prostaglandins. Gastrointestinal injury is a common
      outcome. We compared the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of long-term therapy 
      with celecoxib, a COX-1 sparing inhibitor of COX-2, with diclofenac, a
      non-specific COX inhibitor. METHODS: 655 patients with adult-onset rheumatoid
      arthritis of at least 6 months' duration were randomly assigned oral celecoxib
      200 mg twice daily or diclofenac SR 75 mg twice daily for 24 weeks.
      Anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity and tolerability were assessed at
      baseline, every 4 weeks, and at week 24. We assessed gastrointestinal safety by
      upper-gastrointestinal endoscopy within 7 days of the last treatment dose at
      centres where the procedure was available. Analysis was by intention-to-treat.
      FINDINGS: 430 patients underwent endoscopy (celecoxib n=212, diclofenac n=218).
      The two drugs were similar in management of rheumatoid arthritis pain and
      inflammation. Gastroduodenal ulcers were detected endoscopically in 33 (15%)
      patients treated with diclofenac and in eight (4%) in the celecoxib group
      (p<0.001). The rate of withdrawal for any gastrointestinal-related adverse event,
      most commonly abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and dyspepsia, was nearly three times
      higher in the diclofenac-treated group than in the celecoxib group (16 vs 6%;
      p<0.001). INTERPRETATION: Celecoxib showed sustained anti-inflammatory and
      analgesic activity similar to diclofenac, with a lower frequency of upper
      gastrointestinal ulceration or gastrointestinal adverse events, and tolerability 
      was better.

TI  - Anti-inflammatory and upper gastrointestinal effects of celecoxib in rheumatoid
      arthritis: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 1921-8
AB  - CONTEXT: In vitro studies have shown that celecoxib inhibits cyclooxygenase 2
      (COX-2) but not COX-1, suggesting that this drug may have anti-inflammatory and
      analgesic activity without adverse upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract effects that
      result from COX-1 inhibition. OBJECTIVE: To test whether celecoxib has efficacy
      as an anti-inflammatory and analgesic with reduced GI tract mucosal damage
      compared with conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in patients with 
      rheumatoid arthritis. DESIGN: Randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled,
      double-blind trial lasting 12 weeks, with follow-up at weeks 2, 6, and 12, from
      September 1996 thorugh February 1998. SETTING: Seventy-nine clinical sites in the
      United States and Canada. PATIENTS: A total of 1149 patients aged 18 years or
      older with symptomatic rheumatoid arthritis who met inclusion criteria were
      randomized; 688 (60%) of these completed the study. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were 
      randomized to receive celecoxib, 100 mg, 200 mg, or 400 mg twice per day (n =
      240, 235, and 218, respectively); naproxen, 500 mg twice per day (n = 225); or
      placebo (n = 231). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Improvement in signs and symptoms of
      rheumatoid arthritis as assessed using standard measures of efficacy and GI tract
      safety as assessed by upper GI tract endoscopy before and after treatment,
      compared among treatment groups. RESULTS: All dosages of celecoxib and naproxen
      significantly improved the signs and symptoms of arthritis compared with placebo.
      Maximal anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity was evident within 2 weeks of
      initiating treatment and was sustained throughout the 12 weeks. The incidence of 
      endoscopically determined gastroduodenal ulcers in placebo-treated patients was 4
      (4%) of 99, and the incidences across all dosages of celecoxib were not
      significantly different (P>.40): 9 (6%) of 148 with 100 mg twice per day, 6 (4%) 
      of 145 with 200 mg twice per day, and 8 (6%) of 130 with 400 mg twice per day. In
      contrast, the incidence with naproxen was 36 (26%) of 137, significantly greater 
      than either placebo or celecoxib (P<.001). The overall incidences of GI tract
      adverse effects were 19% for placebo; 28%, 25%, and 26% for celecoxib 100 mg, 200
      mg, and 400 mg twice per day, respectively; and 31 % for naproxen. CONCLUSION: In
      this study, all dosages of celecoxib were efficacious in the treatment of
      rheumatoid arthritis and did not affect COX-1 activity in the GI tract mucosa as 
      evidenced by less frequent incidence of endoscopic ulcers compared with naproxen.

TI  - Treatment of osteoarthritis with celecoxib, a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor: a
      randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 1095-105
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of celecoxib, a cyclooxygenase-2
      (COX-2) inhibitor, with those of naproxen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug 
      (NSAID), and placebo in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee. METHODS: In 
      this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 1003
      patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee were randomly assigned to
      receive celecoxib at doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg twice a day; naproxen, 500 mg
      twice a day; or placebo for 12 weeks. Patients were evaluated with standard
      measures of efficacy 2 to 7 days after discontinuing previous NSAID or analgesic 
      therapy and after 2, 6, and 12 weeks of treatment with the study drug. RESULTS:
      Celecoxib treatment led to significant improvement in the signs and symptoms of
      osteoarthritis as determined by all efficacy measures. Significant pain relief
      occurred within 2 days of the initiation of treatment, and maximum
      anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity, evident within 2 weeks, was sustained
      throughout the 12-week study. All celecoxib doses were efficacious compared with 
      placebo, although the 50-mg twice-daily dosage regimen was minimally effective.
      The higher doses of celecoxib (100 and 200 mg twice a day) were similarly
      efficacious, and the magnitude of improvement observed with these dosing regimens
      was comparable to that seen with naproxen at a dose of 500 mg twice a day. All
      doses of celecoxib and naproxen were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: COX-2 inhibition
      with celecoxib is an effective approach for the treatment of osteoarthritis, as
      seen by clinical improvement in signs and symptoms comparable to treatment with
      naproxen.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the functional status of patients with signs and
      symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee after treatment with celecoxib compared
      with placebo and naproxen. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, double-blind,
      parallel-group, 12-week trial. SETTING: Multicenter study conducted at 71 sites
      in the United States and Canada. PATIENTS: One thousand four patients with active
      osteoarthritis of the knee in a flare state. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were
      assigned randomly to one of five treatment groups: placebo; celecoxib 50 mg
      twice/day, 100 mg twice/day, and 200 mg twice/day; and naproxen 500 mg twice/day.
      MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities
      Osteoarthritis Index was used to measure functional status. At the end of the
      treatment period, patients in the four active treatment groups had significantly 
      better functional status than those receiving placebo. Patients treated with
      celecoxib 100 mg twice/day had significantly better improvements in pain scores
      than those treated with placebo and naproxen. CONCLUSION: Celecoxib was better
      than placebo and comparable with naproxen in improving aspects of functional
      status in patients with osteoarthritis.

TI  - A randomized trial comparing the effect of rofecoxib, a cyclooxygenase 2-specific
      inhibitor, with that of ibuprofen on the gastroduodenal mucosa of patients with
      osteoarthritis. Rofecoxib Osteoarthritis Endoscopy Study Group.
PG  - 776-83
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Prostaglandin production in the normal gastrointestinal tract,
      believed to be critical for mucosal integrity, is mediated by cyclooxygenase
      (COX)-1, whereas prostaglandin production at inflammatory sites seems to occur
      via induction of COX-2. We hypothesized that COX-2-specific inhibition with
      rofecoxib (25 mg once daily) in the treatment of patients with osteoarthritis
      would cause fewer gastroduodenal ulcers than an equally effective dose of
      ibuprofen (800 mg 3 times a day), a nonspecific COX inhibitor. METHODS: A total
      of 742 osteoarthritis patients without ulcers on baseline endoscopy were randomly
      assigned to receive rofecoxib (25 or 50 mg once daily), ibuprofen (800 mg 3 times
      daily), or placebo. Endoscopy was repeated at 6, 12, and 24 weeks. At 16 weeks,
      by study design, 95% of the placebo group and 5% of the other groups were
      discontinued. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers >/=3 mm 
      with rofecoxib (25 or 50 mg once daily) was significantly (P < 0.001) lower than 
      with ibuprofen and was statistically equivalent to placebo at week 12 (placebo,
      9.9%; 25 mg rofecoxib, 4.1%; 50 mg rofecoxib, 7.3%; and ibuprofen, 27.7%). At 24 
      weeks, ulcer rates were 25 mg rofecoxib, 9. 6%; 50 mg rofecoxib, 14.7%; and
      ibuprofen, 45.8% (P < 0.001, ibuprofen vs. 25 and 50 mg rofecoxib). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Rofecoxib, at doses 2-4 times the dose demonstrated to relieve symptoms of
      osteoarthritis, caused significantly less gastroduodenal ulceration than
      ibuprofen, with ulcer rates comparable to placebo.

TI  - Improvement in gastrointestinal tolerability of the selective cyclooxygenase
      (COX)-2 inhibitor, meloxicam, compared with piroxicam: results of the Safety and 
      Efficacy Large-scale Evaluation of COX-inhibiting Therapies (SELECT) trial in
      osteoarthritis.
PG  - 946-51
AB  - SELECT is a large-scale, prospective, international, multicentre, double-blind,
      double-dummy, randomized, parallel-group trial. Patients with exacerbation of
      osteoarthritis were treated with the recommended dose of meloxicam (7.5 mg) or
      piroxicam (20 mg) once daily for 28 days; 4320 patients were administered
      meloxicam and 4336 piroxicam. The incidence of adverse events was significantly
      lower in the meloxicam group (22.5%) compared with the piroxicam group (27.9%; P 
      < 0.001), mainly due to the significantly lower incidence of gastrointestinal
      (GI) adverse events in the meloxicam than in the piroxicam group (10.3% vs
      15.4%,; P < 0.001), while the efficacy of both drugs was equivalent. Individual
      GI events occurred significantly less often with meloxicam than piroxicam:
      dyspepsia (3.4% vs 5.8%; P < 0.001), nausea/vomiting (2.5% vs 3.4%; P < 0.05) and
      abdominal pain (2.1% vs 3.6%; P < 0.001). There were 16 patients with
      perforations, ulcerations or bleeding (PUBs) of the upper GI tract in the
      piroxicam group compared with seven in the meloxicam group (relative risk
      piroxicam:meloxicam = 1.4). Four PUBs were complicated (perforations or
      bleedings); none of these occurred in the meloxicam group (relative risk
      piroxicam:meloxicam = 1.9). The outcome of SELECT is consistent with that of the 
      large-scale clinical trial of similar design and size which compared 7.5 mg
      meloxicam with 100 mg diclofenac in patients with osteoarthritis, and with a
      previous global analysis of the safety of meloxicam. It adds further data to the 
      proposed relationship between selective inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 and
      improved GI tolerability of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

TI  - Gastrointestinal tolerability of meloxicam compared to diclofenac in
      osteoarthritis patients. International MELISSA Study Group. Meloxicam Large-scale
      International Study Safety Assessment.
PG  - 937-45
AB  - Although widely used, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are
      associated with a high incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) side-effects.
      Inhibition of the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme is the basis for both the efficacy 
      and toxicity of NSAIDs. The discovery of two COX isoforms, constitutive COX-1 and
      inducible COX-2, has led to the hypothesis that selective inhibition of COX-2
      will minimize the potential for GI toxicity without compromising efficacy. The
      Meloxicam Large-scale International Study Safety Assessment (MELISSA) trial
      reported here was therefore set up to investigate the tolerability of meloxicam, 
      a preferential inhibitor of COX-2, compared to diclofenac. MELISSA was a
      large-scale, double-blind, randomized, international, prospective trial,
      conducted over 28 days in patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis. Patients
      received either meloxicam 7.5 mg or diclofenac 100 mg slow release, the
      recommended doses for the treatment of osteoarthritis. Evaluation of the profile 
      of adverse events was the main aim of the trial, together with assessment of
      efficacy. A total of 9323 patients received treatment (4635 and 4688 in the
      meloxicam and diclofenac groups, respectively). Significantly fewer adverse
      events were reported by patients receiving meloxicam. This was attributable to
      fewer GI adverse events (13%) compared to diclofenac (19%; P < 0.001). Of the
      most common GI adverse events, there was significantly less dyspepsia (P <
      0.001), nausea and vomiting (P < 0.05), abdominal pain (P < 0.001) and diarrhoea 
      (P < 0.001) with meloxicam compared to diclofenac. Five patients on meloxicam
      experienced a perforation, ulcer or bleed vs seven on diclofenac (not
      significant). No endoscopically verified ulcer complication was detected in the
      meloxicam group compared to four with diclofenac. There were five patient days of
      hospitalization in patients on meloxicam compared to 121 with diclofenac. Adverse
      events caused withdrawal from the study in 254 patients receiving meloxicam
      (5.48%) compared to 373 (7.96%) on diclofenac (P < 0.001). These differences were
      attributable to differences in reported GI adverse events (3.02% on meloxicam vs 
      6.14% on diclofenac; P < 0.001). Differences in efficacy, as assessed by visual
      analogue scales, consistently favoured diclofenac. In all instances, 95%
      confidence intervals did not cross zero, suggesting a statistically significant
      effect. However, differences were small (4.5-9.01% difference) and did not reach 
      pre-determined levels of clinical significance. Nevertheless, significantly more 
      patients discontinued meloxicam because of lack of efficacy (80 out of 4635 vs 49
      out of 4688; P < 0.01). The MELISSA trial confirms earlier studies suggesting
      that meloxicam has a significantly improved GI tolerability profile in comparison
      with other NSAIDs, including diclofenac. These results may in part reflect the
      preferential COX-2 selectivity of meloxicam, although the dose and other aspects 
      of tolerability may be important. These results may provide support for the
      hypothesis that selective inhibition of COX-2 relative to COX-1 might be an
      effective approach towards improved NSAID therapy.

TI  - A double-blind, randomized trial to compare meloxicam 15 mg with diclofenac 100
      mg in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee.
PG  - 283-8
AB  - Meloxicam is a new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), which, in animal 
      tests, displays a high potency for anti-inflammatory and analgesic action. The
      aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of 15 mg
      meloxicam in comparison with 100 mg slow-release diclofenac in patients with
      osteoarthritis of the knee. Two hundred and fifty-eight patients were included in
      the intent-to-treat analysis; these were randomized into two groups to receive
      either 15 mg meloxicam (N = 128) or 100 mg diclofenac (N = 130) for a period of 6
      weeks. The results with respect to efficacy showed a trend in favor of meloxicam 
      regarding pain on movement, global efficacy and paracetamol consumption, although
      these differences did not reach statistical significance. The most
      frequently-occurring adverse events in both groups were of a gastrointestinal
      (GI) nature. However, there was a higher incidence (26 vs 16%) of GI adverse
      events in the diclofenac group compared with the meloxicam group. Both drugs were
      well tolerated when assessed by the patients on a visual analog scale (VAS).
      Thus, 15 mg meloxicam is an effective and well-tolerated therapy for
      osteoarthritis and compares favorably with diclofenac 100 mg, a well-established 
      treatment for this indication.

TI  - Meloxicam in osteoarthritis: a 6-month, double-blind comparison with diclofenac
      sodium.
PG  - 39-43
AB  - A multicentre, double-blind, randomized study was conducted in patients with
      osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip or knee in order to compare the efficacy and
      safety of the new cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, meloxicam, with diclofenac 
      sodium, a conventional treatment for this condition. Three hundred and thirty-six
      patients were treated with oral meloxicam 7.5 mg once daily or diclofenac 100 mg 
      slow release once daily for 6 months. There were no significant differences
      between the treatment groups with respect to overall pain, pain on movement,
      global efficacy or quality of life scores at the end of treatment, all of which
      showed good levels of improvement. Sixty-six patients were withdrawn after the
      start of the double-blind phase due to adverse events (n = 21, meloxicam; n = 31,
      diclofenac) or to lack of efficacy (seven in each group). The median of dose
      paracetamol taken concomitantly was statistically significantly lower in the
      meloxicam group than in the diclofenac group (185 vs 245 mg/day; P = 0.0123) with
      a comparable proportion of patients taking concomitant paracetamol therapy in
      both groups. Both drugs were well tolerated, although severe adverse events,
      treatment withdrawal and clinically significant laboratory abnormalities were
      more common with diclofenac than with meloxicam. Thus, meloxicam 7.5 mg is a safe
      and effective treatment for OA of the hip and knee which demonstrates a trend
      towards an improved safety profile compared with diclofenac.

AB  - Meloxicam 15 mg once daily (n = 128) was compared with piroxicam 20 mg (n = 127) 
      in this 6 week, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized, multicentre study in
      out-patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip. Assessments of
      pain, global efficacy and global tolerance were made on a 10 cm horizontal visual
      analogue scale; severity of OA was evaluated by Lequesne's index. Efficacy
      results showed significant improvement compared with baseline, with no
      significant difference between meloxicam 15 mg and piroxicam 20 mg. The type and 
      frequency of adverse events were comparable for the two drugs. The most frequent 
      events reported were gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, occurring in 21 and 23% of 
      meloxicam and piroxicam patients respectively. The global tolerance assessment by
      patients at the end of treatment favoured meloxicam. In conclusion, meloxicam at 
      a dose of 15 mg/day is comparable in efficacy and safety to piroxicam 20 mg.

PG  - 22-8
AB  - Meloxicam is a new non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) which
      preferentially inhibits cyclooxygenase-2 over cyclooxygenase-1. A double-blind
      parallel-group trial compared meloxicam 7.5 mg once daily (n = 199) with naproxen
      750 mg (n = 180) in rheumatoid arthritis. There was no significant difference
      between the groups regarding the primary efficacy variables (global efficacy
      assessment by patient and investigator, number of painful/tender and swollen
      joints) and eight of the ten secondary efficacy endpoints. Only the swollen joint
      severity index and the number of discontinuations due to lack of efficacy
      favoured naproxen 750 mg significantly over meloxicam 7.5 mg. Meloxicam was
      better tolerated in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, with fewer GI adverse events
      in the meloxicam-treated group (30.3%) than in the naproxen-treated group
      (44.7%), where two patients developed ulcers. No ulcers were seen in meloxicam
      patients. Significantly more patients discontinued due to GI adverse events in
      the naproxen group. Additionally, there was a significant decrease in haemoglobin
      and a significant increase in serum creatinine and urea in the naproxen group
      compared with the meloxicam group. In conclusion, meloxicam 7.5 mg once daily is 
      a promising treatment in rheumatoid arthritis, with efficacy comparable to
      naproxen 750 mg. Meloxicam has the advantage of a significantly lower incidence
      of GI and renal side effects.

TI  - Misoprostol reduces serious gastrointestinal complications in patients with
      rheumatoid arthritis receiving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. A
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 241-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether concurrent administration of misoprostol
      reduces the occurrence of serious upper gastrointestinal complications, such as
      perforation, gastric outlet obstruction, or bleeding, in patients with rheumatoid
      arthritis who are receiving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
      DESIGN: 6-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: 664 
      clinical practices of family medicine, internal medicine, or rheumatology in the 
      United States and Canada. PATIENTS: 8843 men and women (mean age, 68 years)
      receiving continuous therapy with any of 10 specified NSAIDs for control of
      symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Patients were enrolled between July 1991 and
      August 1993. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned to receive 200
      micrograms of misoprostol or placebo four times a day. MEASUREMENTS: Development 
      of serious upper gastrointestinal complications detected by clinical symptoms or 
      findings (not by scheduled endoscopy). RESULTS: Serious upper gastrointestinal
      complications were reduced by 40% (odds ratio, 0.598 [95% CI, 0.364 to 0.982; P =
      0.049]) among patients receiving misoprostol (25 of 4404 patients) compared with 
      those receiving placebo (42 of 4439 patients). During the first month, more
      patients receiving misoprostol (20%) than placebo (15%) withdrew from the study, 
      primarily because of diarrhea and related problems (P < 0.001). Risk factors for 
      serious upper gastrointestinal complications were increasing age, history of
      peptic ulcer or bleeding, and cardiovascular disease. Patients with all four risk
      factors would have a 9% risk for a major complication in 6 months. CONCLUSIONS:
      In older patients with rheumatoid arthritis, misoprostol reduced serious
      NSAID-induced upper gastrointestinal complications by 40% compared with placebo.

TI  - Channelling bias and the incidence of gastrointestinal haemorrhage in users of
      meloxicam, coxibs, and older, non-specific non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
PG  - 1265-70
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although clinical trial results suggest that meloxicam has less
      gastrointestinal toxicity than most other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
      (NSAIDs), in practice it has been associated with a large number of yellow card
      reports of gastrointestinal complications. AIMS: To estimate whether meloxicam
      and the coxibs, rofecoxib and celecoxib, have been channelled towards high risk
      patients, and to estimate the risk of hospitalisation for gastrointestinal
      haemorrhage associated with the use of these drugs, allowing for the effects of
      channelling. PATIENTS: Using the UK General Practice Research Database, this
      study included 7.1 thousand patient years (tpy) exposure to meloxicam, 1.6 tpy
      exposure to coxibs, and 628 tpy exposure to older non-specific NSAIDs. METHODS:
      Cohort study of patients who received a prescription for an NSAID between June
      1987 and January 2001. Exposure to newer NSAIDs (meloxicam, rofecoxib, celecoxib)
      and to older non-specific NSAIDs was identified. Channelling was assessed on
      factors including: demographic variables; diagnosis of arthritis; history of
      NSAID use or gastrointestinal events, including gastrointestinal haemorrhage; and
      use of ulcer healing drugs. RESULTS: Most risk factors for gastrointestinal
      haemorrhage were more prevalent among patients prescribed the newer NSAIDs.
      Adjusting for these risk factors reduced the relative risks of gastrointestinal
      haemorrhage on meloxicam and coxibs versus older non-specific NSAIDs to 0.84 (95%
      confidence interval 0.60, 1.17) and 0.36 (0.14, 0.97), respectively. CONCLUSIONS:
      Channelling towards high risk gastrointestinal patients occurred in the
      prescribing of newer NSAIDs. After attempting to correct for channelling bias,
      coxib exposure, but not meloxicam exposure, was associated with a significantly
      lower risk of gastrointestinal haemorrhage than older non-specific NSAID
      exposure.

TI  - Assessment of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) damage in the human
      gastrointestinal tract.
PG  - 146-55
AB  - Aspirin is widely prescribed and confers considerable benefit to patients by
      reducing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality. Nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are effective analgesics, antipyretics and
      reduce the inflammatory component in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis.
      However, both agents are associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal
      symptoms and the potentially serious consequences of gastroduodenal ulceration,
      bleeding and perforation. The introduction of highly selective cyclo-oxygenase
      (COX)-2 inhibitors or the coprescription gastroprotective agents with
      nonselective NSAIDs have offered strategies to reduce the incidence of such
      events. This review article analyzes the quantitative techniques that can be
      employed by clinical pharmacologists and the clinical studies performed to assess
      NSAID damage in the gastrointestinal tract.

TI  - Low frequency of upper gastrointestinal complications in a cohort of high-risk
      patients taking low-dose aspirin or NSAIDS and omeprazole.
PG  - 693-700
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is very little information available on the incidence of
      complications and on the best prevention therapy in high-risk patients taking
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or aspirin.
      Randomized-controlled trials in such patients are rare for ethical reasons. We
      studied the incidence of gastrointestinal complications in high-risk patients
      taking long-term low-dose aspirin or non-aspirin-NSAIDs combined with omeprazole 
      in a real-life clinical setting. METHODS: This was a multicentre, prospective and
      observational study including 247 consecutive high-risk patients who had a
      clinical indication for long-term treatment with either low-dose aspirin or
      non-aspirin NSAIDs and omeprazole therapy. The occurrence of gastrointestinal
      complications was measured. RESULTS: In addition to a recent history of peptic
      ulcer bleeding, all patients had at least 1 other risk factor and 112 (45.3%) had
      3 or more risk factors; 78.9% were taking low-dose aspirin and the remainder
      non-aspirin NSAIDs. Mean follow-up was 14.6 +/- 10.38 months. Three patients
      taking low-dose aspirin developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding (1.2%; 95% CI
      0.3-3.5; 1.0 event/100 patients/year). This was similar to the rate observed in
      studies involving non-high-risk patients taking low-dose aspirin and higher than 
      that observed in patients not taking low-dose aspirin. Two additional patients
      developed a lower gastrointestinal bleeding event (0.81% (0.04%-3.12%); 0.67
      events/100 patients/year), which was within the range expected in NSAID users.
      CONCLUSIONS: The use of omeprazole in the high-risk patient taking low-dose
      aspirin or NSAIDs seems to be a safe therapeutic approach in this population and 
      is associated with a low frequency of upper gastrointestinal complications.

TI  - Comparison of thromboembolic events in patients treated with celecoxib, a
      cyclooxygenase-2 specific inhibitor, versus ibuprofen or diclofenac.
PG  - 425-30
AB  - It has been hypothesized that cyclooxygenase 2 specific inhibitors may increase
      the risk of cardiovascular (CV) thromboembolic events because of their inhibition
      of vascular prostacyclin synthesis and lack of an effect on platelet thromboxane 
      A(2) production and aggregation. Thus, we analyzed the data for celecoxib and
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) from the Celecoxib Long-term
      Arthritis Safety Study to determine the incidences of serious CV thromboembolic
      events. This trial included 3,987 persons randomized to celecoxib 400 mg twice
      daily (2,320 person-years of exposure) and 3,981 persons randomized to either
      ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily or diclofenac 75 mg twice daily (2,203
      person-years). Because acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) use for CV risk prophylaxis (< 
      or =325 mg/day) was permitted, separate analyses were performed for all patients 
      and those not taking ASA. The incidences of serious CV thromboembolic events
      (myocardial infarction, stroke, CV deaths, and peripheral events) were similar,
      and not significantly different, between celecoxib and NSAID comparators
      (combined or individually) for all patients as well as the subgroup of patients
      not taking ASA. This observation was true both for all serious CV thromboembolic 
      events, as well as for individual events. No increase in myocardial infarction
      was apparent, even in patients not taking ASA who were candidates for secondary
      prophylaxis for myocardial infarction. The relative risks for celecoxib versus
      NSAIDs for serious CV thromboembolic events were 1.1 for all patients and 1.1 for
      the subgroup of patients not taking ASA (95% confidence interval 0.7 to 1.6 and
      0.6 to 1.9, respectively). In addition, the incidences of adverse CV events such 
      as hypertension, edema, and congestive heart failure were similar to, or
      significantly lower than, NSAID comparators regardless of the use of ASA. Thus,
      these analyses demonstrate no increased risk of serious CV thromboembolic events 
      associated with celecoxib compared with conventional NSAIDs and therefore do not 
      support the hypothesis of a class adverse effect of cyclooxygenase 2 specific
      inhibitors on the CV system.

TI  - Comparison of cardiovascular thrombotic events in patients with osteoarthritis
      treated with rofecoxib versus nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
      (ibuprofen, diclofenac, and nabumetone).
PG  - 204-9
AB  - Aspirin, nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and specific
      cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors each have distinctive effects on
      COX-1-mediated thromboxane biosynthesis, the major determinant of platelet
      aggregation. It is unclear whether these effects are associated with differences 
      in thrombogenic risks. To compare the risk for thrombotic cardiovascular events
      among patients receiving rofecoxib, nonselective NSAIDs, and placebo,
      cardiovascular safety was assessed in 5,435 participants in 8 phase IIB/III
      osteoarthritis trials. The median treatment exposure was 31/2 months. The primary
      end point assessed was the risk of any arterial or venous thrombotic
      cardiovascular adverse event (AE). A second analysis assessed differences in the 
      Anti-Platelet Trialists' Collaboration (APTC) events, a cluster end point that
      consists of the combined incidence of (1) cardiovascular, hemorrhagic, and
      unknown death; (2) myocardial infarction; and (3) cerebrovascular accident.
      Similar rates of thrombotic cardiovascular AEs were reported with rofecoxib,
      placebo, and comparator nonselective NSAIDs (ibuprofen, diclofenac, or
      nabumetone). In trials that compared rofecoxib with NSAIDs, the incidence of
      thrombotic cardiovascular AEs was 1.93/100 patient-years in the rofecoxib
      treatment group compared with 2.27/100 patient-years in the combined nonselective
      NSAID group. In trials that compared rofecoxib with placebo, the incidence of
      thrombotic cardiovascular AEs was 2.71/100 patient-years in the rofecoxib group
      compared with 2.57/100 patient-years in the placebo group. Consistent with the
      risks of cardiovascular AEs, similar rates of APTC events were reported with
      rofecoxib, placebo, and comparator nonselective NSAIDs. Thus, in the rofecoxib
      osteoarthritis development program, there was no difference between rofecoxib,
      comparator nonselective NSAIDs, and placebo in the risks of cardiovascular
      thrombotic events.

TI  - Cyclooxygenase inhibitors and the antiplatelet effects of aspirin.
PG  - 1809-17
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with arthritis and vascular disease may receive both
      low-dose aspirin and other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. We therefore
      investigated potential interactions between aspirin and commonly prescribed
      arthritis therapies METHODS: We administered the following combinations of drugs 
      for six days: aspirin (81 mg every morning) two hours before ibuprofen (400 mg
      every morning) and the same medications in the reverse order; aspirin two hours
      before acetaminophen (1000 mg every morning) and the same medications in the
      reverse order; aspirin two hours before the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor rofecoxib 
      (25 mg every morning) and the same medications in the reverse order;
      enteric-coated aspirin two hours before ibuprofen (400 mg three times a day); and
      enteric-coated aspirin two hours before delayed-release diclofenac (75 mg twice
      daily) RESULTS: Serum thromboxane B(2) levels (an index of cyclooxygenase-1
      activity in platelets) and platelet aggregation were maximally inhibited 24 hours
      after the administration of aspirin on day 6 in the subjects who took aspirin
      before a single daily dose of any other drug, as well as in those who took
      rofecoxib or acetaminophen before taking aspirin. In contrast, inhibition of
      serum thromboxane B(2) formation and platelet aggregation by aspirin was blocked 
      when a single daily dose of ibuprofen was given before aspirin, as well as when
      multiple daily doses of ibuprofen were given. The concomitant administration of
      rofecoxib, acetaminophen, or diclofenac did not affect the pharmacodynamics of
      aspirin CONCLUSIONS: The concomitant administration of ibuprofen but not
      rofecoxib, acetaminophen, or diclofenac antagonizes the irreversible platelet
      inhibition induced by aspirin. Treatment with ibuprofen in patients with
      increased cardiovascular risk may limit the cardioprotective effects of aspirin.

TI  - Cardiovascular thrombotic events in controlled, clinical trials of rofecoxib.
PG  - 2280-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: In comparing aspirin, nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory
      agents (NSAIDs), and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors, variation in platelet
      inhibitory effects exists that may be associated with differential risks of
      cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events. Among the randomized, controlled trials
      with the COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib, one study demonstrated a significant
      difference between rofecoxib and its NSAID comparator (naproxen) in the risk of
      CV thrombotic events. A combined analysis of individual patient data was
      undertaken to determine whether there was an excess of CV thrombotic events in
      patients treated with rofecoxib compared with those treated with placebo or
      nonselective NSAIDs. METHODS AND RESULTS: CV thrombotic events were assessed
      across 23 phase IIb to V rofecoxib studies. Comparisons were made between
      patients taking rofecoxib and those taking either placebo, naproxen (an NSAID
      with near-complete inhibition of platelet function throughout its dosing
      interval), or another nonselective NSAIDs used in the development program
      (diclofenac, ibuprofen, and nabumetone). The major outcome measure was the
      combined end point used by the Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration, which
      includes CV, hemorrhagic, and unknown deaths; nonfatal myocardial infarctions;
      and nonfatal strokes. More than 28 000 patients, representing >14 000
      patient-years at risk, were analyzed. The relative risk for an end point was 0.84
      (95% CI: 0.51, 1.38) when comparing rofecoxib with placebo; 0.79 (95% CI: 0.40,
      1.55) when comparing rofecoxib with non-naproxen NSAIDs; and 1.69 (95% CI: 1.07, 
      2.69) when comparing rofecoxib with naproxen. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis provides
      no evidence for an excess of CV events for rofecoxib relative to either placebo
      or the non-naproxen NSAIDs that were studied. Differences observed between
      rofecoxib and naproxen are likely the result of the antiplatelet effects of the
      latter agent.

TI  - COX-2 inhibition and thrombotic tendency: a need for surveillance.
PG  - 214-7
AB  - Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors belong to a new class of drugs which have
      anti-inflammatory efficacy similar to that of traditional non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), but are associated with a reduced incidence of 
      adverse upper gastrointestinal events. Biochemical evidence that COX-2 inhibitors
      could promote or exacerbate a tendency to thrombosis is supported by recent
      results from clinical trials and case reports. Two agents in this class,
      celecoxib and rofecoxib, have been listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme
      (PBS) for very broad indications in chronic arthropathies, suggesting that they
      will move into widespread community use. It is important to canvass the
      possibility that use of these agents could be associated with thrombotic events.

TI  - Risk of cardiovascular events associated with selective COX-2 inhibitors.
PG  - 954-9
AB  - Atherosclerosis is a process with inflammatory features and selective
      cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitors may potentially have antiatherogenic effects 
      by virtue of inhibiting inflammation. However, by decreasing vasodilatory and
      antiaggregatory prostacyclin production, COX-2 antagonists may lead to increased 
      prothrombotic activity. To define the cardiovascular effects of COX-2 inhibitors 
      when used for arthritis and musculoskeletal pain in patients without coronary
      artery disease, we performed a MEDLINE search to identify all English-language
      articles on use of COX-2 inhibitors published between 1998 and February 2001. We 
      also reviewed relevant submissions to the US Food and Drug Administration by
      pharmaceutical companies. Our search yielded 2 major randomized trials, the Vioxx
      Gastrointestinal Outcomes Research Study (VIGOR; 8076 patients) and the Celecoxib
      Long-term Arthritis Safety Study (CLASS; 8059 patients), as well as 2 smaller
      trials with approximately 1000 patients each. The results from VIGOR showed that 
      the relative risk of developing a confirmed adjudicated thrombotic cardiovascular
      event (myocardial infarction, unstable angina, cardiac thrombus, resuscitated
      cardiac arrest, sudden or unexplained death, ischemic stroke, and transient
      ischemic attacks) with rofecoxib treatment compared with naproxen was 2.38 (95%
      confidence interval, 1.39-4.00; P =.002). There was no significant difference in 
      cardiovascular event (myocardial infarction, stroke, and death) rates between
      celecoxib and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents in CLASS. The annualized
      myocardial infarction rates for COX-2 inhibitors in both VIGOR and CLASS were
      significantly higher than that in the placebo group of a recent meta-analysis of 
      23 407 patients in primary prevention trials (0.52%): 0.74% with rofecoxib (P
      =.04 compared with the placebo group of the meta-analysis) and 0.80% with
      celecoxib (P =.02 compared with the placebo group of the meta-analysis). The
      available data raise a cautionary flag about the risk of cardiovascular events
      with COX-2 inhibitors. Further prospective trial evaluation may characterize and 
      determine the magnitude of the risk.

TI  - Economic evaluation of rofecoxib versus nonselective nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of osteoarthritis.
PG  - 1061-79
AB  - BACKGROUND: Results of phase III clinical trials of rofecoxib, a selective
      inhibitor of cyclooxygenase 2, have shown that osteoarthritis patients treated
      with rofecoxib had significantly fewer clinically significant gastrointestinal
      (GI) adverse events than those who received nonselective nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). OBJECTIVE: This paper explores the potential
      economic implications of the use of rofecoxib versus nonselective NSAIDs for the 
      treatment of osteoarthritis via a decision analytic model based on rofecoxib
      clinical data and the published literature. METHODS: Base-case 1-year analyses
      were done with data on GI adverse events, specifically perforations, ulcers, and 
      bleeds (PUBs), obtained from a prespecified pooled analysis of the rofecoxib
      clinical trials. Analyses were also performed using pooled results of two 12-week
      endoscopic surveillance trials, with adjustments for silent ulcers of 40% and
      85%. RESULTS: Under base-case conditions, the expected cost savings in GI
      problems and comedications averted with rofecoxib versus NSAIDs was 0.81 dollars 
      per day, representing an 85% offset of the difference in drug price. For
      rofecoxib versus NSAIDs, the expected cost per PUB avoided with rofecoxib was
      4738 dollars, and expected cost per year of life saved was 18,614 dollars. In
      analyses based on endoscopic data, therapy with rofecoxib was less expensive than
      therapy with NSAIDs, regardless of silent ulcer adjustment. Results were most
      sensitive to prophylactic GI comedication rates, and were robust over a range of 
      model assumptions and costs. CONCLUSIONS: In this analysis based on differences
      in clinically significant GI events for osteoarthritis patients, cost differences
      between rofecoxib and NSAIDs were markedly offset by expected cost savings in GI 
      problems and comedications averted with rofecoxib. Costs per year of life saved
      with rofecoxib versus NSAIDs were well within accepted benchmarks for
      cost-effectiveness. When endoscopic data alone were considered, rofecoxib was
      cost saving across all assumptions about silent ulcer rates.

TI  - Effect of rofecoxib therapy on measures of health-related quality of life in
      patients with osteoarthritis.
PG  - 609-16
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bodily pain and physical disability can negatively impact
      health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients with osteoarthritis (OA).
      OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of treatment with a new agent, rofecoxib, on
      HRQL in patients with OA. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, 6-week clinical
      trial comparing treatment with rofecoxib, 5 to 50 mg, with placebo in 672
      patients with OA of the hip or knee. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Patient HRQL was
      assessed at baseline and at the end of treatment using the Medical Outcomes Study
      36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). RESULTS: At 6 weeks, mean change from
      baseline in all SF-36 mental and physical health domain scores demonstrated
      significant improvement with rofecoxib use (P < .05 for all doses for all SF-36
      domains), with evidence of a dose-response relation. Improvements in mental and
      physical HRQL domains with rofecoxib treatment were significantly greater than
      those with placebo treatment (P < .05 for each dose of rofecoxib vs placebo for
      all domains except general health) and highly correlated with improvements
      observed using disease-specific OA outcome measures such as the Western Ontario
      and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index-visual Analog 3.0 OA index pain
      and physical function subscales. The effect of rofecoxib vs placebo treatment on 
      mental health largely disappeared after adjustment for improvement in OA
      disease-specific measures. CONCLUSIONS: Rofecoxib treatment increased physical
      and mental HRQL domain scores on the SF-36. Improvements in mental health with
      rofecoxib use primarily resulted from effective treatment of OA (i.e., reduction 
      in pain and improvement in physical function).

TI  - Renal safety and tolerability of celecoxib, a novel cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor.
PG  - 159-75
AB  - The novel cyclooxygenase- (COX)-2 inhibitor celecoxib is an effective treatment
      for the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.
      Conventional treatment for these debilitating conditions routinely involves the
      use of conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are
      nonspecific inhibitors of COX-1 and COX-2. Numerous studies suggest that
      inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by NSAIDs is deleterious to kidney
      function, particularly in high-risk patients. As celecoxib inhibits COX-2 and
      spares COX-1 at therapeutic doses, we hypothesized that it may offer an improved 
      renal safety profile in patients at risk for NSAID-induced renal toxicity. This
      article represents a post hoc analysis of the renal safety of celecoxib, using
      the safety database generated during its clinical development program. This
      analysis includes data from more than 50 clinical studies involving more than
      13,000 subjects. Most subjects were enrolled in randomized, controlled trials (of
      up to 12 weeks' duration); however, more than 5000 subjects received celecoxib
      for as long as 2 years in a long-term, open-label study at as much as twice the
      maximum recommended dosage. The overall incidence of renal adverse events after
      celecoxib was greater than that after placebo but similar to that after NSAIDs.
      The most common events reported after celecoxib, namely, peripheral edema (2.1%),
      hypertension (0.8%), and exacerbation of preexisting hypertension (0.6%), were
      not time- or dose-related. Peripheral edema was not associated with increased
      weight or blood pressure. Furthermore, there was no evidence of drug-drug
      interactions between celecoxib and concomitant angiotensin-converting enzyme
      (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or diuretics. We
      conclude that celecoxib is well tolerated by patients who may be at risk for
      NSAID-induced renal toxicity, such as the elderly and those with hypertension or 
      preexisting chronic heart disease.

TI  - Comparison of once-daily and twice-daily administration of celecoxib for the
      treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee.
PG  - 213-27
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability
      of a celecoxib 200 mg QD regimen with a 100 mg BID regimen in patients with
      osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. METHODS: Patients enrolled in this prospective, 
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study were randomly
      assigned to receive celecoxib 100 mg BID, celecoxib 200 mg QD, or placebo for 6
      weeks. Assessments of OA severity (Patient's and Physician's Global Assessments
      of Arthritis, Patient's Assessment of Arthritis Pain-Visual Analog Scale,
      Lequesne Osteoarthritis Severity Index, and the Western Ontario and McMaster
      Universities Osteoarthritis Index) were performed at baseline and at week 2
      and/or 6. Patients who discontinued treatment underwent assessments at the time
      of withdrawal from the study. RESULTS: Of the 718 patients enrolled, 243 received
      celecoxib 100 mg BID, 231 received celecoxib 200 mg QD, and 244 received placebo.
      For all measures of efficacy, at all assessments, improvements from baseline in
      both celecoxib groups were superior to that seen in the placebo group (P < 0.05).
      No significant differences in efficacy between the celecoxib groups were
      observed. The overall incidence of adverse events was similar in the 2 celecoxib 
      treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Dosing regimens of celecoxib 200 mg QD and 100 mg 
      BID are equally effective and well tolerated in patients with OA of the knee. The
      availability of 2 effective regimens provides patients and physicians with
      increased flexibility in the selection of an appropriate dosing regimen for
      celecoxib therapy.

TI  - The Swedish ACCES model: predicting the health economic impact of celecoxib in
      patients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis.
PG  - 51-6
AB  - The Arthritis Cost Consequence Evaluation System (ACCES) pharmacoeconomic model
      was used to evaluate the economic and health impact of the recent introduction of
      celecoxib for treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in
      Sweden. The model demonstrates that use of celecoxib can be expected to reduce
      the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events, resource utilization and
      treatment costs. In a cost-effectiveness analysis, celecoxib demonstrated
      economic dominance (i.e. improved health at reduced cost) compared with the
      currently available alternatives for OA, and demonstrated economic dominance
      against a clinically relevant base-case scenario for RA. In sensitivity analyses,
      the results were shown to be relatively robust; celecoxib demonstrated economic
      dominance or favourable cost-effectiveness ratios in all analyses. Based on these
      data, it can be concluded that the use of celecoxib in Sweden will provide
      societal benefits by improving health care at reduced cost for patients with OA
      and RA.

TI  - Overview of the arthritis Cost Consequence Evaluation System (ACCES): a
      pharmacoeconomic model for celecoxib.
PG  - 33-42; discussion 57-9
AB  - Pharmacoeconomic analyses have become useful and essential tools for health care 
      decision makers who increasingly require such analyses prior to placing a drug on
      a national, regional or hospital formulary. Previous health economic models of
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been restricted to evaluating
      a narrow range of agents within specific health care delivery systems using
      medical information derived from homogeneous clinical trial data. This paper
      summarizes the Arthritis Cost Consequence Evaluation System (ACCES)--a
      pharmacoeconomic model that has been developed to predict and evaluate the costs 
      and consequences associated with the use of celecoxib in patients with arthritis,
      compared with other NSAIDs and NSAIDs plus gastroprotective agents. The advantage
      of this model is that it can be customized to reflect local practice patterns,
      resource utilization and costs, as well as provide context-specific health
      economic information to a variety of providers and/or decision makers.

PG  - 21-8; discussion 57-9
AB  - Celecoxib is the first COX-2-specific inhibitor approved for relief of the signs 
      and symptoms of osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), as well as for
      treatment of familial adenomatous polyposis. For both OA and RA, celecoxib has
      been shown to be significantly superior in efficacy to placebo and similar in
      efficacy to traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Its advantage,
      however, is its gastrointestinal (GI) safety. Randomized clinical trials as well 
      as long-term outcomes studies have demonstrated that the GI safety profile of
      celecoxib is superior to that of traditional NSAIDs and similar to that of
      placebo. Additionally, the renal and cardiovascular safety of celecoxib has also 
      become apparent, as well as its efficacy, tolerability and safety in the elderly 
      population.

PG  - 13-20; discussion 57-9
AB  - Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely prescribed and used,
      especially to treat patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Since 
      their introduction as a therapeutic class, a large body of literature has
      accumulated on the side-effects of these drugs. NSAIDs, through their inhibition 
      of prostaglandin synthesis, can affect the renal and cardiovascular systems.
      However, the majority of reported side-effects are related to the
      gastrointestinal (GI) system, and the occurrence of these GI events adds
      significantly to the disease burden. Several factors have been identified that
      contribute to the risk of an NSAID-associated GI event. However, when considering
      risk, especially in clinical trials or observational studies, it is necessary to 
      distinguish between baseline risk and NSAID-attributable risk, since this
      distinction can affect the results and conclusions of the study;
      NSAID-attributable risk is present in subjects who have few or no risk factors
      for upper GI toxicity. Safer NSAIDs, such as the new specific cyclooxygenase-2
      inhibitors, when targeted to the appropriate patient (i.e. those with
      NSAID-attributable risk), should lead to improved outcomes and reduced costs.

TI  - Selective inhibition of COX-2 in humans is associated with less gastrointestinal 
      injury: a comparison of nimesulide and naproxen.
PG  - 339-46
AB  - BACKGROUND: Selective inhibitors of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 may provoke less
      gastric damage and platelet inhibition than conventional non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs. AIMS: We compared the biochemical and gastrointestinal
      effects of nimesulide, a potent and selective COX-2 inhibitor, with naproxen
      which exhibits no selectivity. SUBJECTS: Thirty six healthy volunteers were
      randomised to nimesulide 100 mg or naproxen 500 mg twice daily for two weeks in a
      double blind, crossover study with a washout between treatments. METHODS:
      Gastrointestinal side effects were assessed by endoscopy, and by estimation of
      small intestinal absorption-permeability and inflammation. Comparisons were made 
      between variables at the end of each treatment phase. RESULTS: Nimesulide caused 
      significantly less gastric injury using the modified Lanza score (p<0.001) as
      well as reduced duodenum injury (p=0.039). Nimesulide had lower visual analogue
      scores (VAS) for haemorrhage and erosive lesions in the stomach (p<0.001) and for
      mucosal injection in the duodenum (p=0.039). Naproxen increased excretion of
      calprotectin, a marker of intestinal inflammation (5.5 (1.2) to 12.1 (2.1) mg/l) 
      while nimesulide had no effect (treatment difference p=0.03). Naproxen abolished 
      platelet aggregation to arachidonic acid and suppressed serum thromboxane B(2)
      (TXB(2)) by 98%, indices of COX-1 activity. In contrast, nimesulide had no
      significant effect on platelet aggregation, although it reduced serum TXB(2) by
      29%. Production of prostaglandin E(2) and prostacyclin by gastric biopsies, also 
      COX-1 dependent, was inhibited by naproxen, but not by nimesulide. COX-2
      activity, determined as endotoxin induced prostaglandin E(2) formation in plasma,
      was markedly suppressed by both treatments. INTERPRETATION: Nimesulide has
      preferential selectivity for COX-2 over COX-1 in vivo at full therapeutic doses
      and induces less gastrointestinal damage than that seen with naproxen in the
      short term.

TI  - Minimal perceptible clinical improvement with the Western Ontario and McMaster
      Universities osteoarthritis index questionnaire and global assessments in
      patients with osteoarthritis.
PG  - 2635-41
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the minimal perceptible clinical improvement (MPCI) in
      patients with osteoarthritis (OA) with the Western Ontario and McMaster
      Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) questionnaire, and patient and
      investigator global assessment of disease status in randomized clinical trials
      for treatment of OA. METHODS: Subjects with OA of the knee or hip were randomized
      to receive either rofecoxib 12.5 or 25 mg once daily, ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times
      daily, or placebo for 6 weeks. The WOMAC and global assessments were completed at
      baseline and Weeks 2, 4, and 6. A patient global assessment of response to
      therapy (0 to 4 scale) was used to "anchor" the WOMAC scores. MPCI was defined as
      the difference in mean change from baseline in WOMAC (100 mm normalized visual
      analog scale, VAS) between patients with 0 = "None" global response to therapy
      and patients with 1 = "Poor" global response to therapy. RESULTS: MPCI was
      determined to be 9.7, 9.3, and 10.0 mm for the WOMAC pain, physical function and 
      stiffness subscales, respectively, and 11.1 mm for WOMAC question 1: Pain walking
      on a flat surface. The MPCI for the investigator was 0.4 with investigator
      assessment of disease status reported on a 0 to 4 Likert scale. Of note, the
      estimated MPCI for the WOMAC and investigator globals were similar irrespective
      of treatment, sex, age, or geographic region. CONCLUSION: In this analysis, mean 
      changes of roughly 9 to 12 mm (100 mm normalized VAS) on WOMAC scales were
      perceptible changes to patients with hip and knee OA. A mean decrease of 0.4 in
      global disease status (0 to 4 Likert scale) as assessed by the investigator
      corresponded to the patients' MPCI. Understanding the minimal perceptible
      differences may permit a better assessment of the clinical relevance of
      therapeutic interventions in OA.

TI  - Gastrointestinal tolerability of the selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor
      rofecoxib compared with nonselective COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitors in
      osteoarthritis.
PG  - 2998-3003
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are nonselective
      cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) inhibitors and are associated with a variety of 
      upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract symptoms. The roles of COX-1 and COX-2 in the
      pathogenesis of these symptoms are unclear. To test whether COX-2 inhibition with
      rofecoxib would have greater GI tolerability than nonselective COX-1 and COX-2
      inhibition, we compared the incidences of (1) treatment discontinuations for GI
      adverse events (AEs) and (2) prespecified dyspeptic-type GI AEs among patients
      with osteoarthritis treated with rofecoxib vs NSAIDs. METHODS: A prespecified,
      combined analysis of investigator-reported GI AEs in all 8 double-blind,
      randomized, phase 2b/3 osteoarthritis trials of rofecoxib was conducted. Patients
      included men and women with osteoarthritis (N = 5435); there was no upper age
      limit for entry. Treatments tested included rofecoxib, 12.5, 25, or 50 mg
      (combined), vs ibuprofen, diclofenac, or nabumetone (combined). Primary outcomes 
      were the time (by survival analysis) to (1) treatment discontinuation due to GI
      AEs and (2) first reported dyspeptic-type GI AE. Between-treatment comparisons
      were made by log-rank test. RESULTS: The number of treatment discontinuations
      caused by GI AEs during 12 months was significantly lower (P=.02) with rofecoxib 
      vs NSAIDs (8.2 vs 12.0 per 100 patient-years; relative risk, 0.70; 95% confidence
      interval, 0.52-0.94). The incidence of prespecified dyspeptic-type GI AEs during 
      the first 6 months was significantly lower (P=.02) with rofecoxib vs NSAIDs (69.3
      vs 85.2 per 100 patient-years; relative risk, 0.85; 95% confidence interval,
      0.74-0.97). However, the difference between treatments in dyspeptic-type GI AEs
      was attenuated after 6 months. CONCLUSION: Rofecoxib was associated with a lower 
      incidence of treatment discontinuations due to GI AEs over 12 months and a lower 
      incidence of dyspeptic-type GI AEs over 6 months than treatment with nonselective
      COX inhibitors, or NSAIDs. Arch Intern Med. 2000;160:2998-3003

TI  - Safety and efficacy of meloxicam in the treatment of osteoarthritis: a 12-week,
      double-blind, multiple-dose, placebo-controlled trial. The Meloxicam
      Osteoarthritis Investigators.
PG  - 2947-54
AB  - BACKGROUND: Meloxicam (Mobic; Boehringer Ingelheim, Ridgefield, Conn) is an
      enolic acid derivative of the oxicam group of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs (NSAIDs) whose mechanism of action may be related to prostaglandin
      (cyclooxygenase) synthetase inhibition. In previous studies, meloxicam has been
      found to be safe and effective in the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) at doses
      of 7.5 to 15 mg daily. To evaluate a lower dose and a different patient
      population, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of 3 doses of meloxicam vs
      placebo and diclofenac for the treatment of OA among patients with symptom
      exacerbations. METHODS: In this double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group,
      multicenter study, 774 patients with confirmed OA of the hip or knee and a flare 
      were randomized and treated with daily oral administration of meloxicam tablets
      (at dosages of 3.75, 7.5, or 15 mg/d), diclofenac (100 mg [50 mg twice daily]),
      or placebo. Treatment was for 12 weeks, with regular assessments for drug safety 
      and efficacy. Safety was assessed by evaluation of adverse events, vital signs,
      and laboratory data. Primary efficacy variables included the Western Ontario and 
      McMaster University Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) index, the patient's overall
      assessment of pain, and the patient's and investigator's overall assessment of
      disease activity. RESULTS: The incidence of all adverse events was lower at each 
      dosage of meloxicam than for diclofenac but greater than for placebo. However,
      the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events and dropout rates because of
      such events was the same for meloxicam as for placebo and lower than for
      diclofenac. Meloxicam, at 7.5 and 15 mg/d, and diclofenac were statistically
      significantly more effective than placebo for all end points, while the 3.75-mg/d
      dosage of meloxicam did not always reach statistical significance for all end
      points. Efficacy was evident after 2 weeks of treatment, improved with increasing
      doses, and was maintained until the end of the trial. CONCLUSIONS: Meloxicam is a
      safe and effective medication for the symptomatic treatment of OA. The data
      support consideration of 7.5 to 15 mg of meloxicam once daily to treat the pain
      and stiffness of OA, with gastrointestinal tolerability comparable to that of
      placebo. Arch Intern Med. 2000;160:2947-2954

TI  - Does nimesulide induce gastric mucosal damage? "A double-blind randomized
      placebo-controlled trial".
PG  - 1183-5
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: In this study, it was aimed to examine the effect of nimesulide,
      a selective inhibitor of cox-2 enzyme, to the gastric mucosa and to correlate its
      effect with aspirin. METHODOLOGY: This study was planned as double-blind,
      randomized and placebo-controlled. Mean age of voluntary persons (n = 32) was
      42.3 +/- 2.7. Divided into 3 groups of volunteers were given randomized placebo
      (n = 10), aspirin (n = 10) (500 mg aspirin, Bayer) and nimesulide (n = 12) (100
      mg mesulid, Pfizer) with 50 mL of water after 12 hours fasting period at 08.00
      am. Gastroduodenoscopy was performed to the volunteers 3 hours after each
      therapy. RESULTS: Endoscopic scores of groups were; placebo: 0.20 +/- 0.13,
      aspirin: 2.8 +/- 0.46, nimesulide: 1.41 +/- 0.51. Lesion scores both in the
      aspirin group when compared with nimesulide and placebo groups (P < 0.00002, <
      0.03), and in the nimesulide group when compared with the placebo group (P <
      0.01) were significantly high. The positivity of Helicobacter pylori of groups
      was found; 67% in placebo, 72% in aspirin, 71% in nimesulide and there was no
      statistically significant difference in the groups. CONCLUSIONS: It was shown
      that nimesulide causes significantly serious gastric mucosal lesion when compared
      with placebo. The lesion score of nimesulide was found less than aspirin.
      According to the findings, nimesulide should be given carefully just as other
      analgesics due to the probability of causing gastric lesion.

TI  - Upper gastrointestinal tolerability of celecoxib, a COX-2 specific inhibitor,
      compared to naproxen and placebo.
PG  - 1876-83
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tolerability of
      celecoxib, naproxen, and placebo in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and
      osteoarthritis (OA). METHODS: An analysis of 5, 12-week, randomized, double
      blind, parallel group, placebo controlled clinical trials was conducted. In these
      trials, patients were randomized to: naproxen 500 mg bid (n = 1,099), placebo (n 
      = 1,136), celecoxib 50 mg bid (n = 690) (subtherapeutic dose), celecoxib 100 mg
      (n = 1,131) or 200 mg bid (n = 1,125) (therapeutic dose), or celecoxib 400 mg bid
      (n = 434) (supratherapeutic dosage). The incidence and time until moderate to
      severe abdominal pain, dyspepsia, nausea, and any of the aforementioned 3 upper
      GI symptoms (composite endpoint) were determined using time-to-event analysis.
      RESULTS: The cumulative incidences of moderate to severe abdominal pain,
      dyspepsia, or nausea (composite endpoint) were: naproxen 500 mg (12.0%; 95% CI
      9.9%-14.0%), celecoxib 50 mg bid (7.1%; 95% CI 5.0%-9.2%), celecoxib 100 mg bid
      (7.8%; 95% CI 6.0%-9.5%), celecoxib 200 mg bid (8.1%; 95% CI 6.4%-9.9%),
      celecoxib 400 mg bid (6.0%; 95% CI 3.6%-8.4%), and placebo (8.5%; 95% CI
      6.5%-10.8%). After controlling for independent predictors of the composite
      endpoint, relative risks (RR) for the various treatments relative to naproxen 500
      mg bid were: celecoxib 50 mg (RR 0.54; 95% CI 0.37-0.77; p < 0.001), celecoxib
      100 mg (RR 0.60; 95% CI 0.45-0.80; p < 0.001), celecoxib 200 mg bid (RR 0.63; 95%
      CI 0.47-0.83; p = 0.001), celecoxib 400 mg bid (RR 0.56; 95% CI 0.35-0.89; p =
      0.015), and placebo (RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.47-0.85; p = 0.002). After controlling for
      independent predictors of the composite endpoint, celecoxib treatment group
      patients did not differ from placebo patients when reporting the composite
      endpoint, with p values ranging from 0.40 to 0.96. CONCLUSION: The upper GI
      tolerability of celecoxib is superior to naproxen. A dose-response relationship
      between celecoxib and upper GI symptoms was not apparent.

TI  - Reduced risk of upper gastrointestinal ulcer complications with celecoxib, a
      novel COX-2 inhibitor.
PG  - 1681-90
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the rate of upper gastrointestinal
      (UGI) ulcer complications (bleeding, perforation, or gastric outlet obstruction) 
      associated with celecoxib, a specific COX-2 inhibitor, compared with the rate
      associated with nonspecific, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
      METHODS: A pooled analysis was conducted of 14 multicenter, double-blind,
      randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) and a separate analysis of one long-term
      open label trial that assessed the efficacy and safety of celecoxib for
      symptomatic treatment of arthritis. The RCTs enrolled 11,008 patients with
      osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis treated for 2-24 wk; the long-term open
      label trial enrolled 5,155 patients receiving celecoxib for a maximum of 2 yr. In
      the RCTs, patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n = 1,864; 208
      patient-years), celecoxib 25-400 mg b.i.d. (n = 6,376; 1,020 patient-years), or a
      comparator NSAID (n = 2,768; 535 patient-years); NSAIDs were naproxen 500 mg
      b.i.d., diclofenac 50 or 75 mg b.i.d., or ibuprofen 800 mg t.i.d.). In the
      long-term, open-label trial, patients received celecoxib 100-400 mg b.i.d. for up
      to 2 yr (n = 5,155; 5,002 patient-years). The principal outcome measure of this
      analysis was development of a UGI ulcer complication, which was prospectively
      defined as bleeding, perforation, or gastric outlet obstruction. Ulcer
      complications were assessed and adjudicated by persons blinded to the patient's
      treatment assignment or the study in which the patient participated. RESULTS: In 
      the RCTs, UGI ulcer complications occurred in no placebo patients (0 of 1,864
      patients), in 2 of 6,376 celecoxib patients (0.03%), and in 9 of 2,768 patients
      receiving an NSAID (0.33%), corresponding to annual incidences of 0.20% for
      celecoxib (p > 0.05 vs placebo) and 1.68% for NSAIDs (p = 0.002 vs celecoxib and 
      placebo). In the long-term open-label trial, nine UGI ulcer complications
      occurred, for an incidence of 0.17% and an annualized incidence of 0.18%.
      CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of UGI ulcer complications associated with celecoxib
      was 8-fold lower than with nonspecific NSAIDs. The incidence of ulcer
      complications observed in celecoxib-treated patients was similar to that in
      patients receiving placebo in the RCTs, and to that in non-NSAID users reported
      in the literature.

TI  - Determining minimally important changes in generic and disease-specific
      health-related quality of life questionnaires in clinical trials of rheumatoid
      arthritis.
PG  - 1478-87
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To define clinically meaningful changes in 2 widely used
      health-related quality of life (HQL) instruments in studies of patients with
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Patients with RA (n = 693) who were enrolled 
      in 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials completed the Short Form 36
      (SF-36) modified health survey and the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)
      disability index at baseline and 6-week followup assessments. Data on 5 RA
      severity measures were also collected at baseline and at 6 weeks (patient and
      physician global assessments, joint swelling and tenderness counts, and global
      pain assessment). Comparison of changes in the SF-36 scales and HAQ scores was
      made between groups of patients known to differ in the level of change on each RA
      severity measure. RESULTS: With few exceptions, changes in the SF-36 and HAQ
      scores were different between patients who differed in the level of change on
      each RA severity measure. Changes in the SF-36 and HAQ scores were more strongly 
      related to changes in the patient and physician global assessments and patient
      pain assessment than to changes in the joint swelling and tenderness counts.
      CONCLUSION: Based on these results, minimally important changes in the SF-36
      scales and HAQ disability scores were determined, which will be useful in
      interpreting HQL results in clinical trials.

TI  - Effect of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition on renal function in elderly persons
      receiving a low-salt diet. A randomized, controlled trial.
PG  - 1-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit both
      cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), whose inhibition is associated with gastrointestinal
      ulceration, and COX-2, whose inhibition is associated with therapeutic benefits. 
      Although agents that do not produce COX-1 activity may have fewer adverse
      effects, targeted disruption of the COX-2 allele in mice has resulted in severe
      renal problems, suggesting that COX-2 inhibition may also produce adverse
      effects. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of rofecoxib, a member of the coxib
      class of drugs and a specific inhibitor of the COX-2 enzyme, on renal function in
      elderly patients. DESIGN: A randomized, three-period, single-dose crossover study
      and a randomized, parallel-group, multiple-dose study. SETTING: Clinical research
      units. PATIENTS: 75 patients 60 to 80 years of age. INTERVENTION: In the first
      study, single doses of rofecoxib, 250 mg (about 5-fold to 20-fold the recommended
      dose); indomethacin, 75 mg; and placebo were administered to 15 patients. In the 
      second study, multiple doses of rofecoxib, 12.5 or 25 mg/d; indomethacin, 50 mg
      three times daily; or placebo were administered to 60 patients. Patients in both 
      studies received a low-sodium diet MEASUREMENTS: Glomerular filtration rate,
      creatinine clearance, and urinary and serum sodium and potassium values. RESULTS:
      Compared with placebo, single doses of rofecoxib and indomethacin decreased the
      glomerular filtration rate by 0.23 m/s (P < 0.001) and 0.18 mL/s (P = 0.003),
      respectively. In contrast, respective decreases of 0.14, 0.13, and 0.10 mL/s were
      observed after multiple doses of rofecoxib, 12.5 mg/d (P = 0.019); rofecoxib, 25 
      mg (P = 0.029), and indomethacin (P = 0.086) were administered. Changes in
      creatinine clearance and serum and urinary sodium and potassium were less
      pronounced. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of COX-2 inhibition on renal function are
      similar to those observed with nonselective NSAIDs. Thus, COX-2 seems to play an 
      important role in human renal function.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of meloxicam in an observational, controlled cohort
      study in patients with rheumatic disease.
PG  - 400-10
AB  - BACKGROUND: Meloxicam is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that
      inhibits cyclooxygenase-2 without affecting platelet aggregation. OBJECTIVE: The 
      goal of this study was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of meloxicam under
      natural prescribing conditions for up to 6 months. METHODS: This was a
      multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study. Participating centers were 
      randomized to 1 of 2 groups: the meloxicam-only group, and the group who received
      comparator NSAIDs (ie, diclofenac, ibuprofen, piroxicam, or indomethacin).
      RESULTS: A total of 4526 patients received either meloxicam (n = 2530) or a
      comparator NSAID (n = 1996). Treatment groups were comparable in terms of
      observed efficacy measures. Meloxicam patients had significantly lower rates of
      reported gastrointestinal (GI) adverse drug reactions (1.80% vs 3.20%; P =
      0.003), including dyspepsia (0.08% vs 0.35%; P = 0.049), abdominal pain (0.91% vs
      1.90%; P = 0.006), gastritis (0.08% vs 0.60%; P = 0.002), and GI bleeding (0.08% 
      vs 0.50%; P = 0.007), compared with those receiving comparator NSAIDs.
      CONCLUSION: There was evidence that meloxicam was prescribed preferentially to
      patients who had not responded to NSAIDs previously, who had previously
      experienced NSAID-induced side effects (and so were at high risk for developing
      NSAID-induced GI toxicity), or who were more seriously impaired. The
      nonrandomized and unblinded nature of this study limits the conclusions that can 
      be drawn concerning efficacy or tolerability. Nevertheless, the study results are
      consistent with the favorable GI tolerability seen with meloxicam in double-blind
      comparative trials.

TI  - Immunologic tolerability profile of celecoxib.
PG  - 2065-79
AB  - Celecoxib is primarily an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (COX) 2 and, at therapeutic
      concentrations in humans, does not inhibit the COX-1 isoenzyme. The present
      meta-analyses explore the incidence of allergic reactions with celecoxib in
      patients in the North American and international arthritis trials, in patients
      with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to sulfonamides, and in patients
      receiving medications containing sulfonamides. Data were obtained from 11,008
      patients in 14 double-masked trials of celecoxib in arthritis ranging from 4 to
      24 weeks in duration. Results demonstrate that the incidence of allergic
      reactions with celecoxib was not statistically different from that seen with
      placebo or active comparators (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs])
      when data from the entire cohort were analyzed. The subset of patients with a
      history of sulfonamide hypersensitivity reactions had a 3-fold to 6-fold higher
      incidence of dermatologic reactions than did the entire arthritis trial cohort.
      Although dermatologic reactions occurred with greater frequency in patients with 
      a history of sulfonamide hypersensitivity, the trend was consistent across all 3 
      treatment groups (celecoxib, NSAIDs, and placebo). According to these data and
      structural and metabolic differences between sulfonamides, the potential for
      cross-allergenicity between celecoxib and other sulfonamide-containing
      medications appears comparable to that of placebo and nonsulfonamide-containing
      NSAIDs. Additionally, the risk of allergic reactions with celecoxib appears
      comparable to that of placebo and comparator NSAIDs. Prospective trials are
      needed to confirm these findings.

TI  - Adverse upper gastrointestinal effects of rofecoxib compared with NSAIDs.
PG  - 1929-33
AB  - CONTEXT: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced gastrointestinal
      (GI) toxic effects, such as upper GI tract perforations, symptomatic
      gastroduodenal ulcers, and upper GI tract bleeding (PUBs), are thought to be
      attributable to cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) inhibition. Rofecoxib specifically
      inhibits COX-2 and has demonstrated a low potential for causing upper GI injury. 
      OBJECTIVE: To compare the incidence of PUBs in patients with osteoarthritis
      treated with rofecoxib vs NSAIDs. DESIGN: Prespecified analysis of all 8
      double-blind, randomized phase 2b/3 rofecoxib osteoarthritis trials conducted
      from December 1996 through March 1998, including one 6-week dose-ranging study,
      two 6-week efficacy studies vs ibuprofen and placebo, two 1-year efficacy studies
      vs diclofenac, two 6-month endoscopy studies vs ibuprofen and placebo, and one
      6-week efficacy study vs nabumetone and placebo. SETTING: Multinational sites.
      Participants Osteoarthritis patients (N = 5435; mean age, 63 years [range, 38-94 
      years]; 72.9% women). INTERVENTIONS: Rofecoxib, 12.5, 25, or 50 mg/d (n = 1209,
      1603, and 545, respectively, combined) vs ibuprofen, 800 mg 3 times per day (n = 
      847), diclofenac, 50 mg 3 times per day (n = 590); or nabumetone, 1500 mg/d (n = 
      127) (combined). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Cumulative incidence of PUBs for rofecoxib
      vs NSAIDs, based on survival analysis of time to first PUB diagnosis, using PUBs 
      that met pre-specified criteria judged by a blinded, external adjudication
      committee. RESULTS: The incidence of PUBs over 12 months was significantly lower 
      with rofecoxib vs NSAIDs (12-month cumulative incidence, 1.3% vs 1.8%; P = .046; 
      rate per 100 patient-years, 1.33 vs 2.60; relative risk, 0.51; 95% confidence
      interval, 0.26-1.00). The cumulative incidence of dyspeptic GI adverse
      experiences was also lower with rofecoxib vs NSAIDS over 6 months (23.5% vs
      25.5%; P = .02), after which the incidence rates converged. CONCLUSION: In a
      combined analysis of 8 trials of patients with osteoarthritis, treatment with
      rofecoxib was associated with a significantly lower incidence of PUBs than
      treatment with NSAIDs.

      Group.
PG  - 1688-702
AB  - Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. (NSAIDs) inhibit both cyclooxygenase
      (COX)-1 and COX-2 isoenzymes and are effective in the treatment of inflammatory
      disorders. This 8-week, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial was undertaken to
      assess the safety profile, tolerability, and effective dose range of once-daily
      rofecoxib, a COX-2-specific inhibitor, in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis
      (RA). After a 3- to 15-day washout of prior NSAID therapy, 658 patients were
      randomly allocated to receive placebo or rofecoxib 5 mg, 25 mg, or 50 mg once
      daily. Safety profile, tolerability, and efficacy were evaluated after 2, 4, and 
      8 weeks of therapy. Six hundred fifty-eight patients (168, 158, 171, and 161 in
      the placebo and 5-mg, 25-mg, and 50-mg rofecoxib groups, respectively) were
      enrolled at 79 clinical centers in the United States. Mean age was 55 years, mean
      duration of RA was 10 years, and 506 (77%) of the 658 patients were female. All
      groups had similar baseline demographic characteristics. Patients taking
      rofecoxib 25 and 50 mg showed significant clinical improvement compared with
      those taking placebo; 43.9% in the rofecoxib 25-mg group and 49.7% in the
      rofecoxib 50-mg group completed the treatment period and achieved an American
      College of Rheumatology 20 response (P = 0.025 and 0.001 vs. placebo,
      respectively). The 5-mg dose of rofecoxib did not differ significantly from
      placebo. Patients in the rofecoxib 25- and 50-mg groups showed significant
      improvement in key individual efficacy measurements, including patient global
      assessment of pain, patient and investigator global assessment of disease
      activity, and Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (P<0.05
      vs placebo). Compared with placebo, significantly fewer patients in the 25-mg and
      50-mg rofecoxib groups discontinued therapy because of lack of efficacy (P = 0.02
      and P = 0.032, respectively). Our results show that rofecoxib 25 and 50 mg once
      daily was effective and generally well-tolerated in patients with RA.

TI  - Effect of specific COX-2 inhibition in osteoarthritis of the knee: a 6 week
      double blind, placebo controlled pilot study of rofecoxib. Rofecoxib
      Osteoarthritis Pilot Study Group.
PG  - 2438-47
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and safety of the cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2)
      specific inhibitor, rofecoxib in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee.
      METHODS: Rofecoxib, 25 mg or 125 mg once daily, was compared with placebo in a 6 
      week, double blind, parallel group, randomized, multicenter study of 219 patients
      with knee OA. RESULTS: Both doses of rofecoxib produced clinically significant
      improvement as assessed by primary (e.g., WOMAC Pain Subscale 0-100 mm, decrease 
      from baseline: placebo: 7.1 mm; rofecoxib 25 mg: 28.1 mm, rofecoxib 125 mg: 28.0 
      mm; p < 0.001 rofecoxib vs placebo) and secondary efficacy (p < 0.05) criteria
      compared with placebo. Clinical improvement with the 25 mg dose was similar to
      that with the 125 mg dose. Both rofecoxib doses were generally well tolerated.
      CONCLUSION: Specific inhibition of COX-2 by 25 and 125 mg rofecoxib, administered
      once daily, resulted in clinically meaningful improvements in patients with OA.
      This study confirms that COX-2 derived prostanoids are important clinical
      mediators of pain and other symptoms of knee OA and that inhibition of COX-1 is
      not required to provide clinical benefit.

TI  - Comparative efficacy and safety of nimesulide and diclofenac in patients with
      acute shoulder, and a meta-analysis of controlled studies with nimesulide.
PG  - 33-8
AB  - Adverse events, particularly gastrointestinal, partially offset the therapeutic
      value of NSAIDs. The abilities of nimesulide to inhibit COX-2 preferentially and 
      to exert other novel anti-inflammatory actions are consistent with good efficacy 
      and safety. This is borne out by a double-blind multicentre comparison of
      nimesulide and diclofenac in 122 patients with acute shoulder, and by a
      meta-analysis of various nimesulide trials. At the end of the 14 day double-blind
      study, nimesulide was at least as effective as diclofenac (investigator ratings: 
      good/very good in 79.0% of patients given nimesulide, and 78.0% with diclofenac; 
      patient ratings: good/very good in 82.3 and 78.0% respectively). Four patients
      (6.5%) dropped out in the nimesulide group (two early recovery, one lack of
      effect, one adverse event), compared with 13 (21.7%) in the diclofenac group, due
      mainly to adverse events (P=0.003). Global tolerability was judged by the
      investigators to be good/very good in 96.8% of the nimesulide group compared with
      72.9% of those given diclofenac. Judgements by the patients were 96.8 and 78.0%
      respectively. Both differences are highly significant statistically. The
      meta-analysis demonstrates that nimesulide given for 2 weeks is far more
      efficacious than placebo in treating osteoarthritis, and is at least comparable
      to other NSAIDs The benefit-risk ratio for nimesulide was better in all
      individual studies since 100 mg nimesulide twice daily was about equal to placebo
      in safety and tolerability, especially regarding gastrointestinal adverse events.

TI  - The safety profile of nonprescription ibuprofen in multiple-dose use: a
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 520-32
AB  - A meta-analysis was performed to compare the incidence of adverse experiences
      (AEs) during the multiple-dose use of nonprescription ibuprofen to a placebo.
      Eight studies, with doses ranging from 800 to 1200 mg/day and durations of 1 to
      10 days, met the criteria for inclusion. AEs were classified according to
      COSTART, except that "abdominal pain" was conservatively reassigned to the
      digestive system. In each study, the overall AE frequency among ibuprofen-treated
      subjects (n = 1094) was numerically less than or equal to the placebo (n = 1093).
      Pooled across all studies, placebo subjects reported AEs significantly (p =
      0.018) more often (31.7%) than ibuprofen subjects (27.4%). The frequency of
      digestive system AEs was comparable (p = 0.420) for the placebo (11.0%) and
      ibuprofen (12.1%); there was no significant difference for any specific digestive
      system AE. AE frequency in the "body-as-a-whole" category was significantly
      higher (p < 0.001) in the placebo (20.4%) than in ibuprofen (14.8%). The number
      of severe AEs in all of these categories was lower for ibuprofen than for the
      placebo. These data indicate that nonprescription ibuprofen has an excellent side
      effect profile in multiple-dose use, with a frequency of gastrointestinal AEs
      comparable to a placebo.

TI  - Preliminary study of the safety and efficacy of SC-58635, a novel cyclooxygenase 
      2 inhibitor: efficacy and safety in two placebo-controlled trials in
      osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, and studies of gastrointestinal and
      platelet effects.
PG  - 1591-602
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and safety of SC-58635 (celecoxib), an
      antiinflammatory and analgesic agent that acts by selective cyclooxygenase 2
      (COX-2) inhibition and is not expected to cause the typical gastrointestinal
      (GI), renal, and platelet-related side effects associated with inhibition of the 
      COX-1 enzyme. METHODS: Four phase II trials were performed: a 2-week
      osteoarthritis efficacy trial, a 4-week rheumatoid arthritis efficacy trial, a
      1-week endoscopic study of GI mucosal effects, and a 1-week study of effects on
      platelet function. RESULTS: The 2 arthritis trials identified SC-58635 dosage
      levels that were consistently effective in treating the signs and symptoms of
      arthritis and were distinguished from placebo on standard arthritis scales. In
      the upper GI endoscopy study, 19% of subjects receiving naproxen (6 of 32)
      developed gastric ulcers, whereas no ulcers occurred in subjects receiving
      SC-58635 or placebo. The study of platelet effects revealed no meaningful effect 
      of SC-58635 on platelet aggregation or thromboxane B2 levels, whereas aspirin
      caused significant decreases in 2 of 3 platelet aggregation measures and
      thromboxane B2 levels. In all 4 trials, SC-58635 was well tolerated, with a
      safety profile similar to that of placebo. CONCLUSION: SC-58635 achieves
      analgesic and antiinflammatory efficacy in arthritis through selective COX-2
      inhibition, without showing any evidence of 2 of the toxic effects of COX-1
      inhibition associated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs.

TI  - A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of efficacy and tolerance of
      meloxicam treatment in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee.
PG  - 32-7
AB  - Meloxicam is a new non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), with a
      favourable ratio of inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)/cyclooxygenase-1
      (COX-1), giving the drug the potential to produce few gastric adverse effects.
      The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of meloxicam in 
      patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. Five hundred and thirteen patients
      were treated in a double-blind trial comparing once-daily meloxicam 7.5 mg, 15mg,
      30mg, or placebo (140, 134, 102 and 137 patients, respectively). Outcome measures
      included scores on Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) for pain on movement (primary
      endpoint) and pain at rest in the target joint as well as global efficacy.
      Lesquesne's index of severity and paracetamol consumption were also measured.
      Global tolerability and the occurrence of adverse events were monitored. Both
      meloxicam 7.5 mg and 15 mg were significantly more effective than placebo with
      respect to pain on movement (p < 0.01 and p < 0.03, respectively). Both doses of 
      meloxicam compared favourably with placebo with respect to pain of the target
      joint at rest, although only the 15 mg dose achieved statistical significance (p 
      < 0.02). Global efficacy showed a significant difference for both doses of
      meloxicam (p < 0.05 and p < 0.002 for 7.5 mg and 15 mg doses, respectively). Once
      daily meloxicam 7.5 and 15 mg is effective and well tolerated in the short term
      symptomatic treatment of OA of the knee.

TI  - Meloxicam: selective COX-2 inhibition in clinical practice.
PG  - 21-7
AB  - Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) exert their actions by inhibiting
      cyclooxygenase (COX). It has recently been postulated that NSAIDs'
      antiinflammatory efficacy arises from inhibition of the COX-2 isoform of
      cyclooxygenase, whereas inhibition of the COX-1 isoform produces the troublesome 
      and sometimes serious gastric and renal side effects of NSAIDs. A relatively
      selective COX-2 inhibitor, such as meloxicam, may combine antiinflammatory
      efficacy with improved tolerability. In volunteers, indomethacin 75 mg, but not
      meloxicam 7.5 mg, inhibited renal prostaglandin E2 excretion and platelet
      aggregation (COX-1 mediated effects). Double-blind, randomized trials in
      osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis patients have shown equivalent
      antiinflammatory efficacy among meloxicam 7.5 mg or 15 mg and diclofenac 100 mg, 
      naproxen 750 mg, and piroxicam 20 mg. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled
      trial, meloxicam (7.5 or 15 mg) caused less endoscopically detected
      gastrointestinal (GI) damage (Lanza scale) than piroxicam 20 mg. The MELISSA
      study, a double-blind, randomized, 28-day trial in over 9,000 patients showed
      that meloxicam 7.5 mg caused statistically less total GI toxicity, dyspepsia,
      abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and diarrhea than diclofenac 100 mg, despite
      equivalent reductions in pain on movement for each treatment. A global safety
      analysis of clinical trials, representing over 5,600 patients and comprising 170 
      and 1,100 patient-years of exposure for meloxicam 7.5 mg and 15 mg, respectively,
      showed that meloxicam caused less GI toxicity and fewer peptic ulcers and GI
      bleeds than naproxen, diclofenac, or piroxicam. The renal safety profile and
      incidence of liver function abnormalities with meloxicam is equivalent to other
      NSAIDs available for clinical use. In conclusion, relatively selective COX-2
      inhibition exemplified by meloxicam may offer effective symptom relief with an
      improved GI tolerability profile.

PG  - 282-90
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of meloxicam, a new acidic enolic 
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, at doses of 7.5 and 15 mg once daily in
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Meloxicam 15 and 7.5 mg daily
      was administered for 21 days in this double blind, randomized, placebo controlled
      study. 159 patients received meloxicam 7.5 mg, 162 received meloxicam 15 mg, and 
      147 received placebo. RESULTS: Meloxicam 15 mg once daily was significantly
      superior (p < 0.05) to placebo in 3 of the 4 primary endpoints (disease activity 
      assessed by the investigator, disease activity assessed by the patient, and
      reduction of the number of tender/painful joints). No difference was observed
      regarding number of swollen joints. The difference between meloxicam 7.5 mg once 
      daily and placebo reached statistical significance in 2 of the 4 primary
      endpoints, disease activity assessed by the patient and number of tender/painful 
      joints. A statistically significant difference between meloxicam 1.5 mg and 7.5
      mg was not observed for any primary endpoint. The rating of global tolerance by
      investigators and patients at the end of the study was similar in the 3 treatment
      groups, indicating that meloxicam and placebo were generally similarly well
      tolerated. However, there was a slightly higher incidence of gastrointestinal
      (GI) disturbances reported by patients receiving meloxicam 15 mg. GI adverse
      events were reported by 11, 11, and 16% of patients in the placebo, meloxicam 7.5
      mg, and meloxicam 15 mg groups, respectively. None were serious. CONCLUSION:
      Meloxicam in daily doses of 7.5 and 15 mg is effective in treating the signs and 
      symptoms of RA.

TI  - The acute phase and function in early rheumatoid arthritis. C-reactive protein
      levels correlate with functional outcome.
PG  - 9-13
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To discover whether normalization of C-reactive protein (CRP) in
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) results in stabilization of their
      functional state, and whether a measure of disease activity can be used as a
      predictor of functional outcome. To examine the relationship between change of
      CRP and Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) over a 24 mo period to define the
      sensitivity of HAQ to change. METHODS: A prospective study of 109 consecutive
      patients who fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology criteria for RA and
      had elevated CRP before steroid or 2nd line therapy. A full clinical assessment
      including HAQ was performed at presentation and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 mo. On the
      basis of the change in CRP at 6 mo, patients were divided into 3 groups: (1) CRP 
      suppression to normal, (2) 50% reduction in CRP, and (3) less than 50% CRP
      change. RESULTS: The 3 groups were clinically and immunologically similar at
      onset. At 6 mo the median HAQ fell to 5 (lower to upper quartiles 7.5 to 19) in
      Group 1 (CRP normalized, n = 34), 6 (3.75 to 10) in Group 2 (CRP reduced by 50%, 
      n = 30), and 12 (6 to 18) in Group 3 (less than 50% CRP change, n = 44), p <
      0.005 for Groups 1 and 2 versus Group 3. At 12 and 24 mo HAQ remained
      significantly lower in Groups 1 and 2 compared with Group 3. In Group 1, patients
      either maintained a normal CRP (n = 28) or their CRP became elevated (n = 6).
      Only in those patients in whom a re-elevation of the CRP occurred was
      deterioration in HAQ subsequently seen. CONCLUSION: Suppression of elevated CRP
      in patients with active RA is associated with improvement in functional score,
      whereas persistent elevation of CRP is associated with functional deterioration. 
      Once abnormal CRP is suppressed, no functional deterioration is likely to occur
      without re-elevation in CRP. Therefore, elevated CRP provides a convenient short 
      term correlation with functional outcome and can be used as a guide for therapy. 
      A HAQ score is a sensitive indicator of change in early disease.

TI  - A 4-week, double-blind, parallel-group study to compare the gastrointestinal
      effects of meloxicam 7.5 mg, meloxicam 15 mg, piroxicam 20 mg and placebo by
      means of faecal blood loss, endoscopy and symptom evaluation in healthy
      volunteers.
PG  - 61-7
AB  - Meloxicam is a new non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) which
      preferentially inhibits cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) over cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1).
      Gastrointestinal (GI) tolerability of meloxicam 7.5 and 15 mg vs piroxicam 20 mg 
      was evaluated in a 4-week, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled study
      in 51 healthy male volunteers, using a combination of oesphago-gastro-duodenal
      endoscopy, faecal blood loss measurement and symptom evaluation. Analysis of
      covariance found no significant difference in faecal blood loss between the
      groups. However, significantly higher bleeding was found with piroxicam 20 mg
      compared with placebo using a Student's t-test on the weighted means. Endoscopy
      score were significantly higher with piroxicam than with meloxicam 7.5 mg or
      placebo (P < 0.01). A significant difference from baseline was observed in the
      meloxicam 15 mg and piroxicam groups (P < 0.05), but not in the meloxicam 7.5 mg 
      and placebo groups. Six piroxicam-treated volunteers were withdrawn following a
      poor endoscopic score, but no such withdrawals occurred in the meloxicam and
      placebo groups (P < 0.01). Meloxicam 7.5 mg caused less GI damage compared with
      piroxicam 20 when administered to healthy young volunteers for 28 days; a
      possible dose dependency effect in GI tolerability was also suggested for
      meloxicam 7.5 and 15 mg, in relation to endoscopic findings.

AB  - The efficacy and tolerability profiles of nimesulide (a nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drug) were assessed in 3 comparative double-blind clinical
      trials that each recruited 60 patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee.
      The duration of each investigation varied with the comparator agent chosen: 2
      weeks for placebo; 3 weeks for piroxicam; 2 months for ketoprofen. Nimesulide and
      ketoprofen were each administered orally as a 100mg dose twice daily, while
      piroxicam was administered orally as a single daily 20mg dose. In each study the 
      principal efficacy parameters were the improvement in spontaneous pain, assessed 
      using a visual analogue scale, and the degree of functional impairment evaluated 
      using the severity index of Lequesne; the final judgement of efficacy was made by
      the physician. In all studies, nimesulide improved these and other efficacy
      parameters with an activity significantly superior to that of placebo and
      comparable with that of reference drugs.

TI  - A randomized double-blind prospective study evaluating patient tolerance of
      transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy of the prostate using prebiopsy rofecoxib.
PG  - 1054-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the use of a prebiopsy outpatient analgesia using the
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent rofecoxib (Vioxx). Urologists perform
      approximately 500,000 transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsies of the
      prostate per year, commonly without analgesia. Recent reports, however, have
      determined that a significant proportion of patients undergoing TRUS-guided
      biopsies have pain. METHODS: We performed a prospective randomized double-blind
      study of 56 men referred for TRUS biopsy of the prostate. They were randomly
      assigned to receive 50 mg of oral rofecoxib or placebo before TRUS biopsy. After 
      the biopsies, the patients were asked to score the severity of pain by filling
      out a visual analog pain scale. At the end of 1 week, all patients were asked to 
      mail in a questionnaire regarding the morbidity of the prostate biopsy, including
      dysuria, hematuria, urinary retention, postbiopsy fever, and rectal bleeding.
      Analysis was completed to assess whether rofecoxib decreased the patients'
      perception of pain. The postbiopsy morbidity of patients receiving placebo versus
      rofecoxib was compared. RESULTS: Thirty-seven percent of patients receiving
      placebo and 42% of patients receiving rofecoxib had significant pain (5 or
      greater on the visual analog pain scale). The median pain score of patients
      receiving rofecoxib (4.0) versus placebo (4.0) was not significantly different
      statistically (P = 0.3139) using a Wilcoxon rank sum analysis. The incidence of
      postbiopsy morbidity was not different. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm the
      findings of previous studies demonstrating that a significant proportion of
      patients undergoing prostate biopsies have pain. More importantly, we found that 
      prebiopsy rofecoxib did not significantly decrease the patients' severity of
      discomfort. Finally, the morbidity after biopsy was not increased with the use of
      rofecoxib.

TI  - Preincisional treatment to prevent pain after ambulatory hernia surgery.
PG  - 1627-32
AB  - We designed this study as a randomized comparison of postoperative pain after
      inguinal hernia repair in patients treated with triple preincisional analgesic
      therapy versus standard care. Triple therapy consisted of a nonsteroidal
      antiinflammatory, a local anesthetic field block, and an N-methyl-D-aspartate
      inhibitor before incision. The treatment group (n = 17) received rofecoxib, 50 mg
      PO, a field block with 0.25% bupivacaine/0.5% lidocaine, and ketamine 0.2 mg/kg
      IV before incision; controls (n = 17) received a placebo PO before surgery. The
      anesthetic protocol was standardized. Postoperative pain was treated by fentanyl 
      IV and oxycodone 5 mg/acetaminophen 325 mg PO as required for pain. Pain scores
      (0-10) and analgesic were recorded for the first 7 days after surgery. Pain
      scores were 47% lower in the treatment group before discharge (3.1 +/- 0.6 versus
      5.9 +/- 0.6, P = 0.0026) (mean +/- SE) and 18% less in the first 24 h after
      discharge (5.6 +/- 0.4 versus 6.8 +/- 0.5, P = 0.05); oral analgesic use was 34% 
      less in the treatment group (4.6 +/- 0.8 doses versus 7.1 +/- 0.7 doses, P =
      0.02) in the first 24 h after surgery. We conclude that triple preincisional
      therapy diminishes pain and analgesic use after outpatient hernia repair, and
      encourage further evaluation of this technique. IMPLICATIONS: Outpatients
      undergoing inguinal hernia repair under general anesthesia report
      moderate-to-severe pain after surgery. Triple preincisional therapy that included
      rofecoxib, 50 mg PO, ketamine, 0.2 mg/kg IV, and local anesthetic field block
      reduced pain scores and analgesic use in the first 24 h after discharge.

TI  - Comparison of rheumatoid arthritis clinical trial outcome measures: a simulation 
      study.
PG  - 3031-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Isolated studies have suggested that continuous measures of response
      may be better than predefined, dichotomous definitions (e.g., the American
      College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria [ACR20]) for discriminating
      between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatments. Our goal was to determine the
      statistical power of predefined dichotomous outcome measures (termed "a priori"),
      compared with that of continuous measures derived from trial data in which there 
      was no predefined response threshold (termed "data driven"), and to evaluate the 
      sensitivity to change of these measures in the context of different treatments
      and early versus later-stage disease. In order to generalize beyond results from 
      a single trial, we performed simulation studies. METHODS: We obtained summary
      data from trials comparing disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and
      from comparative coxib-placebo trials to test the power of 2 a priori outcomes,
      the ACR20 and improvement of the Disease Activity Score (DDAS), as well as 2
      data-driven outcomes. We studied patients with early RA and those with
      later-stage RA (duration of <4 years and 4-9 years, respectively). We performed
      simulation studies, using the interrelationship of ACR core set measures in the
      trials to generate multiple trial data sets consistent with the original data.
      RESULTS: The data-driven outcomes had greater power than did the a priori
      measures. The DMARD comparison was more powerful in early disease than in
      later-stage disease (the sample sizes needed to achieve 80% power for the most
      powerful test were 64 for early disease versus 100 for later disease), but the
      coxib-versus-placebo comparison was less powerful in early disease than in later 
      disease (the sample sizes needed to achieve 80% power were 200 and 100,
      respectively). When the effects of treatment on core set items were small and/or 
      inconsistent, power was reduced, particularly for a less broadly based outcome
      (e.g., DDAS) compared with the ACR20. CONCLUSION: The simulation studies
      demonstrate that data-driven outcome definitions can provide better sensitivity
      to change than does the ACR20 or DDAS. Using such methods would improve power,
      but at the expense of trial standardization. The studies also show how patient
      population and treatment characteristics affect the power of specific outcome
      measures in RA clinical trials, and provide quantification of those effects.

TI  - Effects of perioperative administration of a selective cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor
      on pain management and recovery of function after knee replacement: a randomized 
      controlled trial.
PG  - 2411-8
AB  - CONTEXT: Controlling postoperative pain after knee replacement while reducing
      opioid-induced adverse effects and improving outcomes remains an important
      challenge. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of combined preoperative and
      postoperative administration of a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase 2 on
      opioid consumption and outcomes after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). DESIGN,
      SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial
      conducted June 2001 through September 2002, enrolling 70 patients aged 40 to 77
      years and undergoing TKA at a university hospital in the United States.
      INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive 50 mg of oral rofecoxib
      at 24 hours and at 1 to 2 hours before TKA, 50 mg daily for 5 days
      postoperatively, and 25 mg daily for another 8 days, or matching placebo at the
      same times. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Postoperative outcomes including postsurgical 
      analgesic consumption and pain scores achieved, nausea and vomiting, joint range 
      of motion, sleep disturbance, patient satisfaction with analgesia, and
      hematologic and coagulation parameters. RESULTS: Total epidural analgesic
      consumption and in-hospital opioid consumption were less in the group receiving
      rofecoxib compared with the group receiving placebo (P<.05). Median pain score
      (visual analog scale [VAS], 0-10) achieved for the knee was lower in the
      rofecoxib group compared with the placebo group during hospital stay (2.2
      [interquartile range [IQR], 1.4-3.2] vs 3.5 [IQR, 2.7-4.3], P<.001) and 1 week
      after discharge (2.6 [IQR, 1.4-3.5] vs 3.7 [IQR, 2.9-4.7], P =.03). There was
      less postoperative vomiting in the rofecoxib group (6%) compared with the placebo
      group (26%) (P =.047), as well as a decrease in sleep disturbance compared with
      the placebo group on the night of surgery (P =.006) and on the first (P =.047)
      and second (P<.001) days postoperatively. Knee flexion was increased in the
      rofecoxib group compared with the placebo group at discharge (active flexion:
      mean [SD], 84.2 degrees [11.1 degrees ] vs 73.2 degrees [13.6 degrees ], P =.03; 
      passive flexion: 90.5 degrees [6.8 degrees ] vs 81.8 degrees [13.4 degrees ], P
      =.05) and at 1 month postoperatively (109.3 degrees [8.5 degrees ] vs 100.8
      degrees [11.8 degrees ], P =.01), with shorter time in physical therapy to
      achieve effective joint range of motion. The rofecoxib group was more satisfied
      with analgesia and anesthesia at discharge compared with the placebo group
      (median satisfaction score, 4.3 [IQR, 3.0-4.7] vs 3.3 [IQR, 2.3-4.3],
      respectively; P =.03), and the differences persisted at 2-week and at 1-month
      follow-up. There was no intergroup difference in surgical blood loss (P>.05 for
      both intraoperative and postoperative blood loss). CONCLUSION: Perioperative use 
      of an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase 2 is an effective component of multimodal
      analgesia that reduces opioid consumption, pain, vomiting, and sleep disturbance,
      with improved knee range of motion after TKA.

      Study and the Vioxx Gastrointestinal Outcomes Research Trial tell us?
PG  - 769-88
AB  - Current evidence suggests that PPIs might be effective in maintaining patients in
      remission during continued NSAID use and that the combination of omeprazole plus 
      diclofenac is as effective as treatment with celecoxib in preventing recurrent
      bleeding. Larger outcome studies comparing the combination of a PPI with other
      nonselective NSAIDs and a selective COX-2 inhibitor (and the combination of a
      selective COX-2 inhibitor with a PPI or misoprostol) are required to determine
      whether or not any regimen will further decrease or eliminate the risk of ulcer
      complications in high-risk individuals.

TI  - Low-dose methadone has an analgesic effect in neuropathic pain: a double-blind
      randomized controlled crossover trial.
PG  - 576-87
AB  - The analgesic effectiveness and adverse effect incidence of a daily dose of 10 or
      20 mg of oral methadone were evaluated in 18 patients with a diverse range of
      chronic neuropathic pain syndromes, who had all responded poorly to traditional
      analgesic regimens. Analgesia was seen after each dose of methadone. As compared 
      with placebo, the 20 mg daily dose (given as 10 mg bd) resulted in statistically 
      significant (P = 0.013-0.020) improvements in patient Visual Analogue Scale
      ratings of maximum pain intensity, average pain intensity and pain relief,
      recorded at the same time daily. The analgesic effects extended over 48 hours, as
      shown by statistically significant (P = 0.013-0.020) improvements in all three
      outcomes on the rest days instituted between each daily dose. Analgesic effects
      (lowered maximum pain intensity and increased pain relief, on the day of dosing
      only) were also seen when the lower daily dose of 10 mg methadone (given as 5 mg 
      bd) was used, but these failed to reach statistical significance (P = 0.064 and
      0.065, respectively). Interpatient analysis showed that the analgesic effects
      were not restricted to any particular type of neuropathic pain. Patient
      compliance was high throughout the trial. One patient withdrew during the 10 mg
      and six during the 20 mg methadone treatment periods. This is the first
      double-blind randomized controlled trial to demonstrate that methadone has an
      analgesic effect in neuropathic pain.

TI  - Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors: are they really atherothrombotic, and if not, why
      not?
PG  - 2736-40
AB  - BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY: Selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors are
      increasingly being used in place of "conventional" nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs (NSAIDs). This is because they are just as effective as NSAIDs in relieving
      arthritic pain and yet less gastrotoxic. However, the cardiovascular safety of
      selective COX-2 inhibitors has been questioned because they selectively reduce
      prostacyclin production, thus disrupting the normal homeostatic balance and
      promoting a prothrombotic state. These theoretical concerns appear to be
      supported by the results of clinical trials demonstrating an increased risk of
      myocardial infarction with COX-2 inhibitors compared with a conventional NSAID,
      and indirect comparisons of the rates of myocardial infarction among patients
      treated with a selective COX-2 inhibitor compared with aspirin in different
      trials. However, emerging data from animal, experimental and clinical studies
      suggest that COX-2 is atherogenic and thrombogenic, and that selective COX-2
      inhibitors may be cardioprotective. Meta-analyses of randomized trials of
      selective COX-2 inhibitors compared with placebo have demonstrated no excess of
      cardiovascular events among patients allocated COX-2 inhibitors, and preliminary 
      data from a randomized controlled trial of the selective COX-2 inhibitor
      meloxicam, in patients with acute coronary syndrome who were treated with
      aspirin, demonstrated a reduction in cardiovascular events among patients
      allocated the COX-2 inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS: Continuing uncertainty regarding the 
      direction and magnitude of any cardiovascular effects of selective COX-2
      inhibitors, coupled with their widespread and increasing use, mandates
      prospective randomized evaluation of their efficacy and safety in patients at
      increased risk of future cardiovascular events.

TI  - Cyclooxygenases in the skin: pharmacological and toxicological implications.
PG  - 294-306
AB  - Cyclooxygenase (COX), a prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase (PTGS), catalyzes the
      formation of prostaglandins from arachidonic acid. Prostaglandins are lipid
      signaling mediators that play a central role in a broad range of diverse
      physiological and pathophysiological processes, including inflammation,
      reproduction, nocioception, and gastrointestinal protection. Inhibition of
      cyclooxygenase activity is the mechanism by which nonsteroidal antiinflammatory
      drugs (NSAIDS) exert their analgesic, antipyretic, antiinflammatory, and
      antithrombotic effects. COX is currently believed to exist in three isoforms. In 
      this review, we provide a concise state-of-the-art description of the role of COX
      in pharmacology and toxicology of skin including its involvement in normal
      physiology, cutaneous inflammation, nociception, wound healing, and
      tumorigenesis. COX-dependent pathways influence keratinocyte differentiation,
      hair follicle development, and hair growth. The critical role of COX-2 in
      pathophysiology of skin is also addressed. COX-2 mediates inflammatory processes 
      in skin, including inflammatory hyperalgesia and nociception, and administration 
      of specific COX-2 inhibitors reduces edema, vascular permeability, and other
      markers of cutaneous inflammation. A number of studies in animal models and in
      humans show that COX-2 inhibitors possess cancer chemopreventive properties.
      Selective COX-2 inhibitors have a more favorable side-effect profile. Topical
      formulations of COX-2 inhibitors are being developed as a novel pharmacologic
      approach for the treatment of COX-2 mediated skin diseases.

TI  - Postoperative hemorrhage with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use after
      tonsillectomy: a meta-analysis.
PG  - 1086-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To use standard meta-analysis techniques to determine the risk of
      postoperative hemorrhage associated with the use of nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) after tonsillectomy. DATA SOURCES: The MEDLINE
      database (1966-2001) restricted to the English language was searched using the
      keywords tonsillectomy, hemorrhage, analgesics, and NSAID in various
      combinations. Additionally, published articles were cross-referenced. To ensure
      completeness, the search was rerun using the Science Citation Index database.
      STUDY SELECTION: Of the 110 articles identified, 7 were selected. Selected
      studies were prospective trials comparing the effects of an NSAID and a control
      drug on posttonsillectomy pain and hemorrhage in pediatric and/or adult patients.
      In all cases, the NSAID or control was administered through an enteric route in
      the postoperative period. Patients were monitored for early and delayed
      hemorrhage. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted independently by 2
      investigators. DATA SYNTHESIS: A random effects model was used to compute a
      pooled odds ratio. For the 1368 patients included in analysis, the pooled odds
      ratio of posttonsillectomy hemorrhage with NSAIDs compared with controls was 1.29
      and was not statistically significant (95% confidence interval, 0.85-1.73;
      P>/=.05). A subgroup analysis revealed an odds ratio of 0.93 (95% confidence
      interval, 0.44 -1.95; P>/=.05) for the nonaspirin NSAID group, while the aspirin 
      group had a statistically significant odds ratio of 1.94 (95% confidence
      interval, 1.09-3.42; P =.02). CONCLUSIONS: There is an increased risk of
      posttonsillectomy hemorrhage with the use of aspirin after tonsillectomy;
      however, there appears to be no significant increased risk of bleeding for
      nonaspirin NSAIDs in this meta-analysis.

TI  - Selective COX-2 inhibition and cardiovascular effects: a review of the rofecoxib 
      development program.
PG  - 591-604
AB  - See related Editorials on pages 561 and 563. Cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors
      appear to alter the balance of vasoactive eicosanoids (prostacyclin and
      thromboxane) and to suppress the inflammatory mediators implicated in the
      progression of atherogenesis and ischemic myocardial injury. Neutral, harmful,
      and beneficial cardiovascular (CV) effects have all been postulated to result
      from these changes. Investigations conducted with rofecoxib, a selective COX-2
      inhibitor, have substantially contributed to our understanding of this scientific
      area. Rofecoxib had little or no effect on platelet aggregation or
      platelet-derived thromboxane synthesis but reduced systemic prostacyclin
      synthesis by 50% to 60%. These findings prompted extensive analyses of CV
      thrombotic events within the rofecoxib development program. Among 5435
      osteoarthritis trial participants, similar rates of CV thrombotic events were
      reported with rofecoxib, placebo, and comparator, nonselective NSAIDs (ibuprofen,
      diclofenac, and nabumetone). In the VIGOR gastrointestinal outcomes trial of
      >8000 patients, naproxen (an NSAID with aspirin-like sustained antiplatelet
      effects throughout its dosing interval) was associated with a significantly lower
      risk of CV events than was rofecoxib. A subsequent pooled analysis from 23
      studies (including VIGOR) encompassing multiple disease states and including more
      than 14,000 patient-years at risk also demonstrated that rofecoxib was not
      associated with excess CV thrombotic events compared with either placebo or
      nonnaproxen NSAIDs. Again, naproxen appeared to be the outlier, suggesting a
      cardioprotective benefit of naproxen. Finally, among the predominantly elderly,
      male population participating in Alzheimer trials, both rofecoxib- and
      placebo-treated patients had similar rates of CV thrombotic events. The totality 
      of data is not consistent with an increased CV risk among patients taking
      rofecoxib.

TI  - Tolerability of rofecoxib in patients with adverse reactions to nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs: a study of 216 patients and literature review.
PG  - 82-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adverse reactions to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
      are frequent, particularly among patients with chronic urticaria or asthma. The
      identification of an alternative safe and reliable drug is a common problem in
      clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: To assess the tolerability of rofecoxib, a new
      NSAID that selectively inhibits the inducible isoform of cyclooxygenase, in a
      large group of NSAID-sensitive patients. METHODS: We studied 216 patients (164
      females and 52 males) who had suffered adverse reactions to one or more NSAIDs;
      98 subjects (45.4%) had experienced reactions to only one NSAID (single
      hypersensitivity) and 118 subjects (54.6%) had reacted to multiple NSAIDs
      (multiple hypersensitivity). Cutaneous reactions were reported by 79.6% of the
      subjects, respiratory symptoms by 10.7%, cutaneous and respiratory symptoms by
      8.3%, anaphylaxis by 1.4%. All the subjects underwent a single-blind,
      placebo-controlled oral challenge with divided therapeutic doses of rofecoxib
      (6.25 mg +18.75 mg 1 h later = cumulative dose of 25 mg). RESULTS: No reactions
      to the placebo were observed; only 1 subject (0.46%) experienced an urticarial
      reaction, after the second dose of rofecoxib. CONCLUSIONS: Considering previous
      studies and our own data, rofecoxib was well tolerated by all of the 174 patients
      with exclusively NSAID-related respiratory symptoms. Rofecoxib also had a very
      low rate (1.6%) of cross-reactivity in the 600 patients with exclusively
      cutaneous reactions to NSAIDs.

TI  - Analgesic effect of the synthetic cannabinoid CT-3 on chronic neuropathic pain: a
      randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 1757-62
AB  - CONTEXT: 1',1'dimethylheptyl-Delta8-tetrahydrocannabinol-11-oic acid (CT-3), a
      potent analog of THC-11-oic acid, produces marked antiallodynic and analgesic
      effects in animals without evoking the typical effects described in models of
      cannabinoids. Therefore, CT-3 may be an effective analgesic for poorly controlled
      resistant neuropathic pain. OBJECTIVE: To examine the analgesic efficacy and
      safety of CT-3 in chronic neuropathic pain in humans. DESIGN AND SETTING:
      Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover trial conducted in Germany
      from May-September 2002. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-one patients (8 women and 13 men)
      aged 29 to 65 years (mean, 51 years) who had a clinical presentation and
      examination consistent with chronic neuropathic pain (for at least 6 months) with
      hyperalgesia (n = 21) and allodynia (n = 7). INTERVENTIONS: Patients were
      randomized to two 7-day treatment orders in a crossover design. Two daily doses
      of CT-3 (four 10-mg capsules per day) or identical placebo capsules were given
      during the first 4 days and 8 capsules per day were given in 2 daily doses in the
      following 3 days. After a washout and baseline period of 1 week each, patients
      crossed over to the second 7-day treatment period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual 
      analog scale (VAS) and verbal rating scale scores for pain; vital sign,
      hematologic and blood chemistry, and electrocardiogram measurements; scores on
      the Trail-Making Test and the Addiction Research Center Inventory-Marijuana
      scale; and adverse effects. RESULTS: The mean differences over time for the VAS
      values in the CT-3-placebo sequence measured 3 hours after intake of study drug
      differed significantly from those in the placebo-CT-3 sequence (mean [SD], -11.54
      [14.16] vs 9.86 [21.43]; P =.02). Eight hours after intake of the drug, the pain 
      scale differences between groups were less marked. No dose response was observed.
      Adverse effects, mainly transient dry mouth and tiredness, were reported
      significantly more often during CT-3 treatment (mean [SD] difference, -0.67
      [0.50] for CT-3-placebo sequence vs 0.10 [0.74] for placebo-CT-3 sequence; P
      =.02). There were no significant differences with respect to vital signs, blood
      tests, electrocardiogram, Trail-Making Test, and Addiction Research Center
      Inventory-Marijuana scale. No carryover or period effects were observed except on
      the Trail-Making Test. CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary study, CT-3 was effective
      in reducing chronic neuropathic pain compared with placebo. No major adverse
      effects were observed.

TI  - Valdecoxib, a COX-2-specific inhibitor, does not affect cardiac repolarization.
PG  - 974-82
AB  - This double-blind, four-way crossover study assessed the effect of valdecoxib on 
      the QTc interval duration in 25 male and 9 female healthy adults. Subjects
      received placebo or 40 mg, 80 mg, or 120 mg valdecoxib once daily for 5 days.
      Serial ECGs were obtained for 24 hours before the first treatment (baseline) and 
      on the 5th day of each treatment. The study was statistically powered to detect a
      difference of > or = 5.6 ms in the average daily QTc change from baseline and a >
      or = 7.8-ms difference in the average maximal daily change from baseline. No QTc 
      prolongation versus placebo (Fridericia's or Bazett's correction) was observed
      for any valdecoxib dose. A 22% greater than proportional increase in valdecoxib
      AUC0-24 was observed over the 40- to 120-mg dose range, supporting the
      conclusiveness of the negative QTc risk assessment even at supratherapeutic doses
      (up to three times the maximum recommended dose of 40 mg per day) and
      concentrations. In conclusion, repeated administration of doses up to 120 mg
      valdecoxib had no effect on cardiac repolarization in healthy volunteers,
      suggesting that chronic administration of valdecoxib to patients would not
      increase the risk from cardiac arrhythmia associated with QT prolongation.

TI  - Single doses of parecoxib sodium intravenously are as effective as ketorolac in
      reducing pain after oral surgery.
PG  - 1030-7
AB  - PURPOSE: Our goal was to compare the analgesic efficacy and safety of single
      doses of intravenous parecoxib sodium, a prodrug of the novel cyclooxygenase
      (COX)-2-selective inhibitor valdecoxib, with intravenous ketorolac and placebo in
      postoperative oral surgery patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients
      experiencing moderate to severe pain within 6 hours of surgery to extract 2 or
      more impacted third molars were randomized to receive a single dose of parecoxib 
      sodium 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, or 100 mg; ketorolac 30 mg; or placebo. Analgesic
      efficacy was assessed over a 24-hour treatment period or until rescue analgesia
      was required. RESULTS: Parecoxib sodium doses (particularly 50 and 100 mg) had a 
      rapid onset of analgesia (within 11 minutes). The analgesic efficacy of parecoxib
      sodium 20 to 100 mg was similar to that of ketorolac 30 mg. Parecoxib sodium
      doses below 20 mg had suboptimal analgesic activity compared with placebo and
      ketorolac. A plateau of efficacy was observed at the parecoxib sodium 50-mg dose.
      Parecoxib sodium 50 and 100 mg had a significantly longer duration of analgesia
      than ketorolac 30 mg. All doses of parecoxib sodium were well tolerated.
      CONCLUSIONS: Parecoxib sodium, a novel parenteral prodrug of the COX-2-selective 
      inhibitor valdecoxib, is as effective and longer acting at 50- and 100-mg
      intravenous doses than a standard dose of ketorolac 30 mg intravenously.
      Parecoxib sodium appears to be safe and well tolerated and, therefore, merits
      further evaluation in other models of postsurgical pain.

TI  - Interaction of a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor with aspirin and
      NO-releasing aspirin in the human gastric mucosa.
PG  - 10937-41
AB  - In addition to inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX)-1-derived prostanoid biosynthesis,
      aspirin acetylates COX-2, enabling the conversion of arachidonic acid to
      15(R)-epi lipoxin A4, or aspirin-triggered lipoxin (ATL). Selective COX-2
      inhibitors block ATL formation and exacerbate mucosal injury in rats treated with
      aspirin. In the present study, we have examined whether inhibition of COX-2
      activity in healthy volunteers taking aspirin exacerbates gastric mucosal injury 
      and if such an effect would be prevented by NCX-4016, a NO-releasing derivative
      of aspirin. Thirty-two volunteers were randomized to receive 2 wk of treatment
      with NCX-4016 (800 mg twice a day) or aspirin (100 mg once a day) alone or in
      combination with 200 mg of celecoxib twice a day. Mucosal damage was assessed by 
      endoscopy. The mean mucosal injury score was 5.8 +/- 1.8 in subjects treated with
      aspirin and 2.4 +/- 0.7 (P < 0.01 vs. aspirin) in subjects treated with NCX-4016.
      Administration of celecoxib increased the injury score in volunteers treated with
      aspirin (9.9 +/- 1.9) but not in subjects taking NCX-4016 (1.5 +/- 0.8). Aspirin 
      and NCX-4016 caused a comparable suppression of serum thromboxane B2 levels and
      increased urinary excretion of ATL. Celecoxib inhibited endotoxin-induced
      prostaglandin E2 generation in whole blood by approximately 80% and abolished ATL
      formation. These findings suggests that (i) aspirin and NCX-4016 trigger ATL
      formation in humans, (ii) celecoxib inhibits ATL formation and exacerbates the
      mucosal injury caused by low doses of aspirin, and (iii) the NO-donating moiety
      of NCX-4016 protects the gastric mucosa even in the presence of suppression of
      COX-1 and COX-2.

TI  - The effect of the selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor rofecoxib on human
      colorectal cancer liver metastases.
PG  - 716-29
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is a potential target for
      chemotherapy of colorectal cancer (CRC). We tested the antineoplastic activity of
      the selective COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib on human CRC liver metastases by
      measuring surrogate markers of tumor growth and angiogenesis in a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. METHODS: Patients undergoing liver
      resection surgery for metastatic disease were randomized to receive rofecoxib 25 
      mg daily or placebo before surgery (duration, >14 days). The apoptosis index (AI;
      neocytokeratin 18), proliferation index (PI; Ki-67), and microvessel density
      (MVD; CD31) were measured in metastases by immunohistochemistry. The effect of
      rofecoxib on COX-2-positive HCA-7 human CRC cell PGE(2) synthesis, proliferation,
      and apoptosis in vitro was also investigated. RESULTS: Patients who received
      rofecoxib (n = 23) and placebo (n = 21) were well matched regarding clinical and 
      metastasis characteristics. The mean (range) duration of rofecoxib therapy was 26
      (14-46) days. Rofecoxib-treated metastases had a 29% decrease in MVD (mean, 25.1 
      [SEM, 2.7] per hpf) compared with placebo-treated tissue (32.5 [SEM, 4.5] per
      hpf; P = 0.15). There was little difference in AI (rofecoxib mean, 2.03% [SEM,
      0.43%] vs. placebo 1.39% [SEM, 0.39%]) or PI (rofecoxib 54.7% [SEM, 5.1%] vs.
      placebo 52.6% [SEM, 5.6%]). Rofecoxib-induced growth arrest and apoptosis of
      HCA-7 cells occurred only at concentrations (>10 micromol/L), which were
      significantly higher than the IC(50) for COX-2 inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: Rofecoxib
      may negatively regulate angiogenesis in human CRC liver metastases. The absence
      of a significant, direct effect of rofecoxib on epithelial cells in liver
      metastases in vivo mirrors the lack of activity on human CRC cells at
      pharmacologically relevant concentrations in vitro.

TI  - Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use is associated with reduction in
      recurrence of advanced and non-advanced colorectal adenomas (United States).
PG  - 403-11
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To prospectively examine the association between non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) use (including dose and dosage schedule) and the
      recurrence of colorectal adenomas among individuals who were diagnosed with an
      adenoma at entry into a clinical trial. METHODS: For this analysis, participants 
      who completed the full follow-up (n = 1905) for the Polyp Prevention Trial (PPT) 
      were evaluated. Information on current use and dose of NSAIDs and other drugs was
      obtained at baseline and at each subsequent study visit over the duration of the 
      trial. The study endpoint was the recurrence of colorectal adenomas in the 3
      years between the 1-year trial colonoscopy (T1) and the end of the trial
      colonoscopy (T4). RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in overall adenoma
      recurrence among NSAIDs users (odds ratio [OR] = 0.77; 95% confidence interval
      [CI]: 0.63-0.95), with the greatest effect seen in advanced polyps (OR = 0.51;
      CI: 0.33-0.79). Among aspirin users, we observed a significant dose response for 
      overall adenoma recurrence, with a 40% reduction in the OR association (OR =
      0.56; 95% CI: 0.31-0.99) among those taking more than 325 mg per day. CONCLUSION:
      This prospective study provides further evidence that NSAIDs may play an
      important role in the chemoprevention of recurrent colorectal adenomas, even
      those with advanced features.

TI  - Cyclo-oxygenase 2 inhibition in colorectal cancer therapy.
PG  - 1055-67
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cyclo-oxygenase inhibition for the treatment of colorectal neoplasia 
      has been studied with renewed interest since the discovery of cyclo-oxygenase
      (Cox) 2 and the introduction of specific Cox-2 inhibitors. These drugs have
      implications for both the prevention of colorectal carcinoma and the potential
      treatment of the disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: A Medline database search was
      performed for articles using the keywords "colonic, colon or rectal and neoplasia
      or cancer" and "cyclo-oxygenase or Cox-2." Cross-references of relevant
      historical papers were also included. There is substantial evidence that Cox-2
      plays a role in the development and progression of colorectal cancer. The
      specific inhibition of this enzyme has been shown to inhibit cancer growth in in 
      vitro and in vivo models. The mechanisms of action for these effects are poorly
      understood and potential clinical applications at present remain under
      investigation. CONCLUSION: Cox-2 inhibitors have great promise as useful
      additions to current cancer treatments. There is a need for randomized clinical
      trials to define a role for these drugs in chemoprevention, recurrence
      prophylaxis, and adjuvant therapy for colorectal and other solid tumours.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of different postoperative analgesic treatments.
PG  - 1507-19
AB  - Pain may produce metabolic changes after surgery, which may contribute to further
      morbidity. A variety of medicines and techniques can be used to successfully
      treat pain. It is postulated that improved analgesia leads to improved outcomes, 
      although analgesics may also contribute to morbidity. This article reviews the
      literature evaluating the cost-effectiveness of providing different types of
      postoperative analgesics and finds that most studies are so poorly conducted that
      they prevent definitive conclusions being made. The author suggests that further 
      studies be done using analgesics as just one part of a multimodal rehabilitation 
      approach with careful attention to defining outcome, costs and achieving
      sufficient power to find or exclude meaningful differences.

PG  - 435-42
AB  - Several agents have been evaluated for the second-line treatment of patients with
      non-small cell lung cancer. The TAX 317 trial found that patients treated with
      docetaxel (Taxotere) 75 mg/m2 had significantly longer survival than those
      treated with best supportive care alone. In addition, symptom control was better 
      for patients who received chemotherapy. The TAX 320 trial found that treatment
      with docetaxel 75 or 100 mg/m2 resulted in significantly higher response rates
      than treatment with vinorelbine (Navelbine) or ifosfamide (Mitoxana), and the
      1-year survival rate was also significantly better for patients treated with
      docetaxel 75 mg/m2. A large randomized trial compared pemetrexed (LY-231514 or
      Alimta) 500 mg/m2 with docetaxel 75 mg/m2. Response and survival rates were
      similar in the two treatment arms, however, the toxicity profile of pemetrexed
      was superior to that of docetaxel with significantly less Grade 3/4 neutropenia
      and febrile neutropenia. Fewer patients in the pemetrexed arm required
      hospitalization. Topotecan (Hycamtin) 2.3 mg/m2/day orally for 5 days has been
      compared with docetaxel 75 mg/m2 in a large 800-patient study. The results of
      this trial are awaited. Gemcitabine (Gemzar) and irinotecan (Campto) have been
      evaluated both as single agents and in combination with each other and study
      results do not suggest that either of these drugs is superior to docetaxel or
      pemetrexed. The vinca alkaloid vinorelbine has proved to be inferior to docetaxel
      in a randomized trial. The epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors gefitinib 
      (ZD1839, Iressa) and erlotinib (CP-358774, OSI 774, Tarceva) have been evaluated 
      in Phase II trials in the second- and third-line setting. Both drugs have
      demonstrated interesting response rates ranging from 10 to almost 20%. The
      results of placebo-controlled randomized trials of this family of drugs are
      awaited. In summary, several studies have now found a definite role for the
      second-line treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

TI  - Effect of celecoxib and dexamethasone on postoperative pain after lumbar disc
      surgery.
PG  - 331-6; discussion 336-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to assess the efficacy of perioperative
      administration of celecoxib (Celebrex; Pharmacia GmbH, Erlangen, Germany) in
      reducing pain and opioid requirements after single-level lumbar microdiscectomy. 
      METHODS: We studied 34 patients (mean age, 44.26 yr; standard deviation [SD],
      13.09 yr) allocated randomly to receive celecoxib 200 mg twice a day for 72 hours
      starting on the evening before surgery or placebo capsules in a double-blind
      study. Fourteen patients received 20 to 80 mg dexamethasone intravenously during 
      surgery (mean, 40 mg; SD, 19.22 mg) because of visible signs of compression of
      the affected nerve root. After lumbar disc surgery, patients were monitored for
      visual analog scores for pain at rest and on movement, patient-controlled
      analgesia (PCA) piritramide requirements, and von Frey thresholds in the wound
      area. RESULTS: Pain scores decreased and wound von Frey thresholds increased
      continuously until discharge, with no intergroup differences. Mean 24-hour PCA
      piritramide requirements were 22.63 mg (SD, 23.72 mg) and 26.14 mg (SD, 22.57 mg)
      in the celecoxib and placebo groups, respectively (P = not significant). However,
      patients with intraoperative dexamethasone (n = 14) required only 10.29 mg (SD,
      8.55 mg) 24-hour PCA piritramide, in contrast to the 34.25 mg (SD, 24.69 mg)
      needed in those who did not receive intraoperative dexamethasone (P = 0.001). In 
      addition, 24 hours after the operation, pain scores on movement were
      significantly lower in the dexamethasone subgroup (P = 0.003). CONCLUSION:
      Celecoxib has no effect on postoperative pain scores and PCA piritramide
      requirements. The intraoperative use of 20 to 80 mg dexamethasone is able to
      significantly decrease postoperative piritramide consumption and pain scores on
      the first day after surgery.

TI  - Colorectal cancer.
PG  - 263-75
AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of mortality and accounts
      for approximately 200000 deaths per year in Europe and the USA. Chemotherapy and 
      radiotherapy have established roles in the treatment of colorectal cancer and can
      contribute to cure rate, prolongation of survival, reduction of local rates of
      recurrence and enhanced quality of life in patients with advanced disease.
      However, over the past few years there have been major advances in our
      understanding of the molecular basis of this tumour and its progression from
      adenoma to carcinoma that hold potential for translation into novel strategies
      for the treatment of CRC. Furthermore, newer agents directed against different
      intracellular targets have also been shown to be efficacious in CRC treatment.
      Such improvements should continue to lead to increased cure rates in early
      disease and better overall survival in advanced cases. The aim of this review is 
      to provide an overview of the pathogenesis of CRC and to present the evidence
      base for chemotherapy and some of the novel strategies that are currently being
      evaluated in phase I and II trials.

TI  - Celecoxib inhibits metabolism of cytochrome P450 2D6 substrate metoprolol in
      humans.
PG  - 130-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In vitro data have shown that celecoxib inhibits the metabolism of
      cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 substrates. However, very limited data are available on
      the influence of cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors on the disposition of CYP2D6
      substrates in humans. Therefore the objective of this study was to examine the
      effect of celecoxib and rofecoxib on the pharmacokinetics of the clinically
      relevant CYP2D6 substrate metoprolol. METHODS: An open, randomized, 3-period
      crossover study was performed in 12 healthy male volunteers. Metoprolol (50 mg)
      was given in all 3 periods without or after 7 days of pretreatment with celecoxib
      (200 mg twice daily) or rofecoxib (25 mg daily) to achieve steady-state
      conditions of cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors in periods 2 and 3. RESULTS: Celecoxib 
      significantly increased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve of
      metoprolol from 271 to 414 micro g. h/L (64% +/- 57%, P <.001) and by more than
      200% in 1 volunteer. The extent of this drug interaction was more pronounced in
      volunteers with 2 fully functional alleles compared with volunteers with 1 fully 
      functional allele (103% +/- 75% versus 36% +/- 23%, P <.05). After administration
      of celecoxib, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 24
      hours of alpha-hydroxymetoprolol decreased significantly from 474 to 387 micro g.
      h/L (P <.01). Rofecoxib caused no significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of 
      metoprolol. CONCLUSION: We conclude that celecoxib inhibits the metabolism of the
      CYP2D6 substrate metoprolol but that rofecoxib does not. Clinically relevant drug
      interaction may occur between celecoxib and CYP2D6 substrates, particularly those
      with a narrow therapeutic index.

TI  - Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and molecular carcinogenesis of colorectal 
      carcinomas.
PG  - 230-2
AB  - CONTEXT: Colorectal cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related
      mortality in the west. The high incidence and mortality make effective prevention
      an important public-health and economic issue. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs (NSAIDs) can inhibit colorectal carcinogenesis and are among the few agents
      known to be chemopreventive. Randomised trials have shown that sulindac and
      celecoxib suppress the development of adenomatous polyps and cause regression of 
      existing polyps in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), who have a
      high risk for developing colorectal cancer. The mechanisms by which NSAIDs
      inhibit neoplastic growth are not fully known. STARTING POINT: Two recently
      reported randomised placebo-controlled trials show a chemopreventive effect of
      aspirin in populations other than those with FAP (Robert Sandler and colleagues, 
      N Engl J Med 2003; 348: 883-90; John Baron and colleagues, N Engl J Med 2003;
      348: 891-99). In the Sandler study 635 patients with colorectal cancer were
      randomised to receive 325 mg aspirin or placebo daily. After a follow-up of
      around 31 months, the mean number of adenomas was lower in the aspirin group than
      in the placebo group, corresponding to a relative risk of any recurrent adenoma
      in the aspirin group of 0.65. In the Baron study 1121 patients with colorectal
      adenomas were assigned to receive 81 or 325 mg aspirin or placebo daily.
      Follow-up colonoscopy, 32 months after the index endoscopy, showed an incidence
      of one or more adenomas of 38% in the 81 mg aspirin group, 45% in the 325 mg
      aspirin group, and 47% in the placebo group. Together, these studies indicate a
      moderate chemopreventive effect of aspirin in populations with an intermediate
      risk of developing colorectal cancer. WHERE NEXT? The anticancer properties of
      NSAIDs have been demonstrated in vitro and in animal studies, epidemiological
      reports, and intervention studies. Several mechanisms through which NSAIDs alter 
      colonic carcinogenesis have been elucidated, including the induction of apoptosis
      in neoplastic cells, via mechanisms dependent and independent of cyclo-oxygenase.
      Some studies have suggested an important role for the cell-cycle regulating
      protein p21 in mediating the chemopreventive effect of sulindac. A decrease in
      p21 expression may be one of the main oncogenic events in the development of
      colorectal cancer. Thus p21 could be the molecular link in the chemopreventive
      effects of NSAIDs.

TI  - Metronomic oral low-dose treosulfan chemotherapy combined with cyclooxygenase-2
      inhibitor in pretreated advanced melanoma: a pilot study.
PG  - 377-82
AB  - PURPOSE: The safety and efficacy of oral metronomic low-dose treosulfan
      chemotherapy in combination with the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor rofecoxib
      as a compound with antiangiogenic potential, a therapeutic regimen optimally
      targeting endothelial cells instead of tumor cells, were assessed in pretreated
      advanced melanoma patients. METHODS: Endothelial cells were analyzed for
      proliferation, apoptosis and cytotoxicity in response to increasing
      concentrations of treosulfan, either in the absence or presence of COX-2
      inhibitor, to determine whether inhibition of COX-2 enhanced the effect of
      treosulfan on cell function. In a clinical pilot study, 12 consecutive patients
      with pretreated advanced melanoma, meeting the eligibility criteria were
      enrolled. Patients received combined daily treosulfan chemotherapy (500 mg) with 
      rofecoxib (25 mg). Metastatic lesions were assessed every 12 weeks. Patients with
      responsive or stable disease were eligible for a further 12-week treatment
      period. Response criteria according to the WHO handbook for reporting results of 
      cancer treatment were applied. Side effects were classified according to the
      National Cancer Institute's Common Toxicity Criteria v2.0. RESULTS: At
      noncytotoxic concentrations, treosulfan inhibited endothelial cell proliferation 
      in a dose-dependent fashion. Simultaneous inhibition of COX-2 significantly
      increased the extent to which treosulfan suppressed cell proliferation, without
      inducing cytotoxicity. In the pilot study in which 12 patients were treated,
      toxicity was mild; only hematologic toxicity of grade II was seen. An objective
      response was noted in one patient, and four patients showed stabilization of
      their disease for 24 weeks (one) and 36 weeks (three). The patient who had a
      partial response subsequently showed stable disease for 48 weeks. The median
      survival time was 13 months. CONCLUSIONS: As increases in response rates
      following polychemo- or biochemotherapy have not been shown to correlate with
      prolongation in overall survival, more durable control of metastatic melanoma
      represents an attractive therapeutic goal. Thus, regimens scheduled to primarily 
      target endothelial cells may potentially provide a palliative alternative that
      preserves quality of life in the absence of significant treatment-related
      toxicity.

AB  - The synthesis and the pharmacological activity of a series of
      1,5-diarylimidazoles developed as potent and selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)
      inhibitors are described. The new compounds were evaluated both in vitro (COX-1
      and COX-2 inhibition in human whole blood) and in vivo (carrageenan-induced paw
      edema, air-pouch, and hyperalgesia tests). Modification of all the positions of
      two regioisomeric imidazole cores led to the identification of
      4-[4-chloro-5-(3-fluoro-4-methoxyphenyl)imidazol-1-yl]benzenesulfonamide
      (UR-8880, 51f) as the best candidate, which is now undergoing Phase I clinical
      trials.

TI  - Economic analysis of celecoxib versus diclofenac plus omeprazole for the
      treatment of arthritis in patients at risk of ulcer disease.
PG  - 217-22
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the economic impact of celecoxib therapy vs. diclofenac plus
      omeprazole therapy for the treatment of arthritis in Chinese patients with a high
      risk of bleeding, from the perspective of a public health organization in Hong
      Kong. METHODS: The medical records of 287 Chinese arthritic patients with a
      history of bleeding ulcers who had previously participated in a randomised study 
      of celecoxib 200 mg twice daily and extended-release diclofenac 75 mg twice daily
      plus 20 mg of omeprazole daily for 6 months were reviewed. RESULTS: Compared to
      the diclofenac plus omeprazole group, the average total direct cost per patient
      in the celecoxib group showed a significant reduction of 11%, from HK 10,915
      (range HK dollars 10,915-57,899) to HK dollars 9714 (range HK dollars
      9714-89,770) (P<0.0001) (1 US dollars=7.8 HK dollars). The median direct medical 
      cost for routine management in the celecoxib group was significantly lower (11%) 
      than that for the diclofenac plus omeprazole group [HK dollars 10,915 (range
      10,915-28,048) vs. HK dollars 9714 (range HK dollars 6946-26,179) (P<0.0001)]. In
      patients who experienced recurrent bleeding, the celecoxib group showed a
      significantly higher median cost of management of recurrent bleeding than the
      diclofenac plus omeprazole group [HK dollars 8466 (range 572-29,851) vs. HK
      dollars 23,210 (range HK dollars 12,318-65,823)] (P=0.036). CONCLUSIONS:
      Celecoxib therapy appears to cost less compared with diclofenac plus omeprazole
      for treatment of arthritis in Chinese patients with a high risk of bleeding.

TI  - Chronic urticaria with multiple NSAID intolerance: is tramadol always a safe
      alternative analgesic?
PG  - 56-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mechanisms underlying multiple intolerance to nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) in patients with chronic urticaria (CU) are
      unclear. One hypothesis is that COX-1 inhibition may play a relevant pathogenic
      role. If so, drugs that are not active on COX-1 would be expected to be well
      tolerated by CU patients. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at assessing the
      tolerability of a central analgesic (tramadol) in a group of patients with CU and
      a history of intolerance to several NSAIDs, asking for a safe, alternative
      compound. METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with CU exacerbated by several, distinct
      NSAIDs underwent single-blind, placebo-controlled, oral challenges with
      increasing doses of tramadol (50 mg total dose). Most of them underwent oral
      challenges with rofecoxib, paracetamol, and/or nimesulide as well. RESULTS:
      Twenty-three patients tolerated tramadol, whereas, surprisingly, in 5 (18%)
      patients tramadol induced urticaria, in one case with laryngeal edema. A similar 
      proportion of CU patients did not tolerate rofecoxib, and higher proportions of
      patients did not tolerate acetaminophen and nimesulide. CONCLUSIONS: Mechanisms
      other than COX inhibition may also play a role in drug intolerance in patients
      with CU. In CU patients intolerant to NSAID, the tolerability of tramadol, as
      well as of other "alternative" drugs, should be assessed by oral challenge tests.

TI  - Celecoxib, a highly selective COX-2 inhibitor, is safe in aspirin-induced asthma 
      patients.
PG  - 20-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 5-10% of adult patients with asthma, aspirin and most other
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) precipitate acute asthmatic
      attacks. Therefore, choosing an alternative anti-inflammatory agent for patients 
      who have suffered adverse reactions to a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent is 
      a common problem in clinical practice. The discoveries that cyclooxygenase COX-2 
      is an inducible form of COX involved in inflammation and COX-1 is the major
      isoform responsible for the production of prostaglandins have provided a
      reasonable basis for the development of specific COX-2 inhibitors as a new class 
      of anti-inflammatory agents. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to
      demonstrate that celecoxib, a specific inhibitor of COX-2, does not cause
      asthmatic attacks in patients with aspirin and/or other nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drug-induced asthma. METHODS: We studied 33 patients, all of
      whom suffered from asthma induced by at least two different NSAID drugs. They
      were challenged in a single-blind manner with different doses of celecoxib on
      three different days, until either the therapeutic dose of 200 mg or intolerance 
      was reached. Each patient was rechallenged with 200 mg celecoxib seven days later
      if no evidence of intolerance was previously observed. RESULTS: Celecoxib 200 mg 
      was proven to be well tolerated in all 30 three aspirin- and NSAID-induced asthma
      patients. CONCLUSION: Our study appears to demonstrate that celecoxib is a
      suitable NSAID in aspirin-induced and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
      drug-induced asthma patients.

TI  - Scratch-patch and patch testing in drug allergy--an assessment of specificity.
PG  - 12-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adverse drug reactions occur frequently in daily practice, but the
      identification of the eliciting drugs is difficult due to a lack of standardized 
      procedures. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare scratch-patch and
      patch tests prospectively with frequently used drugs in persons exposed or not
      exposed to the drug in order to define a nonirritating concentration. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: Altogether, 23 different drugs, mainly antibiotics and analgesics,
      were evaluated. Any contraindications for patch tests were excluded by a
      questionnaire. Sixty-one healthy individuals were tested. They were divided into 
      two groups: Group 1 consisted of individuals who hadn't been exposed to the drug;
      Group 2 was comprised of individuals who had been exposed to the drug, without
      side effects. Each individual was tested with 10-20 scratch-patch and patch
      tests. The tests were performed on the upper back. Freshly prepared drug
      solutions were applied, on one side after scarification of the epidermis, on the 
      other side without. Scratch-patch tests were read at 24 and 48 h, patch tests
      after 48 and 72 h. In addition, we included 73 individuals with a drug allergy to
      illustrate that the chosen drug concentrations are able to elicit a positive
      reaction in truly sensitized individuals. RESULTS: A positive reaction in the
      non-exposed and nonallergic individuals was considered to be an irritant reaction
      (IR). In Group 1 (non-exposed individuals), 341 scratch-patch tests were
      performed, with 22 showing a reaction at the first reading, 3 at the second. Of
      the 341 patch tests performed in this group, 21 reactions were observed at the
      first reading, and 7 at the second. In Group 2 (exposed individuals), 141
      scratch-patch tests were performed, with 5 IR at the first reading and 1 at the
      second. Of the 138 patch tests performed in this group, 6 individuals showed an
      IR at the first, 2 at the second reading. The majority of IR were four drugs,
      namely cefuroxim, acetylsalicylic acid, propyphenazone/drofenin-HCl, and
      celecoxib. Lowering the concentration did not reduce the unspecified irritant
      skin reaction, while a change of the solvent (petrolatum instead of PBS) did
      reduce the IR. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show concentrations of 23 drugs suitable for
      scratch-patch or patch tests, as they do not elicit IR. Fourteen of these test
      preparations elicited a positive reaction in truly sensitized individuals,
      demonstrating that the test preparation is suitable to identify sensitized
      persons. Scratch-patch tests are an interesting alternative to patch tests, as
      they do not elicit more IR than patch tests but can be evaluated earlier. Certain
      drugs solved in PBS are irritant over a wide dosage range and need to be applied 
      in petrolatum.

TI  - The potential of anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's
      disease.
PG  - 279-84
AB  - Genetic evidence suggests that generation of amyloid beta peptide is the pivotal 
      step in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The mechanism by which
      this peptide induces neurodegeneration may involve inflammatory processes.
      Pharmacological suppression of inflammation may therefore ameliorate the
      neuropathology. Basic research studies provide substantial evidence that
      inflammatory processes present in the brains of patients with AD are destructive,
      and that anti-inflammatory drugs can provide protection. Furthermore,
      epidemiological studies suggest that anti-inflammatory drugs reduce the risk of
      AD. However, there is not yet any strong evidence from completed randomised
      controlled trials that anti-inflammatory treatment is beneficial. Large trials of
      glucocorticoid therapy, hydroxychloroquine, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs (NSAIDs) in the treatment of AD have so far been disappointing. Several
      studies, including a large primary prevention trial with NSAIDs, are still in
      progress. Major issues of selection of patients, drug regimen, and duration of
      treatment remain unresolved.

TI  - A comparison of the upper gastrointestinal mucosal effects of valdecoxib,
      naproxen and placebo in healthy elderly subjects.
PG  - 125-32
AB  - BACKGROUND: In long-term outcomes studies, cyclooxygenase COX-2 specific
      inhibitors spare COX-1 at supratherapeutic doses and therefore demonstrate
      improved gastrointestinal safety over nonspecific nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
      drugs (NSAIDs). However, in clinical practice, anti-inflammatory drugs are often 
      used for short-term treatment of pain. AIM: To compare the short-term upper
      gastrointestinal mucosal effects of naproxen with the new COX-2 specific
      inhibitor, valdecoxib, or placebo, in elderly subjects. METHODS: In this
      multicentre, double-blind, randomized, study, elderly subjects (65-76 years old),
      with a normal baseline esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), received oral valdecoxib
      (a supratherapeutic 40 mg b.d. dosage, n = 62), naproxen (500 mg b.d., n = 62),
      or placebo (n = 62) for 6.5 days. Upper gastrointestinal mucosal injury was
      evaluated post-treatment by EGD (day 7). RESULTS: Subjects receiving naproxen
      (11/60, 18%) had significantly more gastroduodenal ulcers post-treatment than
      those receiving placebo (2/61, 3%; P < 0.01) or valdecoxib (0/60, 0%; P < 0.001).
      A similar significant finding was observed for gastric ulcer rates. All
      treatments had similar adverse event rates and clinical laboratory findings.
      CONCLUSIONS: Valdecoxib, even at supratherapeutic doses, was associated with an
      ulcer rate significantly lower than naproxen but similar to placebo in healthy
      elderly subjects, despite the short duration of therapy (6.5 days). Naproxen and 
      valdecoxib were as well tolerated as placebo.

TI  - Experience of rofecoxib in patients with osteoarthritis previously treated with
      traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in Spain: results of phase 2 of
      the VICOXX study.
PG  - 288-97
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare patient and physician attitudes to osteoarthritis (OA)
      treatment with rofecoxib or traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
      (tNSAIDs). METHODS: A 6-month prospective study involving 562 OA patients
      enrolled at 29 Spanish primary-care centres. Patients were continued on
      established tNSAID therapy for the first 3 months then switched to rofecoxib 12.5
      or 25 mg/day. RESULTS: Both patients and physicians were significantly more
      likely to be satisfied with rofecoxib treatment than with tNSAIDs (p < 0.001) and
      assessments of overall health status improved significantly during rofecoxib
      therapy (p < 0.001). Adherence to therapy was significantly better with rofecoxib
      than during tNSAID treatment (p < 0.001). Use of rofecoxib was associated with a 
      significant reduction in the proportion of discontinuations attributed to lack of
      effectiveness (p < 0.001) or gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (p < 0.001
      compared with tNSAIDs). Rofecoxib was also associated with a > 60% reduction in
      the proportion of patients experiencing a GI adverse event and a halving in the
      proportion of patients who received GI co-medications; concomitant analgesic use 
      decreased by one-third during rofecoxib therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Use of rofecoxib
      was associated with marked improvements in several indices of treatment
      effectiveness and tolerability, and in patient and physician satisfaction and
      perception of general health status compared with tNSAIDs. Rofecoxib is a
      valuable additional medication for relieving the symptoms of OA and its use in
      place of tNSAIDs may lead to a reduction in the prescription of concomitant
      medications.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of the cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors parecoxib and valdecoxib
      in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery.
PG  - 1481-92
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Inhibition of cyclooxygenase 2 provides analgesia in ambulatory
      patients. We prospectively evaluated the safety and efficacy of a newly
      introduced cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor in patients undergoing coronary artery
      bypass grafting surgery through a median sternotomy in a randomized clinical
      trial. METHODS: A total of 462 patients with New York Heart Association classes I
      to III who were less than 77 years of age and were from 58 institutions in the
      United States, Canada, Germany, and the United Kingdom participated in this
      multicenter, phase III, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized,
      parallel-group trial. Patients were allocated at a ratio of 2:1 to
      parecoxib/valdecoxib or standard care (control) groups, respectively. Intravenous
      study drug (40 mg) was administered within 30 minutes after extubation and every 
      12 hours for a minimum of 3 days. Subsequently, oral treatment at a dose of 40 mg
      every 12 hours was initiated and administered for a combined total of 14 days.
      Patient-controlled analgesia with morphine, oral opioids, or acetaminophen was
      available as required. Assessment of the analgesic efficacy of the study drug was
      primarily based on morphine and morphine equivalent use. Additional efficacy
      evaluations included daily pain intensity, patient and physician global
      evaluation of study medication, and pain effect on quality of life. Clinical
      adverse events were assessed by the principal investigator at each site from the 
      time of the first dose through the 30-day postdosing period. RESULTS: Patients in
      the parecoxib/valdecoxib group received significantly less morphine or morphine
      equivalents than patients in the control group during the 0- to 24-hour (P
      =.009), 24- to 48-hour (P =.017), 72- to 96-hour (P =.002), 96- to 120-hour (P
      =.004), and 120- to 144-hour (P =.037) periods. Both patients (P <.001) and
      physicians (P <.001) evaluated the study medication as significantly better than 
      control therapy. The modified Brief Pain Inventory questionnaire used in the oral
      dosing period detected significant improvements in the parecoxib/valdecoxib
      treatment group in 6 of 8 domains tested (eg, current pain, worst pain, and mood)
      beginning on day 4 and continuing for at least 4 days. Although there were no
      differences between the groups in overall adverse events, serious adverse events 
      occurred twice as frequently in parecoxib/valdecoxib-treated patients (19.0%,
      59/311 patients) than in control patients (9.9%, 15/151 patients; P =.015).
      Regarding individual serious adverse events, a greater incidence in sternal wound
      infection was found in the parecoxib/valdecoxib patients (10 [3.2%]) versus
      control patients (0 [0%]) (P =.035). The incidences of other individual serious
      adverse events, including cerebrovascular complications, myocardial infarction,
      and renal dysfunction, were proportionally greater but not significantly
      different between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing coronary artery
      bypass grafting surgery, the cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor combination,
      parecoxib/valdecoxib, was effective for postoperative analgesia. However, the
      14-day treatment regimen also was associated with an increased incidence of
      serious adverse events overall and sternal wound infections in particular.
      Therefore our study raises important concerns requiring their comprehensive
      evaluation in a large-scale trial before these cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors are
      used in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery.

TI  - Antiplatelet therapy in peripheral arterial disease. Consensus statement.
PG  - 1-16
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Antiplatelet agents are commonly prescribed to reduce the risk of
      myocardial infarction, stroke and graft occlusion in patients with peripheral
      arterial disease (PAD). The objective was to summarise current evidence and
      provide recommendations on the use of antiplatelet agents in PAD. METHODS: A
      consensus group was assembled including 20 specialists from a variety of fields
      involved in the management of patients with PAD. Data was circulated in a
      systematic manner prior to a main consensus meeting held in November 2001. The
      document subsequently produced was circulated within the group to ensure
      agreement in the interpretation and presentation of its findings. RESULTS:
      Consensus recommendations are provided in 7 common or contentious scenarios in
      PAD. The recommendations are graded to reflect the evidence available and
      interpretations of the group. Although the document provides recommendations, it 
      is stressed that they must be interpreted in the light of individual patient
      circumstances. CONCLUSION: Antiplatelet agents have an important role in the
      management of patient with PAD. Although this document provides consensus
      recommendations, the optimum treatment in many scenarios remains unclear due to a
      lack of focussed clinical trials in PAD.

TI  - Response relationship of VAS and Likert scales in osteoarthritis efficacy
      measurement.
PG  - 499-507
AB  - OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: Efficacy in osteoarthritis (OA) is principally measured
      using subjective visual analogue (VAS) and/or Likert scale responses. The
      relationship between these two scales and their relative precision in
      discriminating active from placebo treatment in OA patients was determined.
      DESIGN/METHODS: Patient overall pain assessment, and patient and investigator
      global assessments were each measured on a 100mm VAS and on a 0 to 4 point Likert
      scale in a 6-week OA study of rofecoxib vs placebo. The relationship between the 
      VAS and Likert responses was examined graphically and via summary statistics.
      Analysis of variance was used to assess consistency of the VAS/Likert
      relationship over time and across the different endpoints. Precision was compared
      using effect size, and normality of VAS scale of measurement was assessed using
      the Shapiro-Wilk test. RESULTS: Mean VAS scores and changes from baseline at
      individual time points were generally highly correlated with corresponding Likert
      responses (r-values generally approximately 0.7-0.8). The magnitude of VAS values
      and changes varied depending on endpoint, on the associated magnitude of
      increment of Likert score, and on the Likert baseline value (i.e., where on the
      Likert scale the change was occurring). Precision of VAS and Likert responses to 
      detect difference between treatments was generally similar with effect sizes
      approximately 1. Normality and homogeneity of variance of VAS scores was most
      closely approximated by actual changes in comparison to percent change or
      log-transformed measures. CONCLUSIONS: VAS and Likert responses are highly
      correlated and yield similar precision for discriminating treatments in OA
      patients. Since Likert responses are easier to administer and interpret, they may
      be preferable to measure OA response.

AB  - Ambulatory surgery provides quality care that is cost-effective. The use of
      innovative surgical and anesthetic techniques will allow larger numbers of
      patients to take advantage of the benefits of undergoing an elective operation on
      an ambulatory basis. Anesthesiologists will be faced with more complex surgery,
      which will require careful selection and assessment of patients to ensure
      continuity of the excellent safety record of ambulatory anesthesia. Minor adverse
      events, such as pain and PONV, are still common. The occurrence of these minor
      adverse advents is now the major area of quality assessment and an area where
      improvement could be targeted. Fast tracking facilitates earlier discharge, but
      we must ensure this has benefit to the patient as speedy discharge may mask the
      true incidence of adverse minor symptoms. This can lead to patient
      dissatisfaction and a poor impression of ambulatory surgery.

TI  - Current concepts and new developments in the treatment of psoriatic arthritis.
PG  - 1138-48
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory arthropathy
      characterized by the association of arthritis with psoriasis. Many agents have
      been proposed for the treatment of PsA, but their use is based more on clinical
      experience than on sound scientific evidence. METHODS: We reviewed MedLine up to 
      November 2002, searching for 'psoriatic arthritis', 'drug therapy, 'controlled
      trials' and 'outcomes' and all possible acronyms for these terms. All relevant
      papers were then examined in detail. RESULTS: PsA is a condition that runs a
      variable clinical course. Mild forms can usually be controlled by non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Intra-articular glucocorticoid injections are
      indicated in patients with persistent mono- or oligoarthritis. Patients with
      severe and progressive articular disease not responsive to NSAIDs should be
      treated with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) to prevent joint
      damage and disability. Currently, methotrexate and sulphasalazine are considered 
      the DMARDs of choice, but the evidence for the use of methotrexate in PsA is
      still largely empirical, while the clinical benefit induced by sulphasalazine
      appears to be modest. Other DMARDs proposed for the treatment of PsA include
      cyclosporin, gold salts and, more recently, leflunomide. However, none of the
      DMARDs available to date are effective in the treatment of psoriatic
      pelvispondylitis; in addition, a number of patients with severe peripheral
      arthritis fail to respond to standard DMARDs. Recently, tumour necrosis factor
      alpha inhibitors have proved effective in many PsA patients with pelvispondylitis
      or recalcitrant peripheral synovitis. CONCLUSIONS: None of the current treatments
      for PsA is curative, but significant clinical amelioration can be achieved in the
      vast majority of patients. Identification and prompt treatment of patients with
      severe articular disease is crucial for the achievement of a satisfactory
      clinical response and the improvement of the long-term outcome.

TI  - Etoricoxib in the treatment of chronic pain.
PG  - 315-8
AB  - For the many patients who suffer chronic pain, we seek the most effective
      anti-inflammatory drug with the least side-effect profile and the greatest
      long-term safety. Etoricoxib, a selective COX2 inhibitor, has been shown to be as
      effective as non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the
      management of chronic pain in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, for
      periods of up to one year. Data on etoricoxib efficacy in chronic low back pain
      is beginning to emerge. The side-effect profile of etoricoxib suggests it is well
      tolerated with similar adverse effects to non-selective NSAIDs. Larger studies
      are awaited, to see whether superior gastrointestinal tolerability can be proven.
      Further work will be required to show that etoricoxib is safe in patients with
      pre-existing cardiovascular or gastrointestinal comorbidity, and the potentially 
      confounding role of aspirin still needs to be elucidated. However, etoricoxib
      shows promise as a new and effective COX2 inhibitor in clinical practice.

TI  - Carcinogenesis and cyclooxygenase: the potential role of COX-2 inhibition in
      upper aerodigestive tract cancer.
PG  - 537-46
AB  - Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is upregulated in a number of epithelial cancers,
      including in upper aerodigestive tract (UADT) premalignant and malignant lesions.
      The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive examination of the
      potential of COX-2 inhibition in prevention of UADT premalignant and malignant
      disease. A Medline and Cancerlit literature search was conducted for the period
      1993-2002, and identified literature was reviewed. There is evidence from in
      vitro studies, as well as animal models, that inhibition of COX-2 may suppress
      carcinogenesis by affecting a number of pathways of carcinogenesis, promoting
      apoptosis and inhibiting angiogenesis. Preliminary studies of gastro-intestinal
      (GI) carcinogenesis suggest that COX-2 inhibitors may represent an approach to
      the chemoprevention of epithelial cancers. COX-2 inhibitors may have a potential 
      role in chemoprevention of UADT cancer, and clinical trials appear warranted.

TI  - Evaluation of efficacy, safety and tolerability of valdecoxib in osteo-arthritis 
      patients--an Indian study.
PG  - 673-4
AB  - Valdecoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor, has been introduced as a new treatment for
      osteo-arthritis (OA). The present study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy,
      safety and tolerability of valdecoxib, in OA patients in an Indian setting. The
      present 4-week study was a prospective, non-comparative, assessor blind, single
      group, multicentric trial with OA patients treated with valdecoxib, 10 mg once a 
      day. Efficacy was assessed by analysing the changes in Western Ontario and
      McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), visual analogue scale (VAS), 
      patient's and physician's global assessment of arthritis. The incidence of
      adverse events was monitored throughout the study. There was a clinical and
      statistical significant improvement in the mean pain score, stiffness score,
      physical function, composite WOMAC index score and VAS (p<0.05). Patient's and
      physician's global evaluation of valdecoxib treatment was very good to good in
      84.1% and 83.6% of cases respectively. The present study has shown that
      valdecoxib, in a dose of 10 mg/day given over 4 weeks, is an effective and safe
      treatment for the signs and symptoms of OA of hip and knee joints.

TI  - The cost effectiveness of rofecoxib and celecoxib in patients with osteoarthritis
      or rheumatoid arthritis.
PG  - 283-92
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of the cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2)
      selective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) rofecoxib compared with
      naproxen and the COX-2 NSAID celecoxib compared with ibuprofen and diclofenac.
      METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis based on a 5-year Markov model. Probability 
      estimates were derived from detailed data of 2 randomized trials and a systematic
      search of the medical literature. Utility estimates were obtained from 60
      randomly selected members of the general public. Cost estimates were obtained
      from Canadian provincial databases. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were
      calculated for patients at average risk of upper gastrointestinal (UGI) events
      and for high-risk patients with a prior history of a UGI event. Subjects were
      patients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) where a decision has
      been made to treat with NSAIDs but who do not require low-dose aspirin. Main
      outcome measures were proportion of patients with clinical or complicated UGI
      events, quality-adjusted life expectancy, and life expectancy. RESULTS:
      Evaluation of rofecoxib versus naproxen in patients with RA at average risk
      resulted in costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of $Can271,188.
      Celecoxib was dominated by diclofenac in average-risk patients. Both rofecoxib
      and celecoxib are cost-effective in high-risk patients. Analyses by age groups
      and assuming a threshold of Can$50,000 per QALY gained, suggest that rofecoxib or
      celecoxib would be cost-effective in patients aged over 76 and 81, respectively, 
      without additional risk factors. CONCLUSION: Both rofecoxib and celecoxib are
      economically attractive in high risk and elderly patients. They are not
      economically attractive in patients at average risk. Coprescription of
      proton-pump inhibitors with COX-2 NSAIDs is not economically attractive for
      patients at high risk.

TI  - An open-label trial of the selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitor, rofecoxib, in
      inflammatory bowel disease-associated peripheral arthritis and arthralgia.
PG  - 1371-80
AB  - BACKGROUND: Conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been
      associated with an increased risk of exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease. 
      AIM: To evaluate, in a prospective, open-label study, the safety and efficacy of 
      a 20-day regimen of the selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitor, rofecoxib, 12.5-25
      mg/day, in inflammatory bowel disease patients with associated peripheral
      arthropathy and/or arthritis. METHODS: Patients with clinically inactive to mild 
      inflammatory bowel disease and a joint pain score of at least two points on a
      scale ranging from zero (none) to four (very poor) were eligible. Response was
      defined by a decrease of at least two points in the arthralgia score. RESULTS: Of
      the 32 patients included, 26 (81%) were treated with rofecoxib, 25 mg/day, and
      six (19%) with rofecoxib, 12.5 mg/day. In three patients (9%), rofecoxib had to
      be withdrawn after a few days due to gastrointestinal complaints which ceased
      immediately after drug discontinuation. No flare of inflammatory bowel disease
      occurred. Thirteen of the 32 patients (41%) were responders and, overall, the
      arthralgia score decreased from two to one (P = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: This is the
      first prospective study on the use of a selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitor in 
      inflammatory bowel disease patients with peripheral arthropathy and/or
      arthralgia. The promising safety and efficacy profile warrants further evaluation
      in controlled trials.

TI  - Effects of rofecoxib or naproxen vs placebo on Alzheimer disease progression: a
      randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 2819-26
AB  - CONTEXT: Laboratory evidence that inflammatory mechanisms contribute to neuronal 
      injury in Alzheimer disease (AD), along with epidemiological evidence, suggests
      that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may favorably influence the
      course of the disease. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether treatment with a selective
      cyclooxygenase (COX) -2 inhibitor (rofecoxib) or a traditional nonselective NSAID
      (naproxen) slows cognitive decline in patients with mild-to-moderate AD. DESIGN: 
      Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial, 
      with 1-year exposure to study medications. SETTING: Forty ambulatory treatment
      centers affiliated with the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study consortium.
      PARTICIPANTS: Participants with mild-to-moderate AD (Mini-Mental State
      Examination score of 13-26) were recruited from December 1999 to November 2000
      using clinic populations, referrals from community physicians, and local
      advertising. Stable use of cholinesterase inhibitors, estrogen, low-dose aspirin,
      and vitamin E was allowed. Participants with inflammatory diseases that might
      respond to the study medications were excluded. Of 474 participants screened, 351
      were enrolled. INTERVENTIONS: Once-daily rofecoxib, 25 mg, or twice-daily
      naproxen sodium, 220 mg, or placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome
      measure was the 1-year change in the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive
      (ADAS-Cog) subscale score. Secondary outcome measures included the Clinical
      Dementia Rating scale sum-of-boxes, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, the Quality
      of Life-AD, and the time to attainment of significant end points (4-point decline
      from baseline ADAS-Cog score, 1-step worsening on the global Clinical Dementia
      Rating scale, 15-point decline on the ADCS activities of daily living inventory, 
      institutionalization, or death). RESULTS: The 1-year mean (SD) change in ADAS-Cog
      scores in participants treated with naproxen (5.8 [8.0]) or rofecoxib (7.6 [7.7])
      was not significantly different from the change in participants treated with
      placebo (5.7 [8.2]). Results of secondary analyses showed no consistent benefit
      of either treatment. Fatigue, dizziness, and hypertension were more commonly
      reported in the active drug groups, and more serious adverse events were found in
      the active treatment group than in the placebo group. CONCLUSION: The results of 
      this study indicate that rofecoxib or low-dose naproxen does not slow cognitive
      decline in patients with mild-to-moderate AD.

TI  - Cyclo-oxygenase 2 inhibitors: emerging roles in the gut.
PG  - 279-91
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Discovery of an isoform of Cyclo-oxygenase (COX) 1, the
      inducible COX-2, has made it possible to avoid some side effects of non-specific 
      COX inhibitors. The COX-2 gene is over-expressed in reflux oesophagitis,
      Barrett's oesophagus, gastric and colon cancer, familial adenomatous polyposis,
      pancreatic cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatotoxicity, cirrhosis, and
      inflammatory bowel disease, and specific COX-2 inhibitors have been tried
      experimentally and clinically and found effective. METHODS: A Medline search was 
      performed of English-language experimental studies and controlled clinical trials
      from January 1980 to January 2002, and relevant citations were noted. RESULTS:
      Review of available literature shows that sulindac and COX-2 inhibitors are
      effective in preventing as well as regressing familial adenomatous polyposis.
      However, they have not been shown to prevent cancer in these patients. Studies
      evaluating NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors in carcinogen-induced and genetically
      manipulated animal models of various cancers have been promising especially in
      conditions such as Barrett's oesophagus, oesophageal and hepatocellular carcinoma
      and pancreatic cancer. COX-2 inhibitors may be of value in the treatment of
      reflux oesophagitis, pancreatitis and hepatitis, although carefully planned
      randomized controlled clinical trials demonstrating their efficacy need to be
      conducted. At present NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors cannot be recommended for
      average-risk individuals or for those with sporadic colorectal neoplasia (or
      other forms of cancers) as chemo-preventive agents. CONCLUSION: COX-2 inhibitors 
      may open up a new therapeutic era in which these drugs can be used for
      chemo-prophylaxis. However, COX-2 selective inhibitors retain renal adverse
      effects of the non-selective inhibitors and the concern regarding the
      pro-thrombotic potential of COX-2 inhibitors will limit their value as
      chemo-preventive agents.

TI  - Motion--Cyclo-oxygenase-2 selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are as
      safe as placebo for the stomach: arguments against the motion.
PG  - 335-8
AB  - Cyclo-oxygenase (COX) exists in two isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2, that direct the
      synthesis of prostaglandins, prostacyclin and thromboxane. Traditional
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit both isoenzymes, resulting 
      in damage to the mucosa of the stomach and duodenum, but also in
      cardioprotection. Selective COX-2 inhibitors are less likely to damage the upper 
      gastrointestinal tract, as has been shown by large, randomized, controlled
      trials. Specifically, the newer agents are superior to ibuprofen and naproxen in 
      this regard, but celecoxib and diclofenac were not significantly different in
      patients who were not also taking low-dose acetylsalicylic acid. These studies
      did not include a placebo arm, however, and controlled comparisons of COX-2
      inhibitors with placebo have not enlisted enough subjects to demonstrate
      conclusively that they are equally safe. Selectivity for the COX-2 isoform
      affords protection against upper gastrointestinal toxicity possibly at the
      expense of the cardioprotective effect of traditional NSAIDs. This might explain 
      the higher rate of nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients who are given
      rofecoxib compared with naproxen. A traditional NSAID, combined with either
      misoprostol or a proton pump inhibitor, is still a suitable alternative to
      selective COX-2 inhibitors for the treatment of arthritis.

AB  - To evaluate the gastrointestinal tolerability of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory
      drugs (NSAIDs) in osteoarthritis patients in Japan, a systematic review of
      Japanese randomized controlled trials was performed. This study consisted of
      double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trials with 4-week NSAID treatment 
      of osteoarthritis patients in Japan. The analysis included 4725 patients from 25 
      trials. On average the cumulative incidences of patients who had experienced any 
      adverse reaction and any adverse digestive reaction were 14.3% [95% confidence
      interval (CI) 13.3%-15.3%] and 10.4% (95% CI 9.4%-11.4%), respectively. The
      cumulative incidence for the upper gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms such as
      abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, and dyspepsia was estimated to be approximately 
      10.9%. When the risk of upper GI symptoms was compared between males and females,
      the summary odds ratio was 1.71 (95% CI 1.11-2.65). Comparing the risk of upper
      GI symptoms between patients 59 years of age and younger and those 60+ years old,
      the summary odds ratio was 1.07 (95% CI 0.75-1.52). Despite the incidence of
      adverse reactions varying across the drugs being used, there was an obvious
      increased risk of GI symptoms.

TI  - Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents in neonates.
PG  - 385-405
AB  - The use of NSAIDs has become routine for adults and children in the management of
      pain. NSAIDs (other than aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid]) are also enjoying
      greater popularity as antipyretics since the recognition of Reye's syndrome's
      putative association with aspirin. In neonates, NSAIDs have been used for many
      years in an attempt to pharmacologically close the ductus arteriosus. This review
      examines the various NSAIDs and their potential and real applications in the
      neonatal population. For completeness, acetaminophen (paracetamol), which has
      weak NSAID activity and is a widely used analgesic and antipyretic in this
      patient group, was also included. The prostaglandin system is important for
      healthy development, and conversely there are unique risks posed by pharmacologic
      interference with this system in the neonatal period. The prostanoid system in
      neonates has the capacity to modulate nociception, but comes at the expense of
      interfering with nearly every organ system. Physiologic effects of inhibition of 
      prostaglandin synthesis applicable to neonates include disruption of the sleep
      cycle, increased risk of pulmonary hypertension, alterations in cerebral blood
      flow, decreased renal function, disrupted thermoregulation, and alterations in
      hemostasis balance, among others. Prostaglandins are also important for the
      normal development of the central nervous, cardiovascular, and renal systems, and
      there is evidence that the proper genesis of these systems may be adversely
      effected by NSAID exposure in utero and in the neonatal period. Gastrointestinal 
      adverse effects have provided the impetus for the development and marketing of
      selective cyclo-oxygenase type 2 (COX-2) inhibitors. These agents' reputation for
      safety in adults may not be applicable to neonates. COX-2 is involved in the
      development of several organ systems, and its inhibition may induce a
      prothrombotic state. The advent of parenteral formulations of cyclo-oxygenase
      inhibitors, including COX-2-selective agents, increases the therapeutic
      flexibility of NSAIDs. However, objective data on the safety of these agents have
      not kept pace with their clinical availability.

TI  - The efficacy of celecoxib premedication on postoperative pain and recovery times 
      after ambulatory surgery: a dose-ranging study.
PG  - 1631-5, table of contents
AB  - Recently, the Food and Drug Administration increased the celecoxib dosage
      recommendation from 200 mg to 400 mg for acute pain management. No studies have
      directly compared the analgesic efficacy of different doses of celecoxib for the 
      prevention of postoperative pain. In this prospective, double-blinded,
      placebo-controlled study, we compared oral celecoxib 200 mg to 400 mg when
      administered for premedication of outpatients undergoing minor ear-nose-throat
      surgery. A total of 93 healthy outpatients were assigned to 1 of 3 study groups: 
      control (placebo; n = 30), celecoxib 200 mg (n = 30), or celecoxib 400 mg (n =
      33). The study drug was given orally 30-45 min before surgery, and all patients
      received a standardized general anesthetic technique. During the postoperative
      period, pain scores (0-10), recovery times, the need for rescue analgesics,
      quality of recovery (0-100), patient satisfaction with pain management (0-100),
      and side effects were recorded. Pain was assessed at 30-min intervals using a
      verbal rating scale, with 0 = no pain to 10 = worst pain imaginable, in the
      postanesthesia care unit and day surgery unit recovery areas and at 24 h after
      surgery. Celecoxib 400 mg was significantly more effective than 200 mg (and
      placebo) in reducing postoperative pain. Both celecoxib 200 mg and 400 mg were
      more effective than placebo in reducing the postoperative fentanyl requirement
      (74 +/- 67 micro g and 56 +/- 62 micro g versus 120 +/- 86 micro g,
      respectively). The larger dose of celecoxib significantly reduced the percentage 
      of patients with severe pain at discharge (6% versus 37% and 30% in the celecoxib
      200 mg and control groups, respectively). The median number of doses of oral
      analgesic medication after discharge was also significantly reduced in the
      celecoxib 400 mg group (0 versus 2 and 2 in the celecoxib 200 mg and control
      groups, respectively). However, no differences were found among the three study
      groups with respect to recovery times and secondary outcome variables (e.g.,
      patient satisfaction and quality of recovery). We conclude that oral
      premedication with celecoxib 400 mg was more effective than 200 mg in reducing
      severe postoperative pain and the need for rescue analgesic medication in the
      postoperative period. IMPLICATIONS: Oral premedication with celecoxib 400 mg was 
      more effective than 200 mg in reducing postoperative pain and the need for rescue
      analgesic medication in the early postoperative period. However, neither dose of 
      celecoxib was more effective than a placebo in facilitating the recovery process 
      after outpatient surgery.

TI  - The cost-effectiveness of cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors in the management
      of chronic arthritis.
PG  - 795-806
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rofecoxib and celecoxib (coxibs) effectively treat chronic arthritis 
      pain and reduce ulcer complications by 50% compared with nonselective
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). However, their absolute risk
      reduction is small and the cost-effectiveness of treatment is uncertain.
      OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the degree of risk reduction in gastrointestinal 
      complications by coxibs offsets their increased cost compared with a generic
      nonselective NSAID. DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis. DATA SOURCES: Systematic
      review of MEDLINE and published abstracts. TARGET POPULATION: Patients with
      osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis who are not taking aspirin and who require
      long-term NSAID therapy for moderate to severe arthritis pain. PERSPECTIVE:
      Third-party payer. INTERVENTIONS: Naproxen, 500 mg twice daily, and coxib, once
      daily. Patients intolerant of naproxen were switched to a coxib. TIME HORIZON:
      Lifetime. OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year
      (QALY) gained. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Using a coxib instead of a
      nonselective NSAID in average-risk patients cost an incremental 275 809 dollars
      per year to gain 1 additional QALY. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: The
      incremental cost per QALY gained decreased to 55 803 dollars when the analysis
      was limited to the subset of patients with a history of bleeding ulcers. The
      coxib strategy became dominant when the cost of coxibs was reduced by 90% of the 
      current average wholesale price. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, if a
      third-party payer was willing to pay 150 000 dollars per QALY gained, then 4.3%
      of average-risk patients would fall within the budget. CONCLUSIONS: The risk
      reduction seen with coxibs does not offset their increased costs compared with
      nonselective NSAIDs in the management of average-risk patients with chronic
      arthritis. However, coxibs may provide an acceptable incremental
      cost-effectiveness ratio in the subgroup of patients with a history of bleeding
      ulcers.

TI  - Menorrhagia: an update.
PG  - 405-22
AB  - Menorrhagia is defined as a 'complaint of heavy cyclical menstrual bleeding
      occurring over several consecutive cycles'. Objectively it is a total menstrual
      blood loss equal to or greater than 80 ml per menstruation. It is estimated that 
      approximately 30% of women complain of menorrhagia. Excessive bleeding is the
      main presenting complaint in women referred to gynecologists and it accounts for 
      two-thirds of all hysterectomies, and most of endoscopic endometrial destructive 
      surgery. Thus, menorrhagia is an important healthcare problem. Its etiology,
      investigation, medical and surgical management are described. In approximately
      50% of cases of menorrhagia no pathology is found at hysterectomy. Abnormal
      levels of prostaglandins or the fibrinolytic system in the endometrium have been 
      implicated. Effective medical treatments suitable for long-term use include
      intrauterine progestogens, antifibrinolytic agents (tranexamic acid) and
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (mefenamic acid). Over the past decade
      there has been increasing use of endometrial destructive techniques as an
      alternative to hysterectomy. Their further refinement and the advent of fibroid
      embolization has increased the options available to women.

TI  - The COX-2 selective inhibitor, valdecoxib, does not impair platelet function in
      the elderly: results of a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 504-13
AB  - The effects of the new cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 selective inhibitor, valdecoxib (40
      mg bid; n = 17), on platelet function were evaluated, along with ibuprofen (800
      mg tid; n = 15) and placebo (n = 15), in healthy elderly subjects (65-85 years)
      in this 7.5-day, randomized, single-center, double-blind study. Platelet
      aggregation (to sodium arachidonate, collagen, and adenosine diphosphate),
      bleeding time, and serum thromboxane B2 (TxB2) concentrations were measured up to
      8 hours postdose on Days 1 and 8. Valdecoxib had no platelet effects, while
      ibuprofen significantly decreased platelet aggregation, significantly increased
      bleeding time (2-4 h postdose on each day), and significantly decreased TxB2
      levels at all time points. In conclusion, unlike ibuprofen, valdecoxib 40 mg bid 
      spares platelet COX-1 function in healthy elderly subjects. Valdecoxib's lack of 
      effect on platelet aggregation and bleeding time suggests that it will have an
      improved clinical profile over nonselective NSAIDs, particularly in patients for 
      whom bleeding complications are a concern.

TI  - Point: From animal models to prevention of colon cancer. Systematic review of
      chemoprevention in min mice and choice of the model system.
PG  - 391-400
AB  - The Apc(Min/+) mouse model and the azoxymethane (AOM) rat model are the main
      animal models used to study the effect of dietary agents on colorectal cancer. We
      reviewed recently the potency of chemopreventive agents in the AOM rat model (D. 
      E. Corpet and S. Tache, Nutr. Cancer, 43: 1-21, 2002). Here we add the results of
      a systematic review of the effect of dietary and chemopreventive agents on the
      tumor yield in Min mice. The review is based on the results of 179 studies from
      71 articles and is displayed also on the internet http://corpet.net/min.(2) We
      compared the efficacy of agents in the Min mouse model and the AOM rat model, and
      found that they were correlated (r = 0.66; P < 0.001), although some agents that 
      afford strong protection in the AOM rat and the Min mouse small bowel increase
      the tumor yield in the large bowel of mutant mice. The agents included piroxicam,
      sulindac, celecoxib, difluoromethylornithine, and polyethylene glycol. The reason
      for this discrepancy is not known. We also compare the results of rodent studies 
      with those of clinical intervention studies of polyp recurrence. We found that
      the effect of most of the agents tested was consistent across the animal and
      clinical models. Our point is thus: rodent models can provide guidance in the
      selection of prevention approaches to human colon cancer, in particular they
      suggest that polyethylene glycol, hesperidin, protease inhibitor, sphingomyelin, 
      physical exercise, epidermal growth factor receptor kinase inhibitor,
      (+)-catechin, resveratrol, fish oil, curcumin, caffeate, and thiosulfonate are
      likely important preventive agents.

TI  - A model analysis of costs of blood pressure destabilization and edema associated 
      with rofecoxib and celecoxib among older patients with osteoarthritis and
      hypertension in a Medicare Choice population.
PG  - 647-62
AB  - BACKGROUND: Economic analyses consider all costs relevant to the use of a
      particular treatment or treatments. Recently, head-to-head, randomized,
      controlled trials have shown a significantly higher incidence of blood pressure
      (BP) destabilization and clinically significant edema with rofecoxib than with
      celecoxib among older, hypertensive patients with osteoarthritis (OA). OBJECTIVE:
      The objective of this analysis was to estimate the COX-2 specific inhibitor
      medication costs, in addition to the costs of drugs and physicians' fees, for BP 
      destabilization and clinically significant edema associated with the use of
      rofecoxib 25 mg QD and celecoxib 200 mg QD in patients with OA and hypertension
      in a Medicare Choice population (aged > or = 65 years). METHODS: A decision
      analysis model was constructed to determine the costs (from the payer's
      perspective) of treating patients in this population with either of the 2
      regimens for 6 weeks. The analysis used pooled data from 2 recent, independently 
      conducted, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trials of OA
      patients aged > or = 65 years with treated hypertension who received either
      celecoxib 200 mg QD or rofecoxib 25 mg QD for 6 weeks. In the individual trials, 
      rofecoxib was associated with significantly higher rates of destabilized BP (P < 
      0.032 and P < 0.001) and edema (P < 0.01 and P = 0.045) than celecoxib. RESULTS: 
      For a 100,000-member Medicare Choice population, an estimated 25,630 persons
      would have OA and hypertension (stages I-III), and an estimated 5126 of these
      patients would use celecoxib or rofecoxib. The estimated costs were 33,938
      dollars (6.2%) higher if all hypertensive patients with OA were treated with
      rofecoxib rather than celecoxib for 6 weeks. The cost per day of use was 0.16
      dollars less with celecoxib, and per-patient, per-month costs were 4.79 dollars
      lower. CONCLUSION: Celecoxib was a less costly treatment option than rofecoxib
      among OA patients with hypertension aged > or = 65 years, based on our model of
      the direct costs of COX-2 specific inhibitor therapy combined with those
      associated with physician monitoring and treatment of edema and BP
      destabilization.

TI  - Rofecoxib exerts no effect on platelet plug formation in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 229-31
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although rofecoxib has very high selectivity for cyclo-oxygenase 2
      (COX-2), supratherapeutic rofecoxib concentrations (> 1000 mg) inhibit purified
      human COX-1 in vitro and TXB2 formation in vivo. It is therefore possible that
      higher doses of rofecoxib may affect platelet function. This could be important
      if rofecoxib is given to thrombocytopenic patients. In these cases, already
      moderate inhibition of platelet function could precipitate bleeding
      complications. We therefore set out to investigate the influence of rofecoxib on 
      platelet function in healthy volunteers. METHODS: We set up a
      balanced-randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two way cross-over study. 
      Peripheral blood was withdrawn from 42 healthy volunteers before and 3 hours
      after intake of 50, 250, 500 mg of rofecoxib or placebo (n = 14 per group).
      Platelet function was assessed by a platelet function analyzer (PFA-100) which
      measures collagen-epinephrine induced closure time (CEPI-CT) under shear stress. 
      RESULTS: CEPI-CT increased by 14% (p = 0.002) and 11% (p = 0.003) three hours
      after intake of placebo and rofecoxib at dosages of up to 500 mg, respectively.
      The increase in CEPI-CT versus baseline was not significantly different in the
      placebo period compared with the active treatment periods (n = 42, p > 0.05).
      CONCLUSIONS: Rofecoxib does not impair platelet function. Thus, rofecoxib appears
      to be a valuable analgetic and antipyretic agent in the therapy of patients at
      risk for bleeding.

TI  - Prior ibuprofen exposure does not augment opioid drug potency or modify opioid
      requirements for pain inhibition in total hip surgery.
PG  - 445-9
AB  - PURPOSE: In previous animal studies, a prior exposure to non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) augmented opioid drug potency. This study was
      designed to answer the question whether a similar effect can be attained in man. 
      The objective was to use NSAID for preoperative pain reduction and at the same
      time use the NSAID exposure to reduce opioid requirements for pain inhibition in 
      major orthopedic surgery. METHODS: In this double-blind, randomized study, 50
      patients scheduled for total hip surgery were included. Patients of Group I
      received a placebo drug three times a day two weeks before surgery, and those
      allocated to Group II received ibuprofen (600 mg) three times a day. For surgical
      anesthesia, all patients received intrathecal bupivacaine 20 mg plus 0.1 mg
      morphine in a total volume of 4 mL. RESULTS: The preoperative or postoperative
      visual analogue scale pain scores or the amount of iv morphine showed no
      differences between the two groups in the first 24 hr after surgery. The median
      total blood loss in the ibuprofen group was 1161 mL vs 796 mL in the placebo
      group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Pretreatment with ibuprofen before major hip
      surgery does not improve the pain scores or reduce morphine requirement but
      significantly increases blood loss. Considering the presence of relevant adverse 
      effects, pretreatment with a non-selective NSAID is not recommended.

TI  - The effect of postsurgical administration of a selective cyclo-oxygenase-2
      inhibitor on the healing of intrabony defects following treatment with enamel
      matrix proteins.
PG  - 108-12
AB  - Regenerative treatment with enamel matrix proteins (EMD) has been shown to
      promote regeneration in intrabony periodontal defects. However, up to now various
      postoperative regimens such as the routine administration of nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were often used in combination with enamel
      matrix proteins. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that the results might have
      been influenced by the effect of the postoperative medication. The aim of this
      randomized, controlled, blinded, clinical investigation was to determine the
      effect of postsurgical administration of a selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitor 
      on the healing of intrabony periodontal defects following regenerative
      periodontal surgery with EMD. Twenty two patients, each of whom exhibited one
      deep intrabony defect, were randomly treated with either EMD plus a selective
      cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor (test) or with EMD alone (control). The
      postoperative regimen consisted of oral administration of 12.5 mg rofecoxib twice
      daily for 14 days. The following parameters were recorded at baseline and at 6
      months by the same calibrated and blinded investigator: plaque index (Pl),
      gingival index (GI), bleeding on probing (BOP), pocket depth (PD), gingival
      recession (GR), and clinical attachment level (CAL). Power analysis to determine 
      superiority of the anti-inflammatory treatment showed that the available sample
      size would yield 70% power to detect a 1 mm difference. No statistical
      significant differences in any of the investigated parameters between the two
      groups were observed at baseline. The results show that, in the test group, mean 
      PD decreased from 8.7+/-1.4 mm to 4.7+/-2.0 mm (P<0.001) and mean CAL from
      9.7+/-2.0 mm to 6.5+/-2.1 mm (P<0.001). In the control group, mean PD decreased
      from 8.6+/-1.6 mm to 4.7+/-1.8 mm (P<0.001) and mean CAL from 9.5+/-1.6 mm to
      6.5+/-2.2 mm (P<0.001). There were no significant differences between the two
      groups in any of the investigated parameters. Within the limits of the present
      study, it can be concluded that the systemic administration of a selective COX-2 
      inhibitor following regenerative periodontal surgery with EMD did not result in
      additional clinical improvements when compared to treatment with EMD alone.

TI  - Disease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapy for spondyloarthropathies: advances 
      in treatment.
PG  - 205-12
AB  - The inflammatory arthritides included in the category of spondyloarthropathy
      (ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis,
      undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy, and arthritis associated with inflammatory 
      bowel disease) may cause significant, progressive morbidity. Therapy with
      nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and traditionally used disease-modifying
      antirheumatic drugs, such as methotrexate, often fails in patients with more
      severe peripheral arthropathy and axial involvement, and alternative treatment
      options have been limited. With increased understanding of the pathologic
      processes involved in these disorders, new therapeutics have arisen and are being
      investigated in the various subtypes of spondyloarthropathy. This article reviews
      recent progress in disease-modifying therapy for spondyloarthropathy, including
      new biologic response modifiers, such as the tumor necrosis factor-alpha
      inhibitors etanercept and infliximab.

TI  - Chemoprevention of colorectal cancer: slow, steady progress.
PG  - 346-50
AB  - In population-based observational studies, people had lower rates of colorectal
      cancer if they were taking various agents, including nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs, calcium, and folate. In placebo-controlled trials in
      patients with familial adenomatous polyposis and in patients with sporadic colon 
      adenomas, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs reduced the rates of adenomas, and
      there is a biologic rationale that they would be effective in reducing colorectal
      cancer as well. Randomized trials of chemopreventive agents are underway in the
      general population.

TI  - Modelling therapeutic strategies in the treatment of osteoarthritis: an economic 
      evaluation of meloxicam versus diclofenac and piroxicam.
PG  - 443-54
AB  - Objective: To assess the economic efficiency of meloxicam, a cyclo-oxygenase
      (COX)-2 selective inhibitor, versus diclofenac and piroxicam in the UK for the
      treatment of patients with osteoarthritis and the impact on the NHS budget of
      substituting nonselective NSAIDs with meloxicam. Methods and perspective: A
      decision analytical model was used to compare the effects of 4 weeks' treatment
      of osteoarthritis with meloxicam (7.5 mg/day), diclofenac (100 mg/day) and
      piroxicam (20 mg/day). The decision tree was derived by combining best practice
      and clinical reality. Analysis was from the NHS perspective. The study considered
      only the direct costs. These included costs for drug acquisition and management
      of all adverse events, both serious gastrointestinal events requiring
      hospitalisation, and non-serious events that required maintenance. Resource use
      and treatment costs were obtained from local and published sources. A range of
      sensitivity analyses was carried out. Results: Based on two 4-week large-scale
      trials, the Meloxicam Large-scale International Study Safety Assessment (MELISSA)
      and Safety and Efficacy Large-scale Evaluation of COX-inhibiting Therapies
      (SELECT) trials, and a decision analytical model, the findings suggested that
      meloxicam had the lowest cost per patient ( pound 30 versus pound 35 for
      piroxicam and pound 51 for diclofenac [costs presented as 1998 values except for 
      drug costs which were in 2000 values]). The results of the Monte Carlo
      probabilistic sensitivity analysis, using 4000 samples, suggested that meloxicam 
      was the optimal strategy in the drug treatment of patients with osteoarthritis
      compared with nonselective NSAIDs both individually and as a group. The cost
      savings were due to lower levels of serious adverse events accompanied by fewer
      days in intensive care units and shorter overall duration of hospital stay
      observed with meloxicam compared with diclofenac and piroxicam in the 4-week
      trials. Conclusions: Based on the 4-week trial period, meloxicam was predicted to
      be the lowest cost drug therapy, and thus the optimal drug therapy, in the
      management of patients with osteoarthritis compared with nonselective NSAIDs such
      as diclofenac and piroxicam. Applying the cost savings per patient derived from
      the model, switching patients from piroxicam and diclofenac to meloxicam would
      indicate a cost saving of over pound 25 million per annum. Models such as this
      can facilitate better clinical guidance and is a useful way of assessing
      treatment outcomes.

TI  - Prevention and treatment of reactions to NSAIDs.
PG  - 189-98
AB  - Avoidance of ASA and other NSAIDs prevents the reactions and careful attention to
      clinical history along with patient education are important. However, blanket
      advice to avoid all NSAIDs is no longer reasonable. Except for AERD and chronic
      urticaria, cross-reactivity with other NSAIDs does not occur. A physician can
      definitively prove this by giving the patient another NSAID in their office and
      observing no reaction. Furthermore, for patients with AERD and chronic urticaria,
      they can be given the new selective COX-2 inhibitors (rofecoxib and celecoxib)
      without any cross-reactivity. All AERD patients can be desensitized to ASA and
      treated with ASA indefinitely. However, ASA desensitization in chronic urticaria 
      is not possible. Underlying mild and moderate AERD responds well to topical and
      systemic corticosteroids and leukotriene modifiers. However, the severe forms of 
      the disease should be desensitized to ASA and treated with this drug on a long
      term basis. In the future, new drugs that prevent eosinophil activation and
      chemotaxis or enhance eosinophil apoptosis are likely to be useful. Specific
      blockers of the second cystLT receptor would also be useful. Ultimately as the
      genetics of these heterogeneous disorders are unraveled, gene substitution
      therapy may be the ultimate answer.

TI  - Indomethacin versus meloxicam for prevention of heterotopic ossification after
      total hip arthroplasty.
PG  - 91-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heterotopic ossification (HO) is a recognized postsurgical
      complication after total hip arthroplasty. Brooker et al. [6] established a
      grading system to define the degree of HO. The results of several studies have
      shown that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) and radiation therapy
      reliably reduce the occurrence of severe HO. The exact cause and mechanism of
      bone formation are not known. The efficacy of indomethacin versus meloxicam for
      the prevention of heterotopic periarticular ossification and clinical NSAID
      side-effects after primary, cementless total hip arthroplasty was evaluated.
      METHODS: Probands underwent cementless total hip replacements at the Orthopaedic 
      Department, Hospital Wiener Neustadt, from January 1997 to January 1998, did not 
      take NSAID up to 4 weeks preoperatively and had no NSAID contraindications.
      Patients were separated into two groups by different hospitalisation floors. All 
      patients selected for this study suffered from primary or secondary coxarthrosis.
      Data were collected as a prospective, randomised, parallel group study. Patients 
      were given 50 mg indomethacin 2 times daily ( n=58) vs 7.5 mg meloxicam ( n=58)
      in a 12-day treatment course. RESULTS: A two-sided Cochran-Armitage trend test
      showed no statistically significant difference ( p<0.05) for one of the drugs
      regarding influence on ectopic bone formation according to the grading system of 
      Brooker et al. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that there is no statistically 
      significant trend that indomethacin or meloxicam protects a hip arthroplasty
      better from heterotopic bone formation. We prefer indomethacin therapy because it
      is almost half the price of meloxicam therapy, and we recommend indomethacin in a
      12-day treatment course given 50 mg 2 times daily as an effective, inexpensive
      and easily administered HO prophylaxis.

TI  - Effects of selective COX-2 inhibitors on the gastric permeability of sucrose: a
      controlled study with placebo and ibuprofen.
PG  - 403-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Acute and chronic use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can
      increase gastrointestinal permeability. Celecoxib, which selectively inhibits the
      enzyme cyclooxygenase-2, is a novel anti-inflammatory drug with minimal
      gastrointestinal toxic effects while retaining anti-inflammatory efficacy. Our
      aim was to assess the potential effects of celecoxib on gastric permeability in
      comparison with placebo and ibuprofen. DESIGN: We conducted a prospective,
      double-blind, cross-over study. SETTING: This study is carried out at Marmara
      University Hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-five healthy subjects entered the study
      but 19 subjects completed the treatment. INTERVENTION: Subjects were randomized
      to celecoxib 100 mg twice daily, ibuprofen 600 mg twice daily or placebo for 7
      days in pre-defined sequences. Treatments were separated by a 7 day washout
      period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Gastric permeability was assessed by measuring
      urinary excretion of sucrose spectrophotometrically. RESULTS: Ibuprofen 600 mg
      twice daily produced greater increases in gastric permeability compared with
      placebo or celecoxib (geometric mean of urinary sucrose recovery was 59.15, 32.65
      and 33.11 mg/h for ibuprofen, placebo and celecoxib, respectively) (P < 0.001).
      Celecoxib was generally better tolerated than ibuprofen. CONCLUSIONS: When
      compared with ibuprofen, celecoxib 100 mg twice daily has no significant effect
      on gastric mucosa in healthy subjects.

TI  - The cost-effectiveness of acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and selective COX-2 inhibitors
      in the treatment of symptomatic knee osteoarthritis.
PG  - 144-57
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to conduct an economic evaluation of
      rofecoxib and celecoxib compared with high-dose acetaminophen or ibuprofen with
      and without misoprostol for patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (OA).
      METHODS: A decision analysis model was designed over 6 months using two measures 
      of effectiveness: 1) number of upper gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events
      averted; and 2) number of patients who achieved perceptible pain relief. Separate
      analyses were conducted for all patients and for those who did not respond to
      acetaminophen. Outcome probabilities were obtained from a comprehensive review of
      randomized controlled trials and observational studies. Costs were derived from
      actual resource utilization of OA patients. RESULTS: In terms of averting GI
      events, acetaminophen dominates the other options for an average risk patient
      population. For patients who did not respond to acetaminophen, rofecoxib had the 
      lowest incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per GI event avoided (32,000
      US dollars) relative to ibuprofen. In terms of pain control, ibuprofen had an
      ICER of 610.77 US dollars per additional patient achieving minimal perceptible
      clinical improvement (MPCI) relative to acetaminophen, while rofecoxib had an
      ICER of 12,000 US dollars relative to ibuprofen. For patients who did not respond
      to acetaminophen and who are at high risk of developing an adverse GI event,
      rofecoxib dominates ibuprofen as the preferred alternative for both measures of
      effectiveness. One-way, two-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses
      established that these results were generally robust. CONCLUSIONS: Our results
      suggest that for average-risk knee OA patients, acetaminophen dominates the other
      therapies in terms of cost per GI event averted. In terms of pain relief,
      cost-effectiveness acceptability curves indicate that if one values pain relief
      below 275 US dollars per patient achieving MPCI, acetaminophen is the therapy
      most likely to be optimal; between 275 US dollars and 14,150 US dollars,
      ibuprofen is most likely to be optimal; and above 14,150 US dollars, rofecoxib is
      most likely to be optimal.

TI  - Effect of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors on blood pressure.
PG  - 442-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors (CSIs)
      on blood pressure. DATA SOURCES: Clinical literature accessed through MEDLINE
      (1966-May 2002). Key search terms included COX-2 selective inhibitors;
      anti-inflammatory agents, nonsteroidal; celecoxib; rofecoxib; and hypertension.
      DATA SYNTHESIS: Data from prospective studies on the effects of CSIs on blood
      pressure are conflicting. Several studies have reported increased blood pressure 
      as an adverse effect of CSIs. CONCLUSIONS: Additional studies are needed to
      evaluate the effects of CSIs on blood pressure. CSIs should be used with caution 
      in hypertensive patients and blood pressure monitored closely if a CSI is
      indicated.

TI  - Testing for interaction in studies of noninferiority.
PG  - 103-15
AB  - We consider the role of interaction tests in the context of active-controlled
      clinical trials that aim to demonstrate the noninferiority of an experimental
      treatment compared to a standard (control) treatment. When the subjects can be
      grouped into strata (e.g., study sites, gender, race, etc.), there may be a
      desire to determine whether the experimental treatment is noninferior to the
      standard in each of the strata. We present five possible analysis strategies to
      test for heterogeneity of relative treatment effects among strata. These
      strategies are either identical to or straightforward modifications of strategies
      that can be used to test for interaction when the objective of the study is to
      show differences rather than noninferiority. The various analysis strategies
      implicitly depend on different definitions of interaction. Power of the various
      tests will be low, a phenomenon that often occurs when testing for interaction.
      We present simulation results to quantify the power and type I error rates under 
      different scenarios and an example to demonstrate the proposed tests. None of the
      analysis strategies is best under every parameter configuration. The tests may be
      best used in a descriptive or exploratory manner. Extensions to two-sided
      equivalence testing are also discussed.

TI  - The difficulties of ambulatory interscalene and intra-articular infusions for
      rotator cuff surgery: a preliminary report.
PG  - 265-9
AB  - PURPOSE: Rotator cuff repair may result in severe postoperative pain. We compared
      a continuous intra-articular infusion to a continuous interscalene block with
      ropivacaine for patients undergoing outpatient rotator cuff repair. METHODS:
      Seventeen patients were randomized to one of two groups: 1) interscalene block
      with 0.5% ropivacaine (40 mL) followed by a postoperative intra-articular
      infusion or; 2) interscalene block with 0.5% ropivacaine (40 mL) followed by a
      postoperative continuous interscalene infusion. Infusions were 0.2% ropivacaine
      at 10 mL x hr(-1) for both groups. Infusions were maintained for 48 hr. Patients 
      were discharged on the day of surgery. Verbal analogue pain scores (VAS) and
      postoperative oxycodone consumption were measured for 48 hr. RESULTS: Eight
      patients (47%; four in each group) had side effects or logistical problems
      complicating care. The mean VAS scores at rest and with movement in the
      postanesthesia care unit and at 12 hr, 24 hr, and 48 hr were not different (P >
      0.1). Inadequate analgesia was reported in 50-75% of all study patients. Time
      until first oxycodone use was similar between groups 829 min +/- 432
      (interscalene) and 999 min +/- 823 (intra-articular; P = 0.6). Total oxycodone
      consumption was also similar 49 mg +/- 48 and 59 mg +/- 51 (P = 0.7),
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the difficulties of ambulatory
      interscalene and intra-articular infusion for rotator cuff surgery. The high VAS 
      scores and need for additional medical care suggest that intra-articular
      administration may not be reasonable for this magnitude of surgery. Further
      refinement of the perineural local anesthetic infusion is necessary to
      consistently provide analgesia after ambulatory rotator cuff surgery.

TI  - Effect of selective cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors and naproxen on short-term risk
      of acute myocardial infarction in the elderly.
PG  - 481-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent debate has emerged regarding the cardiovascular safety of
      selective cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors and the possible cardioprotective effect of
      naproxen sodium. We compared the rates of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) among
      elderly patients dispensed selective cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors, naproxen, and
      nonselective nonnaproxen nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). METHODS: 
      We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study using administrative
      health care data from Ontario, Canada, from April 1, 1998, to March 31, 2001. We 
      identified NSAID-naive cohorts of subjects aged 66 years and older in whom
      treatment was initiated with celecoxib (n = 15 271), rofecoxib (n = 12 156),
      naproxen (n = 5669), and nonnaproxen nonselective NSAIDs (n = 33 868), along with
      a randomly selected control cohort not exposed to NSAIDs (n = 100 000).
      Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare AMI rates
      between study drug groups while controlling for potential confounders. RESULTS:
      Relative to control subjects, the multivariate model showed no significant
      differences in AMI risk for new users of celecoxib (adjusted rate ratio [aRR],
      0.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7-1.2), rofecoxib (aRR, 1.0; 95% CI,
      0.8-1.4), naproxen (aRR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.6-1.7), or nonnaproxen nonselective
      NSAIDs (aRR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.9-1.4). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this
      observational study suggest no increase in the short-term risk of AMI among users
      of selective cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors as commonly used in clinical practice.
      Furthermore, the findings do not support a short-term reduced risk of AMI with
      naproxen.

TI  - Safety profile of rofecoxib as used in general practice in England: results of a 
      prescription-event monitoring study.
PG  - 166-74
AB  - AIMS: A postmarketing Prescription-Event Monitoring study was undertaken to
      monitor the safety of rofecoxib, a cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 selective inhibitor
      prescribed in primary care in England. METHODS: Questionnaires requesting
      clinical event data were sent to prescribing physicians between February and
      November 2000, and the data analysed for all events. RESULTS: There were 15,268
      patients identified, mean age 62 years, 67% female. The commonest specified
      indication was osteoarthritis (24%). Dyspepsia and nausea were the most
      frequently reported adverse events. A history of dyspeptic or upper
      gastrointestinal (GI) conditions, recent use of other nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), use of selected concomitant gastroirritant
      drugs (NSAIDs, aspirin, anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs), or gastroprotective 
      drugs (misoprostol, antacids, proton-pump inhibitors, histamine-2 antagonists),
      and age (>/= 65 years) modified the risk of having minor GI events. During
      treatment or within 1 month of stopping, 110 serious GI events were reported
      (including 76 upper GI bleeds/peptic ulcers, one perforated colon), 101
      thromboembolic events, three reports of acute renal failure, one each of
      Stevens-Johnson syndrome, severe anaphylaxis and angio-oedema. CONCLUSIONS:
      Doctors should continue to prescribe NSAIDs including COX-2 selective inhibitors 
      with caution.

TI  - Review article: NSAIDs, gastroprotection and cyclo-oxygenase-II-selective
      inhibitors.
PG  - 321-32
AB  - In patients at high risk of NSAID-associated serious upper gastrointestinal
      complications, gastroprotection with misoprostol or a proton pump inhibitor
      should be considered. Only misoprostol, 800 micro g/day, has been shown to reduce
      serious upper gastrointestinal complications in a large clinical outcome trial.
      The benefit of Helicobacter pylori eradication in reducing NSAID-associated
      gastrointestinal toxicity is controversial, and routine testing for and
      eradication of H. pylori in NSAID users are not currently advised. The
      gastrointestinal safety of rofecoxib and celecoxib has been assessed in large
      clinical outcome trials which, on first analysis, show benefits over
      non-selective NSAIDs in the incidence of serious upper gastrointestinal
      complications. However, longer term gastrointestinal data from the celecoxib
      study (CLASS) and cardiovascular adverse event data from the rofecoxib study
      (VIGOR) have questioned the risk-benefit profile of these new drugs and, until
      they are better understood, it seems sensible not to use them routinely in large 
      numbers of individuals. The gastrointestinal safety of meloxicam and etodolac has
      not been adequately assessed in such trials. Therefore, evidence for their use
      instead of non-selective NSAIDs, or instead of celecoxib or rofecoxib, is not
      robust.

TI  - Serious lower gastrointestinal clinical events with nonselective NSAID or coxib
      use.
PG  - 288-92
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Epidemiologic studies suggest nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs (NSAIDs) increase the risk for lower gastrointestinal (GI) clinical events,
      but data from prospective trials are lacking. Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-selective
      inhibitors decrease upper GI clinical events but the effect on lower GI events
      has not been determined. We performed a post hoc analysis of serious lower GI
      clinical events with a nonselective NSAID and a COX-2-selective agent in a
      prospective, double-blind, randomized GI outcomes trial. METHODS: A total of 8076
      rheumatoid arthritis patients 50 years or older (or 40 years or older on
      corticosteroid therapy) expected to require NSAIDs for 1 year or greater were
      randomly assigned to naproxen 500 mg twice daily or rofecoxib 50 mg daily. The
      rate of serious lower GI clinical events, defined as bleeding with a 2 g/dL drop 
      in hemoglobin or hospitalization, or hospitalization for perforation,
      obstruction, ulceration, or diverticulitis, was determined. RESULTS: The rate of 
      serious lower GI events per 100 patient-years was 0.41 for rofecoxib and 0.89 for
      naproxen (relative risk, 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22-0.93; P =
      0.032). Serious lower GI events accounted for 39.4% of all serious GI events
      (complicated upper GI event or lower GI event) among patients taking naproxen and
      42.7% among those taking rofecoxib. CONCLUSIONS: Serious lower GI events occurred
      at a rate of 0.9% per year in rheumatoid arthritis patients taking the
      nonselective NSAID naproxen, accounting for nearly 40% of the serious GI events
      that developed in these patients. Serious lower GI events were 54% lower with the
      use of the selective COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib.

PG  - 611-4
AB  - We performed a randomized, prospective study on the prophylaxis of heterotopic
      ossification (HO) after total hip arthroplasty (THR), comparing indomethacin and 
      the selective COX-2 inhibitor meloxicam. From the day after surgery, 272 patients
      were treated with 7.5 mg meloxicam, 15 mg meloxicam, or 2 x 50 mg indomethacin a 
      day, for 14 days. After 6 months, radiographs of patients treated with 7.5 mg
      meloxicam showed that HO had occurred in one third. This treatment was therefore 
      stopped after 26 patients have been assigned to this group. According to the
      intention-to-treat principle, patients given 15 mg meloxicam developed HO in 25% 
      (20% Brooker grade I, 4% grade II and 1% grade III) and those given indomethacin

TI  - Selective COX-2 inhibition improves endothelial function in coronary artery
      disease.
PG  - 405-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is an ongoing debate as to whether the gastrointestinal safety 
      of COX-2 inhibition compared with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
      may come at the cost of increased cardiovascular events. In view of the large
      number of patients at cardiovascular risk requiring chronic analgesic therapy
      with COX-2 inhibitors for arthritic and other inflammatory conditions, the
      effects of selective COX-2 inhibition on clinically useful surrogates for
      cardiovascular disease, particularly endothelial function, need to be determined.
      METHODS AND RESULTS: Fourteen male patients (mean age, 66+/-3 years) with severe 
      coronary artery disease (average of 2.6 vessels with stenosis >75%) undergoing
      stable background therapy with aspirin and statins were included. The patients
      received celecoxib (200 mg BID) or placebo for a duration of 2 weeks in a
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover fashion. After each treatment period,
      flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery, high-sensitivity C-reactive
      protein, oxidized LDL, and prostaglandins were measured. Celecoxib significantly 
      improved endothelium-dependent vasodilation compared with placebo (3.3+/-0.4%
      versus 2.0+/-0.5%, P=0.026), whereas endothelium-independent vasodilation, as
      assessed by nitroglycerin, remained unchanged (9.0+/-1.6% versus 9.5+/-1.3%,
      P=0.75). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein was significantly lower after
      celecoxib (1.3+/-0.4 mg/L) than after placebo (1.8+/-0.5 mg/L, P=0.019), as was
      oxidized LDL (43.6+/-2.4 versus 47.6+/-2.6 U/L, P=0.028), whereas prostaglandins 
      did not change. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate that
      selective COX-2 inhibition improves endothelium-dependent vasodilation and
      reduces low-grade chronic inflammation and oxidative stress in coronary artery
      disease. Thus, selective COX-2 inhibition holds the potential to beneficially
      impact outcome in patients with cardiovascular disease.

TI  - Effectiveness of prophylactic use of rofecoxib in comparison with ibuprofen on
      postendodontic pain.
PG  - 62-4
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine if prophylactic rofecoxib would
      significantly reduce postendodontic pain, when compared with ibuprofen or
      placebo. An additional objective was to establish if any relationship exists
      between periapical diagnosis and the need for additional medication after
      completion of pulpectomy. A total of 45 patients consented to a double-blind,
      single-dose oral administration of 50 mg of rofecoxib, 600 mg of ibuprofen, or a 
      placebo before conventional root canal therapy. The root canal treatment was
      performed in two appointments. Patient-reported visual analog scale ratings of
      pain intensity were conducted upon initial clinical presentation and at 4, 8, 12,
      24, 48, and 72 h after completion of pulpectomy. Results showed that at the 4-
      and 8-h periods, both rofecoxib and ibuprofen provided significantly better pain 
      relief than placebo. At the 12- and 24-h periods, rofecoxib demonstrated
      significantly better pain relief than both ibuprofen and placebo. Patients with a
      periapical diagnosis of acute apical periodontitis showed a significantly
      increased need for additional medication after completion of pulpectomy compared 
      with all other periapical diagnoses.

TI  - Population pharmacokinetic analysis of meloxicam in rheumatoid arthritis
      patients.
PG  - 32-8
AB  - AIM: To perform a nonlinear mixed effect modelling (NONMEM) population
      pharmacokinetic analysis of meloxicam plasma concentrations in rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA) patients participating in three clinical trials, and to evaluate
      the effects of age, weight, gender and concomitant medications on meloxicam
      pharmacokinetics. METHODS: Meloxicam was administered to RA patients once daily
      for 3 weeks or 6 months at doses between 7.5 and 60 mg. Plasma samples were
      obtained at least 7 days after the first dose and meloxicam plasma concentrations
      were quantified by h.p.l.c. RESULTS: NONMEM analysis was conducted on plasma
      samples derived from 586 patients. A one-compartmental model was found to
      describe the data adequately. For a typical subject in the population, a
      clearance of 0.377 l h-1 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.0304-0.449) in males and
      0.347 l h-1 (95% CI 0.274-0.419) in females was obtained. The volume of
      distribution was estimated to be 14.9 l. The findings were corroborated by
      subsequent analysis using WinBUGS. Analysis of covariates showed that age and
      gender both significantly (P < 0.005) affected clearance. The effect of age was
      relatively small and a dose adjustment of <10% was deemed unnecessary.
      Differences between males and females were attributed to differences in weight.
      No clinically relevant drug-drug interactions were found, although sulphasalazine
      and glucocorticoids both significantly (P < 0.005) affected meloxicam clearance
      (+19% and - 12%, respectively). The mechanisms by which these agents affect
      meloxicam clearance remain to be elucidated. CONCLUSIONS: The population
      pharmacokinetic meloxicam data from patients with RA gave similar results to
      those obtained from phase I trials. However, uncommon drug interactions may not
      be detected in phase I trials because of the small number of observations made.

TI  - Celecoxib-related renal papillary necrosis.
PG  - 114-5
AB  - Selective cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitors are known to affect renal
      prostaglandins (epoprostenol and dinoprostone), which are at least in part COX-2 
      dependent. Consequently, adverse events including hypertension, peripheral edema,
      hypercalemia, hyponatremia, and acute renal failure have been reported to occur
      with the new COX-2-specific inhibitors. This case report posits celecoxib as a
      likely cause of renal papillary necrosis and alerts physicians to the possibility
      of this additional renal complication with COX-2-specific inhibitors.

TI  - A randomized, clinical trial comparing oral celecoxib 200 mg, celecoxib 400 mg,
      and ibuprofen 600 mg for acute pain.
PG  - 22-30
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Celecoxib is a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor used to
      treat pain. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacies of
      celecoxib and ibuprofen for the treatment of acute pain. The null hypothesis was 
      that no difference between celecoxib and ibuprofen exists. METHODS: The study was
      a prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial. After
      consent, patients rated their pain on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) and
      categorical intensity pain scale. Patients were then randomized to receive 200-mg
      or 400-mg celecoxib or 600-mg ibuprofen (all orally). Patients were contacted 5
      hours after receiving study medication when a second VAS score was recorded,
      along with categorical pain intensity, pain relief score, side effects, and
      number of rescue medications taken. The main outcome measures were change in
      visual analog pain and categorical pain intensity scores, and pain relief scores,
      at five hours. RESULTS: One hundred ten patients were evaluated and 105 were
      enrolled. Thirty-four received celecoxib 200 mg, 32 received celecoxib 400 mg,
      and 39 received ibuprofen 600 mg. Ninety-one were available for the five-hour VAS
      and 88 for the five-hour categorical pain intensity and pain relief analysis: The
      two patients who were unable to read a VAS were excluded, and two enrolled
      patients withdrew prior to medication. One patient was excluded because his
      injury was a fracture, and therefore did not meet the inclusion criteria. There
      was no statistical difference among the treatment groups in age, time from injury
      to medication, initial VAS score, percent lost to follow-up, or treatment with
      adjunctive therapy. There was no statistical difference in change of VAS among
      the groups at five hours: ibuprofen 600 mg (-23.8 mm [95% CI = -31.56 mm to -16.1
      mm] [n = 32]), celecoxib 200 mg (-16.1 mm [95% CI = -24.3 mm to -7.98 mm] [n =
      31]), and celecoxib 400 mg (-12.4 mm [95% CI = -23.1 mm to -1.8 mm] [n = 30]) (p 
      = 0.16). There was no significant difference between the groups, at five hours,
      in change of categorical pain intensity (p = 0.11) or pain relief scores (p =
      0.059), though the pain relief scale approached significance favoring ibuprofen. 
      CONCLUSIONS: No significant difference exists among emergency department (ED)
      patients treated for acute pain, at five hours, with celecoxib 200 mg, celecoxib 
      400 mg, or ibuprofen 600 mg, though the power of the study to detect a change was
      low, 36%. However, the magnitude of pain relief for celecoxib, coupled with the
      cost of the medication, questions its use in the immediate ED setting.

PG  - 141-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This randomized, double-dummy, double-blind pilot study of acutely
      exacerbated low back pain was aimed to inform a definitive comparison between
      Doloteffin, a proprietary extract of Harpagophytum, and rofecoxib, a selective
      inhibitor of cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2). METHODS: Forty-four patients
      (phyto-anti-inflammatory drug-PAID-group) received a daily dose of Doloteffin
      containing, inter alia, 60 mg of harpagoside for 6 weeks and 44 (non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drug-NSAID-group) received 12.5 mg/day of rofecoxib. All were
      allowed rescue medication of up to 400 mg/day of tramadol. Several outcome
      measures were examined at various intervals to obtain estimates of effect size
      and variability that might be used to decide the most suitable principal outcome 
      measure and corresponding numbers required for a definitive study. RESULTS:
      Forty-three PAID and 36 NSAID patients completed the study. Ten PAID and 5 NSAID 
      patients reported no pain without rescue medication for at least 5 days of the
      6th week of treatment. Eighteen PAID and 12 NSAID patients had more than a 50%
      reduction in the week's average of their pain scores between the 1st and 6th
      weeks. The mean percentage decrease from baseline in the pain component of the
      Arhus Index was 23 (S.D. 52) in PAID and 26 (S.D. 43) in NSAID. The corresponding
      measures for the overall Arhus Index were 11 (31) and 16 (24) and, for the Health
      Assessment Questionnaire, 7 (8) and 6 (7). Tramadol was used by 21 PAID patients 
      and 13 NSAID patients. Fourteen patients in each group experienced 39 adverse
      effects, of which 28 (13 in PAID) were judged to some degree attributable to the 
      study medications. CONCLUSION: Though no significant intergroup differences were 
      demonstrable, large numbers will be needed to show equivalence.

TI  - Adverse events associated with rofecoxib therapy: results of a large study in
      community-derived osteoarthritic patients.
PG  - 49-54
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety profile of rofecoxib, a selective
      cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitor, in patients with osteoarthritis who are receiving
      care in non-hospital practice settings. DESIGN: All patients participating in a
      large 24-week, open-label, nonpharmacological intervention trial were given
      rofecoxib for painful osteoarthritis of the knee or hip. They started at a dose
      of 12.5mg once daily for the first month, with the option of increasing to 25mg
      daily thereafter, if needed for efficacy. Adverse events were closely monitored. 
      We considered all adverse events that occurred during treatment and within 14
      days of discontinuation of rofecoxib. PATIENT GROUP STUDIED: 2896 patients (861
      males and 2035 females) were involved in the safety analysis. Their mean (SD) age
      was 66.8 (9.9) years, and 631 patients (21.8%) were aged >/=75 years. There were 
      913 patients (31.5%) with hypertension and 151 (5.2%) with diabetes mellitus at
      the start of the study; 78 patients (2.7%) had a prior medical history of angina 
      and/or myocardial infarction. The mean (SD) duration of rofecoxib treatment was
      139 (62) days. RESULTS: A total of 519 patients (17.9%) discontinued rofecoxib.
      The main reasons for discontinuation were dyspepsia (4.4%), nausea (2.4%) and
      dizziness (2.1%). The annualised incidence rates (95% CI) of complicated and
      uncomplicated upper gastrointestinal ulcers, myocardial infarction, and stroke
      were 1.36 (0.76-2.23), 0.09 (0-0.50) and 0.45 (0.16-1.05), respectively.
      CONCLUSION: This study conducted in conditions close to daily practice confirms
      that the use of rofecoxib is associated with a low rate of serious adverse events
      in patients with osteoarthritis.

TI  - The second generation of COX-2 inhibitors: what advantages do the newest offer?
PG  - 33-45
AB  - The discovery of two cyclooxygenase (COX)-isoenzymes, a constitutive COX-1,
      serving homeostatic prostanoid synthesis, and an inducible COX-2, responsible for
      proinflammatory prostanoid production, led to the development of new
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), the selective COX-2 inhibitors,
      promising minimal NSAID-typical toxicity with full anti-inflammatory efficacy. So
      far, the strategy of selective COX-2 inhibition has been successful. Selective
      COX-2 inhibitors have significantly less gastrotoxicity and no effects on
      platelet aggregation. However, with regard to renal adverse events, selective
      COX-2 inhibitors do not offer a clinically relevant advantage over non-selective 
      inhibitors. Moreover, concerns over the cardiovascular risk of selective COX-2
      inhibitors have recently been raised. The second generation of COX-2 inhibitors
      with higher COX-2 selectivity was developed with the promise of further reduction
      of NSAID-typical adverse effects. The leading compounds are valdecoxib,
      parecoxib, etoricoxib and lumaricoxib. At the present time they have proven
      efficacy for the treatment of pain and inflammation. Parecoxib as a parenteral,
      highly selective COX-2 inhibitor has the potential to become the NSAID of choice 
      for treatment of postoperative pain. In clinical trials, valdecoxib, parecoxib,
      etoricoxib and lumaricoxib have caused no more endoscopic ulcers than placebo.
      However, to date, no data on the clinically relevant endpoints perforation,
      symptomatic ulcer and bleeding are available. Furthermore, no definite
      conclusions on renal and cardiovascular safety are possible. Current evidence
      points to a marginal, if any, gain of safety compared with the first generation
      of COX-2 inhibitors. However, trials with the new COX-2 inhibitors offer the
      chance to address these open questions of highly selective COX-2 inhibition; that
      is, thrombogenic risk, sodium and water retention, and interference with tissue
      repair, in particular, healing of mucosal damage.

TI  - A comparison of rofecoxib versus celecoxib in treating pain after dental surgery:
      a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and
      active-comparator-controlled, parallel-group, single-dose study using the dental 
      impaction pain model.
PG  - 1549-60
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rofecoxib and celecoxib, selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, have 
      analgesic efficacy similar to that of nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to confirm earlier findings that the
      overall analgesic efficacy of rofecoxib 50 mg was superior to that of celecoxib
      200 mg and to extend the comparison to include celecoxib 400 mg. METHODS: In this
      single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and
      active-comparator-controlled, parallel-group, single-dose study, patients who
      experienced moderate or severe pain after surgical extraction of at least 2 third
      molars received a single oral dose of either rofecoxib 50 mg, celecoxib 400 mg,
      celecoxib 200 mg, ibuprofen 400 mg, or placebo. Patients recorded scores of pain 
      intensity, pain relief, and global assessment at prespecified time intervals
      throughout the 24-hour period after dosing. The end points were total pain relief
      (TOPAR) score over 8 hours (TOPAR8; primary end point), TOPAR score over 12 hours
      (TOPAR12), sum of pain intensity difference (SPID) over 8 and 12 hours (SPID8 and
      SPID12), patient's global assessment of study drug at 8 hours, time to confirmed 
      perceptible pain relief (ie, time to onset of analgesic effect), peak pain
      intensity difference (PID), peak pain relief, time to first dose of rescue
      medication (ie, duration of analgesic effect), and percentage of patients using
      rescue medication. RESULTS: A total of 482 patients (358 females, 124 males; mean
      age, 22.1 years) were enrolled. Rofecoxib 50 mg (n = 151 patients) demonstrated
      significantly greater overall analgesic efficacy compared with celecoxib 400 mg
      (n = 151), as measured by TOPAR8 (least squares mean [SE] 17.2 [0.8] vs 15.0
      [0.8]; P < 0.05) and TOPAR12 (25.3 [1.2] vs 21.0 [1.2]; P < 0.05), as well as a
      significantly longer duration of analgesic effect (P < 0.05). Time to onset of
      analgesic effect and peak analgesic effect were similar for rofecoxib 50 mg and
      celecoxib 400 mg. Rofecoxib also showed significantly greater overall analgesic
      efficacy than did celecoxib 200 mg (n = 90), including greater TOPAR8 scores
      (17.2 [0.8] vs 11.5 [1.1]; P < 0.001), faster onset of analgesic effect (P <
      0.001), greater peak analgesic effect (P < 0.001 for peak pain relief and peak
      PID), and longer duration of analgesic effect (P < 0.001). The overall analgesic 
      efficacy of rofecoxib 50 mg was similar to that of ibuprofen 400 mg (n = 45),
      except that the duration of analgesic effect of rofecoxib 50 mg was significantly
      longer (P < 0.001). All active treatments produced significantly greater overall 
      analgesic efficacy compared with that of placebo (P < 0.001 for all scores
      [TOPAR8, TOPAR12, SPID8, SPID12, and patient's global assessment] for all study
      drugs). The adverse-events (AE) profile was generally similar in all treatment
      groups. The 3 most common AEs were nausea, postextraction alveolitis, and
      vomiting. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, rofecoxib 50 mg provided generally superior
      overall analgesic efficacy compared with that of celecoxib 400 and 200 mg,
      including a significantly longer duration of analgesic effect. The overall
      analgesic efficacy of rofecoxib 50 mg was generally similar to that of ibuprofen 
      400 mg, except for a significantly longer duration of analgesic effect.

AB  - A 41-year-old woman was given celecoxib (Celebrex) for the treatment of carpal
      tunnel syndrome. An erythematous rash developed that progressed to exfoliative
      dermatitis, and the patient was diagnosed with toxic epidermal necrolysis. After 
      transfer to the burn unit, she was treated with topical mupirocin calcium cream
      and bismuth tribromophenatein petrolatum gauze dressings. Her wounds healed well.
      This is the first case report of toxic epidermal necrolysis due to treatment with
      celecoxib of which we are aware.

PG  - 5072-5
AB  - Estrogens influence cardiovascular function through direct and indirect effects
      and via genomic and nongenomic mechanisms. The pathways underlying the nongenomic
      mechanisms are not completely understood. Estrogen-induced responses in vascular 
      cells have been shown to influence prostaglandins and cyclooxygenase (COX), a key
      enzyme in the production of prostaglandins, with two isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2.
      We investigated the effects of prostaglandins on the acute potentiation by
      17beta-estradiol (E) of acetylcholine (ACh)-mediated vasodilation in the
      cutaneous vasculature. Using a double-blind placebo-controlled design, we
      assessed skin blood flow in 32 healthy, postmenopausal women by laser Doppler
      velocimetry with direct current iontophoresis of ACh and sodium nitroprusside
      before and after 6-wk treatment periods with aspirin (a nonspecific COX-1 and
      COX-2 inhibitor), diclofenac (predominantly a COX-2 inhibitor, which also
      inhibits COX-1), celecoxib (a specific COX-2 inhibitor), given at
      anti-inflammatory doses, or placebo. Blood flux values before iontophoresis of
      ACh did not differ between the treatment groups or after E administration,
      excluding a direct cutaneous vasodilator effect of the treatments or of E. Acute 
      E administration enhanced the response to ACh after aspirin, diclofenac, and
      placebo; however, this effect was completely abolished with celecoxib treatment
      (P < 0.05). E had no effect on sodium nitroprusside-mediated vasodilation after
      any of the treatments. We conclude that the COX-2 pathway plays a specific role
      in the rapid E-induced potentiation of cholinergic vasodilation in postmenopausal
      women.

AB  - Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are well known to cause fluid and
      electrolyte abnormalities and renal failure. NSAIDs also may cause an acute
      allergic interstitial nephritis (AIN) and the nephrotic syndrome, characterized
      by histologic pathology consistent with minimal change disease in patients with
      previously normal renal function. The nephrotoxic potential of cyclooxygenase 2
      (COX-2) inhibitors has not been established because AIN associated with nephrotic
      syndrome has not been reported secondary to the COX-2 inhibitors. This case
      report describes the first case of AIN associated with nephrotic syndrome in a
      patient treated with the selective COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib.

PG  - 1308-11, table of contents
AB  - In this study we evaluated the analgesic efficacy and the opioid-sparing effect
      of rofecoxib in ear-nose-throat surgery patients. Patients undergoing nasal
      septal or sinus surgery were randomized to receive either oral placebo or
      rofecoxib 50 mg 1 h before surgery. All patients received propofol 0.8 mg/kg,
      fentanyl 1 microg/kg, and local anesthesia at the operative site. Sedation was
      maintained by a continuous infusion of propofol adjusted to maintain sedation at 
      a 2-3 level on the Ramsey scale. Additional fentanyl 0.5-1 microg/kg was
      administered at the patient's request or if the verbal rating scale score was >4.
      Patient sedation and pain scores were obtained at 5, 15, 30 45, and 60 min during
      surgery and 30 min and 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 h after completion of the procedure.
      During the postoperative period, diclofenac 75 mg IM was administered for
      analgesia at the patient's request or if the visual analog scale (VAS) rating for
      pain was more than 4. VAS pain scores, intraoperative fentanyl, and postoperative
      diclofenac requirements were significantly smaller in the rofecoxib group
      compared with the placebo group (P < 0.001). The times to first analgesic request
      were also significantly less in the rofecoxib group. We conclude that the
      preoperative administration of oral rofecoxib provided a significant analgesic
      benefit and decreased the need for opioids in patients undergoing nasal septal
      and nasal sinus surgery. IMPLICATIONS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
      analgesic efficacy and opioid-sparing effect of rofecoxib, a new selective
      cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor drug, in ear-nose-throat surgery patients.
      Preoperative administration of oral rofecoxib provided a significant analgesic
      benefit and decreased the need for opioids in patients undergoing nasal septal
      and nasal sinus surgery.

TI  - COX-2-specific inhibitors: prescribing patterns in a large managed care health
      system and strategies to minimize costs.
PG  - 869-77
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the relative costs associated with the exclusive use of
      celecoxib versus rofecoxib in a large managed care system. STUDY DESIGN: A
      retrospective review of all calendar year 2000 prescriptions dispensed for
      celecoxib and rofecoxib in the Veterans Affairs (VA) system. METHODS: The primary
      data points included drug strength, quantity dispensed, and days supply for the
      prescription. The cost minimization model described in Federal Practitioner
      (1999;16[4]:41-44) was used to calculate the cost savings. The mean once-daily
      dosing rates and their 95% confidence intervals were determined by binomial data 
      analysis. Calendar year 2001 utilization and cost projections were derived by
      linear regression trend analysis. RESULTS: Current VA system costs per dose are
      celecoxib 100 mg $0.66; celecoxib 200 mg $1.32; rofecoxib (12.5 or 25 mg) $1.32; 
      rofecoxib 50 mg $2.14. During calendar year 2000, the VA spent $13.8 million and 
      $4.2 million on celecoxib and rofecoxib, respectively. The percentage of
      once-daily or less than once-daily dosing was celecoxib 100 mg (17%), celecoxib
      200 mg (67%), celecoxib overall (49%), rofecoxib 12.5 mg (86%), rofecoxib 25 mg
      (94%), rofecoxib 50 mg (100%), and rofecoxib overall (93%). Based on current
      utilization, if all celecoxib prescriptions were changed to rofecoxib, the VA
      would have realized annual cost savings of $2.1 million in calendar year 2000. In
      calendar year 2001, projected cost savings could total $5.2 million. This
      potential savings is largely due to the high prevalence of twice-daily celecoxib 
      dosing. CONCLUSION: The results of the cyclooxygenase-2 cost minimization
      analysis provide a compelling argument for the preferred use of rofecoxib in the 
      VA system, and potentially in other managed care systems.

PG  - 1071-3
AB  - Results of premarketing and postmarketing trials have raised doubts about the
      cardiovascular safety of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)
      rofecoxib, especially at doses greater than 25 mg. Between Jan 1, 1999, and June 
      30, 2001, we did a retrospective cohort study of individuals on the expanded
      Tennessee Medicaid programme (TennCare), in which we assessed occurrence of
      serious coronary heart disease (CHD) in non-users (n=202916) and in users of
      rofecoxib and other NSAIDs (rofecoxib n=24 132, other n=151 728). Participants
      were aged 50-84 years, lived in the community, and had no life-threatening
      non-cardiovascular illness. Users of high-dose rofecoxib were 1.70 (95% CI
      0.98-2.95, p=0.058) times more likely than non-users to have CHD; among new users
      this rate increased to 1.93 (1.09-3.42, p=0.024). By contrast, there was no
      evidence of raised risk of CHD among users of rofecoxib at doses of 25 mg or less
      or among users of other NSAIDs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of rofecoxib 25 mg and 50 mg
      once daily versus placebo and naproxen 500 mg twice daily in patients with RA.
      METHODS: Eligible patients were randomized (double-blind) to placebo (n = 289),
      rofecoxib 25 mg (n = 306), 50 mg (n = 286) once daily, or naproxen (n = 142) for 
      12 weeks. Efficacy assessments included the ACR core set, with prespecified
      primary endpoints: patient and investigator global assessments of disease
      activity, tender and swollen joint counts. Investigator-reported adverse
      experiences, routine laboratory and vital sign measurements were monitored.
      RESULTS: Rofecoxib 25 mg, 50 mg, and naproxen provided similar treatment effects,
      significantly different from placebo, consistent with improvement, for all
      primary endpoints. Effects were evident at the earliest assessment (week 2) and
      sustained for 12 weeks. All treatments were generally well-tolerated.
      CONCLUSIONS: Rofecoxib 25 mg once daily had similar efficacy to naproxen 500 mg
      twice daily (a standard dose). No additional benefit was seen with 50 mg
      rofecoxib.

TI  - Stratifying the risk of NSAID-related upper gastrointestinal clinical events:
      results of a double-blind outcomes study in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
PG  - 1006-12
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Epidemiologic data indicate that the risk of nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-related gastrointestinal (GI) clinical events
      varies based on patients' clinical characteristics. The authors determined risk
      factors for NSAID-related clinical upper GI events and the event rates, absolute 
      risk reductions, and numbers needed to treat for individual risk factors for a
      nonselective NSAID and a selective cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor in a double-blind
      outcomes trial. METHODS: Eight thousand seventy-six rheumatoid arthritis patients
      aged >or=50 years (or >or=40 on corticosteroid therapy) were randomly assigned to
      rofecoxib 50 mg daily or naproxen 500 mg twice daily for a median of 9 months.
      The development of clinical upper GI events (bleeding, perforation, obstruction, 
      and symptomatic ulcer identified on clinically indicated work-up) was assessed.
      RESULTS: Significant risk factors included prior upper GI events, age >or=65, and
      severe rheumatoid arthritis (RR, 2.3-3.9). Patients administered naproxen who had
      prior upper GI complications or who were aged >or=75 years had 18.84 or 14.46
      events per 100 patient-years, and the risk of events remained constant over time.
      The reduction in events with rofecoxib was similar in high- and low-risk
      subgroups (RR, 0.31-0.68). The number needed to treat with rofecoxib instead of
      naproxen to avert 1 GI event was 10-12 in highest risk patients (prior event, age
      >or=75 years, or severe rheumatoid arthritis), 17-33 in patients with other risk 
      factors, and 42-106 in low-risk patients. CONCLUSIONS: NSAID-related GI events
      increase dramatically with risk factors such as prior events or older age. Ten to
      twelve high-risk patients need to be treated with a protective strategy such as
      the selective cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, rofecoxib, to avert a clinical GI
      event.

TI  - Cost-efficacy of rofecoxib versus acetaminophen for preventing pain after
      ambulatory surgery.
PG  - 931-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs are commonly administered as part
      of a multimodal regimen for pain management in the ambulatory setting. This
      randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study was designed to compare the 
      analgesic effect of oral rofecoxib, a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, and
      acetaminophen when administered alone or in combination prior to outpatient
      otolaryngologic surgery. METHODS: A total of 143 healthy outpatients undergoing
      elective otolaryngologic surgery were assigned to one of four study groups: group
      1 = control (500 mg vitamin C); group 2 = 2 g acetaminophen; group 3 = 50 mg
      rofecoxib; or group 4 = 2 g acetaminophen and 50 mg rofecoxib. The first oral
      dose of the study medication was taken 15-45 min before surgery, and a second
      dose of the same medication was administered on the morning after surgery.
      Recovery times, side effects, and the need for rescue analgesics were recorded.
      Follow-up evaluations were performed at 24 and 48 h after surgery to assess
      postdischarge pain, analgesic requirements, nausea, and patient satisfaction with
      their postoperative pain management and quality of recovery. Peak pain scores and
      the need for rescue analgesic medication were used as the endpoints for
      estimating efficacy of the study drugs, while cost to achieve complete
      satisfaction with analgesia was used in the cost-effectiveness analysis. RESULTS:
      Premedication with rofecoxib (50 mg) was significantly more effective than either
      placebo or acetaminophen (2 g) in reducing the peak postoperative pain, the need 
      for analgesic medication, and improving the quality of recovery and patient
      satisfaction. Moreover, the addition of acetaminophen failed to improve its
      analgesic efficacy. An expenditure for rofecoxib of 16.76 US dollars (95%
      confidence interval, 7.89 to 21.03 US dollars) and 30.24 US dollars (95%
      confidence interval, 5.25 to 54.20 US dollars) would obtain complete satisfaction
      with pain control in one additional patient who would not have been satisfied if 
      placebo or acetaminophen, respectively, had been administered prior to surgery.
      CONCLUSIONS: Rofecoxib, 50 mg administered orally, decreased postoperative pain
      and the need for analgesic rescue medication after otolaryngologic surgery. The
      addition of 2 g oral acetaminophen failed to improve its analgesic efficacy.

TI  - Efficacy, tolerability, and upper gastrointestinal safety of celecoxib for
      treatment of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis: systematic review of
      randomised controlled trials.
PG  - 619
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy, gastrointestinal safety, and tolerability
      of celecoxib (a cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX 2) inhibitor) used in the treatment of
      osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. DESIGN: Systematic review of randomised 
      trials that compared at least 12 weeks' celecoxib treatment with another
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or placebo and reported efficacy,
      tolerability, or safety. Trials identified from manufacturer and by searching
      electronic databases and evaluated according to predefined inclusion and quality 
      criteria. Data combined through meta-analysis. PARTICIPANTS: 15 187 patients with
      osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Efficacy: Western 
      Ontario and McMaster universities osteoarthritis index; American College of
      Rheumatology responder index and joint scores for rheumatoid arthritis.
      Tolerability: withdrawal rates for adverse effects. Gastrointestinal safety:
      incidence of ulcers, bleeds, perforations, and obstructions. RESULTS: Nine
      randomised controlled trials were included. Celecoxib and NSAIDS were equally
      effective for all efficacy outcomes. Compared with those taking other NSAIDs, in 
      patients taking celecoxib the rate of withdrawals due to adverse gastrointestinal
      events was 46% lower (95% confidence interval 29% to 58%; NNT 35 at three
      months), the incidence of ulcers detectable by endoscopy was 71% lower (59% to
      79%; NNT 6 at three months), and the incidence of symptoms of ulcers,
      perforations, bleeds, and obstructions was 39% lower (4% to 61%; NNT 208 at six
      months). Subgroup analysis of patients taking aspirin showed that the incidence
      of ulcers detected by endoscopy was reduced by 51% (14% to 72%) in those given
      celecoxib compared with other NSAIDs. The reduction was greater (73%, 52% to 84%)
      in those not taking aspirin. CONCLUSION: Celecoxib is as effective as other
      NSAIDs for relief of symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis and has 
      significantly improved gastrointestinal safety and tolerability.

AB  - Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a rare disease that is defined by extensive
      detachment of full-thickness epidermis. It most often is related to an adverse
      drug reaction. The drugs implicated in most cases of TEN have been sulfonamides, 
      anticonvulsants, allopurinol, and some of the conventional nonsteroidal
      antiinflammatory agents. We describe a patient who developed a generalized
      desquamating rash after therapy with celecoxib.

TI  - Rofecoxib-induced instant aquagenic wrinkling of the palms.
PG  - 353-5
AB  - An 18-year-old woman presented with a 3-week complaint of exaggerated palmar
      wrinkling and swelling following brief exposure (1-2 minutes) of her hands to
      water. She had a history of mixed connective tissue disease and had been started 
      on rofecoxib therapy 1 month prior to the onset of her skin symptoms.
      Discontinuation of rofecoxib was followed by resolution of symptoms within a
      period of 3 weeks. Similar palmar skin changes following water exposure have been
      reported to occur in cystic fibrosis and are thought to be due to increased salt 
      content of the skin and secondary increased water-binding capacity. Rofecoxib is 
      a selective COX-2 inhibitor that has been shown to increase sodium reabsorption
      in the kidney via effects on prostaglandin E2 and the renal vasculature. The
      COX-2 protein is also expressed in keratinocytes and plays a role in keratinocyte
      differentiation. Prostaglandin E2 also plays a role in keratinocyte proliferation
      and differentiation. Thus rofecoxib may cause increased sodium reabsorption in
      the skin, as it does in the kidney. The rofecoxib-associated elevation in skin
      sodium may increase keratin water-binding capacity and cause exaggerated
      aquagenic wrinkling of the skin, as occurs in cystic fibrosis.

AB  - A 76-year-old patient developed cutaneous vasculitis on the lower legs on the 8th
      day of treatment with the selective cox-2-inhibitor celecoxib (Celebrex((R))) and
      the proton-pump inhibitor omeprazole. The patient had no history of allergic
      reactions. The patient had already been treated previously with omeprazole
      without any side effects. A cutaneous biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of
      leucocytoclastic vasculitis. The purpuric skin lesions regressed within 3 weeks
      after withdrawing the two newly introduced drugs. We discuss the potential role
      of Celecoxib in triggering this vasculitis.

TI  - A single preoperative oral dose of valdecoxib, a new cyclooxygenase-2 specific
      inhibitor, relieves post-oral surgery or bunionectomy pain.
PG  - 565-73
AB  - BACKGROUND: The trend toward day-case surgery, with discharge on oral medication,
      has highlighted the need for effective and safe analgesics that facilitate a
      rapid recovery and discharge time. This study evaluated the analgesic efficacy,
      dose dependency, duration of action, and safety of the cyclooxygenase-2 specific 
      inhibitor, valdecoxib, administered before oral or orthopedic surgery. METHODS:
      Eligible healthy adult patients were scheduled to undergo either extraction of
      two impacted third molar teeth (n = 284) or bunionectomy surgery (n = 223) with
      local anesthesia in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies
      conducted at three centers in the United States. Patients received a single,
      preoperatively administered oral dose of placebo or 10 (oral surgery only), 20,
      40, or 80 mg valdecoxib. Analgesic efficacy was assessed postoperatively, over a 
      24-h treatment period, or until the patient required rescue medication. Efficacy 
      measures included time to rescue medication, proportion of patients requiring
      such rescue, pain intensity, and the Patient's Global Evaluation of Study
      Medication. RESULTS: In both studies, all doses of valdecoxib produced analgesia 
      with a duration (time to rescue analgesia) and magnitude (Pain Intensity,
      Patient's Global Evaluation) significantly greater than placebo. A dose-dependent
      effect was observed up to 40 mg valdecoxib, with an 80-mg dose providing no
      additional analgesic benefit. In both models, all doses of valdecoxib were well
      tolerated, with no clinically significant treatment-related gastrointestinal,

TI  - Effects of celecoxib and diclofenac on blood pressure, renal function, and
      vasoactive prostanoids in young and elderly subjects.
PG  - 985-94
AB  - Cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors are among the most widely used drugs, especially 
      in the elderly. It has been claimed that the new COX-2 inhibitors offer
      advantages in terms of drug safety. To test this hypothesis, the authors compared
      in a double-blind, randomized trial the effects of celecoxib (200 mg bid) and
      diclofenac (75 mg bid) on blood pressure and renal function in two groups (each n
      = 12) of young (mean age = 32 years) and elderly (mean age = 68 years)
      normotensive subjects. Changes from baseline in the 24-hour blood pressure
      profiles, parameters of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, inulin
      clearance, urinary marker proteins, and eicosanoid excretion were monitored
      during the treatment period of 2 weeks. Comparison between celecoxib and
      diclofenac showed no significant difference in minor alterations of blood
      pressure. During daytime, there was a trend to elevation of mean arterial blood
      pressure (mmHg) by celecoxib in the elderly of 2.8 (95 % confidence interval [CI)
      = -2.5 to 8.2) in comparison with the young subjects of -1.3 (95% CI= -3.7 to
      1.0); there was also a trend to elevation of mean arterial blood pressure by
      diclofenac in the elderly of 4.1 (95% CI= -1.2 to 9.4) in comparison with the
      young subjects of 0.4 (95% CI= -2.4 to 3.2). In both populations, the authors
      found no significant drug effects on the parameters of the
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, inulin clearance, and urinary marker
      proteins. As expected, diclofenac reduced excretion of allprostanoids, whereas
      celecoxib did not affect production of TxB2 and its metabolites. Neither in young
      nor in elderly normotensive subjects were blood pressure and renal function
      significantly affected by a short-term treatment with standard doses of celecoxib
      and diclofenac. Therefore, normal aging appears not to represent a special risk
      factor in therapy with these two agents.

TI  - Celecoxib does not affect the antiplatelet activity of aspirin in healthy
      volunteers.
PG  - 1027-30
AB  - Celecoxib is a novel cyclooxygenase-2-specific inhibitor for the management of
      acute pain, primary dysmenorrhea, and the signs and symptoms of arthritis. This
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 16 healthy volunteers evaluated whether
      celecoxib alters the effect of concomitant aspirin on platelet function.
      Volunteers received celecoxib (400 mg/day) or placebo for 4 days. On day 5, they 
      also received a single 325 mg dose of aspirin with either 200 mg celecoxib or
      placebo. Thromboxane and platelet aggregation response to adenosine
      5'-diphosphate (ADP), collagen, and arachidonic acid were measured before the
      first dose of celecoxib or placebo (baseline) and before dosing and 2 and 8 hours
      post dose on day 5. There was no significant difference in thromboxane inhibition
      between the two groups (percent inhibition: placebo 99.4%, celecoxib 99.0%; p =
      0.555). There was also no significant difference in the effect of aspirin on
      platelet aggregation due to ADP, collagen, or arachidonic acid between the
      groups. Therefore, these data indicate that celecoxib does not alter the effects 
      of aspirin on platelet function.

TI  - The influence of parecoxib, a parenteral cyclooxygenase-2 specific inhibitor, on 
      the pharmacokinetics and clinical effects of midazolam.
PG  - 667-73, table of contents
AB  - Parecoxib, a parenteral cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, is undergoing clinical
      development as an analgesic/antiinflammatory drug for perioperative use.
      Parecoxib, an inactive prodrug, is hydrolyzed in vivo to valdecoxib, a substrate 
      for hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. Thus, potential exists for interactions
      with other CYP3A4 substrates. In this investigation, we determined the influence 
      of parecoxib on the pharmacokinetics and clinical effects of midazolam, a CYP3A4 
      substrate, in volunteers. This was a randomized, balanced crossover,
      placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical investigation. Twelve healthy
      subjects aged 23-41 yr were studied after providing IRB-approved informed
      consent. Midazolam 0.07 mg/kg IV infusion was administered 1 h after placebo
      (control) or parecoxib 40 mg IV. Venous midazolam concentrations were determined 
      by using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry assay.
      Pharmacokinetic variables were determined by noncompartmental analysis.
      Pharmacodynamic measurements included clinical end-points, cognitive function
      (memory; digit symbol substitution tests), subjective self-assessment of recovery
      (visual analog scales), and bispectral index. Midazolam plasma concentrations
      were similar between placebo and parecoxib-treated subjects. No differences were 
      found in midazolam pharmacokinetics (maximal observed plasma concentration,
      clearance, elimination half-life, volume of distribution) or pharmacodynamics
      (clinical end-points, digit symbol substitution tests, memory, visual analog
      scales, bispectral index). Single-bolus parecoxib does not alter the
      pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of midazolam infusion. Parecoxib did not
      affect CYP3A4 activity as assessed using midazolam clearance as the in vivo
      probe. IMPLICATIONS: Parecoxib, a parenteral cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor intended 
      for perioperative use as an analgesic/antiinflammatory drug, is a substrate for
      hepatic cytochrome P450 3A4. The potential for a drug interaction with midazolam,
      an in vivo CYP3A4 probe, was tested in healthy volunteers. Single-bolus parecoxib
      does not alter the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of midazolam.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of nonprescription ibuprofen versus celecoxib for
      dental pain.
PG  - 912-9
AB  - Many clinicians appear confused about the purported clinical advantages of the
      new generation COX-2 inhibitors compared to both over-the-counter and
      prescription nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory analgesic agents (NSAIDs). Infact,
      there is a paucity of published information comparing the safety and efficacy of 
      these two classes of drugs when used to treat acute pain. This study was designed
      to compare the safety and analgesic efficacy of an over-the-counter (OTC)
      analgesic, ibuprofen (Advil Liqui-Gels), to the leading prescription COX-2
      inhibitor celecoxib (Celebrex). Ibuprofen liquigel is an encapsulated,
      solubilized potassium salt of ibuprofen that has a higher Cmax and shorter tmax
      than traditional ibuprofen solid-dosage formulations. This trial evaluated the
      maximum approved OTC dosing regimen (400 mg x 3, q4-6h) of ibuprofen liquigels
      compared to a single dose of celecoxib (200 mg) and placebo in 174 patients with 
      moderate orsevere pain following surgical extraction of impacted third molars.
      The study design was multiple dose, randomized (stratified by baseline pain and
      gender), placebo controlled, double blind, double dummy, and parallel group. The 
      onset of pain relief was determined using a two-stopwatch procedure. Treatments
      were also compared using standard indices of pain intensity and pain relief. The 
      study demonstrated assay sensitivity in that both active medications were
      significantly more effective than placebo for all efficacy measures. In comparing
      the two active medications, the time to meaningful relief was significantly
      shorter, and the mean 4-, 8-, and 12-hour summed pain relief combined with pain
      intensity difference scores were significantly higher for ibuprofen liquigels
      compared with celecoxib (p < 0.001). Analyses of other key efficacy variables,
      including the time to rescue medication and the patients' overall assessment of
      study medication, confirmed the superior efficacy of ibuprofen liquigels over
      celecoxib. Both active treatments were well tolerated, with no differences in
      incidence or severity of adverse events. Of particular interest, there were no
      differences in gastrointestinal-related side effects when comparing these doses
      of ibuprofen liquigels to celecoxib. In conclusion, ibuprofen liquigels were a
      significantly more effective analgesic and provided relief significantly faster
      compared with celecoxib in the treatment of postsurgical pain.

TI  - Effects of meloxicam on platelet function in healthy adults: a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 881-6
AB  - Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1),
      thereby inhibiting platelet function via blockade of thromboxane A2 (TxA2)
      formation, and COX-2, the enzyme that mediates inflammatory responses. Meloxicam 
      is a relatively COX-2-selective anti-arthritis drug that shows significant TxA2
      inhibition, albeit less than traditional NSAIDs. A randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 79 healthy adults to compare the
      effects of once-daily therapeutic (7.5 mg, 15 mg) and supratherapeutic (30 mg)
      doses of meloxicam with extended-release indomethacin (Indo-ER 75 mg once daily) 
      on bleeding time, TxA2 formation, and platelet aggregation. The authors measured 
      platelet aggregation to COX-1-dependent (ADP arachidonate) and COX-1-independent 
      (high-dose collagen) agonists, bleeding time, serum TxB2, and clotting times
      (aPTT and PT) after 8 days' administration and at 3 and 6 hours after
      steady-state dosing. Meloxicam significantly decreased TxB2 production compared
      with placebo in a dose-dependent fashion, reaching a peak of 77% inhibition 6
      hours after 30 mg meloxicam; Indo-ER blocked TxB2 formation by 96% at the same
      time point. However, neither acute nor 8 days' administration of meloxicam at any
      dose caused a significant increase in bleeding time or inhibition of platelet
      aggregation to any agonist when compared with placebo. By contrast, Indo-ER
      significantly increased the bleeding time and inhibited platelet aggregation to
      COX-1-dependent agonists 6 hours after dosing. Clotting times were unaffected by 
      any drug. It was concluded that unlike nonselective NSAIDs, meloxicam's blockade 
      of TxA2 formation (even at supratherapeutic doses) does not reach levels that
      result in decreased in vivo platelet function, as measured by bleeding time and
      aggregometry. In this study of healthy subjects, meloxicam did not interfere with
      platelet-mediated hemostasis.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of intravenous parecoxib sodium in relieving acute
      postoperative pain following gynecologic laparotomy surgery.
PG  - 306-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study tested the hypothesis that an injectable cyclooxygenase
      (COX)-2-specific inhibitor will be at least as effective and well tolerated as a 
      COX-nonspecific conventional nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) by
      comparing the analgesic efficacy and tolerability of one intravenous dose of
      parecoxib sodium, an injectable prodrug of the novel COX-2-specific inhibitor,
      valdecoxib, with ketorolac and placebo in postoperative laparotomy surgery
      patients. Intravenous morphine, 4 mg, was studied as a positive analgesic
      control. METHODS: In this multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study, 
      women experiencing moderate-to-severe pain on the first day after abdominal
      hysterectomy or myomectomy received one intravenous dose of parecoxib sodium, 20 
      or 40 mg, ketorolac, 30 mg, morphine, 4 mg, or placebo. Analgesic efficacy and
      tolerability were evaluated for 24 h postdose or until patients, whose pain was
      not adequately controlled, opted to receive rescue analgesia. RESULTS: Two
      hundred two patients were enrolled. All treatment groups had comparable
      demographics and baseline pain status. All active treatments had an equally rapid
      time to onset of analgesia (10-23 min). Overall, each parecoxib sodium dose and
      ketorolac were significantly superior to morphine and placebo for most measures
      of analgesic efficacy at most time points, including a significantly longer (two-
      to threefold) time to rescue analgesia (P </= 0.05). All treatments were well
      tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Single intravenous doses of parecoxib sodium, 20 mg and
      40 mg, have comparable analgesic effects and are well tolerated after laparotomy 
      surgery. Parecoxib sodium appears to be as effective as intravenous ketorolac, 30
      mg, and superior to intravenous morphine, 4 mg.

TI  - Valdecoxib, a cyclooxygenase-2-specific inhibitor, is effective in treating
      primary dysmenorrhea.
PG  - 350-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of the cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-specific
      inhibitor valdecoxib with naproxen sodium in treating menstrual pain associated
      with primary dysmenorrhea. METHOD: This single-center, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover study compared the efficacy and safety 
      of single oral doses of valdecoxib 20 mg and 40 mg with naproxen sodium 550 mg,
      or placebo, with an option of treatment for up to 3 days, twice daily. Efficacy
      was assessed by time-weighted sum of total pain relief, sum of pain intensity
      difference, time-specific pain relief, and pain intensity difference over 12
      hours, time to rescue medication or first re-medication, the percentage of
      patients taking rescue medication, and patient's global evaluation of study
      medication. RESULTS: Mean time-weighted sum of total pain relief and sum of pain 
      intensity difference were significantly superior to placebo for the first 8 and
      12 hours after the initial dose of valdecoxib 20 mg (P <.01) and 40 mg (P <.001).
      Valdecoxib 20 mg and 40 mg were comparable to naproxen sodium 550 mg for all
      efficacy measures. Other differences in efficacy measures favoring the higher
      dose of valdecoxib did not achieve statistical significance, with the exception
      of sum of pain intensity difference-12. Both doses of valdecoxib were well
      tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Both valdecoxib 20- and 40-mg doses were effective and
      well tolerated for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea. Valdecoxib 20 mg and 40
      mg demonstrate analgesic efficacy, based on onset, magnitude, and duration of
      analgesia that is similar to naproxen sodium, making it a potential choice for
      treating women with primary dysmenorrhea.

AB  - We describe the case of a 77-year old mildly hypertensive woman with no
      underlying renal disease who was admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) in a
      comatose state with fever. The patient had been on low dose enalapril and a
      potassium rich diet. Five days before admission, rofecoxib, a new selective COX-2
      inhibitor nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), was added for leg pain.
      She was found to have severe hyperkalemia and died 90 min after her arrival. We
      cannot absolutely determine whether the COX-2 inhibitor was the dominant
      contributor to the development of hyperkalemia or the combination itself, with an
      intercurrent infection and some degree of dehydration. Physicians should be aware
      of this possible complication and only prescribe NSAIDs, including the new COX-2 
      drugs, to the elderly under close monitoring of kidney function and electrolyte
      tests.

TI  - Efficacy assessment of meloxicam, a preferential cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, in
      acute coronary syndromes without ST-segment elevation: the Nonsteroidal
      Anti-Inflammatory Drugs in Unstable Angina Treatment-2 (NUT-2) pilot study.
PG  - 191-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the use of heparin, aspirin, and other antiplatelet agents,
      acute coronary syndrome patients without ST-segment elevation remain at risk of
      cardiovascular thrombotic events. Given the role of inflammation in the
      pathogenesis of arterial thrombosis, we tested the hypothesis that the
      combination of meloxicam, a preferential COX-2 inhibitor, and heparin and aspirin
      would be superior to heparin and aspirin alone. METHODS AND RESULTS: In an
      open-label, randomized, prospective, single-blind pilot study, patients with
      acute coronary syndromes without ST-segment elevation were randomized to aspirin 
      and heparin treatment (n=60) or aspirin, heparin, and meloxicam (n=60) during
      coronary care unit stay. Patients then received aspirin or aspirin plus meloxicam
      for 30 days. During the coronary care unit stay, the primary outcomes variable of
      recurrent angina, myocardial infarction, or death was significantly lower in the 
      patients receiving meloxicam (15.0% versus 38.3%, P=0.007). The second composite 
      variable (coronary revascularization procedures, myocardial infarction, and
      death) was also significantly lower in meloxicam-treated patients (10.0% versus
      26.7%, P=0.034). At 90 days, the primary end point remained significantly lower
      in the meloxicam group (21.7% versus 48.3%, P=0.004), as did the secondary end
      point (13.3% versus 33.3%, P=0.015) and the need for revascularization alone
      (11.7% versus 30.0%, P=0.025). No adverse complications associated with the
      meloxicam treatment were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Meloxicam with heparin and
      aspirin was associated with significant reductions in adverse outcomes in acute
      coronary syndrome patients without ST-segment elevation. Additional larger trials
      are required to confirm the findings of this pilot study.

TI  - Rizatriptan combined with rofecoxib vs. rizatriptan for the acute treatment of
      migraine: an open label pilot study.
PG  - 309-12
AB  - Rizatriptan is an effective and fast acting drug for the acute treatment of
      migraine. As with any other acute treatment for migraine, headache recurrence may
      occur in up to one-third of responders. Combination with non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) seems to reduce the incidence of headache
      recurrence in clinical practice. Rofecoxib is a member of a new class of NSAIDs, 
      which selectively inhibits the COX-2 enzyme and therefore is associated with a
      lower risk of gastrointestinal side-effects; the drug has a long plasma half-life
      (17 h). This open label study compared rizatriptan with rizatriptan plus
      rofecoxib in the acute treatment of migraine. Fifty-six triptan naive patients
      from a tertiary centre (37 women and 19 men, ages 16-55 years, mean 35 years)
      with International Headache Society migraine were randomized into two groups.
      They were instructed to treat three consecutive moderate or severe attacks with
      either 10 mg rizatriptan (group 1: 18 women and 10 men) or with 10 mg rizatriptan
      plus 25 mg rofecoxib (group 2: 19 women and 9 men). The presence of headache and 
      nausea at 1, 2 and 4 h, and of side-effects, use of rescue medication and
      recurrence were compared. Fifty-four patients completed the study. Group 1
      treated 76 attacks and group 2 treated 81 attacks. Absence of headache at 1 h was
      seen in 19 attacks (25%) in group 1 and in 34 attacks (42%) in group 2 (P=0.082);
      at 2 h absence of headache was seen in 60% of group 1 attacks and in 76% of group
      2 attacks (P=0.115). At 4 h, 75% of group 1 attacks and 88% of group 2 attacks
      were pain free (P=0.122). With regard to nausea, of those who had nausea at
      baseline, 31% and 49% of attacks in groups 1 and 2, respectively, were nausea
      free at 1 h (P=0.091), 75% and 79% at 2 h (P=0.736) and 82% and 91% (P=0.479) at 
      4 h. Recurrence, based on all attacks of those patients who achieved pain free at
      4 h, was observed in 53% of group 1 and 20% of group 2 attacks (P<0.001).
      Sustained pain-free rates (for the 4-h time point) were 45.6% of group 1 and
      78.9% of group 2 attacks. There were no significant differences with regard to
      rescue medication consumption after 4 h and side-effects in both groups. There
      was a non-significant trend for the combination group to have a higher response
      rate. The group treated with rizatriptan and rofecoxib had a lower recurrence
      rate than the group treated with rizatriptan. This study demonstrated that
      combining a fast acting triptan such as rizatriptan with rofecoxib reduced
      headache recurrence rates, was well tolerated and may be more effective than the 
      use of rizatriptan alone. Double-blind, placebo-controlled studies are necessary 
      to confirm these observations.

TI  - Valdecoxib does not impair platelet function.
PG  - 275-81
AB  - The platelet effects of a supratherapeutic dose of the new cyclooxygenase (COX)-2
      specific inhibitor, valdecoxib (40 mg twice a day), naproxen 500 mg twice a day, 
      diclofenac 75 mg twice a day, and placebo were compared in 62 healthy adult
      subjects in this 7(1/2) day single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. 
      Platelet aggregation responses (to arachidonate [AA], collagen, and adenosine
      diphosphate [ADP]), bleeding time, and serum thromboxane B(2) (TxB(2))
      concentrations were measured at baseline and at regular intervals on days 1 and
      8. Valdecoxib had no effect on platelet function. Naproxen and diclofenac
      significantly reduced the platelet aggregation response to AA and to a lesser
      extent collagen and ADP at most assessments compared with placebo. Naproxen
      significantly lowered serum TxB(2) levels. In contrast to standard doses of 2
      nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), a supratherapeutic valdecoxib
      dosage does not impair platelet function (COX-1). Valdecoxib may be a safer
      analgesic option than conventional NSAIDs in patients for whom bleeding
      complications are a concern. (Am J Emerg Med 2002;20:275-281.

TI  - Renal failure associated with the use of celecoxib and rofecoxib.
PG  - 537-44
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Celecoxib and rofecoxib are two relatively new nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that selectively inhibit the cyclo-oxygenase-2
      (COX-2) isoenzyme at therapeutic concentrations. The nephrotoxic potential of
      selective COX-2 inhibitors has not been clearly established. This study was
      conducted in order to understand the association between acute renal failure and 
      the two COX-2 inhibitors celecoxib and rofecoxib. METHODS: A search was performed
      in the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System
      (AERS) to identify cases of renal failure submitted to the FDA. A MEDLINE search 
      of the English language literature was also performed to identify published cases
      of renal failure associated with celecoxib and rofecoxib. RESULTS: One hundred
      twenty-two and 142 domestic US cases of celecoxib and rofecoxib-associated renal 
      failure, respectively, were identified in the AERS database. The literature
      search identified 19 cases of acute renal impairment in association with
      celecoxib and rofecoxib. In addition, drug regulatory authorities in the UK,
      Canada, and Australia have received about 50 reports of renal failure with
      celecoxib and rofecoxib. Descriptive statistics of the AERS cases have been
      summarised in this report. CONCLUSIONS: Data from AERS and published case reports
      suggest that use of both these drugs is associated with renal effects similar to 
      that of conventional nonselective NSAIDs. Physicians should be aware that serious
      or life-threatening renal failure has been reported in patients with normal or
      impaired renal function after short-term therapy with celecoxib and rofecoxib.
      Patients at greatest risk for renal injury are those with pre-existing renal
      impairment, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and/or ACE
      inhibitors, and the elderly. Kidney function should be monitored closely for any 
      signs of potential renal injuries soon after initiating treatment with these
      agents, especially in high-risk populations. In addition, healthcare
      practitioners should adequately warn patients of the signs and symptoms of
      serious renal toxicity, and of the need for them to see their physician promptly 
      if they occur. Celecoxib and rofecoxib are not recommended for use in patients
      with advanced renal disease.

TI  - A comparison of the effects of nabumetone vs meloxicam on serum thromboxane B2
      and platelet function in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 644-7
AB  - AIMS: To compare the effects of nabumetone and meloxicam, two cyclo-oxygenase-2
      (COX-2) preferential nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), on platelet
      COX-1 activity and platelet function. METHODS: Twelve healthy volunteers (3 male,
      9 female, median age 22 years) participated in an open, randomized, cross-over
      trial of nabumetone 1000 mg twice daily vs meloxicam 7.5 mg twice daily during 1 
      week with 2 weeks wash-out. After a second 2 week wash-out period, one dose of
      indomethacin 50 mg was given as a positive control to check for NSAID induced
      inhibition of platelet function. COX-1 inhibition was measured as percentage
      inhibition of serum TXB2 generation in clotting whole blood, and as closure time 
      with use of the platelet function analyser PFA-100. Data are reported as median
      with range. Paired variables were analysed using Wilcoxons signed rank test.
      RESULTS: TXB2 levels decreased significantly after all three medications, but
      percentage inhibition after nabumetone and indomethacin (88% and 97%,
      respectively) was significantly higher than after meloxicam (63%) (P<0.05).
      Closure times increased significantly after administration of all three
      medications (P<0.05). Increases in closure time after administration did not
      differ between nabumetone and meloxicam (24% and 14%, respectively), but were
      significantly larger after indomethacin administration (63%) (P<0.01).
      CONCLUSIONS: In the maximum registered dosage, nabumetone inhibits thromboxane
      production much more than meloxicam, signifying less COX-2 selectivity of the
      former. However, both nabumetone and meloxicam cause only minor impairment in
      platelet function in comparison with indomethacin and the difference between them
      is not significant.

TI  - Celecoxib-induced acute interstitial nephritis.
PG  - 1313-7
AB  - Data about the nephrotoxicity of selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors are still 
      evolving. Acute interstitial nephritis is a well-described complication of
      therapy with nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. We report a case 
      of biopsy-proven acute interstitial nephritis in a 73-year-old diabetic woman,
      who had taken celecoxib for more than 1 year before presentation. She presented
      with clinical findings of subnephrotic proteinuria and acute renal failure that
      required dialysis. She recovered renal function with cessation of celecoxib
      therapy after 2 weeks. Other medications were reintroduced safely, without
      recurrence of renal failure. A kidney biopsy specimen showed acute interstitial
      nephritis with a prominent eosinophilic infiltrate in the interstitium. This case
      documents the occurrence of acute interstitial nephritis with celecoxib and
      emphasizes the need for continued vigilance and care in use of cyclooxygenase-2
      inhibitors in high-risk patients.

      celecoxib, an immunomodulatory drug, in schizophrenic patients to evaluate its
      therapeutic effects. METHOD: In a prospective, double-blind evaluation, 50
      patients with an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia were randomly assigned to
      either risperidone plus celecoxib or risperidone plus placebo. After a washout
      period, 25 patients received 2-6 mg/day of risperidone plus placebo and 25
      received risperidone plus 400 mg/day of celecoxib for 5 weeks. The treatment
      effect was calculated by analysis of covariance. There were no significant
      differences between groups in age, sex, duration or severity of disease or
      psychopathology, or risperidone dose or plasma level. RESULTS: Over 5 weeks, both
      groups of patients showed significant improvement in scores on the Positive and
      Negative Syndrome Scale and on all subscales. However, the celecoxib group showed
      significantly greater improvement in the total score. CONCLUSIONS: Additional
      treatment with celecoxib has significant positive effects on the therapeutic
      action of risperidone with regard to total schizophrenia psychopathology.
      Moreover, the fact that treatment with an immunomodulatory drug showed beneficial
      effects on schizophrenia symptoms indicates that immune dysfunction in
      schizophrenia is not just an epiphenomenon but is related to the pathomechanism
      of the disorder. However, a nonimmunological therapeutic effect of celecoxib
      mediated by the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor has to be taken into account.

TI  - Efficacy of celecoxib in treating symptoms of viral pharyngitis: a double-blind, 
      randomized study of celecoxib versus diclofenac.
PG  - 185-94
AB  - This study compared the efficacy and safety of the cyclooxygenase-2 specific
      inhibitor celecoxib with the conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug
      diclofenac in the symptomatic treatment of viral pharyngitis. Adult patients from
      27 study centers in Latin America were treated with oral doses of celecoxib 200
      mg once daily or 200 mg twice daily, or diclofenac 75 mg twice daily for 5 days
      in a double-blind, randomized study. The primary efficacy assessment was 'Throat 
      Pain on Swallowing' on day 3. In addition, secondary quality-of-life assessments 
      were performed on days 3 and 5. All adverse events and treatment-emergent signs
      and symptoms were recorded. Data from 313 patients were evaluable for efficacy
      (105 celecoxib 200 mg once daily, 107 celecoxib 200 mg twice daily, 101
      diclofenac 75 mg twice daily). The upper 95% confidence limits for the visual
      analog scale of 'Throat Pain on Swallowing' on day 3 for celecoxib 200 mg once
      daily relative to diclofenac 75 mg twice daily, and celecoxib 200 mg twice daily 
      relative to diclofenac 75 mg twice daily were 9.26 and 7.83, respectively. All
      secondary efficacy and quality-of-life measures were clinically similar for the
      three treatment groups, and no statistically significant differences were
      detected. The incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events and withdrawals due
      to adverse events were similar for all groups, but numerically higher among
      patients taking diclofenac than celecoxib. More patients in the diclofenac group 
      reported gastrointestinal complaints (7.3%) compared with those in the celecoxib 
      groups (4.3% in the celecoxib 200 mg once-daily group and 3.4% in the celecoxib
      200 mg twice-daily group). In conclusion, 5 days of treatment with celecoxib 200 
      mg once daily is as effective as diclofenac 75 mg twice daily in the symptomatic 
      treatment of viral pharyngitis. Celecoxib 200 mg once daily is also as effective 
      as celecoxib 200 mg twice daily in this condition.

TI  - Increase in lifetime adverse drug reactions, service utilization, and disease
      severity among patients who will start COX-2 specific inhibitors: quantitative
      assessment of channeling bias and confounding by indication in 6689 patients with
      rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.
PG  - 1015-22
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Nonrandom assignment of therapy in observational studies and clinical 
      practice can be accompanied by channeling bias and confounding by indication.
      This in turn can lead to unreliable conclusions about treatment effectiveness.
      Although widely acknowledged as important, no studies in rheumatology have
      measured the extent of these biases. We identified variables contributing to
      confounding and investigated the strength of the confounding effect. Analytical
      methods (propensity scores) are available to mitigate the effect of nonrandom
      assignment if the full extent of confounding can be understood. METHODS: A
      population of 6637 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis
      (OA) from the practices of 433 US rheumatologists completed 2 sets of detailed
      questionnaires concerning (1) the last 6 months in 1998 and (2) the first 6
      months of 1999, generally prior to and after the release of celecoxib and
      rofecoxib. Patients who received the COX-2 specific inhibitors in period 2 were
      identified (n = 1517), and their characteristics were compared to the 5120 who
      did not start a new COX-2 specific inhibitor during Period 1. RESULTS: Patients
      starting a new COX-2 specific inhibitor had a greater lifetime history of adverse
      reactions of all kinds, but particularly gastrointestinal adverse drug reactions.
      They also had more severe scores for pain, functional disability, fatigue,
      helplessness, and global severity, and they used more inpatient and outpatients
      services than patients who would not switch to COX-2 specific inhibitors.
      CONCLUSION: Confounding by indication and channeling bias result in an overall
      increase in severity of about 25% for the above measures. Observational studies
      should account for these biases by a broadly defined propensity score that
      includes the variables identified in this report. These observations are germane 
      to observational studies of disease modifying antirheumatic drugs and biologics, 
      as well, and suggest the need for careful control of confounders when assessing
      treatment effects in rheumatic disease observational studies.

TI  - Comparison of the analgesic efficacy of rofecoxib and enteric-coated diclofenac
      sodium in the treatment of postoperative dental pain: a randomized,
      placebo-controlled clinical trial.
PG  - 490-503
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rofecoxib is a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor indicated for the
      treatment of acute pain, with similar analgesic efficacy to ibuprofen and
      naproxen sodium. Diclofenac sodium is the most commonly prescribed nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drug worldwide; it is effective for the treatment of pain as
      well as the signs and symptoms associated with the painful conditions of
      osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to 
      compare the analgesic efficacy and tolerability of a single dose of rofecoxib 50 
      mg, 3 doses of enteric-coated diclofenac sodium 50 mg, and placebo over 8-hour
      and 24-hour periods in patients with moderate to severe pain after oral surgery. 
      METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo- and active comparator-controlled,
      parallel-group study, patients experiencing moderate to severe pain after the
      surgical extraction of > or = 2 third molars were randomized to receive a single 
      dose of rofecoxib 50 mg, 3 doses of enteric-coated diclofenac sodium 50 mg (50 mg
      given every 8 hours), or placebo. Patients rated pain intensity, pain relief, and
      global assessments at prespecified times throughout the 24-hour period after
      initial dosing. Overall analgesic efficacy was determined by total pain relief
      over 8 hours (TOPAR8) and 24 hours (TOPAR24) and patient global assessments at 8 
      and 24 hours. Onset of analgesic effect was determined by using the 2-stopwatch
      method for confirmed perceptible pain relief. Peak analgesic effect was the
      maximum pain relief attained during the first 8 hours. The duration of analgesic 
      effect was determined by median time to rescue analgesia use. RESULTS: A total of
      305 patients were randomized to treatment: 121 received rofecoxib, 121 received
      diclofenac sodium, and 63 received placebo. The baseline demographics were
      similar among the groups. Overall, 61.3% experienced moderate pain and 38.7%
      experienced severe pain; 53.1% were female; and the mean age was 23.4 years. The 
      overall analgesic efficacy, as assessed by TOPAR8, of a single dose of rofecoxib 
      50 mg was significantly greater than a single dose of enteric-coated diclofenac
      sodium 50 mg (20.5 vs 8.2) and placebo (20.5 vs 5.9). Patient global assessment
      at 8 hours was also significantly better for rofecoxib compared with
      enteric-coated diclofenac sodium and placebo. TOPAR24 was significantly greater
      for a single dose of rofecoxib 50 mg compared with 3 doses of enteric-coated
      diclofenac sodium 50 mg (64.1 vs 25.1) and placebo (64.1 vs 19.2). At 24 hours,
      the patient global assessment for rofecoxib was significantly better than that
      achieved with enteric-coated diclofenac sodium and placebo. The onset of
      analgesic effect was significantly more rapid for rofecoxib than for
      enteric-coated diclofenac sodium and placebo (median times: 31 minutes, >4 hours,
      and >4 hours, respectively). The peak analgesic effect was significantly greater 
      for rofecoxib compared with enteric-coated diclofenac sodium (3.2 vs 1.5) and
      placebo (3.2 vs 1.1). The duration of analgesia was significantly longer for
      rofecoxib than enteric-coated diclofenac sodium (median times: >24 hours vs 1
      hour and 37 minutes) and placebo (>24 hours vs 1 hour and 37 minutes).
      Enteric-coated diclofenac sodium was numerically greater than placebo for the key
      end points measuring overall efficacy (total pain relief and patient global
      assessment), but diclofenac sodium did not provide as much analgesic effect as
      expected for a drug effective for pain, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis 
      and did not differ significantly from placebo. Overall, both rofecoxib and
      enteric-coated diclofenac sodium were generally well tolerated, although the
      rofecoxib group had a significantly lower incidence of clinical and drug-related 
      adverse events than the enteric-coated diclofenac sodium group. CONCLUSIONS: A
      single 50-mg dose of rofecoxib provided greater overall analgesic efficacy over 8
      hours, more rapid onset of analgesia, greater maximum analgesic effect, and
      longer duration of effect than a single 50-mg dose of enteric-coated diclofenac
      sodium in patients with moderate to severe pain associated with oral surgery.
      Compared with 3 doses of enteric-coated diclofenac sodium 50 mg (50 mg every 8
      hours), a single dose of rofecoxib 50 mg provided greater overall analgesic
      efficacy over 24 hours.

TI  - Celecoxib-induced erythema multiforme with glyburide cross-reactivity.
PG  - 637-40
AB  - Erythema multiforme is an acute inflammatory skin reaction that often is caused
      by drugs, especially sulfonamides and their derivatives. Celecoxib, a
      cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, is a sulfonamide derivative commonly prescribed to
      treat arthritis in patients who cannot tolerate or who have a contraindication
      for taking traditional nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents. A 57-year-old man
      with a previously undocumented sulfa allergy experienced an allergic skin
      reaction and had difficulty breathing secondary to throat swelling. His condition
      was believed to be erythema multiforme associated with the introduction of
      celecoxib into his drug regimen. His drug therapy was discontinued, but a
      subsequent reaction occurred when the sulfonamide derivative glyburide was
      reintroduced. It is important for clinicians to obtain a careful history and
      perform a thorough medical evaluation in all patients receiving sulfonamides and 
      their derivatives, as a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction may be
      prevented.

TI  - A randomised, double blind, placebo controlled study of celecoxib, a selective
      cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, on duodenal polyposis in familial adenomatous
      polyposis.
PG  - 857-60
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-selective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors (non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs) inhibit large bowel carcinogenesis in patients with
      familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Their role in the duodenum of these
      patients is less certain. The disease modifying activity of specific COX-2
      inhibitors has not been explored in humans. Patients and methods: This was a
      randomised, double blind, placebo controlled study of celecoxib (100 mg twice
      daily (n=34) or 400 mg twice daily (n=32)) versus placebo (n=17), given orally
      twice daily for six months to patients with FAP. Efficacy was assessed
      qualitatively by blinded review of shuffled endoscopy videotapes comparing the
      extent of duodenal polyposis at entry and at six months and quantitatively by
      measurement of the percentage change in duodenal area covered by discrete and
      plaque-like adenomas from photographs of high and low density polyposis. RESULTS:
      Shuffled and blinded video review showed a statistically significant effect of
      400 mg twice daily celecoxib compared with placebo treatment (p=0.033) with all
      five independent observers scoring a beneficial effect. Overall, patients taking 
      celecoxib 400 mg twice daily showed a 14.5% reduction in involved areas compared 
      with a 1.4% for placebo (p=0.436). However, patients with clinically significant 
      disease at baseline (greater than 5% covered by polyps) showed a 31% reduction in
      involved areas with celecoxib 400 mg twice daily compared with 8% on placebo
      (p=0.049). CONCLUSIONS: A panel of five endoscopists found a significant
      reduction in duodenal polyposis after six months of treatment with celecoxib 400 
      mg twice daily. COX-2 inhibition may help this otherwise untreatable condition.

TI  - Migratory pulmonary infiltrates in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis.
PG  - 465-7
AB  - The case history is described of an elderly man with rheumatoid arthritis
      receiving treatment with sulfasalazine and the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor
      celecoxib who presented with severe shortness of breath, cough, and decreased
      exercise tolerance. The chest radiograph showed unilateral alveolo-interstitial
      infiltrates and a biopsy specimen of the lung parenchyma showed changes
      consistent with acute eosinophilic pneumonia. Antibiotic treatment was
      unsuccessful, but treatment with steroids and discontinuation of sulfasalazine
      and celecoxib resulted in a marked clinical improvement confirmed by arterial
      blood gas analysis. The condition may have developed as an adverse reaction
      either to sulfasalazine or to celecoxib, although hypersensitivity to the latter 
      has not previously been reported.

TI  - Intraoral chilling versus oral sumatriptan for acute migraine.
PG  - 357-61
AB  - Migraine pathophysiology is associated with a dural inflammation. Recent evidence
      suggests that the primary inflammation occurs in a maxillary nerve segment,
      accessible intraorally. Local tenderness, related to symptom laterality, has been
      palpated consistently in asymptomatic migraine patients, and significant migraine
      relief has been obtained from chilling confined to this area. Thirty-five
      symptomatic episodic migraine patients were enrolled in this study, comparing 40 
      minutes of bilateral intraoral chilling, 50 mg of oral sumatriptan, and 40
      minutes of sham (tongue) chilling. Hollow metal tubes chilled by circulating ice 
      water were held in the maxillary molar periapical areas by the patient. Pain and 
      nausea were recorded at baseline and 1, 2, 4, and 24 hours after start of
      treatment, using a numeric symptom-relief scale. Significant mean headache relief
      was obtained by maxillary chilling and sumatriptan at all four time intervals,
      with poor relief obtained by placebo. Maxillary chilling was more effective than 
      sumatriptan at all four time intervals. Significant nausea relief was obtained by
      maxillary chilling and sumatriptan at posttreatment and 2 and 4 hours later. At
      24 hours, some headache and nausea recurrence was noted with sumatriptan. The
      repeated-measures analysis of variance indicated that both treatments, drug (P = 
      0.024) and maxillary chilling (P = 0.001), reduced the headache, as compared with
      the control group. Tenderness suggests local inflammation associated with
      vasodilatation and edema. Because chilling can resolve local edema, these
      findings raise the possibility that an intraoral inflammation may be a factor in 
      migraine etiology.

TI  - The efficacy of premedication with celecoxib and acetaminophen in preventing pain
      after otolaryngologic surgery.
PG  - 1188-93, table of contents
AB  - Non-opioid analgesics are often used to supplement opioids for the management of 
      perioperative pain. In this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study,
      we examined the effects of acetaminophen and a cyclooxygenase type-2 inhibitor,
      celecoxib, when administered alone or in combination, before elective
      otolaryngologic surgery in 112 healthy outpatients. Subjects were assigned to 1
      of 4 study groups: Group 1, placebo (vitamin C, 500 mg per os [PO]); Group 2,
      acetaminophen 2000 mg PO; Group 3, celecoxib 200 mg PO; or Group 4, acetaminophen
      2000 mg and celecoxib 200 mg PO. All patients received a standardized anesthetic 
      technique. During the postoperative period, pain was assessed using a 10-point
      verbal rating scale. Recovery times, the need for rescue analgesics, side
      effects, and patient satisfaction scores were also recorded. The combination of
      acetaminophen and celecoxib was significantly more effective than placebo in
      reducing postoperative pain. Celecoxib, when administered alone or in combination
      with acetaminophen, improved patients' satisfaction with their postoperative
      analgesia. With the combination of acetaminophen and celecoxib, an additional
      expenditure of $6.16 would be required to obtain complete satisfaction with
      postoperative pain management in one additional patient who would not have been
      completely satisfied if he/she had received the placebo. However, oral celecoxib 
      or acetaminophen alone was not significantly more effective than placebo in
      reducing postoperative pain when administered before surgery. We conclude that
      oral premedication with a combination of acetaminophen (2000 mg) and celecoxib
      (200 mg) was highly effective in decreasing pain and improving patient
      satisfaction after outpatient surgery. IMPLICATIONS: Oral premedication with a
      combination of acetaminophen (2000 mg) and celecoxib (200 mg) was effective in
      decreasing pain and improving patient satisfaction after otolaryngologic surgery.
      However, acetaminophen (2000 mg) or celecoxib (200 mg) alone was not
      significantly more effective than placebo in reducing postoperative pain.

TI  - Effects of celecoxib on ambulatory blood pressure in hypertensive patients on ACE
      inhibitors.
PG  - 929-34
AB  - Nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents have been shown to attenuate
      the antihypertensive efficacy of ACE inhibitors with average increases in
      systolic blood pressure (BP) of 5 to 10 mm Hg. Less is known about the specific
      cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors now widely used for the treatment of
      arthritis. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of celecoxib 
      compared with placebo on 24-hour BP levels in ACE inhibitor-treated patients with
      hypertension. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group clinical trial involving 178 men and women (mean age, 53 years)
      with essential hypertension who were treated and controlled with lisinopril
      monotherapy (10 to 40 mg daily). Baseline BP values were obtained using 24-hour
      ambulatory recordings. Patients received either celecoxib, 200 mg twice daily
      (twice the recommended dose for osteoarthritis) (n=91), or placebo (n=87) for 4
      weeks, and changes in the 24-hour BP, body weight, and clinical laboratory
      parameters were assessed. Mean changes from baseline in the 24-hour systolic and 
      diastolic BP were 2.6/1.5+/-0.9/0.6 mm Hg on celecoxib versus 1.0/0.3+/-1/0.6 mm 
      Hg on placebo (P=0.34 for systolic BP; P=0.45 for diastolic BP). The proportion
      of patients whose 24-hour BP increased by at least 5, 10, 15, or 20 mm Hg were
      also similar on celecoxib and placebo. No changes in body weight, serum
      creatinine, or potassium occurred in either group. Thus, these data demonstrate
      that high doses of celecoxib have no significant effect on the antihypertensive
      effect of the ACE inhibitor lisinopril. The placebo-subtracted changes observed
      in 24-hour BP (1.6/1.2 mm Hg) are less than what has been reported for
      nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents in ACE inhibitor-treated
      patients.

TI  - Platelet function is inhibited by non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs but not by cyclo-oxygenase-2-selective inhibitors in patients with
      rheumatoid arthritis.
PG  - 458-61
AB  - BACKGROUND: Interaction with platelet function by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs (NSAIDs) is related to the inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase-1 (COX-1). In
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), only one of the COX-2-selective NSAIDs
      (nabumetone) has been demonstrated to spare platelet function partially.
      OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of the COX-2-selective inhibitor, meloxicam,
      with those of the non-selective NSAID, naproxen, on platelet function and
      thromboxane levels in RA patients. METHODS: In this randomized, controlled,
      cross-over trial, 10 RA patients used meloxicam 7.5 mg bid and naproxen 500 mg
      bid, each during a 2-week period. Washout periods were applied. Before and after 
      each 2-week period of NSAID intake, laboratory studies were performed. RESULTS:
      Platelet aggregation was significantly less influenced, thromboxane levels were
      less inhibited (246 vs 117 pg/ml) and bleeding times were less prolonged with
      meloxicam than with naproxen (3.2 vs 2.3 min). Moreover, the results of all tests
      during meloxicam exposure were comparable with baseline values. CONCLUSION: In RA
      patients, meloxicam, a representative of the selective COX-2 inhibitors, does not
      interfere with platelet function and thromboxane levels, in contrast with
      naproxen (a non-selective COX inhibitor).

TI  - Evaluation of preoperative administration of the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor
      rofecoxib for the treatment of postoperative pain after lumbar disc surgery.
PG  - 1053-7; discussion 1057-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A combination of analgesics with different mechanisms of action may
      improve postoperative pain control and reduce the incidence of side effects. This
      study was designed to assess the efficacy of preoperative administration of
      rofecoxib (Vioxx; Merck & Co., Inc., Somerset, NJ) in reducing pain and opioid
      requirements after single-level lumbar microdiscectomy. METHODS: A randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed on 61 consenting
      patients who were considered American Society of Anesthesiologists Class I or II 
      and who were scheduled for elective single-level lumbar microdiscectomy. Patients
      received either two doses of rofecoxib 50 mg or a placebo preoperatively. The
      outcome measures included morphine use in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU),
      discharge times, and side effect profile. Data were analyzed by use of
      independent sample t tests for continuous variables or chi(2) tests for
      categorical variables. A P value of <0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS:
      The two groups were comparable with respect to patient characteristics,
      intraoperative opioid and hypnotic consumption, and duration of surgery. Patients
      in the rofecoxib group required significantly less morphine postoperatively.
      Significantly more patients in the placebo group reported pain scores greater
      than 7 at admission to the PACU. Time to first request for analgesia was shorter 
      in the placebo group, but the difference did not reach statistical significance. 
      There were no significant differences between groups in the incidence of nausea, 
      time to discharge from the PACU, or hospital stay. CONCLUSION: Preoperative
      rofecoxib is effective in reducing postoperative narcotic consumption in patients
      undergoing lumbar laminectomy. The use of rofecoxib does not shorten PACU length 
      of stay or hospital discharge time. These outcome measures depend on multiple
      administrative factors.

PG  - 203-5
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Celecoxib (Celebrex(R)) is a new generation non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drug, recently introduced in France. We report a maculopapular 
      rash due to this drug with positive patch-tests. CASE REPORT: A forty year-old
      man received with 3 tablets/day of celecoxib for intercostal pain. Nine days
      after initiation of treatment a maculopapular rash appeared. At the end of
      treatment, the eruption persisted for two days, then rapidly improved within one 
      week. Six weeks later, patch-tests with celecoxib diluted at 20 p. 100 in
      petrolatum were positive at 48 hours. DISCUSSION: Cutaneous reactions due to
      celecoxib are rare. In our case report, the delay, clinical aspect, improvement
      on withdrawal of treatment and positive patch test all emphasize the imputability
      of celecoxib. We wish to underline the possible cutaneous reactions with this new
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug.

TI  - Dyspepsia tolerability from the patients' perspective: a comparison of celecoxib 
      with diclofenac.
PG  - 819-27
AB  - AIM: To compare celecoxib (800 mg/day, n=1997) with diclofenac (150 mg/day,
      n=1996) on dyspepsia-related tolerability. METHODS: In one of the two protocols
      comprising the Celecoxib Long-Term Arthritis Safety Study, a randomized
      double-blind trial, patients completed the Severity of Dyspepsia Assessment
      Questionnaire at baseline and at weeks 4, 13, 26 and 52 for the following three
      scales: Pain Intensity, Non-Pain Symptoms and Satisfaction with Dyspepsia-Related
      Health. RESULTS: For the Pain Intensity scale, patients given diclofenac had
      significantly higher (worsening dyspepsia) mean changes, defined as follow-up
      minus baseline, than patients given celecoxib (P < 0.001, at all assessments).
      The mean changes in the Pain Intensity scale (scale, 2-47; higher score is higher
      pain intensity) were 0.99 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.50, 1.48) for
      celecoxib and 2.76 (95% CI: 2.28, 3.25) for diclofenac at 4 weeks. Satisfaction
      was superior with celecoxib at all assessments (P < 0.001). At 4 weeks, the mean 
      changes in the Satisfaction scale (scale, 7-35; higher score is higher
      satisfaction) were 0.02 (95% CI: - 0.26, 0.29) for celecoxib and - 0.72 (95% CI: 
      - 1.00, - 0.45) for diclofenac. Diclofenac patients had significantly higher
      Non-Pain Symptoms at 4 weeks (P=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Celecoxib, at two to four
      times the recommended dose, demonstrated a superior dyspepsia-related
      tolerability and satisfaction compared with standard dosages of diclofenac.

TI  - Aseptic meningitis associated with rofecoxib.
PG  - 713-5
AB  - Rofecoxib is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that is reported to act by
      selectively inhibiting cyclooxygenase-2. A review and analysis of reports sent to
      the Spontaneous Reporting System of the Food and Drug Administration, Rockville, 
      Md, suggest that aseptic meningitis is associated with rofecoxib use. To our
      knowledge, there have been no published reports of aseptic meningitis occurring
      in association with rofecoxib use to date. We report 5 serious cases of aseptic
      meningitis associated with rofecoxib use.

TI  - Gastroprotective therapy and risk of gastrointestinal ulcers: risk reduction by
      COX-2 therapy.
PG  - 467-73
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) and misoprostol decrease the risk of
      development of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug induced gastric ulcers and aid 
      healing of upper gastrointestinal (GI) ulcers. H2 receptor antagonists (H2RA) are
      less effective for this task, but are widely used by patients and physicians for 
      the treatment of GI symptoms and duodenal ulcers. Sucralfate is a weaker agent
      that is sometimes used for prophylaxis or treatment of upper GI ulcers. We
      investigated the effect of GI drugs and selective and nonselective NSAID on the
      incidence of GI ulcer development in a cohort of patients immediately after the
      release of celecoxib and rofecoxib to investigate the effect of confounding by
      indication when effective GI agents and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2)-specific
      inhibitors are prescribed to a high risk population. METHODS: During a 6 month
      period of observation 8547 NSAID users were evaluated by mailed questionnaire
      concerning NSAID drug use and ulcer development. In the first half of 1999,
      patients took 12,177 separate NSAID courses. GI therapy that followed the
      development of upper GI ulcers was excluded from analysis. Ulcer reports were
      confirmed by followup validation. RESULTS: GI drugs were used concomitantly in
      this population by 42% of patients using an NSAID. GI drugs were associated with 
      an increased risk of ulcer. But this risk was confined to PPI (OR 4.1, 95% CI
      2.95, 5.69), and not to other GI drugs. Overall, patients using nonselective
      NSAID compared to those taking COX-2-specific inhibitors had an increased risk of
      upper GI ulcers (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.43, 3.34). Patients taking nonselective NSAID 
      plus PPI were also at increased risk for upper GI ulcers compared to those taking
      nonselective NSAID alone (OR 5.09. 95% CI 3.88, 6.67). Similarly, the risk of
      upper GI ulcers was increased in the nonselective NSAID plus PPI group (OR 3.83, 
      95% CI 2.32, 6.31) compared to the COX-2 plus PPI group. CONCLUSION: PPI use, but
      not other GI drug use, is a marker for increased susceptibility to ulcers among
      NSAID users. This risk of upper GI ulcers is increased in PPI users regardless of
      which NSAID is used (nonselective or COX-2-specific inhibitor). Although COX-2
      use is associated with greater risk factors for upper GI ulcers due to channeling
      bias, COX-2 users have significantly fewer ulcers than equivalent nonselective
      NSAID users regardless of concomitant PPI utilization.

TI  - Rofecoxib: a possible cause of acute colitis.
PG  - 451-3
AB  - Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents may cause relevant small bowel and colonic
      side effects, apart from gastroduodenal lesions. The synthesis of selective
      cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors has been an important breakthrough in
      antiinflammatory therapy by decreasing the incidence of upper gastrointestinal
      lesions. However, there is little information available concerning their effects 
      on gut mucosa distally to the duodenum. A case history is described of a
      52-year-old woman with a temporary colostomy after resection of a sigmoid tumor
      and who presented with bloody diarrhea 5 days after beginning therapy with
      rofecoxib. The hemorrhage had its origin in the transverse colon, and the
      endoscopic appearance was that of actively bleeding acute hemorrhagic colitis. No
      other colonic lesions were detected, nor was there any evidence of related
      infection, bleeding diathesis, or other systemic diseases. On discontinuing
      rofecoxib and instituting parenteral rehydration, the bleeding and diarrhea
      stopped. Endoscopic follow-up revealed regenerating mucosa in the transverse
      colon. The time relation, the absence of other causes of hemorrhage, and the
      clinical evolution all strongly support the probability of a causal relation
      between rofecoxib and hemorrhagic colitis. This case may raise awareness
      concerning the possibility of colonic lesions related to the new COX-2
      inhibitors, similar to what is known about nonselective antiinflammatory agents.

TI  - Valdecoxib is more efficacious than rofecoxib in relieving pain associated with
      oral surgery.
PG  - 89-97
AB  - Inhibition of the cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 enzyme has been shown previously to
      reduce pain and inflammation. Valdecoxib is a new highly selective COX-2
      inhibitor with a rapid onset of action and significant analgesic properties. This
      study compared the analgesic efficacy of valdecoxib and rofecoxib in treating
      postoperative pain in patients undergoing oral surgery. This randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study compared the efficacy of 40 mg valdecoxib 
      with that of 50 mg rofecoxib and placebo. Efficacy was assessed by the onset of
      analgesia, pain intensity levels, and pain relief over 24 hours, time-weighted
      sum of total pain, sum of pain intensity difference, the percentage of patients
      requiring rescue medication and experiencing regimen failure, and patients'
      global evaluation. Patients receiving valdecoxib experienced a significantly
      quicker onset of analgesia, significantly improved pain relief, and lower pain
      intensity compared with patients receiving rofecoxib and greater satisfaction
      with their study medication after a single dose. Valdecoxib also demonstrated
      efficacy that was superior to that of rofecoxib with respect to the percentage of
      patients requiring rescue medication or experiencing regimen failure (p < or
      =.05). Valdecoxib, rofecoxib, and placebo were equally well tolerated. This study
      demonstrates that valdecoxib provides significantly greater analgesic efficacy
      than rofecoxib in the management of pain after oral surgery.

TI  - Fatal allergic vasculitis associated with celecoxib.
PG  - 852-3
AB  - We report on the occurrence of a rare and as yet unforseeable adverse reaction to
      treatment with celecoxib, a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective, non-steroidal,
      anti-inflammatory drug. A previously healthy adult suffered fatal acute multiple 
      organ failure presumably after diffuse allergic vasculitis with diffuse necrotic 
      purpura. Although no conclusive proof is available, such a reaction could have
      been triggered by at least one of two mechanisms: an allergic reaction linked to 
      the chemical structure of celecoxib; or an interaction of the drug with synthesis
      of endothelial eiconasoids leading to an imbalance between vasoactive end
      products, resulting in widespread rise to local thrombosis.

TI  - Limitation of the in vitro whole blood assay for predicting the COX selectivity
      of NSAIDs in clinical use.
PG  - 255-65
AB  - AIMS: To assess if the inhibitory potency of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
      (NSAIDs) on cyclooxygenase (COX) isoenzymes, when given therapeutically in
      humans, can be predicted from their in vitro concentration-response curves using 
      the whole blood assay. METHODS: Twenty-four healthy male volunteers aged 20--27
      years were recruited. Inhibition of blood COX isoenzymes was determined in vitro 
      before any drug intake and ex vivo after single and repeated intake of either 7.5
      mg meloxicam once, 400 mg ibuprofen three times daily or 75 mg diclofenac SR
      once, taken in a randomized cross-over design. Production of thromboxane B2
      (TXB2) during clotting and of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) during endotoxin exposure
      served as indicators of platelet COX-1 and monocyte COX-2 activity, respectively.
      Drugs were determined in plasma by h.p.l.c., with a chiral separation of
      ibuprofen and free fractions after equilibrium dialysis. RESULTS: Intra-subject
      variation for COX-1 and COX-2 at baseline was at 26 +/- 18% and 18 +/- 13%
      respectively, and intersubject variation at 39% and 36%, respectively. The ratios
      of IC50s and, at best, of IC80s revealed diclofenac and meloxicam as selective
      COX-2 inhibitors and ibuprofen as a preferential COX-1 inhibitor in vitro.
      However, after oral intake, ibuprofen inhibited ex vivo COX-2 by 80% whereas
      diclofenac inhibited COX-1 by 70%. Meloxicam inhibited COX-1 from 30 to 55%
      depending on the repetition of the dose and increase in plasma concentrations.
      Using in vitro dose--response curves, the in vivo inhibitory potency of
      diclofenac was estimated adequately from its circulating concentration ([-0.18,
      0.21] for COX-1 and [-0.13, -0.03] for COX-2) but this was not the case for
      ibuprofen on COX-2 ([-0.14, 0.27]) and meloxicam on COX-1 ([0.31, 1.05]). The
      limited predictability of the system was not improved through considering the
      unbound fraction of the drugs or the variable chiral inversion of ibuprofen.
      CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of COX-2 selectivity based on in vitro studies and
      pharmacological modelling has a limited clinical relevance. There is a need to
      investigate COX selectivity at therapeutic plasma concentrations of NSAIDs using 
      the ex vivo whole blood assay.

TI  - Gingival crevicular fluid matrix metalloproteinase-8 levels following adjunctive 
      use of meloxicam and initial phase of periodontal therapy.
PG  - 103-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present study was to assess the effects of
      adjunctive meloxicam on the matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8) levels of gingival
      crevicular fluid (GCF) in chronic periodontitis patients following the initial
      phase of periodontal therapy. METHODS: Twelve chronic periodontitis patients
      received 7.5 mg meloxicam, and 10 patients received placebo tablets together with
      scaling and root planing in a 1 x 1 regimen for 10 days. Scaling and root planing
      were performed on day 3 of drug intake. The MMP-8 levels in GCF samples obtained 
      before and on day 10 of drug intake were determined by using the
      immunofluorescence assay. Plaque index (PI), papilla bleeding index (PBI), and
      GCF MMP-8 levels were compared within each patient group, between the 2 patient
      groups, and also with a clinically healthy control group using non-parametric
      statistical analyses. RESULTS: Both meloxicam and placebo groups showed
      statistically significant reductions in PBI, PI, and GCF MMP-8 levels on day 10
      compared to baseline (P<0.01). The GCF MMP-8 level on day 10 in the meloxicam
      group was similar to the clinically healthy control group (P>0.05), while it was 
      significantly higher in the placebo group (P<0.01). Positive correlations were
      found between MMP-8 total amounts and PBI scores at baseline and day 10 of drug
      intake in the patient groups. CONCLUSIONS: Meloxicam showed a tendency to reduce 
      GCF MMP-8 levels in vivo within the first 10 days when used as an adjunct in the 
      initial phase of periodontal treatment that consists of scaling and root planing.
      Verification of this effect on collagenase-2 downregulation, as well as on the
      clinical periodontal parameters in long-term studies using larger test and
      control groups, is needed to provide further support for the adjunctive use of
      selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors in the treatment of chronic
      periodontitis.

TI  - Quality of life in chronic NSAID users: a comparison of the effect of omeprazole 
      and misoprostol.
PG  - 328-34
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the impact on quality of life (QoL) of omeprazole and
      misoprostol during healing, and omeprazole, misoprostol, and placebo during
      maintenance treatment in chronic NSAID users with NSAID-associated gastroduodenal
      lesions. METHODS: Validated baseline and follow-up QoL questionnaires were
      completed by 610 patients (healing: after 4/8 weeks; maintenance: after 6
      months). RESULTS: Patients with arthritis being treated with NSAIDs have a poor
      QoL. Rheumatoid arthritis causes more joint problems and physical mobility
      limitations than osteoarthritis. Chronic NSAID use causes heartburn and
      dyspepsia. QoL improved on both treatments (about equally on two general QOL
      scales), but omeprazole relieved gastrointestinal symptoms more than misoprostol,
      particularly reflux, abdominal pain and indigestion symptoms. During maintenance,
      both treatments maintained QoL, but misoprostol induced diarrhoea. CONCLUSION:
      QoL in arthritis patients on chronic NSAID treatment is destroyed. Omeprazole is 
      superior to misoprostol for relief and prevention of NSAID-associated
      gastrointestinal symptoms allowing continued NSAID treatment without compromising
      the patients' QoL.

      concurrently for 14 days with either 175 mg rofecoxib or matching placebo during 
      two consecutive menstrual cycles. Plasma was sampled for EE, NET, sex hormone
      binding globulin (SHBG), and albumin. The AUC(0-24 h) geometric mean ratio (GMR: 
      rofecoxib/placebo) with corresponding 90% confidence interval (CI) of EE and NET 
      was 1.13 (1.06, 1.19) and 1.18 (1.13, 1.24), respectively. The Cmax GMR of EE and
      NET was 1.06 (0.98, 1.16) and 1.04 (0.99, 1.09), respectively. In each case, the 
      90% CIs satisfied the predefined bioequivalence limits of (0.80, 1.25). Measures 
      of SHBG and albumin and routine clinical and laboratory safety parameters showed 
      no clinically meaningful changes. The addition of rofecoxib to the oral
      contraceptive was not associated with any clinically important changes in EE or
      NET pharmacokinetics and thus would not be anticipated to influence the efficacy 
      of this contraceptive regimen.

TI  - Why do cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors cause cardiovascular events?
PG  - 521-2
AB  - This report confirms evidence that selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
      (NSAIDs), such as celecoxib, can lead to thrombotic cardiovascular events.
      Aspirin, a nonselective COX-1 (cyclo-oxygenase) and COX-2 inhibitor may result in
      gastric toxicity. For this reason, selective COX-2 inhibitors have been developed
      to reduce erosion of the gastric mucosa. Both selective and nonselective NSAIDs
      reduce prostacyclin formation in the infarcted heart; they accomplish this by
      tipping the balance of prostacyclin/thromboxane in favor of thromboxane, a
      prothrombotic eicosanoid. The relative increase in thromboxane, coupled with a
      diminution in prostacyclin in infarcted heart muscle, can lead to the development
      of thrombotic cardiovascular events. This may be prevented by the addition of a
      nitric oxide donor to NSAIDs.

TI  - Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and risk of serious coronary heart disease:
      an observational cohort study.
PG  - 118-23
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NANSAIDs) have
      complex effects that could either prevent or promote coronary heart disease.
      Comparison of the NANSAID rofexocib with naproxen showed a substantial difference
      in acute myocardial infarction risk, which has been interpreted as a protective
      effect of naproxen. We did an observational study to measure the effects of
      NANSAIDs, including naproxen, on risk of serious coronary heart disease. METHODS:
      We used data from the Tennessee Medicaid programme obtained between Jan 1, 1987, 
      and Dec 31, 1998, to identify a cohort of new NANSAID users (n=181 441) and an
      equal number of non-users, matched for age, sex, and date NANSAID use began. Both
      groups were 50-84 years of age, were not resident in a nursing home, and did not 
      have life-threatening illness. The study endpoint was hospital admission for
      acute myocardial infarction or death from coronary heart disease. FINDINGS:
      During 532634 person-years of follow-up, 6362 cases of serious coronary heart
      disease occurred, or 11.9 per 1000 person-years. Multivariate-adjusted rate
      ratios for current and former use of NANSAIDs were 1.05 (95% CI 0.97-1.14) and
      1.02 (0.97-1.08), respectively. Rate ratios for naproxen, ibuprofen, and other
      NANSAIDs were 0.95 (0.82-1.09), 1.15 (1.02-1.28), and 1.03 (0.92-1.16),
      respectively. There was no protection among long-term NANSAID users with
      uninterrupted use; the rate ratio among current users with more than 60 days of
      continuous use was 1.05 (0.91-1.21). When naproxen was directly compared with
      ibuprofen, the current-use rate ratio was 0.83 (0.69-0.98). INTERPRETATION:
      Absence of a protective effect of naproxen or other NANSAIDs on risk of coronary 
      heart disease suggests that these drugs should not be used for cardioprotection.

TI  - Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of the perioperative administration of
      rofecoxib for total knee arthroplasty.
PG  - 26-31
AB  - Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) frequently are discontinued before 
      elective total knee arthroplasty (TKA) because of the increased incidence of
      perioperative bleeding. Rofecoxib, a selective cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, does
      not interfere with the coagulation system and may be a safer NSAID for patients
      undergoing TKA. In this study, 100 patients undergoing elective TKA discontinued 
      their use of NSAIDs 10 days before surgery and were assigned randomly to receive 
      either placebo (n = 50) or rofecoxib (n = 50), 25 mg daily for 5 consecutive days
      starting 3 days before surgery. The administration of rofecoxib resulted in
      improved preoperative pain scores and no significant increase in the incidence of
      perioperative bleeding or international normalized ratio compared with placebo.
      Rofecoxib does not need to be discontinued before elective TKA.

TI  - Valdecoxib, a COX-2-specific inhibitor, is an efficacious, opioid-sparing
      analgesic in patients undergoing hip arthroplasty.
PG  - 43-51
AB  - Opioid agents are highly effective analgesics after orthopedic surgery but are
      associated with several adverse effects. Valdecoxib is a new, highly selective
      cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-specific inhibitor with a rapid onset of action and
      significant analgesic properties that is being developed for the management of
      acute pain. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the opioid-sparing
      efficacy of valdecoxib as part of a multimodal treatment of pain associated with 
      hip arthroplasty. This multicenter, multiple-dose, double-blind, parallel-group
      study compared the opioid-sparing effects, analgesic efficacy, and safety of 20- 
      and 40-mg doses of valdecoxib twice daily with placebo in patients receiving
      morphine by patient-controlled analgesia after hip arthroplasty. Study medication
      was first administered 1 to 3 hours preoperatively. The total amount of morphine 
      administered, pain intensity, and patient's global evaluation of study medication
      were assessed over a period of 48 hours. Patients receiving 20 or 40 mg
      valdecoxib twice daily required on average 40% less morphine than those receiving
      placebo after hip arthroplasty. Pain intensity levels and patient satisfaction
      were significantly improved in both valdecoxib groups compared with placebo.
      Valdecoxib and placebo were equally well tolerated. Pre- and postoperative
      administration of valdecoxib reduces the amount of morphine required for
      postoperative pain relief and provides greater analgesic efficacy compared with
      morphine alone. Thus, valdecoxib has significant clinical utility for acute pain 
      management in orthopedic surgery patients.

TI  - The preemptive analgesic effect of rofecoxib after ambulatory arthroscopic knee
      surgery.
PG  - 55-9, table of contents
AB  - Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) provide effective postoperative
      analgesia after arthroscopic knee surgery. Some investigators have suggested that
      the preemptive administration of NSAIDs may reduce postoperative analgesic
      requirements and hypersensitivity. We evaluated the analgesic effect of
      administering rofecoxib either before or after surgical incision in patients
      undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery under local anesthesia. Sixty patients
      undergoing arthroscopic meniscectomy were randomized into three groups. All
      patients received intraarticular bupivacaine 0.25% pre- and postsurgery together 
      with IV sedation using midazolam and propofol. The Preincisional group received a
      single 50 mg dose of rofecoxib 1 h before surgery, the Postincisional group
      received rofecoxib 50 mg after the completion of surgery, and the Placebo group
      received a placebo tablet before surgery. Pain scores, the time to first opioid
      use, and 24-h analgesic use were recorded. Analgesic duration, defined as the
      time from completion of surgery until first opioid use, was significantly longer 
      in those patients receiving pre- (803 +/- 536 min) versus postincisional (461 +/-
      344 min) rofecoxib or placebo (318 +/- 108 min). The 24 h acetaminophen/oxycodone
      use was less in the Preincisional group (1.5 +/- 0.6 pills) versus the
      Postincisional group (3.3 +/- 1.3 pills) or the Placebo group (5.5 +/- 1.6
      pills). Pain scores with movement were lower in the Preincisional group at all
      postoperative time intervals. We conclude that rofecoxib provides effective
      postoperative analgesia for arthroscopic meniscectomy. Further, the
      administration of rofecoxib 50 mg before surgery provides a longer duration of
      postoperative analgesia, less 24 h opioid use, and lower incidental pain scores
      compared with administering the drug after the completion of surgery.
      IMPLICATIONS: The administration of rofecoxib 50 mg before arthroscopic knee
      surgery provides a longer duration of analgesia, less 24-h opioid use, and lower 
      pain scores than administering the drug after the completion of surgery.

TI  - Precision of composite measures of osteoarthritis efficacy in comparison to that 
      of individual endpoints.
PG  - 2700-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Osteoarthritis (OA) clinical studies generally employ various
      endpoints to evaluate a spectrum of disease manifestations. Compared with
      individual endpoints, a composite measure might (1) provide a uniform outcome
      measure of OA efficacy with greater face validity, (2) address multiplicity, and 
      (3) enhance precision. Combinations of endpoints were analyzed to investigate
      precision of composite measures of OA efficacy. METHODS: We reanalyzed three 6
      week, placebo controlled, double blind, parallel group studies (2 by the same
      protocol) of the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) specific inhibitor rofecoxib. The
      average change from baseline at study weeks 2, 4, and 6 was assessed for 10
      individual response variables, including patient and investigator global
      assessments, WOMAC 3.0V OA Index pain, stiffness and physical function subscales,
      graded study joint tenderness, and rescue analgesic use. Relationships among
      variables were evaluated using pairwise correlations and principal components
      analysis. The precision of variables to differentiate rofecoxib from placebo was 
      evaluated using effect size (i.e., mean difference between rofecoxib versus
      placebo divided by pooled SD). RESULTS: Correlations among all pairs of response 
      variables ranged from 0.5 to 0.9, except those with tenderness (0.4 to 0.6) and
      those with analgesic use (0.2 to 0.4). The first principal component explained
      about 70% of the total variability, with weights generally similar (0.17 for
      rescue analgesic use, 0.25 for tenderness, and 0.30 to 0.37 for the others).
      These results indicate that nearly all measures are closely related. Based on
      these results, various linear combinations of the 9 endpoints were formed and
      their precision to discriminate active treatment from placebo was compared to
      that of the individual endpoints. Effect sizes of the individual endpoints ranged
      from 0.6 to 1.1; those of the composites from 0.7 to 0.9. The results were very
      consistent between study protocols. CONCLUSION: In comparison to individual
      endpoints, composite analyses of OA clinical endpoints do not increase precision 
      to discriminate active treatment from placebo.

TI  - Quantification of nimesulide in human plasma by high-performance liquid
      chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Application to bioequivalence studies.
PG  - 1281-6
AB  - A method based on liquid chromatography with negative ion electrospray ionization
      and tandem mass spectrometry is described for the determination of nimesulide in 
      human plasma. Liquid-liquid extraction using a mixture of diethyl ether and
      dichloromethane was employed and celecoxib was used as an internal standard. The 
      chromatographic run time was 4.5 min and the weighted (1/x) calibration curve was
      linear in the range 10.0-2000 ng x ml(-1). The limit of quantification was 10 ng 
      x ml(-1), the intra-batch precision was 6.3, 2.1 and 2.1% and the intra-batch
      accuracy was 3.2, 0.3 and 0.1% for 30, 300 and 1200 ng x ml(-1) respectively. The
      inter-batch precision was 2.3, 2.8 and 2.7% and the accuracy was 3.3, 0.3 and
      0.1% for 30, 300 and 1200 ng x ml(-1) respectively. This method was employed in a
      bioequivalence study of one nimesulide drop formulation (nimesulide 50 mg x
      ml(-1) drop, Medley S/A Industria Farmaceutica, Brazil) against one standard
      nimesulide drop formulation (Nisulid, 50 mg x ml(-1) drop, Astra Medica, Brazil).
      Twenty-four healthy volunteers (both sexes) took part in the study and received a
      single oral dose of nimesulide (100 mg, equivalent to 2 ml of either formulation)
      in an open, randomized, two-period crossover way, with a 2-week washout interval 
      between periods. The 90% confidence interval (CI) for geometric mean ratios
      between nimesulide and Nisulid were 93.1-109.6% for C(max), 87.7-99.8% for
      AUC(last) and 88.1-99.7% for AUC(0-infinity). Since the 90% CI for the
      above-mentioned parameters were included in the 80-125% interval proposed by the 
      US Food and Drug Administration, the two formulations were considered
      bioequivalent in terms of both rate and extent of absorption.

TI  - Effects of parecoxib, a parenteral COX-2-specific inhibitor, on the
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of propofol.
PG  - 88-95
AB  - BACKGROUND: Parecoxib, a cyclooxygenase-2-specific inhibitor with intended
      perioperative analgesic and antiinflammatory use, is a parenterally administered 
      inactive prodrug undergoing rapid hydrolysis in vivo to the active
      cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor valdecoxib. Both parecoxib and valdecoxib inhibit
      human cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) activity in vitro. Thus, a potential exists
      for in vivo interactions with other CYP2C9 substrates, including propofol. This
      investigation determined the influence of parecoxib on the pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of bolus dose propofol in human volunteers. METHODS: This was a 
      randomized, balanced crossover, placebo-controlled, double-blind, clinical
      investigation. Twelve healthy 21- to 37-yr-old subjects were studied after
      providing institutional review board-approved written informed consent. Each
      subject received a 2-mg/kg intravenous propofol bolus 1 h after placebo (control)
      or 40 mg intravenous parecoxib on two occasions. Venous concentrations of
      propofol, parecoxib, and parecoxib metabolites were determined by mass
      spectrometry. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined by noncompartmental
      analysis. Pharmacodynamic measurements included clinical endpoints, cognitive
      function (memory, Digit-Symbol Substitution Tests), subjective self-assessment of
      recovery (Visual Analog Scale) performed at baseline, 15, 30, 60 min after
      propofol, and sedation depth measured by Bispectral Index. RESULTS: Propofol
      plasma concentrations were similar between placebo- and parecoxib-treated
      subjects. No significant differences were found in pharmacokinetic parameters
      (Cmax, clearance, elimination half-life, volume of distribution) or
      pharmacodynamic parameters (clinical endpoints [times to: loss of consciousness, 
      apnea, return of response to voice], Bispectral Index scores, Digit-Symbol
      Substitution Test scores, memory, Visual Analog Scale scores, propofol EC(50)).
      CONCLUSIONS: Single-bolus parecoxib, in doses to be used perioperatively, does
      not alter the disposition or the magnitude or time course of clinical effects of 
      bolus propofol. Effects on a propofol infusion were not evaluated.

TI  - Cyclooxygenase-2 blockade does not impair endothelial vasodilator function in
      healthy volunteers: randomized evaluation of rofecoxib versus naproxen on
      endothelium-dependent vasodilatation.
PG  - 2879-82
AB  - BACKGROUND: From a cardiovascular standpoint, the safety of cyclooxygenase-2
      (COX-2) blockers has been a topic of increasing concern. This concern stemmed
      from observations indicating that the COX-2 isoform is the major source of
      endothelium-derived prostacyclin and, hence, that selective blockade of this
      enzyme may impair endothelial health. To investigate this matter, we examined the
      effects of 7 days of treatment with rofecoxib versus naproxen on endothelial
      function in healthy volunteers. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-five healthy
      volunteers were randomized to receive 7-day treatment with either rofecoxib (25
      mg/d, n=18) or naproxen (750 mg/d, n=17). Vascular response measurements were
      conducted using forearm strain-gauge plethysmography. Changes in forearm blood
      flow in response to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine (3, 10,
      and 30 microg/min) and the endothelium-independent vasodilator sodium
      nitroprusside (1 and 10 microg/min) were assessed before and after treatment.
      Acetylcholine evoked a dose-dependent increase in forearm blood flow in all
      groups. Importantly, treatment resulted in no change in acetylcholine-mediated
      increases in forearm blood flow in either group (naproxen, P=0.27; rofecoxib,
      P=0.58). Similarly, there was no change in forearm blood flow in response to
      sodium nitroprusside (naproxen, P=0.55; rofecoxib, P=0.63). CONCLUSIONS: We
      herein describe, for the first time, the effects of COX-2-selective inhibition on
      endothelium-dependent vasodilatation in healthy adults. COX-2 blockade, when used
      at the doses employed therapeutically (which are known to inhibit vascular
      prostacyclin production) did not result in significant changes in endothelial
      vasodilator responses in healthy volunteers. The effects of COX-2 inhibitors on
      vasodilator responses in patients with coronary artery disease remain to be
      determined.

TI  - Celecoxib in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis: new preparation. As
      disappointing as rofecoxib.
PG  - 46-9
AB  - (1) The reference treatment for drug-based symptomatic relief of osteoarthritis
      and rheumatoid arthritis is paracetamol and low-dose ibuprofen. (2) The clinical 
      file on celecoxib, a drug promoted as a selective COX-2 inhibitor, is bulky but
      fails to answer several practical questions, mainly because it lacks comparative 
      trials against paracetamol and low-dose NSAIDs. (3) In osteoarthritis, three
      double-blind trials versus naproxen and placebo in a total of 3 258 patients show
      that the analgesic effect of celecoxib 200 mg/day is moderate and does not differ
      significantly from that of naproxen. Giving celecoxib in one or two daily doses
      makes no difference in terms of efficacy. (4) In rheumatoid arthritis, two
      double-blind trials against naproxen and placebo in a total of 2252 patients, and
      a double-blind trial versus sustained-release diclofenac, show that the
      symptomatic effect of celecoxib is moderate and no different from that of the
      comparator NSAIDs. (5) There is no evidence that the safety profile of celecoxib 
      is very different from that of other NSAIDs. The advantage in terms of
      gastrointestinal adverse effects appears very slight. According to clinical
      trials and pharmacovigilance data, celecoxib is in no way exempt from the severe 
      gastrointestinal adverse effects generally associated with NSAIDs. (6) In short, 
      celecoxib changes nothing in the management of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid
      arthritis.

TI  - Postoperative analgesia is not different after local vs systemic administration
      of meloxicam in patients undergoing inguinal hernia repair.
PG  - 978-84
AB  - PURPOSE: To distinguish between local and systemic drug effects, we compared pain
      scores, analgesic consumption and plasma concentrations after local vs i.v.
      administration of meloxicam 7.5 mg in patients with inguinal hernia repair.
      METHODS: In a double-blind, randomized study 56 patients received either local or
      i.v. meloxicam 7.5 mg. Postoperative pain was assessed with a visual analogue
      scale (VAS) at rest, on mobilization, and on coughing, the need for supplementary
      analgesics (fentanyl i.v. and/or acetaminophen-codeine tablets) was recorded, and
      blood samples were drawn during 24 hr after meloxicam administration. RESULTS: No
      significant differences were found between groups with respect to pain scores, or
      in the consumption of supplementary analgesics. Following local application of
      meloxicam, the peak plasma concentration (C(max)) of 0.5 +/- 0.2 mg*L(-1)
      achieved after 1.8 +/- 0.5 hr was much lower than the C(max) of 2.5 +/- 0.9
      mg*L(-1) achieved immediately after i.v. administration (P <0.05). Mean meloxicam
      plasma concentration after infiltration was significantly lower than after i.v.
      doses for the first three hours after administration (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: We
      showed no differences in pain scores and analgesic consumption between local and 
      i.v. administration of meloxicam 7.5 mg during the first 24 hr after
      herniorrhaphy, while plasma concentration of meloxicam was lower after local
      administration. These results indicate a lack of difference in pain relief after 
      concentrating meloxicam at the hernia wound or after achieving high blood levels 
      rapidly (i.v.). Local administration of meloxicam may confer an advantage over
      systemic administration by eliciting lower incidences of systemic adverse
      effects.

TI  - Acute gastrointestinal permeability responses to different non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs.
PG  - 650-5
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) cause
      gastrointestinal damage both in the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract. New
      anti-inflammatory drugs have been developed in an attempt to improve their
      gastrointestinal side effect profile. Our objective was to compare the effect on 
      gastrointestinal permeability of acute equieffective doses of four different
      NSAIDs; three were designed to reduce gastrointestinal mucosal injury. MATERIALS:
      Healthy volunteers underwent sugar tests in a randomised fashion, 15 days apart, 
      at: (1) baseline; (2) after two days of 75 mg slow release (microspheres)
      indomethacin; (3) after two days of 7.5 mg oral meloxicam which preferentially
      inhibits cyclooxygenase 2; and (4) after two days of 750 mg naproxen. A subgroup 
      of subjects was tested after two days of 200 mg celecoxib. In each test, subjects
      ingested a solution containing sucrose, lactulose, and mannitol and sucralose, to
      evaluate gastroduodenal, intestinal, and colonic permeability, respectively.
      RESULTS: Gastric permeability was significantly affected by naproxen (p<0.05) but
      not by slow release indomethacin, meloxicam, or celecoxib. Intestinal
      permeability was significantly increased by the first three NSAIDs (p<0.05) but
      not by celecoxib. Abnormal lactulose/mannitol ratios were observed in 42% of
      meloxicam treatments, in 62% during indomethacin, and in 75% of subjects treated 
      with naproxen. Finally, colonic permeability, as measured by sucralose, was not
      significantly increased by any of the four drugs. CONCLUSION: Our study provides 
      evidence that the newly developed NSAIDs reduce gastric mucosal permeability
      significantly. However, most produced significant alteration of small intestinal 
      permeability. In contrast, our results suggest that celecoxib seems to exhibit
      the most desirable gastrointestinal side effect profile.

TI  - Rofecoxib versus codeine/acetaminophen in postoperative dental pain: a
      double-blind, randomized, placebo- and active comparator-controlled clinical
      trial.
PG  - 1446-55
AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent studies of acute pain and primary dysmenorrhea, rofecoxib, 
      a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that selectively targets the
      cyclooxygenase-2 enzyme, was found to be similar in efficacy to ibuprofen and
      naproxen sodium. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the
      analgesic efficacy of a single oral dose of rofecoxib 50 mg compared with the
      combination of codeine 60 mg/acetaminophen 600 mg in a model of postsurgical
      dental pain. METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo- and active
      comparator-controlled, parallel-group study, patients experiencing moderate or
      severe pain after the surgical extraction of > or = 2 third molars, at least 1 of
      which was a mandibular impaction, were randomized to receive placebo, rofecoxib
      50 mg, or codeine 60 mg/acetaminophen 600 mg. Patient evaluations of pain
      intensity, pain relief, and global assessments were recorded throughout the
      24-hour period after dosing. The 2-stopwatch method was used to determine time to
      confirmed perceptible pain relief. The primary end point assessing overall
      analgesic effect was total pain relief over 6 hours (TOPAR6). Secondary end
      points were patient global assessment of response to therapy (PGART) at 6 hours, 
      onset of analgesia, peak analgesic effect, and duration of analgesia. RESULTS: A 
      total of 393 patients were enrolled; 182 received rofecoxib, 180 received
      codeine/acetaminophen, and 31 received placebo. The overall analgesic effect of
      rofecoxib 50 mg was greater than that of codeine 60 mg/acetaminophen 600 mg for
      TOPAR6 (12.4 vs 7.0; P < 0.001) and PGART at 6 hours (P < 0.001). The onset of
      analgesic effect was similar for rofecoxib and codeine/acetaminophen. Peak
      analgesic effect as measured by peak pain relief scores during the first 6 hours 
      was significantly greater in the rofecoxib group compared with the
      codeine/acetaminophen group (P < 0.001), as was the duration of analgesic effect 
      measured by the time to rescue analgesia (9.6 hours vs 2.3 hours, P < 0.001).
      Adverse events were reported in 33.0%, 46.1%, and 32.3% of patients treated with 
      rofecoxib, codeine/acetaminophen, and placebo, respectively. The most common
      adverse events were nausea (6.0%, 25.0%, and 9.7%, respectively) and vomiting
      (3.8%, 18.3%, and 6.5%, respectively). Significantly more patients in the
      codeine/acetaminophen group than in the rofecoxib group experienced adverse
      events overall (P < 0.050) and nausea in particular (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In
      this study of moderate to severe postoperative dental pain, the analgesic
      efficacy of rofecoxib 50 mg was greater than that of codeine/acetaminophen, with 
      a lower incidence of adverse events and nausea.

TI  - Upper gastrointestinal safety evaluation of parecoxib sodium, a new parenteral
      cyclooxygenase-2-specific inhibitor, compared with ketorolac, naproxen, and
      placebo.
PG  - 1422-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are
      associated with an increased risk of ulcers and upper gastrointestinal (GI) ulcer
      complications, which has been attributed to the inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1.
      These risks are usually increased in elderly populations. Parecoxib sodium is an 
      injectable prodrug of the cyclooxygenase-2-specific inhibitor valdecoxib that has
      exhibited analgesic activity in previous trials. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this
      study was to compare the GI safety and tolerability profile of parecoxib sodium
      with that of ketorolac, naproxen, and placebo in a 7-day endoscopic trial in
      elderly subjects. METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy,
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. After a normal baseline endoscopy,
      healthy elderly subjects aged 66 to 75 years were randomized to receive i.v.
      parecoxib sodium (10 mg BID), oral naproxen (500 mg BID), or placebo for 7 days, 
      or placebo for 2 days followed by i.v. ketorolac (15 mg QID) for 5 days.
      Endoscopy was performed again after 7 days. RESULTS: Among the first 17 subjects 
      enrolled, ulcers were observed in all treatment groups except the parecoxib
      sodium group (ketorolac, 4/4 subjects; naproxen, 2/4 subjects; and placebo, 2/5
      subjects). Four subjects in the ketorolac group and 1 subject in the naproxen
      group had multiple gastric ulcers or combined gastric and duodenal ulcers.
      Because of the unexpectedly high incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers observed, the
      study was terminated early and the randomization blind broken. CONCLUSION: These 
      findings suggest that elderly patients may be at risk for GI ulceration even
      after short-term use of the conventional NSAIDs ketorolac and naproxen.

TI  - Lack of pharmacokinetic interaction between rofecoxib and methotrexate in
      rheumatoid arthritis patients.
PG  - 1120-30
AB  - Rofecoxib is a highly selective and potent inhibitor of cyclooxgenase-2 (COX-2). 
      Methotrexate is a disease-modifying agent with a narrow therapeutic index
      frequently prescribed for the management of rheumatoid arthritis. The objective
      of this study was to investigate the influence of clinical doses of rofecoxib on 
      the pharmacokinetics of methotrexate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. This 
      was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 25 rheumatoid
      arthritis patients on stable doses of methotrexate. Patients received oral
      methotrexate (7.5 to 20 mg) on days -1, 7, 14, and 21. Nineteen patients received
      rofecoxib 12.5, 25, and 50 mg once daily on days 1 to 7, 8 to 14, and 15 to 21,
      respectively. Six patients received placebo on days 1 to 21 only to maintain a
      double-blinded design for assessment of adverse experiences. Plasma and urine
      samples were analyzed for methotrexate and its major although inactive
      metabolite, 7-hydroxymethotrexate. The AUC(0-infinity) geometric mean ratios
      (GMR) and their 90% confidence intervals (90% CI) (rofecoxib +
      methotrexate/methotrexate alone) for day 7/day -1, day 14/day -1, and day 21/day 
      -1, for rofecoxib 12.5, 25, and 50 mg, were 1.03 (0.93, 1.14), 1.02 (0.92, 1.12),
      and 1.06 (0.96, 1.17), respectively (p > 0.2 for all comparisons to day -1). All 
      AUC(0-infinity), GMR and Cmax GMR 90% CIs fell within the predefined
      comparability limits of (0.80, 1.25). Similar results were observed for renal
      clearance of methotrexate and 7-hydroxymethotrexate at the highest dose of
      rofecoxib tested (50 mg). It was concluded that rofecoxib at doses of 12.5, 25,
      and 50 mg once daily has no effect on the plasma concentrations or renal
      clearance (tested at the highest dose of rofecoxib) of methotrexate in rheumatoid
      arthritis patients.

TI  - A pharmacokinetic study of intramuscular (i.m.) parecoxib sodium in normal
      subjects.
PG  - 1111-9
AB  - A single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study was conducted
      to determine the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of single, rising
      intramuscular (i.m.) doses and the single maximum tolerated dose of parecoxib
      sodium, a prodrug of the novel COX-2 selective anti-inflammatory analgesic drug
      valdecoxib, in 56 healthy male volunteers, ages 18 to 45 years inclusive. Cohorts
      of up to 6 subjects in each dose schedule were administered either parecoxib
      sodium (1 mg, 2 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg) or matching placebo. Following 
      i.m. administration, serial blood samples for measurement of plasma
      concentrations of parecoxib, valdecoxib, and valdecoxib metabolite (M1) were
      collected at predetermined intervals (from 15 minutes prior to dose and through
      96 hours postdose). Urine collections were obtained for drug assay (from -12 to 0
      hours, 0 to 12 hours, and 12 to 24 hours postdose). After i.m. administration,
      peak plasma concentrations of parecoxib were reached within 15 minutes and then
      declined rapidly as prodrug was converted to the active moiety, valdecoxib.
      Change in plasma concentrations of valdecoxib, which declined more slowly (t(1/2)
      = 5.4-9.9 hours), reflected transformation to several metabolites, one of which
      was the minor active metabolite M1. As measured by the AUC(0-infinity), Cmax, and
      XU(0-24) of valdecoxib, parecoxib sodium demonstrated dose proportionality when
      administered in the range of 1 mg to 40 mg of parecoxib. All single i.m. doses up
      to the maximum of 40 mg of parecoxib, as well as concentrations of up to 20
      mg/ml, were well tolerated.

TI  - Influence of risk factors on endoscopic and clinical ulcers in patients taking
      rofecoxib or ibuprofen in two randomized controlled trials.
PG  - 1593-601
AB  - BACKGROUND: Highly selective inhibitors of the inducible cyclooxygenase-2 enzyme 
      (coxibs) have been associated with less gastrotoxicity than nonselective NSAIDs
      in clinical studies. AIM: To evaluate the influence of risk factors for
      NSAID-induced gastrotoxicity on endoscopic and clinical ulcers in patients taking
      rofecoxib or ibuprofen. METHODS: We analysed pooled data from two identical
      double-blind, randomized, 12-week endoscopy studies which compared the
      gastroduodenal toxicity of placebo (n=371), rofecoxib 25 mg (n=390), rofecoxib 50
      mg (n=379), and ibuprofen 2400 mg daily (n=376) in patients with osteoarthritis. 
      The potential risk factors evaluated were: age (< 65, > or = 65 years), sex, race
      (white, nonwhite), Helicobacter pylori status, presence of gastroduodenal
      erosions at baseline, a history of upper gastrointestinal disease, prior NSAID
      use within 30 days of study entry, and smoking. We also evaluated these factors
      for possible association with the development of clinically-evident
      gastrointestinal perforations, ulcers or bleeds over 12 weeks. RESULTS: Across
      all treatment groups, the likelihood of detecting endoscopic ulcers, or of
      clinical presentation with a bleed, over 12 weeks was increased approximately
      4-5-fold in patients with previous upper gastrointestinal disease (relative risk 
      [95% confidence interval] of 4.2 [2.5, 7.1] for endoscopic ulcers; 3.8 [1.4,
      10.6] for bleeds), or those with gastroduodenal erosions at baseline endoscopy
      (relative risk of 4.4 [2.6, 7.5] for endoscopic ulcers; 5.0 [1.9, 13.5] for
      bleeds). H. pylori infection did not increase the risk of endoscopic ulcers or
      bleeds (relative risk of 1.1 [0.8, 1.6] for endoscopic ulcers; 0.3 [0.1, 0.9] for
      bleeds). The risk factor sub-group effects were constant across all treatment
      groups, and the significantly higher incidence of ulcers with ibuprofen as
      compared to rofecoxib and placebo was maintained in all risk factor subgroups.
      CONCLUSIONS: Gastroduodenal erosions at baseline and a clinical history of upper 
      gastrointestinal disease, but not H. pylori colonization, increased the risk for 
      endoscopically-detected ulcers and clinical bleeds. Rofecoxib did not magnify the
      risk in any of the patient subgroups studied.

TI  - Cyclooxygenase selectivity of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs in humans: ex
      vivo evaluation.
PG  - 95-103
AB  - We have recently described a novel assay to assess ex vivo the activity and
      selectivity on cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 (EC 1.14.99.1) of non-steroid
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) administered to rats [Br. J. Pharmacol. 126
      (1999) 1824.]. Here, we have extended these studies to humans. Healthy male
      volunteers were given orally one of the following drugs (mg) for 5 days: etodolac
      (200 or 400 b.i.d.), meloxicam (7.5 or 15 q.d.), nimesulide (100 or 200 b.i.d.), 
      nabumetone (500 or 1000 b.i.d.) or naproxen (500 b.i.d.). Blood samples were
      withdrawn from the volunteers before and up to 24 h after the last dose. Plasma
      obtained from the blood was tested for its ability to inhibit prostanoid
      formation in interleukin-1beta-treated A549 cells (cyclooxygenase-2 system) and
      human washed platelets (cyclooxygenase-1 system). Plasma from etodolac-treated
      subjects demonstrated a slight selectivity towards the inhibition of
      cyclooxygenase-2. This effect was more prominent in plasma from subjects
      receiving meloxicam or nimesulide. Plasma from nabumetone-treated subjects showed
      no or little selectivity towards cyclooxygenase-1 depending on the dose of drug
      administered, while plasma taken from subjects receiving naproxen was more active
      at inhibiting cyclooxygenase-1 than cyclooxygenase-2. In conclusion, we have
      demonstrated that this assay can be used to assess ex vivo the relative activity 
      against cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 of NSAIDs consumed by human
      volunteers. It is to be hoped that data from such systems will aid in our
      understanding of the relationships between the differential inhibition of
      cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 by NSAIDs and their reported efficacies and
      (gastrointestinal) toxicities.

TI  - Relative risk of upper gastrointestinal complications among users of
      acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
PG  - 570-6
AB  - Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been associated with an
      increase in upper gastrointestinal complications. There is no agreement, however,
      on whether all conventional NSAIDs have a similar relative risk (RR), and
      epidemiologic data are limited on acetaminophen. We studied the association
      between these medications and the risk of upper gastrointestinal
      bleed/perforation in a population-based cohort of 958,397 persons in the United
      Kingdom between 1993 and 1998. Our nested case-control analysis included 2,105
      cases and 11,500 controls. RR estimates were adjusted for several factors known
      to be associated with upper gastrointestinal bleed/perforation. Compared with
      non-users, users of acetaminophen at doses less than 2 gm did not have an
      increased risk of upper gastrointestinal complications. The adjusted RR for
      acetaminophen at doses greater than 2 gm was 3.6 [95% confidence interval (95%
      CI) = 2.6-5.1]. The corresponding RRs for low/medium and high doses of NSAIDs
      were 2.4 (95% CI = 1.9-3.1) and 4.9 (95% CI = 4.1-5.8). The RR was 3.1 (95% CI = 
      2.5, 3.8) for short plasma half-life, 4.5 (95% CI = 3.5-5.9) for long half-life, 
      and 5.4 (95% CI = 4.0-7.1) for slow-release formulations of NSAIDs. After
      adjusting for daily dose, the differences in RR between individual NSAIDs tended 
      to diminish except for apazone. Users of H2 receptor antagonists, omeprazole, and
      misoprostol had RRs of 1.4 (95% CI = 1.2-1.8), 0.6 (95% CI = 0.4-0.9), and 0.6
      (95% CI = 0.4-1.0), respectively. Among NSAID users, use of nitrates was
      associated with an RR of 0.6 (95% CI = 0.4-1.0).

TI  - Rofecoxib: new preparation. A disappointing NSAID analgesic.
PG  - 166-7, 169
AB  - (1) Rofecoxib, a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, is licensed in France for
      symptom relief in osteoarthritis. It is promoted by MSD-Chibret as a "specific
      inhibitor of type 2 cyclooxygenases (COX-2)". (2) The clinical dossier includes
      trials versus other antiinflammatory drugs, but the reports available are
      generally vague. Rofecoxib has not been compared with paracetamol. (3) In these
      trials rofecoxib 12.5-25 mg/day was no more effective than the comparators
      (ibuprofen or diclofenac) used at maximal recommended doses. (4) Relative to
      other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs prescribed at high doses to selected
      patients in the controlled conditions of clinical trials, rofecoxib only
      moderately reduces the risk of severe gastrointestinal reactions (1.3% versus
      1.8% after a year of treatment) and dyspeptic disorders (23.5% versus 25.5%). (5)
      Questions persist on other adverse effects, especially those potentially
      affecting the kidneys and heart. (6) Rofecoxib is subject to the same precautions
      (pregnancy, interactions, etc.) as other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs.

PG  - 1133-41; discussion 1142-3
AB  - Parecoxib (parecoxib sodium) is an injectable pro drug of valdecoxib, which is a 
      potent and selective inhibitor of cyclo-oxygenase-2. Intravenous (IV) or
      intramuscular (IM) parecoxib >20 mg has analgesic activity superior to that of
      placebo and similar to that of IV or IM ketorolac 30 or 60 mg well controlled
      trials in patients with postoperative dental pain (n = 304 to 457). In a well
      controlled trial (n = 202), IV parecoxib 20 or 40mg showed analgesic activity
      greater than that of placebo and IV morphine 4mg and similar to that of IV
      ketorolac 30 mg following gynaecological surgery Following orthopaedic surgery,
      the analgesic activity of IV parecoxib 20 or 40mg was similar to that of IV
      ketorolac 30 mg and superior to that of IV morphine 4 mg or placebo in well
      controlled trials (n = 175 and 208). IV parecoxib (40 mg twice daily for 7 days) 
      produced significantly fewer gastrointestinal erosions and/or ulcers than
      ketorolac (15 mg 4 times a day for 5 days) in healthy volunteers in a well
      controlled trial; effects on upper gastrointestinal mucosa were similar for
      parecoxib and placebo. Parecoxib is well tolerated after dental, gynaecological
      or orthopaedic surgery. The most common adverse events irrespective of treatment 
      (parecoxib, ketorolac or placebo) after dental surgery were nausea, alveolar
      osteitis, dizziness and headache. Nausea, abdominal pain, headache, abdominal
      fullness, dizziness, back pain, fever, hypoactive bowel sounds, vomiting,
      tachycardia, somnolence, abnor mal breath sounds and pruritus occurred in > or = 
      10% of parecoxib recipients after gynaecological surgery. Similar results were
      seen in placebo recipients.

TI  - Induction of delayed follicular rupture in the human by the selective COX-2
      inhibitor rofecoxib: a randomized double-blind study.
PG  - 1323-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aims of the present study were to examine whether periovulatory
      administration of a cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor affects human ovulation and
      endocrine parameters. METHODS: Thirteen healthy women, 30-40 years of age,
      without hormonal treatment and with regular menstrual cycles (27-34 days), were
      given the selective COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib (n = 6) or placebo (n = 7) in a
      random double-blind fashion. In an initial control cycle, serial hormonal
      analyses, detection of a measurable mid-cycle urine LH peak and transvaginal
      ultrasound scans were performed to confirm normal ovulatory and endocrinological 
      cyclic patterns, in all participating women. During the subsequent treatment
      cycle, serial ultrasound scans were performed. When the dominant follicle reached
      14-16 mm in diameter, 25 mg rofecoxib or placebo was taken orally, once daily for
      9 consecutive days, during which follicle size was monitored daily by ultrasound 
      scans and serial hormone analyses were performed. RESULTS: Four of the six women 
      who received rofecoxib demonstrated delayed follicle rupture, >48 h after the LH 
      peak, when compared with the placebo group, who all had follicular rupture >36 h 
      after the detected LH peak. No differences in peripheral serum concentrations of 
      progesterone, oestradiol, LH and FSH were observed between placebo and rofecoxib 
      groups, when analysed at specified time intervals. CONCLUSIONS: This study
      suggests that selective COX-2 inhibition has a negative, local effect on human
      ovulation, resulting in delayed follicular rupture, without affecting peripheral 
      hormonal cyclicity.

PG  - 985-9
AB  - This three day meeting focused on chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as
      Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and amylotrophic lateral
      sclerosis (ALS). It attracted 69 participants from 10 countries with dominance of
      Chile and USA. Neurodegeneration and its prevention increasingly gain in
      importance as the number of people affected increases year-by-year. The meeting
      addressed various basic aspects having pragmatic implications such as: oxidative 
      stress, inflammatory reaction, glial activation, role of glutamatergic system and
      apoptosis using a plethora of in vitro and in vivo methods.

TI  - Nimesulide aggravates kainic acid-induced seizures in the rat.
PG  - 271-6
AB  - Treatment of rats with kainic acid (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) triggers limbic 
      seizures. Cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA is expressed in the hippocampus and cortex after 
      8 hr and marked cell loss occurs after 72 hr in the CA1-CA3 areas of the
      hippocampus. We examined the effect of the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, nimesulide
      (N-(4-nitro-2-phenoxyphenyl)-methanesulfonamide), on kainate-induced seizures and
      delayed neurotoxicity. Nimesulide (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) was well
      tolerated given alone or 6-8 hr after kainate. However, pretreatment with
      nimesulide augmented seizures and increased the mortality rate from approximately
      10% to 69%. We examined the effect of nimesulide on delayed cell loss after 72 hr
      in the surviving animals with histological staining. Cell loss did not seem to be
      reduced in animals treated with nimesulide 6-8 hr after kainate, but in the
      surviving animals pretreated with nimesulide less cell loss occurred. We conclude
      that nimesulide should be used with caution as an antiinflammatory drug in
      patients with convulsive disorders.

TI  - T-cell involvement in drug-induced acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis.
PG  - 1433-41
AB  - Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) is an uncommon eruption most
      often provoked by drugs, by acute infections with enteroviruses, or by mercury.
      It is characterized by acute, extensive formation of nonfollicular sterile
      pustules on erythematous background, fever, and peripheral blood leukocytosis. We
      present clinical and immunological data on four patients with this disease, which
      is caused by different drugs. An involvement of T cells could be implied by
      positive skin patch tests and lymphocyte transformation tests.
      Immunohistochemistry revealed a massive cell infiltrate consisting of neutrophils
      in pustules and T cells in the dermis and epidermis. Expression of the potent
      neutrophil-attracting chemokine IL-8 was elevated in keratinocytes and
      infiltrating mononuclear cells. Drug-specific T cells were generated from the
      blood and skin of three patients, and phenotypic characterization showed a
      heterogeneous distribution of CD4/CD8 phenotype and of T-cell receptor
      Vbeta-expression. Analysis of cytokine/chemokine profiles revealed that IL-8 is
      produced significantly more by drug-specific T cells from patients with AGEP
      compared with drug-specific T cells from patients that had non-AGEP exanthemas.
      In conclusion, our data demonstrate the involvement of drug-specific T cells in
      the pathomechanism of this rather rare and peculiar form of drug allergy. In
      addition, they indicate that even in some neutrophil-rich inflammatory responses 
      specific T cells are engaged and might orchestrate the immune reaction.

TI  - Evaluation of the tocolytic effect of a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor in a
      mouse model of lipopolysaccharide-induced preterm delivery.
PG  - 595-602
AB  - The inflammatory process is known to cause preterm delivery. Recently, a
      cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor has been developed as an anti-inflammatory drug 
      with few side-effects. We evaluated the COX-2 inhibitor, Celecoxib, for its
      tocolytic effects and side-effects on dams and pups using a lipopolysaccharide
      (LPS)-induced preterm delivery mouse model (preterm delivery rates; 95%). With
      administration of Celecoxib (50, 10, 1 and 0.3 mg/kg), the preterm labour rate
      was significantly reduced to 18, 30, 36 and 60% respectively. The prostaglandin
      F(2alpha)(PGF(2alpha)) and PGE(2) concentrations in murine uterine tissue 4 and
      10 h after LPS treatment with Celecoxib (10 and 1 mg/kg) were significantly lower
      than those in the LPS-treated group without CELECOXIB: With administration of 10 
      or 100 mg/kg Celecoxib, the fetal ductus arteriosus was constricted significantly
      in preterm and near-term rats, although constriction rates in preterm rats were
      significantly lower than those in near-term rats. Reproductive and renal
      functions in offspring whose mothers were treated with LPS and Celecoxib were
      normal. These data demonstrate that Celecoxib could be used as a new therapy for 
      preterm labour. However, careful attention to constriction of the fetal ductus
      arteriosus should be given.

TI  - Endoscopic comparison of the gastroduodenal safety and the effects on arachidonic
      acid products between meloxicam and piroxicam in the treatment of osteoarthritis.
PG  - 104-13
AB  - Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy, the gastroduodenal safety, and the
      effects on arachidonic acid products of meloxicam, a new acidic enolic
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug which preferentially inhibits
      cyclo-oxygenase-2 over cyclo-oxygenase-1, versus piroxicam in patients with
      osteoarthritis of the knee. Meloxicam 7.5 mg or piroxicam 20 mg daily was
      administered for 4 weeks in this double-blind parallel-groups randomised study.
      The efficacy for pain relief of the two tested medications was assessed by means 
      of visual analogue scale and other clinical parameters. Pre- and post-treatment
      endoscopies were performed, and the findings were scored and recorded. The
      gastric fluid was aspirated at each time and prostaglandin E2, thromboxane B2 and
      leukotriene B4 were determined by ELISA. There was no significant difference
      between the groups regarding the primary efficacy. Changes in endoscopic findings
      by means of Lanza score showed statistically significant differences between the 
      two treatment groups in favour of meloxicam at all sites--gastric, duodenal and
      total. Within-group comparisons showed a statistically significant difference
      (worsening) in gastric and total score with piroxicam, but no significant
      difference with meloxicam. The frequency of clinically relevant cases (total
      score >2) also showed a statistically significant worsening in the piroxicam
      group. The better GI tolerability of meloxicam was also suggested by fewer
      adverse GI events and no withdrawals due to adverse events compared with
      piroxicam. The pre-/post-study gastric juice concentration of PGE2, TXB2, and
      LTB4 in the meloxicam group was 135.2 +/- 85.8/71.2 +/- 32.2, 116.3 +/- 81.7/99.4
      +/- 107.5 and 388 +/- 321/223 +/- 98 pg/ml respectively. The pre-/post-study
      gastric juice concentration of PGE2, TXB2 and LTB4 in the piroxicam group was
      105.7 +/- 43.1/68.2 +/- 34.9, 94.0 +/- 50.9/105.9 +/- 121.1 and 625 +/- 1574/828 
      +/- 1464 pg/ml, respectively. Both meloxicam and piroxicam significantly
      inhibited gastric PGE2 levels after 4 weeks' treatment; however, there was no
      difference between these two groups. Neither of these medications had an effect
      on TXB2. Only meloxicam inhibited LTB4 concentration significantly, and the
      between-groups difference was significant. Meloxicam 7.5 mg once daily had better
      gastrointestinal tolerability and an efficacy comparable to that of piroxicam 20 
      mg over 4 weeks in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee.

TI  - Renal safety of combined cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitor and angiotensin II
      receptor blocker administration in mild volume depletion.
PG  - 193-8
AB  - PRINCIPLES: Drugs that either inhibit prostaglandin synthesis or antagonise
      angiotensin II effects are likely to impair renal function, especially in
      patients with an activated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Of the former,
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used, and newer agents
      with cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) specific inhibition may have fewer renal side
      effects compared to non-selective NSAIDs. We therefore investigated whether
      combination of a COX-2 inhibitor with an angiotensin II subtype 1 (AT1) receptor 
      blocker is safe with regard to preservation of normal renal function in a state
      of slight volume contraction. METHODS: Mild volume depletion was induced by a
      salt-restricted diet in 5 healthy volunteers who were then given a single dose of
      400 mg celecoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor, alone or in combination with 150 mg
      irbesartan, an AT1 receptor blocker. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and
      effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) were determined by measuring inulin and PAH
      clearance respectively, along with plasma renin activity (PRA) and urinary
      electrolyte excretion before and over 100 minutes after drug administration.
      RESULTS: PRA was high prior to drug administration, indicating slight salt
      depletion, and dropped by 65% after intake of celecoxib alone (p = 0.008) but
      only by 25% after combined intake with irbesartan (p = n.s.). GFR was not
      affected either by celecoxib alone or by combined administration with irbesartan.
      In contrast, ERPF increased by 28% 80 minutes after simultaneous drug intake (p =
      0.029), but not after celecoxib alone. Renal sodium and potassium excretion did
      not significantly change under celecoxib alone or in combination with irbesartan.
      CONCLUSION: Selective COX-2 inhibition by celecoxib in combination with an AT1
      receptor blocker (irbesartan) has no acute adverse effects on renal haemodynamics
      and renal salt handling in slightly volume-depleted subjects with normal renal
      function. Moreover, our data obtained in humans appear to confirm the
      co-regulatory interaction of COX-2 and angiotensin II in the control of renin
      release, as suggested by animal studies.

TI  - Celecoxib: a new option in the treatment of arthropathies and familial
      adenomatous polyposis.
PG  - 139-52
AB  - The discovery of the two isoenzymes of cyclooxygenase (COX) has recently lead to 
      the development and clinical introduction of specific inhibitors of
      cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), such as celecoxib, onto the market. Celecoxib is an
      effective anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic agent therapeutically
      utilised in the management of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. In
      addition, celecoxib has some novel therapeutic and pharmacological activities.
      Celecoxib inhibits anti-apoptotic kinase activation and is the first specific
      COX-2 inhibitor to be marketed for familial adenomatous polyposis, an inheritable
      predisposition for colorectal cancer. Celecoxib is not without gastrointestinal
      (GI) side effects but demonstrates markedly reduced GI ulceration in clinical
      trials when compared to traditional non-specific non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
      drugs (NSAIDs). The specific COX-2 inhibitors each have distinctive
      pharmacokinetic properties. Celecoxib can be given either once or twice daily.
      Racial differences in drug disposition, and pharmacokinetic changes in elderly
      patients, patients with chronic renal insufficiency and patients with mild to
      moderate hepatic impairment, are evident with celecoxib. Despite the specific
      action of these drugs, there remains the potential for significant drug
      interactions. Celecoxib has demonstrated interactions with fluconazole, lithium
      and warfarin. Increased clinical vigilance should be maintained when
      co-prescribing medications with celecoxib until further clinical experience is
      gained. Celecoxib represents a major therapeutic advance in terms of GI safety.
      However, long-term safety in other organ systems, safety with concomitant drug
      administration, and pharmacoeconomic benefits still remain to be proven.

TI  - [Tolerability of a selective cyclooxygenase-2-inhibitor (rofecoxib) in patients
      with intolerance reactions to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents].
PG  - 386-8
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Pseudoallergic reactions triggered by nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are common and caused by inhibition of the
      enzyme cyclooxygenase-1, whereas their therapeutic effects are mediated by
      inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2. This study analyzed the tolerability of the
      selective cyclooxygenase-2-inhibitor rofecoxib in patients who encountered
      pseudoallergic reactions to NSAIDs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 37 patients (12 males, 
      25 females, mean age 35 years [15-75 years]) with a history of pseudoallergic
      reactions to NSAIDs underwent standardized skin prick, scratch and patch tests
      along with oral placebo-controlled blinded exposure to rofecoxib (maximum single 
      dose 12.5 mg, cumulative dose 25 mg). RESULTS: 23 patients had skin reactions, 4 
      times respiratory symptoms were documented, and in 10 cases cutaneous as well as 
      respiratory symptoms were reported. Salicylic acid was identified as the most
      common trigger for a pseudoallergic reaction (n = 28). In 9 cases several
      non-steroidal antiphlogistics of different chemical groups caused symptoms. All
      skin tests showed negative results. Oral challenge with rofecoxib was tolerated
      by all 37 patients without adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Given the high incidence 
      of pseudoallergic reactions to NSAIDs the use of selective
      cyclooxygenase-2-inhibitors represents a therapeutic alternative as well as a
      means of prevention of the described reactions.

      consumption in patients after radical prostatectomy: a prospective, randomized,
      double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 94-7
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the analgesic efficacy of the rofecoxib po before
      radical prostatectomy. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, double-blinded,
      placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Anesthetic
      management was standardized. Patients received either a 50-mg rofecoxib capsule
      or a placebo capsule po 1 hour before induction of anesthesia. MEASUREMENTS AND
      MAIN RESULTS: Patient-generated 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS) scores for pain
      were assessed at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours after surgery. Morphine consumption 
      was recorded from a patient-controlled analgesia device at the same time. A
      patient-generated overall pain relief score was obtained at 24 hours after
      surgery. We were unable to detect any differences between study groups with
      respect to postoperative morphine consumption, VAS score, or overall pain relief 
      score. CONCLUSIONS: When rofecoxib is used po in maximum recommended doses before
      surgery, it does not provide significant analgesia that results in reduction in
      pain scores or analgesic requirements for patients after radical prostatectomy.

TI  - Comparative efficacy and safety of nimesulide versus piroxicam in osteoarthritis 
      with special reference to chondroprotection.
PG  - 191-7
AB  - The efficacy and tolerability profile of nimesulide was assessed in a
      double-blind, piroxicam-controlled trial in 49 patients with osteoarthritis of
      the knee joint. Nimesulide was administered orally as 100 mg twice daily, and
      piroxicam was administered as 20 mg orally in the morning and placebo in the
      evening. These patients were stratified into two groups: clinical assessment and 
      magnetic resonance imaging evaluation of the knee. All patients were followed for
      8 weeks with clinical assessment every 2 weeks; of these, 11 patients were
      selected for magnetic resonance imaging evaluation, and they were treated for 24 
      weeks. The principal efficacy parameters were improvement in osteoarthritis
      severity index, joint tenderness, swelling, and functional capacity of the
      patients. The final judgment of efficacy was made by the physician. Nimesulide
      improved all primary and secondary efficacy parameters with an activity
      comparable to piroxicam. Significant reduction in joint swelling and tenderness
      was observed as early as 2 weeks in the two treatment groups; however, a greater 
      number of patients were relieved in nimesulide group. At 8 and 24 weeks, the
      number of patients with no joint swelling were 66.7% versus 50% and 80% versus
      66.7% in the nimesulide and piroxicam groups (P <.05). Functional capacity at 8
      weeks improved in 72.2% of nimesulide and 44.4% of piroxicam recipients. Mild
      adverse effects, mainly gastrointestinal, considered possibly related to
      treatment were recorded in 4 patients treated with nimesulide and in 12 patients 
      treated with piroxicam. No significant change in the articulating cartilage of
      the tibiofemoral joint was observed over a 24-week period with either treatment. 
      Nimesulide was as efficacious as piroxicam in reducing the inflammatory indices, 
      and both drugs were equally well tolerated.

TI  - [Liver damage and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: case non-case study in
      the French Pharmacovigilance Database].
PG  - 51-5
AB  - This study investigates the relationship between exposure to non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and liver injuries using the French
      Pharmacovigilance Database. We use the case/non-case methodology, where 'cases'
      were reports of the reactions of interest (liver injuries as recorded in the
      database according to the WHO-ART classification including cytolytic and
      cholestatic hepatitis, acute hepatitis, liver enzyme elevations). 'Non-cases'
      were all reports of reactions other than these being studied. Amineptine and
      acetaminophen were used as 'positive controls'. Among the 42,913 adverse drug
      reactions recorded in the database between January 1995 and December 1997, 5708
      (13 per cent) were liver injuries. In comparison with other drugs in the
      database, liver injuries were inversely associated with exposure to NSAIDs,
      whatever the class of the drugs (OR 0.3 [0.3-0.4]). In contrast, liver injuries
      were significantly related to acetaminophen (OR 2.1 [1.9-2.3]), and amineptine
      (OR 14.0 [10.5-18.7]). Naproxen and diclofenac were associated with a higher
      frequency of liver injuries, respectively 15.7 per cent and 11.5 per cent. The
      risk associated with NSAIDs alone significantly decreased when the analysis was
      performed after exclusion of hepatotoxic drugs associated with NSAIDs (except for
      naproxen). The present results show the low frequency of liver damage associated 
      with NSAIDs. The main factor appears to be concomitant exposure to other
      hepatotoxic drugs.

TI  - Acute effects of the anti-inflammatory cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitor,
      flosulide, on renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate in rats.
PG  - 119-28
AB  - Nephrotoxicity of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is associated with other
      risk factors (volume-depletion) and may be secondary to functional changes
      mediated by the inhibition of renal cyclooxygenases. Acute anti-inflammatory
      doses of flosulide and indomethacin were determined on carrageenan paw edema and 
      its effects on renal plasma flow (RPF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were 
      studied in normovolemic and hypovolemic rats. In normovolemic rats, flosulide
      increased RPF and GFR (25 mg/kg) and indomethacin (5-10 mg/kg) was without
      effect. Volume-depleted rats were obtained by oral furosemide (32 mg/kg), urinary
      eicosanoids were determined. After furosemide, plasma volume, RPF and GFR and
      PGE2 decreased. Treatment of hypovolemic rats with flosulide (5-25 mg/kg) or
      indomethacin 10 mg/kg reduced RPF and GFR. Flosulide at 5 mg/kg reduced
      6-keto-PGF1alpha whereas at 25 mg/kg and after indomethacin at 10 mg/kg a fall in
      6-keto-PGF1alpha and TXB2 appeared. Our data suggest that acute COX-2 selective
      inhibition may alter renal function.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of celecoxib versus hydrocodone/acetaminophen in the
      treatment of pain after ambulatory orthopedic surgery in adults.
PG  - 228-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current outpatient management of postoperative pain includes the use 
      of oral opioid analgesics or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; however, both 
      types of medications are associated with side effects that can limit their
      usefulness in the outpatient setting. OBJECTIVE: Two studies with identical
      protocols assessed the single- and multiple-dose analgesic efficacy and
      tolerability of celecoxib, a specific cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, in the
      treatment of acute pain after orthopedic surgery. METHODS: These were
      multicenter, randomized, placebo- and active-controlled, double-blind,
      parallel-group trials conducted between January and June 1998. Both consisted of 
      a single-dose assessment period (SDAP) and a multiple-dose assessment period
      (MDAP). In the SDAP, patients who had undergone orthopedic surgery received a
      single oral dose of celecoxib 200 mg, hydrocodone 10 mg/acetaminophen 1000 mg, or
      placebo within 24 hours after the end of anesthesia, with pain assessments
      conducted over the following 8-hour period. In the MDAP, extending from 8 hours
      after the first dose of study medication up to 5 days, patients who had received 
      < or =1 dose of rescue medication during the SDAP continued on study medication
      (placebo recipients were rerandomized to active treatment), which could be taken 
      up to 3 times a day as needed. RESULTS: A total of 418 patients were enrolled in 
      the 2 trials. During the SDAP, 141 patients received celecoxib, 136 received
      hydrocodone/acetaminophen, and 141 received placebo. During the MDAP, 185
      patients received celecoxib and 181 received hydrocodone/acetaminophen. When the 
      combined data were analyzed, mean pain intensity difference (PID) scores
      generally favored the active treatments over placebo from 1 to 6 hours (with the 
      exception of 1.5 hours) after dosing (P < or = 0.016) and favored celecoxib over 
      the other treatments at 7 and 8 hours after dosing (P < 0.001). The active
      treatments demonstrated superior summed PID scores through 8 hours (P < 0.001),
      significantly shorter median times to onset of analgesia (P < 0.05), and
      significantly longer median times to first use of rescue medication (P < 0.05).
      During the MDAP, more hydrocodone/acetaminophen-treated patients (20%) than
      celecoxib-treated patients (12%) required rescue medication (P < 0.05), and the
      celecoxib group had significantly lower maximum pain intensity scores (P < 0.001,
      days 2-5), required fewer doses of study medication (P < or = 0.01, days 3-5),
      and had superior scores on a modified American Pain Society Patient Outcome
      Questionnaire (P < or = 0.013). In addition, a significantly lower proportion of 
      celecoxib-treated patients experienced adverse events (43%) compared with
      hydrocodone/acetaminophen-treated patients (89%; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Over 8 
      hours, patients with moderate to severe pain after orthopedic surgery experienced
      comparable analgesia with single doses of celecoxib and
      hydrocodone/acetaminophen. Over a 5-day period, oral doses of celecoxib 200 mg
      taken 3 times a day demonstrated superior analgesia and tolerability compared
      with hydrocodone 10 mg/acetaminophen 1000 mg taken 3 times a day. Most patients
      required no more than 2 daily doses of celecoxib 200 mg for the control of their 
      postorthopedic surgical pain.

TI  - The status of ongoing trials for mild cognitive impairment.
PG  - 741-52
AB  - Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a term used to describe memory decline or
      other specific cognitive impairment in individuals who do not have dementia or
      significant impairment of other cognitive functions beyond that expected for
      their age or education. It has been suggested that as much as 38% of the elderly 
      population would meet criteria for MCI and although the associated memory
      deficits are mild, the fact that up to 15% of MCI patients, particularly those
      with a particular type of memory impairment, convert to Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
      annually has prompted serious attention. Despite the high conversion rate, MCI
      cannot be used synonymously with early or mild AD, as patients with AD are
      impaired not only in memory performance but in other cognitive domains as well;
      they meet diagnostic criteria for dementia. However, since there is a high
      conversion rate from MCI to AD, it is likely many with MCI have the underlying
      neuropathology of AD, though they do not yet meet clinical diagnostic criteria.
      Therefore, treatment strategies developed for AD, specifically
      acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and Cox-2 inhibitors, have been among the first
      employed to treat MCI. It is hoped that by impeding the progression of MCI in
      this manner, fewer patients will convert to AD. This article will give a brief
      overview of the condition of mild cognitive impairment and an account of trial
      methodology and current treatment strategies being employed for MCI.

      the pharmacoeconomic evaluation of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
PG  - 29-32
AB  - Pharmacoeconomics and pharmacoeconomic models are increasingly being used to
      guide health care decisions. In designing and using these models, an appropriate 
      balance must be struck between scientific rigour and model transparency. It is
      therefore important to consider carefully how the various model components, such 
      as model perspective, internal and external validity, and choice of comparators
      and outcomes, should be integrated into the model. These factors are discussed in
      relation to the pharmacoeconomic evaluation of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs.

TI  - Effect of the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor celecoxib on bronchial responsiveness
      and cough reflex sensitivity in asthmatics.
PG  - 93-7
AB  - Cyclooxygenase (COX), an essential enzyme in the pathway of prostaglandin
      formation from arachidonic acid, exists in two isoforms. Cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1)
      is expressed under normal physiologic conditions, whereas COX-2, the inducible
      isoform, is associated with inflammation. Recent studies have linked COX-2
      induction to the asthmatic inflammatory response, but potentially beneficial
      results, such as enhanced production of antiinflammatory and bronchoprotective
      substances, may also occur. The aim of the present study was to investigate the
      effect of selective COX-2 inhibition on bronchial responsiveness and cough reflex
      sensitivity. Eight adult subjects with stable asthma underwent spirometry,
      bronchoprovocation challenge with methacholine, and cough challenge testing with 
      capsaicin, before and after a 7 day course of the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib (200 
      mg orally, twice daily) and placebo, in a randomized, double-blind, crossover
      fashion. No significant changes in pulmonary function, bronchial responsiveness, 
      or cough reflex sensitivity were induced by celecoxib. It appears, therefore,
      that 1 week of therapy with celecoxib does not significantly affect basal airway 
      tone, nor the afferent airway receptors controlling bronchoconstriction and
      cough. However, the results of this trial cannot be extrapolated to subjects with
      severe asthma, or those suffering an asthmatic exacerbation. In such conditions
      of enhanced inflammatory response, the role of selective COX-2 inhibition remains
      to be elucidated.

PG  - 865-70
AB  - The antipyretic effect of nimesulide has not been adequately compared with
      paracetamol and ibuprofen-paracetamol combination in children. Hence, a
      randomized, double blind, and parallel groups' design and multicenter study was
      conducted on children with respiratory tract infections. Eighty-nine patients
      with temperatures above 38.5 degrees C were randomly administered nimesulide (1.5
      mg/kg/dose), paracetamol (10.0 mg/kg/dose), or ibuprofen-patients combination
      (10.0 mg/kg/dose), thrice daily for five days. The axillary temperature was
      recorded at the baseline and at different time intervals post administration of
      drugs. The hematological and biochemical investigations were performed at the
      basal level and at the end of the treatment period. The adverse drug reactions
      were monitored during the trial. All the drugs produced a significant fall in
      temperature as compared to their respective basal values (p < 0.001). However, on
      looking at the change in temperatures at different time intervals from the
      respective basal levels, no significant difference was found among all the drugs.
      Surprisingly, nimesulide had a tendency to raise serum glutamate pyruvate
      transaminase and serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase levels as compared to 
      its baseline values. There was no marked adverse effect of the drugs on other
      hematological and biochemical parameters investigated. No other serious adverse
      reaction occurred in the study. Ibuprofen-paracetamol combination, nimesulide,
      and paracetamol had almost similar antipyretic effects in children.

TI  - Acceleration of atherogenesis by COX-1-dependent prostanoid formation in low
      density lipoprotein receptor knockout mice.
PG  - 3358-63
AB  - The cyclooxygenase (COX) product, prostacyclin (PGI(2)), inhibits platelet
      activation and vascular smooth-muscle cell migration and proliferation.
      Biochemically selective inhibition of COX-2 reduces PGI(2) biosynthesis
      substantially in humans. Because deletion of the PGI(2) receptor accelerates
      atherogenesis in the fat-fed low density lipoprotein receptor knockout mouse, we 
      wished to determine whether selective inhibition of COX-2 would accelerate
      atherogenesis in this model. To address this hypothesis, we used dosing with
      nimesulide, which inhibited COX-2 ex vivo, depressed urinary 2,3 dinor 6-keto
      PGF(1alpha) by approximately 60% but had no effect on thromboxane formation by
      platelets, which only express COX-1. By contrast, the isoform nonspecific
      inhibitor, indomethacin, suppressed platelet function and thromboxane formation
      ex vivo and in vivo, coincident with effects on PGI(2) biosynthesis
      indistinguishable from nimesulide. Indomethacin reduced the extent of
      atherosclerosis by 55 +/- 4%, whereas nimesulide failed to increase the rate of
      atherogenesis. Despite their divergent effects on atherogenesis, both drugs
      depressed two indices of systemic inflammation, soluble intracellular adhesion
      molecule-1, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 to a similar but incomplete
      degree. Neither drug altered serum lipids and the marked increase in vascular
      expression of COX-2 during atherogenesis. Accelerated progression of
      atherosclerosis is unlikely during chronic intake of specific COX-2 inhibitors.
      Furthermore, evidence that COX-1-derived prostanoids contribute to atherogenesis 
      suggests that controlled evaluation of the effects of nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs and/or aspirin on plaque progression in humans is timely.

TI  - The use of anti-inflammatory drugs in cancer pain.
PG  - 51-61
AB  - The role of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in cancer pain has
      been well established in the treatment of mild pain and also alone or in
      association with opioids for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. Acutely,
      NSAIDs may be more than mild analgesics, and may provide additional analgesia
      when combined with opioids. However, NSAIDs have ceiling effects and there is no 
      therapeutic gain from increasing dosages beyond those recommended. As there is no
      clearly superior NSAID, the choice should be based on experience and the toxicity
      profile that probably relates to the COX-1:COX-2 ratio. Among the older drugs,
      ibuprofen seems to have these properties.Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
      have been shown to have an opioid-sparing effect. Although the value of a simple 
      narcotic-sparing effect may be questioned in cancer pain treatment, the use of
      NSAIDs may be useful when the increase in opioid dosage determine the occurrence 
      of opioid toxicity. Like opioids, NSAIDs should not be considered analgesics for 
      a specific type or cause of pain. There is a lack of evidence for any difference 
      between different routes of NSAIDs administration. The long-term toxicity of
      NSAIDs in cancer pain is poorly defined due to a lack of studies. A variety of
      strategies have been used in an attempt to reduce the risks associated with NSAID
      therapy. Those NSAIDs that are weak COX-1 inhibitors may be preferred. In
      addition, concomitant administration of misoprostol is recommended in patients at
      increased risk for upper gastrointestinal complications.

TI  - Anti-arthritic effects of KF20444, a new immunosuppressive compound inhibiting
      dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, on rat collagen-induced arthritis.
PG  - 24-31
AB  - OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: A newly synthesized inhibitor of pyrimidine de novo
      biosynthesis, KF20444 (6,7-dihydro-10-fluoro-3-(2-fluorophenyl)-5H-benzo [6,7]
      cyclohepta [1,2-b] quinoline-8-carboxylic acid), was evaluated as an inhibitor of
      dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHO-DHase) and tested in the rat collagen-induced
      arthritis (CIA) model. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Female Sprague Dawley rats, 5
      weeks-old, were used for evaluation of KF20444 in the CIA model. Arthritis was
      evaluated by arthritis score, serum anti-type II collagen antibody titer, body
      weight loss, radiographical and histological changes. TREATMENT: KF20444 was
      orally administered 5 times per week (0.3, 1, 3 mg/kg/day). RESULTS: KF20444
      inhibited rat liver dihydroorotate dehydrogenase in vitro with Ki = 8.5 +/- 3.2
      nM, which was a comparable effect to that of brequinar sodium (Ki = 25.3 +/- 5.3 
      nM). The anti-proliferative effect of KF20444 was caused by cell cycle arrest at 
      the S-phase. Treatment with 3 mg/kg/day of KF20444 completely prevented the
      development of CIA based on reduction of the arthritis score. The 50% effective
      dose (ED50) of KF20444 on arthritis score was 0.64 mg/kg. KF20444 ameliorated
      body weight loss associated with disease onset. The compound also inhibited the
      increase in serum anti-type II collagen antibody level, and reduced both pannus
      formation and bone erosion. Importantly, KF20444 suppressed the development of
      arthritis, even when it was administered after booster immunization of collagen. 
      CONCLUSIONS: KF20444 is a novel immunosuppressant which inhibits DHO-DHase and
      its effects in CIA suggest that it could be useful in the treatment of rheumatoid
      arthritis.

TI  - Rofecoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor, does not inhibit human gastric mucosal
      prostaglandin production.
PG  - 867-73
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Rofecoxib, an inhibitor of the inducible cyclooxygenase
      (COX)-2 enzyme, appears not to cause acute gastroduodenal injury or chronic
      ulceration. To attribute this to COX-2 selectivity with sparing of gastric
      mucosal prostaglandin synthesis requires direct proof. METHODS: Twenty-four
      healthy, nonsmoking Helicobacter pylori-negative volunteers were randomized to 1 
      of 2 separate concurrent blinded crossover studies. Sixteen volunteers received
      rofecoxib, 50 mg once daily, for 5 days in one treatment period and placebo in
      the other. Eight volunteers similarly received naproxen, 500 mg twice daily, and 
      placebo. On day 5 of each period, antral mucosal prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)
      synthesis was measured by radioimmunoassay after vortexing for 3 minutes. Whole
      blood COX-1 activity was measured as serum thromboxane (TXB)2- and COX-2 activity
      as lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced PGE2. RESULTS: Naproxen decreased gastric
      mucosal PGE2 synthesis by 65% (90% confidence interval [CI], 53%-74%; P = 0.001
      vs. placebo) in contrast to an 18% increase after rofecoxib (90% CI, -11% to 57%;
      P = 0.313 vs. placebo). Naproxen also significantly inhibited both serum TXB2 by 
      94% and LPS-induced PGE2 production by 77% (both P < or = 0.002 vs. placebo), but
      rofecoxib only inhibited COX-2-dependent LPS-induced PGE(2) (by 79%; P < 0.001
      vs. placebo). CONCLUSIONS: Rofecoxib (50 mg) lacked naproxen's ability to reduce 
      the availability of gastroprotective prostaglandins.

TI  - A new cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, rofecoxib (VIOXX), did not alter the
      antiplatelet effects of low-dose aspirin in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 1509-15
AB  - The present study examined whether rofecoxib (VIOXX), a new specific inhibitor of
      cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), would interfere with the desired antiplatelet effects
      of aspirin. Thus, the effects of rofecoxib on inhibition of ex vivo
      serum-generated thromboxane B2 (TXB2) and platelet aggregation by low doses (81
      mg) of aspirin were examined in healthy volunteers. This was a double-blind,
      randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel study of two treatment groups (n = 12
      per group) in which subjects received 50 mg of rofecoxib or placebo for 10 days
      in a blinded fashion. Subjects also received 81 mg aspirin once on each of days 4
      through 10 in an open-label fashion. Blood for measurement of serum TXB2
      production and platelet aggregation studies was collected on day 1 (prior to
      rofecoxib/placebo), on day 4 (prior to aspirin), and on day 10 (before and 4
      hours following the seventh dose of aspirin). Platelet-derived serum TXB2 (COX-1 
      assay) was measured in blood clotted for 1 hour at 37 degrees C. Platelet
      aggregation was independently induced employing 1 mM arachidonic acid and 1
      microgram/mL collagen as agonists. Rofecoxib administered alone had no
      significant effect on serum TXB2 production or platelet aggregation (day 4). TXB2
      production was inhibited 98.4% by aspirin coadministered with either rofecoxib or
      placebo (day 10). Similarly, platelet aggregation induced by arachidonic acid was
      inhibited 93.7% and 93.5% by aspirin coadministered with either rofecoxib or
      placebo, respectively (day 10). The comparable values for inhibition of
      collagen-induced platelet aggregation were 86.8% and 90.8%, respectively. No
      important clinical or laboratory adverse experiences were observed. In
      conclusion, rofecoxib alone (50 mg QD for 4 days) did not inhibit serum TXB2
      production or platelet aggregation. In addition, rofecoxib (50 mg QD for 10 days)
      did not alter the antiplatelet effects of low-dose aspirin (inhibition of
      platelet aggregation and TXB2 production). Rofecoxib was generally well tolerated
      when administered alone or in combination with low-dose aspirin.

TI  - Gastrointestinal sparing anti-inflammatory drugs--effects on ulcerogenic and
      healing responses.
PG  - 49-69
AB  - The use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is associated with a wide
      array of alterations in gastrointestinal integrity and function. Various
      approaches have been taken to developing NSAIDs with reduced gastrointestinal
      toxicity, and few have been successfully reduced the incidence of adverse
      reactions. These include cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective inhibitors and nitric
      oxide (NO)-releasing NSAIDs. Especially, much has been written about the
      potential of COX-2 inhibitors as anti-inflammatory and analgesic agents that lack
      the gastrointestinal side effects of traditional NSAIDs. COX-2 expression is most
      evident at sites of inflammation, while COX-1 accounts for the majority of
      prostaglandin synthesis in the normal gastrointestinal tract. However, there are 
      distinct examples of circumstances in which COX-2-derived prostaglandins play a
      role in the maintenance of gastrointestinal mucosal integrity, particularly when 
      the mucosa is injured, and the delineation of COX-1 and COX-2 might not be quite 
      as clear as has been suggested. On the other hand, the rational behind the
      NO-releasing NSAIDs is that the NO released from the derivatives will exert
      beneficial effects on the gastrointestinal mucosa. This approach has been
      successfully demonstrated to lessen the incidence of gastrointestinal damage and 
      to promote the healing of gastric ulcers. The present article overviews the roles
      of COX and NO in housekeeping functions of the gastrointestinal mucosa in various
      circumstances, and the effects of gastrointestinal sparing NSAIDs, mainly COX-2
      selective inhibitors and NO-releasing derivatives of NSAIDs, on the ulcerogenic
      and healing responses in the gastrointestinal mucosa of experimental animals.

TI  - Effect of rofecoxib on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 107-12
AB  - The authors examined the effect of the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor,
      rofecoxib, at steady state on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin following a single 
      dose in healthy subjects. Each healthy subject (N = 10) received rofecoxib (75 mg
      once daily) or placebo for 11 days in a double-blind, randomized, balanced,
      two-period crossover study. A single 0.5 mg oral dose of digoxin elixir was
      administered on the 7th day of each 11-day period. Each treatment period was
      separated by 14 to 21 days. Samples for plasma and urine immunoreactive digoxin
      concentrations were collected through 120 hours following the digoxin dose. No
      statistically significant differences between treatment groups were observed for 
      any of the calculated digoxin pharmacokinetic parameters. For digoxin
      AUC(0-infinity), AUC(0-24), and Cmax, the geometric mean ratios (90% confidence
      interval) for (rofecoxib + digoxin/placebo + digoxin) were 1.04 (0.94, 1.14),
      1.02 (0.94, 1.09), and 1.00 (0.91, 1.10), respectively. The digoxin median tmax
      was 0.5 hours for both treatments. The harmonic mean elimination half-life was
      45.7 and 43.4 hours for rofecoxib + digoxin and placebo + digoxin treatments,
      respectively. Digoxin is eliminated renally. The mean (SD) cumulative urinary
      excretion of immunoreactive digoxin after concurrent treatment with rofecoxib or 
      placebo was 228.2 (+/- 30.8) and 235.1 (+/- 39.1) micrograms/120 hours,
      respectively. Transient and minor adverse events occurred with similar frequency 
      on placebo and rofecoxib treatments, and no treatment-related pattern was
      apparent. Rofecoxib did not influence the plasma pharmacokinetics or renal
      elimination of a single oral dose of digoxin.

TI  - Celecoxib prevents tumor growth in vivo without toxicity to normal gut: lack of
      correlation between in vitro and in vivo models.
PG  - 6045-51
AB  - Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have potential for use in the prevention
      and/or treatment of colorectal cancer. We have studied the cytotoxic effect of a 
      specific COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, against LLC, HCA-7, and HCT-15 cells grown
      in cell culture and have compared these results with its effect on HCA-7 cells
      grown as xenografts in nude mice. "High-dose" celecoxib (>20 microM) reduced the 
      viability of all three cell lines in vitro as measured by the
      3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Flow
      cytometric analysis demonstrated that this loss of viability was attributable to 
      the induction of apoptosis. Significantly, concentrations of the drug <10 microM 
      had no effect on cell viability in vitro. The cytotoxic effects of high-dose
      celecoxib were independent of COX-2 inhibition because similar effects were
      observed in cox-2 (+/+), cox-2 (+/-) and cox-2 (-/-) fibroblasts. A plasma
      concentration of 2.3+/-0.7 microM was achieved when celecoxib (1250 mg/kg of
      chow) was fed to animals ad libitum. Despite a lack of toxicity at 2-3 microM
      celecoxib in vitro, there was attenuation of HCA-7 xenograft growth in vivo.
      Celecoxib had no effect on apoptosis, cell division, or the epithelial
      architecture of the normal gut in treated mice. These results support the need
      for additional clinical evaluation of celecoxib for treatment and/or prevention
      of colorectal cancer in humans.

TI  - Risk of gastrointestinal haemorrhage with long term use of aspirin:
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 1183-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the incidence of gastrointestinal haemorrhage associated
      with long term aspirin therapy and to determine the effect of dose reduction and 
      formulation on the incidence of such haemorrhage. DESIGN: Meta-analysis of 24
      randomised controlled trials (almost 66 000 participants). Intervention: Aspirin 
      compared with placebo or no treatment, for a minimum of one year. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURES: Incidence of gastrointestinal haemorrhage. RESULTS: Gastrointestinal
      haemorrhage occurred in 2.47% of patients taking aspirin compared with 1.42%
      taking placebo (odds ratio 1.68; 95% confidence interval 1.51 to 1.88); the
      number needed to harm was 106 (82 to 140) based on an average of 28 months'
      therapy. At doses below 163 mg/day, gastrointestinal haemorrhage occurred in
      2.30% of patients taking aspirin compared with 1.45% taking placebo (1.59; 1.40
      to 1.81). Meta-regression showed no relation between gastrointestinal haemorrhage
      and dose. For modified release formulations of aspirin the odds ratio was 1.93
      (1.15 to 3.23). CONCLUSIONS: Long term therapy with aspirin is associated with a 
      significant increase in the incidence of gastrointestinal haemorrhage. No
      evidence exists that reducing the dose or using modified release formulations
      would reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal haemorrhage.

TI  - Evaluation of intravenous parecoxib for the relief of acute post-surgical pain.
PG  - 2717-23
AB  - Parecoxib is a prodrug of valdecoxib, which is a potent and selective inhibitor
      of COX-2. Intravenous preparation of parecoxib is in Phase III clinical trials
      for the management of acute and severe post-surgical pain. It is the only COX-2
      inhibitor that is available in a parenteral formulation. Clinical results compare
      parecoxib with ketorolac, a NSAID, which is the only non-narcotic analgesic
      available in parenteral formulation that can be administered for the relief of
      moderate to severe acute pain. Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that parecoxib 
      is converted to valdecoxib within a short time following administration by im. or
      iv. injection. In clinical trials, parecoxib compares favourably with ketorolac
      and produces less gastric or duodenal ulcers, the predominant adverse effect,
      than ketorolac. Parecoxib, thus, fulfils some of the desirable characteristics of
      an ideal non-narcotic analgesic for severe post-surgical pain and has application
      in other acutely painful conditions. Parecoxib is expected to be filed for
      approval before the end of 2000 and is expected to be introduced in the market in
      2001. It has favourable prospects for a fair share of the post-surgical pain
      relief market which is valued at approximately US$ 1 billion for the year 2000.

TI  - Postoperative analgesic effects of celecoxib or rofecoxib after spinal fusion
      surgery.
PG  - 1221-5
AB  - Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs are recommended for the multimodal management
      of postoperative pain and may have a significant opioid-sparing effect after
      major surgery. The analgesic efficacy of the cyclooxygenase-2 nonsteroidal
      antiinflammatory drugs, celecoxib and rofecoxib, have not been evaluated after
      major orthopedic surgery. This study was designed to determine whether the
      administration of a preoperative dose of celecoxib or rofecoxib to patients who
      have undergone spinal stabilization would decrease patient-controlled analgesia
      (PCA) morphine use and/or enhance analgesia. We evaluated 60 inpatients
      undergoing spine stabilization by one surgeon. All patients received PCA
      morphine. The patients were divided into three groups. Preoperatively, they were 
      given oral celecoxib 200 mg, rofecoxib 50 mg, or placebo. The outcome measures
      included pain scores and 24-h morphine use at six times during the first 24
      postoperative h. The total dose of morphine and the cumulative doses for each of 
      the six time periods were significantly more in the placebo group than in the
      other two groups. The morphine dose was significantly less in five of the six
      time intervals in the rofecoxib group compared with the celecoxib group. The pain
      scores were significantly less in the rofecoxib group than in the other two
      groups at two of the six intervals, and less than the placebo group in an
      additional interval. Although both rofecoxib and celecoxib produce similar
      analgesic effects in the first 4 h after surgery, rofecoxib demonstrated an
      extended analgesic effect that lasted throughout the 24-h study. We thus
      recommend that rofecoxib be used as a preoperative component of pain management
      that includes PCA morphine in patients undergoing spine stabilization surgery.
      Implications: The cyclooxygenase-2-specific nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, 
      celecoxib and rofecoxib, both demonstrate an opioid-sparing effect after spinal
      fusion surgery. Celecoxib resulted in decreased morphine use for the first 8 h
      after surgery, whereas rofecoxib demonstrated less morphine use throughout the
      24-h study period.

TI  - Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced acute gastric injury in Helicobacter 
      pylori gastritis in Mongolian gerbils.
PG  - 461-8
AB  - We examined the acute ulcerogenic effects of indomethacin and N-(2,
      cyclohexyloxy-4-nitrophenyl)methane sulfonamide (NS-398) on the gastric mucosa in
      Helicobacter pylori-infected Mongolian gerbils. H. pylori infection for 4 and 12 
      weeks caused moderate and severe gastritis, respectively, with cyclooxygenase-2
      expression and an increase in prostaglandin E(2) production. In normal animals,
      gastric injury was caused by indomethacin, but not by NS-398. At 4 weeks
      infection, gastric lesions were synergistically aggravated by indomethacin, and
      NS-398 at high doses. However, at 12 weeks, the synergistic effects of
      indomethacin and NS-398 with H. pylori were not observed. Indomethacin and NS-398
      at high doses inhibited prostaglandin E(2) production in both normal and the
      infected mucosa. NS-398 at low dose reduced only the H. pylori-increased
      prostaglandin production. These results suggest that nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) synergistically aggravate gastric lesions in
      moderate H. pylori gastritis, but not in severe gastritis. Cyclooxygenase-2
      inhibition only might not induce acute gastric injury in H. pylori gastritis.

TI  - Comparative inhibitory activity of rofecoxib, meloxicam, diclofenac, ibuprofen,
      and naproxen on COX-2 versus COX-1 in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 1109-20
AB  - Steady-state inhibitory activity of rofecoxib (Vioxx) on COX-2 versus COX-1 was
      compared with that of commonly used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
      in 76 healthy volunteers randomized to placebo, rofecoxib 12.5 mg qd, rofecoxib
      25 mg qd, diclofenac 50 mg tid, ibuprofen 800 mg tid, sodium naproxen 550 mg bid,
      or meloxicam 15 mg qd. All of these doses include the high end of the approved
      clinical dose range. Ex vivo whole-blood assays were used to determine the effect
      on COX-2 and COX-1 activity, respectively. Urinary prostanoids were also
      measured. Mean inhibition of COX-2 (measured as the weighted average inhibition
      [WAI] of lipopolysaccharide [LPS]-induced PGE2 generation over 8 hours on day 6
      vs. baseline) was -2.4%, 66.7%, 69.2%, 77.5%, 93.9%, 71.4%, and 71.5% for
      placebo, rofecoxib 12.5 mg, rofecoxib 25 mg, meloxicam, diclofenac, ibuprofen,
      and naproxen, respectively. Corresponding values for mean inhibition of COX-1
      (measured as TXB2 generation in clotting whole blood) were -5.15%, 7.98%, 6.65%, 
      53.3%, 49.5%, 88.7%, and 94.9%. Rofecoxib had no significant effect on urinary
      excretion of 11-dehydro TXB2, a COX-1-derived product. These data support the
      contention that rofecoxib is the only drug of the regimens tested that uniquely
      inhibits COX-2 without affecting COX-1.

TI  - A comparative study of subsyde-CR versus meloxicam in rheumatic disorders.
PG  - 250-2
AB  - A prospective, randomised comparative clinical study was conducted in adult
      patients of either sex presenting with articular and non-articular rheumatic
      conditions commonly encountered in clinical practice Rheumatoid arthritis,
      osteo-arthritis, cervical spondylosis, and lumbago/sciatica were the most
      frequent conditions encountered in both the groups, followed by others like
      tenosynovitis, frozen shoulder, prolapsed disc, fibrositis, myositis, sprains,
      strains and so on. The drugs that were employed for therapy were diclofenac in a 
      controlled release formulation employing the DRCM technology (subsyde-CR) and
      meloxicam in a standard formulation marketed in our country. Both drugs were well
      tolerated and found to be effective in reducing the signs and symptoms of the
      disease entities throughout the study period, but subsyde-CR was observed to
      produce a somewhat greater reduction in signs and symptoms scores that meloxicam,
      a difference that could be possibly attributed to the greater efficacy of
      subsyde-CR in non-articular rheumatic conditions. On the basis of the available
      literature on diclofenac and meloxicam as well as the DRCM technology in
      formulating subsyde-CR, it is reasonable to conclude that a controlled release
      formulation of diclofenac based on the DRCM technology offers a safe and
      effective alternative to other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as
      meloxicam.

TI  - Comparison of the intestinal toxicity of celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, 
      and indomethacin in the experimental rat.
PG  - 802-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is suggested that the gastrointestinal toxicity of conventional
      non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is due to a 'topical' effect in
      addition to inhibition of the mucosal constitutive cyclo-oxygenase-1 (COX-1)
      enzyme. COX-2 selective inhibitors have been shown to have excellent
      gastrointestinal tolerability, but it is not known whether this is due to their
      selectivity and/or a lack of a 'topical' effect. We assessed the effects of
      celecoxib (a highly selective COX-2 inhibitor) on key pathophysiologic events in 
      NSAID enteropathy. METHODS: The 'topical' effects of indomethacin and celecoxib
      were assessed in vitro (coupled mitochondrial respiration) and in vivo
      (mitochondrial electron microscopy) and the consequences by study of intestinal
      permeability (51-Cr-labelled ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid urinary excretion) 
      and inflammation. We also assessed intestinal prostanoid levels (prostaglandin E,
      PGE) and the propensity of the drugs to induce intestinal ulcers. RESULTS:
      Indomethacin uncoupled mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in vitro and in
      vivo, caused a significant (P < 0.0001) increase in intestinal permeability,
      caused mucosal inflammation and a 90% decline in intestinal PGE levels, and was
      associated with multiple small intestinal ulcers. Celecoxib caused no significant
      increase in any of these parameters, did not decrease intestinal PGE levels, and 
      caused no intestinal ulcers. CONCLUSIONS: The intestinal tolerability of
      celecoxib appears to be due to a combination of the absence of a 'topical'
      damaging effect and selective COX inhibition.

TI  - The prevention of chronic NSAID induced upper gastrointestinal toxicity: a
      Cochrane collaboration metaanalysis of randomized controlled trials.
PG  - 2203-14
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the effectiveness of common interventions for the prevention
      of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) induced upper gastrointestinal (GI)
      toxicity. METHODS: Randomized controlled clinical trials (RCT) of prostaglandin
      analogs, H2-receptor antagonists (H2RA), or proton pump inhibitors (PPI) for the 
      prevention of chronic NSAID induced upper GI toxicity were identified through
      electronic databases, the Cochrane control trials register, conference
      proceedings, and by contacting content experts and companies. Outcome measures
      investigated were endoscopic ulcers, ulcer complications, symptoms, overall
      dropouts, dropouts due to symptoms, and study quality. RESULTS: Thirty-four RCT
      met the inclusion criteria. All doses of misoprostol significantly reduced the
      risk of endoscopic ulcers. Misoprostol 800 microg/day was superior to 400
      microg/day for the prevention of endoscopic gastric ulcers (RR 0.18, RR 0.38,
      respectively; p = 0.0055). A dose-response relationship was not seen with
      duodenal ulcers. Misoprostol caused diarrhea at all doses, although significantly
      more at 800 than 400 microg/day (p = 0.0012). Misoprostol was the only
      prophylactic agent documented to reduce ulcer complications. Standard doses of
      H2RA were effective at reducing the risk of endoscopic duodenal (RR 0.24, 95% CI 
      0.10-0.57) but not gastric ulcers (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.50-1.09). Both double dose
      H2RA and PPI were effective at reducing the risk of endoscopic duodenal and
      gastric ulcers (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.26-0.74 and RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.27-0.51,
      respectively, for gastric ulcer) and were better tolerated than misoprostol.
      CONCLUSION: Misoprostol, PPI, and double dose H2RA are effective in preventing
      chronic NSAID related endoscopic gastric and duodenal ulcers. Lower doses of
      misoprostol are less effective and are still associated with diarrhea. Only
      misoprostol 800 microg/day has been directly shown to reduce the risk of ulcer
      complications.

TI  - COX-2 inhibition with rofecoxib does not increase intestinal permeability in
      healthy subjects: a double blind crossover study comparing rofecoxib with placebo
      and indomethacin.
PG  - 527-32
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute and chronic use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can
      increase intestinal permeability. Rofecoxib, which selectively inhibits
      cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), is a novel anti-inflammatory drug with the potential to
      produce minimal gastrointestinal toxic effects while retaining clinical efficacy.
      AIMS: To assess the potential for rofecoxib to affect the intestine adversely, in
      comparison with placebo and indomethacin. SUBJECTS: Thirty nine healthy subjects 
      (aged 24-30 years). METHOD: We performed a four period crossover trial to assess 
      intestinal permeability before and after seven days of treatment. Permeability
      was measured by the urinary ratio of chromium-51 labelled ethylene diamine
      tetraacetate ((51)CrEDTA)/L-rhamnose (five hour collection). RESULTS:
      Indomethacin 50 mg three times daily produced greater increases in intestinal
      permeability compared with placebo or rofecoxib (25 or 50 mg) (p< or = 0.001);
      rofecoxib was not significantly different from placebo. Mean day 7 to baseline
      ratios (95% confidence intervals) for (51)CrEDTA/L-rhamnose were 0.97 (0.82,
      1.16), 0.80 (0.68, 0.95), 0.98 (0.82, 1.17), and 1.53 (1.27, 1.85) for placebo,
      rofecoxib 25 mg, rofecoxib 50 mg, and indomethacin groups, respectively.
      Rofecoxib was generally well tolerated. CONCLUSION: In this study, treatment for 
      one week with indomethacin 50 mg three times daily significantly increased
      intestinal permeability compared with placebo, while treatment with rofecoxib 25 
      mg or 50 mg daily did not. The absence of a significant effect of rofecoxib on
      intestinal permeability at doses at least twice those recommended to treat
      osteoarthritis was consistent with other studies that have demonstrated little or
      no injury to the gastrointestinal mucosa associated with rofecoxib therapy.

TI  - A randomized trial measuring fecal blood loss after treatment with rofecoxib,
      ibuprofen, or placebo in healthy subjects.
PG  - 201-6
AB  - PURPOSE: Gastrointestinal microbleeding, as assessed by the measurement of
      (51)chromium-labeled red blood cells, is a marker of the mucosal injury
      associated with the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. This study
      tested the hypotheses that cyclooxygenase-2 specific inhibition with rofecoxib
      would cause less fecal blood loss than a therapeutic dose of ibuprofen and would 
      be equivalent to placebo. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind 
      group study, gastrointestinal blood loss was assessed by measurement of fecal
      (51)chromium radioactivity during a 1-week placebo baseline period and during 4
      weeks of treatment with rofecoxib (25 mg or 50 mg once daily), ibuprofen (800 mg 
      three times daily), or placebo in 67 healthy subjects. Gastrointestinal blood
      loss during treatment weeks 2 to 4 (versus the baseline period) was expressed as 
      the geometric mean ratio of fecal radioactivity in weeks 2 to 4 compared with
      baseline. RESULTS: Ibuprofen caused significantly (P <0.001) greater
      gastrointestinal blood loss (geometric mean ratio of 5.2, 95% confidence interval
      [CI]: 4.2 to 6.3) than the 25-mg dose of rofecoxib (2.6, 95% CI: 2.2 to 3.1), the
      50-mg dose of rofecoxib (2.6, 95% CI: 2.2 to 3.0), or placebo (2.1, 95% CI: 1.8
      to 2.5). In contrast, gastrointestinal blood loss with both doses of rofecoxib
      were equivalent to placebo by a predetermined clinical similarity bound.
      CONCLUSIONS: In healthy subjects, treatment with rofecoxib, at 2 to 4 times the
      doses that are currently recommended for the treatment of patients with
      osteoarthritis, produced significantly less fecal blood loss than a therapeutic
      dose of ibuprofen and was equivalent to placebo.

TI  - Steady-state pharmacokinetics of lithium in healthy volunteers receiving
      concomitant meloxicam.
PG  - 197-204
AB  - AIMS: This open, controlled study investigated the effect of concomitant 15 mg
      oral meloxicam on the pharmacokinetics of lithium in healthy male volunteers.
      METHODS: On days 1-14 lithium was coadministered with meloxicam to 16 volunteers;
      on days 10-14 lithium was administered in individualized dosage regimes to
      achieve stable lithium plasma concentrations in the lower therapeutic range of
      0.3-0.7 mmol l(-1). A 12 h steady-state concentration profile for lithium was
      obtained at day 14, after which meloxicam was withdrawn. The lithium dose
      remained unchanged from day 15 to day 22, at which time a second lithium
      concentration profile was determined. RESULTS: Lithium and meloxicam were well
      tolerated throughout the study and all 16 volunteers completed the study. Lithium
      predose concentrations (Cpre,ss) and area under the curve (AUCss) values both
      increased by 21% (paired t-test P = 0.0002; 90% confidence intervals for
      test/reference ratios: 113-130% and 115-128%, respectively) when lithium was
      coadministered with meloxicam compared with values obtained for lithium alone.
      The geometric mean lithium Cpre,ss was 0.65 mmol l(-1) when coadministered with
      meloxicam and 0.54 mmol l(-1) for lithium alone. Lithium Cmax,ss values were
      increased by 16% by coadministration of meloxicam, from 0.97 mmol l(-1) to 1.12
      mmol l(-1). The total plasma clearance of lithium was lower with concomitant
      meloxicam administration (82.5% of value for lithium alone). CONCLUSIONS:
      Meloxicam (15 mg) moderately increased the plasma concentration of lithium in
      healthy volunteers, but by a magnitude thought to be of low clinical relevance.
      Nevertheless, lithium plasma concentrations should be closely monitored in
      patients receiving concomitant meloxicam and lithium therapy.

PG  - 221-4
AB  - In 5 random groups of Wistar rats (n = 15 for each group), ulcerogenic doses of
      NSAIDs COX-1-COX-2 inhibitors such as indomethacin were compared with Celecoxib
      (COX-2 inhibitor); the production of antrum gastric ulcers and bowel and colon
      necrotic areas was studied. Celecoxib was given each 12 hs orally and
      subcutaneously during 5 days and gastrointestinal lesions were not found; in
      contrast, Celecoxib given after indomethacin aggravated antrum gastric ulcers (p 
      < 0.001); intestinal massive necrosis and death were observed in all the rats. We
      conclude that Celecoxib does not induce gastrointestinal lesions in healthy
      mucosa; in contrast, Celecoxib amplifies the gastrointestinal lesions induced by 
      indomethacin.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics, COX-2 specificity, and tolerability of supratherapeutic doses
      of rofecoxib in humans.
PG  - 167-74
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Prostaglandin synthesis is catalyzed by a constitutive cyclo-oxygenase
      isoform (COX-1) and an inducible isoform (COX-2). It is hypothesized that the
      analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
      (nonspecific COX-1/COX-2 inhibitors) such as ibuprofen principally derive from
      COX-2 inhibition. The purpose of this study was to evaluate steady-state
      pharmacokinetics, biochemical selectivity and tolerability of rofecoxib (Vioxx), 
      characterized in vitro as a COX-2 inhibitor. METHODS: Four panels of healthy men 
      (n = 8 per panel) were administered rofecoxib (n = 6) (25, 100, 250, 375 mg) or
      placebo (n = 2) once daily on day 1 and days 3-14. Blood samples for assays of
      rofecoxib plasma concentration and COX isoform activity were obtained pre-dose
      and at specified time points post-dose. RESULTS: Rofecoxib pharmacokinetics were 
      found to be complex and nonlinear. Elimination half-life ranged from 9.9 h to
      17.5 h after multiple dosing with an accumulation ratio close to 2 for all doses.
      COX-2 inhibitory activity as assessed by average inhibition of whole blood
      lipopolysaccharide-stimulated prostaglandin E2 over the 8-h post-dose period on
      day 14 was 0.3, 67, 96, 92 and 96% for the placebo and the 25-, 100-, 250- and
      375-mg treatment groups, respectively. No treatment group showed significant
      inhibition of COX-1 as assessed by thromboxane B2 generation in clotting whole
      blood. Side effects were mild and transient. CONCLUSION: The results indicate
      that rofecoxib is a potent and specific inhibitor of COX-2 in humans even at
      doses more than tenfold higher than those associated with efficacy in patients
      with osteoarthritis.

TI  - The effect of celecoxib, a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, in familial adenomatous
      polyposis.
PG  - 1946-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with familial adenomatous polyposis have a nearly 100
      percent risk of colorectal cancer. In this disease, the chemopreventive effects
      of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs may be related to their inhibition of
      cyclooxygenase-2. METHODS: We studied the effect of celecoxib, a selective
      cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, on colorectal polyps in patients with familial
      adenomatous polyposis. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we randomly
      assigned 77 patients to treatment with celecoxib (100 or 400 mg twice daily) or
      placebo for six months. Patients underwent endoscopy at the beginning and end of 
      the study. We determined the number and size of polyps from photographs and
      videotapes; the response to treatment was expressed as the mean percent change
      from base line. RESULTS: At base line, the mean (+/-SD) number of polyps in focal
      areas where polyps were counted was 15.5+/-13.4 in the 15 patients assigned to
      placebo, 11.5+/-8.5 in the 32 patients assigned to 100 mg of celecoxib twice a
      day, and 12.3+/-8.2 in the 30 patients assigned to 400 mg of celecoxib twice a
      day (P=0.66 for the comparison among groups). After six months, the patients
      receiving 400 mg of celecoxib twice a day had a 28.0 percent reduction in the
      mean number of colorectal polyps (P=0.003 for the comparison with placebo) and a 
      30.7 percent reduction in the polyp burden (the sum of polyp diameters)
      (P=0.001), as compared with reductions of 4.5 and 4.9 percent, respectively, in
      the placebo group. The improvement in the extent of colorectal polyposis in the
      group receiving 400 mg twice a day was confirmed by a panel of endoscopists who
      reviewed the videotapes. The reductions in the group receiving 100 mg of
      celecoxib twice a day were 11.9 percent (P=0.33 for the comparison with placebo) 
      and 14.6 percent (P=0.09), respectively. The incidence of adverse events was
      similar among the groups. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with familial adenomatous
      polyposis, six months of twice-daily treatment with 400 mg of celecoxib, a
      cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, leads to a significant reduction in the number of
      colorectal polyps.

PG  - 655-63
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the effects of celecoxib, an
      anti-inflammatory/analgesic agent that primarily inhibits COX-2 and not COX-1 at 
      therapeutic doses, on the steady-state pharmacokinetic profile and
      hypoprothrombinemic effect of racemic warfarin in healthy volunteers. Twenty-four
      healthy adult volunteers on maintenance doses of racemic warfarin (2-5 mg daily),
      stabilized to prothrombin times (PT) 1.2 to 1.7 times pretreatment PT values for 
      3 consecutive days, were randomized to receive concomitant celecoxib (200 mg bid)
      or placebo for 7 days in an open-label, multiple-dose, randomized,
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of warfarin pharmacokinetics and PT.
      Steady-state exposure of S- and R-warfarin (area under the curve [AUC]) and
      maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) in subjects receiving celecoxib were within
      2% to 8% of the warfarin AUC and Cmax in subjects receiving placebo during the
      concomitant treatment period. In addition, PT values were not significantly
      different in subjects receiving warfarin and celecoxib concomitantly compared
      with subjects receiving warfarin and placebo. In conclusion, concomitant
      administration of celecoxib has no significant effect on PT or steady-state
      pharmacokinetics of S- or R-warfarin in healthy volunteers.

TI  - Treatment of acute low back pain with the COX-2-selective anti-inflammatory drug 
      nimesulide: results of a randomized, double-blind comparative trial versus
      ibuprofen.
PG  - 1579-85
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, randomized double-blind comparative trial.
      OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of nimesulide, a
      cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-selective anti-inflammatory agent versus ibuprofen in
      patients with acute lumbosacral back pain. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA:
      Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been more effective than
      placebo in patients with uncomplicated acute low back pain in previous randomized
      controlled trials. The efficacy and tolerability of a new COX-2-selective
      anti-inflammatory drug have not yet been established. METHODS: One hundred four
      patients aged 18-65 years with acute low back pain were enrolled. The patients
      were randomly allocated either to oral nimesulide (100 mg twice daily for 10
      days) or oral ibuprofen (600 mg three times daily for 10 days). Outcome measures 
      on a visual analog scale were an average of the pain intensity and the pain
      relief, stiffness in the back, functional status, and the results of physical
      examinations. All side effects were recorded at each visit. RESULTS: With both
      study therapies, there was a clear improvement in all measured parameters of the 
      pain and back function parameters measured from the third day of treatment
      onward. The patients' capacity for daily tasks, showed improvement in both groups
      (P < 0. 001), but a statistically significant difference was found between the
      two groups in favor of the nimesulide group (P < 0.05) after 10 days. Nimesulide 
      was more effective than ibuprofen in improved lateral bending measurements (P =
      0.026). Nimesulide and ibuprofen provided similar degrees of improvement in the
      modified Schober tests and in the pain intensity and back stiffness scores. More 
      gastrointestinal side effects were reported with ibuprofen than nimesulide, and
      the comparison showed a trend (P = 0.067). Ten side effects occurred in the
      nimesulide group in 7 (13%) patients and 13 in the ibuprofen group in 11 (21%)
      patients. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirmed that the COX-2-selective inhibitor
      nimesulide is an effective and well-tolerated agent for use in general practices 
      to treat acute low back pain. The incidence of gastrointestinal side effects
      seems to be lower with nimesulide than with ibuprofen.

TI  - Effects of celecoxib and naproxen on renal function in the elderly.
PG  - 1465-70
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of celecoxib, a cyclooxygenase 2-specific
      inhibitor, with the nonspecific cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 inhibitor naproxen on
      renal function in 29 healthy elderly subjects in a single-blind, randomized,
      crossover study. METHODS: Subjects received either celecoxib, 200 mg twice daily,
      for 5 days followed by celecoxib, 400 mg twice daily, for the next 5 days, or
      they received naproxen, 500 mg twice daily, for 10 days. After a 7-day washout,
      subjects were crossed over to receive the other regimen. RESULTS: After the first
      dose, the trend was for a greater decrease in glomerular filtration rate with
      naproxen (-5.31 mL/min per 1.73 m2) compared with celecoxib (-0.86 mL/min per
      1.73 m2). The treatment difference became statistically significant on day 6
      (-7.53 vs -1.11 mL/min per 1.73 m2 for naproxen and celecoxib, respectively;
      P=.004). Urinary prostaglandin E2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1alpha excretion was 
      significantly reduced from baseline across the treatment interval with both
      celecoxib and naproxen (P< or =.04). There were no significant differences in
      prostaglandin excretion between these 2 agents (P> or =.07). Small, transient
      decreases (P<.05) in urinary sodium excretion were observed after the initiation 
      of both celecoxib and naproxen treatment. Sodium excretion values returned to
      baseline by the end of the study. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that
      cyclooxygenase 2-specific inhibition in healthy elderly subjects may spare renal 
      hemodynamic function, although the effects on sodium excretion, as well as
      urinary prostaglandin E2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1alpha excretion, appear to be
      similar to those of nonspecific cyclooxygenase inhibitors such as naproxen.

TI  - Effect of regulated expression of human cyclooxygenase isoforms on eicosanoid and
      isoeicosanoid production in inflammation.
PG  - 1473-82
AB  - To examine the role of cyclooxygenase (COX) isozymes in prostaglandin formation
      and oxidant stress in inflammation, we administered to volunteer subjects placebo
      or bolus injections of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which caused a dose-dependent
      increase in temperature, heart rate, and plasma cortisol. LPS caused also
      dose-dependent elevations in urinary excretion of 2,3-dinor 6-keto PGF(1alpha)
      (PGI-M) and 11-dehydro thromboxane B(2) (Tx-M). Platelet COX-1 inhibition by
      chronic administration of low-dose aspirin before LPS did not alter the
      symptomatic and febrile responses to LPS, but the increment in urinary PGI-M and 
      Tx-M were both partially depressed. Pretreatment with ibuprofen, a nonspecific
      COX inhibitor, attenuated the febrile and systemic response to LPS and inhibited 
      prostanoid biosynthesis. Both celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, and
      ibuprofen attenuated the pyrexial, but not the chronotropic, response to LPS.
      Experimental endotoxemia caused differential expression of the COX isozymes in
      monocytes and polymorphonuclear leucocytes ex vivo. LPS also increased urinary
      iPF(2alpha)-III, iPF(2alpha)-VI, and 8,12-iso-iPF(2alpha)-VI, isoprostane (iP)
      indices of lipid peroxidation, and none of the drugs blunted this response. These
      studies indicate that (a) although COX-2 predominates, both COX isozymes are
      induced and contribute to the prostaglandin response to LPS in humans; (b) COX
      activation contributes undetectably to lipid peroxidation induced by LPS; and (c)
      COX-2, but not COX-1, contributes to the constitutional response to LPS in
      humans.

TI  - [Concept for nationwide cooperation in planning and implementing multicenter
      studies].
PG  - 50-2
AB  - In Germany, good clinical multicenter studies that are not supported by
      pharmaceutical companies are rarely performed. Good supranational
      industry-sponsored studies are usually aimed at the registration of new
      (expensive) drugs. The preconditions for co-operation in conducting
      industry-independent studies which are of interest for the scientific community
      have been improved substantially in Germany by instituting the working group of
      co-operating arthritis centers, the so-called core documentation where 32,000
      patients with rheumatic conditions were documented in 1997 and the institution of
      a sophisticated information system ("RheumaNet"). The executive board of the
      German Rheumatology Association has set up an "ad hoc commission" that agreed to 
      institute a "Committee for the Coordination of Clinical Studies in Rheumatic
      Diseases". In this committee rheumatologists subspecialized from medicine,
      orthopedic, pediatrics working in universities, hospitals and private practice as
      well as specialists in statistics and epidemiology shall be represented. In
      principle this committee is independent of the co-operating arthritis centers and
      the RheumaNet. All members of the German Rheumatology Association are invited to 
      cooperate with this committee by contributing to the clinically important
      questions and participating in clinical studies. The committee has to define key 
      questions in rheumatology and shall plan and organize multicenter studies to
      answer these questions. In addition, study protocols of pharmaceutical companies 
      may be examined as to their importance, quality, and feasibility.

AB  - We studied 36 patients, allocated randomly to receive meloxicam 15 mg rectally (n
      = 18) or placebo suppository (n = 18) before total abdominal hysterectomy in a
      double-blind study. Visual analogue scores for pain at rest (P < 0.005), on
      movement (P < 0.05) and on coughing (P < 0.05) were significantly decreased in
      the meloxicam group during the first 24 h after surgery. Mean 24-h PCA morphine
      requirements were 33.2 (SD 16.9) mg and 38.2 (20.8) mg in the meloxicam and
      placebo groups, respectively (ns). There was no difference in the incidence of
      nausea, vomiting or sedation between groups.

TI  - A comparison of nimesulide beta cyclodextrin and nimesulide in postoperative
      dental pain.
PG  - 345-8
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of single doses
      of nimesulide beta cyclodextrin compared with nimesulide in patients with dental 
      pain following surgical procedures. This was a randomised, double-blind,
      between-patient, multicentre study involving 148 outpatients suffering from
      moderate to severe pain, who received single doses of either 400 mg nimesulide
      beta cyclodextrin or 100 mg nimesulide. The principal criterion for efficacy was 
      pain intensity assessed on a visual analogue scale (VAS) 15 minutes after drug
      intake. Pain intensity was further evaluated 30, 45, 90, 120, 180, 240 and 360
      minutes after dosing. Pain relief was evaluated at the same time points by means 
      of a categorical scale. The time point of first pain relief, the use of rescue
      medication and the global evaluation of efficacy were also recorded. The
      reduction in pain intensity was significantly more pronounced in the nimesulide
      beta cyclodextrin group at 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes (p < 0.01). Pain relief was 
      significantly greater (p < 0.05) and more rapid with nimesulide beta
      cyclodextrin. In the patient overall assessment of efficacy, nimesulide beta
      cyclodextrin and nimesulide were rated excellent or good by 95% and 92%
      respectively; only one patient in the nimesulide beta cyclodextrin group needed
      rescue medication. Both study drugs were effective and well tolerated in the
      treatment of acute dental pain, with nimesulide beta cyclodextrin showing a
      faster onset of analgesic action.

TI  - Effects of celecoxib, a novel cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, on platelet function in
      healthy adults: a randomized, controlled trial.
PG  - 124-32
AB  - Conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) nonspecifically
      inhibit cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), an enzyme critical to normal platelet function,
      and COX-2, which mediates inflammatory response mechanisms. Celecoxib, an
      antiarthritic agent that inhibits COX-2 but spares COX-1 at therapeutic doses, is
      expected to have minimal effects on platelet function. A double-blind,
      randomized, placebo-controlled study of 10 days' duration was conducted in 24
      healthy adults to compare the effects on platelet function of a supratherapeutic 
      dose of celecoxib (600 mg bid) with a standard dose of naproxen (500 mg bid), a
      conventional NSAID. Ex vivo platelet aggregation in response to standard agonists
      (collagen, arachidonate, or U46619 [a thromboxane A2 receptor agonist]), bleeding
      time, and serum thromboxane B2 (TxB2) level were measured. Unlike celecoxib or
      placebo, naproxen produced statistically significant reductions in platelet
      aggregation and serum TxB2 levels and increased bleeding time. The results
      indicate that even at supratherapeutic doses, celecoxib will not interfere with
      normal mechanisms of platelet aggregation and hemostasis, supporting the premise 
      that celecoxib is COX-1 sparing relative to conventional NSAIDs.

TI  - Comparative efficacy and tolerability of nimesulide and piroxicam in
      osteoarthritis with specific reference to chondroprotection: a double blind
      randomised study.
PG  - 442-5
AB  - The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy, tolerability and
      chondroprotection afforded by nimesulide, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor 
      and piroxicam in a randomised, double blind, controlled clinical trial in 90
      patients suffering from osteoarthritis of the knee joint. A significant
      improvement in the osteoarthritis severity index at 2 weeks (p < 0.01) and an
      improvement in physicians assessment of global arthritic condition at 4 weeks (p 
      < 0.01) was seen with both the treatments. A significant decrease in articular
      index of joint tenderness (p < 0.05) at 8 weeks and in self assessment of
      handicap at 4 weeks (p < 0.05), in comparison to baseline, was observed only in
      patients receiving nimesulide. Rescue therapy was required by a greater
      percentage of patients being administered piroxicam. Functional capacity improved
      in 64% of the patients on nimesulide and 74.5% of the patients receiving
      piroxicam. Adverse effects were observed in 6 patients on nimesulide and 9
      patients receiving piroxicam. No significant difference was found in any of the
      efficacy and tolerability parameters between the two treatment groups. Magnetic
      resonance imaging evaluation of the knee joint of 10 patients showed no
      significant change in the articular cartilage and associated joint structures
      after 6 months of therapy with both the treatments. The results show that
      nimesulide and piroxicam are comparable in efficacy and tolerability in patients 
      suffering from osteoarthritis.

TI  - Synergistic effects of new chemopreventive agents and conventional cytotoxic
      agents against human lung cancer cell lines.
PG  - 6178-84
AB  - Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells have constitutively high expression of
      cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and cyclooxygenase (COX) 2. These NSCLC cells 
      also have increased prostaglandin expression (PGE2). Many lung cancers also
      express 12-lipoxygenase RNA and 12-lipoxygenase protein and biosynthesize
      12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, which correlates with their metastatic
      potential. Several studies have demonstrated that COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitors
      could inhibit the in vitro growth of human lung cancer cell lines. In this
      report, we evaluated the growth-inhibitory effects of sulindac sulfide, a COX-1
      and COX-2 inhibitor; exisulind (sulindac sulfone), a novel proapoptotic agent
      that does not inhibit COX enzymes; and nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), a
      lipoxygenase inhibitor on human lung cancer cell lines. We compared these effects
      with those of 13-cis-retinoic acid, a chemoprevention agent, and with the
      cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents paclitaxel and cisplatin, alone or in
      combination. Our goal was to develop new chemoprevention and treatment
      strategies. Each of the six agents tested inhibited the in vitro growth of three 
      NSCLC and three SCLC cell lines at the highest concentration. Paclitaxel was the 
      most potent agent (IC50 = 0.003-0.150 microM); sulindac sulfide, NDGA, and
      13-cis-retinoic acid had intermediate potency (IC50 = 4-80 microM), and cisplatin
      and exisulind were the least potent (IC50 = 150-500 microM). Combination studies 
      showed synergistic interactions for sulindac sulfide, exisulind, and NDGA with
      paclitaxel, cisplatin, and 13-cis-retinoic acid, regardless of drug-resistance
      phenotype. At high concentrations, the combination of 13-cis-retinoic acid and
      each of the five other drugs resulted in a strong synergistic effect. These
      studies provide a rationale for chemoprevention (exisulind +/- retinoic acid +/- 
      NDGA) and therapeutic (exisulind +/- paclitaxel +/- cisplatin) studies in
      patients at risk for, or with, lung cancer.

TI  - The use of nimesulide in patients with acetylsalicylic acid and nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drug intolerance.
PG  - 657-63
AB  - Intolerance or idiosyncrasy to acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and other nonsteroidal 
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is a crucial problem because these drugs are
      frequently used in medical treatment. In this study, we tested whether
      nimesulide, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, might be a valid
      alternative for patients with histories of adverse reaction to ASA or NSAIDs. A
      single-blind, placebo-controlled oral challenge procedure was applied to 60 adult
      patients (19 male, 41 female; with a mean age of 40.31 +/- 10.44 years, range
      20-68 years) with a reliable history of ASA/NSAIDs-intolerance. According to
      history, the clinical presentations of intolerance were urticaria/angioedema in
      32 patients, anaphylactoid reaction in 2 patients, respiratory reaction in 19
      patients, and respiratory and cutaneous reaction in 7 patients. Atopy was
      confirmed by means of skin prick test with inhalant allergens. Oral challenge
      protocol was started with 25 mg of nimesulide and the remaining 75 mg was given 1
      hr later. During the challenge procedure, blood pressure, pulse, nasoocular,
      pulmonary, and cutaneous symptoms were monitored. Of the 60 patients tested, 55
      (91.7%) tolerated the drug with no adverse reaction. Only five (8.3%) patients
      demonstrated a positive response to oral challenge. The clinical presentations of
      intolerance to nimesulide were urticaria/angioedema in three patients, mild
      rhinitis in one patient, and mild dyspnea in one patient. The atopy prevalence
      was higher, with a ratio of 41.7%, in patients with ASA/NSAIDs intolerance than
      that of the healthy adult population in Turkey (p < 0.05). We believe that
      nimesulide can be used as an alternative drug for patients with ASA/NSAIDs
      intolerance.

TI  - Celecoxib, a specific COX-2 inhibitor, has no significant effect on methotrexate 
      pharmacokinetics in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
PG  - 2539-43
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of celecoxib, a specific inhibitor of
      cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) on the renal clearance and plasma pharmacokinetic
      profile of stable methotrexate (MTX) doses in patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
      (RA). METHODS: Fourteen adult female patients with RA taking a stable weekly dose
      of MTX (5 to 15 mg/wk) for a minimum of 3 months were randomized to receive
      concomitantly either celecoxib (200 mg BID) or placebo for a period of 7 days in 
      a single blind, 2 period crossover study of MTX pharmacokinetics and renal
      clearance. RESULTS: The plasma pharmacokinetic profile of MTX did not change
      significantly when celecoxib or a placebo was coadministered. The mean renal
      clearance of MTX alone, 7.98+/-2.18 l/h, was virtually unchanged by
      coadministration of celecoxib (7.94+/-1.61 l/h) or placebo (7.97+/-1.19 l/h).
      CONCLUSION: Celecoxib has no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics or renal 
      clearance of MTX in patients with RA, although these results should be confirmed 
      in prospective studies of elderly and renally impaired patients.

TI  - Selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors aggravate ischaemia-reperfusion injury in 
      the rat stomach.
PG  - 1659-66
AB  - 1. Effects of indomethacin, the selective cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors
      NS-398 and DFU, and dexamethasone on gastric damage induced by 30 min ischaemia
      followed by 60 min reperfusion (I-R) were investigated in rats. Modulation of
      gastric levels of COX-1 and COX-2 mRNA by I-R was evaluated using Northern blot
      and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. 2. I-R-induced gastric
      damage was dose-dependently aggravated by administration of indomethacin (1 - 10 
      mg kg(-1)), NS-398 (0.4 - 4 mg kg(-1)) or DFU (0.02 - 2 mg kg(-1)) as assessed
      macroscopically and histologically. 3. Likewise, administration of dexamethasone 
      (1 mg kg(-1)) significantly increased I-R damage. 4. Low doses of 16,
      16-dimethyl-prostaglandin(PG)E(2), that did not protect against ethanol-induced
      mucosal damage, reversed the effects of the selective COX-2 inhibitors,
      indomethacin and dexamethasone. 5. I-R had no effect on gastric COX-1 mRNA levels
      but increased COX-2 mRNA levels in a time-dependent manner. Dexamethasone
      inhibited the I-R-induced expression of COX-2 mRNA. 6. I-R was not associated
      with a measurable increase in gastric mucosal formation of 6-keto-PGF(1alpha) and
      PGE(2). PG formation was substantially inhibited by indomethacin (10 mg kg(-1))
      but was not significantly reduced by NS-398 (4 mg kg(-1)), DFU (2 mg kg(-1)) or
      dexamethasone (1 mg kg(-1)). 7. The findings indicate that selective COX-2
      inhibitors and dexamethasone markedly enhance gastric damage induced by I-R.
      Thus, whereas COX-2 has no essential role in the maintenance of gastric mucosal
      integrity under basal conditions, COX-2 is rapidly induced in a pro-ulcerogenic
      setting and contributes to mucosal defence by minimizing injury. This suggests
      that in certain situations selective COX-2 inhibitors may have gastrotoxic
      effects.

TI  - Comparison of rofecoxib and celecoxib, two cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, in
      postoperative dental pain: a randomized, placebo- and
      active-comparator-controlled clinical trial.
PG  - 1653-63
AB  - Pain is a common complaint, often occurring in conjunction with inflammation.
      Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most commonly used
      analgesic agents in ambulatory patients. In recent studies, the cyclooxygenase-2 
      (COX-2) inhibitor rofecoxib demonstrated analgesic effects similar to those of
      NSAIDs in the treatment of acute pain and primary dysmenorrhea. The present
      randomized, single-dose, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo- and
      active-comparator-controlled, parallel-group study was undertaken to compare the 
      analgesic efficacy of the COX-2 inhibitors rofecoxib 50 mg and celecoxib 200 mg
      with that of ibuprofen 400 mg and placebo in patients with postoperative dental
      pain. Two hundred and seventy-two patients experiencing pain after the removal of
      > or =2 third molars were randomized according to pain severity (moderate vs
      severe) to receive a single dose of placebo (n = 45), rofecoxib 50 mg (n = 90),
      celecoxib 200 mg (n = 91), or ibuprofen 400 mg (n = 46). Using a patient diary,
      patients recorded pain intensity, pain relief, and global evaluations throughout 
      the 24-hour period after dosing. The overall analgesic effect, onset of action,
      peak effect, and duration of effect were evaluated, with the primary end point
      being total pain relief over 8 hours (TOPAR8). The safety profile was assessed on
      the basis of physical findings, laboratory results, and spontaneous reports of
      adverse experiences. The results showed that compared with celecoxib, rofecoxib
      had superior analgesic effects on all measures of analgesic efficacy, including
      overall analgesic effect (TOPAR8, 18.3 vs. 12.5; P<0.001), time to onset of
      effect (30 vs. 60 minutes; P = 0.003), peak pain relief (score, 2.8 vs 2.3;
      P<0.05), and duration of effect (>24 vs. 5.1 hours; P<0.001). In addition,
      rofecoxib's analgesic efficacy was similar to that of ibuprofen (TOPAR8, 18.3 vs.
      17.0; P = 0.460), but the duration was longer (P<0.05); with ibuprofen, the time 
      to on set was 24 minutes, peak pain relief score was 2.9, and duration of
      analgesic effect was 8.9 hours. The safety profile was similar across all
      treatment groups. Thus rofecoxib provided analgesic efficacy superior to that of 
      celecoxib and comparable to that of ibuprofen in the treatment of patients with
      acute postoperative dental pain.

TI  - Defining disease activity in ankylosing spondylitis: is a combination of
      variables (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index) an appropriate
      instrument?
PG  - 878-82
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Disease activity has been defined using a self-administered
      instrument, focusing on fatigue, axial pain, peripheral pain, enthesopathy and
      morning stiffness [Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)]. 
      This validated instrument is simple and takes 40 s to complete, but whether the
      index is an accurate expression of the component parts, or whether additional
      weighting would enhance its efficacy, is unclear. METHODS: Four hundred and
      seventy-three patients with ankylosing spondylitis received placebo or active
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) for 6 weeks, and changes between
      entry and completion were captured by BASDAI and the individual components.
      Principle component analysis (PCA) was used to explore the best combinations of
      variables in decreasing order of explained total dispersion and to assess whether
      a single sum (or algebraic expression) best defined disease activity status.
      RESULTS: At entry, the correlation between BASDAI and the first axis was 0.99,
      0.11 with the second, and zero thereafter. Data at study end and relating to
      change revealed a 100% correlation (R = 1) between the first axis and the sum,
      with zero for the remainder. CONCLUSIONS: The data support BASDAI as being a
      valid and appropriate composite to define disease activity in ankylosing
      spondylitis. Developed as a simple sum of its components, BASDAI has excellent
      content validity.

TI  - Rofecoxib, a specific cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, in primary dysmenorrhea: a
      randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 504-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether rofecoxib is effective for treating primary
      dysmenorrhea and whether cyclooxygenase-2 is involved in the pathophysiology of
      primary dysmenorrhea. METHODS: A double-masked, randomized, placebo and
      active-comparator-controlled clinical trial including 127 subjects with histories
      of primary dysmenorrhea was conducted in an outpatient clinical research center. 
      Subjects were randomly assigned to placebo, rofecoxib 25 or 50 mg followed by 25 
      mg every 24 hours as needed, or naproxen sodium 550 mg every 12 hours as needed
      for up to 3 days. Subjects took all four treatments in a balanced,
      complete-block, crossover design. Measurements included self-administered
      questionnaires of analgesic efficacy, spontaneous reports of adverse experiences,
      physical examinations, and laboratory safety tests. RESULTS: Rofecoxib 25 and 50 
      mg provided analgesic efficacy greater than placebo (P < or = .006) for the
      primary endpoint of total pain relief over the first 8 hours. For other efficacy 
      endpoints (sum of the pain intensity difference over the first 8 hours, subject's
      global evaluation, peak pain relief, peak pain intensity difference, and time to 
      remedication) both doses of rofecoxib were better than placebo (P < or = .006)
      and were not distinguishable from naproxen sodium for all efficacy endpoints. All
      treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Rofecoxib effectively treated primary
      dysmenorrhea, and cyclooxygenase-2-derived prostanoids play a role in the
      pathophysiology of primary dysmenorrhea.

TI  - Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and renal response to exercise: a
      comparison of indomethacin and nabumetone.
PG  - 457-65
AB  - Nabumetone, a newer non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) which
      preferentially blocks cyclo-oxygenase-2 activity, may be less nephrotoxic than
      indomethacin. This study tested whether nabumetone has effects different from
      those of indomethacin on exercise-induced changes in renal function and the
      renin-aldosterone system. In a randomized fashion, ten subjects were studied
      after indomethacin (100 mg), nabumetone (1 g) or no medication (control)
      administered orally at 22.00 hours on the day before each study day, and again at
      8.00 hours upon arrival at the laboratory. Renal function was studied at
      baseline, during graded 20-min exercise sessions at 25%, 50% and 75% of the
      maximal oxygen uptake rate, and subsequently during two 1-h recovery periods.
      Heart rate, arterial blood pressure, cardiac output and plasma catecholamines at 
      rest and during exercise were not altered by indomethacin or nabumetone.
      Indomethacin decreased urinary rates of excretion of 6-oxo-prostaglandin
      F(1alpha) (6-oxo-PGF(1alpha)) and thromboxane B(2) in all study periods.
      Nabumetone decreased 6-oxo-PGF(1alpha) excretion during and after exercise.
      Excretion rates for PGE(2) did not change. Neither indomethacin nor nabumetone
      changed baseline values or exercise-induced decreases in renal plasma flow or
      glomerular filtration rate. Indomethacin, but not nabumetone, decreased sodium
      excretion, urine flow rate and free water clearance. The renal response to
      exercise, however, remained unchanged. In contrast with nabumatone, indomethacin 
      decreased the plasma renin concentration. Thus, during exercise, nabumetone may
      decrease the excretion of 6-oxo-PGF(1alpha) by inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase-1 or
      by inhibition of specific exercise-induced activation of cyclo-oxygenase-2, or
      both. None of the drugs changed the renal response to exercise. Inhibition by
      indomethacin of angiotensin II and thromboxane A(2) synthesis may, during
      exercise, counterbalance renal vasoconstriction caused by blockade of
      vasodilatory prostaglandins.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of the specific cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor DFP compared
      with naproxen sodium in patients with postoperative dental pain.
PG  - 1301-12
AB  - DFP [3-(2-propyloxy)-(4-methyl-sulfonylphenyl)-(5,5-dimethyl)-fu ranone] is a
      highly specific cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor (>2500-fold selective in transfected
      Chinese hamster ovary cell assays) that has demonstrated efficacy in preclinical 
      models of pain and inflammation. The present single-dose, randomized,
      double-masked, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study was
      undertaken to compare DFP 5, 25, and 50 mg with naproxen sodium 550 mg and with
      placebo in 196 patients (mean age, 25.8 years; 187 [95.4%] males) who experienced
      moderate-to-severe pain after surgical removal of > or =2 third molars. Overall
      analgesic effect, duration of effect, time to onset of analgesic effect, peak
      analgesic effect, and tolerability were assessed over a 24-hour postdose period. 
      Both DFP 25 and 50 mg, as well as the active comparator, naproxen sodium 550 mg, 
      were significantly more effective than placebo. The onset of analgesic effect in 
      the DFP 25-mg, DFP 50-mg, and naproxen sodium 550-mg groups did not differ
      significantly. DFP was generally well tolerated in single doses up to 50 mg. DFP 
      50 mg was efficacious in the treatment of postoperative dental pain and was
      indistinguishable from the active comparator, naproxen sodium 550 mg.

TI  - Analgesic efficacy of the cyclooxygenase-2-specific inhibitor rofecoxib in
      post-dental surgery pain: a randomized, controlled trial.
PG  - 943-53
AB  - Previous data have suggested that rofecoxib, a cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-specific
      inhibitor, had analgesic effects similar to those of the nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs when tested in the post-dental surgery pain model. The
      objective of this parallel-group, double-masked, randomized, placebo- and active 
      comparator-controlled clinical trial was to assess more fully the analgesic
      efficacy of rofecoxib in the treatment of postoperative dental pain. After dental
      surgery, 151 patients (50.3% women; mean age, 18.3 years; 93.4% white)
      experiencing moderate-to-severe pain were to receive a single dose of placebo,
      rofecoxib 50 mg, or ibuprofen 400 mg. Analgesic efficacy was assessed for up to
      24 hours postdose using self-administered questionnaires. Tolerability was
      assessed using spontaneous reports of adverse experiences, physical findings, and
      laboratory measurements. The results of this study demonstrated that rofecoxib 50
      mg was more effective than placebo on all measures of analgesic efficacy.
      Rofecoxib 50 mg exhibited overall analgesic effects, onset of analgesia, and peak
      analgesic effects that were not significantly different from those of ibuprofen
      400 mg, with a significantly longer duration of action (P < 0.05). We concluded
      that rofecoxib was efficacious in the treatment of postoperative dental pain and 
      that COX-2-derived prostanoids play a role in treatment of the pain associated
      with dental surgery.

TI  - Specific inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 with MK-0966 is associated with less
      gastroduodenal damage than either aspirin or ibuprofen.
PG  - 761-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Compared with currently available NSAIDs (which inhibit COX-1 and
      COX-2 isoforms of cyclooxygenase), MK-0966 (a specific COX-2 inhibitor) is
      expected to cause less gastrointestinal toxicity. AIM: To compare the effect on
      the upper gastrointestinal mucosae of a high dose of MK-0966 with that of
      conventional doses of ibuprofen and aspirin. METHODS: Healthy subjects (n = 170; 
      age range 18-54 years) with endoscopically normal gastric and duodenal mucosa
      were randomized to either MK-0966 250 mg q.d. (n = 51), ibuprofen 800 mg t.d.s.
      (n = 51), aspirin 650 mg q.d.s. (n = 17), or placebo (n = 51) in this 7-day,
      double-blind, parallel-group study. The mucosae were evaluated by endoscopy using
      a predefined scale; scores could range from 0 to 4. The primary end-point was the
      percentage of subjects who developed a mucosal score >/= 2 (i.e. the development 
      of one or more erosions). To evaluate COX-1 activity, serum thromboxane B2 levels
      were determined in a subset of the population. RESULTS: The percentage of
      subjects who developed a mucosal score >/= 2 in the MK-0966 group (12%) was
      significantly lower (P < 0.001) than that in the ibuprofen (71%) and aspirin
      (94%) groups, and was similar to that in the placebo group (8%). Only ibuprofen
      and aspirin significantly (P < 0.0001) reduced baseline thromboxane B2 levels.
      All treatments were generally well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: In this acute
      short-term endoscopic study, MK-0966 250 mg q.d. (a dose at least 10 times higher
      than that demonstrated to reduce the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis)
      produced significantly less gastrointestinal mucosal damage than either ibuprofen
      800 mg t.d.s. or aspirin 650 mg q.d.s. and was comparable to placebo in this
      regard.

TI  - Occurrence of allergic conditions in asthmatics with analgesic intolerance.
PG  - 428-35
AB  - BACKGROUND: The study aimed to determine whether allergic conditions accompany
      analgesic intolerance. METHODS: A total of 132 analgesic-intolerant patients with
      bronchial asthma admitted to the adult allergy unit from January 1991 to October 
      1997 and 103 patients with bronchial asthma randomly selected from among the
      asthmatics referred to our department between January and October 1997 were
      enrolled in the study. Those having analgesic intolerance and bronchial asthma
      were accepted as group I; patients having only asthma were accepted as group II. 
      A standard questionnaire was completed for all the patients. Physical
      examination, routine skin prick tests, determination of total IgE levels and
      blood type, and oral analgesic provocation tests were also performed. RESULTS:
      The results showed that some allergic conditions were significantly more common
      in group I (22.7% and 7.8% for food allergy/intolerance [P<0.05], 16.7% and 7.8% 
      for antibiotic allergy, 16.7% and 2.9% for dermographism, 9.8% and 1.0% for metal
      allergy, and 9.1% and 1.0% for chronic urticaria for groups I and II,
      respectively [P<0.001]). In addition, the mean of the total IgE level in the
      serum was higher in group I than group II (77.6 and 53.7 IU/ml; P<0.05), and the 
      cumulative analgesic consumption was more in group I (14.2+/-17.1 and 9.1+/-12.5 
      boxes; P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Dermographism; chronic urticaria; antibiotic, metal,
      and food allergy; high levels of total IgE; and a high amount of cumulative
      analgesic consumption may be the conditions accompanying analgesic intolerance in
      asthmatics.

TI  - Economic comparison of nimesulide and diclofenac, and the incidence of adverse
      events in the treatment of rheumatic disease in Greece.
PG  - 39-46
AB  - In Greece a 15-day treatment of rheumatic disease with diclofenac costs 56% more 
      than treatment with nimesulide. This is due to the lower incidence of
      gastrointestinal adverse events with nimesulide, and the absence of serious
      gastrointestinal complications leading to hospitalization, which more than offset
      the higher acquisition cost of nimesulide. The average saving by using nimesulide
      instead of diclofenac is about US$21 per patient for a 15-day treatment period.

TI  - Ankylosing spondylitis: what is the optimum duration of a clinical study? A one
      year versus a 6 weeks non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug trial.
PG  - 235-44
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To consider the relevance of the duration of a clinical trial in
      ankylosing spondylitis: long-term (i.e. 1 yr) vs short-term (i.e. 6 weeks)
      assessment of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-placebo controlled
      study. METHODS: The design was a prospective, multicentre, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks duration with a 12 months double-blind
      extension. Study drugs were placebo (n = 121) or active NSAID (n = 352). A
      decrease of at least 50% in pain and/or global assessment and/or functional
      impairment during the study defined the response to treatment. The percentage of 
      patients discontinuing the study drug over time (life table analysis) permitted
      the evaluation of both the efficacy and toxicity. RESULTS: Among the 473
      recruited patients, the percentage of responders was similar at 1 yr and week 6
      with a highly statistically significant difference in favour of the active NSAID 
      groups when compared to placebo (at 1 yr, 17% in the placebo group vs 37, 50 and 
      43% in the piroxicam 20 mg, meloxicam 15 mg and meloxicam 22.5 mg, respectively, 
      for the patient's overall assessment) without any statistically significant
      difference between the three active groups. However, evaluation of the patients
      discontinuing the study drug during the 1 yr of the study permitted the detection
      of a statistically significant difference between the active NSAID groups. A
      lower percentage of patients taking meloxicam 22.5 mg had to discontinue the
      study drug when compared to either meloxicam 15 mg or piroxicam 20 mg (37% vs 53%
      and 53%, respectively, P < 0.05). By 52 weeks, drug-related upper
      gastrointestinal adverse events occurred in 13, 32, 20 and 18% in the placebo,
      piroxicam 20 mg, meloxicam 15 mg and meloxicam 22.5 mg groups, respectively. Some
      of the adverse events occurred only after week 6. CONCLUSION: This study suggests
      that a 1 yr trial might be of optimum value compared to a 6 week assessment in
      order to define better the efficacy and tolerability of NSAIDs in ankylosing
      spondylitis.

TI  - Quality of life in arthritis patients using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
PG  - 129-33
AB  - Arthritis is a painful and disabling condition. To suppress the pain and the
      inflammatory process, patients are often chronic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
      drug (NSAID) users. Chronic use of NSAIDs may induce peptic ulcer, dyspeptic
      problems and heartburn. Therefore, these patients are often provided with
      treatment to relieve and/or protect against gastrointestinal problems. Rheumatic 
      disorders also affect a range of health-related quality of life domains. In one
      study, patients with NSAID-associated gastroduodenal lesions complained about
      lack of energy, sleep disturbances, emotional distress and social isolation in
      addition to pain and mobility limitations. The degree of distress and dysfunction
      differed markedly from scores in an unselected population. Clinical trial data
      suggest that acid-suppressing therapy with omeprazole is superior to therapy with
      misoprostol and ranitidine in healing gastroduodenal lesions and preventing
      abdominal pain, heartburn and indigestion symptoms during continued NSAID
      treatment. Because arthritic patients are severely incapacitated by their
      condition regarding most aspects of health-related quality of life, it is
      important to offer a treatment that is effective in healing and preventing
      NSAID-induced ulcers and gastrointestinal symptoms during continued NSAID
      treatment without further compromising the patients' quality of life. Treatment
      with omeprazole once daily has been shown to be superior to that with ranitidine 
      and misoprostol in this respect.

TI  - Systemic biosynthesis of prostacyclin by cyclooxygenase (COX)-2: the human
      pharmacology of a selective inhibitor of COX-2.
PG  - 272-7
AB  - Prostaglandins (PG) are synthesized by two isoforms of the enzyme PG G/H synthase
      [cyclooxygenase (COX)]. To examine selectivity of tolerated doses of an inhibitor
      of the inducible COX-2 in humans, we examined the effects of celecoxib on indices
      of COX-1-dependent platelet thromboxane (Tx) A2 and on systemic biosynthesis of
      prostacyclin in vivo. Volunteers received doses of 100, 400, or 800 mg of
      celecoxib or 800 mg of a nonselective inhibitor, ibuprofen. Ibuprofen, but not
      celecoxib, significantly inhibited TxA2-dependent aggregation, induced ex vivo by
      arachidonic acid (83 +/- 11% vs. 11. 9 +/- 2.2%; P < 0.005) and by collagen.
      Neither agent altered aggregation induced by thromboxane mimetic, U46619.
      Ibuprofen reduced serum TxB2 (-95 +/- 2% vs. -6.9 +/- 4.2%; P < 0.001) and
      urinary excretion of the major Tx metabolite, 11-dehydro TxB2 (-70 +/- 9.9% vs.
      -20.3 +/- 5.3%; P < 0.05) when compared with placebo. Despite a failure to
      suppress TxA2-dependant platelet aggregation, celecoxib had a modest but
      significant inhibitory effect on serum TxB2 4 hr after dosing. By contrast, both 
      ibuprofen and celecoxib suppressed a biochemical index of COX-2 activity
      (endotoxin induced PGE2 in whole blood ex vivo) to a comparable degree (-93.3 +/-
      2% vs. -83 +/- 6.1%). There was no significant difference between the doses of
      celecoxib on COX-2 inhibition. Celecoxib and ibuprofen suppressed urinary
      excretion of the prostacyclin metabolite 2,3 dinor 6-keto PGF1alpha. These data
      suggest that (i) platelet COX-1-dependent aggregation is not inhibited by up to
      800 mg of celecoxib; (ii) comparable COX-2 inhibition is attained by celecoxib
      (100-800 mg) and ibuprofen (800 mg) after acute dosing; and (iii) COX-2 is a
      major source of systemic prostacyclin biosynthesis in healthy humans.

TI  - Effect of selective inhibition of the inducible cyclooxygenase on renin release
      in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 290-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can block renin release
      via inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX). The responsible COX-isoenzyme in man is
      unknown. Therefore, we assessed the effects of meloxicam, a selective inhibitor
      of COX-2, and indomethacin, an unselective inhibitor of COX-1 and COX-2, on
      furosemide stimulated plasma renin activity (PRA). METHODS: In a randomized
      cross-over design 15 healthy female volunteers received no NSAID or meloxicam 7.5
      mg/d for 6 days or indomethacin 25 mg tid for 2 days and 25 mg on the 3rd day. On
      the control day and on the last day of each treatment the following parameters
      were evaluated before and after furosemide 20 mg i.v.: PRA measured by RIA,
      urinary excretion of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) assessed by gas
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, urine volume and urinary excretion of
      sodium, potassium, and creatinine, and serum concentrations of sodium, potassium,
      and creatinine. RESULTS: Furosemide led to a more than two-fold rise of PRA.
      Indomethacin as well as meloxicam had no significant effect on basal PRA but
      inhibited the furosemide-stimulated PRA increase. PGE2 excretion on the control
      day rose two-fold after furosemide. Meloxicam had no effect on basal PGE2
      excretion, whereas indomethacin reduced this parameter by 30%. Both drugs
      inhibited the increase of urinary PGE2 after furosemide. No drug effects on urine
      flow nor on electrolytes and creatinine in serum and urine could be observed.
      CONCLUSION: Meloxicam inhibited furosemide stimulated renin release, suggesting
      that in man COX-2 is responsible for prostaglandin synthesis mediating renin
      release.

TI  - Gastrointestinal tolerability of meloxicam and piroxicam: a double-blind
      placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 133-7
AB  - AIMS: The aim of the study was to compare the effects of meloxicam and piroxicam 
      on the gastroduodenal mucosa in healthy adults. METHODS: Forty-four healthy
      volunteers were given a 28 day course of either meloxicam 15 mg, piroxicam 20 mg 
      or placebo. Damage to the oesophageal, gastric and duodenal mucosa was assessed, 
      mucosal blood flow (MBF) measured at endoscopy and biopsies taken for
      prostaglandin content and microscopic assessment of damage before NSAID
      administration and during days 1, 7 and 28 of continued intake. RESULTS: Maximal 
      macroscopic gastric mucosal damage (median grade+IQR) occurred within 24 h of
      piroxicam administration, the damage score increasing from 0 to 2.5 (0-3)
      (P=0.02) at day 1 before falling to 2.0 (0-2) at day 7 and 0 (0-1) at day 28 with
      resolution of damage observed in six out of the seven subjects who sustained
      acute injury. No significant macroscopic gastric damage occurred in either of the
      two other groups although some minor damage was observed in seven subjects taking
      placebo and five taking meloxicam. There was a trend towards piroxicam causing
      more acute gastric damage than meloxicam (P=0.06). Baseline antral, body and
      duodenal MBF were similar in all three groups. No significant changes occurred in
      any of the groups on any of the visits. There were also no changes in gastric
      mucosal prostaglandin content in any group. CONCLUSIONS: These observations
      suggest that meloxicam causes little acute damage to the upper gastrointestinal
      tract and piroxicam causes some acute gastric injury but such damage resolves in 
      most subjects by 28 days.

TI  - Oral anti-inflammatory and anti-ulcerogenic activities of a hydroalcoholic
      extract and partitioned fractions of Turnera ulmifolia (Turneraceae).
PG  - 215-28
AB  - Anti-inflammatory studies were conducted on rats or mice using a crude
      hydroalcoholic extract of the aerial parts of Turnera ulmifolia and it's
      partitioned fractions, i.e. the aqueous, ethyl acetate and ethanolic fractions.
      The hydroalcoholic extract and it's fractions (aqueous and ethanolic) inhibited
      carrageenan-induced edema. However, only the ethanolic fraction was used in the
      other experiments due to it's yield. The extract also inhibited the cotton pellet
      granuloma and the increase of vascular permeability induced by histamine,
      5-hydroxytryptamine and prostaglandin E2, but not that produced by bradykinin.
      The extract or the fraction did not present analgesic activity in the writhing
      test using acetic acid and did not reduce croton oil-induced ear edema in mice.
      When the ethanolic fraction and LPS were administered i.p. to Balb/C mice 72 h
      before blood or peritoneal fluid collection, no changes were observed in the
      white or total blood cell counts in the peripheral blood. On the other hand,
      changes were observed in both total and differential cell counts in the
      peritoneal exudate since all doses of the fraction reduced the number of total
      leukocytes (mainly lymphocytes) obtained from the peritoneal exudate. In contrast
      to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the administration of the hydroalcoholic
      extract or the ethanolic fraction alone did not potentiate gastric mucosal
      lesions induced by aspirin. The extract and the fraction inhibited the appearance
      of gastric lesions induced by indomethacin, ethanol and pylorus ligature, but not
      those induced by stress. As also observed with carbenoxolone, the ethanolic
      fraction increased the wall mucus in hypothermical-restraint stress-induced
      gastric lesions. The anti-ulcerogenic effect of the extract and of the ethanolic 
      fraction may be related to an increase of mucosal defensive factors, such as
      prostaglandin and mucus. The anti-inflammatory actions of the extract and the
      fraction may be due to an inhibitory effect on histamine and cyclooxygenase II,
      but not on cyclooxygenase I, because the extract and it's fraction present both
      anti-inflammatory and anti-ulcerogenic effects. The major substances present in
      the ethanolic fraction are flavonoids which will be isolated and identified.

TI  - Selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors and their influence on the protective
      effect of a mild irritant in the rat stomach.
PG  - 927-35
AB  - 1. The effects of the non-selective cyclo-oxygenase (COX) inhibitor indomethacin 
      and the selective COX-2 inhibitors, N-[2-(cyclohexyloxy)-4-nitrophenyl]
      methanesulphonamide (NS-398),
      5-methanesulphonamido-6-(2,4-difluorothio-phenyl)-1-indan one (L-745,337) and
      5,5-dimethyl-3-(3-fluorophenyl)-4-(4-methylsulphonyl) phenyl-2(5H)-furanone
      (DFU), on the protection induced by the mild irritant 20% ethanol were
      investigated in the rat stomach. 2. Instillation of 20% ethanol (1 ml, p.o.)
      effectively protected against gastric mucosal injury induced by subsequent
      instillation of 70% or 96% ethanol (1 ml, p.o.). 3. Oral administration of
      indomethacin (1.25-20 mg kg[-1]) dose-dependently counteracted the protective
      effect of 20% ethanol (ID50: 3.5 mg kg[-1]). 4. Likewise, NS-398 (0.1-1 mg
      kg[-1]), L-745,337 (0.2-2 mg kg[-1]) and DFU (0.02-0.2 mg kg[-1]) inhibited the
      protective effect of 20% ethanol in a dose-dependent manner with ID50 values of
      0.3 mg kg(-1), 0.4 mg kg(-1) and 0.06 mg kg(-1), respectively. 5. Inhibition of
      mild irritant-induced protection was also found when NS-398 (1 mg kg[-1]) was
      administered s.c. or when 96% ethanol was used to damage the mucosa. 6.
      Pretreatment with 16,16-dimethyl-prostaglandin (PG)E2 at 4 ng kg(-1), a dose that
      did not protect against ethanol (70%)-induced mucosal damage when given alone,
      completely reversed the effect of the selective COX-2 inhibitors on the mild
      irritant-induced protection. 7. Pretreatment with dexamethasone (3 mg kg(-1), 24 
      and 2 h before instillation of 20% ethanol) did not affect the protective
      activity of the mild irritant, indicating that enzyme induction is not involved. 
      8. Indomethacin (20 mg kg(-1), p.o.) did not prevent the protection conferred by 
      sodium salicylate (100 mg kg[-1]), dimercaprol (30 microg kg[-1]), iodoacetamide 
      (50 mg kg[-1]) and lithium (20 mg kg[-1]). Likewise, the protective effect of
      these agents was not counteracted by NS-398 (1 mg kg(-1), p.o.). 9. Whereas
      indomethacin (20 mg kg(-1), p.o.) near-maximally inhibited gastric mucosal
      formation of PGE2, 6-keto-PGF1alpha and thromboxane (TX) B2 as well as platelet
      TXB2 release, the selective COX-2 inhibitors were ineffective. 10. The findings
      show that selective COX-2 inhibitors, although lacking in ulcerogenic activity,
      prevent the protection conferred by a mild irritant. Prostaglandis generated by a
      constitutive COX-2 could thus contribute to physiological functions involved in
      gastric homeostasis, although at present a non-COX-2-related mechanism underlying
      the effect of the selective COX-2 inhibitors tested on mild irritant-induced
      protection cannot be completely excluded.

TI  - An evaluation of the interaction of meloxicam with frusemide in patients with
      compensated chronic cardiac failure.
PG  - 393-8
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the interaction of meloxicam with frusemide in patients with
      compensated cardiac failure. METHODS: Nineteen patients with Grade II or III
      compensated chronic cardiac failure completed this randomized, double-blind,
      cross-over study. The patients received 40 mg frusemide day(-1) for 7 days.
      Thereafter, patients received either 15 mg meloxicam plus 40 mg frusemide
      day(-1), or one placebo tablet plus 40 mg frusemide day(-1) for 7 days. After a
      washout period of 7 days during which patients received 40 mg frusemide day(-1)
      for 7 days, the patients were crossed over to the alternate treatment. The effect
      of concomitant ingestion of meloxicam and frusemide on frusemide-induced
      diuresis, urine and serum electrolytes, urinary frusemide excretion, and plasma
      frusemide pharmacokinetics was also determined. RESULTS: The estimate (90%
      confidence interval) of the '(frusemide + meloxicam)/(frusemide alone)' mean
      ratio of the variables Cmax, AUC(SS) and Cmax/AUC(SS) for plasma frusemide were
      121% (101% to 145%), 106% (96.4% to 117%), and 114% (98.3% to 132%),
      respectively. Similarly, the estimate (90% confidence interval) of the
      '(frusemide + meloxicam)/(frusemide alone)' of the mean ratio of the variable
      cumulative urinary frusemide excretion after multiple doses of frusemide were
      123% (101% to 150%) for the period 0-8 h, and 122% (105% to 142%) for the period 
      0-24 h after drug administration on day 7. The estimate (90% confidence interval)
      of the '(frusemide + meloxicam)/(frusemide alone)' mean ratio of the
      pharmacodynamic variables cumulative sodium excretion was 105% (95.2% to 116%)
      for the period 0-8 h and 108% (96.5% to 121%) for the period 0-24 h after drug
      administration on day 7. CONCLUSIONS: Meloxicam may lead to slightly increased
      maximum concentrations of frusemide in plasma, as well as to slightly increased
      urinary excretion of frusemide, without affecting the pharmacodynamics of
      frusemide. Thus there is no clinically significant pharmacokinetic or
      pharmacodynamic interaction of meloxicam with frusemide following repeated
      co-administration of meloxicam and frusemide to patients with compensated chronic
      cardiac failure.

TI  - Evaluation of pharmacological profile of meloxicam as an anti-inflammatory agent,
      with particular reference to its relative selectivity for cyclooxygenase-2 over
      cyclooxygenase-1.
PG  - 44-53
AB  - We studied the anti-inflammatory activity of meloxicam on rat carrageenin-induced
      pleurisy and its toxicity for rat gastric mucosa, relative to its in vitro
      inhibitory potency against partially purified cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2
      preparations in order to clarify the pharmacological profile of the compound as
      an anti-inflammatory agent. In rat carrageenin-induced pleurisy, the plasma
      exudation rate peaked at 5 h, at which time COX-2 was detectable in cells from
      the pleural exudate. Meloxicam and piroxicam (1 and 3 mg/kg) and NS-398 (3 mg/kg)
      showed almost equal anti-inflammatory potency against 5-hour pleurisy. A single
      oral administration of the compounds caused a dose-dependent increase in the
      number of rats with gastric mucosal erosion. The ED50 value for meloxicam (5.92
      mg/kg) was significantly higher than that for piroxicam (1.76 mg/kg), indicating 
      that meloxicam is safer. Indometacin showed intermediate safety (2.59 mg/kg). In 
      in vitro experiments, indometacin inhibited COX-1 about 1.7 times more potently
      than COX-2. NS-398 inhibited COX-2 with an IC50 of 0.32 microM, but never
      affected COX-1 activity, even at 100 microM. In the same assay system, meloxicam 
      inhibited COX-2 about 12 times more selectively than COX-1. Piroxicam, however,
      inhibited both isoforms almost equally. These results indicate that meloxicam is 
      a potent anti-inflammatory agent with low gastric toxicity. One reason for its in
      vivo pharmacological profile may be related to its relative selectivity for COX-2
      over COX-1. Thus, meloxicam may belong to a group of COX-2 selective
      anti-inflammatory agents with a better safety profile than conventional COX-1 and
      COX-2 nonselective anti-inflammatory agents.

TI  - Analgesic activity of the novel COX-2 preferring NSAID, meloxicam in
      mono-arthritic rats: central and peripheral components.
PG  - 203-10
AB  - OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: To study the characteristics and site of the analgesic
      action of meloxicam. SUBJECTS: Adult female Wistar rats. TREATMENT: Monoarthritis
      was induced (for behavioural studies) by injection of complete Freund's adjuvant 
      into the ankle. Meloxicam was given for 5 days (0.1-4 mg/kg/ day i.p.).
      Inflammation of the knee or paw (for electrophysiology) was induced with
      carrageenan. Meloxicam was given i.v. (4-64 mg/kg). METHODS: Rats were tested
      daily for joint hyperalgesia, and hindlimb posture (behaviour). At post-mortem,
      joint stiffness, oedema and gastric lesions were assessed. In anaesthetised rats,
      nociceptive reflex responses to stimulation of the paw were compared
      (electrophysiology). Statistics were performed using one-way analysis of
      variance. RESULTS: Meloxicam reduced swelling and stiffness of the inflamed
      joint, joint hyperalgesia (ID50 = 0.4 +/- 0.4 mg/kg/ day) and spontaneous
      pain-related behaviour. It also inhibited peripherally mediated reflex responses 
      to stimulation of inflamed tissue (ID50 = 7.6 +/- 0.8 mg/kg.i.v.) without
      affecting centrally mediated reflexes. CONCLUSIONS: Systemic meloxicam produces
      analgesia largely via peripheral mechanisms. The rapidity of its actions
      indicates a direct effect on sensitised nociceptors.

TI  - A unique metabolite of nimesulide.
PG  - 197-202
AB  - Nimesulide is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug recently detected in equine
      blood and urine samples taken at the race track. The detection of the drug in a
      blood sample led to the identification of an unknown thin-layer chromatographic
      (TLC) spot in track urine samples as a metabolite of nimesulide. Characterization
      of the unknown TLC spot and comparison with the synthesized compound shows that
      the unknown TLC spot is a previously unreported equine metabolite of nimesulide. 
      The metabolite was identified as resulting from the reduction of the nitro group 
      on nimesulide to an amino group. This reduced nitro metabolite
      (4-amino-2-phenoxy-methanesulfonanilide) is a major metabolite of nimesulide in
      the equine.

TI  - Emergency admissions for upper gastrointestinal disease and their relation to
      NSAID use.
PG  - 283-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are considerable variations in estimates of the number of
      emergency upper gastrointestinal admissions per annum which are attributable to
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use. AIM: To obtain a more accurate
      estimate of the number of these emergency admissions per annum in UK. METHODS: A 
      retrospective survey of the case notes of all emergency admissions for upper
      gastrointestinal disease ('Cases') to two English District General Hospitals with
      a combined catchment population of 550,000. Records of all community deaths
      attributed to upper gastrointestinal diagnoses (with the same ICD codes) were
      also surveyed. Matched controls were identified from emergency admissions not
      caused by upper gastrointestinal diagnoses. The proportions of patients taking
      NSAIDs on admission to hospital (or at the time of death at home) and the outcome
      following admission to hospital were analysed. RESULTS: 620 emergency upper
      gastrointestinal admissions were identified and matched with 460 controls. Cases 
      were more likely to be NSAID users than Controls (31% vs. 16%, OR 2.4, 95% CI:
      1.8, 3.3: P < 0.001). Case NSAID use was higher in females and with increasing
      age. As severity of mode of presentation worsened, the probability of NSAID use
      increased (e.g. OR relative to controls for peptic pain 1.9, for perforation
      5.9). Blood transfusion requirements were significantly higher (P < 0.0001) in
      Cases taking NSAIDs, although NSAID use did not influence mortality.
      Extrapolation from these data indicate that there are 65,000 emergency upper
      gastrointestinal admissions per annum in UK; 12,000 of these admissions
      (including 2230 deaths) are attributable to NSAID use. A further 330 attributable
      deaths occur in the community. CONCLUSIONS: There is a strong association between
      NSAID use and propensity for upper gastrointestinal emergency admission; NSAID
      use is associated with significant morbidity and mortality each year in UK.

TI  - Clinical pharmacokinetics of meloxicam.
PG  - 253-8
AB  - Meloxicam (CAS 71125-38-7, UH-AC 62 XX) is a new non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
      drug (NSAID) which was developed for the treatment of osteoarthritis and
      rheumatoid arthritis. The basic clinical pharmacokinetics of meloxicam (7.5-30
      mg) have been investigated in 78 healthy male volunteers after single and
      multiple dosing via oral, intravenous and rectal routes. Plasma concentrations of
      meloxicam were determined by validated high performance liquid chromatography
      (HPLC) methods. The pharmaco-kinetic profile of meloxicam is characterized by
      almost complete absorption over a prolonged phase-avoiding high initial drug
      concentrations- and is bound to plasma proteins by more than 99.5%. Meloxicam is 
      metabolized to four biologically inactive metabolites and excreted in urine and
      faeces with an elimination half-life (t1/2) of around 20 h. This is reflected in 
      a total plasma clearance of 7 to 8 ml/min. Steady state is achieved within 3 to 5
      days. In addition, the pharmacokinetic parameters are linear over the entire dose
      range, there are no changes with multiple dosing and bioequivalence was shown for
      a number of different formulations. The results indicate that meloxicam is
      suitable for once-daily administration and that a switch from one formulation to 
      another is easily possible if necessary or convenient for the patient.

TI  - Drug treatment of rheumatic diseases in the 1990s. Achievements and future
      developments.
PG  - 337-48
AB  - There have been several advances in the therapy of arthritis. These are based on 
      better understanding of the pathogenesis of rheumatic diseases, re-evaluation of 
      previous therapeutic concepts such as combination therapy, and developments
      within biotechnology. There are 4 main areas of development, mainly involving the
      treatment of inflammatory synovitis. The first is with anti-inflammatory drugs,
      where there has been a focus on reducing gastrointestinal toxicity through the
      use of combination preparations such as diclofenac-misoprostol, and the
      introduction of drugs with more selectivity for cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibition such
      as meloxicam. An additional approach has been the development of
      anti-inflammatory drugs such as tenidap which also control cytokine metabolism.
      The second area is slow-acting antirheumatic drugs with the introduction of
      cyclosporin as a single agent or in combination with methotrexate, the
      development of immunomodulating drugs such as leflunomide, and the demonstration 
      that some antibiotics such as minocycline have slow-acting effects. The third
      area is the use of corticosteroids including the development of deflazacort as a 
      bone sparing agent, the greater use of intramuscular depot steroids and the
      validation of low-dose oral corticosteroids in early rheumatoid arthritis.
      Finally, there have been advances in the biotechnology area with the
      demonstration that cytokine immunotherapy such as antibodies to tumour necrosis
      factor can rapidly improve the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, and that T cell 
      immunotherapy with antibodies to the CD4 receptor may be effective in reducing
      synovitis. Many of these agents have not yet been introduced into clinical
      practice but they show the diversity of drug development and suggest the

TI  - Effects of meloxicam and indomethacin on cyclooxygenase pathways in healthy
      volunteers.
PG  - 44-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Meloxicam is a new NSAID with selectivity for the inducible
      cyclooxygenase (COX-2) in vitro. We compared the effects of therapeutically
      equivalent doses of meloxicam and indomethacin, a preferential inhibitor of the
      constitutive cyclooxygenase (COX-1), on platelet aggregation and platelet
      thromboxane formation, which are exclusively COX-1 dependent, physiological
      renal, and total body prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production. METHODS: In a
      randomized cross-over design, 14 healthy female volunteers received meloxicam 7.5
      mg per day for 6 days or indomethacin 25 mg three times per day for 3 days; the
      wash-out period was 5 days, and drug intake was adapted to the menstrual cycle.
      On the day before treatment and on the last day of each treatment period the
      following parameters were evaluated: maximum platelet aggregation and thromboxane
      B2 (TXB2) formation in response to 1.0 mmol/L arachidonic acid; 24-hour urinary
      excretion of PGE2 and 7 alpha-hydroxy-5, 11-diketo-tetranor-prosta-1, 16-dionic
      acid (PGE-M), the index metabolites of renal and total body PGE2 synthesis,
      respectively, were assessed by gas chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry.
      RESULTS: Maximum platelet aggregation and TXB2 formation were almost completely
      inhibited by indomethacin (-87% and -99%, respectively; p < 0.001, each) as
      compared to control (100%), but remained unaffected by meloxicam (-1% and +4%,
      respectively). Meloxicam showed no significant effects on urinary PGE2 excretion 
      (-13%) and only slight effects on PGE-M excretion (-22%; p < 0.05), whereas
      indomethacin reduced urinary PGE2 excretion (-43%; p < 0.05) as well as PGE-M
      excretion (-36%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our data show, that meloxicam 7.5 mg
      per day is COX-1 sparing in humans in vivo.

TI  - A randomized, double-blind, crossover comparative endoscopy study on the
      gastroduodenal tolerability of a highly specific cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor,
      flosulide, and naproxen.
PG  - 126-30
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inhibition of constitutively expressed cyclooxygenase (Cox-1) is
      thought to play an important role in the gastrointestinal toxicity of
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), while their therapeutic action may 
      be due to inhibition of the enzyme Cox-2, which is specifically expressed at
      sites of inflammation. NSAIDs with high affinity and specifity for Cox-2 hold the
      promise of maintaining efficacy without the gastrointestinal side effects of
      conventional NSAIDs. METHODS: We assessed the gastrointestinal tolerability of
      flosulide (20 mg twice a day), a highly selective Cox-2 inhibitor with that of
      naproxen (500 mg twice a day), which has equal affinity for Cox-1 and -2 in 19
      patients with osteoarthrosis in a randomized, double blind, crossover endoscopy
      study. Subjects were treated for 2 weeks with a 2-week washout period.
      Gastroduodenal damage was primarily assessed as by Lanza (grades 0-4). RESULTS:
      No stomach damage was seen in 13 (68%) patients after flosulide and in 5 (37%)
      after naproxen (P < 0.001). Lanza scores were significantly lower after flosulide
      (0.58) than after naproxen (1.47) (P < 0.001; odds ratio, 84.4; 95% confidence
      interval, 1.45-4908). Flosulide was significantly better tolerated (P < 0.005)
      than naproxen. CONCLUSION: These results endorse the idea that highly selective
      Cox-2 inhibitors may be associated with lesser gastrointestinal side effects than
      conventional NSAIDs.

TI  - Lack of interaction between meloxicam and warfarin in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 421-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The effect of multiple oral doses of meloxicam 15 mg on the
      pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of warfarin was investigated in healthy
      male volunteers. Warfarin was administered in an individualized dose to achieve a
      stable reduction in prothrombin times calculated as International Normalized
      Ratio (INR) values. Then INR- and a drug concentration-time profile was
      determined. For the interaction phase, meloxicam was added for 7 days and then
      INR measurements and the warfarin drug profiles were repeated for comparison.
      Overall, warfarin treatment lasted for 30 days. RESULTS: Warfarin and meloxicam
      were well tolerated by healthy volunteers in this study. Thirteen healthy
      volunteers with stable INR values entered the interaction phase. Prothrombin
      times, expressed as mean INR values, were not significantly altered by
      concomitant meloxicam treatment, being 1.20 for warfarin alone and 1.27 for
      warfarin with meloxicam cotreatment. R- and S-warfarin pharmacokinetics were
      similar for both treatments. Geometric mean (% gCV) AUCss values for the more
      potent S-enantiomer were 5.07 mg.h.l-1 (27.5%) for warfarin alone and 5.64
      mg.h.l-1 (28.1%) during the interaction phase. Respective AUCss values for
      R-warfarin were 7.31 mg.h.l-1 (43.8%) and 7.58 mg.h.l-1 (39.1%). CONCLUSION: The 
      concomitant administration of the new non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug
      (NSAID) meloxicam affected neither the pharmacodynamics nor the pharmacokinetics 
      of a titrated warfarin dose. A combination of both drugs should nevertheless be
      avoided and, if necessary, INR monitoring is considered mandatory.

TI  - Individual relationship between progression of radiological damage and the acute 
      phase response in early rheumatoid arthritis. Towards development of a decision
      support system.
PG  - 20-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the individual relationship between C-reactive protein
      (CRP) production or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and progression of
      radiologic damage in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA), to improve the predictive
      value of monitoring the acute phase response. METHODS: The relationship was
      modeled mathematically using adjustments for discontinuity in the radiographic
      scoring system and for clustering in the occurrence of score points in the
      initial phase. The model was evaluated in a prospective study of 149 patients
      with early RA, monthly CRP assays, and 6-monthly Sharp scores of radiographs of
      the hands and feet. RESULTS: Time integrated CRP values correlated closely with
      radiologic progression in each patient, but there was considerable variation
      between individuals with similar radiographic scores. The theoretical model
      accommodated these results, and based on CRP measurements and radiographic scores
      over 6 months, it provided a k value for each patient that reflected the
      individual relationship between CRP and radiologic damage. Using this k value
      combined with actual CRP levels over 3 and 6 years, the model accurately
      predicted the extent of radiologic progression that was actually observed at
      these times. Best results were obtained using estimation of the k value from 6 or
      12 month observational data. The model has been incorporated into a software
      program for routine clinical use that indicates the levels to which CRP should
      fall to prevent further joint damage. Similar results were obtained for ESR.
      CONCLUSION: A model has been established defining the individual relationship
      between time integrated CRP and ESR values, reflecting rheumatoid disease
      activity, and progression of radiologic damage. It accurately prediets outcome
      from 6 months after presentation and can be used as a practical decision support 
      system.

TI  - Gastroduodenal tolerability of highly specific cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitor.
PG  - 30-2
AB  - Inhibition of constitutively expressed cyclo-oxygenase (COX-1) by NSAIDs is
      thought to play an important role is the gastrointestinal toxicity of NSAIDs. To 
      minimise the intestinal toxicity of NSAIDS, highly selective COX-2 (induced at
      inflammatory sites) inhibitors have been developed. One such is flosulide. We
      assessed the gastroduodenal tolerability of flosulide (20 mg twice a day) in man 
      and compared it with that of naproxen (500 mg twice a day) in a randomised,
      double blind crossover fashion in 19 patients with osteoarthrosis. Treatment
      period was 2 weeks with a 2-week washout period with endoscopy before and after
      each treatment. Gastroduodenal damage was assessed as by Lanza (Grades 0-4) and
      by the Gastroscopic Rating Scale (Grades 0-9). Flosulide was significantly better
      tolerated (p < 0.005, analyses of deviance) than naproxen. No stomach damage was 
      seen in 13 (68%) patients following flosulide and 5 (37%) following naproxen (p <
      0.001). Lanza scores following flosulide (0.58) were significantly better than
      that of naproxen (1.47) (p < 0.001). The duodenal damage was mild with both
      treatments. The selective COX-2 inhibitor, flosulide, is significantly better
      tolerated and causes less gastric mucosal damage than naproxen when given for two
      weeks.

PG  - 579-82
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and acceptability of ethamsylate, mefenamic
      acid, and tranexamic acid for treating menorrhagia. DESIGN: Randomised controlled
      trial. SETTING: A university department of obstetrics and gynaecology. SUBJECTS: 
      76 women with dysfunctional uterine bleeding. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment for five
      days from day 1 of menses during three consecutive menstrual periods. 27 patients
      were randomised to take ethamsylate 500 mg six hourly, 23 patients to take
      mefenamic acid 500 mg eight hourly, and 26 patients to take tranexamic acid 1 g
      six hourly. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Menstrual loss measured by the alkaline
      haematin method in three control menstrual periods and three menstrual periods
      during treatment; duration of bleeding; patient's estimation of blood loss;
      sanitary towel usage; the occurrence of dysmenorrhoea; and unwanted events.
      RESULTS: Ethamsylate did not reduce mean menstrual blood loss whereas mefenamic
      acid reduced blood loss by 20% (mean blood loss 186 ml before treatment, 148 ml
      during treatment) and tranexamic acid reduced blood loss by 54% (mean blood loss 
      164 ml before treatment, 75 ml during treatment). Sanitary towel usage was
      significantly reduced in patients treated with mefenamic acid and tranexamic
      acid. CONCLUSIONS: Tranexamic acid given during menstruation is a safe and highly
      effective treatment for excessive bleeding. Patients with dysfunctional uterine
      bleeding should be offered medical treatment with tranexamic acid before a
      decision is made about surgery.

PG  - 376-9
AB  - Convulsions induced by the combination of enoxacin, a new antimicrobial, and
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs including nimesulide, ketoprofen,
      pranoprofen and loxoprofen sodium, were investigated in mice. The oral
      administration of nimesulide alone induced clonic convulsions at more than 300
      mg/kg. The oral administration of ketoprofen, pranoprofen or loxoprofen sodium
      induced no convulsion up to 1000 mg/kg, 500 mg/kg and 600 mg/kg, respectively,
      and that of enoxacin induced no convulsion at more than 5000 mg/kg. The
      combination of nimesulide at 200 mg/kg and enoxacin at 400 mg/kg induced no
      convulsion. In contrast, the combination of enoxacin at 100 mg/kg and either
      ketoprofen at 125 mg/kg or pranoprofen at 500 mg/kg induced clonic convulsions,
      while that of enoxacin at 400 mg/kg and loxoprofen sodium at 600 mg/kg induced no
      convulsion. These results suggest that the combination of nimesulide and enoxacin
      may possibly induce few or less convulsions in the clinical setting.

TI  - Evaluation of the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of meloxicam tablets in
      patients with osteoarthritis.
PG  - 429-39
AB  - This 12-week, open-label, multicenter study assessed the safety, tolerability,
      and efficacy of the tablet formulation of meloxicam 15 mg, a new, nonsteroidal
      antiinflammatory drug (NSAID), in patients with confirmed osteoarthritis (OA) of 
      the hip or knee. Meloxicam differs from established NSAIDs in its preferential
      activity against cyclooxygenase type 2 compared with cyclooxygenase type 1. One
      hundred thirty-nine patients were given meloxicam tablets 15 mg once daily. Data 
      were analyzed using an intent-to-treat analysis. Assessments of global
      tolerability at the end of the study showed meloxicam tablets to be well or very 
      well tolerated by 83% of patients, with only 4% rating the tablets poorly. This
      finding was supported by the low incidence of adverse events. Only 11% of
      patients discontinued therapy due to gastrointestinal adverse events, and no
      serious gastrointestinal adverse events related to meloxicam 15-mg tablets
      occurred during treatment. Efficacy results showed significant improvement from
      baseline, with 41% of patients experiencing mild or no pain by the end of the
      study. In conclusion, the tablet formulation of meloxicam 15 mg is well tolerated
      and effective in patients with moderate-to-severe, clinical confirmed OA of the
      hip or knee.

TI  - Tolerability of multiple administration of intramuscular meloxicam: a comparison 
      with intramuscular piroxicam in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or
      osteoarthritis.
PG  - 51-5
AB  - This multicentre, randomized, open controlled study compared the local and
      overall tolerability of i.m. meloxicam with i.m. piroxicam in 211 patients with
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (n = 95) or osteoarthritis (OA) (n = 116). Of these,
      210 patients were randomized (2:1) to receive meloxicam 15 mg (n = 144) or
      piroxicam 20 mg (n = 66) for 7 days. Local tolerability of meloxicam was
      significantly better than piroxicam with respect to occurrence of redness after
      the first injection (P = 0.03) and global assessment after the first and final
      injections (P < 0.05). No rise in creatinine phosphokinase levels (a marker of
      muscle fibre damage) was observed with meloxicam, in contrast to piroxicam (P =
      0.0001). The overall tolerability of both treatments was good. Significant
      differences in favour of meloxicam were observed for global efficacy assessed by 
      the patient in RA (P < 0.05) and for overall pain intensity in OA patients (P =
      0.02). In conclusion, i.m. meloxicam is safe and effective for the treatment of
      acute rheumatic pain and shows some superiority over piroxicam.

      7.5 mg and meloxicam 15 mg in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
PG  - 17-21
AB  - A multicentre, double-blind, randomized study was conducted in patients with
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in order to compare the efficacy and safety of two
      different doses of meloxicam, a new preferential cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)
      inhibitor. Four hundred and twenty-three patients were randomized to receive
      once-daily oral meloxicam 7.5 mg (n = 216) or meloxicam 15 mg (n = 207) for 3
      weeks. The Ritchie joint index and pain in the morning were significantly
      improved versus baseline (P < 0.001) in both groups. There were no significant
      differences between the effects of each dose with respect to these measures nor
      with respect to final assessment of global efficacy by the patients. However, the
      15 mg dose was associated with a significantly (P < 0.05) better effect on
      morning stiffness and grip strength. No differences between the doses were
      observed with regard to the other secondary efficacy parameter (pain at night,
      body weight and erythrocyte sedimentation rate). Both doses of meloxicam were
      well tolerated. There were no differences between the doses with respect to
      global tolerance as assessed by the patient and the patients, 'general
      condition'. In conclusion, meloxicam at a once-daily dose of either 7.5 or 15 mg 
      is well tolerated and effective in the treatment of patients with RA.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and tolerability of meloxicam after i.m. administration.
PG  - 135-9
AB  - 1. The pharmacokinetics and tolerability of a new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
      drug (NSAID), meloxicam, administered i.m., were investigated in two studies
      conducted in healthy male volunteers. Study 1 was an open, placebo-controlled
      design in which 32 volunteers were randomized to a single ascending i.m. dose of 
      meloxicam (5, 10, 20, and 30 mg) or placebo. Study 2 had an open, randomized two 
      way crossover design in which 12 volunteers received single i.m. and i.v. doses
      of meloxicam (15 mg). 2. Meloxicam showed an excellent tolerability in both
      studies. No effect was seen on serum creatinphosphokinase (CK, the isoenzyme of
      the skeletal muscle enzyme, CK-MM, was determined). 3. Following i.m.
      administration meloxicam was rapidly and completely absorbed (mean absolute
      bioavailability 102%). Dose-proportionality was demonstrated with respect to Cmax
      (maximum plasma concentration) and AUC (extrapolated area under the plasma
      concentration-time curve from zero time to infinity) over a range of 5-30 mg. 4. 
      Intravenous administration of meloxicam (15 mg) resulted in higher initial plasma
      concentrations (C3min, i.e. concentration in plasma 3 min after start of
      injection = 2.99 +/- 0.75 microgram.ml-1) than after i.m. injection (Cmax: 1.62
      +/- 0.20 mg ml-1). All other pharmacokinetic parameters were similar for both
      routes of administration (apparent elimination half-life = 15-22 h; plasma
      clearance = 7-9 ml min-1). 5. In conclusion, the excellent tolerability of i.m.
      meloxicam together with its rapid and complete absorption may provide an
      alternative to oral administration of this drug.

PG  - 79-84
AB  - Meloxicam is a new enol carboxamide nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID).
      Preclinical studies have indicated that it possesses a high antiinflammatory
      potency and a low ulcerogenic potency. This open, randomized, crossover study was
      conducted to examine the effects of aspirin, the antacid Maalox (Rhone-Poulenc
      Rorer, Cologne, Germany), and cimetidine on the pharmacokinetics and
      bioavailability of a single oral dose of meloxicam 30 mg in healthy male
      volunteers. Plasma concentrations of meloxicam were determined and subjected to
      noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis. Meloxicam was well tolerated, and
      concomitant treatment with cimetidine or Maalox had little or no effect on the
      plasma concentration-time curves, maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), or the
      area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-infinity) of meloxicam.
      Concurrent treatment with aspirin increased plasma concentrations of meloxicam,
      increasing Cmax by approximately 25% and AUC0-infinity by 10%. These differences 
      were not considered to be clinically relevant, and no adjustments of meloxicam
      dose should be required with coadministration of aspirin, Maalox, or cimetidine.

TI  - Prostaglandins play a role in memory consolidation in the chick.
PG  - 253-9
AB  - Previous studies showed that inhibitors of cyclooxygenases have amnesic effects
      in chicks in a passive avoidance task. The onset of amnesia has a delay of 2 h
      post-training. To investigate if this effect is due to the inhibition of
      induction of the enzyme during learning, the release of cyclooxygenase products
      into the extracellular fluid was measured at 1, 2 and 3 h post-training. A
      cyclooxygenase inhibitor, ibuprofen, inhibited the training-dependent increase of
      cyclooxygenase products only 2 h and 3 h after learning when injected
      pre-training, as did dexamethasone which prevents cyclooxygenase induction, and
      SC58125 (1,2-diarylcyclopentene), an inhibitor of inducible cyclooxygenase.
      Injections 30 min post-training showed the same effect with the exception of
      dexamethasone. Injecting SC58125, ibuprofen, indomethacin, or dexamethasone i.c. 
      before training showed amnesic effects for training on a one-trial passive
      avoidance task at 2 h but not 1 h after training. Injections 30 min post-training
      produced the same effects with the exception of dexamethasone. I conclude that
      cyclooxygenases are induced during training and that cyclooxygenase products are 
      of importance in memory formation of the chick.

TI  - Studies on the gastric tolerability of the new non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
      drug amtolmetin guacyl.
PG  - 1298-302
AB  - Unexpectedly high levels of gastric tolerance to the new non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) amtolmetin guacyl (CAS 87344-06-7, MED15) were
      observed in clinical practice. Further investigation of the drug was, therefore, 
      undertaken in order to evaluate its gastrointestinal side-effects in animals.
      This new agent, which possesses high anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic
      activity, was recently introduced into medical therapy. In rats, repeated
      administration of MED15, even at high dosages, failed to produce any adverse
      effects on the gastric mucosa, unlike the reference NSAIDs used; the effect on
      the gastric mucosa was evaluated macro- and microscopically with a staining
      technique. In immature rat isolated stomachs MED15 strongly down-regulated the
      HCl output evoked by histamine, acetylcholine and gastrin. An effective NSAID
      which presents the added advantage of antisecretory properties has not previously
      been described amongst the many currently available, and reverses the dogma of
      the inevitable correlation between NSAID assumption and gastrointestinal
      reactions.

TI  - Comparison of the onset and intensity of action of intramuscular meloxicam and
      oral meloxicam in patients with acute sciatica.
PG  - 1078-98
AB  - In this randomized, double-blind, double-dummy trial, 113 patients with acute
      sciatica were treated with a single 15-mg dose of meloxicam given intramuscularly
      (n = 54) or orally (n = 59). There was a significant improvement in induced pain 
      (as measured by using the straight-leg-raising test) in both treatment groups at 
      60 minutes (P < 0.005), and there was a significant difference in favor of the
      intramuscular formulation in terms of the time to maximum improvement of induced 
      pain (P = 0.01). Changes in spontaneous pain were similar in both treatment
      groups and were significant versus baseline (P < 0.01) at 30 minutes after study 
      drug administration. Global efficacy evaluations by both the patients and
      investigators confirmed that meloxicam 15 mg in an intramuscular or oral
      formulation was effective in relieving pain in patients with acute sciatica.
      Meloxicam was generally well tolerated, and the local tolerability of the
      intramuscular injection was found to be excellent on the basis of both clinical
      evaluation and assessment of creatine phosphokinase levels.

TI  - The effect of meloxicam on the pharmacokinetics of beta-acetyl-digoxin.
PG  - 486-8
AB  - The influence of multiple-dose administration of meloxicam on the
      pharmacokinetics of oral beta-acetyl-digoxin was studied in 12 healthy male
      volunteers in a randomized double-blind two-way crossover study. The primary
      endpoint, Cminss, was within the accepted range for bioequivalence, as were
      Cmaxss and AUCss. The 90% confidence interval and the point estimator of 98.7 for
      Cminss were within the equivalence range of 0.8-1.25. MRT and tmax were also
      unchanged, while the elimination rate constant was decreased slightly by 12%,
      which is of no therapeutic relevance. It is concluded that co-treatment with
      meloxicam has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of oral digoxin.

TI  - Anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antipyretic and related properties of meloxicam, a 
      new non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent with favourable gastrointestinal
      tolerance.
PG  - 423-33
AB  - The anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic properties of the new
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, meloxicam, were investigated in a variety 
      of animal models and compared with the properties of piroxicam, diclofenac,
      indomethacin and several other NSAIDs. With respect to the total effect of a
      single oral dose, the anti-exudative effect of meloxicam on carrageenan-induced
      oedema in the rat exceeded that of all the NSAIDs included in the comparison.
      Additionally, meloxicam showed the greatest potency of all the compounds examined
      with respect to adjuvant-induced arthritis in the rat, the granuloma pouch model 
      and the cotton pellet test in the rat. Unlike indomethacin, in the carrageenan
      pleurisy model in the rat, meloxicam caused both a dose-dependent reduction in
      exudate volume and also inhibition of leucocyte migration. Meloxicam showed a
      strong and lasting effect on inflammatory pain in the rat. Like other NSAIDs, but
      unlike dipyrone, meloxicam had no effect in the hot plate and tail clamp tests,
      which are used to identify weak central analgesic effects. Unlike dipyrone and
      like indomethacin, meloxicam had no effect in a model of visceral distention
      pain. In common with other NSAIDs, meloxicam had no influence on the body
      temperature of normothermic rats in the anti-inflammatory dose range, but did
      reduce yeast-induced fever in the rat in a dose-dependent manner. Like piroxicam,
      meloxicam had a uricosuric effect on rats treated with oxonic acid. Low-dose
      meloxicam inhibited both bradykinin-induced and PAF-induced bronchospasm in the
      guinea-pig, but had no effect on acetylcholine-induced bronchospasm. Piroxicam
      had greater ulcerogenic effects in the rat stomach than meloxicam. The
      therapeutic range of meloxicam in the rat, with regard to inhibition of adjuvant 
      arthritis, was several times greater than that of piroxicam, indomethacin,
      diclofenac and naproxen.

TI  - The effect of nimesulide and naproxen on the uterine and ovarian arterial blood
      flow velocity. A Doppler study.
PG  - 549-53
AB  - BACKGROUND: To measure the effect of oral naproxen and nimesulide treatments on
      the uterine and ovarian arterial blood flow velocity in both eumenorrheic and
      dysmenorrheic women. METHODS: The double-blind, placebo-controlled, study
      comprised six eumenorrheic women receiving either placebo or nimesulide (100 mg, 
      single oral dose) during two consecutive cycles. Six women with moderate to
      severe dysmenorrhea were treated with placebo, nimesulide or naproxen (500 mg,
      single oral dose) during three consecutive cycles. Uterine impedance (pulsatile
      index, PI) was measured during the cycle day 1 at four different levels of the
      uterus and in the ovarian branch of the uterine artery at 0, 30, 60, and 120-140 
      min, with a color Doppler ultrasonograph for orientation and with pulsatile
      Doppler for recording waveforms. RESULTS: In the eumenorrheic women no
      significant changes were found with any treatment. In dysmenorrheic patients,
      nimesulide relieved symptoms and caused a decrease in uterine artery PI earlier
      than naproxen. Both treatments reduced the elevated uterine impedance in
      dysmenorrhea close to the normal level. When analyzing the PIs of the uterine
      artery at 4 different levels, the most prominent changes were observed in the
      fundus. The ovarian branch remained unaffected. CONCLUSIONS: Color Doppler
      ultrasonography and pulsatile Doppler are good methods for investigating disease-
      or drug-induced changes in uterine and ovarian blood flow velocities. Nimesulide 
      induced a slightly faster and more complete decrease of the elevated uterine
      vascular resistance in dysmenorrhea, towards normal eumenorrheic levels, than
      naproxen. The fundal part of the uterus appears to be an important site of the
      pathogenesis in primary dysmenorrhea.

TI  - Renal and endocrine effects of flosulide, after single and repeated
      administration to healthy volunteers.
PG  - 193-201
AB  - Two double-blind, placebo-controlled, balanced cross-over studies were carried
      out successively in 8 male normotensive volunteers to investigate the acute and
      chronic effects of two doses of a novel non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug
      flosulide (5 mg b.d. and 25 mg b.d.), on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
      system, linking this to changes in the urinary excretion of prostaglandins.
      Plasma renin and aldosterone were determined on Days 2 and 9, with the subject
      supine, after 1 h of rest in the sitting position following 1 h of walking, and 3
      h after oral intake of 40 mg furosemide, also in the sitting position.
      Twenty-four hour urine samples were collected on Days 1 and 8 for the measurement
      of the electrolytes, aldosterone pH1 and the urinary prostaglandins PGE2, PGF2
      alpha, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and TxB2. RESULTS: After the first day of treatment with
      25 mg b.d. flosulide, the increase in body weight was close to significance (0.86
      vs -0.08 kg with placebo). A dose- and time-dependent decrease in both active and
      inactive plasma renin were observed, whereas the fall in plasma and urinary
      aldosterone was statistically significant only after the higher dose of
      flosulide. These changes in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system were
      observed in the absence of oedema. Two out of eight volunteers experienced a
      strong and immediate reduction in the excretion of prostaglandins but overall the
      two doses tested did not produce a statistically significant inhibition in renal 
      prostaglandins, especially following repeated dosing. The inhibitory effect of
      flosulide on renal prostaglandin synthesis was found to be less pronounced after 
      repeated treatment, as documented on Day 9 by the lower inhibition of 6-keto-PGF1
      alpha and TxB2. CONCLUSION: These two studies in normal volunteers, in spite of
      some methodological limitations, were helpful in order to select doses of
      flosulide which should be effective and safe in patients during Phase II trials, 
      by examining the inhibitory effect of the drug on renin synthesis and renal
      prostaglandin synthesis.

TI  - Gastroduodenal toxicity of different nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs.
PG  - 49-54
AB  - Although the etiologic relation between nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug
      (NSAID) use and gastrointestinal lesions is well documented, newly introduced
      NSAIDs deserve a fresh examination for their risk/benefit ratio. To estimate the 
      association between consumption of ketorolac and the occurrence of gastroduodenal
      lesions, we conducted a case-control study. The study population comprised 600
      outpatients with a confirmed endoscopic diagnosis of ulcer and erosion in 1991
      and 1992 and 6,000 community controls matched by age and sex. We retrieved the
      prescription history through a computerized prescription monitoring system. We
      defined exposure to each study drug as "current" (month of endoscopy and
      preceding month), "recent" (second or third month preceding endoscopy). and
      "past" (fourth to sixth month preceding endoscopy). Current users of NSAIDs
      showed a 30% increase in the incidence of gastroduodenal lesions [odds ratio (OR)
      = 1.3; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.98 - 1.8] after adjustment for recent or 
      past use of any NSAID, recent or past gastrotoxic therapy, recent or past use of 
      gastroprotective drugs, and recent or past use of any other drug. Among NSAIDs,
      ketorolac was the only one showing a distinctly elevated risk of gastroduodenal
      lesions (OR = 4.2; 95% CI = 1.9-9.4). Current use of any NSAID was associated
      with almost a doubling of risk for ulcer alone (OR = 1.9; 95% CI = 1.3-3.0); no
      elevation in risk was found for erosions. The adjusted relative risk for ulcer
      associated with current use of ketorolac was 9.8 (95% CI = 3.4-28.10. Recent and 
      past use of NSAIDs does not increase the risk of ulcer.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

TI  - The effect of cholestyramine on the pharmacokinetics of meloxicam, a new
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), in man.
PG  - 269-72
AB  - The influence of multiple oral doses of cholestyramine on the single dose
      pharmacokinetics of meloxicam has been studied in 12 healthy male volunteers.
      Each subject received on two occasions a single IV injection of meloxicam 30 mg. 
      The cholestyramine group received the material suspended in water 3 times a day. 
      Compared to controls, cholestyramine accelerated the elimination of meloxicam.
      The mean terminal phase elimination half-life was reduced from 19.5 h to 12.7 h
      due to an increase in clearance of the drug (0.426 vs 0.636 l.h-1). Also, as a
      consequence of increased clearance in the presence of cholestyramine, the mean
      residence time of the drug in the body was significantly decreased (39%) P <
      0.01. However, the volume of distribution for meloxicam was largely unaffected by
      cholestyramine which suggests that meloxicam undergoes gut recirculation. These
      changes are of the same magnitude as those previously reported for the
      structurally related piroxicam and are much smaller than those observed for
      tenoxicam.

      healthy volunteers.
PG  - 247-51
AB  - Fifteen healthy male volunteers participated in an open, multiple-dose study to
      investigate a possible interaction between furosemide and meloxicam, a new
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAID). The study comprised three
      treatment periods. First, furosemide (40 mg) was administered as a single oral
      daily dose for 3 days. A wash-out day was followed by the administration of
      meloxicam (15 mg) as a single oral daily dose for 10 days. Thereafter, meloxicam 
      and furosemide were administered concomitantly at the same doses as described
      above, for 3 days. The effect of concomitant ingestion of meloxicam and
      furosemide on furosemide-induced diuresis, urine and serum electrolytes, and
      furosemide pharmacokinetics was determined, after both single and repeated
      administration of furosemide. Estimates of the
      "(furosemide+meloxicam)/(furosemide alone)" mean ratio of the variable
      AUC(0-infinity) for plasma furosemide and the cumulative sodium excretion (0-8 h)
      were 97.4% (90% confidence interval 89.7-106%) and 88% (90% confidence interval
      82-94%), respectively. The study results indicate that meloxicam does not affect 
      the pharmacokinetics of furosemide in healthy volunteers, nor does it affect
      furosemide-induced diuresis or serum electrolytes. The cumulative urinary
      electrolyte excretion after concomitant administration of meloxicam and
      furosemide is somewhat lower than after administration of furosemide alone, in
      particular for the period 0-8 h after administration of furosemide. This effect
      of meloxicam on furosemide dynamics is small, and is probably not clinically
      relevant in healthy volunteers under the dosing regime studied.

TI  - Pharmacological and biochemical demonstration of the role of cyclooxygenase 2 in 
      inflammation and pain.
PG  - 12013-7
AB  - Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used for the treatment of
      inflammatory diseases, but significant side effects such as gastrointestinal
      erosion and renal damage limit their use. NSAIDs inhibit the enzyme
      cyclooxygenase (COX), which catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to
      prostaglandins (PGs) and thromboxane. Two forms of COX have been
      identified--COX-1, which is constitutively expressed in most tissues and organs, 
      and the inducible enzyme, COX-2, which has been localized primarily to
      inflammatory cells and tissues. In an animal model of acute inflammation
      (injection of carrageenan into the footpad), edema was produced that was
      associated with marked accumulation of COX-2 mRNA and thromboxane. A selective
      inhibitor of COX-2 (SC-58125) inhibited edema at the inflammatory site and was
      analgesic but had no effect on PG production in the stomach and did not cause
      gastric toxicity. These data suggest that selective inhibition of COX-2 may
      produce superior antiinflammatory drugs with substantial safety advantages over
      existing NSAIDs.

TI  - Do nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs affect blood pressure? A meta-analysis.
PG  - 289-300
AB  - PURPOSE: A meta-analysis of randomized trials studying the effect of nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on blood pressure. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY
      SELECTION: Eight databases were searched, yielding 38 randomized,
      placebo-controlled trials and 12 randomized but not placebo-controlled trials
      (comparing two or more NSAIDs). DATA EXTRACTION: Pooled mean treatment effects
      were computed in each trial for blood pressure, weight, creatinine clearance,
      plasma renin activity, and daily urinary excretion of sodium and prostaglandins. 
      Meta-analyses of these variables were done for all randomized, controlled trials;
      for all randomized, uncontrolled trials; and for several subgroups. DATA
      SYNTHESIS: When pooled, NSAIDs elevated supine mean blood pressure by 5.0 mm Hg
      (95% CI, 1.2 to 8.7 mm Hg) but had no effect on variables other than blood
      pressure. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs antagonized the antihypertensive
      effect of beta-blockers (blood pressure elevation, 6.2 mm Hg; CI, 1.1 to 11.4 mm 
      Hg) more than did vasodilators and diuretics. Among NSAIDs, piroxicam produced
      the most marked elevation in blood pressure (6.2 mm Hg; CI, 0.8 to 11.5 mm Hg),
      whereas sulindac and aspirin had the least hypertensive effect. CONCLUSIONS:
      Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may elevate blood pressure and antagonize
      the blood pressure-lowering effect of antihypertensive medication to an extent
      that may potentially increase hypertension-related morbidity. Although certain
      NSAIDs and antihypertensive agents could be more likely to produce these effects,
      the underlying mechanisms require further study.

TI  - A study of manufacturer-supported trials of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
      in the treatment of arthritis.
PG  - 157-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: To study the relation between reported drug performance in published 
      trials and support of the trials by the manufacturer of the drug under
      evaluation, we studied a sample of trials of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
      (NSAIDs) used in the treatment of arthritis. METHODS: All randomized control
      trials of NSAIDs published between September 1987 and May 1990 identified by
      MEDLINE were reviewed. If an article met the following criteria (n = 61), it was 
      selected: trials involving adult patients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid
      arthritis (n = 180), use of nonsalicylate NSAIDs marketed in the United States (n
      = 101), randomized control trial (n = 81), duration of the trial 4 or more days
      (n = 78), and use of an efficacy outcome measure (n = 61). Reviewers, "blinded"
      to manufacturer status, evaluated the narrative interpretation of results and
      extracted numeric data on efficacy and toxicity. Manufacturer-associated trials
      were defined as those that acknowledged an association with a pharmaceutical
      manufacturer. Because of the scarcity of non-manufacturer-associated trials (n = 
      9), we report only on the manufacturer-associated articles. RESULTS: Fifty-two
      publications (85.2%) representing 56 trials were associated with a manufacturer. 
      The manufacturer-associated drug was reported as comparable with (71.4%) or
      superior to (28.6%) the comparison drug in all 56 trials. These narrative claims 
      of superiority were usually justified with trial data. Of the trials identifying 
      one drug as less toxic (n = 22), the manufacturer-associated drug's safety was
      reported as superior to the comparison drug in 86.4% of cases. Justification for 
      the narrative interpretation of the trial findings regarding less toxicity was
      provided in only 12 (54.5%) of 22 trials. CONCLUSION: The manufacturer-associated
      NSAID is almost always reported as being equal or superior in efficacy and
      toxicity to the comparison drug. These claims of superiority, especially in
      regard to side effect profiles, are often not supported by trial data. These data
      raise concerns about selective publication or biased interpretation of results in
      manufacturer-associated trials.

TI  - NS-398, a new anti-inflammatory agent, selectively inhibits prostaglandin G/H
      synthase/cyclooxygenase (COX-2) activity in vitro.
PG  - 55-9
AB  - NS-398 is a novel anti-inflammatory and analgesic agent which produces much fewer
      gastrointestinal lesions in rats. Recently, two forms of cyclooxygenase have been
      identified: a COX-1 first purified from ram seminal vesicles and a newly
      discovered mitogen-inducible form (COX-2). Effects of NS-398 on activities of
      these two distinct forms of COX were investigated. COX-1 purified from ram
      seminal vesicles and COX-2 isolated from sheep placenta (purity was 70%) were
      used. The COX-1 activity was completely unaffected by 10(-4) M NS-398, whereas
      the COX-2 activity was concentration-dependently inhibited, the IC50 value being 
      3.8 x 10(-6) M. Indomethacin inhibited both COX-1 and COX-2 activity to the same 
      degree, the IC50 values being 7.4 x 10(-7) M and 9.7 x 10(-7) M, respectively.
      The anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of NS-398 were almost as potent as
      indomethacin, the effective dose range being 0.3 approximately 5 mg/kg in rats.
      The gastrointestinal lesions related to NS-398 were not significant following a
      dose of 1000 mg/kg given orally. NS-398 is the first documented agent to have
      selective inhibition for COX-2, which may result in the less gastrointestinal
      toxicity.

      nimesulide and digoxin in patients with heart failure.
PG  - 91-4
AB  - The potential interaction between nimesulide, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
      drug, and digoxin was studied in 9 patients [6 males, 3 females; mean age 67
      (range 57 to 70) years] with mild heart failure. All patients were receiving
      maintenance therapy with digoxin (0.25 mg/day, orally) and were treated with oral
      nimesulide 100mg twice daily for 7 days. Blood samples were collected at 8am and 
      6pm for 4 days before and throughout the nimesulide treatment period for
      determination of serum digoxin concentrations. Physical health,
      electrocardiographic recordings and blood and urine samples were also monitored. 
      Mean serum digoxin concentrations remained within the normal therapeutic range
      throughout the study despite large interindividual variation. Furthermore, there 
      were no significant differences between the morning and afternoon serum digoxin
      concentrations and there was no major change in the clinical condition of any
      patient. These results indicate that short term administration (7 days) of
      conventional therapeutic doses of nimesulide (100mg twice daily) does not modify 
      the serum digoxin profile in patients with low class heart failure treated with a
      maintenance dose (0.25 mg/day) of this cardiac glycoside.

PG  - 277-80
AB  - This review describes the tolerability profile of nimesulide as documented in a
      global assessment of the clinical data available to Helsinn for this drug. Data
      from 151 trials were considered and the relevant case report forms and study
      reports were used as source information. The analysis was conducted using
      between-treatment and within-treatment comparisons. The between-treatment
      comparison included data derived from placebo-controlled trials, while the
      within-treatment comparison included nimesulide data only. Of 4945 subjects
      treated with nimesulide, 349 (7.1%) experienced adverse events and 52 (1.1%)
      withdrew from treatment. The most frequently reported adverse events were those
      related to the digestive system, body as a whole, skin and nervous system. The
      incidence and nature of adverse events observed for nimesulide-treated patients
      were similar to those of the placebo group. Nimesulide was particularly well
      tolerated by the liver, lungs, kidneys and blood.

AB  - In clinical settings where effective plasma volume is decreased, nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may induce acute renal failure. We have
      evaluated the effects of single and repeated doses of nimesulide on renal
      haemodynamics and electrolyte excretion in 8 healthy volunteers during a
      prolonged course of furosemide (frusemide). Under these study conditions, renal
      prostaglandin synthesis is expected to be elevated, with renal function being
      dependent upon increased levels of prostaglandins. Nimesulide induced an acute
      but transient decrease in indices of renal haemodynamics. Furosemide-induced
      increases in plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels were blunted, and
      urinary excretion of prostaglandin E2 was markedly reduced by nimesulide. The
      magnitude and time course of the natriuretic, kaliuretic and diuretic effects of 
      furosemide were attenuated by nimesulide. Although the transient nature of the
      observed renal haemodynamic changes suggests that the risk of developing acute
      renal failure is small, the rise should be taken into account in patients with
      renal dysfunction. Sodium and potassium retention, and the blunting of the
      diuretic-induced electrolyte excretion, could be of clinical relevance.
      Nimesulide appears, therefore, to share the prostaglandin-dependent renal effects
      of other NSAIDs.

      of paracetamol in the treatment of 35 children with pain and inflammation
      following adenotonsillectomy. The antipyretic and analgesic efficacy of the 2
      drugs was similar, although more patients had complete remission of pain after 4 
      days of treatment with nimesulide. Both drugs were well tolerated, even though
      occasional elevation of transaminase enzymes and alkaline phosphatase was noted
      in the nimesulide-treated group. It is postulated that this effect may have been 
      attributable to the volatile anaesthetics used during surgery.

PG  - 215-8
AB  - The pharmacokinetic profile and efficacy of nimesulide were assessed in 2
      separate studies that recruited children with hypoglycaemia or upper respiratory 
      tract infection and fever, respectively. A single dose of nimesulide 50mg
      (granules) administered orally to 14 hypoglycaemic children was rapidly absorbed.
      A mean maximum nimesulide plasma concentration of 3.5 mg/L was achieved within 2 
      hours of administration, which subsequently declined over the following 12 hours.
      Nimesulide was metabolised to its principal hydroxy metabolite, which was
      detectable in samples obtained 0.5 hours after giving the parent drug. Levels of 
      this metabolite steadily increased, surpassing those of intact nimesulide at the 
      9-hour sampling point. In a randomised nonblind clinical investigation, 100
      hospitalised children with acute upper respiratory infections and fever received 
      nimesulide oral suspension (5 mg/kg/day) or paracetamol (26 mg/kg/day) for 3 to 9
      days. The antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects of nimesulide were superior
      to those observed with paracetamol (p < 0.01) and both drugs were equally well
      tolerated.

AB  - The efficacy and safety of nimesulide suspension were evaluated in comparison
      with mefenamic acid in a double-blind multicentre study that recruited 100
      children with acute respiratory tract infections. On entry, each child was
      randomly allocated to receive either nimesulide 5 mg/kg/day or mefenamic acid 5
      mg/kg divided into 2 or 3 daily doses as an oral suspension, for a period of 3 to
      10 days. Body temperature returned to normal on the third day for most of the
      nimesulide-treated patients, but only on the fifth day for the mefenamic acid
      group. There was a significant difference (p < 0.01) between the antipyretic
      activity of nimesulide and that of mefenamic acid. Furthermore, treatment with
      nimesulide was associated with clinically significant improvement in all
      inflammatory signs and symptoms observed (rhinorrhoea, nasal obstruction,
      pharyngeal redness, swelling of lymph nodes and cough). Adverse effects
      considered possibly related to treatment were recorded for 3 patients treated
      with nimesulide and 1 with mefenamic acid.

PG  - 174-6
AB  - In a randomised double-blind clinical study, 76 patients undergoing major ear,
      nose or throat (ENT) surgery (including 45 for cancer) were treated with
      nimesulide (200mg twice daily) or ketoprofen (100mg twice daily) administered
      rectally for 5 days. Pain intensity was significantly and similarly reduced in
      both treatment groups compared with baseline (p = 0.0001). A significant
      reduction in oedema and hyperaemia was observed on the second day for
      nimesulide-treated patients and on the third day for those treated with
      ketoprofen, with complete relief being noted for almost all patients by the fifth
      day. Fever was resolved in all patients. Adverse events attributable to treatment
      were observed for 1 patient in each group. These results suggest that nimesulide 
      provides a worthwhile alternative to other NSAIDs in the treatment of
      postoperative pain and inflammation associated with ENT surgery.

      patients were randomly assigned to treatment with nimesulide (100mg twice daily) 
      or naproxen (250mg twice daily) for 6 to 14 days. Treatment with either drug
      prevented the development of, or ameliorated the signs and symptoms associated
      with, the inflammatory process (spontaneous pain, difficulty in chewing and
      swallowing, swelling, hyperaemia, muscle contracture, poor sleep quality).
      Indeed, most patients experienced complete resolution of their signs and
      symptoms. The efficacy of nimesulide was considered to be superior to that of
      naproxen, although both drugs were tolerated equally well.

      nimesulide and to compare the acute analgesic activity of this agent with that of
      placebo and niflumic acid. Patients undergoing extraction of an impacted third
      molar were randomised into 4 groups (nimesulide 100mg; nimesulide 200mg; niflumic
      acid 250mg and placebo). They were instructed to take their allocated treatment
      after the onset of pain, and to record the pain severity and relief during the
      following 6 hours. 134 patients were evaluated. There were significant
      differences between groups for each time of observation/efficacy parameter
      (Kruskal-Wallis test). Pairwise comparison (Duncan's test) showed that all 3
      active medications were significantly different from the placebo. No substantial 
      differences were found between any of the active treatments. Analogous results
      were obtained when the amount of rescue drug used (paracetamol) was compared.
      More positive judgements were reported by patients treated with an active
      compound than by those taking placebo.

      of inflammatory signs was observed with transrectal ultrasound in 16 patients.
      Abnormal sperm forms decreased from 57 to 49% (p < 0.001). In a comparative
      investigation, 40 patients received nimesulide 200mg twice daily or ketoprofen
      100mg twice daily via the rectal route. Patients and physicians expressed an
      overall opinion on efficacy in favour of nimesulide. In a pharmacokinetic study
      of healthy volunteers who received oral nimesulide 100mg as a single dose, the
      mean maximum nimesulide concentration (0.58 +/- 0.13 mg/L) in seminal fluid was
      achieved after 2 hours while the maximum seminal fluid: blood plasma ratio 0.32
      +/- 0.02 was observed after 4 hours. These data suggest that nimesulide is an
      effective NSAID in the treatment of abacterial prostato-vesiculitis and also
      demonstrate that this drug has a favourable disposition within the genital tract.

AB  - Two double-blind, randomised studies were conducted to compare the efficacy and
      tolerability of nimesulide (200 mg/day) with those of placebo or bromeline (240
      mg/day). Treatments were administered orally to patients of either sex (aged 19
      to 70 years) with acute infection and inflammation of the urogenital tract, and
      were given concomitantly with antimicrobial therapy for approximately 9 days. In 
      both studies, a clinically significant improvement in symptoms, leading to
      complete remission, was achieved in most patients treated with nimesulide.
      Furthermore, treatment with nimesulide resulted in a more rapid improvement in
      symptoms and complete remission in a greater number of patients than did
      treatment with bromeline. Both nimesulide and bromeline were well tolerated.

PG  - 124-6
AB  - The efficacy and safety of rectally administered nimesulide 200mg and paracetamol
      500mg were assessed in a double-blind study. The study was conducted in 39
      elderly inpatients with infections of the upper or lower respiratory tract
      associated with fever; 18 patients received nimesulide and 21 received
      paracetamol. Both treatments were given for 2 consecutive days and provided
      adequate therapy for pyrexia, with significant reductions in body temperature
      being observed. Both drugs were well tolerated. Only 1 patient in the
      nimesulide-treated group could not complete the study because cutaneous erythema 
      occurred with itching; this resolved spontaneously upon treatment withdrawal. It 
      is concluded that nimesulide is as active and safe as paracetamol for the
      treatment of pyrexia in the elderly.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of nimesulide in asthmatic patients intolerant to
      aspirin.
PG  - 115-20
AB  - Inflammation of the airways accompanied by eosinophil infiltration appears to
      play a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma. Therefore,
      anti-inflammatory agents (at present corticosteroids, cromoglycate and
      nedocromil) are the first-line treatment for this condition. Nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) and
      indomethacin, however, have never been used in this setting, mainly for fear of
      adverse effects (e.g. severe obstructive reactions); these can occur, in a
      consistent number of patients as a consequence (according to the most widely
      accepted theory) of inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. In a double-blind
      crossover placebo-controlled study involving 20 aspirin-sensitive patients with
      asthma, we found that oral nimesulide 100mg was well tolerated both clinically
      and functionally (no significant changes in forced expiratory volume in 1 second 
      and specific airway resistance after drug intake). In a more recent study, we
      observed a mild obstructive reaction (easily controlled with inhaled
      bronchodilators) after oral administration of nimesulide 400mg to 3 patients who 
      had previously tolerated a 100mg dose. On the basis of clinical experience,
      nimesulide (unlike most other NSAIDs) in the recommended doses appears to be well
      tolerated in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients. Furthermore, this distinctive 
      anti-inflammatory agent might provide a novel approach to the treatment of
      bronchial asthma.

PG  - 107-10
AB  - Nimesulide treatment for 7 to 10 days is shown to be effective in controlling the
      inflammatory process in upper airways disorders such as rhinitis, rhinosinusitis,
      rhinopharyngitis and tubaritis, and in middle ear disorder (secretory otitis
      media). A concomitant antibacterial is considered necessary in cases involving
      infection, in order to retain the improvements in mucociliary transport obtained 
      with anti-inflammatory treatment. Nimesulide is also shown to be effective when
      given in combination with the mucolytic drug ambroxol.

PG  - 100-2
AB  - 200 divers of either sex, aged 18 to 54 years, entered a double-blind study to
      compare the efficacy and tolerability of nimesulide 200 mg/day with those of
      seaprose S 60 mg/day in the treatment of nonbacterial inflammatory disorders of
      the ear, nose, and throat. At the end of the 1-week treatment period, both drugs 
      were judged to be effective, with improvements and, in most cases, complete
      remission of all symptoms observed. Nimesulide showed greater clinical efficacy, 
      and both drugs were well tolerated.
