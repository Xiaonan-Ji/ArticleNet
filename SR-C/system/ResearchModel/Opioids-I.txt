TI  - Long term effects of oral sustained release morphine on neuropsychological
      performance in patients with chronic non-cancer pain.
PG  - 389-400
AB  - Morphine is increasingly used in patients with chronic non-cancer pain, but a
      major concern associated with chronic use relates to possible cognitive
      side-effects. The aim of this long-term prospective study was to evaluate the
      cognitive impact of oral sustained release morphine in patients with non-cancer
      pain. A battery of neuropsychological tests to explore attention, psychomotor
      speed and memory was administered. The effects of morphine on pain, quality of
      life, mood, subjective memory impairment and side-effects were also investigated.
      Evaluations were performed at baseline in patients free from opioids and then
      after 3, 6 and 12 months. Twenty-eight patients were included: 18 received oral
      sustained morphine (range 40-140 mg/day), ten patients stopped morphine
      prematurely because of side-effects or insufficient pain relief and were followed
      as a control group. There was no impairment of any neuropsychological variable
      over time in the morphine treated patients in comparison with the control group. 
      Two measures of information processing speed - the Stroop interference score and 
      the digit symbol test were improved at 6 and 12 months and there were significant
      correlations with the pain relief and improvement of mood. Self-reported memory
      impairment improved notably in responders to morphine. Morphine induced
      persisting effects on pain, and to a lesser extent on quality of life and mood.
      The visual analog scale score for side-effects increased at 12 months and
      essentially consisted of gastrointestinal disorders. This study demonstrates that
      12 months treatment with oral morphine does not disrupt cognitive functioning in 
      patients with chronic non-cancer pain and instead results in moderate improvement
      of some aspects of cognitive functioning, as a consequence of the pain relief and
      concomitant improvement of well-being and mood.

TI  - Methadone-related deaths in Hennepin County, Minnesota: 1992-2002.
PG  - 668-71
AB  - Methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) is the only currently established medical
      therapy for heroin addiction. However, MMT still remains controversial. In
      Hennepin County, Minnesota, methadone is one of the top ten drugs reported in
      medical examiner investigated deaths and one of the most commonly diverted
      pharmaceuticals. This report reviews the role of methadone in medical examiner
      deaths over a 10-year period, 1992-2002. We compare cause and manner of death
      (accidental, natural, suicide) and methadone blood concentrations for decedents
      who were members of MMT programs with illicit users and those prescribed
      methadone for chronic pain. Findings reveal that 65% of decedents with measurable
      blood methadone concentrations were not participating in MMT programs. A total of
      96 cases were identified, with the majority white (90.5%) and male (76.8%). MMTP 
      program members were the minority (34.7%) of the methadone positive deaths and
      39% were illicit users. Fifteen percent were chronic pain patients with almost
      half of this group dying from overdose. Methadone concentrations of drug
      caused/related deaths (0.18-3.99 mg/L) overlapped with those of deaths not
      attributable to methadone (0.18-3.03 mg/L) with no definable lethal level.
      Interpretation of methadone blood concentrations must be done in the context of
      the clinical history for determining cause of death, and may be confounded by
      postmortem redistribution.

TI  - Transdermal fentanyl for the treatment of back pain caused by vertebral
      osteoporosis.
PG  - 199-203
AB  - Pain relief for patients with osteoporosis is important to maintain mobility and 
      facilitate physical therapy. Transdermal fentanyl may be useful but has not been 
      studied systematically. Patients with at least one osteoporotic vertebral
      fracture requiring strong opioids were enrolled and received transdermal
      fentanyl. Treatment history, pain, ease of physical therapy, and quality of life 
      were recorded at baseline and after 4 weeks. Of 64 patients enrolled, 49
      completed the study; 12 withdrew because of adverse events, most commonly nausea,
      vomiting, or dizziness. Pain at rest and on movement decreased significantly from
      baseline to final assessment (mean scores 7.84 and 8.55, respectively, at
      baseline, falling to 3.56 and 4.50 after 4 weeks). Quality of life improved
      significantly, and 61% of patients were satisfied with the treatment. Ability to 
      undergo physical therapy improved significantly. Transdermal fentanyl is useful
      for the treatment of severe back pain caused by osteoporosis.

TI  - Randomised crossover trial of transdermal fentanyl and sustained release oral
      morphine for treating chronic non-cancer pain.
PG  - 1154-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare patients' preference for transdermal fentanyl or sustained
      release oral morphine, their level of pain control, and their quality of life
      after treatment. DESIGN: Randomised, multicentre, international, open label,
      crossover trial. SETTING: 35 centres in Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, the
      United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and South Africa. PARTICIPANTS: 256 patients
      (aged 26-82 years) with chronic non-cancer pain who had been treated with
      opioids. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients' preference for transdermal fentanyl or 
      sustained release oral morphine, pain control, quality of life, and safety
      assessments. Results: Of 212 patients, 138 (65%) preferred transdermal fentanyl, 
      whereas 59 (28%) preferred sustained release oral morphine and 15 (7%) expressed 
      no preference. Better pain relief was the main reason for preference for fentanyl
      given by 35% of patients. More patients considered pain control as being "good"
      or "very good" with fentanyl than with morphine (35% v 23%, P=0.002). These
      results were reflected in both patients' and investigators' opinions on the
      global efficacy of transdermal fentanyl. Patients receiving fentanyl had on
      average higher quality of life scores than those receiving morphine. The
      incidence of adverse events was similar in both treatment groups; however, more
      patients experienced constipation with morphine than with fentanyl (48% v 29%,
      P<0.001). Overall, 41% of patients experienced mild or moderate cutaneous
      problems associated with wearing the transdermal fentanyl patch, and more
      patients withdrew because of adverse events during treatment with fentanyl than
      with morphine (10% v 5%). However, within the subgroup of patients naive to both 
      fentanyl and morphine, similar numbers of patients withdrew owing to adverse
      effects (11% v 10%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Transdermal fentanyl was preferred
      to sustained release oral morphine by patients with chronic non-cancer pain
      previously treated with opioids. The main reason for preference was better pain
      relief, achieved with less constipation and an enhanced quality of life.

TI  - Strategies to manage the adverse effects of oral morphine: an evidence-based
      report.
PG  - 2542-54
AB  - Successful pain management with opioids requires that adequate analgesia be
      achieved without excessive adverse effects. By these criteria, a substantial
      minority of patients treated with oral morphine (10% to 30%) do not have a
      successful outcome because of (1) excessive adverse effects, (2) inadequate
      analgesia, or (3) a combination of both excessive adverse effects along with
      inadequate analgesia. The management of excessive adverse effects remains a major
      clinical challenge. Multiple approaches have been described to address this
      problem. The clinical challenge of selecting the best option is enhanced by the
      lack of definitive, evidence-based comparative data. Indeed, this aspect of
      opioid therapeutics has become a focus of substantial controversy. This study
      presents evidence-based recommendations for clinical-practice formulated by an
      Expert Working Group of the European Association of Palliative Care (EAPC)
      Research NETWORK: These recommendations highlight the need for careful evaluation
      to distinguish between morphine adverse effects from comorbidity, dehydration, or
      drug interactions, and initial consideration of dose reduction (possibly by the
      addition of a co analgesic). If side effects persist, the clinician should
      consider options of symptomatic management of the adverse effect, opioid
      rotation, or switching route of systemic administration. The approaches are
      described and guidelines are provided to aid in selecting between therapeutic
      options.

TI  - The effect of opioids on phantom limb pain and cortical reorganization.
PG  - 47-55
AB  - The efficacy of oral retarded morphine sulphate (MST) was tested against placebo 
      in a double-blind crossover design in 12 patients with phantom limb pain after
      unilateral leg or arm amputation. Two counterbalanced treatment phases of 4 weeks
      each were initiated with an intravenous test infusion of MST or Placebo. The
      titration phase was 2 weeks. The dose of MST was titrated to at least 70 mg/day
      and at highest 300 mg/day. Pain intensity was assessed hourly on visual analog
      scales during a 4-week treatment-free phase, both treatment phases and at two
      follow-ups (6 and 12 months). Reorganization of somatosensory cortex, electric
      perception and pain thresholds as well as selective attention were measured pre- 
      and post-treatment. A significant pain reduction was found during MST but not
      during placebo. A clinically relevant response to MST (pain reduction of more
      than 50%) was evident in 42%, a partial response (pain reduction of 25-50%) in 8%
      of the patients. Neuromagnetic source imaging of three patients showed initial
      evidence for reduced cortical reorganization under MST concurrent with the
      reduction in pain intensity. Perception and pain thresholds were not
      significantly altered whereas attention was significantly lower under MST. Thus, 
      opioids show efficacy in the treatment of phantom limb pain and may potentially
      influence also cortical reorganization. These data need to be replicated in
      larger patient samples.

TI  - Double blind randomized placebo control trial of controlled release codeine in
      the treatment of osteoarthritis of the hip or knee.
PG  - 764-71
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pain is the cardinal feature of osteoarthritis (OA), and with
      advancing disease there is loss of function and increasing pain even at times of 
      joint rest. Few studies have evaluated the role of opioid analgesics in treating 
      the pain of OA. METHODS: This randomized, double blind, parallel group study
      compared the efficacy and safety of a 12 hourly controlled release codeine
      formulation (Codeine Contin) with placebo in patients with chronic pain due to OA
      of the hips and/or knees. The 4 week treatment period, following an analgesic
      washout phase of 2-7 days, included weekly clinic evaluations, at which the dose 
      was escalated as appropriate, and daily patient diary completion. Pain (daily),
      stiffness, and physical function (weekly) were assessed using the
      multidimensional, self-administered WOMAC (visual analog scale version)
      questionnaire. RESULTS: Sixty-six eligible patients completed the study. The mean
      initial and final daily doses of controlled release codeine were 50 mg every 12 h
      at baseline and 159 mg every 12 h at the final assessment. All variables in the
      efficacy analysis indicated superiority of controlled release codeine over
      placebo. The WOMAC pain scale showed an improvement of 44.8% over baseline in the
      controlled release codeine group compared with 12.3% taking placebo (p = 0.0004).
      For the WOMAC stiffness and physical function scales the improvements over
      baseline on controlled release codeine were 47.7% and 49.3%, respectively
      compared with 17.0% and 17.0%, respectively, with placebo (p = 0.003; p =
      0.0007). Controlled release codeine was also significantly better than placebo on
      measures of sleep quality and requirement for supplemental acetaminophen.
      CONCLUSION: Single entity controlled release codeine is an effective treatment
      for pain due to OA of the hip or knee.

TI  - Around-the-clock, controlled-release oxycodone therapy for osteoarthritis-related
      pain: placebo-controlled trial and long-term evaluation.
PG  - 853-60
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although opioid analgesics have well-defined efficacy and safety in
      treatment of chronic cancer pain, further research is needed to define their role
      in treatment of chronic noncancer pain. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of
      controlled-release oxycodone (OxyContin tablets) treatment on pain and function
      and its safety vs placebo and in long-term use in patients with moderate to
      severe osteoarthritis pain. METHODS: One hundred thirty-three patients
      experiencing persistent osteoarthritis-related pain for at least 1 month were
      randomized to double-blind treatment with placebo (n = 45) or 10 mg (n = 44) or
      20 mg (n = 44) of controlled-release oxycodone every 12 hours for 14 days. One
      hundred six patients enrolled in an open-label, 6-month extension trial;
      treatment for an additional 12 months was optional. RESULTS: Use of
      controlled-release oxycodone, 20 mg, was superior (P<.05) to placebo in reducing 
      pain intensity and the interference of pain with mood, sleep, and enjoyment of
      life. During long-term treatment, the mean dose remained stable at approximately 
      40 mg/d after titration, and pain intensity was stable. Fifty-eight patients
      completed 6 months of treatment, 41 completed 12 months, and 15 completed 18
      months. Common opioid side effects were reported, several of which decreased in
      duration as therapy continued. CONCLUSIONS: Around-the-clock controlled-release
      oxycodone therapy seemed to be effective and safe for patients with chronic,
      moderate to severe, osteo-arthritis-related pain. Effective analgesia was
      accompanied by a reduction in the interference of pain with mood, sleep, and
      enjoyment of life. Analgesia was maintained during long-term treatment, and the
      daily dose remained stable after titration. Typical opioid side effects were
      reported during short- and long-term therapy.

TI  - Assessment of analgesia in human chronic pain. Randomized double-blind crossover 
      study of once daily repro-dose morphine versus MST continus.
PG  - 577-81
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated Repro-Dose morphine (RDM; Reliadol from Nycomed
      Pharma), a new once daily controlled-release morphine formulation, against twice 
      daily MST Continuous (MST) at steady state in patients with chronic opioid
      responsive pain. METHODS: A randomized double-blind two-way crossover design was 
      used to evaluate the efficacy and adverse effects of RDM once daily or MST twice 
      daily, at the same total daily doses, in patients with chronic stable pain (dose 
      range 20-120 mg per day). During the RDM limb of the study active drug was
      administered in the evening and placebo in the morning. Dextromoramide was
      provided as escape analgesia throughout the study. Following a 5-day screening
      period, during which stability of oral opioid dose was verified, patients
      underwent two 5-day treatment periods, (one MST, one RDM) in random sequence.
      Pain scores, escape analgesia requirements and side-effects were compared using
      data from days 3, 4 and 5 of each treatment period. Any events or medication
      changes occurring during the study period thought liable to influence analgesia
      were regarded as protocol violations. Overall assessment and period preference
      was assessed by direct questioning. RDM treatment was regarded as successful if
      the amount of escape medication required during the RDM period was equal to or
      less than that required during the MST period. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were
      included in the study, of whom 40 completed both periods [the intention to treat 
      (ITT) population], 31 in strict accordance with the protocol [the per protocol
      (PP) population]. Results were similar for both populations. There was no
      significant difference in pain scores or incidence of adverse events occurring
      during the MST and RDM periods. For the ITT population, requirements for escape
      medication during the RDM period were less than, equal to or greater than those
      recorded during the MST period for 14, 15, and 11 patients, respectively.
      Twenty-nine of 40 patients (72.5%) were therefore RDM treatment successes (95%
      confidence interval 56.1-85.4%). The percentage of patients preferring RDM (45%) 
      combined with those with no preference (32.5%) was significantly higher than
      those preferring MST (22.5%; P = 0. 0003). CONCLUSIONS: Oral morphine
      administered as RDM once daily is at least as effective and well tolerated as MST
      twice daily, with over 70% of patients in this double-blind crossover study
      reporting that RDM was equal or superior to MST.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of controlled-release versus immediate-release oxycodone:
      randomized, double-blind evaluation in patients with chronic back pain.
PG  - 179-83
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of controlled-release oxycodone
      given every 12 hours with immediate-release oxycodone given four times daily in
      patients with persistent back pain. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind,
      active-controlled, two-period crossover trial. PATIENTS: Fifty-seven adult
      outpatients with stable, chronic, moderate-to-severe low back pain despite
      analgesic therapy were enrolled; 47 were randomized; 11 discontinued for side
      effects, most commonly nausea and vomiting. INTERVENTIONS: Controlled-release
      oxycodone tablets given every 12 hours; immediate-release oxycodone tablets given
      four times daily; dose titration with controlled-release or immediate-release for
      up to 10 days; double-blind treatment for 4-7 days each. OUTCOME MEASURES:
      Patients' pain scores (0 = none, 1 = slight, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). RESULTS: 
      Pain intensity decreased from moderate to severe at baseline to slight at the end
      of titration with both oxycodone formulations. The daily oxycodone dose was 40 mg
      or less in 68% of patients. During double-blind treatment, mean pain intensity
      was maintained at 1.2 (0.1 SE) with controlled-release and at 1.1 (0.1 SE) with
      immediate-release oxycodone. The most common adverse events were constipation,
      nausea, pruritus, somnolence, and dizziness. CONCLUSIONS: Controlled-release
      oxycodone given every 12 hours was comparable with immediate-release oxycodone
      given four times daily in efficacy and safety, and it provides convenient,
      twice-daily, around-the-clock treatment for selected patients with persistent
      back pain that is inadequately controlled by nonopioids or as-needed opioid
      therapy.

TI  - Treatment of osteoarthritis pain with controlled release oxycodone or fixed
      combination oxycodone plus acetaminophen added to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory
      drugs: a double blind, randomized, multicenter, placebo controlled trial.
PG  - 862-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of controlled release oxycodone
      given every 12 h around the clock with immediate release oxycodone-acetaminophen 
      (APAP) given 4 times daily for osteoarthritis (OA) pain. METHODS: Adults (n=167) 
      with moderate to severe OA pain despite regular use of nonsteroidal
      antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) entered open label titration for 30 days with
      immediate release oxycodone qid; 107 qualified for randomization to double blind,
      parallel group treatment for 30 days with placebo, controlled release oxycodone, 
      or immediate release oxycodone-APAP. RESULTS: Following titration with immediate 
      release oxycodone, mean (SE) pain intensity (0, none to 3, severe) decreased from
      2.44 (0.04) to 1.38 (0.05) (p=0.0001), and quality of sleep (1, very poor; 5,
      excellent) improved from 2.58 (0.08) to 3.57 (0.07) (p=0.0001). Mean dose was
      about 40 mg/day. Pain intensity and quality of sleep were significantly improved 
      in both active groups compared with the placebo group (p< or =0.05) during the
      double blind trial. Pain intensity and sleep scores were comparable in both
      active groups during double blind treatment. Nausea (p=0.03) and dry mouth
      (p=0.09) were less common with controlled release oxycodone than immediate
      release oxycodone-APAP. CONCLUSION: Controlled release oxycodone q12h and
      immediate release oxycodone-APAP qid, added to NSAID, were superior to placebo
      for reducing OA pain and improving quality of sleep. The active treatments
      provided comparable pain control and sleep quality. Controlled release oxycodone 
      was associated with a lower incidence of some side effects.

PG  - 2591-600
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A randomized, open, long-term, repeated-dose comparison of an
      anti-inflammatory drug and two opioid regimens in 36 patients with back pain.
      OBJECTIVES: To examine the long-term safety and efficacy of chronic opioid
      therapy in a randomized trial of patients with back pain. METHODS: All
      participants underwent a 4-week washout period of no opioid medication before
      being randomly assigned to one of three treatment regimens for 16 weeks: 1)
      naproxen only, 2) set-dose oxycodone, or 3) titrated-dose oxycodone and
      sustained-release morphine sulfate. All patients then were assigned to a titrated
      dose of opioids for 16 weeks and then gradually tapered off their medication for 
      12 weeks. Finally, all participants were monitored for a 1-month posttreatment
      washout period. Each patient was called once a week for a report on pain,
      activity, mood, medication, hours awake, and adverse effects and was monitored
      carefully for signs of abuse and noncompliance. RESULTS: Weekly reports during
      the experimental phase showed the titrated-dose group to have less pain (P <
      0.001) and less emotional distress (P < 0.001) than the other two groups. Both
      opioid groups were significantly different from the naproxen-only group. During
      the titration phase, patients also reported significantly less pain and improved 
      mood. Few differences were found in activity or hours asleep, or between average 
      pretreatment and posttreatment phone-interview and questionnaire variables. No
      adverse events occurred, and only one participant showed signs of abuse behavior.
      CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that opioid therapy has a positive effect on
      pain and mood but little effect on activity and sleep. Opioid therapy for chronic
      back pain was used without significant risk of abuse. However, tapered-off opioid
      treatment is palliative and without long-term benefit.

TI  - Efficacy of oxycodone in neuropathic pain: a randomized trial in postherpetic
      neuralgia.
PG  - 1837-41
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although opioid analgesics are used in the management of neuropathic
      pain syndromes, evidence of their efficacy remains to be established. We
      evaluated the clinical efficacy and safety of oxycodone in neuropathic pain using
      postherpetic neuralgia as a model. METHODS: Patients with postherpetic neuralgia 
      of at least moderate intensity were randomized to controlled-release oxycodone 10
      mg or placebo every 12 hours, each for 4 weeks, using a double-blind, crossover
      design. The dose was increased weekly up to a possible maximum of 30 mg every 12 
      hours. Pain intensity and pain relief were assessed daily, and steady (ongoing)
      pain, brief (paroxysmal) pain, skin pain (allodynia), and pain relief were
      recorded at weekly visits. Clinical effectiveness, disability, and treatment
      preference were also assessed. RESULTS: Fifty patients were enrolled and 38
      completed the study (16 men, 22 women, age 70+/-11 years, onset of postherpetic
      neuralgia 31+/-29 months, duration of pain 18+/-5 hours per day). The oxycodone
      dose during the final week was 45+/-17 mg per day. Compared with placebo,
      oxycodone resulted in pain relief (2.9+/-1.2 versus 1.8+/-1.1, p=0.0001) and
      reductions in steady pain (34+/-26 versus 55+/-27 mm, p=0.0001), allodynia
      (32+/-26 versus 50+/-30 mm, p=0.0004), and paroxysmal spontaneous pain (22+/-24
      versus 42+/-32 mm, p=0.0001). Global effectiveness, disability, and masked
      patient preference all showed superior scores with oxycodone relative to placebo 
      (1.8+/-1.1 versus 0.7+/-1.0, p=0.0001; 0.3+/-0.8 versus 0.7+/-1.0, p=0.041; 67%
      versus 11%, p=0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Controlled-release oxycodone is 
      an effective analgesic for the management of steady pain, paroxysmal spontaneous 
      pain, and allodynia, which frequently characterize postherpetic neuralgia.

TI  - Randomised trial of oral morphine for chronic non-cancer pain.
PG  - 143-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of opioid analgesics for chronic non-cancer pain is
      controversial. Some surveys report good pain relief and improvement in
      performance while others suggest a poor outcome with a propensity to
      psychological dependence or addiction. METHODS: We undertook a randomised
      double-blind crossover study to test the hypothesis that oral morphine relieves
      pain and improves the quality of life in patients with chronic regional pain of
      soft tissue or musculoskeletal origin who have not responded to codeine,
      anti-inflammatory agents, and antidepressants. Morphine was administered as a
      sustained-release preparation in doses up to 60 mg twice daily and compared with 
      benztropine (active placebo) in doses up to 1 mg twice daily over three-week
      titration, six-week evaluation, and two-week washout phases. Pain intensity, pain
      relief, and drug liking were rated weekly and psychological features, functional 
      status, and cognition were assessed at baseline and at the end of each evaluation
      phase. FINDINGS: After dose titration in the 46 patients who completed the study,
      the mean daily doses of drugs were morphine 83.5 mg and benztropine 1.7 mg. On
      visual analogue scales, the morphine group showed a reduction in pain intensity
      relative to placebo in period I (p = 0.01) and this group also fared better in a 
      crossover analysis of the sum of pain intensity differences from baseline (p =
      0.02). No other significant differences were detected. INTERPRETATION: In
      patients with treatment-resistant chronic regional pain of soft-tissue or
      musculoskeletal origin, nine weeks of oral morphine in doses up to 120 mg daily
      may confer analgesic benefit with a low risk of addiction but is unlikely to
      yield psychological or functional improvement.

TI  - Efficacy of controlled-release codeine in chronic non-malignant pain: a
      randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial.
PG  - 169-78
AB  - Treatment decisions for the use of opioid analgesics in chronic non-malignant
      pain are based primarily on survey data, as evidence from well-controlled
      clinical trials has been lacking. Forty-six patients with chronic non-malignant
      pain were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation
      of controlled-release (CR) codeine. Following a 3-7-day diary familiarization
      period, patients were randomly assigned to 7 days of treatment each with CR
      codeine q12h or placebo. The CR codeine dose was determined from the consumption 
      of acetaminophen+codeine in the 7 days preceding the study. During both phases,
      breakthrough pain was treated with acetaminophen+codeine every 4 h as required.
      Pain intensity was assessed at 08:00 h and 20:00 h using a visual analogue scale 
      (VAS) and a 5-point categorical scale, and rescue analgesic consumption was
      recorded at the time of use. Thirty patients (17 female, 13 male; mean age: 55.1 
      +/- 13.4 years) completed the study and were treated with a mean daily CR codeine
      dose of 273 +/- 78 mg (range: 200-400 mg). CR codeine treatment resulted in
      significantly lower overall VAS pain intensity scores (35 +/- 18 vs. 49 +/- 16, P
      = 0.0001), categorical pain intensity scores (1.7 +/- 0.6 vs. 2.2 +/- 0.6, P =
      0.0001), and in pain scores by day of treatment and by time of day. Daily rescue 
      analgesic consumption was significantly lower on CR codeine, relative to placebo 
      treatment (3.6 +/- 3.5 vs. 6.1 +/- 3.2 tablets/day, P = 0.0001). There was also a
      significant reduction in the Pain Disability Index (PDI) on CR codeine, compared 
      to placebo (25.0 +/- 7.7 vs. 35.1 +/- 8.2, P = 0.0001). Patients' and
      investigators' blinded treatment preference was significantly in favor of CR
      codeine, relative to placebo (73% vs. 10%, P = 0.0160 and 80% vs. 7%, P = 0.0014,
      respectively). The incidence of nausea was significantly higher on CR codeine
      than on placebo (32.6% vs. 11.9%, P = 0.013). Ninety-three percent of patients
      completing the study requested long-term, open-label treatment with CR codeine.
      Pain intensity scores at the completion of 19 weeks of long-term evaluation were 
      comparable to those during the double-blind CR codeine treatment. We conclude
      that treatment with CR codeine results in reduced pain and pain-related
      disability in patients with chronic non-malignant pain.
