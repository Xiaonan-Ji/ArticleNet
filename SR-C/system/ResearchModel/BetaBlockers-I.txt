TI  - Comparison of effectiveness of carvedilol versus bisoprolol for maintenance of
      sinus rhythm after cardioversion of persistent atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 1116-9
AB  - Ninety patients who underwent cardioversion of persistent atrial fibrillation
      (AF) were randomized to bisoprolol 5 to 10 mg once daily or carvedilol 12.5 to 25
      mg twice daily. Using intention-to-treat analysis, 23 patients (46%) in the
      bisoprolol group and 17 patients (32%) in the carvedilol group relapsed into AF
      during the 1 year of total follow-up (p = 0.486). Patients treated with
      carvedilol had a 14% (hazard ratio 0.86) lower risk of relapse of AF compared
      with patients in the bisoprolol group, although results were statistically
      insignificant (p = 0.661) after controlling for patient age, gender, baseline
      heart rate, and left atrial diameter.

TI  - Comparison of carvedilol and metoprolol on clinical outcomes in patients with
      chronic heart failure in the Carvedilol Or Metoprolol European Trial (COMET):
      randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 7-13
AB  - BACKGROUND: Beta blockers reduce mortality in patients who have chronic heart
      failure, systolic dysfunction, and are on background treatment with diuretics and
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We aimed to compare the effects of
      carvedilol and metoprolol on clinical outcome. METHODS: In a multicentre,
      double-blind, and randomised parallel group trial, we assigned 1511 patients with
      chronic heart failure to treatment with carvedilol (target dose 25 mg twice
      daily) and 1518 to metoprolol (metoprolol tartrate, target dose 50 mg twice
      daily). Patients were required to have chronic heart failure (NYHA II-IV),
      previous admission for a cardiovascular reason, an ejection fraction of less than
      0.35, and to have been treated optimally with diuretics and
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors unless not tolerated. The primary
      endpoints were all-cause mortality and the composite endpoint of all-cause
      mortality or all-cause admission. Analysis was done by intention to treat.
      FINDINGS: The mean study duration was 58 months (SD 6). The mean ejection
      fraction was 0.26 (0.07) and the mean age 62 years (11). The all-cause mortality 
      was 34% (512 of 1511) for carvedilol and 40% (600 of 1518) for metoprolol (hazard
      ratio 0.83 [95% CI 0.74-0.93], p=0.0017). The reduction of all-cause mortality
      was consistent across predefined subgroups. The composite endpoint of mortality
      or all-cause admission occurred in 1116 (74%) of 1511 on carvedilol and in 1160
      (76%) of 1518 on metoprolol (0.94 [0.86-1.02], p=0.122). Incidence of
      side-effects and drug withdrawals did not differ by much between the two study
      groups. INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that carvedilol extends survival
      compared with metoprolol.

TI  - Carvedilol increases two-year survivalin dialysis patients with dilated
      cardiomyopathy: a prospective, placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 1438-44
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We sought to evaluate the effects of carvedilol on mortality and
      morbidity in dialysis patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. BACKGROUND: Several
      lines of evidence support the concept that therapy with beta-blocking agents
      reduces morbidity and mortality in patients with congestive heart failure (HF),
      but the demonstration of such a survival benefit in dialysis patients with
      dilated cardiomyopathy is still lacking. METHODS: A total of 114 dialysis
      patients with dilated cardiomyopathy were randomized to receive either carvedilol
      or placebo in addition to standard therapy. A first analysis was performed at one
      year and was followed by an additional follow-up period of 12 months. RESULTS:
      Two-year echocardiographic data revealed a significant attenuation of pathologic 
      remodeling, with smaller cavity diameters and higher ejection fractions in the
      active treatment group than in the placebo group. At two years, 51.7% of the
      patients died in the carvedilol group, compared with 73.2% in the placebo group
      (p < 0.01). Furthermore, there were significantly fewer cardiovascular deaths
      (29.3%) and hospital admissions (34.5%) among patients receiving carvedilol than 
      among those receiving a placebo (67.9% and 58.9%, respectively; p < 0.00001). The
      exploratory analyses revealed that fatal myocardial infarctions, fatal strokes,
      and hospital admissions for worsening HF were lower in the carvedilol group than 
      in the placebo group. A reduction in sudden deaths and pump-failure deaths was
      also observed, though it did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS:
      Carvedilol reduced morbidity and mortality in dialysis patients with dilated
      cardiomyopathy. These data suggest the use of carvedilol in all dialysis patients
      with chronic HF.

TI  - Effects of initiating carvedilol in patients with severe chronic heart failure:
      results from the COPERNICUS Study.
PG  - 712-8
AB  - CONTEXT: Beta-blockers remain underused despite their established utility for
      improving outcome in heart failure. Concerns that initiation of treatment
      produces few immediate benefits and may have important risks may be deterring
      widespread use. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the early effects of the beta-blocker
      carvedilol in patients with severe heart failure. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: 
      Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted from October 28,
      1997, to March 20, 2000, at 334 hospital centers in 21 countries among 2289
      patients with symptoms of heart failure at rest or with minimal exertion who were
      clinically euvolemic and had a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than
      25%. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned to receive carvedilol, with
      start dosage of at 3.125 mg twice daily with uptitration to a target dosage of 25
      mg twice daily (n = 1156), or placebo (n = 1133), in addition to their usual
      medications for heart failure. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Death, hospitalization, or 
      permanent withdrawal from study drug, as well as adverse events during the first 
      8 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: The carvedilol group experienced no increase in
      cardiovascular risk but instead had fewer patients who died (19 vs 25; hazard
      ratio [HR], 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41-1.35); who died or were
      hospitalized (134 vs 153; HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.67-1.07); or who died, were
      hospitalized, or were permanently withdrawn from treatment (162 vs 188; HR, 0.83;
      95% CI, 0.68-1.03). These effects were similar in direction and magnitude to
      those observed during the entire study, and were apparent particularly in the 624
      patients with recent or recurrent decompensation or a very depressed left
      ventricular ejection fraction. Differences in favor of carvedilol became apparent
      as early as 14 to 21 days following initiation of treatment. Worsening heart
      failure was the only serious adverse event with a frequency greater than 2% and
      was reported with similar frequency in the placebo and carvedilol groups (6.4% vs
      5.1%). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that, in clinically euvolemic patients,
      the relation of benefit to risk during initiation of treatment with carvedilol is
      similar to that seen during long-term therapy with the drug. Our findings should 
      provide the reassurance needed to encourage the high levels of use that are
      warranted by the results of long-term clinical trials.

TI  - Major outcomes in high-risk hypertensive patients randomized to
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or calcium channel blocker vs diuretic:
      The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial
      (ALLHAT).
PG  - 2981-97
AB  - CONTEXT: Antihypertensive therapy is well established to reduce
      hypertension-related morbidity and mortality, but the optimal first-step therapy 
      is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether treatment with a calcium channel
      blocker or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lowers the incidence of
      coronary heart disease (CHD) or other cardiovascular disease (CVD) events vs
      treatment with a diuretic. DESIGN: The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering
      Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), a randomized, double-blind,
      active-controlled clinical trial conducted from February 1994 through March 2002.
      SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 33 357 participants aged 55 years or older
      with hypertension and at least 1 other CHD risk factor from 623 North American
      centers. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned to receive
      chlorthalidone, 12.5 to 25 mg/d (n = 15 255); amlodipine, 2.5 to 10 mg/d (n =
      9048); or lisinopril, 10 to 40 mg/d (n = 9054) for planned follow-up of
      approximately 4 to 8 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was
      combined fatal CHD or nonfatal myocardial infarction, analyzed by
      intent-to-treat. Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, stroke, combined
      CHD (primary outcome, coronary revascularization, or angina with
      hospitalization), and combined CVD (combined CHD, stroke, treated angina without 
      hospitalization, heart failure [HF], and peripheral arterial disease). RESULTS:
      Mean follow-up was 4.9 years. The primary outcome occurred in 2956 participants, 
      with no difference between treatments. Compared with chlorthalidone (6-year rate,
      11.5%), the relative risks (RRs) were 0.98 (95% CI, 0.90-1.07) for amlodipine
      (6-year rate, 11.3%) and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.91-1.08) for lisinopril (6-year rate,
      11.4%). Likewise, all-cause mortality did not differ between groups. Five-year
      systolic blood pressures were significantly higher in the amlodipine (0.8 mm Hg, 
      P =.03) and lisinopril (2 mm Hg, P<.001) groups compared with chlorthalidone, and
      5-year diastolic blood pressure was significantly lower with amlodipine (0.8 mm
      Hg, P<.001). For amlodipine vs chlorthalidone, secondary outcomes were similar
      except for a higher 6-year rate of HF with amlodipine (10.2% vs 7.7%; RR, 1.38;
      95% CI, 1.25-1.52). For lisinopril vs chlorthalidone, lisinopril had higher
      6-year rates of combined CVD (33.3% vs 30.9%; RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.05-1.16);
      stroke (6.3% vs 5.6%; RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.02-1.30); and HF (8.7% vs 7.7%; RR,
      1.19; 95% CI, 1.07-1.31). CONCLUSION: Thiazide-type diuretics are superior in
      preventing 1 or more major forms of CVD and are less expensive. They should be
      preferred for first-step antihypertensive therapy.

TI  - Effect of carvedilol on the morbidity of patients with severe chronic heart
      failure: results of the carvedilol prospective randomized cumulative survival
      (COPERNICUS) study.
PG  - 2194-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Beta-blocking agents improve functional status and reduce morbidity
      in mild-to-moderate heart failure, but it is not known whether they produce such 
      benefits in severe heart failure. METHODS AND RESULTS: We randomly assigned 2289 
      patients with symptoms of heart failure at rest or on minimal exertion and with
      an ejection fraction <25% (but not volume-overloaded) to double-blind treatment
      with either placebo (n=1133) or carvedilol (n=1156) for an average of 10.4
      months. Carvedilol reduced the combined risk of death or hospitalization for a
      cardiovascular reason by 27% (P=0.00002) and the combined risk of death or
      hospitalization for heart failure by 31% (P=0.000004). Patients in the carvedilol
      group also spent 27% fewer days in the hospital for any reason (P=0.0005) and 40%
      fewer days in the hospital for heart failure (P<0.0001). These differences were
      as a result of both a decrease in the number of hospitalizations and a shorter
      duration of each admission. More patients felt improved and fewer patients felt
      worse in the carvedilol group than in the placebo group after 6 months of
      maintenance therapy (P=0.0009). Carvedilol-treated patients were also less likely
      than placebo-treated patients to experience a serious adverse event (P=0.002),
      especially worsening heart failure, sudden death, cardiogenic shock, or
      ventricular tachycardia. CONCLUSION: In euvolemic patients with symptoms at rest 
      or on minimal exertion, the addition of carvedilol to conventional therapy
      ameliorates the severity of heart failure and reduces the risk of clinical
      deterioration, hospitalization, and other serious adverse clinical events.

TI  - Beta-blocker therapy influences the hemodynamic response to inotropic agents in
      patients with heart failure: a randomized comparison of dobutamine and enoximone 
      before and after chronic treatment with metoprolol or carvedilol.
PG  - 1248-58
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We compared the hemodynamic effects of dobutamine and enoximone
      administration before and after long-term beta-blocker therapy with metoprolol or
      carvedilol in patients with chronic heart failure (HF). BACKGROUND: Patients with
      HF on beta-blocker therapy may need hemodynamic support with inotropic agents,
      and the hemodynamic response may be influenced by both the inotropic agent and
      the beta-blocker used. METHODS: The hemodynamic effects of dobutamine (5 to 20
      microg/kg/min intravenously) and enoximone (0.5 to 2 mg/kg intravenously) were
      assessed by pulmonary artery catheterization in 29 patients with chronic HF
      before and after 9 to 12 months of treatment with metoprolol or carvedilol at
      standard target maintenance oral doses. Hemodynamic studies were performed after 
      >/=12 h of wash-out from all cardiovascular medications, except the beta-blockers
      that were administered 3 h before the second study. RESULTS: Compared with before
      beta-blocker therapy, metoprolol treatment decreased the magnitude of mean
      pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and pulmonary wedge pressure (PWP) decline during
      dobutamine infusion and increased the cardiac index (CI) and stroke volume index 
      (SVI) response to enoximone administration, without any effect on other
      hemodynamic parameters. Carvedilol treatment abolished the increase in heart
      rate, SVI, and CI and caused a rise, rather than a decline, in PAP, PWP, systemic
      vascular resistance, and pulmonary vascular resistance during dobutamine
      infusion. The hemodynamic response to enoximone, however, was maintained or
      enhanced in the presence of carvedilol. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast with its effects
      on enoximone, carvedilol and, to a lesser extent, metoprolol treatment may
      significantly inhibit the favorable hemodynamic response to dobutamine. No such
      beta-blocker-related attenuation of hemodynamic effects occurs with enoximone.

TI  - Metoprolol CR/XL in female patients with heart failure: analysis of the
      experience in Metoprolol Extended-Release Randomized Intervention Trial in Heart 
      Failure (MERIT-HF).
PG  - 1585-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: Underrepresentation of women in heart failure clinical trials has
      limited conclusions regarding the effect of various management strategies on
      survival in women with heart failure and decreased left ventricular ejection
      fraction (LVEF). METHODS AND RESULTS: MERIT-HF (Metoprolol Extended-Release
      Randomized Intervention Trial in Heart Failure) was a randomized,
      placebo-controlled study, the purpose of which was to evaluate the effect of
      metoprolol controlled-release/extended-release (CR/XL) in 3991 patients with New 
      York Heart Association class II to IV heart failure and LVEF < or =0.40. We
      performed a post hoc analysis to evaluate the effect of metoprolol CR/XL on
      outcome in women (n=898), including the outcome in 183 women with severe heart
      failure (New York Heart Association class III/IV and LVEF < 0.25). Treatment with
      metoprolol CR/XL in women resulted in a 21% reduction in the primary combined end
      point of all-cause mortality/all-cause hospitalizations (164 versus 137 patients;
      P=0.044). The number of cardiovascular hospitalizations was reduced by 29% (164
      versus 120; P=0.013), and hospitalization for worsening heart failure was reduced
      by 42% (95 versus 56; P=0.021). Similar results were noted in the subgroup of
      women with severe heart failure, with a 57% reduction in cardiovascular
      hospitalizations (63 versus 30; P=0.005) and a 72% reduction in hospitalization
      due to worsening heart failure (46 versus 14; P=0.0004). A pooling of mortality
      results from MERIT-HF, the Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study (CIBIS II), and
      the Carvedilol Prospective Randomized Cumulative Survival Study (COPERNICUS)
      showed very similar survival benefits in women and men. CONCLUSIONS: The
      beneficial effects of metoprolol CR/XL extend to women with heart failure,
      including women with clinically stable severe heart failure.

TI  - Tolerability of beta-blocker initiation and titration in the Metoprolol CR/XL
      Randomized Intervention Trial in Congestive Heart Failure (MERIT-HF).
PG  - 1182-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: beta-Blockade improves survival when administered over a long period 
      of time to patients with heart failure. However, the time course of any possible 
      deterioration during the titration phase has not been reported. METHODS AND
      RESULTS: We looked at evidence of clinical deterioration in the Metoprolol CR/XL 
      Randomized Intervention Trial in Congestive Heart Failure (MERIT-HF) by analyzing
      events and symptoms during the first 90 days. During titration, the Kaplan-Meier 
      curves for the combined end point of all-cause mortality/all-cause
      hospitalization were similar in all patients randomized, with no significant
      difference in favor of placebo at any visit or in any of the analyzed subgroups
      (New York Heart Association class II, III/IV, or III/IV with ejection fraction
      <0.25, heart rate less-than-or-equal 76 bpm, and systolic blood pressure
      less-than-or-equal 120 mm Hg). The curves started to diverge in favor of
      beta-blockade after 60 days. Low heart rate was the main factor that limited
      titration. In New York Heart Association class III/IV, 5.9% of the patients
      receiving placebo discontinued study medicine during the first 90 days compared
      with 8.1% of those receiving metoprolol CR/XL (P=0.037 unadjusted, P=NS
      adjusted); corresponding figures in those with New York Heart Association class
      III/IV and ejection fraction <0.25 were 7.1% and 8.0% (P=NS). From day 90 until
      the end of the study, more patients in the placebo group discontinued study
      medicine in all subgroups. There was no change in diuretic or ACE inhibitor
      dosing with beta-blocker titration. Most patients reported no change in symptoms 
      of breathlessness or fatigue during the titration phase. CONCLUSIONS: When
      carefully titrated, metoprolol CR/XL can be given safely to the overwhelming
      majority of patients with stable mild to moderate heart failure, with minimal
      side effects or deterioration.

TI  - Aspirin impairs reverse myocardial remodeling in patients with heart failure
      treated with beta-blockers.
PG  - 1950-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that aspirin (ASA) might alter the beneficial effect 
      of beta-blockers on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients with
      chronic heart failure. BACKGROUND: Aspirin blunts the vasodilation caused by both
      angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers in hypertensive 
      patients and in patients with heart failure. Several studies suggest that ASA
      also blunts some of beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors on mortality in patients
      with heart failure. To our knowledge, there have been no data evaluating the
      possible interaction of ASA and beta-blockers on left ventricular remodeling in
      patients with heart failure. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated patients
      entered into the Multicenter Oral Carvedilol Heart failure Assessment (MOCHA)
      trial, a 6-month, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter,
      dose-response evaluation of carvedilol in patients with chronic stable
      symptomatic heart failure. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine if
      aspirin independently influenced the improvement in LVEF. RESULTS: Over all
      randomized patients (n = 293), LVEF improved 8.2 +/- 0.8 ejection fraction (EF)
      units in ASA nonusers and 4.5 +/- 0.7 EF units in ASA users (p = 0.005). In
      subjects randomized to treatment with carvedilol (n = 231), LVEF improved 9.5 +/-
      0.9 EF units in ASA nonusers and 5.8 +/- 0.8 EF units in ASA users (p = 0.02). In
      subjects randomized to treatment with placebo (n = 62), LVEF improved 2.8 +/- 1.2
      EF units in ASA nonusers and 0.5 +/- 1.4 EF units in ASA users (p = 0.20).
      Aspirin did not significantly affect the heart rate or systolic blood pressure
      response in either the placebo or carvedilol groups. The effect of ASA became
      more significant on multivariate analysis. The change in LVEF was also influenced
      by carvedilol dose, etiology of heart failure, baseline heart rate, EF and
      coumadin use. The detrimental effect of ASA on the improvement in LVEF was
      dose-related and was present in both placebo and carvedilol groups, although the 
      effect was statistically significant only in the much larger carvedilol group.
      CONCLUSIONS: Aspirin significantly affects the changes in LVEF over time in
      patients with heart failure and systolic dysfunction treated with carvedilol. The
      specific mechanism(s) underlying this interaction are unknown and further studies
      are needed to provide additional understanding of the molecular basis of factors 
      influencing reverse remodeling in patients with heart failure.

TI  - Metoprolol controlled release/extended release in patients with severe heart
      failure: analysis of the experience in the MERIT-HF study.
PG  - 932-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study analyzed the effect of the beta(1)-selective beta-blocker 
      metoprolol succinate controlled release/extended release (CR/XL) once daily on
      mortality, hospitalizations and tolerability in patients with severe heart
      failure. BACKGROUND: There continues to be resistance to the incorporation of
      beta-blockers into clinical care, largely due to concerns about their benefit in 
      patients with more severe heart failure. METHOD: SA subgroup of patients from
      Metoprolol CR/XL Randomized Intervention Trial in chronic Heart Failure
      (MERIT-HF) in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III/IV with left
      ventricular ejection fraction < 0.25 were identified (n = 795). The analysis was 
      by intention-to-treat. RESULTS: The mean ejection fraction at baseline was 0.19, 
      and the yearly placebo mortality during follow-up was 19.1%. Treatment with
      metoprolol CR/XL compared to placebo resulted in significant reductions in all
      predefined mortality end points including: total mortality, 45 versus 72 deaths
      (risk reduction 39%; 95% confidence interval 11% to 58%; p = 0.0086); sudden
      death, 22 vs. 39 deaths (45% [7% to 67%]; p = 0.024); and death due to worsening 
      heart failure, 13 vs. 28 deaths (55% [13% to 77%]; p = 0.015). Metoprolol CR/XL
      also reduced the number of hospitalizations for worsening heart failure by 45%
      compared with placebo (p < 0.0001). The NYHA functional class improved in the
      metoprolol CR/XL group compared with placebo (p = 0.0031). Metoprolol CR/XL was
      well tolerated, with 31% fewer patients withdrawn from study medicine (all
      causes) compared with placebo (p = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: This subgroup analysis of
      the MERIT-HF study shows that patients with severe heart failure receive a
      similar mortality benefit and a similar reduction in hospitalizations for
      worsening heart failure with metoprolol CR/XL treatment as those patients
      included in the total study.

TI  - Plasma N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and adrenomedullin: prognostic
      utility and prediction of benefit from carvedilol in chronic ischemic left
      ventricular dysfunction. Australia-New Zealand Heart Failure Group.
PG  - 1781-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We sought to assess plasma concentrations of the amino (N)-terminal
      portion of pro-brain natriuretic peptide (N-BNP) and adrenomedullin for
      prediction of adverse outcomes and responses to treatment in 297 patients with
      ischemic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction who were randomly assigned to receive 
      carvedilol or placebo. BACKGROUND: Although neurohormonal status has known
      prognostic significance in heart failure, the predictive power of either N-BNP or
      adrenomedullin in chronic ischemic LV dysfunction has not been previously
      reported. METHODS: Plasma N-BNP and adrenomedullin were measured in 297 patients 
      with chronic ischemic (LV) dysfunction before randomization to carvedilol or
      placebo, added to established treatment with a converting enzyme inhibitor and
      loop diuretic (with or without digoxin). The patients' clinical outcomes,
      induding mortality and heart failure events, were recorded for 18 months.
      RESULTS: Above-median N-BNP and adrenomedullin levels conferred increased risks
      (all p < 0.001) of mortality (risk ratios [95% confidence intervals]: 4.67
      [2-10.9] and 3.92 [1.76-8.7], respectively) and hospital admission with heart
      failure (4.7 [2.2-10.3] and 2.4 [1.3-4.5], respectively). Both of these predicted
      death or heart failure independent of age, New York Heart Association functional 
      class, LV ejection fraction, previous myocardial infarction or previous admission
      with heart failure. Carvedilol reduced the risk of death or heart failure in
      patients with above-median levels of N-BNP or adrenomedullin, or both, to rates
      not significantly different from those observed in patients with levels below the
      median value. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with established ischemic LV dysfunction, 
      plasma N-BNP and adrenomedullin are independent predictors of mortality and heart
      failure. Carvedilol reduced mortality and heart failure in patients with higher
      pre-treatment plasma N-BNP and adrenomedullin.

TI  - Effect of carvedilol on survival in severe chronic heart failure.
PG  - 1651-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Beta-blocking agents reduce the risk of hospitalization and death in 
      patients with mild-to-moderate heart failure, but little is known about their
      effects in severe heart failure. METHODS: We evaluated 2289 patients who had
      symptoms of heart failure at rest or on minimal exertion, who were clinically
      euvolemic, and who had an ejection fraction of less than 25 percent. In a
      double-blind fashion, we randomly assigned 1133 patients to placebo and 1156
      patients to treatment with carvedilol for a mean period of 10.4 months, during
      which standard therapy for heart failure was continued. Patients who required
      intensive care, had marked fluid retention, or were receiving intravenous
      vasodilators or positive inotropic drugs were excluded. RESULTS: There were 190
      deaths in the placebo group and 130 deaths in the carvedilol group. This
      difference reflected a 35 percent decrease in the risk of death with carvedilol
      (95 percent confidence interval, 19 to 48 percent; P=0.00013, unadjusted;
      P=0.0014, adjusted for interim analyses). A total of 507 patients died or were
      hospitalized in the placebo group, as compared with 425 in the carvedilol group. 
      This difference reflected a 24 percent decrease in the combined risk of death or 
      hospitalization with carvedilol (95 percent confidence interval, 13 to 33
      percent; P<0.001). The favorable effects on both end points were seen
      consistently in all the subgroups we examined, including patients with a history 
      of recent or recurrent cardiac decompensation. Fewer patients in the carvedilol
      group than in the placebo group withdrew because of adverse effects or for other 
      reasons (P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The previously reported benefits of carvedilol
      with regard to morbidity and mortality in patients with mild-to-moderate heart
      failure were also apparent in the patients with severe heart failure who were
      evaluated in this trial.

TI  - Effect of carvedilol on outcome after myocardial infarction in patients with
      left-ventricular dysfunction: the CAPRICORN randomised trial.
PG  - 1385-90
AB  - BACKGROUND: The beneficial effects of beta-blockers on long-term outcome after
      acute myocardial infarction were shown before the introduction of thrombolysis
      and angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Generally, the patients
      recruited to these trials were at low risk: few had heart failure, and none had
      measurements of left-ventricular function taken. We investigated the long-term
      efficacy of carvedilol on morbidity and mortality in patients with
      left-ventricular dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction treated according 
      to current evidence-based practice. METHODS: In a multicentre, randomised,
      placebo-controlled trial, 1959 patients with a proven acute myocardial infarction
      and a left-ventricular ejection fraction of </=40% were randomly assigned 6.25 mg
      carvedilol (n=975) or placebo (n=984). Study medication was progressively
      increased to a maximum of 25 mg twice daily during the next 4-6 weeks, and
      patients were followed up until the requisite number of primary endpoints had
      occurred. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality or hospital admission for 
      cardiovascular problems. Analysis was by intention to treat. FINDINGS: Although
      there was no difference between the carvedilol and placebo groups in the number
      of patients with the primary endpoint (340 [35%] vs 367 [37%], hazard ratio 0.92 
      [95% CI 0.80-1.07]), all-cause mortality alone was lower in the carvedilol group 
      than in the placebo group (116 [12%] vs 151 [15%], 0.77 [0.60-0.98], p=0.03).
      Cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarctions, and all-cause
      mortality or non-fatal myocardial infarction were also lower on carvedilol than
      on placebo. INTERPRETATION: In patients treated long-term after an acute
      myocardial infarction complicated by left-ventricular systolic dysfunction,
      carvedilol reduced the frequency of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, and
      recurrent, non-fatal myocardial infarctions. These beneficial effects are
      additional to those of evidence-based treatments for acute myocardial infarction 
      including ACE inhibitors.

TI  - Effect of beta 1 blockade with atenolol on progression of heart failure in
      patients pretreated with high-dose enalapril.
PG  - 407-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: The survival benefit of beta-blocker treatment in patients with heart
      failure has been established in recent trials. Yet, the impact of beta-blockers
      added on high dose angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors has not been
      reported. AIMS: To investigate the effect of atenolol, a hydrophilic, selective
      beta1-adrenergic antagonist, added on enalapril 40 mg/day in patients with
      advanced left ventricular dysfunction in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial.
      METHODS: One hundred and nineteen patients with class II or III heart failure,
      left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 25% and treatment with 40 mg enalapril 
      daily were given an initial challenge dose of atenolol 12. 5 mg. One hundred
      patients (54 with idiopathic, 28 with ischemic, 18 with other dilated
      cardiomyopathy) tolerated challenge and were randomized to atenolol (maintenance 
      dose 89+/-11 mg/day, range 50-100 mg/day) or placebo. The primary endpoint was
      combined worsening heart failure or death within 2 years, the secondary endpoint 
      was hospitalization for cardiac events. RESULTS: After 395+/-266 days interim
      analysis revealed a significant difference between the atenolol and placebo group
      (log rank P<0.01) and the trial was concluded. Twenty-seven patients had
      developed worsening heart failure (8 in the atenolol group vs. 19 in the placebo 
      group) and 13 patients had died (5 in the atenolol vs. 8 in the placebo group).
      Overall there were 23 hospitalizations for cardiac events (6 in the atenolol
      group vs. 21 in the placebo group, P=0.07); 17 hospitalizations were due to
      worsening heart failure (5 in the atenolol group, 12 in the placebo-group,
      P=0.05) and 10 due to arrhythmias (1 in the atenolol group vs. 9 in the placebo
      group, P<0.01) CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that in patients with advanced left 
      ventricular dysfunction, beta-blockers can provide substantial benefits
      supplementary to that already achieved with high dose enalapril treatment.

TI  - A double blind controlled study of propranolol and cyproheptadine in migraine
      prophylaxis.
PG  - 223-6
AB  - Role of propranolol and cyproheptadine in the prophylaxis of migraine was studied
      in a controlled double blind trial. Two hundred fifty-nine patients were divided 
      into four groups. Each group was either given a placebo, cyproheptadine,
      propranolol or a combination of the latter two drugs. The patients were followed 
      for a period of three months. Significant relief in frequency, duration and
      severity from migranous attacks was seen in all drug treated groups over placebo.
      Significant correlation in response was seen in frequency, duration and severity 
      in all the groups which received drugs. Statistically more significant relief was
      seen in cyproheptadine and propranolol treated group as compared to individual
      drug treated groups. In cyproheptadine and propranolol treated groups, the
      dropout rate was lower and associated symptoms were better relieved than in other
      groups. The study shows efficacy of combination of cyproheptadine and propranolol
      in migraine prophylaxis.

TI  - Differential effects of beta-blockers in patients with heart failure: A
      prospective, randomized, double-blind comparison of the long-term effects of
      metoprolol versus carvedilol.
PG  - 546-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: Both metoprolol and carvedilol produce hemodynamic and clinical
      benefits in patients with chronic heart failure; carvedilol exerts greater
      antiadrenergic effects than metoprolol, but it is unknown whether this
      pharmacological difference results in hemodynamic and clinical differences
      between the 2 drugs. METHODS AND RESULTS: We randomized 150 patients with heart
      failure (left ventricular ejection fraction </=0.35) to double-blind treatment
      with either metoprolol or carvedilol. When compared with metoprolol (124+/-55
      mg/d), patients treated with carvedilol (49+/-18 mg/d) showed larger increases in
      left ventricular ejection fraction at rest (+10.9+/-11.0 versus +7.2+/-7.7 U,
      P=0.038) and in left ventricular stroke volume and stroke work during exercise
      (both P<0. 05) after 13 to 15 months of treatment. In addition, carvedilol
      produced greater decreases in mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary wedge 
      pressure, both at rest and during exercise, than metoprolol (all P<0.05). In
      contrast, the metoprolol group showed greater increases in maximal exercise
      capacity than the carvedilol group (P=0.035), but the 2 drugs improved symptoms, 
      submaximal exercise tolerance, and quality of life to a similar degree. After a
      mean of 23+/-11 months of follow-up, 21 patients in the metoprolol group and 17
      patients in the carvedilol group died or underwent urgent transplantation.
      CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that during long-term therapy,
      carvedilol improves cardiac performance to a greater extent than metoprolol when 
      administered to patients with heart failure in the doses shown to be effective in
      clinical trials. These differences were likely related to a greater
      antiadrenergic activity of carvedilol.

TI  - Use of metoprolol CR/XL to maintain sinus rhythm after conversion from persistent
      atrial fibrillation: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 139-46
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of the present study was to assess the efficacy
      of metoprolol CR/XL to reduce the risk of relapse after cardioversion of
      persistent atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm. BACKGROUND: Indirect data from
      studies with d,l sotalol provide evidence that the beta-blocking effects of the
      compound are important in maintaining sinus rhythm after cardioversion of atrial 
      fibrillation. METHODS: After successful conversion to sinus rhythm, 394 patients 
      with a history of persistent atrial fibrillation were randomly assigned to
      treatment with metoprolol CR/XL or placebo. The two treatment groups were similar
      with respect to all pretreatment characteristics. Patients were seen on an
      outpatient basis for recording of resting electrocardiogram (ECG) after one week,
      one, three and six months of follow-up or whenever they felt that they had a
      relapse into atrial fibrillation or experienced an adverse event. RESULTS: In the
      metoprolol CR/XL group, 96 patients (48.7%) had a relapse into atrial
      fibrillation compared with 118 patients (59.9%) in the placebo group (p = 0.005).
      Heart rate in patients after a relapse into atrial fibrillation was significantly
      lower in the metoprolol group (98 +/- 23 beats/min) than in the placebo group
      (107 +/- 27 beats/min). The rate of adverse events reported was similar in both
      groups when the difference in follow-up time was taken into account. CONCLUSIONS:
      The results of this double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients after
      cardioversion of persistent atrial fibrillation showed that metoprolol CR/XL was 
      effective in preventing relapse into atrial fibrillation or flutter.

TI  - Endothelin-1 induces interleukin-6 release via activation of the transcription
      factor NF-kappaB in human vascular smooth muscle cells.
PG  - 98-105
AB  - The potent vasoconstrictor peptide endothelin-1 (ET-1) has been implicated in the
      pathophysiology of atherosclerosis and its complications. Since inflammation of
      the vessel wall is a hallmark of atherosclerosis, the purpose of the present
      study was to investigate the influence of ET-1 on cytokine production in human
      vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) as a marker of inflammatory cell activation.
      ET-1 (100 pM - 1 microM) stimulated interleukin-6 (IL-6) secretion from human
      vascular SMC in a concentration-dependent manner. The ET-A-receptor antagonist
      BQ-123 (10 microM), but not the ET-B-receptor antagonist BQ-788, inhibited IL-6
      release. ET-1 also transiently increased IL-6 mRNA compatible with regulation of 
      IL-6 release at the pretranslational level. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays
      demonstrated time- and concentration-dependent activation of the proinflammatory 
      transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) in ET-1-stimulated human
      vascular SMC. A decoy oligodeoxynucleotide bearing the NF-kappaB binding site
      inhibited ET-1-stimulated IL-6 release to a great extent suggesting that this
      transcription factor plays a key role for cytokine production elicited by ET-1.
      Moreover, the antioxidant pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (10 microM) inhibited
      ET-1-induced IL-6 release indicating involvement of reactive oxygen species in
      ET-1 signaling. ET-1-stimulated IL-6 secretion was also suppressed by diphenylene
      iodonium (40 microM), an inhibitor of flavon-containing enzymes such as
      NADH/NADPH oxidase. The results demonstrate the ability of ET-1 to induce an
      inflammatory response in human vascular SMC. These observations may contribute to
      a better understanding of the role of ET-1 in inflammatory activation of the
      vessel wall during atherogenesis.

TI  - The effects of propranolol on cognitive function and quality of life: a
      randomized trial among patients with diastolic hypertension.
PG  - 359-65
AB  - PURPOSE: We sought to determine whether propranolol has adverse effects on
      cognitive function, depressive symptoms, and sexual function in patients treated 
      for diastolic hypertension. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We performed a
      placebo-controlled trial among 312 men and women, 22 to 59 years of age, who had 
      untreated diastolic hypertension (90 to 104 mm Hg). Patients were randomly
      assigned to treatment with propranolol (80 to 400 mg/day) or matching placebo
      tablets. Thirteen tests of cognitive function were assessed at baseline, 3
      months, and 12 months. Five tests measured reaction time to, or accuracy in,
      interpreting visual stimuli; one test measured the ability to acquire, reproduce,
      and change a set of arbitrary stimulus-response sets; and seven tests measured
      memory or learning verbal information. Depressive symptoms and sexual function
      were assessed by questionnaires at baseline and 12 months. RESULTS: There were no
      significant differences by treatment assignment for 11 of the 13 tests of
      cognitive function at either 3 or 12 months of follow-up. Compared with placebo, 
      participants treated with propranolol had slightly fewer correct responses at 3
      months (33 +/- 3 [mean +/- SD] versus 34 +/- 2, P = 0.02) and slightly more
      errors of commission at 3 months (4 +/-5 versus 3 +/- 3, P = 0.04) and at 12
      months (4 +/- 4 versus 3 +/- 3, P = 0.05). At 12 months, depressive symptoms and 
      sexual function and desire did not differ by treatment assignment. CONCLUSIONS:
      Treatment of hypertension with propranolol had limited adverse effects on tests
      of cognitive function that were of questionable clinical relevance, and there
      were no documented adverse effects on depressive symptoms or sexual function.
      Selection of beta-blockers for treatment of hypertension should be based on other
      factors.

TI  - Effects of metoprolol CR in patients with ischemic and dilated cardiomyopathy :
      the randomized evaluation of strategies for left ventricular dysfunction pilot
      study.
PG  - 378-84
AB  - BACKGROUND: Metoprolol provides clinical benefits in patients with congestive
      heart failure (CHF). In this study, we investigated the effects of
      controlled-release metoprolol (metoprolol CR) on clinical status, on left
      ventricular (LV) volumes and function, and on neurohumoral activation in a large 
      number of patients with CHF of mixed causes. METHODS AND RESULTS: Four hundred
      twenty-six patients with symptomatic CHF were randomized to receive metoprolol CR
      or placebo for 24 weeks. Metoprolol CR did not affect 6-minute walk distance, New
      York Heart Association functional class, or quality of life. However, there was a
      significant improvement in measures of LV function with an attenuation in the
      increase in LV end-diastolic (+23+/-65 mL [placebo] versus +6+/-61 mL, P=0.01)
      and LV end-systolic (+19+/-55 mL [placebo] versus -2+/-51 mL, P<0.001) volumes
      after 24 weeks of therapy. LV ejection fraction was unchanged (-0.05% or -0.005) 
      in the placebo group but increased by 2. 4% in the metoprolol CR-treated patients
      (P=0.001). Patients receiving metoprolol CR had a greater decrease in angiotensin
      II (P=0.036) and renin (P=0.032) levels but an increase in N-terminal atrial
      natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide levels (P<0. 01). There were
      fewer deaths in the group receiving beta-blockers (3. 4% versus 8.1%), and there 
      was a similar number of patients experiencing the composite outcomes of death or 
      any hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: When added to ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II
      receptor antagonists, or both, the use of metoprolol CR improves ventricular
      function, reduces activation of the renin-angiotensin systems, and results in
      fewer deaths.

TI  - Beta-blockade in heart failure: a comparison of carvedilol with metoprolol.
PG  - 1522-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study was performed to compare the long-term clinical efficacy
      of treatment with metoprolol versus carvedilol in patients with chronic heart
      failure. BACKGROUND: Beta-adrenergic blockade is of proven value in chronic heart
      failure. Metoprolol, a selective beta-blocker, is widely used, but recent trials 
      suggest carvedilol, a nonselective beta-blocker with alpha-1-receptor antagonist 
      activity and antioxidant activities, is also effective. It is uncertain, however,
      if these additional properties of carvedilol provide further clinical benefit
      compared with metoprolol. METHODS: In this randomized double-blind control trial,
      51 patients with chronic heart failure and mean left ventricular (LV) ejection
      fraction of 26% +/- 1.8% were randomly assigned treatment with metoprolol 50 mg
      twice daily or carvedilol 25 mg twice daily in addition to standard therapy after
      a four-week dose titration period for a total of 12 weeks. Response was assessed 
      by a quality of life questionnaire, New York Heart Association class, exercise
      capacity (6-min walk test), radionucleotide ventriculography for LV ejection
      fraction, two-dimensional echocardiography measurement of LV dimensions and
      diastolic filling and 24-h electrocardiograph monitoring to assess heart rate
      variability. RESULTS: Both carvedilol and metoprolol produced highly significant 
      improvement in symptoms (p < 0.001), exercise capacity (p < 0.05) and LV ejection
      fraction (p < 0.001), and there were no significant differences between the two
      drugs. Carvedilol had a significantly greater effect on sitting and standing
      blood pressure, LV end-diastolic dimension and normalized the mitral E wave
      deceleration time. CONCLUSIONS: Both metoprolol and carvedilol were equally
      effective in improving symptoms, quality of life, exercise capacity and LV
      ejection fraction, although carvedilol lowers blood pressure more than
      metoprolol.

TI  - Effect of metoprolol CR/XL in chronic heart failure: Metoprolol CR/XL Randomised 
      Intervention Trial in Congestive Heart Failure (MERIT-HF)
PG  - 2001-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Metoprolol can improve haemodynamics in chronic heart failure, but
      survival benefit has not been proven. We investigated whether metoprolol
      controlled release/extended release (CR/XL) once daily, in addition to standard
      therapy, would lower mortality in patients with decreased ejection fraction and
      symptoms of heart failure. METHODS: We enrolled 3991 patients with chronic heart 
      failure in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II-IV and with
      ejection fraction of 0.40 or less, stabilised with optimum standard therapy, in a
      double-blind randomised controlled study. Randomisation was preceded by a 2-week 
      single-blind placebo run-in period. 1990 patients were randomly assigned
      metoprolol CR/XL 12.5 mg (NYHA III-IV) or 25.0 mg once daily (NYHA II) and 2001
      were assigned placebo. The target dose was 200 mg once daily and doses were
      up-titrated over 8 weeks. Our primary endpoint was all-cause mortality, analysed 
      by intention to treat. FINDINGS: The study was stopped early on the
      recommendation of the independent safety committee. Mean follow-up time was 1
      year. All-cause mortality was lower in the metoprolol CR/XL group than in the
      placebo group (145 [7.2%, per patient-year of follow-up]) vs 217 deaths [11.0%], 
      relative risk 0.66 [95% CI 0.53-0.81]; p=0.00009 or adjusted for interim analyses
      p=0.0062). There were fewer sudden deaths in the metoprolol CR/XL group than in
      the placebo group (79 vs 132, 0.59 [0.45-0.78]; p=0.0002) and deaths from
      worsening heart failure (30 vs 58, 0.51 [0.33-0.79]; p=0.0023). INTERPRETATION:
      Metoprolol CR/XL once daily in addition to optimum standard therapy improved
      survival. The drug was well tolerated.

TI  - Prospective, randomized comparison of effect of long-term treatment with
      metoprolol or carvedilol on symptoms, exercise, ejection fraction, and oxidative 
      stress in heart failure.
PG  - 2645-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: With beta-blocker use becoming more prevalent in treating chronic
      heart failure (CHF), the choice of drugs raises important theoretical and
      practical questions. Although the second-generation compound metoprolol is
      beta1-selective, the third-generation compound carvedilol is beta-nonselective,
      with ancillary pharmacological properties including alpha-blockade and
      antioxidant effects. A prospective comparison of these 2 agents can address the
      issue of optimal adrenergic blockade in selecting agents for therapy in CHF.
      METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients with symptomatic stable heart failure
      were randomly assigned to receive either carvedilol or metoprolol in addition to 
      standard therapy for CHF. Measured variables included symptoms, exercise,
      ejection fraction, and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) as an
      indirect marker of free radical activity. Metoprolol and carvedilol were well
      tolerated, and both patient groups showed beneficial effects of beta-blocker
      therapy in each of the measured parameters, with no between-group differences.
      Ejection fraction increased over 6 months from 18+/-6.3% to 23+/-8.7% (P<0.005)
      with metoprolol and from 19+/-8.5% to 25+/-9.9% (P<0.0005) with carvedilol (P=NS 
      between groups). With metoprolol, TBARS values decreased from 4.7+/-0.9 nmol/mL
      at baseline to 4.2+/-1.5 nmol/mL at month 4 to 3.9+/-1.0 nmol/mL at month 6
      (P<0.0001). With carvedilol, there was a parallel decline from 4.7+/-1.4 to
      4.2+/-1.3 to 4.1+/-1.2 nmol/mL over the same time frame (P<0.025), with no
      between-group difference in these changes. CONCLUSIONS: Carvedilol and metoprolol
      showed parallel beneficial effects in the measured parameters over 6 months, with
      no relevant between-group differences in this heart failure population.

TI  - Beta-blocker effects on plasma lipids during prolonged treatment of hypertensive 
      patients with hypercholesterolemia.
PG  - 534-9
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the effects of long-term monotherapy with
      four different beta-blockers on plasma lipids in hypercholesterolemic
      hypertensive patients. We studied 152 subjects with essential hypertension
      [diastolic blood pressure (DBP) >90 mm Hg], total cholesterol (TC) >240 and <330 
      mg/dl, and triglycerides (TGs) <300 mg/dl. After a 4-week washout period with
      placebo, patients were randomized to receive propranolol, 160 mg/day (n = 37),
      atenolol, 100 mg/day (n = 38), bisoprolol, 10 mg/day (n = 39), or celiprolol, 400
      mg/day (n = 38), for 18 months. No cholesterol-reducing drug was allowed. Blood
      samples for evaluation of TC, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), HDL
      cholesterol (HDL-C), and TGs were taken before and after the placebo period and
      subsequently every 6 months. No beta-blocker worsened TC or LDL-C. Nonselective
      propranolol caused the most pronounced changes in HDL-C and TGs. Beta1-Selective 
      atenolol produced the same qualitative effects, but to a lesser extent. The more 
      beta1-selective bisoprolol did not affect HDL-C and TGs. Celiprolol significantly
      improved the lipid profile by significantly decreasing TC, LDL-C, and TGs, and
      increasing HDL-C. These findings suggest that in hypercholesterolemic
      hypertensive patients, (a) beta1-selective beta-blockers are likely to adversely 
      affect plasma lipids to a lesser extent than nonselective ones; and (b)
      celiprolol is able to improve the lipid pattern, which could be because of its
      peculiar ancillary properties.

TI  - Comparison of safety and efficacy of carvedilol and metoprolol in stable angina
      pectoris.
PG  - 643-9
AB  - In a double-blind, randomized, 3-month multicenter study, the safety and
      tolerability and the antianginal and anti-ischemic efficacy of carvedilol 25 to
      50 mg twice daily were assessed in comparison with metoprolol 50 to 100 mg twice 
      daily in younger and elderly patients with stable angina. After a 7-day placebo
      run-in at the end of which a symptom-limited bicycle ergometric exercise was
      performed, 368 patients were randomly allocated to the parallel treatment groups.
      After 4 weeks of therapy with a low dose, a further exercise test was performed
      and patients were titrated in single-blind fashion to the higher dose if the
      increase in total exercise time was < 1 minute, and there was no safety concern. 
      After a further 8 weeks of treatment a third exercise test was performed.
      Carvedilol low dose/high dose was shown to be at least as safe and well tolerated
      as metoprolol low dose/high dose both in younger and elderly patients. There were
      no hitherto unknown adverse events and no marked change in the types of events
      after increase of the doses. Early adverse events after treatment initiation or
      uptitration were equal with both medications, indicating no particular risk
      associated with carvedilol's vasodilatory action. No rebound phenomena were
      observed. Both drugs showed good antianginal and anti-ischemic efficacy, with
      marked increases on uptitration including patients > or = 65 years of age.
      However, in the doses selected, which appeared equipotent with respect to beta
      blockade, carvedilol's improvement of time to 1-mm ST-segment depression was
      statistically significantly greater than that of metoprolol. This could be due to
      its additional vasodilatory or antioxidative actions. Based on the safety and
      efficacy data of the present study, use of the higher of the 2 recommended doses 
      of carvedilol and metoprolol appears justified in younger and elderly patients
      without adequate therapeutic control at lower doses.

TI  - The Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study II (CIBIS-II): a randomised trial.
PG  - 9-13
AB  - BACKGROUND: In patients with heart failure, beta-blockade has improved morbidity 
      and left-ventricular function, but the impact on survival is uncertain. We
      investigated the efficacy of bisoprolol, a beta1 selective adrenoceptor blocker
      in decreasing all-cause mortality in chronic heart failure. METHODS: In a
      multicentre double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial in Europe, we
      enrolled 2647 symptomatic patients in New York Heart Association class III or IV,
      with left-ventricular ejection fraction of 35% or less receiving standard therapy
      with diuretics and inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme. We randomly
      assigned patients bisoprolol 1.25 mg (n=1327) or placebo (n=1320) daily, the drug
      being progressively increased to a maximum of 10 mg per day. Patients were
      followed up for a mean of 1.3 years. Analysis was by intention to treat.
      FINDINGS: CIBIS-II was stopped early, after the second interim analysis, because 
      bisoprolol showed a significant mortality benefit. All-cause mortality was
      significantly lower with bisoprolol than on placebo (156 [11.8%] vs 228 [17.3%]
      deaths with a hazard ratio of 0.66 (95% CI 0.54-0.81, p<0.0001). There were
      significantly fewer sudden deaths among patients on bisoprolol than in those on
      placebo (48 [3.6%] vs 83 [6.3%] deaths), with a hazard ratio of 0.56 (0.39-0.80, 
      p=0.0011). Treatment effects were independent of the severity or cause of heart
      failure. INTERPRETATION: Beta-blocker therapy had benefits for survival in stable
      heart-failure patients. Results should not, however, be extrapolated to patients 
      with severe class IV symptoms and recent instability because safety and efficacy 
      has not been established in these patients.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of carvedilol in severe heart failure. The U.S. Carvedilol
      Heart Failure Study Group.
PG  - 173-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many patients remain markedly symptomatic despite optimal current
      therapy for heart failure. Beta-blockers have often been viewed as
      contraindicated in this group because of their potential adverse short-term
      effects on cardiac function. METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred thirty-one patients
      with severe congestive heart failure were enrolled into a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study of the vasodilating beta-blocker carvedilol. All
      patients had symptomatic, advanced heart failure while on standard triple
      therapy, as evidenced by a mean ejection fraction of 0.22, marked reduction in
      distance traveled in a 6-minute corridor walk test, and severe impairment in
      quality of life measured by the Minnesota Living With Heart Failure
      Questionnaire. After a 2-week, open-label test of 6.25 mg twice daily carvedilol,
      105 patients were randomized (2:1) to receive either carvedilol (up to 25 mg
      twice daily, n = 70) or matching placebo (n = 35) for 6 months while background
      therapy with digoxin, diuretics, and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor
      remained constant. Ten patients (8%) did not complete the open-label period
      because of adverse events and 11.4% in both the carvedilol and placebo groups
      dropped out in the double-blind phase. The study was terminated early by the Data
      Safety and Monitoring Board and follow-up evaluation was therefore aborted before
      the projected number of patients and follow-up time was achieved. Quality of
      life, which was the primary endpoint, improved similarly in the carvedilol and
      placebo groups, whereas the global assessment by the physicians and the patient
      exhibited a better response to carvedilol (P < .05). Hospitalization and
      mortality rate were too low to evaluate a difference, and exercise time and New
      York Heart Association classification did not change significantly in response to
      the drug. Left ventricular ejection fraction rose significantly (+0.09) in the
      carvedilol group compared with the placebo group (+0.02, P = .004). CONCLUSION:
      The beta-blocker carvedilol can be safely employed in patients with severe heart 
      failure. Improved left ventricular function with a trend for some improvement in 
      symptoms combined with the experience with the drug in the larger population of
      less severe patients in this multicenter trial suggests that carvedilol may have 
      a favorable long-term effect in heart failure of diverse severity.

TI  - A comparison of divalproex with propranolol and placebo for the prophylaxis of
      migraine without aura.
PG  - 1141-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of divalproex sodium (Depakote) with that of
      propranolol hydrochloride (and placebo) for the prophylaxis of migraine without
      aura. DESIGN: Single-investigator, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled
      study with 5 phases: baseline (weeks 1-4); placebo (weeks 5-8); first treatment, 
      1 agent (weeks 9-20); washout (weeks 21-24); and second treatment, crossover to
      other agent (weeks 25-36). SETTING: Private practice of a general neurologist
      with a special interest in headache disorders. PATIENTS: Of 37 patients (30 women
      and 7 men) selected, 32 completed the study. All received placebo, after which
      half were randomized to receive divalproex or propranolol, then crossed over
      after washout. INTERVENTION: Divalproex and propranolol doses were titrated
      during the initial 8 weeks of each 12-week treatment cycle. For divalproex, doses
      were titrated to 1500 mg/d in 23 patients, to 2000 mg/d in 2, and downward in 7; 
      the mean valproate sodium trough level was 68.5 mg/L. Propranolol was titrated to
      180 mg/d in 28 patients, to 240 mg/d in 1, and downward in 3. RESULTS: Migraine
      frequency was reduced in 19% (6/ 32) of placebo-treated, 66% (21/32) of
      divalproex-treated, and 63% (20/32) of propranolol-treated patients. Assessment
      of migraine-days per month revealed significant response to placebo in 22% (7/32)
      of patients, to divalproex in 66% (21/32), and to propranolol in 69% (22/32).
      When results were limited to the third month of each active-agent treatment
      phase, 75% (24/ 32) of patients receiving divalproex and 78% (25/32) of those
      receiving propranolol had reduction in migraine frequency. CONCLUSION: No
      significant difference was identified between divalproex and propranolol for the 
      prophylaxis of migraine without aura.

TI  - Prophylactic treatment of migraine with bisoprolol: a placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 596-9
AB  - The objective of the present study was to assess the efficacy of bisoprolol in
      migraine prophylaxis. A double-blind placebo-controlled study was conducted in
      226 patients with migraine with or without aura, a migraine history of at least 2
      years at least 3 documented attacks during the 28 days run-in period. The
      duration of treatment was 12 weeks following an initial 28 days' run-in period.
      Patients reported the number of attacks and their severity in a diary. Treatment 
      with bisoprolol 5 mg resulted in a significant reduction in the frequency of
      migraine attacks (39% vs 22%) compared to placebo treatment (p < 0.05). Treatment
      had no effect on the duration and severity of the attacks. Bisoprolol was well
      tolerated.

TI  - Beneficial effects of intravenous and oral carvedilol treatment in acute
      myocardial infarction. A placebo-controlled, randomized trial.
PG  - 183-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence of efficacy and safety of beta-blockers after thrombolysis
      for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is equivocal. Newer beta-blockers such as
      carvedilol have not been tested in this setting. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study 
      investigated the effects of acute (intravenous) and long-term (6 months, oral)
      treatment with carvedilol versus placebo in 151 consecutive patients with AMI.
      Exercise ECG, ambulatory monitoring, and two-dimensional echocardiography were
      performed before hospital discharge and at 3 and 6 months. All patients were
      followed up and cardiovascular events recorded. The Cox proportional hazards
      model was used to compare time from randomization with the occurrence of a
      cardiovascular event, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were calculated.
      Carvedilol was found to be safe, and it significantly reduced cardiac events
      compared with placebo (18 on carvedilol and 31 on placebo, P < .02). Fifty-four
      patients had heart failure at study entry; 34 received carvedilol. There were no 
      adverse effects of carvedilol therapy and no excess events in this subgroup.
      Carvedilol produced significant reductions in heart rate (P < .0001), blood
      pressure (P < .005) at rest, and rate-pressure product at peak exercise (P <
      .003), but exercise capacity was unchanged. Left ventricular ejection fraction
      was not altered significantly by carvedilol, but stroke volume was higher at
      pre-hospital discharge examination (63 versus 53 mL; P < .01). Diastolic filling 
      of the left ventricle (E/A ratio) was also improved (1.2 versus 0.9; P < .001).
      In a subgroup with left ventricular ejection fraction < 45% (n = 49 patients; 24 
      on carvedilol and 25 on placebo), carvedilol showed attenuation of remodeling.
      CONCLUSIONS: Carvedilol was well tolerated and safe to use in patients
      immediately after AMI, including those with heart failure, and significantly
      improved outcome.

PG  - 138-42
AB  - Clinical research in chronic heart failure has recently focused on the stimulated
      neuro-hormonal compensatory mechanisms that could contribute to auto-aggravation 
      of the disease. On the basis of such a hypothesis, and apart from the inhibition 
      of the renin angiotensin system, the antagonism of beta-receptors has evolved as 
      a promising approach for improving quality of life and prognosis. However, the
      definite proof of beta-adrenoceptor blockade induced benefit on survival remains 
      to be demonstrated. On the basis of CIBIS I data, the objective of the Cardiac
      Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study II (CIBIS II) is to evaluate effects of the
      selective beta-1 adrenoceptor blocker, bisoprolol, on mortality (primary
      endpoint) in patients with ischaemic or non-ischaemic chronic heart failure.
      Eligible patients will be symptomatic ambulatory patients with left ventricular
      ejection fraction < or = 35% in NYHA functional class III or IV, receiving a
      background treatment of diuretics and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. A
      total of 2,500 patients are planned to be included with a mean follow up of at
      least 3 years. Secondary endpoints include hospitalisations, cardiovascular
      mortality and combination of both as well as permanent treatment withdrawal.
      Bisoprolol will be titrated up to 10 mg, starting with 1.25 mg daily.
      Randomization began in November 1995. CIBIS II results will represent a basis for
      definite conclusions on the evaluation of beta-adrenoceptor blockade induced
      benefit with bisoprolol in chronic heart failure.

TI  - Carvedilol produces dose-related improvements in left ventricular function and
      survival in subjects with chronic heart failure. MOCHA Investigators.
PG  - 2807-16
AB  - BACKGROUND: We conducted a multicenter, placebo-controlled trial designed to
      establish the efficacy and safety of carvedilol, a "third-generation" beta
      -blocking agent with vasodilator properties, in chronic heart failure. METHODS
      AND RESULTS: Three hundred forty-five subjects with mild to moderate, stable
      chronic heart failure were randomized to receive treatment with placebo, 6.25 mg 
      BID carvedilol (low-dose group), 12.5 mg BID carvedilol (medium-dose group), or
      25 mg BID carvedilol (high-dose group). After a 2- to 4-week up-titration period,
      subjects remained on study medication for a period of 6 months. The primary
      efficacy parameter was submaximal exercise measured by two different techniques, 
      the 6-minute corridor walk test and the 9-minute self-powered treadmill test.
      Carvedilol had no detectable effect on submaximal exercise as measured by either 
      technique. However, carvedilol was associated with dose-related improvements in
      LV function (by 5, 6, and 8 ejection fraction [EF] units in the low-, medium-,
      and high-dose carvedilol groups, respectively, compared with 2 EF units with
      placebo, P < .001 for linear dose response) and survival (respective crude
      mortality rates of 6.0%, 6.7%, and 1.1% with increasing doses of carvedilol
      compared with 15.5% in the placebo group, P < .001). When the three carvedilol
      groups were combined, the all-cause actuarial mortality risk was lowered by 73%
      in carvedilol-treated subjects (P < .001). Carvedilol also lowered the
      hospitalization rate (by 58% to 64%, P = .01) and was generally well tolerated.
      CONCLUSIONS: In subjects with mild to moderate heart failure from systolic
      dysfunction, carvedilol produced dose-related improvements in LV function and
      dose-related reductions in mortality and hospitalization rate.

TI  - Carvedilol inhibits clinical progression in patients with mild symptoms of heart 
      failure. US Carvedilol Heart Failure Study Group.
PG  - 2800-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: We tested the hypothesis that carvedilol inhibits clinical
      progression in patients with mildly symptomatic heart failure due to left
      ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients (n = 366)
      who had mildly symptomatic heart failure with an LV ejection fraction (LVEF) < or
      = 0.35, had minimal functional impairment (defined as the ability to walk 450 to 
      550 m on a 6-minute walk test), and were receiving optimal standard therapy,
      including ACE inhibitors, were randomized double-blind to carvedilol (n = 232) or
      placebo (n = 134) and followed up for 12 months. The primary end point was
      clinical progression, defined as death due to heart failure, hospitalization for 
      heart failure, or a sustained increase in heart failure medications. Clinical
      progression of heart failure occurred in 21% of placebo patients and 11% of
      carvedilol patients, reflecting a 48% (P = .008) reduction in the primary end
      point of heart failure progression (relative risk, 0.52; CI, 0.32 to 0.85). This 
      effect of carvedilol was not influenced by sex, age, race, cause of heart
      failure, or baseline LVEF. Carvedilol also significantly improved several
      secondary end points, including LVEF, heart failure score, NYHA functional class,
      and the physician and patient global assessments. Carvedilol reduced all-cause
      mortality but had no effects on the Minnesota Living With Heart Failure scale,
      the distance walked in 9 minutes on a self-powered treadmill, or cardiothoracic
      index. The drug was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Carvedilol, when added to
      standard therapy, including an ACE inhibitor, reduces clinical progression in
      patients who are only mildly symptomatic with well-compensated heart failure.

TI  - Double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the effects of carvedilol in patients
      with moderate to severe heart failure. The PRECISE Trial. Prospective Randomized 
      Evaluation of Carvedilol on Symptoms and Exercise.
PG  - 2793-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Carvedilol has improved the symptomatic status of patients with
      moderate to severe heart failure in single-center studies, but its clinical
      effects have not been evaluated in large, multicenter trials. METHODS AND
      RESULTS: We enrolled 278 patients with moderate to severe heart failure (6-minute
      walk distance, 150 to 450 m) and a left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 0.35
      at 31 centers. After an open-label, run-in period, each patient was randomly
      assigned (double-blind) to either placebo (n = 145) or carvedilol (n = 133;
      target dose, 25 to 50 mg BID) for 6 months, while background therapy with
      digoxin, diuretics, and an ACE inhibitor remained constant. Compared with
      placebo, patients in the carvedilol group had a greater frequency of symptomatic 
      improvement and lower risk of clinical deterioration, as evaluated by changes in 
      the NYHA functional class (P = .014) or by a global assessment of progress judged
      either by the patient (P = .002) or by the physician (P < .001). In addition,
      treatment with carvedilol was associated with a significant increase in ejection 
      fraction (P < .001) and a significant decrease in the combined risk of morbidity 
      and mortality (P = .029). In contrast, carvedilol therapy had little effect on
      indirect measures of patient benefit, including changes in exercise tolerance or 
      quality-of-life scores. The effects of the drug were similar in patients with
      ischemic heart disease or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy as the cause of heart
      failure. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that, in addition to its favorable 
      effects on survival, carvedilol produces important clinical benefits in patients 
      with moderate to severe heart failure treated with digoxin, diuretics, and an ACE
      inhibitor.

TI  - Cyclandelate in the prophylaxis of migraine: a randomized, parallel, double-blind
      study in comparison with placebo and propranolol. The Study group.
PG  - 441-7
AB  - Cyclandelate inhibits calcium-induced contraction of vascular smooth muscle
      cells, platelet aggregation induced by thrombin, platelet-activating-factor and
      adenosine, and also suppresses a provoked 5HT release from platelets. This
      pharmacological profile suggests that cyclandelate may have a potential
      prophylactic effect in migraine. To test this hypothesis, a double-blind
      multicentre study was performed in 214 patients to investigate the efficacy and
      tolerability of cyclandelate compared to placebo and propranolol. After a 4-week 
      baseline period, eligible patients (randomization 3:2:3) were treated for 12
      weeks with daily doses of 1.200 mg cyclandelate (n = 81), placebo (n = 55) or 120
      mg propranolol (n = 78). The number of migraine attacks (> or = 50% responders)
      and the migraine duration/month were compared based on the difference between
      baseline and the last 4 weeks of prophylactic treatment. The percentage of
      patients with a reduction in migraine attacks of > or = 50% treated with
      cyclandelate (37.0%) or propranolol (42.3%) was not significantly superior to
      placebo (30.9%; p > 0.025). The mean duration of migraine in hours (h) per month 
      decreased in both active treatment groups (cyclandelate: 36.8 h, p = 0.046;
      propranolol: 34.4 h, p = 0.039) compared to placebo (13.7 h) without reaching
      statistical significance (alpha/2 = 0.025). The clinical efficacy of cyclandelate
      and propranolol was comparable. Adverse experiences were reported by 13 patients 
      (16.0%) treated with cyclandelate, by 5 patients (9.1%) treated with placebo and 
      by 19 patients (24.4%) treated with propranolol. These were drug-related in 7.1% 
      (n = 6) of patients treated with cyclandelate and in 9% (n = 7) of patients
      treated with propranolol. In summary, cyclandelate has a comparable efficacy to
      that of propranolol, an established drug of first choice in the prophylaxis of
      migraine. Both drugs were better than placebo, but not significantly so. Both
      active treatments were well tolerated.

TI  - Effect of metoprolol on death and cardiac events during a 2-year period after
      coronary artery bypass grafting. The MACB Study Group.
PG  - 1825-32
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of long-term treatment with metoprolol after
      coronary bypass grafting on death and cardiac events. METHODS: Patients in
      western Sweden on whom coronary artery bypass grafting was performed between June
      1988 and June 1991 were evaluated for inclusion during the first 3 weeks after
      surgery. Major exclusion criteria were age > 75 years, concomitant valve surgery,
      traditional contraindications to beta-blockers and unwillingness to participate. 
      Patients were randomized in a double-blind fashion to 100 mg of
      metoprolol/placebo daily for 2 weeks and thereafter 200 mg daily for 2 years.
      RESULTS: Of 2365 patients who were operated on, 967 were randomized to either
      metoprolol (n = 480) or placebo (n = 487). Primary end points (death, non-fatal
      myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris, need for coronary artery bypass 
      grafting or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty), were reached by 42 patients
      in the metoprolol group (8.8%), as compared with 39 in the placebo group (8.0%)
      (P = 0.73). Of all the patients randomized to metoprolol, 34% withdrew from blind
      treatment prematurely compared with 44% for placebo (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION:
      Prophylactic treatment with metoprolol over a 2-year period after coronary artery
      bypass grafting did not reduce death or the development of cardiac events.
      However, the 95% confidence limits ranged from the possibility of a 30% reduction
      in events to a 68% increase in events if patients were treated with metoprolol as
      compared with placebo.

TI  - Metoprolol treatment for two years after coronary bypass grafting: effects on
      exercise capacity and signs of myocardial ischaemia.
PG  - 235-41
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether prophylactic treatment with metoprolol for two
      years after coronary artery bypass grafting improves working capacity and reduces
      the occurrence of myocardial ischaemia in patients with coronary artery disease. 
      METHODS: After coronary artery bypass grafting, patients were randomised to
      treatment with metoprolol or placebo for two years. Two years after
      randomisation, a computerised 12-lead electrocardiogram was obtained during a
      standardised bicycle exercise test in 618 patients (64% of all those randomised).
      RESULTS: The median exercise capacity was 140 W in the metoprolol group (n = 307)
      and 130 W in the placebo group (n = 311) (P > 0.20). An ST depression of > or = 1
      mm at maximum exercise was present in 34% of the patients in the metoprolol group
      and 38% in the placebo group (P > 0.20) and an ST depression of > or = 2 mm at
      maximum exercise was present in 11% in the metoprolol group and 16% in the
      placebo group (P = 0.09). The median values for maximum systolic blood pressure
      were 200 mm Hg in the metoprolol group and 210 mm Hg in the placebo group (P <
      0.0001), while the median values for maximum heart rate were 126 beats/min in the
      metoprolol group and 143 beats/min in the placebo group (P < 0.0001). The
      occurrence of cardiac and neurological clinical events two years postoperatively 
      among exercised patients was comparable in the treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS:
      Treatment with metoprolol for two years after coronary artery bypass grafting did
      not significantly change exercise capacity or electrocardiographic signs of
      myocardial ischaemia.

TI  - Effects of carvedilol, a vasodilator-beta-blocker, in patients with congestive
      heart failure due to ischemic heart disease. Australia-New Zealand Heart Failure 
      Research Collaborative Group.
PG  - 212-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: beta-Blocker therapy has been shown to increase ejection fraction in 
      patients with heart failure of idiopathic etiology. However, in patients with
      heart failure of ischemic etiology, the effects of this treatment on left
      ventricular function remain uncertain, as do the effects on exercise performance 
      and symptoms. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study investigated the effects of
      carvedilol, a beta-blocker with alpha 1-blocking properties, on left ventricular 
      size and function, maximal and submaximal exercise performance, and symptoms in
      415 patients with stable heart failure of ischemic etiology (ejection fraction < 
      45%). After a 2- to 3-week run-in phase on open-label low-dose carvedilol,
      patients were randomized to continued treatment with carvedilol (up to 25 mg BID)
      or to matching placebo. After 6 months, left ventricular ejection fraction
      measured by radionuclide ventriculography had increased by 5.2% (2P < .0001) in
      the carvedilol group compared with the placebo group, and left ventricular
      end-systolic and end-diastolic dimensions measured by two-dimensionally guided
      M-mode echocardiography had decreased by 2.6 mm (2P = .0005) and 1.3 mm (2P =
      .05), respectively. There were no significant changes in either treadmill
      exercise duration or 6-minute walk distance between carvedilol and placebo groups
      (both 2P > .1); in the carvedilol group, exercise performance was therefore
      maintained with a 23% lower rate-pressure product. Symptoms assessed by the New
      York Heart Association (NYHA) scale and the Specific Activity Scale (SAS) were
      unchanged in two thirds of patients in both groups, but there was a small excess 
      of patients whose symptoms worsened and a deficit of patients whose symptoms
      improved among those assigned carvedilol (NYHA, 2P = .05; SAS, 2P = .02).
      CONCLUSIONS: In patients with heart failure of ischemic etiology, 6-month
      treatment with carvedilol improved left ventricular function and maintained
      exercise performance at a lower rate-pressure product, but symptoms assessed by
      functional class were slightly worsened. A larger-scale trial is now required to 
      determine whether this treatment will reduce serious morbidity and mortality from
      heart failure.

TI  - Propranolol reduces mortality in patients with portal hypertension secondary to
      schistosomiasis.
PG  - 493-500
AB  - Although beta-adrenoceptor antagonists improve morbidity and mortality in
      patients with portal hypertension associated with cirrhosis, this has not been
      demonstrated in non-cirrhotic patients. In the present, double-blind, 24-month,
      prospective study of patients with endoscopically-proven varices and
      ultrasonographically-confirmed hepatic fibrosis, the effects of propranolol 160
      mg LA and placebo on the incidence of rebleeding and mortality were compared in
      82 patients with portal hypertension secondary to schistosomiasis. The results,
      analysed on intention-to-treat basis, indicated a reduction in rebleeding (median
      time to rebleeding 589 days for propanol v. 252 days for placebo; P < 0.02) and
      increased survival in the propranolol-treated patients (three deaths v. seven
      deaths on placebo; P < 0.02). Fifteen patients withdrew from the propranolol
      group and 18 from the placebo group. A positive prognostic indicator was a large 
      portal vein diameter whereas a small liver size indicated a negative outcome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Functional benefit in heart failure due to idiopathic dilated
      cardiomyopathy has been observed after beta-blockade, but improvement in survival
      has not been established in a large-scale randomized trial. This was the main

      placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study. Patients were in New York
      Heart Association functional class III (95%) or IV (5%) at inclusion. All
      received background diuretic and vasodilator therapy (an angiotensin-converting
      enzyme inhibitor in 90% of cases). A total of 320 patients was randomized to
      bisoprolol and 321 to placebo. Mean follow-up was 1.9 years. Bisoprolol was well 
      tolerated without between group difference in premature treatment withdrawals (82
      on placebo, 75 on bisoprolol; NS). The observed difference in mortality between
      groups did not reach statistical significance: 67 patients died on placebo, 53 on
      bisoprolol (P = .22; relative risk, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.56 to 1.15).
      No significant difference was observed in sudden death rate (17 on placebo, 15 on
      bisoprolol) or death related to documented ventricular tachycardia or
      fibrillation (7 on placebo, 4 on bisoprolol). Bisoprolol significantly improved
      the functional status of the patients; fewer patients in the bisoprolol group
      required hospitalization for cardiac decompensation (90 on placebo versus 61 on
      bisoprolol, P < .01), and more patients improved by at least one New York Heart
      Association functional class (48 on placebo versus 68 on bisoprolol, P = .04) by 
      the end of follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm previous trials
      evidence that a progressively increasing dose of beta-blocker in severe heart
      failure confers functional benefit. Subgroup analysis suggested that benefit from
      beta-blockade therapy was greater for those with nonischemic cardiomyopathy.
      However, improvement in survival while on beta-blockade remains to be
      demonstrated.

TI  - Effects of treatment on outcome in mildly symptomatic patients with ischemia
      during daily life. The Atenolol Silent Ischemia Study (ASIST)
PG  - 762-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Detection of asymptomatic ischemia in patients with coronary artery
      disease has been associated with increased risk for adverse outcome, but
      treatment of patients with asymptomatic ischemia remains controversial.
      Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to determine if treatment reduces
      adverse outcome in patients with daily life ischemia. METHODS AND RESULTS: A
      multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of asymptomatic
      or minimally symptomatic outpatients with daily life silent ischemia due to
      coronary artery disease was conducted. The primary outcome measure was event-free
      survival at 1 year by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Events were death, resuscitated
      ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for 
      unstable angina, aggravation of angina, or revascularization. The secondary
      outcome was ischemia during ambulatory ECG monitoring at 4 weeks. Three hundred
      six outpatients with mild or no angina (Canadian Cardiovascular Society class I
      or II), abnormal exercise tests, and ischemia on ambulatory monitoring were
      randomized to receive either atenolol (100 mg/d) or placebo. After 4 weeks of
      treatment, the number (mean +/- SD, 3.6 +/- 4.2 versus 1.7 +/- 4.6 episodes, P < 
      .001) and average duration (30 +/- 3.3 versus 16.4 +/- 6.7 minutes, P < .001) of 
      ischemic episodes per 48 hours of ambulatory monitoring decreased in atenolol-
      compared with placebo-assigned patients (4.4 +/- 4.6 to 3.1 +/- 6.0 episodes and 
      36.6 +/- 4.1 to 30 +/- 5.5 minutes). Event-free survival improved in
      atenolol-treated patients (P < .0066), who had an increased time to onset of
      first adverse event (120 versus 79 days) and fewer total first events compared
      with placebo (relative risk, 0.44; 95% confidence intervals, 0.26 to 0.75; P =
      .001). There was a nonsignificant trend for fewer serious events (death,
      resuscitation from ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation, nonfatal myocardial
      infarction, or hospitalization for unstable angina) in atenolol-treated patients 
      (relative risk, 0.55; 95% confidence intervals, 0.22 to 1.33; P = .175). The most
      powerful univariate and multivariate correlate of event-free survival was absence
      of ischemia on ambulatory monitoring at 4 weeks. Side effects were mild and
      generally similar comparing atenolol- and placebo-treated patients, although
      bradycardia was more frequent with atenolol. CONCLUSIONS: Atenolol treatment
      reduced daily life ischemia and was associated with reduced risk for adverse
      outcome in asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients compared with placebo.
