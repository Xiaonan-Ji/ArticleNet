TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of a novel estradiol vaginal ring for relief of
      menopausal symptoms.
PG  - 823-34
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy, tolerability, and acceptance of a vaginal ring
      delivering the equivalent of 50 or 100 microg per day of estradiol (E2), compared
      with placebo, for relief of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms and urogenital 
      symptoms in postmenopausal women. METHODS: Women with moderate to severe
      vasomotor symptoms (seven or more per day or 56 per week average) received 13
      weeks of treatment with a vaginal ring delivering 50 microg per day E2 (n = 113) 
      or 100 microg per day E2 (n = 112), or a placebo vaginal ring (n = 108). Severity
      of vasomotor symptoms was assessed by a daily diary card and the Greene
      Climacteric Scale. Urogenital signs and symptoms were evaluated via patient and
      physician assessment and vaginal cytology. Participant satisfaction with the
      vaginal ring was evaluated via questionnaire. RESULTS: Vasomotor symptoms
      significantly improved in both treatment groups, compared with placebo (P <.05). 
      There was a trend toward greater improvement in patient assessment of urogenital 
      signs with active rings compared with placebo. For women with vaginal atrophy at 
      baseline (n = 60), the maturation index improved significantly in both treatment 
      groups compared with placebo. Total Greene Climacteric Scale scores significantly
      improved for both E2 vaginal ring groups (P <.05) compared with placebo. The
      vaginal rings were well tolerated. Most adverse events were mild or moderate and 
      consistent with estrogen therapy. CONCLUSION: A novel vaginal ring delivering the
      equivalent of 50 or 100 microg per day of E2 significantly reduced the number and
      severity of vasomotor symptoms and improved urogenital symptoms, compared with
      placebo. The E2 vaginal ring was well tolerated.

TI  - Effects of estrogen plus progestin on risk of fracture and bone mineral density: 
      the Women's Health Initiative randomized trial.
PG  - 1729-38
AB  - CONTEXT: In the Women's Health Initiative trial of estrogen-plus-progestin
      therapy, women assigned to active treatment had fewer fractures. OBJECTIVE: To
      test the hypothesis that the relative risk reduction of estrogen plus progestin
      on fractures differs according to risk factors for fractures. DESIGN, SETTING,
      AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized controlled trial (September 1993-July 2002) in which
      16 608 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years with an intact uterus at baseline
      were recruited at 40 US clinical centers and followed up for an average of 5.6
      years. INTERVENTION: Women were randomly assigned to receive conjugated equine
      estrogen, 0.625 mg/d, plus medroxyprogesterone acetate, 2.5 mg/d, in 1 tablet (n 
      = 8506) or placebo (n = 8102). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All confirmed osteoporotic 
      fracture events that occurred from enrollment to discontinuation of the trial
      (July 7, 2002); bone mineral density (BMD), measured in a subset of women (n =
      1024) at baseline and years 1 and 3; and a global index, developed to summarize
      the balance of risks and benefits to test whether the risk-benefit profile
      differed across tertiles of fracture risk. RESULTS: Seven hundred thirty-three
      women (8.6%) in the estrogen-plus-progestin group and 896 women (11.1%) in the
      placebo group experienced a fracture (hazard ratio [HR], 0.76; 95% confidence
      interval [CI], 0.69-0.83). The effect did not differ in women stratified by age, 
      body mass index, smoking status, history of falls, personal and family history of
      fracture, total calcium intake, past use of hormone therapy, BMD, or summary
      fracture risk score. Total hip BMD increased 3.7% after 3 years of treatment with
      estrogen plus progestin compared with 0.14% in the placebo group (P<.001). The HR
      for the global index was similar across tertiles of the fracture risk scale
      (lowest fracture risk tertile, HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.93-1.58; middle tertile, HR,
      1.23; 95% CI, 1.04-1.46; highest tertile, HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.88-1.24) (P for
      interaction =.54). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that estrogen plus
      progestin increases BMD and reduces the risk of fracture in healthy
      postmenopausal women. The decreased risk of fracture attributed to estrogen plus 
      progestin appeared to be present in all subgroups of women examined. When
      considering the effects of hormone therapy on other important disease outcomes in
      a global model, there was no net benefit, even in women considered to be at high 
      risk of fracture.

TI  - Ultralow-dose micronized 17beta-estradiol and bone density and bone metabolism in
      older women: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 1042-8
AB  - CONTEXT: Estrogen therapy is known to prevent osteoporosis, but studies have
      shown that conventional doses increase adverse events. Whether lower doses, one
      quarter of standard treatment, prevent bone loss is not known. OBJECTIVE: To
      examine the effect of 3 years of treatment with 0.25 mg/d of micronized
      17beta-estradiol on bone mineral density (BMD) and bone turnover in healthy older
      postmenopausal women. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted from July 24, 1998, through June
      14, 2002, at a university general clinical research center in the United States. 
      Healthy, community-dwelling women (N = 167) who were older than 65 years at
      enrollment. INTERVENTION: Dosage of 0.25 mg/d of micronized 17beta-estradiol (n =
      83) or placebo (n = 84); all women who had not had a hysterectomy received 100
      mg/d of oral micronized progesterone for 2-week periods every 6 months. MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURES: The BMD of the hip, spine, wrist, and total body measured
      annually for 3 years. Serum and urine biochemical markers of bone resorption and 
      formation and sex hormones were measured at baseline, 3 months, and during years 
      1 and 3 of treatment. RESULTS: Mean BMD increased at all sites for participants
      taking low-dose estrogen (17beta-estradiol) compared with placebo (P<.001).
      Compared with participants receiving placebo, participants taking low-dose
      estrogen had BMD increases of 2.6% for the femoral neck; 3.6%, total hip; 2.8%,
      spine; and 1.2%, total body. Markers of bone turnover, N-telopeptides of type 1
      collagen, and bone alkaline phosphatase decreased significantly (P<.001) in
      participants taking low-dose estrogen compared with placebo. Estradiol, estrone, 
      and sex hormone-binding globulin levels increased in the estrogen-treated group
      compared with placebo. The adverse effect profile was similar; specifically,
      there were no statistically significant differences in breast tenderness, changes
      in endometrial thickness or pathological effects, or annual mammographic results 
      between the 2 groups. The number of abnormal mammograms over 3 years was 15 for
      the low-dose estrogen group and 10 for the placebo group (8 occurred at baseline)
      (P =.26). There were no reports of breast cancer during the study. CONCLUSIONS:
      In older women, a dosage of 0.25 mg/d of 17beta-estradiol increased bone density 
      of the hip, spine, and total body, and reduced bone turnover, with minimal
      adverse effects. Future studies evaluating the effect of low-dose estrogen on
      fractures are indicated.

TI  - Effect of combined oral estrogen/progestogen preparation (Kliogest) on bone
      mineral density, plasma lipids and postmenopausal symptoms in HRT-naive Thai
      women.
PG  - 857-66
AB  - BACKGROUND: Kliogest is commonly prescribed for the relief of acute
      postmenopausal symptoms and prevention of postmenopausal bone loss. However,
      there have been few data on its effect in Asian women. METHODS: This 1-year,
      single-center, randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled study evaluated
      the efficacy and safety of Kliogest in hormone replacement therapy (HRT)-naive
      Thai women. The subjects were 120 healthy Thai women aged between 45 and 65
      years, with intact uterus, and who had been amenorrheic for at least 1 year.
      RESULTS: Kliogest increased spine (+ 6%, p < 0.01) and hip (+2%, p < 0.01) bone
      mineral density (BMD), and lowered plasma total cholesterol (TC) (-16%, p < 0.05)
      and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (-16%, p < 0.05) concentrations. 
      However, Kliogest also resulted in a decrease in high density lipoprotein
      cholesterol (HDL-C) concentration (-18%, p < 0.05). Compared to placebo, the
      reduction in menopausal symptoms by Kliogest was not statistically significant.
      The frequency and severity of treatment-related uterine bleeding decreased with
      the duration of Kliogest treatment. Furthermore, there was a fairly strong
      relationship between the change in serum estrone concentration and the average
      monthly weighted bleeding scores over the first 6 months (Spearman's correlation 
      r = 0.54; p < 0.001), which became weaker over the entire treatment period
      (Spearman's correlation r = 0.27; p < 0.01). Although there was a small to
      moderate relationship between baseline estrone concentration and both lumbar (r =
      0.23, p < 0.02) and hip (r = 0.20, p < 0.05) BMD, there was no significant
      relationship between Kliogest-induced change in estrone concentration and change 
      in lumbar and hip BMD. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous treatment with Kliogest for 1 year
      reversed the potential postmenopausal bone loss in HRT-naive Thai postmenopausal 
      women. However, its effect on cardiovascular risk is uncertain. Furthermore,
      Kliogest is safe but appears to have no significant effect on climacteric
      symptoms in the patients in the present study.

TI  - Comparison of a novel vaginal ring delivering estradiol acetate versus oral
      estradiol for relief of vasomotor menopausal symptoms.
PG  - 118-27
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare a novel vaginal ring releasing estradiol acetate (Menoring;
      Galen Holdings) with oral estradiol for relief of moderate to severe vasomotor
      symptoms in healthy postmenopausal women. DESIGN: This was a prospective,
      double-blind, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group study. METHOD: Women (n =
      159) aged < 65 years experiencing >or= 20 hot flushes/night sweats per week
      received either a vaginal ring releasing estradiol acetate at a rate equivalent
      to 50 microg/day estradiol plus placebo tablets or oral estradiol 1 mg/day plus a
      placebo vaginal ring for 24 weeks. For patients with inadequate control of
      symptoms, the dosage was doubled at 12 weeks. A 24-week, open-label extension of 
      the vaginal ring treatment followed double-blind treatment. RESULTS: The
      frequency of hot flushes/night sweats was significantly reduced (p < 0.001) in
      both groups at 12 and 24 weeks from baseline, by 84% and 94% for the vaginal ring
      group and by 73% and 83% for the oral group, respectively. The mean intensity of 
      urogenital symptoms decreased from screening to the end of treatment in both
      groups. The incidence of adverse events was similar for both groups. No
      clinically relevant local effects of the vaginal ring were observed. CONCLUSIONS:
      The vaginal ring relieved both systemic and urogenital symptoms and was well
      tolerated and accepted. Overall, the efficacy, safety and acceptability of the
      vaginal ring were comparable with those of oral estradiol therapy.

TI  - Postmenopausal femur bone loss: effects of a low dose hormone replacement
      therapy.
PG  - 175-83
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Previous studies indicate that low-dose hormone replacement therapy
      (LD-HRT) can relieve vasomotor symptoms and prevent spine bone loss. METHODS: In 
      the present study, we evaluated the effects of a low dose of conjugated equine
      estrogens (CEE; 0.3 mg) associated with different progestins in continuous
      combined scheme [2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate (n=25), 5 mg
      dydrogesterone (n=27), 2.5 mg nomegestrol (n=11)] as single group, on femur bone 
      mineral density (BMD) and bone metabolism in young postmenopausal women (<or=56
      years). All women were supplemented with 1 g of calcium per day, and compared
      with women treated with 1 g of calcium per day alone (control group, n=15). There
      were no significant differences in age, body mass index (BMI), hormone values,
      bone metabolism markers and femur BMD in the treatment and control groups before 
      the study. RESULTS: In calcium-treated women serum plasma osteocalcin (BGP) and
      hydroxyproline/creatinine urinary excretion (OHP/Cr) remained stable during all
      the observation period. In this group, femoral neck, Ward's triangle and
      trochanter BMD showed a progressive and significant (P<0.05) decrease. In the
      LD-HRT group, a significant (P<0.05) decrease in serum BGP and OHP/Cr was
      observed. In these women, the values of these markers of bone turnover at 36
      months were significantly (P<0.01) different from those of calcium-treated women.
      During the LD-HRT administration, all BMD measures did not show any significant
      modifications. In these women, treated with LD-HRT the BMD values were
      significantly (P<0.05) different from those measured in calcium-treated women in 
      all the femur sites of measurements. In the control group, BMI significantly
      (P<0.05) increased from baseline value with a weight gain of 3%, while in the
      LD-HRT group, BMI did not change after 36 months of treatment and the 1.3% gain
      in body weight was not significant. LD-HRT was effective in reducing menopausal
      clinical symptoms and provided a favorable bleeding profile, and minimal side
      effects. CONCLUSION: LD-HRT was effective in reducing menopausal clinical
      symptoms and minimal and transient side effects were reported. In addition, the
      0.30 mg/day of CEE, in addition to a proper calcium supplementation, irrespective
      of the progestin used, can provide effective protection against activation of
      bone turnover and femur osteopenia.

TI  - Effect of low-dose transdermal E2/NETA on the reduction of postmenopausal bone
      loss in women.
PG  - 241-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of a continuous-combined transdermal patch
      (estradiol/ norethisterone acetate [E(2)/NETA] 25/125; Estragest TTS, Novartis,
      Basel, Switzerland) in the reduction of bone loss in postmenopausal women.
      DESIGN: In a 96-week, double-blind, randomized, multicenter, parallel study, 124 
      healthy women with an intact uterus more than 4 years after menopause received
      either transdermal continuous-combined E(2)/NETA (0.025/0.125 mg/day) or placebo 
      patch for 24 treatment cycles; diet was normalized for calcium intake. Lumbar
      spine bone mineral density (BMD) ranged from 0.969 to 0.805 g/cm2 with a mean
      annual BMD decrement ranging from 3% to 8% within the last 24 months. BMD at
      lumbar spine L(2)-L(4) (postero-anterior) and femur were assessed by dual energy 
      x-ray absorptiometry after 6, 12, and 24 cycles. Efficacy variables included
      measurement of biochemical markers of bone turnover (3, 6, 12, and 24 months).
      RESULTS: BMD at lumbar spine was significantly higher at all time points in the
      E(2)/NETA group than in the placebo group (P < 0.0001). Significant increases in 
      BMD (P < 0.0008) from baseline were observed at all sites after 24 months in the 
      E(2)/NETA group compared with placebo, which demonstrated a decrease from
      baseline. At endpoint, statistically significant decrements in the values of bone
      remodeling markers were observed (P < 0.05) with E(2)/NETA. CONCLUSIONS:
      E(2)/NETA 25/125 Estragest TTS was more effective than placebo in reducing the
      activation frequency of bone remodeling and in preventing bone loss at the spine 
      and hip. Effects on the hip were similar to those observed for higher doses of
      estrogen.

TI  - Effects of estrogen plus progestin on health-related quality of life.
PG  - 1839-54
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and other clinical trials
      indicate that significant health risks are associated with combination hormone
      use. Less is known about the effect of hormone therapy on health-related quality 
      of life. METHODS: The WHI randomly assigned 16,608 postmenopausal women 50 to 79 
      years of age (mean, 63) with an intact uterus at base line to estrogen plus
      progestin (0.625 mg of conjugated equine estrogen plus 2.5 mg of
      medroxyprogesterone acetate, in 8506 women) or placebo (in 8102 women).
      Quality-of-life measures were collected at base line and at one year in all women
      and at three years in a subgroup of 1511 women. RESULTS: Randomization to
      estrogen plus progestin resulted in no significant effects on general health,
      vitality, mental health, depressive symptoms, or sexual satisfaction. The use of 
      estrogen plus progestin was associated with a statistically significant but small
      and not clinically meaningful benefit in terms of sleep disturbance, physical
      functioning, and bodily pain after one year (the mean benefit in terms of sleep
      disturbance was 0.4 point on a 20-point scale, in terms of physical functioning
      0.8 point on a 100-point scale, and in terms of pain 1.9 points on a 100-point
      scale). At three years, there were no significant benefits in terms of any
      quality-of-life outcomes. Among women 50 to 54 years of age with
      moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms at base line, estrogen and progestin
      improved vasomotor symptoms and resulted in a small benefit in terms of sleep
      disturbance but no benefit in terms of the other quality-of-life outcomes.
      CONCLUSIONS: In this trial in postmenopausal women, estrogen plus progestin did
      not have a clinically meaningful effect on health-related quality of life.

TI  - Combined hormone replacement therapy and risk of breast cancer in a French cohort
      study of 3175 women.
PG  - 332-40
AB  - The largest-to-date randomized trial (Women's Health Initiative) comparing the
      effects of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and a placebo concluded that the
      continuous use of an oral combination of conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) and
      medroxy-progesterone acetate (MPA) increases the risk of breast cancer. This
      conclusion may not apply to women taking other estrogen and progestin
      formulations, as suggested by discrepancies in the findings of in vitro studies, 
      epidemiological surveys and, mostly, in vivo studies of human breast epithelial
      cell proliferation showing opposite effects of HRT combining CEE plus MPA or
      estradiol plus progesterone. To evaluate the risk of breast cancer associated
      with the use of the latter combination, commonly prescribed in France, a cohort
      including 3175 postmenopausal women was followed for a mean of 8.9 years (28 367 
      woman-years). In total, 1739 (55%) of these women were users of one type of
      estrogen replacement with systemic effect during at least 12 months, any time
      after the menopause, and were classified as HRT users. Among them, 83% were
      receiving exclusively or mostly a combination of a transdermal estradiol gel and 
      a progestin other than MPA. Some 105 cases of breast cancer occurred during the
      follow-up period, corresponding to a mean of 37 new cases per 10 000 women/year. 
      Using multivariate analysis adjusted for the calendar period of treatment, date
      of birth and age at menopause, we were unable to detect an increase in the
      relative risk (RR) of breast cancer (RR 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI):
      0.65-1.5) in the HRT users. The RR of breast cancer per year of use of HRT was
      1.005 (95% CI 0.97-1.05). These results do not justify early interruption of such
      a type of HRT, which is beneficial for quality of life, prevention of bone loss
      and cardiovascular risk profile, without the activation of coagulation and
      inflammatory protein synthesis measured in users of oral estrogens.

TI  - Effects of low-dose, continuous combined estradiol and noretisterone acetate on
      menopausal quality of life in early postmenopausal women.
PG  - 157-63
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the effects of low dose hormonal replacement therapy
      (LD-HRT) on quality of life in early postmenopausal women, since the
      postmenopausal estrogen deprivation in mid age women often brings along a series 
      of changes and symptoms, which may greatly affect quality of life. METHODS: Fifty
      normal postmenopausal women were recruited and randomly treated with LD-HRT,
      17beta-estradiol (1 mg/day) and norethisterone acetate (0.5 mg/day) (LD-HRT) or
      calcium supplement (controls). No significant differences in age, age at
      menopause, the presence of chronic diseases and socio-economic status were
      present in the two groups. The Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ), a validated
      quality-of-life instrument for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women, was
      administered at baseline and after 6 and 12 weeks of treatment in both groups.
      RESULTS: At baseline no significant differences in WHQ scores were present in the
      two groups. In the control group the scores in all different areas showed no
      significant modification either after 6 and 12 weeks of observation. Conversely, 
      the LD-HRT group showed a significant decrease in the scores of vasomotor
      symptoms, somatic symptoms, anxiety/fear, depressed mood and sleep problem items.
      No effects on memory/concentration and menstrual symptoms areas were evident.
      CONCLUSION: Although quality of life is also and may be mainly influenced by
      socio-economic and cultural factors, LD-HRT definitively can improve not only
      vasomotor symptoms, but also more general aspects of physical and psychological
      well-being of symptomatic postmenopausal women.

TI  - Clinical assessment and quality of life of postmenopausal women treated with a
      new intermittent progestogen combination hormone replacement therapy: a
      placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 29-36
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a
      constant-estrogen, intermittent-progestogen hormone replacement regimen
      (Ortho-Prefest, Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical, Raritan, NJ, USA) on menopausal
      symptoms measured by the Kupperman Index and on quality of life measured by the
      Menopause Quality of Life-Intervention questionnaire. DESIGN: This was a
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study of 90 days'
      duration. Nonhysterectomized, postmenopausal women with vasomotor symptoms and at
      least 6 months' amenorrhea were eligible. On completion of the placebo-controlled
      portion of the study, participants could elect to receive active treatment for an
      additional 90 days. RESULTS: The study enrolled 119 participants, 59 and 60 in
      the Prefest and placebo groups, respectively. A marked reduction of menopausal
      symptoms, as measured by the Kupperman Index, was observed in the active
      treatment group compared with the placebo group after 45 days' treatment (mean
      reduction, 14.8 v 7.2 points, respectively), which was sustained to day 90 (16.8 
      v 7.8 points; < 0.001). Similarly, greater improvement in quality of life, as
      measured by the Menopause Quality of Life summary score, was also observed in the
      active treatment group for the same period (improvement of up to 1.6 points v 0.7
      points; < 0.001). The adverse event profile was unremarkable. Of the 114
      participants who received the active treatment, 6 withdrew because of adverse
      events. CONCLUSIONS: The constant-estrogen, intermittent-progestogen regimen was 
      highly effective in relieving menopausal symptoms and in improving quality of
      life and was well received by the study participants.

PG  - 343-53
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the lowest effective dose of an estradiol (E )
      matrix-type transdermal delivery system (EMTDS; Alora) for preventing bone loss
      in postmenopausal women. DESIGN: This double-blind, double-dummy, randomized,

      EMTDS (0.025, 0.05, or 0.075 mg/day) or placebo administered twice weekly. Lumbar
      bone mineral density (LBMD) was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at
      screening and after 1 and 2 years of treatment. Safety was assessed at regularly 
      scheduled visits. RESULTS: EMTDS provided statistically significant and
      clinically meaningful changes in LBMD relative to placebo. At 2 years, LBMD
      declined from baseline by 0.59% in the placebo group, but it increased from
      baseline by 1.65% ( = 0.0065), 4.08% ( = 0.0001), and 4.82% ( = 0.0001) in the
      EMTDS 0.025, 0.05, and 0.075 mg/day groups, respectively. The corresponding
      responder rates (defined as no change or increase in LBMD at endpoint) were 39.7%
      for placebo, 59.6%, 79.3%, and 83.9% in the EMTDS 0.025, 0.05, and 0.075 mg/day
      groups, respectively. Mean serum E concentrations were proportional to the dose
      of the E transdermal system and did not accumulate over the course of the study. 
      Adverse events were generally comparable across treatment groups, with the
      majority being mild or moderate in severity and unrelated to study medication.
      Mammogram findings and other safety assessments were also comparable across
      groups and did not reveal any safety concerns with 2-y transdermal E treatment.
      CONCLUSIONS: The EMTDS (Alora) administered twice weekly improves lumbar bone
      mineral density in healthy postmenopausal women, with the benefit of treatment
      evident by 1 year. The lowest effective dose is 0.025 mg/day.

TI  - Risks and benefits of estrogen plus progestin in healthy postmenopausal women:
      principal results From the Women's Health Initiative randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 321-33
AB  - CONTEXT: Despite decades of accumulated observational evidence, the balance of
      risks and benefits for hormone use in healthy postmenopausal women remains
      uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To assess the major health benefits and risks of the most
      commonly used combined hormone preparation in the United States. DESIGN: Estrogen
      plus progestin component of the Women's Health Initiative, a randomized
      controlled primary prevention trial (planned duration, 8.5 years) in which 16608 
      postmenopausal women aged 50-79 years with an intact uterus at baseline were
      recruited by 40 US clinical centers in 1993-1998. INTERVENTIONS: Participants
      received conjugated equine estrogens, 0.625 mg/d, plus medroxyprogesterone
      acetate, 2.5 mg/d, in 1 tablet (n = 8506) or placebo (n = 8102). MAIN OUTCOMES
      MEASURES: The primary outcome was coronary heart disease (CHD) (nonfatal
      myocardial infarction and CHD death), with invasive breast cancer as the primary 
      adverse outcome. A global index summarizing the balance of risks and benefits
      included the 2 primary outcomes plus stroke, pulmonary embolism (PE), endometrial
      cancer, colorectal cancer, hip fracture, and death due to other causes. RESULTS: 
      On May 31, 2002, after a mean of 5.2 years of follow-up, the data and safety
      monitoring board recommended stopping the trial of estrogen plus progestin vs
      placebo because the test statistic for invasive breast cancer exceeded the
      stopping boundary for this adverse effect and the global index statistic
      supported risks exceeding benefits. This report includes data on the major
      clinical outcomes through April 30, 2002. Estimated hazard ratios (HRs) (nominal 
      95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were as follows: CHD, 1.29 (1.02-1.63) with 286
      cases; breast cancer, 1.26 (1.00-1.59) with 290 cases; stroke, 1.41 (1.07-1.85)
      with 212 cases; PE, 2.13 (1.39-3.25) with 101 cases; colorectal cancer, 0.63
      (0.43-0.92) with 112 cases; endometrial cancer, 0.83 (0.47-1.47) with 47 cases;
      hip fracture, 0.66 (0.45-0.98) with 106 cases; and death due to other causes,
      0.92 (0.74-1.14) with 331 cases. Corresponding HRs (nominal 95% CIs) for
      composite outcomes were 1.22 (1.09-1.36) for total cardiovascular disease
      (arterial and venous disease), 1.03 (0.90-1.17) for total cancer, 0.76
      (0.69-0.85) for combined fractures, 0.98 (0.82-1.18) for total mortality, and
      1.15 (1.03-1.28) for the global index. Absolute excess risks per 10 000
      person-years attributable to estrogen plus progestin were 7 more CHD events, 8
      more strokes, 8 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers, while absolute risk
      reductions per 10 000 person-years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer
      hip fractures. The absolute excess risk of events included in the global index
      was 19 per 10 000 person-years. CONCLUSIONS: Overall health risks exceeded
      benefits from use of combined estrogen plus progestin for an average 5.2-year
      follow-up among healthy postmenopausal US women. All-cause mortality was not
      affected during the trial. The risk-benefit profile found in this trial is not
      consistent with the requirements for a viable intervention for primary prevention
      of chronic diseases, and the results indicate that this regimen should not be
      initiated or continued for primary prevention of CHD.

TI  - Menopausal hormone replacement therapy and risk of ovarian cancer.
PG  - 334-41
AB  - CONTEXT: The association between menopausal hormone replacement therapy and
      ovarian cancer is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether hormone replacement
      therapy using estrogen only, estrogen-progestin only, or both estrogen only and
      estrogen-progestin increases ovarian cancer risk. DESIGN: A 1979-1998 cohort
      study of former participants in the Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration
      Project, a nationwide breast cancer screening program. SETTING: Twenty-nine US
      clinical centers. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 44 241 postmenopausal women (mean age 
      at start of follow-up, 56.6 years). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incident ovarian
      cancer. RESULTS: We identified 329 women who developed ovarian cancer during
      follow-up. In time-dependent analyses adjusted for age, menopause type, and oral 
      contraceptive use, ever use of estrogen only was significantly associated with
      ovarian cancer (rate ratio [RR], 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-2.0).
      Increasing duration of estrogen-only use was significantly associated with
      ovarian cancer: RRs for 10 to 19 years and 20 or more years were 1.8 (95% CI,
      1.1-3.0) and 3.2 (95% CI, 1.7-5.7), respectively (P value for trend <.001), and
      we observed a 7% (95% CI, 2%-13%) increase in RR per year of use. We observed
      significantly elevated RRs with increasing duration of estrogen-only use across
      all strata of other ovarian cancer risk factors, including women with
      hysterectomy. The RR for estrogen-progestin use after prior estrogen-only use was
      1.5 (95% CI, 0.91-2.4), but the RR for estrogen-progestin-only use was 1.1 (95%
      CI, 0.64-1.7). The RRs for less than 2 years and 2 or more years of
      estrogen-progestin-only use were 1.6 (95% CI, 0.78-3.3) and 0.80 (95% CI,
      0.35-1.8), respectively, and there was no evidence of a duration response (P
      value for trend =.30). CONCLUSION: Women who used estrogen-only replacement
      therapy, particularly for 10 or more years, were at significantly increased risk 
      of ovarian cancer in this study. Women who used short-term
      estrogen-progestin-only replacement therapy were not at increased risk, but risk 
      associated with short-term and longer-term estrogen-progestin replacement therapy
      warrants further investigation.

TI  - Change in bone mass distribution induced by hormone replacement therapy and
      high-impact physical exercise in post-menopausal women.
PG  - 126-35
AB  - The purpose of this intervention trial was to determine whether changes in bone
      mass distribution could be observed in postmenopausal women following hormone
      replacement therapy (HRT) and/or high-impact physical exercise. Eighty healthy
      women, aged 50-57 years, at <5 years after the onset of menopause and with no
      previous use of HRT, were randomly assigned to one of four groups: HRT; exercise 
      (Ex); HRT + Ex (ExHRT); and control (Co). HRT administration was conducted in a
      double-blind manner for 1 year using estradiol plus noretisterone acetate
      (Kliogest). The exercise groups participated in a 1 year progressive training
      program consisting of jumping and bounding activities. Subjects participated in
      two supervised sessions per week and were asked to perform a series of exercises 
      at home 4 days/week. Bone measurements using a quantitative computed tomography
      scanner (Somatom DR, Siemens) were obtained from the proximal femur, midfemur,
      proximal tibia, and tibial shaft. Data were analyzed with a software program
      (BONALYSE 1.3) calculating density (g/cm(3)), cross-sectional area (CSA; mm(2)), 
      and moments of inertia (I(max), I(min), I(polar)). In addition, the bone mass
      spectrum was determined as a function of the angular distribution around the bone
      mass center (polar distribution) and the distance from the bone mass center
      through the diaphyseal wall (radial distribution). After the 1 year period, there
      was an overall interaction of group x time in bone mineral density (BMD) at the
      proximal femur (p = 0.05) and tibial shaft (p = 0.035). Women in the ExHRT and
      HRT groups had increased proximal femur and tibial shaft BMD when compared with
      the change observed in the Co group (p = 0.024-0.011). The change was more
      pronounced in the cortical tibia, wherein the ExHRT group also differed from the 
      Ex group (p = 0.038). No significant changes were found in bone CSA at any of the
      measured sites. The radial distribution indicated an increase of BMD in the
      endocortical part of the measured sites in the HRT and ExHRT groups and in the
      proximal tibia in the Ex group. The polar distribution showed that bone mass was 
      redistributed in the anteroposterior direction. The changes in I(max), I(min),
      and I(polar) in the HRT and ExHRT groups differed from those in the Co group at
      the proximal femur, midfemur, and proximal tibia (p = 0.047-0.001). The Ex group 
      also differed from the Co group in I(max) and I(polar) at the proximal tibia (p =
      0.018 and 0.039, respectively). These results support the idea that HRT acts
      primarily at the bone-marrow interface. The exercise intervention chosen for this
      study contributed to the maintenance of bone mass. Our results suggest that both 
      HRT and exercise have local effects on bone mass. The change in bone mass
      distribution induced by HRT and exercise may play an important role in the
      alteration of bone strength.

TI  - Noncardiovascular disease outcomes during 6.8 years of hormone therapy: Heart and
      Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study follow-up (HERS II).
PG  - 58-66
AB  - CONTEXT: The Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study (HERS) was a
      randomized trial of estrogen plus progestin therapy after menopause. OBJECTIVE:
      To examine the effect of long-term postmenopausal hormone therapy on common
      noncardiovascular disease outcomes. DESIGN AND SETTING: Randomized, blinded,
      placebo-controlled trial of 4.1 years' duration (HERS) and subsequent open-label 
      observational follow-up for 2.7 years (HERS II), carried out between 1993 and
      2000 in outpatient and community settings at 20 US clinical centers.
      PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2763 postmenopausal women with coronary disease and
      average age of 67 years at enrollment in HERS; 2321 women (93% of those
      surviving) consented to follow-up in HERS II. INTERVENTION: Participants were
      randomly assigned to receive 0.625 mg/d of conjugated estrogens plus 2.5 mg of
      medroxyprogesterone acetate (n = 1380) or placebo (n = 1383) during HERS;
      open-label hormone therapy was prescribed at personal physicians' discretion
      during HERS II. The proportions with at least 80% adherence to hormones declined 
      from 81% (year 1) to 45% (year 6) in the hormone group and increased from 0%
      (year 1) to 8% (year 6) in the placebo group. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
      Thromboembolic events, biliary tract surgery, cancer, fracture, and total
      mortality. RESULTS: Comparing women assigned to hormone therapy with those
      assigned to placebo, the unadjusted intention-to-treat relative hazard (RH) for
      venous thromboembolism declined from 2.66 (95% confidence interval [CI],
      1.41-5.04) during HERS to 1.40 (95% CI, 0.64-3.05) during HERS II (P for time
      trend =.08); it was 2.08 overall for the 6.8 years (95% CI, 1.28-3.40), and 3 of 
      the 73 women with thromboembolism died within 30 days due to pulmonary embolism. 
      The overall RH for biliary tract surgery was 1.48 (95% CI, 1.12-1.95); for any
      cancer, 1.19 (95% CI, 0.95-1.50); and for any fracture, 1.04 (95% CI, 0.87-1.25).
      There were 261 deaths among those assigned to hormone therapy and 239 among those
      assigned to placebo (RH, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.92-1.31). Adjusted and as-treated
      analyses did not alter our conclusions. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment for 6.8 years with
      estrogen plus progestin in older women with coronary disease increased the rates 
      of venous thromboembolism and biliary tract surgery. Trends in other disease
      outcomes were not favorable and should be assessed in larger trials and in
      broader populations.

TI  - Cardiovascular disease outcomes during 6.8 years of hormone therapy: Heart and
      Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study follow-up (HERS II).
PG  - 49-57
AB  - CONTEXT: The Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study (HERS) found no
      overall reduction in risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) events among
      postmenopausal women with CHD. However, in the hormone group, findings did
      suggest a higher risk of CHD events during the first year, and a decreased risk
      during years 3 to 5. OBJECTIVE: To determine if the risk reduction observed in
      the later years of HERS persisted and resulted in an overall reduced risk of CHD 
      events with additional years of follow-up. DESIGN AND SETTING: Randomized,
      blinded, placebo-controlled trial of 4.1 years' duration (HERS) and subsequent
      unblinded follow-up for 2.7 years (HERS II) conducted at outpatient and community
      settings at 20 US clinical centers. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2763 postmenopausal 
      women with CHD and average age of 67 years at enrollment in HERS; 2321 women (93%
      of those surviving) consented to follow-up in HERS II. INTERVENTION: Participants
      were randomly assigned to receive 0.625 mg/d of conjugated estrogens and 2.5 mg
      of medroxyprogesterone acetate (n = 1380), or placebo (n = 1383) during HERS;
      open-label hormone therapy was prescribed at personal physicians' discretion
      during HERS II. The proportions with at least 80% adherence to hormones declined 
      from 81% (year 1) to 45% (year 6) in the hormone group, and increased from 0%
      (year 1) to 8% (year 6) in the placebo group. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary 
      outcome was nonfatal myocardial infarction and CHD death. Secondary
      cardiovascular events were coronary revascularization, hospitalization for
      unstable angina or congestive heart failure, nonfatal ventricular arrhythmia,
      sudden death, stroke or transient ischemic attack, and peripheral arterial
      disease. RESULTS: There were no significant decreases in rates of primary CHD
      events or secondary cardiovascular events among women assigned to the hormone
      group compared with the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, or overall. The
      unadjusted relative hazard (RH) for CHD events in HERS was 0.99 (95% confidence
      interval [CI], 0.81-1.22); HERS II, 1.00 (95% CI, 0.77-1.29); and overall, 0.99
      (0.84-1.17). The overall RHs were similar after adjustment for potential
      confounders and differential use of statins between treatment groups (RH, 0.97;
      95% CI, 0.82-1.14), and in analyses restricted to women who were adherent to
      randomized treatment assignment (RH, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.77-1.19). CONCLUSIONS: Lower
      rates of CHD events among women in the hormone group in the final years of HERS
      did not persist during additional years of follow-up. After 6.8 years, hormone
      therapy did not reduce risk of cardiovascular events in women with CHD.
      Postmenopausal hormone therapy should not be used to reduce risk for CHD events
      in women with CHD.

TI  - Alveolar and postcranial bone density in postmenopausal women receiving
      hormone/estrogen replacement therapy: a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 1409-15
AB  - BACKGROUND: We conducted a 3-year, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled
      study to determine whether the positive effects of hormone/estrogen replacement
      therapy (H/ERT) on postcranial bone density are accompanied by similar positive
      effects on oral bone mass. METHODS: A total of 135 postmenopausal women (aged
      41-70 years) with no evidence of moderate or severe periodontal disease were
      randomized to receive daily oral conjugated estrogen (Premarin; 0.625 mg) alone
      or in combination with medroxyprogesterone acetate (Prempro; 0.625 and 2.5 mg,
      respectively) or placebo. All subjects received calcium carbonate (1000 mg/d) and
      cholecalciferol (400 [corrected] IU/d) supplements. The primary efficacy end
      points were the changes in alveolar crest height and alveolar bone density.
      Alveolar crest height was measured on bite-wing radiographs, and changes in
      alveolar bone mass were assessed by means of digital-subtraction radiography.
      Postcranial bone density was measured in the lumbar spine and left proximal femur
      by means of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: Hormone/estrogen
      replacement therapy significantly increased alveolar bone mass compared with
      placebo (+1.84% vs +0.95% [P =.04]), and tended to improve alveolar crest height 
      (+4.83% vs +3.46% [P =.34]). Bone mineral density of the proximal femur
      significantly increased in the H/ERT compared with the placebo group (total
      proximal femur, +3.59% vs +0.22% [P =.001]; neck, +2.05% vs -0.34% [P =.02];
      trochanter, +3.49% vs +0.08% [P<.001]), but not the lumbar spine (+1.01% vs
      +0.17% [P =.39]). Changes in alveolar bone mass correlated with bone density
      changes in the total femur (r = 0.28 [P =.02]) and femoral trochanter (r = 0.25
      [P =.04]) in the H/ERT but not in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Postcranial and
      oral bone mass were increased in postmenopausal women receiving H/ERT.
      Improvement in oral bone health constitutes an additional benefit of H/ERT.

TI  - Effect of lower doses of conjugated equine estrogens with and without
      medroxyprogesterone acetate on bone in early postmenopausal women.
PG  - 2668-76
AB  - CONTEXT: Lower-than-commonly-prescribed doses of conjugated equine estrogens
      (CEEs) with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) improve vasomotor symptoms and
      vaginal atrophy, provide acceptable bleeding and lipid profiles, and afford
      endometrial protection. This lower-dose therapy's protection against loss of bone
      mineral density (BMD) associated with menopause has not been thoroughly
      investigated. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of lower doses of CEEs only or 
      CEEs-MPA on spine and hip BMD, total body bone mineral content (BMC), and
      biochemical markers of bone turnover in postmenopausal women. DESIGN AND SETTING:
      Two-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled substudy of the Women's
      Health, Osteoporosis, Progestin, Estrogen trial, conducted at 19 US centers
      between August 1995 and October 2000. PARTICIPANTS: Eight hundred twenty-two
      healthy postmenopausal women aged 40 to 65 years who were within 4 years of their
      last menstrual period. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive 
      CEEs, 0.625; CEEs, 0.625 and MPA, 2.5; CEEs, 0.45; CEEs, 0.45 and MPA, 2.5; CEEs,
      0.45 and MPA, 1.5; CEEs, 0.3; CEEs 0.3 and MPA, 1.5 (all doses in mg/d); or
      placebo for 2 years. All participants also received elemental calcium at 600
      mg/d. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes from baseline in spine and total hip BMD,
      total body BMC, and biochemical markers of bone turnover (serum osteocalcin and
      urinary cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen), assessed at 6-month
      intervals and compared among treatment groups with a modified intention-to-treat 
      approach. RESULTS: At 24 months, women assigned to all of the active treatment
      groups had significant gains from baseline (P<.001) in spine and hip BMD and
      total body BMC (except total body BMC in the group receiving CEEs, 0.3 mg/d).
      These changes were significantly different from those in the placebo group, in
      which losses of bone mass in spine and total body were evident over the course of
      the study (P<.001). The loss in hip BMD from baseline in the placebo group was
      significant at 18 (P =.02) but not at 24 months (P =.06). Osteocalcin and
      N-telopeptides of type I collagen were significantly reduced from baseline
      (P<.001) for all active treatment groups at all time points; no changes were
      found for the placebo group. For women treated with CEEs alone, the gains in
      spine BMD for the group taking CEEs, 0.625 mg/d, were significantly higher than
      those of the group taking CEEs, 0.3 mg/d (P =.02), but not the group treated with
      CEEs, 0.45 mg/d (P =.48). CONCLUSIONS: Doses of CEEs or CEEs-MPA lower than 0.625
      mg/d effectively increase BMD and BMC in early postmenopausal women.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of a continuous once-a-week 17beta-estradiol/levonorgestrel
      transdermal system and its effects on vasomotor symptoms and endometrial safety
      in postmenopausal women: the results of two multicenter, double-blind,
      randomized, controlled trials.
PG  - 195-207
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Two prospective multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled
      trials were conducted to examine the safety and efficacy of three once-a-week
      continuous combined 17beta-estradiol/levonorgestrel (E2/LNG) transdermal systems 
      (E2 0.045 mg/day with 0.015, 0.030, and 0.040 mg/day LNG) for the treatment of
      vasomotor symptoms and prevention of estrogen-induced endometrial hyperplasia in 
      healthy, postmenopausal women. DESIGN: In study 1, performed in 293
      hysterectomized and nonhysterectomized women with moderate to severe hot flushes,
      transdermal E2/LNG (E2 0.045 mg/day with 0.030 and 0.040 mg/day LNG) was compared
      with placebo for three 28-day treatment cycles. The frequency and severity of hot
      flushes were recorded daily. In study 2, performed in 845 women with intact
      uteri, transdermal E2/LNG (E2 0.045 mg/day with 0.015, 0.030, and 0.040 mg/day
      LNG) was compared with transdermal E2 0.045 mg/day monotherapy for thirteen
      28-day treatment cycles. Women with endometrial tissue sufficient for evaluation 
      underwent endometrial biopsy assessment at the end of cycle 13. Bleeding patterns
      were assessed throughout the study, and the Women's Health Questionnaire was used
      to assess well-being. RESULTS: In study 1, transdermal E2/LNG (E2 0.045 mg/day
      with 0.030 and 0.040 mg/day LNG) significantly decreased the number and severity 
      of hot flushes when compared with placebo. Symptom relief was seen as early as 2 
      weeks posttreatment. Similarly, in study 2, all three doses of transdermal E2/LNG
      and E2 controlled hot flushes with no differences between groups. In study 2, no 
      women receiving transdermal E2/LNG developed endometrial hyperplasia compared
      with 19 (12.8%) who received transdermal E2 0.045 mg/day (p < 0.001 for each
      dose). Significant improvements from baseline in scores on the Women's Health
      Questionnaire for vasomotor symptoms, sleep problems, sexual function, cognitive 
      difficulties, and total score were noted at all or most time points with both
      transdermal E2/LNG and E2. Application-site reactions, vaginal hemorrhage, and
      breast pain were the most common adverse events reported with transdermal E2/LNG.
      The proportion of women with amenorrhea increased over time in all treatment
      groups in study 2. CONCLUSIONS: All three doses of this once-a-week combined
      E2/LNG transdermal system rapidly and effectively control vasomotor symptoms in
      postmenopausal women while protecting against endometrial hyperplasia.
      Amelioration of vasomotor symptoms also is accompanied by improvements in aspects
      of subjective well-being. Once-a-week transdermal E2/LNG, therefore, offers an
      effective and convenient formulation, the dosing of which can be individualized

TI  - Effects of period-free hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women in
      Taiwan.
PG  - 23-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: To compare the effects of continuous combined hormone replacement
      therapy (Kliogest) and placebo on climacteric symptoms, bone turnover markers,
      serum lipid profiles and the safety of Kliogest. METHODS: This is a 4-month,
      single-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study. Fifty-six healthy
      volunteer women with intact uterus, between six months and three years after a
      natural menopause, were recruited and randomised into two groups to have blood
      and urine laboratory test for assessment of bone resorption marker of
      deoxypyridinoline, bone formation marker of bone specific alkaline phosphatase,
      lipid profile including total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, low-density 
      lipoprotein and triglyceride, and menopausal symptoms. Information was taken at
      initial visit and 1, 2 and final follow-up after taking medication. RESULTS:
      Continuous Kliogest treatment resulted in significant reduction in menopausal
      symptoms, as scored by Integrated Greene Climacteric Scale and in the
      psychological, somatic and vasomotor subscales scores (p = 0.009). Kliogest
      reversed the negative trends in lipoprotein profiles by lowering total
      cholesterol (p < 0.001), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p < 0.001), and
      triglyceride (p = 0.004), but decreasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p 
      = 0.002). A significant reduction in bone resorption marker, deoxypyridinoline,
      was also observed in the Kliogest group (p < 0.001). There was no report of
      serious adverse events, endometrial hyperplasia or cancer in the Kliogest treated
      patients. CONCLUSIONS: Four-month treatment with Kliogest resulted in an
      improvement in menopausal symptoms and lipid profiles as well as reduction in
      bone loss.

TI  - Effect of 1 year of discontinuation of raloxifene or estrogen therapy on bone
      mineral density after 5 years of treatment in healthy postmenopausal women.
PG  - 599-603
AB  - The beneficial effects of hormone replacement therapy (HRT), selective estrogen
      receptor modulators (SERMs), or bisphosphonates in the prevention and treatment
      of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women have been well established. However,
      little is known about the effects of discontinuation of treatment on bone mineral
      density. We investigated the effect of 1 year of discontinuation of the SERM
      raloxifene (Ral; 60 mg and 150 mg), conjugated equine estrogen (CEE; 0.625 mg),
      and placebo after 5 years of treatment in a double-blind, randomized study.
      Thirty-eight of 59 healthy and hysterectomized postmenopausal women (mean age 55 
      years) completed the treatment and 1 year follow-up period. Lumbar spine and
      femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD) were performed with dual-energy X-ray
      absorptiometry, before, during, and at the end of treatment, as well as after 1
      year of discontinuation of therapy. One year of discontinuation significantly
      reduced the mean lumbar spine BMD in the raloxifene- and estrogen-treated women
      (p < 0.05), whereas mean femoral neck BMD was reduced significantly only in women
      treated with 60 mg Ral (p < 0.05). The mean percentage change (+/-SD) in lumbar
      spine BMD was: CEE, -6.2% (+/-3.7%); Ral 60 mg, -2.4% (+/-2.4%); Ral 150 mg,
      -2.6% (+/-3.1%); and placebo, -1.6% (+/-4.3%). Our results show that 5 years of
      treatment with either Ral or CEE did not protect against bone loss after 1 year
      of withdrawal of therapy, and that the rate of bone loss was not significantly
      different from that of placebo-treated women.

      conjugated equine estrogen therapy in relieving menopausal symptoms. Alora Study 
      Group.
PG  - 29-36
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of two strengths of an estradiol matrix
      transdermal delivery system with daily oral doses of conjugated equine estrogens 
      in reducing the frequency of moderate-to-severe hot flushes in postmenopausal
      women. DESIGN: The design of the study provided for the following treatment
      regimens: an estradiol transdermal delivery system (Alora 0.05 or 0.1 mg/day)
      administered twice weekly or oral doses of conjugated equine estrogens (CEE 0.625
      or 1.25 mg) administered daily were given to 321 highly symptomatic
      postmenopausal women for 12 weeks following a randomized, parallel-group,
      double-blind, double-dummy design. RESULTS: Results indicate no statistically
      significant differences at any time point in mean frequency or mean percentage
      reduction in frequency of moderate-to-severe hot flushes between patients given
      Alora 0.1 mg/day and those receiving CEE 1.25 mg/day. Similarly, no significant
      differences were observed at any time in mean frequency of moderate-to-severe hot
      flushes between the Alora 0.05 mg/day and CEE 0.625 mg/day groups, although the
      group receiving CEE 0.625 mg/day exhibited a statistically greater percentage
      reduction than the Alora 0.05 mg/day group at weeks 3, 4 and 8. By week 12, these
      two treatments were statistically indistinguishable. There were no serious or
      unexpected adverse events with the two transdermal systems and local skin
      tolerability was excellent. Other estrogenic effects such as restoration of
      vaginal cytology, breast tenderness and unexpected vaginal bleeding were
      comparable between transdermal and oral administration groups except for a lower 
      incidence of bleeding in those women receiving the lower dose transdermal
      regimen.

TI  - Bone mass response to discontinuation of long-term hormone replacement therapy:
      results from the Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin Interventions (PEPI) Safety
      Follow-up Study.
PG  - 665-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accelerated bone loss after stopping hormone therapy (HRT) is
      postulated to explain the lack of hip-fracture protection conferred by former HRT
      use. The abbreviation HRT (traditionally standing for "hormone replacement
      therapy") is used herein because of its wide recognition in the field. However,
      the pharmacological doses of estrogens and progestins used are not truly
      "replacement" in nature. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether women lose bone mineral
      density (BMD) after stopping HRT; to assess whether their rate of loss is
      significantly greater than that of women not undergoing HRT; and to determine
      whether long-term HRT is associated with continued gains in BMD. METHODS: A total
      of 495 women who were adherent to assigned treatment in the 3-year Postmenopausal
      Estrogen/Progestin Interventions randomized controlled trial (PEPI-RCT) and who
      had an additional BMD measurement during the PEPI Safety Follow-up Study were
      observed for an average of 3 years during and 4 years after the PEPI-RCT.
      RESULTS: Women who stopped HRT after 1 year during the PEPI-RCT had annual rates 
      of BMD change of -0.54% (hip) and -0.81% (spine) during the following 2 years.
      Those who underwent HRT for 3 years during the PEPI-RCT and then discontinued it 
      had annual changes of -1.01% (hip) and -1.04% (spine). Rates of BMD loss among
      women who stopped HRT during or after the PEPI-RCT did not differ significantly
      from those of women who did not undergo HRT, who lost bone at a rate of
      approximately 1% yearly during the first year of the PEPI-RCT and about half that
      rate afterward. Women who continued HRT after the PEPI-RCT did not show
      additional BMD gains. CONCLUSIONS: Our results do not support the hypothesis that
      bone is lost at an unusually fast rate after discontinuation of HRT, nor do they 
      suggest that longer-term HRT leads to additional BMD gain beyond that evident
      after 3 years.

      menopausal symptoms and quality of life in postmenopausal women.
PG  - 176-82
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the impact of low-dose unopposed esterified estrogens on
      menopausal symptoms and quality of life. METHODS: In a long-term, 2-year,
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 204 postmenopausal women were
      treated with esterified estrogens 0.3 mg daily or placebo. Menopausal symptoms
      were assessed with a modified Kupperman index at baseline, 3, 6 and thereafter
      every 6 months. In a second 12-week, open-label, short-term pilot study, 25
      postmenopausal women with moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms were treated with
      esterified estrogens 0.3 mg daily for 12 weeks. Vasomotor symptoms and quality of
      life were assessed using the Greene scale and Quality of Life Menopause Scale
      (QUALMS). RESULTS: In the long-term study, significant (p < 0.05) reductions in
      total symptom scores were observed at each time point with esterified estrogens
      compared with placebo. Somatic symptom scores (hot flushes, night sweats, vaginal
      dryness) decreased significantly (p < 0.01) in patients treated with esterified
      estrogens 0.3 mg compared to baseline and placebo. In the short-term, open-label 
      pilot study, the incidence of vasomotor symptoms was significantly (p < 0.01)
      reduced with esterified estrogens 0.3 mg from week 4 until the study end.
      Significant (p < 0.05) improvements versus baseline were seen in the somatic and 
      vasomotor/sleep domains and in the total quality-of-life score. CONCLUSIONS:
      Esterified estrogens 0.3 mg given daily provide adequate menopausal symptom
      relief and improved quality of life in postmenopausal women.

TI  - Effects of transdermal estradiol delivered by a matrix patch on bone density in
      hysterectomized, postmenopausal women: a 2-year placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 176-83
AB  - This 2-year, double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was designed to 
      evaluate the safety and efficacy in preventing bone loss in postmenopausal women 
      of two doses of transdermal 17betaestradiol (estradiol) delivered by a matrix
      patch, compared with placebo. One hundred and sixty healthy, hysterectomized
      postmenopausal volunteers aged 40-60 years with serum estradiol levels < 20 pg/ml
      were started on treatment at four centers in The Netherlands. Every 6 months,
      bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)
      at the lumbar spine, non-dominant wrist and left hip, and markers of bone
      turnover were assessed in urine and serum. The treatment arms were: estradiol,
      100 microg/day (E-100, n = 53), oestradiol, 50 microg/day (E-50, n = 54), placebo
      (P-100, placebo to E-100, n = 27 or P-50, placebo to E-50, n = 26). Treatment was
      continued for up to 2 years. After 24 months, BMD of the lumbar spine in the
      E-100 group differed by 7.7% [5.8-9.5%] (mean [95% confidence interval]) from the
      placebo group and showed a mean (s.e.m.) increase in BMD from baseline of 5.9%
      (0.69%). For the E-50 group the difference compared with placebo was 6.2%
      [4.4-8.0%] and the absolute increase was 4.5% (0.62%); in the placebo group, the 
      absolute change was -2.3% (0.48%). In the total wrist, the changes were: E-100:
      difference compared with placebo 2.5% [1.5 3.6%], absolute increase 0.6% (0.3%); 
      E-50: difference compared with placebo 2.9% [1.8-3.9%], absolute increase 0.7%
      (0.25%); and absolute change on placebo: -2.5% (0.35%). In the total hip, the
      changes were: E-100: difference compared with placebo 3.7% [2.2-5.2%], absolute
      increase 2.8% (0.5%); E-50: difference compared with placebo: 3.2% [1,8-4.7%],
      absolute change 2.4% (0.36%); and absolute change on placebo -1.4% (0.66%). Three
      markers of bone turnover--serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, serum
      osteocalcin and urinary CTX--fell significantly during the trial. Breast pain was
      reported by 8% of women on placebo, by 6% of women on E-50 and by 17% of women on
      E-100. Estradiol delivered by the E-50 matrix patch effectively reversed bone
      loss in hysterectomized postmenopausal women with few side-effects. The marginal 
      additional gain in BMD with the higher dose may be offset by a more important
      side effect profile.

TI  - Do combinations of 1 mg estradiol and low doses of NETA effectively control
      menopausal symptoms?
PG  - 219-28
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study compared two continuous-combined hormone replacement
      therapy (HRT) formulations, 1 mg estradiol (E2)/0.25 mg norethisterone acetate
      (NETA) and 1 mg E2/0.5 mg NETA, with placebo, with regard to the efficacy for
      vasomotor symptom relief in menopausal women. METHODS: A total of 119 women aged 
      45-61 years with moderate and severe hot flushes and with amenorrhea for at least
      3 months were randomly assigned to 12 weeks' treatment with 1 mg E2/0.25 mg NETA,
      1 mg E2/0.5 mg NETA or placebo. The number and severity of hot flushes, as well
      as any vaginal bleeding, were recorded on a daily basis. The Kupperman Menopausal
      Index, Greene Climacteric Scale and visual analog scales for various symptoms
      were assessed before and after treatment. Subpopulation analysis according to
      menopausal status was performed. RESULTS: Both combinations significantly reduced
      the number and severity of hot flushes, compared to placebo. A reduction of
      approximately 85% in vasomotor symptomatology occurred in the two combination
      groups by week 4 of treatment, and this was further diminished throughout the
      study to approximately 97% reduction by week 12. At the end of the study, 85% of 
      the women receiving 1 mg E2/0.5 mg NETA and 71% of the women receiving 1 mg
      E2/0.25 mg NETA were considered to the clinically adequate responders to
      treatment. Both combinations were associated with significant improvements,
      compared to placebo, in visual analog scales for overall general condition,
      Kupperman Menopausal Index, and Greene Climacteric vasomotor and psychological
      subscales. While both combinations resulted in similar bleeding profiles in
      postmenopausal women, the combination of 1 mg E2/0.5 mg NETA resulted in the
      lowest incidence of bleeding in late perimenopausal women. CONCLUSIONS: The
      combinations of 1 mg E2/0.25 mg NETA and 1 mg E2/0.5 mg NETA rapidly relieve
      vasomotor symptoms and are efficacious in the majority of menopausal women,
      including those with severe hot flushes.

TI  - Hormonal treatment and psychological function during the menopausal transition:
      an evaluation of the effects of conjugated estrogens/cyclic medroxyprogesterone
      acetate.
PG  - 55-62
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of hormone treatment on psychosocial
      distress of women during the menopausal transition (aged 40-52 years, still
      menstruating and with minor symptoms), in a study carefully designed to reduce
      bias and placebo effect. METHODS: The study was randomized, controlled by
      placebo, blinded to the subject, investigators and biostatistician, crossed-over 
      after 6 months, and evaluated by a 77-item questionnaire every month for 12
      months. The medication tested was continuous conjugated estrogens (Premarin) and 
      cyclic medroxyprogesterone acetate (Provera). RESULTS: Of an eligible 105
      apparently healthy women, recruited by advertisement, 83 completed the
      questionnaires for the study. Randomization was successful. While there was a
      substantial variation over time in the change of scores for all the psychosocial 
      outcomes, there was no significant difference between active and placebo
      treatment when order of treatment allocation was ignored. However, a strong and
      consistent effect of the order of treatment allocation for many of the scores was
      found; in particular, the effect of active treatment was substantially stronger
      when it was administered second. Positive effects of active treatment were found 
      for the score for the overall symptom rating test (p < 0.009) and its components 
      of depression and feeling of inadequacy (p = 0.011; p = 0.001, respectively).
      CONCLUSIONS: The use of hormones, given as a continuous estrogen and cyclic
      progestogen formulation after a formal calibration/run-in period, may have a
      beneficial effect on psychosocial distress experienced by women towards the end
      of their reproductive function.

TI  - Efficacy of a new 7-day transdermal sequential estradiol/levonorgestrel patch in 
      women.
PG  - 231-42
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and tolerability of a new 7-day
      transdermal sequential estradiol/levonorgestrel patch (Fem7 Combi; Merck KGaA;
      Germany), versus placebo, as hormone replacement therapy in menopausal women.
      METHODS: A multicentre, randomized, clinical study consisting of a 3-week
      screening phase, a 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment phase, and 
      a 12-week open, follow-up phase. Women aged 40-65 years with an intact uterus and
      menopausal complaints were randomized to either 2 weeks of an estradiol mono
      patch (50 microg per 24 h) followed by 2 weeks of an estradiol/levonorgestrel
      combination patch (50 microg/10 microg per 24 h), or a placebo patch, for three
      28-day cycles. Changes in the Kupperman Index and the frequency of hot flushes
      were assessed. RESULTS: The sequential use of a 7-day estradiol patch and a 7-day
      estradiol/levonorgestrel patch was superior to placebo in reducing menopausal
      symptoms, and was well tolerated. At the end of the treatment phase, there was a 
      statistically significant reduction in the Kupperman Index score versus placebo
      (P<0.0001), and a statistically significant difference between groups in the
      proportion of patients with a reduction in the number of hot flushes (at least
      50% versus baseline). During the open follow-up phase, there was a marked
      reduction in the Kupperman Index score and the number of hot flushes for patients
      switched from placebo to active study medication. The active medication was
      effective throughout the 1-week application period. CONCLUSIONS: The new 7-day
      transdermal sequential estradiol/levonorgestrel patch was well tolerated,
      providing rapid and effective relief of menopausal symptoms. The addition of
      low-dose levonorgestrel did not influence the beneficial effects of estradiol.

TI  - Quality-of-life and depressive symptoms in postmenopausal women after receiving
      hormone therapy: results from the Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study 
      (HERS) trial.
PG  - 591-7
AB  - CONTEXT: Postmenopausal hormone therapy is commonly used by women for disease
      prevention, but its effects on quality of life have not been well documented.
      OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect on quality of life of estrogen plus progestin 
      therapy used as secondary prevention in women with coronary artery disease.
      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2763 postmenopausal women with
      documented coronary artery disease (mean age, 67 years) in the Heart and
      Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study, a randomized, placebo-controlled,
      double-blind trial conducted from January 1993 to July 1998 at outpatient and
      community settings at 20 US clinical centers. INTERVENTION: Participants were
      randomly assigned to receive either 0.625 mg/d of conjugated equine estrogen plus
      2.5 mg/d of medroxyprogesterone acetate (n = 1380) or placebo (n = 1383) for 36
      months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Physical activity, measured by the Duke Activity
      Status Index; energy/fatigue and mental health, measured by RAND scales; and
      depressive symptoms, measured on the Burnam screening scale, at 3 years of
      follow-up. RESULTS: In all patients, scores declined significantly over 3 years
      for physical function (-3.8; P<.001), mental health (-0.6; P =.05), and
      energy/fatigue (-3.8; P<.001), but depressive symptoms were not significantly
      changed (P =.20). The effect of hormone therapy on these measures depended on the
      presence (n = 434) or absence (n = 2325) of flushing at study entry. Women with
      flushing who were assigned to hormone therapy had improved mental health (+2.6 vs
      - 0.5; P =.04) and fewer depressive symptoms (-0.5 vs + 0.007; P =.01) over
      follow-up compared with those assigned to placebo. Women without flushing who
      were assigned to hormone therapy had greater declines in physical function (-4.2 
      vs -3.3; P =.04) and energy/fatigue (-4.6 vs -3.1; P =.03) over follow-up.
      Quality-of-life scores were significantly lower among patients with older age,
      diabetes, hypertension, chest pain, or heart failure. These differences in
      quality of life among women classified by clinical characteristics were much
      greater than the effects of hormone therapy. CONCLUSION: Hormone therapy has
      mixed effects on quality of life among older women. The effects of hormone
      therapy depend on the presence of menopausal symptoms; women without flushing had
      greater declines in physical measures, while women with flushing had improvements
      in emotional measures of quality of life.

TI  - Bone mineral density response to estrogen replacement in frail elderly women: a
      randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 815-20
AB  - CONTEXT: Although hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is an established approach
      for osteoporosis prevention, little is known about the osteoprotective effects of
      HRT in frail elderly women. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether HRT increases bone
      mineral density (BMD) in frail elderly women. DESIGN AND SETTING: Randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in a US university-based
      research center from September 1995 to August 2000. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-seven
      women aged 75 years or older with mild-to-moderate physical frailty.
      INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly assigned to receive conjugated
      estrogens, 0.625 mg/d, plus trimonthly medroxyprogesterone acetate, 5 mg/d for 13
      days (n = 45), or matching placebo (n = 22), for 9 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
      The primary outcome measure was 9-month change in BMD of the lumbar spine and
      hip, measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Secondary outcomes were
      changes in markers of bone turnover. RESULTS: Based on intention-to-treat
      analyses, HRT resulted in significantly larger increases in BMD of the lumbar
      spine than placebo (mean change, 4.3% vs 0.4%; between-group difference, 3.9%;
      95% confidence interval [CI], 3.5%-4.3%) and total hip (mean change, 1.7% vs
      -0.1%; between-group difference, 1.8%; 95% CI, 1.5%-2.1%). Compared with placebo,
      HRT resulted in significant decreases in serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase
      levels (mean change, -24% vs 6%; between-group difference, -30%; 95% CI, -26% to 
      -33%) and urine N-telopeptide levels (mean change, -48% vs 4%; between-group
      difference, -52%; 95% CI, -47% to -55%). CONCLUSIONS: In physically frail elderly
      women, 9 months of HRT significantly increased BMD compared with placebo in
      clinically important skeletal regions. Further studies are needed to determine
      whether these osteogenic effects of HRT in elderly women are associated with a
      reduction in osteoporotic fractures.

TI  - Efficacy of estradiol for the treatment of depressive disorders in perimenopausal
      women: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 529-34
AB  - BACKGROUND: Results of previous studies suggest that estrogen improves somatic
      and mild depressive symptoms experienced by perimenopausal women. This study
      investigated the efficacy of 17beta-estradiol for the treatment of clinically
      significant depressive disorders in endocrinologically confirmed perimenopausal
      women. METHODS: Perimenopausal women (aged 40-55 years, with irregular menstrual 
      periods and serum concentrations of follicle-stimulating hormone >25 IU/L),
      meeting criteria for major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder, or minor
      depressive disorder, according to DSM-IV, were randomized to receive transdermal 
      patches of 17beta-estradiol (100 microgram) or placebo in a 12-week,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study. A 4-week washout period followed the
      12-week treatment phase. Outcome measures were the Montgomery-Asberg Depression
      Rating Scale and Blatt-Kupperman Menopausal Index scores. RESULTS: Fifty women
      were enrolled in the study; 26 met DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder,
      11 for dysthymic disorder, and 13 for minor depressive disorder. Remission of
      depression was observed in 17 (68%) women treated with 17beta-estradiol compared 
      with 5 (20%) in the placebo group (P =.001). Subjects responded similarly to
      estradiol treatment, regardless of DSM-IV diagnosis. Patients treated with
      estradiol sustained antidepressant benefit of treatment after the 4-week washout 
      period, although somatic complaints increased in frequency and intensity.
      Treatment was well tolerated and adverse events were rare in both groups.
      CONCLUSION: Transdermal estradiol replacement is an effective treatment of
      depression for perimenopausal women.

TI  - The prevention of osteoporosis using sequential low-dose hormone replacement
      therapy with estradiol-17 beta and dydrogesterone.
PG  - 251-8
AB  - Low-dose hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in postmenopausal women may produce
      fewer side-effects but its efficacy in the prevention of bone loss and
      osteoporosis is not established. To address this we compared the effect of 1 mg
      estradiol-17 beta with a 2 mg dose, in combination with cyclical dydrogesterone, 
      in the prevention of postmenopausal bone loss. We conducted a multicenter
      double-masked prospective randomized, placebo-controlled study in 595 apparently 
      healthy postmenopausal women randomized to either placebo, or continuous oral
      estradiol-17 beta 1 mg or 2 mg with sequential dydrogesterone for 2 years. The
      primary endpoint was the percentage change from baseline in bone mineral density 
      (BMD) in the lumbar spine (LS) and femoral neck (FN) of actively treated groups
      compared with placebo. Women taking either 1 mg or 2 mg estradiol-17 beta showed 
      a significant increase in BMD of the LS (mean +/- SD, 5.2 +/- 3.8% and 6.7 +/-
      4.0% respectively, both p < 0.001) whilst BMD in the placebo group decreased
      (-1.9 +/- 4.0%). Increases were also observed in FN BMD in both treated groups
      (2.7 +/- 4.2% and 2.5 +/- 5.2% respectively, both p < 0.001) in contrast to the
      placebo group (-1.8 +/- 4.8%). The oldest women showed the greatest treatment
      response. One milligram estradiol-17 beta in combination with dydrogesterone is
      effective in conserving LS and proximal femur bone mass, both of which are
      clinically important sites of osteoporotic fracture, and is as effective as 2 mg 
      in preventing FN bone. The lower dose of estradiol-17 beta is a particularly
      suitable treatment for osteoporosis management in older women since it should
      minimize side-effects and improve the acceptability of HRT.

TI  - Estrogen replacement therapy and ovarian cancer mortality in a large prospective 
      study of US women.
PG  - 1460-5
AB  - CONTEXT: Postmenopausal estrogen use is associated with increased risk of
      endometrial and breast cancer, 2 hormone-related cancers. The effect of
      postmenopausal estrogen use on ovarian cancer is not established. OBJECTIVES: To 
      examine the association between postmenopausal estrogen use and ovarian cancer
      mortality and to determine whether the association differs according to duration 
      and recency of use. DESIGN AND SETTING: The American Cancer Society's Cancer
      Prevention Study II, a prospective US cohort study with mortality follow-up from 
      1982 to 1996. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 211 581 postmenopausal women who completed
      a baseline questionnaire in 1982 and had no history of cancer, hysterectomy, or
      ovarian surgery at enrollment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Ovarian cancer mortality,
      compared among never users, users at baseline, and former users as well as by
      total years of use of estrogen replacement therapy (ERT). RESULTS: A total of 944
      ovarian cancer deaths were recorded in 14 years of follow-up. Women who were
      using ERT at baseline had higher death rates from ovarian cancer than never users
      (rate ratio [RR], 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-1.96). Risk was
      slightly but not significantly increased among former estrogen users (RR, 1.16;
      95% CI, 0.99-1.37). Duration of use was associated with increased risk in both
      baseline and former users. Baseline users with 10 or more years of use had an RR 
      of 2.20 (95% CI, 1.53-3.17), while former users with 10 or more years of use had 
      an RR of 1.59 (95% CI, 1.13-2.25). Annual age-adjusted ovarian cancer death rates
      per 100 000 women were 64.4 for baseline users with 10 or more years of use, 38.3
      for former users with 10 or more years of use, and 26.4 for never users. Among
      former users with 10 or more years of use, risk decreased with time since last
      use reported at study entry (RR for last use <15 years ago, 2.05; 95% CI,
      1.29-3.25; RR for last use >/=15 years ago, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.79-2.17).
      CONCLUSIONS: In this population, postmenopausal estrogen use for 10 or more years
      was associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer mortality that persisted up 
      to 29 years after cessation of use.

TI  - Postmenopausal hormones and incontinence: the Heart and Estrogen/Progestin
      Replacement Study.
PG  - 116-20
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether postmenopausal hormone therapy improves the
      severity of urinary incontinence. METHODS: We included measures of incontinence
      and voiding frequency in the Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study, a
      randomized, blinded trial of the effect of hormone therapy among 2763
      postmenopausal women younger than 80 years with coronary disease and intact
      uteri. This report includes 1525 participants who reported at least one episode
      of incontinence per week at baseline. Participants were randomly assigned to
      0.625 mg of conjugated estrogens plus 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate in
      one tablet daily (n = 768) or placebo (n = 757) and were followed for a mean of
      4.1 years. Severity of incontinence was classified as improved (decrease of at
      least two episodes per week), unchanged (change of at most one episode per week),
      or worsened (increase of at least two episodes per week). RESULTS: Incontinence
      improved in 26% of the women assigned to placebo compared with 21% assigned to
      hormones, while 27% of the placebo group worsened compared with 39% of the
      hormone group (P =.001). This difference was evident by 4 months of treatment and
      was observed for both urge and stress incontinence. The number of incontinent
      episodes per week increased an average of 0.7 in the hormone group and decreased 
      by 0.1 in the placebo group (P <.001). CONCLUSION: Daily oral estrogen plus
      progestin therapy was associated with worsening urinary incontinence in older
      postmenopausal women with weekly incontinence. We do not recommend this therapy
      for the treatment of incontinence.

TI  - Hormonal replacement therapy reduces forearm fracture incidence in recent
      postmenopausal women - results of the Danish Osteoporosis Prevention Study.
PG  - 181-93
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the fracture reducing potential of hormonal replacement
      therapy (HRT) in recent postmenopausal women in a primary preventive scenario.
      METHODS: Prospective controlled comprehensive cohort trial: 2016 healthy women
      aged 45-58 years, from three to 24 months past last menstrual bleeding were
      recruited from a random sample of the background population. Mean age was 50.
      8+/-2.8 years, and the number of person years followed was 9335.3. There were two
      main study arms: a randomised arm (randomised to HRT; n=502, or not; n=504) and a
      non-randomised arm (on HRT; n=221, or not; n=789 by own choice). First line HRT
      was oral sequential oestradiol/norethisterone in women with intact uterus and
      oral continuous oestradiol in hysterectomised women. RESULTS: After five years, a
      total of 156 fractures were sustained by 140 women. There were 51 forearm
      fractures in 51 women. By intention-to-treat analysis (n=2016), overall fracture 
      risk was borderline statistically significantly reduced (RR=0.73, 95% CI:
      0.50-1.05), and forearm fracture risk was significantly reduced (RR=0.45, 95% CI:
      0.22-0.90) with HRT. Restricting the analysis to women who had adhered to their
      initial allocation of either HRT (n=395) or no HRT (n=977) showed a significant
      reduction in both the overall fracture risk (RR=0.61, 95% CI: 0.39-0.97) and the 
      risk of forearm fractures (RR=0.24, 95% CI: 0.09-0.69). Compliance with HRT was
      65% after five years. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to reduce the number of forearm
      fractures and possibly the total number of fractures in recent postmenopausal
      women by use of HRT as primary prevention.

TI  - Effects of estrogen therapy on well-being in postmenopausal women without
      vasomotor complaints.
PG  - 123-30
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish whether estrogen treatment affects well-being in
      postmenopausal women without current or previous vasomotor symptoms. DESIGN:
      Forty postmenopausal women, aged 45-59 years, without current or previous
      vasomotor complaints, were included. They were randomized to masked treatment
      with either transdermal 17beta-estradiol 50 microg/24 h or to placebo. At
      baseline and after 12 and 14 weeks of treatment, the women completed a
      questionnaire which reflects well-being, the Psychological General Well-Being
      (PGWB) Index. RESULTS: The women scored high on the PGWB Index, both at baseline 
      and after 12 and 14 weeks of treatment. There was no significant difference in
      well-being according to PGWB Index between the groups treated with estrogen and
      placebo, neither at baseline, nor after therapy. Furthermore, there was no
      difference in change during therapy between the treatment groups. CONCLUSION:
      There is a gradual decline in estrogen during the climacteric, and it is
      controversial to which extent this affects women's mental health. The PGWB scores
      in this study were high before therapy, reflecting that these women without
      previous or current vasomotor complaints represented a selected sample. Neither
      short-term estrogen treatment over 12 weeks nor addition with medroxyprogesterone
      acetate during 2 weeks improved well-being in postmenopausal women without
      vasomotor symptoms who had high well-being at baseline.

TI  - Suppression of vasomotor and vulvovaginal symptoms with continuous oral
      17beta-estradiol.
PG  - 310-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of different doses of
      173-estradiol for the treatment of vasomotor and vulvovaginal symptoms. DESIGN:
      This was a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, parallel-group study. One
      hundred forty-five subjects, including naturally postmenopausal women aged 40-60 
      (who had not experienced menses for at least 12 months), women who had undergone 
      hysterectomy, and women aged 25-60 who had undergone bilateral oophorectomy with 
      or without hysterectomy were studied. Either placebo or 17beta-estradiol (1 mg or
      0.5 mg) was given orally every day for 12 weeks, and vasomotor symptoms and
      vaginal epithelial cytology were evaluated. RESULTS: There were significant
      differences between placebo and the active treatments in the percentage change
      from baseline in the number of hot flushes (all hot flushes, 1 mg vs. placebo, p 
      < 0.00 1; 0.5 mg vs. placebo, p = 0.007), with a more substantial proportion of
      subjects responding in the 1-mg group (mean change in mean number of hot flushes 
      of 83.2%). Both doses were also more effective than placebo in increasing the
      proportion of mature vaginal cells (end-of-treatment mean values of 0%, 78.5%,
      and 21.5% for parabasal, intermediate, and superficial cells, respectively, in
      the 1-mg group; mean values of 0.3%, 80.8%, and 18.9% in the 0.5-mg group; and
      mean values of 15.2%, 74.7%, and 10.2% in the placebo group). The proportion of
      subjects reporting no vaginal dryness was greatest in the 1-mg group (mean
      percentage of days without dryness of 86.1% at weeks 9-12). CONCLUSIONS: For the 
      relief of vasomotor and vulvovaginal symptoms, 17beta-estradiol I mg is effective
      and has an excellent safety profile.

TI  - An estradiol matrix transdermal system for the prevention of postmenopausal bone 
      loss.
PG  - 845-57
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and
      tolerability of 2 years' application of an estradiol matrix transdermal system
      for the prevention of postmenopausal bone loss. METHODS: In this multicenter,
      randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, 261 surgically or naturally
      postmenopausal women were randomized to apply the estradiol matrix transdermal
      system (0.025, 0.0375, 0.05, or 0.1 mg/d) or matching placebo twice a week for 2 
      years. The study was double blind with respect to treatment (active vs placebo)
      but not to the dose levels of active treatment (because of the differing sizes
      and shapes of the patches). In addition to receiving the assigned treatment, the 
      100 nonhysterectomized women received 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate daily
      throughout the study. RESULTS: The evaluable group (n = 259) had a mean age of 52
      years and a mean duration of menopause of 32 months. Following 2 years of
      treatment, there were significant differences in favor of estradiol between all
      doses of the estradiol matrix transdermal system and placebo in terms of the
      percentage change from baseline in the bone mineral density (BMD) of the L1-L4
      anteroposterior lumbar spine (0.1 and 0.05 mg/d, P < 0.001; 0.0375 mg/d, P =
      0.024; 0.025 mg/d, P = 0.002). Percentage changes from baseline in the BMD of the
      femoral neck after 2 years of treatment also consistently demonstrated the
      efficacy of the estradiol matrix transdermal system compared with placebo (all, P
      < or = 0.044). The estradiol matrix transdermal system was well tolerated.
      CONCLUSION: The estradiol matrix transdermal system was effective in preventing
      postmenopausal bone loss at dosages of 0.025 to 0.1 mg/d, and had a safety
      profile consistent with the known effects of estrogen/progestin.

TI  - 17beta-estradiol vaginal tablet versus conjugated equine estrogen vaginal cream
      to relieve menopausal atrophic vaginitis.
PG  - 156-61
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The efficacy and safety of 25-microg 17beta-estradiol vaginal tablets
      (Vagifem) were assessed and compared with 1.25-mg conjugated equine estrogen
      vaginal cream (Premarin Vaginal Cream) for the relief of menopausal-derived
      atrophic vaginitis, resulting from estrogen deficiency. DESIGN: In a multicenter,
      open-label, randomized, parallel-group study, 159 menopausal women were treated
      for 24 weeks with either vaginal tablets or vaginal cream. Efficacy was evaluated
      by relief of vaginal symptoms and concentrations of serum estradiol and
      follicle-stimulating hormone. Safety was monitored by the incidence of adverse
      events, evaluation of endometrial biopsies, and clinical laboratory results.
      Patients also assessed the acceptability of the study medications. RESULTS:
      Composite scores of vaginal symptoms (dryness, soreness, and irritation)
      demonstrated that both treatments provided equivalent relief of the symptoms of
      atrophic vaginitis. At weeks 2, 12, and 24, increases in serum estradiol
      concentrations and suppression of follicle-stimulating hormone were observed in
      significantly more patients who were using the vaginal cream than in those who
      were using the vaginal tablets (p < 0.001). Fewer patients who were using the
      vaginal tablets experienced endometrial proliferation or hyperplasia compared
      with patients who were using the vaginal cream. Significantly more patients who
      were using the vaginal tablets rated their medication favorably than did patients
      who were using the vaginal cream (p < or = 0.001). Patients who were receiving
      the vaginal tablets also had a lower incidence of patient withdrawal (10% versus 
      32%). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment regimens with 25-microg 17beta-estradiol vaginal
      tablets and with 1.25-mg conjugated equine estrogen vaginal cream were equivalent
      in relieving symptoms of atrophic vaginitis. The vaginal tablets demonstrated a
      localized effect without appreciable systemic estradiol increases or estrogenic
      side effects. Vaginal tablet therapy resulted in greater patient acceptance and
      lower withdrawal rates compared with vaginal cream therapy.

TI  - Initial 17beta-estradiol dose for treating vasomotor symptoms.
PG  - 726-31
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of different doses of 17beta-estradiol (E2)
      for relief of vasomotor symptoms in menopausal women. METHODS: This was a
      randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, 12-week study in which 333
      menopausal women with moderate or severe hot flushes were assigned to treatment
      with 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, or 2 mg oral micronized 17beta-E2, or placebo. The
      number and severity of hot flushes were recorded daily. RESULTS: There was a
      significant linear correlation between increased dosage of 17beta-E2 and
      decreased moderate to severe hot flushes per week (P <.001). Rapid reduction in
      moderate to severe hot flushes was only achieved with 1 and 2 mg, showing a
      significant difference from placebo at week 4 (P <.05). At week 4, half the women
      on placebo had reduced moderate to severe hot flushes of at least 52%; the
      corresponding figures were 56%, 69%, 86%, and 91% for 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 mg,
      respectively. At week 12, all doses except 0.25 mg were significantly better than
      placebo for reducing moderate to severe hot flushes (P <.001). Although there
      were no significant differences, twice as many women in the 2-mg group
      discontinued treatment due to adverse events, compared with the placebo group.
      CONCLUSION: Oral micronized 17beta-E2 showed a dose-response effect for reducing 
      moderate and severe hot flushes in menopausal women. 17beta-E2 1 mg appeared to
      be the most useful initial dose.

TI  - Efficacy on climacteric symptoms and safety of low dose estradiol transdermal
      matrix patches. A randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 293-300
AB  - Two estradiol (E2) transdermal patches releasing 25 micrograms/day E2 (D-25) or
      37.5 micrograms/day E2 (D-37.5) were compared to a placebo patch on 156 patients 
      in natural or surgical menopause suffering from at least 5 hot flushes per day,
      randomly and blindly assigned to three parallel groups of 52 patients each, to be
      treated continuously for 12 weeks, without progestin opposition. "Responders"
      (patients with less than 3 hot flushes per day at the end of treatment), were 82%
      and 90% under D-25 or D-37.5, respectively, both significantly (p < 0.001) more
      than under placebo (44%). Comparable efficacy was observed on severity of hot
      flushes, Kupperman Index and on the self-rated efficacy. Systemic adverse events 
      occurred in 10%, 10% and 8% of patients, respectively, under D-25, D-37.5 or
      placebo. Occasional mild and transient itching and/or erythema on the site of
      application was reported by few patients and did never require discontinuation of
      application. In conclusion D-25 and D-37.5 were significantly more effective than
      placebo in relieving climacteric symptoms and were systemically and locally as
      well tolerated as placebo. D-25 (Demestril 25) releasing 25 micrograms/day E2 can
      therefore be recommended for low-dosed estrogen replacement therapy.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of a new 7-day transdermal estradiol patch versus
      placebo in hysterectomized women with postmenopausal complaints.
PG  - 143-53
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the efficacy and tolerability of a continuously
      applied 7-day-Estradiol patch (Fem7, Merck KGaA, Germany) delivering 50 microg
      estradiol per day in the treatment of hysterectomized women with postmenopausal
      complaints compared with placebo. DESIGN: A multicentre, randomized, double-blind
      study with an initial screening phase (phase I), a 3-month double-blind
      placebo-controlled phase (phase II) and a 3-month open follow-up phase (phase
      III). METHODS: 186 patients were randomized for a 3-cycle placebo-controlled
      study followed by a 3-cycle open follow-up (total duration; 6 months). The
      changes in Kupperman Index (primary efficacy variable), hot flushes and
      urogenital symptom score were studied from baseline to the end of the study. In
      addition, skin tolerability was assessed and patients were also asked to grade
      the subjective acceptance of therapy. RESULTS: A reduction in Kupperman Index was
      observed in both groups, and at each cycle of the placebo-controlled treatment
      phase the 7-day-Estradiol patch was superior compared with placebo (last value
      vs. baseline P = 0.0006). From the second treatment week onwards a distinct
      difference was noted in the reduction of hot flushes from baseline between the
      7-day-Estradiol patch group and the placebo group. The difference between the
      groups was statistically significant for each cycle and at the end of the
      controlled treatment phase (mean weekly hot flush reduction at the end of the
      placebo-controlled treatment phase: -32.5 for the 7-day-Estradiol patch vs. -22.0
      for placebo, P = 0.0025). The efficacy of the 7-day-Estradiol patch within the
      application period did not show any difference between days 1-3 and 4-7.
      Subjective acceptance of the 7-day-Estradiol patch was good and 72.4% of patients
      who took active medication throughout the study were willing to consider
      continuing its use. CONCLUSIONS: The 7-day-Estradiol patch is well tolerated and 
      provides effective relief of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms in
      hysterectomized women, with a rapid onset of action and 7-day duration of
      therapeutic effect. Although a placebo effect was observed, the 7-day-Estradiol
      patch significantly reduced hot flushes and other menopausal symptoms throughout 
      the application period.

TI  - A double-blind, randomized, comparative study evaluating clinical effects of two 
      sequential estradiol-progestogen combinations containing either desogestrel or
      medroxyprogesterone acetate in climacteric women.
PG  - 133-42
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare a new sequential
      estradiol-desogestrel (E2-DSG) hormone replacement regimen (Liseta) with one of
      the standard treatments i.e. estradiol valerate-medroxyprogesterone acetate
      (E2V-MPA) combination (Klimalet) regarding the alleviation of climacteric
      symptoms, vaginal bleeding pattern and the occurrence of adverse experiences.
      METHODS: In a multicenter study performed in Denmark, a total of 376
      perimenopausal women with climacteric symptoms were randomly allocated to oral
      sequential treatment with either E2-DSG (1.5 mg E2 for 24 days with 0.15 mg DSG
      for the last 12 days followed by a placebo tablet for 4 days) (n = 186) or with
      E2V-MPA (2 mg E2V for 21 days with 10 mg MPA for the last 10 days) (n = 190).
      Treatments were administered, using a double-blind, double-dummy technique for 6 
      cycles of 28 days. RESULTS: Three hundred and seventeen women, 158 in the E2-DSG 
      and 159 in the E2V-MPA group, completed six treatment cycles. Both treatments
      reduced menopausal symptoms rapidly and to a similar extent. Hot flushes were
      present in 88% of the women in both groups. After six treatment cycles, hot
      flushes were no longer present in 71 and 62% of the women in the E2-DSG and
      E2V-MPA group, respectively. Perspiration decreased from 80 to 65% in the E2-DSG 
      group and from 82 to 63% in the E2V-MPA group. Mood disturbances were present in 
      82% of the women in the E2-DSG at baseline, and in 52% after six cycles. In the
      E2V-MPA group the corresponding figures were 68 and 42%, respectively. The
      bleeding pattern was comparable in both treatment groups. Regular withdrawal
      (expected) bleeding appeared in 90-92% and in 85-90% of the women in cycles 1-5
      with E2-DSG and E2V-MPA, respectively. Irregular bleeding (including spotting)
      occurred in 15.2% of the women receiving E2-DSG and in 20.1% of the women treated
      with E2V-MPA in cycle 6. In both treatment groups there was a tendency of a
      slight decrease in blood pressure. Adverse events were in less than 10% in each
      group the reason to discontinue treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Both treatments
      effectively alleviated menopausal complaints and presented good cycle control.
      Bleeding pattern and mood disturbances appeared to be more favorable influenced
      by E2-DSG.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of a new estradiol delivering matrix patch (Estraderm
      MX) in postmenopausal women.
PG  - 47-55
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy and tolerability of a new matrix patch
      delivering estradiol (E2 Matrix) at doses of 0.05 and 0.10 mg per day (Estraderm 
      MX 50, 100) in the treatment of moderate to severe postmenopausal symptoms.
      METHODS: A total of 254 postmenopausal women were randomized to receive treatment
      with E2 Matrix 0.10 mg (N = 86), E2 Matrix 0.05 mg (N = 82), or placebo (N = 86) 
      in a double-blind, double-dummy fashion for a period of 12 weeks continuously.
      Patches were applied twice weekly to the buttocks with each patient wearing two
      patches at all times. The primary efficacy criterion was the difference from
      baseline of the mean number of moderate to severe hot flushes per 24 h during the
      last 2 weeks of treatment. Other efficacy variables included reduction in hot
      flushes at 4 and 8 weeks, reduction in daytime flushing and night sweats, and
      Kupperman Index at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. RESULTS: E2 Matrix 0.10 and 0.05 mg were
      both significantly superior to placebo in reducing hot flushes per 24 h after 4, 
      8, and 12 weeks of treatment (P < 0.001). Also, for all other efficacy parameters
      studied, both dosage strengths of E2 Matrix were statistically significantly
      superior to placebo at all time points (P < 0.001). Local tolerability was good
      in both groups. A slight increase in estrogen related adverse effects (breast
      tenderness, leukorrhoea) was seen with the 0.10 mg patch. Adhesion of patches and
      compliance were good. Overall systemic tolerability was good in both treated
      groups. However, a 4.8% overall incidence of endometrial hyperplasia was observed
      in patients with an intact uterus. CONCLUSIONS: This new matrix patch offers an
      effective and well tolerated dosage form for delivery of 0.05 and 0.1 mg
      estradiol per day. It may be particularly suitable for those women who experience
      local sensitivity to alcohol-containing systems. In light of the observed
      hyperplasia after treatment in five patients, estrogen therapy should as yet be
      supplemented monthly with a progestogen in women with an intact uterus.

TI  - Matrix delivery transdermal 17beta-estradiol for the prevention of bone loss in
      postmenopausal women. The International Study Group.
PG  - 358-66
AB  - A total of 277 early postmenopausal women were enrolled in this
      placebo-controlled 2-year study to examine the efficacy of a matrix transdermal
      17beta-estradiol system, at three different dosages (25, 50 and 75 mg/day)
      combined with sequential oral dydrogesterone 20 mg/day, in preventing bone loss. 
      At 2 years, the difference from placebo in percentage change from baseline of
      L1-4 lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) (assessed by dual-energy X-ray
      absorptiometry) was 4.7% +/- 0.7% with estradiol 25 mg/day, 7.3% +/- 0.7% with
      estradiol 50 mg/day and 8.7% +/- 0.7% with estradiol 75 mg/day (all values mean
      +/- SEM). There were also significant increases in femoral neck, trochanter and
      total hip BMD with all doses of estradiol compared with placebo. Additionally,
      most patients had a significant gain (increase greater than 2.08%) in lumbar
      spine bone mass compared with placebo. Patients who received estradiol also
      experienced clinically significant and dose-related decreases in total serum
      osteocalcin, serum bone alkaline phosphatase and urinary C-telopeptide, with all 
      three markers of bone turnover returning to premenopausal levels. Estradiol was
      well tolerated during the 2-year treatment period. Transdermal estradiol is
      effective and well tolerated at dosages between 25-75 mg/day in the prevention of
      bone loss in postmenopausal women; 25 mg/day offers an effective option for those
      women who cannot tolerate higher doses.

TI  - Monofluorophosphate combined with hormone replacement therapy induces a
      synergistic effect on bone mass by dissociating bone formation and resorption in 
      postmenopausal women: a randomized study.
PG  - 3013-20
AB  - Sodium fluoride stimulates bone formation and has been used to treat osteoporosis
      for decades despite debate about the antifracture efficacy. Hormone replacement
      therapy (HRT) results in only modest increases in bone mineral density (BMD).
      However, for women with low bone mass, the ideal therapy should not only inhibit 
      bone resorption but simultaneously stimulate bone formation to increase bone mass
      above the fracture threshold. We thus performed a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled intervention study to prospectively investigate the effect of 
      a low dose of fluoride, in combination with HRT, on BMD and biochemical markers
      of bone turnover. One hundred healthy postmenopausal women (60-70 yr old) were
      thus randomly assigned to: 1) HRT [transdermal 17beta-estradiol, releasing 50
      microg/day; plus oral norethisterone acetate (NETA), 1 mg/day]; or 2) oral
      monofluorophosphate (MFP; equivalent to fluoride, 20 mg/day); or 3) HRT+MFP; or
      4) placebo, for 96 weeks. All participants received a calcium supplement of 1000 
      mg/day. Sixty-eight women completed the study. We found a pronounced, linear
      increase in spinal BMD during treatment with HRT+MFP [11.8% (1.7% SEM)], which
      was significantly greater than the increase in the HRT group [4.0% (0.5% per yr);
      P < 0.05]. MFP produced a smaller increase [2.4% (0.6% per yr)], whereas there
      was no change in the placebo group [0.0% (0.5% SEM)]. Similar changes were found 
      at the other skeletal sites (distal forearm, hip, and total body). Markers of
      bone formation showed a fall in the HRT group, which was significantly more
      pronounced than in the combined HRT+MFP group. A nonsignificant increase was
      found in the MFP group, whereas the placebo group showed a decrease caused by
      calcium treatment. The marker of bone resorption decreased significantly more in 
      the HRT and the HRT+MFP groups than in the placebo group but tended to increase
      in the MFP group. In conclusion, this study shows, by use of biochemical markers 
      of bone turnover, that bone resorption and formation may be dissociated, as a
      result of actions of two compounds with diverging effects on bone turnover.
      Furthermore, the synergistic effects of relatively low doses of the compounds
      suggested statistically and clinically significant increases in trabecular and
      probably also cortical bone. Adverse effects were relatively rare and mild.

TI  - The effect of low-dose continuous estrogen and progesterone therapy with calcium 
      and vitamin D on bone in elderly women. A randomized, controlled trial.
PG  - 897-904
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hormone replacement therapy (HRT), the mainstay of osteoporosis
      prevention, is limited because of dose-related risks, side effects, and patient
      acceptance. The bone-sparing efficacy and tolerability of the lowest available
      doses of HRT have not been adequately studied in elderly women. OBJECTIVE: To
      determine the bone-sparing effect of continuous low-dose HRT in elderly women.
      DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: University
      osteoporosis research and clinical center. PATIENTS: 128 healthy white women (age
      > 65 years) with low bone mass recruited by word of mouth and by local
      advertisement. The principal eligibility criterion was spinal bone mineral
      density of 0.90 g/cm2 or less. INTERVENTION: Continuous therapy with conjugated
      equine estrogen, 0.3 mg/d, and medroxyprogesterone, 2.5 mg/d, or matching
      placebo. Sufficient calcium supplementation was given to bring all calcium
      intakes above 1000 mg/d in both groups; supplemental oral 25-hydroxyvitamin D was
      given to maintain serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels of at least 75 nmol/L in both 
      groups. MEASUREMENTS: Bone mineral density of the spine, hip, total body, and
      forearm; serum total alkaline phosphatase and serum osteocalcin levels at 6-month
      intervals; and 24-hour urine creatinine and hydroxyproline excretion at baseline,
      12 months, and 42 months. RESULTS: During 3.5 years of observation, spinal bone
      mineral density increased by 3.5% (P < 0.001) in an intention-to-treat analysis
      and by 5.2% among patients with greater than 90% adherence to therapy.
      Significant increases were seen in total-body and forearm bone density (P <
      0.01). Symptoms related to HRT (breast tenderness, spotting, pelvic discomfort,
      and mood changes) were mild and short-lived. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous low-dose HRT
      with conjugated equine estrogen and oral medroxyprogesterone combined with
      adequate calcium and vitamin D provides a bone-sparing effect that is similar or 
      superior to that provided by other, higher-dose HRT regimens in elderly women.
      This combination is well tolerated by most patients.

TI  - Symptom relief and side effects of postmenopausal hormones: results from the
      Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin Interventions Trial.
PG  - 982-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess pair-wise differences between placebo, estrogen, and each of
      three estrogen-progestin regimens on selected symptoms. METHODS: This was a
      3-year, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 875 postmenopausal
      women aged 45-64 years at baseline. Participants were assigned randomly to one of
      five groups: 1) placebo, 2) daily conjugated equine estrogens, 3) conjugated
      equine estrogens plus cyclical medroxyprogesterone acetate, 4) conjugated equine 
      estrogens plus daily medroxyprogesterone acetate, and 5) conjugated equine
      estrogens plus cyclical micronized progesterone. Symptoms were self-reported
      using a checklist at 1 and 3 years. Factor analysis reduced 52 symptoms to a set 
      of six symptom groups. RESULTS: In intention-to-treat analyses at 1 year, each
      active treatment demonstrated a marked, statistically significant, protective
      effect against vasomotor symptoms compared with placebo (odds ratios [ORs]
      0.17-0.28); there was no additional benefit of estrogen-progestin over estrogen
      alone. Only progestin-containing regimens were significantly associated with
      higher levels of breast discomfort (OR 1.92-2.27). Compared with placebo, women
      randomized to conjugated equine estrogens reported no increase in perceived
      weight. Those randomized to medroxyprogesterone acetate reported less perceived
      weight gain (OR 0.61-0.69) than placebo. Anxiety, cognitive, and affective
      symptoms did not differ by treatment assignment. Analyses restricted to adherent 
      women were not materially different than those using intention-to-treat, except
      that women adherent to medroxyprogesterone acetate and micronized progesterone
      regimens reported fewer musculoskeletal symptoms (OR 0.62-0.68). CONCLUSION:
      These results confirm the usefulness of post-menopausal hormone therapy for hot
      flashes, show convincingly that estrogen plus progestin causes breast discomfort,
      and demonstrate little influence of postmenopausal hormones on anxiety,
      cognition, or affect.

TI  - Randomized trial of estrogen plus progestin for secondary prevention of coronary 
      heart disease in postmenopausal women. Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement
      Study (HERS) Research Group.
PG  - 605-13
AB  - CONTEXT: Observational studies have found lower rates of coronary heart disease
      (CHD) in postmenopausal women who take estrogen than in women who do not, but
      this potential benefit has not been confirmed in clinical trials. OBJECTIVE: To
      determine if estrogen plus progestin therapy alters the risk for CHD events in
      postmenopausal women with established coronary disease. DESIGN: Randomized,
      blinded, placebo-controlled secondary prevention trial. SETTING: Outpatient and
      community settings at 20 US clinical centers. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2763 women
      with coronary disease, younger than 80 years, and postmenopausal with an intact
      uterus. Mean age was 66.7 years. INTERVENTION: Either 0.625 mg of conjugated
      equine estrogens plus 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate in 1 tablet daily (n 
      = 1380) or a placebo of identical appearance (n = 1383). Follow-up averaged 4.1
      years; 82% of those assigned to hormone treatment were taking it at the end of 1 
      year, and 75% at the end of 3 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome
      was the occurrence of nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) or CHD death. Secondary
      cardiovascular outcomes included coronary revascularization, unstable angina,
      congestive heart failure, resuscitated cardiac arrest, stroke or transient
      ischemic attack, and peripheral arterial disease. All-cause mortality was also
      considered. RESULTS: Overall, there were no significant differences between
      groups in the primary outcome or in any of the secondary cardiovascular outcomes:
      172 women in the hormone group and 176 women in the placebo group had MI or CHD
      death (relative hazard [RH], 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80-1.22). The 
      lack of an overall effect occurred despite a net 11% lower low-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol level and 10% higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
      level in the hormone group compared with the placebo group (each P<.001). Within 
      the overall null effect, there was a statistically significant time trend, with
      more CHD events in the hormone group than in the placebo group in year 1 and
      fewer in years 4 and 5. More women in the hormone group than in the placebo group
      experienced venous thromboembolic events (34 vs 12; RH, 2.89; 95% CI, 1.50-5.58) 
      and gallbladder disease (84 vs 62; RH, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.00-1.92). There were no
      significant differences in several other end points for which power was limited, 
      including fracture, cancer, and total mortality (131 vs 123 deaths; RH, 1.08; 95%
      CI, 0.84-1.38). CONCLUSIONS: During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment 
      with oral conjugated equine estrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate did not
      reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established
      coronary disease. The treatment did increase the rate of thromboembolic events
      and gallbladder disease. Based on the finding of no overall cardiovascular
      benefit and a pattern of early increase in risk of CHD events, we do not
      recommend starting this treatment for the purpose of secondary prevention of CHD.
      However, given the favorable pattern of CHD events after several years of
      therapy, it could be appropriate for women already receiving this treatment to
      continue.

      immunoassay for deoxypyridinoline.
PG  - 159-64
AB  - We have assessed urinary deoxypyridinoline (Dpd) levels by immunoassay in women
      who participated in a double-masked, placebo-controlled trial of the bone loss
      prevention effects of estrogen replacement therapy (ERT). Ninety-one women who
      had undergone recent surgical menopause were randomized to receive either placebo
      or 0.025, 0.05 or 0.1 mg/day transdermal 17 beta-estradiol for 2 years. Mean Dpd 
      levels in the postmenopausal women were significantly elevated (p < 0.0001) above
      mean Dpd levels in a reference population of healthy, premenopausal women.
      Subjects in the placebo group lost 6.4% of lumbar spine bone mineral density
      (BMD) and 4.9% of mid-radius bone mineral content (BMC) over 2 years. Dpd levels 
      at baseline were inversely correlated with BMD and BMC changes in the placebo
      group. The placebo group and subjects receiving 0.025 mg/day 17 beta-estradiol
      who had Dpd levels increased above the reference interval cut-off (mean + 2
      standard deviations, 7.5 nmol/mmol) lost 2 times more bone mass than did those
      with Dpd levels below it. Dpd levels decreased significantly (p < 0.01) from
      baseline at 6 months following initiation of treatment with 0.05 or 0.1 mg/day 17
      beta-estradiol, changes that correlated with increased lumbar spine BMD and with 
      changes in mid-radius BMC. At 12 months, Dpd levels were lower than baseline and 
      placebo in all three treatment groups. These data suggest utility of this Dpd
      immunoassay in assessing changes in bone resorption induced by surgical menopause
      and ERT.

TI  - A four-year randomized controlled trial of hormone replacement and
      bisphosphonate, alone or in combination, in women with postmenopausal
      osteoporosis.
PG  - 219-26
AB  - PURPOSE: Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with estrogen and treatment with
      bisphosphonates have been shown to increase bone mineral density (BMD) in
      postmenopausal women. This 4-year prospective randomized study was carried out to
      assess the effectiveness of the combined HRT plus etidronate on BMD in
      postmenopausal women with established osteoporosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS:
      Seventy-two postmenopausal women (mean age 64.9+/-0.5 years) attending metabolic 
      bone disease outpatient clinics with established osteoporosis were randomly
      allocated into one of four treatment groups and monitored for 4 years. All
      patients enrolled in this study including the control group (n=18) received 1.0 g
      elemental calcium and 400 units vitamin D per day. The HRT group (n=18) received 
      cyclical estrogen and progesterone; the etidronate group (n=17) received
      intermittent cyclical etidronate; and the combined therapy group (n=19) received 
      both HRT and etidronate. BMD was measured in the lumbar spine and the hip before 
      treatment and at 2 and 4 years after treatment. Changes in height were recorded, 
      and the occurrence of new vertebral fractures were documented in comparison with 
      the baseline radiographic evaluation. In 40 patients (10 patients per group),
      analysis of bone histomorphometry was carried out after 4 years of treatment.
      RESULTS: In patients who received the combined therapy, BMD increased in the
      lumbar spine by 10.4% (P <0.001) and in the hip by 7.0% (P <0.001) at 4 years.
      For patients treated with ICE, these increases were 7.3% (P <0.001) and 0.9% (P
      <0.05), and with HRT, the increases were 7.0% (P <0.001) and 4.8% (P <0.01) in
      the vertebrae and femora, respectively. The group treated with calcium and
      vitamin D lost 2.5% (P <0.05) and 4.4% (P <0.01) of BMD in the vertebrae and
      femora, respectively, after 4 years. Patients who received combined therapy had
      significantly higher BMD in both the vertebrae and in the femora (P <0.05) in
      comparison with patients who were treated with HRT or etidronate alone after 4
      years. In comparison with patients in the control group, there was a trend toward
      a lower rate of new vertebral fractures in the treatment groups. Height loss was 
      significantly less in all three active treatment groups (HRT [P <0.001],
      etidronate [P <0.02], and combined therapy group [P <0.0001]), in comparison with
      the control group. The combined therapy group did not have a significant height
      loss, in comparison with the HRT (P <0.02) and the etidronate (P <0.001) groups. 
      None of the patients had histomorphometric evidence of osteomalacia. CONCLUSION: 
      This 4-year randomized study showed an additive effect of etidronate and HRT on
      hip and spine BMD in postmenopausal women with established osteoporosis.

TI  - Low-dose esterified estrogen therapy: effects on bone, plasma estradiol
      concentrations, endometrium, and lipid levels. Estratab/Osteoporosis Study Group.
PG  - 2609-15
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prospective studies have shown that doses equivalent to conjugated
      equine estrogens of 0.625 mg/d or higher are needed to produce a significant
      increase in bone mineral density of the lumbar spine. OBJECTIVES: To determine
      the effects of unopposed esterified estrogens on bone mineral density, lipid
      levels, and endometrial tissue structure, and to relate these effects to changes 
      in plasma estradiol levels. METHODS: Four hundred six postmenopausal women were
      given calcium, 1000 mg/d, and randomly assigned to receive continuous esterified 
      estrogens (0.3, 0.625, or 1.25 mg/d) or placebo for 24 months. Bone mineral
      density measurements and endometrial and laboratory assessments were conducted
      every 6 months; plasma estradiol concentrations were measured after 12, 18, and
      24 months. RESULTS: All doses of esterified estrogens produced significant
      increases in bone mineral density of the lumbar spine compared with baseline and 
      with placebo at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Mean plasma estradiol levels increased 
      with esterified estrogens dose, and individual subject bone mineral density
      changes appeared related to plasma estradiol concentrations. Clinically relevant 
      rates of endometrial hyperplasia were noted only in the groups receiving 0.625
      and 1.25 mg of esterified estrogens daily. Lipid changes were dose related and
      apparent in all groups. CONCLUSIONS: Esterified estrogens at doses from 0.3 to
      1.25 mg/d, administered unopposed by progestin, produce a continuum of positive
      changes on bone and lipids. Plasma estradiol concentrations increased with
      esterified estrogens dose and were related to positive bone mineral densities.
      The 0.3-mg dose resulted in positive bone and lipid changes without inducing
      endometrial hyperplasia.

TI  - Prevention of bone loss with alendronate in postmenopausal women under 60 years
      of age. Early Postmenopausal Intervention Cohort Study Group.
PG  - 485-92
AB  - BACKGROUND: Estrogen-replacement therapy prevents osteoporosis in postmenopausal 
      women by inhibiting bone resorption, but the balance between its long-term risks 
      and benefits remains unclear. Whether other antiresorptive therapies can prevent 
      osteoporosis in these women is also not clear. METHODS: We studied the effect of 
      2.5 mg or 5 mg of alendronate per day or placebo on bone mineral density in 1174 
      postmenopausal women under 60 years of age. An additional 435 women who were
      prepared to receive a combination of estrogen and progestin were randomly
      assigned to one of the above treatments or open-label estrogen-progestin. The
      main outcome measure was the change in bone mineral density of the lumbar spine, 
      hip, distal forearm, and total body measured annually for two years by
      dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: The women who received placebo lost
      bone mineral density at all measured sites, whereas the women treated with 5 mg
      of alendronate daily had a mean (+/-SE) increase in bone mineral density of
      3.5+/-0.2 percent at the lumbar spine, 1.9+/-0.1 percent at the hip, and
      0.7+/-0.1 percent for the total body (all P<0.001). Women treated with 2.5 mg of 
      alendronate daily had smaller increases in bone mineral density. Alendronate did 
      not increase bone mineral density of the forearm, but it slowed the loss. The
      responses to estrogen-progestin were 1 to 2 percentage points greater than those 
      to the 5-mg dose of alendronate. Alendronate was well tolerated, with a safety
      profile similar to that of placebo or estrogen-progestin. CONCLUSIONS:
      Alendronate prevents bone loss in postmenopausal women under 60 years of age to
      nearly the same extent as estrogen-progestin.

TI  - Effects of combined low dose of the isoflavone derivative ipriflavone and
      estrogen replacement on bone mineral density and metabolism in postmenopausal
      women.
PG  - 75-81
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the pattern of biochemical markers of bone metabolism and
      vertebral bone mineral density in early postmenopausal women treated with
      combined ipriflavone and low dose conjugated estrogens. METHODS: Bone biochemical
      markers and vertebral bone density were evaluated in a longitudinal, comparative,
      2 year study conducted in postmenopausal women treated with sole calcium
      supplementation (500 mg/day), or with either ipriflavone (IP) at the standard
      dose (600 mg/day) plus the same calcium dose, low dose conjugated estrogens (CE) 
      (0.3 mg/day) plus calcium, or low dose IP (400 mg/day) plus low dose CE (0.3
      mg/day) plus calcium. The results were analyzed by repeated measures analysis of 
      variance, as appropriate. RESULTS: No modifications of both urinary excretion of 
      hydroxyproline and plasma osteocalcin levels were observed in calcium and in
      CE-treated women, while vertebral bone density significantly decreased (P <
      0.0001) in both groups. In IP or IP + CE-treated women, plasma osteocalcin did
      not show any modification, while urinary hydroxyproline showed a significant (P <
      0.05) decrease, that paralleled a significant (P < 0.05) increase in vertebral
      bone density. CONCLUSION: Postmenopausal IP administration, at the standard dose 
      of 600 mg/day, can prevent the increase in bone turnover and the decrease in bone
      density that follow ovarian failure. The same effect can be obtained with the
      combined administration of low dose (400 mg/day) IP with low dose (0.3 mg/day)
      CE.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of Estraderm MX, a new estradiol matrix patch.
PG  - 285-92
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and tolerability of a new matrix patch
      delivering 0.05 mg estradiol per day (Estraderm MX 50) in postmenopausal women
      with moderate to severe postmenopausal symptoms. METHODS: A multicenter,
      double-blind, randomized, between-patient, placebo controlled trial in 109
      postmenopausal women was carried out. Patches were applied twice weekly for 12
      weeks. Patients were assessed at 4, 8 and 12 weeks of treatment. The primary
      efficacy variable was change from baseline in mean number of moderate to severe
      hot flushes (including night sweats) per 24 h during the last 2 weeks of
      treatment. Other variables included Kupperman Index, local and systemic
      tolerability. Plasma concentrations of estradiol (E2), estrone (E1) and estrone
      sulfate (E1S) were determined before and after treatment. RESULTS: Estraderm MX
      was significantly superior to placebo (P < 0.001) in reducing mean number of
      moderate to severe hot flushes (including night sweats) per 24 h after 4, 8 and
      12 weeks of treatment. The estimate of treatment group differences after 12 weeks
      was 4.2 hot flushes (95% confidence interval: 2.6-5.8). Estraderm MX also
      significantly reduced Kupperman Index at all time points compared to placebo (P <
      0.001). Estraderm MX induced increases in mean E2, E1 and E1S plasma levels as
      expected (E2: baseline 2.7 pg/ml, 12 weeks 38.9 pg/ml; E1: baseline 18.8 pg/ml,
      12 weeks 41.6 pg/ml; E1S: baseline 235.6 pg/ml, 12 weeks 765.1 pg/ml). Overall
      rates of adverse experiences were similar for Estraderm MX and placebo. The
      number of patients reporting skin irritation was low and similar in both groups. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Estraderm MX 50, a new matrix patch, offers an effective and well
      tolerated dosage form for transdermal delivery of 0.05 mg E2 per day.

TI  - The predictive value of biochemical markers of bone turnover for bone mineral
      density in early postmenopausal women treated with hormone replacement or calcium
      supplementation.
PG  - 1904-10
AB  - To compare the relative sensitivity and specificity of bone turnover indexes for 
      bone loss or gain in early postmenopausal women, we performed a multicenter trial
      in 236 menopausal women (mean age, 51 yr), who were randomized to hormone
      replacement therapy (HRT) or calcium supplementation (CS; 500 mg/day) for 1 yr.
      Two markers of bone formation, osteocalcin (OC) and bone alkaline phosphatase
      (BSAP), and two markers of bone resorption, urinary N-telopeptide (NTx) and
      urinary free deoxypyridinoline (fDpd), as well as spine and femoral neck bone
      mineral density (BMD) were measured at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months after
      treatment. Women receiving HRT (n = 105) showed a significant increase in spine
      BMD (+2.5%; P < 0.0001) and hip BMD (+1.0%; P = 0.02) compared to women receiving
      CS, who showed a decline at both sites (-1.1%; P < 0.01). All four markers showed
      time-dependent decreases in women receiving HRT (P < 0.001) and no change in
      women receiving CS alone. When baseline indexes of turnover were stratified by
      quartile, there was a significantly greater increase in BMD among those with the 
      highest NTx, OC, and BSAP levels compared to that in those with the lowest NTx,
      OC, and BSAP levels (P < 0.05). The highest quartile for percent change from
      baseline to 6 months in fDpd, BSAP, and NTx was also associated with the greatest
      change in spine BMD at 1 yr. Receiver operator characteristic curves for percent 
      change from baseline to 6 months in an individual marker to 1 yr change in BMD
      during HRT revealed that the percent change in NTx provided the greatest
      discrimination between gain and loss of BMD. When subjects receiving HRT were
      compared by their positive or negative skeletal response at 1 yr and their
      baseline turnover marker, initial NTx values were significantly higher in those
      that gained bone than in those that lost bone (P = 0.0002). CS women in the
      highest quartile for NTx at baseline had significantly greater decreases in spine
      BMD than subjects with the lowest NTx values (P < 0.005), although this was not
      true for fDpd (P < 0.20). In conclusion, for early postmenopausal women there are
      differential responses of biochemical markers to HRT and CS. Baseline urinary NTx
      and serum OC were the most sensitive predictors of change in spine BMD after 1 yr
      of either HRT or CS. Similarly, the percent change in NTx and OC from baseline to
      6 months best predicted bone gain or loss. We conclude that markers of bone
      formation and resorption can be used clinically to predict future BMD in early
      postmenopausal women.

TI  - Prevention of postmenopausal bone loss with minimal uterine bleeding using low
      dose continuous estrogen/progestin therapy: a 2-year prospective study.
PG  - 69-76
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To re-examine the minimal effective dose of conjugated estrogen
      (CEE)-progestin hormone replacement on postmenopausal bone loss. DESIGN: A
      2-year, prospective, open label, randomized study. SETTING: Department of
      Obstetrics and Gynecology of a university hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-two
      postmenopausal or oophorectomized women. INTERVENTION: One of the following
      regimens was continuously administered for 2 years: (1) CEE 0.625 mg/day, (2) CEE
      0.625 mg + medroxyprogesterone (MPA) 2.5 mg/day, (3) CEE 0.31 mg + MPA 2.5 mg/day
      and (4) control. MEASUREMENTS: Lumbar spine and femoral BMD by dual energy X-ray 
      absorptiometry (DXA), a monthly based incidence of bleeding, serum lipids, PTH,
      calcitonin. A1-p, and osteocalcin. RESULTS: Of the 52 patients enrolled in this
      study, 49 patients completed the 1 year of therapy and 36 completed the 2- year
      study. The control group showed a significant decrease in lumbar BMD over the 2
      years (P < 0.05). The % changes in lumbar BMD at 2 years of CEE alone, CEE 0.625 
      + MPA and CEE 0.31 + MPA were 8.52% (95% confidence intervals; 4.61 approximately
      12.4%), 7.4% (0.60 approximately 14.2%) and 3.20% (0.61 approximately 5.84%),
      respectively, and were significantly higher than pretreatment values. The
      incidence of bleeding was significantly lower in women taking CEE 0.31 mg + MPA. 
      HDL cholesterol increased in women taking CEE 0.625 mg alone or with MPA. No
      significant changes in lipid profiles were seen in the control or in the group of
      women taking CEE 0.31 mg + MPA. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous hormone replacement
      therapy (HRT) using 0.31 mg of CEE and 2.5 mg of MPA is effective in increasing
      lumbar BMD in postmenopausal or oophorectomized women and can be an appropriate
      option for women with a normal lipid profile or those women wishing to eliminate 
      unscheduled bleeding.

TI  - HRT and exercise: effects on bone density, muscle strength and lipid metabolism. 
      A placebo controlled 2-year prospective trial on two estrogen-progestin regimens 
      in healthy postmenopausal women.
PG  - 139-49
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of 1- or 3-monthly sequential combinations of 
      estradiol valerate (E2V) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) on menopausal
      symptoms, bone density, muscle strength and lipid metabolism in postmenopausal
      women. METHODS: Changes in bone mineral density (BMD), isometric muscle strength,
      serum lipids and climacteric symptoms were evaluated in 78 women, 49-55 years of 
      age, with a spontaneous menopause 0.5-3 years earlier. Treatment group I received
      2 mg E2V tablets for 11 days, followed by 2 mg E2V + 10 mg MPA for 10 days and
      placebo for an additional 7 days; treatment group II received 2 mg E2V for 70
      days, 2 mg E2V + 20 mg MPA for 14 days, and placebo for 7 days. The placebo group
      received placebo continuously for 24 months. Each group was further randomised to
      exercise and non-exercise subgroups. RESULTS: Both hormone regimens significantly
      reduced menopausal symptoms, and prevented equally well the decrease of BMD both 
      in the lumbar spine and proximal femur. A positive effect of exercise on BMD was 
      observed in the placebo group. No synergistic effect of exercise and estrogen on 
      BMD could be shown. Both hormone regimens increased the isometric strength of
      back extensor muscles. Serum total and LDL cholesterol decreased during the first
      year with both estrogen regimens. CONCLUSIONS: Estrogen-progestin regimens were
      equally effective in the control of menopausal symptoms and preventing bone loss,
      increasing muscle strength and lowering serum cholesterol.

TI  - Cytokines and T-lymphocyte subsets in healthy post-menopausal women: estrogen
      retards bone loss without affecting the release of IL-1 or IL-1ra.
PG  - 251-8
AB  - Interleukin (IL)-1 is a potent inducer of bone resorption, and an increased
      secretion of the IL-1 agonists IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta relative to the IL-1
      receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) has been proposed as a mechanism leading to
      post-menopausal osteoporosis. T-lymphocytes are capable of secreting bone
      resorptive cytokines and have also been linked with bone metabolism and the
      development of osteoporosis. Cytokine secretion from whole blood cell cultures
      was compared between two randomized groups of healthy early post-menopausal women
      (mean age 52.5 yrs, N = 91) and lymphocyte subsets were quantitated by flow
      cytometry. One group received cyclic estrogen-gestagen replacement therapy (ERT) 
      while the other group was untreated. In spite of a significant bone maintaining
      effect of ERT, the basal and LPS-stimulated secretion of IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta,
      and IL-1ra was identical in the two groups. There was no association between
      cytokine release and bone mass or loss assessed over 2 yrs. The only exception
      was a weak estrogen-independent correlation between basal IL-1ra secretion and
      bone loss (r = -0.21, p < 0.05). Flow cytometry did not confirm a relationship
      between CD4/CD8 T-cell ratios and bone density or loss, and there was no effect
      of ERT on lymphocyte subsets. The number of CD3+ CD56+ T-cells showed a highly
      significant negative correlation with femoral and lumbar bone density in
      untreated women (r = -0.42, p < 0.01) similar to that found in patients with
      established osteoporosis, indicating that these adherent mononuclear cells may be
      important in the pathophysiology of post-menopausal bone loss. The possibility
      that IL-1ra acts as an independent bone-sparing factor unrelated to estrogen
      withdrawal warrants further investigation. In conclusion, ERT maintains bone
      without affecting the release of the IL-1 family of cytokines in whole blood
      cultures.

TI  - Vitamin D and HRT: no benefit additional to that of HRT alone in prevention of
      bone loss in early postmenopausal women. A 2.5-year randomized placebo-controlled
      study.
PG  - 126-32
AB  - The study was designed to examine the effect of hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
      and low-dose bone loss in non-osteoporotic early postmenopausal women and to
      determine whether Vit D supplementation can give additional benefit to an already
      optimized estrogen regimen. The effects of HRT and Vit D on bone mineral density 
      (BMD) were studied in postmenopausal women in a 2.5-year randomized
      placebo-controlled study. The study population was a subgroup of the Kuopio
      Osteoporosis Risk Factor and Prevention Study (OSTPRE) (n = 13100). A total of
      464 early postmenopausal women were randomized to four groups: (1) HRT (a
      sequential combination of 2 mg estradiol valerate and 1 mg cyproterone acetate
      (E2Val/CPA); (2) vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol, 300 IU/day); (3) HRT + Vit D; and
      (4) placebo (calcium lactate; 93 mg Ca2+/day). Lumbar (L1-4) and femoral neck BMD
      were determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry before and after 2.5 years of
      treatment. After 2.5 years, lumbar BMD had increased by 1.8% in the HRT group (p 
      > 0.001) and by 1.4% in the HRT + Vit D group (p = 0.002), whereas lumbar BMD had
      decreased by 3.5% (p < 0.001) in the Vit D group and by 3.7% (p < 0.001) in the
      placebo group. The loss of femoral neck BMD was lower in the HRT (-0.3%) and the 
      HRT + Vit D (0.9%) groups compared with the Vit D (-2.4%) and the placebo groups 
      (-3.7%). This study confirms the beneficial effect of HRT on BMD. It also shows
      that low-dose vitamin D supplementation has only a minor effect in the prevention
      of osteoporosis in non-osteoporotic early postmenopausal women and does not give 
      any benefit additional to that of HRT alone.

      hormones as replacement therapy (CHART study). A randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 1397-403
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of continuous norethindrone acetate (NA)-ethinyl
      estradiol (EE2) combinations with matching unopposed EE2 or placebo. DESIGN: A
      2-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial. SETTING:
      Outpatients at 65 centers. PATIENTS: Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic women
      aged 40 years or older who had undergone the onset of spontaneous menopause
      within the last 5 years and who had an intact uterus. INTERVENTIONS: Patients
      were equally randomized to placebo or 1 of 8 treatment groups: 0.2 mg of NA and 1
      microg of EE2; 0.5 mg of NA and 2.5 microg of EE2; 1 mg of NA and 5 microg of
      EE2; 1 mg of NA and 10 microg of EE2; 1 microg of EE2; 2.5 microg of EE2; 5
      microg of EE2; or 10 microg of EE2. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Bone mineral
      density (BMD) measured by quantitative computed tomography, serum lipids, and
      endometrial effects as assessed by rate of hyperplasia and proliferative status. 
      RESULTS: Twelve hundred sixty-five patients entered the study. Bone mineral
      density increased significantly from baseline (P<.001) in the 1 mg NA-5 microg
      EE2 and the 1 mg NA-10 microg EE2 treatment groups at each annual assessment.
      Among the unopposed EE2 groups, only the 10-microg group had increased BMD above 
      baseline, but also was accompanied by an unacceptably high rate of endometrial
      hyperplasia. The NA-EE2 treatment groups had a significant linear dose-response
      trend for increasing BMD. Increased endometrial proliferation and hyperplasia
      occurred with increasing unopposed estrogen doses. The combination of NA and EE2 
      effectively protected the endometrium against hyperplasia. The percentage of
      change in the ratio of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to low-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol was positive for all treatment groups. The increase in
      triglyceride levels associated with EE2 was attenuated with NA-EE2 treatment.
      CONCLUSIONS: Daily treatment with NA-EE2 was well tolerated and protected the
      endometrium from EE2-induced proliferation and hyperplasia. The NA-EE2 treatments
      produced a dose-related significant increase in BMD that was not present with
      unopposed EE2 treatment. The overall effect of NA-EE2 treatments on lipid
      measures was favorable.

PG  - 1389-96
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of hormone therapy on bone mineral density (BMD)
      in the spine and hip of postmenopausal women. DESIGN: A 3-year, multicenter,
      randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: A
      total of 875 healthy women aged 45 to 64 years recruited at 7 clinical centers.
      INTERVENTIONS: Treatments were (1) placebo; (2) conjugated equine estrogens
      (CEE), 0.625 mg/d; (3) CEE, 0.625 mg/d plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), 10
      mg/d for 12 d/mo; (4) CEE, 0.625 mg/d plus MPA, 2.5 mg/d daily; or (5) CEE, 0.625
      mg/d plus micronized progesterone (MP), 200 mg/d for 12 d/mo. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURES: Bone mineral density at baseline, 12 months, and 36 months. RESULTS:
      Participants assigned to the placebo group lost an average of 1.8% of spine BMD
      and 1.7% of hip BMD by the 36-month visit, while those assigned to active
      regimens gained BMD at both sites, ranging from 3.5% to 5.0% mean total increases
      in spinal BMD and a mean total increase of 1.7% of BMD in the hip. Changes in BMD
      for women assigned to active regimens were significantly greater than those
      assigned to placebo. Women assigned to CEE plus continuous MPA had significantly 
      greater increases in spinal BMD (increase of 5%) than those assigned to the other
      3 active regimens (average increase, 3.8%). Findings were similar among those
      adhering to assigned therapy, although, among adherent participants, there were
      no significant differences in BMD changes among the 4 active treatment groups.
      Older women, women with low initial BMD, and those with no previous hormone use
      gained significantly more bone than younger women, women with higher initial BMD,
      and those who had used hormones previously. CONCLUSIONS: Postmenopausal women
      assigned to placebo demonstrated decreased BMD at the spine and hip, whereas
      women assigned to estrogen therapy increased BMD during a 36-month period. These 
      findings demonstrate that estrogen replacement therapy increases BMD at
      clinically important sites.

TI  - A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study on the effect of 
      oral oestradiol on acute menopausal symptoms.
PG  - 115-23
AB  - Acute menopausal symptoms occur less frequently in Asian than in Caucasian women.
      Oestrogen replacement therapy has been shown to be effective in controlling acute
      symptoms in Caucasians, but the effect of oestrogens is not well documented in
      Asian women. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of
      the effect of oral oestradiol on the incidence of acute menopausal symptoms was
      conducted in 83 Hong Kong Chinese women who had experienced a surgical menopause.
      Although there was a significant increase in the oestradiol concentration with
      treatment compared with placebo (P < 0.001), there were no significant
      differences in the reporting of symptoms between the treatment and placebo
      groups. There is no obvious explanation for this apparent lack of effect of
      oestrogen on acute menopausal symptoms in Chinese women. Whilst it may be related
      to the generally low incidence of symptoms or to a higher dietary intake of
      phytoestrogens in Chinese women, further studies are necessary to explain these
      findings.

TI  - Efficacy and local tolerance of a low-dose, 7-day matrix estradiol transdermal
      system in the treatment of menopausal vasomotor symptoms.
PG  - 587-92
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and local tolerance of a new matrix
      transdermal drug-delivery system that delivers 0.02 mg of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) 
      daily for 7 days for the relief of vasomotor symptoms. METHODS: A total of 324
      surgically or naturally menopausal women, all with prior hysterectomy and
      moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms (56-140 hot flushes per week, with episodes
      of sweating, during a baseline observation period), participated in two
      independent, 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. After
      a 4-week, treatment-free period, each woman received a continuous regimen of
      either one E2 transdermal system, two E2 transdermal systems, or placebo
      transdermal system(s) applied every week for 12 weeks. Efficacy was measured as
      reduction in hot flush frequency, determined from subject diaries. To measure
      local tolerance, skin irritation (erythema and edema) was objectively and
      systematically evaluated under blue light after removal of the transdermal
      system(s). Serum E2 and estrone concentrations were determined in one of the
      studies during baseline and on days 1, 9, 30, 58, 79, and 84. RESULTS: Mean hot
      flush frequency decreased from 80 hot flushes per week at baseline to
      approximately 13 hot flushes per week (84% decrease) after 12 weeks of
      transdermal E2 treatment. Compared with placebo, the decrease in hot flush
      frequency was significant as early as weeks 2 and 3, and was maintained through
      the end of the study. Few clinically significant skin reactions occurred, and
      only nine (3%) of the subjects withdrew because of a skin effect. After initial
      increase, serum E2 concentrations remained stable throughout the study, achieving
      values of approximately 20 and 40 pg/mL above baseline for one and two E2
      transdermal systems, respectively. CONCLUSION: The E2 transdermal system
      effectively reduced the frequency of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms as
      early as the second week of therapy and was very well tolerated. The decrease in 
      hot flush frequency was similar to that reported for oral and other transdermal
      estrogens, but at lower serum E2 concentrations. This result may be due to the
      stable E2 blood level achieved with this transdermal system.

TI  - Cancer incidence and mortality in women receiving estrogen and estrogen-progestin
      replacement therapy--long-term follow-up of a Swedish cohort.
PG  - 327-32
AB  - We analyzed cancer incidence and mortality in a cohort of 22,597 Swedish women
      who were prescribed replacement hormones. After 13 years of follow-up in national
      registries, 2,330 incident cancer cases and 848 cancer deaths were observed.
      Overall, our results were reassuring since incidence rate ratios (SIRs) for 16
      cancer sites and mortality ratios (SMRs) for all 10 examined sites were at, or
      lower than, unity. However, we found that exposure to an estrogen-progestin
      combined brand was associated with an increasing relative risk of breast cancer
      with follow-up time, the SIR reaching 1.4 (95% CI 1.1-1.8) after 10 years of
      follow-up. The relative risk of endometrial cancer was substantially increased,
      with the highest SIR of 5.0 (95% CI 1.6-5.9) in women prescribed estrogens alone,
      whereas those given an estrogen-progestin combination showed no elevation in
      risk. The risk estimates for liver and biliary tract cancers and for colon cancer
      were reduced by about 40%, notably in women prescribed the estradiol-progestin
      compound. Further detailed analyses revealed no evidence of adverse or protective
      effects on the risk of ovarian, uterine cervical, vulvar/vaginal, rectal,
      pancreatic, renal, lung, thyroid and other endocrine cancers, brain tumors,
      malignant melanoma or other skin cancers. Hormone replacement therapy was not
      associated with an increase in mortality for any cancer site, at this time of
      follow-up. For breast and endometrial cancers, SMRs were below baseline but
      tended to increase with follow-up time. We conclude that hormone replacement
      increases the endometrial-cancer risk after unopposed estrogens and the
      breast-cancer risk-notably after estrogen-progestin combined therapy-and
      tentatively suggest that it exerts a protective effect against colon and liver
      cancer risks.

      A randomization error lead to the exclusion of six subjects but the soundness of 
      the remaining randomization was confirmed. SETTING: Large urban community.
      PATIENTS: Women 2-7 years after menopause with a uterus and ovaries, and not
      currently using hormone replacement therapy. Seventy-four women completed the
      trial. INTERVENTIONS: After baseline measures of quality of life, subjects were
      randomly assigned to either continuous oral conjugated equine estrogen 0.625 mg
      daily or continuous transdermal estradiol-17 beta 50 mcg twice weekly, for four
      4-week cycles. Medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg oral tablets was administered to
      both groups for the last 12 days of each cycle. OUTCOMES MEASURED: Quality of
      life was determined using the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire.
      Tolerability was determined by a specifically designed list of adverse effects.
      Both measures were recorded at base-line and in mid-cycle during the second,
      third and fourth cycles of treatment. RESULTS: There were no statistically
      significant differences in any of the domains at baseline between the oral and
      transdermal treatment groups. In the vasomotor domain-scores for the oral and
      transdermal groups improved from baseline levels of 3.14 and 3.09, respectively, 
      to 1.32 and 1.23; physical domain scores improved from 2.45 and 2.73 to 2.04 and 
      1.78; psychosocial domain scores improved from 2.72 and 3.04 to 2.21 and 1.94;
      sexual domain scores improved from 2.32 and 2.16 to 1.64 and 1.30. There were no 
      statistically significant group differences or time/group interactions. Both
      forms of therapy were equally well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Improvement in all
      domains, measured by the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire, was
      observed in both the oral and transdermal groups. In the absence of a placebo
      control group, the improvements observed cannot be attributed solely to the
      therapy. Neither form of therapy offered an advantage over the other in respect
      to improvement in quality of life.

TI  - Prophylaxis of osteoporosis with calcium, estrogens and/or eelcatonin:
      comparative longitudinal study of bone mass.
PG  - 327-32
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate three different therapeutic regimens for the prevention of
      osteoporosis in natural and surgical postmenopausal women who had been found to
      have rapid bone loss in analytical studies. METHODS: A total of 104 naturally or 
      surgically postmenopausal women were studied, and subsequently followed-up during
      1 year for avoidance of the influence of seasonal variation on bone mass, a
      factor overlooked in several studies. They were randomized into four groups of 26
      patients each: the untreated control group (mean age 50 +/- 5 years); the
      hormonal replacement treatment (HRT) group (mean age 48 +/- 6 years), which was
      treated for 24 days each month with transdermal 17 beta-estradiol, 50 mg/day,
      together with medroxiprogesterone, 10 mg during 12 days; the calcium group (mean 
      age 50 +/- 4 years), which was treated with elemental calcium, 1 g/day; and the
      calcitonin group (mean age 50 +/- 5 years), which was treated for 10 days each
      month with eel calcitonin, 40 IU/day and with elemental calcium, 500 mg/day.
      Full-body bone densitometry, for measuring total body bone mineral content
      (TBBMC), was carried out in all the women at baseline and 1 year. TBBMC was
      corrected for body weight by dividing its value by body weight (TBBMC/W).
      RESULTS: After 1 year TBBMC/W was lower in every group: -2.14% (P < 0.001) in the
      control group; -0.14% (P = NS) in the HRT group (P < 0.05 vs. controls); -0.18%
      (P = NS) in the calcium group (P < 0.05 vs. controls); and -0.06% (P = NS) in the
      calcitonin group (P < 0.01 vs. controls; P < 0.05 vs. calcium and HRT).
      CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that all three treatments are effective in the
      prevention of postmenopausal loss of bone mass.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerance of Menorest compared to Premarin in the treatment of
      postmenopausal women. A randomised, multicentre, double-blind, double-dummy
      study.
PG  - 105-14
AB  - Two-hundred and fourteen (214) menopausal women with moderate to severe vasomotor
      symptoms, aged 40-65 years, were randomised. After a 4-week treatment-free
      period, each women received a continuous regimen of Menorest 50 twice weekly or
      Premarin 0.625 mg daily, for 12 weeks. Didrogesterone 10 mg was also given to all
      women for 12 days of every 28-day cycle. The objectives were to compare the
      efficacy and safety profiles of Menorest and an oral estrogen. A statistically
      significant reduction in the mean number of hot flushes occurred in each group
      compared to baseline with a decrease from 7.1 at baseline to 0.9 at 12 weeks in
      the Menorest group, and from 6.7 to 0.5 in the oral estrogen group; there was no 
      statistically significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.36). With each
      successive treatment cycle, there was a continuous improvement in the number of
      hot flushes. The incidence and severity of menopausal symptoms were reduced in
      the same manner in both groups. There were no statistically significant
      differences in the mean plasma estradiol and estrone concentrations between the
      two treatment groups after 10 weeks of therapy. The mean estradiol to estrone
      ratio was similar in both groups, as was the number of adverse events observed.
      In summary, Menorest was as effective as an oral estrogen in alleviating
      menopausal symptoms.

TI  - Combined therapy with estrogen and etidronate has an additive effect on bone
      mineral density in the hip and vertebrae: four-year randomized study.
PG  - 36-42
AB  - BACKGROUND: Administration of estrogen or etidronate has been shown to increase
      bone mineral density in postmenopausal women. This 4-year, prospective,
      randomized study was carried out to monitor any added beneficial effect on bone
      mineral density when hormone-replacement therapy (HRT) was combined with
      etidronate. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-eight early postmenopausal women
      attending metabolic bone disease outpatient clinics were randomly allocated into 
      four treatment groups and monitored for up to 4 years. All patients received 1.0 
      g/d of elemental calcium. In addition, group 1 received percutaneously
      administered HRT (n = 15); group 2, intermittent cyclical etidronate (ICE) (n =
      14); group 3, HRT and ICE (n = 15); and group 4, calcium alone (n = 14). The bone
      mineral density (measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry), biochemical
      variables of bone turnover, including bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, and
      urinary hydroxyproline:creatinine ratios were measured before treatment and at 2 
      and 4 years after treatment. RESULTS: In patients who received the combined
      therapy, bone mineral density was increased in the vertebrae by 10.9% (P < 0.001)
      and in the femora by 7.25% (P < 0.001) at 4 years. For patients treated with ICE,
      the increase was 6.79% (P < 0.001) and 1.20% (P < 0.05), and with HRT, 6.78% (P <
      0.001) and 4.01% (P < 0.01) in the vertebrae and femora, respectively. The group 
      treated with calcium alone lost 3.81% (P < 0.01) and 4.96% (P < 0.01) of bone
      mineral density in vertebrae and femora. Patients who received no specific
      therapy lost 8.58% (P < 0.01) from vertebrae, and 7.83% (P < 0.01) from the
      femora over 4 years. Patients who received combined therapy had significantly
      higher bone mineral density in both vertebrae (P < 0.05) and femora (P < 0.01),
      in comparison to patients who were treated with HRT, or ICE, alone. Three of 9
      patients (33%) in the ICE group developed osteomalacia, as shown by bone
      histomorphometry, whereas in women who received combined HRT and ICE therapies,
      none of the 11 patients tested had evidence of bone mineralization defects.
      CONCLUSION: This 4-year, prospective, randomized study in early postmenopausal
      women showed an additive effect of ICE and HRT on the bone mineral density in
      both vertebrae and the hip. Furthermore, the combined therapy prevented the
      occurrence of osteomalacia associated with etidronate. This is the first study to
      demonstrate the effects of etidronate in early postmenopausal women, and the
      additive beneficial effects of HRT and ICE on bone mineral density.

TI  - Prospective evaluation of calcium and estrogen administration on bone mass and

PG  - 131-5
AB  - We evaluated the effects of low-dose ethinylestradiol administration in the
      prevention of the rapid bone loss that follows ovariectomy in women. After 10-30 
      days from surgery, patients received either a sole calcium supplementation 500
      mg/day (n = 20) or ethinylestradiol 20 micrograms/day in addition to the same
      daily calcium supplement (n = 21), for 12 months. In the control group, urinary
      hydroxyproline excretion, serum alkaline phosphatase and plasma bone Gla protein 
      levels presented a substantial (p < 0.05) increase, while radial bone density
      significantly (p < 0.05) decreased 6 months after surgery. In the
      ethinylestradiol-treated group, the patterns of biochemical markers indicated
      that ethinylestradiol can restrain the bone remodelling processes. Radial bone
      density showed no significant modification during the 12 months' study period. In
      conclusions, these results demonstrate that the administration of 20
      micrograms/day of ethinylestradiol can prevent the rapid bone loss that follows
      ovariectomy.

TI  - A quality of life perspective on who benefits from estradiol replacement therapy.
PG  - 367-72
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To examine who may benefit from estrogen replacement therapy
      from a quality of life (QoL) perspective, taking both disease-specific and
      general aspects at baseline into account. DESIGN: A double-blind multi-center
      randomized placebo-controlled prospective study. The subjects were randomized to 
      receive either transdermal estradiol or placebo for 12 weeks. QoL measures were
      disease-specific and generic. LOCATION: University hospital, teaching hospital
      and private practice. MATERIAL: Post-menopausal volunteering Swedish women (n =
      223) with mild to severe climacteric symptoms, as clinically evaluated by the
      Kupperman's Index. RESULTS: All QoL assessments showed highly significant
      improvement in the estradiol group in comparison with the placebo group. The
      women receiving placebo treatment also improved, but their improvement reached a 
      peak at six weeks of treatment and then declined. In the estradiol group the
      improvement continued throughout the 12 weeks. After 12 weeks of treatment the
      change in the placebo-treated group was smaller on the disease-specific scales
      than on the generic scales and the Kupperman's Index. A high correlation was seen
      between the baseline score for a certain QoL assessment and the change in this
      score during treatment. The most striking result was that the mean change in QoL 
      for the two groups was statistically significant for almost any pre-treatment QoL
      status. CONCLUSIONS: Women with slightly, moderately or severely diminished QoL
      status would benefit from estrogen treatment during the climacteric period. A
      similar tendency was seen in women with mild symptoms at baseline.

TI  - Hormone replacement therapy and endometrial cancer risk: a meta-analysis.
PG  - 304-13
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of unopposed estrogen or estrogen plus
      progestin and the risk of developing endometrial cancer or dying of that disease.
      DATA SOURCES: A literature search of English-language studies was performed using
      MEDLINE, a review of bibliographies, and consultations with experts. METHODS OF
      STUDY SELECTION: We identified 30 studies with adequate controls and risk
      estimates. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Risk estimates were extracted by two
      authors and summarized using meta-analytic methods. The summary relative risk
      (RR) was 2.3 for estrogen users compared to nonusers (95% confidence interval
      [CI] 2.1-2.5), with a much higher RR associated with prolonged duration of use
      (RR 9.5 for 10 or more years). The summary RR of endometrial cancer remained
      elevated 5 or more years after discontinuation of unopposed estrogen therapy (RR 
      2.3). Interrupting estrogen for 5-7 days per month was not associated with lower 
      risk than daily use. Users of unopposed conjugated estrogen had a greater
      increase in RR of developing endometrial cancer than users of synthetic
      estrogens. The risk for endometrial cancer death was elevated among unopposed
      estrogen users (RR 2.7, 95% CI 0.9-8.0). Among estrogen plus progestin users,
      cohort studies showed a decreased risk of endometrial cancer (RR 0.4), whereas
      case-control studies showed a small increase (RR 1.8). CONCLUSIONS: Endometrial
      cancer risk increases substantially with long duration of unopposed estrogen use,
      and this increased risk persists for several years after discontinuation of
      estrogen. Although not statistically significant, the risk of death from
      endometrial cancer among unopposed estrogen users is increased, similar to the
      increased risk of developing the disease. Data regarding risk for endometrial
      cancer among estrogen plus progestin users are limited and conflicting.

TI  - Prevention of early postmenopausal bone loss using low doses of conjugated
      estrogens and the non-hormonal, bone-active drug ipriflavone.
PG  - 462-6
AB  - Hormone replacement therapy is the optimal therapeutic choice for postmenopausal 
      syndrome. While low doses of estrogens (0.3 mg/day of conjugated estrogens) can
      counteract neurovegetative menopausal symptoms, higher doses (0.625 mg/day of
      conjugated estrogens) are required to prevent bone loss in postmenopausal women. 
      Experimental and clinical studies have shown that ipriflavone, a non-hormonal
      isoflavone derivative, is effective in the prevention and treatment of
      postmenopausal osteoporosis. The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate
      the efficacy and tolerability of ipriflavone and very low doses of equine
      conjugated estrogens on bone loss in early postmenopausal women. Eighty-three
      healthy postmenopausal women (50.3 +/- 0.7 years) were enrolled for this 1-year
      multicenter study. All subjects were randomly allocated to receive: double
      placebo (n = 24; group A), placebo plus conjugated equine estrogens 0.30 mg/day
      (n = 31; group B) or conjugated equine estrogens 0.30 mg/day plus oral
      ipriflavone 200 mg tris in die at meals (n = 28; group C), according to a
      double-masked design. Among women who completed the treatment period (valid
      completers), those of group A showed a progressive decrease in forearm bone
      density (FBD; measured by dual photon absorptiometry) that reached 1.7% after 12 
      months. The women in group B maintained their FBD in the first 6 months of
      treatment but, at the end of the study, showed a bone loss of 1.4% compared with 
      basal values. By contrast, women in group C showed a significant increase in FBD 
      after 1 year of treatment (+5.6%; p < 0.01). Both valid completers and intention 
      to treat analyses revealed a significant difference (p < 0.05) between group A
      and group C over the study period. None of the treatments produced significant
      changes of biochemical markers of bone turnover, while hot flushes and other
      climacteric symptoms were significantly reduced after the sixth month of
      treatment in women receiving estrogens. Adverse events were generally mild, and
      did not differ among the groups. The results of this study suggest that low doses
      of estrogens combined with ipriflavone could represent a new therapeutic approach
      to the treatment of the postmenopausal syndrome.

TI  - Calcium supplementation with and without hormone replacement therapy to prevent
      postmenopausal bone loss.
PG  - 97-103
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether augmentation of dietary calcium is effective in
      the prevention of early postmenopausal bone loss. DESIGN: Three-arm,
      placebo-controlled, randomized parallel trial. The study duration was 2.9 +/- 1.1
      (SD) years. SETTING: General community. PARTICIPANTS: 118 healthy, white women 3 
      to 6 years after spontaneous menopause, recruited by community announcement.
      INTERVENTIONS: Random allocation to daily intake of 1700 mg of calcium (calcium
      carbonate given in divided doses with meals); placebo; or conjugated equine
      estrogens (0.625 mg; days 1 to 25), progesterone (10 mg; days 16 to 25), and 1700
      mg of elemental calcium daily. Each participant received 400 IU of vitamin D
      daily. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total body calcium measured by delayed gamma
      neutron activation analysis and whole-body counting; bone mineral density of the 
      spine, femur, and radius measured by photon absorptiometry. RESULTS: Bone mineral
      density declined in the placebo group for the lumbar spine (-2.1%/y; 95% Cl, -3.3
      to -0.9), femoral neck (-2.0%/y; Cl, -2.6 to -1.2), trochanter (-1.6%/y; Cl, -2.4
      to -0.8), Ward triangle (-2.7%/y; Cl, -3.7 to -1.7), and total body calcium
      (-2.0%/y; Cl, -2.2 to -1.8). Rates of change were intermediate for calcium
      augmentation compared with placebo and estrogen-progesterone-calcium but
      statistically significant compared with placebo for total body calcium (-0.5%/y; 
      Cl, -0.9 to -0.1; P = 0.006) and the femoral neck (-0.8%/y; Cl, -1.4 to -0.2; P =
      0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Although less effective than estrogen-progesterone-calcium,
      calcium augmentation alone significantly retards bone loss from the femoral neck 
      and improves calcium balance in recently postmenopausal women. Dietary calcium
      augmentation should be recommended as a strategic option in helping to prevent
      early postmenopausal bone loss.

TI  - Postmenopausal hormone use and cholecystectomy in a large prospective study.
PG  - 5-11
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between postmenopausal hormone use and
      cholecystectomy. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was performed, with
      follow-up every 2 years. Participants were 54,845 postmenopausal United States
      nurses, who reported both hormone use and cholecystectomy on mailed
      questionnaires. RESULTS: Cholecystectomy was reported by 1750 women during 8
      years of follow-up. After adjusting for confounding factors, women currently
      using postmenopausal hormones were at an increased risk of cholecystectomy
      (relative risk [RR] 2.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.9-2.4) compared to
      never-users. For current users, the risk of cholecystectomy increased with
      increasing duration of hormone use (RR 2.6, 95% CI 2.2-3.1 for 10 years or more) 
      and higher doses of estrogen (RR 2.4, 95% CI 2.0-2.9 for users of 1.25 mg or
      more). Although the risk for past hormone users decreased substantially in women 
      who had discontinued use 1-2.9 years ago (RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.0), a small risk
      persisted for women who had stopped taking hormones 5 or more years previously
      (RR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.6). However, after controlling for time since last use,
      duration of past use had little or no effect on the risk of cholecystectomy (RR
      1.4 and RR 1.7 for past users of less than 2 years and 10 or more years'
      duration, respectively). CONCLUSION: Women using postmenopausal hormones are at
      an increased risk of cholecystectomy. Women and their physicians should consider 
      the spectrum of risks and benefits when deciding whether to take hormones.

TI  - [Double-blind method of the effect of menopause symptoms, lipid profile, and
      endometrial thickness of continuous therapy with estradiol valerate and
      medroxyprogesterone acetate].
PG  - 354-60
AB  - Continuous combined therapy (CCT) using estrogens and progestagens has appeared
      as an alternative to avoid vaginal bleeding, which is characteristic of
      sequential hormone therapy, and the main reason for the stopping treatment.
      Irregular vaginal bleeding can occur at the beginning of treatment, but it has
      been observed that after a few months patients are in amenorrhea. Fifty
      postmenopausal women were studied in order to evaluate the clinical outcome. Half
      of them were treated with a product containing 2 mg estradiol valerate and 2.5 mg
      medroxiprogesterone acetate, while the other half received a placebo. Menopause
      symptomatology was recorded as described by Blatt-Kupperman, depression was
      evaluated with the use of Hamilton's test, lipid profile by enzymatic methods and
      endometrial thickness by transvaginal ultrasonography. Patients were evaluated at
      the beginning, third and sixth month of the study, following a double blind
      methodology. Symptomatology diminished both in patients under CCT and using
      placebo, although improvement was significantly greater in patient under CCT.
      Thus in the hormone treated group the Blatt-Kupperman score fell from 12.1 to 6.4
      and 3.2 in the third and sixth month respectively, while in the group receiving
      placebo the score fell from 11.5 to 6.3 in the third month and raised to 7.4 in
      the sixth month. Hamilton's test showed a significant improvement of depression
      only in patients under hormone therapy. Nineteen out of twenty five women using
      CCT had vaginal bleeding, showing no changes in the endometrial thickness during 
      the study. Finally, HDL-cholesterol was raised in 14.5% while LDL-cholesterol was
      lowered in 18.7% (p < 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

PG  - 911-6
AB  - A three-year prospective study was carried out in 283 postmenopausal women to
      evaluate the effects of a long-acting estriol derivative-nylestriol. The women
      were randomly assigned into 3 groups: group A (136 cases, nylestriol 2 mg/2 wk), 
      group B (97, nylestriol 1 mg/2 wk) and group C (50, placebo/2wk). LDL-C decreased
      and HDL-C increased after 3 months of medication (P < 0.05), but TC and TG not
      significantly changed in any group (P > 0.05). No changes of lipids were found in
      group C (P > 0.05). Serum ALP, Ca/Cr and Hpr/Cr in fasting urine decreased in 3
      months in both group A and B (P < 0.05), but not in group C (P > 0.05). Forearm
      bone mineral content loss was restrained in groups A and B (P > 0.05), but
      decreased markedly in group C (P < 0.01). The Kupperman index scores decreased by
      about 50% after 3 months and 80% in 12 months in groups A and B. Nylestriol
      induced mild stimulatory effect on the uterine endometrium, and addition of 6 mg 
      of provera daily for 7-10 days every 6 months is recommended. Nylestriol
      exhibited no obvious effect on the breast. This study demonstrated that
      nylestriol can be used as an effective and acceptable estrogen replacement
      therapy for postmenopausal women.

TI  - Is sexual life influenced by transdermal estrogen therapy? A double blind placebo
      controlled study in postmenopausal women.
PG  - 656-60
AB  - Two hundred and forty-two postmenopausal women between 45 and 65 years of age
      requiring hormone replacement therapy for climacteric symptoms were blindly and
      randomly allocated to treatment either with transdermal estradiol therapy
      (Estraderm 50 micrograms/24h) (E) or placebo (P). The patches were changed twice 
      a week and treatment continued for 12 weeks. No progestogen supplement therapy
      was given during the study. No previous hormone replacement therapy had been
      given for the last six months and the women had had their last menstruation more 
      than six months ago. As a part of a larger study assessing women's quality of
      life, a Swedish version of 'McCoy's Sex Scale Questionnaire' was administered at 
      the start of treatment and after 12 weeks. This questionnaire contains nine items
      regarding different aspects of sexual life. The difference between the scorings
      at the start of treatment and after 12 weeks were calculated for each item and
      the values of the E and the P groups were compared. Items regarding 'satisfaction
      with frequency of sexual activity, sexual fantasies, degree of enjoyment, vaginal
      lubrication and pain during intercourse' were positively influenced in the E
      group compared to the P group. Items not affected were 'frequency of orgasm and
      sexual arousal'. A correlation between improved sexual life and quality of life
      was also found when the results from the McCoy scale were compared with a battery
      of quality of life questionnaires.
