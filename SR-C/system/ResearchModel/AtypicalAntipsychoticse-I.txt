TI  - Effectiveness and cost of olanzapine and haloperidol in the treatment of
      schizophrenia: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 2693-702
AB  - CONTEXT: Although olanzapine has been widely adopted as a treatment of choice for
      schizophrenia, its long-term effectiveness and costs have not been evaluated in a
      controlled trial in comparison with a standard antipsychotic drug. OBJECTIVE: To 
      evaluate the effectiveness and cost impact of olanzapine compared with
      haloperidol in the treatment of schizophrenia. DESIGN AND SETTING: Double-blind, 
      randomized controlled trial with randomization conducted between June 1998 and
      June 2000 at 17 US Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers. PARTICIPANTS: 
      Three hundred nine patients with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
      Disorders, Fourth Edition diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder,
      serious symptoms, and serious dysfunction for the previous 2 years. Fifty-nine
      percent fully completed and 36% partially completed follow-up assessments.
      INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive flexibly dosed
      olanzapine, 5 to 20 mg/d, with prophylactic benztropine, 1 to 4 mg/d (n = 159);
      or haloperidol, 5 to 20 mg/d (n = 150), for 12 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
      Standardized measures of symptoms, quality of life, neurocognitive status, and
      adverse effects of medication. Veterans Affairs administrative data and
      interviews concerning non-VA service use were used to estimate costs from the
      perspective of the VA health care system and society as a whole (ie, consumption 
      of all resources on behalf of these patients). RESULTS: There were no significant
      differences between groups in study retention; positive, negative, or total
      symptoms of schizophrenia; quality of life; or extrapyramidal symptoms.
      Olanzapine was associated with reduced akathisia in the intention-to-treat
      analysis (P<.001) and with lower symptoms of tardive dyskinesia in a secondary
      analysis including only observations during blinded treatment with study drug.
      Small but significant advantages were also observed on measures of memory and
      motor function. Olanzapine was also associated with more frequent reports of
      weight gain and significantly greater VA costs, ranging from 3000 dollars to 9000
      dollars annually. Differences in societal costs were somewhat smaller and were
      not significant. CONCLUSION: Olanzapine does not demonstrate advantages compared 
      with haloperidol (in combination with prophylactic benztropine) in compliance,
      symptoms, extrapyramidal symptoms, or overall quality of life, and its benefits
      in reducing akathisia and improving cognition must be balanced with the problems 
      of weight gain and higher cost.

TI  - A placebo-controlled, double-blind study of the efficacy and safety of
      aripiprazole in patients with acute bipolar mania.
PG  - 1651-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors compared the efficacy and safety of aripiprazole, a novel 
      antipsychotic, to placebo for treatment of patients in an acute manic or mixed
      episode of bipolar disorder. METHOD: This 3-week, multicenter, double-blind study
      randomly assigned 262 bipolar disorder patients in an acute manic or mixed
      episode to aripiprazole, 30 mg/day (reduced to 15 mg/day if needed for
      tolerability), or placebo. Patients remained hospitalized for at least 2 of the
      weeks. The primary efficacy measure was mean change from baseline in total score 
      on the Young Mania Rating Scale; response was defined as a decrease in score of >
      or =50%. RESULTS: Aripiprazole produced statistically significant mean
      improvements in total score on the Young Mania Rating Scale compared with placebo
      (-8.2 versus -3.4, respectively) and produced a significantly higher response
      rate (40% versus 19%). For key efficacy variables (response per Young Mania
      Rating Scale; Clinical Global Impression-Bipolar Version scores for severity of
      illness [mania] and change from preceding phase [mania]), aripiprazole separated 
      from placebo by day 4. The completion rate was significantly higher with
      aripiprazole than with placebo (42% versus 21%). Discontinuations due to adverse 
      events did not differ significantly between the aripiprazole and placebo groups. 
      There were no significant changes in body weight versus placebo, and aripiprazole
      was not associated with elevated serum prolactin or QTc prolongation.
      CONCLUSIONS: Aripiprazole had significantly greater efficacy than placebo for the
      treatment of bipolar disorder patients in acute manic or mixed episodes and was
      safe and well tolerated in this randomized controlled trial.

TI  - Randomized trial of olanzapine versus placebo in the symptomatic acute treatment 
      of the schizophrenic prodrome.
PG  - 453-64
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prodromal phase of schizophrenic disorders has been described
      prospectively. The present study aimed to determine the short-term efficacy and
      safety of olanzapine treatment of prodromal symptoms compared with placebo.
      METHODS: This was a double-blind, randomized, parallel-groups, placebo-controlled
      trial with fixed-flexible dosing conducted at four sites. Sixty patients met
      prodromal diagnostic criteria, including attenuated psychotic symptoms, as
      determined by structured interviews. Olanzapine 5-15 mg daily or placebo was
      prescribed for 8 weeks. RESULTS: In the mixed-effects, repeated-measures
      analysis, the treatment x time interaction for the change from baseline on the
      Scale of Prodromal Symptoms total score was statistically significant, and post
      hoc analyses revealed that the olanzapine-placebo difference reached p<.10 by
      week 6 and p<.05 at week 8. Ratings of extrapyramidal symptoms remained low in
      each group and were not significantly different. Olanzapine patients gained 9.9
      lb versus.7 lb for placebo patients (p<.001). CONCLUSIONS: This short-term
      analysis suggests olanzapine is associated with significantly greater symptomatic
      improvement but significantly greater weight gain than is placebo in prodromal
      patients. Extrapyramidal symptoms with olanzapine were minimal and similar to
      those with placebo. Future research over the longer term with more patients will 
      be needed before recommendations can be made regarding routine treatment.

TI  - Predicting suicidal risk in schizophrenic and schizoaffective patients in a
      prospective two-year trial.
PG  - 444-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: Enhanced ability to reliably identify risk factors for suicidal
      behavior permits more focused decisions concerning treatment interventions and
      support services, with potential reduction in lives lost to suicide. METHODS:
      This study followed 980 patients at high risk for suicide in a multicenter
      prospective study for 2 years after randomization to clozapine or olanzapine. A
      priori predictors related to diagnosis, treatment resistance, and clinical
      constructs of disease symptoms were evaluated as possible predictors of
      subsequent suicide-related events. RESULTS: Ten baseline univariate predictors
      were identified. Historical predictors were diagnosis of schizoaffective
      disorder, history or current use at baseline of alcohol or substance abuse,
      cigarette smoking, number of lifetime suicide attempts, and the number of
      hospitalizations in the previous 36 months to prevent suicide. Predictive
      clinical features included greater baseline scores on the InterSePT scale for
      suicidal thinking, the Covi Anxiety Scale, the Calgary Depression Scale (CDS),
      and severity of Parkinsonism. Subsequent multivariate analysis revealed the
      number of hospitalizations in the previous 36 months, baseline CDS, severity of
      Parkinson's, history of substance abuse, and lifetime suicide attempts.
      Clozapine, in general, was more effective than olanzapine in decreasing the risk 
      of suicidality, regardless of risk factors present. CONCLUSIONS: This is the
      first prospective analysis of predictors of suicide risk in a large schizophrenic
      and schizoaffective population judged to be at high risk for suicide. Assessment 
      of these risk factors may aid clinicians in evaluating risk for suicidal
      behaviors so that appropriate interventions can be made.

TI  - The National Institute of Mental Health Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of
      Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) project: schizophrenia trial design and
      protocol development.
PG  - 15-31
AB  - The National Institute of Mental Health initiated the Clinical Antipsychotic
      Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) program to evaluate the
      effectiveness of antipsychotic drugs in typical settings and populations so that 
      the study results will be maximally useful in routine clinical situations. The
      CATIE schizophrenia trial blends features of efficacy studies and large, simple
      trials to create a pragmatic trial that will provide extensive information about 
      antipsychotic drug effectiveness over at least 18 months. The protocol allows for
      subjects who receive a study drug that is not effective to receive subsequent
      treatments within the context of the study. Medication dosages are adjusted
      within a defined range according to clinical judgment. The primary outcome is
      all-cause treatment discontinuation because it represents an important clinical
      endpoint that reflects both clinician and patient judgments about efficacy and
      tolerability. Secondary outcomes include symptoms, side effects, neurocognitive
      functioning, and cost-effectiveness. Approximately 50 clinical sites across the
      United States are seeking to enroll a total of 1,500 persons with schizophrenia. 
      Phase 1 is a double-blinded randomized clinical trial comparing treatment with
      the second generation antipsychotics olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and
      ziprasidone to perphenazine, a midpotency first generation antipsychotic. If the 
      initially assigned medication is not effective, subjects may choose one of the
      following phase 2 trials: (1) randomization to open-label clozapine or a
      double-blinded second generation drug that was available but not assigned in
      phase 1; or (2) double-blinded randomization to ziprasidone or another second
      generation drug that was available but not assigned in phase 1. If the phase 2
      study drug is discontinued, subjects may enter phase 3, in which clinicians help 
      subjects select an open-label treatment based on individuals' experiences in
      phases 1 and 2.

TI  - Maintenance treatment of schizophrenia with risperidone or haloperidol: 2-year
      outcomes.
PG  - 1405-12
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Most controlled studies comparing second-generation and conventional
      antipsychotics have focused on the acute treatment of schizophrenia. The authors 
      compared symptom outcomes, side effects, and social adjustment in stable
      schizophrenia outpatients who received 2 years of maintenance treatment with
      risperidone or haloperidol. METHOD: This was a 2-year, randomized, double-blind
      comparison of 6 mg of risperidone versus haloperidol in 63 patients with
      stabilized DSM-IV schizophrenia. Study patients also received 15 months of
      standard behavioral skills training or enhanced training with a case manager who 
      promoted patients' use of their skills in the community. RESULTS: The risk of
      psychotic exacerbations and the risk of leaving the study were similar for both
      drug treatment groups. However, patients who received both risperidone and the
      enhanced community-based skills training were more likely to remain in the study 
      than those in the other treatment groups. Patients demonstrated significant
      improvement in score on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale over time with both
      medications. There were no between-group differences in cluster scores for
      thought disturbance, hostile-suspiciousness, and withdrawal-retardation. A
      significant between-group difference favoring risperidone was found for the
      anxious-depression cluster. Risperidone resulted in significantly greater
      reductions in tremor and akathisia and greater improvements in most items on the 
      SCL-90-R. CONCLUSIONS: When compared with patients given a low dose of
      haloperidol, risperidone-treated patients experienced similar improvements in
      positive and negative symptoms and similar risks of psychotic exacerbations.
      However, risperidone-treated patients appeared to feel subjectively better, as
      indicated by less anxiety and depression and fewer extrapyramidal side effects.

TI  - Comparative efficacy and safety of atypical and conventional antipsychotic drugs 
      in first-episode psychosis: a randomized, double-blind trial of olanzapine versus
      haloperidol.
PG  - 1396-404
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Few long-term studies have compared the efficacy and safety of typical
      and atypical antipsychotic medications directly in patients with a first episode 
      of psychosis who met the criteria for schizophrenia or a related psychotic
      disorder. This study compared the acute and long-term effectiveness of
      haloperidol with that of olanzapine in patients with first-episode psychosis in a
      large, controlled clinical trial. METHOD: Patients with first-episode psychosis
      (N=263) were randomly assigned under double-blind conditions to receive
      haloperidol or olanzapine and were followed for up to 104 weeks. Domains measured
      included psychopathology, psychosocial variables, neurocognitive functioning, and
      brain morphology and metabolism. This report presents data from clinical measures
      of treatment response and safety data from the 12-week acute treatment phase.
      RESULTS: Haloperidol and olanzapine were associated with substantial and
      comparable baseline-to-endpoint reductions in symptom severity, which did not
      differ significantly in last-observation-carried-forward analyses. However, in a 
      mixed-model analysis, olanzapine-treated subjects had significantly greater
      decreases in symptom severity as measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome
      Scale total score and negative and general scales and by the Montgomery-Asberg
      Depression Rating Scale but not as measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome
      Scale positive scale and by the Clinical Global Impression severity rating.
      Olanzapine-treated patients experienced a lower rate of treatment-emergent
      parkinsonism and akathisia but had significantly more weight gain, compared with 
      the haloperidol-treated patients. Overall, significantly more olanzapine-treated 
      subjects than haloperidol-treated subjects completed the 12-week acute phase of
      the study (67% versus 54%). CONCLUSIONS: As expected on the basis of previous
      studies, both olanzapine and haloperidol were effective in the acute reduction of
      psychopathological symptoms in this group of patients with first-episode
      psychosis. However, olanzapine had several relative advantages in therapeutic
      response. Although the nature of adverse events differed between the two agents, 
      retention in the study was greater with olanzapine. Retention in treatment is
      important in this patient population, given their risk of relapse. Longer-term
      results are needed to determine whether treatment with atypical antipsychotics
      results in superior outcomes for a first episode of schizophrenia.

TI  - Differential effect of quetiapine on depressive symptoms in patients with
      partially responsive schizophrenia.
PG  - 210-5
AB  - While atypical antipsychotics appear to be effective in reducing depressive
      symptoms in the acute phase of schizophrenia, little is known about their
      efficacy in patients with ongoing symptoms. The present study assessed whether
      quetiapine (Seroquel) is more effective than haloperidol in treating depressive
      symptoms in patients with persistent positive symptoms, and investigated whether 
      this effect is independent, or secondary to, reductions in other symptoms such as
      positive, negative or extrapyramidal symptoms. Patients with schizophrenia and a 
      history of partial refractoriness to conventional antipsychotics who had not
      responded to 4 weeks of fluphenazine treatment (20 mg/day) were randomized to
      receive either quetiapine (600 mg/day) or haloperidol (20 mg/day) for a further 8
      weeks. Change in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale depression factor score
      from baseline to endpoint was calculated and path analyses were performed on data
      from 269 patients. Quetiapine produced a greater reduction in depressive scores
      than haloperidol (-1.60 versus -0.54; p = 0.006). The path analyses indicated
      that this was a direct effect on depressive symptoms. These findings extend the
      evidence for an antidepressant effect for the novel antipsychotics in
      schizophrenia, and suggest that this is not limited to acutely psychotic
      patients.

TI  - Olanzapine versus divalproex sodium for the treatment of acute mania and
      maintenance of remission: a 47-week study.
PG  - 1263-71
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Few double-blind trials have compared longer-term efficacy and safety 
      of medications for bipolar disorder. The authors report a 47-week comparison of
      olanzapine and divalproex. METHOD: This 47-week, randomized, double-blind study
      compared flexibly dosed olanzapine (5-20 mg/day) to divalproex (500-2500 mg/day) 
      for manic or mixed episodes of bipolar disorder (N=251). The only other
      psychoactive medication allowed was lorazepam for agitation. The primary efficacy
      instrument was the Young Mania Rating Scale; a priori protocol-defined threshold 
      scores were > or =20 for inclusion, < or =12 for remission, and > or = 15 for
      relapse. Analytical techniques included mixed model repeated-measures analysis of
      variance for change from baseline, Fisher's exact test (two-tailed) for
      categorical comparisons, and Kaplan-Meier estimates of time to events of
      interest. RESULTS: Over 47 weeks, mean improvement in Young Mania Rating Scale
      score was significantly greater for the olanzapine group. Median time to
      symptomatic mania remission was significantly shorter for olanzapine, 14 days,
      than for divalproex, 62 days. There were no significant differences between
      treatments in the rates of symptomatic mania remission over the 47 weeks (56.8%
      and 45.5%, respectively) and subsequent relapse into mania or depression (42.3%
      and 56.5%). Treatment-emergent adverse events occurring significantly more
      frequently during olanzapine treatment were somnolence, dry mouth, increased
      appetite, weight gain, akathisia, and high alanine aminotransferase levels; those
      for divalproex were nausea and nervousness. CONCLUSIONS: In this 47-week study of
      acute bipolar mania, symptomatic remission occurred sooner and overall mania
      improvement was greater for olanzapine than for divalproex, but rates of bipolar 
      relapse did not differ.

TI  - Relapse prevention in schizophrenia with new-generation antipsychotics: a
      systematic review and exploratory meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials.
PG  - 1209-22
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies
      of the potential of new-generation antipsychotic drugs to improve adherence and
      decrease relapse rates in patients with schizophrenia. METHOD: Randomized,
      controlled trials comparing new-generation antipsychotic drugs with placebo
      and/or conventional antipsychotics were identified. Data on relapse, general
      treatment failure, and dropout due to adverse events were extracted and combined 
      in a meta-analysis. RESULTS: Because few trials were available for each
      individual drug, the effects of new-generation antipsychotic drugs as a group
      were analyzed. The analysis of six placebo comparisons, involving a total of 983 
      patients, clearly demonstrated that new-generation antipsychotic drugs are
      effective for relapse prevention. Eleven studies with a total of 2,032 patients
      provided comparative data on relapse/treatment failure for new-generation and
      conventional antipsychotics. The analysis revealed that rates of relapse and
      overall treatment failure were modestly but significantly lower with the newer
      drugs. Whether this advantage was partly mediated by improved adherence to
      treatment remains unclear. No significant superiority in terms of fewer dropouts 
      due to adverse events was found for the newer drugs. Furthermore, a number of
      methodological problems were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the currently
      available data suggest that new-generation antipsychotics have the potential to
      reduce relapse rates. Methodological issues to be addressed in future trials
      include the choice of comparator, use of appropriate doses, application of
      clinically relevant relapse criteria, monitoring of adherence, and minimization
      of dropouts.

TI  - A double-blind comparison of olanzapine versus risperidone in the acute treatment
      of dementia-related behavioral disturbances in extended care facilities.
PG  - 726-30
AB  - BACKGROUND: In addition to demonstrating their superiority to placebo, there is a
      need to compare the relative efficacy and side effects of atypical neuroleptics
      for the acute treatment of dementia-related behavioral disturbances in residents 
      of long-term care facilities. METHOD: In a double-blind parallel study allowing
      dose titration over 14 days, 39 agitated persons with DSM-IV dementia who were
      residing in long-term care facilities were administered olanzapine (N = 20) or
      risperidone (N = 19) as acute treatment. Drug was administered once a day at
      bedtime. The initial dosages were olanzapine, 2.5 mg/day, and risperidone, 0.5
      mg/day. Titration was allowed to maximum doses of olanzapine, 10 mg/day, and
      risperidone, 2.0 mg/day. The primary outcome measures were the Clinical Global
      Impressions scale (CGI) and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Data were
      gathered from 2000 to 2002. RESULTS: Both drugs produced significant reductions
      in CGI and NPI scores (p <.0001), but there was no significant difference between
      drugs. The mean olanzapine dose was 6.65 mg/day; for risperidone, the dose was
      1.47 mg/day. The positive drug effect was not accompanied by decreased mobility, 
      and there was improvement on a quality-of-life measure. The chief adverse events 
      were drowsiness and falls. At baseline, 42% (16/38) of subjects in both groups
      had extrapyramidal symptoms that increased slightly, but not significantly, by
      the end of the study. CONCLUSION: Low-dose, once-a-day olanzapine and risperidone
      appear to be equally safe and equally effective in the treatment of
      dementia-related behavioral disturbances in residents of extended care
      facilities.

TI  - A meta-analysis of the efficacy of second-generation antipsychotics.
PG  - 553-64
AB  - BACKGROUND: Consensus panel recommendations regarding choice of an antipsychotic 
      agent for schizophrenia differ markedly, but most consider second-generation
      antipsychotics (SGAs) as a homogeneous group. It has been suggested that SGAs
      seem falsely more efficacious than first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) as a
      result of reduced efficacy due to use of a high-dose comparator, haloperidol. We 
      performed (1) a meta-analysis of randomized efficacy trials comparing SGAs and
      FGAs, (2) comparisons between SGAs, (3) a dose-response analysis of FGAs and
      SGAs, and (4) an analysis of the effect on efficacy of an overly high dose of an 
      FGA comparator. METHODS: Literature search of clinical trials between January
      1953 and May 2002 of patients with schizophrenia from electronic databases,
      reference lists, posters, the Food and Drug Administration, and other unpublished
      data. We included 124 randomized controlled trials with efficacy data on 10 SGAs 
      vs FGAs and 18 studies of comparisons between SGAs. Two of us independently
      extracted the sample sizes, means, and standard deviation of the efficacy data.
      RESULTS: Using the Hedges-Olkin algorithm, the effect sizes of clozapine,
      amisulpride, risperidone, and olanzapine were 0.49, 0.29, 0.25, and 0.21 greater 
      than those of FGAs, with P values of 2 x 10-8, 3 x 10-7, 2 x 10-12, and 3 x 10-9,
      respectively. The remaining 6 SGAs were not significantly different from FGAs,
      although zotepine was marginally different. No efficacy difference was detected
      among amisulpride, risperidone, and olanzapine. We found no evidence that the
      haloperidol dose (or all FGA comparators converted to haloperidol-equivalent
      doses) affected these results when we examined its effect by drug or in a 2-way
      analysis of variance model in which SGA effectiveness is entered as a second
      factor. CONCLUSION: Some SGAs are more efficacious than FGAs, and, therefore,
      SGAs are not a homogeneous group.

      medications.
PG  - 589-605
AB  - To assess the cost and effectiveness of risperidone, olanzapine, and conventional
      antipsychotic medications under "usual practice" conditions in a large, public
      mental health system, 108 persons diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective
      disorder were randomly assigned to one of these three medication groups and
      followed prospectively over a 12-month period using standard instruments and
      procedures. Psychiatric medication costs increased more over time in both the
      olanzapine and risperidone groups than in the conventional medication group.
      Compliance with the prescribed medication was higher in the olanzapine group than
      in the conventional group. No differential effects by medication group were
      evident in this sample on the symptoms of schizophrenia, side effects,
      psychosocial functioning, time to discharge for index hospitalization, survival
      to initial rehospitalization, or client satisfaction with services. These results
      extend findings from previous efficacy and naturalistic studies in several ways
      but are limited chiefly by the small number of subjects who completed 6 to 12
      months of the clinical trial, and the resulting power to detect differences in
      the statistical analyses.

TI  - Safety, effectiveness, and quality of life of olanzapine in first-episode
      schizophrenia: a naturalistic study.
PG  - 667-74
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the effectiveness, safety, and quality of life
      (Qol) offered by olanzapine in first-episode schizophrenia. METHOD: One hundred
      and eighty-two patients with first-episode schizophrenia (ICD-10) drawn from a
      larger, naturalistic, study were evaluated after 6 months of treatment with
      olanzapine, risperidone, or conventional antipsychotics (CA). Clinical status was
      assessed using the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) and Global
      Assessment of Function (GAF). AWAD and EuroQol scales were used to evaluate
      patients' attitude towards medication and Qol, respectively. RESULTS: Subjects
      treated with olanzapine, risperidone, and CA showed similar improvements on CGI-S
      and GAF. Treatment-emergent, extrapyramidal symptoms were significantly lower in 
      olanzapine-treated patients (17.8%) than in the risperidone (46.4%) and CA
      (62.2%) groups. Compared to CA, olanzapine and risperidone showed significantly
      greater improvement on the visual analog scale of EuroQol. Olanzapine-treated
      patients also showed significantly improved AWAD scores. CONCLUSIONS: In
      first-episode schizophrenia, atypical antipsychotics were effective, and improved
      Qol. Olanzapine had a lower incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms and better
      subjective acceptance of medication.

TI  - The impact upon extra-pyramidal side effects, clinical symptoms and quality of
      life of a switch from conventional to atypical antipsychotics (risperidone or
      olanzapine) in elderly patients with schizophrenia.
PG  - 432-40
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atypical antipsychotics are commonly used in the management of
      schizophrenia in late life with evidence suggesting they induce lower rates of
      motor disturbance, but have similar efficacy to conventional antipsychotics.
      Trials in the elderly have been either retrospective, small, of short duration or
      of a single-arm design. AIMS: To demonstrate the effects upon motor side-effects,
      efficacy, safety and quality of life (QOL) of switching elderly patients with
      schizophrenia from conventional antipsychotics to olanzapine or risperidone.
      METHODS: Elderly patients with schizophrenia were randomly allocated to
      olanzapine or risperidone and followed through an open-label crossover period.
      Between and within group intention to treat analyses were conducted. RESULTS: 66 
      patients were randomised (mean age 69.6 [SD +/- 6.2]). Four (11.8%) patients on
      olanzapine and 8 (26.7%) patients on risperidone failed to complete the crossover
      because of treatment failure [Odds Ratio (OR) = 2.73[0.73-10.2] p = 0.14]. The
      mean doses upon completion of switching in each arm were 9.9 mg (SD = 4.2) and
      1.7 mg (SD = 1.2) for olanzapine and risperidone respectively. In both arms there
      was improvement in Parkinsonism, though only olanzapine was associated with a
      reduction in dyskinetic symptoms. The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, Scale for
      the assessment of Negative Symptoms and Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating
      Scale scores all improved through the crossover period in both arms with no
      between group differences. Treatment with olanzapine was associated with a better
      response over risperidone on the psychological domain of the World Health
      Organisation-Quality Of Life [Brief] (WHO-QOL-BREF) scale ( p = 0.02). Patients
      in the olanzapine arm also demonstrated improvement from baseline in the
      WHO-QOL-BREF physical, psychological and health satisfaction domains, but
      risperidone had no effect on any Quality of Life (QOL) measure. CONCLUSIONS:
      After switching from a conventional antipsychotic, olanzapine and risperidone
      were associated with improvement in core symptoms of schizophrenia and motor side
      effects. Subjects switched to olanzapine were more likely to complete the
      switching process and show an improvement in psychological QOL.

TI  - The effectiveness of quetiapine versus conventional antipsychotics in improving
      cognitive and functional outcomes in standard treatment settings.
PG  - 524-31
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the effectiveness of quetiapine versus conventional
      antipsychotics in improving cognitive and functional outcomes. METHOD: Forty
      stable outpatients with DSM-IV schizophrenia treated in public outpatient clinics
      were randomly assigned to continue taking conventional antipsychotic medications 
      or switch to quetiapine for 6 months, beginning September 1998 and ending July
      2000. Neurocognitive and functional measures were obtained at study entry, 3
      months, and 6 months by raters blinded to treatment. Group differences were
      examined using repeated-measures analyses of covariance for mixed models.
      RESULTS: The mean (SD) dose of conventional antipsychotics in chlorpromazine
      equivalents was 348.00 (348.28) mg/day; the mean (SD) dose of quetiapine was
      319.25 (142.55) mg/day. A cognitive function summary score improved in the
      quetiapine group relative to the group treated with conventional antipsychotics
      over the 6-month period (F = 5.80, df = 1,28.9; p <.023). Patients taking
      quetiapine did better with respect to both verbal fluency (initiation) and verbal
      memory. There were also statistically significant group differences with respect 
      to quality of life favoring the quetiapine group (F = 4.87, df = 1,29; p <.04).
      Differences were not found with respect to adaptive functioning. CONCLUSION:
      Quetiapine improved cognition relative to conventional agents. After 6 months,
      groups differed by more than 1 standard deviation when baseline cognitive
      functioning was taken into account. No group differences were found with respect 
      to improvements in community functioning. Improvements in adaptive functioning
      may lag behind improvements in cognition. Psychosocial programming may be
      necessary to translate gains in cognition into improvements in adaptive
      functioning.

TI  - New generation antipsychotics versus low-potency conventional antipsychotics: a
      systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 1581-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The clearest advantage of new generation, atypical antipsychotics is 
      a reduced risk of extrapyramidal side-effects (EPS), compared with conventional
      compounds. These findings might have been biased by the use of the high-potency
      antipsychotic haloperidol as a comparator in most of the trials. We aimed to
      establish whether the new drugs induce fewer EPS than low-potency conventional
      antipsychotics. METHODS: We did a meta-analysis of all randomised controlled
      trials in which new generation antipsychotics had been compared with low-potency 
      (equivalent or less potent than chlorpromazine) conventional drugs. We included
      studies that met quality criteria A or B in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook, 
      and assessed quality with the Jadad scale. The primary outcome of interest was
      the number of patients who had at least one EPS. We used risk differences and 95%
      CIs as measures of effect size. FINDINGS: We identified 31 studies with a total
      of 2320 participants. Of the new generation drugs, only clozapine was associated 
      with significantly fewer EPS (RD=-0.15, 95% CI -0.26 to -0.4, p=0.008) and higher
      efficacy than low-potency conventional drugs. Reduced frequency of EPS seen with 
      olanzapine was of borderline significance (-0.15, -0.31 to -0.01, p=0.07). Only
      one inconclusive trial of amisulpride, quetiapine, and risperidone and no
      investigations of ziprasidone and sertindole were identified, but some evidence
      indicates that zotepine and remoxipride do not lead to fewer EPS than low-potency
      antipsychotics. Mean doses less than 600 mg/day of chlorpromazine or its
      equivalent had no higher risk of EPS than new generation drugs. As a group, new
      generation drugs were moderately more efficacious than low-potency
      antipsychotics, largely irrespective of the comparator doses used.
      INTERPRETATION: Optimum doses of low-potency conventional antipsychotics might
      not induce more EPS than new generation drugs. Potential advantages in efficacy
      of the new generation drugs should be a factor in clinical treatment decisions to
      use these rather than conventional drugs.

TI  - Olanzapine vs risperidone in the management of schizophrenia: a randomized
      double-blind trial in Australia and New Zealand.
PG  - 303-14
AB  - Improved drug therapy for schizophrenia may represent the best strategy for
      reducing the costs of schizophrenia and the recurrent chronic course of the
      disease. Olanzapine and risperidone are atypical antipsychotic agents developed
      to meet this need. We report a multicenter, double-blind, parallel, 30-week study
      designed to compare the efficacy, safety, and associated resource use for
      olanzapine and risperidone in Australia and New Zealand. The study sample
      consisted of 65 patients who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia,
      schizoaffective disorder, or schizophreniform disorder. Olanzapine-treated
      patients showed a significantly greater reduction in Positive and Negative
      Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) total, and
      PANSS General Psychopathology scores at endpoint compared to the
      risperidone-treated patients. Response rates through 30 weeks showed a
      significantly greater proportion of olanzapine-treated patients had achieved a
      20% or greater improvement in their PANSS total score compared to
      risperidone-treated patients. Olanzapine and risperidone were equivalent in their
      improvement of PANSS positive and negative scores and Clinical Global
      Impression-Severity of Illness scale (CGI-S) at endpoint. Using generic and
      disease-specific measures of quality of life, olanzapine-treated patients showed 
      significant within-group improvement in most measures, and significant
      differences were observed in favor of olanzapine over risperidone in Quality of
      Life Scale (QLS) Intrapsychic Foundation and Medical Outcomes Study Short Form
      36-item instrument (SF-36) Role Functioning Limitations-Emotional subscale
      scores. Despite the relatively small sample size, our study suggests that
      olanzapine has a superior risk:benefit profile compared to risperidone.

TI  - Clinical trial response and dropout rates with olanzapine versus risperidone.
PG  - 556-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: In schizophrenia, comparing treatment dropouts between olanzapine and
      risperidone can be useful to better understand their relative effectiveness.
      OBJECTIVE: To analyze the differences in the rates of dropout from clinical
      trials and response between these 2 antipsychotics. METHODS: Literature search
      was based on MEDLINE (1966-May 2002). Analysis 1 included 4 randomized studies
      (838 patients), analysis 2 included 2 randomized studies (n = 716), and analysis 
      3 assessed 5 clinical studies for olanzapine (n = 928) and 3 for risperidone (n =
      290). Odds ratios were estimated by the fixed-effect model. RESULTS: The risk of 
      treatment discontinuation (analysis 1) was significantly greater for risperidone 
      than for olanzapine (42% vs. 33%, respectively). The response rates were
      identical for the 2 drugs (analysis 2). A slightly better pattern of maintenance 
      of response was found for olanzapine (analysis 3). CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of
      dropout and maintenance of remission seems to be better controlled for olanzapine
      than for risperidone.

TI  - Acute dysphoric mania: treatment response to olanzapine versus placebo.
PG  - 132-7
AB  - A substantial number of patients with mania have significant concomitant
      depressive features, and they may respond differently to mood stabilizers than
      patients with pure mania. This post-hoc analysis explored the response
      characteristics of olanzapine versus placebo in bipolar I manic patients with
      dysphoric and nondysphoric mania (differentiated by baseline Hamilton Depression 
      Rating Scale [HAM-D] score of >20). Two similar, double-blind, randomized trials 
      comparing olanzapine, 5-20 mg, to placebo were pooled for these analyses (N =
      246). Mean changes in Young-Mania Rating Scale (Y-MRS) and HAM-D scores during 3 
      weeks of treatment were examined. Twenty-eight percent of patients had dysphoric 
      mania (olanzapine, n = 33; placebo, n = 35). Among these patients,
      olanzapine-treated patients had greater improvement within 1 week than did
      placebo-treated patients on both mania ratings (Y-MRS: -9.7 vs. -3.0 points; =
      0.011) and depressive symptom ratings (HAM-D: -9.9 vs. -5.4 points; = 0.025).
      Among those manic subjects without prominent depressive symptoms (olanzapine, n =
      91; placebo, n = 87), mean Y-MRS improvement from baseline to endpoint with
      olanzapine (-11.5 points) versus placebo (-6.13 points) was comparable to the
      improvement seen with olanzapine versus placebo in the dysphoric mania subgroup (
      = 0.476, test of interaction). In acutely ill manic patients with significant
      depressive symptoms, olanzapine demonstrated a broad spectrum of efficacy,
      effectively treating both manic and depressive symptoms. The magnitude of the
      antimanic response appears similar, regardless of baseline depressive features.
      Additional experience with putative mood stabilizers and atypical agents in mixed
      mania should include an exploration of their efficacy in treating both manic and 
      depressive mood symptoms.

TI  - A randomized placebo-controlled trial of risperidone for the treatment of
      aggression, agitation, and psychosis of dementia.
PG  - 134-43
AB  - BACKGROUND: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial examined the 
      efficacy and safety of risperidone in the treatment of aggression, agitation, and
      psychosis in elderly nursing-home patients with dementia. METHOD: Elderly
      patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of dementia of the Alzheimer's type, vascular
      dementia, or a combination of the 2 (i.e., mixed dementia) and significant
      aggressive behaviors were randomized to receive, for a period of 12 weeks, a
      flexible dose of either placebo or risperidone solution up to a maximum of 2
      mg/day. Outcome measures were the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), the
      Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease (BEHAVE-AD) rating scale, and the
      Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) and of Change (CGI-C) scales.
      RESULTS: A total of 345 patients were randomized to treatment with risperidone or
      placebo, and 337 patients received at least one dose of study drug. The trial was
      completed by 67% of patients in the placebo group and 73% of patients in the
      risperidone group. The mean +/- SE dose of risperidone was 0.95 +/- 0.03 mg/day. 
      The primary endpoint of the study, the difference from baseline to endpoint in
      CMAI total aggression score, showed a significant reduction in aggressive
      behavior for risperidone versus placebo (p <.001). A similar improvement was also
      seen for the CMAI total non-aggression subscale (p <.002) and for the BEHAVE-AD
      total (p <.001) and psychotic symptoms subscale (p =.004). At endpoint, the CGI-S
      and the CGI-C scores indicated a significantly greater improvement with
      risperidone compared with placebo (p <.001). Overall, 94% and 92% of the
      risperidone and placebo groups, respectively, reported at least 1 adverse event. 
      Somnolence and urinary tract infection were more common with risperidone
      treatment, whereas agitation was more common with placebo. There was no
      significant difference in the number of patients who reported extrapyramidal
      symptoms between the risperidone (23%) and placebo (16%) groups. CONCLUSION:
      Treatment with low-dose (mean = 0.95 mg/day) risperidone resulted in significant 
      improvement in aggression, agitation, and psychosis associated with dementia.

TI  - Switching from depot antipsychotic drugs to olanzapine in patients with chronic
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 119-22
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic schizophrenia (DSM-IV criteria) often receive
      depot antipsychotic medications to assure longer administration and better
      compliance with their treatment regimen. This study evaluated whether patients
      stabilized on depot antipsychotic medication could be successfully transitioned
      to oral olanzapine. METHOD: In a 3-month open-label study, 26 clinically stable
      patients with schizophrenia taking depot antipsychotics for over 3 years were
      randomly assigned to continue on their current depot dose or to switch to oral
      olanzapine. Clinical ratings (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS],
      Global Assessment of Functioning [GAF] scale, and Clinical Global Impressions
      [CGI] scale) and side effect parameters (Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale
      [AIMS], Barnes Akathisia Scale, AMDP-5 scale, vital signs, and weight) were
      obtained monthly. RESULTS: Oral olanzapine patients (N = 13) demonstrated
      significant clinical improvement over the depot control group (N = 13) from
      baseline to 3-month endpoint (PANSS total, p =.012; PANSS general, p =.068; PANSS
      negative, p =.098; CGI-Improvement, p =.007; CGI-Severity, p =.026; GAF, p
      =.015). Side effect rating scales showed no statistical differences between the 2
      groups (AIMS, Barnes Akathisia Scale, AMDP-5, vital signs). The depot control
      group showed no statistical superiority in any measure except weight change (p
      =.0005). After 3 months, all olanzapine patients preferred olanzapine to their
      previous depot medications and chose to continue on olanzapine treatment.
      CONCLUSION: Clinicians may expect clinical improvement when switching chronically
      psychotic patients from traditional depot antipsychotic drugs to oral olanzapine.
      Switching may be completed within a 4-week period with relative compliance being 
      maintained and patients preferring oral olanzapine to their previous depot
      medications.

TI  - Flupenthixol versus risperidone: subjective quality of life as an important
      factor for compliance in chronic schizophrenic patients.
PG  - 37-46
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this paper was to compare the effects of
      flupenthixol and risperidone on subjective quality of life and attitude towards
      medication in chronic schizophrenic patients with mainly negative symptoms. In a 
      spectrum ranging from its typical end "haloperidol" to its atypical end
      "clozapine", flupenthixol has typical and atypical characteristics. METHODS: The 
      effects of flupenthixol versus risperidone were investigated in a multicenter,
      double-blind trial, whereas subjective quality of life was assessed by means of
      the EuroQuol-Visual Analogue Scale and the patient satisfaction questionnaire.
      The attitude towards medication was assessed by means of the Drug Attitude
      Inventory-30 (DAI-30). RESULTS: Mean daily dose of study medication was 6.6 (SD
      2.9) mg/day flupenthixol and 3.6 (SD 1.2) mg/day risperidone. Both groups showed 
      a significant improvement regarding subjective quality of life and positive
      attitude towards medication. Especially the categories "control of their
      thoughts", concentration and "feeling better in general" ameliorated in both
      groups. In the flupenthixol group, the "ability to cope with stress", "feel more 
      relaxed" and the "ability to achieve something" improved significantly more than 
      in the risperidone group. CONCLUSIONS: (1) The spectrum of schizophrenia can be
      treated effectively with different neuroleptic treatments. (2) Flupenthixol
      especially improves the ability to cope with stress, the ability to achieve
      something and feeling more relaxed. (3) Subjective quality of life significantly 
      increased with no difference between the groups.

TI  - The European Schizophrenia Outpatient Health Outcomes (SOHO) study: rationale,
      methods and recruitment.
PG  - 222-32
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of the European Schizophrenia Outpatient Health Outcomes
      (SOHO) study is to understand the comparative costs and outcomes of antipsychotic
      drug treatment, with specific focus on olanzapine. The study will also provide a 
      large database for research into the treatment and outcome of schizophrenia. The 
      role of observational studies in the assessment of the effectiveness of
      antipsychotic agents is reviewed, and the rationale, design and recruitment
      issues surrounding the SOHO study are presented. METHOD: SOHO is a 3-year,
      prospective, observational study of the health outcomes associated with
      antipsychotic treatment in Europe. RESULTS: Over 10 000 patients have been
      recruited from 10 countries. Baseline evaluation included measures of clinical
      status, social functioning, quality of life, service use and pharmacological
      treatment. Patients will be followed for 3 years. CONCLUSION: The SOHO study will
      complement randomized controlled trial findings on the treatment of schizophrenia
      and will address relevant clinical and policy research questions.

TI  - Mood stabilisers plus risperidone or placebo in the treatment of acute mania.
      International, double-blind, randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 141-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few double-blind trials have examined the efficacy of a combination
      of a mood stabiliser and an atypical antipsychotic in acute mania. AIMS: To
      determine the efficacy of risperidone in combination with a mood stabiliser in
      acute mania. METHOD: Patients taking a mood stabiliser were randomised to 3
      weeks' treatment with risperidone (n=75) or placebo (n=76). RESULTS: Young Mania 
      Rating Scale (YMRS) scores improved rapidly with significantly greater reductions
      at week 1 in the risperidone group compared with the placebo group. At end-point 
      YMRS scores decreased by 14.5 and 10.3 points in the risperidone and placebo
      groups, respectively. Significant improvements v. placebo (P<0.05) were noted in 
      the risperidone group on several other clinically meaningful measures.
      Additionally, a post hoc analysis excluding carbamazepine-treated patients
      (plasma concentrations of risperidone active moiety were 40% lower in this group)
      revealed significantly greater reductions (P=0.047) in YMRS scores in the
      risperidone group than in the placebo group. Incidence of adverse events was
      similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Risperidone is superior to placebo when used
      in combination with lithium or divalproex in acute mania.

TI  - Subjective experience and D2 receptor occupancy in patients with recent-onset
      schizophrenia treated with low-dose olanzapine or haloperidol: a randomized,
      double-blind study.
PG  - 303-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors tested the hypothesis that a dopamine D(2) receptor
      occupancy level between 60% and 70% in patients with recent-onset schizophrenia
      would result in optimal subjective experience. In addition, they sought
      preliminary evidence on whether subjective experience is better with low-dose
      olanzapine than with low-dose haloperidol. METHOD: Subjects (N=24) who met DSM-IV
      criteria for schizophrenia were randomly assigned to 6 weeks of double-blind
      treatment with either olanzapine, 7.5 mg/day, or haloperidol, 2.5 mg/day.
      Subjective experience, psychopathology, and extrapyramidal symptoms were assessed
      at baseline and at endpoint. After 6 weeks, D(2) receptor occupancy was assessed 
      with [(123)I]iodobenzamide single photon emission computed tomography. RESULTS:
      The two study groups were similar at baseline. After 6 weeks, patients receiving 
      olanzapine had a significantly lower mean dopamine D(2) receptor occupancy
      (51.0%, range=36%-67%) than those given haloperidol (65.5%, range=45%-75%).
      Receptor occupancy between 60% and 70% was associated with optimal subjective
      experience, and subjective experience improved significantly in the haloperidol
      group. CONCLUSIONS: A level of D(2) receptor occupancy between 60% and 70% is
      optimal for subjective experience of patients with recent-onset schizophrenia.
      Substantial interindividual variation in D(2) receptor occupancy was seen at
      fixed low-dose levels of olanzapine and haloperidol. Olanzapine, 7.5 mg/day,
      showed no superior subjective response over haloperidol, 2.5 mg/day. Olanzapine
      may need to be dosed higher than 7.5 mg/day for most patients with recent-onset
      schizophrenia, and haloperidol needs to be individually titrated in the very low 
      dose range to reach optimal occupancy.

TI  - Efficacy of quetiapine and risperidone against depressive symptoms in outpatients
      with psychosis.
PG  - 1156-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: The treatment of psychotic symptoms in patients with mood disorders
      is a complex challenge. Antipsychotic medications in these individuals may be
      associated with extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), worsening of depression, and
      functional impairment. Atypical antipsychotics such as quetiapine and risperidone
      are associated with a decreased incidence of adverse events such as EPS. The
      objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of
      quetiapine and risperidone for the treatment of depressive symptoms in
      outpatients with psychosis. METHOD: In this 4-month, multicenter, open-label
      trial, patients were randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio of quetiapine to
      risperidone, and both drugs were flexibly dosed. Eligible patients had psychoses 
      and demonstrated 1 of several DSM-IV diagnoses, including schizoaffective
      disorder, bipolar I disorder, major depressive disorder, delusional disorder,
      Alzheimer's dementia, schizophreniform disorder, vascular dementia, and substance
      abuse dementia. Patients were classified as mood disordered if they had bipolar
      disorder, major depressive disorder, or schizoaffective disorder. Efficacy was
      assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and the Clinical Global
      Impressions scale. The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) was used to
      assess the level of depressive symptoms. The primary tolerability assessment was 
      presence or absence of substantial EPS, defined as EPS severe enough to require
      an alteration in treatment. RESULTS: A total of 554 patients were randomly
      assigned to quetiapine and 175 to risperidone. Mean doses at 16 weeks were 318 mg
      for quetiapine and 4.4 mg for risperidone. Although both agents produced
      improvements in mean HAM-D scores, quetiapine produced a greater improvement than
      risperidone in all patients (p =.0015). Within the mood-diagnosed population,
      incidences of both substantial EPS (p =.001) and at least moderate EPS (p =.0373)
      occurred significantly less frequently among patients taking quetiapine. For
      patients with non-mood diagnoses, incidences of substantial EPS were fewer for
      patients taking quetiapine than for those taking risperidone (p =.062); however, 
      this was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that
      quetiapine may be a useful agent in the management of depressive symptoms in
      patients with psychosis.

TI  - A comparison of the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of divalproex sodium and
      olanzapine in the treatment of bipolar disorder.
PG  - 1148-55
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compared the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of
      divalproex and olanzapine in the treatment of acute mania associated with bipolar
      disorder. METHOD: This randomized, 12-week, double-blind, parallel-group,
      multicenter study included DSM-IV-defined bipolar disorder type I patients
      hospitalized for acute mania and randomly assigned to treatment with divalproex
      or olanzapine. After an inpatient period of up to 21 days, subjects were followed
      as outpatients. Dose adjustment was permitted during the inpatient period.
      Efficacy was assessed using change from baseline in Mania Rating Scale (MRS)
      score to day 21; other efficacy measures included the Brief Psychiatric Rating
      Scale, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and the Clinical Global
      Impressions-Part I, Severity of Illness scale. The primary safety endpoint was
      change from baseline in weight. Other safety and tolerability endpoints included 
      spontaneous adverse event reporting and changes from baseline in laboratory
      measures and vital signs. RESULTS: 120 subjects (N = 63 divalproex, N = 57
      olanzapine) were randomly assigned to treatment. No significant differences
      between groups were found for any efficacy variable for change from baseline to
      day 21. Mean MRS score changes from baseline to day 21 were -14.8 for divalproex 
      and -17.2 for olanzapine (p =.210). A significantly (p <.05) greater proportion
      of olanzapine-treated subjects experienced somnolence, weight gain, edema,
      rhinitis, and speech disorder (slurred speech); no adverse events were
      significantly greater in the divalproex group. A number of laboratory measures
      also demonstrated significant treatment differences, but the clinical
      significance of many of these is uncertain. Mean body weight changes were
      significantly greater in the olanzapine group (+ 8.8 lb [+ 4.0 kg]) than the
      divalproex group (+ 5.5 lb [+ 2.5 kg], p <.050). One death occurred during the
      study (olanzapine group, diabetic ketoacidosis). CONCLUSION: No significant
      difference in efficacy was found between treatment groups. Divalproex was
      associated with a more favorable adverse event profile and significantly less
      weight gain than olanzapine.

TI  - The risk of diabetes during olanzapine use compared with risperidone use: a
      retrospective database analysis.
PG  - 1135-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relative risk of diabetes among patients undergoing risperidone
      treatment was compared with that of patients receiving olanzapine. METHOD: A
      cohort was formed of 33,946 patients with at least 1 prescription for either
      olanzapine (N = 19,153) or risperidone (N = 14,793) between January 1, 1997, and 
      December 31, 1999, recorded in the Regie de l'Assurance Maladie du Quebec
      database. Patients were excluded if clozapine was dispensed to them during the
      study period or if they were diagnosed with diabetes before beginning
      antipsychotic therapy. New diabetes diagnoses made after the first antipsychotic 
      prescription during the period were tabulated until December 31, 1999; censoring 
      occurred at this date or at the last service date, if there was no record of
      using services during the last 6 months of follow-up. Crude hazard ratio and
      proportional hazard analyses were carried out. RESULTS: 319 patients developed
      diabetes on olanzapine treatment, and 217 developed diabetes on risperidone
      treatment; a crude hazard ratio of 1.08 (95% CI = 0.89 to 1.31, p =.43) was
      determined. When age, gender, and haloperidol use were controlled for using
      proportional hazard analysis, there was a 20% increased risk of diabetes with
      olanzapine relative to risperidone (95% CI = 0% to 43%, p =.05). Proportional
      hazard analyses adjusted for duration of olanzapine exposure indicated that the
      first 3 months of olanzapine treatment was associated with an increased risk of
      diabetes of 90% (95% CI = 40% to 157%, p <.0001), after adjusting for age,
      gender, and haloperidol use. CONCLUSION: Compared with risperidone, olanzapine
      was associated with an increased risk of developing diabetes. More studies are
      required to further investigate this association.

TI  - Clozapine treatment for suicidality in schizophrenia: International Suicide
      Prevention Trial (InterSePT).
PG  - 82-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 50% of patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective
      disorder attempt suicide, and approximately 10% die of suicide. Study results
      suggest that clozapine therapy significantly reduces suicidal behavior in these
      patients. METHODS: A multicenter, randomized, international, 2-year study
      comparing the risk for suicidal behavior in patients treated with clozapine vs
      olanzapine was conducted in 980 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective
      disorder, 26.8% of whom were refractory to previous treatment, who were
      considered at high risk for suicide because of previous suicide attempts or
      current suicidal ideation. To equalize clinical contact across treatments, all
      patients were seen weekly for 6 months and then biweekly for 18 months.
      Subsequent to randomization, unmasked clinicians at each site could make any
      interventions necessary to prevent the occurrence of suicide attempts. Suicidal
      behavior was assessed at each visit. Primary end points included suicide attempts
      (including those that led to death), hospitalizations to prevent suicide, and a
      rating of "much worsening of suicidality" from baseline. Masked raters, including
      an independent suicide monitoring board, determined when end point criteria were 
      achieved. RESULTS: Suicidal behavior was significantly less in patients treated
      with clozapine vs olanzapine (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval,
      0.58-0.97; P =.03). Fewer clozapine-treated patients attempted suicide (34 vs 55;
      P =.03), required hospitalizations (82 vs 107; P =.05) or rescue interventions
      (118 vs 155; P =.01) to prevent suicide, or required concomitant treatment with
      antidepressants (221 vs 258; P =.01) or anxiolytics or soporifics (301 vs 331; P 
      =.03). Overall, few of these high-risk patients died of suicide during the study 
      (5 clozapine vs 3 olanzapine-treated patients; P =.73). CONCLUSIONS: Clozapine
      therapy demonstrated superiority to olanzapine therapy in preventing suicide
      attempts in patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder at high risk
      for suicide. Use of clozapine in this population should lead to a significant
      reduction in suicidal behavior.

TI  - Olanzapine in the acute treatment of bipolar I disorder with a history of rapid
      cycling.
PG  - 155-61
AB  - BACKGROUND: A substantial proportion of patients with bipolar disorder are
      characterized by a rapidly cycling course and are particularly resistant to
      conventional treatment. METHODS: This secondary analysis, defined a priori, was
      conducted on a larger data set from patients with bipolar I disorder to determine
      the efficacy of a 3-week treatment with the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine
      (5-20 mg/day, n=19) versus placebo (n=26) in patients with >or=4 episodes in the 
      preceding year. RESULTS: Significantly fewer placebo patients completed treatment
      (34.6 vs. 73.7%, P=0.016), and more than half discontinued due to lack of
      efficacy (53.8 vs. 21.1%, P=0.035). Olanzapine reduced Young Mania Rating Scale
      (YMRS) total scores significantly more than placebo (-13.9 vs. -4.1, P=0.011).
      Clinical responses, defined as >or=50% improvement in YMRS, were achieved in 58% 
      of olanzapine patients, compared with 28% of placebo patients (P=0.066).
      Extrapyramidal symptoms were not significantly changed in either group.
      Somnolence was the most common adverse event in both groups (olanzapine: 52.6%,
      placebo: 23.1%; P=0.060). No event occurred significantly more frequently with
      olanzapine than with placebo. No patients discontinued due to an adverse event.
      LIMITATIONS: The duration of this study was limited to 3 weeks, precluding
      conclusions about long-term efficacy of olanzapine. Moreover, a sizeable placebo 
      effect was obtained, possibly masking optimal therapeutic effect. Despite these
      limitations, treatment differences in efficacy were highly significant.
      CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that olanzapine was effective in reducing
      symptoms of mania and well tolerated in patients with bipolar I disorder with a
      rapid-cycling course.

TI  - Quetiapine is not associated with increase in prolactin secretion in contrast to 
      haloperidol.
PG  - 562-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Typical antipsychotic drugs frequently cause hyperprolactinemia and
      even galactorrhea. In addition, these side effects may result in noncompliance
      with antipsychotic treatment. Capacity to avoid hyperprolactinemia has been
      accepted as one atypical criterion. The aim of the present study was to compare
      effects of haloperidol, the most commonly used antipsychotic, and quetiapine, a
      novel antipsychotic agent used in Turkey, on serum prolactin (PRL) levels.
      METHODS: The study consisted of 35 females diagnosed with schizophrenia according
      to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4(th) ed. (DSM-IV).
      Thirty-five patients in a drug-free period for at least 2 weeks were included to 
      randomized quetiapine (n = 18) and haloperidol (n = 17) treatment group. All
      patients were assessed by Brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS), Positive and
      negative syndrome scale (PANSS), and Extrapyramidal symptoms rating scale (ESRS).
      PRL levels were measured both at the beginning and at the sixth week of the
      study. RESULTS: Both treatment groups exhibited significant improvements in
      clinical signs as evaluated by BPRS and PANSS. While there was no significant
      difference in PRL level between groups at the beginning of the study, control
      prolactin (PRL) levels were significantly lower in quetiapine compared to
      haloperidol group. While no quetiapine group patients exhibited galactorrhea, we 
      observed that two patients from the haloperidol group had galactorrhea related to
      hyperprolactinemia. CONCLUSIONS: The present study revealed that quetiapine is
      not associated with increase in PRL secretion in contrast to the conventional
      antipsychotic haloperidol.

TI  - Amisulpride vs. risperidone in chronic schizophrenia: results of a 6-month
      double-blind study.
PG  - 1071-81
AB  - This multicenter, double-blind, randomized study evaluated the efficacy, safety
      and functional effects of two atypical antipsychotics, amisulpride and
      risperidone, in patients with chronic schizophrenia (DSM IV) with a recent
      worsening of symptoms. It was planned as a non-inferiority trial. 309 patients
      received amisulpride (400-1,000 mg/day) or risperidone (4-10 mg/day) for six
      months. Amisulpride was demonstrated to be not inferior to risperidone with
      respect to the decrease in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total
      score from baseline (90% 2-sided confidence interval (-5.6; 4.0)). Symptomatic
      improvement measured with the Brief Psychiatry Rating Scale (BPRS), the PANSS
      positive subscale, and the Bech Rafaelsen Melancholia Scale was similar in both
      groups. Amisulpride was significantly (p <.05) superior to risperidone in terms
      of response (>/=50% improvement in PANSS and BPRS total scores or "very much/much
      improved" on the Clinical Global Impression Scale) and also demonstrated better
      functional effects and subjective response. Both treatments were well tolerated
      and had a similar low incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms; however, amisulpride 
      was associated with less weight gain and endocrine/sexual symptoms.

TI  - Differential effects of risperidone, olanzapine, clozapine, and conventional
      antipsychotics on type 2 diabetes: findings from a large health plan database.
PG  - 920-30
AB  - BACKGROUND: Case series suggest that some antipsychotics may induce or exacerbate
      type 2 diabetes. This study measured the association of antipsychotic treatments 
      with diabetes at a population level. METHOD: Claims data for psychosis patients
      (ICD-CM-9 290.xx-299.xx) within health plans encompassing 2.5 million individuals
      were analyzed. Patients reporting preexisting type 2 diabetes up to 8 months
      prior to observation were excluded. The frequency of newly reported type 2
      diabetes in untreated patients and among patients treated with antipsychotics
      from 5 categories (risperidone, olanzapine, clozapine, and high-potency and
      low-potency conventionals) was compared. Logistic regression models compared the 
      odds of diabetes based on exposure to each of the antipsychotic categories.
      RESULTS: Based on 12 months of exposure, the odds of type 2 diabetes for
      risperidone-treated patients (odds ratio = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.372 to 2.070) was not
      significantly different from that for untreated patients, whereas patients
      receiving other antipsychotics had a significantly greater risk of diabetes than 
      untreated patients (p < .05): olanzapine, 3.10 (95% CI = 1.620 to 5.934);
      clozapine, 7.44 (95% CI = 0.603 to 34.751); high-potency conventionals, 2.13 (95%
      CI = 1.097 to 4.134); and low-potency conventionals, 3.46 (95% CI = 1.522 to
      7.785). Older age and greater use of non-antipsychotic psychotropic medications
      also contributed to risk of type 2 diabetes. Olanzapine also showed significantly
      higher (p < .01) odds of diabetes associated with increasing dose. CONCLUSION:
      Consistent with previously published literature, these data suggest that
      olanzapine, clozapine, and some conventional antipsychotics appear to increase
      the risk of acquiring or exacerbating type 2 diabetes and that the effect may
      vary by drug. In contrast to these agents, risperidone was not associated with an
      increased risk of type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Antipsychotic combination therapy in schizophrenia. A review of efficacy and
      risks of current combinations.
PG  - 323-30
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on efficacy and risks of combining
      antipsychotics (atypical with atypical or conventional) and suggest a rationale
      and strategies for future clinical trials. METHOD: A computerized Medline search 
      supplemented by an examination of cross-references and reviews was performed.
      RESULTS: Empirical evidence for the efficacy of combining antipsychotics is too
      limited to draw firm conclusions. The practice of augmenting clozapine with more 
      'tightly bound' D2 receptor antagonists as exemplified by risperidone
      augmentation of clozapine has some empirical and theoretical support. The risks
      of augmentation strategies have not been studied systematically. No study has
      examined the economic impact of combination treatment. CONCLUSION: Further trials
      of antipsychotic combination therapies are needed before this currently
      unsupported practice can be recommended. Rationales for combination treatment
      include a broadening of the range of receptor activity or an increase in D2
      receptor occupancy with certain atypical agents. Trial methodology needs to take 
      into account subject characteristics, duration of treatment, optimization of
      monotherapy comparators, and appropriate outcome measures.

TI  - Pharmacogenomics in schizophrenia: the quest for individualized therapy.
PG  - 2517-30
AB  - There is strong evidence to suggest that genetic variation plays an important
      role in inter-individual differences in medication response and toxicity. The
      rapidly evolving disciplines of pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics seek to
      uncover this genetic variation in order to predict treatment outcomes. The goal
      is to be able to select the drugs with the greatest likelihood of benefit and the
      least likelihood of harm in individual patients, based on their genetic
      make-up-individualized therapy. Pharmacogenomic studies utilize genomic
      technologies to identify chromosomal areas of interest and novel putative drug
      targets, while pharmacogenetic strategies rely on studying sequence variations in
      candidate genes suspected of affecting drug response or toxicity. The candidate
      gene variants that affect function of the gene or its protein product have the
      highest priority for investigation. This review will provide demonstrative
      examples of functional candidate gene variants studied in a variety of
      antipsychotic response phenotypes in the treatment of schizophrenia. Serotonin
      and dopamine receptor gene variants in clozapine response will be examined, and
      in the process the need for sub-phenotypes will be pointed out. Our recent
      pharmacogenetic studies of the subphenotype of neurocognitive functioning
      following clozapine treatment and the dopamine D(1) receptor gene (DRD1) will be 
      presented, highlighting our novel neuroimaging data via
      [(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) metabolism position emission tomography
      (PET) that demonstrates hypofunctioning of several brain regions in patients with
      specific dopamine D(1) genotype. Preliminary candidate gene studies investigating
      the side-effect of clozapine-induced weight gain are also presented. The
      antipsychotic adverse reaction of tardive dyskinesia and its association with the
      dopamine D(3) receptor will be critically examined, as well as the added
      influence of antipsychotic metabolism via the cytochrome P450 1A2 gene (CYP1A2 ).
      Results that delineate the putative gene-gene interaction between DRD3 and CYP1A2
      are also presented. We have also utilized FDG-PET subphenotyping to demonstrate
      increased brain region activity in patients who have the dopamine D(3) genotype
      that confers increased risk for antipsychotic induced tardive dyskinesia. The
      merits and weaknesses of neuroimaging technologies as applied to pharmacogenetic 
      analyses are discussed. To the extent that the above data become more widely
      verified and replicated, the field of psychiatry will move closer to clinically
      meaningful tests that will be useful in deciding the best drug for each
      individual patient.

TI  - Extrapyramidal symptom profiles in Japanese patients with schizophrenia treated
      with olanzapine or haloperidol.
PG  - 227-38
AB  - Previous clinical trials have clearly shown the superiority of olanzapine to
      haloperidol in the improvement of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) in schizophrenic 
      patients. The primary purpose of this study was to compare EPS profiles in
      Japanese schizophrenic patients treated with an atypical antipsychotic,
      olanzapine, or a typical antipsychotic, haloperidol, as measured by the
      Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptoms Scale (DIEPSS). The DIEPSS, which consists
      of eight individual parameters and one global assessment (overall severity), was 
      used to evaluate 182 patients enrolled in this 8-week study. The primary safety
      analysis was maximum change (that could be either a decrease or increase) from
      baseline in DIEPSS total score. Secondary analyses included change from baseline 
      to maximum in DIEPSS total score, change from baseline to endpoint (LOCF) in
      DIEPSS total score, and the rank sum of the maximum change (that could be either 
      a decrease or increase) from baseline in the DIEPSS individual items. Incidence
      of treatment-emergent EPS adverse events using the DIEPSS scale was also
      analyzed. The olanzapine group showed statistically significant superiority to
      the haloperidol group on the primary analysis (p<0.001). Secondary analyses also 
      demonstrated olanzapine's superiority in DIEPSS total, parkinsonism, akathisia
      and overall severity scores (all p< or =0.014). Categorical analysis of
      treatment-emergent akathisia and parkinsonism syndromes at endpoint showed
      improvement in the olanzapine group but worsening in the haloperidol group. The
      results from this study suggest that olanzapine, as in Caucasian populations, is 
      a safe treatment in Japanese patients chronically ill with schizophrenia.

TI  - Olanzapine versus haloperidol in the treatment of acute mania: clinical outcomes,
      health-related quality of life and work status.
PG  - 227-37
AB  - We aimed to compare clinical outcomes, health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and
      work status associated with olanzapine and haloperidol treatment in patients with
      bipolar disorder. This double-blind, randomized controlled trial, comparing
      flexible dosing of olanzapine (5-20 mg/day, n = 234) to haloperidol (3-15 mg/day,
      n = 219), consisted of a 6-week acute phase, followed by a 6-week continuation
      phase. Symptomatic remission rates were similar for olanzapine- and
      haloperidol-treated patients at weeks 6 and 12. At week 6, significant changes in
      five dimensions of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey
      (SF-36) [general health (P = 0.010), physical functioning (P < 0.001), role
      limitations due to physical problems (P < 0.001), social functioning (P < 0.05)
      and vitality (P < 0.01)] and the SF-36 physical components summary score were
      found in favour of olanzapine compared to haloperidol. At week 12, olanzapine
      treatment maintained the significantly favourable HRQOL changes. At the end of
      week 12, patients on olanzapine showed significantly greater improvement than
      haloperidol in work activities impairment and household activities impairment
      scores on the Streamlined Longitudinal Interview Clinical Evaluation from the
      Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation (SLICE/LIFE) activities impairment
      scores. Subgroup analyses revealed that olanzapine treatment significantly
      increased a proportion of employed patients and their weekly paid working hours. 
      In conclusion, compared to haloperidol, olanzapine treatment was comparably
      effective in the remission of bipolar mania and significantly improved HRQOL and 
      work status in patients with bipolar I disorder.

TI  - Double-blind, placebo-controlled study of risperidone for the treatment of
      disruptive behaviors in children with subaverage intelligence.
PG  - 1337-46
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The short-term efficacy and safety of risperidone in the treatment of 
      disruptive behaviors was examined in a well-characterized cohort of children with
      subaverage intelligence. METHOD: In this 6-week, multicenter, double-blind,
      parallel-group study of 118 children (aged 5-12 years) with severely disruptive
      behaviors and subaverage intelligence (IQ between 36 and 84, inclusive), the
      subjects received 0.02-0.06 mg/kg per day of risperidone oral solution or
      placebo. The a priori primary efficacy measure was the change in score from
      baseline to endpoint on the conduct problem subscale of the Nisonger Child
      Behavior Rating Form. RESULTS: The risperidone group showed significantly greater
      improvement than did the placebo group on the conduct problem subscale of the
      Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form from week 1 through endpoint (change in score
      of -15.2 and -6.2, respectively). Risperidone was also associated with
      significantly greater improvement than placebo on all other Nisonger Child
      Behavior Rating Form subscales at endpoint, as well as on the Aberrant Behavior
      Checklist subscales for irritability, lethargy/social withdrawal, and
      hyperactivity; the Behavior Problems Inventory aggressive/destructive behavior
      subscale; a visual analogue scale of the most troublesome symptom; and the
      Clinical Global Impression change score. The most common adverse effects reported
      during risperidone treatment were headache and somnolence. The extrapyramidal
      symptom profile of risperidone was comparable to that of placebo. Mean weight
      increases of 2.2 kg. and 0.9 kg occurred in the risperidone and placebo groups,
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Risperidone was effective and well tolerated for the
      treatment of severely disruptive behaviors in children with subaverage IQ.

TI  - Weight and blood pressure change during clozapine treatment.
PG  - 202-6
AB  - We examined whether clozapine-related weight gain is associated with an increase 
      in mean arterial blood pressure. Weight gain and mean arterial blood pressure
      changes were assessed in 61 outpatients with schizophrenia who were randomly
      assigned to either clozapine or haloperidol in a 10-week parallel group,
      double-blind study and in 55 patients who chose to continue to receive clozapine 
      in a subsequent 1-year open-label prospective study. Clozapine treatment was
      associated with significant weight gain in the double blind and open-label
      trials. Haloperidol treatment was not associated with significant weight gain.
      Neither clozapine nor haloperidol treatment were associated with significant
      changes in mean arterial blood pressure. There were no significant correlations
      between weight gain and mean arterial blood pressure change with either
      medication. Although clozapine treatment is associated with weight gain, the
      correlation between this weight gain and increases in arterial blood pressure
      during the first year of treatment appears to be low.

TI  - Risperidone in children with autism and serious behavioral problems.
PG  - 314-21
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atypical antipsychotic agents, which block postsynaptic dopamine and 
      serotonin receptors, have advantages over traditional antipsychotic medications
      in the treatment of adults with schizophrenia and may be beneficial in children
      with autistic disorder who have serious behavioral disturbances. However, data on
      the safety and efficacy of atypical antipsychotic agents in children are limited.
      METHODS: We conducted a multisite, randomized, double-blind trial of risperidone 
      as compared with placebo for the treatment of autistic disorder accompanied by
      severe tantrums, aggression, or self-injurious behavior in children 5 to 17 years
      old. The primary outcome measures were the score on the Irritability subscale of 
      the Aberrant Behavior Checklist and the rating on the Clinical Global Impressions
      - Improvement (CGI-I) scale at eight weeks. RESULTS: A total of 101 children (82 
      boys and 19 girls; mean [+/-SD] age, 8.8+/-2.7 years) were randomly assigned to
      receive risperidone (49 children) or placebo (52). Treatment with risperidone for
      eight weeks (dose range, 0.5 to 3.5 mg per day) resulted in a 56.9 percent
      reduction in the Irritability score, as compared with a 14.1 percent decrease in 
      the placebo group (P<0.001). The rate of a positive response, defined as at least
      a 25 percent decrease in the Irritability score and a rating of much improved or 
      very much improved on the CGI-I scale, was 69 percent in the risperidone group
      (34 of 49 children had a positive response) and 12 percent in the placebo group
      (6 of 52, P<0.001). Risperidone therapy was associated with an average weight
      gain of 2.7+/-2.9 kg, as compared with 0.8+/-2.2 kg with placebo (P<0.001).
      Increased appetite, fatigue, drowsiness, dizziness, and drooling were more common
      in the risperidone group than in the placebo group (P<0.05 for each comparison). 
      In two thirds of the children with a positive response to risperidone at eight
      weeks (23 of 34), the benefit was maintained at six months. CONCLUSIONS:
      Risperidone was effective and well tolerated for the treatment of tantrums,
      aggression, or self-injurious behavior in children with autistic disorder. The
      short period of this trial limits inferences about adverse effects such as
      tardive dyskinesia.

TI  - Economic, clinical, and quality-of-life outcomes associated with olanzapine
      treatment in mania. Results from a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 109-18
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objectives of this study were to determine the economic,
      clinical, and quality-of-life outcomes associated with olanzapine treatment in
      patients diagnosed with mania. METHODS: Patients with a diagnosis of bipolar I
      disorder with manic or mixed episodes were enrolled in a randomized controlled
      trial. The study design comprised a 3-week acute phase followed by a 49-week open
      label extension. In the open label extension, the use of lithium and fluoxetine
      was permitted for patients who experienced breakthrough symptoms. Clinical,
      economic, and quality-of-life outcomes of treatment were assessed. RESULTS:
      During the acute phase, olanzapine patients experienced a statistically
      significant greater mean improvement from baseline on the Y-MRS total score
      compared to the placebo patients. In the open label extension, patients
      experienced a statistically significant mean change of 11.8 units on the Y-MRS
      from the end of the acute phase. When compared to costs incurred in the previous 
      12 months of therapy, patients experienced savings of almost $900 per month
      during the 49 weeks of olanzapine therapy. These cost savings were largely driven
      by reductions in in-patient costs during the open label extension. Health-related
      quality of life improvements measured by the SF-36 were seen on several
      dimensions both in the 3-week acute phase as well as in the 49-week open label
      extension. CONCLUSION: From a clinical, economic, and quality-of-life outcomes
      standpoint, olanzapine had a significant impact in the treatment of mania, and
      could be considered a cost-effective treatment option for use in this population 
      if these findings are extrapolated to non-clinical trial populations.

TI  - A 28-week comparison of ziprasidone and haloperidol in outpatients with stable
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 516-23
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ziprasidone is a novel antipsychotic with a unique pharmacologic
      profile. This study compared ziprasidone with the conventional antipsychotic
      haloperidol in outpatients with stable schizophrenia. METHOD: Three hundred one
      outpatients with stable chronic or subchronic schizophrenia (DSM-III-R) were
      randomized and participated in this double-blind, multicenter, parallel-group
      clinical study comparing flexible-dose oral ziprasidone, 80-160 mg/day (N = 148),
      with haloperidol, 5-15 mg/day (N = 153), over 28 weeks. Patients were assessed
      using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Clinical Global
      Impressions-Severity of Illness scale, the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating
      Scale, the Simpson-Angus Scale, the Barnes Akathisia Scale, and the Abnormal
      Involuntary Movement Scale. RESULTS: Modal doses at endpoint were 80 mg/day for
      ziprasidone and 5 mg/day for haloperidol. Improvements in all mean efficacy
      variables with both ziprasidone and haloperidol were observed. Significantly more
      patients were categorized as negative symptom responders (> or = 20% reduction in
      PANSS negative subscale score) in the ziprasidone group (48%) compared with the
      haloperidol group (33%) (p < .05). Ziprasidone had clear advantages over
      haloperidol in all evaluations of movement disorders. Changes in body weight were
      negligible with both treatments. No pattern of laboratory or cardiovascular
      changes was observed. CONCLUSION: Ziprasidone and haloperidol were both effective
      in reducing overall psychopathology; ziprasidone demonstrated effective treatment
      of negative symptoms and was better tolerated than haloperidol. Ziprasidone
      appears to offer an effective alternative to haloperidol in the long-term
      treatment of stable outpatients with schizophrenia.

TI  - Newer atypical antipsychotic medication in comparison to clozapine: a systematic 
      review of randomized trials.
PG  - 1-10
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of newer atypical
      antipsychotic drugs in comparison to clozapine for schizophrenia. Publications in
      all languages were searched from all relevant databases and all randomized
      controlled trials comparing clozapine with newer atypical drugs were included.
      The review and meta-analysis includes eight studies, most of them short in
      duration. Newer atypical drugs were broadly similar to clozapine when improvement
      was measured using a psychosis symptom rating scale or a global index. There was 
      a trend for clozapine to be more effective than the others for positive symptoms,
      and less effective for the negative symptoms. The adverse effect profile of
      clozapine and newer atypical drugs was dissimilar: while clozapine produced more 
      fatigue, hypersalivation, and orthostatic dizziness, new atypical drugs, with the
      exception of olanzapine, produced more extrapyramidal symptoms. As these results 
      were obtained from few studies and a relatively small amount of patients, the
      equal effectiveness and tolerability of new atypical drugs in comparison with
      clozapine is not yet demonstrated. More trials of sufficient power, with longer
      duration, and measuring clinically important outcomes are urgently needed.

TI  - The neurocognitive effects of low-dose haloperidol: a two-year comparison with
      risperidone.
PG  - 972-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neurocognitive deficits are core features of schizophrenia that are
      linked to functional outcome for the disorder. Recent studies and reviews have
      concluded that newer antipsychotic medications are better for neurocognitive
      deficits than conventional antipsychotic medications; however, one difficulty in 
      interpreting this literature is that the comparisons have mainly been with high
      doses of conventional medications. This study examined the neurocognitive effects
      of low-dose haloperidol compared with risperidone over a 2-year period. METHODS: 
      Sixty-two patients were randomly assigned to medication (starting at 6 mg of each
      medication) and administered neurocognitive batteries six times over the course
      of follow-up. At 6 months, the mean dose of haloperidol was 5.0 mg, and the mean 
      dose of risperidone was 6.0 mg. Neurocognitive data were reduced into cluster
      scores and a global summary score. RESULTS: We found no significant overall
      differences in treatment effects on the cluster scores or the global score. The
      global score revealed a significant group by time interaction, reflecting the
      fact that the haloperidol group tended to improve initially and then stay stable,
      whereas the risperidone group improved more gradually over the follow-up period. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study did not provide support for neurocognitive advantages of 
      a newer antipsychotic medication over a low-dose conventional medication. We
      speculate that conventional medications may have neurocognitive benefits at low
      doses that are neutralized or reversed at higher doses.

TI  - Neurocognitive effects of clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, and haloperidol in 
      patients with chronic schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.
PG  - 1018-28
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Newer antipsychotic drugs have shown promise in ameliorating
      neurocognitive deficits in patients with schizophrenia, but few studies have
      compared newer antipsychotic drugs with both clozapine and conventional agents,
      particularly in patients who have had suboptimal response to prior treatments.
      METHOD: The authors examined the effects of clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone,
      and haloperidol on 16 measures of neurocognitive functioning in a double-blind,
      14-week trial involving 101 patients. A global score was computed along with
      scores in four neurocognitive domains: memory, attention, motor function, and
      general executive and perceptual organization. RESULTS: Global neurocognitive
      function improved with olanzapine and risperidone treatment, and these
      improvements were superior to those seen with haloperidol. Patients treated with 
      olanzapine exhibited improvement in the general and attention domains but not
      more than that observed with other treatments. Patients treated with risperidone 
      exhibited improvement in memory that was superior to that of both clozapine and
      haloperidol. Clozapine yielded improvement in motor function but not more than in
      other groups. Average effect sizes for change were in the small to medium range. 
      More than half of the patients treated with olanzapine and risperidone
      experienced "clinically significant" improvement (changes in score of at least
      one-half standard deviation relative to baseline). These findings did not appear 
      to be mediated by changes in symptoms, side effects, or blood levels of
      medications. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a history of suboptimal response to
      conventional treatments may show cognitive benefits from newer antipsychotic
      drugs, and there may be differences between atypical antipsychotic drugs in their
      patterns of cognitive effects.

TI  - Olanzapine versus divalproex in the treatment of acute mania.
PG  - 1011-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The effects of olanzapine and divalproex for the treatment of mania
      were compared in a large randomized clinical trial. METHOD: A 3-week, randomized,
      double-blind trial compared flexibly dosed olanzapine (5-20 mg/day) to divalproex
      (500-2500 mg/day in divided doses) for the treatment of patients hospitalized for
      acute bipolar manic or mixed episodes. The Young Mania Rating Scale and the
      Hamilton Depression Rating Scale were used to quantify manic and depressive
      symptoms, respectively. Safety was assessed with several measures. RESULTS: The
      protocol defined baseline-to-endpoint improvement in the mean total score on the 
      Young Mania Rating Scale as the primary outcome variable. The mean Young Mania
      Rating Scale score decreased by 13.4 for patients treated with olanzapine (N=125)
      and 10.4 for those treated with divalproex (N=123). A priori categorizations
      defined response and remission rates: 54.4% of olanzapine-treated patients
      responded (> or = 50% reduction in Young Mania Rating Scale score), compared to
      42.3% of divalproex-treated patients; 47.2% of olanzapine-treated patients had
      remission of mania symptoms (endpoint Young Mania Rating Scale < or = 12),
      compared to 34.1% of divalproex-treated patients. The decrease in Hamilton
      depression scale score was similar in the two treatment groups. Completion rates 
      for the 3-week study were similar in both groups. The most common
      treatment-emergent adverse events (incidence >10%) occurring more frequently
      during treatment with olanzapine were dry mouth, increased appetite, and
      somnolence. For divalproex, nausea was more frequently observed. The average
      weight gain with olanzapine treatment was 2.5 kg, compared to 0.9 kg with
      divalproex treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The olanzapine treatment group had
      significantly greater mean improvement of mania ratings and a significantly
      greater proportion of patients achieving protocol-defined remission, compared
      with the divalproex treatment group. Significantly more weight gain and cases of 
      dry mouth, increased appetite, and somnolence were reported with olanzapine,
      while more cases of nausea were reported with divalproex.

TI  - Sex differences in clinical response to olanzapine compared with haloperidol.
PG  - 27-37
AB  - There is current disagreement over whether men and women respond differently to
      typical or atypical antipsychotic medications. This study reanalyzed a large
      international clinical trial of olanzapine (Olz) compared with haloperidol (Hal) 
      to test for sex differences in treatment response, controlling for illness
      chronicity and menopausal status. We hypothesized that women would show a greater
      response to either medication than men, particularly among first admission,
      premenopausal women. DSM-III-R schizophrenia inpatients (700 women and 1295 men) 
      were randomly assigned to a 6-week trial of Olz vs. Hal. Longitudinal random
      effect models were used to test for interactions of sex with medication,
      chronicity and menopausal status on treatment response. Findings showed that
      women on olanzapine had a greater drop in overall symptomatology by week 4 than
      any other group, and their level of symptomatology remained lower throughout the 
      6-week trial. The sex differences in treatment response in olanzapine compared
      with haloperidol were, in part, dependent on chronicity and, in women, menopausal
      status. That is, first episode women on haloperidol exhibited an increase in
      symptomatology over the 6-week trial compared to their male counterparts, while
      multiply hospitalized women had a better treatment response on haloperidol than
      their male counterparts. Women on olanzapine had a significantly better treatment
      response than men, regardless of chronicity. Finally, premenopausal women had a
      significantly better treatment response than postmenopausal women, regardless of 
      treatment and chronicity.

TI  - Clozapine use and risk of diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 236-43
AB  - Recent reports have raised the concern that clozapine increases the risk for
      diabetes mellitus. Accurate pharmacoepidemiologic data on whether such a hazard
      exists and its magnitude are needed to enable clinicians and patients to make
      proper treatment decisions about clozapine. The authors performed a case-control 
      study involving 7,227 cases of newly treated diabetes and 6,780 controls, all
      with psychiatric disorders. Cases and controls were older than 20 years and
      enrolled in government-sponsored drug benefit programs in New Jersey. The authors
      measured the use of clozapine or other antipsychotic medications and additional
      covariates. They developed logistic regression models adjusted for demographic,
      clinical, and health care use characteristics to identify whether clozapine users
      were at increased risk to begin treatment for diabetes. Clozapine use was not
      significantly associated with developing diabetes (adjusted odds ratio [OR],
      0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74-1.31). There was no suggestion of
      relationships between larger dosages or longer durations of clozapine use and
      increasing risks of diabetes. On the other hand, nonclozapine antipsychotic
      medication use was associated with a modest but significantly increased risk of
      developing diabetes (adjusted OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.05-1.22). Among individual
      nonclozapine antipsychotics, significantly elevated risks were observed for two
      phenothiazine agents: chlorpromazine (adjusted OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.09-1.56) and
      perphenazine (adjusted OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.11- 1.62). In contrast to earlier
      reports, these results provide some reassurance that clozapine does not increase 
      the risk of developing diabetes. Additional data from pharmacoepidemiologic
      studies and randomized controlled trials are needed to exclude the possibility of
      residual confounding and ensure the appropriate use of this agent.

TI  - Olanzapine versus haloperidol in schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type.
PG  - 133-40
AB  - BACKGROUND: The present analysis was performed on data from a subsample of
      patients with schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, who participated in a
      multicenter, double-blind study comparing olanzapine to haloperidol. METHODS:
      Patients with schizoaffective disorder bipolar type, characterized as currently
      manic, mixed, depressed, or euthymic, were assessed weekly for 6 weeks during
      treatment with either olanzapine or haloperidol. Manic symptoms were measured
      using the sum of six items of the BPRS, and depressive symptoms were assessed
      using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. In addition, cognitive
      functioning was measured using the sum of seven items from the PANSS. Repeated
      measures analyses were performed using random coefficients regression of the
      serial measurement of manic, cognitive, and depressive symptoms. RESULTS: A
      significant treatment difference was detected overall, indicating that olanzapine
      was significantly more effective than haloperidol in reducing symptoms of
      depression and improving patients' cognitive symptoms. The superiority of
      olanzapine over haloperidol in the reduction of manic symptoms did not reach
      statistical significance (P=.052). The greatest improvement in both manic and
      cognitive symptoms was seen in the olanzapine-treated 'currently manic' subgroup,
      and least improvement in the haloperidol-treated 'euthymic' subgroup. Depressive 
      symptoms were most improved in the olanzapine-treated 'depressed' subgroup, and
      least improved in the corresponding haloperidol subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: Overall,
      olanzapine was superior to haloperidol with respect to thymoleptic effects in
      patients with schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type.

TI  - Risperidone safety and efficacy in the treatment of bipolar and schizoaffective
      disorders: results from a 6-month, multicenter, open study.
PG  - 818-25
AB  - BACKGROUND: The goal of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of
      risperidone in bipolar and schizoaffective disorders. METHOD: 541 patients
      entered this open, multicenter, 6-month study. Patients were entered provided
      that they fulfilled DSM-IV criteria for bipolar disorder or schizoaffective
      disorder, bipolar type, during a manic, hypomanic, mixed, or depressive episode. 
      Risperidone was added to any previous mood-stabilizing medication that the
      patients were taking. Efficacy was assessed with the Young Mania Rating Scale
      (YMRS), the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), the Positive and
      Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), and the Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI).
      Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) were assessed using the UKU Side Effect Rating
      Scale. RESULTS: 430 patients completed the study. Addition of risperidone
      produced highly significant improvements (p < .0001) on the YMRS and HAM-D at
      both 6 weeks and 6 months and on the CGI and the scales of the PANSS at both 4
      weeks and 6 months. There was a significant reduction in UKU total and subscale
      scores at 6 months. The mean dose of risperidone was 3.9 mg/day. There was no
      single case of new-emergent tardive dyskinesia, and there was a very low
      incidence of exacerbation of mania within the first 6 weeks (2%). Adverse events 
      were few and mostly mild. the most frequent being EPS and weight gain.
      CONCLUSION: This large study provides additional evidence that risperidone is
      effective and well tolerated when combined with mood stabilizers in the treatment
      of bipolar disorder and schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type. Previous concerns
      about exacerbation of manic symptoms were not confirmed.

TI  - Comparison of risperidone with olanzapine in elderly patients with dementia and
      psychosis.
PG  - 1-5
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of risperidone and olanzapine on
      cognition in elderly patients with dementia and psychosis, and to compare the
      side effects of these drugs. DESIGN: Single-blind, multicenter, observational
      study. SETTING: Four rural nursing care facilities. PATIENTS: Nineteen elderly
      patients with dementia and psychosis. INTERVENTION: Eleven patients were treated 
      with risperidone, eight with olanzapine. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Rating
      assessments were completed at baseline, 1 month, and 2 months. Simple paired and 
      unpaired t tests determined between- and within-group differences. Social
      functioning, including activities of daily living, improved over baseline in both
      groups (p=0.03). Cognition declined significantly (p<0.05) in the risperidone
      group; comparatively more side effects occurred and blood pressure decreased
      (p<0.05) in the olanzapine group. When compared with each group cross-sectionally
      at baseline and end point, however, the two groups did not differ significantly. 
      CONCLUSION: Improvements in social functioning in all 19 patients suggest that
      both risperidone and olanzapine may help improve functioning in elderly patients 
      with dementia and psychosis. Cognitive and side effect profiles of these drugs
      may differ substantially. Further study is needed to determine patient
      subpopulations who may be able to tolerate one drug over another.

TI  - Efficacy of olanzapine in combination with valproate or lithium in the treatment 
      of mania in patients partially nonresponsive to valproate or lithium monotherapy.
PG  - 62-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: A 6-week double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was
      conducted to determine the efficacy of combined therapy with olanzapine and
      either valproate or lithium compared with valproate or lithium alone in treating 
      acute manic or mixed bipolar episodes. METHODS: The primary objective was to
      evaluate the efficacy of olanzapine (5-20 mg/d) vs placebo when added to ongoing 
      mood-stabilizer therapy as measured by reductions in Young Mania Rating Scale
      (YMRS) scores. Patients with bipolar disorder (n = 344), manic or mixed episode, 
      who were inadequately responsive to more than 2 weeks of lithium or valproate
      therapy, were randomized to receive cotherapy (olanzapine + mood-stabilizer) or
      monotherapy (placebo + mood-stabilizer). RESULTS: Olanzapine cotherapy improved
      patients' YMRS total scores significantly more than monotherapy (-13.11 vs -9.10;
      P = .003). Clinical response rates (> or = 50% improvement on YMRS) were
      significantly higher with cotherapy (67.7% vs 44.7%; P< .001). Olanzapine
      cotherapy improved 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-21) total
      scores significantly more than monotherapy (4.98 vs 0.89 points; P< .001). In
      patients with mixed-episodes with moderate to severe depressive symptoms (DSM-IV 
      mixed episode; HAMD-21 score of > or = 20 at baseline), olanzapine cotherapy
      improved HAMD-21 scores by 10.31 points compared with 1.57 for monotherapy (P<
      .001). Extrapyramidal symptoms (Simpson-Angus Scale, Barnes Akathisia Scale,
      Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale) were not significantly changed from baseline
      to end point in either treatment group. Treatment-emergent symptoms that were
      significantly higher for the olanzapine cotherapy group included somnolence, dry 
      mouth, weight gain, increased appetite, tremor, and slurred speech. CONCLUSION:
      Compared with the use of valproate or lithium alone, the addition of olanzapine
      provided superior efficacy in the treatment of manic and mixed bipolar episodes.

TI  - A comparison of risperidone and haloperidol for the prevention of relapse in
      patients with schizophrenia.
PG  - 16-22
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prevention of relapse is a major goal of maintenance treatment in
      patients with psychotic disorders. We performed a long-term comparison of a
      newer, atypical antipsychotic drug, risperidone, and an older, conventional
      neuroleptic drug, haloperidol, in terms of the rate of relapse in patients with
      schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. METHODS: In a double-blind,
      prospective study at 40 sites, we randomly assigned adult outpatients in stable
      condition with chronic schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder to receive
      treatment with flexible doses of either risperidone or haloperidol for a minimum 
      of one year. RESULTS: Of the 397 patients who underwent randomization, data from 
      2 were excluded because they did not receive study medication; data from all 30
      patients from one site were excluded by the sponsor, the Janssen Research
      Foundation, because of concern about the integrity of the data. The median
      duration of treatment was 364 days in the risperidone group and 238 days in the
      haloperidol group (P=0.02). Of the 177 patients assigned to risperidone and the
      188 assigned to haloperidol who remained in the analysis, 44.1 percent and 52.7
      percent, respectively, discontinued treatment for reasons other than relapse. The
      Kaplan-Meier estimate of the risk of relapse at the end of the study was 34
      percent for the risperidone group and 60 percent for the haloperidol group
      (P<0.001); the risk ratio for relapse with haloperidol, from the Cox model, was
      1.93 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.33 to 2.80; P<0.001). Early
      discontinuation of treatment for any reason was more frequent among
      haloperidol-treated patients (risk ratio, 1.52; 95 percent confidence interval,
      1.18 to 1.96). Patients in the risperidone group had greater reductions in the
      mean severity of both psychotic symptoms and extrapyramidal side effects than
      those in the haloperidol group. CONCLUSIONS: Adult outpatients with clinically
      stable schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder have a lower risk of relapse if 
      they are treated with risperidone than if they are treated with haloperidol.

TI  - Olanzapine treatment for patients with schizophrenia and substance abuse.
PG  - 217-21
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of olanzapine
      in patients with schizophrenia and comorbid substance abuse disorders. Thirty
      patients who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder as
      well as criteria for substance abuse or substance dependence, were treated in a
      12-month prospective, open-label trial of olanzapine. Patients were evaluated
      with multiple efficacy and safety measures at baseline and then monthly
      thereafter. Statistically significant improvement was noted in psychopathology,
      levels of hope, and safety measures. Seventy percent (n = 21) of the patients
      achieved early full substance abuse remission at the end of the study period,
      while 30% (n = 9) achieved early partial substance abuse remission. Our results
      indicate that olanzapine treatment improved psychopathology, increased
      hopefulness, and reduced antipsychotic-associated side effects. The benefits
      observed with olanzapine treatment may contribute to the patients' substance
      abuse remission.

TI  - A comparison of the relative safety, efficacy, and tolerability of quetiapine and
      risperidone in outpatients with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders: the 
      quetiapine experience with safety and tolerability (QUEST) study.
PG  - 1839-54
AB  - BACKGROUND: The few published direct comparative studies of the tolerability and 
      efficacy of atypical antipsychotic agents were performed in relatively
      homogeneous populations that may not be typical of patients seen in clinical
      practice. OBJECTIVE: The Quetiapine Experience with Safety and Tolerability
      (QUEST) study compared the relative safety, tolerability, and efficacy of
      quetiapine and risperidone in outpatients with a broad range of psychotic
      symptoms. METHODS: This was a multicenter, 4-month, open-label, randomized
      clinical trial. Patients were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive quetiapine or 
      risperidone. Doses were adjusted to maximize efficacy and to minimize adverse
      events. Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) were assessed with an EPS checklist;
      adverse events were recorded. Efficacy was assessed using the Clinical Global
      Impression (CGI) scale, Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS), and Hamilton
      Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D). RESULTS: A total of 728 patients were
      randomized, 553 to quetiapine and 175 to risperidone. Mean prescribed doses over 
      the study period were 253.9 mg/d quetiapine and 4.4 mg/d risperidone. At the end 
      of 4 months, EPS declined in both treatment groups, but quetiapine-treated
      patients were significantly less likely to require dose adjustment or concurrent 
      anti-EPS medication (P < 0.001). The most common adverse events in the quetiapine
      and risperidone groups were somnolence (31.3% and 15.4%, respectively), dry mouth
      (14.5% and 6.9%), and dizziness (12.7% and 6.9%). Overall, tolerance to side
      effects with the 2 drugs, measured by dropout rates, was comparable. At each
      visit, a higher percentage of quetiapine-treated patients showed improvement on
      the CGI scale, but there were no significant between-group differences on the
      PANSS. At end point, quetiapine-treated patients had significantly lower HAM-D
      scores (P = 0.028). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that
      quetiapine is as effective as risperidone for the treatment of psychotic
      symptoms, is more effective for depressive symptoms, may have a more favorable
      EPS profile, and has comparable overall tolerability.

TI  - Clozapine use in patients with schizophrenia and the risk of diabetes,
      hyperlipidemia, and hypertension: a claims-based approach.
PG  - 1172-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Numerous case reports have linked clozapine to the development of
      diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia in patients with schizophrenia. However,
      investigators have been unable to clearly demonstrate this association when
      compared with a control group receiving conventional antipsychotics. METHODS:
      Medical and pharmacy claims from the Iowa Medicaid program were used to compare
      incidence rates for diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension in 552 patients
      receiving clozapine and 2461 patients receiving conventional antipsychotics (eg, 
      haloperidol, chlorpromazine hydrochloride), with the use of a retrospective
      cohort design. Logistic regression was used to compare incidence rates adjusting 
      for age, sex, and duration of available follow-up. RESULTS: No significant
      differences in overall incidence rates for diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or
      hypertension were observed in patients receiving clozapine vs conventional
      antipsychotics. However, among younger patients (aged 20-34 years), clozapine
      administration was associated with a significantly increased relative risk of
      diabetes (2.5 [95% confidence interval, 1.2-5.4]) and hyperlipidemia (2.4 [95%
      confidence interval, 1.1-5.2]), but not hypertension (0.9 [95% confidence
      interval, 0.4-2.0]). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that clozapine may not be an
      independent cause of diabetes or hyperlipidemia, but instead acts as an effect
      modifier in susceptible populations by increasing weight or affecting insulin
      secretion and resistance. This finding requires confirmation in other settings
      and patient populations and with the other atypical antipsychotics (risperidone, 
      olanzapine, and quetiapine fumarate). The potential long-term medical and
      economic implications of the early induction of diabetes and hyperlipidemia in
      patients with schizophrenia warrant further study.

TI  - A double-blind randomised comparison of risperidone and haloperidol in the
      treatment of behavioural and psychological symptoms in Chinese dementia patients.
PG  - 1156-62
AB  - BACKGROUND: Behavioural and psychological symptoms (BPSD) are common during the
      course of dementia and present severe problems to patients and their caregivers. 
      OBJECTIVES: To assess the therapeutic efficacy and safety of haloperidol and
      risperidone in treating BPSD in Chinese dementia patients. METHODS: A 12-week
      double-blind randomised comparison of haloperidol and risperidone treatments was 
      conducted in 58 patients with DSM-IV diagnosis of dementia of Alzheimer's type or
      vascular dementia. They were randomly assigned to receive flexible doses (0.5 to 
      2 mg/day) of haloperidol or risperidone. Clinical response was evaluated using
      the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), the Behavioral Pathology in
      Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD), Simpson-Angus Scale, Functional
      Assessment Staging and Cantonese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination.
      RESULTS: The mean doses at the last week were 0.90 mg/day of haloperidol and 0.85
      mg/day of risperidone. Both haloperidol and risperidone significantly reduced the
      severity of BPSD (scores on CMAI and BEHAVE-AD), with no significant
      between-group differences. Haloperidol-treated patients showed a worsening on
      Simpson-Angus scale while there was no significant change in this measure in
      risperidone-treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose haloperidol and risperidone
      were well tolerated and associated with reductions in the severity and frequency 
      of behavioural symptoms in subjects with dementia. Risperidone may have a more
      favourable risk-benefit profile in view of its lower propensity to induce
      extrapyramidal symptoms.

TI  - Does cognitive function improve with quetiapine in comparison to haloperidol?
PG  - 239-48
AB  - Recent evidence suggests that schizophrenia patients taking atypical
      antipsychotic medications may perform better on some tests of cognitive function 
      than those treated with older antipsychotics. The current study compared the
      effects of quetiapine and haloperidol on measures of executive function, memory
      and attention. Subjects were 58 stable outpatients with schizophrenia (DSM III-R)
      who received a battery of cognitive tests as part of a randomized, double-blind, 
      multi-site clinical efficacy study conducted by AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals.
      Cognitive assessments were conducted prior to randomization when patients were
      receiving < or =30 mg haloperidol or equivalent (mean: 9.2mg/day haloperidol
      equivalents), and again after 24 weeks of fixed-dose treatment with either
      quetiapine 600 or 300 mg/day or haloperidol 12 mg/day. Analyses of covariance
      with planned comparisons were used to compare scores on cognitive measures at the
      end of 24 weeks by treatment group with baseline cognitive function scores used
      as covariates. Patients receiving quetiapine 600 mg/day improved to a greater
      extent than patients receiving haloperidol on overall cognitive function
      (p<0.02). Specific differences were found for executive function (Verbal Fluency 
      Test, p<0.04), attention (Stroop Color Word Test, p<.03) and verbal memory
      (Paragraph Recall Test, p<0.02). Treatment group differences were not solely due 
      to benztropine use, medication side effects, or changes in symptomatology.
      Treatment with quetiapine at higher doses (600 mg/day) relative to haloperidol
      appears to have a positive impact on important domains of cognitive performance
      that have been found to predict role function and community outcomes in patients 
      with schizophrenia.

TI  - Affective reactivity of language and right-ear advantage in schizophrenia.
PG  - 181-6
AB  - A subset of schizophrenic patients has demonstrated increased language
      dysfunction in affectively stressful, compared to non-stressful conditions.
      Affective reactivity of right-ear advantage has been demonstrated in studies of
      dichotic listening in schizophrenia. The present study assessed whether
      participants who showed affective reactivity of speech were also those who showed
      affective reactivity of right-ear advantage. Data from 18 schizophrenic
      outpatients were analyzed. Affective reactivity of language was associated with
      affective reactivity of right-ear advantage. Findings should be regarded as
      preliminary due to the small sample size; however, they may potentially
      contribute to construct the validity of affective reactivity as a process
      discriminator in schizophrenia.

TI  - Clozapine and haloperidol in moderately refractory schizophrenia: a 6-month
      randomized and double-blind comparison.
PG  - 965-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the demonstrated efficacy of clozapine in severely refractory
      schizophrenia, questions remain regarding its efficacy for primary negative
      symptoms, comparison with a moderate dose of a first-generation antipsychotic,
      and adverse effects during a longer-term trial. This study examined its efficacy 
      in partially responsive, community-based patients, compared clozapine with
      moderate-dose haloperidol, and extended treatment to 6 months. METHODS:
      Randomized, double-blind, 29-week trial comparing clozapine (n = 37) with
      haloperidol (n = 34). Subjects with schizophrenia who were being treated in
      community settings at 3 collaborating clinical facilities were enrolled. RESULTS:
      Subjects treated with haloperidol were significantly more likely to discontinue
      treatment for lack of efficacy (51%) than were those treated with clozapine
      (12%). A higher proportion of clozapine-treated subjects met an a priori
      criterion of improvement (57%) compared with haloperidol-treated subjects (25%). 
      Significantly greater improvement was seen in symptoms of psychosis,
      hostile-suspiciousness, anxiety-depression, thought disturbance, and total score 
      measured on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. No differences were detected in
      negative symptoms using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale or the Schedule for
      Assessment of Negative Symptoms. Subjects treated with clozapine experienced more
      excess salivation, dizziness, and sweating and less dry mouth and decreased
      appetite than those treated with haloperidol. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with a
      first-generation antipsychotic given in a moderate dose, clozapine offers
      substantial clinical benefits to treatment-refractory subjects who can be treated
      in the community. Advantages are seen in a broad range of symptoms but do not
      extend to negative symptoms.

TI  - Olanzapine as long-term adjunctive therapy in treatment-resistant bipolar
      disorder.
PG  - 469-73
AB  - The aim of this study was to estimate the long-term effectiveness of olanzapine
      as adjunctive therapy in patients with bipolar disorder who exhibited an
      inadequate response to mood stabilizers. Twenty-three Research Diagnostic
      Criteria (RDC) patients with bipolar I and II were assessed by means of the
      Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia and entered if they gave their
      consent to participate. All of them had experienced frequent relapses, residual
      subsyndromal symptoms, and inadequate responses to other drugs, such as lithium, 
      valproate, or carbamazepine. While maintaining other drugs, they all received
      open-label, increasing doses of olanzapine, until achieving clinical response.
      Other drugs were maintained. The patients were assessed several consecutive times
      from baseline to the endpoint with the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) scale
      for use in bipolar illness. Records of recurrences, hospitalizations, and side
      effects were also collected. The last-observation-carried-forward analysis showed
      that there was a significant reduction of CGI scores after the introduction of
      olanzapine, either in manic symptoms (p = 0.0015), depressive symptoms (p =
      0.0063), or global symptoms (p = 0.0003). The most frequent adverse events were
      somnolence (17%) and weight gain (13%). The mean dose of olanzapine at the end of
      the 43-week follow-up was 8.1 mg/day. Olanzapine may be a useful medication for
      the long-term adjunctive treatment of patients with bipolar disorder who exhibit 
      a poor response to mood stabilizers, such as lithium, valproate, or
      carbamazepine. These results suggest mood-stablizing properties of olanzapine.

TI  - Symptom reduction and suicide risk among patients treated with placebo in
      antipsychotic clinical trials: an analysis of the food and drug administration
      database.
PG  - 1449-54
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The assumption that psychotic patients assigned to placebo in clinical
      trials of antipsychotics are exposed to substantial morbidity and mortality is
      not based on data about what actually happens to such patients. This study
      assesses symptoms and risks of suicide and suicide attempts in psychotic patients
      assigned to receive placebo in clinical trials. METHOD: The authors used the Food
      and Drug Administration database to assess suicides, suicide attempts, and
      psychotic symptom reduction in clinical trials of three new antipsychotics.
      RESULTS: Among 10,118 participating patients, 26 committed suicide and 51
      attempted suicide. Rates of suicide and attempted suicide did not differ
      significantly between the placebo-treated and the drug-treated groups. Annual
      rates of suicide and attempted suicide based on patient exposure years were 1.8% 
      and 3.3%, respectively, with placebo; 0.9% and 5.7% with an established
      antipsychotic; and 0.7% and 5.0% with a new antipsychotic. Symptom reduction was 
      16.6% with new antipsychotics (N=1,203), 17.3% with established antipsychotics
      (N=261), and 1.1% with placebo (N=462). CONCLUSIONS: These data may help inform
      discussions about the use of placebo in antipsychotic clinical trials.

TI  - A double-blind comparative study of clozapine and risperidone in the management
      of severe chronic schizophrenia.
PG  - 1305-13
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This prospective, double-blind, multicenter, parallel-group study
      compared the efficacy and safety of therapeutic doses of clozapine and
      risperidone in patients with severe chronic schizophrenia and poor previous
      treatment response. METHOD: Male or female patients aged 18-65 years who met
      DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia and study requirements for poor previous
      treatment response (N=273) were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with 
      either clozapine or risperidone administered over 12 weeks in increasing
      increments. The primary efficacy measures were the magnitude of improvement in
      Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and Clinical Global Impression (CGI)
      scores. Adverse events were recorded throughout the study. RESULTS: The magnitude
      of improvement in mean BPRS and CGI scores from baseline to end of the study was 
      significantly greater in the clozapine group than in the risperidone group.
      Statistically significant differences in favor of clozapine were also seen for
      most of the secondary efficacy measures (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale,
      Calgary Depression Scale, Psychotic Depression Scale, and Psychotic Anxiety
      Scale). The adverse event profile was similar for both treatment groups, with a
      lower risk of extrapyramidal symptoms in the clozapine group. CONCLUSIONS:
      Clozapine showed superior efficacy over risperidone in this patient population.
      Both treatments were equally well tolerated as demonstrated through their adverse
      event profiles, although as expected clozapine was associated with a lower risk
      of extrapyramidal symptoms than risperidone.

      24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-24) and the
      Clinician-Administered Rating Scale for Mania (CARS-M). The authors were unable
      to statistically distinguish between risperidone and haloperidol in the
      amelioration of psychotic and manic symptoms. In addition, there was no
      difference in worsening of mania between the two agents in either subgroup (i.e.,
      depressed or bipolar subgroups). For the total PANSS, risperidone produced a mean
      decrease of 16 points from baseline compared with a 14-point decrease with
      haloperidol. For the total CARS-M scale, risperidone and haloperidol produced
      mean change scores of 5 and 8 points, respectively, and for the CARS-M Mania
      subscale, 3 and 7 points, respectively. Additionally, risperidone produced a mean
      decrease of 13 points from the baseline 24-item HAM-D, compared with an 8-point
      decrease with haloperidol. In those patients who had more severe depressive
      symptoms (i.e., HAM-D baseline score >20), risperidone produced at least a 50%
      mean improvement in 12 (75%) of 16 patients in comparison to 8 (38%) of 21
      patients receiving haloperidol. Haloperidol produced significantly more
      extrapyramidal side effects and resulted in more dropouts caused by any side
      effect. There was no difference between risperidone and haloperidol in reducing
      both psychotic and manic symptoms in this group of patients with schizoaffective 
      disorder. Risperidone did not demonstrate a propensity to precipitate mania and
      was better tolerated than haloperidol. In those subjects with higher baseline
      HAM-D scores (i.e., >20), risperidone produced a greater improvement in
      depressive symptoms than haloperidol.

TI  - Meta-analysis comparing newer antipsychotic drugs for the treatment of
      schizophrenia: evaluating the indirect approach.
PG  - 942-56
AB  - BACKGROUND: Meta-analysis is a useful method to assess the efficacy of newer
      antipsychotic drugs compared with older drugs or placebo. However, few trials
      directly compare novel drugs to each other. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study 
      was to evaluate the method of indirect meta-analysis by applying it to data on
      olanzapine versus haloperidol and risperidone versus haloperidol to enable a
      comparison between olanzapine and risperidone. METHODS: Published randomized
      controlled trials (RCTs) of risperidone, olanzapine, and/or haloperidol were
      identified through literature searches (1983 to 1999) of the MEDLINE, Current
      Contents, and HealthSTAR databases and reviewed. Data for the Brief Psychiatric
      Rating Scale (BPRS) total score, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)
      negative subscale, the percentage of patients using anticholinergic drugs, and
      the percentage of patients dropping out due to lack of efficacy, side effects, or
      any cause were extracted and combined using the indirect method. These findings
      were compared with those from a direct comparative study of olanzapine and
      risperidone. RESULTS: The literature search yielded 8 RCTs comparing risperidone 
      to haloperidol and 3 comparing olanzapine to haloperidol. Only 1 trial directly
      comparing olanzapine and risperidone was found. In this trial, the change in BPRS
      total and PANSS negative subscale scores tended to be higher with olanzapine by
      1.80 and 1.10, respectively, but these differences were not statistically
      significant. Indirect meta-analysis yielded similar results. Changes in both BPRS
      total scores and PANSS negative subscale scores tended to be higher with
      olanzapine by 0.37 and 0.54, respectively, and again, the differences were not
      statistically significant. In the indirect meta-analysis, the rate of
      anticholinergic drug use was 19.5% greater among patients treated with
      risperidone than among patients treated with olanzapine (P < 0.05). In the direct
      comparative RCT, the rate was 13.1% higher among patients treated with
      risperidone (P < 0.05). The dropout rates were similar for patients treated with 
      risperidone and those treated with olanzapine in both analyses. CONCLUSION: An
      indirect meta-analysis of studies comparing olanzapine with haloperidol and
      risperidone with haloperidol yielded conclusions similar to those found in a
      direct comparative RCT of olanzapine and risperidone.

TI  - Rapid onset of therapeutic effect of risperidone versus haloperidol in a
      double-blind randomized trial.
PG  - 343-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Speed of onset of therapeutic effect is an important dimension of
      drugs employed to treat psychosis and schizophrenia. Faster onset is desirable to
      reduce the anguish caused by delusions and hallucinations and to protect patients
      and others from the consequences of poor judgment associated with psychotic
      exacerbation. Although sufficient studies have demonstrated that novel
      antipsychotics have advantages over clinically employed doses of classic drugs in
      terms of tolerability and aspects of efficacy, less is known about differences in
      speed of onset of therapeutic effect. This report consists of a post hoc
      subanalysis of data from a large double-blind, randomized pivotal trial in which 
      we compared onset of therapeutic effect between risperidone and haloperidol.
      METHOD: During an 8-week period, 227 patients with DSM-III chronic schizophrenia 
      received 4 mg/day of risperidone and 226 patients received 10 mg/day of
      haloperidol. Symptoms were assessed 6 times (days 0, 7, 14, 28, 42, and 56) using
      the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) for schizophrenia and the
      Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale (CGI-S). Data were analyzed
      using analysis of variance for multiple dependent variables and repeated-measures
      multivariate analysis of variance. RESULTS: The analyses revealed that patients
      receiving risperidone improved more rapidly than those receiving haloperidol as
      measured by PANSS total and CGI-S scores. Differences were most pronounced during
      the first week of treatment. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that risperidone offers 
      a more rapid response than haloperidol, particularly during the active phase of
      illness when time to response can be crucial.

TI  - Long-term olanzapine therapy in the treatment of bipolar I disorder: an
      open-label continuation phase study.
PG  - 273-81
AB  - BACKGROUND: Olanzapine has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of acute mania 
      in 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. We describe the results of the
      open-label extension from one of these trials. METHOD: In a 3-week, double-blind 
      study of patients with DSM-IV bipolar I disorder, olanzapine was superior to
      placebo for the treatment of acute manic symptoms. Of the 139 patients who
      entered the double-blind phase of the 3-week study, 113 patients continued into
      the 49-week open-label extension. Efficacy measurements including the Young Mania
      Rating Scale (YMRS), the 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-21),
      the Clinical Global Impressions scale-Bipolar Version, and the Positive and
      Negative Syndrome Scale and safety measurements including the Simpson-Angus
      scale, the Barnes Akathisia Scale, and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale
      were completed throughout. The analysis considered all treatment results,
      starting with the first olanzapine dose. Adjunctive lithium and fluoxetine were
      allowed during the open-label extension. RESULTS: The mean length of olanzapine
      treatment was 6.6 months, with a mean modal dose of 13.9 mg/day. A significant
      mean improvement in the YMRS total score, baseline to endpoint (-18.01, p <
      .001), was observed. During treatment, 88.3% of patients experienced a remission 
      of manic symptoms (YMRS total score < or =12), and only 25.5% subsequently
      relapsed (YMRS total score > or = 15). Significant improvement in HAM-D-21 scores
      was observed (p < .001). Forty-one percent of patients were maintained on
      olanzapine monotherapy. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events
      reported were somnolence (46.0%), depression (38.9%), and weight gain (36.3%).
      CONCLUSION: During up to 1 year of olanzapine therapy, either as monotherapy or
      in combination with lithium and/or fluoxetine, patients with bipolar disorder
      demonstrated significant improvement in mania and depression symptoms with a
      favorable safety profile. Further double-blind, controlled studies are needed to 
      confirm these results.

PG  - 1207-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the relation between antipsychotic drugs and myocarditis
      and cardiomyopathy. DESIGN: Data mining using bayesian statistics implemented in 
      a neural network architecture. SETTING: International database on adverse drug
      reactions run by the World Health Organization programme for international drug
      monitoring. Main outcome measures: Reports mentioning antipsychotic drugs,
      cardiomyopathy, or myocarditis. RESULTS: A strong signal existed for an
      association between clozapine and cardiomyopathy and myocarditis. An association 
      was also seen with other antipsychotics as a group. The association was based on 
      sufficient cases with adequate documentation and apparent lack of confounding to 
      constitute a signal. Associations between myocarditis or cardiomyopathy and
      lithium, chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, haloperidol, and risperidone need further 
      investigation. CONCLUSIONS: Some antipsychotic drugs seem to be linked to
      cardiomyopathy and myocarditis. The study shows the potential of bayesian neural 
      networks in analysing data on drug safety.

TI  - A randomized double-blind study of risperidone and olanzapine in the treatment of
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.
PG  - 765-74
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The safety and efficacy of risperidone and olanzapine were compared in
      a double-blind trial that used doses widely accepted in clinical practice.
      METHOD: Subjects (N=377) who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia or
      schizoaffective disorder were randomly assigned to receive 2-6 mg/day of
      risperidone (mean modal dose=4.8 mg/day) or 5-20 mg/day of olanzapine (mean modal
      dose=12.4 mg/day) for 8 weeks. RESULTS: The two study groups were similar at
      baseline except that the olanzapine group was slightly younger than the
      risperidone group. Seventy-five percent of the participants completed the trial, 
      with no between-treatment differences in the proportion of dropouts. Similar
      proportions of the risperidone and olanzapine groups reported extrapyramidal
      symptoms (24% and 20%, respectively). Severity of extrapyramidal symptoms was low
      in both groups, with no between-group differences. Total Positive and Negative
      Syndrome Scale scores and scores on the five Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale
      factors were improved in both groups at week 8 (subjects who completed the study)
      and endpoint (all subjects, including dropouts). There were overall
      between-treatment differences in efficacy. Comparison of individual factors found
      no significant differences at endpoint; at week 8, however, improvements on
      Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale factors for positive symptoms and
      anxiety/depression were greater with risperidone than olanzapine. An increase in 
      body weight of > or =7% was seen in 27% of olanzapine participants and 12% of
      risperidone participants. CONCLUSIONS: Both treatments were well tolerated and
      efficacious. The frequency and severity of extrapyramidal symptoms were similar
      in the two treatment groups. Greater reductions in severity of positive and
      affective symptoms were seen with risperidone than with olanzapine treatment
      among study completers. There was no measure on which olanzapine was superior.
      Greater weight gain was associated with olanzapine than with risperidone
      treatment.

TI  - A comparison of long-term outcome in first-episode schizophrenia following
      treatment with risperidone or a typical antipsychotic.
PG  - 179-84
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most reports assessing the efficacy and tolerability of risperidone
      have involved patients previously treated with typical antipsychotics. Such
      patients are more likely to have a greater resistance or intolerance to
      treatment, thus restricting our interpretation of the impact a new treatment
      might have on the course of schizophrenia and possibly biasing the results. The
      present study examines the relative effectiveness of risperidone and typical
      antipsychotics in patients being treated for their first episode of
      schizophrenia. METHOD: From a cohort of 126 patients, 2 groups of 19
      first-episode DSM-III-R/DSM-IV schizophrenia patients matched for age, gender,
      length of illness, and length of treatment and treated with either a typical
      antipsychotic or risperidone for a minimum of 1 year were compared on a number of
      outcome dimensions during their course of treatment and at follow-up. Treatment
      allocation was not random, and patients were judged to be compliant with
      medication. Patients treated with typical antipsychotics were followed up for a
      statistically nonsignificantly longer time (mean = 2.7 vs. 1.9 years). RESULTS:
      Six patients (31.6%) from the typical antipsychotic group were admitted to the
      hospital within the first year following the index admission compared with 1
      patient (5.3%) in the risperidone group (admitted at month 14). Patients in the
      risperidone group showed a statistically significantly lower length of first
      hospitalization (p < .01), utilization of inpatient beds during the course of
      treatment (p < .001), and use of anticholinergic medication (p < .05). There were
      no statistically significant differences in symptom levels, either during the
      course of treatment or at follow-up; in the use of antidepressant, antianxiety,
      or mood-stabilizing drugs; or in changes in living circumstances or employment.
      CONCLUSION: These findings confirm at least equal long-term efficacy of typical
      antipsychotics and risperidone, but a possible advantage for risperidone in
      decreased service utilization and decreased use of anticholinergic drugs.

TI  - Neuropsychological change in patients with schizophrenia after treatment with
      quetiapine or haloperidol.
PG  - 137-49
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of quetiapine, a recently introduced second
      generation antipsychotic medication, in reducing cognitive impairment in patients
      with schizophrenia. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial.
      PATIENTS: 25 patients who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
      Disorders, fourth edition, (DSM-IV) criteria for schizophrenia were recruited
      from 3 Canadian hospitals. INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME MEASURES: After a 48-hour
      washout period, 25 patients with schizophrenia were randomly assigned to
      double-blind treatment with quetiapine or haloperidol for 6 months and evaluated 
      with rating scales for psychotic symptoms, mood and extrapyramidal side effects, 
      as well as standardized neuropsychological measures sensitive to 6 cognitive
      domains: fine motor skill, attention span, verbal reasoning and fluency,
      visuospatial construction and fluency, executive skills and visuomotor tracking, 
      and immediate recall of verbal and nonverbal materials. The measures were
      repeated 8 weeks and 6 months after treatment was initiated. RESULTS: Quetiapine 
      improved psychosis and mood without inducing extrapyramidal symptoms. Quetiapine 
      also had beneficial effects on cognitive skills, particularly verbal reasoning
      and fluency skills and immediate recall, with additional improvements on
      executive skills and visuomotor tracking and on the average of the 6 cognitive
      domains with sustained treatment. Patients taking haloperidol showed improvements
      in general clinical status, but no specific improvements on the positive
      syndrome, the negative syndrome, depression ratings or cognitive skills.
      CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results support the potential value of quetiapine 
      for improving cognitive impairment in patients with schizophrenia and emphasize
      the importance of further research with this promising atypical antipsychotic.

TI  - Effects of olanzapine and other antipsychotics on cognitive function in chronic
      schizophrenia: a longitudinal study.
PG  - 17-28
AB  - This study aimed to determine the effect of olanzapine and other antipsychotic
      drugs on cognitive functions after 6months of treatment. Baseline, 3month and
      6month psychopathological and cognitive evaluations were made. Thirty-eight
      partially responsive outpatients with DSM-IV chronic schizophrenia diagnosis were
      included in the study. On the indication of their attending psychiatrists, 21
      patients initiated treatment with olanzapine, and 17 remained on their previous
      treatment with other antipsychotic drugs. Cognitive assessments were blind to
      medication and psychopathological status. The olanzapine group presented a
      significantly greater improvement in negative symptomatology and verbal memory
      than the comparison group in repeated-measures of MANOVAs between baseline,
      3month and 6month assessments. These differences remained statistically
      significant after covarying out gender, treatment with other atypical
      antipsychotics, biperidene doses and changes in positive and negative symptoms.
      In order to match previous differences between groups, cognitive baseline scores 
      for each test were introduced as covariates, resulting in a significant
      improvement for the olanzapine group in negative symptomatology and the
      interference task of the Stroop test.We then re-analyzed the data, dividing the
      comparison group into two groups: risperidone-treated patients (n=9) and patients
      receiving conventional antipsychotic drugs (n=8). Post-hoc analyses between
      groups were carried out with baseline cognitive assessment as covariate. The
      olanzapine group improved significantly more than the risperidone group in
      negative symptomatology and in the interference task of Stroop test. The
      improvement in the number of categories of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test was
      higher in risperidone patients than in those receiving olanzapine or conventional
      antipsychotic treatment. Conventional antipsychotic drugs did not present a
      significant improvement over atypical antipsychotic drugs in any cognitive
      function. In summary, in patients suffering from chronic schizophrenia, atypical 
      antipsychotic agents were associated with slight differential improvements over
      time in attentional, verbal memory and executive functions compared with
      conventional neuroleptic drugs. No differential improvements were found in social
      functioning, verbal fluency, non-verbal domains of memory or visuo-motor
      abilities.

TI  - Response to placebo among bipolar I disorder patients experiencing their first
      manic episode.
PG  - 332-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: The first episode of an illness may respond differently to any
      treatment compared to multiple episodes of the same illness. This study details
      the treatment response of six first-episode manic patients who participated in a 
      previously reported study of 139 subjects comparing olanzapine to placebo in
      bipolar I mania (Tohen M, Sanger TM, McElroy SL, Tollefson GD, Chengappa KNR,
      Daniel DG. Olanzapine versus placebo in the treatment of acute mania. Am J
      Psychiatry 1999; 156: 702-709). METHODS: Six first-episode subjects participated 
      in a 3-week double-blind, random assignment, parallel group, placebo-controlled
      study of olanzapine for bipolar mania. The Young Mania Rating Scale (Y-MRS),
      Clinical Global Impression, and Hamilton Depression ratings were administered
      weekly. Lorazepam as rescue medication was permitted for the first 10 days.
      RESULTS: Five subjects were randomized to placebo and one to olanzapine. Two
      subjects (40%) with psychotic mania (who also had their first-illness episode)
      were assigned to placebo and responded with greater than 50% reduction in the
      Y-MRS score and also remitted in 3 weeks. Another placebo-assigned subject had a 
      46% reduction in the Y-MRS scores, and two placebo-assigned subjects worsened.
      The olanzapine-assigned subject had a 44% reduction in the Y-MRS score. In
      contrast, 34 of 69 (48.6%) multiple-episode olanzapine subjects responded and 14 
      of 61 (23.0%) of placebo-treated subjects did. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary data
      set suggest there may be differences in treatment response between first-illness 
      episode versus multi-episode bipolar manic subjects. Larger numbers of subjects
      with these illness characteristics are needed to either confirm or refute this
      suggestion.

TI  - Long-term olanzapine treatment: weight change and weight-related health factors
      in schizophrenia.
PG  - 92-100
AB  - BACKGROUND: Weight change and the weight-related health factors of nonfasting
      serum glucose, serum cholesterol, and diastolic blood pressure levels were
      analyzed in patients with DSM-III-R schizophrenia and related disorders who
      received treatment with olanzapine for up to 3 years, and comparisons were made
      to patients treated with haloperidol. Baseline body mass index (BBMI; kg/m2) and 
      dose (mg/day) were investigated as predictors of long-term weight change
      experienced during olanzapine treatment. METHOD: This analysis retrospectively
      examined 573 patients receiving olanzapine and 103 patients receiving haloperidol
      for 39 weeks or more from a study of 1,996 patients randomly assigned 2:1 to
      either olanzapine, 5 to 20 mg/day, or haloperidol, 5 to 20 mg/day. After 6 weeks 
      of acute therapy, patients continued for 1 year or more with either double-blind 
      or open-label olanzapine therapy or double-blind haloperidol therapy. RESULTS:
      Mean weight gain for olanzapine-treated patients observed for a median of 2.54
      years trended toward a plateau after the first 39 weeks of treatment with a
      last-observation-carried-forward mean weight change of 6.26 kg (13.8 lb) and a
      median of 5.90 kg (13.0 lb). This was significantly higher than that for
      haloperidol-treated patients, whose mean weight gain was 0.69 kg (1.5 lb) after
      1.15 years (p < .001). Patients with higher BBMI (> 27.6) gained significantly
      less weight during treatment with olanzapine than their lighter counterparts
      (BBMI < 27.6) (p < .001). The effect of olanzapine dose on weight was not
      significant (p > or = . 183). Median serum glucose at endpoint was not
      significantly associated (p = .096) with weight change for olanzapine. Median
      serum cholesterol and diastolic blood pressure for olanzapine-treated patients at
      endpoint showed a relationship with weight change that was statistically (p < or 
      = .001) but not clinically significant. The difference in incidence of elevated
      serum glucose, cholesterol, or diastolic blood pressure between olanzapine and
      haloperidol therapy groups was not different (p > .05). CONCLUSION: Mean weight
      gain during olanzapine treatment trended toward a plateau after the initial 39
      weeks of treatment with no further significant gain out to 3 years. Higher BBMI
      was predictive of a lower long-term weight gain, while dose was not a significant
      predictor of greater longer term weight change. The relationship between weight
      change and glucose was not statistically significant. The association between
      weight change and changes in cholesterol as well as changes in diastolic blood
      pressure was statistically significant but not considered clinically relevant
      based on the ranges observed.

TI  - Olanzapine versus risperidone. A prospective comparison of clinical and economic 
      outcomes in schizophrenia.
PG  - 567-79
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical and economic outcomes associated with
      olanzapine and risperidone treatment for schizophrenia. DESIGN AND SETTING: An
      international, multicentre, double-blind, prospective study. To facilitate
      economic comparisons, our sample was restricted to patients enrolled in US sites.
      150 patients with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of mental disorders, 4th
      edition (DSM-IV) diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or
      schizophreniform disorder were randomised to therapy with either olanzapine 10 to
      20 mg/day (n = 75) or risperidone 4 to 12 mg/day (n = 75) for a maximum of 28
      weeks. In addition to tolerability and efficacy assessments, use of health
      services was assessed at baseline and prospectively, at 8-week intervals and at
      study completion. Clinically important response, defined as a 40% improvement in 
      the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score, maintenance of response and
      rates of treatment-emergent extrapyramidal symptoms were compared between groups.
      Direct medical costs were estimated by assigning standardised prices to resource 
      units. Median total, inpatient/outpatient service and medication acquisition
      costs were compared between treatment groups. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS: 
      The mean modal dosages for the olanzapine and risperidone treatment groups were
      17.7 +/- 3.4 mg/day and 7.9 +/- 3.2 mg/day, respectively. Olanzapine-treated
      patients were more likely to maintain response compared with risperidone-treated 
      patients (p = 0.048). In addition, a smaller proportion of olanzapine-treated
      patients required anticholinergic therapy compared with risperidone-treated
      patients (25.3 vs 45.3%; p = 0.016). Total per patient medical costs over the
      study interval were $US2843 (1997 values) [36%] lower in the olanzapine treatment
      group than in the risperidone treatment group (p = 0.342). Medication costs were 
      significantly higher for olanzapine-treated patients ($US2513 vs $US1581; p <
      0.001), but this difference was offset by a reduction of $US3774 (52%) in
      inpatient/outpatient service costs for olanzapine-treated patients in comparison 
      with risperidone-treated patients ($US3516 vs $US7291, p = 0.083). Median cost
      findings were consistent with results observed using other robust measures of
      central tendency and provide conservative estimates of potential savings that may
      be obtained from olanzapine therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In this study,
      olanzapine-treated patients experienced clinical improvements that translated
      into savings in costs of care for both inpatient and outpatient services. These
      savings offset the difference in medication acquisition cost between olanzapine
      and risperidone.

TI  - Refractory schizophrenia and atypical antipsychotics.
PG  - 409-18
AB  - Treatment resistant or refractory schizophrenia is a difficult to define
      condition of largely unknown prevalence. For 10 years, clozapine has been the
      standard treatment in this condition and is recognized unequivocally as being
      effective. However, clozapine is sometimes poorly tolerated and has the potential
      for severe toxicity. Partly as a result of this, other atypicals have recently
      been evaluated as treatments for refractory schizophrenia. In order to evaluate
      the evidence base relating to the drug treatment of refractory schizophrenia, we 
      developed a refractoriness rating based on previous work. Using this rating, we
      assessed all trials of atypicals in schizophrenia unresponsive to at least one
      drug. Overall, clozapine was consistently shown to be effective in refractory
      schizophrenia, even when stringently defined. Data relating to olanzapine and
      risperidone are equivocal at best, and there is some evidence to suggest that
      they are less effective than clozapine. There is essentially no cogent evidence
      to support the use of any other atypical in refractory schizophrenia. Clozapine
      remains the drug of choice in this condition.

TI  - Double-blind comparison of olanzapine versus clozapine in schizophrenic patients 
      clinically eligible for treatment with clozapine.
PG  - 52-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: The treatment of schizophrenic patients who fail to respond to
      adequate trials of neuroleptic drugs is a major challenge. Clozapine has been one
      treatment option; however, it is not universally effective and is limited in its 
      use by safety concerns. With the introduction of newer agents, their performance 
      relative to clozapine is of great clinical interest. METHODS: The primary
      objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of olanzapine
      versus clozapine among treatment resistant DSM-IV schizophrenic patients. The
      study was primarily designed to demonstrate the "noninferiority" of olanzapine
      compared to clozapine after 18 weeks of double-blind treatment. Conclusions were 
      based on the one-sided lower 95% confidence limit about the treatment effect
      observed from the primary efficacy variable (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale
      [PANSS] Total). RESULTS: Mean changes from baseline to end point in PANSS Total
      score, using a last observation carried forward technique, showed that both
      agents were comparably effective in neuroleptic resistant patients, i.e.,
      demonstrated the "noninferiority" of olanzapine when compared to clozapine.
      Overall, significantly fewer olanzapine-treated patients (4%) discontinued for an
      adverse event than their clozapine-treated (14%) counterparts (p =.022). Among
      spontaneously reported adverse events, increased salivation, constipation,
      dizziness, and nausea were reported significantly more often among
      clozapine-treated patients, whereas only dry mouth was reported more often among 
      olanzapine-treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Olanzapine was demonstrated to be
      noninferior to clozapine and better tolerated among resistant schizophrenic
      patients clinically eligible for treatment with clozapine.

TI  - Risperidone versus haloperidol in psychotic patients with disturbing
      neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal symptoms: a double-blind, multi-center trial.
PG  - 97-105
AB  - BACKGROUND: A randomized, double-blind, multi-center trial was started to compare
      the severity of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) during risperidone and haloperidol 
      treatment in schizophrenic patients who had disturbing EPS during their previous 
      neuroleptic treatment. Additional objectives of this trial were comparing the
      antipsychotic effectiveness of the two treatments and the use of antiparkinsonian
      medication. METHODS: Effects of flexible doses of risperidone and haloperidol
      were compared in 77 psychotic patients (83% with chronic schizophrenia) with
      disturbing neuroleptic-induced EPS (risperidone 40 patients, haloperidol 37). The
      trial was completed by 47 patients: 25 in the risperidone group (12 women, 13
      men), and 22 in the haloperidol group (10 women, 12 men). RESULTS: An adequate
      antipsychotic effect was obtained in most patients by both treatments. The
      primary aim of this trial was comparing parkinsonism measured with the
      extrapyramidal syndrome rating scale (ESRS) during treatment with risperidone and
      haloperidol. Two primary parameters were selected: the change from baseline to
      the worst score during treatment of ESRS II (parkinsonism) and ESRS VI (clinical 
      global impression of severity of parkinsonism). The CGI of severity of
      parkinsonism was better with risperidone (P=0.025), while the parkinsonism total 
      score tended to be better with risperidone (P<0. 10). Before the double-blind
      treatment, 34 (of the 77) had used antiparkinson medication (risperidone 18,
      haloperidol 16). During the double-blind treatment phase, 21 patients had used
      antiparkinson medication (risperidone 11, haloperidol 10). The larger reduction
      of parkinsonism in the risperidone group was not due to a difference in the use
      of anti-parkinsonian medication. CONCLUSIONS: In this group of schizophrenic
      patients with disturbing EPS during previous neuroleptic treatment, a stronger
      reduction of parkinsonism was observed with risperidone than with haloperidol.

TI  - Atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of schizophrenia: systematic overview
      and meta-regression analysis.
PG  - 1371-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop an evidence base for recommendations on the use of atypical
      antipsychotics for patients with schizophrenia. DESIGN: Systematic overview and
      meta-regression analyses of randomised controlled trials, as a basis for formal
      development of guidelines. SUBJECTS: 12 649 patients in 52 randomised trials
      comparing atypical antipsychotics (amisulpride, clozapine, olanzapine,
      quetiapine, risperidone, and sertindole) with conventional antipsychotics
      (usually haloperidol or chlorpromazine) or alternative atypical antipsychotics.
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Overall symptom scores. Rate of drop out (as a proxy for
      tolerability) and of side effects, notably extrapyramidal side effects. RESULTS: 
      For both symptom reduction and drop out, there was substantial heterogeneity
      between the results of trials, including those evaluating the same atypical
      antipsychotic and comparator drugs. Meta-regression suggested that dose of
      conventional antipsychotic explained the heterogeneity. When the dose was </=12
      mg/day of haloperidol (or equivalent), atypical antipsychotics had no benefits in
      terms of efficacy or overall tolerability, but they still caused fewer
      extrapyramidal side effects. CONCLUSIONS: There is no clear evidence that
      atypical antipsychotics are more effective or are better tolerated than
      conventional antipsychotics. Conventional antipsychotics should usually be used
      in the initial treatment of an episode of schizophrenia unless the patient has
      previously not responded to these drugs or has unacceptable extrapyramidal side
      effects.

TI  - Long-Term use of quetiapine in elderly patients with psychotic disorders.
PG  - 1068-84
AB  - BACKGROUND: Quetiapine is an atypical antipsychotic agent that does not appear to
      increase patient risk for treatment-emergent extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) or
      anticholinergic symptoms. Previous studies of quetiapine use in elderly patients 
      with schizophrenia and other psychoses examined short-term administration (< or =
      12 weeks). Given the growing elderly population, the commensurate increase in
      elderly patients with psychoses, and the expected increase in disease
      treatment-years, the effect of long-term quetiapine administration in older
      patients is of considerable interest. OBJECTIVE: This study assesses the
      long-term tolerability, safety, and clinical benefit of quetiapine in elderly
      patients with psychosis. METHODS: Elderly patients (> or = 65 years of age) with 
      psychotic disorders, as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
      Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, participated in this 52-week, open-label,
      multicenter trial. Investigators increased (and later adjusted) daily doses of
      quetiapine on the basis of clinical response and tolerability, and assessed
      safety and efficacy. Efficacy assessments were made using the 18-item Brief
      Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Clinical Global Impressions (CGI), Simpson-Angus
      Scale, and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS). For patients who
      withdrew before week 52, analyses were performed using observed data and the last
      observation carried forward. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-four patients with
      psychotic disorders (98 women and 86 men) with a mean age of 76.1 years entered
      the trial. Seventy-two percent had psychotic disorders due to general medical
      conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, and 28% had other psychotic disorders,
      most commonly schizophrenia. Overall, 89 (48%) patients completed treatment
      through 52 weeks. Median total daily dose was 137.5 mg. Reasons, for withdrawal
      included lack of efficacy (19%), adverse events or intercurrent illness (15%),
      failure to return for follow-up (13%), protocol noncompliance (3%), and
      diminished need for treatment (2%). Somnolence (31%), dizziness (17%), and
      postural hypotension (15%) were common adverse events, but they rarely resulted
      in withdrawal from therapy. EPS-related adverse events occurred in 13% of
      patients. At end point (week 52), mean total score on the Simpson-Angus Scale had
      decreased from baseline by 1.8 points, whereas changes in AIMS scores were
      negligible. No clinically important effects were reported relative to mean
      changes in hematologic, thyroid function, or hepatic function variables.
      Quetiapine treatment appeared to have no associated cardiovascular adverse
      outcomes despite cardiovascular comorbidities and unrestricted use of concomitant
      cardiovascular medications. Significant decreases in BPRS total score (n = 170, P
      < 0.001) and CGI Severity of Illness item score (n = 177, P < 0.002) were seen at
      end point (observed data and last observation carried forward). Decreases of > or
      = 20% in mean BPRS total score were observed in 83 (49%) patients. CONCLUSIONS:
      These results provide preliminary information to clinicians regarding
      tolerability, safety, and clinical improvement with quetiapine in elderly
      patients with psychotic symptoms, and support controlled studies of quetiapine in
      this patient population.

TI  - Olanzapine treatment of psychotic and behavioral symptoms in patients with
      Alzheimer disease in nursing care facilities: a double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled trial. The HGEU Study Group.
PG  - 968-76
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) commonly exhibit psychosis and
      behavioral disturbances that impair patient functioning, create caregiver
      distress, and lead to institutionalization. This study was conducted to assess
      the efficacy and safety of olanzapine in treating psychosis and/or
      agitation/aggression in patients with AD. METHODS: A multicenter, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, 6-week study was conducted in 206 elderly US nursing home
      residents with AD who exhibited psychotic and/or behavioral symptoms. Patients
      were randomly assigned to placebo or a fixed dose of 5, 10, or 15 mg/d of
      olanzapine. The primary efficacy measure was the sum of the Agitation/Aggression,
      Hallucinations, and Delusions items (Core Total) of the Neuropsychiatric
      Inventory-Nursing Home version. RESULTS: Low-dose olanzapine (5 and 10 mg/d)
      produced significant improvement compared with placebo on the Core Total (-7.6 vs
      -3.7 [P<.001] and -6.1 vs -3. 7 [P =.006], respectively). Core Total improvement 
      with olanzapine, 15 mg/d, was not significantly greater than placebo. The
      Occupational Disruptiveness score, reflecting the impact of patients' psychosis
      and behavioral disturbances on the caregiver, was significantly reduced in the
      5-mg/d olanzapine group compared with placebo (-2.7 vs -1.5; P =.008). Somnolence
      was significantly more common among patients receiving olanzapine (25.0%-35.8%), 
      and gait disturbance occurred in those receiving 5 or 15 mg/d (19.6% and 17.0%,
      respectively). No significant cognitive impairment, increase in extrapyramidal
      symptoms, or central anticholinergic effects were found at any olanzapine dose
      relative to placebo. CONCLUSION: Low-dose olanzapine (5 and 10 mg/d) was
      significantly superior to placebo and well tolerated in treating
      agitation/aggression and psychosis in this population of patients with AD.

TI  - Functional outcomes in schizophrenia: a comparison of olanzapine and haloperidol 
      in a European sample.
PG  - 245-55
AB  - The primary aim of this study was to compare functional outcomes between patients
      with schizophrenia treated with olanzapine or haloperidol in Europe. The sample
      consisted of European patients from a large, international, double-blind,
      randomized clinical trial. Patients were randomized to receive either olanzapine 
      (n = 520) or haloperidol (n = 258) for a 6-week acute phase followed by a 46-week
      maintenance phase for responders. Olanzapine-treated patients experienced
      superior improvements compared to haloperidol-treated patients on all efficacy
      measures assessed in both phases. A greater percentage of olanzapine-treated
      patients had > or = 20% improvement in the Quality of Life Scale total score
      during both the acute (50.0% versus 31.0%, P = 0.071) and maintenance (69.5%
      versus 41.7%, P = 0.006) phases compared to haloperidol-treated patients. For
      patients who entered the maintenance phase as outpatients, olanzapine-treated
      patients were significantly less likely to require subsequent hospitalization
      compared to haloperidol-treated patients (P = 0.001). A significantly greater
      percentage of the olanzapine group compared to the haloperidol group worked
      part-time or full-time (15.1% versus 5.3%, P = 0.018), participated in useful
      work > or = 75% of the time (21.0% versus 10.5%, P = 0.038), and socialized more 
      than once a month (53.8% versus 37.9%, P = 0.004) during the maintenance phase.
      The findings from this study suggest that olanzapine's clinical profile leads to 
      reduced hospitalization and improvements in work and social functioning superior 
      to that achieved with haloperidol treatment.

TI  - Efficacy of olanzapine in acute bipolar mania: a double-blind, placebo-controlled
      study. The Olanzipine HGGW Study Group.
PG  - 841-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: We compared the efficacy and safety of olanzapine vs placebo for the 
      treatment of acute bipolar mania. METHODS: Four-week, randomized, double-blind,
      parallel study. A total of 115 patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar
      disorder, manic or mixed, were randomized to olanzapine, 5 to 20 mg/d (n = 55),
      or placebo (n = 60). The primary efficacy measure was the Young-Mania Rating
      Scale (Y-MRS) total score. Response and euthymia were defined, a priori, as at
      least a 50% improvement from baseline to end point and as a score of no less than
      12 at end point in the Y-MRS total score, respectively. Safety was assessed using
      adverse events, Extrapyramidal Symptom (EPS) rating scales, laboratory values,
      electrocardiograms, vital signs, and weight change. RESULTS: Olanzapine-treated
      patients demonstrated a statistically significant greater mean (+/- SD)
      improvement in Y-MRS total score than placebo-treated patients (-14.8 +/- 12.5
      and -8.1 +/- 12.7, respectively; P<.001), which was evident at the first
      postbaseline observation 1 week after randomization and was maintained throughout
      the study (last observation carried forward). Olanzapine-treated patients
      demonstrated a higher rate of response (65% vs 43%, respectively; P =.02) and
      euthymia (61% vs 36%, respectively; P =. 01) than placebo-treated patients. There
      were no statistically significant differences in EPSs between groups. However,
      olanzapine-treated patients had a statistically significant greater mean (+/- SD)
      weight gain than placebo-treated patients (2.1 +/- 2.8 vs 0.45 +/- 2.3 kg,
      respectively) and also experienced more treatment-emergent somnolence (21
      patients [38.2%] vs 5 [8.3% ], respectively). CONCLUSION: Olanzapine demonstrated
      greater efficacy than placebo in the treatment of acute bipolar mania and was
      generally well tolerated.

TI  - Haematological safety of antipsychotic drugs.
PG  - 283-8
AB  - Many clinicians have become concerned about the safety of new antipsychotics
      particularly in view of the association of agranulocytosis with clozapine and of 
      aplastic anaemia with remoxipride. The Committee on Safety of Medicines and
      Medicines Control Agency 'yellow card' post-marketing surveillance data were
      analysed for reports of haemopoietic disorders with the 16 antipsychotics in
      common use. Corrections for relative risk were made in three separate ways: (i)
      control for degree of use, using Northern Ireland prescribing data for 1995; (ii)
      percentage of total reports from 1963 to 1996; and (iii) examination of the first
      5 years' post-marketing data only. After clozapine and remoxipride the highest
      risks of haemopoietic reactions appeared to be associated with the aliphatic
      phenothiazine derivatives thioridazine and chlorpromazine. There is therefore no 
      evidence of any increased risk with high-potency drugs such as haloperidol or
      pimozide or with the newer drugs such as sulpiride or risperidone. Continued
      vigilance, however, is necessary as more new atypicals become available and begin
      to be widely prescribed.

TI  - Low incidence of persistent tardive dyskinesia in elderly patients with dementia 
      treated with risperidone.
PG  - 1150-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors studied the incidence of tardive dyskinesia in elderly
      institutionalized patients with dementia being treated with risperidone. METHOD: 
      After participating in a 12-week multicenter double-blind study during which they
      received placebo or one of three doses of risperidone, 330 patients (mean
      age=82.5 years) with Alzheimer's, vascular, or mixed dementia were enrolled in a 
      1-year open-label study during which they received flexible doses of risperidone.
      Persistent emergent tardive dyskinesia was defined according to scores on the
      dyskinesia subscale of the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale. RESULTS: The mean
      modal risperidone dose was 0.96 mg/day (SD=0.53), and the median length of
      risperidone use was 273 days. The 1-year cumulative incidence of persistent
      emergent tardive dyskinesia among the 255 patients without dyskinesia at baseline
      was 2.6%. Patients with dyskinetic symptoms at baseline experienced significant
      reductions in the severity of dyskinesia. Patients who received 0.75-1.5 mg/day
      of risperidone showed a significant improvement in psychopathologic symptoms over
      the 1-year period. CONCLUSIONS: Although there was no control group, the observed
      incidence of persistent tardive dyskinesia with risperidone seemed to be much
      lower than that seen in elderly patients treated with conventional neuroleptics. 
      The average optimal dose of risperidone in elderly dementia patients was found to
      be 0.75-1.5 mg/day.

TI  - A comparison of the effects of quetiapine ('seroquel') and haloperidol in
      schizophrenic patients with a history of and a demonstrated, partial response to 
      conventional antipsychotic treatment. PRIZE Study Group.
PG  - 121-31
AB  - Quetiapine ('Seroquel') is a well-tolerated, novel, atypical antipsychotic with
      consistent efficacy in the treatment of schizophrenia. To date, no clinical
      studies have evaluated the effect of quetiapine in patients who only partially
      respond to conventional antipsychotics, yet this type of patient is most
      frequently seen by psychiatrists. Therefore, this international, multicentre,
      double-blind study was conducted to compare the efficacy and tolerability of 8
      weeks' treatment of quetiapine 600 mg/day with haloperidol 20 mg/day in 288
      patients who had a history of partial response to conventional antipsychotics and
      displayed a partial or no response to 1 month of fluphenazine (20 mg/day)
      treatment. Patients on quetiapine tended to have greater improvement than those
      on haloperidol in the primary efficacy measure, mean Positive and Negative
      Symptom Scale (PANSS) score, after 4 weeks' treatment (-9.05, -5.82,
      respectively, P = 0.061) and at study end (-11.50, -8.87, respectively, P =
      0.234). Similarly, there was a trend towards patients on quetiapine demonstrating
      greater improvements in the secondary efficacy measures (Clinical Global
      Impression, PANSS subscale and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale scores) [week 4
      (baseline) to week 12 (end)], but the difference between treatments did not reach
      significance. Significantly more patients on quetiapine than on haloperidol
      showed a clinical response-patient response rates, defined as > 20% reduction in 
      PANSS total score between weeks 4 and 12, were 52.2% for quetiapine and 38.0% for
      haloperidol (P = 0.043). Patients receiving quetiapine required less
      anticholinergic medication (P < 0.011), had greater reduction in extrapyramidal
      symptoms (EPS) (P = 0.005) and fewer treatment-emergent EPS-related adverse
      events compared to those on haloperidol (P < 0.001). Serum prolactin
      concentrations were elevated at the end of fluphenazine treatment in 73% of
      patients. Between weeks 4 and 12, elevated serum prolactin concentrations
      significantly decreased in quetiapine-treated patients compared to those
      receiving haloperidol (P < 0.001). At the end of quetiapine treatment, 83% of
      patients had normal prolactin levels while only 21% of patients receiving
      haloperidol were within the normal range. These results suggest that quetiapine
      may make a valuable contribution to the management of patients with a history of 
      partial response to conventional antipsychotics.

TI  - Atypical antipsychotics and weight gain--a systematic review.
PG  - 416-32
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review systematically data relating to weight changes with atypical
      antipsychotics. METHOD: We conducted a Medline search on October 29 1999 and
      covered the period 1980-99. All recovered papers were examined for further
      relevant reports. In addition, we wrote to pharmaceutical manufacturers and 10
      practising clinicians to ask them to provide other relevant reports known to
      them. RESULTS: Eighty reports mentioning change in body weight were retrieved.
      Data relating to weight changes were of variable quality. Weight changes were
      indicated by a variety of measures. The majority of reports related to short-term
      changes. CONCLUSION: All atypical drugs, with the exception of ziprasidone, have 
      been associated with weight increases. Clozapine seems to have the highest risk
      of weight gain, followed by olanzapine and quetiapine. There is probably a lower 
      risk with risperidone, sertindole and zotepine and a still lower risk with
      amisulpride. Ziprasidone appears not to be associated with weight gain. In the
      absence of more compelling data, these rankings must be considered approximate
      and preliminary. Longer, more robust trials are needed.

TI  - A long-term, multicenter, open-label study of risperidone in elderly patients
      with psychosis. On behalf of the Risperidone Working Group.
PG  - 506-14
AB  - RATIONALE: Studies have shown that risperidone is safe and efficacious in young
      and middle-aged adults with chronic schizophrenia, but considerably fewer data
      are available on the treatment of elderly patients with schizophrenia or other
      psychotic disorders, particularly long-term outcomes. OBJECTIVE: A 12-month,
      open-label study was conducted to assess the effects of risperidone in elderly,
      chronically ill, psychotic patients. METHODS: This study enrolled 180 elderly,
      chronically ill, psychotic patients (median age, 72 years [range 54-89]), 97 of
      whom completed the 12-month study. At endpoint, the mean dose of risperidone was 
      3.7 mg/day. RESULTS: Clinical improvement (> or =20% reduction in Positive and
      Negative Syndrome Score [PANSS] total score) was achieved by 54% of patients at
      endpoint. There were significant reductions in PANSS total, subscale (positive,
      negative, and general psychopathology), and cognition cluster scores at endpoint 
      (p<0.001). Clinical Global Impressions severity of illness scores showed
      continued improvement through month 12 (p<0.001). In contrast, PANSS data from a 
      historical comparable control group of patients receiving conventional
      antipsychotic agents showed no symptom improvement over a 12-month treatment
      period. The severity of preexisting extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) in patients
      treated with risperidone decreased significantly from baseline to endpoint
      (p<0.001), and the use of antiparkinsonian medication decreased from 41.1% of
      patients before the trial to 25.6% during the trial. There were no spontaneous
      reports of tardive dyskinesia (TD) and the incidence of assessed TD was 4.3% in
      contrast to the expected 26% reported in middle-aged and elderly patients
      receiving conventional antipsychotic agents for 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term
      treatment with risperidone was associated with continued symptom improvement, a
      decrease in the severity of preexising EPS, and a low incidence of TD in elderly 
      psychotic patients.

TI  - The safety of olanzapine compared with other antipsychotic drugs: results of an
      observational prospective study in patients with schizophrenia (EFESO Study).
      Pharmacoepidemiologic Study of Olanzapine in Schizophrenia.
PG  - 335-43
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Results of controlled clinical trials should be confirmed through
      safety and effectiveness studies in nonselected patient cohorts treated according
      to routine clinical practice. METHOD: Outpatients with schizophrenia (ICD-10
      criteria) entered this prospective, naturalistic study when they received a new
      prescription for an antipsychotic drug. Treatment assignment was based on purely 
      clinical criteria, as the study did not include any experimental intervention.
      Safety was evaluated through the collection of spontaneous adverse events and a
      specific questionnaire for extrapyramidal symptoms. Global clinical status was
      measured through the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) and the Global 
      Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scales. RESULTS: From the 2967 patients included,
      2128 patients were treated with olanzapine as monotherapy or combined with other 
      drugs (olanzapine group), and 821 were treated with other antipsychotic drugs as 
      monotherapy or combined with other drugs (control group). There were no
      statistical differences between treatment groups at baseline regarding age,
      gender, disease duration, or severity of symptoms. Olanzapine was well tolerated 
      and effective in this study. Overall incidence of adverse events was
      significantly lower in the olanzapine group compared with the control group (p < 
      .001). Somnolence and weight gain were significantly more frequent in the
      olanzapine group, and akathisia, dystonia, extrapyramidal syndrome, hypertonia,
      hypokinesia, and tremor were significantly higher in the control group. Clinical 
      improvement at endpoint, measured through the mean change in the CGI-S and the
      GAF, was significantly higher in the olanzapine group compared with the control
      group (p = .004). CONCLUSION: These results show that olanzapine is safe and
      effective in nonselected schizophrenic outpatients and are consistent with the
      efficacy and safety profile that olanzapine has shown in previous controlled
      clinical trials.

TI  - Clozapine, diabetes mellitus, weight gain, and lipid abnormalities: A five-year
      naturalistic study.
PG  - 975-81
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The goal of this 5-year naturalistic study of patients treated with
      clozapine was to examine the incidence of treatment-emergent diabetes mellitus in
      relation to other factors, including weight gain, lipid abnormalities, age,
      clozapine dose, and treatment with valproate. METHOD: Data on age, gender, race, 
      diagnosis, family history of diabetes, and age at clozapine initiation were
      collected from medical records of 82 outpatients with schizophrenia or
      schizoaffective disorder. Clozapine dose, data on use of valproate, and
      laboratory test results were recorded at 6-month intervals. RESULTS: The mean age
      at the time of clozapine initiation of the 82 patients was 36.4 years; 26.8% of
      the patients were women, and 91.5% were Caucasian. The mean baseline weight was
      175.5 lb, and the mean body mass index was 26.9 kg/m(2). Thirty patients (36.6%) 
      were diagnosed with diabetes during the 5-year follow-up. Weight gain, use of
      valproate, and total daily dose of clozapine were not significant risk factors
      for developing diabetes mellitus. Patients experienced significant weight gain
      that continued until approximately month 46 from initiation of clozapine. There
      was a nonsignificant increase in total serum cholesterol and a significant
      increase in serum triglycerides level. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the
      hypotheses that patients treated with clozapine experience significant weight
      gain and lipid abnormalities and appear to be at increased risk for developing
      diabetes.

TI  - Sudden death in patients receiving clozapine treatment: a preliminary
      investigation.
PG  - 325-7
AB  - The risk of sudden death during clozapine treatment is controversial. The authors
      present a review of sudden deaths that occurred at Sha'ar Menashe Mental Health
      Center between January 1991 and August 1997. The number of cases of deceased
      inpatients was retrieved from the hospital's computerized database and divided
      into three groups: sudden death, suicide, and disease-related death. Copies of
      mandatory reports of sudden death filed with the Ministry of Health were
      obtained, and the corresponding patient records were reviewed. The rates of
      sudden death, suicide, and disease-related deaths were calculated for
      clozapine-treated patients (CTPs) during and after treatment and for patients
      treated with other psychiatric agents (non-CTPs). Among 561 CTPs, there were 4
      sudden deaths during treatment, 2 sudden deaths after treatment, 2 suicides
      during treatment, and 2 disease-related deaths during treatment. Among 4918
      non-CTPs, there were 14 sudden deaths, 5 suicides, and 86 disease-related deaths,
      all of which occurred during treatment with other psychiatric agents. CTPs who
      experienced sudden death were 10.37 years younger and healthier than non-CTPs who
      experienced sudden death. The sudden death rate was 3.8 times higher for CTPs
      than for non-CTPs, whereas the rate of disease-related death was 5 times higher
      for non-CTPs than for CTPs. Contrary to expectations, the rate of suicide among
      patients currently receiving clozapine in this sample was 3.6 times higher than
      among non-CTPs. Because CTPs who experienced sudden death were also younger and
      healthier, it seems that treatment with clozapine may present a greater risk for 
      sudden death than treatment with other psychiatric medications. The limited
      number of sudden death cases and deaths from other causes should be noted so that
      these findings are considered with caution.

TI  - Longitudinal comparative study of risperidone and conventional neuroleptics for
      treating patients with schizophrenia. The Quebec Schizophrenia Study Group.
PG  - 295-304
AB  - This study compared the long-term (12 months) effectiveness of risperidone (RP)
      with that of conventional neuroleptics (CNs) in a population with chronic
      schizophrenia who had shown suboptimal response to CNs. A randomized, open,
      parallel, multicenter design was used. One hundred eighty-four subjects meeting
      DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia were randomly assigned to receive either RP or 
      a CN, and 165 of them completed the follow-up. Outcome measures were taken at 3, 
      6, and 12 months and included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)
      and the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale. Within this 12-month follow-up, RP
      was found to be superior to CNs in terms of both the average change in score from
      baseline on the PANSS (p = 0.006) and the proportion of good responders (as
      defined by a 20% decrease in total PANSS scores;p = 0.03). For positive symptoms,
      the effectiveness of the RP treatment tended to increase over time. At 12 months,
      the percentage of good responders in the RP group was twice as large as that in
      the CN group (30% vs. 15%;p = 0.03). The superiority of RP over CNs was constant 
      over the three dose categories. In both the RP and the CN groups, the maximum
      decrease in psychopathology was achieved with the lowest dose range. A worsening 
      of akathisia was less frequent in subjects receiving RP than in those receiving
      CNs (p = 0.02). In conclusion, this study showed that, compared with CNs, RP is
      beneficial in the treatment of patients with chronic schizophrenia and that some 
      of these benefits may appear only after longer-term treatment.

TI  - An assessment of clinical practice of clozapine therapy for veterans.
PG  - 669-71
AB  - Clozapine therapy for 2,996 patients with treatment-refractory schizophrenia was 
      examined over a five-year period in the Veterans Affairs health care system.
      Patients were assessed with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and the
      Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS). BPRS scores, which were available for
      522 patients, indicated a significant improvement, as did AIMS scores, which were
      available for 252 patients. Compared with individuals who showed a modest
      improvement, those with a more robust response to clozapine had higher initial
      BPRS scores and were three times more likely to have been suicidal in the month
      before starting clozapine therapy.

TI  - Neuropsychological change in early phase schizophrenia during 12 months of
      treatment with olanzapine, risperidone, or haloperidol. The Canadian
      Collaborative Group for research in schizophrenia.
PG  - 249-58
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this investigation was to test the efficacy of novel
      antipsychotic medications in the treatment of cognitive impairment in early phase
      schizophrenia. METHODS: Sixty-five patients in this multicenter double-blind
      study were randomly assigned to olanzapine (5-20 mg), risperidone (4-10 mg), or
      haloperidol (5-20 mg). Standard measures of clinical and motor syndromes were
      administered, as well as a comprehensive battery of tests to assess (1) motor
      skills, (2) attention span, (3) verbal fluency and reasoning, (4) nonverbal
      fluency and construction, (5) executive skills, and (6) immediate recall at
      baseline and after 6, 30, and 54 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: The general
      cognitive index derived from the 6 domain scores revealed a significantly greater
      benefit from treatment with olanzapine relative to haloperidol and olanzapine
      relative to risperidone, but no significant difference was shown between
      risperidone and haloperidol. The improvement related to olanzapine was apparent
      after 6 weeks and enhanced after 30 and 54 weeks of treatment. Exploratory
      within-group analyses of the 6 cognitive domains after a conservative Bonferroni 
      adjustment revealed a significant improvement with olanzapine only on the
      immediate recall domain, and similar analyses of the 17 individual tests revealed
      a significant improvement with olanzapine only on the Hooper Visual Organization 
      Test. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that olanzapine has some superior cognitive
      benefits relative to haloperidol and risperidone. A larger sample replication
      study is necessary to confirm and generalize the observations of this study and
      begin evaluation of the implications of this change to cerebral function and
      quality of life for people with schizophrenia.

TI  - Blood dyscrasias in clozapine-treated patients in Italy.
PG  - 233-7
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Clozapine is a dibenzodiazepine derivative that is more
      effective than standard neuroleptic drugs in refractory schizophrenic patients,
      but its introduction in some countries was delayed by its propensity to cause
      blood dyscrasias. However, over the last ten years, different reports have
      clearly demonstrated that agranulocytosis and neutropenia can be easily prevented
      by means of strict hematologic surveillance. This article reviews the results of 
      the first five years of the Italian Clozapine Monitoring System (ICLOS). DESIGN
      AND METHODS: The hematologic parameters of 2,404 patients registered between 1995
      and 1999 were collected in a central database, before the patients began
      clozapine-treatment, weekly for the first 18 weeks, and then monthly throughout
      the duration of therapy. On the basis of conventional criteria, different risk
      levels have been identified with total leukocyte <3. 0x10(9)/L and/or an absolute
      neutrophil count <1.5x10(9)/L leading to immediate discontinuation of the drug.
      RESULTS: The analysis shows that 0.9% of the patients developed neutropenia and
      0.7% agranulocytosis, mainly during the first 18 weeks of clozapine treatment.
      Drug discontinuation led to the normalization of hematologic parameters in all
      cases, and the use of growth factors reduced the risk of infectious
      complications. Transient leukocytosis and eosinophilia were also observed but
      these did not have any serious clinical effects. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: 
      The ICLOS study confirms that regular hematologic monitoring is highly effective 
      in minimizing the incidence of clozapine-associated blood dyscrasias. The lower
      than initially expected rates of agranulocytosis and associated deaths are
      encouraging in view of the benefits of this drug in treatment-resistant
      schizophrenia and other neurologic disorders.

TI  - Effects of atypical neuroleptics on sustained attention deficits in
      schizophrenia: a trial of risperidone versus haloperidol.
PG  - 311-9
AB  - To help determine whether sustained attention deficits as measured with the
      Continuous Performance Test (CPT) are stable vulnerability indicators of
      schizophrenia, we compared the CPT performance of schizophrenic patients before
      and after treatment with risperidone or haloperidol. In this double blind trial, 
      56 schizophrenic patients were randomly assigned to a 12-week regimen of either
      risperidone or haloperidol, after a 1-week washout period. The patients undertook
      two sessions of the CPT (undegraded and 25% degraded) twice, one at the end of
      the washout period and the other at the end of the study. Thirty-eight patients
      completed the study, 19 in each group. Both groups experienced significant
      improvements in clinical symptoms, and the risperidone group showed no change in 
      the severity of extrapyramidal symptoms. Despite those improvements, the CPT
      performance indexes did not change significantly from the beginning to the end of
      the study. These findings indicate that sustained attention deficits might be
      stable vulnerability indicators of schizophrenia.

TI  - Risperidone in the treatment of first-episode psychotic patients: a double-blind 
      multicenter study. Risperidone Working Group.
PG  - 721-9
AB  - An international, multicenter, double-blind study was conducted in 183 patients
      with a first psychotic episode (provisional schizophreniform disorder or
      schizophrenia; DSM-III-R) treated with flexible doses of risperidone or
      haloperidol for 6 weeks. At endpoint, 63 percent of risperidone-treated patients 
      and 56 percent of haloperidol-treated patients were clinically improved (> or =
      50% reduction in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total scores). Risperidone 
      was better tolerated than haloperidol: the severity of extrapyramidal symptoms
      was significantly lower in the risperidone-treated patients; significantly fewer 
      risperidone-treated patients required antiparkinsonian medication; and
      significantly fewer discontinued treatment because of adverse events. A post hoc 
      analysis revealed that low doses of these antipsychotics were efficacious in some
      patients. Furthermore, the severity of extrapyramidal symptoms and the use of
      antiparkinsonian medications were significantly lower in patients receiving low
      doses (maximum, < or = 6 mg/day) than high doses (maximum, > 6 mg/day) of
      risperidone or haloperidol. These findings are consistent with the suggestion
      that patients with a first psychotic episode may require low doses of
      antipsychotic medications. Studies designed specifically to compare low and high 
      doses of antipsychotics are warranted to help optimize treatment for these
      patients.

TI  - Amisulpride vs. risperidone in the treatment of acute exacerbations of
      schizophrenia. Amisulpride study group.
PG  - 107-17
AB  - Amisulpride, a substituted benzamide with high selectivity for dopamine D3 and D2
      receptors, was compared with the antipsychotic risperidone in patients with acute
      exacerbations of schizophrenia. The study was double-blind and involved 228
      patients allocated, after a 3-6-day wash-out period, to amisulpride 800 mg (n =
      115) or risperidone 8 mg (n = 113) for 8 weeks. Both treatments produced a marked
      improvement in schizophrenic symptomatology. Decreases in mean BPRS total score
      were 17.7 +/- 14.9 for amisulpride and 15.2 +/- 13.9 for risperidone, and all of 
      the individual factors on the BPRS showed a numerically greater improvement in
      the amisulpride than in the risperidone patients. Both treatments were equally
      effective against positive symptoms on the PANSS positive syndrome subscale;
      however, there was a trend in favor of greater improvement in negative symptoms
      assessed on the PANSS negative subscale in patients receiving amisulpride with a 
      decrease of 6.9 +/- 7.5 vs. 5.3 +/- 6.6 for risperidone (P = 0.09). Both drugs
      demonstrated good safety profiles, and scores on neurological scales (SAS, AIMS, 
      and BAS) did not increase during treatment. A comparable proportion of patients
      received antiparkinsonian medication, 30 and 23% in the amisulpride and
      risperidone groups, respectively (P = 0.21). Patients receiving risperidone
      experienced an increase in body weight, which was significantly greater than for 
      amisulpride (P = 0.026).

TI  - Antipsychotic-induced weight gain: a comprehensive research synthesis.
PG  - 1686-96
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to estimate and compare the effects of
      antipsychotics-both the newer ones and the conventional ones-on body weight.
      Method: A comprehensive literature search identified 81 English- and
      non-English-language articles that included data on weight change in
      antipsychotic-treated patients. For each agent, a meta-analysis and random
      effects metaregression estimated the weight change after 10 weeks of treatment at
      a standard dose. A comprehensive narrative review was also conducted on all
      articles that did not yield quantitative information but did yield important
      qualitative information. RESULTS: Placebo was associated with a mean weight
      reduction of 0.74 kg. Among conventional agents, mean weight change ranged from a
      reduction of 0.39 kg with molindone to an increase of 3.19 kg with thioridazine. 
      Among newer antipsychotic agents, mean increases were as follows: clozapine, 4.45
      kg; olanzapine, 4.15 kg; sertindole, 2.92 kg; risperidone, 2.10 kg; and
      ziprasidone, 0.04 kg. Insufficient data were available to evaluate quetiapine at 
      10 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Both conventional and newer antipsychotics are associated 
      with weight gain. Among the newer agents, clozapine appears to have the greatest 
      potential to induce weight gain, and ziprasidone the least. The differences among
      newer agents may affect compliance with medication and health risk.

TI  - A randomized trial of risperidone, placebo, and haloperidol for behavioral
      symptoms of dementia.
PG  - 946-55
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare effects of risperidone with placebo (efficacy and
      tolerability) and haloperidol (tolerability) for treating demented patients with 
      aggression and other behavioral symptoms. METHODS: A 13-week double-blind study
      involving 344 patients with dementia randomly assigned to receive placebo or
      flexible doses (0.5 to 4 mg/d) of risperidone or haloperidol. Behavioral symptoms
      were assessed by the Behavior Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale
      (BEHAVE-AD), the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), and the Clinical
      Global Impression (CGI) scale. Tolerability assessments included the
      Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale, sedation levels, Functional Assessment
      Staging, Mini-Mental State Examination, and incidence of adverse events. RESULTS:
      The mean dose at endpoint was 1.1 mg/d of risperidone and 1.2 mg/d of
      haloperidol. Although not significant, a higher percentage of patients receiving 
      risperidone than those receiving placebo showed clinical improvement (> or =30%
      reduction from baseline to endpoint in BEHAVE-AD total score) at endpoint and
      week 12. Reductions in the BEHAVE-AD total score were significantly greater with 
      risperidone than with placebo at week 12. In a further analysis of aggression,
      the most dominant symptom in these patients, BEHAVE-AD and CMAI aggression
      cluster scores were significantly reduced compared with placebo at endpoint and
      week 12. CGI scores were also significantly reduced at endpoint and week 12.
      Severity of extrapyramidal symptoms with risperidone did not differ significantly
      from that of placebo and was less than that of haloperidol. A post hoc analysis
      showed significantly greater reductions in the BEHAVE-AD aggressiveness score
      with risperidone than haloperidol at week 12. CONCLUSION: Low-dose risperidone
      (mean 1.1 mg/d) was well tolerated and associated with reductions in the severity
      and frequency of behavioral symptoms, particularly aggression, in elderly
      patients with dementia.

TI  - Olanzapine versus haloperidol in the treatment of schizophrenia and other
      psychotic disorders: quality of life and clinical outcomes of a randomized
      clinical trial.
PG  - 417-26
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little information is available on the impact of the atypical
      antipsychotic olanzapine on quality of life (QOL). A 6-week, double-blind
      randomized multicenter trial, with a long-term extension, was conducted to
      evaluate the clinical efficacy and QOL of olanzapine and haloperidol in treating 
      schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. METHODS: A total of 828 outpatients 
      provided QOL data. Study patients were aged greater than 18 years with a
      DSM-III-R diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, or
      schizoaffective disorder and baseline BPRS (items scored on 0-6 scale) total
      scores, > or = 18 were randomized to 6 weeks of treatment with olanzapine 5 to 20
      mg/day or haloperidol 5 to 20 mg/day. Patients entered a 46-week double-blind
      extension if they demonstrated minimal clinical response and were tolerant to
      study medication. The Quality of Life Scale (QLS) and SF-36 Health Survey were
      used to evaluate QOL. RESULTS: During the 6-week acute phase, olanzapine
      treatment significantly improved BPRS total (p = 0.004), PANSS total scores (p = 
      0.043), QLS total (p = 0.005), intrapsychic foundations (p < 0.001) and
      interpersonal relations scores (p = 0.036), and SF-36 mental component summary
      scores (p < 0.001) compared with haloperidol. During the extension phase,
      olanzapine treatment significantly improved PANSS negative scores (p = 0.035) and
      improved QLS total (p = 0.001), intrapsychic foundations (p < 0.001), and
      instrumental role category scores (p = 0.015) versus haloperidol treatment.
      Significantly more haloperidol patients discontinued treatment due to adverse
      events during the acute and extension phases (p = 0.041 and p = 0.014,
      respectively). Changes in QLS total and MCS scores were associated with changes
      in clinical symptoms, depression scores and extrapyramidal symptoms. CONCLUSIONS:
      Olanzapine was more effective than haloperidol in reducing severity of
      psychopathology and in improving QOL in patients with schizophrenia and other
      psychotic disorders. The QOL benefits of olanzapine, although modest, may be
      important for long-term treatment.

TI  - Risperidone versus haloperidol on secondary memory: can newer medications aid
      learning?
PG  - 223-32
AB  - The introduction of the new generation of antipsychotic medications for the
      treatment of schizophrenia has been accompanied by a growing interest in the
      neurocognitive effects of these drugs. The present study compared the effects of 
      risperidone and haloperidol on secondary memory in a group of treatment-resistant
      schizophrenia patients. The study design included a baseline phase and two
      double-blind phases in which patients were randomly assigned to medication under 
      two different dose conditions (fixed dose and flexible dose). Secondary memory
      was assessed at baseline, fixed-dose, and flexible-dose phases, using the
      California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT). Six measures were selected, which formed 
      three factors (general verbal learning ability, retention, and learning
      strategy). Risperidone-treated patients showed greater improvement than
      haloperidol-treated patients in general verbal learning ability, a finding
      characterized by significant treatment effects on CVLT measures of learning
      acquisition, recall consistency, and recognition memory. After controlling for
      benztropine status, differences on the measures of learning acquisition and
      recall consistency remained significant, and differences in recognition memory
      weakened slightly (p = 0.07). No significant treatment effects were noted on
      retention or learning strategy. These findings suggest that risperidone may exert
      a facilitating effect on the acquisition of new verbal information, an effect
      that does not appear to be due to the activation of semantic encoding strategies.

TI  - Rehospitalization rates of patients recently discharged on a regimen of
      risperidone or clozapine.
PG  - 863-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine rehospitalization rates of
      people receiving risperidone or clozapine who had been discharged from state
      psychiatric hospitals in Maryland. METHOD: Rehospitalization status was monitored
      for all patients discharged from state psychiatric facilities on a regimen of
      either risperidone or clozapine between March 14, 1994, and Dec. 31, 1995.
      Patients were followed up with respect to readmission until Dec. 31, 1996. Time
      to readmission was measured by the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) formula. Risk
      factors associated with rehospitalization were examined. RESULTS: One hundred
      sixty patients were discharged on risperidone, 75 having the diagnosis of
      schizophrenia. The patients with schizophrenia were more likely to be readmitted 
      than the 85 patients with other mental disorders. Recidivism rates for
      schizophrenic patients discharged on risperidone versus those discharged on
      clozapine were not significantly different over the 24-month study period.
      However, no patient who received clozapine and remained discharged for more than 
      10 months (N = 49) was readmitted, while the readmission rate for
      risperidone-treated patients appeared to be steady up to 24 months. At 24 months 
      87% of the clozapine-treated patients and 66% of the risperidone-treated patients
      remained in the community. No clinical or demographic variables were found to
      predict rehospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the
      rehospitalization rates of patients taking the second-generation antipsychotics
      risperidone and clozapine are lower than those in previously published reports of
      conventional antipsychotic treatment.

TI  - Olanzapine versus placebo in the treatment of acute mania. Olanzapine HGEH Study 
      Group.
PG  - 702-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary intent of this study was to compare the efficacy and
      safety of olanzapine and placebo in the treatment of acute mania. METHOD: The
      design involved a random-assignment, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel
      group study of 3 weeks' duration. After a 2- to 4-day screening period, qualified
      patients were assigned to either olanzapine (N = 70) or placebo (N = 69).
      Patients began double-blind therapy with either olanzapine, 10 mg, or placebo
      given once per day. After the first day of treatment, the daily dose could be
      adjusted upward or downward, as clinically indicated, by one capsule (olanzapine,
      5 mg/day) within the allowed range of one to four capsules. The primary efficacy 
      measure in the protocol was defined as a change from baseline to endpoint in
      total score on the Young Mania Rating Scale. Clinical response was defined a
      priori as a decrease of 50% or more from baseline in Young Mania Rating Scale
      total score. RESULTS: The olanzapine group experienced significantly greater mean
      improvement in Young Mania Rating Scale total score than the placebo group. On
      the basis of the clinical response criteria, significantly more
      olanzapine-treated patients (48.6%) responded than those assigned to placebo
      (24.2%). Somnolence, dizziness, dry mouth, and weight gain occurred significantly
      more often with olanzapine. There were no statistically significant differences
      between the olanzapine-treated and placebo-treated patients with respect to
      measures of parkinsonism, akathisia, and dyskinesias. No discontinuations of
      treatment due to adverse events occurred in the olanzapine treatment group.
      CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study suggest that compared with placebo,
      olanzapine has superior efficacy for the symptoms of acute mania.

TI  - A comparison of the effect of clozapine with typical neuroleptics on cognitive
      function in neuroleptic-responsive schizophrenia.
PG  - 1-11
AB  - Clozapine has been reported to improve selected aspects of cognitive function in 
      neuroleptic-resistant schizophrenia. In this study, we report the first direct
      comparison of the effect of clozapine and typical neuroleptic drugs on cognitive 
      function in neuroleptic-responsive schizophrenia. Sixty-four patients with recent
      onset, neuroleptic-responsive schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were
      randomly assigned to either clozapine (n = 35) or typical neuroleptics (n = 29)
      and followed for 12 months. They were administered a comprehensive cognitive test
      battery at baseline and at 6 weeks, 6 months and 12 months after initiating drug 
      treatment. Treatment with clozapine improved psychomotor speed and attention
      [Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST)] and verbal fluency [Category Instance
      Generation and Controlled Word Association Test (CWAT)] at 6 weeks. The
      improvement in these measures was maintained throughout the 12-month period.
      Treatment with typical neuroleptics produced no sustained improvement in any
      cognitive measure, except for a tendency to improve delayed recall memory (Verbal
      List Learning Test). The improvement in the DSST and CWAT was significantly
      greater with clozapine treatment compared to that with typical neuroleptics.
      These improvements were not related to improvement in psychopathology. These
      results suggest that clozapine is superior to typical neuroleptics in improving
      specific types of cognitive function in recent onset, neuroleptic-responsive
      schizophrenia.

      and long-term therapy.
PG  - 15-22
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of antipsychotic monotherapy in schizoaffective
      disorder is limited, and further constrained by safety concerns. AIMS: We aimed
      to compare the efficacy, tolerability and safety profile of the new
      pharmaceutical, olanzapine, with haloperidol. METHOD: Data were assessed from 300
      DSM-III-R schizoaffective subjects from a larger double-blind prospective
      international study. Subjects were randomly allocated to six weeks of olanzapine 
      (5-20 mg) or haloperidol (5-20 mg) treatment; responders were followed for up to 
      one year of double-blind, long-term maintenance therapy. RESULTS:
      Olanzapine-treated patients achieved a statistically significant greater
      improvement than haloperidol treated patients on overall measures of efficacy,
      including clinical response. Significantly fewer olanzapine patients left the
      study early, and fewer adverse events were observed among those receiving
      olanzapine. During maintenance, olanzapine-treated patients continued to
      experience additional improvement, with fewer EPS but more weight gain than those
      on haloperidol. CONCLUSIONS: Olanzapine demonstrated substantial advantages over 
      the conventional antipsychotic haloperidol in the management of schizoaffective
      disorder.

      Study Group.
PG  - 491-505
AB  - In this double-blind study, patients with an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia 
      or schizoaffective disorder were randomized to receive either ziprasidone 80
      mg/day (n = 106) or 160 mg/day (n = 104) or placebo (n = 92), for 6 weeks. Both
      doses of ziprasidone were statistically significantly more effective than placebo
      in improving the PANSS total, BPRS total, BPRS core items, CGI-S, and PANSS
      negative subscale scores (p < .05). Ziprasidone 160 mg/day significantly improved
      depressive symptoms in patients with clinically significant depression at
      baseline (MADRS > or = 14, over-all mean 23.5) (p < .05) as compared with
      placebo. The percentage of patients experiencing adverse events was similar in
      each treatment group, and resultant discontinuation was rare. The most frequent
      adverse events associated with ziprasidone were generally mild dyspepsia, nausea,
      dizziness, and transient somnolence. Ziprasidone was shown to have a very low
      liability for inducing movement disorders and weight gain. The results indicate
      that ziprasidone is effective and well tolerated in the treatment of the
      positive, negative, and depressive symptoms of an acute exacerbation of
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.

TI  - Comparison of risperidone and placebo for psychosis and behavioral disturbances
      associated with dementia: a randomized, double-blind trial. Risperidone Study
      Group.
PG  - 107-15
AB  - BACKGROUND: We report the findings from the first large, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      risperidone in the treatment of psychotic and behavioral symptoms in
      institutionalized elderly patients with dementia. METHOD: 625 patients (67.8%
      women; mean age = 82.7 years) with DSM-IV diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease (73%),
      vascular dementia (15%), or mixed dementia (12%) and significant psychotic and
      behavioral symptoms were included. Each patient was randomly assigned to receive 
      placebo or 0.5 mg/day, 1 mg/day, or 2 mg/day of risperidone for 12 weeks. The
      primary outcome measure was the Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease
      rating scale (BEHAVE-AD). RESULTS: The study was completed by 70% of the
      patients. Baseline Functional Assessment Staging scores were 6 or 7 in more than 
      95% of the patients, indicating severe dementia. At endpoint, significantly
      greater reductions in BEHAVE-AD total scores and psychosis and aggressiveness
      subscale scores were seen in patients receiving 1 and 2 mg/day of risperidone
      than in placebo patients (p = .005 and p < .001, respectively). At week 12, 0.5
      mg/day of risperidone was superior to placebo in reducing BEHAVE-AD aggression
      scores (p = .02). More adverse events were reported by patients receiving 2
      mg/day of risperidone than 1 mg/day. The most common dose-related adverse events 
      were extrapyramidal symptoms, somnolence, and mild peripheral edema. The
      frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms in patients receiving 1 mg/day of
      risperidone was not significantly greater than in placebo patients. CONCLUSION:
      Risperidone significantly improved symptoms of psychosis and aggressive behavior 
      in patients with severe dementia. Results show that 1 mg/day of risperidone is an
      appropriate dose for most elderly patients with dementia.

TI  - Comparative efficacy of olanzapine and haloperidol for patients with
      treatment-resistant schizophrenia.
PG  - 403-11
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is relatively little information regarding the efficacy of
      newer atypical antipsychotic drugs for patients with schizophrenia who are
      treatment-resistant to neuroleptic agents. Several lines of evidence suggest that
      a clinical trial of olanzapine in this population is warranted. METHODS: A
      subpopulation of patients (n = 526) meeting treatment-resistant criteria selected
      from a large, prospective, double-blind, 6-week study assessing the efficacy and 
      safety of olanzapine and haloperidol were examined. Both
      last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) and completers (observed cases) analyses 
      were conducted. RESULTS: Olanzapine demonstrated significantly greater mean
      improvement from baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)
      negative symptoms, comorbid depressive symptoms assessed by the Montgomery-Asberg
      Depression Rating Scale, akathisia as measured by Barnes Akathisia Scale, and
      extrapyramidal symptoms as measured by Simpson-Angus Extrapyramidal Rating Scale 
      with both LOCF and completers analyses. In addition, olanzapine was significantly
      superior to haloperidol for Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale total (p = .006),
      PANSS total (p = .005), and PANSS positive symptoms (p = .017) in completers of
      the 6-week study. Significantly greater response rates were observed in
      olanzapine-treated (47%) than haloperidol-treated (35%) patients in the LOCF
      analysis (p = .008), but significance was not reached in the completers analysis 
      (p = .093). Mean doses (+/- SD) of olanzapine and haloperidol were 11.1 +/- 3.4
      mg/day and 10.0 +/- 3.6 mg/day, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Olanzapine was
      superior to haloperidol for key symptom domains and parkinsonian side effects.
      Implications of these data for the therapeutics of this severely ill subgroup are
      discussed.

TI  - Clozapine and risperidone in chronic schizophrenia: effects on symptoms,
      parkinsonian side effects, and neuroendocrine response.
PG  - 294-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Clozapine and risperidone were the first two "second-generation"
      antipsychotic drugs approved for schizophrenia. There is currently little
      information about their comparative efficacy from head-to-head clinical trials.
      The purpose of this study was to examine the comparative efficacy of clozapine
      and risperidone for positive and negative symptoms, depression, parkinsonian side
      effects, and indexes of neuroendocrine function in schizophrenic patients who met
      a priori criteria for partial response to traditional neuroleptic agents. METHOD:
      After a baseline fluphenazine treatment period, 29 patients participated in a
      6-week, double-blind, parallel-group comparison of the effects of these agents.
      RESULTS: Clozapine was superior to risperidone for positive symptoms and
      parkinsonian side effects, but there were no significant differences between the 
      drugs on two measures of negative symptoms, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale total 
      scores, and depression scores. The clozapine patients, but not the risperidone
      patients, demonstrated significant reductions from the fluphenazine baseline in
      positive symptoms, total symptoms, and depression. In addition, clozapine
      produced fewer effects on plasma prolactin than risperidone or fluphenazine. The 
      mean daily doses during week 6 of the trial were 403.6 mg of clozapine and 5.9 mg
      of risperidone. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study indicate that these
      drugs have both important differences and similarities in their comparative
      efficacy in chronically ill, partially responsive patients with schizophrenia.
      Further research on second-generation antipsychotic drugs in this patient
      population that addresses key methodological issues, such as optimal dose and
      treatment duration, are needed.

      quetiapine, risperidone, and sertindole compared to conventional antipsychotics
      and placebo. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
PG  - 51-68
AB  - The objective of this meta-analysis is to summarize the efficacy and tolerability
      of the new antipsychotics risperidone, olanzapine, sertindole and quetiapine in
      schizophrenia compared to placebo and conventional antipsychotics. The main
      results are: (1) All of the 4 new drugs are more effective than placebo, but the 
      magnitude of the effect is only moderate [mean effect size, r, of all
      antipsychotics vs. placebo = 0.25, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) =
      0.22-0.28, n = 2477]. (2) According to the studies published to date, sertindole 
      and quetiapine are as effective as haloperidol, and risperidone and olanzapine
      are slightly more effective than haloperidol in the treatment of global
      schizophrenic symptomatology. (3) With respect to negative symptoms, all new
      antipsychotics are more effective than placebo. However, contrary to widespread
      opinion, so is the 'conventional' antipsychotic haloperidol. Risperidone and
      olanzapine are slightly superior, sertindole is as effective and--according to
      the only study fully published to date--quetiapine is even slightly less
      effective than haloperidol in this regard. (4) All new antipsychotics are
      associated with less frequent use of antiparkinson medication than haloperidol,
      with risperidone appearing to have a slightly less favourable EPS-profile than
      the other new antipsychotics. The methodological limitations of this review, the 
      generalizability of the results and expectations from future research are
      discussed.

TI  - Olanzapine versus haloperidol treatment in first-episode psychosis.
PG  - 79-87
AB  - OBJECTIVE: It has been hypothesized that the morbidity and mortality associated
      with schizophrenia can be prevented by providing effective treatment during the
      first episode of psychosis. Hence, the authors examined patients with
      first-episode psychosis to determine the efficacy and safety of olanzapine and
      haloperidol treatment. METHOD: A subpopulation of first-episode patients (N=83)
      from a large prospective, multicenter, international, double-blind, 6-week acute 
      treatment study was evaluated. These patients were selected from a pool of 1,996 
      patients who had a DSM-III-R diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective
      disorder, or schizophreniform disorder and who also met the following criteria:
      1) the length of their current psychotic episode had to be 5 or fewer years, and 
      2) patients had to be 45 years of age or younger at onset of first psychotic
      symptoms. RESULTS: Compared to haloperidol, olanzapine showed a statistically
      significantly greater reduction in the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS)
      total and negative scores and in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total
      and positive scores. Clinical response (defined as 40% or greater improvement in 
      BPRS total score from baseline) was also statistically significantly higher in
      olanzapine-treated patients (67.2%) than in haloperidol-treated patients (29.2%).
      Olanzapine-treated patients further showed statistically significant improvements
      in the Simpson-Angus scale and Barnes Akathisia Scale scores, while
      haloperidol-treated patients showed a worsening on both measures. Compared to
      olanzapine-treated multiple-episode patients in the parent study,
      olanzapine-treated first-episode patients achieved an even statistically
      significantly higher response. Haloperidol-treated first-episode patients
      experienced statistically significantly more extrapyramidal symptoms than
      haloperidol-treated multiple-episode patients. CONCLUSIONS: In patients
      experiencing first-episode psychosis, olanzapine had a risk-benefit profile
      significantly superior to that of haloperidol. The study results suggest that
      novel antipsychotic agents such as olanzapine should be considered as a preferred
      option in first-episode psychosis, on the basis of both safety and efficacy
      advantages.

TI  - Ziprasidone 40 and 120 mg/day in the acute exacerbation of schizophrenia and
      schizoaffective disorder: a 4-week placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 173-84
AB  - A double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study, was performed to evaluate 
      the efficacy and safety of ziprasidone in 139 patients with an acute exacerbation
      of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Patients were randomized to receive
      ziprasidone 40 mg/day, 120 mg/day or placebo for 28 days. Ziprasidone 120 mg/day 
      was significantly more effective than placebo in improving the BPRS total, CGI-S.
      BPRS depression cluster and BPRS anergia cluster scores (all P < 0.05).
      Similarly, the percentages of patients classified as responders on the BPRS (> or
      = 30% reduction) and the CGI improvement (score < or = 2) were significantly
      greater with ziprasidone 120 mg/day compared with placebo (P < 0.05). The number 
      of patients who experienced an adverse event was similar in all three treatment
      groups, and discontinuation due to adverse events was rare (five of 91
      ziprasidone-treated patients). The most frequently reported adverse events, that 
      were more common in either ziprasidone group than in the placebo group, were
      dyspepsia, constipation, nausea and abdominal pain. There was a notably low
      incidence extrapyramidal side-effects (including akathisia) and postural
      hypotension and no pattern of laboratory abnormalities or apparent weight gain.
      Ziprasidone-treated patients were not clinically different from placebo-treated

TI  - Suicide prevention effects associated with clozapine therapy in schizophrenia and
      schizoaffective disorder.
PG  - 1029-33
AB  - OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: Suicide is a significant cause of death among patients
      with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, affecting some 10 to 15 percent 
      of these patients. This study examined annual suicide rates over a two-year
      period (1993-1995) among more than 30,000 patients with schizophrenia and
      schizoaffective disorder who received services from the Texas Department of
      Mental Health and Mental Retardation and suicide rates over a six-year period
      (1991-1996) among a subgroup of patients treated with clozapine. RESULTS: The
      annual suicide rate for all patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective
      disorder was 63.1 per 100,000 patients, approximately five times higher than in
      the general population. In contrast, only one suicide occurred in six years among
      patients treated with clozapine who were of similar diagnosis, age, and sex, for 
      a suicide rate of about 12.7 per 100,000 patients per year. This rate is similar 
      to the 15.7 per 100,000 patients per year for all U.S. patients treated with
      clozapine, calculated from data reported as of June 1996 to the clozapine
      national registry system maintained by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, the 
      U.S. manufacturer of clozapine. CONCLUSIONS: The study results suggest that
      clozapine therapy is associated with a reduced risk of suicide among patients
      with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.

TI  - Diminished suicidal and aggressive behavior, high plasma norepinephrine levels,
      and serum triglyceride levels in chronic neuroleptic-resistant schizophrenic
      patients maintained on clozapine.
PG  - 245-50
AB  - Impulsiveness and aggressiveness may be the most common behavioral correlates of 
      central serotonergic dysfunction. The aim of this study was to determine whether 
      clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic agent with a potent serotonergic
      antagonistic activity, affects impulsiveness and aggression. Its effects on serum
      lipids, platelet-poor plasma serotonin (5-HT), and norepinephrine (NE) levels
      were also studied. Thirty neuroleptic-resistant chronic schizophrenic patients,
      maintained on clozapine for 1 year, were evaluated for aggressiveness,
      impulsiveness, and suicidality in comparison with 30 chronic schizophrenic
      patients maintained on classical antipsychotic agents for the same period of
      time. Clozapine treatment was associated with less impulsiveness (p < 0.05),
      aggressiveness (p < 0.01) and fewer suicidal attempts (p < 0.05). Serum
      triglycerides and plasma NE levels were significantly higher (p < 0.01 and p <
      0.0001, respectively) in the patients treated with clozapine, as compared with
      patients treated with classical neuroleptic drugs. The authors conclude that
      long-term clozapine treatment may be effective in controlling aggressive,
      impulsive, and suicidal behavior in neuroleptic-resistant chronic schizophrenic
      patients. The elevated plasma NE levels in patients treated with clozapine as
      compared to those treated with classical neuroleptic drugs may be relevant for
      the anti-aggressive/antisuicidal activity of clozapine.

TI  - Long-term treatment of chronic schizophrenia with risperidone: an open-label,
      multicenter study of 386 patients.
PG  - 99-106
AB  - An open-label, multicentre study was conducted to assess the long-term efficacy
      and safety of risperidone in patients with chronic schizophrenia. Three hundred
      and eighty-six patients at 70 centres in 11 countries received risperidone (2-16 
      mg/day) for up to 57 weeks; 247 patients were treated for at least 1 year. All
      but 48 patients had been treated with antipsychotic agents before entering the
      trial. The mean (+/- SD) daily risperidone dose at endpoint was 8.6 +/- 4.4 mg.
      The mean total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores were reduced
      significantly from 76.7 at baseline to 67.4 at endpoint (p < 0.001). Even though 
      no patients had acutely exacerbated symptoms at the start of the trial, mean
      scores on each of the PANSS positive, negative, and general psychopathology
      subscales were significantly reduced during the first month of open treatment,
      and these mean scores continued to improve over the course of the trial. At
      endpoint, 64% of patients were rated as improved on the Clinical Global
      Impression change scale. Extrapyramidal symptoms (scores on the Extrapyramidal
      Symptom Rating Scale) tended to decrease in severity or remained unchanged over
      the course of risperidone treatment; 27.7% of patients required antiparkinsonian 
      medication during the study. The results demonstrate that risperidone's efficacy 
      against the positive and negative symptoms of chronic schizophrenia can be
      maintained in long-term treatment with a low incidence of adverse experiences;
      moreover, the drug reduces preexisting extrapyramidal symptoms over time.

TI  - Prevalence of diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance in patients treated with
      clozapine compared with patients treated with conventional depot neuroleptic
      medications.
PG  - 294-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent case reports suggest the association of the emergence of
      diabetes mellitus with clozapine treatment, although conventional neuroleptics
      have also been implicated. This study was conducted to determine if there is an
      increased risk of diabetes mellitus and/or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT)
      during clozapine treatment compared with treatment with conventional depot
      neuroleptics. METHOD: In a district hospital in northern Sweden, blood glucose
      tests and, if necessary an oral glucose tolerance test were used to assess the
      prevalence of diabetes mellitus or IGT in 63 patients treated with clozapine
      compared with 67 patients treated with conventional depot neuroleptics
      (haloperidol, zuclopenthixol, fluphenazine, perphenazine, or flupenthixol).
      Diabetes mellitus and impaired glucose tolerance were classified according to
      World Health Organization criteria. RESULTS: There were 3 dropouts in the
      clozapine group and 4 in the control group. Of subjects treated with clozapine,
      12% (7/60) had type 2 diabetes mellitus, and 10% (6/60) had IGT. Of subjects
      treated with depot injections of neuroleptics, 6% (4/63) had type 2 diabetes
      mellitus and 3% (2/63) had IGT. None in either group had type 1 diabetes
      mellitus. Subjects in the clozapine group were significantly (p < .001) younger
      than subjects in the control group, whereas the 2 groups did not differ with
      respect to body weight, body mass index, or prevalence of diabetes mellitus in
      first-degree relatives. CONCLUSION: Subjects treated with clozapine were more
      often classified as having type 2 diabetes mellitus or IGT compared with subjects
      in the control group. This difference did not, however, achieve statistical
      significance (p=.06).

PG  - 75-8
AB  - The aim of this naturalistic study was to compare the outcome of patients who
      continued on clozapine with that of those who discontinued treatment with this
      drug. Data from 113 patients who commenced clozapine between January 1990 and
      June 1995 were available for analysis. The main outcome measures were
      hospitalization status at each anniversary since starting treatment, and the
      proportion of time spent in hospital by the survey endpoint. On average, patients
      had been ill for 11.8 years (SD 7.9) and had spent a total of 3.5 years (SD 5.3) 
      in hospital, before treatment with clozapine. The mean duration of follow-up was 
      2.5 years (SD 1.25, range: 0.32-5.5), by which time 39 patients (35%) had
      discontinued clozapine. Patients who remained on clozapine (n = 74) were no more 
      likely to have been discharged from hospital than those who discontinued it (n = 
      39) by the end of the first, second or third year of treatment (p < 0.05). Recent
      reports of the cost-effectiveness of clozapine treatment should be interpreted
      with caution.

TI  - Positive and negative symptom response to clozapine in schizophrenic patients
      with and without the deficit syndrome.
PG  - 751-60
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In a preliminary report, the authors observed that clozapine was
      superior to haloperidol in the treatment of positive and negative symptoms in
      stable outpatients with schizophrenia. In this final report, they examine the
      effects of clozapine on positive and negative symptoms in patients with and
      without the deficit syndrome to determine which patients receive the positive
      symptom advantage of clozapine and the extent of clozapine's therapeutic effects 
      on negative symptoms. In addition, they examine the long-term effects of
      clozapine on positive, negative, and affective symptoms, social and occupational 
      functioning, and quality of life. METHOD: Seventy-five outpatients with
      schizophrenia, who met retrospective and prospective criteria for residual
      positive or negative symptoms, were entered into a 10-week double-blind,
      parallel-groups comparison of clozapine and haloperidol. Patients who completed
      the double-blind study were then entered into a 1-year open-label clozapine
      study. RESULTS: For patients who completed the 10-week double-blind study,
      clozapine was superior to haloperidol in treating positive symptoms. This effect 
      was not observed in the intent-to-treat analyses. There was no evidence of any
      superior efficacy or long-term effect of clozapine on primary or secondary
      negative symptoms. Long-term clozapine treatment was associated with significant 
      improvements in social and occupational functioning but not in overall quality of
      life. CONCLUSIONS: For schizophrenic patients who are able to tolerate clozapine 
      therapy, clozapine has superior efficacy for positive symptoms but not negative
      symptoms and is associated with long-term improvements in social and occupational
      functioning for patients with and without the deficit syndrome.

TI  - Risperidone versus haloperidol and amitriptyline in the treatment of patients
      with a combined psychotic and depressive syndrome.
PG  - 111-20
AB  - In a multicenter, double-blind, parallel group trial, the efficacy of risperidone
      (RIS) was compared with a combination of haloperidol and amitriptyline (HAL/AMI) 
      over 6 weeks in patients with coexisting psychotic and depressive symptoms with
      either a schizoaffective disorder, depressive type, a major depression with
      psychotic features, or a nonresidual schizophrenia with major depressive symptoms
      according to DSM-III-R criteria. A total of 123 patients (62 RIS; 61 HAL/AMI)
      were included; the mean daily dosage at endpoint was 6.9 mg RIS versus 9 mg HAL
      combined with 180 mg AMI. Efficacy results for those 98 patients (47 RIS; 51
      HAL/AMI) who completed at least 3 weeks of double-blind treatment revealed in
      both treatment groups large reductions in the Positive and Negative Syndrome
      Scale-derived Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (RIS 37%; HAL/AMI 51%) and the
      Bech-Rafaelsen Melancholia Scale total scores (RIS 51%; HAL/AMI 70%). The
      reductions in the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and the Bech-Rafaelsen
      Melancholia Scale scores in the total group were significantly larger in the
      HAL/AMI group than in the RIS group (p < 0.01), mostly because of significant
      differences in the subgroup of patients suffering from depression with psychotic 
      features, whereas treatment differences in the other diagnostic subgroups were
      not significant. The incidence of extrapyramidal side effects as assessed by the 
      Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale was slightly higher under RIS (37%) than
      under HAL/AMI (31%). Adverse events were reported by 66% of RIS and 75% of
      HAL/AMI patients. The results of this trial suggest that the therapeutic effect
      of HAL/AMI is superior to RIS in the total group of patients with combined
      psychotic and depressive symptoms. However, subgroup differences have to be
      considered.

TI  - Depressive signs and symptoms in schizophrenia: a prospective blinded trial of
      olanzapine and haloperidol.
PG  - 250-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depressive signs and symptoms during the course of schizophrenia are 
      common and have been associated with impaired recovery and a higher risk of
      self-harm. Novel antipsychotic agents introduce new pharmacological avenues that 
      may differentially affect schizophrenic signs and symptoms, including depression.
      METHODS: This was a 17-country investigation of 1996 patients with schizophrenia 
      or a related diagnosis randomly assigned to a blinded, comparative trial of the
      novel antipsychotic agent olanzapine (5-20 mg/d) or the conventional D2
      antagonist haloperidol (5-20 mg/d). Patients were evaluated with the Positive and
      Negative Syndrome Scale, the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, and the
      Simpson-Angus Rating Scale. The trial consisted of a 6-week and a 46-week masked 
      responder maintenance period. RESULTS: At least moderate depressive signs and
      symptoms (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score, > or =16) were seen in
      slightly more than half of this sample. Although both treatments were associated 
      with short-term baseline-to-end point improvement on the Montgomery-Asberg
      Depression Rating Scale, olanzapine-associated improvements were significantly
      superior to those observed with haloperidol (P=.001). Furthermore, the response
      rate for the group receiving olanzapine (> or =50% improvement on the
      Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale after at least 3 weeks of treatment)
      was also significantly higher (P=.008). Analysis demonstrated that improvement in
      positive, negative, and/or extrapyramidal symptoms was associated with mood
      improvement (indirect effect); however, most of the olanzapine treatment effect
      on mood was a primary direct effect (57%) that alone was significantly greater
      than that seen with haloperidol treatment (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Depressive signs
      and symptoms in schizophrenia are responsive to treatment. The pleotrophic
      pharmacological features of olanzapine, through 1 or more non-D2-mediated
      pathways, likely contribute to its superior treatment effect. Better control of
      the mood disorders accompanying schizophrenia holds the possibility for improved 
      patient outcomes.

      of the North American double-blind trial.
PG  - 41-9
AB  - This double-blind study evaluated the impact of treatment with olanzapine
      compared with haloperidol, and placebo on improvements in symptomatology and
      quality of life in patients with a DSM-III-R diagnosis of schizophrenia. A total 
      of 335 patients was randomized to five treatment groups; olanzapine 5 +/- 2.5
      mg/day, olanzapine 10 +/- 2.5 mg/day, olanzapine 15 +/- 2.5 mg/day, haloperidol
      15 +/- 5 mg/day, and placebo. Patients responding to treatment during the 6-week 
      acute phase were eligible to enter a 46-week extension. Efficacy measures
      included the brief psychiatric rating scale total, scale for assessment of
      negative symptoms summary, and clinical global impressions severity scores.
      Quality of life was evaluated using the quality of life scale. Data analyzed
      after 24 weeks of therapy showed that olanzapine was significantly superior to
      placebo in reducing clinical severity and significantly superior to haloperidol
      in reducing negative symptoms in patients responding to acute treatment.
      Furthermore, improvement in quality of life was observed in olanzapine-treated
      responders.

TI  - Double-blind comparison of olanzapine versus risperidone in the treatment of
      schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.
PG  - 407-18
AB  - Olanzapine and risperidone, both second-generation antipsychotic agents,
      represent two different pharmacologic strategies. Although they share some in
      vitro properties, they differ by virtue of their chemical structure, spectrum of 
      receptor binding affinities, animal neuropharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and in
      vivo neuroimaging profile. Based on such differences, it was hypothesized that
      the two compounds would show distinct safety and/or efficacy characteristics. To 
      test this hypothesis, an international, multicenter, double-blind,
      parallel-group, 28-week prospective study was conducted with 339 patients who met
      DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, or schizoaffective 
      disorder. Results of the study indicated that both olanzapine and risperidone
      were safe and effective in the management of psychotic symptoms. However,
      olanzapine demonstrated significantly greater efficacy in negative symptoms
      (Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms summary score), as well as overall
      response rate (> or = 40% decrease in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale
      total score). Furthermore, a statistically significantly greater proportion of
      the olanzapine-treated than risperidone-treated patients maintained their
      response at 28 weeks based on Kaplan-Meier survival curves. The incidence of
      extrapyramidal side effects, hyperprolactinemia, and sexual dysfunction was
      statistically significantly lower in olanzapine-treated than risperidone-treated 
      patients. In addition, statistically significantly fewer adverse events were
      reported by olanzapine-treated patients than by their risperidone-treated
      counterparts. Thus, the differential preclinical profiles of these two drugs were
      also evident in a controlled, clinical investigation. Olanzapine seemed to have a
      risk-versus-benefit advantage.

TI  - A comparison of clozapine and haloperidol in hospitalized patients with
      refractory schizophrenia. Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study Group 
      on Clozapine in Refractory Schizophrenia.
PG  - 809-15
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clozapine, a relatively expensive antipsychotic drug, is widely used 
      to treat patients with refractory schizophrenia. It has a low incidence of
      extrapyramidal side effects but may cause agranulocytosis. There have been no
      long-term assessments of its effect on symptoms, social functioning, and the use 
      and cost of health care. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, one-year,
      double-blind comparative study of clozapine (in 205 patients) and haloperidol (in
      218 patients) at 15 Veterans Affairs medical centers. All participants had
      refractory schizophrenia and had been hospitalized for the disease for 30 to 364 
      days in the previous year. All patients received case-management and
      social-rehabilitation services, as clinically indicated. RESULTS: In the
      clozapine group, 117 patients (57 percent) continued their assigned treatment for
      the entire year, as compared with 61 (28 percent) of the patients in the
      haloperidol group (P<0.001). As judged according to the Positive and Negative
      Syndrome Scale of Schizophrenia, patients in the clozapine group had 5.4 percent 
      lower symptom levels than those in the haloperidol group at all follow-up
      evaluations (mean score, 79.1 vs. 83.6; P=0.02). The differences on a
      quality-of-life scale were not significant in the intention-to-treat analysis,
      but they were significant among patients who did not cross over to the other
      treatment (P=0.003). Over a one-year period, patients assigned to clozapine had
      fewer mean days of hospitalization for psychiatric reasons than patients assigned
      to haloperidol (143.8 vs. 168.1 days, P=0.03) and used more outpatient services
      (133.6 vs. 97.9 units of service, P=0.03). The total per capita costs to society 
      were high -- $58,151 in the clozapine group and $60,885 in the haloperidol group 
      (P=0.41). The per capita costs of antipsychotic drugs were $3,199 in the
      clozapine group and $367 in the haloperidol group (P<0.001). Patients assigned to
      clozapine had less tardive dyskinesia and fewer extrapyramidal side effects.
      Agranulocytosis developed in three patients in the clozapine group; all recovered
      fully. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with refractory schizophrenia and high levels of
      hospital use, clozapine was somewhat more effective than haloperidol and had
      fewer side effects and similar overall costs.

AB  - Two hundred thirty-eight patients treated with either haloperidol or clozapine
      were investigated to shed more light on the incidence and severity of
      antipsychotic-induced liver enzyme increase. Serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase 
      (SGPT) increase was most frequently seen in both treatment groups. When analyzing
      the incidence rates for patients with increased liver enzyme values (serum
      glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, SGPT, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase) that were
      higher than twice the upper limit of the normal range, clozapine-treated patients
      showed an SGPT increase (37.3%) significantly more frequently than patients
      treated with haloperidol (16.6%). Both patients with higher clozapine plasma
      levels and male patients were at a higher risk for an SGPT increase. At least 60%
      of the increase of the different enzymes remitted within the first 13 weeks of
      treatment. In general, the authors conclude that clozapine-induced liver enzyme
      elevation seems to be a common and mostly transient phenomenon.

TI  - Does risperidone improve verbal working memory in treatment-resistant
      schizophrenia?
PG  - 799-804
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Treatment efficacy in schizophrenia is typically defined in terms of
      symptom reduction. However, new antipsychotic medications could potentially have 
      an impact on aspects of disability, such as neurocognitive deficits. The authors 
      evaluated the effects of risperidone on verbal working memory, a memory component
      of theoretical interest because of its link to prefrontal activity and of
      practical interest because of its link to psychosocial rehabilitation. METHOD:
      Verbal working memory of 59 treatment-resistant schizophrenic patients was
      assessed as part of a randomized, double-blind comparison of treatment with
      risperidone and haloperidol. Verbal working memory was measured under both
      distracting and nondistracting conditions at baseline and after 4 weeks of both
      fixed- and flexible-dose pharmacotherapy. RESULTS: Risperidone treatment had a
      greater beneficial effect on verbal working memory than haloperidol treatment
      across testing conditions (with and without distraction) and study phases (fixed 
      and flexible dose). The treatment effect remained significant after the effects
      of benztropine cotreatment, change in psychotic symptoms, and change in negative 
      symptoms were controlled. Neither benztropine status nor symptom changes were
      significantly related to memory performance. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with
      risperidone appears to exert a more favorable effect on verbal working memory
      than treatment with a conventional neuroleptic. The beneficial effect appears to 
      be due, at least partially, to a direct effect of the drug, possibly through
      antagonism of the 5-HT2A receptor. Results from this study suggest that
      pharmacotherapeutic efficacy in schizophrenia treatment could be broadened to
      include impact on neurocognitive abilities.

TI  - Olanzapine versus haloperidol in the treatment of schizophrenia and
      schizoaffective and schizophreniform disorders: results of an international
      collaborative trial.
PG  - 457-65
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This international, multicenter double-blind trial was designed to
      compare the therapeutic profile of an atypical antipsychotic, olanzapine, with
      that of a conventional dopamine D2 antagonist, haloperidol. METHOD: A total of
      1,996 patients at 174 sites in Europe and North America were randomly assigned to
      treatment with olanzapine (N = 1,336) or haloperidol (N = 660) over 6 weeks. The 
      primary efficacy analysis involved the mean change from baseline to endpoint in
      total scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Secondary analyses
      included comparisons of the mean change in positive and negative symptoms,
      comorbid depression, extrapyramidal symptoms, and overall drug safety. RESULTS:
      Olanzapine demonstrated clinical results superior to those of haloperidol on
      overall improvement according to the BPRS and on every secondary measure,
      including depression. Olanzapine was also associated with significantly fewer
      discontinuations of treatment due to lack of drug efficacy or adverse events.
      Substantially more olanzapine-treated patients (66.5%) than haloperidol-treated
      patients (46.8%) completed 6 weeks of therapy. Statistically significant
      advantages of olanzapine treatment were related to 1) change in negative
      symptoms, 2) extrapyramidal symptom profile, 3) effect on prolactin levels, and
      4) response rate. CONCLUSIONS: Olanzapine shows a superior and broader spectrum
      of efficacy in the treatment of schizophrenic psychopathology, with a
      substantially more favorable safety profile, than haloperidol. It meets several
      of the criteria for a novel atypical antipsychotic agent.

PG  - 349-56
AB  - The clinical efficacy of two intensive treatment packages (one including the new 
      antipsychotic risperidone and the other not doing so) was compared with that of
      standard management in 43 patients with long-standing treatment-resistant
      schizophrenia. Significant differences between the groups in terms of total
      positive or total negative symptoms were not demonstrated, but the pattern of
      change between the treatment groups differed, so that benefit in positive
      symptomatology was seen in both intensive treatment groups and in negative
      symptomatology in the intensive treatment/risperidone group and the standard
      group. Changes in general psychopathology were most marked in the risperidone
      group and were compatible with a relatively non-sedative profile. Using the
      Disability Assessment Schedule, substantial significant advantages for the
      intensive treatment groups were found.

TI  - Neutropenia and agranulocytosis in patients receiving clozapine in the UK and
      Ireland.
PG  - 483-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clozapine can cause reversible agranulocytosis and neutropenia. This 
      study documents the occurrence of blood dyscrasias and identifies predisposing
      risk factors. METHOD: An analysis was made of the haematological, demographic,
      and dosage data from a central database on 6316 patients receiving clozapine over
      four and a half years in the UK and Ireland. RESULTS: During the study period,
      2.9% of the patients developed neutropenia and 0.8% developed agranulocytosis.
      The peak incidence of both disorders was in the first 6-18 weeks of treatment.
      Fatal agranulocytosis occurred in 0.03% of patients. After the first year of
      treatment, the incidence of agranulocytosis significantly decreased to the order 
      noted with some phenothiazines. CONCLUSIONS: The use of a patient monitoring
      service kept the haematological risks associated with using clozapine within
      acceptable limits, particularly in view of the benefits of this medication in
      treatment-resistant schizophrenia.

TI  - Differential effect of clozapine on weight: a controlled study.
PG  - 817-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study examined whether clozapine induces more weight gain than
      haloperidol and whether weight gain is related to clinical improvement. METHOD:
      The weight and symptoms of 39 outpatients with schizophrenia who were randomly
      assigned to double-blind treatment with either clozapine or haloperidol were
      assessed. The weight and symptoms of 33 of the patients who chose to take
      clozapine during a 1-year follow-up after the study ended were also assessed.
      RESULTS: The patients treated with clozapine gained significantly more weight
      over baseline (7%) than the haloperidol-treated patients (1%). Weight gain was
      not significantly correlated with improvements in either positive or negative
      symptoms. Fifty-eight percent of the patients followed for 1 year gained at least
      10% over their baseline weight. CONCLUSIONS: Weight gain is an important side
      effect of clozapine and is unrelated to the drug's differential antipsychotic
      efficacy.

PG  - 417-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the side effect +profiles of 
      clozapine and risperidone. METHOD: The subjects were 20 outpatients with
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were clinically stable on a regimen
      of clozapine at the time of screening. They underwent a randomized-order
      crossover comparison of 6 weeks of risperidone treatment and 6 weeks of clozapine
      treatment. Clinical and neurocognitive variables were assessed by raters blind to
      medication status, and severity of side effects was determined from patients'
      self-reports. RESULTS: Side effect measures, but not clinical ratings, were
      significantly different after 6 weeks of treatment with the two drugs. Patients
      required more benztropine for motor effects and complained of more insomnia with 
      risperidone and more sedation with clozapine. Body weight was higher at the end
      of clozapine treatment than at the end of risperidone treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      this exploratory study, the side effect profiles of clozapine and risperidone
      were consistent with the different pharmacodynamic profiles of the two drugs.

TI  - Olanzapine versus placebo and haloperidol: acute phase results of the North
      American double-blind olanzapine trial.
PG  - 111-23
AB  - Olanzapine is a potential new "atypical" antipsychotic agent. The double-blind
      acute phase of this study compared three dosage ranges of olanzapine (5 +/- 2.5
      mg/day [Olz-L], 10 +/- 2.5 mg/day [Olz-M], 15 +/- 2.5 mg/day [Olz-H]) to a dosage
      range of haloperidol (15 +/- 5 mg/day [Hal]) and to placebo in the treatment of
      335 patients who met the DSM-III-R criteria for schizophrenia. In overall
      symptomatology improvement (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale [BPRS]-total), Olz-M, 
      Olz-H, and Hal were significantly superior to placebo. In positive symptom
      improvement (BPRS-positive), Olz-M, Olz-H, and Hal were comparable and
      significantly superior to placebo. In negative symptom improvement (Scale for the
      Assessment of Negative Symptoms [SANS]-composite), Olz-L and Olz-H were
      significantly superior to placebo and Olz-H was also significantly superior to
      Hal. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events included somnolence,
      agitation, asthenia, and nervousness. No acute dystonia was observed with
      olanzapine. Treatment-emergent parkinsonism occurred with Olz-H at approximately 
      one-third the rate of Hal, and akathisia occurred with Olz-H at approximately
      one-half the rate of Hal. Prolactin elevations associated with olanzapine were
      not significantly greater than those observed with placebo and were also
      significantly less than those seen with haloperidol.

TI  - Effects of the clozapine national registry system on incidence of deaths related 
      to agranulocytosis.
PG  - 52-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Clozapine is the only medication distributed in the U.S. through a
      national patient registry system that provides the medication only if results of 
      patients' weekly blood tests show no evidence of significant white blood cell
      suppression, an effect that can be fatal if it progresses to advanced
      agranulocytosis. This study assessed morbidity and mortality related to
      agranulocytosis during the first five years of the national registry system.
      METHODS: Data from the national registry database maintained by the U.S.
      manufacturer of clozapine was used to determine the level of treating systems'
      adherence to the mandated program of weekly white blood cell counts, number of
      instances in which clozapine treatment was denied because of prior determination 
      of white blood cell suppression, and number of cases of agranulocytosis and
      deaths related to agranulocytosis among treated patients from February 1990, when
      clozapine was commercially introduced in the U.S., through December 1994. The
      actual numbers of cases of agranulocytosis and related deaths were compared with 
      expected outcomes based on clinical research done before the drug became
      available commercially. RESULTS: Approximately 97 percent of treating systems had
      a high overall level of adherence to the registry protocol. In 28 instances, the 
      pretreatment authorization requirement resulted in denial of clozapine; after
      additional data were considered, 15 of the patients were cleared for treatment.
      The actual incidences of 382 cases of agranulocytosis and 12 related deaths were 
      lower than the expected 995 cases and 149 deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The clozapine
      national registry system fostered early detection of white blood cell
      suppression, prevented retreatment with clozapine of patients who had previously 
      developed white blood cell suppression, and brought about lower than expected
      rates of agranulocytosis and associated deaths.

TI  - Weight gain induced by clozapine.
PG  - 437-40
AB  - Patients were investigated to gain more insight into the incidence and time
      course of clozapine induced weight gain (n = 81) and to compare weight gain in
      patients treated with clozapine (n = 31) with that of patients treated with
      standard antipsychotics (haloperidol, n = 11). 35.7% of the patients treated with
      clozapine gained weight according to our definition. If patients gained weight on
      clozapine this side effect was apparent within the first 12 weeks of treatment.
      Deviation from normal body weight at the beginning of treatment showed a
      significant influence on weight gain. Sex, severity of illness, comedication,
      mean clozapine dose and degree of improvement did not show an influence on this
      side effect. Weight increase was significantly higher in patients treated with
      clozapine than in patients treated with haloperidol.

TI  - Risperidone in the treatment of patients with chronic schizophrenia: a
      multi-national, multi-centre, double-blind, parallel-group study versus
      haloperidol. Risperidone Study Group.
PG  - 712-26; discussion 727-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was performed in order to evaluate the short-term efficacy
      and safety of fixed risperidone doses compared to haloperidol. METHOD: In a
      multi-national, parallel-group, double-blind study, patients with chronic
      schizophrenia (DSM-III-R) were randomly assigned to risperidone 1, 4, 8, 12 or 16
      mg or haloperidol 10 mg daily for 8 weeks. Efficacy was assessed by the Positive 
      and Negative Syndrome Scale for schizophrenia (PANSS) and clinical global
      impression (CGI), and safety primarily by the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale
      (ESRS). RESULTS: One thousand three hundred and sixty-two patients were
      evaluated. The optimum risperidone doses were 4 mg and 8 mg, with response rates 
      of 63.4% (56.8%; 69.7%) and 65.8% (59.2%; 71.9%) respectively. Response rate in
      haloperidol-treated patients was 58.7% (52.0%; 65.3%); the 95% confidence
      intervals (CI) of the differences between risperidone 4 mg or 8 mg and
      haloperidol were (- 4.3%; 13.7%) and (- 1.9%; 16.0%) respectively. There were no 
      significant differences in CGI scores at endpoint between risperidone 4 mg, 8 mg,
      12 mg and 16 mg and haloperidol (3.0, 3.0, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.1 respectively); the
      95% CI of the differences between risperidone 4 mg or 8 mg and haloperidol were (
      - 0.4; 0.1) and ( - 0.3; 0.2) respectively. Mean shifts to the maximum total ESRS
      scores versus baseline (mean (confidence interval)) were significantly greater in
      haloperidol-treated patients (5.1 (4.0; 6.2)) than in the risperidone 1, 4, 8 and
      12 mg groups (1.1 (0.3; 1.9); 1.8 (0.9; 2.7); 2.7 (1.8; 3.6) and 3.2 (2.3; 4.1)
      respectively (P < 0.05)). CONCLUSION: Risperidone is an effective antipsychotic
      for the treatment of chronic schizophrenia; doses of 4 and 8 mg seem to be
      optimal and have a lower incidence of side-effects than haloperidol.

TI  - Risperidone versus zuclopenthixol in the treatment of acute schizophrenic
      episodes: a double-blind parallel-group trial.
PG  - 271-7
AB  - A double-blind, randomized, multi-center, parallel-group study was conducted in
      Finland to compare the efficacy and safety of risperidone with zuclopenthixol in 
      patients with acute exacerbations of schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder. 
      Ninety-eight patients were randomly assigned to treatment with risperidone (n =
      48) or zuclopenthixol (n = 50), in variable doses, for 6 weeks. The mean daily
      doses of risperidone and zuclopenthixol at the end of the trial were 8 mg and 38 
      mg respectively. Efficacy was assessed throughout by the Positive and Negative
      Syndrome Scale for schizophrenia and Clinical Global Impression. Safety
      assessments included the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale, UKU Side-Effect
      Rating Scale, vital signs, body weight and laboratory screening. The results
      indicate that risperidone is at least as effective as zuclopenthixol for the
      treatment of acute schizophrenic episodes, with a trend towards greater
      improvement in the overall severity of symptoms. The onset of action was
      significantly shorter with risperidone than with zuclopenthixol. Although the
      general tolerability of the two drugs was comparable, fewer patients experienced 
      extrapyramidal symptoms with risperidone, so that significantly fewer
      risperidone-treated patients required antiparkinsonian medication.

TI  - Extrapyramidal side effects of clozapine and haloperidol.
PG  - 52-6
AB  - Neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) were evaluated in 92
      patients treated with clozapine for the first time and 59 patients treated with
      haloperidol followed in a drug monitoring program. Side effects were measured by 
      the Columbia University Rating Scale, the Simpson Dyskinesia Scale and the
      Hillside Akathisia Scale. The cumulative incidence rate for tremor was found to
      be 24.4% in the clozapine group and 39.3% in the haloperidol group. This did not 
      amount to a statistically significant group difference. Bradykinesia was observed
      in 21.8% of the patients treated with clozapine and in 47.7% of the patients of
      haloperidol (P = 0.011). In the clozapine group the akathisia incidence rate was 
      5.6%, whereas haloperidol patients showed a higher rate of 31.7% (P = 0.005). Our
      results show higher incidence rates of tremor and bradykinesia during clozapine
      treatment than previous studies. We conclude that clozapine is not entirely free 
      of EPS, but they are usually less severe and of a different quality than side
      effects induced by typical antipsychotics.

TI  - Reduction of suicidality during clozapine treatment of neuroleptic-resistant
      schizophrenia: impact on risk-benefit assessment.
PG  - 183-90
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Suicide has been reported to occur in 9%-13% of schizophrenic
      patients. It has been suggested that neuroleptic-resistant or
      neuroleptic-intolerant schizophrenic patients are at higher risk for suicide than
      neuroleptic-responsive patients. Clozapine is the treatment of choice for
      neuroleptic-resistant patients, but its use has been greatly limited because of
      its ability to cause potentially fatal agranulocytosis. The purpose of this study
      was to compare the suicidality of neuroleptic-resistant and
      neuroleptic-responsive patients and to determine if clozapine treatment decreased
      suicidality in the former group. METHOD: Prior episodes of suicidality were
      assessed in a total of 237 neuroleptic-responsive and 184 neuroleptic-resistant
      patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Eighty-eight of the
      neuroleptic-resistant patients were treated with clozapine and prospectively
      evaluated for suicidality for periods of 6 months to 7 years. RESULTS: There was 
      no significant difference in prior suicidal episodes between
      neuroleptic-responsive and neuroleptic-resistant patients. Clozapine treatment of
      the neuroleptic-resistant patients during the follow-up period resulted in
      markedly less suicidality. The number of suicide attempts with a high-probability
      of success decreased from five to zero. This decrease in suicidality was
      associated with improvement in depression and hopelessness. CONCLUSIONS: These
      results suggest a basis for reevaluation of the risk-benefit assessment of
      clozapine, i.e., that the overall morbidity and mortality of patients with
      neuroleptic-resistant schizophrenia are less with clozapine treatment than with
      typical neuroleptic drugs because of less suicidality. This conclusion also has
      implications for increasing the use of clozapine with neuroleptic-responsive
      patients.

TI  - Clozapine-related seizures: experience with 5,629 patients.
PG  - 2247-9
AB  - We reviewed the incidence, clinical features, and management of all
      clozapine-related seizures in 5,629 patients monitored by the Clozaril Patient
      Management System, during the first 6 months after marketing. Seventy-one
      patients had generalized tonic-clonic seizures yielding a frequency of 1.3%. One 
      patient had myoclonic seizures prior to generalization. Seizures tended to occur 
      at low doses (< 300 mg/d) during the titration phase, and at high doses (> or =
      600 mg/d) during the maintenance phase. Patients with a history of seizures or
      epilepsy were more likely to have seizures soon after initiation of therapy, on
      low doses. Twenty-nine of 37 patients (78%) who had seizures and were
      rechallenged with clozapine were able to continue the medication with dose
      reduction and more-gradual dose titration, or with the addition of an
      antiepileptic medication.

TI  - The comparative efficacy and long-term effect of clozapine treatment on
      neuropsychological test performance.
PG  - 717-25
AB  - Previous studies have suggested that clozapine may improve neuropsychological
      test performance. The current study was designed to examine the comparative
      efficacy and the long-term effect of clozapine (versus haloperidol), on
      neuropsychological test performance. Neuropsychological measures of
      executive/attention, visuospatial, and memory function were administered to
      schizophrenic patients at baseline, at the end of a 10-week double-blind study,
      and after 1 year of open clozapine treatment. Symptoms and function ratings were 
      obtained at the same time points. The 10-week double-blind study revealed
      significant group-by-time interactions for two measures: Categorical Fluency and 
      WAIS-R Block Design. At the end of 1 year of open treatment there were
      significant improvements in Verbal Fluency, Mooney Faces Closure, and WAIS-R
      Block Design performance, and trend improvements in Stroop Color-Word
      Interference, Category Fluency, and WMS-R Logical Memory performance.
      Improvements in neuropsychological performance were unrelated to symptom changes.
      Change in selected neuropsychological measures were significantly correlated with
      improvement in quality of life. The results suggest that long-term clozapine
      treatment may have beneficial effects on a broad range of cognitive functions.

TI  - Clozapine and weight gain.
PG  - 157-60
AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the association of clozapine treatment and weight
      gain, we studied short- and long-term weight gain, correlation of weight gain
      with treatment response, and risk factors for weight gain in 82 patients with
      chronic schizophrenia who received clozapine treatment for up to 90 months.
      METHOD: Weight values were obtained through retrospective chart review. Clozapine
      was titrated over an average of 3 to 5 weeks up to a dose of 500 to 600 mg/day.
      Psychopathology was assessed with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and the
      Clinical Global Impressions scale. RESULTS: A clinically significant weight gain 
      occurred mostly during the first 6 to 12 months, but continued well into the
      third year of treatment. Weight gain and treatment response were not correlated, 
      and early weight gain was not a predictor of response. The cumulative incidence
      of patients becoming substantially overweight exceeded 50%. Being underweight at 
      baseline correlated with maximum amount gained (p = .000), and being overweight
      at baseline correlated with percentage above ideal weight (p = .006). CONCLUSION:
      Treatment with clozapine is associated with a high incidence of substantial
      weight gain, posing a potential long-term health risk. Studies are needed of the

TI  - Changes in single symptoms and separate factors of the schizophrenic syndrome
      after treatment with risperidone or haloperidol.
PG  - 108-13
AB  - Risperidone, a rather selective blocker of D-2 and 5-HT-2 receptors, was, in the 
      doses 1 mg, 4 mg, 8 mg, 12 mg and 16 mg a day, compared to the rather selective
      D-2 blocker haloperidol in the dose of 10 mg a day, in 88 chronic schizophrenic
      patients. After one week placebo wash-out, the patients were randomly assigned to
      one of the six treatment groups and the study was performed as a double blind
      parallel-group study for 8 weeks. In the present analysis, a special emphasis has
      been laid on the effects on single symptoms and separate factors in the
      schizophrenic syndrome. Overall, risperidone in a dose of 4 mg a day was
      comparable to haloperidol in a dose of 10 mg a day. Risperidone was found to have
      a curvilinear dose-response curve with an optimum effect of 4 mg day on the
      negative, anxious/depressive and cognitive factors and with an optimum effect of 
      8 mg day on the positive and excited factors. While haloperidol had significant
      effects on the negative and anxious/depressive factors, risperidone had
      significant effects on all five factors - the positive, the negative, the
      excited, the anxious/depressive and the cognitive. The fact that the novel drug
      had significant effects on the cognitive factor might be of great importance as
      concerns the possibilities for rehabilitation of chronic schizophrenic patients.

TI  - Risperidone versus perphenazine in the treatment of chronic schizophrenic
      patients with acute exacerbations.
PG  - 395-402
AB  - Risperidone (RIS), a new neuroleptic with 5-HT2- and dopamine D2
      receptor-blocking properties, was compared with perphenazine (PER) in a
      double-blind, multicentre, parallel-group study in 107 chronic schizophrenics
      with acute exacerbation. RIS 5-15 mg or PER 16-48 mg daily was given for 8 weeks.
      Psychopathology was assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale
      (PANSS) and Clinical Global Impression. Seventy-eight patients completed the
      trial; there was an equal number of dropouts on both drugs. The mean daily dose
      at endpoint was 8.5 mg RIS and 28 mg PER. The reduction in total PANSS score to
      endpoint did not differ significantly, although there was a tendency in favour of
      RIS. The number of patients with predominantly negative symptoms who showed at
      least 20% reduction in total PANSS score was significantly larger in the RIS
      group. Furthermore, the number of patients showing at least 20% reduction in
      Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) score (BPRS being a subscale of PANSS) was 
      significantly larger in the RIS group. The hostility cluster of BPRS improved
      more on RIS than on PER in the endpoint analysis. The overall prevalence of side 
      effects was fairly similar in the two groups.
