TI  - Effectiveness and cost of olanzapine and haloperidol in the treatment of
      schizophrenia: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 2693-702
AB  - CONTEXT: Although olanzapine has been widely adopted as a treatment of choice for
      schizophrenia, its long-term effectiveness and costs have not been evaluated in a
      controlled trial in comparison with a standard antipsychotic drug. OBJECTIVE: To 
      evaluate the effectiveness and cost impact of olanzapine compared with
      haloperidol in the treatment of schizophrenia. DESIGN AND SETTING: Double-blind, 
      randomized controlled trial with randomization conducted between June 1998 and
      June 2000 at 17 US Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers. PARTICIPANTS: 
      Three hundred nine patients with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
      Disorders, Fourth Edition diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder,
      serious symptoms, and serious dysfunction for the previous 2 years. Fifty-nine
      percent fully completed and 36% partially completed follow-up assessments.
      INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive flexibly dosed
      olanzapine, 5 to 20 mg/d, with prophylactic benztropine, 1 to 4 mg/d (n = 159);
      or haloperidol, 5 to 20 mg/d (n = 150), for 12 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
      Standardized measures of symptoms, quality of life, neurocognitive status, and
      adverse effects of medication. Veterans Affairs administrative data and
      interviews concerning non-VA service use were used to estimate costs from the
      perspective of the VA health care system and society as a whole (ie, consumption 
      of all resources on behalf of these patients). RESULTS: There were no significant
      differences between groups in study retention; positive, negative, or total
      symptoms of schizophrenia; quality of life; or extrapyramidal symptoms.
      Olanzapine was associated with reduced akathisia in the intention-to-treat
      analysis (P<.001) and with lower symptoms of tardive dyskinesia in a secondary
      analysis including only observations during blinded treatment with study drug.
      Small but significant advantages were also observed on measures of memory and
      motor function. Olanzapine was also associated with more frequent reports of
      weight gain and significantly greater VA costs, ranging from 3000 dollars to 9000
      dollars annually. Differences in societal costs were somewhat smaller and were
      not significant. CONCLUSION: Olanzapine does not demonstrate advantages compared 
      with haloperidol (in combination with prophylactic benztropine) in compliance,
      symptoms, extrapyramidal symptoms, or overall quality of life, and its benefits
      in reducing akathisia and improving cognition must be balanced with the problems 
      of weight gain and higher cost.

TI  - Effects of modafinil on sustained attention performance and quality of life in
      OSA patients with residual sleepiness while being treated with nCPAP.
PG  - 393-402
AB  - BACKGROUND: Some patients with obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSA/HS)
      who are regular users of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP)
      therapy continue to experience daytime sleepiness that impairs performance and
      quality of life. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group
      study was conducted to determine the effect of modafinil on sustained attention
      performance and functional quality of life in OSA/HS patients with residual
      daytime sleepiness, who were regular users of nCPAP therapy. METHODS:
      Seventy-seven patients received modafinil (200 mg/day, week 1; 400 mg/day, weeks 
      2-4) and 80 patients received matching placebo once daily for 4 weeks. Sustained 
      attention performance on the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) and functional
      status and quality of life using the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire
      (FOSQ) were measured. RESULTS: The frequency of lapses of attention during PVT
      performance was significantly decreased, and both the median and slowest reaction
      times were significantly improved in patients receiving nCPAP plus modafinil
      compared with those receiving nCPAP plus placebo (P=0.010 for the number of
      lapses [transformed], P=0.023 for the median reaction time, and P=0.014 for the
      reciprocal of the 10% slowest reaction times). Treatment with nCPAP plus
      modafinil significantly improved the FOSQ total score (weeks 1 and 4), the
      vigilance subscale score (weeks 1 and 4), and the activity level subscale score
      (week 4) compared with treatment with nCPAP plus placebo (all P<0.05).
      CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with previous results for objective and subjective
      measures of sleepiness, modafinil used adjunctively improved performance on a
      test of behavioral alertness and reduced functional impairments in patients with 
      OSA/HS who were regular users of nCPAP therapy but still experiencing sleepiness.

TI  - Effectiveness of bupropion sustained release for smoking cessation in a health
      care setting: a randomized trial.
PG  - 2337-44
AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of bupropion hydrochloride sustained release (SR)
      (Zyban) for smoking cessation has been evaluated in clinical trials that included
      frequent in-person behavioral counseling, but not in actual practice settings.
      OBJECTIVE: To determine the differential effectiveness of 2 doses of bupropion SR
      in combination with behavioral interventions of minimal to moderate intensity in 
      an actual practice setting. DESIGN: Open-label randomized trial, with 1 year of
      follow-up. SETTING: A large health system (Group Health Cooperative) based in
      Seattle. PARTICIPANTS: Adult smokers (N = 1524) interested in quitting smoking.
      INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 4 combinations
      of bupropion SR (150 or 300 mg) and behavioral counseling (minimal or moderate
      intensity). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was self-reported 
      point-prevalence 7-day nonsmoking status at 3 and 12 months following the target 
      quit date. Secondary outcomes included adverse and abstinence effects reported
      since beginning treatment with bupropion SR. RESULTS: At 3 months, a
      significantly higher rate of nonsmoking was observed among those receiving the
      larger bupropion SR dose (P=.005). At 12 months, moderate intensity counseling
      was associated significantly with a higher rate of nonsmoking (P=.001). At 3
      months, the higher dose was associated with a significantly increased frequency
      of self-reported symptoms such as difficulty sleeping (P=.02), difficulty
      concentrating (P=.02), shakiness/tremor (P=.002), and gastrointestinal problems
      (P=.005)and a decreased frequency of reported desire to smoke (P=.001).
      CONCLUSIONS: In this actual practice setting, the combination of bupropion SR and
      minimal or moderate counseling was associated with 1-year quit rates of 23.6% to 
      33.2%. This suggests that existing health care systems can substantially decrease
      tobacco use rates among their enrollees if they provide these modest
      interventions.

TI  - [Clozapine and pregnancy].
PG  - 119-24
AB  - This article reviews the relations between clozapine and pregnancy. Six case
      reports are identified in the literature of pregnant patients who received
      clozapine. Novartis at Basle, Switzerland, through its pharmacovigilance and
      epidemiology, service, has data on nearly 200 cases summarized in this article.
      We also describe the case of a patient with paranoid schizophrenia who was
      hospitalized 10 times between the age of 22 to 32. She received clozapine when
      she was 29 years old and, with a daily dosage of 350 mg, she became asymptomatic.
      At the age of 33 and 37, she became pregnant and continued clozapine during her 2
      pregnancies. During her first pregnancy, she received insulin due to gestational 
      diabetes associated with a body weight mass (BWM) of 30.4 (N = 20 to 25). During 
      her second pregnancy, the BWM was 23.7 and she did not develop diabetes. She
      delivered at term 2 daughters who are at the time of this report 5 and 3 years
      old. The two girls are doing well and have no developmental delay. Psychotic
      symptoms exacerbation: the plasma concentration of clozapine diminishes during
      pregnancy due to a higher hepatic metabolism and distribution volume. Monitoring 
      plasma concentration of clozapine can help to adjust its dosage. In case of
      psychotic symptoms exacerbation, the following can be recommended: 1) Increase
      the clozapine dosage; 2) Add a classic antipsychotic like perphenazine,
      trifluoperazine or haloperidol. Diabetes: obesity, glucose intolerance or a
      family history of diabetes are risk factors to develop gestational diabetes. The 
      follow-up of patients, who take an atypical antipsychotic, should include
      constant monitoring of the blood glucose or Hb1A and lipid dosages. Complications
      at labor: Clozapine increases the secretion of oxytocine and the contraction of
      the uterine muscle. But, no studies can explain how clozapine affects the labor
      exactly. Some case studies report use of forceps, vacuum or cesarean.
      CONVULSIONS: Stoner (1997) described neonatal convulsions 8 days after birth. The
      mother was receiving 350 mg of clozapine, but also lorazepam and haloperidol
      during her pregnancy. The newborn withdrawal of lorazepam can increase the risk
      of convulsions and also haloperidol can diminish the convulsion threshold. Floppy
      infant syndrome: in the case described by Dimichele (1996), the mother received a
      daily dosage of 300 mg of clozapine and 2.5 mg of lorazepam 3 to 5 times a day.
      This can explain hypotonia. Stoner (1997) reports a second case where a mother,
      who received 600 mg of clozapine during pregnancy, gave birth to a child who had 
      no convulsions neither hypotonia. DEVELOPMENT: The cases described concerning
      studies of children until age 2 to 3 years by Stoner (1997) and Dickson (1998)
      and until 6 years old by Barnas (1994), do not mention any developmental problem,
      similar to the two daughters of our patient. The pharmacovigilance service of
      Novarits reports 6% of malformations. But these reports must be considered with
      caution since they represent only the pregnancies reported spontaneously to the
      pharmaceutical company. This is only a portion of all pregnancies associated with
      clozapine. CONCLUSION: No specific risks for the mother and children can be
      attributed to the use of clozapine during pregnancy. However, the plasma
      concentration of clozapine is higher in the fetus compared to the mother (Barnas,
      1994); therefore, a minimal dosage should be used. Since clozapine is present in 
      the maternal milk, breast feeding should be avoided. The advantages to use
      clozapine during pregnancy must exceed the risks. It is justified to continue the
      use of this medication even if data on classic antipsychotics (e.g.: haloperidol)
      are more extensive. Because the risk of psychotic exacerbation is higher, the
      substitution of clozapine is not recommended. The psychosocial support and the
      obstetrical follow-up must be intensive too. An institutional pharmacovigilance
      service should complement the one provided by the industry. Also, further
      case-control and cohort studies are essential to better estimate the long-term
      risks.

TI  - The effects of an educational intervention on antipsychotic-induced weight gain.
PG  - 237-41
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the effect of an educational intervention on
      antipsychotic-induced weight gain among patients with schizophrenia. DESIGN AND
      METHODS: Quasi-experimental. Seventy patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder entered this 6-month study condicted in
      the United States. All participants began receiving olanzapine treatment when
      they entered the study. The patients were then randomly assigned to an
      intervention group or a standard care group. Over the next 4-months, the
      intervention group participated in weekly psychoeducation classes focused on
      nutrition, exercise, and living a healthy lifestyle. Patients were followed for
      an additional 2 months to assess weight change. FINDINGS: A statistically
      significant difference in weight change between the two groups was observed
      post-treatment and at endpoint. At endpoint, the mean weight change of the
      intervention group was -.06 pounds, while the mean weight change in the standard 
      care group was 9.57 pounds. In both groups, men gained significantly more weight 
      than did women. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that a structured educational
      intervention might have a positive effect on antipsychotic-induced weight gain
      among patients with schizophrenia.

      systems more selectively, L-dopa (dopamine (DA) agonist) and desipramine (DMI)
      (noradrenaline (NA) re-uptake inhibitor). Sixteen children with ADHD performed a 
      stop-task, a laboratory task that measures the ability to inhibit an ongoing
      action, in a double-blind randomized within-subjects design. Each child received 
      an acute clinical dose of MPH, DMI, L-dopa, and placebo; measures of performance 
      and plasma were determined. The results indicated that inhibition performance was
      improved under DMI but not under MPH or L-dopa. The response-time to the
      stop-signal was marginally shortened after intake of DMI. MPH decreased omission 
      and choice-errors and caused faster reaction times to the trials without the
      stop-tone. No effects of L-dopa whatsoever were noted. Prolactin levels were
      increased and 5-HIAA levels were lowered under DMI relative to placebo. It is
      suggested that the effects of MPH on attention are due to a combination of
      noradrenergic and dopaminergic mechanisms. The improved inhibition under DMI
      could be serotonergically mediated.

TI  - A placebo-controlled, double-blind study of the efficacy and safety of
      aripiprazole in patients with acute bipolar mania.
PG  - 1651-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors compared the efficacy and safety of aripiprazole, a novel 
      antipsychotic, to placebo for treatment of patients in an acute manic or mixed
      episode of bipolar disorder. METHOD: This 3-week, multicenter, double-blind study
      randomly assigned 262 bipolar disorder patients in an acute manic or mixed
      episode to aripiprazole, 30 mg/day (reduced to 15 mg/day if needed for
      tolerability), or placebo. Patients remained hospitalized for at least 2 of the
      weeks. The primary efficacy measure was mean change from baseline in total score 
      on the Young Mania Rating Scale; response was defined as a decrease in score of >
      or =50%. RESULTS: Aripiprazole produced statistically significant mean
      improvements in total score on the Young Mania Rating Scale compared with placebo
      (-8.2 versus -3.4, respectively) and produced a significantly higher response
      rate (40% versus 19%). For key efficacy variables (response per Young Mania
      Rating Scale; Clinical Global Impression-Bipolar Version scores for severity of
      illness [mania] and change from preceding phase [mania]), aripiprazole separated 
      from placebo by day 4. The completion rate was significantly higher with
      aripiprazole than with placebo (42% versus 21%). Discontinuations due to adverse 
      events did not differ significantly between the aripiprazole and placebo groups. 
      There were no significant changes in body weight versus placebo, and aripiprazole
      was not associated with elevated serum prolactin or QTc prolongation.
      CONCLUSIONS: Aripiprazole had significantly greater efficacy than placebo for the
      treatment of bipolar disorder patients in acute manic or mixed episodes and was
      safe and well tolerated in this randomized controlled trial.

TI  - The safety and early efficacy of oral-loaded divalproex versus standard-titration
      divalproex, lithium, olanzapine, and placebo in the treatment of acute mania
      associated with bipolar disorder.
PG  - 841-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have examined the safety and tolerability of
      oral-loaded divalproex sodium in the treatment of acute mania, but not the early 
      efficacy of this dosing strategy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the
      early efficacy of oral-loaded divalproex. METHOD: In this pooled analysis, 348
      subjects from 3 randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, active- or
      placebo-controlled studies were used to compare the efficacy, safety, and
      tolerability of oral-loaded divalproex with standard-titration divalproex,
      lithium, olanzapine, or placebo. Subjects were inpatients diagnosed with acute
      mania associated with bipolar I disorder (DSM-III-R or -IV and SADS-Change
      Version). Patients were administered oral-loaded divalproex (20 or 30 mg/kg/day
      on days 1 and 2 followed by 20 mg/kg/day, and increased at physician's
      discretion), standard-titration divalproex initiated at 250 mg t.i.d. and
      titrated to 40-150 microg/mL, lithium (300 mg t.i.d. initial dose) titrated to
      0.4 to 1.5 mEq/L, olanzapine (10 mg q.d. initial dose) up to 20 mg/day, or
      placebo. RESULTS: The results demonstrate an early efficacy advantage for
      oral-loaded divalproex compared to standard-titration divalproex at days 5, 7/8, 
      and 10. Efficacy was improved over lithium on day 7/8. There were no efficacy
      differences between divalproex loading and olanzapine. Divalproex loading showed 
      greater efficacy than placebo at all time points. Divalproex loading was as well 
      tolerated or better tolerated than the other active treatments as measured by
      adverse events and changes in laboratory parameters. CONCLUSION: These results
      suggest the oral loading of divalproex leads to a more rapid antimanic effect
      when compared with standard-titration divalproex, lithium, or placebo and is
      better tolerated than olanzapine and as well tolerated as lithium or
      standard-titration divalproex.

TI  - Pharmacologic myocardial protection in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery: a 
      quantitative systematic review.
PG  - 623-33
AB  - A number of drugs have been tested in clinical trials to decrease cardiac
      complications in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. To compare the results
      of these studies, we conducted a quantitative systematic review. Medline, Embase,
      and Cochrane databases were searched for randomized trials that assessed
      myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, 30-day cardiac mortality, and adverse
      effects. Data were combined using a fixed-effect model and expressed as Peto odds
      ratios (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) and as numbers-needed-to-treat/harm
      (NNT/H). Twenty-one trials involving 3646 patients were included: 11 trials using
      beta-blockers (6 drugs; 866 patients), 6 clonidine or mivazerol (614 patients), 3
      diltiazem or verapamil (121 patients), and 1 nitroglycerin (45 patients). All
      trials had an inactive control; there were no direct comparisons. beta-blockers
      decreased ischemic episodes during surgery (7.6% versus 20.2% with placebo; OR
      0.32 [95% CI, 0.17-0.58]; NNT 8) and after surgery (15.2% versus 27.9% with
      control; OR 0.46 [95% CI, 0.26-0.81]; NNT 8). alpha(2)-agonists decreased
      ischemia during surgery only (19.4% versus 32.8%; OR 0.47 [95% CI, 0.33-0.68];
      NNT 7). beta-blockers reduced the risk of myocardial infarction (0.9% versus
      5.2%; OR 0.19 [95% CI, 0.08-0.48]; NNT 23) but only when 2 trials with high-risk 
      patients were included. The effect of alpha(2)-agonists on myocardial infarction 
      was not significant (6.1% versus 7.3%; OR 0.85 [95% CI, 0.62-1.14]).
      beta-blockers significantly decreased the risk of cardiac death from 3.9% to 0.8%
      (OR 0.25 [95% CI, 0.09-0.73], NNT 32). alpha(2)-agonists significantly decreased 
      the risk of cardiac death from 2.3% to 1.1% (OR 0.50 [95% CI, 0.28-0.91], NNT
      83). For calcium channel blockers and nitroglycerin, evidence of any benefit was 
      lacking. The most common adverse effect was bradycardia, which occurred in 24.5% 
      of patients receiving a beta adrenergic blocker versus 9.1% of controls (OR 3.76 
      [95% CI, 2.45-5.77], NNH 6).

TI  - An integrated analysis of acute treatment-emergent extrapyramidal syndrome in
      patients with schizophrenia during olanzapine clinical trials: comparisons with
      placebo, haloperidol, risperidone, or clozapine.
PG  - 898-906
AB  - BACKGROUND: The frequency and severity of extrapyramidal syndrome (EPS) were
      evaluated in patients with DSM-III or DSM-IV schizophrenia in the acute phase (- 
      8 weeks) of randomized, double-blind, controlled trials from the integrated
      olanzapine clinical trial database. METHOD: This retrospective analysis included 
      23 clinical trials and 4611 patients from November 11, 1991, through July 31,
      2001. Incidences of dystonic, parkinsonian, and akathisia events were compared
      using treatment-emergent adverse-event data. Categorical analyses of
      Simpson-Angus Scale and Barnes Akathisia Scale (BAS) scores, use of
      anticholinergic medications, and baseline-to-endpoint changes in Simpson-Angus
      Scale and BAS scores were compared. RESULTS: A significantly smaller percentage
      of olanzapine-treated patients experienced dystonic events than did haloperidol- 
      (p <.001) or risperidone-treated patients (p =.047). A significantly greater
      percentage of haloperidol-treated patients experienced parkinsonian (p <.001) and
      akathisia (p <.001) events than did olanzapine-treated patients. Categorical
      analysis of Simpson-Angus Scale scores showed significantly more haloperidol- (p 
      <.001) or risperidone-treated patients (p =.004) developed parkinsonism than did 
      olanzapine-treated patients. Olanzapine-treated patients experienced
      significantly greater reductions in Simpson-Angus Scale scores than did
      haloperidol- (p <.001), risperidone- (p <.001), or clozapine-treated (p =.032)
      patients. Categorical analysis of BAS scores showed significantly more
      haloperidol-treated patients experienced treatment-emergent akathisia versus
      olanzapine-treated patients (p <.001). Significantly greater reductions in BAS
      scores were experienced during olanzapine treatment versus placebo (p =.007),
      haloperidol (p <.001), and risperidone (p =.004) treatments. A significantly
      smaller percentage of olanzapine-treated patients received anticholinergic
      medications compared with that of haloperidol- (p <.001) or risperidone-treated
      patients (p =.018). Compared with that in olanzapine-treated patients, the
      duration of anticholinergic cotreatment was significantly longer among
      haloperidol- (p <.001) or risperidone-treated patients (p =.040) and
      significantly shorter among clozapine-treated patients (p =.021). CONCLUSION:
      This analysis of available data from olanzapine clinical trials lends additional 
      support to olanzapine's favorable EPS profile.

TI  - Selegiline in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in
      children: a double blind and randomized trial.
PG  - 841-5
AB  - Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common disorder of childhood
      that affects 3% to 6% of school-age children. Conventional stimulant medications 
      are recognized by both specialists and parents as useful symptomatic treatment.
      Nevertheless, approximately 30% of ADHD children treated with them do not respond
      adequately or cannot tolerate the associated adverse effects. Such difficulties
      highlight the need for alternative safe and effective medications in the
      treatment of this disorder. Selegiline is a type B monoamine oxidase inhibitor
      (MAOI) that is metabolized to amphetamine and methamphetamine stimulant compounds
      that may be useful in the treatment of ADHD. The authors undertook this study to 
      further evaluate, under double-blind and controlled conditions, the efficacy of
      selegiline for ADHD in children. A total of 28 children with ADHD as defined by
      DSM IV were randomized to selegiline or methylphenidate dosed on an age and
      weight-adjusted basis at selegiline 5 mg/day (under 5 years) and 10 mg/day (over 
      5 years) (Group 1) and methylphenidate 1 mg/kg/day (Group 2) for a 4-week
      double-blind clinical trial. The principal measure of the outcome was the Teacher
      and Parent ADHD Rating Scale. Patients were assessed by a child psychiatrist at
      baseline, 14 and 28 days after the medication started. No significant differences
      were observed between the two protocols on the Parent and Teacher Rating Scale
      scores. Although the number of dropouts in the methylphenidate group was higher
      than in the selegiline group, there was no significant difference between the two
      protocols in terms of the dropouts. Decreased appetite, difficulty falling asleep
      and headaches were observed more in the methylphenidate group. The results of
      this study must be considered preliminary, but they do suggest that selegiline
      may be beneficial in the treatment of ADHD. In addition, a tolerable side effect 
      profile may be considered as one of the advantages of selegiline in the treatment
      of ADHD.

TI  - Olanzapine for psychotic and behavioral disturbances in Alzheimer disease.
PG  - 1321-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of olanzapine for the treatment of
      psychotic and behavioral disturbances in Alzheimer disease. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE
      (1966-January 2003) and Science Citation Index searches were performed. Key
      search terms included olanzapine, Alzheimer(s), and dementia. DATA SYNTHESIS:
      Four trials of olanzapine and subsequent post hoc analyses were reviewed. Three
      trials found a benefit associated with olanzapine use, but a fourth trial did
      not. CONCLUSIONS: Olanzapine appears to be effective in treating psychotic and
      behavioral disturbances associated with Alzheimer disease. However, the most
      appropriate dose remains to be determined. The benefit of olanzapine therapy must
      be weighed against the adverse effect profiles of olanzapine and alternative
      treatment options.

TI  - Actigraphic measurement of the effects of single-dose haloperidol and olanzapine 
      on spontaneous motor activity in normal subjects.
PG  - 293-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To quantitatively examine the effects of haloperidol and olanzapine on
      spontaneous motor activity in normal subjects. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled medication study. PARTICIPANTS: Normal volunteers (n = 30).
      INTERVENTIONS: Subjects received 1 dose of either haloperidol 2 mg (n = 9),
      olanzapine 10 mg (n = 10) or placebo (n = 10) and were admitted to hospital for
      the next 24 hours. OUTCOME MEASURES: Subjects wore an actigraphic monitor, which 
      recorded movement in 15-second epochs. The Simpson-Angus Extrapyramidal Side
      Effect Scale (SAS) and the Barnes Akathisia Scale (BAS) were administered before 
      and 7 and 24 hours after medication was given. RESULTS: Compared with placebo,
      total motor activity was decreased by 41% with olanzapine (p = 0.004) and by 12% 
      with haloperidol (NS). There were significantly more epochs with zero movement
      with olanzapine than with haloperidol or placebo. For non-zero epochs, the mean
      activity count and the distribution of activity counts did not differ
      significantly among groups. There were no positive findings on the SAS or the
      BAS. CONCLUSIONS: Olanzapine decreased total motor activity by increasing the
      amount of time during which subjects were immobile, rather than by affecting the 
      magnitude of movement during periods in which there was activity. This effect
      occurred at a dose of olanzapine low enough not to cause clinically observed
      extrapyramidal side effects. Our results suggest that actigraphy is useful as a
      sensitive, noninvasive tool for measuring the effect of antipsychotics on
      spontaneous motor activity.

TI  - Effectiveness of rapid initial dose escalation of up to forty milligrams per day 
      of oral olanzapine in acute agitation.
PG  - 342-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients experiencing an acute decompensation of schizophrenia or
      bipolar disorder often present in an agitated state. Agitation presents a barrier
      to therapy, interrupting the typical physician-patient alliance and creating a
      disruptive, even hazardous, environment. Rapid assessment and effective treatment
      are necessary to manage agitation and, potentially, to shorten the time to
      recovery. METHODS: One hundred forty-eight acutely agitated patients received
      either: rapid initial dose escalation (RIDE) in which up to 40 mg of oral
      olanzapine was allowed on days 1 and 2, up to 30 mg on days 3 and 4, and 5 to 20 
      mg thereafter; or usual clinical practice (UCP) in which patients received 10
      mg/d olanzapine plus up to 4 mg lorazepam on days 1 and 2, up to 2 mg on days 3
      and 4, and olanzapine 5 to 20 mg/d thereafter. The Positive and Negative Syndrome
      Scale-Excited Component (PANSS-EC: poor impulse control, tension, hostility,
      uncooperativeness, and excitement) measured at 24 hours was the primary measure. 
      Secondary assessments of agitation and safety were also performed. RESULTS:
      Agitation improved significantly from baseline for both treatment groups;
      however, improvement with the RIDE strategy was superior to UCP. The RIDE group
      improvement was superior on the primary efficacy measure (PANSS-Excited) at 24
      hours; it was superior on all agitation measures at the end of double-blind
      treatment. Both treatments were well tolerated, with no clinically significant
      differences in safety measures. Treatment was not limited by oversedation and
      attention improved from baseline in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study
      demonstrates the value of olanzapine in the treatment of acutely agitated
      patients. A new approach to olanzapine dosing that expands the initial dose range
      up to 40 mg/d may offer superior efficacy in rapidly and effectively controlling 
      the symptoms of agitation.

TI  - Serum antimuscarinic activity during clozapine treatment.
PG  - 336-41
AB  - This study attempts: (1) to verify that serum antimuscarinic activity is related 
      to clozapine dose, and more importantly to clozapine plasma concentrations; (2)
      to explore whether norclozapine has serum antimuscarinic activity; (3) to explore
      whether antimuscarinic activity is related to clozapine side effects; and (4) to 
      compare the serum antimuscarinic activities of clozapine with those of
      antiparkinsonian drugs and other antipsychotics. In 39 patients participating in 
      a double-blind clozapine study, the [3H]QNB assay was used to measure serum
      antimuscarinic activity: (1) on baseline medications; (2) after a 4-week
      haloperidol trial; (3) after a 16-week clozapine trial of either 100, 300, or 600
      mg/d; and (4) after 1 or 2 consecutive 16-week clozapine trials with remaining
      doses in nonresponders. Clozapine levels predicted serum antimuscarinic activity 
      better than clozapine dose. At the end of the 1st clozapine trial, the
      correlation with the levels explained 69% of the variance of serum antimuscarinic
      activity (r = 0.83, P < 0.001, N = 34). Clozapine levels were good predictors of 
      serum antimuscarinic activity only in patients taking 300 or 600 mg/d. After
      correcting for clozapine levels, the within-subject correlation between
      norclozapine levels and serum antimuscarinic activity was relatively high and
      significant (r = 0.54, F = 26.7, df = 1.65, P < 0.001). Constipation was
      significantly associated with higher serum antimuscarinic activity during the 1st
      clozapine trial. Clozapine was associated with clearly higher antimuscarinic
      activity than other antipsychotics or low doses of antiparkinsonians. In vitro
      studies and new clinical studies are needed to verify whether norclozapine may
      significantly contribute to antimuscarinic activity during clozapine treatment.

TI  - Randomized trial of olanzapine versus placebo in the symptomatic acute treatment 
      of the schizophrenic prodrome.
PG  - 453-64
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prodromal phase of schizophrenic disorders has been described
      prospectively. The present study aimed to determine the short-term efficacy and
      safety of olanzapine treatment of prodromal symptoms compared with placebo.
      METHODS: This was a double-blind, randomized, parallel-groups, placebo-controlled
      trial with fixed-flexible dosing conducted at four sites. Sixty patients met
      prodromal diagnostic criteria, including attenuated psychotic symptoms, as
      determined by structured interviews. Olanzapine 5-15 mg daily or placebo was
      prescribed for 8 weeks. RESULTS: In the mixed-effects, repeated-measures
      analysis, the treatment x time interaction for the change from baseline on the
      Scale of Prodromal Symptoms total score was statistically significant, and post
      hoc analyses revealed that the olanzapine-placebo difference reached p<.10 by
      week 6 and p<.05 at week 8. Ratings of extrapyramidal symptoms remained low in
      each group and were not significantly different. Olanzapine patients gained 9.9
      lb versus.7 lb for placebo patients (p<.001). CONCLUSIONS: This short-term
      analysis suggests olanzapine is associated with significantly greater symptomatic
      improvement but significantly greater weight gain than is placebo in prodromal
      patients. Extrapyramidal symptoms with olanzapine were minimal and similar to
      those with placebo. Future research over the longer term with more patients will 
      be needed before recommendations can be made regarding routine treatment.

TI  - Bupropion sustained release for treatment of tobacco dependence.
PG  - 1020-4; quiz 1024
AB  - Tobacco use is a global pandemic. The most common pharmacological treatments of
      tobacco use and dependence include nicotine replacement therapy and nonnicotine
      medications. Bupropion sustained release (SR) is the only first-line nonnicotine 
      medication recommended by the US Public Health Service Clinical Practice
      Guideline. Randomized controlled clinical trials have shown that bupropion SR
      doubles abstinence rates compared with placebo. Long-term treatment with
      bupropion SR may reduce or delay smoking relapse. Bupropion SR has an excellent
      adverse effect profile, although a risk exists for serious adverse effects such
      as seizures. The risk of serious adverse effects associated with bupropion SR can
      be reduced by careful selection of patients. This article reviews the evidence of
      efficacy and common adverse effects of bupropion SR and delineates the clinical
      characteristics of patients at higher risk for adverse effects when bupropion SR 
      is prescribed for treatment of tobacco use and dependence.

TI  - Comparative efficacy and safety of atypical and conventional antipsychotic drugs 
      in first-episode psychosis: a randomized, double-blind trial of olanzapine versus
      haloperidol.
PG  - 1396-404
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Few long-term studies have compared the efficacy and safety of typical
      and atypical antipsychotic medications directly in patients with a first episode 
      of psychosis who met the criteria for schizophrenia or a related psychotic
      disorder. This study compared the acute and long-term effectiveness of
      haloperidol with that of olanzapine in patients with first-episode psychosis in a
      large, controlled clinical trial. METHOD: Patients with first-episode psychosis
      (N=263) were randomly assigned under double-blind conditions to receive
      haloperidol or olanzapine and were followed for up to 104 weeks. Domains measured
      included psychopathology, psychosocial variables, neurocognitive functioning, and
      brain morphology and metabolism. This report presents data from clinical measures
      of treatment response and safety data from the 12-week acute treatment phase.
      RESULTS: Haloperidol and olanzapine were associated with substantial and
      comparable baseline-to-endpoint reductions in symptom severity, which did not
      differ significantly in last-observation-carried-forward analyses. However, in a 
      mixed-model analysis, olanzapine-treated subjects had significantly greater
      decreases in symptom severity as measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome
      Scale total score and negative and general scales and by the Montgomery-Asberg
      Depression Rating Scale but not as measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome
      Scale positive scale and by the Clinical Global Impression severity rating.
      Olanzapine-treated patients experienced a lower rate of treatment-emergent
      parkinsonism and akathisia but had significantly more weight gain, compared with 
      the haloperidol-treated patients. Overall, significantly more olanzapine-treated 
      subjects than haloperidol-treated subjects completed the 12-week acute phase of
      the study (67% versus 54%). CONCLUSIONS: As expected on the basis of previous
      studies, both olanzapine and haloperidol were effective in the acute reduction of
      psychopathological symptoms in this group of patients with first-episode
      psychosis. However, olanzapine had several relative advantages in therapeutic
      response. Although the nature of adverse events differed between the two agents, 
      retention in the study was greater with olanzapine. Retention in treatment is
      important in this patient population, given their risk of relapse. Longer-term
      results are needed to determine whether treatment with atypical antipsychotics
      results in superior outcomes for a first episode of schizophrenia.

TI  - Olanzapine reduces craving for alcohol: a DRD4 VNTR polymorphism by
      pharmacotherapy interaction.
PG  - 1882-8
AB  - Separate investigations have suggested that olanzapine, a D4 antagonist,
      decreases craving after a priming dose of alcohol and that the DRD4 variable
      number of tandem repeats (VNTR) polymorphism influences the expression of craving
      after a priming dose of alcohol. The present study tested the hypothesis that
      olanzapine may be differentially effective at reducing cue-elicited craving based
      on individual differences in DRD4 VNTR in a sample of heavy social drinkers.
      Participants were randomly assigned to receive olanzapine (5 mg) or a control
      medication (cyproheptadine, 4 mg) prior to consuming three alcoholic drinks.
      Participants completed subjective measures of craving and euphoria after each
      drink. Participants who were homozygous or heterozygous for the 7 (or longer)
      repeat allele of the DRD4 VNTR were classified as DRD4 L, while the other
      participants were classified as DRD4 S. The findings indicated that olanzapine
      reduces craving for alcohol at baseline for both DRD4 S and DRD4 L individuals,
      but only reduces craving after exposure to alcohol cues and after a priming dose 
      of alcohol for DRD4 L individuals.

TI  - Effects of tyrosine, phentermine, caffeine D-amphetamine, and placebo on
      cognitive and motor performance deficits during sleep deprivation.
PG  - 237-46
AB  - Cognitive and motor performance are critical in many circumstances and are
      impaired by sleep deprivation. We administered placebo, tyrosine 150 mg/kg,
      caffeine 300 mg/70 kg, phentermine 37.5 mg and D-amphetamine 20 mg at 15.30 h
      following overnight sleep deprivation and compare their effects on cognitive and 
      motor performance in healthy young men. Tests of visual scanning, running memory,
      logical reasoning, mathematical processing, the Stroop task, four-choice serial
      reaction time, time wall take, pursuit tracking, visual vigilance, Trails (B)
      task and long-term memory were evaluated at standardized intervals before, during
      and after sleep deprivation and drugs. Performance decrements with sleep
      deprivation occurred in visual scanning, running memory, logical reasoning,
      mathematical processing, the Stroop test, the time wall test, tracking and visual
      vigilance. Interestingly, with sleep deprivation some tests improved and others
      did not deteriorate. Improvements with medication following sleep deprivation
      were seen in running memory, logical reasoning, mathematical processing, tracking
      and visual vigilance. Although less effective than D-amphetamine, tyrosine
      improved performance on several tests. We conclude that all drugs tested improved
      at least some aspects of cognitive and motor performance after sleep deprivation.
      As a naturally occurring amino acid, and thus amenable to nutritional strategies,
      tyrosine may deserve further testing.

TI  - A comparison of tyrosine against placebo, phentermine, caffeine, and
      D-amphetamine during sleep deprivation.
PG  - 221-35
AB  - Sleep deprivation can impair alertness and cognitive and motor performance. We
      hypothesized that the amino acid tyrosine might reduce deleterious effects of
      sleep deprivation. Seventy-six healthy males, age 18-35 years, participated in a 
      four-day protocol that included a habituation night, a baseline night, a 40.5 h
      period without sleep, and a recovery night. Tyrosine 150 mg/kg, caffeine 300
      mg/70 kg, phentermine 37.5 mg, D-amphetamine 20 mg and placebo were administered 
      in a double-blind, randomized fashion to compare their effects on the time it
      took to fall asleep, on endocrine responses during sleep deprivation, and on
      sleep quantity, quality and architecture as measured by polysomnography during
      recovery sleep. When given after 36 h without sleep, tyrosine had no significant 
      effect on any parameter of sleep. D-amphetamine produced marked decrease in sleep
      drive but caused deleterious effects on many aspects of recovery sleep. Still,
      D-amphetamine was associated with increased alertness on the first recovery day. 
      Phentermine and caffeine both decreased sleep drive during sleep deprivation, but
      phentermine impaired rapid-eye-movement (REM) recovery sleep. Tyrosine (when
      compared to placebo) had no effect on any sleep related measure, but it did
      stimulate prolactin release.

TI  - [Comparative bioavailability study of two formulations of risperidone available
      in the Chilean market].
PG  - 527-34
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bioavailability of a particular drug can vary according to the
      formulation used. Therefore, studies of comparative bioavailability of different 
      formulations of a same drug are worthwhile. AIM: To compare the bioavailability
      of two risperidone formulations available in the Chilean market. MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: The bioavailability of a local risperidone formulation (Spiron) was
      compared with the original formulation of the drug (Risperdal) in 12 healthy
      volunteers, aged 19 +/- 1 years. A single dose of 3 mg was given orally, using a 
      randomized double blind protocol in two periods. Fifteen blood samples were
      obtained at regular intervals, until 24 h after drug administration. Risperidone 
      plasma levels were measured by high pressure liquid chromatography.
      pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using a computer program that is
      independent of compartmental analysis. RESULTS: The area under the curve of
      plasma concentration versus time, from 0 to infinite (ABC0-infinity) and from 0
      to 24 h (ABC0-24), early exposure (ABC from 0 to maximal time) and maximal plasma
      concentrations were significantly lower for Spiron. Half life time and time to
      achieve the maximal concentration were similar for the two formulations.
      CONCLUSIONS: According to bioequivalence tests suggested by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) of the United States (90% confidence interval for the
      difference of long transformed mean pharmacokinetic parameters), the formulations
      Risperdal and Spiron, cannot be considered interchangeable.

TI  - Pilot randomized double blind placebo-controlled study of dexamphetamine for
      cocaine dependence.
PG  - 1137-41
AB  - AIMS: To establish the feasibility of conducting a placebo-controlled clinical
      trial of dexamphetamine replacement therapy for cocaine dependence and to obtain 
      preliminary data. DESIGN: Double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial.
      PARTICIPANTS: Thirty cocaine-dependent injecting drug users. INTERVENTION:
      Subjects were assigned randomly to receive 60 mg/day dexamphetamine (n = 16) or
      placebo (n = 14) for 14 weeks. MEASUREMENTS: Immunoassay and mass spectrometric
      techniques were used to identify cocaine metabolites in urine. Subjects were
      screened using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview and DSM-IV. The
      Opiate Treatment Index, Brief Symptom Inventory, Severity of Dependence Scale and
      visual analogue craving scales were used to collect pre- and post-self-report
      data. FINDINGS: Treatment retention was equivalent between groups; however,
      outcomes favoured the treatment group with no improvements observed in the
      placebo control group. The proportion of cocaine-positive urine samples detected 
      in the treatment group declined from 94% to 56% compared to no change in the
      placebo group (79% positive). While the improvements were not significant between
      groups, within-group analysis revealed that the treatment group reduced
      self-reported cocaine use (P = 0.02), reduced criminal activity (P = 0.04),
      reduced cravings (P < 0.01) and reduced severity of cocaine dependence (P < 0.01)
      with no within-group improvements found in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: A
      definitive evaluation of the utility of dexamphetamine in the management of
      cocaine dependence is feasible and warranted.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This paper reviews the recent literature concerning Tourette
      syndrome and related disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Tourette syndrome is a common
      disorder in children and adolescents, with an established association with
      attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and a
      number of other psychiatric disorders. Both autoimmune and genetic mechanisms are
      implicated in the pathophysiology of the syndrome, while neuroimaging studies
      have identified abnormalities in the composition of the basal ganglia and frontal
      lobe white matter, as well as alterations in dopaminergic activity. When
      necessary, treatment of tics can be successful with neuroleptics and
      alpha-2-adrenergic agonists. The use of stimulants in children with Tourette
      syndrome and comorbid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder does not appear to
      worsen tics. SUMMARY: As a result of the recent literature, clinicians can feel
      comfortable treating children with co-morbid attention deficit hyperactivity
      disorder and Tourette syndrome with stimulant medications. It has also been
      established that transient tics are very common in children, and for the most
      part, non-disabling. In those children with persistent tics, behavioural
      disorders are associated which may impair success in school and psychosocial
      functioning. Clinicians have a number of therapeutic options, with recent
      double-blinded randomized trials of clonidine, risperidone, and desipramine
      showing benefit. Scientists continue to search for the cause of Tourette
      syndrome.

TI  - A comparison of the efficacy and safety of olanzapine versus haloperidol during
      transition from intramuscular to oral therapy.
PG  - 1420-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acutely agitated patients with schizophrenia who receive
      intramuscular (IM) medications typically are switched to oral (PO) antipsychotic 
      maintenance therapy. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to assess the efficacy
      and safety of olanzapine versus those of haloperidol during transition from IM to
      PO therapy. We used additional data from a previously reported trial to test the 
      hypothesis that the reduction in agitation achieved by IM olanzapine 10 mg or IM 
      haloperidol 7.5 mg would be maintained following transition to 4 days of PO
      olanzapine or PO haloperidol (5-20 mg/d for both). We also hypothesized that
      olanzapine would maintain its more favorable extrapyramidal symptom (EPS) safety 
      profile. METHODS: This was a multinational (hospitals in 13 countries),
      double-blind, randomized, controlled trial. Acutely agitated inpatients with
      schizophrenia were treated with 1 to 3 IM injections to olanzapine 10 mg or
      haloperidol 7.5 mg over 24 hours and were entered into a 4-day PO treatment
      period with the same medication (5-20 mg/d for both). The primary efficacy
      measurement was reduction in agitation, as measured by the Positive and Negative 
      Syndrome Scale-Excited Component (PANSS-EC) score. Adverse events and scores on
      EPS rating scales were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 311 patients (204 men, 107
      women; mean [SD] age, 38.2 [11.6] years) were enrolled (131, 126, and 54 patients
      in the olanzapine, haloperidol, and placebo groups, respectively). In all, 93.1% 
      (122/131) of olanzapine-treated patients and 92.1% (116/126) of
      haloperidol-treated patients completed the IM period and entered the PO period;
      85.5% (112/131) of olanzapine-treated patients and 84.1% (106/126) of
      haloperidol-treated patients completed the PO period. IM olanzapine and IM
      haloperidol effectively reduced agitation over 24 hours (mean [SD] PANSS-EC
      change, -7.1 [4.81 vs -6.7 [4.3], respectively). Reductions in agitation were
      sustained throughout the PO period with both study drugs (mean [SD] change from
      PO period baseline, -0.6 [4.8] vs -1.3 [4.4], respectively). During PO treatment,
      haloperidol-treated patients spontaneously reported significantly more acute
      dystonia than olanzapine-treated patients (4.3%[5/116] vs 0% [0/122],
      respectively; P = 0.026) and akathisia (5.2% [6/116] vs 0% [0/122], respectively;
      P = 0.013). Significantly more haloperidol-treated patients than
      olanzapine-treated patients met categorical criteria for treatment-emergent
      akathisia (18.5% [17/92] vs 6.5% [7/107], respectively; P = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: 
      In the acutely agitated patients with schizophrenia in this study, both IM
      olanzapine 10 mg and IM haloperidol 7.5 mg effectively reduced agitation over 24 
      hours. This alleviation of agitation was sustained following transition from IM
      therapy to 4 days of PO treatment (5-20 mg/d for both). During the 4 days of PO
      treatment, olanzapine-treated patients did not spontaneously report any
      incidences of acute dystonia, and olanzapine had a superior EPS safety profile to
      that of haloperidol. The combination of IM and PO olanzapine may help improve the
      treatment of acutely agitated patients with schizophrenia.

TI  - Aripiprazole, an antipsychotic with a novel mechanism of action, and risperidone 
      vs placebo in patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.
PG  - 681-90
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aripiprazole is a dopamine D2 receptor partial agonist with partial
      agonist activity at serotonin 5HT1A receptors and antagonist activity at 5HT2A
      receptors. This multicenter trial examined the efficacy, safety, and tolerability
      of aripiprazole in patients with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia or
      schizoaffective disorder. METHODS: In this 4-week double-blind study, 404
      patients were randomized to 20 mg/d (n = 101) or 30 mg/d (n = 101) of
      aripiprazole, placebo (n = 103), or 6 mg/d of risperidone (n = 99). Efficacy
      assessments included Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores and
      Clinical Global Impression scores. Safety and tolerability evaluations included
      extrapyramidal symptoms and effects on weight, prolactin, and corrected QT (QTc) 
      interval. RESULTS: Aripiprazole (20 and 30 mg/d) and risperidone (6 mg/d) were
      significantly better than placebo on all efficacy measures. Separation from
      placebo occurred at week 1 for PANSS total and positive scores with aripiprazole 
      and risperidone and for PANSS negative scores with aripiprazole. There were no
      significant differences between aripiprazole and placebo in mean change from
      baseline in the extrapyramidal symptom rating scales. Mean prolactin levels
      decreased with aripiprazole but significantly increased 5-fold with risperidone. 
      Mean change in QTc interval did not differ significantly from placebo with any
      active treatment group. Aripiprazole and risperidone groups showed a similar low 
      incidence of clinically significant weight gain. CONCLUSIONS: Aripiprazole is
      effective, safe, and well tolerated for the positive and negative symptoms in
      schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. It is the first non-D2 receptor
      antagonist with clear antipsychotic effects and represents a novel treatment
      development for psychotic disorders.

TI  - A multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 1-year study of
      bupropion SR for smoking cessation.
PG  - 184-92
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bupropion sustained release (bupropion SR) has been shown to increase
      smoking cessation success rates in the US studies. OBJECTIVE: To determine
      whether bupropion SR, in combination with counselling, is effective for smoking
      cessation in a multi-country study. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial enrolled 707 smokers. A total of 527 received bupropion 
      SR 300 mg daily for 7 weeks and 180 received placebo. A total of 11 clinic visits
      and 10 telephone contacts were scheduled, during the course of 1 year. Seven-week
      and 12-month abstinence rates were the study outcomes. RESULTS: Both continuous
      and weekly point prevalence smoking abstinence rates were significantly higher in
      the bupropion SR group compared with placebo. The continuous abstinence rate from
      weeks 4 to 7 was 46% in the bupropion SR group compared with 23% in the placebo
      group [odds ratio (OR) = 2.82; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.89-4.28; P <
      0.001). At month 12, the continuous abstinence rates were 21% for the bupropion
      SR group and 11% for the placebo group (OR = 2.19; 95% CI 1.29-3.86, P = 0.002). 
      For most nicotine-withdrawal symptoms small changes were measured. Adverse events
      were higher for the bupropion SR group compared with placebo (insomnia 24% vs.
      15%; dry mouth 13% vs. 5%). CONCLUSION: Bupropion SR in combination with
      counselling increased the abstinence rate compared with placebo, and was well
      tolerated.

TI  - Neuropharmacology of TBI-induced plasticity.
PG  - 685-94
AB  - PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this report is to review both fundamental
      studies in laboratory animals and preliminary clinical data suggesting that
      certain drugs may affect behavioural recovery after brain injury. MAIN OUTCOMES
      AND RESULTS: Laboratory studies show that systemically-administered drugs that
      affect specific central neurotransmitters including norepinephrine and GABA
      influence affect recovery in a predictable manner. Although some drugs such as
      d-amphetamine have the potential to enhance recovery, others such as neuroleptics
      and other central dopamine receptor antagonists, benzodiazepines and the
      anti-convulsants phenytoin and phenobarbital may be detrimental. In one study,
      72% of patients with traumatic brain injury received one or a combination of the 
      drugs that may impair recovery based on both animal experiments and studies in
      recovering stroke patients. CONCLUSIONS: Until the true impact of these classes
      of drugs are better understood, care should be exercised in the use of
      medications that may interfere with the recovery process in patients with
      traumatic brain injury. Additional research needs to be completed before the
      clinical efficacy of drugs that may enhance recovery can be established.

TI  - Clozapine: a clinical review of adverse effects and management.
PG  - 33-48
AB  - Clozapine (Clozaril) is a novel and unique prototype atypical, tricyclic,
      dibenzodiazepine-derivative, antipsychotic agent. It has been proven effective
      and significantly superior to placebo, as well as to conventional neuroleptics,
      in several placebo-controlled, double-blind studies in treatment-resistant
      schizophrenia. It has also been found to produce an incidence of extrapyramidal
      symptoms (EPS) as low as that found with placebo. Approximately 30-60% of all
      schizophrenic patients who fail to respond to typical antipsychotics may respond 
      to clozapine. It was the first major advance that marked a turning point in the
      treatment of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders since the introduction
      of the typical antipsychotic agents, i.e., chlorpromazine and haloperidol in the 
      1950s and 1960s, respectively. After its introduction in clinical studies in the 
      United States in the early 1970s, it was withdrawn in 1974, and was not approved 
      for clinical use in the United States until February 1990, because of the risk of
      agranulocytosis. Its novel pharmacological profile, lack of propensity to cause
      EPS in both short- and long-term uses, lack of effects on serum prolactin, and
      ameliorative effects on tardive dyskinesia have resulted in the expansion of its 
      use from refractory schizophrenia to schizoaffective disorders, affective
      disorders, some neurological disorders, aggression, as well as psychosis in
      patients with dementia and parkinsonism. This review covers the history,
      pharmacology, management of side effects, and fetal and neonatal effects of
      clozapine.

TI  - Olanzapine versus divalproex sodium for the treatment of acute mania and
      maintenance of remission: a 47-week study.
PG  - 1263-71
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Few double-blind trials have compared longer-term efficacy and safety 
      of medications for bipolar disorder. The authors report a 47-week comparison of
      olanzapine and divalproex. METHOD: This 47-week, randomized, double-blind study
      compared flexibly dosed olanzapine (5-20 mg/day) to divalproex (500-2500 mg/day) 
      for manic or mixed episodes of bipolar disorder (N=251). The only other
      psychoactive medication allowed was lorazepam for agitation. The primary efficacy
      instrument was the Young Mania Rating Scale; a priori protocol-defined threshold 
      scores were > or =20 for inclusion, < or =12 for remission, and > or = 15 for
      relapse. Analytical techniques included mixed model repeated-measures analysis of
      variance for change from baseline, Fisher's exact test (two-tailed) for
      categorical comparisons, and Kaplan-Meier estimates of time to events of
      interest. RESULTS: Over 47 weeks, mean improvement in Young Mania Rating Scale
      score was significantly greater for the olanzapine group. Median time to
      symptomatic mania remission was significantly shorter for olanzapine, 14 days,
      than for divalproex, 62 days. There were no significant differences between
      treatments in the rates of symptomatic mania remission over the 47 weeks (56.8%
      and 45.5%, respectively) and subsequent relapse into mania or depression (42.3%
      and 56.5%). Treatment-emergent adverse events occurring significantly more
      frequently during olanzapine treatment were somnolence, dry mouth, increased
      appetite, weight gain, akathisia, and high alanine aminotransferase levels; those
      for divalproex were nausea and nervousness. CONCLUSIONS: In this 47-week study of
      acute bipolar mania, symptomatic remission occurred sooner and overall mania
      improvement was greater for olanzapine than for divalproex, but rates of bipolar 
      relapse did not differ.

TI  - Atomoxetine: a selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor for the treatment of
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - 1165-74
AB  - Atomoxetine (Strattera, Eli Lilly & Co.) is a selective noradrenaline reuptake
      inhibitor that has been studied for use in the treatment of
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). So far, two open-label and seven
      randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trials have been
      published, six in youths and three in adults. Each of these trials has shown a
      positive response as measured by the primary efficacy measures, the ADHD-IV
      Rating Scale (ADHD RS) or the Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS).
      Atomoxetine has generally been well tolerated. In November of 2002 the FDA
      approved atomoxetine for use in the US for the treatment of ADHD in children,
      adolescents and adults. Atomoxetine is the first nonstimulant approved by the FDA
      for the treatment of ADHD and the first medication approved for the treatment of 
      adult ADHD.

TI  - SLI-381 (Adderall XR).
PG  - 669-75; discussion 676-7
AB  - SLI-381 is an extended-release formulation of short-acting Adderall, a racemic
      mixture of dextro- and levo-isomers of amphetamine salts. Drug-containing
      microbeads within the SLI-381 capsule give a double-pulsed delivery, similar to
      that achieved by two equal doses of the short-acting formulation administered 4
      hours apart. In an intent-to-treat analysis of a 3-week, double-blind study in
      563 children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), SLI-381 10, 20
      or 30 mg once daily improved mean morning and afternoon behaviour scores compared
      with baseline significantly more than placebo (p < 0.001 for all comparisons), as
      assessed by the Connors Global Index Scale for teachers (CGIS-T). Following
      treatment, CGIS-T scores were similar to those reported in children without ADHD.
      In the same study, a dose-response relationship was observed, and increasing the 
      dosage of SLI-381 by 10mg at weekly intervals, to a maximum of 30 mg once daily, 
      resulted in further improvements in the scores of the CGIS-T. After early morning
      administration of SLI-381 in this double-blind study, late-afternoon scores of
      the CGIS for parents were similar to morning scores. SLI-381 was generally well
      tolerated in randomised trials in children with ADHD for up to 24 months.
      Overall, adverse events were mild to moderate in intensity.

TI  - Tolerability and efficacy of clozapine combined with lithium in schizophrenia and
      schizoaffective disorder.
PG  - 223-8
AB  - The safety and tolerability of clozapine combined with lithium were investigated 
      because of potential additive risks as well as frequent usage in clinical
      practice. Ten hospitalized schizophrenic and 10 schizoaffective patients
      receiving clozapine maintenance therapy with partial therapeutic response were
      studied in a randomized controlled trial. CGI and PANSS outcome ratings were
      employed and a cognitive battery was administered at baseline and after 4 weeks
      of lithium and placebo administration. Barnes and UKU side effect ratings and
      laboratory safety data were obtained. Combined lithium-clozapine treatment was
      well tolerated except for reversible neurotoxic reactions in two schizophrenic
      patients. Safety measures showed no significant variations, even during lithium
      toxicity. Total WBC and absolute granulocyte counts increased with lithium and
      declined with placebo. Schizoaffective patients improved with lithium on CGI and 
      PANSS total and negative symptom scales and the cognitive measures, whereas
      schizophrenic patients did not. Lithium added to clozapine in treatment regimens 
      for hospitalized, treatment-resistant, schizoaffective patients appears to afford
      potential benefit without harmful effects; for schizophrenic patients, however,
      it did not afford improvement but posed a risk of lithium toxicity.

TI  - Differential modulation of remifentanil-induced analgesia and postinfusion
      hyperalgesia by S-ketamine and clonidine in humans.
PG  - 152-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Experimental studies and clinical observations suggest a possible
      role for opioids to induce pain and hyperalgesia on withdrawal. The authors used 
      a new experimental pain model in human skin to determine the time course of
      analgesic and hyperalgesic effects of the mu-receptor agonist remifentanil alone 
      or in combination with the N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor antagonist S-ketamine or
      the alpha(2)-receptor agonist clonidine. METHODS: Thirteen volunteers were
      enrolled in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
      Transcutaneous electrical stimulation at a high current density (2 Hz, 67.3 +/-
      16.8 mA, mean +/- SD) induced acute pain (numerical 11-point rating scale: 5-6
      out of 10) and stable areas of mechanical hyperalgesia to punctate stimuli and
      touch (allodynia). The magnitude of pain and area of hyperalgesia were assessed
      before, during, and after drug infusion (remifentanil at 0.1 microg x kg-1 x
      min-1 and S-ketamine at 5 microg x kg-1 x min-1 over a period of 30 min,
      respectively; clonidine infusion at 2 microg/kg for 5 min). RESULTS: Remifentanil
      reduced pain and areas of punctate hyperalgesia during infusion. In contrast,
      postinfusion pain and hyperalgesia were significantly higher than control. During
      infusion of S-ketamine, pain and hyperalgesia decreased and gradually normalized 
      after infusion. When given in combination, S-ketamine abolished postinfusion
      increase of punctate hyperalgesia but did not reduce increased pain ratings.
      Clonidine alone did not significantly attenuate pain or areas of hyperalgesia.
      However, when given in combination with remifentanil, clonidine attenuated
      postinfusion increase of pain ratings. CONCLUSIONS: Opioid-induced postinfusion
      hyperalgesia could be abolished by S-ketamine, suggesting an
      N-methyl-d-aspartate-receptor mechanism. In contrast, elevated pain ratings after
      infusion were not reduced by ketamine but were alleviated by the
      alpha(2)-receptor agonist clonidine. The results of this study suggest different 
      mechanisms of opioid-induced postinfusion antianalgesia and secondary
      hyperalgesia.

TI  - Calming versus sedative effects of intramuscular olanzapine in agitated patients.
PG  - 192-8
AB  - Distinct calming rather than nonspecific sedation is desirable for the treatment 
      of acute agitation. In 3 double-blind studies, acutely agitated patients with
      schizophrenia (N = 311), bipolar mania (N = 201), or dementia (N = 206) were
      treated with intramuscular (1-3 injections/24 hrs) olanzapine (2.5-10.0 mg),
      haloperidol (7.5 mg), lorazepam (2.0 mg), or placebo. The Agitation-Calmness
      Evaluation Scale (ACES; Eli Lilly and Co.) and treatment-emergent adverse events 
      assessed sedation. Across all studies, 1 patient (lorazepam-treated, bipolar)
      became unarousable. There were no significant between-group differences in ACES
      scores of deep sleep or unarousable at any time across. Excluding asleep
      patients, agitation remained significantly more reduced with olanzapine than
      placebo (P <.05). The incidences of adverse events indicative of sedation were
      not significantly different with olanzapine versus comparators. For the treatment
      of acute agitation associated with schizophrenia, bipolar mania, or dementia,
      intramuscular olanzapine-treated patients experienced no more sedation than
      haloperidol- or lorazepam-treated patients and experienced distinct calming
      rather than nonspecific sedation.

TI  - Reduction in excess daytime sleepiness by modafinil in patients with myotonic
      dystrophy.
PG  - 357-64
AB  - Patients with myotonic dystrophy frequently suffer from excess daytime
      sleepiness, which can be a significant cause of disability. Previous studies have
      indicated that this excess daytime sleepiness is only occasionally due to
      obstructive sleep apnoea and may be principally of central nervous system origin.
      Modafinil has been successfully used to treat narcolepsy, a central disorder
      causing excess daytime sleepiness. We have investigated the use of this drug in
      myotonic dystrophy patients with excess daytime sleepiness. Patients were
      recruited from a clinic population on the basis of screening with the Epworth
      Sleepiness Scale. Patients scoring 10 and above were invited to participate in a 
      randomized double-blind crossover trial of modafinil versus placebo, with four
      weeks in each arm of the study separated by a 2-week washout period. Patients
      were assessed by polysomnography at baseline. The primary outcome measures were
      change in both the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and a modified Maintenance of
      Wakefulness Test, which were measured at the start of each arm of the trial and
      in week 3 of each intervention period. In agreement with previous smaller
      studies, sleepiness is not correlated with CTG expansion size. Treatment with
      modafinil showed a non-significant reduction in median Epworth Sleepiness Scale. 
      However, the median Maintenance of Wakefulness Test score was prolonged by
      treatment (31.7-40 min, P=0.006). There were no significant adverse cardiac
      effects of the drug in this group of patients (resting 12 lead and 24 h ECG
      monitoring). Selected patients with myotonic dystrophy and excess daytime
      sleepiness may benefit from modafinil. In this patient group the Epworth
      Sleepiness Scale may not be the most reliable measure of sleepiness. Despite the 
      potential for cardiac disease in these patients, the drug was well tolerated with
      no adverse effects.

TI  - Long-acting injectable risperidone: efficacy and safety of the first long-acting 
      atypical antipsychotic.
PG  - 1125-32
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors assessed the efficacy and safety of the first long-acting 
      atypical antipsychotic (long-acting injectable risperidone) in patients with
      schizophrenia. METHOD: In a 12-week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized study,
      patients received intramuscular injections every 2 weeks of placebo or
      long-acting risperidone (25 mg, 50 mg, or 75 mg). The primary measure of efficacy
      was the change in total score on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale.
      RESULTS: Of the 554 patients who were enrolled, 400 entered the double-blind
      study, and 370 received at least one postbaseline assessment. Mean changes in
      score of -6.2, -8.5, and -7.4 on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale were
      seen at endpoint for the 25-, 50-, and 75-mg risperidone groups, respectively;
      all three change scores were significantly different from that seen with placebo 
      (+2.6). Improvements in positive and negative symptoms were also significantly
      greater in patients receiving risperidone. Long-acting risperidone was well
      tolerated. Adverse events related to extrapyramidal symptoms were spontaneously
      reported by 13% of patients receiving placebo and 10% of patients in the 25-mg
      risperidone group, with higher rates in the 50-mg and 75-mg groups. Severity of
      extrapyramidal symptoms was mild at baseline and throughout the trial in each
      treatment group. Mean weight changes were small in the 25-, 50-, and 75-mg
      risperidone groups (0.5 kg, 1.2 kg, and 1.9 kg, respectively). Injection site
      pain was rated as low by the patients, consistent with the investigators' pain
      ratings. CONCLUSIONS: Long-acting injectable risperidone was efficacious and well
      tolerated and provides both clinicians and patients with a new mode of treatment 
      that can improve the outcome of long-term therapy.

TI  - Selective inhibition in children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder
      off and on stimulant medication.
PG  - 315-27
AB  - Selective inhibition requires discrimination between auditory signals and is
      assessed using a modification of the stop-signal task. Selective inhibition was
      assessed in a group of 59 clinic-referred, DSM-IV-diagnosed children with
      attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and compared to that of a
      community sample of 59 children. Methylphenidate (MPH) effects on selective
      inhibition were assessed in a subset of the ADHD sample that participated in an
      acute, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial with 3 fixed doses of MPH.
      Children with ADHD performed more poorly than controls on the majority of
      selective stop-signal task parameters: they exhibited more anticipatory (invalid)
      responses, with less accurate and more variable responses on the response
      execution task, as well as a slower selective inhibition process. MPH improved
      speed of both inhibition and response execution processes; it also reduced
      variability of response execution and decreased nonselective inhibition. On the
      one hand, findings are consistent with purported inhibition deficit in ADHD, but 
      on the other hand, suggest that neither the impairment itself, nor MPH effects,
      were restricted to inhibition.

TI  - Motor timing deficits in community and clinical boys with hyperactive behavior:
      the effect of methylphenidate on motor timing.
PG  - 301-13
AB  - In a previous paper we showed that community children with hyperactive behavior
      were more inconsistent than controls in the temporal organization of their motor 
      output. In this study we investigated: (1) various aspects of motor timing
      processes in 13 clinically diagnosed boys with attention deficit hyperactivity
      disorder (ADHD) who were compared to 11 community boys with hyperactive behavior 
      and to a control group and (2) the effect of methylphenidate on the motor timing 
      processes in the clinical group with ADHD in a double blind, cross-over,
      medication-placebo design, including 4 weeks of medication. The clinical group
      with ADHD, like the community group with hyperactivity, showed greater
      variability in sensorimotor synchronization and in sensorimotor anticipation
      relative to controls. The clinical group was also impaired in time perception,
      which was spared in the community group with hyperactivity. The persistent, but
      not the acute dose, of methylphenidate reduced the variability of sensorimotor
      synchronization and anticipation, but had no effect on time perception. This
      study shows that motor timing functions are impaired in both clinical and
      community children with hyperactivity. It is the first study to show the
      effectiveness of persistent administration of methylphenidate on deficits in
      motor timing in ADHD children and extends the use of methylphenidate from the
      domain of attentional and inhibitory functions to the domain of executive motor
      timing.

TI  - The impact upon extra-pyramidal side effects, clinical symptoms and quality of
      life of a switch from conventional to atypical antipsychotics (risperidone or
      olanzapine) in elderly patients with schizophrenia.
PG  - 432-40
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atypical antipsychotics are commonly used in the management of
      schizophrenia in late life with evidence suggesting they induce lower rates of
      motor disturbance, but have similar efficacy to conventional antipsychotics.
      Trials in the elderly have been either retrospective, small, of short duration or
      of a single-arm design. AIMS: To demonstrate the effects upon motor side-effects,
      efficacy, safety and quality of life (QOL) of switching elderly patients with
      schizophrenia from conventional antipsychotics to olanzapine or risperidone.
      METHODS: Elderly patients with schizophrenia were randomly allocated to
      olanzapine or risperidone and followed through an open-label crossover period.
      Between and within group intention to treat analyses were conducted. RESULTS: 66 
      patients were randomised (mean age 69.6 [SD +/- 6.2]). Four (11.8%) patients on
      olanzapine and 8 (26.7%) patients on risperidone failed to complete the crossover
      because of treatment failure [Odds Ratio (OR) = 2.73[0.73-10.2] p = 0.14]. The
      mean doses upon completion of switching in each arm were 9.9 mg (SD = 4.2) and
      1.7 mg (SD = 1.2) for olanzapine and risperidone respectively. In both arms there
      was improvement in Parkinsonism, though only olanzapine was associated with a
      reduction in dyskinetic symptoms. The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, Scale for
      the assessment of Negative Symptoms and Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating
      Scale scores all improved through the crossover period in both arms with no
      between group differences. Treatment with olanzapine was associated with a better
      response over risperidone on the psychological domain of the World Health
      Organisation-Quality Of Life [Brief] (WHO-QOL-BREF) scale ( p = 0.02). Patients
      in the olanzapine arm also demonstrated improvement from baseline in the
      WHO-QOL-BREF physical, psychological and health satisfaction domains, but
      risperidone had no effect on any Quality of Life (QOL) measure. CONCLUSIONS:
      After switching from a conventional antipsychotic, olanzapine and risperidone
      were associated with improvement in core symptoms of schizophrenia and motor side
      effects. Subjects switched to olanzapine were more likely to complete the
      switching process and show an improvement in psychological QOL.

TI  - Atomoxetine.
PG  - 407-15; discussion 416-7
AB  - Atomoxetine, formerly tomoxetine, is a selective norepinephrine reuptake
      inhibitor and a new, nonstimulant treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity
      disorder (ADHD). In vitro, ex vivo and in vivo studies have shown that
      atomoxetine is a highly selective antagonist of the presynaptic norepinephrine
      transporter with little or no affinity for other noradrenergic receptors or other
      neurotransmitter transporters or receptors. In four randomized,
      placebo-controlled clinical trials conducted over 6-9 weeks in children and
      adolescents with ADHD, atomoxetine (total daily dose 1-1.8 mg/kg administered in 
      one or two doses daily) reduced symptoms (hyperactivity, impulsiveness and
      inattention) as determined by the reduction in ADHD total score (34-38% with
      atomoxetine versus 13-15.7% with placebo [p < 0.05]). Atomoxetine also
      significantly improved ADHD subscale rating scores (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001),
      psychosocial well-being (p < 0.05) and ADHD-related problem behavior according to
      parent and teacher ratings (p < 0.05). Atomoxetine was well tolerated in clinical
      trials and discontinuation rates due to adverse events were low (<5%). The most
      common treatment-related adverse event was decreased appetite. Atomoxetine shows 
      no abuse potential and is not a controlled substance in the US.

TI  - Factorial validity of the Conners' Parent Rating Scale-revised: short form with
      psychiatric outpatients.
PG  - 252-9
AB  - To assess the factorial validity of the 27-item Conners' Parent Rating
      Scale-Revised: Short Form (CPRS-R:S; Conners, 1997), 100 (50%) male and 100 (50%)
      female psychiatric outpatients between 5 and 16 years old were rated by a parent.
      A confirmatory factor analysis of the 18 item ratings from the CPRS-R:S
      Oppositional, Cognitive Problems, and Hyperactivity scales provided only
      tentative support for scoring these scales as Conners (1997) recommended.
      However, an exploratory principal-axis factor analysis with all 27 item ratings
      found 2 dimensions: 1 dimension was composed of the 6 items in the Oppositional
      scale, and other dimension contained the remaining 21 items. An attention deficit
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) Total Symptoms scale was constructed by summing the
      ratings for these 21 symptom ratings, and this scale was found to be as effective
      as the Hyperactivity scale was in discriminating between youth who were and were 
      not eventually diagnosed with an ADHD. We discuss the results as providing an
      alternate way of scoring the CPRS-R:S to screen for an ADHD in child and
      adolescent psychiatric outpatients.

TI  - Side-effects of postoperative epidural analgesia in children: a randomized study 
      comparing morphine and clonidine.
PG  - 318-23
AB  - BACKGROUND: Morphine is widely used in association with local anaesthetics for
      postoperative epidural analgesia. There are no data on the prolonged use of
      clonidine for postoperative analgesia in children. The primary outcome of this
      randomized, double-blind trial was to compare the incidence of side-effects after
      epidural infusion of clonidine or morphine, in association with ropivacaine in
      children. METHODS: After institutional approval, 26 children, aged 3-12 years,
      who were scheduled for abdominal surgery, had an epidural catheter placed after
      induction of general anaesthesia. Patients were then randomized to two different 
      groups. After an initial bolus of 2.5 mg x kg-1 0.25% ropivacaine with either 40 
      micro g x kg-1 morphine (group M, n = 14) or 1 micro g x kg-1 clonidine (group C,
      n = 12), an epidural infusion was started at a rate of 0.4 ml x kg-1 x h-1. The
      patients in the M group received an infusion of 0.08% ropivacaine with 10 micro
      g.ml-1 morphine, those in the group C an infusion of 0.08% ropivacaine with 0.6
      micro g.ml-1 clonidine. RESULTS: The two groups were similar with respect to age,
      sex and weight. One patient in the C group was excluded for misplacement of the
      epidural catheter. The incidence of vomiting and pruritus was significantly
      higher in the M group compared with the C group (64% and 85% versus 0%,
      respectively). The incidence of pain was significantly higher in the C group
      compared with the M group (73% versus 29%) as well as the need for rescue
      analgesia medications. CONCLUSIONS: Epidural clonidine is followed by a
      significantly lower incidence of side-effects. However, its analgesic effects, at
      least at the doses used in this study, are less potent than those of epidural
      morphine.

TI  - New generation antipsychotics versus low-potency conventional antipsychotics: a
      systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 1581-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The clearest advantage of new generation, atypical antipsychotics is 
      a reduced risk of extrapyramidal side-effects (EPS), compared with conventional
      compounds. These findings might have been biased by the use of the high-potency
      antipsychotic haloperidol as a comparator in most of the trials. We aimed to
      establish whether the new drugs induce fewer EPS than low-potency conventional
      antipsychotics. METHODS: We did a meta-analysis of all randomised controlled
      trials in which new generation antipsychotics had been compared with low-potency 
      (equivalent or less potent than chlorpromazine) conventional drugs. We included
      studies that met quality criteria A or B in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook, 
      and assessed quality with the Jadad scale. The primary outcome of interest was
      the number of patients who had at least one EPS. We used risk differences and 95%
      CIs as measures of effect size. FINDINGS: We identified 31 studies with a total
      of 2320 participants. Of the new generation drugs, only clozapine was associated 
      with significantly fewer EPS (RD=-0.15, 95% CI -0.26 to -0.4, p=0.008) and higher
      efficacy than low-potency conventional drugs. Reduced frequency of EPS seen with 
      olanzapine was of borderline significance (-0.15, -0.31 to -0.01, p=0.07). Only
      one inconclusive trial of amisulpride, quetiapine, and risperidone and no
      investigations of ziprasidone and sertindole were identified, but some evidence
      indicates that zotepine and remoxipride do not lead to fewer EPS than low-potency
      antipsychotics. Mean doses less than 600 mg/day of chlorpromazine or its
      equivalent had no higher risk of EPS than new generation drugs. As a group, new
      generation drugs were moderately more efficacious than low-potency
      antipsychotics, largely irrespective of the comparator doses used.
      INTERPRETATION: Optimum doses of low-potency conventional antipsychotics might
      not induce more EPS than new generation drugs. Potential advantages in efficacy
      of the new generation drugs should be a factor in clinical treatment decisions to
      use these rather than conventional drugs.

TI  - Methylphenidate enhances both intracortical inhibition and facilitation in
      healthy adults.
PG  - 79-82
AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to investigate the effect of the
      psychostimulant drug methylphenidate (MPH) on motor cortex excitability in
      healthy adults (n = 12) in a placebo-controlled, crossover design study. MPH
      caused an enhancement of intracortical inhibition as well as intracortical
      facilitation. Enhancement of both of these TMS parameters was unexpected and
      suggests that MPH exerts its action on the motor cortex not only through the
      dopaminergic neurotransmitter system.

TI  - Relative lack of cognitive effects of methylphenidate in elderly male volunteers.
PG  - 455-64
AB  - RATIONALE: Methylphenidate, a dopaminergic and noradrenergic reuptake inhibitor, 
      has been shown in young, healthy adult volunteers to produce pronounced effects
      on working memory and sustained attention. We were interested in assessing
      whether similar improvements could be conferred upon elderly volunteers in order 
      to gain a more complete understanding of the effects of age on monoaminergic
      manipulations of working memory and attention, as well as to explore the
      potential for pharmacological intervention in attention and executive dysfunction
      disorders in this age group. OBJECTIVES: The main aim of the study was to
      characterise the dose-related effects of methylphenidate on a range of
      neuropsychological functions in elderly healthy volunteers. METHODS: Sixty
      healthy elderly adult male volunteers received either a single oral dose of
      placebo, 20 mg or 40 mg methylphenidate prior to performing a variety of tasks
      designed to assess memory, attention and executive function. A randomised
      double-blind, between-subjects design was used. RESULTS: Methylphenidate had
      significant cardiovascular and subjective effects. However, unlike in younger
      volunteers, no significant effects of drug on working memory (spatial span and
      spatial working memory), response inhibition (stop-signal) or sustained attention
      (rapid visual information processing) were seen. Subtle effects on latency
      similar to those in younger volunteers were identified: both doses of
      methylphenidate resulted in a slowing in response time during set-shifting and
      decision-making. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate that, in
      elderly subjects, the cognitive effects of methylphenidate are grossly attenuated
      and distinct from the profile previously described in younger volunteers. It is
      suggested that methylphenidate may not be appropriate as a pharmacological
      intervention in elderly patient groups, such as those reporting age-related
      cognitive decline.

TI  - Olanzapine vs risperidone in the management of schizophrenia: a randomized
      double-blind trial in Australia and New Zealand.
PG  - 303-14
AB  - Improved drug therapy for schizophrenia may represent the best strategy for
      reducing the costs of schizophrenia and the recurrent chronic course of the
      disease. Olanzapine and risperidone are atypical antipsychotic agents developed
      to meet this need. We report a multicenter, double-blind, parallel, 30-week study
      designed to compare the efficacy, safety, and associated resource use for
      olanzapine and risperidone in Australia and New Zealand. The study sample
      consisted of 65 patients who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia,
      schizoaffective disorder, or schizophreniform disorder. Olanzapine-treated
      patients showed a significantly greater reduction in Positive and Negative
      Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) total, and
      PANSS General Psychopathology scores at endpoint compared to the
      risperidone-treated patients. Response rates through 30 weeks showed a
      significantly greater proportion of olanzapine-treated patients had achieved a
      20% or greater improvement in their PANSS total score compared to
      risperidone-treated patients. Olanzapine and risperidone were equivalent in their
      improvement of PANSS positive and negative scores and Clinical Global
      Impression-Severity of Illness scale (CGI-S) at endpoint. Using generic and
      disease-specific measures of quality of life, olanzapine-treated patients showed 
      significant within-group improvement in most measures, and significant
      differences were observed in favor of olanzapine over risperidone in Quality of
      Life Scale (QLS) Intrapsychic Foundation and Medical Outcomes Study Short Form
      36-item instrument (SF-36) Role Functioning Limitations-Emotional subscale
      scores. Despite the relatively small sample size, our study suggests that
      olanzapine has a superior risk:benefit profile compared to risperidone.

TI  - Are patients enrolled in first episode psychosis drug trials representative of
      patients treated in routine clinical practice?
PG  - 149-55
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence on efficacy of antipsychotic medications comes primarily
      from controlled trials which select eligible consenting patients for experimental
      and regimented treatments, who do not abuse drugs, and are in good general
      health. Thus, it is not clear to what extent results are generalizable to most
      individuals treated for a psychotic illness who may not be eligible for such
      trials. OBJECTIVE: This study compared characteristics of patients treated in a
      large randomized trial of persons with early psychosis to a cohort from a large
      epidemiological study of first episode psychosis. METHODS: Included were the 535 
      patients enrolled in a controlled trial of antipsychotic medication and 179
      similarly diagnosed persons from the Suffolk County Mental Health epidemiological
      study. Drug trial exclusion criteria were used to estimate the number of patients
      from the epidemiological study who would have been ineligible for the drug trial.
      The two samples were compared on key characteristics. RESULTS: Thirty-three
      percent (n=59) of the epidemiological sample did not meet inclusion criteria for 
      the drug trial (due to antidepressant treatment, n=26; current substance abuse,
      n=18; recent suicide attempt, n=9; and for more than one reason, n=6). There were
      no significant differences between the two study samples on age of onset, age,
      gender and premorbid functioning. Drug trial patients had higher Brief
      Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), slightly lower Clinical Global Impression (CGI),
      and less formal education than those in the epidemiological study. CONCLUSIONS:
      While some patients in the epidemiological sample would have been excluded from
      the drug trial, patients in the two studies were similar on several key
      variables.

TI  - Aripiprazole in the treatment of schizophrenia: safety and tolerability in
      short-term, placebo-controlled trials.
PG  - 123-36
AB  - Aripiprazole is a novel antipsychotic with a unique mechanism of action.
      Presented here is a pooled analysis of safety and tolerability data from all
      completed short-term, placebo-controlled trials in schizophrenia from the
      aripiprazole clinical development program. Data were analyzed from five 4- to
      6-week double-blind multicenter studies of patients hospitalized with acute
      relapse of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder randomized to aripiprazole
      (n=932), placebo (n=416), or haloperidol (n=201). Daily aripiprazole doses ranged
      from 2 to 30 mg. Safety assessments included adverse event (AE) reports, EPS
      scales, ECGs, weight, and prolactin, glucose and cholesterol levels. Aripiprazole
      was well tolerated, with similar AE incidence rates to placebo, and lower rates
      than haloperidol for akathisia, extrapyramidal syndrome and somnolence. Objective
      EPS assessments demonstrated no significant differences between aripiprazole and 
      placebo on Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS) scores, no dose-dependent effects on Barnes 
      Akathisia scores, and significant reductions in Abnormal Involuntary Movement
      Scale (AIMS) scores from baseline vs. placebo (p</=0.01). Haloperidol showed
      increased SAS and Barnes Akathisia scores over placebo (p</=0.01). There was
      minimal mean weight change with aripiprazole (+0.71 kg) and haloperidol (+0.56
      kg), and a lack of QT(c) prolongation. Serum prolactin increased with
      haloperidol, but not aripiprazole. In conclusion, aripiprazole shows a favorable 
      safety and tolerability profile with low potential for EPS, weight gain,
      prolactin elevation, QT(c) prolongation, and sedation. Aripiprazole's safety
      profile may offer benefits in schizophrenia treatment.

TI  - Bupropion SR for smoking cessation in smokers with cardiovascular disease: a
      multicentre, randomised study.
PG  - 946-55
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the safety and efficacy of bupropion sustained release
      (bupropion SR) in promoting abstinence from smoking in subjects with
      cardiovascular disease (CVD). METHODS: Six hundred twenty-nine subjects with CVD 
      who smoked >/=10 cigarettes/day were randomised in a double-blind, multicentre
      study to receive bupropion SR (150 mg twice daily) or placebo for 7 weeks, with a
      follow-up of 52 weeks. Primary efficacy endpoint: continuous abstinence from
      smoking from weeks 4 to 7. Secondary endpoints: continuous abstinence (weeks
      4-12, 4-26 and 4-52) and weekly point prevalence abstinence. All participants
      received brief motivational support. Safety was evaluated throughout the study.
      RESULTS: Continuous smoking abstinence rates from weeks 4 to 7 were significantly
      higher in subjects receiving bupropion SR compared with placebo (43 vs. 19%, odds
      ratio [OR]=3.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.24-4.84; P<0.001). Continuous
      abstinence rates from weeks 4 to 26 and 4 to 52 continued to be more than double 
      for bupropion SR compared with placebo (27 vs. 11%; 22 vs. 9%, P<0.001). Weekly
      point prevalence abstinence was significantly higher for participants who
      received bupropion SR compared with placebo at weeks 3, 7, 26 and 52 (P<0.001).
      In both groups, there were no clinically significant changes in blood pressure
      and heart rate throughout the treatment phase. Overall, 6% of the participants
      (n=36) discontinued study medication due to an adverse event (bupropion SR, n=17;
      placebo, n=19). CONCLUSIONS: After 7 weeks of bupropion SR treatment, more than
      twice as many smokers with CVD had quit smoking at 1 year compared with placebo. 
      The safety profile of bupropion SR was similar to that previously observed in
      general smoking populations.

TI  - Initiating treatment with modafinil for control of excessive daytime sleepiness
      in patients switching from methylphenidate: an open-label safety study assessing 
      three strategies.
PG  - 380-5
AB  - RATIONALE: Modafinil is a first-line wake-promoting medication and a useful
      therapeutic alternative to psychostimulant medications for excessive daytime
      sleepiness. OBJECTIVE: This 5-week, randomized, open-label study evaluated three 
      strategies for switching patients from methylphenidate, a commonly used
      psychostimulant, to modafinil. METHODS: Patients ( n=40) with excessive daytime
      sleepiness related to narcolepsy, who had received previous treatment with
      methylphenidate, were switched from methylphenidate to modafinil (200 mg/day
      followed by 400 mg/day) without a washout period between treatments, with a 2-day
      washout period between treatments, or by using a taper-down/titrate-up protocol. 
      Adverse events were recorded throughout the study, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale
      scores were determined at the end of the study. RESULTS: The majority of patients
      (95%) were successfully switched to modafinil. At the study end point, mean
      Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores were <12 for each treatment group. All three
      switching strategies were well tolerated, with adverse events mild or moderate in
      nature. Adverse events most frequently reported during modafinil treatment were
      among those seen previously in large-scale, placebo-controlled studies. There
      were no meaningful differences among the treatment groups in the frequency or
      severity of adverse events or in their relationship to modafinil treatment. Only 
      one patient discontinued modafinil treatment because of a treatment-related
      adverse event (i.e. moderate headache); another patient discontinued due to
      insufficient efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Switching from methylphenidate to modafinil
      was well tolerated with or without a washout period or when the methylphenidate
      dose is gradually tapered during initiation of modafinil therapy. Daytime
      wakefulness was maintained in patients who have switched from methylphenidate to 
      modafinil. These data suggest that patients with narcolepsy may be switched from 
      methylphenidate to modafinil with few complications and inconveniences.

TI  - Atypical and conventional antipsychotic drugs in treatment-naive first-episode
      schizophrenia: a 52-week randomized trial of clozapine vs chlorpromazine.
PG  - 995-1003
AB  - The purported advantages of second-generation or "atypical" antipsychotics
      relative to first-generation antipsychotics have not been examined in patients
      with a first episode of schizophrenia. This flexible-dose study examined efficacy
      and safety in a randomized, double-blind, 52-week trial, comparing chlorpromazine
      (CPZ) and clozapine (CLZ) in treatment naive patients experiencing their first
      episode of schizophrenia. In all, 160 inpatients with first-episode schizophrenia
      or schizophreniform disorder were randomized to CPZ or CLZ and followed them for 
      52 weeks or until dropout. The primary efficacy measure was time to first
      remission and proportion of time remaining in remission. The analysis was
      supplemented by comparisons on a profile of clinical symptoms and side effects.
      Of these first-episode patients, 80% achieved remission within 1 year (79% CPZ,
      81% CLZ). The Kaplan-Meier estimated median time to first remission was 8 weeks
      for CLZ vs 12 weeks for CPZ (chi(2)(1)=5.56, p=0.02). Both the rate of first
      achieving remission and the odds for being in remission during the trial were
      almost doubled for the CLZ group in comparison with the CPZ group. At 12 weeks,
      CLZ was superior on many rating scale measures of symptom severity while CPZ was 
      not superior on any. These symptom differences remained significant when
      controlling for EPS differences. By 52 weeks many of the symptom differences
      between groups were no longer significantly different. Generally, CLZ produced
      fewer side effects than CPZ, particularly extrapyramidal side effects. There was 
      no significant difference between treatments in weight change or glucose
      metabolism. For each prior year of untreated psychosis, there was a 15% decrease 
      in the odds of achieving remission (OR=0.85; CI 0.75-0.95). A high proportion of 
      first-episode patients remitted within 1 year. We detected no difference in the
      proportion of first-episode patients receiving CLZ or CPZ that achieved
      remission. However, first-episode patients receiving CLZ remitted significantly
      faster and remained in remission longer than subjects receiving CPZ. While the
      CLZ group showed significantly less symptomatology on some measures and fewer
      side effects at 12 weeks, the two treatment groups seemed to converge by 1 year. 
      Longer duration of untreated psychosis was associated with lower odds of
      achieving remission.

TI  - Aripiprazole: efficacy and tolerability profile of a novel-acting atypical
      antipsychotic.
PG  - 145-51
AB  - Aripiprazole, the latest atypical antipsychotic to come to clinical practice, has
      a proposed mechanism of action different to other agents, most notably in its
      partial agonist action at dopamine (D2) receptors and at serotonin (5HT1A)
      receptors. Placebo-controlled comparative trials of aripiprazole confirm efficacy
      for positive, negative and general psychopathology. Treatment-emergent adverse
      effects appear low. Aripiprazole is associated with low propensity for
      extrapyramidal side effects, an absence hyperprolactinemia and a low propensity
      for weight gain. Aripiprazole's clinical role will be determined by clinical
      experience, additional phase IV studies, and comparative information for this
      agent with respect to the efficacy and tolerability profiles of other atypical
      antipsychotic medications.

TI  - A placebo-controlled trial of risperidone in Tourette syndrome.
PG  - 1130-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of risperidone in children and
      adults with Tourette syndrome. METHODS: This was an 8-week, randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The primary outcome measure was the Total
      Tic score of the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS). RESULTS: Thirty-four
      medication-free subjects (26 children and 8 adults) ranging in age from 6 to 62
      years (mean = 19.7 +/- 17.0 years) participated. YGTSS Total Tic scores were
      similar at baseline (26.0 +/- 5.1 for risperidone vs 27.4 +/- 8.5 for placebo).
      After 8 weeks of treatment (mean daily dose of 2.5 +/- 0.85), the 16 subjects on 
      risperidone showed a 32% reduction in tic severity from baseline, compared to a
      7% reduction for placebo patients (n = 18) (F[2,64] = 6.07; p = 0.004). The 12
      children randomized to risperidone showed a 36% reduction in tic symptoms
      compared to an 11% decrease in the 14 children on placebo (F[2,48] = 6.38; p =
      0.004). Two children on risperidone showed acute social phobia, which resolved
      with dose reduction in one subject but resulted in medication discontinuation in 
      the other. A mean increase in body weight of 2.8 kg was observed in the
      risperidone group compared to no change in placebo (F[2,64] = 10.68; p = 0.0001).
      No extrapyramidal symptoms and no clinically significant alterations in cardiac
      conduction times or laboratory measures were observed. CONCLUSION: Risperidone
      appears to be safe and effective for short-term treatment of tics in children or 
      adults with Tourette syndrome. Longer-term studies are needed to evaluate the
      durability of efficacy and safety over time.

TI  - A placebo-controlled study of lofexidine in the treatment of children with tic
      disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - 113-9
AB  - This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of Lofexidine in treating children
      with tic disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Subjects 
      from a specialty tic disorders clinic were randomly assigned to receive 8 weeks
      of treatment with lofexidine or placebo under double-blind conditions. Follow-up 
      visits occurred every 2 weeks for safety monitoring and dose adjustment.
      Fourty-four medication-free subjects (41 boys and three girls; mean age of 10.4
      years) with ADHD, combined type, and a tic disorder participated. After 8 weeks
      of treatment, lofexidine was associated with a mean improvement of 41% in the
      total score on the teacher-rated ADHD Rating Scale compared to 7% improvement for
      placebo. Eleven of 22 subjects who received lofexidine were blindly rated on the 
      Clinical Global Scale-Improvement as either much improved or very much improved
      compared to none of 22 subjects who received placebo. The mean score on the
      parent-rated hyperactivity index improved by 29% in the lofexidine group and 18% 
      in the placebo group, which was not a significant difference. On the Continuous
      Performance Test, commission errors decreased by 25% and omission errors by 20%
      in the lofexidine group, compared with increases of 33% in commission errors and 
      of 36% in omission errors in the placebo group. Tic severity decreased by 27% in 
      the lofexidine group, compared to 0% in the placebo group. One lofexidine subject
      with sedation withdrew at week 4. Lofexidine was associated with insignificant
      decreases in blood pressure and pulse. Lofexidine appears to be a safe and
      effective treatment for children with tic disorders and ADHD.

TI  - Effects of nicardipine and clonidine on cognitive functions and
      electroencephalography in hypertensive patients.
PG  - 527-35
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the cognitive and electroencephalography
      (EEG) short-term effects of a calcium antagonist, nicardipine, compared to
      placebo and clonidine (which, having known sedative effects, acted as a negative 
      control) for 15 days in elderly hypertensive patients with memory complaints.
      Nicardipine and clonidine were compared with placebo in a double-blind,
      randomized, three-way cross-over controlled study after a 2-week placebo run-in
      period. This was a phase II clinical study carried out on out-patients in a
      single research centre. Fifteen elderly (63 +/- 10 years) hypertensive patients, 
      without dementia but with memory complaints, were included. Psychomotor
      performance and cognition were assessed using both an extensive battery of
      validated psychometric tests (which evaluated attention and vigilance, body sway 
      and memory) and an EEG profile. Cardiovascular parameters measured were blood
      pressure and heart rate. No detrimental effects of nicardipine were found on
      attention, vigilance, body sway or memory. Nicardipine produced a significant
      increase in alpha EEG energies, which may indicate possible alerting effects. In 
      contrast, clonidine induced well-known deleterious sedative effects in
      psychometric tests and in EEG analysis (decrease in alpha and increase in delta
      and theta waves). The two drugs produced equivalent decreases in blood pressure
      at steady state. In conclusion, clonidine induced well-known sedative effects,
      while nicardipine did not impair central nervous system activity and may have had
      some short-term alerting effects in elderly hypertensive patients with memory
      complaints. This study supports the hypothesis of a dissociation between blood
      pressure and direct drug effects on the central nervous system.

TI  - Differential sensitivity to acute administration of Ritalin, apomorphine, SCH
      23390, but not raclopride in mice selectively bred for hyperactive wheel-running 
      behavior.
PG  - 242-50
AB  - RATIONALE: Previous studies of mice ( Mus domesticus) selectively bred for high
      voluntary wheel running have suggested that the hyperactivity is associated with 
      dysfunction in the dopaminergic neuromodulatory system and that high-running mice
      may represent a useful genetic model for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
      (ADHD). OBJECTIVES: We tested the hypothesis that mice from the four replicate
      hyperactive lines would respond differently to methylphenidate (Ritalin),
      apomorphine (non-selective dopamine agonist), SCH 23390 (selective D1-like
      dopamine antagonist), and raclopride (selective D2-like dopamine antagonist) than
      individuals from the four replicate, randomly bred, control lines. METHODS: After
      animals were habituated (3 weeks) to their cages with attached wheels, drugs were
      administered via intraperitoneal injections, at night, during peak wheel-running 
      activity. Revolutions on wheels 10-70 min post-injection were used to quantify
      drug responses. RESULTS: Ritalin (15 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg) increased wheel running 
      in control lines but decreased running in selected lines. A low-dose (0.125
      mg/kg) of apomorphine reduced wheel running by a similar amount in control and
      selected lines; however, higher doses of apomorphine (0.25 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg)
      produced greater reductions in wheel running in the control lines. SCH 23390
      (0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 mg/kg) caused greater reductions in wheel running in
      control than in selected lines. Raclopride (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/kg) reduced wheel
      running by a similar amount in control and selected lines. CONCLUSIONS: These
      results support the interpretation that genetically determined hyperactive
      wheel-running behavior is associated with altered dopaminergic function in this
      mouse model. More specifically, results suggest that D1-like (D1 or D5), but not 
      D2-like (D2, D3, or D4), dopamine receptors have reduced function in the
      high-running mice. The fact that Ritalin decreased wheel running in selected
      lines further supports their use as an animal model of ADHD.

TI  - Ziprasidone in the treatment of acute bipolar mania: a three-week,
      placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial.
PG  - 741-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of ziprasidone,
      compared with placebo, in the treatment of adult patients with acute bipolar
      mania. METHOD: Patients with a primary DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar I disorder and
      a current manic or mixed episode (confirmed by the Structured Clinical Interview 
      for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders, Patient Edition) (N=210) were randomly assigned in a
      2:1 ratio to 3 weeks of double-blind treatment with ziprasidone (40-80 mg twice
      daily) or placebo. Efficacy was assessed with the Schedule for Affective
      Disorders and Schizophrenia, Change Version (which contains the Mania Rating
      Scale), Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Clinical Global Impression (CGI)
      severity scale, CGI improvement scale, and Global Assessment of Functioning
      Scale. Primary efficacy variables were differences from baseline to endpoint
      (last observation carried forward) in mean Mania Rating Scale and CGI severity
      scale scores between the ziprasidone and placebo groups. Safety evaluations
      included monitoring of adverse events, vital signs, electrocardiogram results,
      and clinical laboratory values and assessment of movement disorders and
      akathisia. RESULTS: Ziprasidone produced rapid, sustained improvements relative
      to baseline and placebo on all primary and most secondary efficacy measures at
      endpoint. Significant improvements were typically observed within 2 days after
      treatment commenced and were maintained throughout the 3 weeks. Ziprasidone was
      well tolerated and associated with a low rate of extrapyramidal symptoms; neither
      weight gain nor clinically significant changes in vital signs or other safety
      parameters were observed with ziprasidone. CONCLUSIONS: Ziprasidone monotherapy
      was significantly superior to placebo in reducing symptoms of acute mania in
      patients with bipolar I disorder. Onset of action was rapid, and tolerability of 
      ziprasidone was generally comparable to that of placebo.

TI  - Bupropion SR for smoking cessation.
PG  - 533-40
AB  - Cigarette dependence is recognised as a life-threatening disorder which can be
      treated by behavioural support and/or medication. Bupropion hydrochloride
      sustained-release (Zyban trade mark, GlaxoSmithKline) is licensed in many
      countries including the US, Canada, UK, Australia and continental Europe to aid
      smoking cessation. The usual recommended dose is 150 mg b.i.d. taken for 7 - 14
      days prior to the quit date, and then 6 - 8 weeks afterwards (figures vary across
      countries). Evidence from seven double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised
      trials shows that it improves success at staying off cigarettes for at least 12
      months by 9 - 10 percentage points. Taking into account estimates of subsequent
      cessation and relapse patterns in treated and untreated smokers, and the
      improvement in life-expectancy of smokers who manage to stop, the estimated
      cost/life/year saved from an episode of use of the medication is approximately UK
      pound 1000 or US$1500. Bupropion has CNS stimulant properties; the common side
      effects are dry mouth and sleep disturbance. Rare but serious side effects are
      anaphylactic/hypersensitivity reaction and seizure (both estimated at 1 in a
      1000). The drug is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug 
      or its metabolites, any seizure disorder, eating disorder, severe hepatic
      cirrhosis, history of bipolar disorder or in patients taking monoamine oxidase
      inhibitors. Extreme caution is advised where there are any predisposing factors
      that may reduce the seizure threshold. Bupropion sustained-release and nicotine
      replacement therapies are both considered as first-line treatments to aid smoking
      cessation. Ideally patients should also enrol in a structured behavioural support
      programme to boost their chances of success.

TI  - [Can the addition of clonidine improve the analgesic efficacy of low dose
      intrathecal morphine? A randomised double-blind trial].
PG  - 204-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the influence of intrathecal clonidine on spinal morphine 
      analgesia and adverse effects after major orthopaedic surgery. METHODS: The study
      was approved by the local Ethics Committee.After written informed consent, 45 ASA
      I-III patients scheduled for hip or knee replacement were included. Patients were
      randomly allocated to receive either placebo, 0.1 mg morphine or 0.1 mg
      morphine+50 microg clonidine in addition to 15 mg bupivacaine intrathecally. The 
      primary outcome parameter was the time to first opioid request. Statistical
      differences were calculated with U-test or Fisher's exact test. RESULTS:
      Clonidine did not result in a significant improvement of postoperative analgesia.
      The mean time until first opioid request was for placebo 10.3+/-7.9 h, for 0.1 mg
      morphine 23.0+/-3.9 h and for 0.1 mg morphine+ 50 microg clonidine 21+/-6.9 h,
      respectively. Clonidine significantly increased the rate of adverse effects.
      CONCLUSION: Our trial did not confirm an improved analgesia with the combination 
      of intrathecal morphine and clonidine. Due to increased adverse effects the
      combination of intrathecal clonidine and morphine does not seem to be a
      reasonable alternative in the management of postoperative pain after orthopaedic 
      surgery.

TI  - Clinical trial response and dropout rates with olanzapine versus risperidone.
PG  - 556-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: In schizophrenia, comparing treatment dropouts between olanzapine and
      risperidone can be useful to better understand their relative effectiveness.
      OBJECTIVE: To analyze the differences in the rates of dropout from clinical
      trials and response between these 2 antipsychotics. METHODS: Literature search
      was based on MEDLINE (1966-May 2002). Analysis 1 included 4 randomized studies
      (838 patients), analysis 2 included 2 randomized studies (n = 716), and analysis 
      3 assessed 5 clinical studies for olanzapine (n = 928) and 3 for risperidone (n =
      290). Odds ratios were estimated by the fixed-effect model. RESULTS: The risk of 
      treatment discontinuation (analysis 1) was significantly greater for risperidone 
      than for olanzapine (42% vs. 33%, respectively). The response rates were
      identical for the 2 drugs (analysis 2). A slightly better pattern of maintenance 
      of response was found for olanzapine (analysis 3). CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of
      dropout and maintenance of remission seems to be better controlled for olanzapine
      than for risperidone.

TI  - Measurement of simple reaction time in antipsychotic treatment of patients with
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 58-62
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of simple reaction time in schizophrenia has been
      extensively reported to date in professional literature. However, most studies
      have examined basic reaction time under static conditions using a single
      measurement. The aim of the present study was to establish whether any changes
      occur in simple reaction time during treatment with risperidone or olanzapine in 
      in-patients suffering a relapse of schizophrenia. METHODS: Seventeen in-patients 
      suffering acute relapse of schizophrenia (DSM IV criteria) and twenty matched,
      healthy controls participated in an eight-week, double-blind pilot study. The
      patients were treated with conventional antipsychotics for seven days after
      admission and were then randomised to the treatment arms with risperidone (4
      mg/day) or with olanzapine (10 mg/day) at a fixed dosage in the first week and
      thereafter in flexible dosages for the remaining seven weeks. Since no
      differences were found between reaction times of patients treated with
      risperidone or olanzapine, the two treatment groups were merged in the
      statistical analysis before being compared with the normal controls.
      Psychopathological symptoms were assessed using the Positive and Negative Symptom
      Scale (PANSS) and extrapyramidal symptoms with the Simpson Angus Scale and
      Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale. Reaction time was measured with the Alpha
      apparatus, connected to a personal computer. All assessments and measurements
      were conducted four times during the treatment phase of the study. RESULTS: The
      reaction time of patients was significantly longer than that of the healthy
      controls (t1 = 17.11; p1 < 0.05). After eight weeks of treatment the reaction
      time of patients significantly improved but did not reach that of the healthy
      controls (t4 = 28.18, p4 < 0.05). Furthermore, the improved reaction time in the 
      patients did not correlate with improvement of psychopathological symptoms or
      with improved extrapyramidal symptoms. CONCLUSION: The results of the study
      suggest that simple reaction time can improve during treatment with atypical
      antipsychotics.

TI  - Dorzolamide X apraclonidine in the prevention of the intraocular pressure spike
      after Nd : YAG laser posterior capsulotomy.
PG  - 237-41
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of dorzolamide compared to apraclonidine, in 
      the prevention of the intra-ocular pressure (IOP) spike after Nd :YAG laser
      posterior capsulotomy. SITE: Department of Ophthalmology, State University of
      Campinas (UNICAMP) General Hospital, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil. METHODS: In a
      double masked prospective clinical trial, 217 eyes from 217 patients were
      randomly assigned to receive either dorzolamide 2 h before and placebo 1 h before
      Nd : YAG laser capsulotomy or placebo 2 h before and apraclonidine 1 h before the
      procedure. Inclusion criteria were secondary cataracts with reduction in best
      corrected visual acuity (BCVA < 20/40), absence of manifest or suspected glaucoma
      and no known hypersensitivity to the study drugs. IOP was measured 2 h and 1 h
      before applying the laser, and 1 h, 2 h, 3 h and 7 days after. RESULTS: There
      were no statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding
      the IOP 2 h and 1 h before the procedure, and 1 h, 2 h, 3 h and 7 days after the 
      laser treatment (p values, respectively: 0.077, 0.21, 0.085, 0.36, and 0.60).
      CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that dorzolamide is as safe and
      effective as apraclonidine in the prevention of the IOP elevation after Nd : YAG 
      laser posterior capsulotomy. Synopsis. The efficacy of dorzolamide was compared
      to apraclonidine in the prevention of the intraocular pressure spike after Nd :
      YAG laser posterior capsulotomy in 217 patients and the results were similar with
      both drugs.

TI  - Evaluation of the effects of lofexidine and clonidine on naloxone-precipitated
      withdrawal in opioid-dependent humans.
PG  - 427-39
AB  - AIMS: To examine the efficacy of lofexidine, an alpha2 adrenergic agonist, to
      suppress opioid withdrawal symptoms in opioid-dependent humans under in-patient
      laboratory conditions by using a naloxone challenge procedure. DESIGN:
      Randomized, within-subject, cross-over design with drug administration taking
      place under double-blind and triple-dummy conditions. SETTING: A 14-bed
      in-patient hospital research unit dedicated to the conduct of behavioral
      pharmacology studies. PARTICIPANTS: Eight healthy adult volunteers (two
      female/six male) with histories of polysubstance abuse and current physical
      dependence on opioids. INTERVENTION: Participants were stabilized onto methadone 
      and maintained on 30 mg/day, p.o. throughout the study. Oral placebo, lofexidine 
      (0.4, 0.8 and 1.6 mg, p.o.) and clonidine (0.1 and 0.2 mg, p.o.) were each tested
      as pre-treatments once in combination with each of three intramuscular naloxone
      doses (0, 0.1 and 0.3 mg, i.m.) during 18 separate experimental sessions.
      MEASUREMENTS: An array of physiological indices (e.g. heart rate, blood pressure,
      pupil diameter) as well as a number of subjective and observer-rating scales
      sensitive to opioid withdrawal effects. FINDINGS: As expected, lofexidine and
      clonidine both produced dose-related decreases in blood pressure and heart rate
      but few subjective effects; naloxone increased opioid withdrawal signs and
      symptoms in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Although both lofexidine and
      clonidine reduced the cardiovascular response to naloxone challenge, close
      inspection of the data reveal that this occurred only to the extent that baseline
      physiological parameters were reduced, while neither drug significantly modified 
      the overall magnitude of the response to naloxone. Moreover, neither lofexidine
      nor clonidine suppressed the subjective discomfort of opioid withdrawal or
      significantly reduced other autonomic signs of opioid withdrawal, such as
      lacrimation or rhinorrhea. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that lofexidine is
      well tolerated even at supratherapeutic acute doses. However, its failure to
      modify most signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal suggest that its effective
      use in spontaneous withdrawal will require concomitant medications for improved
      therapeutic response.

TI  - Smoking withdrawal dynamics: II. Improved tests of withdrawal-relapse relations.
PG  - 14-27
AB  - In this article, the authors assessed whether continuously scaled symptom
      parameters derived from growth models (T. M. Piasecki et al., 2003) are linked to
      smoking at long-term follow-up by using data from a large-scale clinical trial (N
      = 893). Results revealed that higher withdrawal intercepts, positive linear
      slopes, and greater volatility were all positively associated with relapse, and
      cigarette coefficients (indicating smoking-induced withdrawal reduction) were
      negatively related to relapse. In models keyed around the first lapse to smoking,
      those destined to lapse reported more severe withdrawal during abstinence, and
      withdrawal patterns discriminated groups defined according to lapse duration. The
      findings complement earlier heterogeneity studies in implicating the pattern of
      changing withdrawal symptoms over time as a factor strongly associated with
      smoking relapse.

TI  - Intrathecal clonidine added to a bupivacaine-morphine spinal anesthetic improves 
      postoperative analgesia for total knee arthroplasty.
PG  - 1083-8, table of contents
AB  - Postoperative pain after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is severe and can
      complicate early physical therapy. We tested the hypothesis that intrathecal
      clonidine would improve postoperative analgesia for TKA using a hyperbaric
      bupivacaine spinal anesthetic. In a double-blinded, placebo-controlled protocol, 
      81 ASA physical status I-III patients undergoing either a single or bilateral TKA
      were randomized into 4 groups with the following 2-mL solutions added to 15 mg of
      hyperbaric bupivacaine: 1) sterile saline, 2) morphine (250 microg), 3) morphine 
      (250 microg) with clonidine (25 microg), and 4) morphine (250 microg) with
      clonidine (75 microg). At 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 h postoperatively, we measured
      visual analog scales (VAS), cumulative IV morphine consumption, hemodynamics,
      nausea, ancillary drugs, and side effects. Our primary comparison was between the
      clonidine with morphine groups versus the morphine group. We found that the
      combined administration of intrathecal clonidine and morphine decreased 24 h IV
      morphine consumption by 13 mg (P = 0.028) when compared with intrathecal morphine
      alone. This corresponded to a decrease in the VAS score of 1.3 cm at 24 h
      postoperatively (P = 0.047). Adverse side effects were similar among all groups
      with the exception of more relative hypotension in the clonidine groups through
      postoperative hour 6. We conclude that the coadministration of intrathecal
      clonidine and morphine decreases the 24-h IV morphine consumption and improves
      the 24-h VAS score when compared with intrathecal morphine alone. IMPLICATIONS:
      In this prospective, randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled trial, we
      identify an effective postoperative analgesic approach in total knee replacement 
      surgery. Intrathecal morphine (250 microg) combined with clonidine (25 or 75
      microg) provided superior analgesia compared with intrathecal morphine alone.

TI  - Nizatidine for prevention of weight gain with olanzapine: a double-blind
      placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 81-5
AB  - Weight gain is associated with treatment with olanzapine and other psychotropic
      agents. Nizatidine, a histamine H-2 receptor antagonist, has been proposed to
      have weight-reducing effects. This double-blind trial evaluated the efficacy of
      nizatidine in limiting weight gain in patients with schizophrenia and related
      disorders who were treated with olanzapine for up to 16 weeks. After an initial
      screening period, 175 patients were randomized to receive olanzapine (5-20 mg)
      with either placebo or nizatidine (150 mg b.i.d. or 300 mg b.i.d.). Significantly
      less weight gain was observed on average at weeks 3 and 4 with
      olanzapine+nizatidine 300 mg b.i.d. (P<0.05) compared to olanzapine+placebo, but 
      the difference was not statistically significant at 16 weeks. Nizatidine was
      well-tolerated and did not adversely affect clinical outcomes. Nizatidine 300 mg 
      b.i.d. may have an early transient effect in limiting the weight gain, but this
      potential early effect appeared to be diminished or eliminated by 16 weeks.

TI  - What are the effects of antipsychotics on sexual dysfunctions and endocrine
      functioning?
PG  - 109-23
AB  - The literature is reviewed and preliminary results of new studies are presented
      showing that treatment with classical antipsychotics, as well as risperidone,
      induces sexual dysfunctions in 30-60% of the patients. These antipsychotics also 
      frequently induce amenorrhoea and galactorrhoea. Although comparative studies are
      rare, it is likely that prolactin-sparing antipsychotics, as recently shown in a 
      randomized trial of olanzapine versus risperidone, induce less sexual side
      effects.From these studies, it becomes apparent that prolactin elevation induced 
      by classical antipsychotics and risperidone is probably a factor in inducing
      sexual dysfunctions, amenorrhoea and galactorrhoea. The role of other factors
      inducing sexual dysfunctions like sedation, proportional, variant -blockade,
      testosterone, dopamine, and serotonin is discussed. Finally, it is concluded that
      sexual and hormonal effects of antipsychotics, although clearly important, are
      often neglected in research as in clinical practice. Lowering the dosage or
      switching to a prolactin-sparing antipsychotic often reduces sexual side effects,
      amenorrhoea, and galactorrhoea.

TI  - Management of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder--use of an effective
      paradigm.
PG  - 376-80
AB  - The management of ADHD poses a great problem before the psychologists,
      psychiatrists and different behavioural scientists. The multi-model approach,
      combining pharmacologic with different non-pharmacologic interventions, is more
      effective than any form of therapy. In the present study the theta feedback, a
      non-pharmacologic technique, has shown beneficial role among the low medicated
      ADHD cases. The present study also signifies the role of multi-model intervention
      in the management of ADHD.

TI  - Low-dose risperidone as adjunctive therapy for irritable aggression in
      posttraumatic stress disorder.
PG  - 193-6
AB  - Increased aggressive behavior can occur in association with posttraumatic stress 
      disorder (PTSD). This study tested the hypothesis that low-dose risperidone
      reduces aggression and other PTSD-related symptoms in combat veterans. Subjects
      were male combat veterans with PTSD who scored 20 or higher on cluster D
      (hyperarousal) of the Patient Checklist for PTSD-Military Version (PCL-M).
      Subjects were randomly assigned to either risperidone or placebo treatment
      groups. Drugs were administered over a 6-week treatment period in a double-blind 
      manner. Subjects received either risperidone (0.5 mg/day; n = 7) or matched
      placebo (n = 8) tablets during the first 2 weeks of the treatment period. The
      dose of risperidone could then be increased up to 2.0 mg/day on the basis of
      response. Prerandomization psychotropic regimens were continued. Subjects were
      evaluated with the PCL-M and the Overt Aggression Scale-Modified for Outpatients 
      (OAS-M). In comparison with placebo treatment, reductions in scores between
      baseline and the last week of treatment were significantly greater for OAS-M
      irritability and PCL-M cluster B (intrusive thoughts) subscales and on the PCL-M 
      total scale. These results suggest that low-dose risperidone administration
      reduces irritability and intrusive thoughts in combat-related PTSD.

TI  - A randomized placebo-controlled trial of risperidone for the treatment of
      aggression, agitation, and psychosis of dementia.
PG  - 134-43
AB  - BACKGROUND: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial examined the 
      efficacy and safety of risperidone in the treatment of aggression, agitation, and
      psychosis in elderly nursing-home patients with dementia. METHOD: Elderly
      patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of dementia of the Alzheimer's type, vascular
      dementia, or a combination of the 2 (i.e., mixed dementia) and significant
      aggressive behaviors were randomized to receive, for a period of 12 weeks, a
      flexible dose of either placebo or risperidone solution up to a maximum of 2
      mg/day. Outcome measures were the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), the
      Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease (BEHAVE-AD) rating scale, and the
      Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) and of Change (CGI-C) scales.
      RESULTS: A total of 345 patients were randomized to treatment with risperidone or
      placebo, and 337 patients received at least one dose of study drug. The trial was
      completed by 67% of patients in the placebo group and 73% of patients in the
      risperidone group. The mean +/- SE dose of risperidone was 0.95 +/- 0.03 mg/day. 
      The primary endpoint of the study, the difference from baseline to endpoint in
      CMAI total aggression score, showed a significant reduction in aggressive
      behavior for risperidone versus placebo (p <.001). A similar improvement was also
      seen for the CMAI total non-aggression subscale (p <.002) and for the BEHAVE-AD
      total (p <.001) and psychotic symptoms subscale (p =.004). At endpoint, the CGI-S
      and the CGI-C scores indicated a significantly greater improvement with
      risperidone compared with placebo (p <.001). Overall, 94% and 92% of the
      risperidone and placebo groups, respectively, reported at least 1 adverse event. 
      Somnolence and urinary tract infection were more common with risperidone
      treatment, whereas agitation was more common with placebo. There was no
      significant difference in the number of patients who reported extrapyramidal
      symptoms between the risperidone (23%) and placebo (16%) groups. CONCLUSION:
      Treatment with low-dose (mean = 0.95 mg/day) risperidone resulted in significant 
      improvement in aggression, agitation, and psychosis associated with dementia.

TI  - Treatment of weight gain with fluoxetine in olanzapine-treated schizophrenic
      outpatients.
PG  - 527-9
AB  - Significant weight gain is a side effect associated with olanzapine treatment in 
      some patients. We investigated the efficacy of high-dose fluoxetine as a
      weight-reducing agent for patients who develop early weight gain with olanzapine 
      treatment. Patients that gained >/=3% of their baseline weight in the initial 8
      weeks of olanzapine treatment (n=31) were randomized to double-blind treatment
      with placebo or fluoxetine (60 mg/day). Clinical, weight, and weight-related
      measures were assessed. Fluoxetine failed to demonstrate weight-reducing effects 
      (fluoxetine group: baseline mean 80.5 kg, SD=19.1, last mean=83.5 kg, SD=19.8;
      placebo group: baseline mean=77.1 kg, SD=12.1, last mean=78.8 kg, SD=10.6; F=1.3;
      df=1, 18; p=0.3). There were no differential effects in psychopathology,
      extrapyramidal side effects or weight-related measures between the placebo and
      fluoxetine groups. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors are probably not a practical
      option to counteract weight gain induced by atypical antipsychotics.
      Atypical-induced weight gain may result from mechanisms other than 5HT reuptake
      blockade.

TI  - Randomized trial of modafinil for treating subjective daytime sleepiness in
      patients with Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 287-93
AB  - We assessed the safety and efficacy of modafinil for the treatment of excessive
      daytime sleepiness in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). This was a
      single-site, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of 21
      PD patients having an Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score > or =10. They
      received either placebo or modafinil 200 mg/day for 3 weeks, followed by a
      washout week, then the alternate treatment for 3 weeks. The ESS data demonstrated
      a carryover effect, so the changes from baseline ESS scores were compared between
      the two treatments for period 1 only. The ESS scores for the placebo group went
      from 16.0 +/- 4.2 (mean +/- SD) to 17.0 +/- 5.1 and for the modafinil group went 
      from 17.8 +/- 4.2 to 14.4 +/- 5.7 (P = 0.039). There was no significant carryover
      effect for any other measure. The patient Clinical Global Impression of Change
      (+3 to -3) improved by 0.75 on modafinil compared with 0.15 for placebo (P =
      0.07). A total of 7 of 20 (35%) of the patients reported some improvement on
      modafinil but not placebo. There was no significant improvement or worsening of
      the UPDRS subscores I-III, Timed Tap test, or time on. Vital signs,
      electrocardiograms, and lab tests were unchanged. Modafinil was very well
      tolerated. Our data demonstrate that, in a small sample size, administration of
      200 mg/day of modafinil was associated with few side effects and was modestly
      effective for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with PD.

TI  - Neuropsychiatric effects of cardiovascular drug therapy.
PG  - 73-93
AB  - Various cardiovascular drugs have been shown to have neuropsychiatric effects
      that can be harmful or therapeutically beneficial to patients. As an example,
      both sedation and mental depression have been described in patients receiving
      centrally acting antihypertensive drugs and beta-adrenergic blockers, related to 
      their antiadrenergic actions. In contrast, because of these antiadrenergic
      actions, agents like clonidine have been used to treat opiate, alcohol, and
      nicotine withdrawal, while beta blockers have been used to treat symptoms of
      performance anxiety, migraine, and psychocardiac disorders. Some antiarrhythmic
      drugs have been associated with delirium, and digitalis toxicity has been shown
      to cause hallucinations, mania, euphoria, and depression. The calcium-channel
      blocker verapamil has been used as an adjunctive treatment in patients with
      bipolar disorders. Since neuropsychiatric symptoms are seen in patients with
      cardiovascular disease, clinicians should be aware of the possible relationship
      between these symptoms and concurrent cardiovascular drug therapy.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic and safety assessments of concurrent administration of
      risperidone and donepezil.
PG  - 180-6
AB  - Treatment of Alzheimer's disease sometimes uses combinations of drugs because
      dementia is frequently associated with behavioral symptoms. Risperidone and
      donepezil are both metabolized through cytochrome P450 2D6 and 3A4, raising the
      possibility of drug interactions with combination therapy. The objective of this 
      study was to determine whether significant drug interactions occur with
      concomitant administration of donepezil and risperidone. In an open-label,
      three-way crossover study, 24 healthy men were randomly assigned to receive 0.5
      mg of risperidone twice daily, 5 mg of donepezil once daily, or both drugs for 14
      consecutive days, followed by a 21-day washout period. The treatment ratios of
      AUC and associated 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for risperidone active moiety, 
      defined as risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone (ratio = 110.2%; 90% CI =
      103.7-117.2), and for donepezil (ratio = 97.1%; 90% CI = 90.0-103.6) were within 
      the 80% to 125% of bioequivalence range. The treatment ratios of Cmax and
      associated 90% CIs for risperidone active moiety (ratio = 114.6%; 90% CI =
      107.0-122.8) and for donepezil (ratio = 96.1%; 90% CI = 90.0-102.6) were also
      within the bioequivalence range. Therefore, no significant pharmacokinetic
      differences occurred in either risperidone active moiety or donepezil when given 
      alone or in combination. Adverse events (predominantly headache, nervousness, and
      somnolence) were minor and comparable for all treatment groups. The results
      indicate that no clinically meaningful drug interactions occurred between
      risperidone 1 mg daily and donepezil 5 mg daily at steady state, and therefore no
      dosage adjustment is required when both drugs are combined with the dosage
      regimen studied. Additional investigations are warranted to determine the
      potential for interactions in elderly patients with dementia who may eliminate
      risperidone and donepezil more slowly and thus be more vulnerable to clinical

TI  - Switching patients to aripiprazole from other antipsychotic agents: a multicenter
      randomized study.
PG  - 391-9
AB  - RATIONALE: Switching patients from one antipsychotic to another can lead to
      tolerability problems or transient symptom exacerbations. It is important to
      compare switching strategies to determine which methods produce the best possible
      patient outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability
      of three dosing strategies for switching chronic, stable patients with
      schizophrenia from current oral antipsychotic monotherapy to once-daily oral
      aripiprazole monotherapy. METHOD: Patients in this 8-week, open-label, outpatient
      study were randomized to: 1). immediate initiation of 30 mg/day aripiprazole with
      simultaneous immediate discontinuation of current antipsychotic; 2). immediate
      initiation of 30 mg/day aripiprazole while tapering off current antipsychotic
      over 2 weeks; or 3). up-titrating aripiprazole to 30 mg/day over 2 weeks, while
      simultaneously tapering off current antipsychotic. Efficacy assessments included 
      PANSS, CGI-S, and CGI-I scores. Safety assessments included: adverse events (AEs)
      recording, evaluation of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), vital signs, ECG, and
      clinical laboratory tests. RESULTS: Efficacy with aripiprazole was maintained
      during the study with numerical improvements compared with baseline in all three 
      groups. The overall incidence of AEs was broadly comparable across all groups,
      and AEs were generally mild to moderate in severity and time-limited.
      Discontinuations due to AEs were comparable across the groups. No deterioration
      in EPS occurred in any group. The reduction in body weight and plasma prolactin
      levels following switch to aripiprazole were comparable across the three groups. 
      CONCLUSION: Any of the three strategies evaluated can be used safely for
      switching patients to aripiprazole from antipsychotic monotherapy. Furthermore,
      patients' symptoms may continue to improve after switching to aripiprazole.

TI  - Intramuscular preparations of antipsychotics: uses and relevance in clinical
      practice.
PG  - 493-512
AB  - Intramuscular formulations of antipsychotics can be sub-divided into two groups
      on the basis of their pharmacokinetic features: short-acting preparations and
      long-acting or depot preparations. Short-acting intramuscular formulations are
      used to manage acute psychotic episodes. On the other hand, long-acting
      compounds, also called "depot", are administered as antipsychotic maintenance
      treatment to ensure compliance and to eliminate bioavailability problems related 
      to absorption and first pass metabolism. Adverse effects of antipsychotics have
      been studied with particular respect to oral versus short- and long-acting
      intramuscular formulations of the different compounds. For short-term
      intramuscular preparations the main risk with classical compounds are hypotension
      and extrapyramidal side effects (EPS). Data on the incidence of EPS with depot
      formulations are controversial: some studies point out that the incidence of EPS 
      is significantly higher in patients receiving depot preparations, whereas others 
      show no difference between oral and depot antipsychotics. Studies on the
      strategies for switching patients from oral to depot treatment suggest that this 
      procedure is reasonably well tolerated, so that in clinical practice depot
      antipsychotic therapy is usually begun while the oral treatment is still being
      administered, with gradual tapering of the oral dose. Efficacy, pharmacodynamics 
      and clinical pharmacokinetics of haloperidol decanoate, fluphenazine enanthate
      and decanoate, clopenthixol decanoate, zuclopenthixol decanoate and acutard,
      flupenthixol decanoate, perphenazine enanthate, pipothiazine palmitate and
      undecylenate, and fluspirilene are reviewed. In addition, the intramuscular
      preparations of atypical antipsychotics and clinical uses are reviewed.
      Olanzapine and ziprasidone are available only as short-acting preparations, while
      risperidone is to date the only novel antipsychotic available as depot
      formulation. To date, acutely ill, agitated psychotic patients have been treated 
      with high parenteral doses of typical antipsychotics, which often cause serious
      EPS, especially dystonic reactions. Intramuscular formulations of novel
      antipsychotics (olanzapine and ziprasidone), which appear to have a better
      tolerability profile than typical compounds, showed an equivalent efficacy to
      parenteral typical agents in the acute treatment of psychoses. However,
      parenteral or depot formulations of atypical antipsychotics are not yet widely
      available.

TI  - The effect of spinal bupivacaine in combination with either epidural clonidine
      and/or 0.5% bupivacaine administered at the incision site on postoperative
      outcome in patients undergoing lumbar laminectomy.
PG  - 874-80, table of contents
AB  - Spinal anesthesia has numerous advantages over general anesthesia for patients
      undergoing lumbar laminectomy and microdisk surgery. In this study, we evaluated 
      the addition of epidural clonidine and/or bupivacaine, injected at the incision
      site, on postoperative outcome variables in patients undergoing lower spine
      procedures using spinal anesthesia. One hundred twenty patients having lumbar
      spine surgery received bupivacaine spinal anesthesia supplemented by 150 microg
      of epidural clonidine with or without incisional bupivacaine, epidural placebo
      plus incisional bupivacaine, or placebo with incisional saline. Demographic data,
      intraoperative hemodynamics, blood loss, pain, nausea, urinary retention,
      hospital discharge, and other variables were compared by using either analysis of
      variance or chi(2) analysis. Demographics were similar. IV fluids, blood loss,
      incidence of intraoperative bradycardia, and hypotension were not different among
      groups. Postanesthesia care unit pain scores were lower and demand for analgesics
      was less in patients who received both the clonidine and subcutaneous
      bupivacaine. Patients who received epidural clonidine also had improved
      postoperative hemodynamics. Hospital discharge, urinary retention, and other
      variables were not different. We conclude that epidural clonidine as a supplement
      to spinal anesthesia produced no perioperative complications and improved
      postoperative pain and hemodynamic stability in patients undergoing lower spine
      procedures. IMPLICATIONS: Spinal anesthesia with supplemental epidural clonidine 
      in combination with incision site subcutaneous bupivacaine was evaluated both
      intra- and postoperatively and compared with spinal anesthesia alone for lower
      lumbar spine procedures. Both epidural clonidine and subcutaneous incisional
      bupivacaine, added to spinal anesthesia for lumbar spine surgery, improves pain
      relief and reduces the need for postoperative opioids with their associated side 
      effects.

TI  - The effect of methylphenidate on three forms of response inhibition in boys with 
      AD/HD.
PG  - 105-20
AB  - The current study was aimed at (a) investigating the effect of three doses
      methylphenidate (MPH) and placebo on inhibition of a prepotent response,
      inhibition of an ongoing response, and interference control in Attention
      Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD), and (b) studying dose-response relations 
      for the three forms of response inhibition. To meet these aims, the following
      tasks were selected: two versions of the Stop Paradigm for inhibition of a
      prepotent response, a Circle Tracing Task and a recently developed Follow Task
      for inhibition of an ongoing response, and the Stroop Color-Word Test and an
      Eriksen Flanker Task for interference control. These tasks were administered to
      23 boys with AD/HD during four treatment conditions: 5 mg MPH, 10 mg MPH, 20 mg
      MPH, and placebo. A pseudorandomized, multiple-blind, placebo-controlled,
      within-subject design was used. As hypothesized, inhibitory control in children
      with AD/HD improved under MPH compared to placebo. However, this effect was only 
      significant for inhibition of a prepotent response and inhibition of an ongoing
      response (as measured by the Follow Task), but not for interference control. The 
      relation between treatment condition and response was linear. However, this
      linear relation was due to improved inhibitory control under MPH compared to
      placebo, because no effects of MPH dose were observed for any of the response
      inhibition measures.

TI  - Efficacy of methylphenidate in patients with cerebral palsy and attention-deficit
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
PG  - 863-6
AB  - Our objective was to study the short-term efficacy and safety of methylphenidate 
      in patients with the dual diagnosis of cerebral palsy and attention-deficit
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Twenty-nine patients (8.0 +/- 4.0 years old) with 
      cerebral palsy and ADHD completed the study. In a prospective, crossover,
      double-blind paradigm, patients were treated with methylphenidate or placebo,
      each for 4 weeks. Parents and teachers completed a modified Abbreviated Conners' 
      Rating Scale at the beginning of the study and the end of the first and second
      months of treatment with methylphenidate or placebo. Parents were contacted
      weekly to report side effects. Methylphenidate treatment, as assessed by
      teachers' ratings, resulted in a significant improvement in ADHD symptomatology
      (t = 2.29, df = 27, P < .05); however, a trend for improvement was noted only on 
      the parents' ratings. After the conclusion of the study, 12 patients continued
      methylphenidate for 20 +/- 10 months. Side effects were minimal, with the
      exception of transient hallucinations in one patient. In children with cerebral
      palsy and ADHD, methylphenidate is effective, rendering it a valuable adjunct to 
      their overall medical therapy.

TI  - Self-administered psychosocial treatments for children and families.
PG  - 321-39
AB  - Self-administered psychosocial treatments for child health problems have the
      potential to circumvent barriers to traditional models of care. They are
      convenient and inexpensive to families and, for some types of problems, may be as
      effective as therapist-based care. In a review of past research on child- and
      parent-facilitated self-administered treatments, it was found that a stronger
      evidence base exists in support of some formats (manual- and multimedia-based
      treatments) than for others (inspirational literature and support groups). The
      practical, ethical, and legal issues associated with self-administered treatments
      are discussed as well as avenues for future research. How psychologists and
      health care systems respond to the opportunities associated with
      self-administered treatments for children will likely affect the face of the
      profession and the health of children in the future.

TI  - Development of a new once-a-day formulation of methylphenidate for the treatment 
      of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: proof-of-concept and
      proof-of-product studies.
PG  - 204-11
AB  - BACKGROUND: The duration of action of the immediate-release formulation of
      methylphenidate hydrochloride is short (3 to 4 hours), and 3 times daily dosing
      is thought to maximize effectiveness across a 12-hour day. The initial
      sustained-release formulations of methylphenidate had reduced efficacy compared
      with immediate-release methylphenidate and were not well accepted. Tachyphylaxis 
      was hypothesized to account for the reduced effects, and an ascending drug
      delivery pattern was proposed to overcome this acute tolerance. METHODS: Children
      with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder were evaluated in a laboratory
      school to characterize onset and duration of the effect of a variety of
      methylphenidate regimens. In a proof-of-concept study, an experimental ascending 
      profile was established by an initial bolus followed by small increasing doses of
      immediate-release methylphenidate in capsules administered every 30 minutes for 8
      hours. Two proof-of-product studies of a new oral once-a-day formulation to
      deliver methylphenidate by an osmotic pump process based on OROS (ALZA Corp,
      Mountain View, Calif) technology (hereafter referred to "OROS-methylphenidate")
      were conducted: a pharmacokinetic study and a pharmacodynamic study. RESULTS: The
      experimental ascending profile matched the effect of the standard regimen of
      methylphenidate, 3 times daily. In the pharmacokinetic study,
      OROS-methylphenidate treatment produced a rapid rise followed by increasing
      plasma concentrations that peaked 7 to 9 hours after administration. In the
      pharmacodynamic study, OROS-methylphenidate treatment matched the 3 times daily
      dosing of methylphenidate for onset and duration of efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      studies demonstrate the translation of a basic science finding (acute tolerance
      to clinical doses of methylphenidate) into clinical application (the selection of
      a new drug delivery pattern for methylphenidate). This approach produced a new
      product (OROS-methylphenidate or Concerta), which proved to have the predicted
      rapid onset (with 1-2 hours) and long duration of efficacy (10-12 hours) after a 
      single administration in the morning.

TI  - Safety of dexamphetamine in acute ischemic stroke: a randomized, double-blind,
      controlled dose-escalation trial.
PG  - 475-81
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Amphetamine is reported to enhance recovery after
      experimental stroke, but results from the first few trials in humans are
      inconclusive. Limited information is available on treatment safety. This study
      intended to investigate the safety and tolerability of dexamphetamine in patients
      with acute cerebral ischemia. METHODS: Forty-five patients with cerebral ischemia
      were enrolled within 72 hours after onset of symptoms. Patients were randomized
      to 1 of 3 dose levels (2.5, 5, or 10 mg orally twice daily) or placebo for 5
      consecutive days. Adverse events, blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature,
      consciousness level, and functional outcome measures were followed up daily
      during treatment. Follow-ups were made at day 7 and 1 and 3 months after stroke. 
      RESULTS: Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures and heart rate increased 14 
      mm Hg, 8 mm Hg, and 9 bpm, respectively, with dexamphetamine treatment compared
      with placebo (P< or =0.01). There was no difference between dexamphetamine and
      placebo regarding adverse events, body temperature, or consciousness level.
      During treatment, there was a benefit of dexamphetamine in neurological and
      functional outcome (P<0.05), but differences were not maintained at follow-up.
      CONCLUSIONS: Overall, dexamphetamine was safe and well tolerated by patients with
      acute cerebral ischemia, but blood pressure and heart rate increased during
      treatment in comparison to placebo. These observations may be important in the
      future planning of amphetamine trials because changes in these variables have
      been observed to interfere with clinical outcome. The suggestions of improvement 
      in outcome must be confirmed in further studies.

TI  - Mood stabilisers plus risperidone or placebo in the treatment of acute mania.
      International, double-blind, randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 141-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few double-blind trials have examined the efficacy of a combination
      of a mood stabiliser and an atypical antipsychotic in acute mania. AIMS: To
      determine the efficacy of risperidone in combination with a mood stabiliser in
      acute mania. METHOD: Patients taking a mood stabiliser were randomised to 3
      weeks' treatment with risperidone (n=75) or placebo (n=76). RESULTS: Young Mania 
      Rating Scale (YMRS) scores improved rapidly with significantly greater reductions
      at week 1 in the risperidone group compared with the placebo group. At end-point 
      YMRS scores decreased by 14.5 and 10.3 points in the risperidone and placebo
      groups, respectively. Significant improvements v. placebo (P<0.05) were noted in 
      the risperidone group on several other clinically meaningful measures.
      Additionally, a post hoc analysis excluding carbamazepine-treated patients
      (plasma concentrations of risperidone active moiety were 40% lower in this group)
      revealed significantly greater reductions (P=0.047) in YMRS scores in the
      risperidone group than in the placebo group. Incidence of adverse events was
      similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Risperidone is superior to placebo when used
      in combination with lithium or divalproex in acute mania.

TI  - Attenuation of olanzapine-induced weight gain with reboxetine in patients with
      schizophrenia: a double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 297-302
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Since increased norepinephrine availability may account for the
      weight-reducing effect of appetite suppressants, the authors hypothesized that
      the addition of the selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor reboxetine may
      prevent or attenuate olanzapine-induced weight gain. METHOD: Twenty-six patients 
      hospitalized for first-episode DSM-IV schizophrenic disorder participated in the 
      study. In addition to 6 weeks of treatment with olanzapine, 10 mg/day, patients
      were randomly allocated in a double-blind design to receive either reboxetine, 4 
      mg/day, (N=13) or placebo (N=13). RESULTS: Ten patients in each group completed
      the 6-week trial. Patients given olanzapine and reboxetine demonstrated a
      significantly lower increase in body weight (mean=2.5 kg, SD=2.7) than those
      given olanzapine and placebo (mean=5.5 kg, SD=3.1). Significantly fewer patients 
      in the olanzapine/reboxetine group (N=2 of 10) than in the olanzapine/placebo
      group (N=7 of 10) gained at least 7% of their initial weight, the cutoff for
      clinically significant weight gain. The addition of reboxetine to olanzapine
      treatment was safe and well tolerated by the patients. A between-group difference
      in the reduction of Hamilton depression scale scores was seen that favored the
      olanzapine/reboxetine group (mean difference=-3.1, SD=1.25). CONCLUSIONS: The
      selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor reboxetine may reduce
      olanzapine-induced weight gain in schizophrenia patients, and activation of the
      adrenergic system may attenuate weight gain induced by atypical antipsychotic
      agents.

TI  - Changes in glucose and cholesterol levels in patients with schizophrenia treated 
      with typical or atypical antipsychotics.
PG  - 290-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The association of hyperglycemia and hypercholesterolemia with use of 
      atypical antipsychotics has been documented in case reports and uncontrolled
      studies. The authors' goal was to assess the effects of clozapine, olanzapine,
      risperidone, and haloperidol on glucose and cholesterol levels in hospitalized
      patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder during a randomized
      double-blind 14-week trial. METHOD: One hundred fifty-seven patients with
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were inpatients at four hospitals
      were originally included in the study. The 14-week trial consisted of an 8-week
      fixed-dose period and a 6-week variable-dose period. Planned assessments included
      fasting glucose and cholesterol, which were collected at baseline and at the end 
      of the 8-week period and the following 6-week period. RESULTS: One hundred eight 
      of the 157 patients provided blood samples at baseline and at least at one point 
      after random assignment to clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, or haloperidol
      during the treatment trial. Seven of these patients had diabetes; their glucose
      levels were >125 mg/dl at baseline. Data from 101 patients were used for
      statistical analyses. During the initial 8-week period there was an overall
      significant increase in mean glucose levels. There were significant increases in 
      glucose levels at the end of the 8-week fixed-dose period for patients given
      clozapine (N=27) and those given haloperidol (N=25). The olanzapine group showed 
      a significant increase of glucose levels at the end of the 6-week variable-dose
      period (N=22). Fourteen of the 101 patients developed abnormal glucose levels
      (>125 mg/dl) during the trial (six with clozapine, four with olanzapine, three
      with risperidone, and one with haloperidol). Cholesterol levels were increased at
      the end of the 8-week fixed-dose period for the patients given clozapine (N=27)
      and those given olanzapine (N=26); cholesterol levels were also increased at the 
      end of the 6-week variable-dose period for patients given olanzapine (N=22).
      CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective randomized trial, clozapine, olanzapine, and
      haloperidol were associated with an increase of plasma glucose level, and
      clozapine and olanzapine were associated with an increase in cholesterol levels. 
      The mean changes in glucose and cholesterol levels remained within clinically
      normal ranges, but approximately 14% of the patients developed abnormally high
      glucose levels during the course of their participation in the study.

TI  - The addition of droperidol or clonidine to epidural tramadol shortens onset time 
      and increases duration of postoperative analgesia.
PG  - 147-52
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare tramadol alone and the combinations of either
      tramadol-clonidine or tramadol-droperidol with regard to analgesic and adverse
      effects. METHODS: After Ethic's Committee approval and patient informed consent
      were obtained, epidural catheters were inserted preoperatively at the L(3-4)
      interspace in 90 ASA physical status I-II adult patients undergoing lower
      abdominal surgery. Anesthesia was standardized. Patients were randomly assigned
      to one of three groups. Group I (T) patients received tramadol 75 mg, Group II
      (TD) patients received tramadol 75 mg plus droperidol 2.5 mg, and Group III (TC) 
      patients received tramadol 75 mg plus clonidine 150 microg in a total volume of
      10 mL administered as a single epidural injection in the postanesthesia care
      unit. The onset time of analgesia and duration of analgesia, visual analogue pain
      scores, sedation, nausea scores, vital signs and side effects were recorded.
      RESULTS: Duration of analgesia was similar in both the TD and TC groups, and
      significantly longer than in the T group (P < 0.001). Group TC patients displayed
      a significant increase in sedation scores and decrease in blood pressure and
      heart rate when compared with other groups (P < 0.001). No adverse effects were
      observed in Group TD, while nausea scores were high in both the T and TC groups
      (P < 0.001). Pain score, respiration rate, and SpO(2) values were similar in all 
      study groups. CONCLUSION: We conclude that epidural tramadol in combination with 
      droperidol or clonidine prolongs the duration of analgesia; however, droperidol
      appears to be a better alternative when adverse effects and antiemetic properties
      are taken into consideration.

TI  - Quetiapine treatment in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder: an open
      trial of adjunctive therapy.
PG  - 15-20
AB  - In this 6-week, open-label trial, combat veterans meeting DSM-IV criteria for
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were treated with the atypical antipsychotic
      quetiapine. The starting dose was 25 mg at bedtime with subsequent titration
      based on tolerability and clinical response. Primary outcome was measured using
      the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS). Secondary assessments of efficacy
      included the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS), the Hamilton Rating
      Scale for Depression, and the Clinical Global Impression Scale. Safety and
      tolerability evaluations included neurologic ratings, vital signs, and assessment
      of treatment-emergent side effects. Eighteen of 20 patients enrolled in the study
      completed 6 weeks of open-label treatment. The dose range of quetiapine was 25 to
      300 mg daily, with an average of 100+/-70 mg/d. There was significant improvement
      in CAPS scores, from 89.8+/-15.7 to 67.5+/-21.0 (t=4.863, df=18, <0.005), and
      composite PANSS ratings from baseline to endpoint. General psychopathology
      (PANSS) and depressive symptoms (HRSD) were also reduced at the 6-week end point.
      There were no serious adverse events and no clinically significant changes in
      vital signs or neurologic ratings. This preliminary open trial suggests that
      quetiapine is well tolerated and may have efficacy in reducing PTSD symptoms in
      patients who have not had an adequate response other medications. Studies
      utilizing a randomized, controlled trial design and larger sample sizes are
      needed to better define the potential role of quetiapine and other atypical
      antipsychotics in the treatment of PTSD.

TI  - [Schizoaffective disorder: clinical symptoms and present-day approach to
      treatment].
PG  - 1057-65
AB  - During 20th century serious mental disorders were divided into two groups
      according symptomatology and course of disorder. Individuals with dominating
      disturbance of perception, thinking and cognition were basically diagnosed having
      schizophrenic. Individuals with mood disturbance were basically diagnosed having 
      affective disorders. However, there were patients who did not fit neatly into
      either category. In 1933 Jocob Kasanin introduced the term "schizoaffective
      psychosis". Scientific discussions involved the possibility that schizoaffective 
      disorder was conceptualized most accurately as following: a type of
      schizophrenia, a type of affective disorder, a unique disorder that was separate 
      from both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, an arbitrary categorization of
      clinical symptoms that marked a continuum between schizophrenia and affective
      illness, a heterogeneous collection of "interforms" between schizophrenia and
      affective disorders. However, diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder is included
      both in DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10. Schizoaffective disorder is listed in the category 
      "schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders". The differential diagnosis
      includes basically either schizophrenia or affective disorder. The
      epidemiological status of schizoaffective disorder is somewhat uncertain compared
      with schizophrenia because of dilemmas related to diagnosis and classification of
      the disorder. Treatment of schizoaffective disorder comprises psychotropic
      medication, supportive psychotherapy, social care, rehabilitation. The most
      important groups of psychotropic medications are: antipsychotics, antidepressants
      and mood stabilizers. Atypical antipsychotics are the first-line medication for
      schizoaffective disorder due to their pharmacological properties. In the case of 
      schizoaffective disorders combination of atypical antipsychotics with
      antidepressants seems to be useful. Novel antidepressants have priority for the
      combination mentioned above. Peculiarities of mechanism of action of
      antidepressant are important for combinations. Mood stabilizers seem to be useful
      for treatment of certain type of schizoaffective disorder as well.

TI  - An open study of olanzapine and fluoxetine for psychotic major depressive
      disorder: interim analyses.
PG  - 1164-70
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although atypical antipsychotic agents are commonly used in the
      treatment of psychotic depression, there are no published prospective studies on 
      their use in this condition. The aim of this study was to assess, by interim
      analyses, the efficacy of the atypical antipsychotic agent olanzapine in
      combination with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant agent 
      fluoxetine. METHOD: We enrolled 27 patients (17 women [63.0%] and 10 men [37.0%];
      mean +/- SD age: 41.2 +/- 14.7 years) with DSM-IV-defined major depressive
      disorder with psychotic features into an open trial of olanzapine, 5 to 20
      mg/day, plus fluoxetine, 20 to 80 mg/day. Patients were assessed at each visit
      with the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and both the psychotic and 
      mood modules of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders,
      Patient Edition. We are reporting the results of the first 6 weeks of treatment. 
      RESULTS: Twenty-two (81.5%) of the 27 enrolled patients completed the 6-week open
      trial, and 5 (18.5%) dropped out, with only 2 (7.4%) dropping out due to side
      effects. Of the 27 patients, 74.1% (N = 20) met criteria for melancholic
      features, 14.8% (N = 4) had delusions alone, 18.5% (N = 5) had hallucinations
      alone, and 66.7% (N = 18) reported both delusions and hallucinations. In
      addition, the overall rates of response for the intent-to-treat group were as
      follows: depression response rate, 66.7% (N = 18); psychosis response rate, 59.3%
      (N = 16); psychotic depression response rate, 55.6% (N = 15); and psychotic
      depression remission rate, 40.7% (N = 11). CONCLUSION: The combination of
      olanzapine and fluoxetine appears to be a promising, safe, and effective
      treatment for psychotic depression. Double-blind studies are needed to confirm
      this impression.

TI  - Efficacy of quetiapine and risperidone against depressive symptoms in outpatients
      with psychosis.
PG  - 1156-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: The treatment of psychotic symptoms in patients with mood disorders
      is a complex challenge. Antipsychotic medications in these individuals may be
      associated with extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), worsening of depression, and
      functional impairment. Atypical antipsychotics such as quetiapine and risperidone
      are associated with a decreased incidence of adverse events such as EPS. The
      objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of
      quetiapine and risperidone for the treatment of depressive symptoms in
      outpatients with psychosis. METHOD: In this 4-month, multicenter, open-label
      trial, patients were randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio of quetiapine to
      risperidone, and both drugs were flexibly dosed. Eligible patients had psychoses 
      and demonstrated 1 of several DSM-IV diagnoses, including schizoaffective
      disorder, bipolar I disorder, major depressive disorder, delusional disorder,
      Alzheimer's dementia, schizophreniform disorder, vascular dementia, and substance
      abuse dementia. Patients were classified as mood disordered if they had bipolar
      disorder, major depressive disorder, or schizoaffective disorder. Efficacy was
      assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and the Clinical Global
      Impressions scale. The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) was used to
      assess the level of depressive symptoms. The primary tolerability assessment was 
      presence or absence of substantial EPS, defined as EPS severe enough to require
      an alteration in treatment. RESULTS: A total of 554 patients were randomly
      assigned to quetiapine and 175 to risperidone. Mean doses at 16 weeks were 318 mg
      for quetiapine and 4.4 mg for risperidone. Although both agents produced
      improvements in mean HAM-D scores, quetiapine produced a greater improvement than
      risperidone in all patients (p =.0015). Within the mood-diagnosed population,
      incidences of both substantial EPS (p =.001) and at least moderate EPS (p =.0373)
      occurred significantly less frequently among patients taking quetiapine. For
      patients with non-mood diagnoses, incidences of substantial EPS were fewer for
      patients taking quetiapine than for those taking risperidone (p =.062); however, 
      this was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that
      quetiapine may be a useful agent in the management of depressive symptoms in
      patients with psychosis.

PG  - 1148-55
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compared the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of
      divalproex and olanzapine in the treatment of acute mania associated with bipolar
      disorder. METHOD: This randomized, 12-week, double-blind, parallel-group,
      multicenter study included DSM-IV-defined bipolar disorder type I patients
      hospitalized for acute mania and randomly assigned to treatment with divalproex
      or olanzapine. After an inpatient period of up to 21 days, subjects were followed
      as outpatients. Dose adjustment was permitted during the inpatient period.
      Efficacy was assessed using change from baseline in Mania Rating Scale (MRS)
      score to day 21; other efficacy measures included the Brief Psychiatric Rating
      Scale, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and the Clinical Global
      Impressions-Part I, Severity of Illness scale. The primary safety endpoint was
      change from baseline in weight. Other safety and tolerability endpoints included 
      spontaneous adverse event reporting and changes from baseline in laboratory
      measures and vital signs. RESULTS: 120 subjects (N = 63 divalproex, N = 57
      olanzapine) were randomly assigned to treatment. No significant differences
      between groups were found for any efficacy variable for change from baseline to
      day 21. Mean MRS score changes from baseline to day 21 were -14.8 for divalproex 
      and -17.2 for olanzapine (p =.210). A significantly (p <.05) greater proportion
      of olanzapine-treated subjects experienced somnolence, weight gain, edema,
      rhinitis, and speech disorder (slurred speech); no adverse events were
      significantly greater in the divalproex group. A number of laboratory measures
      also demonstrated significant treatment differences, but the clinical
      significance of many of these is uncertain. Mean body weight changes were
      significantly greater in the olanzapine group (+ 8.8 lb [+ 4.0 kg]) than the
      divalproex group (+ 5.5 lb [+ 2.5 kg], p <.050). One death occurred during the
      study (olanzapine group, diabetic ketoacidosis). CONCLUSION: No significant
      difference in efficacy was found between treatment groups. Divalproex was
      associated with a more favorable adverse event profile and significantly less
      weight gain than olanzapine.

TI  - The risk of diabetes during olanzapine use compared with risperidone use: a
      retrospective database analysis.
PG  - 1135-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relative risk of diabetes among patients undergoing risperidone
      treatment was compared with that of patients receiving olanzapine. METHOD: A
      cohort was formed of 33,946 patients with at least 1 prescription for either
      olanzapine (N = 19,153) or risperidone (N = 14,793) between January 1, 1997, and 
      December 31, 1999, recorded in the Regie de l'Assurance Maladie du Quebec
      database. Patients were excluded if clozapine was dispensed to them during the
      study period or if they were diagnosed with diabetes before beginning
      antipsychotic therapy. New diabetes diagnoses made after the first antipsychotic 
      prescription during the period were tabulated until December 31, 1999; censoring 
      occurred at this date or at the last service date, if there was no record of
      using services during the last 6 months of follow-up. Crude hazard ratio and
      proportional hazard analyses were carried out. RESULTS: 319 patients developed
      diabetes on olanzapine treatment, and 217 developed diabetes on risperidone
      treatment; a crude hazard ratio of 1.08 (95% CI = 0.89 to 1.31, p =.43) was
      determined. When age, gender, and haloperidol use were controlled for using
      proportional hazard analysis, there was a 20% increased risk of diabetes with
      olanzapine relative to risperidone (95% CI = 0% to 43%, p =.05). Proportional
      hazard analyses adjusted for duration of olanzapine exposure indicated that the
      first 3 months of olanzapine treatment was associated with an increased risk of
      diabetes of 90% (95% CI = 40% to 157%, p <.0001), after adjusting for age,
      gender, and haloperidol use. CONCLUSION: Compared with risperidone, olanzapine
      was associated with an increased risk of developing diabetes. More studies are
      required to further investigate this association.

TI  - Bupropion for the treatment of tobacco dependence: guidelines for balancing risks
      and benefits.
PG  - 71-83
AB  - Tobacco use, particularly cigarette smoking, is now a global pandemic. The
      expected morbidity and mortality from smoking-attributable diseases will continue
      to rise for the next 30 years. In order to reduce this negative impact on
      worldwide health, effective therapy to aid smoking cessation must be provided to 
      current smokers. Treatment for tobacco dependence involves the combination of
      behavioural therapies and pharmacological treatment. The most common
      pharmacological treatments include nicotine replacement therapy and non-nicotine 
      medications, including antidepressants. The antidepressant with the greatest
      weight of evidence for efficacy in the treatment of tobacco dependence is
      bupropion. Sustained-release bupropion is approved for the treatment of tobacco
      dependence in over 50 countries worldwide. The efficacy of bupropion for the
      treatment of tobacco dependence is attributed to the blockage of dopamine
      reuptake in the mesolimbic dopaminergic system. This area of the brain is
      believed to mediate reward for nicotine use and for other drugs of dependence.
      Randomised, controlled clinical trials have shown that bupropion approximately
      doubles abstinence rates compared with placebo. In addition, long-term treatment 
      with bupropion may reduce or delay smoking relapse. Bupropion also appears to be 
      effective in the treatment of smokers who have recently relapsed and smokers with
      other comorbid psychiatric conditions. Bupropion has a good adverse events
      profile, but the risk exists for serious adverse effects such as seizures. Recent
      postmarketing surveillance reports have raised safety concerns about bupropion,
      although no causal relationship between bupropion and the reported serious
      adverse events or death has been established.

TI  - Does stimulant therapy of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder beget later
      substance abuse? A meta-analytic review of the literature.
PG  - 179-85
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Concerns exist that stimulant therapy of youths with
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may result in an increased risk
      for subsequent substance use disorders (SUD). We investigated all long-term
      studies in which pharmacologically treated and untreated youths with ADHD were
      examined for later SUD outcomes. METHODS: A search of all available prospective
      and retrospective studies of children, adolescents, and adults with ADHD that had
      information relating childhood exposure to stimulant therapy and later SUD
      outcome in adolescence or adulthood was conducted through PubMed supplemented
      with data from scientific presentations. Meta-analysis was used to evaluate the
      relationship between stimulant therapy and subsequent SUD in youths with ADHD in 
      general while addressing specifically differential effects on alcohol use
      disorders or drug use disorders and the potential effects of covariates. RESULTS:
      Six studies--2 with follow-up in adolescence and 4 in young adulthood--were
      included and comprised 674 medicated subjects and 360 unmedicated subjects who
      were followed at least 4 years. The pooled estimate of the odds ratio indicated a
      1.9-fold reduction in risk for SUD in youths who were treated with stimulants
      compared with youths who did not receive pharmacotherapy for ADHD (z = 2.1; 95%
      confidence interval for odds ratio [OR]: 1.1-3.6). We found similar reductions in
      risk for later drug and alcohol use disorders (z = 1.1). Studies that reported
      follow-up into adolescence showed a greater protective effect on the development 
      of SUD (OR: 5.8) than studies that followed subjects into adulthood (OR: 1.4).
      Additional analyses showed that the results could not be accounted for by any
      single study or by publication bias. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that
      stimulant therapy in childhood is associated with a reduction in the risk for
      subsequent drug and alcohol use disorders.

TI  - Does the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder with stimulants
      contribute to drug use/abuse? A 13-year prospective study.
PG  - 97-109
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of stimulant treatment during childhood and high
      school on risk for substance use, dependence, and abuse by young adulthood.
      METHODS: A total of 147 clinic-referred hyperactive children were followed
      approximately 13 years into adulthood (mean: 21 years old; range: 19-25). At
      adolescent (age 15) and adult follow-up, probands were interviewed about their
      use of various substances and duration of stimulant treatment. RESULTS: Duration 
      of stimulant treatment was not significantly associated with frequency of any
      form of drug use by young adulthood. Stimulant-treated children had no greater
      risk of ever trying drugs by adolescence or any significantly greater frequency
      of drug use by young adulthood. Stimulant treatment in high school also did not
      influence drug use in adulthood except for greater use of cocaine. This
      difference was no longer significant after controlling for severity of
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and conduct disorder in childhood,
      adolescence, and adulthood. Stimulant treatment in either childhood or high
      school was not associated with any greater risk for any formal Diagnostic and
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition, Revised drug dependence or
      abuse disorders by adulthood. Treatment with stimulants did not increase the risk
      of ever having tried most illegal substances by adulthood except for cocaine.
      Subsequent analyses showed that this elevated risk was primarily mediated by
      severity of conduct disorder by young adulthood and not by stimulant treatment in
      childhood. CONCLUSION: This study concurs with 11 previous studies in finding no 
      compelling evidence that stimulant treatment of children with
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder leads to an increased risk for substance
      experimentation, use, dependence, or abuse by adulthood.

TI  - Placebo-controlled trials do not find association of olanzapine with exacerbation
      of bipolar mania.
PG  - 147-53
AB  - BACKGROUND: Published case reports describe apparent induction or exacerbation of
      manic-like symptoms during treatment with the atypical antipsychotics olanzapine 
      and risperidone. To date, such reports are from uncontrolled clinical experience 
      and therefore cannot clarify whether the atypical antipsychotics caused such
      manic-like states or simply failed to prevent them. Presumably, bipolar patients 
      would be at increased risk for this putative adverse event. Therefore, we
      evaluated the potential of olanzapine to exacerbate symptoms of mania compared to
      placebo during treatment of bipolar mania. METHODS: Two inpatient, double-blind, 
      randomized trials investigating the efficacy of olanzapine 5-20 mg daily versus
      placebo for the treatment of acute mania were combined. Two hundred and
      fifty-four subjects participated (placebo n=129; olanzapine n=125) in the two
      studies. Severity of mania was quantified with the 11-item Young-Mania Rating
      Scale (Y-MRS). In a post-hoc analysis, after double-blind therapy up to 3 weeks, 
      categorical comparison of olanzapine and placebo groups was made for any
      worsening and worsening by 10 or 20% from baseline Y-MRS scores (LOCF). RESULTS: 
      The percentage of subjects with exacerbation at endpoint were: any worsening,
      placebo 37.7%, olanzapine 21.8% (P=0.005); >or=10% worsening, placebo 24.6%,
      olanzapine 14.5% (P=0.039); >or=20% worsening, placebo 15.6%, olanzapine 8.1%
      (P=0.064). CONCLUSION: Mania rating scores worsened for some patients during
      olanzapine therapy. However, this was significantly less common with olanzapine
      than with placebo. These controlled data suggest that clinical case reports of
      occurrence of 'mania' during treatment with olanzapine, and possibly those with
      other atypical antipsychotics, reflect exacerbation in the natural history of
      bipolar illness, rather than an adverse pharmacological effect. LIMITATIONS:
      Post-hoc analysis of pooled data from two different studies.

TI  - The analgesic effect of interscalene block using clonidine as an analgesic for
      shoulder arthroscopy.
PG  - 260-2, table of contents
AB  - Used as the sole analgesic, clonidine produces analgesia after central neural
      blockade and intraarticular injection but not after axillary block. In this
      study, we sought to determine whether interscalene clonidine induces analgesia
      for shoulder arthroscopy. Forty patients scheduled for shoulder arthroscopy were 
      prospectively included in this double-blinded study. Using a nerve stimulator
      technique, an interscalene catheter was inserted. The patients were randomly
      divided into two groups. The interscalene group (n = 20) received clonidine 150
      micro g in 15 mL of saline through the catheter and 1 mL of subcutaneous saline, 
      and the systemic group (n = 20) received 15 mL of saline through the catheter and
      clonidine 150 micro g (1 mL) subcutaneously. All patients underwent general
      anesthesia for surgery. On completion of arthroscopy, all patients received, via 
      a patient-controlled analgesia, on demand a bolus of 8 mL of ropivacaine 0.2%
      through the catheter with a 1-h lockout period. Postoperative pain was measured
      every 4 h using the visual analog scale (VAS) for 24 h. Additional postoperative 
      analgesia was available with parenteral nalbuphine if required until VAS < 3. VAS
      scores in the recovery room were significantly higher in the systemic group
      compared with the interscalene group (P < 0.0001). Analgesic duration was
      significantly longer in the interscalene group (P < 0.00001), and ropivacaine
      consumption was significantly less than in the systemic group (P < 0.0001). No
      significant difference was observed between groups for nalbuphine consumption.
      Side effects were comparable in the two groups. IMPLICATIONS: Clonidine
      administered via an interscalene catheter enhanced analgesia compared with
      systemic administration. Nevertheless, the adverse effect of clonidine at this
      dose limits its use for routine management for postoperative analgesia.

TI  - Quetiapine is not associated with increase in prolactin secretion in contrast to 
      haloperidol.
PG  - 562-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Typical antipsychotic drugs frequently cause hyperprolactinemia and
      even galactorrhea. In addition, these side effects may result in noncompliance
      with antipsychotic treatment. Capacity to avoid hyperprolactinemia has been
      accepted as one atypical criterion. The aim of the present study was to compare
      effects of haloperidol, the most commonly used antipsychotic, and quetiapine, a
      novel antipsychotic agent used in Turkey, on serum prolactin (PRL) levels.
      METHODS: The study consisted of 35 females diagnosed with schizophrenia according
      to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4(th) ed. (DSM-IV).
      Thirty-five patients in a drug-free period for at least 2 weeks were included to 
      randomized quetiapine (n = 18) and haloperidol (n = 17) treatment group. All
      patients were assessed by Brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS), Positive and
      negative syndrome scale (PANSS), and Extrapyramidal symptoms rating scale (ESRS).
      PRL levels were measured both at the beginning and at the sixth week of the
      study. RESULTS: Both treatment groups exhibited significant improvements in
      clinical signs as evaluated by BPRS and PANSS. While there was no significant
      difference in PRL level between groups at the beginning of the study, control
      prolactin (PRL) levels were significantly lower in quetiapine compared to
      haloperidol group. While no quetiapine group patients exhibited galactorrhea, we 
      observed that two patients from the haloperidol group had galactorrhea related to
      hyperprolactinemia. CONCLUSIONS: The present study revealed that quetiapine is
      not associated with increase in PRL secretion in contrast to the conventional
      antipsychotic haloperidol.

TI  - Efficacy of newer generation antipsychotics in the treatment of schizophrenia.
PG  - 9-26
AB  - The advent of the newer 'atypical' antipsychotic medications has revolutionized
      the pharmacologic treatment of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. In
      contrast to the older conventional antipsychotic agents, atypical medications
      have a broader spectrum of efficacy (greater efficacy in negative, cognitive, and
      mood symptoms) and a lower risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and tardive
      dyskinesia. Due to concerns surrounding hematological safety and other adverse
      effects, clozapine is used principally in patients refractory to treatment with
      other antipsychotic agents. The other three universally available atypical agents
      (risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine) collectively constitute about 70% of
      all antipsychotic prescriptions in the USA. Despite the broad popularity of these
      medications and their rapid adoption in general clinical practice, there are
      limited data on how they compare to each other with regards to their overall
      efficacy and also as to their efficacy in specific symptom domains. To address
      this question, two separate analyses were undertaken. First, all published,
      short-term, randomized, controlled clinical trials of these agents in
      schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder were reviewed and the extent of
      improvement across these agents was compared. While the amount of improvement
      with a particular agent across its different studies varied, the average
      improvement was similar for the agents for all efficacy parameters considered.
      Secondly, all randomized, controlled clinical trials directly comparing two or
      more of these agents in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder
      were analyzed. Only three such trials (all industry sponsored) were identified;
      while there were differences in methodology and small differences in efficacy on 
      a minority of measures on which comparisons were undertaken, the preponderance of
      data suggested no differences in efficacy. While data thus far do not support
      assertions of differential efficacy between risperidone, olanzapine, and
      quetiapine, there are clear differences in their side-effect profiles and these
      are briefly summarized.

TI  - Efficacy of olanzapine in social anxiety disorder: a pilot study.
PG  - 365-8
AB  - Based on evidence suggesting anxiolytic properties of the atypical antipsychotic 
      olanzapine, this study was conducted to evaluate whether olanzapine may be
      efficacious in treating social anxiety disorder (SAD). This study was an 8-week, 
      double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of olanzapine as monotherapy in which
      12 patients with the DSM-IV diagnosis of SAD were randomized to either olanzapine
      (n = 7) or placebo (n = 5). An initial dose of 5 mg/day was titrated to a maximum
      of 20 mg/day. Baseline to endpoint scores from the Brief Social Phobia Scale
      (BSPS), Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN), Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale and
      Sheehan Disability Scale, as well as Clinical Global Impression-Improvement
      ratings, were compared for olanzapine versus placebo. Seven subjects completed
      all 8 weeks of the study, four in the olanzapine group and three in the placebo
      group. In the intent-to-treat analysis, olanzapine yielded greater improvement
      than placebo on the primary measures: BSPS (p = 0.02) and SPIN (p = 0.01). Both
      treatments were well tolerated, although the olanzapine group had more drowsiness
      and dry mouth. Olanzapine and placebo were both associated with negligible weight
      gain. Olanzapine was superior to placebo on the primary outcome measures in this 
      preliminary study of SAD. Additional studies of olanzapine as a treatment for SAD
      are warranted.

TI  - The potential cardiotoxicity of antipsychotic drugs as assessed by heart rate
      variability.
PG  - 355-60
AB  - Most antipsychotic drugs have cardiac effects as a consequence of their
      pharmacological actions. Recently, thioridazine has been subjected to a
      restricted indications notice and sertindole had its license withdrawn because of
      concerns about their potential cardiotoxicity. In the development of new atypical
      agents, heart-rate corrected QT effects are evaluated but it is unclear how
      predictive these are of clinically significant cardiotoxicity or sudden death.
      Heart rate variability (HRV) is a potential index of cardiotoxicity which has
      been found to be decreased following antidepressants and clozapine. We studied
      acute HRV changes following antipsychotic agents. Sixteen healthy male volunteers
      received risperidone (4 mg), olanzapine (10 mg), thioridazine (50 mg) or placebo 
      in a randomized cross-over design. Subjective effects and psychomotor function
      were assayed at 2 h and both linear (summary statistics) and non-linear
      (scatterplot) measures of HRV were evaluated by continuous electrocardiogram
      recording over 10 h. Differential effects of single doses of the three
      antipsychotic drugs on HRV were found, and these were independent of their
      sedative effects. Olanzapine increased, and thioridazine decreased HRV, while
      risperidone had no effect. HRV is sensitive to the acute effects of
      antipsychotics. It may prove to be a reliable index of their potential for
      cardiotoxicity. Further studies in both healthy volunteers and patients on
      antipsychotic medication will be valuable.

TI  - Modafinil reduces excessive somnolence and enhances mood in patients with
      myotonic dystrophy.
PG  - 1876-80
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential of modafinil in reducing excessive daytime
      somnolence (EDS) and enhancing indexes of quality of life and mood in patients
      with myotonic dystrophy (DM). METHODS: Forty patients with DM were randomized to 
      receive modafinil and placebo for 14 days each, using a double-blind, cross-over 
      design. Before and after each trial, subjects completed handgrip strength
      testing, spirometry, and quality-of-life measures (RAND). On days 7 and 14, each 
      subject completed the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), the Stanford Sleepiness
      Scale (SSS), and the Profile of Mood States (POMS). RESULTS: ESS scores were
      lower while taking modafinil (mean 248 mm; 95% confidence limit 220 to 276 mm) as
      compared with placebo (309 mm; 281 to 336 mm) (p < 0.001). Mean SSS scores were
      also lower during the modafinil trial (3.05; 2.77 to 3.33) than during the
      placebo trial (3.45; 3.18 to 3.71) (p < 0.05). The POMS indicated that modafinil 
      decreased fatigue-inertia (p < 0.001) and increased vigor-activity and
      tension-anxiety (p < 0.001) indexes. The total mood disturbance score was also
      decreased during the modafinil trial as compared with placebo (p < 0.05). The
      RAND quality-of-life measures of energy (p < 0.001) and health change (p < 0.05) 
      were both significantly enhanced during the modafinil treatment phase. No changes
      in maximal grip strength or forced expired volume in 1 second were detected over 
      the course of the study. Headache was the most frequently reported adverse event.
      Four patients withdrew from the study, three because of side effects (two during 
      modafinil ingestion and one during placebo ingestion). CONCLUSION: Modafinil
      reduces somnolence and improves mood in patients with DM.

TI  - Effect of divalproex combined with olanzapine or risperidone in patients with an 
      acute exacerbation of schizophrenia.
PG  - 182-92
AB  - This double-blind, randomized, multicenter study investigated the use of
      divalproex with an antipsychotic agent in patients hospitalized for acute
      exacerbation of schizophrenia. Patients (n = 249) who met DSM-IV criteria for
      schizophrenia were randomly assigned to receive olanzapine monotherapy,
      risperidone monotherapy, divalproex plus olanzapine, or divalproex plus
      risperidone for 28 days. Divalproex was initiated at 15 mg/kg/day and titrated
      over 12 days to a maximum dosage of 30 mg/kg/day. Olanzapine and risperidone,
      were, respectively, initiated at 5 and 2 mg/day and were titrated over the first 
      6 days to respective target fixed daily dosages of 15 and 6 mg/day. Improvements 
      from baseline were observed at all evaluation points throughout the 28-day
      treatment period in the two combination therapy and the two antipsychotic
      monotherapy groups, with statistically significant treatment differences favoring
      combination therapy as soon as day 3 for Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale
      (PANSS) total score, derived Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRSd) total score, 
      as well as PANSS and BPRSd subscales. These findings were confirmed in post hoc
      repeated-measures analyses of variance in which treatment differences favoring
      combination therapy were observed for PANSS total (p = 0.020) and PANSS positive 
      scale scores (p = 0.002). Both combination therapy and antipsychotic monotherapy 
      were well tolerated. Treatment with divalproex in combination with an atypical
      antipsychotic agent resulted in earlier improvements in a range of psychotic
      symptoms among acutely hospitalized patients with schizophrenia. Further
      evaluation is warranted to confirm these findings.

AB  - The superiority of olanzapine to haloperidol with respect to a decreased
      incidence of treatment-emergent extrapyramidal syndromes (EPS) in patients with
      schizophrenia was demonstrated in studies conducted in both Japan and Western
      countries. EPS measurements used in Western countries included the Simpson-Angus,
      Barnes akathisia and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale, while the
      Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptom Scale (DIEPSS) was used in Japan. The aim of 
      this study was to clarify how the DIEPSS captures EPS profiles. The baseline
      prevalence and treatment-emergent incidence of EPS in Japanese schizophrenic
      patients treated with olanzapine or haloperidol were retrospectively compared as 
      assessed by the DIEPSS to the prevalence and incidence of EPS in primarily
      Caucasian schizophrenic patients who were treated with olanzapine or haloperidol.
      Specifically, the prevalence and incidence of dyskinesia, akathisia and
      parkinsonism were compared between the Japanese trial and an international trial 
      to examine if appropriate definitions using the DIEPSS can be derived assuming
      that a comparable prevalence and incidence of the syndromes would be observed
      when any differences in residual antipsychotic exposure at the initiation of
      study treatment were accounted for. For the incidence of all EPS syndromes, odds 
      ratios were observed to be similar between the two studies, indicating that
      appropriate criteria for the clinical diagnosis of the EPS syndromes could be
      established based on the DIEPSS. This preliminary and retrospective work suggests
      that the DIEPSS can be used to operationally define the presence or absence, and 
      make the clinical diagnosis, of specific EPS syndromes.

TI  - Modafinil for the treatment of daytime sleepiness in Parkinson's disease: a
      double-blind, randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled polygraphic trial.
PG  - 905-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the therapeutic efficacy of modafinil in the treatment of
      increased daytime sleepiness in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). DESIGN:
      Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study with two 2-week
      treatment blocks, separated by a 2-week washout phase. SETTING: Tertiary
      Parkinson's disease care center and sleep laboratory at university hospital
      neurology department. PATIENTS: Fifteen patients with idiopathic PD and daytime
      sleepiness (Epworth sleepiness score (ESS) 10 or more). INTERVENTIONS:
      Administration of placebo or modafinil as a single morning dose in a randomized
      crossover order. The modafinil dose was 100 mg in the first, and 200 mg in the
      second treatment week. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: At baseline and at the end of
      each treatment block, sleepiness was evaluated using subjective (perceived
      sleepiness with the ESS) and objective measures (maintenance of wakefulness
      test). Twelve patients completed the study (9 male, 3 female; mean age 65.0 +/-
      7.6 years, mean disease duration 6.8 +/- 4.1 years). Epworth scores were
      significantly improved with modafinil (3.42 +/- 3.90) compared to placebo (0.83
      +/- 1.99; p = 0.011). Latency to sleep in the maintenance of wakefulness test was
      not significantly altered by modafinil treatment: 10.9 (3-40)/15.1 (2.5-40)
      minutes before/after placebo and 12 (2.6-40)/17.8 (4.2-40) minutes before/after
      modafinil (p = 0.139) [data given as mean +/- standard deviation or median
      (range)]. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that modafinil improves 
      daytime sleepiness in PD patients, at least on a subjective or behavioral level. 
      Modafinil treatment may be considered for EDS in PD patients, in whom otherwise
      treatable causes of Excessive Daytime Sleepiness (EDS) are absent.

TI  - Remifentanil-clonidine-propofol versus sufentanil-propofol anesthesia for
      coronary artery bypass surgery.
PG  - 703-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare a remifentanil-clonidine-propofol regimen with conventional
      sufentanil-propofol anesthesia. DESIGN: Randomized, nonblinded trial. SETTING: A 
      single university hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Male patients scheduled for coronary
      artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. INTERVENTIONS: In the control group,
      anesthesia was induced with 0.5 microg/kg of sufentanil and 0.2 to 0.3 mg/kg of
      etomidate after preoxygenation. Propofol (50 to 100 microg/kg/min) and sufentanil
      (0.5 to 1.0 microg/kg/h) were started after endotracheal intubation. Sufentanil
      was stopped after aortic decannulation. In the remifentanil-clonidine group,
      anesthesia was started with remifentanil (0.15 to 0.3 microg/kg/min), followed by
      etomidate (0.2 to 0.3 mg/kg). Propofol was started at 50 to 100 microg/kg/min,
      and after endotracheal intubation, clonidine infusion was started (6 to 20
      microg/h). Patients received piritramide (0.15 mg/kg) and metamizole (20 mg/kg)
      for transitional analgesia. In both groups, propofol infusion was reduced to 30
      to 60 microg/kg/min at skin closure and stopped when assisted spontaneous
      breathing led to adequate gas exchange. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The main
      outcomes were recovery times; somatic variables; plasma catecholamine levels; and
      self-recorded pain, nausea, and vomiting. Patients in the remifentanil-clonidine 
      group were extubated earlier and had lower plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine 
      levels. After transitional analgesia, the remifentanil-clonidine patients had
      similar postoperative analgesic use and self-reported pain and side-effect
      scores. CONCLUSION: Compared with a sufentanil-propofol regimen, an anesthetic
      regimen for CABG surgery that combines remifentanil, clonidine, and propofol
      provides similar hemodynamics. The remifentanil-clonidine regimen reduces
      catecholamine levels and hastens recovery from anesthesia.

PG  - 617-21
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of intrathecal clonidine in children. STUDY
      DESIGN: A prospective randomised study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 45 children, 6 to
      15 years old, were randomised in two groups; receiving either 0.5% hyperbaric
      bupivacaine or 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine added to clonidine 2 micrograms.kg-1. 
      We assessed quality and length of motor and sensory blocks and side effects of
      clonidine: hypotension, bradycardia and sedation. RESULTS: Clonidine was
      associated with prolongation of motor block. 190 +/- 42 min vs 150 +/- 35 min (p 
      < 0.01), but the difference was not significant. Postoperative analgesia was
      longer in clonidine group, 490 +/- 35 min vs 200 +/- 50 min (mean +/- SD), p <
      0.001. Clonidine was associated with higher incidence of hypotension 54 vs 36%
      and bradycardia 30 vs 0%. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that intrathecal
      clonidine 2 micrograms.kg-1 is associated with extending duration of
      postoperative analgesia but with moderate side effects.

TI  - Amisulpride vs. risperidone in chronic schizophrenia: results of a 6-month
      double-blind study.
PG  - 1071-81
AB  - This multicenter, double-blind, randomized study evaluated the efficacy, safety
      and functional effects of two atypical antipsychotics, amisulpride and
      risperidone, in patients with chronic schizophrenia (DSM IV) with a recent
      worsening of symptoms. It was planned as a non-inferiority trial. 309 patients
      received amisulpride (400-1,000 mg/day) or risperidone (4-10 mg/day) for six
      months. Amisulpride was demonstrated to be not inferior to risperidone with
      respect to the decrease in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total
      score from baseline (90% 2-sided confidence interval (-5.6; 4.0)). Symptomatic
      improvement measured with the Brief Psychiatry Rating Scale (BPRS), the PANSS
      positive subscale, and the Bech Rafaelsen Melancholia Scale was similar in both
      groups. Amisulpride was significantly (p <.05) superior to risperidone in terms
      of response (>/=50% improvement in PANSS and BPRS total scores or "very much/much
      improved" on the Clinical Global Impression Scale) and also demonstrated better
      functional effects and subjective response. Both treatments were well tolerated
      and had a similar low incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms; however, amisulpride 
      was associated with less weight gain and endocrine/sexual symptoms.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic and safety assessments of galantamine and risperidone after the
      two drugs are administered alone and together.
PG  - 1341-51
AB  - To explore the steady-state pharmacokinetic profile after coadministration of
      galantamine and risperidone, an open-label, randomized, single-center, two-way
      crossover drug-drug interaction study was conducted in 16 healthy elderly
      subjects, ages 60 years and older. The results showed that risperidone, when
      administered with galantamine, did not change the bioavailability of galantamine 
      at steady state. In addition, systemic exposure of risperidone active moiety
      (risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone), the most clinically relevant component
      of risperidone treatment, was not affected by galantamine coadministration, while
      systemic exposure was increased by approximately 10% for risperidone and
      decreased by about 10% for 9-hydroxyrisperidone (active metabolite of
      risperidone). Galantamine and risperidone were both safe and well tolerated
      administered either alone or together. Thus, no dose adjustment for either
      risperidone orgalantamine is necessary when these two drugs are administered
      together in the dose range evaluated.

TI  - An economic assessment of quetiapine and haloperidol in patients with
      schizophrenia only partially responsive to conventional antipsychotics.
PG  - 1648-67
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many patients with schizophrenia exhibit only a partial response to
      conventional antipsychotic agents, making them difficult to treat adequately.
      OBJECTIVE: This analysis models the cost-effectiveness of quetiapine compared
      with haloperidol in partial responders with schizophrenia. METHODS: Outcome data 
      from the Partial Responders International schiZophrenia Evaluation (PRIZE)
      clinical trial comparing quetiapine and haloperidol in partial responders with
      schizophrenia as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
      Disorders, Fourth Edition were combined with data from the literature to
      construct a Markov model. The model was used to calculate treatment outcomes and 
      total direct treatment costs from the perspective of the United Kingdom National 
      Health Service over 5 years. RESULTS: The PRIZE study showed that quetiapine
      treatment resulted in a higher response rate and better tolerability than
      haloperidol treatment. These benefits have the potential to improve compliance
      and reduce relapse rates. The model showed that the higher acquisition cost of
      quetiapine was offset by lower costs for other medications, hospitalization, and 
      other medical services. The total treatment cost over 5 years was 38,106 pounds
      for quetiapine and 38,350 pounds for haloperidol, a cost saving of 244 pounds in 
      favor of quetiapine. Quetiapine-treated patients also spent longer in response
      states and experienced fewer relapses. Sensitivity analysis showed these results 
      to be robust across a range of conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Quetiapine has the
      potential to improve outcomes compared with haloperidol in partial responders
      with schizophrenia, at a slightly lower total cost. The higher acquisition cost
      of quetiapine was offset by savings in other medical costs. Quetiapine could
      significantly improve the management of this patient group, without increasing
      the economic burden on the health service.

TI  - Olanzapine vs. haloperidol in the treatment of elderly chronic schizophrenia
      patients.
PG  - 1199-202
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Most of the data supporting the use of atypical antipsychotics (AA) is
      based on studies in young adult patients. The present study is an open-label
      naturalistic follow-up study of olanzapine treatment vs. haloperidol for elderly 
      chronic schizophrenia patients. MEHTOD: 20 patients (mean age 72.7+/-5.9 years,
      mean disease duration 33.1+/-12.0 years) who met the DSM-IV criteria for
      schizophrenia were randomly assigned to olanzapine (n=10) or haloperidol (n=10)
      treatment during acute exacerbation. Primary outcome measure was rating on the
      Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale and the Positive and Negative Symptom
      Scale (PANSS). RESULTS: Between-group differences were computed using analysis of
      covariance. PANSS Total score decreased from 84 at baseline to 65 after treatment
      with olanzapine while decreased only from 79 to 74 with haloperidol treatment (F=
      6.66, P=.02). PANSS Negative subscale decreased from 19 at baseline to 15 with
      olanzapine treatment while increased (deteriorated) from 18 to 20 with
      haloperidol treatment (F=23.37, P=.0003). CGI decreased from baseline with both
      olanzapine and haloperidol treatments (1.1 vs. 0.4) but the decrease in the
      olanzapine group was significantly greater (F=4.63, P=.05). Mean weight increased
      in both groups but without statistical difference between groups. CONCLUSIONS: In
      elderly chronic schizophrenia patients, olanzapine treatment is superior to
      haloperidol in reducing negative symptoms as well as less induction of
      extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS).

TI  - Depression and dysphoria in adult and adolescent patients with Tourette's
      disorder treated with risperidone.
PG  - 1040-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression is a common comorbid condition in patients with Tourette's
      disorder. While risperidone is not usually known to induce dysphoria or
      depression in patients treated for other psychiatric disorders, previous
      short-term 4- to 12-week trials of risperidone for Tourette's disorder have
      reported a 2.6% to 30.8% incidence of depression. METHOD: A retrospective study
      was carried out in 58 adult and adolescent patients with Tourette's disorder
      (Tourette Syndrome Classification Study Group diagnosis) who received risperidone
      between Jan. 1, 1993, and Dec. 31, 2000, at the Allan Memorial Institute, McGill 
      University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Charts of all patients were
      examined for evidence of, and risk factors for, DSM-IV-defined major depressive
      disorder (MDD) or dysphoria. RESULTS: Seventeen (29.3%) of 58 patients developed 
      MDD, including 1 patient who later committed suicide and 13 patients (22.4%) who 
      became dysphoric while taking risperidone. Nine of the 17 patients who developed 
      MDD were relapses, i.e., patients with a history of depression prior to taking
      risperidone, while the remainder were new cases, i.e., patients with no previous 
      history of depression. A positive personal history of MDD was the only factor to 
      significantly (p <.001) predict the development of depression while taking
      risperidone. Seventy percent of those who developed MDD or dysphoria and
      discontinued risperidone did so specifically as a result of this adverse event.
      CONCLUSION: MDD and dysphoria commonly occurred in this cohort of adult and
      adolescent Tourette's disorder patients treated with risperidone, particularly in
      patients with a previous history of depression. Depression and dysphoria were
      frequent reasons for risperidone discontinuation.

TI  - Effects of stimulant medications on the EEG of children with
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - 277-84
AB  - RATIONALE: Stimulant medications are the most commonly used treatments for
      attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in North America and Australia,
      although it is still not entirely known how these medications work. OBJECTIVES:
      This study aimed to investigate the effects of stimulant medications on the EEG
      of children with the Combined subtype of ADHD. METHOD: An initial EEG was
      recorded during an eyes-closed resting condition and Fourier transformed to
      provide absolute and relative power estimates for the delta, theta, alpha and
      beta bands. Theta/alpha and theta/beta ratios were also calculated. Subjects were
      placed on a 6-month trial of a stimulant and a second EEG was recorded at the end
      of the trial. RESULTS: The ADHD group had significantly greater absolute delta
      and theta, less posterior absolute beta, more relative theta, and less relative
      alpha than the control group, which is typical of EEG studies of children with
      ADHD. The use of stimulant medications resulted in normalisation of the EEG,
      primarily evident in changes in the theta and beta bands. CONCLUSIONS: These
      results suggest that stimulants act to increase cortical arousal in children with
      ADHD, normalising their brain activity.

PG  - 1070
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the rates of cardiac arrest and ventricular arrhythmia in
      patients with treated schizophrenia and in non-schizophrenic controls. DESIGN:
      Cohort study of outpatients using administrative data. SETTING: 3 US Medicaid
      programmes. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with schizophrenia treated with clozapine,
      haloperidol, risperidone, or thioridazine; a control group of patients with
      glaucoma; and a control group of patients with psoriasis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE:
      Diagnosis of cardiac arrest or ventricular arrhythmia. RESULTS: Patients with
      treated schizophrenia had higher rates of cardiac arrest and ventricular
      arrhythmia than controls, with rate ratios ranging from 1.7 to 3.2. Overall,
      thioridazine was not associated with an increased risk compared with haloperidol 
      (rate ratio 0.9, 95% confidence interval 0.7 to 1.2). However, thioridazine
      showed an increased risk of events at doses > or =600 mg (2.6, 1.0 to 6.6;
      P=0.049) and a linear dose-response relation (P=0.038). CONCLUSIONS: The
      increased risk of cardiac arrest and ventricular arrhythmia in patients with
      treated schizophrenia could be due to the disease or its treatment. Overall, the 
      risk with thioridazine was no worse than that with haloperidol. Thioridazine may,
      however, have a higher risk at high doses, although this finding could be due to 
      chance. To reduce cardiac risk, thioridazine should be prescribed at the lowest
      dose needed to obtain an optimal therapeutic effect.

TI  - An assessment of the independent effects of olanzapine and risperidone exposure
      on the risk of hyperlipidemia in schizophrenic patients.
PG  - 1021-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: The newer antipsychotic agents exhibit a superior safety profile
      compared with conventional antipsychotic agents in terms of extrapyramidal
      symptoms. Previous studies have suggested an association between olanzapine
      treatment and hyperlipidemia. We evaluated this association using a large health 
      care database. METHODS: The study was derived from the England and Wales-based
      General Practice Research Database, composed of 3.5 million subjects followed up 
      between June 1, 1987, and September 24, 2000. A total of 18 309 individuals
      diagnosed as having schizophrenia were identified. A 6:1 matched nested
      case-control design was used. Conditional logistic regression was used to derive 
      adjusted odds ratios (ORs), controlling for sex, age, and other medications and
      disease conditions influencing lipid levels. Antipsychotic drug exposure was
      defined as the receipt of at least 1 prescription for an antipsychotic medication
      within the 3 months before the date of diagnosis of hyperlipidemia. RESULTS:
      There were 1268 incident cases of hyperlipidemia in the cohort, matched to 7598
      control subjects. Olanzapine use was associated with nearly a 5-fold increase in 
      the odds of developing hyperlipidemia compared with no antipsychotic exposure
      (OR, 4.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.44-8.85) (P<.001) and more than a
      3-fold increase compared with those receiving conventional agents (OR, 3.36; 95% 
      CI, 1.77-6.39) (P<.001). Risperidone was not associated with increased odds of
      hyperlipidemia compared with no antipsychotic exposure (OR, 1.12; 95% CI,
      0.60-2.11) (P =.72) or conventional antipsychotic exposure (OR, 0.81; 95% CI,
      0.44-1.52) (P =.52). CONCLUSIONS: We observed a strong association between
      olanzapine exposure and hyperlipidemia in schizophrenic patients. The possible
      metabolic consequences of olanzapine use should be given serious consideration by
      treating physicians.

TI  - Cognitive enhancing effects of modafinil in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 260-9
AB  - RATIONALE: Modafinil, a novel wake-promoting agent, has been shown to have a
      similar clinical profile to that of conventional stimulants such as
      methylphenidate. We were therefore interested in assessing whether modafinil,
      with its unique pharmacological mode of action, might offer similar potential as 
      a cognitive enhancer, without the side effects commonly experienced with
      amphetamine-like drugs. OBJECTIVES: The main aim of this study was to evaluate
      the cognitive enhancing potential of this novel agent using a comprehensive
      battery of neuropsychological tests. METHODS: Sixty healthy young adult male
      volunteers received either a single oral dose of placebo, or 100 mg or 200 mg
      modafinil prior to performing a variety of tasks designed to test memory and
      attention. A randomised double-blind, between-subjects design was used. RESULTS: 
      Modafinil significantly enhanced performance on tests of digit span, visual
      pattern recognition memory, spatial planning and stop-signal reaction time. These
      performance improvements were complemented by a slowing in latency on three
      tests: delayed matching to sample, a decision-making task and the spatial
      planning task. Subjects reported feeling more alert, attentive and energetic on
      drug. The effects were not clearly dose dependent, except for those seen with the
      stop-signal paradigm. In contrast to previous findings with methylphenidate,
      there were no significant effects of drug on spatial memory span, spatial working
      memory, rapid visual information processing or attentional set-shifting.
      Additionally, no effects on paired associates learning were identified.
      CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that modafinil selectively improves
      neuropsychological task performance. This improvement may be attributable to an
      enhanced ability to inhibit pre-potent responses. This effect appears to reduce
      impulsive responding, suggesting that modafinil may be of benefit in the
      treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

TI  - The effects of methylphenidate on prepulse inhibition during attended and ignored
      prestimuli among boys with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - 118-27
AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The present study investigated attentional modification
      of prepulse inhibition of startle among boys with and without attention-deficit
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Two hypotheses were tested: (1) whether ADHD is
      associated with diminished prepulse inhibition during attended prestimuli, but
      not ignored prestimuli, and (2) whether methylphenidate selectively increases
      prepulse inhibition to attended prestimuli among boys with ADHD. METHODS:
      Participants were 17 boys with ADHD and 14 controls. Participants completed a
      tone discrimination task in each of two sessions separated by 1 week. ADHD boys
      were administered methylphenidate (0.3 mg/kg) in one session and placebo in the
      other session in a randomized, double-blind fashion. During each series of 72
      tones (75 dB; half 1200-Hz, half 400-Hz), participants were paid to attend to one
      pitch and ignore the other. Bilateral eyeblink electromyogram startle responses
      were recorded in response to acoustic probes (50-ms, 102-dB white noise)
      presented following the onset of two-thirds of tones, and during one-third of
      intertrial intervals. RESULTS: Relative to controls, boys with ADHD exhibited
      diminished prepulse inhibition 120 ms after onset of attended but not ignored
      prestimuli following placebo administration. Methylphenidate selectively
      increased prepulse inhibition to attended prestimuli at 120 ms among boys with
      ADHD to a level comparable to that of controls, who did not receive
      methylphenidate. CONCLUSIONS: These data are consistent with the hypothesis that 
      ADHD involves diminished selective attention and suggest that methylphenidate
      ameliorates the symptoms of ADHD, at least in part, by altering an early
      attentional mechanism.

TI  - Risperidone, 2 mg/day vs. 4 mg/day, in first-episode, acutely psychotic patients:
      treatment efficacy and effects on fine motor functioning.
PG  - 885-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to examine differences in the improvement
      of clinical psychopathology and in fine motor functions at 2 doses of risperidone
      in first-episode, acutely psychotic patients. METHOD: In a double-blind,
      fixed-dose study, 49 acutely psychotic, neuroleptic-naive patients who were
      admitted for the first time and who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia,
      schizophreniform disorder, or schizoaffective disorder were randomly assigned to 
      2 or 4 mg/day of risperidone. Treatment efficacy was measured using the Brief
      Psychiatric Rating Scale, the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms, The 
      Clinical Global Impressions scale, and the Social and Occupational Functioning
      Assessment Scale. Fine motor functions were assessed using a computerized device 
      (the Vienna Test System) and were compared with those of a control group of 20
      healthy subjects who were matched for age, gender, and educational level.
      RESULTS: Treatment with doses of 2 and 4 mg of risperidone daily significantly
      reduced positive (p < .0001) and negative (p < .01) symptoms at 8 weeks. Although
      there were no significant differences in motor movements as measured using the
      Barnes Akathisia Scale and the Simpson-Angus Scale, computerized fine motor
      assessment showed significantly less motor dysfunction in the 2-mg/day group at 8
      weeks. No significant correlations to plasma concentration of active moiety were 
      found for data on psychopathology and fine motor functions. CONCLUSION: The 2
      doses of risperidone did not differ in terms of clinical improvement, but the
      2-mg/day dose produced fewer fine motor dysfunctions. These results suggest that 
      a dose as low as 2 mg/day of risperidone may be effective for patients with
      first-episode psychosis.

TI  - Serum glucose and lipid changes during the course of clozapine treatment: the
      effect of concurrent beta-adrenergic antagonist treatment.
PG  - 49-57
AB  - We examined the effects of long-term clozapine treatment, concurrent treatment
      with beta-adrenergic antagonists, and clozapine-induced weight gain on serum
      glucose and lipid measures. Fifty subjects met the DSM-III-R criteria for
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, participated in a 10-week,
      double-blind comparison of haloperidol and clozapine and a 1-year, open-label
      clozapine trial, and had available serum glucose and lipid levels. Weight and
      glucose, and lipid laboratory values were measured at the baseline and throughout
      the double-blind and year-long study. There were significant increases in serum
      triglyceride, total cholesterol, and glucose levels during the course of
      clozapine treatment. There were no significant changes in high-density
      lipoprotein (HDL) or low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Propranolol and atenolol had 
      additive effects on changes in the total cholesterol and triglycerides, with
      propranolol having the most pronounced effects. Propranolol and atenolol had no
      significant effect on the serum glucose levels. There were significant
      correlations between the triglyceride and HDL level changes and
      clozapine-associated weight gain during the study. There were no significant
      correlations between the change in serum total cholesterol, LDL, or glucose and
      weight gain. Clozapine therapy has adverse effects on glucose and lipid
      homeostasis, with clozapine-induced changes in serum glucose likely due to the
      inherent pharmacological properties of clozapine. Concurrent beta-adrenergic
      receptor antagonist treatment may have an additive effect on serum lipids, and
      clozapine-associated weight gain also plays a modest role in triglyceride
      increases.

TI  - Olanzapine for Huntington's disease: an open label study.
PG  - 263-5
AB  - The aim of this prospective open label study was to assess the efficacy of
      olanzapine for motor symptoms in Huntington's disease (HD). Olanzapine was
      administrated to nine patients with genetically confirmed HD in increasing doses 
      until satisfactory clinical effect or the appearance of side effects. The
      patients were evaluated at baseline and after 14 days of treatment using the
      motor scale of the Unified HD Rating Scale (UHDRS). The patients improved
      significantly in most subscores of the UHDRS, including fine motor tasks,
      although some patients needed a rather high dose (30 mg per day). No adverse
      effects were reported by the patents spontaneously or were observed directly by
      the investigator. High-dose olanzapine seems to be useful in choreatic HD
      patients. A double blind, placebo-controlled trial appears warranted to
      definitively establish the symptomatic value of olanzapine in HD.

TI  - Young adult follow-up of hyperactive children: self-reported psychiatric
      disorders, comorbidity, and the role of childhood conduct problems and teen CD.
PG  - 463-75
AB  - We report on the psychiatric disorders present at young adult follow-up (Mean age
      20-21 years; 13+ year follow-up) and the comorbidity among them for a large
      sample of hyperactive (H; N = 147) and community control (CC; N = 71) children.
      The H group had a significantly higher risk for any nondrug psychiatric disorders
      than the CC group (59% vs. 36%). More of the H group met criteria for ADHD (5%); 
      major depressive disorder (26%); and histrionic (12%), antisocial (21%),
      passive-aggressive (18%), and borderline personality disorders (14%) at follow-up
      than the CC group. Severity of childhood conduct problems contributed to the risk
      for passive-aggressive, borderline, and antisocial personality disorders. But it 
      only affected risk for antisocial personality after controlling for severity of
      teen conduct disorder (CD), which also contributed to the risk for these same 3
      disorders. Examination for comorbidity among these disorders indicated that
      presence of either borderline or antisocial personality disorder significantly
      increased the risk for major depression and the other significant personality
      disorders. More of the hyperactive group had received various forms of mental
      health treatment during and since leaving high school than the control group.
      Results suggest that hyperactive children are at significant risk for at least 1 
      nondrug disorder in young adulthood, principally major depression and several
      personality disorders, and that this risk is largely mediated by severity of CD
      at adolescence.

TI  - Epinephrine and clonidine do not improve intrathecal sufentanil analgesia after
      total hip replacement.
PG  - 562-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: We compared analgesia after intrathecal sufentanil alone, sufentanil 
      with epinephrine 200 microg and sufentanil with clonidine 30 microg in patients
      after total hip replacement, the endpoints being onset and duration of action.
      METHODS: We performed a randomized double-blind study of 45 patients for elective
      total hip arthroplasty using continuous spinal anaesthesia. As soon as a pain
      score higher than 3 on a 10 cm visual analogue scale was reported, sufentanil 7.5
      microg alone, sufentanil 7.5 microg + epinephrine 200 microg or sufentanil 7.5
      microg + clonidine 30 micro g in 2 ml normal saline was given intrathecally. Pain
      scores, rescue analgesia (diclofenac and morphine) and adverse effects
      (respiratory depression, postoperative nausea and vomiting, itching) were
      observed for 24 h after surgery. RESULTS: Time to a pain score of <3 [6 (SD 1) vs
      6 (1) vs 5 (1) min], time to the lowest pain score [7 (2) vs 8 (2) vs 8 (2) min] 
      and time to the first dose of systemic analgesic for a pain score >3 [281 (36) vs
      288 (23) vs 305 (30) min] were similar in all three groups. Adverse effects and
      analgesic requirements during the first 24 h were also similar. CONCLUSION: After
      total hip replacement, all three analgesic regimens gave good analgesia with
      comparable onset and duration of action, and minor adverse effects.

TI  - Aripiprazole.
PG  - 779-86; discussion 787-8
AB  - Aripiprazole is a quinolinone derivative and the first of a new class of atypical
      antipsychotics. The drug has partial agonist activity at dopamine D(2) and
      serotonin 5-HT(1A) receptors, and is also an antagonist at 5-HT(2A) receptors. In
      patients with acute relapse of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder,
      aripiprazole 15 to 30 mg/day was at least as effective as haloperidol 10 mg/day
      and had similar efficacy to risperidone 6 mg/day in well designed, 4-week,
      placebo-controlled trials. Negative symptoms improved earlier in the aripiprazole
      than the risperidone group. Efficacy of aripiprazole was observed at week 1 in
      several trials and was sustained throughout the study periods. Aripiprazole was
      superior to placebo in a 26-week trial in patients with stable, chronic
      schizophrenia. In a 52-week trial involving patients with acute relapsing
      disease, aripiprazole was similar to haloperidol as assessed by time to failure
      to maintain response and was superior in ameliorating negative and depressive
      symptoms. The incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms during aripiprazole therapy
      was similar to that with risperidone and placebo but lower than with haloperidol.
      Compared with placebo, the proportion of patients with increased plasma prolactin
      levels and QTc prolongation was similar in patients treated with aripiprazole 15 
      to 30 mg/day but was significantly increased with haloperidol and risperidone.

TI  - Extended-release methylphenidate (Ritalin LA).
PG  - 2251-9; discussion 2260-1
AB  - An extended-release formulation of methylphenidate (Ritalin LA), a CNS stimulant 
      that inhibits dopamine and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) reuptake into
      presynaptic neurons, has been developed for use in patients with attention
      deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In children with ADHD and healthy male
      adults, extended-release methylphenidate 20mg was rapidly absorbed and
      demonstrated two distinct peak plasma concentrations approximately 4 hours apart.
      The absorption pharmacokinetics of extended-release methylphenidate 20mg, which
      closely mimics those of immediate-release methylphenidate 10mg given in two doses
      4 hours apart, permits once-daily administration. In a 2-week randomised,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 134 evaluable children aged 6 to 12
      years with ADHD, symptoms improved to a significantly greater extent with
      extended-release methylphenidate 10 to 40mg once daily than with placebo.
      Extended-release methylphenidate improved both inattention and hyperactivity
      symptoms and was effective in children with combined- (inattentive and
      hyperactive/impulsive) type or predominantly inattentive-type ADHD. In clinical
      trials, the safety and tolerability profiles of extended-release methylphenidate 
      were consistent with that of the immediate-release formulation.

TI  - Severe ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death on neuroleptics.
PG  - 146-50
AB  - (1) Neuroleptics prolong the QT interval, with a risk of torsades de pointes,
      ventricular tachycardia, syncope and sudden death. This adverse reaction is
      dose-dependent. (2) Most published cases have involved phenothiazines, and
      especially thioridazine. Most other neuroleptics have also been involved,
      including recent drugs such as risperidone and olanzapine. 'Hidden neuroleptics' 
      such as cisapride and injectable domperidone carry the same risk. (3) While this 
      effect has been known for several decades, the degree of risk associated with the
      various neuroleptics is still poorly known, and few epidemiological data are
      available. (4) The cornerstones of prevention of cardiac arrhythmia in patients
      treated with neuroleptics are to weigh up carefully the indications, prescribe
      the lowest effective dose, and monitor the ECG. All patients should also be
      screened for precipitating factors, such as other risk factors for torsades de
      pointes and combination with other drugs that favour torsades de pointes or
      provoke pharmacokinetic interactions.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of aripiprazole and haloperidol versus placebo in patients
      with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.
PG  - 763-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aripiprazole is an investigational agent for treating schizophrenia
      that has a novel pharmacologic profile. The present study investigated the
      efficacy, safety, and tolerability of aripiprazole and haloperidol compared with 
      placebo. METHOD: A 4-week, double-blind, randomized study, conducted at 36 U.S.
      centers between July 1997 and June 1998, compared aripiprazole (15 mg/day, 30
      mg/day) to placebo, with haloperidol (10 mg/day) as an active control. Fixed
      doses of each agent were administered from day 1 throughout the study. A total of
      414 patients with a primary DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective 
      disorder were randomized. Efficacy measures included the Positive and Negative
      Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total, PANSS positive, PANSS negative, PANSS-derived Brief
      Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) core, Clinical Global Impressions (CGI)-Severity 
      of Illness, and mean CGI-Improvement scores. Safety and tolerability evaluations 
      included extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), weight gain, serum prolactin level, and
      QTc interval. RESULTS: Both doses of aripiprazole and haloperidol, 10 mg,
      produced statistically significant (p < or = .05) improvements from baseline in
      PANSS total, PANSS positive, PANSS-derived BPRS core, and CGI-Severity scores and
      significantly lower CGI-Improvement scores at endpoint, compared with placebo.
      Aripiprazole, 15 mg, and haloperidol, 10 mg, significantly improved PANSS
      negative score compared with placebo. Both aripiprazole doses and haloperidol
      separated from placebo for PANSS total scores at week 2. Unlike haloperidol,
      aripiprazole was not associated with significant EPS or prolactin elevation at
      endpoint compared with placebo. There were no statistically significant
      differences in mean changes in body weight across the treatment groups versus
      placebo, and no patients receiving aripiprazole experienced clinically
      significant increases in QTc interval. CONCLUSION: Aripiprazole, effective
      against positive and negative symptoms, is a safe and well-tolerated potential
      treatment for schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.

TI  - [Opioid detoxication under general anesthesia].
PG  - 4165-9
AB  - Antagonist-precipitated opioid detoxification under general anaesthesia has been 
      used extensively since its introduction in 1988. The use of antagonists was
      believed to shorten the detoxification period. Administration to opioid
      dependents is followed by a violent activation of the adrenergic system, which
      results in the development of an acute withdrawal syndrome in the patient. This
      is usually treated with clonidine. To reduce the subjective discomfort, the
      procedure is conducted under anaesthesia. From the existing literature, one may
      conclude that despite more than ten years of development there is currently no
      sufficient evidence of the effectiveness of antagonist-precipitated opioid
      detoxification under general anaesthesia conducted under modern
      anaesthesiological management. Randomised, clinical trials are necessary to
      document the advantages of this detoxification method as compared to conventional
      treatment.

TI  - Olanzapine treatment for dopaminergic-induced hallucinations.
PG  - 1031-5
AB  - Atypical antipsychotic medications with lower affinities for D2 receptors are
      considered useful alternatives to treat drug-induced hallucinations in
      Parkinson's disease (PD). We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      unforced titration, parallel design study (2:1 drug to placebo randomization
      ratio) using olanzapine (2.5-10 mg/day to effect) in 30 PD patients with
      drug-induced hallucinations. We performed an extensive battery of
      neuropsychological tests, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS),
      assessments of on and off time at baseline and at 9 weeks after starting the
      medication. Sixteen patients on olanzapine (mean dose, 4.6 mg/night) and 11 on
      placebo completed the study. Compared with placebo, performance on the UPDRS item
      2 (thought disorder), and a structured interview for hallucinations, both tended 
      to improve on drug but neither reached statistical significance. A
      neuropsychological test battery did not show any significant differences. Total
      on UPDRS motor scores (P < 0.05) and timed tapping (P < 0.01) worsened while on
      drug compared to placebo. Bradykinesia (P < 0.01) and gait (P < 0.001) items on
      the UPDRS largely accounted for this deterioration. After completion of the
      study, 8 of 16 patients randomly assigned to drug continued olanzapine at a mean 
      dose of 2.4 mg/day. However, at the last recorded visit only 5 of 24 (20.8%) of
      all patients exposed to drug (including those originally randomly assigned to
      placebo) remained on olanzapine. In patients with PD, low-dose olanzapine did not
      significantly improve hallucinations but did worsen motor function.

TI  - Adjunctive olanzapine for SSRI-resistant combat-related PTSD: a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 1777-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), particularly in combat veterans 
      with chronic illness, is often refractory to standard pharmacological
      interventions. There is a need to test adjunctive treatments to boost response.
      METHOD: Subjects were 19 patients with PTSD who were minimally responsive to 12
      weeks of treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) at
      maximum tolerated dose. Outcomes were compared among subjects whose treatment was
      augmented with 8 weeks of double-blind olanzapine or placebo administration.
      RESULTS: Olanzapine augmentation was associated with statistically significantly 
      greater reduction than placebo in specific measures of posttraumatic stress,
      depressive, and sleep disorder symptoms. Clinician-rated global response rates
      did not, however, significantly differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS: This is most 
      likely the first double-blind, placebo-controlled study of an adjunct to SSRIs
      for PTSD. Despite the small group size, the findings suggest a role for
      olanzapine or other atypical antipsychotics in treating SSRI-resistant PTSD.
      Sleep symptoms may especially benefit.

TI  - Risperidone decreases craving and relapses in individuals with schizophrenia and 
      cocaine dependence.
PG  - 671-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy of atypical neuroleptics for decreasing
      craving and drug relapses during protracted withdrawal in individuals dually
      diagnosed with schizophrenia and cocaine dependence. METHOD: We conducted a
      6-week, open-label pilot study comparing risperidone with typical neuroleptics in
      a sample of withdrawn cocaine-dependent schizophrenia patients. RESULTS:
      Preliminary results suggest that individuals treated with risperidone had
      significantly less cue-elicited craving and substance abuse relapses at study
      completion. Further, they showed a trend toward a greater reduction in negative
      and global symptoms of schizophrenia. CONCLUSION: Atypical neuroleptics may help 
      reduce craving and relapses in this population. Future research should include
      more rigorous double-blind placebo-controlled studies with this class of
      medications.

TI  - Comparative efficacy of Adderall and methylphenidate in
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: a meta-analysis.
PG  - 468-73
AB  - Because methylphenidate is currently the most widely prescribed medication for
      attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder, several studies have used it as the
      active comparator medication for evaluating the efficacy of a newer stimulant,
      Adderall. These prior studies show Adderall to be superior to placebo and suggest
      it is at least as effective as the standard-release form of methylphenidate and
      has a longer duration of action. Although these initial studies provide useful
      information for clinicians treating children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity
      disorder, they are difficult to interpret because findings vary among studies and
      among the different types of measures used within each study. To provide a
      clearer picture of what conclusions can be drawn from these studies, we performed
      a meta-analysis. Data from the four available studies suggest that Adderall has a
      small but statistically significant advantage over the standard-release form of
      methylphenidate. This advantage was observed for both symptom measures and global
      ratings but was strongest for global ratings. The effect of Adderall was
      significant for clinician and parent ratings but not for teacher ratings and was 
      significant for both fixed-dose and best-dose designs.

TI  - Olanzapine in the treatment of dopamimetic-induced psychosis in patients with
      Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 438-45
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies in elderly patients demonstrate antipsychotic efficacy and
      favorable safety profiles for olanzapine. We report results from two
      placebo-controlled, double-blind studies of olanzapine for treatment of
      dopamimetic drug-induced psychosis in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).
      METHODS: Patients were treated with olanzapine or placebo for 4 weeks while
      dopamimetic therapy was held constant. Olanzapine was initiated at 2.5 mg/day,
      with 2.5-mg/day increases allowed every 3 to 4 days up to the maximum dose of 15 
      mg/day. RESULTS: Olanzapine patients showed significant improvements from
      baseline on positive symptoms and most efficacy measures, but no significant
      treatment-group differences were observed. Olanzapine performed significantly
      worse than placebo in both studies on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating
      Scale (UPDRS) total, Motor, and Activities of Daily Living scales, but not the
      UPDRS Tremor item or Complications scores. Corrected QT interval, vital signs,
      and body weight were not significantly different from placebo. CONCLUSIONS: These
      findings did not demonstrate superior efficacy of olanzapine for treatment of
      dopamimetic-induced psychosis in PD. The initial dose-titration schedule and mild
      baseline levels of psychosis may account for these findings. Future studies
      involving gradual dose titration are needed to explore further olanzapine's
      optimum use for patients with PD with treatment-related psychosis.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness comparison of tizanidine and baclofen in the management of
      spasticity.
PG  - 827-37
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Baclofen and tizanidine are both used for the treatment of muscle
      spasticity of spinal origin. Their effectiveness, cost and adverse-effect
      profiles differ. This paper sets out to estimate the cost effectiveness of each
      drug, and the impact of changing from baclofen to tizanidine. DESIGN: A
      simplified but realistic model of physician behaviour and patient response was
      developed as a decision tree and populated with data derived from the available
      published clinical comparative trials. We considered patients with spasticity
      caused by multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury. The outcome measure used was 
      'cost per successfully treated day' (STD). Costs were estimated from the
      perspective of the UK National Health Service at 2000 values. RESULTS: Expected
      cost for a cohort of 100 patients over 1 year was estimated to be pound 181 545
      with baclofen and pound 211 930 with tizanidine. The estimated number of STDs was
      20,192 with tizanidine and 17,289 with baclofen. The overall cost effectiveness
      of managing spasticity using baclofen and tizanidine was very similar ( pound
      10.50 and pound 10.49 per STD respectively). The incremental cost effectiveness
      (ICE) of using tinzanidine as an alternative to baclofen for first-line treatment
      was pound 10.47 per STD. Sensitivity analysis found the model to be robust to
      changes in key parameters CONCLUSION: Drug cost should not be a determining
      factor in making this treatment choice, as the cost effectiveness ratios are
      similar for both products.

TI  - Extrapyramidal symptom profiles in Japanese patients with schizophrenia treated
      with olanzapine or haloperidol.
PG  - 227-38
AB  - Previous clinical trials have clearly shown the superiority of olanzapine to
      haloperidol in the improvement of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) in schizophrenic 
      patients. The primary purpose of this study was to compare EPS profiles in
      Japanese schizophrenic patients treated with an atypical antipsychotic,
      olanzapine, or a typical antipsychotic, haloperidol, as measured by the
      Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptoms Scale (DIEPSS). The DIEPSS, which consists
      of eight individual parameters and one global assessment (overall severity), was 
      used to evaluate 182 patients enrolled in this 8-week study. The primary safety
      analysis was maximum change (that could be either a decrease or increase) from
      baseline in DIEPSS total score. Secondary analyses included change from baseline 
      to maximum in DIEPSS total score, change from baseline to endpoint (LOCF) in
      DIEPSS total score, and the rank sum of the maximum change (that could be either 
      a decrease or increase) from baseline in the DIEPSS individual items. Incidence
      of treatment-emergent EPS adverse events using the DIEPSS scale was also
      analyzed. The olanzapine group showed statistically significant superiority to
      the haloperidol group on the primary analysis (p<0.001). Secondary analyses also 
      demonstrated olanzapine's superiority in DIEPSS total, parkinsonism, akathisia
      and overall severity scores (all p< or =0.014). Categorical analysis of
      treatment-emergent akathisia and parkinsonism syndromes at endpoint showed
      improvement in the olanzapine group but worsening in the haloperidol group. The
      results from this study suggest that olanzapine, as in Caucasian populations, is 
      a safe treatment in Japanese patients chronically ill with schizophrenia.

TI  - Switching from conventional to novel antipsychotic drugs: results of a
      prospective naturalistic study.
PG  - 201-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We examined the long-term consequences of switching patients from
      conventional to novel antipsychotic drugs, from a patient's perspective. METHODS:
      In a prospective, single-blinded, naturalistic study, a cohort of subjects
      (n=150) with schizophrenia or schizo-affective disorder (DSM-IV) were switched
      from conventional neuroleptic drugs to either risperidone (n=50), olanzepine
      (n=50) or quetiapine (n=50), and monitored for a period of 2 to 6 years. The
      ensuing natural history of transitions in treatments was charted, and the
      outcomes including symptoms, side effects, subjective tolerability of drugs and
      their impact on quality of life were documented with standardized rating scales. 
      RESULTS: Majority (85%) of the subjects benefited from a switch to the novel
      antipsychotic drugs, though some preferred to return to their original
      neuroleptic (8%), and others eventually required clozapine (7%) therapy. Novel
      antipsychotic drugs were significantly tolerated better, and had a positive
      impact on treatment-adherence, psychosocial functioning and quality of life.
      Among the novel drugs, risperidone was significantly better in improving negative
      symptoms, while olanzepine was particularly well tolerated and effective against 
      comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms. Patients treated with quetiapine
      reported fewer side effects, and showed a significantly greater improvement in
      neurocognitive deficits. CONCLUSION: Novel antipsychotics emerged as the drug of 
      choice in view of their overall effectiveness, though conventional neuroleptics
      and clozapine will continue to have a limited but distinct role in the management
      of schizophrenia. The challenge for clinicians lies in matching a patient's
      clinical and biochemical profile with that of a drug's pharmacological actions,
      in order to achieve optimum outcomes.

TI  - Somatic treatment for depressive illnesses in children and adolescents.
PG  - 555-78, ix
AB  - Numerous somatic interventions have been studied as potential treatments of
      depressive disorders in children and adolescents. These include antidepressant
      medications, light therapy, electro-convulsive therapy, and alternative
      therapies. The available evidence suggests that several somatic interventions
      hold promise as potentially safe and effective treatments for depressed youth;
      however, there is still much to be learned about these interventions. This
      article reviews what is known and what needs to be learned about the somatic
      treatment of pediatric depression.

TI  - A comparison of sustained-release bupropion and placebo for smokeless tobacco
      cessation.
PG  - 386-93
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential efficacy of bupropion sustained release when
      used in combination with minimal counseling for moist snuff cessation in males.
      METHODS: A double-blind, placebo-controlled 3-month trial. The active treatment
      group (n = 35) received bupropion SR at 150 mg/qd day for the first 3 days, then 
      beginning day 4 through day 49 (7 weeks) 150 mg/ b.i.d. The placebo group (n= 35)
      received 1 tablet qd for 3 days and beginning day 4 through day 49, 1
      tablet/b.i.d. RESULTS: Bupropion 300 mg/day (150 b.i.d.) produced significantly
      higher quit rates for smokeless tobacco cessation at the end of treatment (7
      weeks) than placebo (p = 0.04) with an OR of 2.73. CONCLUSION: Bupropion SR
      appears to be effective for smokeless tobacco cessation.

TI  - Dexmethylphenidate.
PG  - 1899-904; discussion 1905-8
AB  - Dexmethylphenidate comprises only the d-enantiomer (the pharmacologically
      effective isomer) of racemic methylphenidate and is indicated for the treatment
      of patients aged > or =6 years with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
      (ADHD). In a 4-week, double-blind trial in 132 children with ADHD, significantly 
      greater improvements from baseline in teacher-rated Swanson, Nolan and Pelham
      (SNAP)-ADHD scores were seen in dexmethylphenidate and methylphenidate
      recipients, compared with placebo recipients. In addition, significantly more
      dexmethylphenidate and methylphenidate recipients, compared with placebo
      recipients, were much improved or very much improved according to Clinical Global
      Impression-Improvement of Illness scale scores. In the same study, parent-rated
      SNAP-ADHD scores had decreased by a significantly greater extent in
      dexmethylphenidate recipients at 3pm and 6pm and in methylphenidate recipients at
      3pm, compared with placebo recipients. Significantly fewer dexmethylphenidate
      than placebo recipients failed treatment in a double-blind, treatment-withdrawal 
      trial in 75 children with ADHD (17.1 vs 61.5%). In a noncomparative study in 22
      children with ADHD, symptoms of ADHD, as assessed by teachers and parents, were
      controlled during the entire school day in 68 and 86% of dexmethylphenidate
      recipients, respectively, with a median duration of effect of 6.3 and 7.5 hours, 
      respectively. Dexmethylphenidate was generally well tolerated in children with
      ADHD; adverse events were consistent with those known to be associated with
      agents containing methylphenidate.

TI  - Drug treatment of conduct disorder in young people.
PG  - 361-70
AB  - Although conduct disorder (CD) is the most common psychiatric disorder in youth
      from the community and encompasses one third to one half of all referrals to
      child and adolescent clinics, there is no licensed drug, to date, for treatment
      of CD, neither in Europe nor in the US. The aims of this paper are to review
      research data available on the use of medication for CD in young people and to
      identify future directions for research. We review 17 controlled studies and six 
      open trials. Investigated compounds mainly belong to three classes of
      psychotropic drugs: mood stabilizers, neuroleptics and stimulants (six, five and 
      six controlled studies, respectively). Lithium is the most documented treatment
      (3/4 positive studies). Conventional neuroleptics have been most commonly
      prescribed (3/3 positive studies), atypical neuroleptics appear promising (2/2
      positive studies). Methylphenidate improves some CD symptoms, even in the absence
      of ADHD (6/6 positive studies). Sparse research has been conducted on response to
      antidepressants. The evidence for an effective role of pharmacotherapy in CD is
      still limited. Treatment should be multimodal and individualized to each
      patient's specific condition.

      review of the published literature.
PG  - 1235-42
AB  - The Medline literature on the behavioral effects of caffeine in infants and
      children are reviewed. There has been little recent work in this area. Generally,
      caffeine is well tolerated in usual dietary amounts, and there is evidence that
      individuals differ in their susceptibility to caffeine-related adverse effects,
      which in turn may influence their consumption. Overall, the effects of caffeine
      in children seem to be modest and typically innocuous.

TI  - Optimal dosing of atypical antipsychotics in adults: a review of the current
      evidence.
PG  - 280-91
AB  - This review describes dosing strategies used to optimize the beneficial effects
      of atypical antipsychotic medications. Differences between manufacturers'
      recommended dosing and actual clinical practice are reconciled using evidence
      from pivotal double-blind randomized registration studies, other randomized
      clinical trials, case series, and case reports. With clozapine and perhaps
      olanzapine, plasma levels are correlated with therapeutic response; with
      risperidone, plasma levels are not correlated with therapeutic response but may
      be related to the occurrence of extrapyramidal symptoms. Information related to
      optimal dosing of quetiapine and ziprasidone is more limited. In clinical
      practice, the mean daily dose of risperidone has decreased, whereas that for
      olanzapine is increasing. The percentage of patients receiving quetiapine at
      doses above the manufacturer's recommended maximum is higher than would be
      expected, further illustrating that dosing ranges established during registration
      studies may not reflect the needs of day-to-day practice.

TI  - Anaesthetic and postoperative analgesic effects of spinal clonidine as an
      additive to prilocaine in the transurethral resection of urinary bladder tumours.
PG  - 589-93
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine has potent
      central antinociceptive properties. The study was designed to investigate the
      effects of the combined subarachnoid administration of clonidine and prilocaine
      on spinal block and postoperative analgesia for the transurethral resection of
      tumours in the urinary bladder. METHODS: The controlled, prospective,
      double-blind study enrolled 40 patients scheduled for elective transurethral
      resection of bladder tumours under spinal anaesthesia with prilocaine. Patients
      were randomly assigned to receive an intrathecal injection of prilocaine 75 mg
      alone (control group) or in combination with clonidine 75 micrograms. We assessed
      haemodynamic changes (non-invasive arterial pressure, heart rate), pulse
      oximetry, the upper level of block, the onset and duration of sensory and motor
      block, postoperative analgesia and any adverse effects. RESULTS: There were no
      statistically significant differences in demographic data, heart rate, onset time
      or the levels of sensory or motor block. Analgesia lasted significantly longer in
      the clonidine group (498.4 +/- 226.9 versus 187.2 +/- 103.1 min; P < 0.05). The
      duration of motor block was longer in the clonidine group (165.5 +/- 30.6 min)
      than in the control group (139.7 +/- 40.4 min; P < 0.05) and the duration of
      sensory block was also longer in the clonidine group (157.3 +/- 24.5 min) than in
      the control group (137.2 +/- 31.2 min; P < 0.05). Fewer patients in the recovery 
      room needed metamizol (dipyrone) in the clonidine group (5%) than in the control 
      group (50%). Arterial pressure decreased significantly in the clonidine group
      75-135 min after the block. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of clonidine 75 micrograms 
      to prilocaine 75 mg for subarachnoid anaesthesia increased the duration of
      sensory and motor block and reduced the need for additional postoperative
      analgesics by providing excellent analgesia for about 8 h during recovery from
      transurethral resection of bladder tumours.

TI  - Selegiline: a second look. Six years later: too risky in Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 108-11
AB  - (1) The reference treatment for Parkinson's disease is levodopa plus a peripheral
      dopadecarboxylase inhibitor (benserazide or carbidopa). (2) In 1996, selegiline, 
      a type B MAOI marketed in France since 1988, saw its indications extended to
      cover single-agent therapy of early-stage Parkinson's disease, and in combination
      with levodopa, before onset of complications of levodopa therapy. The initial
      clinical file failed to show that selegiline had any benefit in these
      indications. (3) Now, in 2002, new data from trials involving hundreds of
      untreated patients show that selegiline postpones the need for levodopa therapy
      for a few months but fails to substantially alter the progression of Parkinson's 
      disease. (4) A clinical trial and a retrospective epidemiological study of
      patients with advanced Parkinson's disease showed excess mortality on selegiline.
      (5) The side effects of selegiline are similar to those of other antiparkinsonian
      drugs and amphetamine. Notable side effects include cardiovascular problems
      (postural hypotension, atrial fibrillation and arterial hypertension). (6)
      Selegiline can cause a serotoninergic syndrome and arterial hypertension, so must
      not be combined with pethidine, tramadol, bupropion, sumatriptan, zolmitriptan or
      naratriptan. Concurrent treatment with serotonin reuptake inhibitor
      antidepressants should also be avoided. (7) Given the only moderate effects of
      selegiline in Parkinson's disease, and the possibility of a slight increase in
      mortality, there is no justification for prescribing this medication in patients 
      with Parkinson's disease. (8) Whatever the stage of Parkinson's disease, there is
      no justification for starting patients on selegiline. Patients who are already
      taking selegiline should only continue to take it if they feel a clear benefit
      and are free from risk factors for early mortality, especially cardiovascular
      disease.

TI  - The analgesic efficacy of bilateral combined superficial and deep cervical plexus
      block administered before thyroid surgery under general anesthesia.
PG  - 746-50, table of contents
AB  - In this study we evaluated the analgesic efficacy of combined deep and
      superficial cervical plexus block in patients undergoing thyroidectomy under
      general anesthesia. For this purpose, 39 patients undergoing elective thyroid
      surgery were randomized to receive a bilateral combined deep and superficial
      cervical block (14 mL per side) with saline (Group 1; n = 13), ropivacaine 0.5%
      (Group 2; n = 13), or ropivacaine 0.5% plus clonidine 7.5 microg/mL (Group 3; n =
      13). Deep cervical plexus block was performed with a single injection (8 mL) at
      the C3 level. Superficial cervical plexus block consisted of a subcutaneous
      injection (6 mL) behind the lateral border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.
      During surgery, the number of additional alfentanil boluses was significantly
      reduced in Groups 2 and 3 compared with Group 1 (1.3 +/- 1.0 and 1.1 +/- 1.0 vs
      2.6 +/- 1.0; P < 0.05). After surgery, the opioid and non-opioid analgesic
      requirements were also significantly reduced in Groups 2 and 3 (P < 0.05) during 
      the first 24 h. Except for one patient in Group 3, who experienced transient
      anesthesia of the brachial plexus, no side effect was noted in any group. We
      conclude that combined deep and superficial cervical plexus block is an effective
      technique to alleviate pain during and immediately after thyroidectomy.
      IMPLICATIONS: Combined deep and superficial cervical plexus block is an effective
      technique to reduce opioid requirements during and after thyroid surgery.

TI  - Bupropion for pharmacologic relapse prevention to smoking: predictors of outcome.
PG  - 493-507
AB  - The aim of this study was to identify predictors of successful relapse prevention
      in smokers receiving long-term sustained-release bupropion. Smokers (N= 784) who 
      were interested in stopping smoking were enrolled in a 7-week, open-label
      bupropion phase. Abstinent subjects at the end of treatment and eligible to
      proceed (N= 429) were randomized to active bupropion or placebo through Week 52
      and then followed for an additional year. The best overall predictor of less
      relapse to smoking was assignment to active bupropion. In aggregate, the results 
      indicate that bupropion can be prescribed to diverse populations of smokers with 
      expected comparable results. There was a medication effect that was independent
      of any predictor except older age and those who gained no or minimal weight
      during the open-label phase. Predictors of successful relapse prevention included
      lower baseline smoking rates, a Fagerstrom Tolerance Questionnaire score of < 6, 
      and initiation of smoking at an older age. These data should encourage others to 
      perform similar pharmacologic relapse prevention studies with this or other
      pharmacotherapies.

TI  - Topiramate versus bupropion SR when added to mood stabilizer therapy for the
      depressive phase of bipolar disorder: a preliminary single-blind study.
PG  - 207-13
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are commonly employed in the treatment of
      bipolar disorder. The efficacy and tolerability of topiramate, a novel
      anticonvulsant, and bupropion SR when added to mood stabilizer therapy were
      compared under single-blind conditions (rater-blinded) in patients meeting DSM-IV
      criteria for bipolar I/II depression. METHODS: A total of 36 out-patients with
      Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17) scores > or = 16 were randomized to
      receive escalating doses of either topiramate (50-300 mg/day) or bupropion SR
      (100-400 mg/day) for 8 weeks. Data were analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis
      using the last observation carried forward method. RESULTS: The percentage of
      patients meeting a priori response criteria (> or = 50% decrease from baseline in
      mean HDRS-17 total score) was significant for both topiramate (56%) and bupropion
      SR (59%) [t(17) = 2.542, p = 0.04 and t(17) = 2.661, p = 0.03, respectively].
      Baseline demographic and clinical parameters were comparable between the two
      treatment groups. The mean doses of study medication were 176 mg/day (SD = 102
      mg/day) for the topiramate-treated group and 250 mg/day (SD = 133 mg/day) for the
      bupropion SR-treated group. A significant and comparable reduction in depressive 
      symptoms was observed from baseline to endpoint following topiramate and
      bupropion SR treatment, according to a > or = 50% reduction in the HDRS-17. Total
      mean HDRS-17 scores significantly decreased from baseline to endpoint in both
      groups (p = 0.001), however, differences between the topiramate-treated group and
      the bupropion SR-treated group were not significant [t(36) = 1.754, p = 0.097].
      Both topiramate and bupropion SR were generally well tolerated. Thirteen patients
      discontinued the study: 2 because of lack of efficacy, 1 due to withdrawal of
      consent and 10 following side-effects (six in the topiramate and four in the
      bupropion SR-treated group). There were no cases of affective switch in either
      arm. Weight loss was experienced by patients in both groups (mean weight loss at 
      endpoint was 1.2 kg in bupropion SR and 5.8 kg in topiramate) [t(17) = 2.325, p =
      0.061 and t(17) = 2.481, p = 0.043, respectively]. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary
      data suggest that adjunctive topiramate may reduce depressive symptom severity in
      acute bipolar depression. The antidepressant efficacy of this compound requires
      confirmation via double-blind placebo controlled investigation.

TI  - Comparison of caudal and intravenous clonidine in the prevention of agitation
      after sevoflurane in children.
PG  - 790-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: In children, sevoflurane anaesthesia is associated with
      postanaesthetic agitation, which is treated mainly with opioids. We compared the 
      effectiveness of epidural and i.v. clonidine in the prevention of this
      postanaesthetic agitation. METHODS: Eighty children aged 3-8 yr (ASA I-II)
      received standardized general anaesthesia with inhaled sevoflurane and caudal
      epidural block with 0.175% bupivacaine 1 ml kg-1 for minor surgery. The children 
      were assigned randomly to four groups: (I) clonidine 1 microgram kg-1 added to
      caudal bupivacaine; (II) clonidine 3 micrograms kg-1 added to caudal bupivacaine;
      (III) clonidine 3 micrograms kg-1 i.v. and caudal bupivacaine; and (IV) caudal
      block with bupivacaine, no clonidine (control). A blinded observer assessed the
      behaviour of the children during the first postoperative hour. Secondary
      end-points were the time to fitness for discharge from the postanaesthesia care
      unit, and haemodynamic and respiratory variables. RESULTS: The incidence of
      agitation was 22, 0, 5 and 39% in groups I, II, III and IV respectively (P < 0.05
      for groups II and III compared with group IV). During the first hour after
      surgery, patients in groups II and III had significantly lower scores for
      agitation than group IV patients. Time to fitness for discharge did not differ
      between the four groups. CONCLUSIONS: Clonidine 3 micrograms kg-1 prevented
      agitation after sevoflurane anaesthesia, independently of the route of
      administration. The effect of clonidine appears to be dose-dependent, as an
      epidural dose of 1 microgram kg-1 failed to reduce it.

TI  - Chronic daily headache prophylaxis with tizanidine: a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, multicenter outcome study.
PG  - 470-82
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of tizanidine hydrochloride versus placebo as
      adjunctive prophylactic therapy for chronic daily headache (chronic migraine,
      migrainous headache, or tension-type headache). BACKGROUND: Tizanidine is an
      alpha2-adrenergic agonist that inhibits the release of norepinephrine at both the
      spinal cord and brain, with antinociceptive effects that are independent of the
      endogenous opioid system. Previous open-label studies have suggested the drug may
      be effective for treatment of chronic daily headache. METHODS: Two hundred
      patients completed a 4-week, single-blind, placebo baseline period, with 134
      fulfilling selection criteria and then randomized to tizanidine or placebo.
      Ninety-two patients completed at least 8 weeks of treatment (tizanidine, n = 45; 
      placebo, n = 47), and 85 patients completed 12 weeks of treatment (tizanidine, n 
      = 44; placebo, n = 41). Most patients (77%) met the diagnostic criteria for
      migraine of the International Headache Society; 23% had either chronic migrainous
      headache or chronic tension-type headache. Tizanidine was slowly titrated over 4 
      weeks to 24 mg or the maximum dose tolerated (mean, 18 mg; SD, 6.4; median, 20.0;
      range, 2 to 24), divided equally over three dose intervals per day. Overall
      headache index ([headache days x average intensity x duration in hours]/28 days) 
      was the primary end point. RESULTS: Tizanidine was shown to be superior to
      placebo in reducing the overall headache index (P =.0025), as well as mean
      headache days per week (P =.0193), severe headache days per week (P =.0211),
      average headache intensity (P =.0108), peak headache intensity (P =.0020), and
      mean headache duration (P =.0127). The mean percentage improvement during the
      last 4 weeks of treatment with tizanidine versus placebo was 54% versus 19% for
      the headache index (P =.0144), 55% versus 21% for severe headache days (P
      =.0331), 35% versus 19% for headache duration (P =.0142), 35% versus 20% for peak
      headache intensity (P =.0106), 33% versus 20% for average headache intensity (P
      =.0281), and 30% versus 22% for total headache days (P =.0593). Patients
      receiving tizanidine also scored higher ratings of overall headache improvement
      on a visual analog scale (P =.0069). There was no statistically significant
      difference in outcome for patients with chronic migraine versus those with only
      migrainous or tension-type headache. Adverse effects reported by more than 10% of
      the patients included somnolence (47%), dizziness (24%), dry mouth (23%), and
      asthenia (19%). Dropouts due to adverse events did not differ significantly
      between tizanidine and placebo. CONCLUSIONS: The results support tizanidine as an
      effective prophylactic adjunct for chronic daily headache, including migraine,
      migrainous headache, and tension-type headache. These results also suggest the
      possible importance of an alpha2-adrenergic mechanism underlying the
      pathophysiology of this spectrum of headache disorders.

      (Adderall XR) in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - 258-66
AB  - OBJECTIVE: SLI381 (Adderall XR) is a 2-component extended-release capsule
      formulation of Adderall designed to produce a therapeutic effect that lasts
      throughout the day with 1 morning dose. The primary objective of this study was
      to assess the efficacy and safety of SLI381 compared with placebo in the
      treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children in a
      naturalistic school and home setting. A secondary objective was to assess the
      diurnal variation in responses based on morning and afternoon assessments.
      METHODS: A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group,
      placebo-controlled trial was conducted at 47 sites. After a 1-week washout of any
      previous stimulant medication, patients were randomized to receive single-daily
      morning doses of placebo or SLI381 10 mg, 20 mg, or 30 mg for 3 weeks.
      Participants aged 6 to 12 years inclusive who satisfied Diagnostic and
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria diagnosis of ADHD
      were included. The primary efficacy parameter was the Conners Global Index Scale 
      for Teachers. Secondary efficacy parameters included the Conners Global Index
      Scale for Parents, the Clinical Global Impressions Scale for improvement, and the
      Parent Global Assessment for improvement. Safety was assessed by recording
      adverse events, laboratory tests, and vital signs at each visit during the study.
      Physical examinations and electrocardiograms were performed at the screening and 
      the end of the study. RESULTS: Five hundred eighty-four children were randomized,
      563 were included in the intent-to-treat population, and 509 completed the entire
      study. Intention-to-treat analysis of Conners Global Index Scale for Teachers and
      Conners Global Index Scale for Parents scores revealed significant improvement in
      morning, afternoon, and late afternoon behavior for all active treatment groups
      versus placebo. All active treatment groups showed significant dose-related
      improvement in behavior from baseline. Both the Clinical Global Impressions Scale
      for improvement and Parent Global Assessment for improvement showed all doses of 
      SLI381 to be superior to placebo at treatment end and both confirmed the
      dose-response relationship between improvement and the SLI381 dose. The incidence
      of spontaneously reported adverse events was low and similar for active
      treatments and placebo. CONCLUSIONS: SLI381 produced consistent, dose-related
      improvements on all measures of efficacy. The extended-release nature of the
      SLI381 formulation was shown by continued, significant improvement in afternoon
      assessments by teachers and afternoon and late afternoon assessments by parents. 
      The time course and therapeutic effects of SLI381 suggests that this medication
      is an efficacious once-daily treatment for children with ADHD.

      diabetes among patients with schizophrenia: population based nested case-control 
      study.
PG  - 243
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To quantify the association between olanzapine and diabetes. DESIGN:
      Population based nested case-control study. SETTING: United Kingdom based General
      Practice Research Database comprising 3.5 million patients followed between 1987 
      and 2000. PARTICIPANTS: 19 637 patients who had been diagnosed as having and
      treated for schizophrenia. 451 incident cases of diabetes were matched with 2696 
      controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diagnosis and treatment of diabetes. RESULTS:
      Patients taking olanzapine had a significantly increased risk of developing
      diabetes than non-users of antipsychotics (odds ratio 5.8, 95% confidence
      interval 2.0 to 16.7) and those taking conventional antipsychotics (4.2, 1.5 to
      12.2). Patients taking risperidone had a non-significant increased risk of
      developing diabetes than non-users of antipsychotics (2.2, 0.9 to 5.2) and those 
      taking conventional antipsychotics (1.6, 0.7 to 3.8). CONCLUSION: Olanzapine is
      associated with a clinically important and significant increased risk of
      diabetes.

TI  - Double-blind, placebo-controlled study of risperidone for the treatment of
      disruptive behaviors in children with subaverage intelligence.
PG  - 1337-46
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The short-term efficacy and safety of risperidone in the treatment of 
      disruptive behaviors was examined in a well-characterized cohort of children with
      subaverage intelligence. METHOD: In this 6-week, multicenter, double-blind,
      parallel-group study of 118 children (aged 5-12 years) with severely disruptive
      behaviors and subaverage intelligence (IQ between 36 and 84, inclusive), the
      subjects received 0.02-0.06 mg/kg per day of risperidone oral solution or
      placebo. The a priori primary efficacy measure was the change in score from
      baseline to endpoint on the conduct problem subscale of the Nisonger Child
      Behavior Rating Form. RESULTS: The risperidone group showed significantly greater
      improvement than did the placebo group on the conduct problem subscale of the
      Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form from week 1 through endpoint (change in score
      of -15.2 and -6.2, respectively). Risperidone was also associated with
      significantly greater improvement than placebo on all other Nisonger Child
      Behavior Rating Form subscales at endpoint, as well as on the Aberrant Behavior
      Checklist subscales for irritability, lethargy/social withdrawal, and
      hyperactivity; the Behavior Problems Inventory aggressive/destructive behavior
      subscale; a visual analogue scale of the most troublesome symptom; and the
      Clinical Global Impression change score. The most common adverse effects reported
      during risperidone treatment were headache and somnolence. The extrapyramidal
      symptom profile of risperidone was comparable to that of placebo. Mean weight
      increases of 2.2 kg. and 0.9 kg occurred in the risperidone and placebo groups,
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Risperidone was effective and well tolerated for the
      treatment of severely disruptive behaviors in children with subaverage IQ.

TI  - Effects of methylphenidate on functional magnetic resonance relaxometry of the
      cerebellar vermis in boys with ADHD.
PG  - 1322-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test 
      the effects of methylphenidate on steady-state blood volume in the midline vermis
      of the cerebellum in boys with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
      This region was selected as it has been observed to be significantly smaller in
      children with ADHD. Also, in preclinical studies, the vermis has been shown to
      modulate forebrain dopamine systems, to influence locomotor activity, and to
      contain a significant density of dopamine transporters. METHOD: T(2) relaxometry 
      was used to indirectly assess blood volume in the cerebellum (hemispheres and
      midline vermis) of 10 boys with ADHD who were administered placebo or one of
      three different doses of methylphenidate continuously for 1 week. T(2) relaxation
      time values are inversely proportional to local cerebral blood volume. After each
      week of treatment, and within 1-3 hours of the boys' afternoon dose, testing for 
      drug efficacy was performed by using objective measures of activity. RESULTS:
      Moderate and high doses of methylphenidate increased T(2) relaxation time in a
      rate-dependent manner-increasing T(2) relaxation time in the most active children
      with ADHD and reducing T(2) relaxation time in subjects with ADHD who were not
      objectively hyperactive. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study supports a role for 
      the vermis in ADHD and suggests that further research is needed to clarify the
      relationship between vermal size, vermal blood flow, stimulant response, and the 
      developmental pathophysiology of ADHD.

TI  - Spotlight on ziprasidone in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.
PG  - 645-52
AB  - Ziprasidone is a novel antipsychotic agent with a pharmacological profile
      distinct from that of other currently available novel or classical
      antipsychotics. In preclinical studies, ziprasidone was predicted to have
      efficacy against positive, negative and affective symptoms of schizophrenia with 
      a favourable tolerability profile, including a low propensity to induce
      extrapyramidal adverse effects. The drug has been administered orally to >300
      patients with an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder 
      in published 4- to 6-week randomised, double-blind trials. When given twice daily
      at dosages of between 80 and 160 mg/day, ziprasidone produced significantly
      greater improvements in overall symptomatology than placebo. In the largest
      study, ziprasidone 80 or 160 mg/day was also significantly more effective than
      placebo in reducing negative symptoms and, at 160 mg/day, was significantly more 
      effective than placebo in improving depressive symptoms in patients with
      associated clinically significant depression. Data from a 4-week trial indicate
      that ziprasidone 160 mg/day has similar efficacy to haloperidol 15 mg/day.
      Ziprasidone 40 to 160 mg/day was more effective than placebo with respect to
      prevention of impending relapse and improvement of negative symptoms in 294
      stable patients with chronic schizophrenia who were treated for up to 1 year. In 
      addition, significantly more ziprasidone than haloperidol recipients achieved a
      negative symptom response in a 28-week study involving 301 stable patients with
      chronic or subchronic schizophrenia. In general, oral ziprasidone is well
      tolerated with an overall incidence of adverse events similar to placebo.
      Importantly, the drug has a low propensity to induce extrapyramidal effects and a
      negligible effect on bodyweight. Ziprasidone is associated with slight
      prolongation of the QTc interval; the clinical significance of this is not yet
      clear. The drug does not appear to be associated with sustained elevation of
      plasma prolactin levels. Preliminary data indicate that long-term oral
      ziprasidone treatment is well tolerated. Ziprasidone is the only novel
      antipsychotic currently available in a rapid-acting intramuscular formulation.
      Short-term treatment with intramuscular ziprasidone was effective and well
      tolerated in patients with acute agitation associated with psychosis. In
      addition, intramuscular ziprasidone reduced agitation scores by a significantly
      greater extent than haloperidol in a study involving patients with acute
      agitation associated with psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: Ziprasidone is a promising new 
      antipsychotic that has shown significant efficacy in the oral treatment of
      patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The drug is well
      tolerated with a low propensity to induce extrapyramidal effects and a negligible
      effect on bodyweight. In addition, intramuscular ziprasidone shows efficacy and
      good tolerability in the treatment of acute agitation associated with psychotic
      disorders.

TI  - Risperidone in children with autism and serious behavioral problems.
PG  - 314-21
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atypical antipsychotic agents, which block postsynaptic dopamine and 
      serotonin receptors, have advantages over traditional antipsychotic medications
      in the treatment of adults with schizophrenia and may be beneficial in children
      with autistic disorder who have serious behavioral disturbances. However, data on
      the safety and efficacy of atypical antipsychotic agents in children are limited.
      METHODS: We conducted a multisite, randomized, double-blind trial of risperidone 
      as compared with placebo for the treatment of autistic disorder accompanied by
      severe tantrums, aggression, or self-injurious behavior in children 5 to 17 years
      old. The primary outcome measures were the score on the Irritability subscale of 
      the Aberrant Behavior Checklist and the rating on the Clinical Global Impressions
      - Improvement (CGI-I) scale at eight weeks. RESULTS: A total of 101 children (82 
      boys and 19 girls; mean [+/-SD] age, 8.8+/-2.7 years) were randomly assigned to
      receive risperidone (49 children) or placebo (52). Treatment with risperidone for
      eight weeks (dose range, 0.5 to 3.5 mg per day) resulted in a 56.9 percent
      reduction in the Irritability score, as compared with a 14.1 percent decrease in 
      the placebo group (P<0.001). The rate of a positive response, defined as at least
      a 25 percent decrease in the Irritability score and a rating of much improved or 
      very much improved on the CGI-I scale, was 69 percent in the risperidone group
      (34 of 49 children had a positive response) and 12 percent in the placebo group
      (6 of 52, P<0.001). Risperidone therapy was associated with an average weight
      gain of 2.7+/-2.9 kg, as compared with 0.8+/-2.2 kg with placebo (P<0.001).
      Increased appetite, fatigue, drowsiness, dizziness, and drooling were more common
      in the risperidone group than in the placebo group (P<0.05 for each comparison). 
      In two thirds of the children with a positive response to risperidone at eight
      weeks (23 of 34), the benefit was maintained at six months. CONCLUSIONS:
      Risperidone was effective and well tolerated for the treatment of tantrums,
      aggression, or self-injurious behavior in children with autistic disorder. The
      short period of this trial limits inferences about adverse effects such as
      tardive dyskinesia.

TI  - Switching to olanzapine from previous antipsychotics: a regional collaborative
      multicenter trial assessing 2 switching techniques in Asia Pacific.
PG  - 569-76
AB  - BACKGROUND: This open-label, multicenter, randomized study compared the efficacy 
      and safety of switching moderately ill Asian patients with schizophrenia from
      their current regimen of antipsychotic medication to the atypical antipsychotic
      olanzapine using either a direct switch method or a start-taper switch method.
      METHOD: Asian inpatients and outpatients with DSM-IV schizophrenia (N = 108)
      currently treated with predominantly typical antipsychotics were switched to
      olanzapine (initial dose of 10 mg/day) for 6 weeks. Patients were randomly
      assigned to 1 of 2 groups: the direct switch group (N = 54) received only
      olanzapine, while the start-taper switch group (N = 54) received olanzapine and
      their usual antipsychotic in decreasing doses for the first 2 weeks. A successful
      switch was defined as completing 6 weeks of therapy without worsening of symptoms
      (Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale [CGI-S]) or extrapyramidal
      side effects (Simpson-Angus Scale). Overall efficacy was assessed using the
      Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), and safety was assessed by
      recording adverse events and measuring vital signs. RESULTS: Statistically
      significant (p < .001) improvements from baseline to endpoint occurred in both
      switch groups in the CGI-S score and the PANSS total score and subscores.
      However, no significant differences were observed between the switch groups for
      any efficacy measure. Both techniques had comparable rates of successful
      switching (direct switch, 74.1% vs. start-taper switch, 67.9%). The frequency of 
      treatment-emergent adverse events was similar between switch groups with no
      clinically significant differences in any laboratory value or vital sign. Weight 
      gain occurred in both switch groups (p < .001), but the groups were not
      statistically different from each other. Both switch groups showed statistically 
      significant (p < .01) improvements from baseline to endpoint on the Simpson-Angus
      Scale and Barnes Akathisia Scale. CONCLUSION: Moderately ill Asian patients with 
      schizophrenia may experience a decrease in symptom severity and improvement in
      extrapyramidal symptoms when switched from their current medication to olanzapine
      therapy.

TI  - Efficacy of Adderall for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: a
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 69-75
AB  - Stimulant medication has, for many years, been the pharmacological treatment of
      choice for children and adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder
      (ADHD). Several studies have shown Adderall , to be efficacious for measures of
      inattention, hyperactivity-impulsivity, aggression, disruptive behavior, and
      academic productivity. Although these studies provide useful information for
      clinicians treating ADHD children and adults, the variability in efficacy among
      the different types of measures used within each study has not been
      comprehensively examined. Thus, to provide a clearer picture of what conclusions 
      can be drawn from these studies, we performed a meta-analysis. Data from the six 
      available studies of standard release Adderall show it to be efficacious for
      symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity-impulsivity, and aggression, as well as
      global ratings. Its efficacy was significant for clinician, parent, and teacher
      ratings, and for both fixed- and best-dose designs.

TI  - Postoperative pain relief following intrathecal bupivacaine combined with
      intrathecal or oral clonidine.
PG  - 806-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the postoperative
      analgesic and adverse effects of equal doses of oral or intrathecal clonidine in 
      spinal anaesthesia with bupivacaine plain. METHODS: Forty-five ASA I-III
      orthopaedic patients scheduled for osteosynthesis of a traumatic femur fracture
      were randomised in a double-blind fashion to one of 3 groups. Patients received
      15 mg of plain bupivacaine intrathecally (group B) or an intrathecal mixture of
      bupivacaine 15 mg and clonidine 150 mg (group CIT). In group CPO oral clonidine
      150 mg was administered 60 min before intrathecal injection of bupivacaine 15 mg.
      RESULTS: Oral and intrathecal clonidine prolonged the time until the first
      request for analgesics, 313 +/- 29 and 337 +/- 29 min, respectively, vs. 236 +/- 
      27 min in group B (P < 0.01). The total 24- h PCA morphine dose was significantly
      lower in group CIT(19.3 +/- 1.3 mg) compared to groups B and CPO(33.4 +/- 2.0 and
      31.2 +/- 3.1 mg). MAP was decreased significantly during the first hour after
      intrathecal clonidine(14%) and during the first 5 h after oral clonidine(14-19%).
      HR decreased in CIT during the 5th and 6th postoperative hours(7-9%) and during
      the first 2 h(9%) in CPO (P < 0.01). The degree of sedation was more pronounced
      in group CPO during the first 3 h. Four patients had pruritus in group B.
      CONCLUSIONS: Addition of intrathecal clonidine prolonged analgesia and decreased 
      morphine consumption postoperatively more than oral clonidine. Hypotension was
      more pronounced after oral than after intrathecal clonidine. Intrathecal
      clonidine is therefore recommended.

TI  - Cell-mediated immune response in MDMA users after repeated dose administration:
      studies in controlled versus noncontrolled settings.
PG  - 421-33
AB  - Acute administration of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, "ecstasy")
      produces time-dependent immune dysfunction in humans. Recreational use of MDMA
      generally includes repeated drug consumption, often in association with other
      drugs, such as alcohol and cannabis. In the laboratory setting, repeated MDMA
      administration to healthy MDMA consumers produced a time-dependent immune
      dysfunction similar to that observed with the ingestion of a single dose, and the
      first of the two administrations paralleled the time-course of MDMA-induced
      cortisol stimulation kinetics and MDMA plasma concentrations. A significant
      decrease in CD4 T-helper cells with simultaneous increase in natural killer (NK) 
      cell and a decrease in functional responsiveness of lymphocytes to mitogenic
      stimulation was observed. Response to the second dose was either long-lasting
      compared with the first dose or disproportionate and did not show any parallelism
      with cortisol and MDMA plasma concentrations. This circumstance extended the
      critical period during which immunocompetence is highly impaired as a result of
      MDMA use. Accumulation of MDMA in the body of a poor metabolizer induced higher
      immunomodulatory effects with statistically significant differences in NK cell
      function compared with extensive metabolizers. When basal values of lymphocyte
      subsets were examined in a population of recreational MDMA users participating in
      different clinical trials, alterations in several immunological parameters were
      observed. The absolute number of lymphocytes, in particular T lymphocytes and CD4
      T-helper cell subsets, showed a trend toward reduced values, although cell counts
      were within normal limits. By contrast, NK cells in MDMA consumers were reduced
      to one-third of those from healthy persons. A statistically significant decrease 
      in affected immune parameters was recorded during a 2-year observation period in 
      a subgroup of recreational MDMA users. These permanent alterations in immunologic
      homeostasis may result in impairment of general health and subsequent increased
      susceptibility to infection and immune-related disorders.

TI  - Combination of a mood stabilizer with risperidone or haloperidol for treatment of
      acute mania: a double-blind, placebo-controlled comparison of efficacy and
      safety.
PG  - 1146-54
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study assessed the efficacy and safety of risperidone as an
      adjunctive agent to mood stabilizers in the treatment of acute mania. METHOD:
      This 3-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study included 156
      bipolar disorder patients with a current manic or mixed episode who received a
      mood stabilizer (lithium or divalproex) and placebo, risperidone, or haloperidol.
      The primary efficacy measure was the Young Mania Rating Scale. Other assessments 
      used the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, the Clinical Global Impression scale,
      and safety measures. RESULTS: The trial was discontinued by 25 (49%) of the 51
      placebo group patients, 18 (35%) of the 52 risperidone group patients, and 28
      (53%) of the 53 haloperidol group patients. Mean modal doses were 3.8 mg/day
      (SD=1.8) of risperidone and 6.2 mg/day (SD=2.9) of haloperidol. Significantly
      greater reductions in Young Mania Rating Scale scores at endpoint and over time
      were seen in the risperidone group and in the haloperidol group, compared with
      the placebo group. Young Mania Rating Scale total scores improved with
      risperidone and with haloperidol both in patients with psychotic features and in 
      those without psychotic features at baseline. Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale
      total scores at endpoint were significantly higher in the haloperidol patients
      than in the placebo patients. Antiparkinsonian medications were received by 8%,
      17%, and 38% of patients in the placebo, risperidone, and haloperidol groups,
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Risperidone plus a mood stabilizer was more
      efficacious than a mood stabilizer alone, and as efficacious as haloperidol plus 
      a mood stabilizer, for the rapid control of manic symptoms and was well
      tolerated.

TI  - Prevalence of obesity, lipid and glucose abnormalities in outpatients prescribed 
      clozapine.
PG  - 119-20
AB  - Individuals with schizophrenia have standardised mortality rates which are double
      that of the general population. In addition to suicide, high rates of
      cardiovascular and respiratory disease contribute to this raised mortality rate. 
      Although clozapine has been reported to improve psychotic symptoms and decrease
      suicide rates, attention has recently focussed on its potential to increase
      cardiovascular risk factors including obesity, dyslipidemia and diabetes
      mellitus. This study aimed to ascertain the prevalence of these risk factors in a
      cohort of Irish outpatients treated with clozapine.

TI  - Children with ADHD and motor dysfunction compared with children with ADHD only.
PG  - 383-90
AB  - The purpose of this study was to identify group differences in children with
      attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder and motor dysfunction (ADHD-MD) and ADHD
      only, and to evaluate the medication responsiveness of ADHD-MD. Sixty-three
      children (49 males and 14 females; mean age 9 years 10 months, SD 2 years 10
      months) underwent a triple blind, placebo-controlled crossover study evaluating
      two dose levels of methylphenidate (0.3 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg [DOSAGE ERROR
      CORRECTED], twice daily) and placebo. Forty-nine trials were completed. Nineteen 
      were children with ADHD-MD, 44 had ADHD only. Behavior and functioning were
      assessed at home and at school. Treatment effects were assessed using the
      Abbreviated Symptom Questionnaire for Parents and Teachers. Children with ADHD-MD
      were more likely to have severe ADHD-combined type and other neurodevelopmental
      and behavioral problems. Both groups of children had a linear dose response to
      medication (placebo, low, high) and there was no evidence of a group by dose
      interaction or an overall group effect at home or school. The lack of group
      effect suggests that these children responded to medication like the other
      subgroups.

TI  - A 28-week comparison of ziprasidone and haloperidol in outpatients with stable
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 516-23
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ziprasidone is a novel antipsychotic with a unique pharmacologic
      profile. This study compared ziprasidone with the conventional antipsychotic
      haloperidol in outpatients with stable schizophrenia. METHOD: Three hundred one
      outpatients with stable chronic or subchronic schizophrenia (DSM-III-R) were
      randomized and participated in this double-blind, multicenter, parallel-group
      clinical study comparing flexible-dose oral ziprasidone, 80-160 mg/day (N = 148),
      with haloperidol, 5-15 mg/day (N = 153), over 28 weeks. Patients were assessed
      using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Clinical Global
      Impressions-Severity of Illness scale, the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating
      Scale, the Simpson-Angus Scale, the Barnes Akathisia Scale, and the Abnormal
      Involuntary Movement Scale. RESULTS: Modal doses at endpoint were 80 mg/day for
      ziprasidone and 5 mg/day for haloperidol. Improvements in all mean efficacy
      variables with both ziprasidone and haloperidol were observed. Significantly more
      patients were categorized as negative symptom responders (> or = 20% reduction in
      PANSS negative subscale score) in the ziprasidone group (48%) compared with the
      haloperidol group (33%) (p < .05). Ziprasidone had clear advantages over
      haloperidol in all evaluations of movement disorders. Changes in body weight were
      negligible with both treatments. No pattern of laboratory or cardiovascular
      changes was observed. CONCLUSION: Ziprasidone and haloperidol were both effective
      in reducing overall psychopathology; ziprasidone demonstrated effective treatment
      of negative symptoms and was better tolerated than haloperidol. Ziprasidone
      appears to offer an effective alternative to haloperidol in the long-term
      treatment of stable outpatients with schizophrenia.

TI  - Newer atypical antipsychotic medication in comparison to clozapine: a systematic 
      review of randomized trials.
PG  - 1-10
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of newer atypical
      antipsychotic drugs in comparison to clozapine for schizophrenia. Publications in
      all languages were searched from all relevant databases and all randomized
      controlled trials comparing clozapine with newer atypical drugs were included.
      The review and meta-analysis includes eight studies, most of them short in
      duration. Newer atypical drugs were broadly similar to clozapine when improvement
      was measured using a psychosis symptom rating scale or a global index. There was 
      a trend for clozapine to be more effective than the others for positive symptoms,
      and less effective for the negative symptoms. The adverse effect profile of
      clozapine and newer atypical drugs was dissimilar: while clozapine produced more 
      fatigue, hypersalivation, and orthostatic dizziness, new atypical drugs, with the
      exception of olanzapine, produced more extrapyramidal symptoms. As these results 
      were obtained from few studies and a relatively small amount of patients, the
      equal effectiveness and tolerability of new atypical drugs in comparison with
      clozapine is not yet demonstrated. More trials of sufficient power, with longer
      duration, and measuring clinically important outcomes are urgently needed.

TI  - A placebo controlled trial of bupropion for smoking cessation in schizophrenia.
PG  - 53-61
AB  - BACKGROUND: Schizophrenic patients have high rates of cigarette smoking compared 
      with the general population. We compared sustained-release (SR) bupropion with
      placebo for smoking cessation in patients with schizophrenic disorders. We also
      examined how antipsychotic class predicts smoking cessation outcomes with
      bupropion. METHODS: Thirty-two subjects meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia
      or schizoaffective disorder and nicotine dependence were randomized to bupropion 
      SR (BUP, 300 mg/day) or placebo (PLA). Outcomes included treatment retention,
      smoking abstinence rates, expired breath carbon monoxide (CO) levels, psychotic
      symptoms, and medication side effects. RESULTS: Bupropion significantly increased
      trial endpoint 7-day point prevalence smoking abstinence rates compared with
      placebo [BUP, 8/16 (50.0%), PLA, 2/16 (12.5%); chi(2) = 5.24, df = 1, p <.05],
      and reduced CO levels during the trial [Medication x Time interaction; Z = 3.09, 
      p <.01]. Positive schizophrenia symptoms were not altered by BUP, but negative
      symptoms were significantly reduced. Atypical antipsychotic drug treatment
      enhanced smoking cessation responses to BUP. Major side effects were dry mouth,
      gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, and insomnia. CONCLUSIONS: Our results
      suggest that 1) BUP enhances smoking abstinence rates compared with PLA in
      nicotine-dependent schizophrenic smokers; 2) BUP is well-tolerated and safe for
      use in these patients; and 3) atypical antipsychotics may enhance smoking
      cessation outcomes with BUP.

AB  - Stimulated by Dawkins and colleagues' (1999) and Remington and Kapur's (2000)
      calls to develop clinical profiles of the new atypical antipsychotic drugs and by
      Mattes's critiques (1997, 1998), we performed two sets of analyses for
      risperidone. First, we reanalyzed data from the North American risperidone trial:
      risperidone was superior to haloperidol to an equal degree in patients with and
      without the deficit syndrome, in patients with paranoid and nonparanoid
      schizophrenia, in treatment-resistant and treatment-responsive patients (patients
      hospitalized for longer and shorter periods), and in patients with or without
      weight gain. Moreover, risperidone was more effective than haloperidol on
      symptoms nonresponsive and responsive to haloperidol; its effects on negative
      symptoms were independent of its effects on extrapyramidal symptoms; and it was
      effective in treating depression in schizophrenia. Second, we performed a
      meta-analysis of 18 controlled risperidone trials: risperidone was consistently
      more effective than conventional antipsychotics in treating positive and negative
      symptoms.

TI  - Phenomenology of and risk factors for new-onset diabetes mellitus and diabetic
      ketoacidosis associated with atypical antipsychotics: an analysis of 45 published
      cases.
PG  - 59-64
AB  - Case reports and small retrospective studies suggest that atypical antipsychotic 
      agents may be associated with new-onset Type II diabetes mellitus (DM) or
      diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA); however, these reports often provide limited or no
      information on demographic variables such as age, gender, ethnicity, relationship
      to weight gain, and time course. We analyzed 45 published cases of new-onset DM
      or DKA for which followed initiation of atypical antipsychotic treatment. Of the 
      45 patients, 20 had received clozapine, 19 olanzapine, 3 quetiapine, and 3
      risperidone. Eighty-seven percent patients were male, and 47% African American.
      Forty-two percent of these patients presented as DKA, and 50% manifested no
      weight gain at time of presentation with DM or DKA, although 84% were overweight 
      before antipsychotic therapy. Eighty-four percent presented within 6 months and
      59% within 3 months of commencing atypical antipsychotics. The DKA cohort had
      significantly younger age, less overweight at baseline, and higher proportion of 
      women than did those with DM alone, without significant differences in
      distribution of ethnicity, weight gain, family history of DM, or duration of
      exposure to atypical agents. Clinicians should be aware of the potential risks of
      new-onset DM and DKA in patients taking atypical antipsychotics, and utilize
      appropriate clinical and laboratory monitoring to prevent serious adverse events.

TI  - Improving outcome in schizophrenia: the potential importance of EPS and
      neuroleptic dysphoria.
PG  - 47-57
AB  - Despite half a century of antipsychotic drug treatment, the outcome of therapy in
      schizophrenia remains disappointing. Relapse, rehospitalization, limited
      fulfilment of social roles, and suicide remain frequent, and the economic costs
      are high. Current relapse rates may be two to three times higher than those that 
      could be achieved with optimal use of therapy. Poor compliance with treatment is 
      considered to be a significant preventable cause of poor outcome and is in turn
      likely to be influenced by the patient's experience of drug treatment. There is
      some evidence that extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), particularly akathisia and
      neuroleptic dysphoria, are associated with poor compliance and poor treatment
      outcome. Atypical antipsychotics have a lower risk of EPS than do standard
      antipsychotics. Some (risperidone, olanzapine, and ziprasidone) show evidence of 
      a dose-related increase in EPS, but clozapine and quetiapine have demonstrated a 
      placebo-level incidence of EPS across the dose range. Quetiapine does not require
      the regular blood monitoring mandated for clozapine, and results from a patient
      survey indicate a high degree of patient satisfaction with treatment. While
      further research is needed, it is possible that wider use of medications with low
      EPS and high patient acceptability could promote better compliance and improve
      the outcome of schizophrenia treatment.

TI  - Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and methylphenidate: a dose-response
      analysis and parent-child comparison of somatic complaints.
PG  - 15-24
AB  - The authors examined parent and child ratings of somatic complaints in 65
      children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) who received four
      doses (5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg) of methylphenidate (MPH) in the context of a
      double-blind, placebo controlled, within-subject (crossover) experimental design.
      Results indicated that parent and child ratings of somatic complaints decreased
      in a linear fashion from baseline levels as a function of increasing MPH dose and
      showed minimal variation across MPH conditions. Statistical comparisons of
      specific somatic complaints indicated minimal agreement between parents and
      children in contrast to the nearly identical parent-child dose-response curves.
      The paradoxical findings of fewer somatic complaints associated with MPH,
      importance of obtaining children's perceptions of MPH treatment, and implications
      for measuring somatic complaints are discussed.

TI  - Efficacy of olanzapine and risperidone for treatment-refractory schizophrenia
      among long-stay state hospital patients.
PG  - 755-7
AB  - The authors studied the efficacy of olanzapine and risperidone among patients
      with treatment-refractory schizophrenia who had been hospitalized for more than
      five years and who were not suitable candidates for a clozapine trial. The
      patients were systematically reassessed and were given olanzapine or risperidone 
      as part of a "second-chance program." The patients in both groups showed
      significant improvement in scores on the 18-item Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale
      after three months. Forty-four percent of the patients in the olanzapine group
      and 43 percent of those in the risperidone group were discharged to supervised
      residences on the basis of their clinical improvement. There is value in
      reassessing long-stay patients who have treatment-refractory schizophrenia and
      giving them systematic trials with new medications that become available.

TI  - Olanzapine-induced weight gain in patients with first-episode schizophrenia: a
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study of fluoxetine addition.
PG  - 1058-60
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Since olanzapine-induced weight gain may be attributable to the
      antagonistic activity of olanzapine at the serotonin-2C receptor, the authors
      hypothesized that it might be attenuated by addition of the selective serotonin
      reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine. METHOD: First-episode hospitalized schizophrenia
      patients (N=30) were randomly assigned in an 8-week double-blind study of
      olanzapine, 10 mg/day, coadministered with either fluoxetine, 20 mg/day (N=15),
      or placebo (N=15). RESULTS: The group receiving olanzapine plus fluoxetine showed
      significantly less improvement in positive and disorganized symptom dimensions
      than the group receiving olanzapine plus placebo. The two groups demonstrated
      similar and substantial gradual weight gains. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest 
      that fluoxetine coadministration is clinically ineffective and cannot attenuate
      olanzapine-induced weight gain.

TI  - Beneficial antipsychotic effects of celecoxib add-on therapy compared to
      risperidone alone in schizophrenia.
PG  - 1029-34
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Abnormalities in the immune system in schizophrenia have been
      described. However, important findings such as high levels of activating
      cytokines in the CSF and signs of CNS inflammation have been controversial. The
      authors conducted a trial of the new selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor
      celecoxib, an immunomodulatory drug, in schizophrenic patients to evaluate its
      therapeutic effects. METHOD: In a prospective, double-blind evaluation, 50
      patients with an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia were randomly assigned to
      either risperidone plus celecoxib or risperidone plus placebo. After a washout
      period, 25 patients received 2-6 mg/day of risperidone plus placebo and 25
      received risperidone plus 400 mg/day of celecoxib for 5 weeks. The treatment
      effect was calculated by analysis of covariance. There were no significant
      differences between groups in age, sex, duration or severity of disease or
      psychopathology, or risperidone dose or plasma level. RESULTS: Over 5 weeks, both
      groups of patients showed significant improvement in scores on the Positive and
      Negative Syndrome Scale and on all subscales. However, the celecoxib group showed
      significantly greater improvement in the total score. CONCLUSIONS: Additional
      treatment with celecoxib has significant positive effects on the therapeutic
      action of risperidone with regard to total schizophrenia psychopathology.
      Moreover, the fact that treatment with an immunomodulatory drug showed beneficial
      effects on schizophrenia symptoms indicates that immune dysfunction in
      schizophrenia is not just an epiphenomenon but is related to the pathomechanism
      of the disorder. However, a nonimmunological therapeutic effect of celecoxib
      mediated by the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor has to be taken into account.

TI  - Insomnia in children: when are hypnotics indicated?
PG  - 391-403
AB  - Insomnia in children is a nonspecific impairing symptom that may be the result of
      normal developmental changes, psychosocial duress, a sleep disorder, a
      psychiatric disorder, other medical disorders, substance misuse, or an adverse
      effect of medication. Careful clinical assessment of insomnia in children may
      include the use of symptom rating scales, laboratory testing, or other medical
      assessment. Short- and long-term treatment of insomnia in children involves
      management of etiological factors and associated syndromes. Controlled treatment 
      studies of pediatric insomnia are limited to <10 published studies of
      psychosocial and/or psychopharmacological treatment in young children. Directive 
      parent education and behavior modification techniques have been effective in
      short-term treatment of insomnia in young children, and may be the preferred
      treatment of extrinsic insomnia, as well as an important adjunctive treatment of 
      any insomnia symptoms. Two benzodiazepines [flurazepam and delorazepam
      (chlordesmethyldiazepam)], one antihistamine (niaprazine) and one phenothiazine
      [alimemazine (trimeprazine)] have been shown to be effective in the short-term
      treatment of insomnia in young children, although none of these agents have US
      Food and Drug Administration approval for pediatric insomnia. Short-acting
      benzodiazepines may have a role in the brief treatment of pediatric insomnia
      associated with an anxiety or mood disorder, psychosis, aggression, medication-
      induced activation, or anticipatory anxiety associated with a medical procedure. 
      However, tachyphylaxis and risk of misuse preclude the long-term use of
      benzodiazepines for the treatment of insomnia in children. Newer hypnotics, which
      appear better tolerated than the benzodiazepines in studies of adults, may have a
      role when combined with psychosocial treatments of pediatric insomnia. Treatment 
      of intrinsic pediatric insomnia may additionally involve chronotherapy or medical
      management.

TI  - The hypnotic and analgesic effects of oral clonidine during sevoflurane
      anesthesia in children: a dose-response study.
PG  - 1479-83, table of contents
AB  - Although clonidine has both hypnotic and analgesic actions, the dose relationship
      for each actions is still unknown in a clinical setting when clonidine is used as
      a premedication in children. We studied 80 ASA physical status I children (age
      range, 3-8 yr). Subjects were randomly divided into two groups (minimum alveolar 
      anesthetic concentration [MAC]-Awake group, n = 40; MAC-Tetanus group, n = 40).
      Each patient received one dose of clonidine from 1 to 5 microg/kg orally, 100 min
      before arrival at the operating room. Anesthesia was induced and maintained with 
      sevoflurane in oxygen and air. Before tracheal intubation, end-tidal sevoflurane 
      was decreased stepwise by 0.2% at the start of 1.2%, a verbal command was given
      to the patients, and MAC-awake was determined in each patient. We also
      investigated MAC-tetanus, determined with transcutaneous electric tetanic
      stimulations, after tracheal intubation in each patient by observing the motor
      response to a transcutaneous electric tetanic stimulus to the ulnar nerve at a
      sevoflurane concentration decreased stepwise by 0.25% at the start of 2.75%. The 
      initial reduction in MAC-tetanus was not as steep as that in MAC-awake. Clonidine
      reduced MAC-tetanus by 40% at the maximal dose of 5 microg/kg, whereas MAC-awake 
      was already reduced by 50% at 2 microg/kg. We conclude that separate
      dose-response relationships for oral clonidine are present regarding the hypnotic
      and analgesic effects in children undergoing sevoflurane anesthesia.
      IMPLICATIONS: Separate dose-response relationships for oral clonidine were found 
      regarding the hypnotic and analgesic effects in children undergoing sevoflurane
      anesthesia.

TI  - Effect on body weight of bupropion sustained-release in patients with major
      depression treated for 52 weeks.
PG  - 662-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: Short-term studies have demonstrated a modest weight-reducing to
      weight-neutral effect among patients receiving bupropion sustained-release (SR)
      for the treatment of depression. OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to evaluate 
      the long-term effects of bupropion SR on body weight in patients with depression.
      METHODS: This analysis was conducted within a long-term relapse-prevention study 
      in patients with major depression. Those whose depression had responded to
      open-label treatment with bupropion SR were randomized to 44 weeks of
      double-blind treatment with bupropion SR 300 mg/d or placebo. Patients were
      categorized by body mass index (BMI) as follows: BMI < 22, BMI 22 to 26, BMI > or
      = 27, and BMI > or = 30. RESULTS: Four hundred twenty-three patients were
      enrolled in the double-blind phase of the study, 210 receiving bupropion SR and
      213 receiving placebo. At the end of the open-label phase, the following mean
      weight losses were seen in the 4 BMI groups: BMI < 22, 0.5 kg; BMI 22 to 26, 1.1 
      kg; and BMI > or = 27 and BMI > or = 30, 1.8 kg each. At the end of double-blind 
      treatment, mean change-from-baseline weights were as follows: BMI < 22, -0.1 kg; 
      BMI 22 to 26, -0.6 kg; BMI > or = 27, -1.4 kg; and BMI > or = 30, -2.4 kg. The
      rate of change in body weight during the double-blind phase was statistically
      significant compared with baseline BMI (P < 0.001, analysis of covariance).
      CONCLUSIONS: Modest mean weight losses that increased with increasing baseline
      body weight were observed with long-term bupropion SR treatment. The findings of 
      this analysis suggest that bupropion SR may be an appropriate therapeutic option 
      in normal-weight or overweight patients with depression who are concerned about
      weight gain.

TI  - Nicotine dependence: the role for antidepressants and anxiolytics.
PG  - 262-71
AB  - The addictive nature of cigarette smoking has been appreciated only in the past
      two decades. Prior to the publication of DSM-III in 1980, excessive tobacco use
      had not been considered as a psychiatric problem requiring treatment [1]. Smoking
      has been recognized as a serious medical problem since thefirst Surgeon General's
      Report on Smoking and Health in 1964. An important development during the 10 to
      20 years following this report was the growth of knowledge regarding the
      physiological effects of regular tobacco use and the importance of nicotine as
      the main pharmacological ingredient in tobacco. This body of information
      culminated in the 1988 Surgeon General's Report, which recognized chronic tobacco
      use as a form of addictive behavior [2]. Nicotine, like other drugs of abuse, has
      reinforcing psychoactive effects that lead to its repeated self-administration.
      Nicotine stimulates the release of several neurotransmitters including dopamine, 
      norepinephrine, acetylcholine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid
      (GABA) and endorphins [3]. Through its effects on the dopaminergic, or 'reward', 
      system, nicotine exerts psychoactive effects such as an increased sense of
      enjoyment. The norepinephrinergic effects of nicotine may account for increased
      attentiveness and improved performance in repetitive tasks, while its anxiolytic 
      effects are likely mediated through GABA and the endorphins.

TI  - A retrospective comparison of weight, lipid, and glucose changes between
      risperidone- and olanzapine-treated inpatients: metabolic outcomes after 1 year.
PG  - 425-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: Metabolic side effects have been increasingly noted during therapy
      with novel antipsychotics, but there is a dearth of comprehensive comparative
      data in this area. The goal of this retrospective study was to examine the
      changes in weight parameters, fasting glucose, and fasting lipids in long-term
      inpatients treated with either risperidone or olanzapine. METHOD: A retrospective
      study was performed by reviewing charts of patients at Oregon State Hospital,
      Salem, who were treated during July and August 1999, comparing metabolic outcomes
      during the first year of therapy with either risperidone or olanzapine. Data were
      analyzed also by age, sex, and concurrent use of lithium or valproate. Included
      for analysis were patients at least 18 years old with baseline weights obtained
      within 3 weeks of drug initiation, and baseline fasting triglycerides,
      cholesterol, and glucose obtained within 3 months prior to drug initiation and at
      1 year of treatment (+/- 4 weeks). The patients meeting these criteria in each
      drug cohort (risperidone, N = 47; olanzapine, N = 47) included 1 patient with
      diagnosed diabetes mellitus prior to onset of treatment. RESULTS: Among those
      patients under 60 years old, olanzapine patients (N = 37) experienced
      significantly greater increases at 1 year in all metabolic parameters than the
      risperidone group (N = 39), except for weight variables: triglycerides +104.8
      mg/dL (olanzapine) versus +31.7 mg/dL (risperidone) (p = .037); cholesterol +30.7
      mg/dL (olanzapine) versus +7.2 mg/dL (risperidone) (p = .004); glucose +10.8
      mg/dL (olanzapine) versus +0.74 mg/dL (risperidone) (p = .030). Patients under 60
      years of age with concurrent use of lithium or valproate were associated with
      greater weight gain in both drug groups, but this difference was statistically
      significant only for the olanzapine cohort. Neither weight change nor use of
      lithium or valproate was associated with increases in glucose or lipids among
      those under 60 years old for either drug. CONCLUSION: Olanzapine therapy is
      associated with significantly greater increases in fasting glucose and lipid
      levels for nongeriatric adult patients than risperidone, and the increases are
      not correlated with changes in weight parameters. Appropriate monitoring of
      fasting glucose and serum lipid levels should be considered during extended
      treatment with atypical antipsychotics.

TI  - Clinical predictors of response to clozapine treatment in ambulatory patients
      with schizophrenia.
PG  - 420-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the advent of new atypical antipsychotics, clozapine remains 
      an important option in the treatment of patients with poor response to
      conventional antipsychotics. Clinicians would be well served if clinical
      characteristics could be identified that predict a favorable response to
      clozapine. A few studies addressing this issue have reported inconsistent
      results. METHOD: The association of clinical characteristics with a sustained
      response was investigated in 37 partially treatment-refractory outpatients with a
      DSM-III-R diagnosis of chronic schizophrenia who had been assigned to clozapine
      treatment in a double-blind, haloperidol-controlled, long-term (29-week) study of
      clozapine. Response was defined as a 20% decrease of the Brief Psychiatric Rating
      Scale (BPRS) psychosis factor score sustained over 2 consecutive ratings.
      Differences between responders and nonresponders with regard to selected baseline
      variables were analyzed with t tests and chi2 tests. In addition, Cox regression 
      analyses were performed to identify variables that best predicted a response to
      clozapine treatment. RESULTS: Clozapine responders were rated as less severely
      ill, showed a lesser degree of negative symptoms, and demonstrated fewer
      extrapyramidal side effects at baseline as compared with nonresponders. In
      addition, higher BPRS total scores--after controlling for the effects of the
      other variables--were associated with a response. CONCLUSION: In a cohort of
      partially treatment-refractory outpatients, a favorable response to clozapine was
      associated with characteristics describing less severely ill patients. The
      history of patients did not affect their response to clozapine.

TI  - Effects of olanzapine on prolactin levels of female patients with schizophrenia
      treated with risperidone.
PG  - 408-13
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to prospectively examine the effect of
      switching from risperidone to olanzapine on female schizophrenia patients who
      experienced menstrual disturbances, galactorrhea, and/or sexual dysfunction.
      METHOD: Twenty female patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia who were taking
      risperidone and were suffering from menstrual disturbances, galactorrhea, and/or 
      sexual dysfunction were enrolled. Patients were switched from risperidone to
      olanzapine over a 2-week period, then treated with olanzapine for 8 additional
      weeks. The serum prolactin concentrations were examined every 2 weeks. The
      Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale
      (AIMS), Simpson-Angus Scale for Extrapyramidal Symptoms (SAS), and questions from
      the Dickson-Glazer Sexual Functioning Scale were administered to evaluate
      efficacy, extrapyramidal side effects, and sexual and reproductive functioning at
      baseline and the endpoint of 10 weeks. RESULTS: Serum prolactin levels decreased 
      significantly (p < .01) following the switch from risperidone to olanzapine.
      Scores of PANSS, AIMS, and SAS at the endpoint were also significantly decreased 
      (p < .01) compared to those of baseline. Patients experienced improvements in
      menstrual functioning and perceptions of sexual side effects. CONCLUSION:
      Olanzapine reversed hyperprolactinemia in risperidone-treated female
      schizophrenic patients. This was associated with a decrease in amenorrhea,
      improved cycle regularity, and a decrease in sexual side effects that the women
      attributed to antipsychotic medication. This study suggests that switching to
      olanzapine is a safe and effective alternative method for patients with
      antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia associated sexual and/or reproductive
      dysfunction. Long-term follow-up studies are warranted, with particular attention
      to the course of sexual and reproductive dysfunction.

TI  - Sex differences in clinical response to olanzapine compared with haloperidol.
PG  - 27-37
AB  - There is current disagreement over whether men and women respond differently to
      typical or atypical antipsychotic medications. This study reanalyzed a large
      international clinical trial of olanzapine (Olz) compared with haloperidol (Hal) 
      to test for sex differences in treatment response, controlling for illness
      chronicity and menopausal status. We hypothesized that women would show a greater
      response to either medication than men, particularly among first admission,
      premenopausal women. DSM-III-R schizophrenia inpatients (700 women and 1295 men) 
      were randomly assigned to a 6-week trial of Olz vs. Hal. Longitudinal random
      effect models were used to test for interactions of sex with medication,
      chronicity and menopausal status on treatment response. Findings showed that
      women on olanzapine had a greater drop in overall symptomatology by week 4 than
      any other group, and their level of symptomatology remained lower throughout the 
      6-week trial. The sex differences in treatment response in olanzapine compared
      with haloperidol were, in part, dependent on chronicity and, in women, menopausal
      status. That is, first episode women on haloperidol exhibited an increase in
      symptomatology over the 6-week trial compared to their male counterparts, while
      multiply hospitalized women had a better treatment response on haloperidol than
      their male counterparts. Women on olanzapine had a significantly better treatment
      response than men, regardless of chronicity. Finally, premenopausal women had a
      significantly better treatment response than postmenopausal women, regardless of 
      treatment and chronicity.

TI  - Anxiety and depression symptoms and response to methylphenidate in children with 
      attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and tic disorder.
PG  - 267-74
AB  - This study examined response to methylphenidate in children with
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and chronic multiple tic
      disorder. The primary goal was to determine if children with anxiety or
      depression symptoms showed a less favorable response to treatment. Subjects were 
      38 prepubertal children who participated in an 8-week, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, methylphenidate crossover evaluation. Treatment effects were 
      assessed with direct observations of child behavior in public school and clinic
      settings; rating scales completed by parents, teachers, and clinicians; and
      laboratory analogue tasks. There was little evidence (group data) that children
      with anxiety or depression symptoms responded in a clinically different manner to
      methylphenidate than youngsters who did not exhibit these symptoms, particularly 
      in school observations of the core features of ADHD. Seeming differences between 
      children with and without comorbid anxiety or depression symptoms and drug
      response are likely explained by differences in pretreatment levels of
      negativistic behaviors (i.e., symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder or
      conduct disorder). Methylphenidate appears to be effective for the management of 
      ADHD behaviors in children with mild to moderate anxiety or depression symptoms; 
      nevertheless, much research remains to be performed in this area.

TI  - Antipsychotic-induced weight gain and therapeutic response: a differential
      association.
PG  - 244-51
AB  - This study investigated the association between antipsychotic-induced weight gain
      and therapeutic response to haloperidol and three commonly used atypical
      neuroleptic medications in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. The
      subjects were 151 patients enrolled in a double-blind experiment with a duration 
      of 14 weeks comparing the therapeutic efficacy of haloperidol (n = 36), clozapine
      (n = 38), olanzapine (n = 38), and risperidone (n = 39). Absolute and relative
      (%) gain in body weight and body mass index (BMI) was determined for the entire
      duration of the double-blind treatment period; therapeutic response was assessed 
      by the total score and the individual subscales of the Positive and Negative
      Symptom Scale. Compared with the pretreatment baseline, results indicated that
      for olanzapine and clozapine, therapeutic response was closely related to an
      absolute and relative gain in weight and to a gain in BMI. No association between
      weight gain and therapeutic response was found for risperidone and haloperidol.
      These findings suggest that patients who are likely to have the maximal benefits 
      of olanzapine or clozapine treatment for symptom alleviation are at the highest
      risk of a clinically significant increase in weight gain.

TI  - Treatment of ADHD in neurofibromatosis type 1.
PG  - 164-70
AB  - Forty-six of 93 children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) were found to
      satisfy the diagnostic criteria for attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder
      (ADHD). Detailed comparisons were made among 20 children with NF1 and ADHD (12
      males, 8 females; mean age 10.7 years, SD 2.2), 26 control children with NF1 (15 
      males, 11 females; mean age 11.3 years, SD 2.3), 14 control children with ADHD (7
      males; mean age 9.9 years, SD 1.9), and 14 normally developing control children
      (7 males; mean age 11.2 years, SD 2.8). Children with NF1 and ADHD had the lowest
      IQ scores among the four groups. Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA) scores
      were poorer in the NF1-ADHD and ADHD control groups than in the two non-ADHD
      groups. Those with NF1 and ADHD were rated significantly poorer on the Child
      Behavior Checklist (CBCL) than were the NF1 control group. By administrating low 
      doses (5 to 15 mg) of methylphenidate to the NF1-ADHD group, significantly
      improved TOVA scores were obtained. One-year follow-up yielded significantly
      improved CBCL scores. Our results show a high incidence of ADHD in NF1 and
      support an association between ADHD and learning and social problems in children 
      with NF1. It was demonstrated that stimulant medication can lead to improvement
      in cognitive, academic, and social problems of children with NF1 and ADHD.

TI  - Phenylpropanolamine appears not to promote weight loss in patients with
      schizophrenia who have gained weight during clozapine treatment.
PG  - 345-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Weight gain is a common side effect of clozapine treatment and may
      expose patients to obesity-associated health risks. We proposed that concomitant 
      treatment with an appetite suppressant such as phenylpropanolamine (PPA) would
      lead to a decrease in appetite and therefore loss of weight. METHOD: This was a
      12-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of PPA, 75 mg/day, in
      outpatients with treatment-refractory schizophrenia (DSM-IV) who were stable on
      clozapine treatment for at least 4 months and had gained > 10% of their baseline 
      body weight since starting clozapine. Patients were evaluated for adverse effects
      and weighed weekly. A Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) assessment, a 
      short dietary quiz, and blood indices were completed monthly. RESULTS: Sixteen
      patients were equally randomly assigned to receive PPA or placebo. The groups did
      not differ in mean age, baseline weight, dose of clozapine, baseline PANSS
      scores, or the percent of weight gained since the start of clozapine. There was
      no significant effect of treatment on weight (t = 0.219, df = 10, p = .831).
      There was no significant change in either the total PANSS scores (t = -0.755, df 
      = 10, p = .468), the positive or negative symptom cluster scores, or any of the
      remaining variables. CONCLUSION: Phenylpropanolamine 75 mg/day was well tolerated
      but was not effective in reversing established weight gain associated with
      clozapine treatment in stable outpatients with schizophrenia.

TI  - A pilot, randomized, open-label trial assessing safety and pharmakokinetic
      parameters of co-administration of rivastigmine with risperidone in dementia
      patients with behavioral disturbances.
PG  - 343-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: The majority of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or vascular
      dementia display, in addition to cognitive impairment, various degrees of
      behavioral disturbances. As the use of cholinesterase inhibitors for the
      treatment of cognitive impairment in dementia becomes widespread, many of these
      patients will be treated concomitantly with cholinesterase inhibitors and with
      anti-psychotic drugs to ameliorate behavioral disturbances. Despite the
      widespread use of this combination in clinical practice, the safety and
      tolerability of such combination therapy has not been evaluated in controlled
      clinical trials. This pilot study examined the effects of addition of risperidone
      0.5-2 mg/day to patients on rivastigmine 3-12 mg/day, and vice versa. METHODS: 65
      patients suffering from AD, 10 from vascular dementia, and 15 from both were
      randomized to open label rivastigmine and risperidone, alone or in combination,
      for 20 weeks. Adverse events caused by co-administration were assessed. RESULTS: 
      No clinically relevant adverse interactions were observed. CONCLUSIONS: These
      preliminary results indicate that rivastigmine and risperidone can be safely
      co-administered. Confirmation of these results in large clinical trials studies
      is warranted.

TI  - Continuation phase treatment with bupropion SR effectively decreases the risk for
      relapse of depression.
PG  - 753-61
AB  - BACKGROUND: This was the first controlled continuation phase study (up to 1-year 
      total treatment) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of bupropion SR for
      decreasing the risk for relapse of depression in patients who responded to
      bupropion SR. METHODS: Patients with recurrent major depression were treated with
      bupropion SR 300 mg/day during an 8-week open-label phase. Responders (based on
      Clinical Global Impressions Scale for Improvement of Illness scores) entered a
      randomized, double-blind phase where they received bupropion SR 300 mg/day or
      placebo for up to 44 weeks. After randomization, relapse was defined as the point
      at which the investigator intervened by withdrawing the patient from the study to
      treat depression. RESULTS: Four hundred twenty-three patients were randomized. A 
      statistically significant difference in favor of bupropion SR over placebo was
      seen in the time to treatment intervention for depression when survival curves
      were compared (log-rank test, p =.003). Statistically significant separation
      between bupropion SR and placebo began at double-blind week 12 (p <.05). Adverse 
      events in bupropion SR-treated patients accounted for 9% and 4% of
      discontinuations from the open-label and double-blind phases, respectively.
      CONCLUSIONS: Bupropion SR was shown to be effective and well tolerated in
      decreasing the risk for relapse of depression for up to 44 weeks.

TI  - A double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-response comparison of intramuscular
      olanzapine and haloperidol in the treatment of acute agitation in schizophrenia.
PG  - 441-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: An intramuscular (IM) formulation of olanzapine has been developed
      because there are no rapid-acting IM atypical antipsychotic drugs currently
      available in the United States for treating acute agitation in patients with
      schizophrenia. METHODS: Recently hospitalized acutely agitated patients with
      schizophrenia (N = 270) were randomized to receive 1 to 3 IM injections of
      olanzapine (2.5, 5.0, 7.5, or 10.0 mg), haloperidol (7.5 mg), or placebo within
      24 hours. A dose-response relationship for IM olanzapine in the reduction of
      agitation was assessed by measuring the reduction in Positive and Negative
      Syndrome Scale Excited Component (PANSS-EC) scores 2 hours after the first
      injection. Safety was assessed by recording adverse events and with
      extrapyramidal symptom scales and electrocardiograms at 24 hours after the first 
      injection. RESULTS: Olanzapine exhibited a dose-response relationship for
      reduction in agitation (F(1,179)= 14.4; P<.001). Mean PANSS-EC reductions 2 hours
      after the first injection of olanzapine (2.5 mg = -5.5; 5.0 mg = -8.1; 7.5 mg =
      -8.7; 10.0 mg = -9.4) were superior to those with placebo (-2.9; P =.01 vs
      olanzapine at 2.5 mg; P<.001 for each other olanzapine dose) but not with
      haloperidol (-7.5). A dose of 5.0, 7.5, or 10.0 mg of olanzapine caused a greater
      reduction in agitation than placebo 30 minutes after the first injection. There
      were no differences between treatment groups for hypotension, the most frequently
      reported adverse event, or for clinically relevant changes in the QTc interval.
      There was a greater incidence of treatment-emergent parkinsonism during treatment
      with IM haloperidol (16.7%) than with 2.5 (P =.03), 5.0 (P =.03), or 7.5 mg (P
      =.01) of IM olanzapine (0%) or with placebo (0%) (P =.01). CONCLUSIONS:
      Intramuscular olanzapine at a dose of 2.5 to 10.0 mg per injection exhibits a
      dose-response relationship in the rapid treatment of acute agitation in patients 
      with schizophrenia and demonstrates a favorable safety profile.

      Information was selected from a MEDLINE search (July 2000-October 2001) of
      English-language medical literature using ziprasidone as the search term. Manual 
      searches of pertinent journal article references, request for medical information
      from Pfizer, and access of the Web site of the Food and Drug Administration were 
      also performed. STUDY SELECTION: All available published information regarding
      the pertinent characteristics of ziprasidone were considered for selection. DATA 
      EXTRACTION: Pharmacology and pharmacokinetic studies were selected to provide a
      comprehensive description of these characteristics. Clinical investigations were 
      evaluated for design, sample size, diagnosis, duration, and outcome. Data from
      all investigations were selected by 1 author and reviewed by both authors. DATA
      SYNTHESIS: Ziprasidone is a benzisothiazolyl piperazine-type atypical
      antipsychotic that shares the serotonin(2A)/dopamine(2) (5-HT(2A)/D(2)) profile
      of the available atypical antipsychotics. Ziprasidone has demonstrated in vitro
      activity as a 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist and as a very weak inhibitor of serotonin
      and norepinephrine reuptake. These data do not support ziprasidone as being a
      clinically meaningful inhibitor of serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake. Oral
      bioavailability of ziprasidone taken with food is approximately 60%, half-life is
      approximately 6-7 hours, and protein binding is extensive at >99%. Twelve
      metabolites have been identified, yet only 4 of these are considered to be
      primary metabolites. Metabolism of ziprasidone by aldehyde oxidase produces its
      only metabolite with potential pharmacologic activity; CYP3A4 also contributes to
      the metabolism of ziprasidone. Clinical studies support ziprasidone as
      efficacious for the treatment of patients with acute exacerbations of
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Daily doses permitted in these
      clinical trials ranged from 40 to 160 mg, but only doses between 120 and 160 mg/d
      have been superior to placebo. Future research efforts should be directed toward 
      refractory schizophrenia, cognitive impairment in schizophrenia, affective and
      anxiety symptoms associated with schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar disorder. 
      Adverse effect characteristics of ziprasidone commonly include headache, nausea, 
      and somnolence; infrequent effects include extrapyramidal symptoms and weight
      gain. Ziprasidone has been reported to cause an average QTc prolongation of
      approximately 20 msec; there have only been 2 patients (0.06%) reported by the
      manufacturer to have a measured QTc interval >500 msec. CONCLUSIONS: Ziprasidone 
      is a safe and efficacious atypical antipsychotic for the acute management of
      schizophrenia. Efficacy data and most safety data for ziprasidone support its use
      as a first-line treatment for schizophrenia; however, its potential effects on
      ventricular repolarization relegate it to second-line status in patients with
      comorbid cardiovascular risks.

TI  - A review of the pharmacotherapy of adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity
      disorder.
PG  - 189-202
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Despite the increasing recognition of attention deficit hyperactivity 
      disorder (ADHD) in adults, the use of pharmacotherapeutics remains less
      established. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature identified 15 studies
      (N = 435 subjects) of stimulants, and 22 studies of non-stimulant medications (N 
      = 421 subjects) including antidepressants, antihypertensives, amino acids, and
      wake-promoting agents for the treatment of ADHD in adults. RESULTS: Studies with 
      stimulants and antidepressants demonstrated significant short-term improvement in
      ADHD symptoms compared to placebo in adults. Methylphenidate (MPH) and
      amphetamine had an immediate onset of action whereas the ADHD response to
      pemoline and antidepressants appeared delayed. The response to amphetamine and
      MPH appears to be dose-dependent. Controlled data on nicotonic and noradrenergic 
      compounds appear promising. There was considerable variability in diagnostic
      criteria, dosing parameters, and response rates between the various studies.
      CONCLUSIONS: Under controlled conditions, the aggregate literature shows that the
      stimulants and noradrenergic antidepressants had a clinically and statistically
      significant beneficial effect on treating ADHD in adults.

TI  - Use of olanzapine for elderly patients with psychotic disorders: a review.
PG  - 201-13
AB  - The number of elderly persons with psychosis will increase with the increasing
      geriatric population. Olanzapine is one of the newer atypical antipsychotics with
      efficacy for positive and negative symptoms and safer side effect profile
      compared to conventional antipsychotics. The manuscript describes the
      pharmacology, efficacy and tolerability studies, adverse effects and dosing
      considerations in the elderly. Further studies are needed to fully assess the
      efficacy and safety of olanzapine in the elderly. Current research supports a
      role for olanzapine in treating elderly patients with schizophrenia,
      schizoaffective disorder and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia.

TI  - A systematic review of the use of atypical antipsychotics in autism.
PG  - 93-101
AB  - Conventional antipsychotic medication is commonly prescribed to patients with
      autistic spectrum disorder. However, a high incidence of severe adverse reactions
      highlights the need to find more favourable treatments. Atypical antipsychotics
      may combine efficacy in ameliorating some autistic symptoms with a lower
      incidence of some adverse reactions. This article reviews the use of atypical
      antipsychotics in autistic disorder, with particular focus on behaviour,
      cognition and physical well-being. Thirteen studies using risperidone, three
      using olanzapine, one using clozapine, one using amisulpride and one using
      quetiapine were identified. Few firm conclusions can be drawn due to the
      limitations of the studies; however, there is an indication that risperidone may 
      be effective in reducing hyperactivity, aggression and repetitive behaviours,
      often without inducing severe adverse reactions. Olanzapine and clozapine may
      also be effective; however, there is little evidence for using amisulpride or
      quetiapine in this population. Randomized trials are required to clarify the
      effectiveness of these agents.

TI  - [Augmentation of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) with atypical
      antipsychotics in the treatment of depression].
PG  - 210-7
AB  - The treatment of severe depression represents a difficult task in the daily
      psychiatric practice. In certain cases, augmentation therapies in order to
      improve the efficacy of SSRIs can be useful. Recently, it has become possible to 
      use atypical antipsychotics for SSRI augmentation. This option adds to the
      existing strategies in the treatment of depression and primary systematic studies
      show encouraging results. In this review, the possibility of a SSRI augmentation 
      by additionally administering risperidone or olanzapine is critically discussed.

TI  - Clonidine as coadjuvant in eye surgery: comparison of peribulbar versus oral
      administration.
PG  - 140-5
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the administration of peribulbar or oral
      clonidine would enhance analgesia and anesthesia in ophthalmologic surgery.
      DESIGN: Randomized double-blind study. SETTING: Teaching hospital. PATIENTS: 60
      ASA physical status I and II adult patients scheduled for unilateral
      ophthalmologic surgery with peribulbar block. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were
      assigned to one of 4 groups, and premedicated with oral 2 mL volume (clonidine or
      placebo). The peribulbar eye block consisted of local anesthetics plus 1 mL of
      the test drug. The control group (CG) received oral saline as premedication and
      peribulbar saline as the test drugs. The clonidine eye group (Clo-eye G) received
      oral saline and peribulbar 30 microg clonidine. The clonidine oral group
      (Clo-oral G) received oral 150 microg clonidine and peribulbar saline. The
      clonidine eye+oral group (Clo eye+oral G) had oral 75 microg clonidine and
      peribulbar 15 microg clonidine. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Perioperative
      assessment included anesthesia, analgesia, blood cortisol; and adverse effects.
      The groups were demographically similar. The latency time to the onset of the
      peribulbar block was shorter in the Clo-eye G compared to the CG (p < 0.05). The 
      CG presented higher blood pressure levels throughout surgery, compared to the
      others (p < 0.05). The time to first rescue analgesics was longer in all patients
      who received peribulbar clonidine compared to the CG (p < 0.05). Analgesic
      consumption was lesser in the Clo-eye G compared to the CG (p < 0.05). The blood 
      cortisol level was higher during the intraoperative period in all groups
      (preoperative vs. intraoperative values) (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Despite the
      higher intraoperative blood cortisol levels, 30 microg peribulbar clonidine
      decreased the onset time to anesthesia, while 15 and 30 microg peribulbar
      clonidine prolonged the time to first rescue analgesics in patients under
      peribulbar block, without increasing the frequency of adverse effects.
      Conversely, oral administration of clonidine alone did not enhance anesthesia or 
      analgesia following eye block, suggesting a local mechanism of action of
      clonidine.

TI  - Steady-state pharmacokinetics and tolerability of modafinil administered alone or
      in combination with dextroamphetamine in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 450-60
AB  - The potential for a drug-drug interaction between modafinil and
      dextroamphetamine, each at steady state, was investigated in an open-label,
      randomized, single-period studyin 32 healthy male and female volunteers. All
      subjects received modafinil orally once daily for 28 days (200 mg on Days 1-7;
      400 mg on Days 8-28). On Days 22 to 28, half of the subjects also received
      dextroamphetamine (20 mg) orally 7 hours after modafinil. Samples for
      pharmacokinetic (PK) profiling were obtained on Days 21 and 28. The mean changes 
      in PK parameters for modafinil and its two circulating metabolites between the
      two groups were not statistically significantly different, except Cmax for
      modafinil acid. Adverse events obtained in the two groups were similar and mild
      or moderate in nature. The results indicate that administration of low-dose
      dextroamphetamine in this dosing regimen does not alter the steady-state
      pharmacokinetics of modafinil. The combination has a similar tolerability profile
      as modafinil alone.

TI  - Comparison of rapidly acting intramuscular olanzapine, lorazepam, and placebo: a 
      double-blind, randomized study in acutely agitated patients with dementia.
PG  - 494-504
AB  - This double-blind study investigated the efficacy and safety of rapid-acting
      intramuscular olanzapine in treating agitation associated with Alzheimer's
      disease and/or vascular dementia. At 2 h, olanzapine (5.0 mg, 2.5 mg) and
      lorazepam (1.0 mg) showed significant improvement over placebo on the PANSS
      Excited Component (PANSS-EC) and Agitation-Calmness Evaluation Scale (ACES), and 
      both 5.0 mg olanzapine and lorazepam showed superiority to placebo on the
      Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory. At 24 h, both olanzapine groups maintained
      superiority over placebo on the PANSS-EC; lorazepam did not. Olanzapine (5.0 mg) 
      and lorazepam improved ACES scores more than placebo. Simpson-Angus and
      Mini-Mental State Examination scores did not change significantly from baseline. 
      Sedation (ACES > or =8), adverse events, and laboratory analytes were not
      significantly different from placebo for any treatment. No significant
      differences among treatment groups were seen in extrapyramidal symptoms or in
      corrected QT interval at either 2 h or 24 h, and no significant differences among
      treatment groups were seen in vital signs, including orthostasis. Intramuscular
      injection of olanzapine may therefore provide substantial benefit in rapidly
      treating inpatients with acute dementia-related agitation.

TI  - Reducing the burden of caring for Alzheimer's disease through the amelioration of
      "delusions of theft" by drug therapy.
PG  - 211-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Delusions of theft (delusions involving the theft of possessions) are
      one of the most frequent neuropsychiatric manifestations of Alzheimer's disease
      (AD). OBJECTIVE: The current study investigated the presence and extent of such
      delusions before and after drug treatment in a group of AD patients, and the
      consequent effects on the burden of care on caregivers. METHOD: The study was an 
      open-label cohort design. The delusions studied consisted only of those involving
      theft of possessions. Sixteen AD patients served as subjects in order to assess
      the efficacy of Risperidone administration, in the reduction or elimination of
      these delusions. The caregiver burden was evaluated using the Zarit Caregiver
      Burden Interview (ZBI) before the administration of Risperidone and 12 weeks
      after administration, for cases where delusions of theft were eliminated or
      reduced. RESULTS: The burden of care on caregivers was significantly reduced (p <
      0.001) through the elimination or reduction of delusions of theft. CONCLUSION:
      Delusions of theft are considered to be a major factor in increasing the burden
      of care, and the treatment of these, through appropriate drug therapy, is
      therefore of great importance in the continuation of satisfactory care in the
      home.

TI  - The evolving role of topiramate among other mood stabilizers in the management of
      bipolar disorder.
PG  - 215-32
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Topiramate, a structurally novel anticonvulsant, is being evaluated
      for other neurological conditions such as migraine, neuropathic pain, and
      essential tremor, and also for psychiatric conditions such as bipolar disorder,
      bulimia, post-traumatic stress disorder, and schizoaffective disorder, in
      addition to obesity. This article will focus on the use of topiramate for bipolar
      disorder. METHODS: The pharmacological profile of topiramate is compared to other
      established and putative mood stabilizers, and a rationale for its use in bipolar
      disorder is presented. Data from open clinical trials of topiramate for
      depression, mania, and rapid-cycling bipolar disorder are summarized. Preliminary
      data from one pilot dose-finding, double-blind, random-assignment,
      placebo-controlled, 3-week parallel group study of two doses of topiramate for
      acute bipolar I mania is reported. Safety data regarding topiramate was reviewed.
      Finally, the potential place of this agent in bipolar illness is considered.
      RESULTS: The pharmacological advantages for topiramate are low protein binding,
      minimal hepatic metabolism and mainly unchanged renal excretion, a 24-h
      half-life, and minimal drug interactions. Open clinical studies suggest a 50-65% 
      response for refractory bipolar mania, and a 40-56% response for refractory
      bipolar depression in mainly add-on treatment. Open clinical studies of
      topiramate for rapid-cycling subjects and those for comorbid bulimia, substance
      abuse, post-traumatic stress, migraine, and obesity report effectiveness. The
      primary efficacy endpoint data (change from baseline Y-MRS total scores) of the
      placebo-controlled, random assignment parallel group phase II dose-finding study 
      were not statistically significant. However, once the antidepressant-associated
      manias (28 of the sample, of 97 subjects) were excluded from the controlled
      study, the post-hoc analyses indicated the higher dose (512 mg/day) topiramate
      treatment group showed a statistically significant reduction in endpoint Y-MRS
      change scores as compared to placebo (p < 0.03). Adverse effects of topiramate in
      bipolar subjects include attention, concentration and memory problems, fatigue,
      sedation, transient paraesthesias, nausea, and anorexia. Some subjects experience
      word-finding difficulty. Weight loss may be seen in several topiramate-treated
      subjects with bipolar disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Topiramate appears to show promise
      as an addition to the agents available to treat bipolar disorder. More definitive
      controlled data on the efficacy of topiramate in the acute and continuation
      phases as well as for the prophylaxis either as monotherapy or as combination
      treatment of bipolar disorder are ongoing, and the results are awaited.

TI  - The anxiolytic effect of the novel antipsychotic ziprasidone compared with
      diazepam in subjects anxious before dental surgery.
PG  - 206-10
AB  - The novel atypical antipsychotic ziprasidone has a pharmacologic profile notable 
      for potent agonism of serotonin (5-HT)1A receptors, antagonism at 5-HT1D
      receptors, and reuptake inhibition of norepinephrine. 5-HT1A receptor agonism, in
      particular, suggests anxiolytic activity, and ziprasidone has shown preliminary
      efficacy in treating the symptoms of anxiety associated with psychotic disorders.
      In this study, the anxiolytic efficacy of ziprasidone was evaluated in
      nonpsychotic subjects who were anxious before undergoing minor dental surgery. We
      compared a single oral dose of 20 mg ziprasidone (N = 30) with that of 10 mg
      diazepam (N = 30) and placebo (N = 30) in a randomized, parallel-group,
      double-blind study. The peak anxiolytic effect of ziprasidone compared with that 
      of placebo was similar to that of diazepam but had a later onset. At 3 hours
      postdose, the anxiolytic effect of ziprasidone was significantly greater than
      that of placebo (p < 0.05) and somewhat greater than that of diazepam. Diazepam
      showed a significantly greater anxiolytic effect than placebo at 1 hour (p <
      0.05) but not at 3 hours. The sedative effect of ziprasidone was never greater
      than that of placebo, whereas that of diazepam was significantly greater than
      that of placebo 1 to 1.5 hours postdose. Ziprasidone was generally well
      tolerated. Only one patient reported treatment-related adverse events (nausea and
      vomiting) and, unlike diazepam, ziprasidone did not cause reductions in blood
      pressure. Dystonia, extrapyramidal syndrome, akathisia, and postural hypotension 
      were not seen with ziprasidone. Thus, ziprasidone may possess anxiolytic effects 
      in addition to its antipsychotic properties.

TI  - Effect of fluoxetine and imipramine on the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of
      the antipsychotic quetiapine.
PG  - 174-82
AB  - The effects of fluoxetine and imipramine on the pharmacokinetics and
      nonpsychiatric side effect profile of quetiapine fumarate were investigated in 26
      patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder in a
      multicenter, two-period, multiple-dose, open-label, randomized trial. Over a 1-
      to 2-week period, patients were titrated to a 300-mg twice-daily dose of
      quetiapine. Patients treated for at least 7 days at the target dose entered a
      combination therapy period, receiving fluoxetine (60 mg daily) or imipramine (75 
      mg twice daily) for 8 days. Key assessments included pharmacokinetic analysis of 
      quetiapine, the Udvalg for kliniske undersogelser (UKU) Side Effect Rating Scale,
      and safety evaluations (e.g., adverse events, electrocardiograms, laboratory
      tests, and vital signs). Fluoxetine increased the quetiapine area under the
      plasma concentration time curve during a 12-hour interval (+12%), maximum plasma 
      concentration during the dosing interval (C(ss)(max); +26%), and minimum plasma
      concentration at the end of the dosing interval (+8%), although it decreased oral
      clearance (-11%). The change in C(ss)(max) was statistically although not
      clinically significant. Imipramine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of
      quetiapine. Overall, scores on the UKU Side Effect Rating Scale improved during
      combination therapy with either agent, and no statistically significant
      deterioration was observed for any item. For safety assessments, the only
      clinically remarkable event was an imipramine-associated complete left bundle
      branch block in one patient. No unexpected side effects were reported. In
      conclusion, combination therapy with quetiapine and fluoxetine or imipramine had 
      a minimal effect on quetiapine pharmacokinetics and was well tolerated.

TI  - The safety and pharmacokinetics of quetiapine when coadministered with
      haloperidol, risperidone, or thioridazine.
PG  - 121-30
AB  - The effects of haloperidol, risperidone, and thioridazine on the pharmacokinetics
      and side-effect profile of quetiapine were investigated in 36 patients with
      schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder in a single-center, 
      two-period, multiple-dose, open-label, randomized trial. Over a one-to two-week
      period, quetiapine doses were escalated to 300 mg twice daily (bid). Patients
      were then treated for at least 7 days at the target quetiapine dose and
      subsequently entered into the combination therapy period, receiving haloperidol
      (7.5 mg, bid), risperidone (3 mg, bid), or thioridazine (200 mg, bid) for 8.5
      days (after 3 days of dose escalation). Key assessments included the
      pharmacokinetics of quetiapine at steady state (area under the curve within a
      dosing interval [AUCtSS], maximum [CmaxSS], and minimum [CminSS] observed plasma 
      concentrations, and oral clearance [Cl/f]), as well as the UKU Side Effect Rating
      Scale scores and safety evaluations. Neither risperidone nor haloperidol had
      significant effects on quetiapine pharmacokinetics. However, thioridazine
      produced statistically significant changes, decreasing the least squares means
      values of the AUCtSS, CmaxSS, and CminSS by 40%, 47%, and 31%, respectively, and 
      increasing Cl/f by 68%. Increases in the following adverse events were noted
      during coadministration: somnolence (risperidone), insomnia and dry mouth (all
      three coadministered therapies), and dizziness (thioridazine). UKU side effect
      items that became worse in >or= 25% of patients during each coadministration
      period included sedation and increased sleep duration. Results of laboratory
      tests, electrocardiograms, and vital sign measurements revealed few clinically
      important changes. Clinical stability can be maintained with good tolerability
      during the transition from quetiapine monotherapy to periods of coadministration 
      with haloperidol, risperidone, or thioridazine. Coadministration of either
      haloperidol or risperidone did not have any important effects on the steady-state
      pharmacokinetics of quetiapine. Thioridazine significantly increased the oral
      clearance of quetiapine. Increased doses of quetiapine may be necessary to
      control psychotic symptoms when thioridazine is coadministered with quetiapine.

TI  - A double blind placebo controlled trial of donepezil adjunctive treatment to
      risperidone for the cognitive impairment of schizophrenia.
PG  - 349-57
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the beneficial effects of atypical antipsychotics on
      cognition, these improvements will not return most schizophrenic patients to
      normative standards of cognitive functioning. Therefore, other treatments need to
      be considered. Subtle changes in cholinergic function in schizophrenic patients
      provide the rationale to test the effectiveness of cholinesterase inhibitors in
      treating cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. METHODS: Given this, a 12-week,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of donepezil (5 mg and 10 mg) as
      adjunctive treatment to risperidone was conducted in a total of 36 schizophrenic 
      patients. RESULTS: Neither the 5-mg nor 10-mg dose of donepezil produced
      significant improvements in any cognitive measure compared with placebo.
      CONCLUSIONS: It is possible that nicotinic receptor desensitization produced by
      chronic tobacco use in these patients rendered their nicotinic receptors
      refractory to the effects of increased agonist activity produced by donepezil. An
      alternative treatment is the allosterically potentiating ligands, which enhance
      the activity of (sensitize) nicotinic receptors in the presence of acetylcholine.

TI  - A comparison of the short-term hypotensive effects and side effects of unilateral
      brimonidine and apraclonidine in patients with elevated intraocular pressure.
PG  - 45-9
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the short-term ocular hypotensive efficacy and side effects
      of 0.2% brimonidine and 0.5% apraclonidine in patients with elevated intraocular 
      pressure (IOP). METHODS: We performed a double-masked, placebo-controlled study
      to compare the efficacy of the application of 0.2% brimonidine and 0.5%
      apraclonidine for the effect of IOP, systemic blood pressure and heart rate in 20
      newly diagnosed ocular hypertensive patients. Effects on the untreated fellow eye
      and ocular side effects were also determined. All measurements were performed 1, 
      2, 4, 6 and 8 h after the instillation of one drop. RESULTS: Brimonidine and
      apraclonidine significantly reduced IOP from baseline at all observation times.
      No significant difference was observed between the treatment groups. IOP
      decreased significantly in the untreated fellow eye in the brimonidine group at
      4-, 6- and 8-hour checks and at 6-hour checks in the apraclonidine group when
      compared with placebo. Blood pressure and heart rate decreased significantly in
      the brimonidine group compared with placebo. Apraclonidine did not affect blood
      pressure or heart rate any differently than placebo. The pupil diameter and the
      interpalpebral fissure width significantly increased in the apraclonidine group, 
      but not in the brimonidine group. There were no significant differences in the
      overall incidence of foreign body sensation, burning and stinging and dry mouth
      in the treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: In the short-term, brimonidine was
      effective in reducing IOP in patients with elevated IOP and was equivalent in
      efficacy to apraclonidine. On the other hand, a significant change in blood
      pressure and heart rate was observed with brimonidine; there was no change at all
      in the apraclonidine group.

TI  - Alpha2-adrenergic agonists in opioid withdrawal.
PG  - 49-58
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This paper presents the main findings of a systematic (Cochrane)
      review of the effectiveness of alpha2-adrenergic agonists in managing opioid
      withdrawal. DESIGN: The original systematic review included controlled trials
      that compared alpha2-adrenergic agonists with another form of treatment (or
      placebo) in participants who were primarily opioid-dependent. MAIN FINDINGS: Ten 
      studies compared a treatment regime based on an alpha2-adrenergic agonist with
      one based on reducing doses of methadone. Withdrawal intensity is similar to, or 
      marginally greater with alpha2-adrenergic agonists, but signs and symptoms of
      withdrawal occur and resolve earlier in treatment. Participants stay in treatment
      longer with methadone. The likelihood of completing withdrawal is similar, or
      slightly less, with clonidine or lofexidine. Clonidine is associated with more
      adverse effects than reducing doses of methadone. Three studies compared the
      alpha2-adrenergic agonists, clonidine and lofexidine. Lofexidine does not reduce 
      blood pressure to the same extent as clonidine, but is otherwise similar to
      clonidine. CONCLUSIONS: Participants stay in treatment longer with methadone
      regimes, which may provide greater opportunity for psychosocial intervention.
      Methadone regimes may be preferable for withdrawal in outpatient settings where
      the risk of relapse to heroin use is high. The use of methadone may also
      facilitate transfer to maintenance treatment should completion of withdrawal
      become unlikely. For those who are well prepared for withdrawal and seeking
      earlier resolution of withdrawal symptoms, alpha2-adrenergic agonist treatment
      may be preferred. Clonidine and lofexidine appear equally effective for inpatient
      settings, but the lower incidence of hypotension makes lofexidine more suited to 
      use in outpatient settings.

TI  - Time to study discontinuation, relapse, and compliance with atypical or
      conventional antipsychotics in schizophrenia and related disorders.
PG  - 65-8
AB  - To more clearly clarify the efficacy of the atypical antipsychotics compared to
      conventional antipsychotics, we add data on the outcome of patients diagnosed
      with schizophrenia from two large, international clinical trials comparing
      olanzapine with haloperidol (n = 1996) and olanzapine with risperidone (n = 339).
      Both studies comprised double-blinded, placebo controlled, random assignment
      trials. Health outcomes reported include: (i) time to discontinuation in the
      trial; (ii) clinical relapse; and (iii) time to drug non-compliance. When outcome
      was measured as time to discontinuation due to adverse events or lack of
      efficacy, olanzapine showed superiority over haloperidol and no difference
      compared to risperidone. Of those patients who had an initial response, there was
      no significant difference between olanzapine and haloperidol when outcome was
      measured using either: (i) 52-week relapse rates or (ii) time to first
      non-compliance. Using the measures of study discontinuation, relapse and
      non-compliance, in one trial the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine was superior
      to haloperidol, while in a second trial there were no differences between
      olanzapine and risperidone.

TI  - Mirtazapine, yohimbine or olanzapine augmentation therapy for serotonin
      reuptake-associated female sexual dysfunction: a randomized, placebo controlled
      trial.
PG  - 147-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many agents have been proposed as potential treatments for
      SSRI-associated sexual dysfunction, but few placebo-controlled trials have been
      reported. METHOD: After a 1-month baseline evaluation, pre-menopausal women with 
      moderate to severe sexual dysfunction associated with the institution of
      fluoxetine therapy were randomized to augmentation therapy with placebo (N=39),
      mirtazapine (N=36), yohimbine (N=35) or olanzapine (N=38) for a 6-week period.
      Outcomes were measured using a daily diary, a biweekly self-report assessment,
      and a computer assisted structured interview. RESULTS: At baseline, orgasm was
      most severely impaired. After 6 weeks, there was statistically significant
      improvement on most measures for the overall group of patients, however there
      were few differences between treatment groups. Isolated treatment differences
      were observed for the patient self-report of overall sexual function (olanzapine 
      superior to placebo) and the structured interview sexual satisfaction item
      (mirtazapine inferior to placebo). CONCLUSION: No drug assessed was consistently 
      associated with differences from placebo. The results of the study do not support
      uncontrolled reports of efficacy for these agents in premenopausal women.

TI  - Psychopharmacology and aggression. I: A meta-analysis of stimulant effects on
      overt/covert aggression-related behaviors in ADHD.
PG  - 253-61
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine by meta-analysis the effect size for stimulants on overt 
      and covert aggression-related behaviors in children with
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), separately from stimulant
      effects on the core symptoms of ADHD. METHOD: A review of the literature from
      1970 to 2001 revealed 28 studies meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria for
      meta-analysis. These studies yielded 28 independent effects of overt aggression
      and 7 independent effects of covert aggression. RESULTS: The overall weighted
      mean effect size was 0.84 for overt and 0.69 for covert aggression related
      behaviors in ADHD. Comorbid conduct disorder is associated with diminishing
      stimulant effect size for overt aggression. CONCLUSION: Stimulant effects for
      aggression-related behaviors in ADHD have effect sizes similar to those for the
      core symptoms of ADHD.

TI  - Obsessive-compulsive symptoms during treatment with olanzapine and risperidone: a
      prospective study of 113 patients with recent-onset schizophrenia or related
      disorders.
PG  - 104-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS)
      differs during treatment with olanzapine or risperidone and to establish whether 
      duration of antipsychotic treatment is related to severity of OCS. METHOD: We
      conducted a prospective study of consecutively hospitalized young patients (mean 
      age = 22.4 years) with DSM-IV schizophrenia or related disorders (N = 113) who
      were treated with olanzapine or risperidone. Olanzapine or risperidone was
      randomly prescribed for patients who were drug-naive or were treated with typical
      antipsychotics before admission (N = 36). Patients who had started olanzapine (N 
      = 39) or risperidone treatment (N = 23) prior to admission continued with that
      medication if they showed initial clinical response. Patients who prior to
      admission started olanzapine (N = 6) or risperidone (N = 9) but showed no
      response or suffered from adverse effects switched at admission to risperidone or
      olanzapine, respectively. Medical records, parents, and patients revealed
      information on duration of treatment and compliance with olanzapine or
      risperidone prior to admission. The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS)
      was administered at admission and 6 weeks thereafter. RESULTS: At baseline and
      6-week assessments, OCS were found in about 30% of 106 evaluable cases and 15%
      met DSM-IV criteria for obsessive-compulsive disorder. No differences in OCS were
      found in the patients randomly assigned to olanzapine or risperidone. The 35
      subjects treated with olanzapine at both assessments had significantly (p = .01) 
      more severe OCS at week 6 than the 20 subjects treated with risperidone at both
      assessments. Duration of treatment with olanzapine was significantly (p < .01)
      related to severity of OCS. CONCLUSION: There are no differences in the
      short-term propensity of olanzapine or risperidone to induce or exacerbate OCS.
      However, severity of OCS was associated with duration of treatment with
      olanzapine.

TI  - [Usefulness of olanzapine in the levodopa-induced psychosis in patients with
      Parkinson's disease].
PG  - 7-11
AB  - BACKGROUND: To evaluate the antipsychotic efficacy of olanzapine (OLZ) in
      patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and drug-induced psychosis (DIP) and its
      repercussion on the motor function. METHODS: Ten patients (5 women and 5 men)
      diagnosed of PD and DIP, aged 67 years (range: 50-81), with PD duration of 11.1
      years (range: 6-23), treated chronically with levodopa per day, received a dose
      of 2.5 or 5.0 mg OLZ daily. Data concerning improvement of psychosis and
      worsening of motor function was based on Positive And Negative Symptoms Scale
      (PANSS) and Unified Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor. RESULTS:
      Psychotic symptoms were improved in all patients. In most of them the improvement
      was almost total. Seven patients increased levodopa dose on OLZ, but significant 
      worsening of motor function was reported just in one patient. None of the
      patients had agranulocytosis in the blood monitoring. Two patients presented
      weight gain. Seven patients improved their cognitive status. CONCLUSIONS: We
      conclude that OLZ at the doses studied may have efficacy for DIP which appears in
      PD and does not induce worsening of motor function in most of the patients.

TI  - Effect of modafinil at steady state on the single-dose pharmacokinetic profile of
      warfarin in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 205-14
AB  - Modafinil has been reported to produce a concentration-related suppression of
      CYP2C9 activity in vitro in primary cultures of human hepatocytes. To determine
      whether this effect occurs in vivo, the pharmacokinetics of (S)-warfarin was
      investigated after single oral doses of racemic warfarin (5 mg; COUMADIN) in a
      placebo-controlled, single-blind, single-period study in 28 volunteers. Subjects 
      received an oral dose of warfarin prior to administration of modafinil (200 mg
      for 7 days, followed by 400 mg for 21 days) or placebo and they received another 
      after 4 weeks of treatment. Treatment with modafinil did not significantly alter 
      the pharmacokinetics of (S)- or (R)-warfarin relative to placebo. Since
      (S)-warfarin is predominantly metabolized via CYP2C9, the results indicate that
      the marked suppression of CYP2C9 activity in vitro does not translate into a
      similar effect clinically. However, limitations arising from investigation of
      single doses of warfarin preclude global conclusions about the potential for more
      subtle interactions after chronic warfarin administration.

      substance abuse treatment facilities in Los Angeles: an emerging profile.
PG  - 45-60
AB  - Who are methamphetamine (MA) users and what are the circumstances that surround
      their drug use? This article provides a foundation for future ethnographic
      studies and collaborative clinician-researcher assessments of MA use by
      describing use ecology and drug use motivation for 260 MA users admitted to
      treatment at public Los Angeles County facilities in 1996. Use ecology data
      include MA varieties and street names, first introductions to use, drug use
      histories, access, selling and manufacturing, routes of administration, unwanted 
      results of use, and participants' use behavior in the year before the 1996
      treatment. Use motivation data describe clients using MA as a substitute for
      other stimulants; to cope with mental distress; to stay awake; to enhance sexual 
      experience; and to lose weight. Qualitative case studies illustrate the findings 
      and demonstrate the complex inter-relations of society, culture, psyche and soma 
      shaping MA use over time.

TI  - Clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, and haloperidol in the treatment of patients 
      with chronic schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.
PG  - 255-62
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors compared the efficacy and safety of three atypical
      antipsychotics (clozapine, olanzapine, and risperidone) with one another and with
      haloperidol in the treatment of patients with chronic schizophrenia or
      schizoaffective disorder. METHOD: In a double-blind trial, 157 inpatients with a 
      history of suboptimal treatment response were randomly assigned to treatment with
      clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, or haloperidol for 14 weeks (an 8-week
      escalation and fixed-dose period followed by a 6-week variable-dose period).
      RESULTS: Clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine (but not haloperidol) resulted in
      statistically significant improvements in total score on the Positive and
      Negative Syndrome Scale. Improvements seen in total and negative symptom scores
      with clozapine and olanzapine were superior to haloperidol. The atypical drugs,
      particularly olanzapine and clozapine, were associated with weight gain.
      CONCLUSIONS: The effects of atypical antipsychotics in this population were
      statistically significant but clinically modest. The overall pattern of results
      suggests that clozapine and olanzapine have similar general antipsychotic
      efficacy and that risperidone may be somewhat less effective. Clozapine was the
      most effective treatment for negative symptoms. However, the differences among
      treatments were small.

TI  - Amisulpride, an unusual "atypical" antipsychotic: a meta-analysis of randomized
      controlled trials.
PG  - 180-90
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The "atypical" profile of the new antipsychotics clozapine,
      olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone has been linked to combined antagonism of
      serotonin 2 (5-HT(2)) and dopamine 2 (D(2)) receptors. Although amisulpride is a 
      highly selective D(3)/D(2) receptor antagonist, it is assumed to have atypical
      properties as well. The purpose of this article was to compare the atypical
      profile of amisulpride with that of the 5-HT(2)/D(2) antagonists. METHOD:
      Randomized controlled trials that compared amisulpride with conventional
      antipsychotics or placebo for patients with schizophrenia were identified and
      included in a meta-analysis. The mean effect sizes found for amisulpride were
      compared with those of an updated meta-analysis of the 5-HT(2)/D(2) antagonists. 
      RESULTS: Eighteen randomized controlled trials of amisulpride (N=2,214) were
      found. In 11 studies of acutely ill patients it proved to be consistently more
      effective than conventional antipsychotics for global schizophrenic symptoms
      (measured with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale) and negative symptoms.
      Amisulpride is to date the only atypical antipsychotic for which several studies 
      of patients suffering predominantly from negative symptoms have been published.
      In four such studies amisulpride was significantly more effective than placebo.
      Three small studies with conventional antipsychotics as comparators showed only a
      trend in favor of amisulpride in this regard. Amisulpride was associated with
      clearly lower use of antiparkinsonian medication and with fewer dropouts due to
      adverse events than conventional antipsychotics. CONCLUSIONS: These results cast 
      some doubt on the notion that combined 5-HT(2)/D(2) antagonism is the reason that
      the newer antipsychotic medications are effective for negative symptoms and have 
      fewer extrapyramidal side effects.

TI  - Efficacy of clonidine for prevention of perioperative myocardial ischemia: a
      critical appraisal and meta-analysis of the literature.
PG  - 323-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a belief that clonidine may be effective in reducing
      perioperative myocardial ischemic events, although the results of several trials 
      are conflicting. The aim of the current study was to provide a systematic review 
      of randomized controlled trials that tested the efficacy of clonidine in this
      regard. METHODS: Data was collected from a MEDLINE search of English-language
      studies published from 1980 to 1999 and a manual search of bibliographies from
      retrieved articles. A total of 28 studies were assessed. According to the
      selection criteria (study design, population, intervention, and outcome) and a
      quality scoring system, seven studies were finally included in the meta-analysis.
      After homogeneity was established by Q value, the data were then combined using
      the fixed-effects model. The pooled odds ratio was calculated. A subgroup
      analysis based on the types of surgery and administration route was also
      performed to qualify the results. The results were expressed as odds ratio and
      95% confidence interval. RESULTS: Heterogeneity of outcome data was negative in
      the trials. The pooled odds ratio was 0.49 (95% confidence interval 0.34-0.71).
      In the subgroup analysis, clonidine reduced the incidence of myocardial ischemia 
      in patients undergoing cardiac and noncardiac surgery. Rates of bradycardia were 
      similar in clonidine and placebo groups. CONCLUSION: The meta-analysis suggests
      that perioperative clonidine reduces cardiac ischemic episodes in patients with
      known, or at risk of, coronary arterial disease without increasing the incidence 
      of bradycardia. Therefore, these findings strongly justify planning and execution
      of a definitive study seeking the benefits of clonidine.

TI  - Effects of clonidine in schizophrenic patients with primary polydipsia: three
      single case studies.
PG  - 387-92
AB  - A pilot study was conducted in schizophrenic patients with primary polydipsia to 
      determine the tolerability of adding clonidine to an existing antipsychotic drug 
      regimen and to seek evidence of an antidipsic effect. Three patients with chronic
      schizophrenia and primary polydipsia underwent open controlled prospective trials
      of treatment with clonidine in doses of up to 800 microg/day. The trials lasted
      from 2 to 5 months each, and analysis of variance was used to test for changes in
      dependent variables on a case-by-case basis. Blood pressure and pulse declined
      significantly in a dose-dependent manner, but fluid intake, as assessed by
      measurements of weight and 24-h urine volume, was not affected. Hypotension and
      bradycardia limited the extent to which the dose of clonidine could be increased.
      The lack of evident effect of clonidine on polydipsia in this small sample and
      the inconsistent results of two other recent studies of clonidine in patients
      with schizophrenia and primary polydipsia provide little overall support for the 
      effectiveness of clonidine treatment in primary polydipsia associated with
      schizophrenia.

TI  - Do bupropion SR and sertraline differ in their effects on anxiety in depressed
      patients?
PG  - 776-81
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of bupropion sustained release (SR) and
      sertraline on anxiety in outpatients with recurrent DSM-IV-defined major
      depressive disorder. METHOD: This retrospective analysis was conducted using
      pooled data from 2 identical, 8-week, acute-phase, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies of bupropion SR (N = 234), sertraline 
      (N = 225), and placebo (N = 233). Symptoms of anxiety and depression were
      measured using the 14-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) and the
      21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-21), respectively. Percentage
      reduction in baseline HAM-A total score for each treatment week was calculated to
      determine whether the time to onset of anxiolytic activity differed among
      antidepressant responders to each agent. Central nervous system (CNS) adverse
      events were tabulated. RESULTS: Bupropion SR and sertraline were comparably
      effective, both were superior to placebo in reducing depressive symptoms. and
      they did not differ in their effect on anxiety symptoms. Antidepressant
      responders (> 50% reduction in baseline HAM-D-21 score) in both groups showed
      marked and comparable reductions in HAM-A scores (baseline to exit). There were
      no differences between bupropion SR and sertraline in the median time (4 weeks)
      to reach a clinically significant anxiolytic effect (> or = 50% reduction in
      baseline HAM-A score). CNS adverse events were comparable for bupropion SR and
      sertraline, except for somnolence, which was more common in sertraline-treated
      patients. CONCLUSION: Bupropion SR and sertraline had comparable antidepressant
      and anxiolytic effects and an equally rapid onset of clinically significant
      anxiolytic activity. There was no difference in the activating effects between
      the 2 antidepressants. Selection between these 2 agents cannot be based on either
      anticipation of differential anxiolytic activity or differential CNS side effect 
      profiles.

TI  - The effects of olanzapine on the 5 dimensions of schizophrenia derived by factor 
      analysis: combined results of the North American and international trials.
PG  - 757-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: The choice of drug to treat a patient with schizophrenia is one of
      the most critical clinical decisions. Controversy exists on the differential
      efficacy of olanzapine. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: Raw data from all 4
      registrational double-blind, random-assignment studies of olanzapine compared
      with placebo or haloperidol were obtained from Eli Lilly and Company for this
      meta-analysis. METHOD: Analysis of covariance of the intent-to-treat
      last-observation-carried-forward endpoint scores was used to assess efficacy on
      Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale
      (PANSS) total scores and the 5 factors derived by factor analysis (negative
      symptoms, positive symptoms, disorganized thoughts, impulsivity/hostility, and
      anxiety/depression). RESULTS: Olanzapine produced a statistically significantly
      greater reduction in schizophrenic symptoms than haloperidol (p < .05) on total
      scores on the BPRS and PANSS on each of the 5 factors as well as on almost all
      items. Olanzapine induced a response at a rate equal to that induced by
      haloperidol in the first few weeks, but by the end of the study produced a
      greater percentage of responders. Compared with haloperidol, olanzapine produced 
      a somewhat greater response on symptoms responsive to haloperidol, but a markedly
      better response on symptoms unresponsive to haloperidol. This difference favoring
      olanzapine occurred to an equal degree in all subgroups examined. The incidence
      of parkinsonism or akathisia following olanzapine treatment was extremely low and
      not statistically distinguishable from placebo. CONCLUSION: Olanzapine produced a
      greater improvement than haloperidol particularly by benefiting a much larger
      number of items or factors. Extrapyramidal side effects and akathisia during
      olanzapine treatment were statistically indistinguishable from effects seen with 
      placebo.

TI  - Pharmacological treatment of postoperative shivering: a quantitative systematic
      review of randomized controlled trials.
PG  - 453-60, table of contents
AB  - Shivering is a frequent complication in the postoperative period. The relative
      efficacy of interventions that are used for the treatment of postoperative
      shivering is not well understood. We performed a systematic search (MEDLINE,
      EMBASE, Cochrane Library, hand searching, all languages, to August, 2000) for
      full reports of randomized comparisons of any pharmacological antishivering
      intervention (active) with placebo (control) in the postoperative period.
      Dichotomous data on absence of further shivering after treatment and adverse
      effects were extracted from original reports. Relative risk (RR) and
      number-needed-to-treat (NNT) were calculated with 95% confidence interval (CI)
      using a fixed effect model. Data from 20 trials (944 adults received an active
      intervention, 413 were controls) were analyzed. Antishivering efficacy depended
      on the active regimen and the length of follow-up. Efficacy with meperidine 25
      mg, clonidine 150 microg, ketanserin 10 mg, and doxapram 100 mg was reported in
      at least three trials; all were significantly more effective than control. After 
      1 min, the NNT of meperidine 25 mg for no further shivering compared with placebo
      was 2.7 (RR, 6.8; 95% CI, 2.5-18.5). After 5 min, the NNT of meperidine 25 mg was
      1.3 (RR, 9.6; 95% CI, 5.7-16), the NNT of clonidine 150 microg was 1.3 (RR, 6.8; 
      95% CI, 3.3-14.2), the NNT of doxapram 100 mg was 1.7 (RR 4.0; 95% CI, 2.4-6.5), 
      and the NNT of ketanserin 10 mg was 2.3 (RR 3.1; 95% CI, 1.9-5.1). After 10 min, 
      the NNT of meperidine 25 mg was 1.5 (RR 4.0; 95% CI, 2.5-6.2). After 15 min, the 
      NNT of ketanserin 10 mg was 3.3 (RR 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-1.9). Long-term outcome data
      were lacking. There were not enough data for alfentanil, fentanyl, morphine,
      nalbuphine, lidocaine, magnesium, metamizol, methylphenidate, nefopam,
      pentazocine, and tramadol to draw meaningful conclusions. Reporting of adverse
      drug reactions was sparse. Fewer than two shivering patients need to be treated
      with meperidine 25 mg, clonidine 150 microg, or doxapram 100 mg for one to stop
      shivering within 5 min who would have continued to shiver had they all received a
      placebo. IMPLICATIONS: Less than two shivering patients need to be treated with
      meperidine 25 mg, clonidine 150 microg, or doxapram 100 mg for one to stop
      shivering within 5 min who would have continued to shiver had they all received a
      placebo.

TI  - Adjunctive high-dose glycine in the treatment of schizophrenia.
PG  - 385-91
AB  - Glycine is an agonist at brain N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and crosses the
      blood-brain barrier following high-dose oral administration. In a previous study,
      significant improvements in negative and cognitive symptoms were observed in a
      group of 21 schizophrenic patients receiving high-dose glycine in addition to
      antipsychotic treatment. This study evaluated the degree to which symptom
      improvements might be related to alterations in antipsychotic drug levels in an
      additional group of 12 subjects. Glycine treatment was associated with an 8-fold 
      increase in serum glycine levels, similar to that observed previously. A
      significant 34% reduction in negative symptoms was observed during glycine
      treatment. Serum antipsychotic levels were not significantly altered. Significant
      clinical effects were observed despite the fact that the majority of subjects
      were receiving atypical antipsychotics (clozapine or olanzapine). As in earlier
      studies, improvement persisted following glycine discontinuation.

TI  - Clinical advantages of amisulpride in the treatment of acute schizophrenia.
PG  - 451-66
AB  - Five studies have been conducted with the atypical anti-psychotic amisulpride
      (100-1200 mg/day) involving 1358 patients with acute exacerbations of
      schizophrenia; four studies were short-term (4-8 weeks), double-blind studies and
      one was a 12-month, open, randomized comparison. Amisulpride improved positive
      symptoms consistently, and changes were more pronounced than with haloperidol,
      flupenthixol and risperidone; amisulpride showed a more rapid onset of action
      compared to haloperidol, and improvement in negative symptoms was more effective 
      than with any comparator. An optimum response was obtained with amisulpride doses
      400-800 mg/day. The long-term study confirmed the usefulness of amisulpride for
      maintenance treatment in schizophrenia, with a clear advantage over haloperidol, 
      leading to better functioning and quality of life. Amisulpride caused fewer
      neurological side-effects than conventional anti-psychotics and less weight gain 
      than risperidone, both of which are crucial factors for long-term compliance.

TI  - Risperidone in the treatment of tourette syndrome: a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 31-9
AB  - A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed to determine the efficacy 
      and tolerability of 8 weeks of treatment with risperidone in the management of 48
      adolescent and adult patients with Tourette syndrome. Twenty-four patients were
      randomly assigned to treatment with risperidone in doses of 0.5 to 6.0 mg/day,
      and 24 were assigned to placebo. The dosage of medication was increased in fixed 
      increments during the first week of double-blind treatment and thereafter in a
      flexible dose regimen according to clinical response. Risperidone, at a median
      dose of 2.5 mg/day (range, 1 to 6 mg/day), was found to be significantly ( p <
      0.05) superior to placebo on the Global Severity Rating of the Tourette Syndrome 
      Severity Scale. The proportion of patients who improved by at least one point on 
      this seven-point scale was 60.8% in the risperidone group and 26.1% in the
      placebo group. Treatment with risperidone was accompanied by an improvement in
      global functioning in patients with average to above-average impairment at
      baseline as measured by the Global Assessment of Functioning scale. With respect 
      to extrapyramidal symptom scores measured on the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating
      Scale, hypokinesia and tremor increased in the risperidone group, but the effect 
      on tremor was largely confined to subjects with higher baseline tremor scores.
      There were no significant differences in dystonic reactions, dyskinetic
      movements, subjective parkinsonism, or akathisia. Risperidone did not increase
      obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Fatigue and somnolence were the most common
      adverse events associated with risperidone.

TI  - Bupropion versus selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors for treatment of
      depression.
PG  - 1608-13
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the benefits and risks of bupropion and selective
      serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in adults with depression. DATA SOURCES:
      MEDLINE (1966-September 1999), Embase (1980-August 1999), PsyclNFO (1887-August
      1999), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-August 1999), and CIANHL
      databases were searched. References from the selected citations, review articles,
      and the manufacturer were also screened. STUDY SELECTION: Included studies were
      randomized, double-blind, controlled trials evaluating bupropion versus SSRIs for
      depression in adults. Studies were assessed independently in duplicate.
      Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. DATA ANALYSIS: Data are reported as
      absolute weighted mean differences or relative risks and 95% confidence intervals
      comparing bupropion relative to SSRIs. Data not combined are presented
      qualitatively. DATA SYNTHESIS: Six full-length studies were included of 257
      citations identified. SSRI comparators were fluoxetine, sertraline, and
      paroxetine. No differences in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and
      Clinical Global Impressions Scale for Improvement of illness (CGI-I) were found, 
      but data were not able to be quantitatively combined. The absolute weighted mean 
      differences were 0.10 (95% CI -0.2 to 0.4) for the CGI for Severity of Illness
      and 0.37 (95% CI -0.85 to 1.6) for the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety
      measurements. Relative risks of bupropion compared with SSRIs were 0.6 (95% CI
      0.41 to 0.89), 0.31 (95% CI 0.16 to 0.57), and 0.27 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.48) for
      nausea, diarrhea, and somnolence, respectively. Sexual arousal disorder, orgasmic
      dysfunction, and sexual desire disorder occurred less with bupropion than with
      SSRIs, with relative risks of 0.46 (95% CI 0.26 to 0.83), 0.22 (95% CI 0.12 to
      0.40), and 0.65 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.84), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Bupropion and
      SSRIs have similar effectiveness; however, bupropion was associated with less
      nausea, diarrhea, somnolence, and sexual dysfunction.

TI  - Risk of extrapyramidal syndromes with haloperidol, risperidone, or olanzapine.
PG  - 1517-22
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the risk of extrapyramidal syndrome (EPS) between
      risperidone, olanzapine, and haloperidol, taking into account patients' past
      antipsychotic drug use and past EPS. METHODS: Data were obtained from the
      PHARMO-database, containing filled prescriptions of 450,000 community-dwelling
      people in the Netherlands from 1986 through 1999. We defined cohorts of
      first-time users of haloperidol, risperidone, or olanzapine aged 15 to 54 years. 
      In the first 90 days of treatment, we assessed the occurrence of EPS, defined as 
      first use of any antiparkinsonian agent. We estimated relative risks of EPS for
      risperidone and olanzapine versus haloperidol using a Cox proportional hazards
      model. Patients were subdivided according to prior use of antipsychotic and
      antiparkinsonian drugs. RESULTS: We identified 424 patients starting treatment
      with haloperidol, 243 with risperidone, and 181 with olanzapine. Prior use of
      antipsychotic plus antiparkinsonian medication was significantly more frequent
      among users of risperidone and olanzapine than in those using haloperidol (36.2%,
      40.3%, and 4.5%, respectively; p < 0.001). Within most subgroups of comparable
      treatment history, patients using risperidone and olanzapine showed reduced risks
      of EPS compared with haloperidol, although some of these findings did not reach
      statistical significance (RR 0.03-0.22). However, this was not observed for
      patients using risperidone who had experienced EPS in the past (RR 1.30; 95% CI
      0.24 to 7.18). CONCLUSIONS: In general, we observed reduced risks of EPS for
      risperidone and olanzapine compared with haloperidol within subgroups of patients
      with a similar treatment history. However, the added value of risperidone in
      patients who have experienced EPS in the past needs further study.

TI  - Efficacy of olanzapine in combination with valproate or lithium in the treatment 
      of mania in patients partially nonresponsive to valproate or lithium monotherapy.
PG  - 62-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: A 6-week double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was
      conducted to determine the efficacy of combined therapy with olanzapine and
      either valproate or lithium compared with valproate or lithium alone in treating 
      acute manic or mixed bipolar episodes. METHODS: The primary objective was to
      evaluate the efficacy of olanzapine (5-20 mg/d) vs placebo when added to ongoing 
      mood-stabilizer therapy as measured by reductions in Young Mania Rating Scale
      (YMRS) scores. Patients with bipolar disorder (n = 344), manic or mixed episode, 
      who were inadequately responsive to more than 2 weeks of lithium or valproate
      therapy, were randomized to receive cotherapy (olanzapine + mood-stabilizer) or
      monotherapy (placebo + mood-stabilizer). RESULTS: Olanzapine cotherapy improved
      patients' YMRS total scores significantly more than monotherapy (-13.11 vs -9.10;
      P = .003). Clinical response rates (> or = 50% improvement on YMRS) were
      significantly higher with cotherapy (67.7% vs 44.7%; P< .001). Olanzapine
      cotherapy improved 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-21) total
      scores significantly more than monotherapy (4.98 vs 0.89 points; P< .001). In
      patients with mixed-episodes with moderate to severe depressive symptoms (DSM-IV 
      mixed episode; HAMD-21 score of > or = 20 at baseline), olanzapine cotherapy
      improved HAMD-21 scores by 10.31 points compared with 1.57 for monotherapy (P<
      .001). Extrapyramidal symptoms (Simpson-Angus Scale, Barnes Akathisia Scale,
      Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale) were not significantly changed from baseline
      to end point in either treatment group. Treatment-emergent symptoms that were
      significantly higher for the olanzapine cotherapy group included somnolence, dry 
      mouth, weight gain, increased appetite, tremor, and slurred speech. CONCLUSION:
      Compared with the use of valproate or lithium alone, the addition of olanzapine
      provided superior efficacy in the treatment of manic and mixed bipolar episodes.

TI  - A systematic review of adjuncts for intravenous regional anesthesia for surgical 
      procedures.
PG  - 32-45
AB  - PURPOSE: To review the use of adjuncts to intravenous regional anesthesia (IVRA) 
      for surgical procedures in terms of their intraoperative effects (efficacy of
      block and tourniquet pain) and postoperative analgesia. SOURCE: A systematic
      search (Medline, Embase, reference lists) for randomized, controlled and
      double-blinded studies using adjuncts to IVRA for surgical procedures was
      conducted. Data were collected on intraoperative effects (onset/offset and
      quality of block and tourniquet pain), postoperative effects (pain intensity and 
      analgesic consumption) and side effects recorded. Statistical significance as
      indicated in the original report and likely clinical relevance were taken into
      account to arrive at a judgment of overall benefit. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:
      Twenty-nine studies met all inclusion criteria. Data on 1,217 study subjects are 
      included. Adjuncts used were opioids (fentanyl, meperidine, morphine,
      sufentanil), tramadol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; ketorolac, 
      tenoxicam, acetyl-salicylate), clonidine, muscle relaxants (atracurium,
      pancuronium, mivacurium), alkalinization with sodium bicarbonate, potassium and
      temperature. There is good evidence to recommend NSAIDs in general and ketorolac 
      in particular, for improving postoperative analgesia. Clonidine 1 microg/kg also 
      appears to improve postoperative analgesia and prolong tourniquet tolerance.
      Opioids are poor by this route; only meperidine 30 mg or more has substantial
      postoperative benefit but at the expense of postdeflation nausea, vomiting and
      dizziness. Muscle relaxants improve intraoperative motor block and aid fracture
      reduction. CONCLUSION: Using NSAIDs or clonidine as adjuncts to IVRA improves
      postoperative analgesia and muscle relaxant improves motor block.

TI  - A comparison of risperidone and haloperidol for the prevention of relapse in
      patients with schizophrenia.
PG  - 16-22
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prevention of relapse is a major goal of maintenance treatment in
      patients with psychotic disorders. We performed a long-term comparison of a
      newer, atypical antipsychotic drug, risperidone, and an older, conventional
      neuroleptic drug, haloperidol, in terms of the rate of relapse in patients with
      schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. METHODS: In a double-blind,
      prospective study at 40 sites, we randomly assigned adult outpatients in stable
      condition with chronic schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder to receive
      treatment with flexible doses of either risperidone or haloperidol for a minimum 
      of one year. RESULTS: Of the 397 patients who underwent randomization, data from 
      2 were excluded because they did not receive study medication; data from all 30
      patients from one site were excluded by the sponsor, the Janssen Research
      Foundation, because of concern about the integrity of the data. The median
      duration of treatment was 364 days in the risperidone group and 238 days in the
      haloperidol group (P=0.02). Of the 177 patients assigned to risperidone and the
      188 assigned to haloperidol who remained in the analysis, 44.1 percent and 52.7
      percent, respectively, discontinued treatment for reasons other than relapse. The
      Kaplan-Meier estimate of the risk of relapse at the end of the study was 34
      percent for the risperidone group and 60 percent for the haloperidol group
      (P<0.001); the risk ratio for relapse with haloperidol, from the Cox model, was
      1.93 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.33 to 2.80; P<0.001). Early
      discontinuation of treatment for any reason was more frequent among
      haloperidol-treated patients (risk ratio, 1.52; 95 percent confidence interval,
      1.18 to 1.96). Patients in the risperidone group had greater reductions in the
      mean severity of both psychotic symptoms and extrapyramidal side effects than
      those in the haloperidol group. CONCLUSIONS: Adult outpatients with clinically
      stable schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder have a lower risk of relapse if 
      they are treated with risperidone than if they are treated with haloperidol.

TI  - Epidural administration of low-dose morphine combined with clonidine for
      postoperative analgesia after lumbar disc surgery.
PG  - 1-6
AB  - This study evaluates the efficacy and side effects of a low dose of epidural
      morphine combined with clonidine for postoperative pain relief after lumbar disc 
      surgery. In 36 of 51 patients who accepted the procedure, an epidural catheter
      was inserted (L1-L2 level). General anesthesia was induced with propofol and
      sufentanil, and maintained with sevoflurane in O2/N2O. After emergence from
      anesthesia, epidural analgesia was initiated according to two randomly assigned
      protocols: 1 mg of morphine with 75 microg of clonidine (Group M) or 12.5 mg of
      bupivacaine with 75 microg of clonidine (Group B), in 10 mL saline. Piritramide
      was administered during the first postoperative 24 hours using a
      patient-controlled analgesia device (PCA). The following parameters were
      recorded: piritramide consumption during the first 24 hours; pain at rest during 
      the first postoperative hours (D0), during the first night (D1), and during the
      first mobilization; [visual analogue scale (VAS)]; and the occurrence of
      drowsiness, motor blockade, respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting, itching,
      micturition problems, and bladder catheterization during D0 and D1. Epidural
      administration of morphine-clonidine significantly improved postoperative pain
      relief and reduced piritramide consumption as compared to epidural
      bupivacaine-clonidine. Side effects did not differ between groups except for a
      higher incidence of micturition problems in Group M during D1. The occurrence of 
      bladder catheterization was not significantly higher in that group. We conclude
      that a low dose of epidural morphine combined with clonidine offers a better
      postoperative analgesia than does bupivacaine-clonidine. The excellent analgesic 
      conditions were obtained at the expense of a higher incidence of difficulties in 
      initiating micturition.

TI  - Dolasetron for preventing postanesthetic shivering.
PG  - 106-11, table of contents
AB  - We designed this study to assess the efficacy of dolasetron compared with
      clonidine and placebo in prophylaxis of postanesthetic shivering. We included 90 
      patients undergoing elective abdominal or urologic surgery. The patients were
      randomly assigned to one three groups (each group n = 30) using a double-blinded 
      study protocol: Group A received 12.5 mg dolasetron, Group B 3 microg/kg
      clonidine, and Group C saline 0.9% as placebo. The medication was given after the
      induction of anesthesia. Postanesthetic shivering was judged by using a
      five-point scale. In the Clonidine group, 86.6% showed no shivering, whereas in
      the Dolasetron and Placebo groups, only 63.3% and 66.6%, respectively, were
      symptom free. Only clonidine, but not dolasetron, significantly reduced the
      incidence and the severity of shivering. We conclude that clonidine is effective 
      in preventing shivering when given before surgery, whereas dolasetron, at the
      dose used, is not effective. IMPLICATIONS: Shivering, an irregular muscular
      fasciculation lasting longer than 15 s, is a common complication secondary to
      general anesthesia. We compared dolasetron with clonidine (an established
      antishivering drug) in the prevention of postanesthetic shivering. Dolasetron
      12.5 mg was not effective.

TI  - The pharmacovigilance of olanzapine: results of a post-marketing surveillance
      study on 8858 patients in England.
PG  - 265-71
AB  - Olanzapine is an 'atypical' antipsychotic indicated for the treatment of
      schizophrenia. We analysed adverse events (AEs) reported in primary practice in
      England. Dispensed prescriptions issued between December 1996 and May 1998
      provided exposure data. Questionnaires sent to general practitioners provided
      outcomes. Frequently reported AEs were: drowsiness/sedation (n = 19),
      extrapyramidal disorder (n = 13) and unspecified side-effects (n = 33). Events
      with highest incidence density in first month and reason for stopping were:
      drowsiness/sedation [n = 153, incidence density (ID)1 18.9], weight gain (n =
      117, ID1 8.9) and malaise/lassitude (n = 65, ID1 5.2). Extrapyramidal disorders
      were more common in elderly population (> 70 years, ID1 3.6, risk 26.0 per 1,000 
      patients) compared to < 70 years (ID1 1.1, risk 8.4 per 1,000 patients). Serious 
      suspected adverse reactions were neuroleptic malignant syndrome (n = 1) and
      angioneurotic ooedema (n = 2). There were eight reports of diabetes mellitus
      assessed as possibly due to olanzapine. Diabetes mellitus was an unlabelled AE
      and possible signal generated by prescription-event monitoring.

TI  - Pharmacotherapies for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: expected-cost
      analysis.
PG  - 1904-21
AB  - BACKGROUND: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common childhood
      neurobehavioral disorder characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, and
      impulsivity. Prevalence estimates in elementary school children generally range
      from 3% to 8%. ADHD is frequently treated with psychostimulant medications, which
      have been shown to improve both cognitive and behavioral outcomes for most
      children. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to estimate the total expected
      costs for the treatment and management of school-age children with ADHD using 6
      commonly prescribed pharmacotherapies: methylphenidate
      immediate-release/extended-release (MPH IR/ER), methylphenidate immediate-release
      (MPH IR), Metadate CD (branded MPH IR/ER), Concerta (branded MPH ER), Ritalin
      (branded MPH IR), and Adderall (a combination of dextroamphetamine and
      amphetamine salts). METHODS: A literature review and clinical assessment using a 
      27-question survey instrument were used to capture information on the clinical
      characteristics of ADHD, including common treatment regimens, clinical management
      of patients, pathways of care, and components of care. A meta-analysis provided
      response rates for 3 commonly used pharmacotherapies: Metadate CD, MPH IR, and
      Adderall. Information from the clinical assessment and the meta-analysis were
      used to populate a decision-analytic model to compute total expected cost for
      each comparator. RESULTS: The average total annual expected cost per patient was 
      $1,487 for Metadate CD, $1,631 for Concerta. $1,792 for MPH IR/ER, $1,845 for MPH
      IR, $2,080 for Ritalin, and $2,232 for Adderall. CONCLUSIONS: Metadate CD had the
      lowest total expected cost and Adderall had the highest total expected cost among
      the ADHD pharmacotherapies evaluated. The differences were attributable to
      differences in drug-acquisition costs and the need for in-school dosing of
      twice-daily and thrice-daily medications.

TI  - A comparison of the relative safety, efficacy, and tolerability of quetiapine and
      risperidone in outpatients with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders: the 
      quetiapine experience with safety and tolerability (QUEST) study.
PG  - 1839-54
AB  - BACKGROUND: The few published direct comparative studies of the tolerability and 
      efficacy of atypical antipsychotic agents were performed in relatively
      homogeneous populations that may not be typical of patients seen in clinical
      practice. OBJECTIVE: The Quetiapine Experience with Safety and Tolerability
      (QUEST) study compared the relative safety, tolerability, and efficacy of
      quetiapine and risperidone in outpatients with a broad range of psychotic
      symptoms. METHODS: This was a multicenter, 4-month, open-label, randomized
      clinical trial. Patients were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive quetiapine or 
      risperidone. Doses were adjusted to maximize efficacy and to minimize adverse
      events. Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) were assessed with an EPS checklist;
      adverse events were recorded. Efficacy was assessed using the Clinical Global
      Impression (CGI) scale, Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS), and Hamilton
      Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D). RESULTS: A total of 728 patients were
      randomized, 553 to quetiapine and 175 to risperidone. Mean prescribed doses over 
      the study period were 253.9 mg/d quetiapine and 4.4 mg/d risperidone. At the end 
      of 4 months, EPS declined in both treatment groups, but quetiapine-treated
      patients were significantly less likely to require dose adjustment or concurrent 
      anti-EPS medication (P < 0.001). The most common adverse events in the quetiapine
      and risperidone groups were somnolence (31.3% and 15.4%, respectively), dry mouth
      (14.5% and 6.9%), and dizziness (12.7% and 6.9%). Overall, tolerance to side
      effects with the 2 drugs, measured by dropout rates, was comparable. At each
      visit, a higher percentage of quetiapine-treated patients showed improvement on
      the CGI scale, but there were no significant between-group differences on the
      PANSS. At end point, quetiapine-treated patients had significantly lower HAM-D
      scores (P = 0.028). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that
      quetiapine is as effective as risperidone for the treatment of psychotic
      symptoms, is more effective for depressive symptoms, may have a more favorable
      EPS profile, and has comparable overall tolerability.

TI  - Therapeutic effect of pirenzepine for clozapine-induced hypersalivation: a
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study.
PG  - 608-11
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of pirenzepine in the
      treatment of clozapine-induced hypersalivation. Pirenzepine is reported to
      counteract hypersalivation by its selective antagonistic activity on the
      M4-muscarinic receptor, which is stimulated by clozapine. Twenty patients with
      clozapine-induced hypersalivation underwent a random-order, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, cross-over trial which lasted 8 weeks each for the
      pirenzepine and placebo investigations, with a 4-week washout period in between. 
      The severity of hypersalivation was assessed using an objective measure: saliva
      production monitored through the diameter of wetted surface on tissue paper
      placed over the patient's pillow. Our study showed that pirenzepine had no
      significant therapeutic effect on hypersalivation compared with placebo,
      suggesting that hypersalivation induced by clozapine might have a neurobiological
      basis other than the M4-muscarinic receptor.

TI  - A dose-ranging exploratory study of the effects of ethyl-eicosapentaenoate in
      patients with persistent schizophrenic symptoms.
PG  - 7-18
AB  - The objective was to test effects of ethyl eicosapentaenoate (E-E) on persistent 
      ongoing symptoms in patients receiving different types of anti-schizophrenic
      drugs, typical antipsychotics, new atypical antipsychotics, and clozapine. 115
      patients with DSM-IV-defined schizophrenia were studied, 31 on clozapine, 48 on
      new atypical drugs and 36 on typical antipsychotics. Placebo or 1, 2 or 4 g/day
      of E-E was given for 12 weeks in addition to the background medication. The main 
      assessment was change from baseline to 12 weeks on the PANSS and its sub-scales. 
      There were no treatment-related side effects or adverse biochemical or
      haematological effects. Patients on 2 and 4 g/day E-E showed significant
      reductions in triglyceride levels which had been elevated by clozapine. In
      patients given 2 g/day E-E there were improvements on the PANSS and its
      sub-scales, but there was also a large placebo effect in patients on typical and 
      new atypical antipsychotics and no difference between active treatment and
      placebo. In patients on clozapine, in contrast, there was little placebo
      response, but a clinically important and statistically significant effect of E-E 
      on all rating scales. This effect was greatest at 2 g/day. There was a positive
      relationship between improvement on rating scales and rise in red blood cell
      arachidonic acid concentration.

TI  - Clozapine use in patients with schizophrenia and the risk of diabetes,
      hyperlipidemia, and hypertension: a claims-based approach.
PG  - 1172-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Numerous case reports have linked clozapine to the development of
      diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia in patients with schizophrenia. However,
      investigators have been unable to clearly demonstrate this association when
      compared with a control group receiving conventional antipsychotics. METHODS:
      Medical and pharmacy claims from the Iowa Medicaid program were used to compare
      incidence rates for diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension in 552 patients
      receiving clozapine and 2461 patients receiving conventional antipsychotics (eg, 
      haloperidol, chlorpromazine hydrochloride), with the use of a retrospective
      cohort design. Logistic regression was used to compare incidence rates adjusting 
      for age, sex, and duration of available follow-up. RESULTS: No significant
      differences in overall incidence rates for diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or
      hypertension were observed in patients receiving clozapine vs conventional
      antipsychotics. However, among younger patients (aged 20-34 years), clozapine
      administration was associated with a significantly increased relative risk of
      diabetes (2.5 [95% confidence interval, 1.2-5.4]) and hyperlipidemia (2.4 [95%
      confidence interval, 1.1-5.2]), but not hypertension (0.9 [95% confidence
      interval, 0.4-2.0]). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that clozapine may not be an
      independent cause of diabetes or hyperlipidemia, but instead acts as an effect
      modifier in susceptible populations by increasing weight or affecting insulin
      secretion and resistance. This finding requires confirmation in other settings
      and patient populations and with the other atypical antipsychotics (risperidone, 
      olanzapine, and quetiapine fumarate). The potential long-term medical and
      economic implications of the early induction of diabetes and hyperlipidemia in
      patients with schizophrenia warrant further study.

TI  - Antipsychotics and the risk of sudden cardiac death.
PG  - 1161-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Case reports link antipsychotic drugs with sudden cardiac deaths,
      which is consistent with dose-related electrophysiologic effects. Because this
      association has not been confirmed in controlled studies, we conducted a
      retrospective cohort study in Tennessee Medicaid enrollees, which included many
      antipsychotic users; there were also computer files describing medication use and
      comorbidity. The study was conducted before the introduction of risperidone and, 
      thus, did not include the newer atypical agents. METHODS: The cohort included
      481,744 persons with 1,282,996 person-years of follow-up. This included 26,749
      person-years for current moderate-dose antipsychotic use (>100-mg thioridazine
      equivalents), 31,864 person-years for current low-dose antipsychotic use, 37,881 
      person-years for use in the past year only, and 1 186,501 person-years for no
      use. The cohort had 1487 confirmed sudden cardiac deaths; from these, we
      calculated multivariate rate ratios adjusted for potential confounding factors.
      RESULTS: When current moderate-dose antipsychotic use was compared with nonuse,
      the multivariate rate ratio was 2.39 (95% confidence interval, 1.77-3.22;
      P<.001). This was greater than that for current low-dose (rate ratio, 1.30; 95%
      confidence interval, 0.98-1.72; P=.003) and former (rate ratio, 1.20; 95%
      confidence interval, 0.91-1.58; P<.001) use. Among cohort members with severe
      cardiovascular disease, current moderate-dose users had a 3.53-fold (95%
      confidence interval, 1.66-7.51) increased rate relative to comparable nonusers ( 
      P<.001), resulting in 367 additional deaths per 10,000 person-years of follow-up.
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients prescribed moderate doses of antipsychotics had large
      relative and absolute increases in the risk of sudden cardiac death. Although the
      study data cannot demonstrate causality, they suggest that the potential adverse 
      cardiac effects of antipsychotics should be considered in clinical practice,
      particularly for patients with cardiovascular disease.

TI  - A double-blind randomised comparison of risperidone and haloperidol in the
      treatment of behavioural and psychological symptoms in Chinese dementia patients.
PG  - 1156-62
AB  - BACKGROUND: Behavioural and psychological symptoms (BPSD) are common during the
      course of dementia and present severe problems to patients and their caregivers. 
      OBJECTIVES: To assess the therapeutic efficacy and safety of haloperidol and
      risperidone in treating BPSD in Chinese dementia patients. METHODS: A 12-week
      double-blind randomised comparison of haloperidol and risperidone treatments was 
      conducted in 58 patients with DSM-IV diagnosis of dementia of Alzheimer's type or
      vascular dementia. They were randomly assigned to receive flexible doses (0.5 to 
      2 mg/day) of haloperidol or risperidone. Clinical response was evaluated using
      the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), the Behavioral Pathology in
      Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD), Simpson-Angus Scale, Functional
      Assessment Staging and Cantonese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination.
      RESULTS: The mean doses at the last week were 0.90 mg/day of haloperidol and 0.85
      mg/day of risperidone. Both haloperidol and risperidone significantly reduced the
      severity of BPSD (scores on CMAI and BEHAVE-AD), with no significant
      between-group differences. Haloperidol-treated patients showed a worsening on
      Simpson-Angus scale while there was no significant change in this measure in
      risperidone-treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose haloperidol and risperidone
      were well tolerated and associated with reductions in the severity and frequency 
      of behavioural symptoms in subjects with dementia. Risperidone may have a more
      favourable risk-benefit profile in view of its lower propensity to induce
      extrapyramidal symptoms.

TI  - Amisulpride: a review of its use in the management of schizophrenia.
PG  - 2123-50
AB  - Amisulpride, a substituted benzamide derivative, is a second-generation
      (atypical) antipsychotic. At low doses, it enhances dopaminergic
      neurotransmission by preferentially blocking presynaptic dopamine D2/D3
      autoreceptors. At higher doses, amisupride antagonises postsynaptic dopamine D2
      and D3 receptors, preferentially in the limbic system rather than the striatum,
      thereby reducing dopaminergic transmission. In patients with acute exacerbations 
      of schizophrenia, the recommended dosage of amisulpride is 400 to 800 mg/day,
      although dosages < or =1200 mg/day may be administered. In comparative trials,
      amisulpride administered within this range (400 to 1200 mg/day) was as effective 
      as haloperidol 5 to 40 mg/day, flupenthixol 25 mg/day and risperidone 8 mg/day in
      patients with acute exacerbations of schizophrenia with predominantly positive
      symptoms. Amisulpride was more effective than haloperidol but equally effective
      as risperidone in controlling negative symptoms. Amisulpride 400 to 800 mg/day
      was more effective than haloperidol, risperidone and flupenthixol in controlling 
      affective symptoms in these patients. In randomised, double-blind trials
      involving patients with predominantly negative symptoms of schizophrenia,
      amisulpride 50 to 300 mg/day was more effective than placebo. Amisulpride is
      effective as maintenance therapy in patients with chronic schizophrenia.
      Long-term treatment with amisulpride was associated with improvements in quality 
      of life and social functioning. Amisulpride is generally well tolerated. In
      well-controlled trials, the neurological tolerability profile (including ratings 
      on extrapyramidal symptom scales) of amisulpride 400 to 1200 mg/day was superior 
      to that of the conventional antipsychotics (haloperidol or flupenthixol), but was
      similar to that of the atypical antipsychotic risperidone. At low dosages of
      amisulpride (< or =300 mg/day), the incidence of adverse events (including
      extrapyramidal symptoms) reported with amisulpride was similar to that with
      placebo. CONCLUSION: In comparative trials, amisulpride 400 to 1200 mg/day showed
      efficacy in reducing overall symptomatology and positive symptoms similar to that
      of conventional antipsychotics and newer atypical antipsychotics in patients with
      acute exacerbations of schizophrenia. Moreover, its effective alleviation of
      negative and affective symptoms, its lower association with extrapyramidal
      symptoms and loss of cognitive function than conventional antipsychotics and its 
      long-term efficacy justifies consideration of the use of higher dosages of
      amisulpride in this group of patients. Consequently, the dosage of amisulpride
      that is recommended in patients with acute exacerbations of schizophrenia is 400 
      to 800 mg/day, although dosages < or =1200 mg/day may be administered. Lower
      dosages of amisulpride (50 to 300 mg/day) should be considered for the management
      of patients with negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Amisulpride is a first-line 
      treatment option in the management of schizophrenia in the acute phase and for
      the maintenance of treatment response.

TI  - Clonidine provides opioid-sparing effect, stable hemodynamics, and renal
      integrity during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
PG  - 1331-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum causes a hemodynamic stress response 
      and decreases urine output because of an activated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone 
      system (RAAS). Clonidine is a potent antihypertensive drug that suppresses RAAS. 
      METHODS: The effects of clonidine 4.5 mg/kg or saline on hemodynamics,
      neuroendocrine response, and renal parameters were compared in 30 healthy
      patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. RESULTS: Heart rate, arterial
      blood pressures, and plasma renin activity were lower during and after
      pneumoperitoneum in patients with clonidine. There were no differences in urine
      output, urine oxygen tension (reflecting medullary perfusion), or antidiuretic
      hormone between the groups. N-acetyl-b-D-glucosaminidase, a marker of proximal
      tubular damage, was minimally elevated after clonidine. CONCLUSIONS: Clonidine
      enabled stable hemodynamics and prevented activation of RAAS seen as unchanged
      plasma renin activity. Clonidine may be beneficial during laparoscopy in patients
      with hypertension, cardiovascular, and/or renal diseases.

TI  - A dose response study of clonidine with local anesthetic mixture for peribulbar
      block: a comparison of three doses.
PG  - 1593-7, table of contents
AB  - Clonidine prolongs anesthesia and analgesia of local anesthetics in various
      neural blocks as well as the duration of retrobulbar block. We assessed the
      dose-response relationship of clonidine added to lidocaine in peribulbar block.
      Sixty patients undergoing cataract surgery were given peribulbar block with 7 mL 
      of 2% lidocaine and hyaluronidase with either saline (Control) or clonidine in
      0.5-microg/kg (0.5 Clon), 1.0-microg/kg (1.0 Clon), or 1.5-microg/kg (1.5 Clon)
      doses. The onset and duration of lid and globe akinesia, globe anesthesia and
      analgesia, postoperative analgesic requirement, and adverse effects (hypotension,
      bradycardia, hypoxia, sedation, and dizziness) were recorded. The success rate
      and onset of block were comparable in all groups. The duration of lid and globe
      akinesia, globe anesthesia and analgesia was significantly (P < 0.01) prolonged
      in patients receiving 1.0 and 1.5 microg/kg clonidine as compared with the
      Control group. Perioperative pain scores and analgesic requirement were
      significantly less in these groups. 0.5 microg/kg clonidine did not increase the 
      duration of anesthesia and analgesia significantly. Hypotension and dizziness
      were observed more in patients receiving 1.5 microg/kg clonidine as compared with
      other groups. We conclude that 1.0 microg/kg clonidine with a mixture of
      lidocaine (2%) significantly prolonged the duration of anesthesia and analgesia
      after peribulbar block with limited side effects. IMPLICATIONS: We studied the
      effect of the addition of 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 microg/kg clonidine to a
      lidocaine-hyaluronidase mixture on the onset and duration of peribulbar block and
      perioperative analgesia. A dose of 1.0 microg/kg produced a significant increase 
      in duration of anesthesia and analgesia with minimal side effects.

TI  - Neostigmine combined with bupivacaine, clonidine, and sufentanil for spinal labor
      analgesia.
PG  - 1560-4, table of contents
AB  - We previously found that spinal clonidine prolongs labor analgesia when combined 
      with spinal bupivacaine and sufentanil. We sought to determine whether the
      addition of spinal neostigmine to these drugs would further enhance labor
      analgesia. By use of a combined spinal/epidural technique, 36 patients were
      randomized to receive a hyperbaric spinal injection of bupivacaine 2.5 mg plus
      clonidine 50 microg and sufentanil 10 microg with or without neostigmine 10
      microg. Pain, maternal hemodynamics, fetal heart rate, nausea, pruritus,
      sedation, motor block, sensory levels to pinprick, and maternal oxygen saturation
      were assessed at regularly specified intervals after spinal injection until
      additional analgesia was requested. The duration of spinal analgesia was similar 
      between groups (215 +/- 60 min in the Control group versus 205 +/- 62 min in the 
      Neostigmine group). Likewise, pain scores, the duration of labor, Apgar scores,
      and side effects were similar between groups except that patients administered
      neostigmine experienced significantly more nausea and vomiting (53% vs 7%, P =
      0.01). We conclude that spinal neostigmine 10 microg produces severe nausea and
      does not potentiate the duration of spinal analgesia in laboring women from
      spinal bupivacaine, clonidine, and sufentanil. IMPLICATIONS: Spinal neostigmine
      10 microg as an adjunct to spinal bupivacaine, clonidine, and sufentanil produces
      severe nausea and fails to potentiate analgesia in laboring women.

TI  - Euglycemic clamp study in clozapine-induced diabetic ketoacidosis.
PG  - 1381-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the fifth case of clozapine-induced diabetic ketoacidosis 
      (DKA) with complete resolution of abnormal glucose metabolism after
      discontinuation of clozapine as assessed by oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT)
      and the first to be serially studied with markers of pancreatic autoimmunity; to 
      demonstrate insulin resistance using the euglycemic clamp study and reduced
      pancreatic insulin reserve using intravenous glucose tolerance testing (IVGTT) in
      clozapine-induced diabetes mellitus and DKA, when the OGTT was normal; and to
      systematically review the previously described cases of clozapine-induced
      diabetes mellitus and DKA. CASE SUMMARY: A 33-year-old white man without past or 
      family history of diabetes mellitus presented with DKA after eight months of
      clozapine therapy (50 mg twice daily). After treatment of DKA and discontinuation
      of clozapine, glucose tolerance and concurrent serum insulin concentrations
      reverted to normal as measured by two OGTT performed 60 and 320 days after
      resolution of DKA. DISCUSSION: Antiislet-cell antibodies, antiglutamic acid
      decarboxylase antibodies, and human insulin antibody were negative on two
      separate occasions. Euglycemic clamp study demonstrated insulin resistance
      manifested by a glucose disposal rate of approximately 55% of mean normal values.
      IVGTT demonstrated a low rate of glucose disappearance (KG = 0.95) and diminished
      first-phase insulin response when OGTT was normal, indicating impairment in
      insulin sensitivity and reduction in beta cell function 323 days after
      discontinuance of clozapine. This adverse reaction is considered probable
      according to the Naranjo probability scale. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of cases 
      of DKA and new or worsening diabetes mellitus in patients using clozapine
      suggests a causal relationship. We hypothesize that the mechanism by which
      clozapine may produce glucose intolerance may require a preexisting latent defect
      in insulin secretion and insulin action. With the administration of clozapine,
      some of these patients may develop worsening insulin resistance and may fail to
      mount an appropriate compensatory beta cell insulin secretion for the degree of
      insulin resistance. As a consequence, hyperglycemia develops and its persistence 
      results in glucose toxicity, further suppressing beta cell insulin secretion.
      Such combined defects in insulin secretion and sensitivity are known to be
      synergistic, leading to the development of abnormal glucose tolerance, which can 
      be clinically manifested as a spectrum ranging from impaired glucose tolerance
      through severe hyperglycemia to DKA. Patients being started on clozapine should
      be carefully followed for the development or worsening of diabetes mellitus,
      regardless of the dose of the drug.

TI  - Loss of dopamine transporters in methamphetamine abusers recovers with protracted
      abstinence.
PG  - 9414-8
AB  - Methamphetamine is a popular drug of abuse that is neurotoxic to dopamine (DA)
      terminals when administered to laboratory animals. Studies in methamphetamine
      abusers have also documented significant loss of DA transporters (used as markers
      of the DA terminal) that are associated with slower motor function and decreased 
      memory. The extent to which the loss of DA transporters predisposes
      methamphetamine abusers to neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinsonism is
      unclear and may depend in part on the degree of recovery. Here we assessed the
      effects of protracted abstinence on the loss of DA transporters in striatum, in
      methamphetamine abusers using positron emission tomography and
      [(11)C]d-threo-methylphenidate (DA transporter radioligand). Brain DA
      transporters in five methamphetamine abusers evaluated during short abstinence
      (<6 months) and then retested during protracted abstinence (12-17 months) showed 
      significant increases with protracted abstinence (caudate, +19%; putamen, +16%). 
      Although performance in some of the tests for which we observed an association
      with DA transporters showed some improvement, this effect was not significant.
      The DA transporter increases with abstinence could indicate that
      methamphetamine-induced DA transporter loss reflects temporary adaptive changes
      (i.e., downregulation), that the loss reflects DA terminal damage but that
      terminals can recover, or that remaining viable terminals increase synaptic
      arborization. Because neuropsychological tests did not improve to the same
      extent, this suggests that the increase of the DA transporters was not sufficient
      for complete function recovery. These findings have treatment implications
      because they suggest that protracted abstinence may reverse some of
      methamphetamine-induced alterations in brain DA terminals.

TI  - Risperidone versus haloperidol in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic
      inpatients with schizophrenia: a randomized double-blind study.
PG  - 325-30
AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of risperidone
      and haloperidol in treatment-resistant chronic schizophrenic patients. Subjects
      (n = 78) who met DSM-III criteria for schizophrenia were randomly assigned to
      receive 6 mg/day of risperidone or 20 mg/day of haloperidol for 12 weeks.
      Clinical efficacy was determined using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale
      (PANSS), and side-effects with the Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS).
      Risperidone produced a mean 39.8 +/- 24.1% reduction in total PANSS score
      compared to a mean 28.3 + 19.4% reduction in the haloperidol group (P < 0.05).
      Analysis of changes for the three subscores of the PANSS revealed that the
      general psychopathology and negative subscores were significantly improved in the
      risperidone group compared to the haloperidol group. As for the side-effects, the
      risperidone group showed a significantly lower TESS total score, as well as
      nervous system symptoms subscore and cardiovascular symptoms subscore, compared
      to the haloperidol group. Risperidone appears to be a more effective and better
      tolerated antipsychotic drug in treatment-refractory Chinese schizophrenia than
      haloperidol.

TI  - Effects of risperidone on aberrant behavior of persons with developmental
      disabilities: I. A double-blind crossover study using multiple measures.
PG  - 525-38
AB  - The efficacy of the atypical antipsychotic risperidone was evaluated in the
      treatment of aberrant behavior (e.g., aggression, self-injury) in 20 individuals 
      with developmental disabilities. A double-blind, crossover design was used to
      compare risperidone with placebo in a 22-week trial with a 6-month follow-up
      phase. Based on a 50% reduction in mean Aberrant Behavior Checklist--Community
      total scores, 50% of the participants were identified as responders. Naturalistic
      observations of a subset of five individuals showed that for 4 out of 5
      participants, risperidone was effective in reducing aberrant behavior. Side
      effects included weight gain (84% of participants) and sedation (40% of
      participants). The advantages of conducting a comprehensive analysis of the
      effects of medication on aberrant behavior are discussed.

TI  - Double-blind, randomized trial of bupropion SR for the treatment of neuropathic
      pain.
PG  - 1583-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of bupropion
      sustained-release (SR) for the treatment of neuropathic pain. METHOD: This
      single-center, outpatient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      crossover study consisted of two phases. Forty-one nondepressed patients with
      neuropathic pain spent 6 weeks in each phase in random order and received
      identical tablets of 150 mg bupropion SR or placebo. Patients were instructed to 
      take one tablet once daily for 1 week followed by one tablet twice daily for 5
      weeks. RESULTS: While the patients took bupropion SR, neuropathic pain relief was
      improved or much improved in 30 (73%) patients, and one of these patients became 
      pain-free. The mean average pain score at baseline was 5.7, which remained
      unchanged at the end of week 6 with placebo, but decreased by 1.7 points to 4.0
      (p < 0.001) during therapy with bupropion SR. Pain relief with bupropion SR was
      significant at week 2 (p < 0.05) and continued throughout weeks 3 through 6 (p < 
      0.001). A significant decrease in interference of pain on quality of life was
      observed while patients were receiving bupropion SR compared with placebo. Side
      effects experienced with bupropion SR were not dose-limiting and consisted
      primarily of dry mouth, insomnia, headache, gastrointestinal upset, tremor,
      constipation, and dizziness. CONCLUSION: This placebo-controlled crossover trial 
      showed that bupropion SR (150-300 mg daily) was effective and well tolerated for 
      the treatment of neuropathic pain.

TI  - Olanzapine: a review of its use in the treatment of bipolar I disorder.
PG  - 871-904
AB  - Olanzapine, a thienobenzodiazepine derivative, is a psychotropic agent that has
      shown efficacy in the treatment of patients with bipolar I disorder. Olanzapine
      has a multireceptorial binding profile including a greater affinity for serotonin
      5-HT(2A) than for dopamine D(2) receptors. Olanzapine 5 to 20 mg/day demonstrated
      significantly greater antimanic efficacy than placebo in two double-blind,
      randomised 3- or 4-week trials of patients with bipolar I disorder of either
      manic or mixed episodes, with or without psychotic features. Additionally, in one
      of these trials, improvements in cognitive function and hostility were superior
      with olanzapine. In cohorts of severely depressed and rapid cycling patients,
      improvements in manic and depressive symptoms and in manic symptoms only, were
      superior with olanzapine compared with placebo. Significant improvements from
      baseline in symptoms of mania, depression, cognitive functioning and hostility
      were seen with olanzapine in a 49-week extension phase study. In double-blind
      trials, olanzapine 10 mg/day appeared to have similar antimanic efficacy to oral 
      lithium 400mg twice daily in the treatment of patients with pure mania (4-week
      small study). In patients with acute manic or mixed episodes olanzapine 5 to 20
      mg/day appeared to be more effective than oral valproate semisodium (divalproex
      sodium) 500 to 2500 mg/day (3-week study) and at least as effective as oral
      haloperidol 3 to 15 mg/day (12-week study). Preliminary results from a large
      6-week placebo-controlled study suggest that olanzapine 5 to 20 mg/day in
      combination with mood stabilisers (lithium or valproate semisodium) provides
      effective augmentation of antimanic treatment of patients with bipolar I
      disorder, with benefits seen in the first week. Adverse events reported
      significantly more often with olanzapine than with placebo were somnolence, dry
      mouth, dizziness and bodyweight gain, and in comparison with valproate semisodium
      were somnolence, dry mouth, increased appetite and bodyweight gain. Olanzapine
      was generally well tolerated with no clinically relevant abnormalities in
      laboratory tests, vital signs or electrocardiogram results. CONCLUSION:
      Olanzapine demonstrated superior efficacy compared with placebo in the short-term
      treatment of patients with bipolar I disorder with manic or mixed episodes, with 
      or without psychotic features, and was generally well tolerated. According to
      preliminary data the antimanic efficacy of olanzapine appears similar to that of 
      haloperidol and better than that of valproate semisodium in patients with bipolar
      I disorder experiencing a manic or mixed episode; among nonpsychotic patients
      with manic or mixed episodes olanzapine appears to be superior to haloperidol.
      Available data support the choice of olanzapine as an option in the short-term
      management of mania in patients with bipolar I disorder with manic or mixed
      episodes, with or without psychotic features.

TI  - Analgesia for circumcision in a paediatric population: comparison of caudal
      bupivacaine alone with bupivacaine plus two doses of clonidine.
PG  - 695-700
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clonidine is often used to improve the duration and quality of
      analgesia produced by caudal epidural blockade, although the optimum dose of
      clonidine with bupivacaine remains uncertain. METHODS: We compared the effect of 
      clonidine, 1 and 2 microg x kg(-1), added to bupivacaine (1.25 mg x kg(-1)) with 
      that of bupivacaine alone in 75 male children undergoing elective circumcision.
      RESULTS: There was a trend towards increasing duration of analgesia with
      increasing dose of clonidine [group B (bupivacaine) 280.7 (171.6) min, C1
      (bupivacaine + clonidine 1 microg x kg(-1)) 327.8 (188.3) min and C2 (bupivacaine
      + clonidine 2 microg x kg(-1)) 382.0 (200.6) min], although this difference was
      not statistically significant. Mean time to arousal from anaesthesia was
      significantly prolonged with clonidine 2 microg kg(-1) (group C2 21.3 (13-36)
      min, group C1 14.0 (6-25) min and group B 14.4 (2-32) min. Supplementary
      analgesic requirements and incidence of adverse effects were low, with no
      differences between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: For paediatric circumcision, under
      general anaesthesia, the addition of clonidine 2 microg x kg(-1) to low volume
      (0.5 ml x kg(-1)) caudal anaesthetics has a limited clinical benefit for children
      undergoing circumcision.

TI  - How to prolong postoperative analgesia after caudal anaesthesia with ropivacaine 
      in children: S-ketamine versus clonidine.
PG  - 679-83
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to determine whether caudal S-ketamine or
      clonidine prolonged analgesia together with ropivacaine. METHODS: Sixty-three
      boys, aged 1-5 years, who were undergoing minor surgery, were allocated in order 
      to receive one of three solutions for caudal anaesthesia. Group R received 2 mg x
      kg(-1) 0.2% ropivacaine; group C, 2 mg x kg(-1) 0.2% ropivacaine + clonidine 2
      microg x kg(-1); and group K, 2 mg x kg(-1) 0.2% ropivacaine + S-ketamine 0.5 mg 
      x kg(-1). RESULTS: Postoperative analgesia assessed by CHEOPS lasted 701 min in
      group K (P < 0.05) compared with 492 min in group C and 291 min in group R. There
      were no significant differences between the groups for incidence of haemodynamic 
      and respiratory alterations, motor block or sedation. CONCLUSIONS: This study
      demonstrates that S-ketamine 0.5 mg x kg(-1) when added to 0.2% caudal
      ropivacaine provides better postoperative analgesia than clonidine without any
      clinically significant side-effect.

TI  - Clozapine and haloperidol in moderately refractory schizophrenia: a 6-month
      randomized and double-blind comparison.
PG  - 965-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the demonstrated efficacy of clozapine in severely refractory
      schizophrenia, questions remain regarding its efficacy for primary negative
      symptoms, comparison with a moderate dose of a first-generation antipsychotic,
      and adverse effects during a longer-term trial. This study examined its efficacy 
      in partially responsive, community-based patients, compared clozapine with
      moderate-dose haloperidol, and extended treatment to 6 months. METHODS:
      Randomized, double-blind, 29-week trial comparing clozapine (n = 37) with
      haloperidol (n = 34). Subjects with schizophrenia who were being treated in
      community settings at 3 collaborating clinical facilities were enrolled. RESULTS:
      Subjects treated with haloperidol were significantly more likely to discontinue
      treatment for lack of efficacy (51%) than were those treated with clozapine
      (12%). A higher proportion of clozapine-treated subjects met an a priori
      criterion of improvement (57%) compared with haloperidol-treated subjects (25%). 
      Significantly greater improvement was seen in symptoms of psychosis,
      hostile-suspiciousness, anxiety-depression, thought disturbance, and total score 
      measured on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. No differences were detected in
      negative symptoms using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale or the Schedule for
      Assessment of Negative Symptoms. Subjects treated with clozapine experienced more
      excess salivation, dizziness, and sweating and less dry mouth and decreased
      appetite than those treated with haloperidol. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with a
      first-generation antipsychotic given in a moderate dose, clozapine offers
      substantial clinical benefits to treatment-refractory subjects who can be treated
      in the community. Advantages are seen in a broad range of symptoms but do not
      extend to negative symptoms.

TI  - Plasma lidocaine concentrations during continuous thoracic epidural anesthesia
      after clonidine premedication in children.
PG  - 1147-51
AB  - There is no report concerning oral clonidine's effects on epidural lidocaine in
      children. Therefore, we performed a study to assess the concentrations of plasma 
      lidocaine and its major metabolite (monoethylglycinexylidide [MEGX]) in children 
      receiving continuous thoracic epidural anesthesia after oral clonidine
      premedication. Ten pediatric patients, aged 1-9 yr, were randomly allocated to
      the Control or Clonidine 4 microg/kg group (n = 5 each). Anesthesia was induced
      and maintained with sevoflurane in oxygen and air (FIO2 40%). Epidural puncture
      and tubing were carefully performed at the Th11-12 intervertebral space. An
      initial dose of 1% lidocaine (5 mg/kg) was injected through a catheter into the
      epidural space, followed by 2.5 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1). Plasma concentrations of
      lidocaine and MEGX were measured at 15 min, 30 min, and every 60 min for 4 h
      after the initiation of continuous epidural injection. The concentrations of
      lidocaine and MEGX were measured using high-pressure liquid chromatography with
      ultraviolet detection. Hemodynamic variables were similar between members of the 
      Control and Clonidine groups during anesthesia. The Clonidine group showed
      significantly smaller lidocaine concentrations (p < 0.05) and the concentration
      of MEGX tended to be smaller in the plasma of the Clonidine group for the initial
      4 h after the initiation of epidural infusion. In conclusion, oral clonidine
      preanesthetic medication at a dose of 4 microg/kg decreases plasma lidocaine
      concentration in children. IMPLICATIONS: Oral clonidine decreases the plasma
      lidocaine concentration in children. Our finding may have clinical implications
      in patients receiving continuous epidural anesthesia. Additionally, perhaps an
      additional margin of safety regarding lidocaine toxicity is gained through the
      use of oral clonidine in children who will receive epidural lidocaine.

TI  - The effects of olanzapine on neurocognitive functioning in medication-refractory 
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 239-50
AB  - Neurocognitive deficits are an enduring characteristic of schizophrenia, and
      remain prominent in patients whose positive symptoms have decreased after
      treatment with typical neuroleptics. Recent research has reported that olanzapine
      improves cognitive functioning in relapsing schizophrenia followed in an
      outpatient setting. Whether olanzapine will have an effect on improving cognitive
      function in chronic schizophrenics who have been hospitalized for long periods of
      time, and have shown a poor response to other conventional and atypical
      neuroleptics, has not been established. This study investigated cognitive
      function in chronic medication refractory schizophrenics who were treated with
      olanzapine or haloperidol in a double-blind study for 8 wk, and followed in an
      open olanzapine study for several additional months. Patients were evaluated with
      psychopathology rating scales and a battery of neuropsychological tests at
      baseline, end of double-blind and end of open-label phases of the study. At the
      end of the double-blind phase there were no significant differences between
      olanzapine and haloperidol, except for a trend for improvement on the Wisconsin
      Card Sort Test on olanzapine, which was significant at traditional but not
      corrected significance levels. After an additional 3 months of treatment with
      olanzapine doses of 20-40 mg/d, our statistical analysis showed significant
      improvement on overall neuropsychological test performance and specific cognitive
      tasks assessing verbal memory. However, these open-label results are difficult to
      interpret definitively because of the lack of a comparison drug group and the
      olanzapine dose escalation over time. Neurocognitive changes were not correlated 
      with changes in psychopathology as assessed by PANSS or SANS scores.

TI  - The influence of stimulants, sedatives, and fatigue on tunnel vision: risk
      factors for driving and piloting.
PG  - 310-27
AB  - A computerized task was used in two studies to examine the influence of
      stimulants, sedatives, and fatigue on single-target and divided-attention
      responses in different parts of the visual field. The drug effects were evaluated
      over time with repeated behavioral and subjective measures against ascending and 
      descending drug levels. In the first study, 18 fully rested participants received
      placebo, alprazolam (0.5 mg), and dextroamphetamine (10 mg). Alprazolam impairs
      performance, whereas dextroamphetamine induces enhancement and tunnel vision.
      Study 2 exposed 32 participants to fatigue and no fatigue with a
      repeated-measures crossover design. Four independent groups subsequently received
      placebo, dextroamphetamine (10 mg), caffeine (250 mg), or alcohol (.07%). Under
      fatigue, stimulants have no performance-enhancing effects, whereas impairment
      from alcohol is severe. Under no fatigue, alcohol has a modest effect, caffeine
      has no effect, and dextroamphetamine significantly enhances divided-attention
      performance coincident with tunnel vision. Participants rate all drug effects
      more stimulating and less sedating while fatigued. Implications for
      transportation safety are discussed. Actual or potential applications of this
      research include driver and pilot training.

TI  - Use of the Medication Event Monitoring System to estimate medication compliance
      in patients with schizophrenia.
PG  - 325-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility of using the Medication Event Monitoring 
      System (MEMS) to estimate medication compliance in patients with schizophrenia or
      schizoaffective disorder. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: Fourteen of 35 consecutive
      patients admitted to a psychiatric inpatient hospital with schizophrenia or
      schizoaffective disorder who met eligibility requirements and gave informed
      consent. INTERVENTION: After random assignment to either risperidone or typical
      antipsychotic treatment, medication upon discharge from hospital was dispensed in
      a bottle with a MEMS cap which recorded the number of bottle openings and the
      date and time of each opening. The first 6 patients were asked to return monthly 
      for data downloading. The next 8 were asked to return weekly during the first
      month and every 2 weeks thereafter; they were also paid $5 for returning each
      bottle. OUTCOME MEASURES: MEMS data collected over a 6-month period and hospital 
      readmission data. RESULTS: Patient medication compliance data were collected from
      10 (71%) of 14 patients during the first month, from 7 (58%) of 12 (2 patients
      dropped out) during the second and from 5 (45%) of 11 (a third patient dropped
      out) during months 3-6. Mean compliance rates were 63% for the first month and
      ranged from 56% to 45% over the next 5. First-month compliance rates were
      significantly lower for those who were subsequently readmitted to hospital (n =
      7) than for those who were not (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Electronic monitoring
      devices can be used to estimate compliance with medication regimens in patients
      with severe schizophrenic disorders, but there are methodological improvements
      that can be made to increase data recovery and compliance, and these are
      discussed.

TI  - The Conners' Parent Rating Scales: a critical review of the literature.
PG  - 1061-93
AB  - The Conners' Parent Rating Scales (CPRS) have undergone a considerable amount of 
      scrutiny--and subsequent refining, reshaping, and revising--since their
      development in 1970. While such longitudinal scrutiny has ultimately led to a
      more reliable, valid assessment tool, it has left behind a wake of literature
      filled with misinformation and ambiguity. Multiple versions of the Conners'
      Rating Scales (CRS), their misuse, and inaccurate reporting by researchers have
      created a body of literature that is difficult to interpret and misleading to
      both researchers and clinicians. This review is aimed at clarifying issues
      regarding the proper use of the CPRS as both a diagnostic instrument and a
      research tool.

TI  - Randomized, controlled trial of oros methylphenidate once a day in children with 
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - 883-92
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A new once-a-day methylphenidate (MPH) formulation, Concerta
      (methylphenidate HCl) extended-release tablets (OROS MPH), has been developed.
      This study was conducted to determine the safety and efficacy of OROS MPH in a
      multicenter, randomized, clinical trial. METHODS: Children with
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; n = 282), all subtypes, ages 6 to
      12 years, were randomized to placebo (n = 90), immediate-release methylphenidate 
      (IR MPH) 3 times a day (tid; dosed every 4 hours; n = 97), or OROS MPH once a day
      (qd; n = 95) in a double-blind, 28-day trial. Outcomes in multiple domains were
      assessed, and data were analyzed using analysis of variance and Kaplan Meier
      product limit estimates for time to study cessation. The primary time point for
      analysis was the last available patient visit using last observation carried
      forward. RESULTS: Children in the OROS and IR MPH groups showed significantly
      greater reductions in core ADHD symptoms than did children on placebo. This was
      true both at the end of week 1 and at the end of treatment on the basis of mean
      teacher and parent IOWA Conners ratings. IR MPH tid and OROS MPH qd did not
      differ significantly on any direct comparisons. Forty-eight percent of the
      placebo group discontinued early compared with 14% and 16% in the IR MPH and OROS
      MPH groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: For the treatment of core ADHD symptoms,
      OROS MPH dosed qd and IR MPH dosed tid were superior to placebo and were not
      significantly different from each other.attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder,

TI  - Association of olanzapine-induced weight gain with an increase in body fat.
PG  - 1719-22
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to explore the pathophysiology of weight
      gain during treatment with olanzapine for schizophrenia. METHOD: The authors used
      a prospective, controlled, open study comparing body weight, body mass index, and
      related biological measures in mentally and physically healthy volunteers and
      olanzapine-treated patients with schizophrenia. Weight, eating behavior, leptin
      serum levels, body mass index, and body composition were assessed over an 8-week 
      observation period. RESULTS: A significant increase in body weight, leptin serum 
      levels, and percentage of body fat was seen in patients treated with olanzapine, 
      but the drug-free comparison group did not show any significant changes. The
      weight gain during antipsychotic treatment with olanzapine was mainly
      attributable to an increase in body fat; patients' lean body mass did not change.
      CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the original finding that an increase in body fat is 
      mainly responsible for olanzapine-induced weight gain, these findings confirm
      results obtained in other studies showing increases in body weight and serum
      leptin levels during treatment with second-generation antipsychotics.

TI  - Bupropion SR in the naturalistic treatment of elderly patients with major
      depression.
PG  - 862-5
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bupropion immediate release (IR) and bupropion sustained release
      (SR) are frequently used to treat geriatric depression, as they have few
      cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and sexual adverse effects. We sought to examine
      the efficacy and dosing patterns of bupropion in a naturalistic cohort of elderly
      subjects with major depression (MD). METHODS: 31 elderly ( > 60 years) patients
      with unipolar MD (DSM-IV) who were enrolled in Duke's Mental Health Clinical
      Research Center for the Study of Depression in Later Life were prescribed
      bupropion SR or IR, alone or in combination with other antidepressant agents, for
      12 weeks. Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale (MADRS) scores and clinical
      global impression (CGI) severity scores were used to define response. RESULTS:
      74% (23/31) of the sample were responders (MADRS < 15) and 53% (16/30) achieved a
      partial (CGI = 2) or complete (CGI = 1) remission of MD at week 12. Among
      patients treated with bupropion SR monotherapy, the mean (range) maximal daily
      dose achieved was 240 mg (150-400 mg). Among those treated with bupropion IR, the
      mean (range) maximum daily dose achieved was 258 mg (150-450 mg). In subjects on 
      monotherapy, 67% (10/15) of MD subjects were responders (MADRS < 15) and 50%
      (7/14) achieved full or partial remission. Response rates did not differ
      statistically among those with high and low medical comorbidity. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      this naturalistic 12-week study, geriatric MD patients with high and low medical 
      comorbidity responded well to bupropion and bupropion SR. In elderly patients,
      four to eight week acute treatment periods may be insufficient. Our findings
      suggest that nearly 50% of elderly depressed subjects at a tertiary center may
      need combination therapy over the course of their illness. Controlled randomized 
      studies to establish the long-term efficacy and optimal dose of the newer
      antidepressants in geriatric depression are urgently needed.

TI  - Effect of levodopa in combination with physiotherapy on functional motor recovery
      after stroke: a prospective, randomised, double-blind study.
PG  - 787-90
AB  - BACKGROUND: Functional disability is generally caused by hemiplegia after stroke.
      Physiotherapy used to be the only way of improving motor function in such
      patients. However, administration of amphetamines in addition to exercise
      improves motor recovery in animals, probably by increasing the concentration of
      norepinephrine in the central nervous system. Our aim was to ascertain whether
      levodopa could enhance the efficacy of physiotherapy after hemiplegia. METHODS:
      We did a prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind study in which
      we enrolled 53 primary stroke patients. For the first 3 weeks patients received
      single doses of levodopa 100 mg or placebo daily in combination with
      physiotherapy. For the second 3 weeks patients had only physiotherapy. We
      quantitatively assessed motor function every week with Rivermead motor assessment
      (RMA). FINDINGS: Six patients were excluded from analyses because of
      non-neurological complications. Motor recovery was significantly improved after 3
      weeks of drug intervention in those on levodopa (RMA improved by 6.4 points)
      compared with placebo (4.1), and the result was independent of initial degree of 
      impairment (p<0.004). The advantage of the levodopa group was maintained at study
      endpoint 3 weeks after levodopa was stopped. At the end of the study the total
      RMA score gain for the levodopa group was 8.2 points compared with 5.7 in the
      placebo group (p=0.020). INTERPRETATION: A single dose of levodopa is well
      tolerated and, when given in combination with physiotherapy, enhances motor
      recovery in patients with hemiplegia. In view of its minimal side-effects,
      levodopa will be a possible add- on during stroke rehabilitation.

TI  - Sustained-release bupropion for pharmacologic relapse prevention after smoking
      cessation. a randomized, controlled trial.
PG  - 423-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: Smoking relapse is common after successful pharmacologic treatment
      for smoking cessation. No previous studies have examined long-term drug therapy
      used expressly for prevention of smoking relapse. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the
      efficacy of bupropion to prevent smoking relapse. DESIGN: Randomized,
      placebo-controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: 784 healthy community volunteers who were
      motivated to quit smoking and who smoked at least 15 cigarettes per day.
      INTERVENTION: The participants received open-label, sustained-release bupropion, 
      300 mg/d, for 7 weeks. Participants who were abstinent throughout week 7 of
      open-label treatment were randomly assigned to receive bupropion, 300 mg/d, or
      placebo for 45 weeks and were subsequently followed for an additional year after 
      the conclusion of the medication phase. Participants were briefly counseled at
      all follow-up visits. At the end of open-label bupropion treatment, 461 of 784
      participants (58.8%) were abstinent from smoking. MEASUREMENT: Self-reported
      abstinence was confirmed by an expired air carbon monoxide concentration of 10
      parts per million or less. RESULTS: The point prevalence of smoking abstinence
      was significantly higher in the bupropion group than in the placebo group at the 
      end (week 52) of drug therapy (55.1% vs. 42.3%, respectively; P = 0.008) and at
      week 78 (47.7% vs. 37.7%; P = 0.034) but did not differ at the final (week 104)
      follow-up visit (41.6% vs. 40.0%). The median time to relapse was significantly
      greater for bupropion recipients than for placebo recipients (156 days vs. 65
      days; P = 0.021). The continuous abstinence rate was higher in the bupropion
      group than in the placebo group at study week 24 (17 weeks after randomization)
      (52.3% vs. 42.3%; P = 0.037) but did not differ between groups after week 24.
      Weight gain was significantly less in the bupropion group than in the placebo
      group at study weeks 52 (3.8 kg vs. 5.6 kg; P = 0.002) and 104 (4.1 kg vs. 5.4
      kg; P = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: In persons who stopped smoking with 7 weeks of
      bupropion treatment, sustained-release bupropion for 12 months delayed smoking
      relapse and resulted in less weight gain.

TI  - Bupropion for weight loss: an investigation of efficacy and tolerability in
      overweight and obese women.
PG  - 544-51
AB  - OBJECTIVE: On the basis of the clinical observations that bupropion facilitated
      weight loss, we investigated the efficacy and tolerability of this drug in
      overweight and obese adult women. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: A total of 50 
      overweight and obese (body mass index: 28.0 to 52.6 kg/m(2)) women were included.
      The core component of the study was a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled comparison for 8 weeks. Bupropion or placebo was started at
      100 mg/d with gradual dose increase to a maximum of 200 mg twice daily. All
      subjects were prescribed a 1600 kcal/d balanced diet and compliance was monitored
      with food diaries. Responders continued the same treatment in a double-blind
      manner for an additional 16 weeks to a total of 24 weeks. There was additional
      single-blind follow-up treatment for a total of 2 years. RESULTS: Subjects
      receiving bupropion achieved greater mean weight loss
      (last-observation-carried-forward analysis) over the first 8 weeks of the study
      (p = 0.0001): 4.9% +/- 3.4% (n = 25) for bupropion treatment compared with 1.3%
      +/- 2.4% (n = 25) for placebo treatment. For those who completed the 8 weeks, the
      comparison was 6.2% +/- 3.1% (n = 18) vs. 1.6% +/- 2.9% (n = 13), respectively(p 
      = 0.0002), with 12 of 18 of the bupropion subjects (67%) losing over 5% of
      baseline body weight compared with 2 of 13 in the placebo group (15%; p =
      0.0094). In the continuation phase, 14 bupropion responders who completed 24
      weeks achieved weight loss of 12.9% +/- 5.6% with fat accounting for 73.5% +/-
      3.7% of the weight lost and no change in bone mineral density as assessed by DXA.
      Bupropion was generally well-tolerated in this sample. DISCUSSION: Bupropion was 
      more effective than placebo in achieving weight loss at 8 weeks in overweight and
      obese adult women in this preliminary study. Initial responders to bupropion
      benefited further in the continuation phase.

TI  - Treatment of the symptoms of schizophrenia: a combined analysis of double-blind
      studies comparing risperidone with haloperidol and other antipsychotic agents.
PG  - 265-74
AB  - Combined data on efficacy were available from 12 double-blind short-term (maximum
      8 weeks) trials comparing risperidone and other antipsychotics in patients with
      chronic schizophrenia. Patients received risperidone (n = 1056) or other
      antipsychotics (n = 703). Haloperidol (n = 473) was the most frequently
      prescribed other antipsychotic. Efficacy assessments include the Positive and
      Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total, subscale (positive symptoms, negative
      symptoms and general psychopathology), cluster (cognitive and affective symptoms)
      and item (anxiety and hostility) scores. At endpoint, the mean decrease from
      baseline in PANSS total scores was significantly greater for patients receiving
      risperidone (-20.9) than other antipsychotics (-16.2; P < 0.001), or the subset
      receiving haloperidol (-14.3; P < 0.001). Risperidone-treated patients showed a
      significantly greater decrease in the positive (P < 0.01), negative (P < 0.05)
      and general psychopathology (P < 0.001) scores than patients receiving other
      antipsychotics or haloperidol. Scores for cognition, affective symptoms, anxiety 
      and hostility each improved significantly (P < 0.05) more for patients receiving 
      risperidone than those receiving other antipsychotics or haloperidol. Efficacy
      data on patients with an acute exacerbation were available from seven trials
      (risperidone n = 372, other antipsychotics n = 285, including haloperidol n =
      120). At endpoint, the mean decrease from baseline in PANSS total scores was
      significantly greater for patients receiving risperidone (-24.7) than other
      antipsychotics (-19.8, P < 0.01) including haloperidol (-19.8, P < 0.05).
      Risperidone-treated patients also showed a greater decrease in positive symptom
      scores (-7.8) than those receiving other antipsychotics (-6.3; P < 0.01) or
      haloperidol (-7.1). A > or = 20% reduction in PANSS total score with risperidone,
      haloperidol and other antipsychotics was achieved by 65.9%, 54.3% and 54.9%,
      respectively; a > or = 30% PANSS reduction by 54.0%, 46.6% and 46.5% of patients,
      respectively; and a > or = 40% reduction by 43.8%, 33.7% and 34.4% of patients,
      respectively. These findings are consistent with earlier findings that show
      risperidone is more efficacious than haloperidol for reducing the symptoms of
      schizophrenia.

TI  - Antipsychotic-induced extrapyramidal syndromes. Risperidone compared with low-
      and high-potency conventional antipsychotic drugs.
PG  - 327-31
AB  - AIM: To compare the risk of extrapyramidal syndromes (EPS) between patients using
      risperidone and those using low-potency conventional antipsychotic drugs (APDs)
      in outpatient clinical practice, as measured by the use of anticholinergic
      medication. We tried to replicate results from previous clinical trials that
      compared risperidone with high-potency APDs. METHOD: Data was obtained from the
      PHARMO database containing filled prescriptions of 450,000 community-dwelling
      people in The Netherlands from 1986 to 1998. From the patients aged 15-54 years
      who had been newly treated with APDs, we defined mutually exclusive cohorts
      according to the APD first prescribed to a patient. APD exposure was followed
      until the first prescription of anticholinergic medication and was censored when 
      APD prescribing was interrupted or switched. We estimated relative risks between 
      risperidone and commonly used low-potency and high-potency APDs using Cox
      proportional hazards models, adjusting for age, gender, dose and other potential 
      confounders. RESULTS: In 4094 patients who had been newly prescribed
      antipsychotic drugs, the overall incidence rate of anticholinergic drug therapy
      was 556 per 1000 person-years, which was dose dependent. Prescribed doses of all 
      antipsychotics were low. While, in accordance with previous trials, risperidone
      showed a lower risk of EPS than the high potency APDs such as haloperidol (RR
      0.26; 95% CI 0.10-0.64), we did not observe a lower EPS rate than low-potency
      APDs (risperidone vs thioridazine RR 1.73, 95% CI 0.49-6.13; risperidone vs
      pipamperone RR 2.50, 95% CI 0.78-8.04). CONCLUSION: The reduced EPS rates
      observed when comparing risperidone with high-potency antipsychotics such as
      haloperidol may not apply to comparisons with low-potency drugs.

TI  - Urapidil does not prevent postanesthetic shivering: a dose-ranging study.
PG  - 742-7
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of 0.2 mg x kg(-1), 0.3 mg x kg(-1) and 0.4 mg
      x kg(-1) urapidil on the incidence and severity of postanesthetic shivering.
      METHODS: One hundred and fifty patients (ASA I-III) scheduled for elective
      abdominal, urologic or orthopedic surgery under standardized general anesthesia
      were randomly allocated to one of five groups (each group n=30) using a
      double-blind protocol: group A received 0.2 mg x kg(-1) urapidil, group B: 0.3 mg
      x kg(-1) urapidil, group C: 0.4 mg x kg(-1) urapidil, group D: 3 microg x kg(-1) 
      clonidine (positive control group), and group E: saline 0.9% as placebo (negative
      control group). Postanesthetic shivering was scored using a five-point scale.
      RESULTS: Twelve patients of group A, 11 of group B, nine of group C, three of
      group D and 14 of group E showed signs of postanesthetic shivering.
      Postanesthetic shivering was significantly decreased in the clonidine group
      compared to the three urapidil groups and the placebo group. Significantly less
      patients treated with clonidine needed anti-shivering therapy. There were no
      significant differences between the urapidil and placebo groups. Therapeutic
      interventions for hemodynamic effects were not required in any group. Time to
      extubation, but not time to discharge, was prolonged in the clonidine group.
      CONCLUSION: Urapidil showed no beneficial effect on shivering in any of the doses
      evaluated, whereas prophylactic administration of clonidine was effective in
      preventing postanesthetic shivering.

TI  - Methylphenidate (OROS formulation).
PG  - 495-500; discussion 501-3
AB  - Methylphenidate is a CNS stimulant that is thought to block the reuptake of
      dopamine and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) into the presynaptic neuron. A
      sustained release (OROS formulation of the drug has been developed for use in
      children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In children aged 6
      to 12 years with ADHD, the maximum plasma concentration of OROS methylphenidate
      18 to 54 mg was reached after approximately 7 to 8 hours. In adults, the plasma
      concentration-time profile of OROS methylphenidate differed markedly from that of
      the sustained release and immediate release (IR) methylphenidate formulations. In
      a clinical trial involving 282 children with ADHD, once daily OROS
      methylphenidate 18 to 54 mg was significantly more effective than placebo and
      demonstrated an effect similar to IR methylphenidate 5 to 15 mg 3 times daily in 
      reducing the symptoms of ADHD. OROS methylphenidate demonstrated sustained
      efficacy in a 1-year noncomparative study involving children with ADHD. In
      clinical trials, the OROS formulation of methylphenidate had a tolerability
      profile similar to that of IR methylphenidate.

TI  - A placebo-controlled comparison of the effects on sexual functioning of bupropion
      sustained release and fluoxetine.
PG  - 1040-58
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many antidepressants are associated with sexual dysfunction, a side
      effect that may lead to patients' dissatisfaction and noncompliance with
      treatment. OBJECTIVE: This study compared the efficacy, tolerability, and effects
      on sexual functioning of bupropion sustained release (bupropion SR) and the
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine. METHODS: In this multicenter, 
      randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study, patients with
      recurrent major depression were treated with bupropion SR 150 to 400 mg/d,
      fluoxetine 20 to 60 mg/d, or placebo for up to 8 weeks. Depression and
      sexual-functioning status were assessed by site-specific trained investigators at
      weekly clinic visits; tolerability was assessed primarily by monitoring adverse
      events. RESULTS: Four hundred fifty-six patients participated in the study, 150
      receiving bupropion SR, 154 fluoxetine, and 152 placebo. The majority of patients
      in each group completed the study (63% each, bupropion SR [n = 94] and fluoxetine
      [n = 97]; 67%, placebo [n = 102]). Bupropion SR and fluoxetine were similarly
      effective in the treatment of depressive symptoms. Beginning at week 2 and
      continuing throughout the study, significantly more fluoxetine-treated patients
      experienced orgasm dysfunction than did patients receiving bupropion SR or
      placebo (P < 0.001); similar results were seen in patients defined as clinical
      responders (> or =50% decrease from baseline in 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for
      Depression [HAM-D] total score) (P < 0.001) and in those experiencing remission
      of depression (HAM-D total score <8) (P < 0.05). At various time points, worsened
      sexual functioning, sexual desire disorder, sexual arousal disorder, and
      dissatisfaction with sexual functioning in those satistied at baseline were more 
      frequently associated with fluoxetine treatment than with bupropion SR or
      placebo. Both active treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Bupropion SR
      and fluoxetine were similarly effective and well tolerated in the treatment of
      depression. Fluoxetine, however, was more frequently associated with sexual
      dysfunction compared with bupropion SR. Bupropion SR may be an appropriate
      initial choice for the treatment of depression in patients concerned about sexual
      functioning.

TI  - [Therapies for smoking cessation (antidepressants, nicotine-replacement and
      counseling) and implications for the treatment of patients with chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease].
PG  - 1492-6
AB  - Only a small percentage of smokers who state they want to stop smoking in the
      next half year, succeed in doing so. This is not only due to the addictive nature
      of smoking cigarettes, but also because of psychological and social factors.
      Approximately 80% of the people who have used nicotine-replacement therapy return
      to smoking after some time. Therefore, the interest in non-nicotine
      pharmacotherapy has increased considerably in recent years. The antidepressants
      bupropion and nortriptyline are, compared to a placebo, particularly effective
      smoking cessation aids (relative risk (RR)nortriptyline: 2.7; 95% CI: 1.3-5.3;
      RRbupropion: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.1-2.6). A combined strategy of nicotine-replacement
      therapy with counselling or antidepressants (bupropion or nortriptyline) with
      counselling, in which the physiological as well as the psychological aspects of
      smoking cessation are treated, seems to be the most effective. Although smoking
      cessation is seen as the single most important way of preventing a further
      deterioration of the lung function at all stages of chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease (COPD), little research has been conducted amongst COPD patients.
      Especially the use of the antidepressants bupropion or nortriptyline seems
      particularly interesting for the treatment of patients with COPD. This is not
      only because smoking cigarettes is the major risk factor for the development of
      the disease, but also because COPD patients have a higher than normal prevalence 
      of depression. Furthermore, an association has been found between smoking
      cigarettes and depression, and the presence of depression or depressive symptoms 
      appears to be an important cause of relapse.

TI  - Steady-state pharmacokinetics and tolerability of modafinil given alone or in
      combination with methylphenidate in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 895-904
AB  - The potential for a pharmacokinetic (PK) drug-drug interaction between modafinil 
      and methylphenidate, each at steady state, was investigated in an open-label,
      randomized, single-period study in 32 healthy male and female volunteers. All
      subjects received modafinil once daily orally for 28 days (200 mg on Days 1-7 and
      400 mg on Days 8-28). On Days 22 to 28, half of the subjects also received 20 mg 
      of methylphenidate orally 8 hours after their modafinil dose. PK profiles of
      modafinil were obtained on Days 21 and 28 and compared between the two groups.
      There were no statistically significant differences between the treatment groups 
      in the mean changes in PK parameters for modafinil. Parameters for its
      metabolites were also similar between the groups, and all treatments were well
      tolerated. The results indicate that administration of low-dose methylphenidate 8
      hours after treatment with modafinil does not appear to alter the steady-state
      pharmacokinetics of modafinil in healthy volunteers.

TI  - A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of docosahexaenoic acid
      supplementation in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - 189-96
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation for 4 
      months decreases the symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
      STUDY DESIGN: Sixty-three 6- to-12-year-old children with ADHD, all receiving
      effective maintenance therapy with stimulant medication, were assigned randomly, 
      in a double-blind fashion, to receive DHA supplementation (345 mg/d) or placebo
      for 4 months. Outcome variables included plasma phospholipid fatty acid patterns,
      scores on laboratory measures of inattention and impulsivity (Test of Variables
      of Attention, Children's Color Trails test) while not taking stimulant
      medication, and scores on parental behavioral rating scales (Child Behavior
      Checklist, Conners' Rating Scale). Differences between groups after 4 months of
      DHA supplementation or placebo administration were determined by analysis of
      variance, controlling for age, baseline value of each outcome variable,
      ethnicity, and ADHD subtype. RESULTS: Plasma phospholipid DHA content of the
      DHA-supplemented group was 2.6-fold higher at the end of the study than that of
      the placebo group (4.85 +/- 1.35 vs 1.86 +/- 0.87 mol % of total fatty acids; P
      <.001). Despite this, there was no statistically significant improvement in any
      objective or subjective measure of ADHD symptoms. CONCLUSION: A 4-month period of
      DHA supplementation (345 mg/d) does not decrease symptoms of ADHD.

TI  - A double-blind comparative study of clozapine and risperidone in the management
      of severe chronic schizophrenia.
PG  - 1305-13
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This prospective, double-blind, multicenter, parallel-group study
      compared the efficacy and safety of therapeutic doses of clozapine and
      risperidone in patients with severe chronic schizophrenia and poor previous
      treatment response. METHOD: Male or female patients aged 18-65 years who met
      DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia and study requirements for poor previous
      treatment response (N=273) were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with 
      either clozapine or risperidone administered over 12 weeks in increasing
      increments. The primary efficacy measures were the magnitude of improvement in
      Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and Clinical Global Impression (CGI)
      scores. Adverse events were recorded throughout the study. RESULTS: The magnitude
      of improvement in mean BPRS and CGI scores from baseline to end of the study was 
      significantly greater in the clozapine group than in the risperidone group.
      Statistically significant differences in favor of clozapine were also seen for
      most of the secondary efficacy measures (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale,
      Calgary Depression Scale, Psychotic Depression Scale, and Psychotic Anxiety
      Scale). The adverse event profile was similar for both treatment groups, with a
      lower risk of extrapyramidal symptoms in the clozapine group. CONCLUSIONS:
      Clozapine showed superior efficacy over risperidone in this patient population.
      Both treatments were equally well tolerated as demonstrated through their adverse
      event profiles, although as expected clozapine was associated with a lower risk
      of extrapyramidal symptoms than risperidone.

TI  - An evaluation of risperidone drug interactions.
PG  - 408-16
AB  - Risperidone, an atypical antipsychotic drug, is widely used in the treatment of
      psychoses associated with schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and other
      psychiatric disorders. Polypharmacology is a necessary condition for the optimal 
      treatment of many patients with comorbid psychiatric and medical illness. One
      concern raised by the widespread use of multiple concurrent pharmacotherapies is 
      the potential for drug-drug interactions to adversely affect patient outcome.
      Accordingly, the biomedical literature was reviewed for reports of drug
      interactions involving risperidone, and the clinical significance of each report 
      was evaluated. Additionally, the potential for risperidone to participate in drug
      interactions was evaluated by considering the drug's pharmacokinetic properties. 
      Controlled studies and case reports indicate that risperidone has a low potential
      for metabolic drug interactions. Drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 or 
      induce or inhibit CYP3A4 may alter risperidone plasma concentrations, but the
      clinical significance of such interactions seems to be minimal. Adherence to a
      few guidelines for the design of dosage regimens should limit the effect of
      drug-drug interactions on patient status and contribute to optimal
      pharmacotherapy with risperidone.

TI  - A double-blind, randomized comparison of the efficacy and safety of intramuscular
      injections of olanzapine, lorazepam, or placebo in treating acutely agitated
      patients diagnosed with bipolar mania.
PG  - 389-97
AB  - There are no rapid-acting intramuscular formulations of atypical antipsychotics
      available for quickly calming an agitated patient with bipolar disorder. In this 
      study, 201 agitated patients with bipolar mania were randomly assigned to receive
      one to three injections of the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine (10 mg, first
      two injections; 5 mg, third injection), the benzodiazepine lorazepam (2 mg, first
      two injections; 1 mg, third injection), or placebo (placebo, first two
      injections; olanzapine, 10 mg, third injection) within a 24-hour period.
      Agitation was measured at baseline, every 30 minutes for the first 2 hours, and
      at 24 hours after the first injection using the Positive and Negative Syndrome
      Scale-Excited Component subscale and two additional agitation scales. At 2 hours 
      after the first injection, patients treated with olanzapine showed a
      significantly greater reduction in scores on all agitation scales compared with
      patients treated with either placebo or lorazepam. At 24 hours after the first
      injection, olanzapine remained statistically superior to placebo in reducing
      agitation in patients with acute mania, whereas patients treated with lorazepam
      were not significantly different from those treated with placebo or olanzapine.
      Furthermore, no significant differences among the three treatment groups were
      observed in safety measures, including treatment-emergent extrapyramidal
      symptoms, the incidence of acute dystonia, or QTc interval changes. These
      findings suggest that intramuscular olanzapine is a safe and effective treatment 
      for reducing acute agitation in patients with bipolar mania.

TI  - A double-blind, randomized, prospective evaluation of the efficacy and safety of 
      risperidone versus haloperidol in the treatment of schizoaffective disorder.
PG  - 360-8
AB  - The relative efficacy and safety of risperidone versus haloperidol in the
      treatment of schizoaffective disorder was studied. Sixty-two patients (29
      depressed type; 33 bipolar type) entered a three-site, randomized, double-blind, 
      6-week trial of risperidone (up to 10 mg/day) or haloperidol (up to 20 mg/day).
      Trained raters assessed baseline, weekly, and end-of-study levels of
      psychopathology with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the
      24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-24) and the
      Clinician-Administered Rating Scale for Mania (CARS-M). The authors were unable
      to statistically distinguish between risperidone and haloperidol in the
      amelioration of psychotic and manic symptoms. In addition, there was no
      difference in worsening of mania between the two agents in either subgroup (i.e.,
      depressed or bipolar subgroups). For the total PANSS, risperidone produced a mean
      decrease of 16 points from baseline compared with a 14-point decrease with
      haloperidol. For the total CARS-M scale, risperidone and haloperidol produced
      mean change scores of 5 and 8 points, respectively, and for the CARS-M Mania
      subscale, 3 and 7 points, respectively. Additionally, risperidone produced a mean
      decrease of 13 points from the baseline 24-item HAM-D, compared with an 8-point
      decrease with haloperidol. In those patients who had more severe depressive
      symptoms (i.e., HAM-D baseline score >20), risperidone produced at least a 50%
      mean improvement in 12 (75%) of 16 patients in comparison to 8 (38%) of 21
      patients receiving haloperidol. Haloperidol produced significantly more
      extrapyramidal side effects and resulted in more dropouts caused by any side
      effect. There was no difference between risperidone and haloperidol in reducing
      both psychotic and manic symptoms in this group of patients with schizoaffective 
      disorder. Risperidone did not demonstrate a propensity to precipitate mania and
      was better tolerated than haloperidol. In those subjects with higher baseline
      HAM-D scores (i.e., >20), risperidone produced a greater improvement in
      depressive symptoms than haloperidol.

TI  - Randomized placebo controlled trial of lofexidine hydrochloride for chronic
      pelvic pain in women.
PG  - 1719-21
AB  - BACKGROUND: We hypothesised that the orally-active alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist 
      lofexidine hydrochloride would ameliorate chronic pelvic pain in women. METHODS: 
      A randomized placebo-controlled parallel group trial was undertaken in the
      University Hospital Gynaecology Clinic. Women with pelvic pain of at least 6
      months duration were eligible, and were randomized using a sealed envelope system
      to receive up to 600 mg lofexidine hydrochloride twice daily over 8 weeks or
      placebo. Outcome measures were summary and daily diary visual analog scales for
      pain (VAS) and a 5 point self rating scale. RESULTS: 9/19 women randomized to
      lofexidine completed the study compared to 14/20 of those randomized to placebo. 
      Intention-to-treat analysis showed that 4/19 in the lofexidine group achieved 50%
      or greater reduction in VAS compared with 8/20 in the placebo group (OR 2.5, 95% 
      CI 0.6--10.3). Summary and diary VAS were closely correlated. CONCLUSIONS: Within
      the limits of a small study with power to detect only a substantial effect, we
      conclude that lofexidine hydrochloride is not effective for the treatment of
      chronic pelvic pain.

TI  - Clonidine prevents sevoflurane-induced agitation in children.
PG  - 335-8, 2nd contents page
AB  - In a double-blinded trial, 40 male children (age 2-7 yr) undergoing circumcision 
      were randomly assigned to receive clonidine 2 microg/kg IV or placebo after
      anesthetic induction. For induction and maintenance of anesthesia, we used
      sevoflurane as the sole anesthetic. For pain treatment, a penile block was
      performed before surgery. After surgery the incidence and severity of agitation
      was measured during an observation period of 2 h. Severe agitation was treated
      with midazolam. In 16 placebo and 2 clonidine-treated patients agitation was
      observed (P < 0.001). In 6 patients of the Placebo group, agitation was graded as
      severe, whereas none of the patients in the Clonidine group developed severe
      agitation (P = 0.02). During the postoperative period heart rate and blood
      pressure were significantly decreased in clonidine treated patients (P < 0.05).
      We conclude that clonidine effectively prevents agitation after sevoflurane
      anesthesia. IMPLICATIONS: The recovery from sevoflurane anesthesia may be
      complicated by the presence of agitation in pediatric patients. Clonidine 2
      microg/kg IV after anesthetic induction effectively reduces the incidence of
      agitation without resulting in clinically relevant bradycardia and hypotension.

TI  - Olanzapine in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder: a pilot study.
PG  - 197-203
AB  - Because the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine may be efficacious in treating
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, we conducted a 10-week,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation in which 15 patients were randomized 
      2:1 to either olanzapine or placebo. The initial dosage was 5 mg/day and was
      titrated to a maximum of 20 mg/day. Eleven patients completed the study. Patients
      in both groups showed improvement in PTSD symptoms, but no between-group
      differences in treatment response were observed and a high placebo response rate 
      was found. Both treatments were tolerated well, although the olanzapine treatment
      group had more weight gain. Olanzapine fared no better than placebo in this
      preliminary study in the treatment of PTSD. The lack of difference between
      olanzapine and placebo may in part be due to olanzapine's not being effective in 
      PTSD or, alternatively, a small sample size, a high placebo response in certain
      forms of PTSD and the chronicity of PTSD symptoms in some patients.

PG  - 259-67
AB  - A 12-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of oral clonidine
      in three fixed doses (4, 6, and 8 mcg/kg/day) using a crossover design was
      conducted with 10 children who had hyperkinetic disorder (mean age 7.6 years
      +/-.54). All had comorbid mental retardation. Both parents' ratings on the Parent
      Symptom Questionnaire and clinicians' ratings on the Hillside Behaviour Rating
      Scale showed a marked dose-related response to clonidine in hyperactivity,
      impulsivity, and inattention. Drowsiness was a common side effect of clonidine.
      It wore off by the 2nd to 4th week in most cases. Thus, clonidine is a safe and
      effective medication in young hyperkinetic children with comorbid mental
      retardation.

TI  - Comparative study of mortality rates and cardiac dysrhythmias in post-marketing
      surveillance studies of sertindole and two other atypical antipsychotic drugs,
      risperidone and olanzapine.
PG  - 120-6
AB  - Sertindole (Serdolect), an atypical antipsychotic, was voluntarily suspended in
      the European Union in 1998 following regulatory concerns over reports of serious 
      cardiac dysrhythmias and sudden unexpected deaths. The reported causes of death, 
      their frequency, prolongation of the rate corrected QT interval (QTc) and cardiac
      dysrhythmias in patients prescribed sertindole were compared with those for
      patients treated with two other atypical antipsychotics. All patients in England,
      prescribed atypical antipsychotics by general practitioners during each drug's
      immediate post-marketing period, were identified using an observational cohort
      technique, prescription-event monitoring. Mortality rates in the sertindole
      cohort were compared with those in a comparator cohort using standardized
      mortality ratios and incidence rate ratios. Cardiovascular events were reviewed
      and followed up to identify cases of prolongation of QTc interval. There was no
      statistically significant difference in mortality rates between sertindole and
      the comparator cohort, although confidence intervals (CI) were wide due to small 
      numbers in the sertindole cohort. A much smaller number of patients were
      prescribed sertindole than the other antipsychotics. Six cases of prolongation of
      QTc interval were identified in 462 patients (1.3%, 95% CI 0.5-2.8) treated with 
      sertindole and one with unspecified electrocardiogram changes in the comparator
      cohort of 16,542 patients. This study contributes to the understanding of the
      occurrence of prolongation of QTc interval during clinical use of sertindole, the
      incidence of which was similar to that in clinical trials. Although no
      statistically significant difference was shown in mortality rates between
      sertindole and comparator cohort, the sertindole cohort was too small to rule out
      an association between the use of this drug and cardiovascular deaths.

TI  - Meta-analysis comparing newer antipsychotic drugs for the treatment of
      schizophrenia: evaluating the indirect approach.
PG  - 942-56
AB  - BACKGROUND: Meta-analysis is a useful method to assess the efficacy of newer
      antipsychotic drugs compared with older drugs or placebo. However, few trials
      directly compare novel drugs to each other. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study 
      was to evaluate the method of indirect meta-analysis by applying it to data on
      olanzapine versus haloperidol and risperidone versus haloperidol to enable a
      comparison between olanzapine and risperidone. METHODS: Published randomized
      controlled trials (RCTs) of risperidone, olanzapine, and/or haloperidol were
      identified through literature searches (1983 to 1999) of the MEDLINE, Current
      Contents, and HealthSTAR databases and reviewed. Data for the Brief Psychiatric
      Rating Scale (BPRS) total score, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)
      negative subscale, the percentage of patients using anticholinergic drugs, and
      the percentage of patients dropping out due to lack of efficacy, side effects, or
      any cause were extracted and combined using the indirect method. These findings
      were compared with those from a direct comparative study of olanzapine and
      risperidone. RESULTS: The literature search yielded 8 RCTs comparing risperidone 
      to haloperidol and 3 comparing olanzapine to haloperidol. Only 1 trial directly
      comparing olanzapine and risperidone was found. In this trial, the change in BPRS
      total and PANSS negative subscale scores tended to be higher with olanzapine by
      1.80 and 1.10, respectively, but these differences were not statistically
      significant. Indirect meta-analysis yielded similar results. Changes in both BPRS
      total scores and PANSS negative subscale scores tended to be higher with
      olanzapine by 0.37 and 0.54, respectively, and again, the differences were not
      statistically significant. In the indirect meta-analysis, the rate of
      anticholinergic drug use was 19.5% greater among patients treated with
      risperidone than among patients treated with olanzapine (P < 0.05). In the direct
      comparative RCT, the rate was 13.1% higher among patients treated with
      risperidone (P < 0.05). The dropout rates were similar for patients treated with 
      risperidone and those treated with olanzapine in both analyses. CONCLUSION: An
      indirect meta-analysis of studies comparing olanzapine with haloperidol and
      risperidone with haloperidol yielded conclusions similar to those found in a
      direct comparative RCT of olanzapine and risperidone.

TI  - Effects of long-term treatment with antipsychotics on serum leptin levels.
PG  - 59-62
AB  - BACKGROUND: Abnormal regulation of the adipocyte-derived hormone leptin could
      play a role in body weight gain induced by antipsychotics. AIMS: To study the
      effects of long-term antipsychotic treatment on leptin levels in patients with
      schizophrenia. METHOD: Serum leptin levels were determined in 59 out-patients
      with chronic schizophrenia and in the same number of healthy subjects controlled 
      by gender, age and body mass index. RESULTS: Leptin levels did not differ between
      patients and controls. Leptin levels in patients with schizophrenia correlated
      with weight gain, even after controlling for current weight, but did not show any
      association with clinical variables. Antipsychotic class tended to exert
      different effects over leptin levels (among atypicals, olanzapine induced a
      greater increase). CONCLUSIONS: Elevation of leptin levels induced by chronic
      antipsychotic treatment can be attributed to weight gain, but other mechanisms
      could be involved.

TI  - A qualitative assessment of the neurological safety of antipsychotic drugs; an
      analysis of a risperidone database.
PG  - 104-10
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neurological side effects of antipsychotic agents limit the use of
      these drugs, and development of newer antipsychotic agents has been focused on a 
      reduced risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) as well as effective symptom
      control. METHODS: A qualitative analysis of EPS was performed using
      Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS) data from 11 double-blind risperidone 
      trials. An ESRS factor analysis and maximum changes in ESRS scores were compared 
      for the risperidone, haloperidol, and placebo groups. RESULTS: The factor
      analysis revealed five factors. Between-group comparisons showed no differences
      between placebo and 1 to 2 mg/day-risperidone groups. Parkinsonism, tremor,
      akathisia, and sialorrhea were more likely to occur with haloperidol than with
      placebo or risperidone at 1 to 6 mg/day. Similar results were noted by maximum
      changes in ESRS scores. At risperidone doses of more than 8 mg/day, acute EPS
      severity lay between that of the placebo and haloperidol groups. The severity of 
      tardive dyskinesia was greater in patients receiving placebo than in those
      receiving either active treatment. CONCLUSIONS: As the results described above
      were derived from a post hoc analysis of an existing database, conclusions must
      remain tentative. To provide more definitive answers, EPS assessments in future
      studies should be refined to more accurately predict the type of EPS expected
      with a given agent in clinical practice.

TI  - Dropout rates in randomised antipsychotic drug trials.
PG  - 230-3
AB  - RATIONALE: It has been assumed that new atypical drugs improve treatment
      compliance due to fewer adverse effects. Data supporting this assumption are
      scarce. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to study attrition rates in
      randomised controlled trials of oral administration of conventional antipsychotic
      drugs, atypical antipsychotic drugs and placebo. METHODS: The database of the
      Schizophrenia Module of the Cochrane Library was utilised for the present study. 
      The data in the Cochrane Module are collected by identifying relevant randomised 
      controlled trials from several electronic databases and other sources. Number of 
      dropouts was defined as patients leaving the study preterm due to any reason.
      RESULTS: Data from 328 treatment groups, consisting of 18,585 randomised subjects
      from 163 drug trials, were entered in the analysis. One-third of the subjects had
      dropped out of the trials. The dropout rates significantly increased for each
      calendar year. Year of trial publication, type of drug and trial length remained 
      statistically significant contributors to dropout rates. In a model incorporating
      year of publication and trial length, placebo groups and groups treated with
      conventional antipsychotics had significantly higher attrition rates than groups 
      treated with atypical drugs. When clozapine-treated groups were excluded from the
      analysis, no statistically significant advantage for atypical drugs over
      conventional drugs remained. CONCLUSIONS: Trial data implicate that a better
      compliance can be achieved by favouring atypical drugs rather than conventional
      alternatives in the treatment of schizophrenia. However, this effect is found
      only when groups treated with the atypical antipsychotic clozapine are included
      in the analysis. Our study did not find evidence for a statistically significant 
      superiority in acceptability of novel atypical drugs when compared to
      conventional antipsychotics.

TI  - The dose-response relationship for clonidine added to a postoperative continuous 
      epidural infusion of ropivacaine in children.
PG  - 71-6
AB  - Epidurally administered clonidine enhances the quality and duration of
      postoperative analgesia when it is used as an adjunct to local anesthetics in
      children. We investigated the dose-response relationship for epidural clonidine
      when added to a continuous postoperative epidural infusion of ropivacaine. By use
      of an observer-blinded design, 55 pediatric patients (1-4 yr old) were randomly
      given a postoperative epidural infusion of plain ropivacaine 0.1% 0.2 mg. kg(-1).
      h(-1) (Group R), ropivacaine 0.08% 0.16 mg. kg(-1). h(-1) plus clonidine 0.04
      microg. kg(-1). h(-1) (Group RC1), ropivacaine 0.08% 0.16 mg. kg(-1). h(-1) plus 
      clonidine 0.08 microg. kg(-1). h(-1) (Group RC2), or ropivacaine 0.08% 0.16 mg.
      kg(-1). h(-1) plus clonidine 0.12 microg. kg(-1). h(-1) (Group RC3). A clear
      dose-response relationship could be identified for a continuous infusion of
      epidural clonidine, with clonidine dosages in the 0.08-0.12 microg. kg(-1). h(-1)
      range providing improved postoperative analgesia (reduced Children's Hospital of 
      Eastern Ontario pain score, increased time to first supplemental analgesic
      demand, and a reduced total number of doses of supplemental analgesics during the
      first 48 h after surgery). Analgesia was improved without any signs of increased 
      sedation or other side effects. The adjunct use of epidural clonidine in the
      dosage range of 0.08-0.12 microg. kg(-1). h(-1) appears effective and safe for
      use in children. Implications: The addition of clonidine (0.08-0.12
      microg.kg(-1).h(-1))to a continuous epidural infusion of ropivacaine was found to
      improve postoperative pain relief in children. No clinically significant signs of
      sedation or other side effects were observed.

      well understood. METHODS: The methods employed involved the systematic search
      (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane library, bibliographies, without language restriction,
      up to June 2000) for full reports of randomized comparisons of any intervention
      which is thought to be anti-pruritic (active) compared with placebo or no
      treatment (control) in surgical (including labour) patients receiving opioids.
      The number of patients who had no pruritus were analysed using relative risk and 
      number-needed-to-treat with 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: Twenty-two trials
      (1477 patients) were analysed. Two trials (66 patients), both with low-dose
      propofol, were on treatment of established pruritus; propofol had no
      anti-pruritic effect compared with Intralipid. In prophylaxis trials, the average
      incidence of pruritus with control was 59% (range, 10% to 100%). Most mu-receptor
      antagonists were efficacious: intravenous naloxone 0.25-2.4 microg kg-1 h-1,
      relative risk 2.31 (95% confidence interval, 1.5 to 3.54), number-needed-to-treat
      to prevent pruritus compared with control 3.5; oral naltrexone 9 mg, relative
      risk 2.80 (1.35-5.80), number-needed-to-treat 1.7; naltrexone 6 mg was less
      effective and 3 mg did not work; different intravenous and epidural nalbuphine
      regimens, relative risk 1.71 (1.12-2.62), number-needed-to-treat 4.2. Intravenous
      nalmefene 0.5 or 1 mg was not anti-pruritic. Intravenous (but not epidural)
      droperidol 2.5 mg was efficacious, relative risk, 1.71 (1.28-2.29),
      number-needed-to-treat 4.9. There was a lack of evidence for any anti-pruritic
      efficacy with prophylactic propofol, epidural or intrathecal epinephrine,
      epidural clonidine, epidural prednisone, intravenous ondansetron, or
      intramuscular hydroxyzine. CONCLUSION: Naloxone, naltrexone, nalbuphine and
      droperidol are efficacious in the prevention of opioid-induced pruritus; minimal 
      effective doses remain unknown. There is a lack of valid data on the efficacy of 
      interventions for the treatment of established pruritus.

TI  - Effects of olanzapine and haloperidol on serum prolactin levels in male
      schizophrenic patients.
PG  - 641-7
AB  - It has been proposed that new atypical antipsychotics cause minimal prolactin
      (PRL) elevation compared to traditional antipsychotic agents because they spare
      dopamine blockade within the brain's tuberoinfundibular tract. The aim of this
      study was to compare the effects of olanzapine and haloperidol on PRL secretion
      in male schizophrenic patients. Twenty-nine male schizophrenic inpatients were
      included in the study. Fifteen of them were given olanzapine in a fixed dose of
      10 mg/day PO and 14 of them were given haloperidol in a fixed dose of 10 mg/day
      PO for 6 weeks after a 2-week drug washout period. Fifteen age-matched healthy
      control subjects were used as control group. PRL levels were measured both before
      and after the 6-week treatment period in the patients. At the end of the 6th
      week, the PRL values observed with olanzapine treatment were significantly less
      than those observed with haloperidol, but not different from those of the
      controls. There was a significant positive correlation between the PRL values and
      the severity of extrapyramidal side effects in only the haloperidol group after
      the six week's treatment period. Our data indicate that short-term olanzapine
      treatment at doses of 10 mg/day PO causes minimal elevations in PRL secretion in 
      male schizophrenic patients in contrast to haloperidol. This finding is
      consistent with the previous reports and may be attributed to olanzapine's
      differential effects on dopamine neurotransmission.

TI  - Bupropion SR worsens mood during marijuana withdrawal in humans.
PG  - 171-9
AB  - RATIONALE: Symptoms of withdrawal after daily marijuana smoking include increased
      ratings of irritability and depression. Similar mood symptoms are reported by
      cigarette smokers during nicotine abstinence. OBJECTIVE: Given the successful use
      of sustained-release bupropion in treating nicotine dependence, this study
      investigated how maintenance on bupropion influenced symptoms of marijuana
      withdrawal compared to maintenance on placebo. METHODS: Marijuana smokers (n=10) 
      were maintained outpatient on active (300 mg/day) or placebo (0 mg/day) bupropion
      for 11 days, and were then maintained inpatient on the same bupropion dose for 17
      days. For the first 4 inpatient days, participants smoked active marijuana [2.8% 
      delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)] 5 times/day. For the remaining inpatient days,
      participants smoked placebo marijuana (0.0% THC) 5 times/day. Participants were
      then maintained outpatient on the alternate dose of bupropion for 11 days,
      followed by a second inpatient residential stay, paralleling the first.
      Medication administration was double-blind. Mood, psychomotor task performance,
      food intake, and sleep were measured daily during each inpatient phase. The order
      of active and placebo bupropion maintenance was counterbalanced between groups.
      RESULTS: Bupropion had few behavioral effects when participants smoked active
      marijuana. During placebo marijuana smoking, i.e., active marijuana withdrawal,
      ratings of irritability, restlessness, depression, and trouble sleeping were
      increased by bupropion compared to placebo maintenance. CONCLUSIONS: These data
      suggest that bupropion does not show promise as a potential treatment medication 
      for marijuana dependence.

TI  - Intramuscular (IM) ziprasidone 20 mg is effective in reducing acute agitation
      associated with psychosis: a double-blind, randomized trial.
PG  - 128-34
AB  - RATIONALE: Intramuscular (IM) conventional antipsychotics and/or benzodiazepines 
      are effective in the short-term treatment of acutely agitated psychotic patients 
      but may be associated with adverse effects. A short-acting IM formulation of the 
      novel antipsychotic, ziprasidone, which may offer advantages over conventional
      agents, has been developed. OBJECTIVE: To compare ziprasidone IM 2 mg (n=38) and 
      20 mg (n=41) in the acute control and short-term management of agitated psychotic
      patients. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, double-blind, 24-h study assessed
      efficacy using the Behavioral Activity Rating Scale (BARS) and the PANSS. The
      BARS is a validated rating scale for the assessment of treatment response in
      acute agitation associated with psychosis. Following the initial dose, three more
      doses could be given 4 h apart if needed during the 24-h period. RESULTS: The
      mean BARS score had decreased 15 min after the first 20 mg IM dose and was
      statistically significantly lower than the 2 mg group at 30 min post-dose. The
      improvement with the 20 mg dose increased until 2 h, and was maintained until at 
      least 4 h post-dose (P<0.001). Two hours after the first injection, almost all of
      the patients receiving ziprasidone 20 mg were BARS responders compared with just 
      one-third of those receiving 2 mg ziprasidone (P<0.001). The calming effect of
      ziprasidone was also evident by the significant reduction in PANSS agitation
      items (P<0.05) and CGI-severity at 4 h (P=0.008). Both ziprasidone doses were
      very well tolerated. Ziprasidone IM 20 mg was not associated with EPS, dystonia, 
      akathisia, respiratory depression or with excessive sedation. CONCLUSIONS:
      Ziprasidone IM 20 mg substantially and significantly reduced the symptoms of
      acute agitation in patients with psychotic disorders. Ziprasidone 20 mg IM was
      very well tolerated and produced no dystonia or akathisia.

TI  - Late-term smoking cessation despite initial failure: an evaluation of bupropion
      sustained release, nicotine patch, combination therapy, and placebo.
PG  - 744-52
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of long-term
      use of bupropion sustained release (SR), the nicotine patch, and the combination 
      of these 2 treatments in patients who initially failed treatment. METHODS: This
      was a post hoc analysis of a multicenter, double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled clinical trial in 893 smokers. Patients were randomly assigned
      to 9 weeks of treatment with placebo (n = 160), bupropion SR (n = 244), nicotine 
      patch (n = 244), or a combination of nicotine patch and bupropion SR (n = 245).
      The study was originally designed with a follow-up period of 52 weeks. In this
      analysis, short-term success was defined as smoking cessation after 14 or 21 days
      of therapy and long-term success was defined as smoking cessation after >21 days 
      of therapy. Patients who did not achieve short-term success were evaluated for
      long-term success at week 9 (end of treatment), 6 months, and 1 year after the
      start of the study. RESULTS: The mean age of the smokers was 44 years. The
      majority (93%) of patients were white, and 52% were female. The study subjects
      smoked an average of 27 cigarettes per day. Among the 467 patients who initially 
      failed treatment in the first 3 weeks, treatment with bupropion SR alone and in
      combination with the nicotine patch produced significant increases in successful 
      smoking cessation rates from weeks 4 to 9 (19% bupropion SR or combination, 7%
      nicotine patch, 7% placebo), at month 6 (11% bupropion SR, 13% combination, 2%
      nicotine patch, 3% placebo), and at month 12 (10% bupropion SR, 7% combination,
      2% nicotine patch, 1% placebo) (P < 0.05 for bupropion SR and combination vs
      nicotine patch or placebo). CONCLUSION: Among patients who initially failed
      treatment, continued therapy with bupropion SR, either alone or in combination
      with the nicotine patch, resulted in significantly higher short- and long-term
      smoking cessation rates than treatment with the nicotine patch alone or placebo.

TI  - Long-term olanzapine therapy in the treatment of bipolar I disorder: an
      open-label continuation phase study.
PG  - 273-81
AB  - BACKGROUND: Olanzapine has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of acute mania 
      in 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. We describe the results of the
      open-label extension from one of these trials. METHOD: In a 3-week, double-blind 
      study of patients with DSM-IV bipolar I disorder, olanzapine was superior to
      placebo for the treatment of acute manic symptoms. Of the 139 patients who
      entered the double-blind phase of the 3-week study, 113 patients continued into
      the 49-week open-label extension. Efficacy measurements including the Young Mania
      Rating Scale (YMRS), the 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-21),
      the Clinical Global Impressions scale-Bipolar Version, and the Positive and
      Negative Syndrome Scale and safety measurements including the Simpson-Angus
      scale, the Barnes Akathisia Scale, and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale
      were completed throughout. The analysis considered all treatment results,
      starting with the first olanzapine dose. Adjunctive lithium and fluoxetine were
      allowed during the open-label extension. RESULTS: The mean length of olanzapine
      treatment was 6.6 months, with a mean modal dose of 13.9 mg/day. A significant
      mean improvement in the YMRS total score, baseline to endpoint (-18.01, p <
      .001), was observed. During treatment, 88.3% of patients experienced a remission 
      of manic symptoms (YMRS total score < or =12), and only 25.5% subsequently
      relapsed (YMRS total score > or = 15). Significant improvement in HAM-D-21 scores
      was observed (p < .001). Forty-one percent of patients were maintained on
      olanzapine monotherapy. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events
      reported were somnolence (46.0%), depression (38.9%), and weight gain (36.3%).
      CONCLUSION: During up to 1 year of olanzapine therapy, either as monotherapy or
      in combination with lithium and/or fluoxetine, patients with bipolar disorder
      demonstrated significant improvement in mania and depression symptoms with a
      favorable safety profile. Further double-blind, controlled studies are needed to 
      confirm these results.

      parallel-group design in the treatment of aggression in adolescents with a
      primary diagnosis of DSM-IV disruptive behavior disorders and with subaverage
      intelligence. METHOD: We randomly assigned 38 adolescents (33 boys; 10 subjects
      with slightly subaverage IQ, 14 with borderline IQ, and 14 with mild mental
      retardation), who were hospitalized for treatment of psychiatric disorders
      associated with severe aggression, to receive risperidone or placebo. The main
      efficacy measures were the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale 
      (CGI-S), the modified Overt Aggression Scale (OAS-M), and the Aberrant Behavior
      Checklist (ABC). Side effects were measured using the Extrapyramidal Symptom
      Rating Scale (ESRS). RESULTS: The mean daily dose of risperidone at the end of
      treatment was 2.9 mg (range, 1.5-4 mg). Risperidone, compared with placebo, was
      associated with significant improvements on the CGI-S (p < .001) and the
      at-school ABC overall and hyperactivity scales (p < .05). During a 2-week washout
      following the 6-week trial, a statistically significant worsening was found in
      the risperidone group on the CGI-S scale, the OAS-M. and the ABC. Extrapyramidal 
      symptoms were absent or very mild during risperidone treatment. Transient
      tiredness was present in 11 (58%) of 19 drug-treated subjects. Other untoward
      effects included sialorrhea, nausea, and slight weight gain (mean = 3.5% of body 
      weight in the risperidone group). No clinically relevant changes were found in
      laboratory parameters, electrocardiogram, heart rate, or blood pressure.
      CONCLUSION: These results suggest that risperidone may be effective for severe
      aggression in adolescents with disruptive behavior disorders and subaverage
      intelligence, and these results are consistent with reports suggesting its
      effectiveness for treating severe aggression in adolescents in general.

TI  - Response in relation to baseline anxiety levels in major depressive disorder
      treated with bupropion sustained release or sertraline.
PG  - 131-8
AB  - Our objective was to determine if pretreatment anxiety levels were associated
      with preferential response to bupropion sustained release (n = 122) or sertraline
      (n = 126) during a 16-week randomized acute phase treatment study. Both agents
      had comparable antidepressant activity, and comparable anxiolytic effects using
      the intent-to-treat sample. Baseline anxiety levels were not related to
      antidepressant efficacy, and they did not differentiate responders to each agent.
      Time to clinically significant anxiolysis did not differentiate between treatment
      groups or between responders to each agent. These results contradict the commonly
      held, but unsubstantiated, belief that in clinically depressed anxious patients, 
      serotonergic antidepressants are especially anxiolytic and that such patients
      preferentially benefit from the antidepressant or anxiolytic effects of selective
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Thus, the clinical decision to select between
      these two agents when treating depressed outpatients cannot rest on either levels
      of pretreatment anxiety or on anticipation of more rapid or more complete
      anxiolysis.

TI  - Weight gain over 4 months in schizophrenia patients: a comparison of olanzapine
      and risperidone.
PG  - 261-7
AB  - Weight gain frequently accompanies treatment with antipsychotics. In order to
      determine whether newer antipsychotic agents differ from each other with respect 
      to weight gain, we compared two cohorts of patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia who
      had newly started treatment with either risperidone or olanzapine. After
      obtaining informed consent, data regarding body weight and height were culled
      from existing medical records of 100 patients (50 patients in each treatment
      group). Baseline body weight, close to the time of starting the new medication,
      and body mass index [BMI = weight (kg)/height (m) squared] were compared to the
      body weight and BMI following 4 months of treatment. There was no significant
      change in mean body weight or BMI in the group treated with risperidone (baseline
      weight = 83.1 kg +/- 20.5, follow-up = 82.8 kg +/- 19.9; matched pair t = 0.66, P
      = n.s.; baseline BMI = 29.6 +/- 9.4, follow-up = 29.5 +/- 9.1; matched pair t =
      0.79, P = n.s.). However, in the group treated with olanzapine, there was a
      significant increase in both mean body weight and BMI (baseline weight = 84.9 kg 
      +/- 25.0, follow-up = 87.1 kg +/- 25.1; matched pair t = 4.62, P < 0.001;
      baseline BMI = 29.5 +/- 7.4, follow-up = 30.3 +/- 7.5; matched pair t = 4.43, P <
      0.001). In this naturalistic study, treatment with olanzapine was associated with
      a mean weight gain of about 2 kg from baseline, in patients with schizophrenia,
      while treatment with risperidone was associated with no mean weight change.

TI  - Detecting improvement in quality of life and symptomatology in schizophrenia.
PG  - 227-34
AB  - Instrument-based scores are often used as outcome measures. However, little is
      known about what changes in scores mean in terms of a clinical assessment of
      improvement or deterioration. The purpose of this report was to determine how
      much change in standard instrument scores represents a clinically detectable
      improvement or deterioration. The Veterans Affairs (VA) Cooperative Study of
      Clozapine in Refractory Schizophrenia evaluated 423 patients on clozapine or
      haloperidol. Symptoms and quality of life scales were completed at baseline; 6
      weeks; and 3, 6, and 12 months. Among patients judged as "improved" by
      clinicians, the average percentage changes were a 21 percent decrease in Positive
      and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores and a 26 percent increase in Quality
      of Life Scale (QLS) scores across all followup periods. The change in mean
      seven-point item scores were -0.46 (PANSS) and 0.23 (QLS). A major gain in
      clinically assessed improvement to "much better" was associated with a 45 percent
      decline in PANSS scores and 50 percent increase in QLS scores (change in mean
      seven-point item scores -0.88 and 0.92, respectively). Thus, modest changes in
      psychometric scales assessing symptoms and quality of life reflect clinically
      detectable improvement.

TI  - Toward individualized evidence-based medicine: five "N of 1" trials of
      methylphenidate in geriatric patients.
PG  - 474-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the efficacy of methylphenidate in depressed or
      apathetic geriatric patients. DESIGN: Five "N of 1" trials (individual
      cross-over, double-blinded, randomized trials). SETTING: Department of
      Geriatrics, University Medical Center, Nijmegen, and two nursing homes in
      Nijmegen, the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: Patients suffered from depression due to
      a general medical condition (n = 2); depression resistant to antidepressive drugs
      (n = 1), chronic apathy due to mild and moderate severe dementia (n = 2).
      INTERVENTION: Methylphenidate (5 mg bid) and placebo (both for two subsequent
      days) in 5 weeks of randomized treatment blocks. MEASUREMENTS: Montgomery Asberg 
      Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES)-clinician, the
      AES-informant, Barthel index and a semiquantitative checklist of adverse effects.
      RESULTS: Among the three depressed patients, two showed significant improvement
      on the MADRS (P = .089 and P = .001; alpha = 0.10), one patient's apathy showed
      significant improvement on AES-clinician and -informant (P = .077 and P = .086). 
      One apathetic patient's trial was stopped because AES could not be completed.
      None of the patients showed significant changes in the Barthel index. No side
      effects developed. CONCLUSION: "N of 1" trials are useful in evaluating efficacy 
      of methylphenidate in depressed or apathetic geriatric patients. Single-patient
      trials can be a useful tool in pharmacotherapeutic decision-making in frail older
      subjects.

TI  - Moxonidine: some controversy.
PG  - 337-50
AB  - Initially it was considered that moxonidine, like clonidine, acted at central
      (2)-adrenoceptors to reduce blood pressure. With the characterisation of
      imidazoline binding sites distinct from (2)-adrenoceptors, the consensus became
      that moxonidine was acting predominantly at imidazoline I(1) receptors in the
      rostral ventrolateral medulla to lower blood pressure. Moxonidine acts at
      prejunctional (2)-adrenoceptors on sympathetic nerve endings to decrease
      noradrenaline release and this may contribute to its ability to lower blood
      pressure. The predominant site of action of moxonidine may also depend on route
      of administration, with imidazoline I(1) receptors being predominant after
      central, and (2)-adrenoceptors predominant after systemic administration. The
      controversy over the mechanism and site of action with moxonidine is ongoing. In 
      animal models, moxonidine lowers blood pressure, reduces cardiac hypertrophy and 
      remodelling, reduces cardiac arrhythmias and increases blood flow in cerebral
      ischaemia. Moxonidine also has beneficial effects in animal models of diabetes
      and kidney disease. Moxonidine increases sodium and water excretion in rats, but 
      not humans. Animal studies indicate that moxonidine may be useful in the
      treatment of glaucoma by reducing intra-ocular pressure. Animal studies show that
      moxonidine may also be effective in pain and in ethanol withdrawal. In humans,
      the pharmacokinetics of moxonidine are of the one-compartment model with
      first-order absorption. Renal elimination is the major route of elimination and
      individual titration of moxonidine is needed in patients with renal impairment.
      There is overwhelming evidence that moxonidine is a safe and effective
      antihypertensive. A large clinical trial of moxonidine in heart failure, MOXCON, 
      was stopped because of excessive deaths in the moxonidine group. Moxonidine
      should not be used in patients with heart failure, but there are no obvious
      reasons to stop its use as an antihypertensive, or its development for other
      clinical uses.

TI  - [Incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms during treatment with olanzapine,
      haloperidol and risperidone: results of an observational study].
PG  - 25-32
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To analyze the incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and the
      concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs in outpatients diagnosed of
      schizophrenia treated with olanzapine (OLZ) in comparison with haloperidol (HAL) 
      and risperidone (RIS) under routine clinical practice conditions. MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: The analysis was carried out on the basis of the information obtained in
      the EFESO study, an observational, prospective study carried out in outpatients
      diagnosed of schizophrenia and treated with olanzapine compared to other
      antipsychotic agents used in the clinical practice. The incidence of EPS in the
      OLZ treated group compared to the haloperidol and risperidone treatment groups in
      which over 100 patients were included is analyzed in the present work. The study 
      duration was 6 months and the data were collected by 293 psychiatrists from
      mental health care areas. RESULTS: The percentage of patients who presented at
      least one adverse event (AE) (p 3/4 0.001) was less in the OLZ groups (47.8%)
      compared to those of the HAL (79.8%) and RIS (57.2%) subgroups. A lower
      percentage of patients treated with OLZ (36.9%) presented EPS in comparison to
      the RIS (49.6%) and HAL (76%) subgroups (p 3/4 0.001). A lower rate of patients
      from the OLZ group (10.2%) received anticholinergic treatments compared to the
      RIS (19.9%) and HAL (44%) subgroups (p< 0.001 in both cases). CONCLUSIONS:
      OLZ-treated patients presented a lower incidence of EPS and required less
      anticholinergic treatment than the HAL and RIS treated patients. These results,
      obtained in naturalistic conditions, coincide with the conclusions reached in
      randomized clinical trials carried out prior to the marketing of OLZ.

      anesthesia].
PG  - 255-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the effect of the addition of clonidine to lidocaine on
      postoperative pain after intravenous regional anaesthesia. STUDY DESIGN: Double
      blind prospective study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-five patients were randomly 
      allocated to two groups: group 1 (n = 25) receiving 3 mg.kg-1 of lidocaine 0.5%
      added to saline and group 2 (n = 20) receiving 3 mg.kg-1 of lidocaine 0.5% added 
      to clonidine (150 micrograms). Postoperative analgesia was assessed using a
      visual analogue pain score (VAPS) and the time to first analgesic request. The
      incidence of side effects after tourniquet release was noted. Analysis of
      variance, Kruskall Wallis and chi 2 tests were used for statistical analysis. A
      p-value of < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Age, ASA class, duration
      and type of surgery, tourniquet time and sensory block duration were comparable
      for the two groups. The time to first antalgic request after deflation of
      tourniquet was similar in the two groups (38 +/- 15 min versus 44 +/- 19 min),
      while VAPS score was lower (p < 0.05) in the clonidine group (5.2 versus 6.8).
      The incidence of side effects was comparable in the two groups. CONCLUSION: The
      addition of clonidine (150 micrograms) to lidocaine for intravenous regional
      anaesthesia improved postoperative analgesia but in a limited and short-lasting
      manner.

      sexual dysfunction: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group study.
PG  - 805-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors compared low-dose sustained-release bupropion with placebo
      for sexual dysfunction induced by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
      (SSRIs). METHOD: Thirty adults who had received SSRIs for at least 6 weeks, who
      were euthymic, and who had sexual dysfunction as determined by a total score
      greater than 19 out of a possible 30 on the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale were 
      randomly assigned to receive either 150 mg/day of sustained-release bupropion or 
      placebo at 6:00 p.m. for 3 weeks. RESULTS: There were no significant differences 
      between the sustained-release bupropion and placebo groups as measured by change 
      in Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale or Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores or
      side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Future studies should compare higher doses of
      bupropion for treating sexual dysfunction and should include a greater number of 
      subjects.

TI  - A randomized double-blind study of risperidone and olanzapine in the treatment of
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.
PG  - 765-74
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The safety and efficacy of risperidone and olanzapine were compared in
      a double-blind trial that used doses widely accepted in clinical practice.
      METHOD: Subjects (N=377) who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia or
      schizoaffective disorder were randomly assigned to receive 2-6 mg/day of
      risperidone (mean modal dose=4.8 mg/day) or 5-20 mg/day of olanzapine (mean modal
      dose=12.4 mg/day) for 8 weeks. RESULTS: The two study groups were similar at
      baseline except that the olanzapine group was slightly younger than the
      risperidone group. Seventy-five percent of the participants completed the trial, 
      with no between-treatment differences in the proportion of dropouts. Similar
      proportions of the risperidone and olanzapine groups reported extrapyramidal
      symptoms (24% and 20%, respectively). Severity of extrapyramidal symptoms was low
      in both groups, with no between-group differences. Total Positive and Negative
      Syndrome Scale scores and scores on the five Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale
      factors were improved in both groups at week 8 (subjects who completed the study)
      and endpoint (all subjects, including dropouts). There were overall
      between-treatment differences in efficacy. Comparison of individual factors found
      no significant differences at endpoint; at week 8, however, improvements on
      Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale factors for positive symptoms and
      anxiety/depression were greater with risperidone than olanzapine. An increase in 
      body weight of > or =7% was seen in 27% of olanzapine participants and 12% of
      risperidone participants. CONCLUSIONS: Both treatments were well tolerated and
      efficacious. The frequency and severity of extrapyramidal symptoms were similar
      in the two treatment groups. Greater reductions in severity of positive and
      affective symptoms were seen with risperidone than with olanzapine treatment
      among study completers. There was no measure on which olanzapine was superior.
      Greater weight gain was associated with olanzapine than with risperidone
      treatment.

TI  - [Reduction of ocular pulse amplitude by apraclonidine--prospective double-blind, 
      randomized clinical trial with 10 subjects].
PG  - 187-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: The alpha-agonist Apraclonidin lowers effective intraocular pressure.
      Ischemia gains increasing importance in the pathogenesis of glaucoma. Therefore, 
      an antiglaucomatous drug should also be investigated in regard of its influence
      on ocular hemodynamics. METHODS: In a double masked, randomized, clinical trial
      0.5% Apraclonidin eye drops were applied in 10 health subjects twice daily for 8 
      days. The control group (10 healty volunteers) received a placebo medication
      (0.9% NaCI) according to the same protocol. IOP, heart rate, blood pressure and
      ocular pulse amplitudes (OBF Labs, UK) were measured at baseline (1T0), 90
      minutes after instillation of one eye drop (1T90), after 7 days of therapy (8T0) 
      and again 90 minutes after an acute instillation (8T90). For statistical analysis
      the wilcoxon test for paried samples was used. RESULTS: In Apraclonindin treated 
      subjects IOP dropped significantly (P<0.01) from 15.6 mm Hg to 11.4/12.4/10.3 mm 
      Hg (1T0/1T90/8T0/8T90. The control group showed a significant reduction at 1T90
      (p + 0.01)and at 8T90 (p = 0.005) from 3.22 mm Hg to 2.48/31/2.35 mm Hg
      (1T0/1T90/8T0/8T90), in the control group the pulse amplitude remained constant. 
      CONCLUSION: After one week of therapy with 0.5% Apralonidin, intraocular pressure
      dropped as expected in health volunteers. The observed reduction in pulse
      amplitudes in pulse amplitudes however could have a negative effect on long-term 
      therapy in patients with chronic open-angle glaucoma .

PG  - 105-10
AB  - Cognitive impairment in multiple domains is common in patients with schizophrenia
      and may be a powerful determinant of poor functional ability and quality of life.
      We report a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study of donepezil
      augmentation in a schizoaffective disorder patient stabilized on olanzapine
      pharmacotherapy. The patient showed significant improvements in several cognitive
      measures and increased activation of prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia on
      functional MRI during the donepezil augmentation. In addition, the donepezil
      augmentation resulted in a reduction of depressive symptoms and in significant
      improvements in functional abilities and quality of life. Further studies of
      donepezil augmentation of neuroleptics in schizophrenia are warranted.

AB  - Patients treated with olanzapine may gain weight, especially in the first months 
      of therapy. Amantadine (100-300 mg/day) was started in 12 patients having a mean 
      weight gain of 7.3 kg during olanzapine treatment. The patients' weight
      stabilised and over 3-6 months they lost an average of 3.5 kg. No clinical
      deterioration occurred and no adverse effects were reported. These observations
      merit confirmation in randomised, controlled trials.

TI  - Analysis of the QTc interval during olanzapine treatment of patients with
      schizophrenia and related psychosis.
PG  - 191-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: There may be a temporal association between some antipsychotics and
      prolongation of the heart-rate-corrected QT interval (QTc) representing a delay
      in ventricular repolarization. QTc prolongation significantly exceeding normal
      intra-individual and interindividual variation may increase the risk of
      ventricular tachydysrhythmias, especially torsade de pointes, and therefore,
      sudden cardiac death. METHOD: Electrocardiogram recordings obtained as part of
      the safety assessment of olanzapine in 4 controlled, randomized clinical trials
      (N = 2,700) were analyzed. These analyses were conducted to characterize any
      change in QTc temporally associated with olanzapine, compared with placebo,
      haloperidol, and risperidone, in acutely psychotic patients (DSM-III-R and
      DSM-IV) and to characterize variability and temporal course of the QTc in this
      patient population. Changes from baseline to minimum and maximum QTc were tested 
      for significance, and baseline to acute-phase endpoint change in mean QTc was
      tested for significance within treatments and for differences between olanzapine 
      and comparators. The possibility of a linear relationship between dose of
      olanzapine and mean change in QTc, as well as incidence of treatment-emergent
      prolongation of QTc (change from < 430 msec at baseline to > or =430 msec at
      endpoint), was tested. RESULTS: The incidence of maximum QTc > or = 450 msec
      during treatment was approximately equal to the incidence of QTc > or =450 msec
      at baseline. CONCLUSION: Results of these analyses suggest that olanzapine, as
      therapeutically administered to patients with schizophrenia and related
      psychoses, does not contribute to QTc prolongation resulting in potentially fatal
      ventricular arrhythmias.

TI  - A comparison of long-term outcome in first-episode schizophrenia following
      treatment with risperidone or a typical antipsychotic.
PG  - 179-84
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most reports assessing the efficacy and tolerability of risperidone
      have involved patients previously treated with typical antipsychotics. Such
      patients are more likely to have a greater resistance or intolerance to
      treatment, thus restricting our interpretation of the impact a new treatment
      might have on the course of schizophrenia and possibly biasing the results. The
      present study examines the relative effectiveness of risperidone and typical
      antipsychotics in patients being treated for their first episode of
      schizophrenia. METHOD: From a cohort of 126 patients, 2 groups of 19
      first-episode DSM-III-R/DSM-IV schizophrenia patients matched for age, gender,
      length of illness, and length of treatment and treated with either a typical
      antipsychotic or risperidone for a minimum of 1 year were compared on a number of
      outcome dimensions during their course of treatment and at follow-up. Treatment
      allocation was not random, and patients were judged to be compliant with
      medication. Patients treated with typical antipsychotics were followed up for a
      statistically nonsignificantly longer time (mean = 2.7 vs. 1.9 years). RESULTS:
      Six patients (31.6%) from the typical antipsychotic group were admitted to the
      hospital within the first year following the index admission compared with 1
      patient (5.3%) in the risperidone group (admitted at month 14). Patients in the
      risperidone group showed a statistically significantly lower length of first
      hospitalization (p < .01), utilization of inpatient beds during the course of
      treatment (p < .001), and use of anticholinergic medication (p < .05). There were
      no statistically significant differences in symptom levels, either during the
      course of treatment or at follow-up; in the use of antidepressant, antianxiety,
      or mood-stabilizing drugs; or in changes in living circumstances or employment.
      CONCLUSION: These findings confirm at least equal long-term efficacy of typical
      antipsychotics and risperidone, but a possible advantage for risperidone in
      decreased service utilization and decreased use of anticholinergic drugs.

TI  - An MRI study of basal ganglia volumes in first-episode schizophrenia patients
      treated with risperidone.
PG  - 625-31
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The basal ganglia may contribute to extrapyramidal movement disorders,
      affective disturbances, and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. Basal ganglia
      volumes are putatively affected by antipsychotic medications. The purpose of this
      study was to determine the long-term effects of risperidone treatment in a cohort
      of first-episode patients with schizophrenia. METHOD: The subjects were 30
      patients with first-episode schizophrenia, 12 patients chronically treated with
      typical antipsychotics, and 23 healthy comparison subjects. They were scanned by 
      magnetic resonance imaging at baseline. The first-episode patients received 1
      year of continuous risperidone treatment, after which they and the comparison
      subjects were rescanned. Caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus volumes were
      determined from coronal images. RESULTS: The baseline caudate, putamen, and
      globus pallidus volumes were significantly larger in the chronically treated
      patients than in the untreated first-episode subjects and comparison subjects.
      These volumes did not differ between the first-episode patients and healthy
      comparison subjects. Basal ganglia volumes were unchanged after 1 year of
      exposure to risperidone in the first-episode subjects. Extrapyramidal movement
      disorders were present in the majority of chronically treated patients and more
      than one-third of the never-medicated first-episode patients at baseline.
      CONCLUSIONS: This group of first-episode patients did not exhibit abnormalities
      of basal ganglia volumes, nor were basal ganglia volumes affected by exposure to 
      risperidone. Movement disorders were observed in both first-episode and
      chronically treated patients, suggesting effects of both illness and medications.

TI  - Effectiveness of second-generation antipsychotics in patients with
      treatment-resistant schizophrenia: a review and meta-analysis of randomized
      trials.
PG  - 518-26
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors conducted a review and meta-analysis of studies that
      compared the efficacy and tolerability of typical and second-generation
      antipsychotics for patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. METHOD: A
      systematic search revealed 12 controlled studies (involving 1,916 independent
      patients), which were included in the review. For the seven studies that compared
      clozapine to a typical antipsychotic, a meta-analysis was performed to examine
      clozapine's effects on overall psychopathology, response rate, extrapyramidal
      symptoms, and tardive dyskinesia. RESULTS: The meta-analysis confirmed that
      treatment-resistant schizophrenic patients have more favorable outcomes when
      treated with clozapine rather than a typical antipsychotic, as reflected by Brief
      Psychiatric Rating Scale total score, categorical response rate, Scale for the
      Assessment of Negative Symptoms score, Simpson-Angus Rating Scale score, and
      compliance rate. Clozapine also conferred benefits on the sickest
      treatment-resistant schizophrenic patients. Patients treated with olanzapine also
      had more favorable outcomes with regard to categorical response and compliance
      rates. CONCLUSIONS: In the aggregate, the results of a meta-analysis indicated
      that clozapine exhibits superiority over typical antipsychotics in terms of both 
      efficacy (as measured by improvement in overall psychopathology) and safety (in
      terms of reduced extrapyramidal side effects). However, the magnitude of the
      clozapine treatment effect was not consistently robust. Efficacy data for other
      second-generation antipsychotics in the treatment of patients with refractory
      schizophrenia were inconclusive. There is, therefore, a growing need to consider 
      new and different treatment strategies, whether they be adjunctive or
      monotherapeutic, for schizophrenia that continues to be resistant or only
      partially responsive to treatment.

TI  - Long-term olanzapine treatment: weight change and weight-related health factors
      in schizophrenia.
PG  - 92-100
AB  - BACKGROUND: Weight change and the weight-related health factors of nonfasting
      serum glucose, serum cholesterol, and diastolic blood pressure levels were
      analyzed in patients with DSM-III-R schizophrenia and related disorders who
      received treatment with olanzapine for up to 3 years, and comparisons were made
      to patients treated with haloperidol. Baseline body mass index (BBMI; kg/m2) and 
      dose (mg/day) were investigated as predictors of long-term weight change
      experienced during olanzapine treatment. METHOD: This analysis retrospectively
      examined 573 patients receiving olanzapine and 103 patients receiving haloperidol
      for 39 weeks or more from a study of 1,996 patients randomly assigned 2:1 to
      either olanzapine, 5 to 20 mg/day, or haloperidol, 5 to 20 mg/day. After 6 weeks 
      of acute therapy, patients continued for 1 year or more with either double-blind 
      or open-label olanzapine therapy or double-blind haloperidol therapy. RESULTS:
      Mean weight gain for olanzapine-treated patients observed for a median of 2.54
      years trended toward a plateau after the first 39 weeks of treatment with a
      last-observation-carried-forward mean weight change of 6.26 kg (13.8 lb) and a
      median of 5.90 kg (13.0 lb). This was significantly higher than that for
      haloperidol-treated patients, whose mean weight gain was 0.69 kg (1.5 lb) after
      1.15 years (p < .001). Patients with higher BBMI (> 27.6) gained significantly
      less weight during treatment with olanzapine than their lighter counterparts
      (BBMI < 27.6) (p < .001). The effect of olanzapine dose on weight was not
      significant (p > or = . 183). Median serum glucose at endpoint was not
      significantly associated (p = .096) with weight change for olanzapine. Median
      serum cholesterol and diastolic blood pressure for olanzapine-treated patients at
      endpoint showed a relationship with weight change that was statistically (p < or 
      = .001) but not clinically significant. The difference in incidence of elevated
      serum glucose, cholesterol, or diastolic blood pressure between olanzapine and
      haloperidol therapy groups was not different (p > .05). CONCLUSION: Mean weight
      gain during olanzapine treatment trended toward a plateau after the initial 39
      weeks of treatment with no further significant gain out to 3 years. Higher BBMI
      was predictive of a lower long-term weight gain, while dose was not a significant
      predictor of greater longer term weight change. The relationship between weight
      change and glucose was not statistically significant. The association between
      weight change and changes in cholesterol as well as changes in diastolic blood
      pressure was statistically significant but not considered clinically relevant
      based on the ranges observed.

TI  - Olanzapine: an updated review of its use in the management of schizophrenia.
PG  - 111-61
AB  - Olanzapine, a thienobenzodiazepine derivative, is a second generation (atypical) 
      antipsychotic agent which has proven efficacy against the positive and negative
      symptoms of schizophrenia. Compared with conventional antipsychotics, it has
      greater affinity for serotonin 5-HT2A than for dopamine D2 receptors. In large,
      well controlled trials in patients with schizophrenia or related psychoses,
      olanzapine 5 to 20 mg/day was significantly superior to haloperidol 5 to 20
      mg/day in overall improvements in psychopathology rating scales and in the
      treatment of depressive and negative symptoms, and was comparable in effects on
      positive psychotic symptoms. The 1-year risk of relapse (rehospitalisation) was
      significantly lower with olanzapine than with haloperidol treatment. In the first
      double-blind comparative study (28-week) of olanzapine and risperidone,
      olanzapine 10 to 20 mg/day proved to be significantly more effective than
      risperidone 4 to 12 mg/day in the treatment of negative and depressive symptoms
      but not on overall psychopathology symptoms. In contrast, preliminary results
      from an 8-week controlled study suggested risperidone 2 to 6 mg/day was superior 
      to olanzapine 5 to 20 mg/day against positive and anxiety/depressive symptoms (p 
      < 0.05), although consistent with the first study, both agents demonstrated
      similar efficacy on measures of overall psychopathology. Improvements in general 
      cognitive function seen with olanzapine treatment in a 1-year controlled study of
      patients with early-phase schizophrenia, were significantly greater than changes 
      seen with either risperidone or haloperidol. However, preliminary results from an
      8-week trial showed comparable cognitive enhancing effects of olanzapine and
      risperidone treatment in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.
      Several studies indicate that olanzapine has benefits against symptoms of
      aggression and agitation, while other studies strongly support the effectiveness 
      of olanzapine in the treatment of depressive symptomatology. Olanzapine is
      associated with significantly fewer extrapyramidal symptoms than haloperidol and 
      risperidone. In addition, olanzapine is not associated with a risk of
      agranulocytosis as seen with clozapine or clinically significant
      hyperprolactinaemia as seen with risperidone or prolongation of the QT interval. 
      The most common adverse effects reported with olanzapine are bodyweight gain,
      somnolence, dizziness, anticholinergic effects (constipation and dry mouth) and
      transient asymptomatic liver enzyme elevations. In comparison with haloperidol,
      the adverse events reported significantly more frequently with olanzapine in > or
      = 3.5% of patients were dry mouth, bodyweight gain and increased appetite and
      compared with risperidone, only bodyweight gain occurred significantly more
      frequently with olanzapine. The high acquisition cost of olanzapine is offset by 
      reductions in other treatment costs (inpatient and/or outpatient services) of
      schizophrenia. Pharmacoeconomic analyses indicate that olanzapine does not
      significantly increase, and may even decrease, the overall direct treatment costs
      of schizophrenia, compared with haloperidol. Compared with risperidone,
      olanzapine has also been reported to decrease overall treatment costs, despite
      the several-fold higher daily acquisition cost of the drug. Olanzapine treatment 
      improves quality of life in patients with schizophrenia and related psychoses to 
      a greater extent than haloperidol, and to broadly the same extent as risperidone.
      CONCLUSIONS: Olanzapine demonstrated superior antipsychotic efficacy compared
      with haloperidol in the treatment of acute phase schizophrenia, and in the
      treatment of some patients with first-episode or treatment-resistant
      schizophrenia. The reduced risk of adverse events and therapeutic superiority
      compared with haloperidol and risperidone in the treatment of negative and
      depressive symptoms support the choice of olanzapine as a first-line option in
      the management of schizophrenia in the acute phase and for the maintenance of
      treatment response.

TI  - Clozapine for the treatment of drug-induced psychosis in Parkinson's disease:
      results of the 12 week open label extension in the PSYCLOPS trial.
PG  - 135-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report the results of the 12-week, prospective, open label
      extension of the 4-week, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind PSYCLOPS
      (PSYchosis and CLOzapine in the treatment of Parkinsonism) trial. This extension 
      examined the chronic safety and efficacy of clozapine in the treatment of
      drug-induced psychosis in Parkinson's disease (PD). BACKGROUND: Psychosis is a
      serious late complication of PD and may be a harbinger to increased mortality.
      Clozapine, the first atypical antipsychotic, was shown in several small open
      label studies to improve psychosis without worsening of motor symptoms. This was 
      recently confirmed in the double-blind PSYCLOPS trial. METHODS: The 53 patients
      who completed the double-blind portion of PSYCLOPS were evaluated on their
      original randomized treatment (clozapine or placebo), then had study medication
      stopped. All were started on clozapine. The patients from both treatment groups
      were evaluated every 4 weeks over a 12-week period using standardized measures
      for psychosis and PD. RESULTS: The mean dose of clozapine was 28.78 mg/day. Those
      originally treated with placebo improved significantly in Brief Psychiatric
      Rating Scale and clinical global scores for psychosis to the same degree as the
      group originally randomized to clozapine in the double-blind study. Both groups
      maintained their response to week 16 (end of the combined double-blind and open
      label portions). There was no worsening of motor features as measured by the
      Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale. Eighteen patients were either
      hospitalized or died during the trial. The most common reasons were pulmonary.
      CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose clozapine is effective in treating drug-induced psychosis
      without worsening motor features of PD, and the response is maintained for at
      least 4 months. Patients with psychosis and PD were previously described as a
      group with high risk for morbidity and mortality. The high risk continues despite
      antipsychotic therapy.

TI  - Testing the ability of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder to 
      accurately report the effects of medication on their behavior.
PG  - 593-610
AB  - Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are often treated
      with central nervous system stimulants, making the evaluation of medication
      effects an important topic for applied behavior analysts. Because assessment
      protocols emphasize informant reports and direct observations of child behavior, 
      little is known about the extent to which children themselves can accurately
      report medication effects. Double-blind placebo-controlled procedures were used
      to examine whether 6 children with ADHD could recognize the effects of their
      medication. The children were given math worksheets to complete for 15 min during
      each of 14 sessions while on medication and placebo. Children completed a
      self-evaluation form at the end of each session, and ratings were compared to
      observed behavior and academic performance. Results indicated that 3 children
      were able to accurately report their medication status at levels greater than
      chance, whereas the accuracy of reports by all children was related to dosage
      level, differences in behavior, and the presence of adverse effects. The
      implications of these results for placebo-controlled research, self-monitoring of
      dosage levels, and accuracy training are discussed.

TI  - Effects of methylphenidate on sensitivity to reinforcement in children diagnosed 
      with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: an application of the matching
      law.
PG  - 573-91
AB  - The behavior of children diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 
      (ADHD) has been hypothesized to be the result of decreased sensitivity to
      consequences compared to typical children. The present study examined sensitivity
      to reinforcement in 2 boys diagnosed with ADHD using the matching law to provide 
      more precise and quantitative measurement of this construct. This experiment also
      evaluated the effects of methylphenidate (MPH) on sensitivity to reinforcement of
      children with ADHD. Subjects completed math problems to earn tokens under four
      different variable-interval (VI) schedules of reinforcement presented in random
      order under both medicated and nonmedicated conditions. Results showed that, in
      the medicated condition, the matching functions for both subjects resulted in
      higher asymptotic values, indicating an overall elevation of behavior rate under 
      these conditions. The variance accounted for by the matching law was also higher 
      under the medicated conditions, suggesting that their behavior more closely
      tracked the changing rates of reinforcement while taking MPH compared to placebo.
      Under medicated conditions, the reinforcing efficacy of response-contingent
      tokens decreased. Results are discussed with respect to quantifying behavioral
      changes and the extent to which the drug interacts with prevailing contingencies 
      (i.e., schedule values) to influence behavioral variability.

TI  - Intramuscular ziprasidone compared with intramuscular haloperidol in the
      treatment of acute psychosis. Ziprasidone I.M. Study Group.
PG  - 933-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: This 7-day, randomized, open-label, multicenter, international study 
      compared the efficacy and tolerability of intramuscular (i.m.) ziprasidone with
      haloperidol i.m. and the transition from i.m. to oral treatment in hospitalized
      patients with acute psychotic agitation (related to DSM-III-R diagnoses). METHOD:
      Patients received up to 3 days of flexible-dose ziprasidone i.m. (N = 90) or
      haloperidol i.m. (N = 42) followed by oral treatment to day 7. After an initial
      ziprasidone i.m. dose of 10 mg, subsequent i.m. doses of 5 to 20 mg could be
      given every 4 to 6 hours (maximum daily dose = 80 mg) if needed, followed by oral
      ziprasidone, 80-200 mg/day. Haloperidol i.m. doses of 2.5 to 10 mg were given on 
      entry, followed by 2.5 to 10 mg i.m. every 4 to 6 hours (maximum daily dose = 40 
      mg) if needed, then by oral haloperidol, 10-80 mg/day. RESULTS: The mean
      reductions in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) total, BPRS agitation items, 
      and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity scale scores were statistically
      significantly greater (p < .05, p < .01, and p < .01, respectively) after
      ziprasidone i.m. treatment compared with haloperidol i.m. treatment. Further
      reductions in these scores also occurred in both groups following transition to
      oral treatment. Ziprasidone was associated with a lower incidence of movement
      disorders and a reduced requirement for anticholinergic medication during both
      i.m. and oral treatment compared with haloperidol. Movement disorder scale scores
      improved with ziprasidone i.m. and oral treatment, but deteriorated with
      haloperidol. Other adverse events were rare with both treatments. CONCLUSION:
      Ziprasidone i.m. was significantly more effective in reducing the symptoms of
      acute psychosis and was better tolerated than haloperidol i.m., particularly in
      movement disorders. The transition from ziprasidone i.m. to oral ziprasidone was 
      effective and well tolerated.

TI  - Effects of bupropion sustained-release on sexual functioning and nocturnal
      erections in healthy men.
PG  - 99-103
AB  - Many antidepressants are known to cause adverse sexual effects. Bupropion is an
      antidepressant with fewer reported adverse sexual effects. Studies of sexual side
      effects are often confounded by psychiatric and medical conditions affecting
      sexual function. In this study, the effects of bupropion on subjective and
      objective sexual functioning were measured in healthy men. Thirteen men without
      psychiatric or medical illness completed a 2-week, placebo-controlled,
      double-blind, crossover trial of bupropion sustained-release 300 mg/day. Subjects
      had a 1-week washout period between trials. Sexual function was measured using a 
      validated, self-administered questionnaire and the RigiScan, an instrument
      measuring nocturnal penile tumescence and rigidity. No differences were found in 
      self-reported sexual function, number of erections, total erection time, or
      penile rigidity in subjects taking bupropion compared with those taking placebo
      or baseline. These findings support that bupropion does not have subjective
      adverse sexual side effects and does not affect nocturnal erections in healthy
      men.

TI  - A preliminary study of bupropion sustained-release for smoking cessation in
      patients with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder.
PG  - 94-8
AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of bupropion sustained-release
      (SR) on smoking cessation in patients with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder 
      (PTSD). Fifteen veterans with chronic PTSD who desired to stop smoking enrolled
      in a 12-week double-blind evaluation of bupropion SR and placebo. Patients were
      randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either bupropion SR or placebo.
      Bupropion SR was initiated at 150 mg daily for 3 or 4 days and increased to a
      final dose of 150 mg twice daily (300 mg daily total). Ten patients received
      bupropion SR and five received placebo. Nine of the patients who received
      bupropion SR were already being treated with at least one other psychotropic
      medication. One of the ten patients did not complete the study because of
      medication side effects. Eighty percent of patients receiving bupropion SR
      successfully stopped smoking by the end of week 2, and 6 (60%) of these 10
      maintained smoking cessation at the study endpoint (week 12). At the 6-month
      follow-up, 40% of the patients (4 of 10) who received bupropion SR maintained
      smoking cessation. One (20%) of the five patients who received placebo stopped
      smoking and maintained smoking cessation at the 6-month follow-up. Bupropion SR
      was generally well-tolerated in combination with other psychotropic medications. 
      Bupropion SR may be effective in helping patients who desire to quit smoking and 
      who also have a concomitant anxiety disorder, such as PTSD.

TI  - The effects of concomitant phenytoin administration on the steady-state
      pharmacokinetics of quetiapine.
PG  - 89-93
AB  - Quetiapine fumarate ('Seroquel') is a newly introduced atypical antipsychotic
      with demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of positive and negative symptoms of 
      schizophrenia. It is extensively metabolized, predominantly by cytochrome P450
      3A4. Therefore, concurrent administration of drugs that induce or inhibit this
      enzyme may affect quetiapine pharmacokinetics. This study demonstrated that the
      potent cytochrome P450 enzyme-inducer phenytoin did indeed have a marked effect
      on the metabolism of quetiapine, resulting in a 5-fold increase in clearance when
      administered concomitantly to patients with DSM-IV-diagnosed schizophrenia,
      schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder. These results indicate that dosage
      adjustment of quetiapine may be necessary when the two drugs are given
      concurrently and that caution may be required when administering other drugs that
      inhibit or induce cytochromes, particularly P450 3A4.

TI  - Ziprasidone in the short-term treatment of patients with schizoaffective
      disorder: results from two double- blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter
      studies.
PG  - 27-35
AB  - This study assessed the efficacy of ziprasidone for the treatment of
      schizoaffective disorder. Data were taken from subsets of patients with
      schizoaffective disorder, derived from two separate double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter studies. A total of 115
      hospitalized patients with an acute episode of schizoaffective disorder were
      randomly assigned to receive either fixed oral doses of ziprasidone 40 mg/day (N 
      = 16), 80 mg/day (N = 18), 120 mg/day (N = 22), 160 mg/day (N = 25), or placebo
      (N = 34) for 4 to 6 weeks. Mean baseline-to-endpoint changes in Brief Psychiatric
      Rating Scale (BPRS) total, BPRS Core, Clinical Global Impressions Severity scale 
      (CGI-S), BPRS Depressive, BPRS Manic, and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating
      Scale total scores were compared between the placebo and ziprasidone groups.
      Neurological (Simpson-Angus, Barnes Akathisia, Abnormal Involuntary Movement
      Scale [AIMS]) and other side effects were also assessed. Significant dose-related
      improvements on all primary efficacy variables (BPRS total, BPRS Core, CGI-S) and
      for BPRS Manic items were observed with ziprasidone treatment in a combined
      analysis of data from both studies (p < or = 0.01). Ziprasidone 160 mg/day was
      significantly more effective than placebo in improving mean BPRS total, BPRS
      Core, BPRS Manic, and CGI-S scores (p < 0.05). At 120 mg/day, ziprasidone was
      significantly more effective than placebo in improving mean CGI-S scores (p <
      0.05). The incidence of individual adverse events was generally low in all
      treatment groups and was not dose-related. In addition, no significant
      differences were observed between baseline-to-endpoint mean changes in
      Simpson-Angus and AIMS scores with placebo or ziprasidone 40 to 160 mg/day. These
      results suggest that ziprasidone may have efficacy in the treatment of affective 
      as well as psychotic symptoms of schizoaffective disorder, with a low side-effect
      burden.

TI  - Refractory schizophrenia and atypical antipsychotics.
PG  - 409-18
AB  - Treatment resistant or refractory schizophrenia is a difficult to define
      condition of largely unknown prevalence. For 10 years, clozapine has been the
      standard treatment in this condition and is recognized unequivocally as being
      effective. However, clozapine is sometimes poorly tolerated and has the potential
      for severe toxicity. Partly as a result of this, other atypicals have recently
      been evaluated as treatments for refractory schizophrenia. In order to evaluate
      the evidence base relating to the drug treatment of refractory schizophrenia, we 
      developed a refractoriness rating based on previous work. Using this rating, we
      assessed all trials of atypicals in schizophrenia unresponsive to at least one
      drug. Overall, clozapine was consistently shown to be effective in refractory
      schizophrenia, even when stringently defined. Data relating to olanzapine and
      risperidone are equivocal at best, and there is some evidence to suggest that
      they are less effective than clozapine. There is essentially no cogent evidence
      to support the use of any other atypical in refractory schizophrenia. Clozapine
      remains the drug of choice in this condition.

TI  - Clinical trials. Planned Ritalin trial for tots heads into uncharted waters.
PG  - 1280-2
AB  - U.S. scientists are gearing up for a major clinical trial intended to measure the
      effects of a popular but controversial drug used to treat attention deficit
      hyperactivity disorder, methylphenidate (Ritalin), on a previously untested
      population--children aged 3 to 6. But in doing so, they are running up against
      ethical concerns about using young subjects in clinical trials. The scientists
      involved in the study admit that they are concerned about the drug's effect on
      the children's still-developing personalities and brains, as well as their
      inability to give informed consent. But they believe that such trials are the
      only way to answer concerns about rising use of the drug among this population.

TI  - Double-blind comparison of olanzapine versus clozapine in schizophrenic patients 
      clinically eligible for treatment with clozapine.
PG  - 52-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: The treatment of schizophrenic patients who fail to respond to
      adequate trials of neuroleptic drugs is a major challenge. Clozapine has been one
      treatment option; however, it is not universally effective and is limited in its 
      use by safety concerns. With the introduction of newer agents, their performance 
      relative to clozapine is of great clinical interest. METHODS: The primary
      objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of olanzapine
      versus clozapine among treatment resistant DSM-IV schizophrenic patients. The
      study was primarily designed to demonstrate the "noninferiority" of olanzapine
      compared to clozapine after 18 weeks of double-blind treatment. Conclusions were 
      based on the one-sided lower 95% confidence limit about the treatment effect
      observed from the primary efficacy variable (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale
      [PANSS] Total). RESULTS: Mean changes from baseline to end point in PANSS Total
      score, using a last observation carried forward technique, showed that both
      agents were comparably effective in neuroleptic resistant patients, i.e.,
      demonstrated the "noninferiority" of olanzapine when compared to clozapine.
      Overall, significantly fewer olanzapine-treated patients (4%) discontinued for an
      adverse event than their clozapine-treated (14%) counterparts (p =.022). Among
      spontaneously reported adverse events, increased salivation, constipation,
      dizziness, and nausea were reported significantly more often among
      clozapine-treated patients, whereas only dry mouth was reported more often among 
      olanzapine-treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Olanzapine was demonstrated to be
      noninferior to clozapine and better tolerated among resistant schizophrenic
      patients clinically eligible for treatment with clozapine.

TI  - Clozapine-induced agranulocytosis and hereditary polymorphisms of clozapine
      metabolizing enzymes: no association with myeloperoxidase and cytochrome P4502D6.
PG  - 218-20
AB  - The pathomechanisms of most drug-induced agranulocytoses are unclear; however,
      there are some studies pointing to genetic determinants. Some drug-induced
      agranulocytoses such as clozapine-induced agranulocytosis (CA) may be regarded as
      an idiosyncratic drug reaction because of its preclinical and clinical
      characteristics. To study some aspects of the genetic background of CA further,
      polymorphisms of specific metabolizing enzyme systems of clozapine were examined.
      Thirty-one schizophrenic patients with CA and 77 schizophrenic comparison
      subjects without this adverse effect underwent genotyping of a recently
      discovered G(-463)A polymorphism of myeloperoxidase (MPO) gene and cytochrome
      P4502D6. Neither the MPO mutation nor specific genotypes of cytochrome P4502D6
      were associated with CA. Both were equally distributed among CA patients and
      controls. Thus, our data suggest lack of evidence of an association of CA and
      genetically variable activity of these specific drug metabolizing enzymes;
      however, this may be due to statistical reasons only. Thus, further studies with 
      greater CA samples are necessary to draw final conclusions about these
      genetically based hypotheses.

TI  - Impact of risperidone on seclusion and restraint at a state psychiatric hospital.
PG  - 827-32
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of risperidone on seclusion and restraint in
      patients at a state psychiatric facility, shortly after risperidone's release.
      METHODS: Patients who were in the hospital for at least 3 months prior to
      receiving risperidone and subsequently received risperidone for at least 3 months
      formed the cohort. A mirror-image design was used with duration to a maximum of 1
      year before and 1 year after initiation of risperidone. The hospital population
      that did not receive either risperidone or clozapine during the same time period 
      was used for comparison of trends of seclusion and restraint. RESULTS:
      Seventy-four patients (most with schizophrenia) met the inclusion criteria of the
      risperidone group. There were statistically significant decreases in the number
      of seclusion hours (2.2 [SD 5.5] to 0.26 [SD 0.06]) and of events (0.23 [SD 0.59]
      to 0.05 [SD 0.14]) per person per month during risperidone treatment, compared
      with the prerisperidone treatment period (P = 0.01). The comparison group also
      evidenced decreases on these measures during the same time period, but the
      risperidone-treated cohort achieved a proportionally greater reduction. There
      were similar trends toward reduction in the restraint measures during risperidone
      treatment compared with prerisperidone, but these did not achieve statistical
      significance. The comparison group also showed slightly decreased use of
      restraints over the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Risperidone appears to have had a 
      positive impact on seclusion in this state-hospital psychiatric population. These
      data support the positive impact of risperidone on violence found in other
      studies. Violence and aggression are major factors that affect morale among
      psychiatric patients and staff. So, any benefit in this regard as a result of
      antipsychotic drug treatment is salutary for patients, families, and health care 
      providers.

TI  - Managing ADHD in general practice. N of 1 trials can help!
PG  - 1205-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To pilot single patient trials designed to improve decision making
      about stimulant use for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in
      general practice. METHOD: Patients previously stabilised on dexamphetamine were
      enrolled from a general practice. Each undertook a six week same patient
      randomised, double blind, placebo controlled crossover comparison of
      dexamphetamine with placebo for ADHD. Rating scales were completed weekly by
      self, parent and teacher. RESULTS: Three of the four patients were clear
      responders to dexamphetamine (including a noncompleter, as his results still
      demonstrated a clear response). The results were clinically useful in each case. 
      Management was confirmed for three patients and changed for one (who ceased
      dexamphetamine). DISCUSSION: Prescribing stimulant medications only to children
      with diagnosed ADHD and who are found to respond, limits use of these worrisome
      drugs to those who will respond, and minimises their use in those who will not
      benefit.

TI  - A novel augmentation strategy for treating resistant major depression.
PG  - 131-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Treatment-resistant depression is a significant public health concern;
      drug switching or augmentation often produce limited results. The authors
      hypothesized that fluoxetine could be augmented with olanzapine to successfully
      treat resistant depression. METHOD: An 8-week double-blind study was conducted
      with 28 patients who were diagnosed with recurrent, nonbipolar,
      treatment-resistant depression without psychotic features. Subjects were randomly
      assigned to one of three groups: olanzapine plus placebo, fluoxetine plus
      placebo, or olanzapine plus fluoxetine. RESULTS: Fluoxetine monotherapy produced 
      minimal improvement on various scales that rate severity of depression. The
      benefits of olanzapine monotherapy were modest. Olanzapine plus fluoxetine
      produced significantly greater improvement than either monotherapy on one measure
      and significantly greater improvement than olanzapine monotherapy on the other
      measures after 1 week. There were no significant differences between treatment
      groups on extrapyramidal measures nor significant adverse drug interactions.
      CONCLUSIONS: Olanzapine plus fluoxetine demonstrated superior efficacy for
      treating resistant depression compared to either agent alone.

TI  - A comparison between meperidine, clonidine and urapidil in the treatment of
      postanesthetic shivering.
PG  - 257-60
AB  - Postanesthetic shivering can be treated with many types of drugs. We compared the
      effects of meperidine, clonidine, and urapidil on postanesthetic shivering. Sixty
      patients shivering during recovery from general anesthesia were treated in a
      randomized, double-blinded fashion with 25 mg meperidine IV, 0.15 mg clonidine
      IV, or 25 mg urapidil IV in three separate groups of 20 patients each. If
      shivering did not stop within 5 min, the treatment was repeated once; clonidine
      was replaced with saline for the second dose. Rectal temperature, arterial blood 
      pressure, heart rate, SaO(2) and vigilance were monitored. Clonidine stopped
      shivering in all 20 patients. A single dose of meperidine stopped the shivering
      in 18 of 20 patients, with the other 2 patients needing a second dose. Urapidil
      was less effective: the first dose stopped the shivering in only six patients;
      the second dose was effective in another six; the drug was ineffective in 8 of 20
      patients. Meperidine and clonidine were both nearly 100% effective in treating
      postanesthetic shivering without negative side effects. By comparison, urapidil
      was only effective in 60% of patients treated (P <0.01). Implications: Patients
      shivering during recovery from general anesthesia were treated in a randomized
      double-blinded fashion with meperidine, clonidine, or urapidil. Meperidine and
      clonidine were both very effective, whereas urapidil was only effective in 60% of
      patients treated.

TI  - Clonidine combined with a long acting local anesthetic does not prolong
      postoperative analgesia after brachial plexus block but does induce hemodynamic
      changes.
PG  - 199-204
AB  - Clonidine in brachial plexus block prolongs analgesia of local anesthetics of
      short and intermediate duration. We performed a prospective randomized
      double-blinded study to determine the efficacy and adverse effects of clonidine
      mixed with a long-acting local anesthetic on postoperative analgesia. Sixty adult
      patients underwent elective rotator cuff repair using interscalene brachial
      plexus block combined with general anesthesia and were randomly divided into one 
      of the following three groups. Placebo (n = 20): interscalene block with 40 mL of
      0.5% bupivacaine with epinephrine (1/200000) and 1 mL of 0.9% saline, completed
      by 1 mL of 0.9% saline IM in the controlateral shoulder; Control (n = 20):
      interscalene block with 40 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine with epinephrine and 1 mL of 0.
      9% saline, completed by 150 microg (=1 mL) of clonidine IM; Clonidine (n = 20):
      interscalene block with 40 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine with epinephrine and 150 microg
      (=1 mL) of clonidine, completed by 1 mL of 0.9% saline IM. During anesthesia
      hemodynamic variables and fractional expired isoflurane concentration (FeISO)
      were recorded. The following postoperative variables were assessed: duration of
      interscalene block, quality of pain relief on a visual analog scale, side
      effects, and consumption of morphine with a patient-controlled analgesia device
      over 48 h. Patient characteristics were comparable. During anesthesia mean
      arterial pressure, heart rate, and FeISO were significantly decreased in
      Clonidine and Control groups compared with Placebo group. Duration of analgesia, 
      defined as the time elapsed from interscalene injection to the first morphine
      request, was 983 +/- 489 min in the Placebo, 909 +/- 160 min in the Control, and 
      829 +/- 159 min in the Clonidine groups. Pain scores and consumption of morphine 
      at 24 h and 48 h showed no differences among the three groups. We conclude that
      adding 150 microg of clonidine in interscalene block does not prolong analgesia
      induced by 40 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% with epinephrine, but decreases mean
      arterial blood pressure and heart rate. Implications: Clonidine in brachial
      plexus block does not improve postoperative analgesia when mixed with a
      long-lasting anesthetic. Nevertheless, with or without clonidine, bupivacaine in 
      interscalene block provides a long-lasting analgesia of approximately 15 h.

TI  - A comparison of oral clonidine and oral midazolam as preanesthetic medications in
      the pediatric tonsillectomy patient.
PG  - 56-61
AB  - We compared the effects of oral clonidine (4 microg/kg) and midazolam (0.5 mg/kg)
      on the preanesthetic sedation and postoperative recovery profile in children
      during tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy. In a double-blinded,
      double-dummy study design, 134 ASA physical status I-II children aged 4-12 yr
      were randomized to receive a combination of either clonidine and placebo (Group
      A), or placebo and midazolam (Group B) at 60-90 min and 30 min, respectively,
      before the induction of anesthesia. Children in the clonidine group exhibited
      more intense anxiety on separation and during induction of anesthesia via a mask 
      as measured by the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scores. They also had
      significantly lower mean intraoperative arterial blood pressures, shorter
      surgery, anesthesia, and emergence times, and a decreased need for supplemental
      oxygen during recovery compared with the midazolam group. However, the clonidine 
      group had larger postoperative opioid requirements, maximum excitement and pain
      scores based on the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario scale in the Phase 1
      postanesthetic care unit. There were no differences between the two groups in the
      times to discharge readiness, postoperative emesis, unanticipated hospital
      admission rates, postdischarge maximum pain scores, and 24 h analgesic
      requirements. The percentage of parents who were completely satisfied with the
      child's preoperative experience was significantly higher in the midazolam group. 
      There were no differences in parental satisfaction with the recovery period. We
      conclude that under the conditions of this study, oral midazolam is superior to
      oral clonidine as a preanesthetic medication in this patient population.
      Implications: We compared preanesthetic sedation and postoperative recovery after
      oral clonidine (4 microg/kg) and midazolam (0.5 mg/kg) in children during
      tonsillectomy. The clonidine group had greater preoperative anxiety and shorter
      surgery and anesthesia times, but required more postoperative analgesia. Delayed 
      recovery and discharge times did not differ. Midazolam was superior to clonidine 
      as oral preanesthetic medication for these patients.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of steady-state bupropion SR
      sustained-release (BUP) on the pharmacokinetics of a single 100-mg dose of
      lamotrigine (LTG). DESIGN: Randomized, open-label, two-way crossover study
      SETTING: Clinical Studies Ltd., Fort Lauderdale, Florida. PATIENTS: Twelve
      healthy subjects. INTERVENTION: Treatment A: LTG 100 mg with steady-state BUP 150
      mg twice/day; treatment B: LTG 100 mg. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The
      pharmacokinetics of LTG were determined by noncompartmental methods using plasma 
      and urine concentrations. Geometric least squares mean ratios and 90% confidence 
      intervals were calculated for treatment comparison. Safety assessments included
      clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and adverse events monitoring.
      Pharmacokinetic parameters of LTG were not significantly different between
      treatments. Five subjects experienced seven mild, potentially drug-related
      adverse events (insomnia [2]; nausea, headache, facial pain, fatigue, and
      depression [1 each]) that resolved spontaneously. CONCLUSION: Steady-state BUP
      caused no clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of
      LTG.

TI  - Depression in children and adolescents.
PG  - 2297-308, 2311-2
AB  - Depression among children and adolescents is common but frequently unrecognized. 
      It affects 2 percent of prepubertal children and 5 to 8 percent of adolescents.
      The clinical spectrum of the disease can range from simple sadness to a major
      depressive or bipolar disorder. Risk factors include a family history of
      depression and poor school performance. Evaluation should include a complete
      medical assessment to rule out underlying medical causes. A structured clinical
      interview and various rating scales such as the Pediatric Symptom Checklist are
      helpful in determining whether a child or adolescent is depressed. Evidence-based
      treatment guidelines from the literature are limited. Psychotherapy appears to be
      useful in most children and adolescents with mild to moderate depression.
      Tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are medical
      therapies that have been studied on a limited basis. The latter agents are better
      tolerated but not necessarily more efficacious. Because the risk of school
      failure and suicide is quite high in depressed children and adolescents, prompt
      referral or close collaboration with a mental health professional is often
      necessary.

TI  - Risperidone versus haloperidol in psychotic patients with disturbing
      neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal symptoms: a double-blind, multi-center trial.
PG  - 97-105
AB  - BACKGROUND: A randomized, double-blind, multi-center trial was started to compare
      the severity of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) during risperidone and haloperidol 
      treatment in schizophrenic patients who had disturbing EPS during their previous 
      neuroleptic treatment. Additional objectives of this trial were comparing the
      antipsychotic effectiveness of the two treatments and the use of antiparkinsonian
      medication. METHODS: Effects of flexible doses of risperidone and haloperidol
      were compared in 77 psychotic patients (83% with chronic schizophrenia) with
      disturbing neuroleptic-induced EPS (risperidone 40 patients, haloperidol 37). The
      trial was completed by 47 patients: 25 in the risperidone group (12 women, 13
      men), and 22 in the haloperidol group (10 women, 12 men). RESULTS: An adequate
      antipsychotic effect was obtained in most patients by both treatments. The
      primary aim of this trial was comparing parkinsonism measured with the
      extrapyramidal syndrome rating scale (ESRS) during treatment with risperidone and
      haloperidol. Two primary parameters were selected: the change from baseline to
      the worst score during treatment of ESRS II (parkinsonism) and ESRS VI (clinical 
      global impression of severity of parkinsonism). The CGI of severity of
      parkinsonism was better with risperidone (P=0.025), while the parkinsonism total 
      score tended to be better with risperidone (P<0. 10). Before the double-blind
      treatment, 34 (of the 77) had used antiparkinson medication (risperidone 18,
      haloperidol 16). During the double-blind treatment phase, 21 patients had used
      antiparkinson medication (risperidone 11, haloperidol 10). The larger reduction
      of parkinsonism in the risperidone group was not due to a difference in the use
      of anti-parkinsonian medication. CONCLUSIONS: In this group of schizophrenic
      patients with disturbing EPS during previous neuroleptic treatment, a stronger
      reduction of parkinsonism was observed with risperidone than with haloperidol.

TI  - Randomised fellow eye comparison of the effectiveness of dorzolamide and
      apraclonidine on intraocular pressure following phacoemulsification cataract
      surgery.
PG  - 757-60
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the effectiveness of 2% dorzolamide and 0.5% apraclonidine on
      intraocular pressure (IOP) following phacoemulsification cataract surgery.
      METHODS: This prospective, randomised study comprised 54 eyes of 27 consecutive
      patients with age-related cataract scheduled for cataract surgery in both eyes.
      In each patient the eye with the higher degree of cataract was randomly assigned 
      to receive one drop of either dorzolamide or apraclonidine immediately after
      surgery. The fellow eye was operated on later and received the other treatment.
      Cataract surgery was performed with a superior 6.0 mm sutureless frown incision, 
      phacoemulsification and implantation of a three-piece PMMA intraocular lens. The 
      IOP was measured pre-operatively as well as 6 h and 20-24 h and 1 week
      post-operatively. RESULTS: The mean pre-operative IOP was not significantly
      different between the groups (dorzolamide group, 14.9 +/- 2.3 mmHg; apraclonidine
      group, 14.6 +/- 2.5 mmHg; p = 0.450). At 6 h post-operatively, the mean IOP was
      significantly lower in the dorzolamide than in the apraclonidine group (15.6 +/- 
      3.9 mmHg vs 18.0 +/- 4.0 mmHg; p < 0.001). An IOP increase of more than 5 mmHg at
      6 h post-operatively occurred in 3 (12%) eyes in the dorzolamide group and in 9
      (36%) eyes in the apraclonidine group (p = 0.034). At 20-24 h post-operatively
      and at 1 week post-operatively no difference was found between the groups.
      CONCLUSIONS: 2% Dorzolamide is more effective than 0.5% apraclonidine in
      preventing the early post-operative IOP increase following phacoemulsification
      cataract surgery.

TI  - Augmentation with sulpiride for a schizophrenic patient partially responsive to
      clozapine.
PG  - 390-3; discussion 393-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Schizophrenic patients who are only partially responsive to clozapine 
      pose a therapeutic challenge. In these circumstances some clinicians would
      consider adding in a second antipsychotic. We present a case report and review
      evidence for the efficacy of such augmentation strategies. METHOD: Single case
      report and literature review. RESULTS: The total number of patients in studies
      and case reports of combining clozapine with other antipsychotics is small. There
      has been only one randomized controlled trial. This found the addition of
      sulpiride to clozapine resulted in clinical improvement in some patients.
      CONCLUSION: Further randomized controlled studies of augmentation of clozapine
      therapy are needed to provide scientific justification for this clinical
      practice.

TI  - Low-dose oral clonidine as premedication before intraocular surgery in
      retrobulbar anesthesia.
PG  - 248-56
AB  - PURPOSE: We investigated whether low-dosed oral clonidine premedication before
      elective intraocular surgery in retrobulbar anesthesia is effective in terms of
      anxiolysis, sedation, stable hemodynamics, lower intraocular pressure and
      perioperative endocrine stress response. METHODS: In a prospective, randomised,
      double-blind study, 44 patients scheduled for elective intraocular surgery
      received either 0.15 mg clonidine (n=22) or a matched placebo (n=22) orally 60
      minutes before retrobulbar anesthesia. The main study parameters were sedation,
      anxiolysis, hemodynamics and intraocular pressure. Additionally, mediators of
      endocrine stress responses were measured five times, in 13 patients after
      clonidine and 12 after placebo. RESULTS: After clonidine 86% of the patients
      showed sedation and after placebo 90.9% showed no sedation (p<0.01). Clonidine
      produced effective anxiolysis (Erlanger-Anxiety-Scale: 31.6 +/- 2.6 points vs.
      38.1 +/- 8.5 points) before the operation (p<0.01). Systolic blood pressure was
      significantly lower after clonidine. Effects on mean and diastolic blood pressure
      were small but statistically significant. Norepinephrine and cortisol plasma
      concentrations were significantly lower after clonidine. Intraocular pressure was
      significantly lower too (p<0.05). No clinically relevant adverse effects were
      observed e.g. inappropriate sedation, hypotension (<100 mmHg), bradycardia (<50
      bpm) or hypoxemia (SpO2<90%). CONCLUSIONS: Oral low-dose clonidine produces light
      sedation, significant anxiolysis and stable hemodynamics, and attenuates the
      endocrine response to perioperative stress. Thus, clonidine seems sufficient to
      increase patient comfort for intraocular surgery and might even offer clinically 
      worthwhile benefits such as stable hemodynamics and a reduced response to
      perioperative stress.

TI  - Dose-proportional and stereospecific pharmacokinetics of methylphenidate
      delivered using an osmotic, controlled-release oral delivery system.
PG  - 1141-9
AB  - Methylphenidate hydrochloride (HCl) is frequently used for the treatment of
      attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A study was conducted in healthy
      subjects to evaluate the dose-ranging pharmacokinetics of 18, 36, and 54 mg
      methylphenidate HCl delivered using an oral, osmotic, controlled-release
      formulation (OROS). Plasma concentrations of l-methylphenidate were 40-fold lower
      than those of d-methylphenidate, whereas plasma concentrations of
      d-alpha-phenyl-2-piperidine acetic acid (d-PPA) and l-PPA, the major metabolite
      of methylphenidate, were comparable. Mean AUCinf values for d-methylphenidate
      were 42.2, 80.9, and 120 ng.h/mL for the 18, 36, and 54 mg doses, respectively,
      increasing dose proportionally. AUCinf values for l-methylphenidate were only
      approximately 1% of d-methylphenidate (0.43, 0.96, and 1.82 ng.h/mL for the 18,
      36, and 54 mg dose groups, respectively). In contrast, AUCinf values of d- and
      l-PPA were comparable. The dose-normalized d- and l-methylphenidate plasma
      concentration-time profiles for the three treatment groups were superimposable.
      Similarly, dose-normalized plasma concentrations of d- and l-PPA were
      superimposable. Methylphenidate metabolism, measured as the ratio of
      d-methylphenidate AUCinf to d-PPA AUCinf and as l-methylphenidate AUCinf to l-PPA
      AUCinf, was similar for the three dose groups, indicating that methylphenidate
      metabolism was not affected by increasing dose. OROS (methylphenidate HCl)
      exhibits dose-proportional and linear pharmacokinetics.

TI  - Low-dose intrathecal clonidine combined with sufentanil as analgesic drugs in
      abdominal gynecological surgery.
PG  - 357-62
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine whether a low dose of spinal clonidine either
      alone or combined with sufentanil would provide effective analgesia following
      abdominal surgery, as a supplement to bupivacaine spinal anesthesia. DESIGN:
      Randomized double-blind study. SETTING: Gynecological surgery, teaching hospital.
      PATIENTS: 73 ASA physical status I and II patients undergoing gynecological
      abdominal surgery with spinal anesthesia. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly
      assigned to one of four groups and prospectively studied to examine anesthesia,
      analgesia, and adverse effects. The control group received saline as the test
      drug; the sufentanil group received 10 microg of sufentanil; the clonidine group 
      received 30 microg of clonidine; and the sufentanil/clonidine group received 5
      microg of sufentanil plus 15 microg of clonidine. All groups received intrathecal
      15 mg of bupivacaine (3 mL) plus the intrathecal test drug (2 mL). The concept of
      visual analog scale (VAS) was introduced. All patients were premedicated with
      intravenous midazolam. Rescue analgesics were available. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN
      RESULTS: The groups were demographically the same. Sensory block to pinprick at
      10 min was higher for clonidine and sufentanil/clonidine groups compared to the
      control group (p < 0.02). Anesthetic time (Bromage score 2) was also longer for
      clonidine and sufentanil/clonidine groups compared to the control and sufentanil 
      groups (p < 0.05). Time to first rescue analgesics was shorter in the control
      group compared to the other groups (p < 0.02). The number of IM diclofenac dose
      injections in 24 hours was higher in the control group compared to all other
      groups (p < 0.05). The incidence of adverse effects and ephedrine consumption
      were similar among groups. CONCLUSIONS: Intrathecal 15- and 30-microg clonidine
      doses expanded the anesthesia sensory block and duration of motor block, and
      provided analgesia.

PG  - 343-9
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether a single preoperative IV dose of
      clonidine blunts the hemodynamic and hyperadrenergic responses not only to
      intubation, but also to extubation. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study. PATIENTS: 29 ASA physical status I and II patients
      (ages 18-65) who were scheduled for noncardiac, elective surgery. Patients were
      randomly assigned to either receive clonidine 3 microg/kg IV immediately before
      anesthesia induction or placebo. INTERVENTIONS: Insertion of a 14 G cannula in a 
      large cubital vein for the determination of plasma catecholamines using local
      anesthesia. Insertion of a radial artery catheter for measuring blood pressure
      (BP) using local anesthesia. Transthoracic echocardiography to determine cardiac 
      output (CO). MEASUREMENTS: Heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), CO, and
      plasma catecholamine concentrations. Measurements were performed: before
      induction (baseline), during intubation, 10 min after intubation, after surgery, 
      during extubation, and 10 min after extubation. MAIN RESULTS: During intubation
      MAP, HR, and CO were lower in the clonidine group. Compared with baseline
      measurements, MAP and CO increased less in the clonidine group during intubation.
      During extubation, MAP was lower in the clonidine group. CO and MAP increased
      less as compared with baseline measurements in the clonidine group. Compared with
      the measurements after surgery CO less in the clonidine group during extubation
      (p < 0.05 for all results). CONCLUSIONS: A single preoperative IV dose of
      clonidine (3 microg/kg) blunts the hemodynamic responses due to extubation in
      noncardiac surgery of intermediate duration.

      anesthesia and for postoperative pain relief in children. In anesthetized
      children, epinephrine and isoproterenol are reliable indicators to detect
      accidental intravascular injection of a test dose. Oral clonidine, a useful
      premedicant in pediatric anesthesia, modifies hemodynamic responses to
      sympathomimetics, including catecholamines. The aim of the current study was to
      determine whether oral clonidine premedication alters the efficacy of a simulated
      intravascular test dose containing epinephrine or isoproterenol in
      sevoflurane-anesthetized children. METHODS: One hundred twenty children (aged 1-7
      yr) were randomly divided into six groups; control-saline, control-epinephrine,
      control-isoproterenol, clonidine-saline, clonidine-epinephrine, and
      clonidine-isoproterenol. The three clonidine groups received oral clonidine 4
      microg/kg [DOSAGE ERROR CORRECTED] as premedication, whereas the three control
      groups did not receive any premedication. Anesthesia was maintained with
      sevoflurane at a level of 1.2 minimum alveolar concentration. After hemodynamics 
      were stable, 0.1 ml/kg of 1% lidocaine containing epinephrine 0.5 mg/kg or
      isoproterenol 75 ng/kg was intravenously given to the two epinephrine or
      isoproterenol groups, respectively, to simulate intravascular injection of a test
      dose. The saline groups received saline alone instead of the test dose. Heart
      rate, blood pressure, and T-wave amplitude of electrocardiogram were recorded
      before and after administration of study drugs for subsequent analysis. RESULTS: 
      Test solution containing epinephrine increased heart rate, systolic blood
      pressure, and T-wave amplitude. Oral clonidine had no effect on elevation of
      these variables in response to epinephrine. The isoproterenol-containing test
      dose produced a prominent increase in heart rate and a less pronounced increase
      in systolic blood pressure and T-wave amplitude. Oral clonidine also failed to
      modify isoproterenol-induced hemodynamic and T-wave changes. Calculated
      sensitivity and specificity of epinephrine or isoproterenol were all 100% based
      on a new heart rate criterion (positive if >/= 10 beats/min) and were unaltered
      by oral clonidine premedication. CONCLUSIONS: Epinephrine or isoproterenol is a
      reliable marker to detect accidental intravascular injection of a test dose with 
      100% sensitivity and specificity based on a new heart rate criterion in
      sevoflurane-anesthetized children. These data suggest that oral clonidine
      premedication does not alter the efficacy of a simulated epidural test dose
      containing epinephrine or isoproterenol.

TI  - Bipolar disorder therapeutics: maintenance treatment.
PG  - 573-81
AB  - Although most of the care received by bipolar patients occurs during the
      maintenance phase, relatively little empirical data is available to guide
      long-term treatment decisions. We review literature pertaining to key questions
      related to use of pharmacotherapy in the maintenance phase of bipolar disorder.
      The few double-blind trials with a reasonable sample size are restricted to
      bipolar I patients and address a modest range of questions mostly related to use 
      of lithium. One rigorous multicenter trial found valproate to have prophylactic
      benefit. Other studies with valproate alone and in combination suggest efficacy
      equivalent to lithium and perhaps greater than carbamazepine. Data available for 
      combination treatment are sparse but moderately encouraging. Maintenance
      treatment with standard antidepressant medications appears destabilizing for some
      bipolar patients, particularly following a mixed episode. Although some bipolar
      patients may benefit from combined treatment with a mood stabilizer and a
      standard antidepressant medication, current knowledge does not allow confident
      selection of the bipolar patients who might benefit. Clozapine and perhaps other 
      atypical antipsychotics are promising options for maintenance treatment but have 
      not been evaluated in double-blind trials. The numerous other agents used in
      maintenance treatment are primarily adjuncts to lithium, valproate, or
      carbamazepine, and information about them is largely anecdotal and uncontrolled. 
      Study design for maintenance trials remains an imperfect art. Conclusions must be
      drawn cautiously, given the limited generalizability of study designs that
      accession samples enriched with presumed treatment responders, randomize patients
      after brief periods of partial remission, abruptly taper prior treatment, make no
      attempt to distinguish relapse from recurrence, use no formal outcome
      assessments, or report hospitalization as the only outcome criterion.

TI  - Low-dose olanzapine for levodopa induced dyskinesias.
PG  - 795-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the usefulness of low-dose olanzapine (2.5 to 7. 5 mg/day)
      for Levodopa-induced-dyskinesias (LID) in patients with PD. METHODS: Ten patients
      with PD and LID took part in this randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind,
      crossover trial. Patients received a 2-week course of olanzapine or placebo in
      each treatment phase with 1-week washout in between. Dyskinesias were assessed at
      baseline and after each treatment period with an acute dopaminergic challenge and
      unified PD rating scale (UPDRS) questionnaires. Patients also kept on/off and
      dyskinesia diaries for the last 3 days prior to each assessment. RESULTS: There
      was a 41% difference in dyskinesia reduction on olanzapine compared to placebo,
      as measured by objective dyskinesia rating scales (mean percentage reduction
      abnormal involuntary movement score: 30% versus -11.2%, p < 0.02). Similar
      differences were demonstrated by patient diaries (mean reduction: 46% versus -2%,
      p < 0.02) and UPDRS items 32 and 33. Compared with placebo, treatment with
      olanzapine resulted in significant increases in 'off' time as measured by patient
      diaries (30% versus 2%) and reported adverse events (1.7 versus 0.1) including
      increased parkinsonism (1.1 versus 0.1) and a nonsignificant reported increase in
      drowsiness. CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose olanzapine is effective in reducing dyskinesias
      in PD, but even at very low doses can result in unacceptable increases in
      parkinsonism and 'off' time.

TI  - Optimal dose of intrathecal clonidine added to sufentanil plus bupivacaine for
      labour analgesia.
PG  - 875-80
AB  - PURPOSE: The combination of intrathecal (IT) 5 microg sufentanil plus 1.25 mg
      bupivacaine is useful for inducing labour analgesia, albeit of short duration and
      slow onset. As a supplementation to this regimen, the effect of IT clonidine on
      the duration of analgesic action was investigated. METHODS: Forty-eight healthy
      parturients were randomly assigned into three groups to receive 0 microg (group
      C0), 15 microg (C15) or 30 microg (C30) of clonidine IT in addition to 5 microg
      sufentanil plus 1.25 mg bupivacaine IT for labour analgesia. The quality of pain 
      relief was assessed on 0-100 visual analogue scale by the author. The occurrence 
      of side effects was also evaluated before the request for additional analgesia.
      RESULTS: Clonidine (C15 and C30), produced a longer duration of analgesia than C0
      (mean 144 +/- sd 27.9, 165 +/- 31.8 vs 111 +/- 21.9 min, P < 0.01). Also, C15 and
      C30 produced a more rapid onset and a higher quality of analgesia than C0, (P <
      0.01). The most cephalad level of sensory block was higher in C30 than C15
      (median T3 vs T4, P < 0.05) but lowest in C0 (median T7 vs T3,T4, P < 0.01). Side
      effects, sedation and hypotension, occurred more frequently in C30 than in either
      C0 or C 15, (9 vs 2,5 and 9 vs 1,3, respectively, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The
      optimal dose of intrathecal clonidine to enhance labour analgesia with the
      current sufentanil-bupivacaine regimen is 15 microg. In view of the side effect
      profile, doses greater than 30 microg clonidine are unlikely to be useful.

TI  - Mazindol treatment of negative symptoms.
PG  - 365-74
AB  - Hypodopaminergic and hyponoradrenergic pathophysiology may be a basis for primary
      and/or secondary negative symptoms in schizophrenia. The hypothesis that enhanced
      neurotransmission in these systems would be therapeutic for negative symptoms was
      tested by comparing mazindol and placebo in a double-blind, cross-over design
      trial. Outcome following mazindol supplementation was comparable to placebo
      supplementation (F(1,30) = 0.9; p = .57). Results for deficit and non-deficit
      schizophrenia subjects were similar, and were not affected by whether concurrent 
      the antipsychotic drug treatment was clozapine, fluphenazine, or haloperidol. The
      efficacy hypothesis was not supported for either primary or secondary negative
      symptoms.

TI  - Efficacy of olanzapine in acute bipolar mania: a double-blind, placebo-controlled
      study. The Olanzipine HGGW Study Group.
PG  - 841-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: We compared the efficacy and safety of olanzapine vs placebo for the 
      treatment of acute bipolar mania. METHODS: Four-week, randomized, double-blind,
      parallel study. A total of 115 patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar
      disorder, manic or mixed, were randomized to olanzapine, 5 to 20 mg/d (n = 55),
      or placebo (n = 60). The primary efficacy measure was the Young-Mania Rating
      Scale (Y-MRS) total score. Response and euthymia were defined, a priori, as at
      least a 50% improvement from baseline to end point and as a score of no less than
      12 at end point in the Y-MRS total score, respectively. Safety was assessed using
      adverse events, Extrapyramidal Symptom (EPS) rating scales, laboratory values,
      electrocardiograms, vital signs, and weight change. RESULTS: Olanzapine-treated
      patients demonstrated a statistically significant greater mean (+/- SD)
      improvement in Y-MRS total score than placebo-treated patients (-14.8 +/- 12.5
      and -8.1 +/- 12.7, respectively; P<.001), which was evident at the first
      postbaseline observation 1 week after randomization and was maintained throughout
      the study (last observation carried forward). Olanzapine-treated patients
      demonstrated a higher rate of response (65% vs 43%, respectively; P =.02) and
      euthymia (61% vs 36%, respectively; P =. 01) than placebo-treated patients. There
      were no statistically significant differences in EPSs between groups. However,
      olanzapine-treated patients had a statistically significant greater mean (+/- SD)
      weight gain than placebo-treated patients (2.1 +/- 2.8 vs 0.45 +/- 2.3 kg,
      respectively) and also experienced more treatment-emergent somnolence (21
      patients [38.2%] vs 5 [8.3% ], respectively). CONCLUSION: Olanzapine demonstrated
      greater efficacy than placebo in the treatment of acute bipolar mania and was
      generally well tolerated.

TI  - Centrally acting antihypertensive drugs: re-emergence of sympathetic inhibition
      in the treatment of hypertension.
PG  - 305-12
AB  - Central regulation of the sympathetic nervous system plays an important role in
      the maintenance of blood pressure. In a subset of patients with essential
      hypertension, sympathetic activation may contribute to the development and
      maintenance of hypertension. Unlike the first generation of centrally active
      antihypertensive drugs, the second generation may be superior because of its
      selectivity to I1-imidazoline receptor and selective binding to the vasomotor
      center. Lack of a2 effects differentiates moxonidine from clonidine with respect 
      to monoxidine"s superior side-effect profile (little or no sedation or dry
      mouth). Clinical trials show that moxonidine is as effective as
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (eg, enalapril and captopril),
      b-blockers (e.g., atenolol), calcium-channel blockers (e.g., long-acting
      nifedipine), and diuretics (eg, hydrochlorothiazide) in lowering blood pressure
      and that it has superior tolerability. Thus, central modulation of the
      sympathetic nervous system has re-emerged as an exciting target for blood
      pressure reduction. Given the multiple adverse effects of sympathetic stimulation
      in various disease processes, including congestive heart failure, moxonidine may 
      be the next therapeutic option for the management of hypertension and the
      prevention of target organ dysfunction.

TI  - Amphetamine abuse during pregnancy: environmental factors and outcome after 14-15
      years.
PG  - 154-7
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the influence of social environmental factors
      on school performance and behavioural problems among 14-year-old children who had
      been exposed to amphetamine during foetal life. The study group comprised a
      cohort of 65 children who had suffered intrauterine exposure to amphetamine due
      to maternal drug abuse. This group has been followed since birth and examined at 
      regular intervals. Information regarding the academic performance of the children
      was gathered from the school authorities. The psychosocial environment of the
      children was determined through interviews and through information obtained from 
      the social authorities. Of the 64 children who attended a school within the state
      school system, 10 (15%) were a year behind for their age. The mean grades were
      significantly lower than those of their classmates. Behavioural problems were
      mentioned in the social authority documentation of one-third of the children,
      regardless of whether the child was placed in a foster home or was residing with 
      the biological mother. A positive significant correlation was found between
      maternal age and the outcome of the children, as well as between therapy during
      pregnancy and outcome, whilst several environmental factors, particularly during 
      the child's first four years, correlate negatively to outcome. Psychosocial
      factors early in life influence the outcome at 14 years. The positive effect of
      intervention during pregnancy illustrates the importance of early identification 
      preferable during pregnancy.

TI  - [Premedication in maxillofacial surgery under total intravenous anesthesia .
      Effects of clonidine compared to midazolam on the perioperative course].
PG  - 428-34
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The effects of the currently favoured preanaesthetic drugs
      (benzodiazepines, alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists) on the perioperative course are 
      inadequately investigated for new ways of performing anaesthesia with recently
      introduced drugs (e.g. remifentanil). Therefore clonidine and midazolam were used
      for premedication in maxillo-facial surgery under total intravenous anesthesia,
      and the perioperative courses were analyzed. METHODS: Thirty patients (ASA 1-2)
      were included in the present doubleblinded, prospective study. 60-90 minutes
      preoperatively these patients got an oral premedication with 5 micrograms kg-1
      clonidine or 100 micrograms kg-1 midazolam. For anaesthesia a standardized
      procedure with propofol, remifentanil and rocuronium was performed. After
      induction of anaesthesia the infusion of remifentanil was regulated by using
      spectral edge frequency (target-SEF90, 10-13 Hz). The efficiency of the
      premedication as well as the emergence and recovery were assessed by using
      established standardized tests. The perioperative stress response was assessed by
      recording the effects on haemodynamic parameters (NIBP. heart rate. Holter-ECG). 
      RESULTS: Referring to the effects of premedication (sedation, anxiety) there were
      no differences between the groups. The clonidine group required a lower
      remifentanil rate in keeping a steady-target-SEF90 (-24%). The time until
      emergence and recovery was not significantly different. Even the occurrence of
      PONV, VAS or the postoperative analgetic requirement did not differ between the
      two groups. However, the incidence of postoperative shivering was significantly
      higher in the midazolam group. Intraoperatively the values of MAP were quite
      equal between the groups. However, heart rate was significantly lower in the
      clonidine group. Postoperatively both MAP as well as heart rate were lower in the
      clonidine group. Furthermore, in the midazolam group there was a significantly
      higher cumulative duration of tachycardia (heart rate > 100 min-1; following
      descripted as medium with 25% and 75%-percentage; clonidine: 29/0/563 sec.:
      midazolam: 1058/232/3171 sec.). CONCLUSION: After remifentanil supplemented
      anesthesia there is, especially in the postoperative period, a benefit in using
      clonidine compared to the premedication with midazolam.

TI  - Comparative efficacy of risperidone and clozapine in the treatment of patients
      with refractory schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder: a retrospective
      analysis.
PG  - 498-504
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clozapine is effective in up to 60% of patients with refractory
      schizophrenia, whereas the efficacy of risperidone remains unknown. This
      retrospective study examined the relative efficacy of these drugs in chronically 
      institutionalized patients refractory to conventional antipsychotic agents.
      METHOD: A total of 24 patients who at different time periods had received
      adequate trials of both clozapine and risperidone and met our inclusion criteria 
      for minimum dose and duration of each trial were included; for clozapine, a
      minimum dose of 300 mg/day had to be maintained for at least 12 weeks, and for
      risperidone, a minimum dose of 6 mg/day for at least 6 weeks. Information
      obtained from systematic retrospective chart review was blindly rated by 2
      psychiatrists using the 7-point Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I)
      scale on overall clinical state and along specific symptom domains of positive
      symptoms, negative symptoms, and aggressive behavior. RESULTS: The mean +/- SD
      dose was 520+/-94 mg/day for clozapine and 7.5+/-2.2 mg/day for risperidone.
      Fourteen patients (58%) were classified as responders to clozapine, while 6 (25%)
      responded to risperidone (CGI-I score of 1 or 2); on specific symptom domains,
      response rates to clozapine were 38% (9/24) on positive symptoms, 29% (7/24) on
      negative symptoms, and 71% (12/17) on aggressive behavior. For risperidone,
      response rates were 17% (4/24) on positive symptoms, 8% (2/24) on negative
      symptoms, and 41% (7/17) on aggressive behavior. CONCLUSION: The results of this 
      study support the utility of first giving a risperidone trial in a treatment
      algorithm for refractory patients because of its better risk/benefit profile
      compared with clozapine. Clozapine, however, remains our gold standard in the
      management of these patients.

TI  - Treatment of men with major depression: a comparison of sequential cohorts
      treated with either cognitive-behavioral therapy or newer generation
      antidepressants.
PG  - 466-72
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This report compares response to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)
      and pharmacotherapy in sequential cohorts of men with DSM-III-R major depression.
      METHOD: Patients were enrolled in consecutive standardized 16-week treatment
      protocols conducted in the same research clinic. The first group (N = 52) was
      treated with Beck's model of CBT, whereas the second group (N = 23) received
      randomized but open-label treatment with either fluoxetine (N = 10) or bupropion 
      (N = 13). Crossover to the alternate medication was permitted after 8 weeks of
      treatment for antidepressant nonresponders. The patient groups were well matched 
      prior to treatment. Outcomes included remission and nonresponse rates, as well as
      both independent clinical evaluations and self-reported measures of depressive
      symptoms. RESULTS: Despite limited statistical power to detect differences
      between treatments, depressed men treated with pharmacotherapy had significantly 
      greater improvements on 4 of 6 continuous dependent measures and a significantly 
      lower rate of nonresponse (i.e., 13% vs. 46%). The difference favoring
      pharmacotherapy was late-emerging and partially explained by crossing over
      nonresponders to the alternate medication. The advantage of pharmacotherapy over 
      CBT also tended to be larger among the subgroup of patients with chronic
      depression. CONCLUSION: Results of prior research comparing pharmacotherapy and
      CBT may have been influenced by the composition of study groups, particularly the
      gender composition, the choice of antidepressant comparators, or an interaction
      of these factors. Prospective studies utilizing flexible dosing of modern
      antidepressants and, if necessary, sequential trials of dissimilar medications
      are needed to confirm these findings.

      cross-over study vs. low-dose pimozide.
PG  - 443-6
AB  - We selected four patients with severe Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, high
      frequency of tics (two to ten per minute), vocalizations, and lack of
      comorbidity. These patients (aged 19-40 years) underwent a 52-week double-blind
      cross-over study with olanzapine (5 and 10 mg daily) vs. low-dose pimozide (2 and
      4 mg daily). The reduction in rating scale scores for the syndrome was highly
      significant with 10 mg olanzapine vs. basal and vs. 2 mg pimozide, and was
      significant for 5 mg olanzapine vs. 4 mg pimozide. Only moderate sedation was
      reported by one patient during olanzapine treatment while three complained of
      minor motor side effects and sedation during pimozide treatment. At the end of
      the study all patients opted for olanzapine treatment.

TI  - Risperidone for the treatment of stuttering.
PG  - 479-82
AB  - A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted to assess the 
      efficacy of risperidone in the treatment of developmental stuttering in 16
      adults. Eight subjects received placebo and eight received risperidone at 0.5 mg 
      once daily at night, increased to a maximum of 2 mg/day. After 6 weeks of
      treatment, decreases in all measures of stuttering severity were greater in the
      risperidone group than in the placebo group; the between-treatment difference was
      significant (p < 0.05) on the most important measure, the percentage of syllables
      stuttered. In the risperidone group, reductions from baseline in scores for the
      percentage of syllables stuttered, time stuttering as a percentage of total time 
      speaking, and overall stuttering severity were significant (p < 0.01); changes in
      scores on the fourth measure of stuttering, duration, were not significant. No
      significant decreases occurred in the placebo group. Among the eight patients in 
      the risperidone group, five responded best to 0.5 mg/day, with stuttering
      recurring at higher doses. The remaining three patients responded better with
      increasing doses of risperidone. Risperidone was generally well tolerated. The
      results of this small study indicate that risperidone may be effective in the
      treatment of developmental stuttering. This finding needs to be confirmed in a
      larger trial.

TI  - A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of risperidone addition in serotonin
      reuptake inhibitor-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder.
PG  - 794-801
AB  - BACKGROUND: To date, only 1 controlled study has found a drug (haloperidol) to be
      efficacious in augmenting response in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder
      (OCD) refractory to serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) monotherapy; patients with
      comorbid chronic tic disorders showed a preferential response. This report
      describes the first controlled study of risperidone addition in patients with OCD
      refractory to treatment with SRI alone. METHODS: Seventy adult patients with a
      primary DSM-IV diagnosis of OCD received 12 weeks of treatment with an SRI.
      Thirty-six patients were refractory to the SRI and were randomized in a
      double-blind manner to 6 weeks of risperidone (n = 20) or placebo (n = 16)
      addition. Behavioral ratings, including the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive
      Scale, were obtained at baseline and throughout the trial. Placebo-treated
      patients subsequently received an identical open-label trial of risperidone
      addition. RESULTS: For study completers, 9 (50%) of 18 risperidone-treated
      patients were responders (mean daily dose, 2.2 +/-0.7 mg/d) compared with 0 of 15
      in the placebo addition group (P<. 005). Seven (50%) of 14 patients who received 
      open-label risperidone addition responded. Risperidone addition was superior to
      placebo in reducing OCD (P<.001), depressive (P<.001), and anxiety (P =.003)
      symptoms. There was no difference in response between OCD patients with and
      without comorbid diagnoses of chronic tic disorder or schizotypal personalty
      disorder. Other than mild, transient sedation, risperidone was well tolerated.
      CONCLUSION: These results suggest that OCD patients with and without comorbid
      chronic tic disorders or schizotypal personality disorder may respond to the
      addition of low-dose risperidone to ongoing SRI therapy.

TI  - Small-dose clonidine prolongs postoperative analgesia after sciatic-femoral nerve
      block with 0.75% ropivacaine for foot surgery.
PG  - 388-92
AB  - To evaluate the effects of adding small-dose clonidine to 0.75% ropivacaine
      during peripheral nerve blocks, 30 ASA physical status I and II patients
      undergoing hallux valgus repair under combined sciatic-femoral nerve block were
      randomly allocated in a double-blinded fashion to receive block placement with 30
      mL of either 0.75% ropivacaine alone (group Ropivacaine, n = 15) or 0.75%
      ropivacaine plus 1 microg/kg clonidine (group Ropivacaine-Clonidine, n = 15).
      Hemodynamic variables, oxygen saturation, and levels of sedation, as well as the 
      time required to achieve surgical block and time to first analgesic request, were
      recorded by a blinded observer. Time to surgical blockade required 10 min in both
      groups. Patients in the Ropivacaine-Clonidine group were more sedated than
      patients in the Ropivacaine group only 10 min after block placement. No
      differences in oxygen saturation and hemodynamic variables, degree of pain
      measured at first analgesic request, and consumption of postoperative analgesics 
      were observed between the two groups. The mean time from block placement to first
      request for pain medication was shorter in group Ropivacaine (13.7 h; 25th-75th
      percentiles: 11. 8-14.5 h) than in group Ropivacaine-Clonidine (16.8 h; 25th-75th
      percentiles: 13.5-17.8 h) (P = 0.038). We conclude that adding 1 microg/kg
      clonidine to 0.75% ropivacaine provided a 3-h delay in first request for pain
      medication after hallux valgus repair, with no clinically relevant side effects. 
      Implications: This prospective, randomized, double-blinded study demonstrated
      that, when providing combined sciatic-femoral nerve block for hallux valgus
      repair, the addition of 1 microg/kg clonidine to 0.75% ropivacaine prolongs the
      duration of postoperative analgesia by 3 h, with only a slight and short-lived
      increase in the degree of sedation and no hemodynamic adverse effects.

TI  - Electrocardiographic abnormalities in patients treated with clozapine.
PG  - 441-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular side effects of clozapine are not uncommon, but few
      systematic studies of these effects have been performed. In this study, we
      reviewed data on the electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities in patients treated
      with clozapine. METHOD: Sixty-one patients treated with clozapine were selected
      from the Seoul National University Hospital Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia
      Clinic. A retrospective chart review was conducted to identify ECG abnormalities 
      and cardiovascular side effects. RESULTS: The prevalence of ECG abnormalities in 
      patients who had been using antipsychotics other than clozapine was 13.6% at
      baseline, which increased significantly to 31.1% after commencement of clozapine 
      treatment. Among the 53 patients without baseline ECG abnormalities, 13 showed
      new-onset ECG abnormalities after using clozapine. Normal ECG under previous
      antipsychotic medication reduced the risk of new-onset ECG abnormalities, whereas
      increased age was found to increase the risk. The occurrence of orthostatic
      hypotension or tachycardia was not related to the development of ECG
      abnormalities. Most of the newly developed abnormalities had little clinical
      significance, and they tended to occur during the initial phase of treatment. In 
      10 patients, ECGs normalized despite the continued use of clozapine. Clozapine
      increased corrected QT interval (QTc) in a dose-dependent fashion; however, the
      clinical significance of this observation is uncertain. Pathologic prolongation
      of QTc was found to be rare. CONCLUSION: Although a substantial portion of
      patients treated with clozapine developed ECG abnormalities, most of the
      abnormalities were benign and did not hinder further treatment.

TI  - Low-dose amphetamine salts and adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - 414-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Effective treatments for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
      (ADHD) in adults are still being defined. Pediatric studies have suggested that a
      mixed amphetamine salt product (Adderall) is safe and effective in the treatment 
      of childhood forms of ADHD. Presently, there are no reports in the scientific
      literature concerning the safety and efficacy of Adderall in adults with ADHD,
      which is the focus of this study. METHOD: Twenty-four outpatients (mean age =
      33.3 years) with DSM-IV ADHD were administered Adderall in an open-label fashion,
      starting at 5 mg p.o. b.i.d., with titration according to clinical response,
      across a 16-week period. Relatives or spouses of each patient completed serial
      checklists (including the Copeland Symptom Checklist and the Brown
      Attention-Deficit Disorder Scales). Prospectively collected data were analyzed
      retrospectively. RESULTS: Thirteen patients (54%) responded in a positive manner 
      to Adderall, based on Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale scores. The
      mean end dose for responders was 10.77 mg/day (0.14 mg/kg/day). An
      intent-to-treat analysis revealed a decrease in the mean Copeland score from
      99.05 to 63.3 (p < .001), while the mean Brown score dropped from 76.75 to 50.85 
      (p < .0001). Nine patients (38%) were poor responders or nonresponders to
      Adderall. Acute anxiety symptoms occurred in 4 of 7 patients with a comorbid
      anxiety diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Adderall may be an effective agent for the
      treatment of adult forms of ADHD, with positive responses occurring at relatively
      low doses, at least for some individuals. However, Adderall may precipitate
      anxiety in vulnerable individuals. Further study is required.

TI  - Acute effects of d-amphetamine during the early and late follicular phases of the
      menstrual cycle in women.
PG  - 509-15
AB  - Recent preclinical evidence indicates that ovarian hormones, such as estrogen and
      progesterone, may influence the behavioral effects of psychoactive drugs by
      interacting directly with neurotransmitter systems in the central nervous system.
      However, few studies have examined the effects of ovarian hormones on subjective 
      or behavioral responses to psychoactive drugs in humans. In the present study, we
      assessed the subjective and physiological effects of d-amphetamine during the
      early and late follicular phases of the menstrual cycle. Nineteen healthy,
      regularly-cycling women participated in four sessions receiving doses of
      d-amphetamine (AMPH; 15 mg oral) or placebo during the early and late follicular 
      phases of two menstrual cycles. During the early follicular phase levels of both 
      estrogen and progesterone are low, whereas during the late follicular phase
      estrogen levels are higher while progesterone remains low. Dependent measures
      included self-report questionnaires, physiological measures and plasma hormone
      levels. Most of the subjective and physiological effects of AMPH were not
      affected by menstrual cycle phase. However, subjects reported greater Unpleasant 
      Stimulation after AMPH, and less Unpleasant Sedation, during the late follicular 
      phase than during the early follicular phase. These results provide limited
      evidence that higher levels of estrogen during the late follicular phase alter
      the subjective effects of AMPH in normal, healthy women.

TI  - Naming speed performance and stimulant effects indicate effortful, semantic
      processing deficits in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - 237-52
AB  - This study investigated rapid automatized naming and effects of stimulant
      medication in school-age children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
      (ADHD) with and without concurrent reading disorder (RD). Two ADHD groups (67
      ADHD only; 21 ADHD + RD) and a control group of 27 healthy age-matched peers were
      compared on four variables: color naming speed, letter naming speed, phonologic
      decoding, and arithmetic computation. Discriminant function analysis (DFA) was
      conducted to predict group membership. The four variables loaded onto two
      discriminant functions with good specificity: phonologic decoding, letter naming 
      speed, and arithmetic defined the first function; color naming speed defined the 
      second function. Both ADHD groups were significantly slower in color naming than 
      controls, but did not differ from one another. DFA correctly classified 96% of
      the control group, 91% of ADHD + RD, and 82% of ADHD only. A subset of children
      in the ADHD groups participated subsequently in an acute, randomized,
      placebo-controlled, crossover trial with three single doses (10, 25, 20 mg) of
      methylphenidate. Methylphenidate selectively improved color-naming speed but had 
      no effect on the speed of naming letters or digits. These findings challenge the 
      tenet that naming speed deficits are specific to RD and implicate naming speed
      deficits associated with effortful semantic processing in ADHD, which are
      improved but not normalized by stimulant medication.

TI  - Clozapine augmentation: safety and efficacy.
PG  - 421-40
AB  - While clozapine has been demonstrated to be efficacious in refractory
      schizophrenia and possibly schizoaffective as well as bipolar disorders, a
      substantial number of patients still remain unresponsive. One strategy in
      treating these refractory patients is to augment clozapine with other somatic
      treatments. This article reviews the efficacy and safety of the combination of
      clozapine with other somatic treatments. A total of 70 articles were obtained
      from a manual, as well as computerized (Medline), search of the English language 
      literature from 1978 to March 1998. Few controlled studies exist; most were case 
      reports/series. From these data, the greatest risk of adverse effects seems to be
      associated with clozapine combined with benzodiazepines, valproate, or lithium,
      but no currently evaluated combination is absolutely unsafe. In terms of
      efficacy, the data suggest a number of potential augmentation strategies,
      although controlled data are few. Combination therapies with clozapine are common
      in clinical practice, despite a lack of empirical data, and the benefits and
      risks of these combinations need to be systematically reviewed.

TI  - Profiles of cognitive dysfunction in chronic amphetamine and heroin abusers.
PG  - 113-26
AB  - Groups of subjects whose primary drug of abuse was amphetamine or heroin were
      compared, together with age- and IQ-matched control subjects. The study consisted
      of a neuropsychological test battery which included both conventional tests and
      also computerised tests of recognition memory, spatial working memory, planning, 
      sequence generation, visual discrimination learning, and attentional
      set-shifting. Many of these tests have previously been shown to be sensitive to
      cortical damage (including selective lesions of the temporal or frontal lobes)
      and to cognitive deficits in dementia, basal ganglia disease, and
      neuropsychiatric disorder. Qualitative differences, as well as some
      commonalities, were found in the profile of cognitive impairment between the two 
      groups. The chronic amphetamine abusers were significantly impaired in
      performance on the extra-dimensional shift task (a core component of the
      Wisconsin Card Sort Test) whereas in contrast, the heroin abusers were impaired
      in learning the normally easier intra-dimensional shift component. Both groups
      were impaired in some of tests of spatial working memory. However, the
      amphetamine group, unlike the heroin group, were not deficient in an index of
      strategic performance on this test. The heroin group failed to show significant
      improvement between two blocks of a sequence generation task after training and
      additionally exhibited more perseverative behavior on this task. The two groups
      were profoundly, but equivalently impaired on a test of pattern recognition
      memory sensitive to temporal lobe dysfunction. These results indicate that
      chronic drug use may lead to distinct patterns of cognitive impairment that may
      be associated with dysfunction of different components of cortico-striatal
      circuitry.

TI  - Low incidence of persistent tardive dyskinesia in elderly patients with dementia 
      treated with risperidone.
PG  - 1150-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors studied the incidence of tardive dyskinesia in elderly
      institutionalized patients with dementia being treated with risperidone. METHOD: 
      After participating in a 12-week multicenter double-blind study during which they
      received placebo or one of three doses of risperidone, 330 patients (mean
      age=82.5 years) with Alzheimer's, vascular, or mixed dementia were enrolled in a 
      1-year open-label study during which they received flexible doses of risperidone.
      Persistent emergent tardive dyskinesia was defined according to scores on the
      dyskinesia subscale of the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale. RESULTS: The mean
      modal risperidone dose was 0.96 mg/day (SD=0.53), and the median length of
      risperidone use was 273 days. The 1-year cumulative incidence of persistent
      emergent tardive dyskinesia among the 255 patients without dyskinesia at baseline
      was 2.6%. Patients with dyskinetic symptoms at baseline experienced significant
      reductions in the severity of dyskinesia. Patients who received 0.75-1.5 mg/day
      of risperidone showed a significant improvement in psychopathologic symptoms over
      the 1-year period. CONCLUSIONS: Although there was no control group, the observed
      incidence of persistent tardive dyskinesia with risperidone seemed to be much
      lower than that seen in elderly patients treated with conventional neuroleptics. 
      The average optimal dose of risperidone in elderly dementia patients was found to
      be 0.75-1.5 mg/day.

TI  - Atypical antipsychotics and weight gain--a systematic review.
PG  - 416-32
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review systematically data relating to weight changes with atypical
      antipsychotics. METHOD: We conducted a Medline search on October 29 1999 and
      covered the period 1980-99. All recovered papers were examined for further
      relevant reports. In addition, we wrote to pharmaceutical manufacturers and 10
      practising clinicians to ask them to provide other relevant reports known to
      them. RESULTS: Eighty reports mentioning change in body weight were retrieved.
      Data relating to weight changes were of variable quality. Weight changes were
      indicated by a variety of measures. The majority of reports related to short-term
      changes. CONCLUSION: All atypical drugs, with the exception of ziprasidone, have 
      been associated with weight increases. Clozapine seems to have the highest risk
      of weight gain, followed by olanzapine and quetiapine. There is probably a lower 
      risk with risperidone, sertindole and zotepine and a still lower risk with
      amisulpride. Ziprasidone appears not to be associated with weight gain. In the
      absence of more compelling data, these rankings must be considered approximate
      and preliminary. Longer, more robust trials are needed.

TI  - Medication continuation and compliance: a comparison of patients treated with
      clozapine and haloperidol.
PG  - 382-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compares medication continuation and regimen compliance
      with the atypical antipsychotic medication clozapine versus the conventional
      antipsychotic haloperidol. METHOD: Data from a 15-site double-blind, randomized
      clinical trial (N = 423) were used to compare patients with DSM-III-R
      schizophrenia assigned to clozapine or haloperidol in terms of duration of
      participation while taking the randomly assigned study drug (continuation) and
      the proportion of prescribed pills that were taken (compliance). Multiple
      regression analysis was used to determine the relationship of baseline
      characteristics and measures of clinical change to continuation for the entire
      sample and for patients assigned to each medication. RESULTS: Patients assigned
      to clozapine continued taking the study drug for a mean of 35.5 weeks as compared
      with only 27.2 among patients assigned to haloperidol (F = 4.45, df = 1,422; p = 
      .0001). No differences were found between the groups in the proportion of
      prescribed pills that were returned at any timepoint. Among patients assigned to 
      haloperidol, poorer continuation was associated with being older and greater
      continuation with receiving public support. Among patients on clozapine
      treatment, continuation was poorer among African American patients and greater
      among patients who showed reduced clinical symptoms and akathisia. Continuation
      with clozapine was greater even after adjusting for these factors. CONCLUSION:
      Continuation with medication is greater with clozapine than haloperidol and is
      partly explained by greater symptom improvement and reduced side effects. No
      differences were found in regimen compliance.

TI  - The safety of olanzapine compared with other antipsychotic drugs: results of an
      observational prospective study in patients with schizophrenia (EFESO Study).
      Pharmacoepidemiologic Study of Olanzapine in Schizophrenia.
PG  - 335-43
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Results of controlled clinical trials should be confirmed through
      safety and effectiveness studies in nonselected patient cohorts treated according
      to routine clinical practice. METHOD: Outpatients with schizophrenia (ICD-10
      criteria) entered this prospective, naturalistic study when they received a new
      prescription for an antipsychotic drug. Treatment assignment was based on purely 
      clinical criteria, as the study did not include any experimental intervention.
      Safety was evaluated through the collection of spontaneous adverse events and a
      specific questionnaire for extrapyramidal symptoms. Global clinical status was
      measured through the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) and the Global 
      Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scales. RESULTS: From the 2967 patients included,
      2128 patients were treated with olanzapine as monotherapy or combined with other 
      drugs (olanzapine group), and 821 were treated with other antipsychotic drugs as 
      monotherapy or combined with other drugs (control group). There were no
      statistical differences between treatment groups at baseline regarding age,
      gender, disease duration, or severity of symptoms. Olanzapine was well tolerated 
      and effective in this study. Overall incidence of adverse events was
      significantly lower in the olanzapine group compared with the control group (p < 
      .001). Somnolence and weight gain were significantly more frequent in the
      olanzapine group, and akathisia, dystonia, extrapyramidal syndrome, hypertonia,
      hypokinesia, and tremor were significantly higher in the control group. Clinical 
      improvement at endpoint, measured through the mean change in the CGI-S and the
      GAF, was significantly higher in the olanzapine group compared with the control
      group (p = .004). CONCLUSION: These results show that olanzapine is safe and
      effective in nonselected schizophrenic outpatients and are consistent with the
      efficacy and safety profile that olanzapine has shown in previous controlled
      clinical trials.

TI  - A positron emission tomography study of quetiapine in schizophrenia: a
      preliminary finding of an antipsychotic effect with only transiently high
      dopamine D2 receptor occupancy.
PG  - 553-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Quetiapine is a new atypical antipsychotic medication. As such,
      relatively little has been published regarding its in vivo effects at the
      dopamine type 2 (D2) and serotonin type 2a (5-HT2a) receptor systems. The
      following study was undertaken to explore these effects across the clinical dose 
      range and relate this information to its clinical profile. METHODS: Twelve
      patients with schizophrenia were randomly assigned to doses of 150 to 600 mg/d
      (n=3, at 150, 300, 450, and 600 mg/d) of quetiapine. After 3 weeks of treatment, 
      D2 and 5-HT2a occupancy were measured using positron emission tomography (PET)
      imaging, 12 to 14 hours after the last dose. Clinical efficacy and adverse effect
      ratings were obtained at baseline, at the time of PET scanning, and at 12 weeks. 
      Two additional patients were included to examine the effects of the drug 2 to 3
      hours after last dose. RESULTS: Quetiapine was an effective antipsychotic and
      improved the extrapyramidal symptoms and prolactin level elevation noted at
      baseline. It achieved these results with minimal (0%-27%) D2 occupancy 12 hours
      after the last dose. Study of the additional subjects revealed that quetiapine
      does give rise to transiently high (58%-64%) D2 occupancy 2 to 3 hours after a
      single dose that then decreases to minimal levels in 12 hours. CONCLUSIONS:
      Quetiapine shows a transiently high D2 occupancy, which decreases to very low
      levels by the end of the dosing interval. Quetiapine's low D2 occupancy can
      explain its freedom from extrapyramidal symptoms and prolactin level elevation.
      The data suggest that transient D2 occupancy may be sufficient for its
      antipsychotic effect. Future studies controlling for nonpharmacological effects
      as well as activities on other receptors will be necessary to confirm this
      suggestion.

TI  - Risperidone for the treatment of cocaine dependence: randomized, double-blind
      trial.
PG  - 305-10
AB  - A partial blockade of the multiple actions of cocaine is one strategy by which
      cocaine dependence may be treated. Risperidone, a 5-hydroxytryptamine and
      dopamine D2 antagonist, is an atypical antipsychotic and was a candidate
      medication for the treatment of cocaine dependence. One hundred ninety-three
      cocaine-dependent subjects were enrolled in a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled trial. Subjects initially received either placebo or 4 or 8 mg
      of risperidone, with a subsequent change to active doses of 2 mg and 4 mg.
      Subjects attended the clinic twice each week, provided urine samples, obtained
      medication, and underwent one behavioral therapy session per week. The study was 
      terminated at the interim analysis. Retention was worse for the 4- and 8-mg
      active medication groups. Side effects were primarily associated with the 8-mg
      dose, although neither 2 mg nor 4 mg was well accepted by subjects. There was no 
      reduction in cocaine use associated with risperidone. The results suggest that
      although antagonists might be a useful treatment approach, such as in the
      treatment of opiate dependence, risperidone is unlikely to find broad acceptance 
      with the treatment-seeking population.

TI  - Longitudinal comparative study of risperidone and conventional neuroleptics for
      treating patients with schizophrenia. The Quebec Schizophrenia Study Group.
PG  - 295-304
AB  - This study compared the long-term (12 months) effectiveness of risperidone (RP)
      with that of conventional neuroleptics (CNs) in a population with chronic
      schizophrenia who had shown suboptimal response to CNs. A randomized, open,
      parallel, multicenter design was used. One hundred eighty-four subjects meeting
      DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia were randomly assigned to receive either RP or 
      a CN, and 165 of them completed the follow-up. Outcome measures were taken at 3, 
      6, and 12 months and included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)
      and the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale. Within this 12-month follow-up, RP
      was found to be superior to CNs in terms of both the average change in score from
      baseline on the PANSS (p = 0.006) and the proportion of good responders (as
      defined by a 20% decrease in total PANSS scores;p = 0.03). For positive symptoms,
      the effectiveness of the RP treatment tended to increase over time. At 12 months,
      the percentage of good responders in the RP group was twice as large as that in
      the CN group (30% vs. 15%;p = 0.03). The superiority of RP over CNs was constant 
      over the three dose categories. In both the RP and the CN groups, the maximum
      decrease in psychopathology was achieved with the lowest dose range. A worsening 
      of akathisia was less frequent in subjects receiving RP than in those receiving
      CNs (p = 0.02). In conclusion, this study showed that, compared with CNs, RP is
      beneficial in the treatment of patients with chronic schizophrenia and that some 
      of these benefits may appear only after longer-term treatment.

TI  - Ondansetron given before induction of anesthesia reduces shivering after general 
      anesthesia.
PG  - 1423-7
AB  - The neurotransmitter pathways involved in the mechanism of postanesthetic
      shivering (PAS) are poorly understood. Meperidine, clonidine, and physostigmine
      are all effective treatments, indicating that opioid, alpha(2)-adrenergic, and
      anticholinergic systems are probably involved. We investigated the effect of
      ondansetron, a 5-HT(3) antagonist used to treat postoperative nausea and
      vomiting, on intraoperative core and peripheral temperatures and PAS. Eighty-two 
      patients (age, 18-60 yr) undergoing orthopedic, general, or urological surgery
      were randomized into three groups in this double-blinded, placebo-controlled,
      study: Group O4 (n = 27) received ondansetron 4 mg IV, Group O8 (n = 27) received
      ondansetron 8 mg IV, and Group C (n = 28) received saline IV immediately before
      the anesthetic induction. Core (tympanic) and fingertip temperature (dorsum of
      middle finger) were recorded. Anesthesia was induced with IV fentanyl 1 microg/kg
      and propofol 2.0-2.5 mg/kg and maintained with 1 minimum alveolar anesthetic
      concentration isoflurane in 70% nitrous oxide/oxygen. The occurrence of shivering
      was documented clinically during recovery by nursing staff, who were unaware of
      the group assignment. PAS occurred in 16 of 28 (57%) patients in Group C,
      compared with 9 of 27 (33%) in Group O4 (P = 0.13) and 4 of 27 (15%) patients in 
      Group O8 (P = 0.003). Within each group, core temperature decreased and
      peripheral temperature increased significantly, but there were no significant
      differences among the groups at any time interval. We conclude that ondansetron 8
      mg IV given during the induction of anesthesia prevents PAS without affecting the
      core-to-peripheral redistribution of heat during general anesthesia. This
      suggests that serotonergic pathways have a role in the regulation of PAS.
      Implications: In a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, clinical
      study, ondansetron 8 mg IV, given just before the induction, reduced the
      incidence of postanesthetic shivering compared with saline. The anticipated
      core-to-peripheral redistribution of body temperature during general anesthesia
      was not affected. This implies that ondansetron probably acts by a central
      inhibitory mechanism, and that 5-hydroxytryptaminergic pathways have a role in
      regulating postanesthetic shivering.

TI  - Oral clonidine in postmenopausal patients with breast cancer experiencing
      tamoxifen-induced hot flashes: a University of Rochester Cancer Center Community 
      Clinical Oncology Program study.
PG  - 788-93
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hot flashes are the most frequently reported side effect of tamoxifen
      treatment. Although hormones are an effective treatment, their safety is
      questionable in women with breast cancer. It is therefore important to evaluate
      nonhormonal treatments for hot flashes. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness 
      of oral clonidine for control of hot flashes associated with tamoxifen therapy in
      postmenopausal women with breast cancer. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled clinical trial. SETTING: University of Rochester Cancer Center
      Community Clinical Oncology Program. PATIENTS: 194 postmenopausal women with
      breast cancer who were receiving adjuvant tamoxifen therapy. INTERVENTION: Oral
      clonidine hydrochloride, 0.1 mg/d, or placebo for 8 weeks. MEASUREMENTS: In a
      daily diary, patients recorded number, duration, and severity of hot flashes and 
      overall quality-of-life score (on a 10-point scale) during a 1-week baseline
      period and during the 4th, 8th, and 12th weeks of the study. RESULTS: Patients in
      the placebo and treatment groups were similar in age, duration of tamoxifen use, 
      reported frequency and duration of hot flashes at baseline, and dropout rates.
      One hundred forty-nine patients completed 12 weeks of follow-up. The mean
      decrease in hot flash frequency was greater in the clonidine group than in the
      placebo group after 4 weeks of treatment (37% compared with 20% [95% CI for
      difference, 7% to 27%]) and 8 weeks of treatment (38% compared with 24% [CI for
      difference, 3% to 27%]). Patients receiving clonidine were more likely than
      patients receiving placebo to report difficulty sleeping (41% compared with 21%; 
      P = 0.02). A significant difference was seen in the mean change in
      quality-of-life scores (0.3 points in the clonidine group compared with -0.2
      points in the placebo group; P = 0.02) at 8 weeks, although the median difference
      was 0 in both groups. CONCLUSION: Oral clonidine, 0.1 mg/d, is effective against 
      tamoxifen-induced hot flashes in postmenopausal women with breast cancer.

TI  - Bupropion sustained release versus paroxetine for the treatment of depression in 
      the elderly.
PG  - 196-202
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression is a serious and widespread emotional disorder among the
      elderly. This study compared the efficacy and safety of bupropion sustained
      release (SR) with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor paroxetine in the
      treatment of major depression in elderly outpatients. METHOD: Elderly (> or = 60 
      years) outpatients with major depressive disorder (DSM-IV criteria) were
      evaluated in this 6-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind study comparing
      bupropion SR, 100-300 mg/day, and paroxetine, 10-40 mg/day. Efficacy was assessed
      by changes in scores on the Hamilton Rating Scales for Depression (HAM-D) and
      Anxiety (HAM-A) and the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness and
      -Improvement scales. Safety was assessed by monitoring adverse events, vital
      signs, and body weight. RESULTS: A total of 100 patients ranging in age from 60
      to 88 years were randomly assigned to treatment with bupropion SR (N = 48) or
      paroxetine (N = 52). Measurements of efficacy were similar between the 2
      treatment groups, with both groups showing improved scores on all depression
      rating scales. Headache, insomnia, dry mouth, agitation, dizziness, and nausea
      occurred in > 10% of patients in both groups; somnolence, diarrhea, constipation,
      and anorexia occurred in > 10% of patients in the paroxetine group. No
      statistically significant differences between groups in vital signs or weight
      were found. CONCLUSION: Both bupropion SR and paroxetine were safe and effective 
      for the treatment of depression in the elderly. Because of its favorable side
      effect profile, bupropion SR may provide a safe and effective nonserotonergic
      treatment alternative that is well suited as an antidepressant for the elderly.

TI  - Novel analgesic adjuncts for brachial plexus block: a systematic review.
PG  - 1122-8
AB  - This article reviews current evidence for the efficacy of adding novel analgesic 
      adjuncts to brachial plexus block, the goal of which is to prolong analgesic
      effect without the disadvantage of systemic side effects or prolonged motor
      block. It may also allow for a reduction in the total dose of local anesthetic
      used. Novel adjuncts studied to date include opioids, clonidine, neostigmine, and
      tramadol. Twenty-four studies were reviewed and assessed by using specific
      inclusion criteria, and only those studies satisfying these criteria were
      included in the final assessment. Satisfactory studies were then assessed for
      inclusion of a systemic control group to determine peripheral effect, as opposed 
      to possible systemic effect, of an adjunct administered peripherally. Evidence
      regarding the analgesic benefit of opioid adjuncts remains equivocal and more
      evidence is required before their routine use can be recommended. Clonidine
      appears to have significant analgesic benefit and to cause minimal adverse
      effects when used in doses up to 150 microg. Data regarding other drugs, such as 
      tramadol and neostigmine, are not sufficient to allow for any recommendations,
      and further studies are required.

TI  - Levobupivacaine: a review of its pharmacology and use as a local anaesthetic.
PG  - 551-79
AB  - Based on findings that the cardiotoxicity infrequently observed with racemic
      bupivacaine shows enantioselectivity, i.e. it is more pronounced with the
      R(+)-enantiomer, the S(-)-enantiomer (levobupivacaine) has been developed for
      clinical use as a long acting local anaesthetic. The majority of in vitro, in
      vivo and human pharmacodynamic studies of nerve block indicate that
      levobupivacaine has similar potency to bupivacaine. However, levobupivacaine had 
      a lower risk of cardiovascular and CNS toxicity than bupivacaine in animal
      studies. In human volunteers, levobupivacaine had less of a negative inotropic
      effect and, at intravenous doses >75 mg, produced less prolongation of the QTc
      interval than bupivacaine. Fewer changes indicative of CNS depression on EEG were
      evident with levobupivacaine. Levobupivacaine is long acting with a
      dose-dependent duration of anaesthesia. The onset of action is < or = 15 minutes 
      with various anaesthetic techniques. In studies of surgical anaesthesia in
      adults, levobupivacaine provided sensory block for up to 9 hours after epidural
      administration of < or = 202.5 mg, 6.5 hours after intrathecal 15 mg, and 17
      hours after brachial plexus block with 2 mg/kg. Randomised, double-blind clinical
      studies established that the anaesthetic and/or analgesic effects of
      levobupivacaine were largely similar to those of bupivacaine at the same dose.
      Sensory block tended to be longer with levobupivacaine than bupivacaine,
      amounting to a difference of 23 to 45 minutes with epidural administration and
      approximately 2 hours with peripheral nerve block. With epidural administration, 
      levobupivacaine produced less prolonged motor block than sensory block. This
      differential was not seen with peripheral nerve block. Conditions satisfactory
      for surgery and good pain management were achieved by use of local infiltration
      or peribulbar administration of levobupivacaine. Levobupivacaine was generally as
      effective as bupivacaine for pain management during labour, and was effective for
      the management of postoperative pain, especially when combined with clonidine,
      morphine or fentanyl. The tolerability profiles of levobupivacaine and
      bupivacaine were very similar in clinical trials. No clinically significant ECG
      abnormalities or serious CNS events occurred with the doses used. The most common
      adverse event associated with levobupivacaine treatment was hypotension (31%).
      Conclusions: Levobupivacaine is a long acting local anaesthetic with a clinical
      profile closely resembling that of bupivacaine. However, current preclinical
      safety and toxicity data show an advantage for levobupivacaine over bupivacaine. 
      Clinical data comparing levobupivacaine with ropivacaine are needed before the
      role of the drug can be fully established. Excluding pharmacoeconomic
      considerations, levobupivacaine is an appropriate choice for use in place of
      bupivacaine.

TI  - Effects of oral clonidine premedication on side effects of intravenous ketamine
      anesthesia: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 19-24
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of oral clonidine premedication on
      hemodynamic changes during the entire course of ketamine anesthesia and incidence
      of postoperative adverse reactions. DESIGN: Randomized, prospective,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study. SETTING: Department of Anesthesiology,
      University of Tsukuba Hospital, Ibaraki, Japan. PATIENTS: 39 ASA physical status 
      I and II patients undergoing superficial surgeries. INTERVENTIONS: Placebo,
      clonidine 2.5 micrograms/kg, and clonidine 5 micrograms/kg groups received
      respective doses of oral clonidine 90 minutes prior to surgery. Anesthesia was
      induced with ketamine 2 mg/kg intravenously (i.v.), trachea was intubated, and
      anesthesia was maintained with 67% nitrous oxide, oxygen, and supplemental
      ketamine (1 mg/kg) when systolic blood pressure and heart rate (HR) exceeded 180 
      mmHg and 100 bpm, respectively. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In the clonidine
      2.5 micrograms/kg group, HR response to tracheal intubation was significantly
      less, while in the clonidine 5 micrograms/kg group both mean arterial pressure
      and HR responses were significantly suppressed, compared with the placebo group. 
      Intraoperative coefficients of variations of HR were significantly less in both
      clonidine groups than the placebo group. Incidence of nightmare and degree of
      salivation were significantly less in the clonidine 5 micrograms/kg group than in
      the placebo group. CONCLUSION: Oral clonidine 2.5 micrograms/kg and clonidine 5
      micrograms/kg attenuates cardiostimulatory effects, while clonidine 5
      micrograms/kg was associated with reduced incidence and severity of nightmare and
      salivation attributable to i.v. ketamine.

TI  - Evaluation of sexual functioning in depressed outpatients: a double-blind
      comparison of sustained-release bupropion and sertraline treatment.
PG  - 122-8
AB  - Sexual dysfunction is a frequently reported side effect of many antidepressants, 
      including serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Bupropion, an antidepressant of the
      aminoketone class, is relatively free of adverse sexual effects. In a randomized,
      double-blind, multicenter trial, sustained-release bupropion (bupropion SR) and
      sertraline, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, were found to be similarly 
      efficacious in the treatment of outpatients with moderate to severe depression.
      This report describes the results of a double-blind comparison of the sexual side
      effect profiles of bupropion SR and sertraline. Two hundred forty-eight patients 
      who had received a diagnosis of moderate to severe major depression were randomly
      assigned to receive treatment with bupropion SR (100-300 mg/day) or sertraline
      (50-200 mg/day) for 16 weeks. Eligible patients were required to be in a stable
      relationship and to have normal sexual functioning. Sexual functioning was
      assessed by the investigator at each clinic visit using investigator-rated
      structured interviews. A significantly greater percentage of sertraline-treated
      patients (63% and 41% of men and women, respectively) developed sexual
      dysfunction compared with bupropion SR-treated patients (15% and 7%,
      respectively). Sexual dysfunction was noted as early as day 7 in
      sertraline-treated patients at a dose of 50 mg/day and persisted until the end of
      the 16-week treatment phase. Four patients, all of whom were treated with
      sertraline, discontinued from the study prematurely because of sexual
      dysfunction. Given the similar efficacy of the two drugs in treating depression, 
      bupropion SR may be a more appropriate antidepressant choice than sertraline in
      patients for whom sexual dysfunction is a concern.

TI  - Single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of an oral once-a-day osmotic
      controlled-release OROS (methylphenidate HCl) formulation.
PG  - 379-88
AB  - Methylphenidate is used for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity
      disorder (ADHD). OROS (methylphenidate HCl) is an osmotic controlled-release
      delivery system designed for once-daily oral dosing. The pharmacokinetics of OROS
      (methylphenidate HCl) 18 mg qd, sustained-release (SR) methylphenidate 20 mg qd, 
      and the immediate-release (IR) formulation given as three 5 mg doses every 4
      hours (tid) were compared in adults. In addition, the single- and multiple-dose
      pharmacokinetics of the OROS formulation were studied. Following OROS
      (methylphenidate HCl), there was a gradual increase in the mean methylphenidate
      plasma concentrations with peak concentrations noted at 6 to 8 hours. With the SR
      formulation, peak plasma concentrations were noted at approximately 4 hours.
      Following the IR regimen, methylphenidate plasma concentrations fluctuated in
      tandem with oral dosing; peak concentrations were noted at 6.5 hours. The
      terminal half-life of methylphenidate was similar for the three formulations. The
      dose-normalized methylphenidate Cmax for OROS (methylphenidate HCl) was
      significantly lower than for IR and SR methylphenidate. The bioavailability of
      methylphenidate and PPA from OROS (methylphenidate HCl) relative to the IR and SR
      formulations was complete. Mean methylphenidate AUC and terminal half-life were
      similar after single (32.9 ng.h/mL and 3.9 hours) and multiple doses (35.2
      ng.h/mL and 3.9 hours) of OROS (methylphenidate HCl).

TI  - Functional deficits in basal ganglia of children with
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder shown with functional magnetic resonance
      imaging relaxometry.
PG  - 470-3
AB  - Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is a highly heritable and prevalent
      neuropsychiatric disorder estimated to affect 6% of school-age children. Its
      clinical hallmarks are inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity, which often
      respond substantially to treatment with methylphenidate or dextroamphetamine.
      Etiological theories suggest a deficit in corticostriatal circuits, particularly 
      those components modulated by dopamine. We developed a new functional magnetic
      resonance imaging procedure (T2 relaxometry) to indirectly assess blood volume in
      the striatum (caudate and putamen) of boys 6-12 years of age in steady-state
      conditions. Boys with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder had higher T2
      relaxation time measures in the putamen bilaterally than healthy control
      subjects. Relaxation times strongly correlated with the child's capacity to sit
      still and his accuracy in accomplishing a computerized attention task. Daily
      treatment with methylphenidate significantly changed the T2 relaxation times in
      the putamen of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, although
      the magnitude and direction of the effect was strongly dependent on the child's
      unmedicated activity state. There was a similar but nonsignificant trend in the
      right caudate. T2 relaxation time measures in thalamus did not differ
      significantly between groups, and were not affected by methylphenidate.
      Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms may be closely tied to
      functional abnormalities in the putamen, which is mainly involved in the
      regulation of motor behavior.

TI  - A comparison of urapidil, clonidine, meperidine and placebo in preventing
      postanesthetic shivering.
PG  - 954-7
AB  - This placebo-controlled study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of urapidil 
      compared with clonidine and meperidine in preventing postanesthetic shivering,
      which is common after anesthesia administration and may be very distressing. We
      studied 120 patients undergoing elective abdominal or orthopedic surgery under
      standardized general anesthesia. After surgery, patients were randomly assigned
      to one of four groups (each group n = 30) using a double-blinded protocol: Group 
      A received 0.2 mg/kg urapidil; Group B, 3 microg/kg clonidine; Group C, 0.4 mg/kg
      meperidine; and Group D, saline 0.9% as placebo. Postanesthetic shivering was
      scored by using a five-point scale. Clonidine and meperidine significantly
      reduced the incidence and the severity of shivering in comparison with placebo,
      whereas there were no significant differences between the urapidil and placebo
      groups. Both clonidine and meperidine caused a significantly prolonged emergence 
      time (13.4 +/- 5.8 and 13. 3 +/- 5.0 min, respectively) compared with placebo
      (10.4 +/- 5.3 min) and urapidil (11.4 +/- 2.9 min). We confirmed that both
      clonidine and meperidine are effective in preventing postanesthetic shivering,
      whereas urapidil, in our setting and dosage, was not effective. Patients who
      received clonidine or meperidine had a prolonged emergence time. In the dosage
      used, urapidil seems to be unable to prevent postanesthetic shivering.
      IMPLICATIONS: Shivering (irregular muscle activity) is common after surgery and
      anesthesia. This study compared urapidil (an antihypertensive drug) as a
      prophylaxis with two established antishivering drugs (meperidine and clonidine)
      and placebo. In the dosage used, we were unable to show a significant benefit of 
      urapidil.

TI  - The hemodynamic and adrenergic effects of perioperative dexmedetomidine infusion 
      after vascular surgery.
PG  - 834-9
AB  - We tested dexmedetomidine, an alpha(2) agonist that decreases heart rate, blood
      pressure, and plasma norepinephrine concentration, for its ability to attenuate
      stress responses during emergence from anesthesia after major vascular
      operations. Patients scheduled for vascular surgery received either
      dexmedetomidine (n = 22) or placebo (n = 19) IV beginning 20 min before the
      induction of anesthesia and continuing until 48 h after the end of surgery. All
      patients received standardized anesthesia. Heart rate and arterial blood pressure
      were kept within predetermined limits by varying anesthetic level and using
      vasoactive medications. Heart rate, arterial blood pressure, and inhaled
      anesthetic concentration were monitored continuously; additional measurements
      included plasma and urine catecholamines. During emergence from anesthesia, heart
      rate was slower with dexmedetomidine (73 +/- 11 bpm) than placebo (83 +/- 20 bpm)
      (P = 0.006), and the percentage of time the heart rate was within the
      predetermined hemodynamic limits was more frequent with dexmedetomidine (P <
      0.05). Plasma norepinephrine levels increased only in the placebo group and were 
      significantly lower for the dexmedetomidine group during the immediate
      postoperative period (P = 0.0002). We conclude that dexmedetomidine attenuates
      increases in heart rate and plasma norepinephrine concentrations during emergence
      from anesthesia. IMPLICATIONS: The alpha(2) agonist, dexmedetomidine, attenuates 
      increases in heart rate and plasma norepinephrine concentrations during emergence

TI  - Acute psychological effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA,
      "Ecstasy") are attenuated by the serotonin uptake inhibitor citalopram.
PG  - 513-21
AB  - 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, "Ecstasy") is a recreational drug that
      has been shown to release serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) in animals. The
      effect of MDMA on 5-HT release can be blocked by 5-HT uptake inhibitors such as
      citalopram, suggesting that MDMA interacts with the 5-HT uptake site. It is
      unknown whether this mechanism is also responsible for the psychological effects 
      of MDMA in humans. We investigated the effect of citalopram pretreatment (40 mg
      iv) on the psychological effects of MDMA (1.5 mg/kg po) in a double-blind
      placebo-controlled psychometric study in 16 healthy human volunteers. MDMA
      produced an emotional state with heightened mood, increased self-confidence and
      extroversion, moderate derealization, and an intensification of sensory
      perception. Most of these effects were markedly reduced by citalopram. This
      finding suggests that the psychological effects of MDMA are mediated via action
      at the 5-HT uptake site to increase 5-HT release through the carrier, as expected
      from animal studies.

TI  - Effects of isradipine, a dihydropyridine-class calcium channel antagonist, on
      D-methamphetamine-induced cognitive and physiological changes in humans.
PG  - 504-12
AB  - D-methamphetamine is abused for its euphoric effects and stimulatory action on
      cognitive function. Its abuse can, however, be associated with massive
      hypertension resulting in strokes, ruptured aneurysms, or myocardial infarction. 
      We examined the utility of isradipine, a dihydropyridine-class calcium channel
      antagonist, in treating d-methamphetamine induced hypertension and evaluated its 
      effects on cognitive function, both of which are mediated by dopaminergic
      mechanisms. D-methamphetamine dose-dependently increased all vital signs
      (systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure, and pulse rate) parameters.
      Isradipine significantly reduced d-methamphetamine-induced increases in diastolic
      and mean arterial pressure; however, this potentially beneficial therapeutic
      effect was offset by a significant reflex rise in pulse rate. D-methamphetamine
      also improved attention, accuracy of reasoning ability, and performance on
      computerized cognitive function tasks. D-methamphetamine's cognitive improving
      effects were not altered significantly by isradipine. Isradipine increased the
      false responding rate but was without significant effect on any other attentional
      task, or on reasoning ability, or performance. Isradipine does not appear to
      enhance cognitive function in healthy humans.

TI  - A multicentre, double-blind, randomized comparison of quetiapine (ICI 204,636,
      'Seroquel') and haloperidol in schizophrenia.
PG  - 95-105
AB  - BACKGROUND: Quetiapine (ICI 204,636, 'Seroquel') is a new atypical antipsychotic 
      agent with a similar binding profile to the original atypical antipsychotic,
      clozapine. Its clinical efficacy has already been demonstrated at multiple fixed 
      doses (150-750 mg/day) and has been suggested to be comparable with haloperidol
      (12 mg/day). METHODS: This international, 6-week, multicentre, double-blind,
      randomized, parallel-group trial compared quetiapine with haloperidol (455 mg and
      8 mg mean total daily doses, respectively) in 448 hospitalized patients with
      acute exacerbation of chronic or subchronic schizophrenia (DSM-III-R), in order
      to establish their equivalence in terms of efficacy, and the nature of their
      tolerability profiles, especially in terms of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and
      serum prolactin levels. RESULTS: Both quetiapine and haloperidol produced a clear
      reduction in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores and Clinical
      Global Impression (CGI) Severity of Illness and Global Improvement scores. At day
      42, the PANSS total score was reduced by -18.7+/-1.63 in the quetiapine group,
      and -22.1+/-1.63 in the haloperidol group (P = 0.13, between-treatment).
      Quetiapine was better tolerated than haloperidol in terms of EPS as demonstrated 
      by the significant differences in the Simpson Scale and Abnormal Involuntary
      Movement Scale scores (P < 0.05). Although patients in both groups had elevated
      serum prolactin concentrations at baseline, mean serum prolactin concentration
      decreased (by 16.5 microg/l) in quetiapine-treated patients, yet increased (by
      5.9 microg/l) in patients treated with haloperidol. CONCLUSION: Quetiapine is an 
      effective and well tolerated antipsychotic of comparable efficacy to haloperidol 
      and lacks the latter compound's effect on prolactin and EPS.

TI  - Randomized trial of modafinil as a treatment for the excessive daytime somnolence
      of narcolepsy: US Modafinil in Narcolepsy Multicenter Study Group.
PG  - 1166-75
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This is one of two separate clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of modafinil, a novel wake-promoting agent, in patients with excessive
      daytime sleepiness (EDS) associated with narcolepsy. METHODS: In this 9-week,
      randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 21-center clinical trial, patients 
      were randomized to receive fixed daily doses of modafinil 200 mg, modafinil 400
      mg, or placebo. A placebo-controlled, 2-week treatment discontinuation phase was 
      included to evaluate the effects of withdrawal on patients who had been receiving
      modafinil. A total of 271 patients who were naive to modafinil received study
      medication in the 9-week trial and 240 patients received study medication in the 
      discontinuation phase. RESULTS: Treatment with modafinil resulted in significant 
      improvement in two objective measures of EDS: the Multiple Sleep Latency Test and
      the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test. Additionally, patient self-assessment of
      sleepiness was significantly improved, as measured by the Epworth Sleepiness
      Scale, and level of illness was significantly reduced on the independent
      clinician assessment, the Clinical Global Impression of Change. Nighttime sleep, 
      monitored by nocturnal polysomnography, was not adversely effected with modafinil
      treatment compared with placebo treatment. The most frequent adverse experience
      was headache, which was not significantly greater for modafinil than placebo.
      During treatment discontinuation, individuals who had been receiving modafinil
      experienced a return of their EDS to baseline levels. During treatment
      discontinuation, patients did not experience symptoms associated with amphetamine
      withdrawal syndrome. For up to 9 weeks of daily use there was no evidence for the
      development of dependence at the dose levels studied. CONCLUSION: The data
      indicate that modafinil has an excellent safety profile and is very well
      tolerated. Modafinil is an effective treatment for excessive daytime sleepiness
      in narcolepsy and shows continued efficacy with up to 9 weeks of daily use.

TI  - Rapid opiate detoxication in outpatient treatment: relationship with naltrexone
      compliance.
PG  - 185-91
AB  - A variety of detoxification methods have been utilized for the treatment of
      heroin withdrawal before individuals begin long-term opiate-free and naltrexone
      programs. While methadone in decreasing doses is still widely used for
      detoxication procedures, rapid and ultrarapid protocols including clonidine and
      opiate receptors antagonists have been proposed. This study compares the efficacy
      of different detoxification methods and investigates possible changes in
      naltrexone compliance. Ninety-eight heroin-addicted individuals were studied to
      evaluate withdrawal symptoms, craving, mood, urine toxicologic screens, and
      drop-out rate during therapy with: Group A: clonidine only (5 days); Group B:
      clonidine, oxazepam, baclofen, and ketoprofene with naloxone and naltrexone (2
      days); and Group C: methadone in decreasing doses (10 days). Naltrexone
      compliance and relapse rates were evaluated during a 6-month follow-up period.
      Rapid detoxification with opiate antagonists (Group B) induced slight and
      transient withdrawal symptoms, and resulted in a significantly lower percentage
      of heroin catabolites in urine controls during the detoxification procedure,
      lower negative and positive craving, less mood problems, and higher compliance in
      extended naltrexone treatment. In comparison with clonidine only (Group A) and
      methadone (Group C), the early use of naltrexone during detoxification in
      combination with benzodiazepines and clonidine facilitated extended naltrexone
      acceptance and improved the recovery outcome in outpatients.

TI  - The use of topical aqueous suppressants in the prevention of postoperative
      intraocular pressure elevation after pars plana vitrectomy with long-acting gas
      tamponade.
PG  - 588-92
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether topical aqueous suppressant therapy applied after
      pars plana vitrectomy with gas tamponade prevents postoperative intraocular
      pressure (IOP) elevation. DESIGN: Prospective, nonrandomized comparative study.
      PARTICIPANTS: Forty-one patients who met inclusion criteria and underwent pars
      plana vitrectomy with gas tamponade (SF6 18%-20% or C3F8 12%-16%) over a 1-year
      period. INTERVENTION: Treatment eyes received topical aqueous suppressants at the
      end of surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Postoperative IOP at 4 to 6 hours, 1 day, 
      and 1 week. RESULTS: Twenty-one control and 20 treatment eyes met the inclusion
      criteria. The IOP (in mmHg) measured at 4 to 6 hours (23.05 [control, 14.73
      [treatment]) and 1 day (23.24 [control], 17.28 [treatment]) postoperatively
      showed a statistically significant difference between the groups (P = 0.0038) at 
      4 to 6 hours and a trend toward significance (P = 0.057) at 1 day. Eleven control
      and three treatment eyes had an IOP spike above 25 mmHg at 4 to 6 hours or 1 day 
      postoperatively (P = 0.02), and six control eyes and one treatment eye had
      postoperative IOP greater than 30 mmHg. A pressure rise greater than 40 mmHg was 
      seen in two control eyes and no treatment eyes. CONCLUSIONS: Use of topical
      aqueous suppressants after pars plana vitrectomy with long-acting gas tamponade
      is effective in preventing significant postoperative IOP elevation in most cases.

TI  - Olanzapine increases slow-wave sleep: evidence for blockade of central 5-HT(2C)
      receptors in vivo.
PG  - 468-70
AB  - BACKGROUND: The study aimed to determine the effects of the atypical
      antipsychotic agent, olanzapine, on the polysomnogram in healthy subjects. We
      predicted that olanzapine, via serotonin(2C) (5-HT(2C)) receptor blockade, would 
      increase slow-wave sleep (SWS). METHODS: We studied the effects of single evening
      doses of olanzapine (5 mg and 10 mg orally) on the polysomnogram of 9 healthy
      male volunteers, using a placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over design.
      RESULTS: Compared to placebo, the 5-mg and 10-mg doses of olanzapine
      significantly increased SWS, sleep continuity measures, and subjective sleep
      quality. In addition, 10 mg of olanzapine suppressed rapid eye movement (REM)
      sleep and increased REM sleep latency. CONCLUSIONS: Olanzapine (5 mg and 10 mg)
      produced substantial (59.1% and 83.3%) and highly significant dose-related
      increases in SWS in humans probably via blockade of brain 5-HT(2C) receptors.
      5-HT(2C) receptor antagonism may account for some of the therapeutic and adverse 
      effects of olanzapine therapy.

TI  - Low-dose clonidine and neostigmine prolong the duration of intrathecal
      bupivacaine-fentanyl for labor analgesia.
PG  - 361-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intrathecal (IT) opioid and local anesthetic combinations are popular
      for labor analgesia because of rapid, effective pain relief, but the duration of 
      analgesia is limited. This study was undertaken to determine whether the addition
      of clonidine and neostigmine to IT bupivacaine-fentanyl would increase the
      duration of analgesia without increasing side effects for patients in labor.
      METHODS: Forty-five healthy parturients in active labor were randomized to
      receive a 2-ml IT dose of one of the following dextrose-containing solutions
      using the combined spinal-epidural technique: (1) bupivacaine 2.5 mg and fentanyl
      25 microg (BF); (2) BF plus clonidine 30 microg (BFC); or (3) BFC plus
      neostigmine 10 microg (BFCN). Pain, sensory levels, motor block, side effects,
      maternal vital signs, and fetal heart rate were systematically assessed. RESULTS:
      Patients administered BFCN had significantly longer analgesia (165+/-32 min) than
      those who received BF (90+/-21 min; P<0.001) or BFC (123+/-21 min; P<0.001). Pain
      scores, block characteristics, maternal vital signs, Apgar scores, maternal
      satisfaction, and side effects were similar among groups except for nausea, which
      was significantly greater in the BFCN group (P<0.05 as compared with BFC).
      CONCLUSIONS: The addition of clonidine and neostigmine significantly increased
      the duration of analgesia from IT bupivacaine-fentanyl during labor, but
      neostigmine caused more nausea. Although serious side effects were not observed
      in this study, safety must be further addressed before the routine use of
      multiple IT drugs is advocated.

TI  - Dopamine D2 receptor occupancy by olanzapine or risperidone in young patients
      with schizophrenia.
PG  - 33-44
AB  - A crucial characteristic of antipsychotic medication is the occupancy of the
      dopamine (DA) D2 receptor. We assessed striatal DA D2 receptor occupancy by
      olanzapine and risperidone in 36 young patients [31 males, 5 females; mean age
      21.1 years (16-28)] with first episode schizophrenia, using [123I]iodobenzamide
      (IBZM) SPECT. The occupancy of DA D2 receptors was not significantly different
      between olanzapine and risperidone. However, in subgroups of most prescribed
      doses, DA D2 occupancy was higher in the risperidone 4-mg group (79%) compared to
      the olanzapine 15-mg group (62%). [123I]IBZM binding ratios decreased with
      olanzapine dose (r = -0.551; P < 0.01), indicating higher DA D2 receptor
      occupancy with higher olanzapine dose. Akathisia and positive symptoms were
      correlated with [123I]IBZM binding ratio (r = -0.442; P < 0.01; and r = -0.360; P
      < 0.05, respectively). Prolactin (PRL) levels were elevated in the risperidone,
      but not in the olanzapine group, at comparable D2 receptor occupancy levels. In
      the olanzapine group, PRL levels were correlated with [123I]IBZM binding ratio (r
      = -0.551; P < 0.01). In conclusion, both olanzapine and risperidone induce a high
      striatal D2 receptor occupancy, dependent on dose and group formation. The lower 
      incidence of prolactin elevation with olanzapine, compared to risperidone, may
      not be attributed to a lower D2 receptor occupancy.

TI  - Non-linear pharmacokinetics of MDMA ('ecstasy') in humans.
PG  - 104-9
AB  - AIMS: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, commonly called ecstasy) is a
      synthetic compound increasingly popular as a recreational drug. Little is known
      about its pharmacology, including its metabolism and pharmacokinetics, in humans 
      in controlled settings. A clinical trial was designed for the evaluation of MDMA 
      pharmacological effects and pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers. METHODS: A
      total of 14 subjects were included. In the pilot phase six received MDMA at 50
      (n=2), 100 (n=2), and 150 mg (n=2). In the second phase eight received MDMA at
      both 75 and 125 mg (n=8). Subjects were phenotyped for CYP2D6 activity and were
      classified as extensive metabolizers for substrates, such as MDMA, whose hepatic 
      metabolism is regulated by this enzyme. Plasma and urine samples were collected
      throughout the study for the evaluation of MDMA pharmacokinetics. Body fluids
      were analysed for the determination of MDMA and its main metabolites
      3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-methamphetamine (HMMA)
      and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-amphetamine (HMA). RESULTS: As the dose of MDMA
      administered was increased, volunteers showed rises in MDMA concentrations that
      did not follow the same proportionality which could be indicative of
      nonlinearity. In the full range of doses tested the constant recovery of HMMA in 
      the urine combined with the increasing MDMA recovery seems to point towards a
      saturation or an inhibition of MDMA metabolism (the demethylenation step). These 
      observations are further supported by the fact that urinary clearance was rather 
      constant while nonrenal clearance was dose dependent. CONCLUSIONS: It has
      previously been postulated that individuals genetically deficient for the hepatic
      enzyme CYP2D6 (about 10% of the Caucasian people) were at risk of developing
      acute toxicity at moderate doses of MDMA because the drug would accumulate in the
      body instead of being metabolized and inactivated. The lack of linearity of MDMA 
      pharmacokinetics (in a window of doses compatible with its recreational use) is a
      more general phenomenon as it concerns the whole population independent of their 
      CYP2D6 genotype. It implies that relatively small increases in the dose of MDMA
      ingested are translated to disproportionate rises in MDMA plasma concentrations
      and hence subjects are more prone to develop acute toxicity.

TI  - Effect of clonidine premedication on haemodynamic responses to fibreoptic
      bronchoscopy.
PG  - 269-74
AB  - The usual haemodynamic response to fibreoptic bronchoscopy is an increase in
      heart rate and blood pressure. We therefore compared, in a prospective,
      randomised, double-blind study, the effect of two doses of oral clonidine
      premedication (150 microg or 300 microg) with placebo (control group) on the
      haemodynamic alterations in 62 patients who underwent elective fibreoptic
      bronchoscopy. Significant increases in blood pressure and heart rate were
      observed during fibreoptic bronchoscopy only in the control group. Clonidine 150 
      microg blunted the haemodynamic response to fibreoptic bronchoscopy (p < 0.05).
      Significant decreases in systolic blood pressure (< 90 mmHg) were observed in all
      patients premedicated with 300 microg clonidine. Throughout the study nine
      patients (75%) in the 300 microg clonidine group were treated at least once for
      hypotension. Compared with the control group, time to awakening was significantly
      longer only in patients premedicated with 300 microg clonidine. In conclusion,
      premedication with 150 microg oral clonidine attenuates haemodynamic responses to
      fibreoptic bronchoscopy, without causing excessive haemodynamic depression and
      sedation. These data encourage the administration of clonidine as premedication
      in patients undergoing fibreoptic bronchoscopy, particularly in those with, or at
      risk for, coronary artery disease.

TI  - The effect of bupropion on nicotine craving and withdrawal.
PG  - 33-40
AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Bupropion has demonstrated efficacy for smoking
      cessation. Given the importance of nicotine craving and withdrawal in the smoking
      cessation process, the current study examined the effects of bupropion on these
      parameters during smoking abstinence. METHODS: During a 2-day Baseline phase with
      ad lib smoking, 91 non-depressed smokers (who were not trying to quit
      permanently) were administered measures of nicotine craving, withdrawal symptoms,
      and timed measures of cognitive performance five times daily. Participants were
      then assigned randomly to a 14-day treatment regimen with bupropion 300 mg/day,
      bupropion 150 mg/day, or placebo. Thereafter, the above measures were
      re-administered during 3 days of abstinence on a closed research ward. RESULTS:
      Relative to placebo, 300 mg bupropion significantly reduced abstinence-associated
      increases in rated depression, difficulty concentrating, and irritability, and
      attenuated a decrease in positive affect. The results also suggested that
      bupropion might have a positive effect on performance measures during the
      withdrawal period. No effects were observed on craving, anxiety, restlessness, or
      hunger. The lack of findings on craving measures may be explained by a floor
      effect; except on the first day of abstinence, neither drug nor placebo groups
      showed much craving elevation during abstinence. CONCLUSIONS: Study results
      indicate that bupropion ameliorates some nicotine withdrawal symptoms.

TI  - A pilot study of methylphenidate, clonidine, or the combination in ADHD comorbid 
      with aggressive oppositional defiant or conduct disorder.
PG  - 15-25
AB  - A pilot comparison of the safety and efficacy of methylphenidate (MPH) combined
      with clonidine, clonidine monotherapy, or MPH monotherapy in 6- to 16-year-old
      children diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and
      comorbid aggressive oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder was
      completed. Study design was a 3-month, randomized, blinded, group comparison with
      eight subjects per group. No placebo comparison was used. All three treatment
      groups showed significant improvements in attention deficits, impulsivity,
      oppositional, and conduct disordered symptoms as assessed by parent and teacher
      rating scales and laboratory measures. Significant differences among treatment
      groups were found only on a few measures. Only the clonidine monotherapy group
      showed significantly decreased fine motor speed. These results suggest the safety
      and efficacy of clonidine alone or in combination with MPH for the treatment of
      ADHD and aggressive oppositional and conduct disorders.

TI  - Laboratory measures of methylphenidate effects in cocaine-dependent patients
      receiving treatment.
PG  - 61-8
AB  - Two experiments examined the effects of methylphenidate in male and female
      patients enrolled in an outpatient treatment program for primary cocaine
      dependence. The first study was a component of a double-blind efficacy trial
      wherein 57 patients were first tested in a human laboratory for their initial
      responsiveness to medication. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either
      placebo or methylphenidate treatment and received their first dose in the human
      laboratory environment before continuing in outpatient treatment. Methylphenidate
      was given as a 20-mg sustained-release dose (twice daily) plus an additional 5-mg
      immediate-release dose combined with the morning dose. Methylphenidate increased 
      heart rate and subjective ratings; however, the subjective effects were primarily
      of a "dysphoric" nature, and significant effects were limited to increases in
      anxiety, depression, and anger on the Profile of Mood States; shaky/jittery
      ratings on a visual analog scale; and dysphoria on the lysergic acid diethylamide
      (LSD) scale of the Addiction Research Center Inventory. Methylphenidate did not
      increase cocaine craving nor ratings suggesting abuse potential (i.e.,
      Morphine-Benzedrine Group or drug-liking scores, etc.). None of the drug effects 
      observed in the human laboratory was of clinical concern, and no subject was
      precluded from continuing in the outpatient study. After outpatient treatment
      completion, 12 patients were brought back into a second double-blind human
      laboratory study in which three doses (15, 30, and 60 mg) of immediate-release
      methylphenidate were administered in an ascending series preceded and followed by
      placebo. Methylphenidate produced dose-related increases in heart rate,
      subjective ratings of shaky/jittery, and LSD/dysphoria without significantly
      altering cocaine craving or stimulant euphoria ratings. These results suggest
      that stimulant substitution-type approaches to the treatment of cocaine
      dependence are not necessarily contraindicated because of cardiovascular toxicity
      or medication abuse potential. However, they also suggest that the subjective
      effects of methylphenidate may not be positive enough for an adequate replacement
      approach.

TI  - Lack of drug interactions between mirtazapine and risperidone in psychiatric
      patients: a pilot study.
PG  - 51-7
AB  - An open-label, non-randomized, pilot study has been performed in inpatients in
      need of treatment with an antipsychotic (risperidone) and an antidepressant
      (mirtazapine) with the objective to preliminarily assess a possible
      pharmacokinetic interaction and the tolerability of this combination. A 1-4-week 
      single drug treatment phase (risperidone 1-3 mg bid or mirtazapine 30 mg nocte)
      was followed by a 2-4-week combined drug treatment phase at unchanged doses.
      Twelve patients were enrolled, nine of whom were treated with risperidone in the 
      single drug phase. Results of plasma level measurements are available for six
      patients and indicate that adding mirtazapine to risperidone does not alter
      steady-state plasma concentrations of risperidone and its 9-hydroxy metabolite.
      Data from one patient suggest that adding risperidone to mirtazapine does not
      result in clinically relevant changes in plasma concentrations of either
      compound. The combination was well tolerated and no major or relevant adverse
      events were observed. Adding risperidone to mirtazapine probably does not
      necessitate a change of the dosage of either drug, but more extensive
      investigations are needed.

      trial.
PG  - 1043-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study examines the relationship between parents' knowledge of
      attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and opinions of treatment and
      their impact on enrolment in and adherence to both pharmacological and
      nonpharmacological interventions for children with ADHD. METHOD: Participants in 
      the study were the parents of 81 children who reached diagnostic criteria for
      ADHD and who were referred to a treatment study of ADHD involving stimulant
      medication and parent groups. The mothers completed a modified version of the
      ADHD Knowledge and Opinion Scale (AKOS) prior to receiving diagnostic feedback
      and prior to the families' decisions to participate in a 12-month randomized
      trial (medication [methylphenidate or placebo] and parent groups [training or
      support]). Treatment enrolment and adherence were monitored over the 12-month
      trial, and families who remained in the study at 12 months completed another
      modified AKOS. RESULTS: A higher level of knowledge of ADHD was found to be
      related to more favourable opinions of parent groups but not of medication.
      Moreover, parents who were more knowledgeable about ADHD were more likely to
      enroll in both pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments. Adherence to
      pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments was not predicted by parental
      knowledge of ADHD or opinions of the treatment. CONCLUSION: Parents' knowledge of
      ADHD and opinions of treatments play a significant role in enrollment in
      treatments for their children with ADHD. Providing information to parents
      regarding ADHD prior to offering treatment modalities could have a favourable
      impact on treatment enrollment and hence treatment adherence.

TI  - In the wake of the MTA: charting a new course for the study and treatment of
      children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - 999-1006
AB  - This paper considers 3 questions addressed by the National Institute of Mental
      Health's Collaborative Multimodal Treatment Study of Children With
      Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), the MTA study, of
      pharmacological and behavioural interventions for 7- to 9-year-old ADHD children.
      First, do behavioural interventions represent a viable treatment option for
      families of children with ADHD? Second, what are the relative benefits of
      behavioural and pharmacological interventions? Finally, are there advantages to
      combining behavioural and pharmacological interventions for children with ADHD?
      In the absence of secondary analyses, the MTA's primary intent-to-treat analyses 
      released to date are difficult to interpret. While behavioural interventions
      represented a viable option for many families, the doses achieved via systematic 
      titration and follow-up medication-management protocols yielded larger effect
      sizes on unblinded primary symptom reports than did behavioural treatments or the
      medication management used by most families in the community control conditions. 
      Finally, while combined medication and behavioural management demonstrates some
      benefits, a more definitive conclusion awaits a detailed presentation of
      secondary analyses and follow-up data.

TI  - Lessons from large trials: the MTA study as a model for evaluating the treatment 
      of childhood psychiatric disorder.
PG  - 991-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the methodology of the Multimodal Treatment Study of
      Children With Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), the MTA study, and
      its implications for the design of future child mental health treatment studies. 
      METHOD: The characteristics of large-scale studies envisioned by trialists
      engaged in cardiovascular and cancer research provide the framework for reviewing
      key elements of the MTA study--objectives, research questions, measurement,
      sampling, and exposure to treatment--and discussing important methodological
      decisions the MTA investigators had to make. RESULTS: The MTA study is a complex,
      standardized, carefully implemented, randomized control trial. Review of the MTA 
      study indicated that future studies should be aligned clearly with either
      effectiveness or efficacy objectives but not both. Questions selected for study
      should be simple, clear, and important. Measurement, sampling, and data
      collection must adhere to the principle of simplicity to ensure maximum
      participation. All methodological decisions should be geared to attaining the
      research objectives: in effectiveness trials, this means evaluating treatments
      that have a high potential for dissemination if proven successful and recruiting 
      only new referrals from child mental health settings. CONCLUSIONS: The MTA study 
      has raised the standard for technical excellence in child treatment research and 
      will draw attention to some fundamental issues in large-scale child treatment
      studies, including articulating objectives and questions, setting priorities for 
      measurement and sampling, and identifying treatments for evaluation that have a
      high probability of dissemination if found effective.

AB  - The outcome, merits, and limitations of the Multimodal Treatment Study for
      Children With Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), the MTA study, are
      described and discussed. Consideration is given to design issues that make the
      MTA a landmark study for clinicians and researchers working with ADHD children.
      These include the large, heterogeneous sample, the state-of-the-art treatment,
      the lengthy treatment period, the extensive documentation of treatment manuals,
      and the attention paid to treatment fidelity and adherence. Also highlighted are 
      facets of the design that predisposed the study in favour of a differentially
      positive outcome for pharmacological relative to behavioural treatment. Primary
      among these is the fact that outcome was measured 4-6 months after the intensive 
      phase of behaviour treatment and after therapeutic contact with the behaviour
      therapist had ended but while medication treatment was active and in its most
      intensive phase. Finally, the outcome for the combined treatment condition in the
      MTA is discussed in the context of the extant literature and directions for
      future research.

      hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - 975-80
AB  - Findings from the Multimodal Treatment Study of Children With Attention-Deficit
      Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), the MTA, have been much discussed but frequently
      misinterpreted or mischaracterized. Misinterpretations regarding the specific
      nature of and rationale for the study design, the effectiveness of the
      behavioural treatment arm, the possible advantages of combined treatments over
      single-component (medication management or behavioural therapy) interventions,
      and the feasibility and applicability of MTA treatments for "real-world"
      practitioners are addressed. Careful interpretation of the MTA findings suggests 
      that for ADHD symptoms, carefully crafted medication-management approaches are
      superior to behavioural treatment and to routine community care that includes
      medication. For non-ADHD areas of functioning (for example, social skills,
      academic performance), combined treatments may offer modest advantages over
      single-component approaches. Longer-term outcomes past 14 months of intensive MTA
      treatments (as well as their relative effectiveness with respect to each other)
      remain unknown, pending further MTA analyses. The MTA treatments by and large
      consisted of evidence-based "best practices." Thus, rather than characterizing
      these treatments as infeasible, the substantially superior outcomes of these
      treatments (versus routine clinical care) across diverse settings should help set
      the standard for future treatment practices in real-world settings. Despite
      important study limitations, the MTA study, by virtue of its size, scope, and
      length; parallel-groups design; explicit use of manualized, evidence-based
      treatments; and comprehensive range of outcome assessments sets an important
      benchmark for future trials testing new treatments for childhood ADHD and defines
      a new standard for optimal outcomes that can be achieved with the best of
      clinical care.

TI  - Dementia in developing countries. A consensus statement from the 10/66 Dementia
      Research Group.
PG  - 14-20
AB  - Less than one-tenth of all population-based research into dementia is directed
      towards the two-thirds or more of cases living in developing parts of the world. 
      The 10/66 Dementia Research Group has been formed to redress this imbalance,
      encouraging active research collaboration between centres in different developing
      countries and between developed and developing countries. The 10/66 group
      consisted initially of researchers attending a symposium on dementia research in 
      developing countries, held at the 1998 Alzheimer's Disease International
      conference. They noted a growing interest in this area, with many active
      researchers and others wishing to start new studies. There was felt to be an
      urgent need for more research: quantifying prevalence and incidence, exploring
      regional variations in international collaborations using harmonized
      methodologies, describing care arrangements for people with dementia, quantifying
      the impact on caregivers and evaluating the effectiveness of any newly
      implemented services. Methodological problems need to be addressed, particularly 
      development of culture- and education-fair dementia diagnostic procedures.
      Good-quality research can generate awareness, pioneer service development and
      influence policy.

TI  - Pretreatment with oral clonidine attenuates cardiovascular responses to tracheal 
      extubation in children.
PG  - 65-7
AB  - This study was designed to evaluate the effects of diazepam and clonidine orally 
      given preoperatively on cardiovascular responses to tracheal extubation in
      children. Fifty children, ASA physical status I, aged 4-10 years, undergoing
      minor elective surgery (inguinal hernia, phimosis) received orally, in a
      randomized, double-blind manner, diazepam 0.4 mg.kg-1 or clonidine 4
      microgram.kg-1 (n=25 of each). These drugs were administered 105 min before an
      inhalational induction of anaesthesia. The same standard general anaesthetic
      technique was employed throughout. The maximum changes in heart rate (HR),
      systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were less in
      patients who had received clonidine than in those who had received diazepam (HR, 
      12 vs 24; SBP, 14 vs 26; DBP, 9 vs 16; mean, P < 0.05). In conclusion, compared
      to diazepam given orally, pretreatment with oral clonidine attenuates
      haemodynamic changes associated with tracheal extubation in children.

TI  - Randomized double-blind controlled trial comparing the effects of ibuprofen with 
      indomethacin on cerebral hemodynamics in preterm infants with patent ductus
      arteriosus.
PG  - 36-42
AB  - A prospective randomized controlled trial was performed to compare the effects of
      ibuprofen with indomethacin on cerebral hemodynamics measured using near infrared
      spectroscopy in preterm infants during treatment for patent ductus arteriosus.
      Infants were randomly assigned to three intravenous doses of either indomethacin 
      (0.20-0.25 mg/kg, 12 hourly) or ibuprofen (5-10 mg/kg, 24 hourly) and also
      received a dose of saline. The primary end points of the study were the effects
      of the first dose on cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral blood volume. Fifteen
      infants received indomethacin and 18 received ibuprofen. The group mean (SD)
      values for CBF (mL x 100 g(-1) x min(-1)) before and after the first dose of
      indomethacin were 13.6 (4.1) and 8.3 (3.1), respectively, the change being
      significant (p<0.001). In contrast, no significant changes in CBF were observed
      with the first dose of ibuprofen, the respective before and after values being
      13.3 (3.2) and 14.9 (4.7) mL x 100 g(-1) x min(-1). The median (interquartile
      range) value for change in cerebral blood volume (mL/100 g) after the first dose 
      in the indomethacin group was -0.4 (-0.3 to -0.6) and in the ibuprofen group was 
      0.0 (0.1 to -0.1), the difference between the two groups being significant
      (p<0.001). Cerebral oxygen delivery changed significantly after the first dose in
      the indomethacin group but not in the ibuprofen group. Significant reductions in 
      CBF, cerebral blood volume, and cerebral oxygen delivery also occurred after the 
      24-h dose of indomethacin, but there were no significant changes after the 48-h
      dose of saline in the indomethacin group or after the 24- and 48-h doses of
      ibuprofen. The patent ductus arteriosus closure rates after indomethacin and
      ibuprofen were 93 and 78%, respectively. We conclude that ibuprofen, unlike
      indomethacin, has no adverse effects on cerebral hemodynamics and appears to
      mediate patent ductus arteriosus closure.

TI  - Validation of a Bengali adaptation of the Conners' Parent Rating Scale (CPRS-48).
PG  - 525-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Conners' Parent Rating Scales (CPRS) have been used to measure
      behavioural problems in drug trials in children for many years. This study in
      rural India aimed to validate a translated version of the CPRS-48 for use in a
      study of anti-epileptic drug side-effects. METHOD: The Scale was translated into 
      local dialect, back-translated, and piloted among healthy families. The revised
      version was then administered to mothers of 60 healthy children and 63 children
      with epilepsy. Tests of internal reliability, test-retest reliability and factor 
      analysis were performed. RESULTS: Cronbach's alpha ranged from 0.60 to 0.75 for
      the subscales, and correlation coefficients after retesting from 0.84 to 0.99.
      The overall factor structure was very similar to that reported in the original
      USA sample. CONCLUSION: The Bengali version of the CPRS-48 and its Hyperactivity 
      Index have validity for rural Bengali children, and the process demonstrates that
      such instruments can be usefully adapted for local purposes.

TI  - Effect of caffeine on clozapine pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 59-63
AB  - AIMS: To assess the effects of caffeine on the pharmacokinetics of clozapine in
      healthy volunteers. METHODS: This was an open label randomized crossover study in
      12 nonsmoking healthy male volunteers. The subjects received a single oral dose
      of 12.5 mg clozapine in each phase with or without concomitant intake of caffeine
      (mean dose: 550 mg day-1, range: 400-1000 mg day-1 ). Serum concentrations of
      clozapine and its metabolites desmethyl-clozapine and clozapine-N-oxide were
      measured during a 48 h period in each phase. In addition, serum concentrations of
      caffeine and the metabolite paraxanthine were monitored. RESULTS: A 19% increase 
      in mean clozapine AUC(0,infinity) (P=0.05) and a 14% decrease of mean oral
      clearance of clozapine were observed during concomitant intake of caffeine
      (P=0.05) compared with intake of only clozapine. Statistically significant
      decreases of mean ratios between AUC(0, 12h) for desmethyl-clozapine and
      AUC(0,12h) for clozapine (-18%), and between AUC(0,12h) for clozapine-N-oxide and
      AUC(0,12h) for clozapine (-23%) were observed during the caffeine phase (P=0.03
      and 0.02, respectively). Oral clearance of clozapine and the ratio AUC(0, 12h)
      for desmethyl-clozapine/AUC(0,12h) for clozapine were correlated with the
      paraxanthine/caffeine ratio in serum after intake of caffeine (rs=0.62; P=0.03
      and rs=0.77; P=0.003, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that
      caffeine in daily doses of 400-1000 mg inhibits the metabolism of clozapine to an
      extent that might be clinically significant in certain individuals.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic analysis of felodipine-grapefruit juice interaction based on an
      irreversible enzyme inhibition model.
PG  - 49-58
AB  - Aims Ingestion of grapefruit juice (GFJ) alters the pharmacokinetics of various
      orally administered drugs. Quantitative evaluation of this GFJ-drug interaction
      is required for the proper clinical management of patients. Methods Using
      felodipine as a model drug, we constructed a pharmacokinetic model based on
      irreversible inhibition of intestinal cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) by GFJ. We
      fitted previously published data [5, 6] for felodipine ER (extended release
      formulation) to the ratio of CLGI,int before and after grapefruit juice ingestion
      by nonlinear least-squares regression analysis to estimate the reaction rate
      constant between GFJ and CYP3A4 (K) and the elimination rate constant of CYP3A4
      (k ). RESULTS: The model gave a turnover rate of CYP3A4 of 0.0849 h-1,
      corresponding to a half-life of 8.16 h, in agreement with reported values. The
      AUC-time profiles of felodipine ER in the case of different amounts and schedules
      of GFJ ingestion were simulated using the parameter values estimated from the
      model. CONCLUSIONS: The modelling leads to the important conclusion that
      GFJ-felodipine interaction increases with increasing frequency and amount of GFJ 
      ingestion, and that an interval of 2-3 days between GFJ intake and felodipine
      administration is necessary if GFJ-felodipine interaction is to be avoided.

TI  - Relative potency of epidural to intrathecal clonidine differs between acute
      thermal pain and capsaicin-induced allodynia.
PG  - 57-64
AB  - Clonidine is approved in the US for epidural administration in the treatment of
      intractable neuropathic cancer pain, but is also administered intrathecally for
      this indication and both epidurally and intrathecally in the treatment of acute, 
      postoperative pain. The purpose of the current study was to estimate the relative
      potency of clonidine by epidural and intrathecal routes in the treatment of
      capsaicin-induced hyperalgesia and allodynia as a model of central
      hypersensitivity and of noxious heat as a model of acute pain. Twenty-four
      healthy volunteers were randomized to receive either intrathecal clonidine (75,
      150, or 300 micrograms) or epidural clonidine (150, 300, or 600 micrograms) and
      rated pain from a Peltier-controlled thermode at a lumbar, thoracic, and cervical
      dermatomal site before and after drug administration. In addition, they rated
      pain from intradermal capsaicin injections at a lumbar dermatome before and 60
      min after clonidine injection and described areas of hyperalgesia and allodynia
      to mechanical stimuli. Clonidine's effect differed with route of administration
      and modality of sensory testing. For acute thermal pain, intrathecal clonidine
      produced a dose-dependent analgesia with a lumbar>thoracic>cervical gradient,
      whereas only one dose of epidural clonidine reduced thermal pain and this was at 
      the thoracic testing site. In contrast, the potency of clonidine to reduce
      capsaicin-induced allodynia was similar between the two routes of injection, and 
      for hyperalgesia, clonidine was only slightly more potent after intrathecal than 
      epidural injection. These data support clinical studies from non-comparative
      trials and suggest there is a >6-fold potency ratio of intrathecal:epidural
      administration of clonidine for acute pain, but a <2-fold potency ratio for these
      routes for mechanical hypersensitivity.

TI  - Lofexidine for opiate detoxification: review of recent randomised and open
      controlled trials.
PG  - 337-48
AB  - The objective of this article was to review the data from recently published
      trials of lofexidine in the treatment of opiate withdrawal, with particular
      attention to evidence on efficacy, side-effects (particularly hypotension), and
      the acceptability of this new treatment to the patient population. The authors
      reviewed data contained within peer-reviewed published reports of clinical trials
      of lofexidine compared with detoxification using reducing doses of the opiate
      agonist methadone or the alpha-adrenergic agonist clonidine. Five published
      reports of clinical trials of lofexidine have been identified from peer-reviewed 
      journals in the eight years between 1990 and 1998--all published within the last 
      three years. Three of the reports compare lofexidine with clonidine, while the
      remaining two compare it with methadone detoxification. The three comparisons
      with clonidine find lofexidine to be similar in its moderating effect on the
      withdrawal syndrome, but without the same extent of problems with hypotension.
      Comparisons with methadone show a more rapid resolution of withdrawal symptoms
      with lofexidine--particularly with the accelerated 5-day lofexidine protocol.
      Such problems of hypotension as were encountered with lofexidine were adequately 
      managed with dose reduction. Acceptability of the treatment to the patient (as
      measured by retention in treatment) appears to be greater with lofexidine than
      clonidine, although possibly less than with methadone. Lofexidine is an alpha-2
      adrenergic agonist that is increasingly used in the management of opiate
      withdrawal--notably in the UK. The available data indicate that it is a useful
      new addition to the armamentarium of the clinician. Future studies should explore
      its application with improved protocols and in new treatment settings. This
      article reviews the recent advances in the study of lofexidine as a new treatment
      for opiate detoxification. It examines the background of the development and
      introduction of lofexidine into the U.K., with data on the extent to which it is 
      now used in the U.K. in the treatment of opiate addiction. A review is then
      provided of the published evidence on the use of lofexidine in the management of 
      opiate detoxification, mainly concentrating on the data from recent double-blind 
      randomised trials. Finally, the possible future role of lofexidine in this field 
      is considered.

TI  - Sexual dysfunction associated with the treatment of depression: a
      placebo-controlled comparison of bupropion sustained release and sertraline
      treatment.
PG  - 205-15
AB  - This study compared the sexual functioning effects as well as the safety and
      efficacy of bupropion sustained release (bupropion SR) and sertraline. Three
      hundred sixty-four patients with normal sexual functioning and recurrent major
      depression were treated with bupropion SR (150-400 mg/day), sertraline (50-200
      mg/day), or placebo for 8 weeks in this randomized, double-blind, multicenter
      study. Patients' depression, sexual functioning, and overall safety were assessed
      at regular clinic visits. Significantly (P < 0.05) more patients treated with
      sertraline experienced orgasm dysfunction compared with patients treated with
      bupropion SR or placebo. Bupropion SR, but not sertraline, was statistically
      significantly superior to placebo in improving scores on all depression scales by
      the end of the study. Headache occurred with similar frequency in all groups.
      Gastrointestinal disturbances occurred more frequently with sertraline; insomnia 
      and agitation occurred more frequently with bupropion SR. Small decreases in mean
      weight were seen with both active treatments; the placebo group experienced a
      minor increase in mean weight. Both bupropion SR and sertraline were generally
      well tolerated, although sertraline was more often associated with sexual
      dysfunction. Bupropion SR, but not sertraline, was statistically superior to
      placebo in relieving depression by the end of the study. Bupropion SR may offer
      advantages over sertraline in treating depressed patients concerned with sexual
      functioning.

TI  - [Adverse hemodynamic changes during laparoscopic cholecystectomy and their
      possible suppression with clonidine premedication. Comparison with intravenous
      and intramuscular premedication].
PG  - 286-91
AB  - Laparoscopic cholecystectomies have adverse haemodynamic effects which limit
      their use in risk patients with heart disease. This applies in particular to
      significant hypertension. The etiology is analysed in detail in a review of the
      literature. The authors confirmed in their work involving 21 patients the
      incidence of these effects and tried to suppress them by premedication with
      clonidine (CATAPRESAN, Boehringer). 21 patients were given 0.15 mg clonidine in
      an infusion 15 minutes before operation and 21 patients 0.15 mg clonidine by the 
      i.m. route 60-90 min. before operation. Standard anaesthesia was administered. A 
      highly significant drop in the incidence of hypertension was recorded during
      operation for systolic pressure (p < 0.001) after both ways of administration, as
      well as of diastolic pressure (p < 0.01 for intravenous and p < 0.05 for
      intramuscular premedication). Premedication with intravenous clonidine can be
      recommended as a routine procedure before laparoscopic cholecystectomies.

TI  - Double-blind methylphenidate trials: practical, useful, and highly endorsed by
      families.
PG  - 1292-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a 3-week, randomized, double-blind, methylphenidate
      placebo-controlled trial (MPT) in routine practice for children with
      attention-deficit disorder. PATIENTS AND METHODS: School-aged children with
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
      Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria) who enrolled an "N of 1" trial at a
      pediatric tertiary care center were eligible. Families (n = 50) with a child
      eligible for the MPT were given 3 bottles of identical capsules. The capsules
      contained, in random order: placebo of the prescribed dose of methylphenidate
      (Ritalin) hydrochloride (0.3 mg/kg or 0.6 mg/kg). Families gave the child 1
      capsule at 8 AM and 1 capsule at noon. The family, teacher, and physician were
      blinded for the order of medication. Conners questionnaires (Conners Parent
      Questionnaire and Conners Teacher Questionnaire) and written comments were
      completed by parents and teachers at baseline and at the end of each week. Once
      MPT results were known and following discussion with the physician, families
      decided whether to continue methylphenidate therapy. Families were interviewed by
      telephone 14 to 21 months after the MPT. RESULTS: Forty-three (86%) of the 50
      eligible children (mean age, 129 months) were contacted. No family found the MPT 
      difficult, but 6 trials were incomplete, usually because of side effects. All
      families used the MPT to decide if methylphenidate was the correct treatment
      choice for their child and 68% (34 of 50 families) used the results exclusively. 
      The remaining 16 families believed the MPT was helpful. Overall, 31 (72%) of the 
      43 children had a good response to methylphenidate treatment--20 (47%) continued 
      to use it for longer than 12 months and 8 (26%) for 2 to 12 months; 3 responders 
      chose not to use it after the MPT. Nine of the 43 families chose not to use
      methylphenidate treatment; however, all indicated that participating in the MPT
      helped them to make that decision. In follow-up interviews, the same proportion
      of methylphenidate users and nonusers reported improvement in many areas of
      function including significantly less time spent doing homework. Users reported
      reduced aggression (P<.001) and fewer discipline problems (P<.01) compared with
      nonusers. CONCLUSIONS: An "N of 1" MPT was easily performed and permitted
      families to decide whether to use methylphenidate for long-term treatment of
      attention-deficit disorder or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
      Regardless of methylphenidate use or lack of use, the condition of all of these
      children was improved at follow-up.

TI  - Moderators and mediators of treatment response for children with
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: the Multimodal Treatment Study of
      children with Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - 1088-96
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intent-to-treat analyses of the study revealed that medication
      management, alone or combined with intensive behavioral treatment, was superior
      to behavioral treatment and community care in reducing
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms; but only combined
      treatment showed consistently greater benefit than community care across other
      outcome domains (disruptive and internalizing symptoms, achievement, parent-child
      relations, and social skills). We examine response patterns in subgroups defined 
      by baseline variables (moderators) or variables related to treatment
      implementation (mediators). METHODS: We reconducted random-effects regression
      (RR) analyses, adding factors defined by moderators (sex, prior medication use,
      comorbid disruptive or anxiety disorder, and public assistance) and a mediator
      (treatment acceptance/attendance). RESULTS: Study outcomes (N = 579) were upheld 
      in most moderator subgroups (boys and girls, children with and without prior
      medication, children with and without comorbid disruptive disorders). Comorbid
      anxiety disorder did moderate outcome; in participants without anxiety, results
      paralleled intent-to-treat findings. For those with anxiety disorders, however,
      behavioral treatment yielded significantly better outcomes than community care
      (and was no longer statistically different from medication management and
      combined treatment) regarding ADHD-related and internalizing symptoms. In
      families receiving public assistance, medication management yielded decreased
      closeness in parent-child interactions, and combined treatment yielded relatively
      greater benefits for teacher-reported social skills. In families with high
      treatment acceptance/attendance, intent-to-treat results were upheld.
      Acceptance/attendance was particularly important for medication treatments.
      Finally, two thirds of children given community care received stimulants.
      Behavioral treatment did not significantly differ from, but medication management
      was superior to, this subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: Exploratory analyses revealed that
      our study (the Multimodal Treatment Study of Children With
      Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder [MTA]) results were confirmed across
      most baseline variables and treatment acceptance/attendance. In children with
      ADHD plus anxiety, behavioral treatment surpassed community care and approached
      medication-based treatments regarding parent-reported ADHD symptoms.

      Treatment Study of Children with ADHD.
PG  - 1073-86
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated the short-term efficacy of
      pharmacotherapy and behavior therapy for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
      (ADHD), but no longer-term (i.e., >4 months) investigations have compared these 2
      treatments or their combination. METHODS: A group of 579 children with ADHD
      Combined Type, aged 7 to 9.9 years, were assigned to 14 months of medication
      management (titration followed by monthly visits); intensive behavioral treatment
      (parent, school, and child components, with therapist involvement gradually
      reduced over time); the two combined; or standard community care (treatments by
      community providers). Outcomes were assessed in multiple domains before and
      during treatment and at treatment end point (with the combined treatment and
      medication management groups continuing medication at all assessment points).
      Data were analyzed through intent-to-treat random-effects regression procedures. 
      RESULTS: All 4 groups showed sizable reductions in symptoms over time, with
      significant differences among them in degrees of change. For most ADHD symptoms, 
      children in the combined treatment and medication management groups showed
      significantly greater improvement than those given intensive behavioral treatment
      and community care. Combined and medication management treatments did not differ 
      significantly on any direct comparisons, but in several instances
      (oppositional/aggressive symptoms, internalizing symptoms, teacher-rated social
      skills, parent-child relations, and reading achievement) combined treatment
      proved superior to intensive behavioral treatment and/or community care while
      medication management did not. Study medication strategies were superior to
      community care treatments, despite the fact that two thirds of community-treated 
      subjects received medication during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: For ADHD
      symptoms, our carefully crafted medication management was superior to behavioral 
      treatment and to routine community care that included medication. Our combined
      treatment did not yield significantly greater benefits than medication management
      for core ADHD symptoms, but may have provided modest advantages for non-ADHD
      symptom and positive functioning outcomes.

TI  - Oral clonidine premedication enhances postoperative analgesia by epidural
      morphine.
PG  - 1487-91
AB  - This study was designed to evaluate the effects of oral clonidine premedication
      on postoperative analgesia by epidural morphine in a prospective, randomized,
      double-blinded design. Sixty consenting patients, scheduled for total abdominal
      hysterectomy, were randomly assigned to one of three groups (n = 20 each); the
      clonidine-morphine group received oral clonidine 5 microg/kg 90 min before
      arriving in the operating room and epidural morphine 2 mg before induction of
      general anesthesia, the clonidine-placebo group received oral clonidine 5
      microg/kg and no epidural morphine, and the placebo-morphine group received no
      clonidine and epidural morphine 2 mg. An epidural catheter was placed at the L1-2
      or L2-3 interspace, and 1.5% lidocaine was used for surgical anesthesia in all
      patients. General anesthesia was then induced with propofol, and maintained with 
      a continuous infusion of propofol and 67% nitrous oxide in oxygen during surgery.
      Four patients were subsequently withdrawn from the study. After surgery,
      patient-controlled analgesia using IV morphine was used to assess analgesic
      requirement. Morphine consumptions determined every 6 h after surgery in the
      clonidine-morphine and placebo-morphine groups were significantly less than the
      clonidine-placebo group until 12 h after surgery, whereas those of the
      clonidine-morphine group were significantly less than the placebo-morphine group 
      from 13 to 42 h after surgery. Visual analog (pain) scale (VAS) scores in the
      clonidine-morphine group were significantly lower than the placebo-morphine group
      at 48 h at rest, and at 1, 24, 36, and 48 h with movement. Similarly, VAS scores 
      in the clonidine-morphine group were significantly lower than the
      clonidine-placebo group at 1 and 6 h both at rest and with movement, whereas VAS 
      scores in the clonidine-placebo group were significantly lower than the
      placebo-morphine group at 24, 36, and 48 h at rest and with movement. The
      incidence of nausea and pruritus was similar between groups. We conclude that the
      combination of oral clonidine and epidural morphine produces more potent and
      longer lasting postoperative analgesia than either drug alone without increasing 
      the incidence of adverse effects after major gynecologic surgeries. IMPLICATIONS:
      A small dose of epidural morphine is often used for postoperative analgesia. We
      found that oral clonidine premedication 5 microg/kg improves the analgesic
      efficacy of epidural morphine without increasing the incidence of adverse side
      effects.

TI  - Pharmacological treatment of depression. Consulting with Dr Oscar.
PG  - 2663-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacological treatment of depression and to evaluate 
      current strategies for treatment to maximize the benefits of antidepressant
      medications. QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: MEDLINE was searched to January 1999, using the
      headings depression, combination, augmentation, lithium, triiodothyronine,
      pindolol, buspirone, methylphenidate, and electroconvulsive therapy, for
      randomized controlled trials, systematic overviews, and consensus reports. Recent
      high-quality reviews were often found. References from papers retrieved were
      scrutinized for other relevant reports. Preference was given to more recent
      articles and well-designed studies. Recommendations from academic groups were
      analyzed. MAIN MESSAGE: Optimization of antidepressant therapy is the cornerstone
      of pharmacological treatment of depression. When symptoms persist despite
      optimization, further strategies include substitution, combination, augmentation,
      and reviewing and sometimes referring. Decisions are based on the evidence
      supporting the various strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Antidepressants will work only if
      prescribed correctly. Awareness of the strategies for using antidepressants and
      evaluating their effectiveness improves primary care physicians' ability to treat
      this common disorder.

TI  - Interscalene brachial plexus analgesia after open shoulder surgery: continuous
      versus patient-controlled infusion.
PG  - 1216-20
AB  - In this prospective, randomized, double-blinded study, we assessed the efficacy
      of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) for continuous interscalene analgesia after
      open shoulder surgery. Sixty patients were divided into three groups of 20.
      During a 48-h period, they received, via an interscalene catheter, a continuous
      infusion of 0.125% bupivacaine with sufentanil 0.1 microg/mL and clonidine 1
      microg/mL at 10 mL /h in Group 1; a continuous infusion of the same solution at 5
      mL/h plus PCA boluses (2.5 mL/30 min) in Group 2; and only PCA boluses (5 mL/30
      min) of the same solution in Group 3. Pain scores, sensory block, supplemental
      analgesia, bupivacaine consumption, side effects, and satisfaction scores were
      recorded. At 24 and 48 h, sensory block was more frequent and pain control was
      significantly better in Groups 1 and 2 than in Group 3 (P < 0.001). In Group 3,
      larger doses of paracetamol were required. Bupivacaine consumption was
      significantly less in Groups 2 and 3 than in Group 1 (P < 0.001). Satisfaction
      was significantly higher in Groups 1 and 2 than in Group 3 (P < 0.01). Side
      effects were comparable in the three groups. We conclude that continuous
      interscalene analgesia requires a background infusion after open shoulder
      surgery. Because it reduces the local anesthetic consumption and allows the
      patients to rapidly reinforce the block shortly before physiotherapy, a basal
      infusion rate of 5 mL/h combined with PCA boluses (2.5 mL/ 30 min) is the
      recommended technique. IMPLICATIONS: In this study, we demonstrated that
      continuous interscalene analgesia requires a background infusion to provide
      efficient pain relief after open shoulder surgery. A basal infusion of 5 mL/h
      combined with patient-controlled analgesia boluses (2.5 mL/30 min) seems to be
      the most appropriate technique.

TI  - Antipsychotic-induced weight gain: a comprehensive research synthesis.
PG  - 1686-96
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to estimate and compare the effects of
      antipsychotics-both the newer ones and the conventional ones-on body weight.
      Method: A comprehensive literature search identified 81 English- and
      non-English-language articles that included data on weight change in
      antipsychotic-treated patients. For each agent, a meta-analysis and random
      effects metaregression estimated the weight change after 10 weeks of treatment at
      a standard dose. A comprehensive narrative review was also conducted on all
      articles that did not yield quantitative information but did yield important
      qualitative information. RESULTS: Placebo was associated with a mean weight
      reduction of 0.74 kg. Among conventional agents, mean weight change ranged from a
      reduction of 0.39 kg with molindone to an increase of 3.19 kg with thioridazine. 
      Among newer antipsychotic agents, mean increases were as follows: clozapine, 4.45
      kg; olanzapine, 4.15 kg; sertindole, 2.92 kg; risperidone, 2.10 kg; and
      ziprasidone, 0.04 kg. Insufficient data were available to evaluate quetiapine at 
      10 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Both conventional and newer antipsychotics are associated 
      with weight gain. Among the newer agents, clozapine appears to have the greatest 
      potential to induce weight gain, and ziprasidone the least. The differences among
      newer agents may affect compliance with medication and health risk.

TI  - Olanzapine compared to lithium in mania: a double-blind randomized controlled
      trial.
PG  - 339-43
AB  - Neuroleptics are of established efficacy in mania. Controlled data on the use of 
      olanzapine in mania is however, absent. In this study, 30 patients meeting DSM-IV
      criteria for mania were randomly allocated to receive either olanzapine or
      lithium in a 4 week double-blind randomized controlled design. There were no
      significant outcome differences between the two groups on any of the primary
      outcome measures, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (lithium 28.2; olanzapine
      28.0; P = 0.44); Clinical Global Impression (CGI) improvement scale (lithium
      2.75, olanzapine 2.36; P = 0.163) or the Mania Scale (lithium 13.2, olanzapine
      10.2; P = 0.315). Olanzapine was however, significantly superior to lithium on
      the CGI-severity scale at week 4 (lithium 2.83, olanzapine 2.29; P = 0.025).
      Olanzapine did not differ from lithium in terms of treatment emergent
      extrapyramidal side-effects as measured by the Simpson-Angus Scale. Olanzapine
      appears to be at least as effective as lithium in the treatment of mania.

TI  - Diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and use of psychotropic
      medication in very young children.
PG  - 1039-45
AB  - CONTEXT: Increases in diagnosis and treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
      disorder (ADHD) have elicited public and professional concern. Research suggests 
      that this trend warrants the inclusion of previously underdiagnosed children and 
      adults. It is not clear whether this trend includes young children. OBJECTIVE: To
      identify patterns of diagnosis and treatment of ADHD in very young children over 
      time. DESIGN: Descriptive study of Michigan Medicaid claims data. PATIENTS:
      Inclusion criteria included recorded ADHD diagnosis, continuous Medicaid
      eligibility during a 15-month period, and age 3 years or younger at the first
      date of service. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diagnoses of ADHD, conditions commonly
      comorbid with ADHD, other chronic health conditions, and injuries; treatments
      such as psychological services and psychotropic medication; and the number of
      ambulatory visits. RESULTS: We identified 223 children aged 3 years or younger
      diagnosed with ADHD. Many had conditions commonly comorbid with ADHD (44%), other
      chronic health conditions (41%), and injuries (40%). More than half received
      psychotropic medication (57%); fewer received psychological services (27%).
      Twenty-two different psychotropic medications were used. Patterns included more
      than 1 psychotropic medication (46%) in 30 combinations of simultaneous use and
      44 combinations of sequential use. The mean number of ambulatory visits was 18.
      CONCLUSIONS: Children aged 3 years or younger had ADHD diagnosed and received
      markedly variable psychotropic medication regimens. Little information is
      available to guide these practices. The presence of comorbid conditions and
      injuries attests to these children's vulnerability. Resources must be identified 
      that will enable physicians to better respond to the compelling needs of these
      children and their families.

TI  - Treatment of depression in patients with heart disease.
PG  - 34-7
AB  - Patients with depression are more likely than patients without depression to
      develop ischemic heart disease and suffer cardiac-related death. Recent evidence 
      suggests that the association between depression and increased cardiac mortality 
      may in part be due to an increase in platelet activity and an imbalance in
      sympathetic and parasympathetic activity that makes the patient more susceptible 
      to ventricular fibrillation. Available data suggest that the tricyclic
      antidepressants (TCAs) may increase the risk of mortality in patients with
      ischemic heart disease. Three studies with the selective serotonin reuptake
      inhibitors (SSRIs), including a double-blind, randomized comparison of paroxetine
      with nortriptyline, support the conclusion that the SSRIs have a relatively
      benign cardiovascular profile. Therefore, they are preferable to the TCAs for
      treatment of depression in patients at risk for cardiac events. Additional
      studies are needed to definitively establish the cardiovascular safety of the
      SSRIs.

AB  - Multiple dependent variables were graphed for 29 subjects who participated in a
      double-blind evaluation of 4 doses of Adderall, plus positive (methylphenidate)
      and placebo control conditions. Five judges ranked the conditions for each
      subject, and analyses of individual subjects indicated that these rankings were
      concordant (reliable) across judges. Consensus rankings were assigned to each
      subject, and an analysis of these ranks showed that the conditions differed
      significantly. The choice of best conditions were judged to be across 3 doses of 
      Adderall (10, 15, and 20 mg). This confirms the clinical impression of individual
      differences in optimal dose of stimulant medication. The methodological,
      graphical, and statistical methods presented in this article provide a
      systematic, reliable procedure for evaluating relative response of individuals to
      different doses of stimulant medication.

TI  - Controlled, double-blind investigation of the clozapine discontinuation symptoms 
      with conversion to either olanzapine or placebo. The Collaborative Crossover
      Study Group.
PG  - 435-43
AB  - The abrupt appearance of clozapine discontinuation symptoms represents a
      particularly unique situation that has not been characterized in a double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled trial. A randomized, double-blind comparison of placebo (N =
      53) and olanzapine 10 mg (N = 53) for 3 to 5 days following the abrupt
      discontinuation of clozapine (< 300 mg/day) was carried out. Subjects were
      assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Clinical
      Global Impression Scale of Severity, the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating
      Scale (MADRS), and the Mini-Mental State Evaluation. Subsequently both groups
      received open-label olanzapine (10-25 mg/day) for an additional 9 weeks.
      Statistically significantly more placebo-treated (24.5%) than olanzapine-treated 
      (7.5%) patients experienced clozapine discontinuation symptoms (p = 0.017). Core 
      symptoms included delusions, hallucinations, hostility, and paranoid reaction and
      translated into a significantly higher worsening from baseline on the PANSS
      total, PANSS General Psychopathology subscale, and MADRS among subjects randomly 
      assigned to receive placebo. After open-label treatment with olanzapine for 9
      weeks, both groups were clinically stable, suggesting that the discontinuation
      symptoms were transient. However, subjects who had been randomly assigned to the 
      3- to 5-day placebo discontinuation segment achieved somewhat less global
      clinical improvement. Although a pharmacologic interpretation is speculative,
      evidence of a clozapine discontinuation syndrome was apparent. In most cases, the
      direct substitution of a pharmacologically similar agent (olanzapine) prevented
      the syndrome. Clozapine discontinuation or noncompliance should be considered in 
      the differential assessment of an acutely emergent psychosis. The possibility
      that subjects who experience a clozapine discontinuation syndrome may take longer
      or are less likely to clinically restabilize warrants further investigation.

TI  - Precision and comparability of adverse event rates of newer antidepressants.
PG  - 416-26
AB  - Due to the scarcity of clinical trials (CTs) directly comparing newer
      antidepressants, clinicians and reviewers often compare drugs on the basis of
      active drug and placebo-subtracted adverse event rates (AERs) published in
      references such as the Physician's Desk Reference in the United States, the
      Compendium of Pharmaceutical Specialities in Canada, and product monographs. This
      study examined the suitability of the above data and methods for comparing AERs
      of nine newer antidepressants: bupropion, citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine,
      moclobemide, nefazodone, paroxetine, sertraline, and venlafaxine. First, the
      authors examined data precision and comparability across drugs by analyzing
      placebo-arm AERs and their 95% confidence limits for each drug and by testing the
      homogeneity of placebo-arm AERs across drugs. The rationale was that placebo AER 
      heterogeneity is likely a reflection of heterogeneity of nonpharmacologic factors
      among CTs. For all 16 adverse events examined, placebo AERs were found to be
      significantly heterogenous, suggesting significant nonpharmacologic heterogeneity
      across drugs. Second, using placebo AER heterogeneity as a measure of
      nonpharmacologic heterogeneity, the authors estimated the degree to which active 
      drug and placebo-subtracted AERs were related to nonpharmacologic heterogeneity
      by estimating the degree of association between active drug and placebo AERs and 
      between placebo-subtracted and placebo AERs. Also, 95% confidence limits for
      placebo-subtracted AERs were calculated. It was found that most active drug AERs 
      and some placebo-subtracted AERs were significantly correlated with placebo AERs,
      suggesting a relationship with nonpharmacologic heterogeneity. Placebo-subtracted
      AERs were less strongly related than were active drug AERs. Finally, the authors 
      discuss factors that may be associated with the observed heterogeneity and offer 
      suggestions that may improve the methodology and reporting of CTs.

TI  - Risperidone in treatment-refractory schizophrenia.
PG  - 1374-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical safety and
      efficacy of risperidone compared to haloperidol in patients with
      treatment-refractory schizophrenia. METHOD: Sixty-seven medication-unresponsive
      subjects were randomly assigned to treatment with risperidone (N = 34) or
      haloperidol (N = 33). After a 3-7 day-placebo washout period, there was a 4-week,
      double-blind, fixed-dose comparison trial that was followed by a 4-week,
      flexible-dose phase. Measures of clinical change were quantified by standard
      psychopathologic and neuromotor instruments. RESULTS: Risperidone demonstrated
      clinical efficacy superior to that of haloperidol on the total Brief Psychiatric 
      Rating Scale (BPRS) after the first 4 weeks of treatment. Risperidone did not
      show any advantage over haloperidol after an additional 4 weeks. Overall
      improvement on the BPRS at 4 weeks was significantly better for the risperidone
      group (24%) than for the haloperidol group (11%). Risperidone-treated subjects
      were significantly less likely than haloperidol-treated subjects to require
      concomitant anticholinergic medication after 4 weeks (20% versus 63%); they also 
      had significantly les observable akathisia (24% versus 53%) and significantly
      less severe tardive dyskinesia. Baseline characteristics that correlated
      significantly with risperidone response were positive symptoms, conceptual
      disorganization, akathisia, and tardive dyskinesia. CONCLUSIONS: Risperidone was 
      better tolerated and more effective in a subset of patients with
      treatment-refractory schizophrenia. Positive psychotic symptoms and
      extrapyramidal side effects at baseline appear to be powerful predictors of
      subsequent response to risperidone.

TI  - Intravenous regional anesthesia using lidocaine and clonidine.
PG  - 654-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clonidine has been added to local anesthetic regimens for various
      peripheral nerve blocks, resulting in prolonged anesthesia and analgesia. The
      authors postulated that using clonidine as a component of intravenous regional
      anesthesia (IVRA) would enhance postoperative analgesia. METHODS: Forty-five
      patients undergoing ambulatory hand surgery received IVRA with lidocaine, 0.5%,
      and were assigned randomly and blindly to three groups. The control group
      received intravenous saline, the intravenous clonidine group received 1 microg/kg
      clonidine intravenously, and the IVRA clonidine group received 1 microg/kg
      clonidine as part of the IVRA solution. After their operations, the patients'
      pain and sedation scores and analgesic use were recorded. RESULTS: Patients in
      the IVRA clonidine group had a significantly longer period of subjective comfort 
      when they required no analgesics (median [range]) for 460 min (215-1,440 min),
      compared with 115 min (14-390 min) for the control group and 125 min (17-295 min)
      for the intravenous clonidine group (P<0.0001). The patients who received IVRA
      with clonidine reported significantly lower pain scores 1 and 2 h after
      tourniquet deflation compared with the other groups, and they required no
      fentanyl in the postanesthesia care unit. They also required fewer analgesic
      tablets (325 mg acetaminophen with 30 mg codeine) in the first 24 h (2+/-1, mean 
      +/- SD) compared with the other two groups, 5+/-1 tablets (control) and 4+/-2
      tablets (intravenous clonidine) (P<0.0001). No significant postoperative
      sedation, hypotension, or bradycardia developed in any of the patients.
      CONCLUSION: The addition of 1 microg/kg clonidine to lidocaine, 0.5%, for IVRA in
      patients undergoing ambulatory hand surgery improves postoperative analgesia
      without causing significant side effects during the first postoperative day.

TI  - The treatment of tardive dyskinesia--a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 1-16; discussion 17-8
AB  - This systematic review aimed to collate randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of
      various interventions used to treat tardive dyskinesia (TD) and, where
      appropriate, to combine the data for meta-analysis. Clinical trials were
      identified by electronic searches, handsearches and contact with principal
      investigators. Data were extracted independently by two reviewers, for outcomes
      related to improvement, deterioration, side-effects and drop out rates. Data were
      pooled using the Mantel-Haenzel Odds Ratio (fixed effect model). For treatments
      that had significant effects, the number needed to treat (NNT) was calculated.
      From 296 controlled clinical trials, data were extracted from 47 trials. For most
      interventions, we could identify no RCT-derived evidence of efficacy. A
      meta-analysis showed that baclofen, deanol and diazepam were no more effective
      than a placebo. Single RCTs demonstrated a lack of evidence of any effect for
      bromocriptine, ceruletide, clonidine, estrogen, gamma linolenic acid, hydergine, 
      lecithin, lithium, progabide, seligiline and tetrahydroisoxazolopyridinol. The
      meta-analysis found that five interventions were effective: L-dopa, oxypertine,
      sodium valproate, tiapride and vitamin E; neuroleptic reduction was marginally
      significant. Data from single RCTs revealed that insulin, alpha methyl dopa and
      reserpine were more effective than a placebo. There was a significantly increased
      risk of adverse events associated with baclofen, deanol, L-dopa, oxypertine and
      reserpine. Meta-analysis of the impact of placebo (n=485) showed that 37.3% of
      participants showed an improvement. Interpretation of this systematic review
      requires caution as the individual trials identified tended to have small sample 
      sizes. For many compounds, data from only one trial were available, and where
      meta-analyses were possible, these were based on a small number of trials.
      Despite these concerns, the review facilitated the interpretation of the large
      and diverse range of treatments used for TD. Clinical recommendations for the
      treatment of TD are made, based on the availability of RCT-derived evidence, the 
      strength of that evidence and the presence of adverse effects.

AB  - Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is often diagnosed in children.
      Some major studies proved that symptoms can persist until the patients are grown 
      up and that the prevalence of adult ADHD is underestimated. The classification
      systems ICD-10 and DSM-IV allow a diagnosis for adults, they differ, however,
      from childhood regarding symptoms. The diagnostic procedure requires extensive
      exploration and information from parents and school. Diagnostic interview
      procedures and questionnaires for self and expert rating are available to date
      only for English speaking countries. Apart from counselling and psychotherapeutic
      intervention pharmacotherapy is a third option. Especially stimulants proved to
      be an efficient treatment. Alternatively tricyclic antidepressants can be
      considered, other agents play only a minor role. Clinical trials trying to
      evaluate the efficacy of different pharmacotherapeutic agents are lacking.

TI  - [Preoperative clonidine comedication within the scope of balanced inhalation
      anesthesia with sevoflurane in oral surgery procedures].
PG  - 65-70
AB  - Both clonidine and sevoflurane are interesting drugs for anaesthesia in
      maxillo-facial surgery. The present study was performed to discover how far it is
      possible to combine the benefits of sevoflurane (fast modulation of depth of
      anaesthesia, rapid emergence and recovery) and clonidine (reduction of
      perioperative stress response, prophylaxis of postoperative shivering, analgetic,
      antiemetic and anaesthetic-saving effect) without compromising the
      pharmacokinetic of sevoflurane. Twenty-eight patients were included in the
      present double-blinded prospective study. These patients were randomly treated
      with an infusion of 4 micrograms kg-1 clonidine (group 1) or a placebo (group 2) 
      preoperatively. For anaesthesia a standardized procedure with fentanyl, propofol,
      rocuronium, N2O/O2/sevoflurane and an antiemetic prophylaxis with DHB was
      performed. The depth of anaesthesia was controlled by using spectral edge
      frequency (target--SEF90 = 10 Hz). Perioperative stress response was assessed by 
      noting the effects on haemodynamic parameters (MAP, heart rate), and emergence
      and recovery were assessed by using established standardized tests. We confirmed 
      the anaesthetic-saving property of clonidine only for fentanyl (-20%). On the
      other hand, there was no difference in MAC-sevoflurane values between the groups 
      in keeping a steady target--SEF90 (1.62 +/- 0.26 versus 1.65 +/- 0.24 vol.%). The
      time until emergence and recovery was not significantly different. Even the
      occurrence of PONV, the VAS level or the postoperative analgesic requirement did 
      not differ in the two groups. However, the incidence of postoperative shivering
      was significantly higher in the placebo group. The stress response to intubation 
      or extubation was lower in the clonidine group. The haemodynamic parameters in
      the clonidine group were intraoperatively always below the baseline, in some
      cases by more than 20%, making therapy for hypotension or bradycardia frequently 
      necessary. Postoperatively, the majority of the patients showed similar changes
      in these parameters, but did not reach the 20% mark. Preoperative clonidine
      comedication seems to complicate the management of anaesthesia. On the other
      hand, it is beneficial during the early postoperative period (e.g. stability in
      haemodynamics, prophylaxis of shivering) without compromising emergence and
      recovery. Our results show that therapy with clonidine should be better placed at
      the end of anaesthesia.

TI  - Safety of amisulpride (Solian): a review of 11 clinical studies.
PG  - 209-18
AB  - We assessed the overall safety profile of amisulpride based on the results from
      11 clinical studies performed in patients suffering from schizophrenia with
      predominance of positive or negative symptoms. A total of 1933 patients were
      randomly assigned to treatment with amisulpride (n = 1247) or haloperidol (n =
      309), risperidone (n = 113), flupentixol (n = 62) and placebo (n = 202). Safety
      data collection was performed using open reporting, UKU scales or specific
      extrapyramidal side-effect scales; electrocardiogram recording and vital signs
      examination; laboratory data collection. Amisulpride demonstrated a satisfactory 
      global safety profile in the range of doses usually prescribed. The number of
      patients having at least one extrapyramidal side-effect was higher in haloperidol
      patients compared with both amisulpride and risperidone patients (50% versus 30% 
      in the two latter groups). For endocrine events, a similar rate was observed
      between amisulpride and risperidone groups (4% versus 6%, respectively) versus 1%
      in the haloperidol group. Electrocardiogram results were satisfactory, confirmed 
      by the absence of cardiovascular events. The overall laboratory safety profile of
      amisulpride did not show clinically relevant abnormalities in liver function
      tests nor haematological abnormalities. Our extensive clinical data confirm the
      satisfactory safety profile of amisulpride which is superior to standard
      reference compounds.

TI  - Development of depression during placebo-controlled trials of bupropion for
      smoking cessation: case reports.
PG  - 436-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent attention has focused on the relationship between depression
      and smoking cessation. This article describes 5 cases of severe depression that
      occurred during 2 multicenter trials using bupropion for smoking cessation.
      METHOD: Subjects were participants in 2 randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled studies investigating the efficacy of bupropion for smoking
      cessation. Data from both trials were restricted to subjects at the Rochester,
      Minn., site in order to have access to the medical records for information on
      depression diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. The first trial involved 205
      smokers who received active bupropion or placebo for 7 weeks. In the second
      trial, 252 smokers received open-label bupropion therapy for 7 weeks. Those
      abstinent from smoking at the end of week 7 (N = 148) were randomly assigned to a
      45-week, double-blind, relapse-prevention phase. RESULTS: In the first trial, 1
      of the 205 participants (0.49%) experienced major depression during the 7-week
      treatment phase. In the second trial, none of the 252 subjects developed major
      depression during the 7-week, open-label phase. When results of both trials
      across the 7-week treatment phase (study 1, N = 205; study 2, N = 252) are
      combined, the rate of developing major depression was 0.22% (1 of 457). Of the
      457 subjects, none of the 51 who received placebo and 1 (0.25%) of the 406 who
      received active bupropion developed major depression. In the second trial, 4
      (2.7%) of the 148 subjects randomly assigned to the 45-week, relapse-prevention
      phase developed depression. Overall, 4 of the 5 cases from the 2 trials had a
      past history of major depression prior to study entry, but none had current major
      depression. CONCLUSION: Major depression may occur in some individuals during
      smoking cessation treatment with bupropion.

TI  - Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials with
      non-prescription medications for the treatment of obesity.
PG  - 370-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Phenylpropanolamine (PPA) and benzocaine are non-prescription
      medications approved for treating obesity. The dose of PPA for weight loss is 75 
      mg/day. PPA has the same chemical similarity to pseudoephedrine that amphetamine 
      has to methamphetamine. Because benzocaine causes weight loss by altering taste
      and PPA by central appetite suppression, they may induce additional weight loss
      when combined. These studies explore the safety and efficacy of low-dose PPA,
      pseudoephedrine, and PPA with benzocaine in causing weight loss. RESEARCH METHODS
      AND PROCEDURES: Study 1 compared PPA 12.5 mg tid with 25 mg tid and placebo in a 
      6-week trial in 108 obese subjects. Study 2 compared pseudoephedrine 120 mg/day
      and a placebo in a 12-week trial with 72 obese subjects. Study 3 compared 4
      groups of 20 obese subjects using PPA 75 mg/day, benzocaine gum 96 mg/day, PPA
      with benzocaine gum, and a placebo over 12 weeks. RESULTS: Both doses of PPA gave
      twice the weight loss of placebo, but the difference did not reach statistical
      significance. Pseudoephedrine was no different than placebo in inducing weight
      loss. The PPA with benzocaine group had more adverse events than the benzocaine
      group (p = 0.03), the placebo group (p = 0.03), or the PPA group (p = 0.09)
      without additional weight loss. DISCUSSION: We conclude that further studies with
      low-dose PPA for weight loss are indicated, that pseudoephedrine is not effective
      for weight loss, and that adding benzocaine to phenylpropanolamine increases
      adverse effects without increasing weight loss.

TI  - A comparison of olanzapine with haloperidol in cannabis-induced psychotic
      disorder: a double-blind randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 177-80
AB  - Little controlled data exist on the treatment of substance induced psychotic
      disorders. In this study, 30 patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for cannabis
      induced psychotic disorder were randomly allocated to receive either olanzapine
      or haloperidol in a 4-week double-blind clinical trial. There were no significant
      outcome differences between the two groups on any of the primary outcome
      measures, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (haloperidol 25.7; olanzapine 27.1; 
      P = 0.70); Clinical Global Impression (CGI) severity scale (haloperidol 1.8,
      olanzapine 2.3; P = 0.21) or the CGI improvement scale (haloperidol 1.3,
      olanzapine 1.7; P = 0.16). The haloperidol group however, developed significantly
      more extrapyramidal side-effects as measured by the Simpson Angus Scale
      (haloperidol 11.4, olanzapine 2.5; P = 0.014). Significantly (P = 0.027) more
      biperidin was used for extrapyramidal side-effects in the haloperidol (7.143 mg) 
      than in the olanzapine (0.357 mg) group. Olanzapine appears to be as effective as
      haloperidol in the treatment of cannabis induced psychotic disorder, but is
      associated with a lower rate of extrapyramidal side-effects.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling of risperidone effects on
      electroencephalography in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 272-8
AB  - RATIONALE: CNS-active drugs produce specific electroencephalographic changes and 
      the concentration-effect relationship of antipsychotics may be elucidated by
      adopting electroencephalography (EEG) as an effect measurement tool. OBJECTIVE:
      The purpose of the present study was to determine the concentration-effect
      relationship of risperidone by assessing the EEG effect after oral
      administrations of single dose risperidone in healthy young males. METHODS: Nine 
      healthy male volunteers received a 1 mg single oral dose of risperidone according
      to a placebo controlled crossover design. Plasma levels of risperidone and its
      active metabolite 9-hydroxyrisperidone were measured by radioimmunoassay.
      Quantitative EEG parameters were obtained for each of four frequency bands
      through spectral EEG analysis. The difference in the absolute power in the delta 
      frequency band for the F3 lead between risperidone and placebo was used as a drug
      effect parameter. For pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling, the hypothetical 
      effect compartment kinetically linked to plasma by a first-order process was
      postulated. All curve fittings were done with the non-linear curve-fitting
      program NONLIN. RESULTS: Our results showed that absolute powers in delta and
      theta frequency bands were higher for risperidone administration than for placebo
      at all EEG leads, and the maximum effects were detected at about 3 h after
      administration of the drug. The hysteresis loop was observed in the plot of
      plasma concentration of risperidone or sum of risperidone and
      9-hydroxyrisperidone (Cp) versus EEG effect for each subject. A linear model
      adequately described the relationship between the effect compartment
      concentrations (Ce) and EEG effects, and the two limbs of hysteresis in the
      Cp-effect plot were collapsed in the Ce-effect plot for risperidone or
      risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone. CONCLUSION: The increases of absolute
      power for delta and theta frequency bands of EEG were induced by single oral
      administration of risperidone. The linear PK-PD model fit well with the
      relationship between effect compartment concentrations (Ce) and EEG effects of
      risperidone.

TI  - Neuropeptide Y response to tracheal intubation in anaesthetized children: effects
      of clonidine vs midazolam as premedication.
PG  - 391-4
AB  - We have determined if tracheal intubation causes an increase in neuropeptide Y
      (NPY), a marker of major adrenergic activation, and investigated if rectal
      premedication with clonidine 2.5 micrograms kg-1 might be capable of attenuating 
      the stress response to tracheal intubation compared with midazolam 300 micrograms
      kg-1, in 20 paediatric patients (1-9 yr). Prospective randomization was performed
      in a double-blind manner. After induction of anaesthesia with 1% isoflurane,
      tracheal intubation was performed, and norepinephrine, NPY concentrations and
      haemodynamic variables were recorded. Tracheal intubation did not increase NPY
      plasma concentrations, despite transient increases in norepinephrine
      concentrations, heart rate and arterial pressure. There was no significant
      difference between the two groups. We conclude that the adrenergic stress
      reaction in response to tracheal intubation in children was short-lived and of
      limited magnitude, as indicated by the lack of NPY release.

      hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - 775-85
AB  - Sources of individual variation in plasma methylphenidate (MP) concentrations
      during usual clinical use are not established. This was evaluated in a series of 
      patients receiving clinical treatment with MP. A single plasma MP concentration
      was determined in each of 273 children and adolescents ages 5 to 18 years (mean: 
      11.1 years) who were clinically good responders to MP for the treatment of
      attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. MP was given on a twice-daily schedule 
      (mean dose: 25 mg/day) in 40% of patients and three times daily (mean dose: 39.3 
      mg/day) in 60%. A nonlinear regression model was applied to estimate overall
      population values of MP clearance and elimination half-life (t1/2), assuming a
      one-component model with first-order absorption and elimination, and further
      assuming that clearance is linearly related to body weight. The model
      incorporated each patient's dosage size and schedule, body weight, and time of
      the plasma sample. Iterated solutions of best fit were: t1/2, 4.5 hours (95%
      confidence interval [CI]: 3.1-8.1 hours), and apparent clearance, 90.7 ml/min/kg 
      (95% CI: 74.6-106.7 ml/min/kg). The model explained 43% of the overall variance
      in MP concentrations (r2 = 0.43, p < .001). In a small subsample (N = 16), a
      second plasma sample was drawn at the same time of day and at the same dose; the 
      correlation between the two concentration values was 0.83. The relatively
      noninvasive approach used in this study allows the assessment of pharmacokinetic 
      properties of medications under conditions of appropriate clinical use in special
      populations such as children, adolescents, and the elderly.

TI  - Perceptual and response interference in children with attention-deficit
      hyperactivity disorder, and the effects of methylphenidate.
PG  - 419-29
AB  - Fourteen children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and 14
      normal control children were compared with respect to stimulus- and
      response-related processes. Subjects with ADHD took part in two additional
      sessions under methylphenidate or placebo. In both experiments, performance and
      electrophysiological measures such as the P2, N2, and P3 components of
      event-related potential and electromyogram (EMG) activity were measured during an
      Eriksen flanker task. In both groups of children, reaction times (RTs) to arrow
      stimuli incongruent with the target were longer than those to neutral stimuli
      (response interference), which were again slower than RTs to target-alone stimuli
      (perceptual interference). Children with ADHD made more errors to incongruent
      stimuli and showed more response interference. For correct responses, no
      differences between the groups in response interference effects on reaction time,
      P2, N2, and P3 latency, or EMG onset were found. Methylphenidate had a general
      enhancing effect on accuracy but did not specifically reduce interference from
      the flanking stimuli. Methylphenidate had no effects on RT, N2 and P2 latency, P3
      amplitude or latency, or EMG activity. The conclusion that methylphenidate did
      not influence response processes contrasts sharply with findings reported by
      authors using the Sternberg memory search task.

TI  - Effect of methylphenidate on attention in children with attention deficit
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): ERP evidence.
PG  - 218-28
AB  - Methylphenidate is the most common treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity 
      disorder (ADHD) and has been shown to improve attention and behaviour. However,
      the precise nature of methylphenidate on specific aspects of attention at
      different dose levels remains unclear. We studied methylphenidate effects in ADHD
      from a neurophysiological perspective, recording event-related potentials (ERPs) 
      during attention task performance in normal controls and children with ADHD under
      different dose conditions. Twenty children with ADHD and 20 age matched controls 
      were assessed with a continuous performance task requiring subjects to identify
      repeating alphabetic characters. ERPs and behavioural measures were recorded and 
      analyzed for trials where a correct response was made. The ADHD group was
      assessed off drug (baseline) and on placebo, low (0.28 mg/kg) and high (0.56
      mg/kg) dose levels of methylphenidate. The results showed that the ADHD group at 
      baseline was more impulsive and inattentive than controls and had shorter P2 and 
      N2 latencies and longer P3 latencies. Low dose methylphenidate was associated
      with reduced impulsivity (fewer false alarms) and decreased P3 latencies, whereas
      the higher dose level was associated with reduced impulsivity and less
      inattention (more hits), as well as increased P2 and N2 latencies and decreased
      P3 latencies. Amplitudes were unaffected and there were no adverse effects of the
      higher dose for any of the children. These results suggest differential dosage
      effects and a dissociation between dose levels and aspects of processing.

TI  - Nefopam and clonidine in the prevention of postanaesthetic shivering.
PG  - 695-9
AB  - Postanaesthetic shivering affects up to 70% of patients after general
      anaesthesia, and may be very distressing. Various drugs have been used to treat
      or prevent postanaesthetic shivering, but the ideal one has not yet been found.
      Sixty patients undergoing elective abdominal or orthopaedic surgery under general
      anaesthesia were included in a randomised, double-blind study. Patients received 
      clonidine (3 microgram.kg-1), nefopam (0.15 mg.kg-1) or saline 0.9% as a placebo 
      at the end of surgery, prior to extubation. Nefopam and clonidine significantly
      reduced the incidence and severity of shivering in comparison with the placebo.
      The recovery time, between the end of anaesthesia and extubation, was
      significantly longer in the clonidine-treated patients [13.6 (5.2) min] than in
      either the nefopam [9.6 (2.8) min] or the placebo [10.0 (5.4) min] groups. Mean
      arterial blood pressure and heart rate were significantly lower in the clonidine 
      group compared with both other groups. Our results suggest that nefopam and
      clonidine are effective in the prevention of postanaesthetic shivering. However, 
      following clonidine administration the recovery time was prolonged and
      hypotension was significantly greater than after nefopam.

TI  - Risperidone versus haloperidol on secondary memory: can newer medications aid
      learning?
PG  - 223-32
AB  - The introduction of the new generation of antipsychotic medications for the
      treatment of schizophrenia has been accompanied by a growing interest in the
      neurocognitive effects of these drugs. The present study compared the effects of 
      risperidone and haloperidol on secondary memory in a group of treatment-resistant
      schizophrenia patients. The study design included a baseline phase and two
      double-blind phases in which patients were randomly assigned to medication under 
      two different dose conditions (fixed dose and flexible dose). Secondary memory
      was assessed at baseline, fixed-dose, and flexible-dose phases, using the
      California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT). Six measures were selected, which formed 
      three factors (general verbal learning ability, retention, and learning
      strategy). Risperidone-treated patients showed greater improvement than
      haloperidol-treated patients in general verbal learning ability, a finding
      characterized by significant treatment effects on CVLT measures of learning
      acquisition, recall consistency, and recognition memory. After controlling for
      benztropine status, differences on the measures of learning acquisition and
      recall consistency remained significant, and differences in recognition memory
      weakened slightly (p = 0.07). No significant treatment effects were noted on
      retention or learning strategy. These findings suggest that risperidone may exert
      a facilitating effect on the acquisition of new verbal information, an effect
      that does not appear to be due to the activation of semantic encoding strategies.

      psychotic disorders.
PG  - 364-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: The increase or emergence of obsessions was compared in young
      patients with recent-onset schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders taking
      clozapine and other antipsychotic drugs. METHOD: We conducted a retrospective
      cohort study. Subjects were 121 consecutively admitted patients diagnosed with
      DSM-III-R schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder, or 
      psychotic disorder not otherwise specified. Obsessions were diagnosed according
      to DSM-IV criteria. RESULTS: More clozapine-treated subjects (20.6%) than
      subjects treated with other antipsychotic drugs (1.3%) experienced an emergence
      or increase of obsessions (p<.01). CONCLUSION: Use of clozapine is associated
      with the emergence or increase of obsessions in early-phase schizophrenia.

PG  - 343-51
AB  - Behavioral and quantitative electroencephalography (EEG) techniques were used to 
      evaluate treatment response to stimulant therapy in children with attention
      disorders. A sample of 130 children with attention disorders were evaluated with 
      Conners and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders--III rating
      scales, and with neurometric quantitative EEG before and 6 to 14 months after
      treatment with stimulants. Significant quantitative EEG differences were found
      between the normal control population (N = 31) and the children with attention
      problems. Quantitative EEG abnormalities involved increased theta or alpha power,
      greatest in frontal regions, frontal theta/alpha hypercoherence, and posterior
      interhemispheric power asymmetry. Behavioral improvement after stimulant
      treatment was seen in 81.5% of the children with attention-deficit hyperactivity 
      disorder and 44.7% of the children with attention-deficit disorder, with the
      degree of correspondence between behavioral and quantitative EEG changes at
      78.5%. Pretreatment clinical and quantitative EEG features could predict
      treatment response with a sensitivity of 83.1% and a specificity of 88.2%. A
      combined behavioral and quantitative EEG approach can be useful for following and
      predicting treatment response to stimulants in children with attention disorders.

TI  - EEG correlates of methylphenidate response among children with ADHD: a
      preliminary report.
PG  - 1657-60
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent electrophysiologic studies have found fairly consistent
      differences between children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
      and age-matched control subjects. The present study examined electroencephalogram
      (EEG) changes associated with a double blind, placebo-controlled administration
      of methylphenidate among children with ADHD. METHODS: Subjects were 10 children, 
      ages 8 to 13, with a primary diagnosis of ADHD. Brain electrical activity was
      recorded with 7 electrodes in the frontal, central, and midline areas during
      baseline and cognitive activation conditions. RESULTS: Repeated-measures ANOVAs
      indicate that children exhibiting a positive medication response had reductions
      of theta and alpha as well as increased beta in the frontal regions, while
      nonresponders showed the opposite pattern (p < .05). Significant correlations
      between improvement on a vigilance task and changes in beta activity in the
      frontal electrodes emerged as well. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings
      indicate that there are different electrophysiologic correlates to
      methylphenidate among ADHD children who are medication responders and
      nonresponders.

TI  - Choreoathetoid movements in cocaine dependence.
PG  - 1630-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: To evaluate the severity of choreoathetoid movements in cocaine
      dependent (CD) subjects and age-matched normal control subjects. METHODS:
      Choreoathetoid movements were evaluated using the Abnormal Involuntary Movement
      Scale (AIMS) in samples of 71 CD, 56 normal control, and 9 amphetamine-dependent 
      male subjects. RESULTS: The CD subjects had a significantly increased nonfacial
      (limbs plus body) AIMS subscore. When the nonfacial AIMS scores of the two groups
      were compared in relation to age, a significant age by diagnosis interaction was 
      observed, indicating that the differences between groups were most marked in the 
      younger age groups. The facial AIMS scores were also increased but only in the
      youngest CD cohort (under 32 years of age). The comparison group of 9 younger
      amphetamine-dependent subjects also showed increased AIMS scores. CONCLUSIONS:
      Increases in choreoathetoid movements in younger cocaine and
      amphetamine-dependent subjects may be related to their psychostimulant use. The
      absence of differences in choreoathetoid movements between the older CD subjects 
      and normal control subjects may represent an age-related self-selection effect.

TI  - Efficacy of apraclonidine 1% versus pilocarpine 4% for prophylaxis of intraocular
      pressure spike after argon laser trabeculoplasty.
PG  - 1135-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors compared the efficacy of apraclonidine 1% versus
      pilocarpine 4% prophylaxis of post-argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) intraocular 
      pressure (IOP) spike. DESIGN: Prospective randomized clinical trial.
      PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred twenty-eight eyes of 228 patients with primary
      open-angle glaucoma undergoing ALT were studied. INTERVENTION: Patients were
      given 1 drop of either apraclonidine 1% (n = 114) or pilocarpine 4% (n = 114) 15 
      minutes before ALT. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Peri-ALT IOPs and incidences of
      post-ALT IOP spikes at 5 minutes, 1 hour, and 24 hours were compared between the 
      two groups. RESULTS: The two groups were similar in age, race, and medical
      dependency. Post-ALT mean IOPs at 5 minutes, 1 hour, and 24 hours were
      significantly lower than pre-ALT mean IOPs in both apraclonidine (P < 0.001) and 
      pilocarpine (P < 0.001) groups. Incidences of IOP spikes greater than 1, 3, and 5
      mmHg at 1 hour post-ALT were 21.1%, 14.9%, and 8.8% for the apraclonidine group
      and 12.3%, 5.3%, and 4.4% for the pilocarpine group (P = 0.076, 0.015, and 0.18
      chi-square test). In the apraclonidine prophylaxis group, patients on long-term
      apraclonidine showed significantly higher incidence of post-ALT IOP spike than
      the patients without such long-term apraclonidine use (35.7%, 15 of 42 eyes, vs. 
      12.5%, 9 of 72 eyes; P = 0.003). In addition, peri-ALT pilocarpine prophylaxis
      tended to be less effective in patients undergoing long-term pilocarpine therapy 
      but without statistical significance (17.4%, 8 of 46 eyes, vs. 9.4%, 6 of 64
      eyes; P = 0.17). CONCLUSION: Peri-ALT pilocarpine 4% was at least as effective
      as, if not more effective than, apraclonidine 1% in post-ALT IOP spike
      prophylaxis. Peri-ALT apraclonidine prophylaxis was not effective in patients on 
      long-term apraclonidine, and peri-ALT pilocarpine prophylaxis tended to be less
      effective in patients undergoing long-term pilocarpine therapy. Pilocarpine 4%
      can be considered as a first-choice drug for post-ALT IOP spike prophylaxis,
      especially in patients under treatment with apraclonidine.

TI  - Pergolide mesylate for cocaine abuse: a controlled preliminary trial.
PG  - 120-7
AB  - A small, controlled study was conducted to assess whether pergolide mesylate has 
      clinical promise as a treatment for cocaine abuse prior to embarking on a larger,
      randomized, double-blind, controlled trial. Fourteen individuals were placed on
      placebo for 2 weeks, followed by a 24-week single-blind study in which they were 
      placed on pergolide for 12 weeks, followed by placebo for 12 weeks. Another 14
      patients received single-blind placebo for two weeks and then were randomized
      into a 24-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple baseline design.
      Initially, patients enrolled in the study were placed on risperidone (n = 9) or
      placebo (n = 5). During the first 12 weeks, retention was worse for those
      receiving pergolide compared to risperidone or placebo. Neither risperidone nor
      pergolide were more efficacious in reducing cocaine use than placebo. Although
      earlier open studies found pergolide to show promise as a treatment for cocaine
      abuse, this study did not support these earlier findings. Comparing an agent to
      both an active control and placebo group may better predict whether a promising
      new agent will have clinical utility compared to the standard open trial.

TI  - A placebo-controlled comparison of the antidepressant efficacy and effects on
      sexual functioning of sustained-release bupropion and sertraline.
PG  - 643-58
AB  - Sexual dysfunction, a frequently reported side effect of many antidepressants,
      may result in patient dissatisfaction and noncompliance with treatment regimens. 
      This paper describes the results of the first placebo-controlled comparison of
      the efficacy, safety, and effects on sexual functioning of sustained-release
      bupropion (bupropion SR) and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor
      sertraline. This randomized, double-masked, double-dummy, parallel-group,
      multicenter trial enrolled 360 patients with moderate-to-severe recurrent major
      depression. Patients were treated with bupropion SR 150 to 400 mg/d, sertraline
      50 to 200 mg/d, or placebo for up to 8 weeks. Patients' depression and sexual
      functioning were assessed at weekly or biweekly clinic visits; safety was
      assessed by regular monitoring of adverse events, vital signs, and body weight.
      Treatment groups were similar at baseline in terms of age, sex, and race, and
      most patients had a diagnosis of moderate uncomplicated depression. Patients
      treated with bupropion SR or sertraline showed similar improvements on all
      efficacy measures; both active treatments were superior to placebo in improving
      scores on all rating scales for depression at various time points. Significantly 
      more patients treated with sertraline experienced orgasmic dysfunction throughout
      the study than did patients treated with bupropion SR or placebo (P < 0.001).
      Headache was the most frequently reported adverse event in all 3 treatment groups
      and occurred with similar frequency in each group (30% to 40%). Nausea (31%),
      diarrhea (26%), insomnia (18%), and somnolence (17%) occurred in significantly
      more patients in the sertraline group than in the bupropion SR group (18%, 7%,
      13%, and 3%, respectively) and the placebo group (10%, 11%, 4%, and 6%,
      respectively). Dry mouth occurred more frequently with bupropion SR (19%) than
      with sertraline (14%) or placebo (12%), although the differences were not
      significant. Changes in vital signs were similar in all groups. Similar (small,
      but not statistically significant) decreases in mean body weight were seen in
      both the bupropion SR (-1.06 kg) and sertraline (-0.79 kg) groups, whereas the
      placebo group experienced a minor increase (0.21 kg). Although bupropion SR and
      sertraline were similarly well tolerated and effective in the treatment of
      depression, sertraline treatment was more often associated with sexual
      dysfunction and certain other adverse events compared with bupropion SR and
      placebo. Therefore, bupropion SR may be an appropriate choice as an
      antidepressant for the treatment of sexually active patients.

TI  - Adding clonidine to lidocaine for intravenous regional anesthesia prevents
      tourniquet pain.
PG  - 1327-30
AB  - Tourniquet pain often complicates the use of the pneumatic tourniquet during
      surgical procedures performed under IV regional anesthesia. Clonidine-containing 
      local anesthetic solutions have better analgesic properties than plain solutions 
      when used for spinal, epidural, or peripheral blocks. We tested the hypothesis
      that the addition of clonidine may improve the quality of IV regional anesthesia,
      especially tourniquet tolerance. Forty patients were allocated randomly in a
      double-blinded, randomized study to receive 40 mL of 0.5% lidocaine and either 1 
      mL of isotonic saline or clonidine (150 microg). A double-cuffed tourniquet was
      kept inflated until patients complained of pain, leading to release of the distal
      cuff. Pain at the tourniquet site, at the surgical site, and in the distal part
      of the arm was rated on a visual analog scale (VAS) and a verbal rating scale
      (VRS) every 15 min during tourniquet placement and every 15 min for 1 h after
      tourniquet deflation. Motor blockade, sedation, arterial pressure, and heart rate
      were also recorded. VAS and VRS scores were significantly lower in the clonidine 
      group 30 and 45 min after tourniquet inflation. The tolerance for the distal
      tourniquet was also significantly longer in the clonidine group (median [range]: 
      22 [10-40] vs 10 [5-20] min; P < 0.05); motor blockade was comparable between the
      two groups. Pain was not different in the two groups after tourniquet release.
      The clonidine group experienced a higher degree of sedation. We conclude that
      clonidine improves tourniquet tolerance when added to a local anesthetic
      solution. IMPLICATIONS: A 150-microg dose of clonidine added to lidocaine
      improved tourniquet tolerance during IV regional anesthesia.

TI  - Event-related potential indices of auditory selective attention in dependent
      amphetamine users.
PG  - 1488-97
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to further investigate a previously 
      reported attention-related impairment in dependent amphetamine users using
      event-related potential (ERP) indices of selective attention. METHODS: ERPs were 
      recorded during an auditory selective attention task (SAT) that involved
      detecting infrequent long-duration target tones presented among short-duration
      tones that varied in location (left vs. right ear) and pitch (low vs. high).
      Amphetamine users (n = 19) were divided into two groups, high dependence (n = 10)
      and low dependence (n = 10), based on amphetamine Severity of Dependence Scale
      scores, and compared to an age-matched control group (n = 9). RESULTS: The
      high-dependence group showed slowed reaction time and reduced early processing
      negativity and peak N1 amplitude to location-relevant nontarget stimuli. Poor
      performance on the SAT was highly correlated with deficits in early processing,
      which were also related to poor performance on the Wechsler Memory Scale
      Attention/Concentration index. CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that severely
      dependent users suffer an inability to selectively enhance the sensory processing
      of relevant auditory information. This may produce poor automatic preferential
      processing of relevant information and increase load on limited attentional
      resources.

TI  - Olanzapine versus placebo in the treatment of acute mania. Olanzapine HGEH Study 
      Group.
PG  - 702-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary intent of this study was to compare the efficacy and
      safety of olanzapine and placebo in the treatment of acute mania. METHOD: The
      design involved a random-assignment, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel
      group study of 3 weeks' duration. After a 2- to 4-day screening period, qualified
      patients were assigned to either olanzapine (N = 70) or placebo (N = 69).
      Patients began double-blind therapy with either olanzapine, 10 mg, or placebo
      given once per day. After the first day of treatment, the daily dose could be
      adjusted upward or downward, as clinically indicated, by one capsule (olanzapine,
      5 mg/day) within the allowed range of one to four capsules. The primary efficacy 
      measure in the protocol was defined as a change from baseline to endpoint in
      total score on the Young Mania Rating Scale. Clinical response was defined a
      priori as a decrease of 50% or more from baseline in Young Mania Rating Scale
      total score. RESULTS: The olanzapine group experienced significantly greater mean
      improvement in Young Mania Rating Scale total score than the placebo group. On
      the basis of the clinical response criteria, significantly more
      olanzapine-treated patients (48.6%) responded than those assigned to placebo
      (24.2%). Somnolence, dizziness, dry mouth, and weight gain occurred significantly
      more often with olanzapine. There were no statistically significant differences
      between the olanzapine-treated and placebo-treated patients with respect to
      measures of parkinsonism, akathisia, and dyskinesias. No discontinuations of
      treatment due to adverse events occurred in the olanzapine treatment group.
      CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study suggest that compared with placebo,
      olanzapine has superior efficacy for the symptoms of acute mania.

TI  - Safety profile of sustained-release bupropion in depression: results of three
      clinical trials.
PG  - 454-63
AB  - This series of studies was undertaken to assess the safety profile of
      sustained-release (SR) bupropion in the treatment of depressed outpatients.
      Adults with a diagnosis of major depression were evaluated in 1 of 3 multicenter,
      randomized, double-masked, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trials conducted in
      private-practice psychiatric outpatient clinics. Following a 1-week,
      single-masked, placebo lead-in period, patients received bupropion SR for 8 weeks
      (study 1: 150 or 300 mg/d; study 2: 100, 200, 300, or 400 mg/d; study 3: 50 to
      150 or 100 to 300 mg/d). Safety assessments included monitoring adverse events,
      patient discontinuation rates, changes in weight, vital signs, and clinical
      laboratory test results. Across studies, the most frequently reported adverse
      events were headache, dry mouth, and nausea. The incidence of adverse events was 
      similar (< or =5% difference) between the bupropion SR and placebo groups, with
      the exception of dry mouth (bupropion SR, 16%; placebo, 7%). Dry mouth, nausea,
      and insomnia occurred significantly more often in bupropion SR-treated patients
      than in patients who received placebo (P<0.05). Nearly all (94% to 99%) adverse
      events reported in these studies were mild or moderate. Less than 10% of patients
      in either group discontinued treatment prematurely because of adverse events, and
      no deaths or serious drug-related adverse events were reported. Sexual
      dysfunction was reported as an adverse event by <1% of patients in either group. 
      Bupropion SR was associated with dose-related weight loss in all 3 studies. No
      consistent patterns of change were observed in vital signs or in the results of
      clinical laboratory tests. Data from these 3 clinical trials demonstrate the
      favorable safety profile of bupropion SR in the treatment of depressed
      outpatients.

TI  - Epidural clonidine or bupivacaine as the sole analgesic agent during and after
      abdominal surgery: a comparative study.
PG  - 1354-62
AB  - BACKGROUND: The rationale of this study was to compare high-dose epidural
      clonidine with a more commonly used agent, such as bupivacaine. This was
      performed to give a more objective idea of the relative analgesic potency of
      epidural clonidine. METHODS: Sixty patients undergoing intestinal surgery during 
      propofol anesthesia were studied. At induction, the patients received epidurally 
      a dose of 10 micrograms/kg [corrected] clonidine in 7 ml saline followed by an
      infusion of 6 micrograms [corrected] x kg(-1) x h(-1) (7 ml/h) (group 1, n = 20),
      a dose of 7 ml bupivacaine, 0.5%, followed by 7 ml/h bupivacaine, 0.25% (group 2,
      n = 20), or a dose of 7 ml bupivacaine, 0.25%, followed by 7 ml/h bupivacaine,
      0.125% (group 3, n = 20). Intraoperatively, increases in arterial blood pressure 
      or heart rate not responding to propofol (0.5 mg/kg) were treated with
      intravenous alfentanil (0.05 mg/kg). Additional doses of propofol were given to
      maintain an adequate bispectral index. The epidural infusions were maintained for
      12 h. In cases of subjective visual analogue pain scores up to 5 cm at rest or up
      to 8 cm during coughing, the patients were given access to a patient-controlled
      analgesia device. RESULTS: During anesthesia, patients in group 1 required less
      propofol than those in groups 2 and 3 (78 [36-142] mg vs. 229 [184-252] mg and
      362 [295-458] mg; P < 0.05) and less alfentanil than patients in group 3 (0 [0-0]
      mg vs. 11 [6-20] mg; P < 0.05). Analgesia lasted 380 min (range, 180-645 min) in 
      group 1 versus 30 min (range, 25-40 min) in group 2 and 22 min (range, 12.5-42
      min) in group 3 (P < 0.05). There was no suggestion of a hemodynamic difference
      among the three groups except for heart rates that were significantly reduced in 
      patients in group 1. Sedation scores were significantly higher in this group
      during the first 2 h postoperatively. CONCLUSION: Our results show that high
      doses of epidural clonidine potentiate general anesthetics and provide more
      efficient postoperative analgesia than the two bupivacaine dosage regimens
      investigated.

TI  - Antipsychotics in children and adolescents.
PG  - 537-45
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To present a critical overview of the available evidence for the
      efficacy and safety of antipsychotic agents in children and adolescents and to
      identify knowledge gaps and needs for further research. Data from adults that are
      relevant to children are discussed. METHOD: Mainly reports of double-blind,
      placebo-controlled studies were reviewed. RESULTS: In children and adolescents,
      antipsychotics are used to treat psychotic and a variety of nonpsychotic
      conditions. The amount of data based on well-designed, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled studies with satisfactory sample sizes in diagnostically
      homogeneous subjects is modest. CONCLUSIONS: Currently available standard
      antipsychotics have a definite role in the treatment of children and adolescents.
      The use of these agents is limited mainly by tardive and withdrawal dyskinesias
      and, in some patients, by excessive sedation. The atypical antipsychotics should 
      be critically assessed and compared with psychosocial interventions; if
      effective, the combination of both types of treatments should be evaluated.

PG  - 503-12
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the short- and long-term safety and efficacy of stimulants
      for the treatment of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
      (ADHD). METHOD: A Medline search was conducted for both randomized controlled
      trials and reviews to determine the efficacy and safety of stimulant drugs for
      treating children with ADHD. Information was obtained on adverse events
      associated with their use, including their impact on height and weight gain
      during childhood. Animal data were reviewed for information on tolerance,
      sensitization, and the impact of high-dose stimulant effects on neurons and on
      the development of hepatic tumors. Human data on dopamine transporter occupancy
      by stimulants were also included. RESULTS: Stimulant treatment studies show
      robust short-term efficacy and a good safety profile. Longer-term studies are few
      in number but have produced no conclusive evidence that careful therapeutic use
      of these medications is harmful. CONCLUSION: Current evidence indicates that
      stimulants show efficacy and safety in studies lasting up to 24 months.

TI  - Response to methylphenidate in boys with attention-deficit hyperactivity
      disorder.
PG  - 298-303
AB  - The response to methylphenidate was examined in 36 boys, aged 7-11 y, with
      attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, crossover design. Hyperactivity and conduct problems were
      significantly reduced during methylphenidate treatment. Stimulant medication was 
      associated with improvements on tests of sustained attention, working memory and 
      motor steadiness. When individual changes were studied, it was found that 83%
      showed a significant improvement in their hyperactivity at home or at school, and
      for 60% their levels of hyperactive behaviour were within the normal range. High 
      levels of hyperactivity at school and relatively low age were significant
      predictors of normalization of hyperactivity in at least one setting. However,
      these predictors could only classify correctly 71% of the children. In clinical
      practice a trial with stimulants is indicated in ADHD children who show symptoms 
      that are sufficiently severe to cause impairment at home and at school.

TI  - Pre-AIDS mortality and morbidity among injection drug users in Amsterdam and
      Baltimore: an ecological comparison.
PG  - 845-65
AB  - Mortality and morbidity between injecting drug users in Amsterdam (n = 624) and
      Baltimore (n = 2,185) are compared to generate a hypothesis about the role of
      different health care systems and drug user policies (universal care and harm
      reduction versus episodic care and criminalization, respectively).
      Overdose/suicide mortality was twofold higher in Amsterdam; no sufficient
      explanation was found. Other independent "risk factors" for overdose/suicide
      mortality were recent injecting, polydrug use, and HIV-seropositivity (especially
      with CD4 count < 200/mm3). High dose methadone maintenance was associated with
      lower mortality. Incidence of hospitalizations and emergency room visits was
      substantially lower in Amsterdam, suggesting that higher accessibility to primary
      care in Amsterdam lowers (inpatient) hospital visits and presumably societal
      costs.

TI  - Olanzapine versus haloperidol in the treatment of schizoaffective disorder. Acute
      and long-term therapy.
PG  - 15-22
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of antipsychotic monotherapy in schizoaffective
      disorder is limited, and further constrained by safety concerns. AIMS: We aimed
      to compare the efficacy, tolerability and safety profile of the new
      pharmaceutical, olanzapine, with haloperidol. METHOD: Data were assessed from 300
      DSM-III-R schizoaffective subjects from a larger double-blind prospective
      international study. Subjects were randomly allocated to six weeks of olanzapine 
      (5-20 mg) or haloperidol (5-20 mg) treatment; responders were followed for up to 
      one year of double-blind, long-term maintenance therapy. RESULTS:
      Olanzapine-treated patients achieved a statistically significant greater
      improvement than haloperidol treated patients on overall measures of efficacy,
      including clinical response. Significantly fewer olanzapine patients left the
      study early, and fewer adverse events were observed among those receiving
      olanzapine. During maintenance, olanzapine-treated patients continued to
      experience additional improvement, with fewer EPS but more weight gain than those
      on haloperidol. CONCLUSIONS: Olanzapine demonstrated substantial advantages over 
      the conventional antipsychotic haloperidol in the management of schizoaffective
      disorder.

TI  - Randomised double-blind comparison of the incidence of tardive dyskinesia in
      patients with schizophrenia during long-term treatment with olanzapine or
      haloperidol.
PG  - 23-30
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tardive dyskinesia is important in the side-effect profile of
      antipsychotic medication. AIMS: The development of tardive dyskinesia was
      evaluated in patients treated with double-blind, randomly assigned olanzapine or 
      haloperidol for up to 2.6 years. METHODS: Tardive dyskinesia was assessed by the 
      Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) and Research Diagnostic Criteria for
      Tardive Dyskinesia (RD-TD), it was defined as meeting RD-TD criteria at two
      consecutive assessments. The risk of tardive dyskinesia, the relative risk,
      incidence rate, and incidence rate ratio were estimated. RESULTS: The relative
      risk of tardive dyskinesia for the overall follow up period for haloperidol (n = 
      522) v. olanzapine (n = 1192) was 2.66 (95% CI = 1.50-4.70). Based on data
      following the initial six weeks of observation (during which patients underwent
      medication change and AIMS assessments as frequently as every three days), the
      one-year risk was 0.52% with olanzapine (n = 513) and 7.45% with haloperidol (n =
      114). The relative risk throughout this follow-up period was 11.37 (95% CI =
      2.21-58.60). CONCLUSION: Our results indicated a significantly lower risk of
      tardive dyskinesia with olanzapine than with haloperidol.

PG  - 35-50
AB  - We evaluated separate and interactive effects between common classroom
      contingencies and methylphenidate (MPH) on disruptive and off-task behaviors for 
      4 children with a diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Analogue
      conditions consisting of contingent teacher reprimands, brief time-out, no
      interaction, and alone were conducted in a multielement design. Medication status
      (MPH or placebo) was alternated across days in a superordinate multielement
      design. Results indicate that (a) the behavioral effects of MPH were influenced
      by one or more of the analogue conditions for each participant, and (b) time-out 
      was associated with zero or near-zero levels of both disruptive and off-task
      behavior for 3 of the 4 participants during MPH and placebo conditions.
      Implications for the clinical effectiveness of MPH and possible behavioral
      mechanisms of action of MPH in applied settings are discussed.

TI  - The neurotoxicity of drugs given intrathecally (spinal)
PG  - 797-809
AB  - Overall, most spinal drugs in clinical use have been poorly studied for spinal
      cord and nerve root toxicity. Laboratory studies indicate that all local
      anesthetics are neurotoxic in high concentrations and that lidocaine and
      tetracaine have neurotoxic potential in clinically used concentrations. However, 
      spinal anesthesia (including lidocaine and tetracaine) has a long and enviable
      history of safety. Spinal analgesics such as morphine, fentanyl, sufentanil,
      clonidine, and neostigmine seem to have a low potential for neurotoxicity based
      on laboratory and extensive clinical use. Most antioxidants, preservatives, and
      excipients used in commercial formulations seem to have a low potential for
      neurotoxicity. In addition to summarizing current information, we hope that this 
      review stimulates future research on spinal drugs to follow a systematic approach
      to determining potential neurotoxicity. Such an approach would examine
      histologic, physiologic, and behavioral testing in several species, followed by
      cautious histologic, physiologic, and clinical testing in human volunteers and
      patients with terminal cancer refractory to conventional therapy.

TI  - Guanfacine, but not clonidine, improves planning and working memory performance
      in humans.
PG  - 460-70
AB  - The present study compares, using a double-blind, placebo controlled design the
      effects of two alpha 2-agonists, clonidine (0.5, 2, and 5 micrograms/kg) and
      guanfacine (7 and 29 micrograms/kg) on spatial working memory, planning and
      attentional set-shifting, functions thought to be dependent on the "central
      executive" of the prefrontal cortex. Blood pressure and the subjective feeling of
      sedation were affected equally by clonidine and guanfacine. The 0.5 microgram/kg 
      and 5 micrograms/kg doses of clonidine disrupted spatial working memory, but the 
      medium dose had no effect. The 0.5 and 2 micrograms/kg doses of clonidine
      increased impulsive responding in the planning test. The 5 micrograms/kg dose of 
      clonidine slowed responding at effortful levels of planning and attentional
      set-shifting tests. The 29 micrograms/kg dose of guanfacine improved spatial
      working memory and planning. Guanfacine had no effect on attentional
      set-shifting. These data indicate that guanfacine improved planning and spatial
      working memory, but clonidine dose-dependently disrupted performance. It is
      possible that the greater selectivity of guanfacine for alpha 2A-adrenoceptor
      subtype may underlie its differences from clonidine.

      Study Group.
PG  - 491-505
AB  - In this double-blind study, patients with an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia 
      or schizoaffective disorder were randomized to receive either ziprasidone 80
      mg/day (n = 106) or 160 mg/day (n = 104) or placebo (n = 92), for 6 weeks. Both
      doses of ziprasidone were statistically significantly more effective than placebo
      in improving the PANSS total, BPRS total, BPRS core items, CGI-S, and PANSS
      negative subscale scores (p < .05). Ziprasidone 160 mg/day significantly improved
      depressive symptoms in patients with clinically significant depression at
      baseline (MADRS > or = 14, over-all mean 23.5) (p < .05) as compared with
      placebo. The percentage of patients experiencing adverse events was similar in
      each treatment group, and resultant discontinuation was rare. The most frequent
      adverse events associated with ziprasidone were generally mild dyspepsia, nausea,
      dizziness, and transient somnolence. Ziprasidone was shown to have a very low
      liability for inducing movement disorders and weight gain. The results indicate
      that ziprasidone is effective and well tolerated in the treatment of the
      positive, negative, and depressive symptoms of an acute exacerbation of
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.

TI  - Stimulant medication withdrawal during long-term therapy in children with
      comorbid attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and chronic multiple tic
      disorder.
PG  - 730-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In this study we examined changes in attention-deficit hyperactivity 
      disorder behaviors and motor and vocal tics during withdrawal from long-term
      maintenance therapy with stimulant medication. METHODS: Subjects were 19 children
      with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and chronic tic disorder who had
      received methylphenidate (n = 17) or dextroamphetamine (n = 2) for a minimum of 1
      year. Children were switched to placebo under double-blind conditions. Treatment 
      effects were assessed by using direct observations of child behavior in a
      simulated (clinic-based) classroom and behavior rating scales completed by
      parents and clinician. RESULTS: There was no change (group data) in the frequency
      or severity of motor tics or vocal tics during the placebo condition compared
      with maintenance dose of stimulant medication (ie, no evidence of tic
      exacerbation while receiving medication or of a withdrawal reaction). There was
      no evidence of tic exacerbation in the evening as a rebound effect. Treatment
      with the maintenance dose was also associated with behavioral improvement in
      attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder behaviors, indicating continued
      efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Abrupt withdrawal of stimulant medication in children
      receiving long-term maintenance therapy does not appear to result in worsening of
      tic frequency or severity. Nevertheless, these findings do not preclude the
      possibility of drug withdrawal reactions in susceptible individuals.

TI  - [Gamma-hydroxybutyrate for treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome in intensive 
      care patients. A comparison between with two symptom-oriented therapeutic
      concepts].
PG  - 89-96
AB  - Seeing as gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) and benzodiazepines interact with the
      GABA-transmitter system, we investigated whether GHB can replace the conventional
      therapy, which uses benzodiazepines in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal
      syndrome in ICU settings. METHODS: 42 chronic alcoholics were included in this
      prospective and randomized study. Following the development of alcohol withdrawal
      syndrome, the patients were randomly allocated to the GHB or to the flunitrazepam
      group. In addition to this, clonidine was administered in order to treat
      autonomic signs of withdrawal. In cases were hallucinations occurred, haloperidol
      was administered. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the efficacy of
      treatment used in the duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit 
      stay between groups. The patients in the GHB-group required significantly higher 
      dosages of haloperidol and significantly lower dosages of clonidine. 14 out of 21
      patients from the GHB-group developed hypernatriaemia and 15 out of 21 developed 
      a metabolic alkalosis. CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms of the autonomic nervous system were
      more effectively prevented by GHB as evident in the lower dosage requirement of
      clonidine. However, GHB may not sufficiently block the hyperactivity of the
      dopaminergic system or may have an hallucinogenic effect itself. This may be
      evident from the higher dosages of haloperidol which were necessary. Due to the
      latter fact, the administration of GHB cannot be recommended in all patients
      suffering from AWS in ICU settings.

TI  - Selegiline-induced postural hypotension in Parkinson's disease: a longitudinal
      study on the effects of drug withdrawal.
PG  - 246-51
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The United Kingdom Parkinson's Disease Research Group (UKPDRG) trial 
      found an increased mortality in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) randomized
      to receive 10 mg selegiline per day and L-dopa compared with those taking L-dopa 
      alone. Recently, we found that therapy with selegiline and L-dopa was associated 
      with selective systolic orthostatic hypotension which was abolished by withdrawal
      of selegiline. This unwanted effect on postural blood pressure was not the result
      of underlying autonomic failure. The aims of this study were to confirm our
      previous findings in a separate cohort of patients and to determine the time
      course of the cardiovascular consequences of stopping selegiline in the
      expectation that this might shed light on the mechanisms by which the drug causes
      orthostatic hypotension. METHODS: The cardiovascular responses to standing and
      head-up tilt were studied repeatedly in PD patients receiving selegiline and as
      the drug was withdrawn. RESULTS: Head-up tilt caused systolic orthostatic
      hypotension which was marked in six of 20 PD patients on selegiline, one of whom 
      lost consciousness with unrecordable blood pressures. A lesser degree of
      orthostatic hypotension occurred with standing. Orthostatic hypotension was
      ameliorated 4 days after withdrawal of selegiline and totally abolished 7 days
      after discontinuation of the drug. Stopping selegiline also significantly reduced
      the supine systolic and diastolic blood pressures consistent with a previously
      undescribed supine pressor action. CONCLUSION: This study confirms our previous
      finding that selegiline in combination with L-dopa is associated with selective
      orthostatic hypotension. The possibilities that these cardiovascular findings
      might be the result of non-selective inhibition of monoamine oxidase or of
      amphetamine and metamphetamine are discussed.

TI  - Diuretics and beta-blockers do not have adverse effects at 1 year on plasma lipid
      and lipoprotein profiles in men with hypertension. Department of Veterans Affairs
      Cooperative Study Group on Antihypertensive Agents.
PG  - 551-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Concern based on the reported short-term adverse effects of
      antihypertensive agents on plasma lipid and lipoprotein profiles (PLPPs) has
      complicated the therapy for hypertension. OBJECTIVE: To compare the long-term
      (1-year) effects of 6 different antihypertensive drugs and placebo on PLPPs in a 
      multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group clinical trial in 15 US
      Veterans Affairs medical centers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 1292
      ambulatory men, 21 years or older, with diastolic blood pressures (DBPs) ranging 
      from 95 to 109 mm Hg taking placebo were randomized to receive placebo or 1 of 6 
      antihypertensive drugs: hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, captopril, clonidine,
      diltiazem, or prazosin. After drug titration, patients with a DBP of less than 90
      mm Hg were followed up for 1 year. Plasma lipids and lipoprotein profiles were
      determined at baseline, after initial titration, and at 1 year. RESULTS: After 8 
      weeks on a regimen of hydrochlorothiazide, increases of 3.3 mg/dL (0.09 mmol/L)
      in total cholesterol and 2.7 mg/dL in apolipoprotein B were significantly
      different (P< or =.05) from decreases of 9.3 mg/dL in total cholesterol and 5.4
      mg/dL in ApoB levels while receiving prazosin but not from placebo. Patients
      achieving positive DBP control using hydrochlorothiazide (responders) showed no
      adverse changes in PLPPs, whereas nonresponders exhibited increases in
      triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.
      Plasma lipids and lipoprotein profiles did not change significantly among
      treatment groups after 1 year except for minor decreases in high-density
      lipoprotein 2 levels using hydrochlorothiazide, clonidine, and atenolol.
      CONCLUSIONS: None of these 6 antihypertensive drugs has any long-term adverse
      effects on PLPPs and, therefore, may be safely prescribed. Previously reported
      short-term adverse effects from using hydrochlorothiazide are limited to
      nonresponders.

TI  - THA improves word priming and clonidine enhances fluency and working memory in
      Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 357-64
AB  - We investigated the effects of a single administration of a cholinesterase
      inhibitor, tetrahydroaminoacridine (THA, 25 and 50 mg, orally), and an alpha
      2-agonist, clonidine (0.5 and 2 micrograms/kg, orally), on neuropsychologic
      performance in two groups of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Clonidine
      enhanced a spatial working memory and verbal fluency, but had no effect on
      spatial span or word priming. THA enhanced word priming, but had no effect on
      other performance measures. Our data suggests that degeneration of the LC
      noradrenergic system and the cholinergic cells of the basal forebrain have
      different functional consequences during the progression of AD. Finally, a
      combined treatment with noradrenergic and cholinergic drugs might produce a
      qualitatively broader effect on cognitive functions than either of the treatments
      alone, and more effectively attenuate clinical dementia.

      associated with dementia: a randomized, double-blind trial. Risperidone Study
      Group.
PG  - 107-15
AB  - BACKGROUND: We report the findings from the first large, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      risperidone in the treatment of psychotic and behavioral symptoms in
      institutionalized elderly patients with dementia. METHOD: 625 patients (67.8%
      women; mean age = 82.7 years) with DSM-IV diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease (73%),
      vascular dementia (15%), or mixed dementia (12%) and significant psychotic and
      behavioral symptoms were included. Each patient was randomly assigned to receive 
      placebo or 0.5 mg/day, 1 mg/day, or 2 mg/day of risperidone for 12 weeks. The
      primary outcome measure was the Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease
      rating scale (BEHAVE-AD). RESULTS: The study was completed by 70% of the
      patients. Baseline Functional Assessment Staging scores were 6 or 7 in more than 
      95% of the patients, indicating severe dementia. At endpoint, significantly
      greater reductions in BEHAVE-AD total scores and psychosis and aggressiveness
      subscale scores were seen in patients receiving 1 and 2 mg/day of risperidone
      than in placebo patients (p = .005 and p < .001, respectively). At week 12, 0.5
      mg/day of risperidone was superior to placebo in reducing BEHAVE-AD aggression
      scores (p = .02). More adverse events were reported by patients receiving 2
      mg/day of risperidone than 1 mg/day. The most common dose-related adverse events 
      were extrapyramidal symptoms, somnolence, and mild peripheral edema. The
      frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms in patients receiving 1 mg/day of
      risperidone was not significantly greater than in placebo patients. CONCLUSION:
      Risperidone significantly improved symptoms of psychosis and aggressive behavior 
      in patients with severe dementia. Results show that 1 mg/day of risperidone is an
      appropriate dose for most elderly patients with dementia.

TI  - Predictors of relapse following response from a first episode of schizophrenia or
      schizoaffective disorder.
PG  - 241-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: We examined relapse after response to a first episode of
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. METHODS: Patients with first-episode
      schizophrenia were assessed on measures of psychopathologic variables, cognition,
      social functioning, and biological variables and treated according to a
      standardized algorithm. The sample for the relapse analyses consisted of 104
      patients who responded to treatment of their index episode and were at risk for
      relapse. RESULTS: Five years after initial recovery, the cumulative first relapse
      rate was 81.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 70.6%-93.2%); the second relapse
      rate was 78.0% (95% CI, 46.5%-100.0%). By 4 years after recovery from a second
      relapse, the cumulative third relapse rate was 86.2% (95% CI, 61.5%-100.0%).
      Discontinuing antipsychotic drug therapy increased the risk of relapse by almost 
      5 times (hazard ratio for an initial relapse, 4.89 [99% CI, 2.49-9.60]; hazard
      ratio for a second relapse, 4.57 [99% CI, 1.49-14.02]). Subsequent analyses
      controlling for antipsychotic drug use showed that patients with poor premorbid
      adaptation to school and premorbid social withdrawal relapsed earlier. Sex,
      diagnosis, obstetric complications, duration of psychotic illness before
      treatment, baseline symptoms, neuroendocrine measures, methylphenidate
      hydrochloride challenge response, neuropsychologic and magnetic resonance imaging
      measures, time to response of the initial episode, adverse effects during
      treatment, and presence of residual symptoms after the initial episode were not
      significantly related to time to relapse. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high rate of
      relapse within 5 years of recovery from a first episode of schizophrenia and
      schizoaffective disorder. This risk is diminished by maintenance antipsychotic
      drug treatment.

TI  - Low-dose clozapine for the treatment of drug-induced psychosis in Parkinson's
      disease. The Parkinson Study Group.
PG  - 757-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: Drug-induced psychosis is a difficult problem to manage in patients
      with Parkinson's disease. Multiple open-label studies have reported that
      treatment with clozapine at low doses ameliorates psychosis without worsening
      parkinsonism. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial of low doses of clozapine (6.25 to 50 mg per day) in 60 
      patients at six sites over a period of 14 months. The patients (mean age, 72
      years) had idiopathic Parkinson's disease and drug-induced psychosis of at least 
      four weeks' duration. All the patients continued to receive fixed doses of
      antiparkinsonian drugs during the four weeks of the trial. Blood counts were
      monitored weekly in all the patients. RESULTS: The mean dose of clozapine was
      24.7 mg per day. The patients in the clozapine group had significantly more
      improvement than those in the placebo group in all three of the measures used to 
      determine the severity of psychosis. The mean (+/-SE) scores on the Clinical
      Global Impression Scale improved by 1.6+/-0.3 points for the patients receiving
      clozapine, as compared with 0.5+/-0.2 point for those receiving placebo
      (P<0.001). The score on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale improved by 9.3+/-1.5 
      points for the patients receiving clozapine, as compared with 2.6+/-1.3 points
      for those receiving placebo (P=0.002). The score on the Scale for the Assessment 
      of Positive Symptoms improved by 11.8+/-2.0 points for the patients receiving
      clozapine, as compared with 3.8+/-1.9 points for those receiving placebo
      (P=0.01). Seven patients treated with clozapine had an improvement of at least
      three on the seven-point Clinical Global Impression Scale, as compared with only 
      one patient given placebo. Clozapine treatment improved tremor and had no
      deleterious effect on the severity of parkinsonism. In one patient, clozapine was
      discontinued because of leukopenia. CONCLUSIONS: Clozapine, at daily doses of 50 
      mg or less, is safe and significantly improves drug-induced psychosis without
      worsening parkinsonism.

TI  - Spinal clonidine prolongs labor analgesia from spinal sufentanil and bupivacaine.
PG  - 573-6
AB  - We sought to determine whether spinal clonidine 50 microg prolongs the analgesia 
      from the spinal administration of sufentanil 7.5 microg and bupivacaine 2.5 mg
      early in the first stage of labor. Thirty patients were randomized to receive a
      2-mL spinal injection of sufentanil 7.5 microg + bupivacaine 2.5 mg with or
      without clonidine 50 microg using a combined spinal-epidural (CSE) technique.
      Pain, nausea, pruritus, sedation, motor block, blood pressure, and heart rate
      were assessed until the patient requested additional analgesia. Analgesia was
      significantly prolonged in patients who received spinal sufentanil + bupivacaine 
      + clonidine (197 +/- 70 vs 132 +/- 39 min; P = 0.004). Pain scores and side
      effects, including motor block, sedation, and hypotension, were similar between
      groups. Spinal clonidine significantly prolongs labor analgesia from spinal
      sufentanil and bupivacaine without producing serious adverse side effects.
      IMPLICATIONS: We studied the effects of spinal clonidine administered with spinal
      sufentanil and bupivacaine on labor analgesia using a combined spinal-epidural
      technique and conclude that spinal clonidine significantly prolongs labor
      analgesia from spinal sufentanil and bupivacaine without producing serious
      adverse effects.

TI  - Effects of methylphenidate on complex cognitive processing in attention-deficit
      hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - 90-105
AB  - Three experiments were conducted to explore the effects of methylphenidate (MPH),
      attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis, and age on performance
      on a complex visual-memory search task. Results showed that the effects of MPH
      varied with information load. On low-processing loads, all doses of MPH helped
      children with ADHD to improve accuracy with no cost to reaction time (RT),
      whereas on high loads, higher MPH doses improved error rates while slowing RT.
      Without medication, children with ADHD showed high error rates and slow RTs
      across both low and high loads, as did younger, normal control children. Because 
      MPH slowed performance on only the most difficult, high-load conditions, it is
      argued that the drug improves self-regulatory ability, enabling children with
      ADHD to adapt differentially to high and low loads.

TI  - A controlled trial of sustained-release bupropion, a nicotine patch, or both for 
      smoking cessation.
PG  - 685-91
AB  - BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Use of nicotine-replacement therapies and the
      antidepressant bupropion helps people stop smoking. We conducted a double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled comparison of sustained-release bupropion (244 subjects), a
      nicotine patch (244 subjects), bupropion and a nicotine patch (245 subjects), and
      placebo (160 subjects) for smoking cessation. Smokers with clinical depression
      were excluded. Treatment consisted of nine weeks of bupropion (150 mg a day for
      the first three days, and then 150 mg twice daily) or placebo, as well as eight
      weeks of nicotine-patch therapy (21 mg per day during weeks 2 through 7, 14 mg
      per day during week 8, and 7 mg per day during week 9) or placebo. The target day
      for quitting smoking was usually day 8. RESULTS: The abstinence rates at 12
      months were 15.6 percent in the placebo group, as compared with 16.4 percent in
      the nicotine-patch group, 30.3 percent in the bupropion group (P<0.001), and 35.5
      percent in the group given bupropion and the nicotine patch (P<0.001). By week 7,
      subjects in the placebo group had gained an average of 2.1 kg, as compared with a
      gain of 1.6 kg in the nicotine-patch group, a gain of 1.7 kg in the bupropion
      group, and a gain of 1.1 kg in the combined-treatment group (P<0.05). Weight gain
      at seven weeks was significantly less in the combined-treatment group than in the
      bupropion group and the placebo group (P<0.05 for both comparisons). A total of
      311 subjects (34.8 percent) discontinued one or both medications. Seventy-nine
      subjects stopped treatment because of adverse events: 6 in the placebo group (3.8
      percent), 16 in the nicotine-patch group (6.6 percent), 29 in the bupropion group
      (11.9 percent), and 28 in the combined-treatment group (11.4 percent). The most
      common adverse events were insomnia and headache. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with
      sustained-release bupropion alone or in combination with a nicotine patch
      resulted in significantly higher long-term rates of smoking cessation than use of
      either the nicotine patch alone or placebo. Abstinence rates were higher with
      combination therapy than with bupropion alone, but the difference was not
      statistically significant.

TI  - The effectiveness of clonidine as an analgesic in paediatric adenotonsillectomy.
PG  - 1162-7
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the analgesic effects of preoperative oral clonidine with
      intraoperative intravenous fentanyl in children undergoing tonsillectomy or
      adenotonsillectomy. METHODS: This randomized, controlled, double-blind study of
      36 ASA I-II children, age 7-12 yr undergoing adenotonsillectomy was conducted at 
      a tertiary care paediatric teaching hospital. Either 4 micrograms.kg-1 clonidine 
      po was given 60-90 min preoperatively or 3 micrograms.kg-1 fentanyl i.v. was
      given intraoperatively. Postoperatively visual analog pain scores (VAS) were
      recorded at rest and on swallowing every 10 min for the first 30 min and then
      every 15 min for two hours. Morphine 0.05 mg.kg-1 i.v. was given for VAS > or =
      5. If > 3 doses were required, 1.5 mg.kg-1 codeine po and 20 mg.kg-1
      acetaminophen po were given. Sedation and anxiety scores were recorded
      preoperatively. Haemodynamic changes, blood loss, recovery scores, and the
      incidence of vomiting, hypotension, and airway obstruction were recorded.
      RESULTS: Children who received clonidine had a higher incidence of preoperative
      sedation (63%) than those receiving fentanyl (6%). Preinduction mean arterial
      pressure was lower in the clonidine group but required no intervention. VAS
      scores were similar throughout the observation period. There was no difference
      either in the number of morphine or codeine rescue doses administered or in the
      incidence of side effects. CONCLUSION: Oral clonidine is an effective analgesic
      and sedative for children undergoing tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy.

TI  - Clozapine and risperidone in chronic schizophrenia: effects on symptoms,
      parkinsonian side effects, and neuroendocrine response.
PG  - 294-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Clozapine and risperidone were the first two "second-generation"
      antipsychotic drugs approved for schizophrenia. There is currently little
      information about their comparative efficacy from head-to-head clinical trials.
      The purpose of this study was to examine the comparative efficacy of clozapine
      and risperidone for positive and negative symptoms, depression, parkinsonian side
      effects, and indexes of neuroendocrine function in schizophrenic patients who met
      a priori criteria for partial response to traditional neuroleptic agents. METHOD:
      After a baseline fluphenazine treatment period, 29 patients participated in a
      6-week, double-blind, parallel-group comparison of the effects of these agents.
      RESULTS: Clozapine was superior to risperidone for positive symptoms and
      parkinsonian side effects, but there were no significant differences between the 
      drugs on two measures of negative symptoms, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale total 
      scores, and depression scores. The clozapine patients, but not the risperidone
      patients, demonstrated significant reductions from the fluphenazine baseline in
      positive symptoms, total symptoms, and depression. In addition, clozapine
      produced fewer effects on plasma prolactin than risperidone or fluphenazine. The 
      mean daily doses during week 6 of the trial were 403.6 mg of clozapine and 5.9 mg
      of risperidone. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study indicate that these
      drugs have both important differences and similarities in their comparative
      efficacy in chronically ill, partially responsive patients with schizophrenia.
      Further research on second-generation antipsychotic drugs in this patient
      population that addresses key methodological issues, such as optimal dose and

TI  - Efficacy and extrapyramidal side-effects of the new antipsychotics olanzapine,
      quetiapine, risperidone, and sertindole compared to conventional antipsychotics
      and placebo. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
PG  - 51-68
AB  - The objective of this meta-analysis is to summarize the efficacy and tolerability
      of the new antipsychotics risperidone, olanzapine, sertindole and quetiapine in
      schizophrenia compared to placebo and conventional antipsychotics. The main
      results are: (1) All of the 4 new drugs are more effective than placebo, but the 
      magnitude of the effect is only moderate [mean effect size, r, of all
      antipsychotics vs. placebo = 0.25, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) =
      0.22-0.28, n = 2477]. (2) According to the studies published to date, sertindole 
      and quetiapine are as effective as haloperidol, and risperidone and olanzapine
      are slightly more effective than haloperidol in the treatment of global
      schizophrenic symptomatology. (3) With respect to negative symptoms, all new
      antipsychotics are more effective than placebo. However, contrary to widespread
      opinion, so is the 'conventional' antipsychotic haloperidol. Risperidone and
      olanzapine are slightly superior, sertindole is as effective and--according to
      the only study fully published to date--quetiapine is even slightly less
      effective than haloperidol in this regard. (4) All new antipsychotics are
      associated with less frequent use of antiparkinson medication than haloperidol,
      with risperidone appearing to have a slightly less favourable EPS-profile than
      the other new antipsychotics. The methodological limitations of this review, the 
      generalizability of the results and expectations from future research are
      discussed.

TI  - A double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending-dose evaluation of the
      pharmacokinetics and tolerability of modafinil tablets in healthy male
      volunteers.
PG  - 30-40
AB  - A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending-dose study was
      conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetic and safety profiles of increasing
      modafinil doses (200 mg, 400 mg, 600 mg, 800 mg) administered orally over a 7-day
      period in normal healthy male volunteers. Eight subjects (six modafinil; two
      placebo) were randomized to each of the four dose groups. Modafinil or a placebo 
      was administered once daily for 7 days. Serial blood samples were obtained
      following administration of the day 1 and day 7 doses for characterization of
      pharmacokinetics, and trough samples were obtained prior to dosing on days 2
      through 6 to assess the time to reach the steady state. Pharmacokinetic
      parameters were calculated using noncompartmental methods. Modafinil steady state
      was reached after three daily doses. Modafinil pharmacokinetics were dose and
      time independent over the range of 200 mg to 800 mg. Steady-state
      pharmacokinetics of modafinil were characterized by a rapid oral absorption rate,
      a low plasma clearance of approximately 50 mL/min, a volume of distribution of
      approximately 0.8 L/kg, and a long half-life of approximately 15 hr. Modafinil
      was primarily eliminated by metabolism. Modafinil acid was the major urinary
      metabolite. Stereospecific pharmacokinetics of modafinil were demonstrated. The
      d-modafinil enantiomer was eliminated at a threefold faster rate than
      1-modafinil. Modafinil 200 mg, 400 mg, and 600 mg doses were generally well
      tolerated. The modafinil 800 mg dose panel was discontinued after 3 days of
      treatment due to the observation of increased blood pressure and pulse rate. The 
      safety data from this study suggest that the maximum tolerable single daily oral 
      modafinil dose, without titration, may be 600 mg.

TI  - Dexmedetomidine failed to block the acute hyperdynamic response to
      electroconvulsive therapy.
PG  - 422-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Orally administered clonidine (0.2-0.3 mg) has been reported to
      decrease the acute hypertensive response to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)
      without prolonging early recovery. This preliminary study was designed to
      evaluate the acute hemodynamic effects of the investigational alpha2-adrenergic
      agonist, dexmedetomidine, in patients undergoing a series of ECT treatments.
      METHODS: Six patients undergoing a series of three to six consecutive ECT
      treatments were studied according to a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled protocol All patients received either saline or
      dexmedetomidine, 0.5 or 1.0 microg/kg intravenously, 10-30 min before induction
      of anesthesia for ECT using a standardized anesthesia protocol. In addition to
      assessing the cardiovascular variables, the duration of seizure activity, degree 
      of sedation, and time to discharge from the Phase I recovery unit were assessed. 
      RESULTS: Although dexmedetomidine produced dose-related increases in the level of
      sedation before the ECT procedure, it failed to decrease the peak blood pressure 
      and heart rate responses after the ECT treatment. The 0.5 and 1.0 microg/kg doses
      of dexmedetomidine prolonged the times to orientation and to discharge from the
      Phase I unit. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this pilot study suggest that
      dexmedetomidine (0.5-1.0 microg/kg given intravenously) is not beneficial in
      controlling the acute hyperdynamic response after ECT.

TI  - Prolactin levels and adverse events in patients treated with risperidone.
PG  - 57-61
AB  - Hyperprolactinemia is a common clinical disorder that may lead to sexual
      dysfunction or galactorrhea. It may arise from a variety of etiologies, including
      the use of antipsychotic agents, presumably because of a dopamine receptor
      blockade. This analysis was designed to characterize the relationship between
      risperidone, serum prolactin levels, and possible clinical sequelae. All data
      from randomized, double-blind studies of risperidone in patients with chronic
      schizophrenia were analyzed. The two largest studies (the North American and
      multinational trials) included 841 patients (259 women, 582 men) with paired
      prolactin level data and 1,884 patients (554 women, 1,330 men) with data on six
      adverse events possibly associated with increased prolactin levels (amenorrhea,
      galactorrhea, and decreased libido in women; erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory
      dysfunction, gynecomastia, and decreased libido in men). Both risperidone and
      haloperidol produced dose-related increases in plasma prolactin levels in men and
      women. Among women, the risperidone dose was not correlated with adverse events, 
      nor were the adverse events correlated with endpoint prolactin levels. Among men,
      the incidence of adverse events was positively correlated with risperidone dose; 
      however, at risperidone doses of 4 to 10 mg/day the incidence of adverse events
      was not significantly higher than that observed in patients receiving placebo.
      Furthermore, adverse events in men were unrelated to plasma prolactin levels.
      Risperidone-associated increase in serum prolactin levels was not significantly
      correlated to the emergence of possible prolactin-related side effects.

TI  - Combination treatment with clozapine and paroxetine in schizophrenia: safety and 
      tolerability data from a prospective open clinical trial.
PG  - 315-20
AB  - Clozapine is a drug with many side effects, some of them with potentially
      hazardous outcome (e.g. seizures, agranulocytosis), if not carefully monitored.
      It has been shown that the metabolism of clozapine may be affected by concomitant
      treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), while there have 
      been reports of improved efficacy on negative symptomatology of clozapine in
      combination with SSRIs. Therefore, this prospective open clinical trial was
      performed to investigate the safety and tolerability of the coadministration of
      clozapine and paroxetine under control of serum concentrations of clozapine and
      its metabolites and the effect of this combination treatment on
      psychopathological outcome was evaluated. A total of 14 patients suffering from
      schizophrenia or schizodepressive disorder with predominant negative
      symptomatology were included. The duration of the study was at least 6 weeks for 
      each patient. Initial treatment was a monotherapy with clozapine at a daily dose 
      of 2.5 mg/kg weight. After two measurements of serum concentrations of clozapine 
      and metabolites during steady state conditions, an add-on therapy with 20 mg
      paroxetine was initiated. No concomitant medication was allowed. The main finding
      of our prospective study was that addition of paroxetine to a monotherapy with
      clozapine was a well tolerated medication that did not give rise to new
      clinically relevant side effects. After addition of paroxetine the serum
      concentrations of clozapine and its major metabolites remained virtually
      constant. The results of the psychopathological measurements indicated a further 
      clinical improvement, although the small open study could not test for efficacy.

TI  - Order of onset of substance abuse and depression in a sample of depressed
      outpatients.
PG  - 44-50
AB  - Drug abuse has been thought to cause depression, or to serve as a form of
      self-medication for depression. Our objective was to examine whether specific
      types of drug abuse preceded or followed the onset of depression. A
      retrospective, blinded case-controlled assessment of the drug and depressive
      history of depressed outpatients was conducted. Three hundred seventy-five
      patients with major depressive disorder were evaluated for comorbid drug
      dependence using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R (SCID). They
      were selected from the psychiatric outpatient department of a metropolitan
      teaching hospital and grouped into homogeneous classes of drug dependence
      including alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, amphetamine, LSD, hypnosedative, opiate,
      and polysubstance use. We determined the percent of depressed patients with each 
      specific type of drug abuse, their age of onset of depression and onset of
      specific drug abuse, and the mean number of lifetime depressive episodes for each
      patient. We found that alcohol dependence followed the onset of first life
      depression by 4.7 years (P = .02, two-tailed). Among polydrug-dependent patients,
      each drug abused followed the onset of depression, except for LSD, which
      coincided with the onset of depression. Among polydrug users, cocaine dependence 
      occurred 6.8 years after the first major depressive episode (P = .007) and
      alcohol dependence 4.5 years after the onset of depression (P = .007). Opiate and
      sedative users had the least number of lifetime depressive episodes (3.7), and
      LSD and cocaine users had the greatest number (12.2). We conclude that alcohol
      and cocaine use in this sample of depressed outpatients conformed to a pattern of
      self-medication.

TI  - Olanzapine versus haloperidol treatment in first-episode psychosis.
PG  - 79-87
AB  - OBJECTIVE: It has been hypothesized that the morbidity and mortality associated
      with schizophrenia can be prevented by providing effective treatment during the
      first episode of psychosis. Hence, the authors examined patients with
      first-episode psychosis to determine the efficacy and safety of olanzapine and
      haloperidol treatment. METHOD: A subpopulation of first-episode patients (N=83)
      from a large prospective, multicenter, international, double-blind, 6-week acute 
      treatment study was evaluated. These patients were selected from a pool of 1,996 
      patients who had a DSM-III-R diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective
      disorder, or schizophreniform disorder and who also met the following criteria:
      1) the length of their current psychotic episode had to be 5 or fewer years, and 
      2) patients had to be 45 years of age or younger at onset of first psychotic
      symptoms. RESULTS: Compared to haloperidol, olanzapine showed a statistically
      significantly greater reduction in the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS)
      total and negative scores and in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total
      and positive scores. Clinical response (defined as 40% or greater improvement in 
      BPRS total score from baseline) was also statistically significantly higher in
      olanzapine-treated patients (67.2%) than in haloperidol-treated patients (29.2%).
      Olanzapine-treated patients further showed statistically significant improvements
      in the Simpson-Angus scale and Barnes Akathisia Scale scores, while
      haloperidol-treated patients showed a worsening on both measures. Compared to
      olanzapine-treated multiple-episode patients in the parent study,
      olanzapine-treated first-episode patients achieved an even statistically
      significantly higher response. Haloperidol-treated first-episode patients
      experienced statistically significantly more extrapyramidal symptoms than
      haloperidol-treated multiple-episode patients. CONCLUSIONS: In patients
      experiencing first-episode psychosis, olanzapine had a risk-benefit profile
      significantly superior to that of haloperidol. The study results suggest that
      novel antipsychotic agents such as olanzapine should be considered as a preferred
      option in first-episode psychosis, on the basis of both safety and efficacy
      advantages.

TI  - Effect of clozapine and adjunctive high-dose glycine in treatment-resistant
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 145-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The focus of this study was the systematic evaluation of the clinical 
      effects of glycine as an adjunct to the atypical antipsychotic clozapine in the
      treatment of schizophrenia. METHOD: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 
      19 patients with chronic, treatment-resistant schizophrenia who were maintained
      on optimal doses of clozapine (400-1200 mg/day) were administered either 30 g/day
      of glycine (N=9) or placebo (N=10) for 12 weeks. Clinical evaluations with the
      Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, the Scale for the Assessment of Negative
      Symptoms, and the Simpson-Angus movement scale were completed biweekly. RESULTS: 
      The use of glycine as an adjunct to clozapine was not effective in decreasing
      positive or negative symptoms. In contrast, the patients treated with clozapine
      without glycine had a 35% reduction in positive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: These
      preliminary data suggest that glycine may interfere with the antipsychotic
      efficacy of atypical neuroleptics such as clozapine.

TI  - The antipsychotics. A pediatric perspective.
PG  - 1205-32
AB  - As can be discerned from this article, antipsychotics are commonly prescribed,
      and they are not used to treat only psychosis. Although some data support the use
      of typical antipsychotics in pediatric patients with a variety of psychiatric
      syndromes, concerns about the safety and tolerability of these agents often
      complicated their use and probably even interfered with case identification. A
      fundamentally new group of medications, the atypicals, have now become available 
      and may not only have improved tolerability but also may have greater ability to 
      reduce some target symptoms. Because of their superior side-effect profile in
      adults, some of these atypical treatments probably will be commonly prescribed
      despite a relative paucity of data about their use in the young. Moreover,
      although frequently prescribed in this age group, the overall prescription rate
      for antipsychotics will probably increase because of the putative improved safety
      profile of the newer agents. However, it is possible that serious side effects,
      such as tardive dyskinesia or neuroleptic malignant syndrome, may occur with
      these atypical agents. For this reason, the enthusiasm for prescribing these
      newer treatments should be tempered with the understanding that these agents,
      although they may in some ways be superior to their predecessors, still possess
      the potential for significant adverse events. Four atypical antipsychotics are
      currently marketed in the United States (see Table 2). One additional agent,
      ziprasodone, is undergoing clinical investigation. Ziprasodone has been shown to 
      be superior to placebo in adults suffering from schizophrenia. Ziprasodone will
      probably be marketed in the United States in the near future. Whether all of
      these atypical drugs will have a place in the clinical armamentarium of the
      pediatric psychopharmacologist remains to be determined. Because the receptor
      binding profile of the atypical agents differ, it is not possible to assume that 
      what is true for one of these agents is true for the others. Although results
      from most preliminary studies with atypical antipsychotics indicate that these
      are promising agents for pediatric patients, further research is needed to define
      just how these medications may be most judiciously used.

TI  - The use of psychostimulants in the pediatric patient.
PG  - 1085-98
AB  - The psychostimulant drugs have a long history of safe and effective usage in the 
      treatment of ADHD. They remain the drugs of first choice in this condition.
      Children with ADHD should be aggressively treated with at least two different
      classes of psychostimulants before moving to nonpsychostimulant agents. As long
      as side effects are not troublesome, higher dosages may be used to adequately
      control the ADHD symptoms, and such high dosages do not impair learning. No
      evidence shows long-term effects of psychostimulants on growth. Effective use of 
      the psychostimulants is essential for any clinician involved in the treatment of 
      children with ADHD.

TI  - Psilocybin induces schizophrenia-like psychosis in humans via a serotonin-2
      agonist action.
PG  - 3897-902
AB  - Psilocybin, an indoleamine hallucinogen, produces a psychosis-like syndrome in
      humans that resembles first episodes of schizophrenia. In healthy human
      volunteers, the psychotomimetic effects of psilocybin were blocked
      dose-dependently by the serotonin-2A antagonist ketanserin or the atypical
      antipsychotic risperidone, but were increased by the dopamine antagonist and
      typical antipsychotic haloperidol. These data are consistent with animal studies 
      and provide the first evidence in humans that psilocybin-induced psychosis is due
      to serotonin-2A receptor activation, independently of dopamine stimulation. Thus,
      serotonin-2A overactivity may be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia
      and serotonin-2A antagonism may contribute to therapeutic effects of
      antipsychotics.

TI  - Pre-anesthetic oral clonidine is effective to prevent post-spinal shivering.
PG  - 137-42
AB  - BACKGROUND: Shivering is a common event during spinal anesthesia. Customarily we 
      just treat it rather than prevent it. This study was designed to evaluate the
      efficacy of oral clonidine as a premedication to prevent post-spinal shivering.
      METHODS: One hundred males of ASA physical status I-III, aged above 40, scheduled
      for elective urological surgery under spinal anesthesia, were included in this
      study. All participants were randomly divided into the clonidine and control
      groups. They received either oral clonidine 150 micrograms (n = 48) or placebo (n
      = 52) 90 min before spinal anesthesia in a double-blind fashion. Spinal blockade 
      was induced with heavy bupivacaine to a dermatomal level near T10. The shivering 
      was graded as: none, no perceptible tension of muscles observed; mild, slight
      muscle tonus (masseter muscle); moderate, real shivering (proximal muscles); and 
      severe, generalized shivering (whole body). The tympanic membrane temperature was
      recorded 30 min after spinal anesthesia. Data were expressed as mean +/- standard
      deviation. Chi-square and Student's t-test were used. A p value less than 0.05
      was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The incidence of post-spinal
      shivering, which was graded as none, mild, moderate, and severe, showed
      statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) between clonidine 150 micrograms
      and placebo (83% vs. 42%, 10% vs. 6%, 10% vs. 19%, 0% vs. 33%, respectively)
      during the 30 min immediately after spinal anesthesia. The respective mean
      tympanic temperature in oral clonidine and placebo groups showed no difference
      (clonidine vs. control = 35.9 +/- 0.8 degrees C vs. 35.9 +/- 0.7 degrees C).
      CONCLUSIONS: Pre-anesthetic medication with oral clonidine 150 micrograms is
      effective to prevent post-spinal shivering in patients undergoing elective
      urological surgery.

TI  - Multiple outcome assessment in a study of the cost-effectiveness of clozapine in 
      the treatment of refractory schizophrenia. Department of Veterans Affairs
      Cooperative Study Group on Clozapine in Refractory Schizophrenia.
PG  - 1237-61
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop new methods for combining results from multiple outcome
      domains and to demonstrate their application in a study of the cost-effectiveness
      of clozapine in treating hospitalized patients with refractory schizophrenia.
      DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Interview assessments, and administrative utilization
      and cost data, concerning 423 patients with refractory schizophrenia who had been
      hospitalized for 30-364 days during the year before study entry, at 15 VA medical
      centers. STUDY DESIGN: A 12-month double-blind trial compared clozapine (n = 205)
      and haloperidol (n = 218) in the treatment of refractory schizophrenia. DATA
      COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: Data from standard assessment instruments,
      gathered at baseline and at 6 weeks, and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, were used to 
      develop a Composite Health Index for Schizophrenia, a measure that addresses
      outcome in six domains, weighted by patient or provider preferences. Cumulative
      improvement was estimated by computing the area under the improvement curve. This
      measure was then combined with cost data, reflecting consumption of societal
      resources to estimate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 
      Clozapine was significantly more effective than haloperidol on measures of
      symptoms (p = .02) and side effects (p < .0001), with nonsignificant trends in
      the positive direction on community role functioning (p = .06), family
      relationships (p = .23), social relationships (p = .30), and daily activities (p 
      = .20). Clozapine was also more effective than haloperidol on the one-year
      cumulative Composite Health Index for Schizophrenia (p < .0001 for all weighting 
      schemes). After converting this measure to a 0-1 Worst Health-Good Health Scale
      analogous to Quality Adjusted Life Years, clozapine was found to yield a small
      improvement of .049 Worst Health-Good Health Units as compared to an improvement 
      of only .027 Units for haloperidol (p < .0001). Average annual costs were $2,733 
      lower for clozapine (95% C.I. = -$9,220 to $3,754). Although clozapine was
      significantly more effective than haloperidol, the summary cost-effectiveness
      ratio had a wide 95 percent confidence interval ranging from -$431,585 to
      $177,352. CONCLUSIONS: Methods demonstrate an approach to using conventional
      disease-specific measures to evaluate the cumulative effectiveness of novel
      treatments for psychotic disorders and for expressing their economic effect as
      cost-effectiveness ratios. Among high hospital users with refractory
      schizophrenia, clozapine is more cost-effective than standard treatment, although

TI  - Ziprasidone 40 and 120 mg/day in the acute exacerbation of schizophrenia and
      schizoaffective disorder: a 4-week placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 173-84
AB  - A double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study, was performed to evaluate 
      the efficacy and safety of ziprasidone in 139 patients with an acute exacerbation
      of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Patients were randomized to receive
      ziprasidone 40 mg/day, 120 mg/day or placebo for 28 days. Ziprasidone 120 mg/day 
      was significantly more effective than placebo in improving the BPRS total, CGI-S.
      BPRS depression cluster and BPRS anergia cluster scores (all P < 0.05).
      Similarly, the percentages of patients classified as responders on the BPRS (> or
      = 30% reduction) and the CGI improvement (score < or = 2) were significantly
      greater with ziprasidone 120 mg/day compared with placebo (P < 0.05). The number 
      of patients who experienced an adverse event was similar in all three treatment
      groups, and discontinuation due to adverse events was rare (five of 91
      ziprasidone-treated patients). The most frequently reported adverse events, that 
      were more common in either ziprasidone group than in the placebo group, were
      dyspepsia, constipation, nausea and abdominal pain. There was a notably low
      incidence extrapyramidal side-effects (including akathisia) and postural
      hypotension and no pattern of laboratory abnormalities or apparent weight gain.
      Ziprasidone-treated patients were not clinically different from placebo-treated
      patients on the Simpson-Angus Rating scale, Barnes Akathisia scale and AIMS
      assessments. These results indicate that ziprasidone 120 mg/day is effective in
      the treatment of the positive, negative and affective symptoms of schizophrenia
      and schizoaffective disorder with a very low side-effect burden.

TI  - A pharmacokinetic interaction between carbamazepine and olanzapine: observations 
      on possible mechanism.
PG  - 639-43
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Olanzapine is a novel antipsychotic, which is effective against both
      the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia and causes fewer
      extrapyramidal adverse effects than conventional antipsychotics. The purpose of
      the present study was to assess the potential for a pharmacokinetic interaction
      between olanzapine and carbamazepine, since these agents are likely to be used
      concomitantly in the treatment of manic psychotic disorder. METHOD: The
      pharmacokinetics of two single therapeutic doses of olanzapine were determined in
      11 healthy volunteers. The first dose of olanzapine (10 mg) was taken alone and
      the second dose (10 mg) after 2 weeks of treatment with carbamazepine (200 mg
      BID). Measurement of urinary 6beta-hydroxycortisol/cortisol excretion was used as
      an endogenous marker to confirm that induction of CYP3A4 by carbamazepine had
      occurred. RESULTS: The dose of olanzapine given after a 2-week pretreatment with 
      carbamazepine was cleared more rapidly than olanzapine given alone. Olanzapine
      pharmacokinetic values for Cmax and AUC were significantly lower after the second
      dose, the elimination half-life was significantly shorter, and the clearance and 
      volume of distribution were significantly increased. CONCLUSION: Carbamazepine
      has been shown to induce several P450 cytochromes including CYP3A4 and CYP1A2.
      Since CYP1A2 plays a role in the metabolic clearance of olanzapine, the
      interaction may be attributed to induction of CYP1A2 by carbamazepine, leading to
      increased first-pass and systemic metabolism of olanzapine. The interaction is
      not considered to be of clinical significance because olanzapine has a wide
      therapeutic index, and the changes in plasma concentration of olanzapine are
      within the fourfold variation that occurs without concern for safety in a patient
      population.

TI  - [Significance of hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes for psychopharmacology].
PG  - 944-55
AB  - Nearly all psychotropic drugs are metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450-enzymes.
      In humans, there are 5 isoenzymes involved in this process. The activity of these
      enzymes can be modulated by a number of commonly used drugs, yielding potentially
      hazardous interactions. Most of the recently introduced selective serotonin
      reuptake inhibitors are potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes. Thus, the
      plasma concentrations of tricyclic antidepressants or clozapine might be elevated
      into toxic levels. In contrast, carbamazepine induces most of the isoenzymes.
      This potentiates the elimination of tricyclics and antipsychotics and might cause
      a serious risk for the recurrence of depressive or psychotic symptoms. Moreover, 
      5-10% of the population are slow metabolizers of CYP2D6. This group is prone to
      increased adverse effects of moderately dosed medication. This review
      systematically points out the reported or predicted pharmacokinetic drug
      interactions in psychopharmacology focussing on clinical significance.

TI  - [Central stimulants in adults with AD/HD. Do they help?].
PG  - 4223-7
AB  - This article is a review of five controlled studies of the efficacy of
      methylphenidate in adults with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD). 
      All five had a placebo cross-over design. In one of the studies, patients noted
      from the side-effects whether they were taking methylphenidate or placebo, and it
      is, in fact, unlikely that any of the studies were blind. The diagnostic criteria
      used in two of the studies were not appropriate according to present knowledge,
      leaving three samples of subjects meeting the present criteria for AD/HD. In one 
      study, the patient material was extremely selective: 74% of subjects belonged to 
      social class 1 and 2, and only 35% of those who came for treatment were eligible.
      Only one study has an acceptable (though not perfect) design. In this study of
      patients in a psychiatric clinic, no difference was found between methylphenidate
      and placebo. In two studies, subjects who improved on methylphenidate were
      followed up. Of the total of 24 subjects in these two samples, only four
      continued with methylphenidate after 3-12 months; two of them suffered from
      narcolepsy and one was a substance abuser. Thus, the efficacy of methylphenidate 
      on AD/HD in adults has not been demonstrated. Present research is more against
      than in favour of its existence.

TI  - Oral clonidine premedication enhances the pressor response to ephedrine during
      spinal anesthesia.
PG  - 1336-9
AB  - Clonidine premedication enhances the pressor effects of ephedrine in awake and
      anesthetized patients. To test the hypothesis that clonidine augments the pressor
      response to ephedrine during spinal anesthesia, 48 ASA physical status I or II
      patients were randomly assigned to either the clonidine group (n = 23), receiving
      oral clonidine approximately 5 microg/kg 90 min before spinal anesthesia, or the 
      control group (n = 25), receiving no clonidine. Spinal anesthesia was performed
      at either the L2-3 or the L3-4 interspace using 0.5% hyperbaric tetracaine
      solution 1.4-3.0 mL. Blood pressure (BP), heart rate, and the upper dermatomal
      level of analgesia were determined at 1-min intervals with the patient in the
      supine position after tetracaine injections. When systolic BP decreased to <80%
      of the prespinal value or <100 mm Hg, IV ephedrine 0.2 mg/kg was administered as 
      a bolus. There were no differences in the duration until the first dose of
      ephedrine after tetracaine injections, and the upper level of analgesia between
      groups (control group 8.5+/-3.7 min, T5; clonidine group 7.7+/-2.7 min, T6).
      Although prespinal and preephedrine BP values were higher in the control group,
      the magnitude of increases in mean BP after ephedrine was significantly greater
      in the clonidine group (P < 0.05). We conclude that oral clonidine premedication 
      augments the pressor response to IV ephedrine during spinal anesthesia.
      IMPLICATIONS: The pressor effect of ephedrine is enhanced in patients given oral 
      clonidine premedication during spinal anesthesia.

TI  - Psychopharmacologic treatment of acquired attention disorders in children with
      brain injury.
PG  - 121-6
AB  - This investigation examined the efficacy of psychostimulant therapy in
      alleviating neurobehavioral dysfunction attendant to pediatric brain injury. The 
      most commonly reported neurobehavioral sequelae associated with head injury in
      the pediatric population involve deficits along the attentional matrix. This is
      also the most common objectively documented neurobehavioral finding among
      children as well as adults. There are several investigations in the adult
      literature which have employed the use of psychostimulants in treating both
      psychiatric and neuropsychological residua associated with head injury. Overall, 
      the results of these studies are equivocal, but suggest a beneficial impact on
      general functioning. The present prospective investigation utilized a
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over experimental design to examine the
      efficacy of methylphenidate in treating children with acquired attentional
      disorders secondary to brain injury. A cohort of 14 children with varying degrees
      of head injury were recruited for participation. As expected, differences between
      drug and placebo conditions uniformly achieved statistical significance.
      Additionally, there were no differences in performance between baseline and
      placebo conditions on neurobehavioral tasks of attention and concentration.
      Current findings suggest that methylphenidate (and probably other
      psychostimulants such as Cylert, Adderal, Wellbutrin and dextroamphetamine
      sulfate) is an extremely effective agent in treating attentional disorders
      secondary to brain injury in children.

TI  - Post-marketing studies: the work of the Drug Safety Research Unit.
PG  - 343-53
AB  - The Drug Safety Research Unit (DSRU) is the centre for prescription-event
      monitoring (PEM) in England. PEM studies are noninterventional observational
      cohort studies which monitor the safety of newly marketed drugs. The need for
      post-marketing surveillance is well recognised in the UK and general practice is 
      an ideal source of data. PEM studies are general practitioner (community)-based
      and exposure is based on dispensed prescription data in England. To date, 65 PEM 
      studies have been completed with a mean cohort size of 10 979 patients and the
      DSRU database has clinical information on over 700000 patients prescribed new
      drugs. Unlike spontaneous reporting schemes, PEM produces incidence rates for
      events reported during treatment. Comparative studies can be conducted for drugs 
      in the same class. The DSRU aggregates outcome data for pregnancies exposed to
      new drugs. Data for children and the elderly can also be specifically examined.
      PEM data have a number of advantages over data from computerised general practice
      databases in the UK. PEM is the only technique within the UK capable of
      monitoring newly marketed drugs in such a comprehensive and systematic way.

TI  - Clozapine effects on force control in schizophrenic patients.
PG  - 39-48
AB  - We previously reported significant differences in force control (FC) function
      between schizophrenics treated with typical antipsychotic drugs (APD) and those
      treated with clozapine. Clozapine treatment was associated with an attenuation of
      the capacity for fine motor control. We now report that a test-retest study with 
      41 treatment-refractory patients confirms our earlier finding; the FC deficit is 
      due primarily to clozapine treatment. An additional comparison was made with 10
      patients who were administered the FC test repeatedly through the initial
      clozapine titration interval of 6-8 weeks. The results suggest that two distinct 
      clozapine effects can be distinguished, an initial transient stage characterized 
      by 'drowsiness' and a subsequent stage with dose-dependent emerging myoclonic
      features.

TI  - Medical control of intraocular pressure after cataract surgery.
PG  - 1493-7
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the effectiveness of 2 medications commonly used to prevent
      intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation in the early period after cataract surgery. 
      SETTING: Palo Alto Veterans Affairs Health Care System, Palo Alto, California,
      USA. METHODS: This prospective study comprised 202 eyes of patients scheduled for
      cataract extraction who agreed to participate. Patients were randomized to
      receive oral acetazolamide, 500 mg 1 hour preoperatively; oral acetazolamide, 500
      mg immediately postoperatively; apraclonidine hydrochloride 1%, 2 drops 1 hour
      preoperatively; or artificial tears (control group). Intraocular pressure was
      measured preoperatively and 4 to 6 and 24 hours postoperatively. RESULTS:
      Preoperative IOP was not significantly different among the 4 groups. At 4 to 6
      hours postoperatively, only preoperative acetazolamide was significantly more
      effective than the control medication (P = .038); at 24 hours there were no
      significant differences among the 4 groups. Postoperative IOP elevation in excess
      of 35 mm Hg at 6 or 24 hours decreased significantly in the preoperative
      acetazolamide group (3/46 eyes) compared with the control group (14/54 eyes).
      There was no statistically significant difference in IOP elevation between eyes
      having extracapsular cataract extraction and those having phacoemulsification,
      independent of treatment group. CONCLUSION: The results favor preoperative
      acetazolamide to control postcataract IOP elevation. The method of cataract
      removal did not affect postoperative IOP elevation.

TI  - Clinical and neurocognitive effects of clozapine and risperidone in
      treatment-refractory schizophrenic patients: a prospective study.
PG  - 521-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few controlled studies have compared the efficacy of clozapine and
      risperidone in treatment-refractory schizophrenic patients. The present study
      investigates the efficacy of both clozapine and risperidone on psychopathologic
      and neurocognitive measures in a prospective 12-week open-label trial in
      treatment-refractory schizophrenic patients from state psychiatric hospitals.
      METHOD: Thirty-five DSM-IV schizophrenic patients with a documented history of
      nonresponse to typical neuroleptics were treated with either clozapine or
      risperidone. Response was assessed every 2 weeks by independent raters with the
      Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Clinical Global Impressions
      (CGI) scale, neurologic rating scales, and plasma drug levels. Neurocognitive
      tests were administered at baseline and week 12. RESULTS: Both clozapine and
      risperidone brought about significant (p < .003) overall improvement in
      psychopathology. However, clozapine was numerically superior to risperidone on
      PANSS total scores and PANSS positive, negative, excitement, and cognitive
      factors. Extrapyramidal side effects were minimal for clozapine, whereas some
      were present for risperidone. Patients taking risperidone improved significantly 
      in the beginning stages of the study and remained stable thereafter. Patients
      taking clozapine showed a gradual improvement that occurred over the entire
      length of the trial. Neurocognitive measures showed minimal improvement and did
      not differentiate between the 2 medication groups. CONCLUSION: Both clozapine and
      risperidone were comparably effective across a wide spectrum of psychopathologic 
      measures. While the efficacy of clozapine was only numerically superior to that
      of risperidone, it was associated with fewer extrapyramidal side effects and with
      progressive improvement over the 12-week treatment period, suggesting that in
      longer trials clozapine may prove to be superior to risperidone in
      neuroleptic-refractory patients.

TI  - Use of the restricted academic task in ADHD dose-response relationships.
PG  - 608-12
AB  - Behavioral assessment techniques have been shown to make a significant
      contribution in the evaluation of stimulant medication response in children with 
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. This article examines the role of a
      behavioral measure consisting of standardized observation of a child while he or 
      she performs an academic-like task (Restricted Academic Task). This technique is 
      reliable and valid for repeated administrations across medication dosages and
      placebo. It can assist in optimizing medication dosage for individual children,
      given its sensitivity to dosage effects. It also allows the capture of
      medication-related changes in an area of functioning that is not directly
      assessed by parent and teacher judgments and ratings. In this way the Restricted 
      Academic Task may have greater ecological validity than the results of other,
      more traditional in-clinic measures. Finally, given the idiosyncratic nature of
      stimulant medication effects on individual children, it contributes to the
      explication of a specific child's behavioral dose-response relationship.

TI  - Evaluating medication response in ADHD: cognitive, behavioral, and single-subject
      methodology.
PG  - 595-607
AB  - Although evidence supports the use of double-blind placebo medication trials to
      evaluate methylphenidate (MPH) effects on the core behavioral symptoms of
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), few studies have demonstrated
      their utility in examining MPH effects on the cognitive deficits associated with 
      ADHD. This article presents a technique for evaluating behavioral and cognitive
      dose-response relationships at the single-subject level of analysis. Case study
      results and multivariate analyses suggest that systematic evaluation of
      behavioral and cognitive MPH dose-response relationships could lead to more
      accurate MPH titration and greater long-term multimodal treatment efficacy.

TI  - School-based methylphenidate placebo protocols: methodological and practical
      issues.
PG  - 581-94, 614
AB  - Around 1990, psychologists and educators began to notice increasing use of
      methylphenidate by students. Diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity
      disorder by family physicians and pediatricians was most commonly based on brief 
      behavioral descriptions by parents and, infrequently, by use of rating scales. At
      that time, the present researchers began to explore the development of a
      school-based, methodologically sound, and inexpensive method of assessing the
      efficacy of stimulant medications, which would ensure reasonable compliance by
      teachers, parents, and students in monitoring the effects of medications and
      placebos. This article focuses on the methodological issues involved in choosing 
      instruments to monitor behavior, once a comprehensive evaluation has suggested
      trials on Ritalin. Case examples illustrate problems of teacher compliance in
      filling out measures, supplying adequate placebos, and obtaining physician
      cooperation, and with the practical issue of providing adequate data without
      overwhelming the time and resources of participants. Emerging school-based
      methodologies are discussed with recommendations for future efforts.

AB  - The sleep profiles of 13 children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
      (ADHD) who were treated with a fixed dose of methylphenidate for at least 1 month
      were compared with those of 16 healthy siblings. Sleep disturbances were assessed
      according to a structured sleep questionnaire, and the severity of ADHD was
      evaluated via the Conners Parents Teachers Rating Scale. The results indicated
      that significantly more children with ADHD demonstrated single or multiple sleep 
      disturbances as well as higher rates of specific sleep disorders, such as initial
      and middle insomnia, compared with their siblings. No correlation was found
      between the severity of ADHD and disturbed sleep. Sleep duration and satisfaction
      with sleep were similar in the two groups. These findings raise important
      questions regarding the association between ADHD and disturbed sleep.

TI  - Prospective study of tobacco smoking and substance dependencies among samples of 
      ADHD and non-ADHD participants.
PG  - 533-44
AB  - This study focused on an audience at high risk for heavy use of licit and illicit
      substances: young adults who as children had attention-deficit/hyperactivity
      disorder (ADHD). The participants in this study were part of a longitudinal study
      of the life histories of 492 children, one third of whom were identified as
      hyperactive in 1974 and whose childhood symptom ratings and medical histories
      were used to establish Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (3rd
      ed., revised; DSM-III-R) ADHD diagnoses (American Psychiatric Association, 1987).
      The objectives of the study centered on describing (a) developmental history of
      tobacco use among ADHD and non-ADHD participants in a longitudinal sample, (b)
      the characteristic adult patterns of tobacco use from early adolescence through
      early adulthood, and (c) the relationship between ADHD status and tobacco and
      substance dependence outcomes. Adult data were obtained for 81% of the original
      492 participants (77% of the ADHD and 86% of the controls). Lifetime and current 
      tobacco use were assessed from child, adolescent, and adult data, yielding eight 
      measures of smoking status. The study showed that participants with and without
      ADHD did not differ in age of initiation to smoking, but there was a significant 
      difference in the age they began smoking regularly. By age 17, 46% of all
      participants with ADHD, as contrasted with 24% of the age-mate controls, reported
      smoking cigarettes daily. In adulthood, the proportion of participants with ADHD 
      who were current smokers (42%) continued to exceed that of the age-mate controls 
      (26%). Among current adult smokers, 35% with ADHD smoked daily as compared to 16%
      of the age-mate controls. There were significantly different lifetime tobacco
      dependence rates--40% compared to 19% for age-mate controls. The rates for
      cocaine dependence were 21% for participants with ADHD and 10% for age-mate
      controls. We reported a significant difference in rates of daily smoking and
      tobacco dependence for those with ADHD who had used stimulant medication in
      childhood in contrast to controls. Results were interpreted to support a possible
      link between ADHD treatment histories and levels of tobacco smoking and tobacco
      dependence in adulthood.

TI  - I.v. clonidine prevents post-extradural shivering.
PG  - 145-6
AB  - We have studied the efficacy of i.v. clonidine to prevent shivering in 100
      healthy patients who received extradural block for knee arthroscopy. Patients
      were randomly allocated to two groups. Just before extradural anaesthesia (0 min 
      = baseline), group I (n = 50) received i.v. clonidine 1 microgram kg-1, group II 
      (n = 50) received a saline bolus. Systolic arterial pressure (SAP), heart rate
      (HR), oxygen saturation (SpO2), cutaneous temperature and level of sedation, were
      all recorded at baseline and after 10, 20, 30, 45, 60 min. Shivering was
      evaluated by a blinded investigator for a period of 90 min and was graded as
      moderate or severe. Three patients in group I shivered compared with 19 in group 
      II (P < 0.001). Patients with severe shivering were seen only in group II. There 
      were no significant differences between the groups during the study period in
      SAP, HR, SpO2, cutaneous temperature or level of sedation. We conclude that
      preventive use of i.v. clonidine 1 microgram kg-1 provides a significant
      reduction in the incidence of post-extradural shivering without clinically
      relevant adverse side effects.

TI  - Hemodynamic changes induced by laparoscopy and their endocrine correlates:
      effects of clonidine.
PG  - 1389-96
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We investigated endocrine correlates of the hemodynamic changes
      induced by carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum (PNO). We then studied whether
      clonidine might modulate the hemodynamic changes induced by PNO by reducing
      release of catecholamines and vasopressin. BACKGROUND: Both mechanical and
      neurohumoral factors contribute to the hemodynamic changes induced by carbon
      dioxide PNO. Several mediators have been proposed, but no study has correlated
      hemodynamic changes with changes in levels of these potential mediators. METHODS:
      We conducted two studies, each including 20 healthy patients scheduled for
      elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In the first study serial measurements of 
      hemodynamics (thermodilution technique) were done during laparoscopy and after
      exsufflation. Plasma concentrations of cortisol, catecholamines, vasopressin,
      renin, endothelin and prostaglandins were measured at the same time points. In
      the second study patients were randomly allocated to receive 8 microg/kg
      clonidine infused over 1 h or placebo before PNO. Hemodynamics and plasma levels 
      of cortisol, catecholamines and vasopressin were measured during PNO and after
      exsufflation. RESULTS: Peritoneal insufflation resulted in a significant
      reduction of cardiac output (18+/-4%) and increases in mean arterial pressure
      (39+/-8%) and systemic (70+/-12%) and pulmonary (98+/-18%) vascular resistances. 
      Laparoscopy resulted in progressive and significant increases in plasma
      concentrations of cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine and renin. Vasopressin
      plasma concentrations markedly increased immediately after the beginning of PNO
      (before PNO 6+/-4 pg/ml; during PNO 129+/-42 pg/ml; p < 0.05). The profile of
      vasopressin release paralleled the time course of changes in systemic vascular
      resistance. Prostaglandins and endothelin did not change significantly. Clonidine
      significantly reduced mean arterial pressure, heart rate and the increase in
      systemic vascular resistance. Clonidine also significantly reduced catecholamine 
      concentrations but did not alter vasopressin and cortisol plasma concentrations. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Vasopressin and catecholamines probably mediate the increase in
      systemic vascular resistance observed during PNO. Clonidine before PNO reduces
      catecholamine release and attenuates hemodynamic changes during laparoscopy.

TI  - Incidence of hypotension and bradycardia during integrated epidural/general
      anaesthesia. An epidemiologic observational study on 1200 consecutive patients.
      Italian Study Group on Integrated Anaesthesia.
PG  - 313-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Combined epidural/general anaesthesia might theoretically emphasise
      the cardiovascular effects of epidural block alone. The goal of the present
      investigation was to evaluate the incidence of both hypotension and bradycardia
      during integrated epidural/general anaesthesia in a multicentric, observational
      study. METHODS: The incidence of clinical hypotension (systolic arterial blood
      pressure decrease by 30% or more from baseline), and bradycardia (heart rate < 50
      beats/min) and other side effects have been evaluated in 1200 consecutive
      patients receiving integrated epidural/general anaesthesia. The time from
      induction of epidural anaesthesia to induction of general anaesthesia was
      considered as preoperative; while the time after general anaesthesia induction
      was considered as intraoperative. RESULTS: Preoperatively hypotension developed
      in 85 patients (2.8%), and bradycardia in 54 patients (4.5%). Intraoperatively,
      hypotension was observed in 380 patients (31.6%), and bradycardia in 153 patients
      (12.7%). Hypotension and bradycardia were not influenced by the type of surgical 
      procedure, the type of maintenance of general anaesthesia (inhalational versus
      total intravenous general anaesthesia) and the level of epidural block (lumbar
      versus thoracic); but they were more frequent in patients with ASA physical
      status II and III-IV compared to patients with ASA physical status I (p < 0.05). 
      Prophylactic volume preload decreased the incidence of hypotension from 41.5% to 
      22.4% (p < 0.0001), while prophylactic atropine before epidural block did not
      affect the incidence of bradycardia. Patients receiving epidural clonidine showed
      an increased incidence of intraoperative bradycardia compared to those who did
      not receive it (p < 0.0001). DISCUSSION: Randomized, controlled studies should be
      advocated in order to compare the incidence of hypotension and bradycardia during
      integrated anaesthesia and during epidural block alone. Our results demonstrated 
      that the use of integrated epidural/general anaesthesia produces an incidence of 
      perioperative hypotension and bradycardia similar to that reported when central
      blocks are used alone.

TI  - The effect of 0.25% apraclonidine in preventing intraocular pressure elevation
      after Nd:YAG laser posterior capsulotomy.
PG  - 167-72
AB  - PURPOSE: The efficacy and adverse effects of 0.25% apraclonidine on intraocular
      pressure (IOP) after Nd:YAG laser posterior capsulotomy were investigated, and
      the results were compared with placebo, 0.50% timolol maleate and 1%
      apraclonidine. METHODS: Eighty eyes were randomly assigned to four groups of 20
      eyes. In a double-masked design, the groups were treated with placebo (group 1), 
      0.50% timolol maleate (group 2), 1% apraclonidine (group 3), 0.25% apraclonidine 
      (group 4) one hour before and five minutes after Nd:YAG laser posterior
      capsulotomy. IOP was measured by applanation tonometry 1 hour before (baseline
      IOP) and 1, 3, 24 hours after capsulotomy. RESULTS: The average baseline IOP
      increased respectively 3.90 +/- 5.35, 5.95 +/- 5.32, 1.15 +/- 3.20 mmHg in the
      first group 1, 3 and 24 hours post-treatment. There were significant differences 
      between baseline IOP and 1 and 3 hours but not at 24 hours (p = 0.004, p = 0.001,
      p = 0.13). IOP increased 0.40 +/- 4.08, 0.75 +/- 5.33, 0.80 +/- 6.03 mmHg in the 
      second group at the same times. The differences between the average baseline IOP 
      and the 1, 3 and 24 h measurement were not significant (p = 0.83, p = 0.65, p =
      0.93). In the third group, IOP decreased 3.70 +/- 2.40, 3.30 +/- 2.47, 2.65 +/-
      1.56 mmHg at the measurement times, with significant differences between the
      average baseline IOP and the 1, 3 and 24 hour measurements (p = 0.001, p =
      0.0001, p = 0.01). In the fourth group IOP increased 0.35 +/- 3.32 mmHg at 1
      hour, but decreased 1.25 +/- 3.41, 0.90 +/- 2.07 mmHg at 3 and 24 hours. The
      differences were not significant (p = 0.94, p = 0.16, p = 0.08). When the 0.25%
      and 1% apraclonidine groups were compared, there were significant differences
      between the average IOP at 1 hour in both groups but not at 3 and 24 hours (p =
      0.01, p = 0.17, p = 0.21). Similarly, there were no significant differences
      between the average IOP at the same times when the 0.25% apraclonidine group was 
      compared with the timolol group (p = 0.30, p = 0.08, p = 0.16). Some systemic and
      local side effects were seen in the timolol and 1% apraclonidine groups, but none
      with 0.25% apraclonidine. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that 0.25% apraclonidine 
      is effective in preventing the early elevation of IOP after Nd:YAG laser
      posterior capsulotomy and may offer an alternative to 0.50% timolol maleate and
      1% apraclonidine.

TI  - Attentional improvement following quetiapine fumarate treatment in schizophrenia.
PG  - 151-5
AB  - This study examined changes in attentional performance in patients with
      schizophrenia during the 2 months after initiating treatment with quetiapine
      fumarate. Prior to treatment, attentional performance in patients with
      schizophrenia (n = 10) was significantly (p < 0.01) worse than in matched
      controls (n = 12). During treatment with quetiapine, performance in patients with
      schizophrenia improved, and by 2 months, did not differ significantly from that
      of the controls. These results suggest that quetiapine produces a significant
      improvement in attentional functioning in patients with schizophrenia.

PG  - 340-51
AB  - Determined the efficacy of methylphenidate (MPH) in a clinical population of
      aggressive, urban children diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity
      disorder (ADHD). In previous studies of prepubertal children with ADHD, MPH has
      been shown to be effective when compared with placebo. Eighteen inner-city
      children (ages 6 to 12 years), diagnosed with ADHD and attending a summer
      treatment program for youth with disruptive behavior disorders, participated in a
      double-blind placebo trial with assessment data obtained from staff in the
      program and parents at home. Based on staff ratings of the children's behavior in
      the program and an academic classroom, the children displayed significant
      improvements in ADHD symptoms and aggressive behavior with low- and high-dose MPH
      conditions. At home, parents and guardians reported few significant differences
      between placebo and MPH on behavior ratings. In both settings, MPH was well
      tolerated with few side effects found during active drug conditions.

TI  - "Saturday night fever": ecstasy related problems in a London accident and
      emergency department.
PG  - 322-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To report on the extent and nature of acute MDMA (ecstasy) related
      problems presenting to a large London hospital's accident and emergency (A&E)
      department. METHOD: The computerised attendance records for all patients
      attending the A&E department over a 15 month period were retrospectively
      screened. Potential cases thus identified had their case notes systematically
      reviewed to confirm the history of MDMA use and to extract other relevant data.
      RESULTS: Forty eight consecutive MDMA related cases were identified. All were in 
      the 15-30 year age group with the majority presenting in the early hours at
      weekends and having consumed the drug at a night club. The mean number of tablets
      consumed was two and almost 40% had taken MDMA before. Polydrug use was common
      with half of the sample having concurrently taken another illicit substance--most
      commonly other stimulants (amphetamines and cocaine). A wide range of adverse
      clinical features was found. The most common symptoms were vague and non-specific
      such as feeling strange or unwell, however many patients had collapsed or lost
      consciousness. The most common signs elicited were related to sympathetic
      overactivity, agitation/disturbed behaviour, and increased temperature. The more 
      serious complications of delirium, seizures, and profound unconsciousness (coma) 
      were commoner when MDMA was used in combination with other substances.
      CONCLUSIONS: For young adults presenting late at night at weekends and exhibiting
      symptoms of sympathetic overactivity, disturbed behaviour, and increased
      temperature ("Saturday night fever") the use of stimulant dance drugs especially 
      MDMA should be suspected. As MDMA use does not appear to occur in isolation, the 
      clinical picture is likely to be complicated by multiple rather than single drug 
      ingestion. This poses increased diagnostic and management challenges for A&E
      staff who typically represent the front line response to dance drug related
      problems.

TI  - Chronic olanzapine or sertindole treatment results in reduced oral chewing
      movements in rats compared to haloperidol.
PG  - 428-33
AB  - Chronic haloperidol treatment typically produces late-onset, purposeless oral
      chewing movements in laboratory rats with a prevalence of 40 to 60%. Chronic
      clozapine does not produce these movements. Based on the phenomenologic and
      pharmacologic similarities between these rat chewing movements and human tardive 
      dyskinesia (TD), the animal movements are often used as a model of tardive
      dyskinesia (TD). Here we report results of the association of oral chewing
      movements in rats with chronic administration of two new antipsychotic drugs,
      olanzapine and sertindole. Because each of these antipsychotic drugs has a very
      low incidence of acute Parkinsonism in human studies, they are candidates for
      showing a low tardive dyskinesia risk. Neither new drug produced a significant
      incidence of haloperidol-like chewing in rats, nor did movement ratings after
      their chronic administration differ from placebo; whereas, haloperidol produced a
      60% prevalence of purposeless chewing and a prevalence significantly increased
      from placebo. This low rate of oral dyskinesias in rats is consistent with
      several of the preclinical characteristics of the drugs and correlates with their
      low acute motor side effects in clinical trials. We propose, although have not
      yet tested in humans, that these animal results will predict low TD liability of 
      these drugs.

TI  - Epidural fentanyl, adrenaline and clonidine as adjuvants to local anaesthetics
      for surgical analgesia: meta-analyses of analgesia and side-effects.
PG  - 910-20
AB  - BACKGROUND: The risk/benefit ratio of adding fentanyl, adrenaline and clonidine
      to epidural local anaesthetics for improving intraoperative analgesia is unclear.
      This meta-analysis was performed to clarify this issue. METHODS: Trials retrieved
      by search were considered if they were prospective, controlled, epidural
      analgesia (without combining general anaesthesia) was planned and occurrence of
      pain during surgery or side-effects were reported. Papers entered meta-analysis
      if they reached a predefined minimum quality score. Pooled odds ratios (OR) and
      confidence intervals (CI) were computed. P < 0.05 was considered as significant. 
      RESULTS: Eighteen trials were included in the analysis for fentanyl. Fentanyl
      decreased the likelihood of pain (OR = 0.21, 95% CI = 0.15-0.30, P < 0.001) and
      increased the incidence of pruritus (OR = 5.59, 95% CI = 3.12-10.05, P < 0.001)
      and sedation (OR = 1.88, 95% CI = 1.19-2.98, P = 0.003), compared to control
      (local anaesthetic without fentanyl). Fentanyl had no effect on respiratory
      depression, nausea, vomiting and Apgar score. One case of respiratory depression 
      of a newborn was observed. Because of the very low number of trials selected,
      evaluation of adrenaline and clonidine was not feasible. CONCLUSION: The analysis
      of current literature shows that the addition of fentanyl to local anaesthetics
      for intraoperative epidural analgesia is safe and advantageous. The reduction in 
      the incidence of pain during surgery is quantitatively high and therefore
      clinically significant. Side-effects are mild. Randomized, controlled trials have
      to be performed in order to clarify the role of adrenaline and clonidine as
      epidural adjuvants for surgical analgesia.

TI  - Effects of premedication on dose requirements for propofol: comparison of
      clonidine and hydroxyzine.
PG  - 733-6
AB  - The influence of a single dose of clonidine (5 micrograms kg-1) or hydroxyzine (1
      mg kg-1) on intraoperative propofol requirements was determined in 28 male
      patients (ASA I) undergoing elective orthopaedic surgery. Patients were randomly 
      allocated to receive either clonidine or hydroxyzine orally 2 h before induction 
      of anaesthesia. After a loading dose of propofol (2.5 mg kg-1), mivacurium (0.2
      mg kg-1) and alfentanil (15 micrograms kg-1), anaesthesia was maintained with a
      standardized propofol infusion supplemented with nitrous oxide (66%) in oxygen.
      During surgery, additional propofol boluses (1 mg kg-1) were administered when
      heart rate or mean arterial pressure increased by more than 10% compared with
      preinduction values. The clonidine group demonstrated a 14.5% decrease in total
      propofol requirements (P < 0.05) and a 52.2% reduction in additional propofol
      boluses (P < 0.02) in comparison with the hydroxyzine group. intraoperative heart
      rate and mean arterial pressure were significantly lower in the clonidine group
      but no patients needed treatment with ephedrine for hypotension or bradycardia.
      Recovery of psychomotor function and discharge from the recovery room were not
      delayed in the clonidine group. This study indicates that 5 micrograms kg-1
      clonidine given as premedication in ASA I patients reduces intraoperative
      propofol requirements in comparison with 1 mg kg-1 hydroxyzine without inducing
      adverse effects on recovery or haemodynamic stability.

TI  - Failure of clonidine to stimulate feeding in healthy humans.
PG  - 317-21
AB  - The alpha2-adrenergic system is involved in the regulation of food intake in
      animals but its effects on feeding in humans are unknown. We hypothesized that
      clonidine administration would stimulate food intake in healthy human subjects.
      Ten men and 4 women, all physically and psychiatrically healthy, received
      clonidine 3 microg/kg or placebo, orally, in blinded, balanced, randomized order.
      Consumption of a liquid test meal was measured; also, serum growth hormone levels
      were used as a secondary measure of clonidine effects. Visual analog scale
      ratings of hunger, satiety, and sedation were obtained before, during, and after 
      the test meal. A subset of five subjects also received 1.5 microg/kg clonidine,
      in addition to the two trials described above. Test meal consumption was greater 
      following placebo than following clonidine. Sedation ratings were substantially
      higher at all time points after clonidine and correlated with meal consumption
      (correlation coefficient r = -0.584; p = 0.028). Hunger and satiety ratings did
      not differ. The 1.5 microg/kg dose did not provide different effects on feeding
      from that seen with placebo. Contrary to our hypothesis, clonidine did not
      stimulate food intake in humans. Sedation associated with clonidine
      administration may have suppressed any effects on feeding.

TI  - Dopamine transporter occupancies in the human brain induced by therapeutic doses 
      of oral methylphenidate.
PG  - 1325-31
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The therapeutic effects of methylphenidate in the treatment of
      attention deficit disorder have been attributed to its ability to increase the
      synaptic concentration of dopamine by blocking the dopamine transporters.
      However, the levels of dopamine transporter blockade achieved by therapeutic
      doses of methylphenidate are not known. This study measured, for the first time, 
      dopamine transporter occupancy by orally administered methylphenidate in the
      human brain and its rate of uptake in the brain. METHOD: Positron emission
      tomography (PET) and [11C]cocaine were used to estimate dopamine transporter
      occupancies after different doses of oral methylphenidate in seven normal
      subjects (mean age=24 years, SD=7). In addition, the pharmacokinetics of oral
      methylphenidate were measured in the baboon brain through use of PET and
      [11C]methylphenidate administered through an orogastric tube. RESULTS: At 120
      minutes after administration, oral methylphenidate produced a dose-dependent
      blockade of dopamine transporter; means=12% (SD= 4%) for 5 mg, 40% (SD=12%) for
      10 mg, 54% (SD=5%) for 20 mg, 72% (SD=3%) for 40 mg, and 74% (SD=2%) for 60 mg.
      The estimated dose of oral methylphenidate required to block 50% of the dopamine 
      transporter corresponded to 0.25 mg/kg. Oral methylphenidate did not reach peak
      concentration in brain until 60 minutes after its administration. CONCLUSIONS:
      Oral methylphenidate is very effective in blocking dopamine transporters, and at 
      the weight-adjusted doses used therapeutically (0.3 to 0.6 mg/kg), it is likely
      to occupy more than 50% of the dopamine transporters. The time to reach peak
      brain uptake for oral methylphenidate in brain corresponds well with the reported
      time course to reach peak behavioral effects.

TI  - [Dose-response relationship of clonidine with epidural administration of
      ropivacaine in orthopedic procedures of the lower extremities].
PG  - 565-70
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate preliminarydose-range effects
      of clonidine added to ropivacaine for epidural analgesia in elective orthopedic
      surgery of the lower limbs with doses, causing a minimum of cardiovascular side
      effects. METHODS: 60 patients were randomly assigned to receive in a double-blind
      fashion a mixture of 1 mg/cm height ropivacaine plus saline or 1 mg/cm
      ropivacaine plus 25 micrograms, 50 micrograms, 75 micrograms, 100 micrograms or
      150 micrograms clonidine for epidural analgesia. The sensory and motor function
      were determined at defined time intervals for 30 minutes. Heart rate and blood
      pressure were controlled and sedation score was judged. The postoperative
      2-segment-regression of pin-prick and the onset of pain were recorded. RESULTS:
      The six groups were comparable in demographic data and in term of onset time. The
      prolongation of analgesia reached 513 +/- 92 min (p = 0.002) for 150 micrograms
      clonidine, 460 +/- 148 min (p = 0.073) for 100 micrograms clonidine, 440 +/- 86
      min (p = 0.057) for 75 micrograms clonidine compared with 347 +/- 114 min for
      saline. In an equal manner, 2-segment-regression for pin-prick was extended to
      251 +/- 47 min (p = 0.018) for 150 micrograms clonidine, 238 +/- 33 min (p =
      0.034) for 100 micrograms clonidine, 229 +/- 29 min (p = 0.027) for 75 micrograms
      clonidine and 178 +/- 43 min for saline. Heart rate dropped down in all groups.
      Mean arterial pressure decreased significantly in the groups with 75, 100 and 150
      micrograms clonidine. Sedation score increased continuously from 0.6 +/- 0.5
      (saline) to 1.8 +/- 0.8 (150 micrograms clonidine). CONCLUSION: We conclude that 
      150 micrograms clonidine significantly enhances the duration of analgesia of
      epidurally administered ropivacaine in a mean of 171 mg. This time interval is
      longer than the one with 200 mg ropivacaine alone. But, there are side effects in
      form of decrease of arterial pressure. Cardiovascular monitoring seems to be
      essential. Because of the enhanced analgesia duration, the time interval for
      reloading epidural anaesthesia are increased.

AB  - Discrimination of stimulant-responding and nonresponding groups of children with 
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) on the basis of demographic,
      neurophysiologic, or behavioral variables would be beneficial for clinical and
      theoretical reasons. Previous researchers have identified many predictor
      variables, but relationships between predictor and criterion variables generally 
      have been subtle. In addition, few investigations have considered the relative
      predictive power of the variables. The present study evaluated the multivariate
      relationship between several predictor variables and response to medication in
      336 children with ADHD. Neurologic status, inattention, and overactivity were
      found to be most likely to predict good response to psychostimulants, whether
      rated by parents or teachers. Although a number of variables predicted a positive
      psychostimulant response, the strength of the predictive associations suggests
      only minimal clinical usefulness.

TI  - Intrathecal, but not intravenous, clonidine reduces experimental thermal or
      capsaicin-induced pain and hyperalgesia in normal volunteers.
PG  - 591-6
AB  - Clonidine is approved for intraspinal administration in the treatment of
      neuropathic cancer pain. Some studies have suggested an analgesic effect after
      systemic clonidine administration. The purpose of this study was to compare the
      analgesic effects of intrathecal and IV clonidine with acute noxious stimulation 
      and with hyperalgesia from intradermal capsaicin injection in volunteers. Sixteen
      healthy volunteers received intradermal injections of capsaicin (100 microg)
      before and after the IV or intrathecal injection of clonidine 50 or 150 microg in
      a randomized, double-blind manner. Pain and areas of mechanical hyperalgesia and 
      allodynia were determined at specified intervals. In addition, pain to noxious
      heat stimulation was determined. The capsaicin injection produced pain, followed 
      by hyperalgesia and allodynia. The intrathecal, but not IV, injection of 150
      microg of clonidine reduced capsaicin-induced pain and area of hyperalgesia.
      Intrathecal clonidine (150 microg) reduced pain to heat stimulation, whereas IV
      clonidine did not. The groups did not differ in hemodynamic or sedative effects
      from clonidine. These data support the value of intraspinal administration of
      clonidine for the treatment of acute pain and of pain states associated with
      hyperalgesia. Similarly, they suggest that analgesia from the systemic
      administration of this alpha2-adrenergic agonist, if any, is weak in doses that
      produce sedation and reduce blood pressure. IMPLICATIONS: To the extent that the 
      experimental pain conditions used in this study reflect those in patients with
      acute and chronic pain, these data support the spinal rather than IV injection of
      clonidine for analgesia.

TI  - Psychotropic medication use and risk of epithelial ovarian cancer.
PG  - 697-702
AB  - Long-term use of psychotropic medication may increase the risk for epithelial
      ovarian cancer through increased gonadotropin secretion or direct ovarian
      stimulation of adrenergic receptors, effects which may affect ovarian cancer
      pathogenesis. An earlier case-control study found that prior use of
      antidepressants or benzodiazepine tranquilizers was associated with a 2-fold
      increase in risk of epithelial ovarian cancer. However, that study lacked details
      on all types of psychotropic medications, length of use, and the categorization
      of the specific action of these medications on the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian
      axis. In a new case-control study conducted in eastern Massachusetts (MA) and all
      of New Hampshire (NH), we identified all women with newly diagnosed ovarian
      cancer between May 1992 and March 1997. We interviewed 563 women diagnosed with
      malignant or borderline epithelial ovarian tumors and 523 controls identified
      through random digit dialing and the use of Town Books (residential listings by
      name, age, and precinct). Participants were asked to provide the name of
      medications used for 6 months or longer, the age at first use, and total months
      or years of use. Psychotropic medications included amphetamines, sedatives,
      barbiturates/anticonvulsants, antidepressants, and antipsychotics. Self-reported 
      use of psychotropic medication for 6 months or longer was associated with a
      statistically significant increase in risk of invasive ovarian cancer [odds ratio
      (OR), 1.6; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1-2.3]. Relative to nonusers, risk was
      greatest in those whose first use occurred premenopausally for more than 2 years 
      (OR, 2.9; CI, 1.3-6.6). The association was largely confined to use of
      medications that operate through dopaminergic mechanisms (OR, 2.9; CI, 1.3-6.4)
      or gabaergic pathways (OR, 1.5; CI, 0.9-2.5) as opposed to serotoninergic
      pathways (OR, 1.0; CI, 0.4-2.1). These results are consistent with the hypothesis
      that psychotropic medications induce gonadotropin secretion, which in turn may
      increase ovarian cancer risk. However, until other studies confirm our findings
      and determine whether they apply to medications with specific neuroendocrine
      actions, it is premature to advise a change in clinical practice and conclude
      that these medications indeed play a role in the etiology of ovarian cancer.

TI  - Revision and restandardization of the Conners Teacher Rating Scale (CTRS-R):
      factor structure, reliability, and criterion validity.
PG  - 279-91
AB  - The Conners Teacher Rating Scale (CTRS) is a commonly used research and clinical 
      tool for assessing children's behavior in the classroom. The present study
      introduces the revised CTRS (CTRS-R) which improves on the original CTRS by (1)
      establishing normative data from a large, representative North American sample,
      (2) deriving a factor structure using advanced statistical techniques, and (3)
      updating the item content to reflect current conceptualizations of childhood
      disorders. Using confirmatory factor analysis, a six-factor structure was found
      which includes Hyperactivity-Impulsivity, Perfectionism, Inattention/Cognitive
      Problems, Social Problems, Oppositionality, and Anxious/Shy factors. The
      reliability of the scale, as measured by test-retest correlations and internal
      consistency, is generally satisfactory. Using all of the scale factors to
      discriminate between attention deficit hyperactivity disordered and normal
      children, 85 percent of children were correctly classified, supporting the
      validity of the scale and indicating excellent clinical utility. Similarities and
      differences between the original CTRS factor structure and the CTRS-R factor
      structure are discussed.

TI  - The revised Conners' Parent Rating Scale (CPRS-R): factor structure, reliability,
      and criterion validity.
PG  - 257-68
AB  - The Conners' Parent Rating Scale (CPRS) is a popular research and clinical tool
      for obtaining parental reports of childhood behavior problems. The present study 
      introduces a revised CPRS (CPRS-R) which has norms derived from a large,
      representative sample of North American children, uses confirmatory factor
      analysis to develop a definitive factor structure, and has an updated item
      content to reflect recent knowledge and developments concerning childhood
      behavior problems. Exploratory and confirmatory factor-analytic results revealed 
      a seven-factor model including the following factors: Cognitive Problems,
      Oppositional, Hyperactivity-Impulsivity, Anxious-Shy, Perfectionism, Social
      Problems, and Psychosomatic. The psychometric properties of the revised scale
      appear adequate as demonstrated by good internal reliability coefficients, high
      test-retest reliability, and effective discriminatory power. Advantages of the
      CPRS-R include a corresponding factor structure with the Conners' Teacher Rating 
      Scale-Revised and comprehensive symptom coverage for attention deficit
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and related disorders. Factor congruence with the
      original CPRS as well as similarities with other parent rating scales are
      discussed.

TI  - Methylphenidate does not modify the impact of response frequency or stimulus
      sequence on performance and event-related potentials of children with attention
      deficit hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - 233-45
AB  - Twenty-six children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
      participated in a double-blind trial consisting of 2 consecutive weeks each of
      placebo and methylphenidate (M = 26.92 mg/day = 0.78 mg/kg/day). As expected,
      stimulant therapy resulted in moderate weight loss, increased somatic complaints,
      and teacher and parent reports of reduced inattentiveness, aggression, and
      oppositionality. In both phases of the trial, patients were tested in a choice
      reaction time task assessing two aspects of the task that presumably affect
      response selection: response frequency (ratio of targets/nontargets = 25/75 vs.
      50/50) and stimulus sequence (alternations vs. repetitions). Both manipulations
      yielded expected results on performance and event-related potentials (ERPs).
      Stimulant treatment increased accuracy and speed among younger children and
      curtailed variability of reaction time for the sample as a whole. However,
      methylphenidate did not affect ERPs. In combination, the results imply that the
      enhancement of performance by methylphenidate does not involve the demands of
      response selection examined in this study.

AB  - Treating schizophrenia is expensive. Preventing rehospitalization of patients
      with schizophrenia provides an attractive opportunity for cost savings,
      especially for patients with 'revolving-door' or multiple-episode schizophrenia. 
      Reducing the occurrence of extrapyramidal symptoms and other adverse events
      associated with standard antipsychotic agents may increase compliance and reduce 
      the rate of rehospitalization of patients with schizophrenia. Quetiapine
      ('Seroquel', ICI 204,636, Zeneca Pharmaceuticals) is a new dibenzothiazepine
      antipsychotic agent with a low propensity for extrapyramidal symptoms. We
      describe here a unique methodology to compare quetiapine with usual-care
      medications in real-world treatment settings. The trial objective is to determine
      if therapy with this new atypical antipsychotic agent can reduce the rate of
      rehospitalization and, therefore, treatment costs. Using two secondary
      medical-claims databases, we defined the minimal threshold for revolving-door
      status as 1.0 admission per year; this definition allows our trial to focus on
      the subpopulation of schizophrenic patients with the greatest potential for cost 
      savings by either the new atypical antipsychotic quetiapine or usual-care
      therapy. We describe here the approach used in our trial.

TI  - An exploratory haloperidol-controlled dose-finding study of ziprasidone in
      hospitalized patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.
PG  - 296-304
AB  - Ninety patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder according to
      DSM-III-R criteria participated in this double-blind, exploratory, dose-ranging
      trial. After a single-blind washout period of 4 to 7 days, patients were randomly
      assigned to receive one of four fixed doses of the new antipsychotic, ziprasidone
      4 (N = 19), 10 (N = 17), 40 (N = 17), or 160 (N = 20) mg/day or haloperidol 15
      mg/day (N = 17) for 4 weeks. A dose-response relationship among ziprasidone
      groups was established for improvements in Clinical Global Impression Severity
      (CGI-S) score (p = 0.002) but not in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) total 
      score (p = 0.08). The intent-to-treat analysis of mean changes from baseline in
      the BPRS total, BPRS Psychosis core, and CGI-S scores demonstrated that
      ziprasidone 160 mg/day was comparable with haloperidol in reducing overall
      psychopathology and positive symptoms and was superior to ziprasidone 4 mg/day.
      Despite the small sample size and short duration of the trial, the improvement in
      CGI-S with both ziprasidone 160 mg/day and haloperidol 15 mg/day was
      statistically significantly greater than with ziprasidone 4 mg/day (p = 0.001
      andp = 0.005, respectively). The percentage of patients classified as responders 
      on both the BPRS total (> or = 30% improvement) and CGI-Improvement (score of 1
      or 2) scales in the ziprasidone 160 mg/day group was similar to that in the
      haloperidol group and nonsignificantly greater than that in the ziprasidone 4
      mg/day group. On all assessments of clinical efficacy, the improvements
      associated with ziprasidone 4 mg/day, 10 mg/day, and 40 mg/day were similar.
      Concomitant benztropine use at any time during the study was less frequent with
      ziprasidone 160 mg/day (15%) than with haloperidol (53%). Haloperidol was
      associated with a sustained hyperprolactinemia, unlike ziprasidone, where only
      transient elevations in prolactin that returned to normal within the dosing
      interval were observed. Ziprasidone was well tolerated, and the incidence of
      adverse events was similar in all groups. The results of this study suggest that 
      ziprasidone 160 mg/day is as effective as haloperidol 15 mg/day in reducing
      overall psychopathology and positive symptoms of an acute exacerbation of
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder but has a lower potential to induce
      extrapyramidal symptoms.

TI  - Response to growth hormone in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: effects
      of methylphenidate and pemoline therapy.
PG  - 497-500
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity
      disorder (ADHD) with methylphenidate hydrochloride or pemoline diminishes the
      response to growth hormone (GH) therapy in patients with idiopathic GH deficiency
      (IGHD) or idiopathic short stature (ISS). METHODS: The National Cooperative
      Growth Study database was used to identify patients between 3 and 20 years of age
      with IGHD or ISS and those within these groups who were treated with
      methylphenidate or pemoline for ADHD. Their growth in response to GH treatment
      (change in height standard deviation score [SDS]) was compared with that of
      patients with IGHD or ISS who were not treated for ADHD, by using a stepwise
      multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: In the IGHD cohort, there were 184
      patients who were being treated for ADHD and 2313 who were not. In the ISS cohort
      there were 117 patients who were being treated for ADHD and 1283 who were not.
      There was a higher percentage of males being treated for ADHD in both cohorts. In
      the IGHD cohort, the change in height SDS was positively associated with the
      number of years of GH treatment, parents' heights, body mass index, and GH
      injection schedule, and was negatively associated with height SDS at the
      initiation of GH therapy, age, and maximum stimulated GH level. The use of
      methylphenidate or pemoline had a negative effect on the change in height SDS,
      but the magnitude of the effect was small. Similar effects were noted in the ISS 
      cohort, but body mass index and the use of methylphenidate or pemoline had no
      effect on the change in height SDS. CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent ADHD therapy is
      associated with a slight decrease in the change in height SDS during GH treatment
      in patients with IGHD but not in those with ISS. Even in IGHD, the magnitude of
      the effect is small and should not deter the use of such concurrent therapy.

TI  - Effects of 0.5% and 0.25% apraclonidine on postoperative intraocular hypertension
      after cataract extraction.
PG  - 67-70
AB  - PURPOSE: We conducted a double-masked, prospective study to evaluate the effect
      of 0.5% and 0.25% apraclonidine on postoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) in
      patients undergoing extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) with intraocular
      lens (IOL) implantation. METHODS: Fifty-four patients scheduled for ECCE were
      randomly divided into three groups of 18. The first group received one drop of
      0.50% apraclonidine topically one hour before surgery and immediately after the
      end of the procedure. The second group received the same regimen but with 0.25%
      apraclonidine. The third group received artificial tears as the control group.
      IOP was measured 12 h preoperatively and 6 and 24 h postoperatively. All the
      measurements were made using the same Goldmann applanation tonometer by the same 
      surgeon who did not know to which group the patient belonged. RESULTS:
      Preoperative mean IOP was 13.66 +/- 2.76 mmHg in the first group, 14.27 +/- 2.24 
      mmHg in the second and 14.5 +/- 1.34 mmHg in the control group. The differences
      were not significant (p = 0.398). Mean IOP at the early postoperative visit (6 h)
      was significantly lower in the first group (17.44 +/- 4.95 mmHg) than the second 
      (21.78 +/- 7.19 mmHg) and the control group (24.55 +/- 5.65 mmHg) (p < 0.001).
      Mean postoperative IOP at 24 h was again significantly lower in the first group
      (14.33 +/- 3.75 mmHg) than the second (17.11 +/- 4.16 mmHg) and the control group
      (19.61 +/- 3.20 mmHg) (p, 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that topical
      0.5% apraclonidine controlled early postoperative intraocular hypertension after 
      cataract extraction without any side effects, while the 0.25% drops were not
      effective.

TI  - A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of risperidone in adults with autistic
      disorder and other pervasive developmental disorders.
PG  - 633-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neurobiological research has implicated the dopamine and serotonin
      systems in the pathogenesis of autism. Open-label reports suggest that the
      serotonin2A-dopamine D2 antagonist risperidone may be safe and effective in
      reducing the interfering symptoms of patients with autism. METHODS: Thirty-one
      adults (age [mean+/-SD], 28.1+/-7.3 years) with autistic disorder (n=17) or
      pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (n=14) participated in a
      12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of risperidone. Patients treated
      with placebo subsequently received a 12-week open-label trial of risperidone.
      RESULTS: For persons completing the study, 8 (57%) of 14 patients treated with
      risperidone were categorized as responders (daily dose [mean+/-SD], 2.9+/-1.4 mg)
      compared with none of 16 in the placebo group (P<.002). Risperidone was superior 
      to placebo in reducing repetitive behavior (P<.001), aggression (P<.001), anxiety
      or nervousness (P<.02), depression (P<.03), irritability (P<.01), and the overall
      behavioral symptoms of autism (P<.02). Objective, measurable change in social
      behavior and language did not occur. Nine (60%) of 15 patients who received
      treatment with open-label risperidone following the double-blind placebo phase
      responded. Other than mild, transient sedation, risperidone was well tolerated,
      with no evidence of extrapyramidal effects, cardiac events, or seizures.
      CONCLUSION: Risperidone is more effective than placebo in the short-term
      treatment of symptoms of autism in adults.

TI  - Methylphenidate treatment for cocaine abusers with adult
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: a pilot study.
PG  - 300-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is common among
      cocaine abusers seeking treatment. This open trial was carried out to assess the 
      efficacy of sustained-release methylphenidate for the treatment of cocaine abuse 
      among individuals with ADHD. METHOD: Twelve patients who met DSM-IV diagnostic
      criteria for adult ADHD and cocaine dependence were entered into a 12-week trial 
      of divided daily doses of sustained-release methylphenidate ranging from 40 to 80
      mg. In addition to the pharmacotherapy, patients also received individual weekly 
      relapse prevention therapy. Individuals were assessed weekly for ADHD symptoms;
      vital signs and urine toxicologies were obtained 3 times a week. RESULTS: Of the 
      12 patients entered, 10 completed at least 8 weeks of the study and 8 completed
      the entire study. Using both a semistructured clinical interview and a
      self-report assessment, patients reported reductions in attention difficulties,
      hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Self-reported cocaine use and craving decreased
      significantly. More importantly, cocaine use, confirmed by urine toxicologies,
      also decreased significantly. CONCLUSION: These preliminary data suggest that
      under close supervision, the combined intervention of sustained-release
      methylphenidate and relapse prevention therapy may be effective in treating
      individuals with both adult ADHD and cocaine dependence.

TI  - Methylphenidate therapy improves cognition, mood, and function of brain tumor
      patients.
PG  - 2522-7
AB  - PURPOSE: Patients with malignant glioma develop progressive neurobehavioral
      deficits over the course of their illness. These are caused both by the effects
      of the disease and the effects of radiation and chemotherapy. We sought to
      determine whether methylphenidate treatment would improve these patients'
      neurobehavioral functioning despite their expected neurologic deterioration.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty patients with primary brain tumors underwent
      neuropsychologic assessment before and during treatment with methylphenidate.
      Ability to function in activities of daily living and magnetic resonance imaging 
      (MRI) findings were also documented. Patients were assessed on 10, 20, and 30 mg 
      of methylphenidate twice daily. RESULTS: Significant improvements in cognitive
      function were observed on the 10-mg twice-daily dose. Functional improvements
      included improved gait, increased stamina and motivation to perform activities,
      and in one case, increased bladder control. Adverse effects were minimal and
      immediately resolved when treatment was discontinued. There was no increase in
      seizure frequency and the majority of patients on glucocorticoid therapy were
      able to decrease their dose. Gains in cognitive function and ability to perform
      activities were observed in the setting of progressive neurologic injury
      documented by MRI in half of the subjects. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated
      improved patient function in the setting of a progressive neurologic illness.
      Methylphenidate should be more widely considered as adjuvant brain tumor therapy.

TI  - Effect of oral clonidine premedication on hemodynamic response during sedated
      nasal fiberoptic intubation.
PG  - 47-52
AB  - Although oral clonidine premedication is known to reduce the hemodynamic response
      under general anesthesia, effects of the hemodynamic response during sedated
      fiberoptic nasal intubation have not yet been examined. Our aim was to compare
      the effects of clonidine premedication on hemodynamic responses with those of
      atropine and hydroxyzine premedication during sedated fiberoptic nasal
      intubation. Thirty adult patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups:
      Group 1 patients (n = 15) were premedicated with atropine sulfate (0.01 mg/kg)
      and hydroxyzine hydrochloride (1mg/kg) intramuscularly, and group 2 patients (n =
      15) were premedicated with clonidine (5 micrograms/kg) orally. We compared the
      hemodynamic response and sedation level in fiberoptic nasal intubation between
      the two groups. there were no significant differences in sedation levels and
      postoperative complaints between the two groups. But the oral clonidine
      premedication (Group 2) blunted hemodynamic changes during the fiberoptic
      intubation. No profound hypotension or marked bradycardia was noted in group 2.
      We concluded that the oral clonidine premedication might contribute to
      hemodynamic stability during sedated fiberoptic nasal intubation.

TI  - A multicenter evaluation of the efficacy and safety of 150 and 300 mg/d
      sustained-release bupropion tablets versus placebo in depressed outpatients.
PG  - 505-16
AB  - This multicenter, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-group
      study compared the antidepressant efficacy and safety of bupropion
      sustained-release (SR) tablets (150 mg QD or 150 mg BID) with placebo in
      outpatients with moderate-to-severe depression. The study consisted of a 1-week
      placebo phase followed by 8 weeks of active treatment with bupropion SR 150 mg/d 
      (150 mg QD, n = 121) or 300 mg/d (150 mg BID, n = 120) or placebo (n = 121).
      Efficacy was measured by changes in scores on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale
      for Depression (HAM-D) and the Clinical Global Impressions for Severity of
      Illness (CGI-S) and Clinical Global Impressions for Improvement of Illness
      (CGI-I) scales. Safety was monitored by regular assessment of vital signs and
      adverse events as well as by pretreatment and posttreatment physical and clinical
      laboratory examinations. By day 56, both bupropion SR treatments were more
      effective in relieving the symptoms of depression than was placebo. Compared with
      those receiving placebo, patients in the bupropion SR 150- and 300-mg/d groups
      had significantly reduced symptoms by treatment day 56, as measured on the
      17-item HAM-D, CGI-S, and CGI-I scales (P < 0.05). Bupropion SR was well
      tolerated, with no serious adverse events reported by bupropion-treated patients;
      95% of all reported adverse events were of mild or moderate intensity. No
      clinically significant changes in vital signs, laboratory test results, or
      physical findings were observed. A greater mean weight loss was observed at the
      end of treatment in both the bupropion SR 150-mg (0.5 kg) and bupropion SR 300-mg
      (1.0 kg) group compared with placebo (0.2 kg). We found that bupropion SR 150 mg 
      administered either once or twice daily was more effective than placebo in
      treating depression and that once-daily dosing appears to be at least as
      effective as twice-daily dosing. Should this prove true, depressed patients may
      be able to benefit from the convenience and improved tolerability associated with
      once-daily dosing.

TI  - Clonidine does not impair redistribution hypothermia after the induction of
      anesthesia.
PG  - 168-72
AB  - Clonidine is commonly given for premedication, and it impairs normal
      thermoregulatory responses to warm and cold stimuli while depressing sympathetic 
      tone. We studied the effect of premedication by clonidine on redistribution
      hypothermia induced by the induction of anesthesia. Sixteen ASA physical status I
      or II patients were randomly assigned to receive either clonidine 150 micrograms 
      or a placebo. Anesthesia was induced 45 min later by thiopental, fentanyl, and
      vecuronium i.v. and was maintained by the administration of 0.6% isoflurane. We
      monitored central core (tympanic) temperature and skin surface temperatures at
      the forearm and the fingertip during the 2 h after the induction of anesthesia
      before surgery. We estimated skin blood flow at the level of the forearm by using
      laser Doppler during the same period. The core temperature decreased comparably
      in the two groups of patients, from 37.1 +/- 0.2 degrees C to 35.3 +/- 0.4
      degrees C and from 37.1 +/- 0.2 degrees C to 35.5 +/- 0.3 degrees C in the
      clonidine and placebo groups, respectively. The forearm-fingertip surface
      temperature gradient decreased similarly in the two groups. There was no evidence
      of cutaneous vasoconstriction. The laser Doppler index at the fingertip increased
      similarly in the two groups, as did the forearm-fingertip temperature gradient.
      We conclude that premedication with clonidine does not significantly impair the
      profile of central hypothermia induced by heat redistribution after the induction
      of anesthesia. IMPLICATIONS: The induction of general anesthesia is associated
      with redistribution hypothermia. This study shows that premedication with oral
      clonidine does not worsen the decrease in core temperature resulting from general
      anesthesia.

TI  - The effect of clonidine or midazolam premedication on perioperative responses
      during ketamine anesthesia.
PG  - 161-7
AB  - The use of ketamine as a sole anesthetic induces marked central sympathetic
      stimulation, causing increased heart rate, blood pressure (BP), and oxygen
      consumption (VO2). Both alpha 2-agonists and benzodiazepines have been used to
      attenuate these potentially harmful ketamine-induced responses. This
      double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was designed to compare the
      perioperative metabolic, hemodynamic, and sympathoadrenal responses to IM
      clonidine (2 micrograms/kg) and midazolam (70 micrograms/kg) premedication during
      ketamine anesthesia. VO2 was measured continuously using indirect calorimetry in 
      30 ASA physical status I patients. The patients received ketamine, mivacurium,
      and fentanyl for the induction of anesthesia. Anesthesia was maintained using a
      ketamine infusion and fentanyl boluses i.v. Preoperatively, both VO2 and BP
      decreased significantly after the administration clonidine and midazolam compared
      with placebo (P < 0.01). Intraoperatively, VO2 was higher in the midazolam group 
      than in the placebo and clonidine groups (P < 0.05). Postoperatively, there were 
      no significant differences in BP and VO2, although they stayed at lower level in 
      the clonidine group during the whole postoperative period. Clonidine decreased
      pre- and postoperative plasma catecholamine concentrations (P < 0.05). Our
      results indicate that a midazolam-ketamine combination may induce potentially
      harmful metabolic stimulation, whereas the sympatholytic effects of clonidine on 
      ketamine-anesthetized patients may be beneficial, as perioperative VO2 was
      decreased. IMPLICATIONS: Ketamine causes sympathetic stimulation with an ensuing 
      increase in oxygen consumption. Anticipating that clonidine might attenuate this 
      response, we measured oxygen consumption in patients undergoing surgery during
      ketamine anesthesia. Patients treated with a clonidine-ketamine combination had
      lower intra- and postoperative oxygen consumption than those treated with a
      midazolam-ketamine combination.

TI  - Clonidine added to the anesthetic solution enhances analgesia and improves
      oxygenation after intercostal nerve block for thoracotomy.
PG  - 107-11
AB  - We evaluated the effect of adding clonidine to bupivacaine on postoperative pain 
      control and oxygenation after intercostal nerve blockade (ICB) for thoracotomy,
      and attempted to distinguish a systemic from a local effect of clonidine. ICB
      with 2 mg/kg 0.5% bupivacaine was performed in 36 patients undergoing
      thoracotomy. Patients were randomized to one of three groups: 1) a control group 
      that received bupivacaine with saline for ICB and an IM injection of saline, 2)
      an IM group that received bupivacaine with saline for ICB and an IM injection of 
      2 micrograms/kg clonidine, and 3) a block group that received bupivacaine with 2 
      micrograms/kg clonidine for ICB and an IM injection of saline. Blood gases,
      visual analog scale (VAS) scores, and analgesic demand were determined hourly for
      8 h after arrival in the postoperative care unit (PCU). Patients in the block
      group had significantly lower VAS scores, higher arterial oxygen tension, and
      lower analgesic demand for the first 4 h in the PCU, compared with the two other 
      groups. No difference was noted thereafter. We conclude that the addition of
      clonidine to bupivacaine for ICB leads to a short-term effect enhancing
      postoperative pain control and improving arterial oxygenation, probably mediated 
      by a direct effect on the nerves. Implications: Severe pain after thoracotomy can
      lead to impaired ventilation. We studied the effect of adding clonidine to
      bupivacaine for intercostal nerve blockade after thoracotomy. Clonidine
      administered directly on the nerves enhanced analgesia and improved oxygenation
      for a short time compared with systemic administration or control.

TI  - Olanzapine compared with chlorpromazine in treatment-resistant schizophrenia.
PG  - 914-20
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of olanzapine
      with that of chlorpromazine plus benztropine in patients with treatment-resistant
      schizophrenia. METHOD: One hundred three previously treatment-resistant patients 
      with schizophrenia diagnosed according to the DSM-III-R criteria were given a
      prospective 6-week trial of 10-40 mg/day of haloperidol. Eighty-four of them
      failed to respond to that trial and agreed to be randomly assigned to an 8-week
      fixed-dose trial of either 25 mg/day of olanzapine alone or 1200 mg/day of
      chlorpromazine plus 4 mg/day of benztropine mesylate. RESULTS: Fifty-nine (70%)
      of the 84 subjects completed the trial. The primary outcome measures were Brief
      Psychiatric Rating Scale total score and positive symptom score, Scale for the
      Assessment of Negative Symptoms global score, and Clinical Global Impression
      score. An analysis of variance for the subjects who completed the study showed no
      difference in efficacy between the two drugs. Seven percent of the
      olanzapine-treated patients responded according to a priori criteria; no
      chlorpromazine-treated patients responded. The olanzapine-treated patients had
      fewer motor and cardiovascular side effects than the chlorpromazine-treated
      patients. Extrapyramidal symptoms and akathisia were similar in the two groups,
      although no antiparkinsonian drugs were used in the olanzapine group.
      CONCLUSIONS: Olanzapine and chlorpromazine showed similar efficacy, and the total
      amount of improvement with either drug was modest. Olanzapine-treated patients
      had fewer side effects than chlorpromazine-treated patients.

TI  - Psychomotor slowing, negative symptoms and dopamine receptor availability--an
      IBZM SPECT study in neuroleptic-treated and drug-free schizophrenic patients.
PG  - 19-26
AB  - Anhedonia and psychomotor slowing in schizophrenia have been attributed to a
      dysfunction of dopaminergic neurotransmission. To differentiate between disease
      and drug-induced negative symptoms, we examined eight drug-free and eight
      neuroleptic-treated schizophrenic patients. Positive and negative symptoms and
      extrapyramidal side effects were assessed using standardized rating scales (PSAS,
      AMDP, SANS). 'Reaction time' and 'motor speed' were measured using a
      computer-aided system and striatal dopamine D2/D3 receptor availability was
      assessed using [I-123]IBZM SPECT. Psychomotor reaction time, parkinsonism,
      affective flattening and avolition were increased in treated patients relative to
      the untreated cohort and were negatively correlated with dopamine D2/D3 receptor 
      availability. Significant positive correlations were found between parkinsonism
      and affective flattening and between psychomotor slowing and avolition. Positive 
      symptoms were not significantly associated with striatal IBZM binding. These
      findings support the hypothesis that neuroleptic-induced dopamine D2/D3 blockade 
      in the striatum can mimic certain negative symptoms, such as affective flattening
      and avolition, and indicates that psychomotor testing may be helpful in
      differentiating between disease and drug-induced negative symptoms.

TI  - A comparison of bd and tid dose regimens of quetiapine (Seroquel) in the
      treatment of schizophrenia.
PG  - 139-46
AB  - Quetiapine (Seroquel, ICI 204,636) is an atypical antipsychotic that is effective
      in the treatment of both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, and has
      a low propensity to cause extrapyramidal symptoms. The compound has a relatively 
      short plasma elimination half-life (approximately 7 h). However, since dopamine
      D2 receptor occupancies correlate poorly with plasma concentrations of
      antipsychotics, plasma elimination half-life may not predict either duration of
      clinical effect or dosing frequency. Accordingly, the efficacy and tolerability
      of three dosing regimens (450 mg/day given in two or three divided doses daily,
      and 50 mg/day given twice daily) were compared in a 6-week, double-blind,
      randomized, multicentre, parallel-group study. The study recruited hospitalized
      men and women aged 18-65 years meeting DSM-IIIR criteria for acute exacerbation
      of chronic or subchronic schizophrenia. Six hundred and eighteen patients were
      randomly assigned to treatment with quetiapine 150 mg tid (n = 209), 225 mg bd (n
      = 200), or a comparator dose of 25 mg bd (n = 209). At day 42, the last day of
      randomized treatment and the primary timepoint for efficacy, quetiapine 450
      mg/day was more effective than 50 mg/day: 225 mg bd was consistently superior to 
      25 mg bd in all measures of efficacy (total BPRS, P = 0.006; CGI severity, CGI
      improvement and SANS, P < 0.03), and 150 mg tid was statistically significantly
      superior to 25 mg bd with respect to BPRS total score (P = 0.05). The 225 mg bd
      and 150 mg tid groups were not significantly different from each other with
      respect to any efficacy measure. Quetiapine was generally well tolerated.
      Extrapyramidal symptom (EPS) adverse events were generally rare, and occurred
      with similar frequencies in the two 450 mg/day groups. Quetiapine was not
      associated with sustained increases in plasma prolactin at any dose. These data
      support the atypical profile developed from preclinical studies and show that
      quetiapine is an effective, well tolerated antipsychotic that can be given twice 
      daily.

AB  - Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurological disorder which 
      is common in the childhood and can be caused by exogenous and endogenous factors,
      that are responsible for cerebral disorder. This disorder presents a functional
      alteration of the motor, perceptive, cognition systems and conduct disorders
      compromising the learning of children with an adequate intellectual potential.
      The authors study the action of stimulants and antidepressive drugs in the ADHD, 
      using as measure of efficacy the motor persistence tests.

TI  - Recovery in pediatric brain injury: is psychostimulant medication beneficial?
PG  - 73-81
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of methylphenidate on attention, memory,
      behavior, processing speed, and psychomotor skills of children with closed head
      injuries. DESIGN: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. SETTING: An
      outpatient facility of a children's hospital medical center. PATIENTS: Ten
      pediatric subjects identified through chart review. Subjects met baseline scores 
      for hyperactivity (Conner's Hyperactivity Index greater than or equal to 60) and 
      intellectual functioning (Verbal Intelligence Quotient greather than or equal to 
      70) and achieved minimal scores on two psychometric tests. All subjects evidenced
      head injury by focal lesions on computed tomography scan and/or sequelae reported
      at the time of injury. Severity of injury ranged from mild to severe. All
      subjects were medically stable at the time of testing. Mean time post injury was 
      2 years, 8 months. INTERVENTION: Administration of methylphenidate and placebo.
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Percentage change in scores was calculated to assess
      differences between baseline and end of methylphenidate/placebo trials. RESULTS: 
      No significant differences between methylphenidate and placebo on measures
      assessing behavior, attention, memory, and processing speed. CONCLUSIONS: The
      results of the study call into question the effectiveness of methylphenidate in
      the pediatric head injury population.

TI  - Clonidine does not potentiate the antipsychotic effects of neuroleptics in
      chronically ill patients.
PG  - 3-7
AB  - Clonidine is a centrally acting antihypertensive and has been prescribed widely
      for more than 20 years. Because it decreases central norepinephrine activity,
      clonidine has been investigated as an antipsychotic. In most of the preliminary
      studies, clonidine was tested as the sole antipsychotic agent. We performed a
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study to compare a placebo plus a
      neuroleptic to clonidine plus a neuroleptic in a group of 16 chronically
      psychotic patients. Of these 16, 3 dropped out secondary to side effects of the
      clonidine and 1 withdrew from the study. The clonidine dosage varied from 0.2 to 
      0.6 mg per day. The concurrent neuroleptic (one of the following: haloperidol,
      thiothixene, thioridazine, mesoridazine, or fluphenazine) averaged 34 mg per day 
      of haloperidol equivalents. Symptoms were monitored using the Psychiatric
      Symptoms Assessment Scale. The data provided evidence that a
      clonidine/neuroleptic combination was not more effective than a neuroleptic alone
      in this group of patients. These data suggest that the central antinorepinephrine
      activity of a neuroleptic is not potentiated further by clonidine.

TI  - A double-blind, controlled comparison of the novel antipsychotic olanzapine
      versus haloperidol or placebo on anxious and depressive symptoms accompanying
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 803-10
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depressive symptoms are a common feature of schizophrenia and may
      represent a core part of the illness. Where present, it has been associated with 
      greater overall morbidity and mortality. Monotherapy with conventional dopamine
      antagonists may either worsen or bestow a limited therapeutic benefit.
      Accordingly the use of adjunctive thymoleptics has been explored. In contrast,
      olanzapine (OLZ), an atypical antipsychotic agent, offers a distinctive and
      pleotropic pharmacology suggestive of a broader efficacy profile than
      conventional neuroleptic agents. METHODS: In a 6-week placebo- and haloperidol
      (HAL)-controlled trial with 335 randomized subjects with chronic schizophrenia in
      an acute exacerbation, three fixed dose ranges of OLZ (5, 10, or 15 +/- 2.5 mg)
      were evaluated versus HAL (10-20 mg) or placebo. RESULTS: Baseline to endpoint
      change in the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale including the anxiety-depression
      cluster (items 1, 2, 5, 9) was analyzed. Two dose ranges of OLZ (10 +/- 2.5, 15
      +/- 2.5) were superior to placebo (p < 05) in improving mood status, whereas HAL 
      was not. CONCLUSION: Contributions from a more selective mesolimbic dopaminergic 
      profile, D1 or D4 activity, the release of dopamine/norepinephrine in the
      prefrontal cortex, and/or serotonin 5-HT2A,C antagonism may explain the
      differential benefit seen with OLZ in the treatment of comorbid anxious and
      depressive symptoms in schizophrenia.

TI  - Olanzapine in treatment-resistant bipolar disorder.
PG  - 119-22
AB  - BACKGROUND: We evaluated the response to olanzapine in 14 consecutive patients
      with bipolar I disorder who were inadequately responsive to standard psychotropic
      agents. METHODS: Fourteen patients with bipolar I disorder by DSM-IV criteria
      experiencing persistent affective symptoms inadequately responsive to at least
      one standard mood stabilizer were treated with open-label olanzapine by one of
      the authors. Response was assessed with the Clinical Global Impression Scale
      modified for use in bipolar disorder (CGI-BP). RESULTS: The 14 patients received 
      olanzapine at a mean (SD dosage of 14.1+/-7.2 (range 5-30) mg/day for a mean+/-SD
      of 101.4+/-56.3 (range 30-217) days of treatment. Of the 14 patients, 8 (57%)
      displayed much or very much overall improvement in their illness. In general,
      olanzapine was well tolerated. The most common side effects were sedation,
      tremor, dry mouth, and appetite stimulation with weight gain. LIMITATIONS: Data
      were obtained nonblindly and without a randomized control group, and olanzapine
      was added to ongoing psychotropic regimens. CONCLUSION: Olanzapine may have
      antimanic and mood-stabilizing effects in some patients with bipolar disorder,
      and is generally well tolerated. Controlled studies of olanzapine in bipolar
      disorder appear warranted.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors assessed the experimental noradrenergic compound
      tomoxetine as an alternative treatment for adult attention deficit hyperactivity 
      disorder (ADHD). METHOD: They conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      crossover study of tomoxetine in 22 adults with well-characterized ADHD. RESULTS:
      Treatment with tomoxetine at an average oral dose of 76 mg/day was well
      tolerated. Drug-specific improvement in ADHD symptom was highly significant
      overall and sufficiently robust to be detectable in a parallel-groups comparison 
      restricted to the first 3 weeks of the protocol. Eleven of 21 patients showed
      improvement after receiving tomoxetine, compared with only two of 21 patients who
      improved after receiving placebo. Significant tomoxetine-associated improvement
      was noted on neuropsychological measures of inhibitory capacity from Stroop
      tests. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study showed that tomoxetine was effective
      in treating adult ADHD and was well tolerated. These promising results provide
      support for further studies of tomoxetine over an extended period of treatment.

AB  - In a randomized double-blind crossover study of children with attention deficit
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the time course effects of four doses of Adderall 
      (5, 10, 15, and 20 mg) and an inactive (placebo) control, and an active (Ritalin)
      control were evaluated. A laboratory classroom setting was established in which
      subjective (teacher ratings of deportment and attention) and objective (scores on
      math tests) measurements were taken every 1.5 hours across the day. In addition
      to significant time and dose effects of Adderall, significant time-of-day effects
      were documented in the placebo condition for the subjective measure of deportment
      and objective measures of performance. Regression analyses were used to estimate 
      the magnitude of these baseline effects. Correlations across time were used to
      evaluate the test-retest reliability of each measure in the face of these
      time-dependent placebo effects. After placebo/time adjustments, within-subject
      correlations between pairs of measures were used to evaluate the validity of the 
      math test as a measure of response to stimulant medication.

AB  - In children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the effects of 
      methylphenidate were investigated in a pharmacodynamic comparison of placebo and 
      the standard b.i.d. administration of methylphenidate. In each of these
      conditions, teachers completed ratings in classroom settings at times chosen to
      coincide with expected "peaks" and "troughs" of serum concentrations in the
      b.i.d. condition. Analyses of variance (ANOVAs) revealed the expected differences
      between the two conditions in the laboratory classroom setting using standard
      rating scales (Conners and the IOWA Conners) and a new rating scale (the SKAMP), 
      which specifically measures the classroom manifestation of ADHD. The psychometric
      properties of the SKAMP were evaluated by calculating test-retest reliability and
      by calculating correlations with the standard rating scales to establish
      concurrent validity.

AB  - Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) undergoing cardioversion are at an
      increased risk of cardioembolic stroke and require anticoagulation. The
      Assessment of Cardioversion Using Transesophageal Echocardiography (ACUTE)
      Multicenter Study is a randomized clinical trial of patients undergoing
      electrical cardioversion of AF of >2 days' duration comparing a
      transesophageal-guided strategy (TEE) with brief anticoagulation to the
      conventional anticoagulation strategy. Patients randomly assigned to the
      TEE-guided strategy receive therapeutic anticoagulation before TEE and
      cardioversion, followed by 4 weeks of anticoagulation. Patients with thrombus
      imaged by TEE have postponement of cardioversion, continue anticoagulation for 3 
      weeks, and undergo a repeat TEE. Conventional strategy patients receive 3 weeks
      of anticoagulation before cardioversion, followed by 4 weeks of anticoagulation
      after cardioversion. The primary end point events are ischemic stroke, transient 
      ischemic attack, and systemic embolization for an 8-week period from enrollment. 
      Secondary end points are major and minor bleeding, all-cause mortality,
      successful return to and maintenance of sinus rhythm, and cost effectiveness.
      Analysis is based on the intention-to-treat principle. The anticipated rates of
      embolism of 2.9% for conventional strategy and 1.2% for the TEE-guided strategy
      are based on published research and the completed pilot study. The ACUTE
      Multicenter Study will randomize therapy and follow an estimated 3,000 patients
      from 65 study sites to determine the relative efficacy of the TEE-guided and
      conventional approaches to electrical cardioversion for patients in AF. The
      results of this investigation will have important clinical implications for the
      management of patients with AF undergoing electrical cardioversion.

TI  - Risperidone versus haloperidol and amitriptyline in the treatment of patients
      with a combined psychotic and depressive syndrome.
PG  - 111-20
AB  - In a multicenter, double-blind, parallel group trial, the efficacy of risperidone
      (RIS) was compared with a combination of haloperidol and amitriptyline (HAL/AMI) 
      over 6 weeks in patients with coexisting psychotic and depressive symptoms with
      either a schizoaffective disorder, depressive type, a major depression with
      psychotic features, or a nonresidual schizophrenia with major depressive symptoms
      according to DSM-III-R criteria. A total of 123 patients (62 RIS; 61 HAL/AMI)
      were included; the mean daily dosage at endpoint was 6.9 mg RIS versus 9 mg HAL
      combined with 180 mg AMI. Efficacy results for those 98 patients (47 RIS; 51
      HAL/AMI) who completed at least 3 weeks of double-blind treatment revealed in
      both treatment groups large reductions in the Positive and Negative Syndrome
      Scale-derived Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (RIS 37%; HAL/AMI 51%) and the
      Bech-Rafaelsen Melancholia Scale total scores (RIS 51%; HAL/AMI 70%). The
      reductions in the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and the Bech-Rafaelsen
      Melancholia Scale scores in the total group were significantly larger in the
      HAL/AMI group than in the RIS group (p < 0.01), mostly because of significant
      differences in the subgroup of patients suffering from depression with psychotic 
      features, whereas treatment differences in the other diagnostic subgroups were
      not significant. The incidence of extrapyramidal side effects as assessed by the 
      Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale was slightly higher under RIS (37%) than
      under HAL/AMI (31%). Adverse events were reported by 66% of RIS and 75% of
      HAL/AMI patients. The results of this trial suggest that the therapeutic effect
      of HAL/AMI is superior to RIS in the total group of patients with combined
      psychotic and depressive symptoms. However, subgroup differences have to be
      considered.

TI  - Therapeutic equivalence of risperidone given once daily and twice daily in
      patients with schizophrenia. The Risperidone Study Group.
PG  - 103-10
AB  - A study was conducted to determine whether once-daily administration of
      risperidone was as effective and safe as twice-daily administration. In a
      double-blind 6-week trial, 211 patients with acute exacerbation according to
      DSM-III-R criteria were randomly assigned to receive risperidone at 8 mg once
      daily or 4 mg twice daily. The primary efficacy measure was the treatment
      response rate, defined as a 20% or greater reduction in total Positive and
      Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores. Severity of extrapyramidal symptoms was
      assessed by the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale. The percentage of patients
      who showed a treatment response at endpoint was not significantly different
      between groups (76%, once-daily; 72%, twice-daily), nor was the median time to
      first treatment response (14 days, both groups). Significant reductions in PANSS 
      total and subscale scores and PANSS-derived Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale were
      observed in both groups, with no significant between-group differences.
      Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale scores did not differ significantly between
      groups. There were no clinically relevant changes in vital signs,
      electrocardiograms, or clinical laboratory test results in either group. Gradual 
      dosage titration over the first 3 days of treatment was well-tolerated in both
      groups. The median trough plasma concentrations of risperidone,
      9-hydroxyrisperidone, and risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone were
      significantly lower with once-daily than with twice-daily administration; median 
      plasma concentrations measured within the first 8 hours after administration
      tended to be higher with once-daily administration. These differences did not
      affect the safety and efficacy of risperidone. Risperidone given once daily at 8 
      mg is as effective as twice-daily administration of 4 mg in the treatment of
      acute exacerbations of schizophrenia. Both regimens were equally well-tolerated.

TI  - Single-dose pharmacokinetics of modafinil and methylphenidate given alone or in
      combination in healthy male volunteers.
PG  - 276-82
AB  - Modafinil is a novel wake-promoting agent being developed for treatment of
      excessive daytime sleepiness associated with narcolepsy. An open, 3 x 3 Latin
      square, randomized, cross-over study was performed in healthy males to compare
      the pharmacokinetics of single-dose oral modafinil (200 mg) and methylphenidate
      (40 mg) administered alone or in combination. Blood samples were obtained for
      analysis of d- and l-threo-methylphenidate and modafinil and its acid and sulfone
      metabolites. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined by noncompartmental
      methods, but could not be evaluated for modafinil sulfone due to plasma levels
      that were close to the assay quantitation limit. Although sporadic differences in
      plasma concentrations were observed between treatments, coadministration of
      modafinil and methylphenidate did not significantly alter the plasma
      concentrations of modafinil, modafinil acid, modafinil sulfone, or
      methylphenidate enantiomers compared with administration of these agents alone.
      Half-life (t1/2), maximum concentration (Cmax), area under the concentration-time
      curve (AUC0-infinity), total clearance (Cl/F), and apparent volume of
      distribution (Vd/F) for modafinil and t1/2, Cmax, and AUC0-infinity for modafinil
      acid were not affected by concomitant administration of methylphenidate. Small
      but statistically significant increases in time to Cmax (tmax) were observed for 
      modafinil and modafinil acid after methylphenidate coadministration compared with
      modafinil alone. Modafinil coadministration did not significantly alter the
      pharmacokinetics of d- or l-threo-methylphenidate, except for a small decrease in
      Vd/F of l-threo-methylphenidate. Concomitant methylphenidate may cause a delay in
      the oral absorption of modafinil, but this delay might not be relevant
      clinically. Coadministration did not alter the extent of oral absorption and
      disposition of either agent. Therefore, a pharmacokinetic interaction between
      modafinil and methylphenidate would be unlikely.

TI  - Diagnosis and treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children
      and adolescents. Council on Scientific Affairs, American Medical Association.
PG  - 1100-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To deal with public and professional concern regarding possible
      overprescription of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medications, 
      particularly methylphenidate, by reviewing issues related to the diagnosis,
      optimal treatment, and actual care of ADHD patients and of evidence of patient
      misuse of ADHD medications. DATA SOURCES: Literature review using a National
      Library of Medicine database search for 1975 through March 1997 on the terms
      attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity, methylphenidate, stimulants, and
      stimulant abuse and dependence. Relevant documents from the Drug Enforcement
      Administration were also reviewed. STUDY SELECTION: All English-language studies 
      dealing with children of elementary school through high school age were included.
      DATA EXTRACTION: All searched articles were selected and were made available to
      coauthors for review. Additional articles known to coauthors were added to the
      initial list, and a consensus was developed among the coauthors regarding the
      articles most pertinent to the issues requested in the resolution calling for
      this report. Relevant information from these articles was included in the report.
      DATA SYNTHESIS: Diagnostic criteria for ADHD are based on extensive empirical
      research and, if applied appropriately, lead to the diagnosis of a syndrome with 
      high interrater reliability, good face validity, and high predictability of
      course and medication responsiveness. The criteria of what constitutes ADHD in
      children have broadened, and there is a growing appreciation of the persistence
      of ADHD into adolescence and adulthood. As a result, more children (especially
      girls), adolescents, and adults are being diagnosed and treated with stimulant
      medication, and children are being treated for longer periods of time.
      Epidemiologic studies using standardized diagnostic criteria suggest that 3% to
      6% of the school-aged population (elementary through high school) may suffer from
      ADHD, although the percentage of US youth being treated for ADHD is at most at
      the lower end of this prevalence range. Pharmacotherapy, particularly use of
      stimulants, has been extensively studied and generally provides significant
      short-term symptomatic and academic improvement. There is little evidence that
      stimulant abuse or diversion is currently a major problem, particularly among
      those with ADHD, although recent trends suggest that this could increase with the
      expanding production and use of stimulants. CONCLUSIONS: Although some children
      are being diagnosed as having ADHD with insufficient evaluation and in some cases
      stimulant medication is prescribed when treatment alternatives exist, there is
      little evidence of widespread overdiagnosis or misdiagnosis of ADHD or of
      widespread overprescription of methylphenidate by physicians.

      randomized double-blind study. The Risperidone Study Group.
PG  - 499-504
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the short-term efficacy and
      safety of risperidone and clozapine in treatment-resistant chronic schizophrenic 
      patients. METHOD: In a controlled double-blind, multicenter study, 86 inpatients 
      with chronic schizophrenia (DSM-III-R), who were resistant to or intolerant of
      conventional neuroleptics, were randomly assigned to receive risperidone or
      clozapine for 8 weeks after a 7-day washout period. After a 1-week dose-titration
      phase, doses were fixed at 6 mg/day of risperidone and 300 mg/day of clozapine
      for 1 week and then adjusted according to each patient's response. The final mean
      doses were 6.4 mg/day of risperidone and 291.2 mg/day of clozapine. Treatment
      efficacy and safety were evaluated with several well-known rating scales.
      RESULTS: Both risperidone and clozapine significantly reduced the severity of
      psychotic symptoms (scores on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and the
      Clinical Global Impression scale) from baseline, with no significant
      between-group differences. At endpoint, 67% of the risperidone group and 65% of
      the clozapine group were clinically improved (reduction of 20% or more in total
      Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale score). Risperidone appeared to have a
      faster onset of action. In both groups extrapyramidal symptoms and other adverse 
      events were few, and their severity was generally mild. Neither group showed
      evidence of a relation between drug plasma concentrations and clinical
      effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Risperidone was well tolerated and as effective as
      medium doses of clozapine in patients with chronic schizophrenia who had been
      resistant to or intolerant of conventional neuroleptics.

TI  - Intrathecal clonidine combined with sufentanil for labor analgesia.
PG  - 651-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intrathecal sufentanil provides rapid-onset and complete analgesia
      for the first stage of labor. The dose required to produce this effect can be
      associated with maternal respiratory depression, hypotension, nausea, or
      pruritus. Because clonidine potentiates the analgesic effects of opioids without 
      increasing their side effects, the authors wanted to determine the efficacy of
      low doses of intrathecal clonidine (15 and 30 microg) combined with sufentanil.
      METHODS: Ninety-eight parturient requesting labor analgesia were studied. In a
      combined spinal-epidural technique, patients were randomly assigned to receive
      one of the following intrathecal solutions: either 15 microg clonidine (n = 10); 
      30 microg clonidine (n = 10); 2.5 microg sufentanil (n = 13); 5 microg sufentanil
      (n = 13); 2.5 microg sufentanil and 15 microg clonidine (n = 13); 2.5 microg
      sufentanil and 30 microg clonidine (n = 13); 5 microg sufentanil and 15 microg
      clonidine (n = 13); or 5 microg sufentanil and 30 microg clonidine (n = 13).
      Visual analog scores for pain, blood pressure, heart rate, sensory levels,
      incidence of nausea and pruritus, and motor blockade, and maternal and cord blood
      concentrations of clonidine were recorded. RESULTS: Patients receiving 30 microg 
      intrathecal clonidine with 2.5 or 5 microg intrathecal sufentanil had
      significantly longer-lasting analgesia (145 +/- 36 and 145 +/- 43 min vs. 104 +/-
      35 for those receiving 5 microg intrathecal sufentanil alone). Clonidine levels
      were undetectable in maternal serum. CONCLUSIONS: Thirty micrograms of
      intrathecal clonidine combined with 2.5 or 5 microg intrathecal sufentanil
      significantly increased the duration of analgesia during the first stage of labor
      without adverse maternal or fetal effects.

TI  - Neuroendocrine effects of different estradiol-progestin regimens in
      postmenopausal women.
PG  - 127-35
AB  - OBJECTIVE: New regimens and routes of administration of hormonal replacement
      therapy (HRT) in climateric women are becoming available. Since there is no
      information on the neuroendocrine effects of sequential combined treatment with
      17 beta-estradiol and a progestin, the present study evaluated the
      neuroendocrine, clinical vasomotor and psychological changes before and after
      different sequential combined HRT regimens (17 beta-estradiol plus nomegestrol
      acetate, or cyproterone acetate, or vaginal progesterone). Vasomotor and
      behavioral effects were evaluated by using the Kupperman score, while changes in 
      plasma endorphin (beta-END) levels were used as marker of neuroendocrine effects.
      METHODS: Postmenopausal women (n = 30) were randomly divided into three groups
      (ten women for each group); all women received continuous 17 beta-estradiol (50
      mg, transdermal) and each group was sequentially treated with different
      progestins for 12 days/month: group A, cyproterone acetate (5 mg p.o.); group B, 
      nomegestrol acetate (5 mg p.o.); and group C, progesterone (100 mg, vaginal
      cream). A group of healthy fertile women (n = 8) served as control. Before and
      after 6 months of HRT, postmenopausal women underwent an evaluation of subjective
      Kupperman score and two neuroendocrine tests: (a) naloxone (4 mg i.v.) and (b)
      clonidine (1.25 mg i.v.). Plasma beta-END levels were measured before and at 15, 
      30, 45, 60 and 90 min after drug injection. Control women were studied by
      administering the two neuroendocrine tests only once. RESULTS: Postmenopausal
      women before HRT showed a pathological Kupperman and no changes of plasma
      beta-END levels in response to the clonidine and naloxone tests score. On the
      contrary the increase was significant in healthy women. In each of the three
      groups of treated women both naloxone and clonidine tests induced a significant
      increase in plasma beta-END levels (P < 0.01). After 6 months of HRT, an
      improvement of vasomotor and psychological symptoms was shown by a decrease of
      Kupperman score. CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicates that sequential
      treatment with transdermal 17 beta-estradiol and progestin, no matter which
      progestin was used, restores the beta-END release, improves vasomotor and
      psychological symptoms.

TI  - Risperidone versus haloperidol: I. Meta-analysis of efficacy and safety.
PG  - 58-71
AB  - Haloperidol is widely considered a reference standard in antipsychotic therapy
      and is commonly used in comparative studies of the efficacy and safety of
      antipsychotic medication. Comparative clinical trials have shown that the novel
      antipsychotic agent risperidone tends to have greater efficacy (i.e., clinical
      response defined as a > or = 20% reduction in total scores on the Positive and
      Negative Syndrome Scale) than haloperidol in patients with chronic schizophrenia 
      and poses less risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). We used DerSimonian and
      Laird's random-effects model to analyze pooled patient data from available
      randomized, double-masked, comparative trials of risperidone and haloperidol in
      patients with schizophrenia treated for at least 4 weeks at recommended doses.
      The purpose of the analysis was to determine whether there are significant
      overall differences in the rates of patient clinical response, prescription of
      anticholinergic agents, and treatment dropout. Six of the nine trials revealed in
      a literature search met all criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The
      meta-analysis showed that in patients with chronic schizophrenia, risperidone
      therapy is associated with significantly higher response rates, significantly
      less prescribing of anticholinergic medication, and significantly lower treatment
      dropout rates than haloperidol. These results demonstrate the greater treatment
      efficacy associated with risperidone compared with haloperidol and suggest both a
      lower incidence of EPS and improved treatment compliance.

TI  - Sulpiride augmentation in people with schizophrenia partially responsive to
      clozapine. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 569-73
AB  - BACKGROUND: We hypothesised that a combined regimen of clozapine, a relatively
      weak D2-dopaminergic antagonist, and sulpiride, a selective D2 blocker, would
      demonstrate a greater antipsychotic efficacy by enhancing the D2 blockade of
      clozapine. METHOD: Twenty-eight people with schizophrenia, previously
      unresponsive to typical antipsychotics and only partially responsive to current
      treatment with clozapine, received, double-blind, 600 mg/day sulpiride or
      placebo, in addition to an ongoing clozapine treatment. The clinical status was
      evaluated before, during, and at the end of 10 weeks of sulpiride addition using 
      the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Scale for the Assessment of Positive
      Symptoms (SAPS), Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms, and Hamilton
      Rating Scale for Depression. RESULTS: The clozapine-sulpiride group exhibited
      substantially greater and significant improvements in positive and negative
      psychotic symptoms. About half of them, characterised by a younger age and lower 
      baseline SAPS scores, had a mean reduction of 42.4 and 50.4% in their BPRS and
      SAPS scores, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A subgroup of patients with chronic
      schizophrenia may substantially benefit from sulpiride addition to clozapine.

TI  - The effects of clozapine on negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia with
      minimal positive symptoms.
PG  - 227-34
AB  - The effectiveness of clozapine in the treatment of the negative symptoms of
      schizophrenia remains controversial, as improvements in negative symptoms are
      invariably accompanied by improvements in positive symptoms and neurological side
      effects. We examined the effectiveness of treatment with clozapine on negative
      symptoms in a cohort of patients with minimal positive symptoms. Improvements in 
      positive and negative symptoms were measured by BPRS ratings in a subgroup of
      schizophrenic patients (n=17, from a state hospital cohort of 75) with minimal
      positive symptoms, who had received clozapine for 6 months. In this subgroup,
      significant improvements were noted by a composite score on the three negative
      symptom items of emotional withdrawal, blunted affect, and motor retardation.
      Positive and depressive symptoms remained unchanged. The remaining cohort (n=58) 
      showed improvements in overall psychopathology including positive, negative, and 
      depressive symptoms. Interestingly, nearly 50% of each group were discharged from
      the hospital. These findings suggest that clozapine may be beneficial in the
      treatment of core negative symptoms, even in the absence of other improvements in
      psychopathology. This effect of clozapine may be a function of its unique
      pharmacological profile.

TI  - New atypical antipsychotics. Experience and utility in the elderly.
PG  - 115-27
AB  - The atypical antipsychotics are a new class of agents with great promise for use 
      in the elderly because of their reduced propensity to cause acute extrapyramidal 
      adverse effects. Treatment of older patients with these agents, however, needs to
      take into consideration age-related changes in pharmacokinetics and the risks of 
      drug-drug interactions. Additionally, current evidence of their efficacy in
      late-life psychoses is derived largely from case series and from the
      extrapolation of results obtained in studies of younger patients with
      schizophrenia. Controlled clinical studies of atypical antipsychotics in elderly 
      patients are urgently needed.

TI  - Olanzapine: interaction study with imipramine.
PG  - 971-8
AB  - Olanzapine is an "atypical" antipsychotic agent with a high affinity for
      serotonin 5HT2A/C, 5HT3, 5HT6, and dopamine D1, D2, D3, D4 receptors. Depressed
      patients with psychotic disorders frequently require treatment with concomitant
      antipsychotic and antidepressant medications. Imipramine pharmacokinetics serve
      as a marker for hepatic CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP3A activity. An open-label, three-way 
      randomized crossover study was done to determine the safety, pharmacokinetics,
      and potential for a drug interaction between olanzapine (5 mg) and imipramine (75
      mg). Each drug was administered alone and in combination. Nine healthy men, ages 
      32 to 54 years, enrolled in the study. Psychomotor performance capacities, plasma
      olanzapine, imipramine, desipramine concentrations, and clinical laboratory tests
      were measured. Pharmacokinetic variables, vital signs, subjective tests for
      liveliness, and psychomotor outcomes were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA.
      Olanzapine was safe. Sedation, postural hypotension, and minor vital sign
      alterations occurred during all treatments. On the liveliness questionnaire,
      patients generally reported poorer (less lively) scores with olanzapine alone or 
      coadministered with imipramine versus baseline scores. These effects disappeared 
      within 24 hours after administration. Olanzapine alone and in combination
      decreased motor-speed tasks (finger tapping and visual-arm random reach) compared
      with baseline or imipramine treatment. Peak 6-hour changes were statistically
      significant but clinical importance was only marginal. Olanzapine concentrations 
      were < 19% greater than with imipramine. But olanzapine did not affect the
      kinetics of imipramine or desipramine and, therefore, did not show a metabolic
      drug interaction involving CYP2D6.

TI  - [Postoperative peridural analgesia. Continuous versus patient-controlled
      administration of a low-dose mixture of sufentanil, clonidine and bupivacaine].
PG  - 659-64
AB  - The purpose of our study was to find out whether patient-controlled epidural
      administration (PCEA) of a mixture containing a low-dose local anaesthetic,
      opioid and alpha 2-agonist provides as good or better postoperative analgesia as 
      continuous epidural administration of the same analgetic solution. METHODS: 30
      patients (ASA I-III), scheduled for major abdominal surgery, were randomly
      divided into 2 groups. 90 minutes after induction of general anaesthesia all
      patients received a continuous epidural infusion of 5 ml/h of the analgetic
      solution (50 micrograms sufentanil + 150 micrograms clonidine in 50 ml 0.125%
      bupivacaine) until the end of surgery. Immediately postoperatively the patients
      of group A received a continuous infusion of the study solution (5-8 ml/h), the
      patients of group B received a baseline continuous epidural infusion (3 ml/h),
      additionally they could self-administer 5 ml boli via a PCEA device. Measurements
      included the total dose of infused drug solution, pain at rest and on exercise by
      a visual analogue scale, cardiorespiratory data and side effects within the first
      24 hours postoperatively. A standardised interview on analgesia and side effects 
      was held 2 days after surgery. RESULTS: The PCEA group demanded less epidural
      analgesics (gr. B: 112 +/- 33 ml vs. gr. A: 135 +/- 20 ml) p < 0.01). Both
      continuous epidural infusion and patient-controlled administration provided very 
      good analgesia at rest (gr. A: VAS 0.4 +/- 0.4 and gr. B: VAS 0.4 +/- 0.5)
      (n.s.). On exercise continuous epidural infusion of analgesics resulted in
      significantly lower pain scores (gr. A: 1.9 +/- 1.1) than patient-controlled
      application (gr. B: 3.4 +/- 1.1) (p < 0.01). We did not notice severe side
      effects such as respiratory depression or drop of heart rate or blood pressure.
      CONCLUSION: In patients at rest both continuous and patient-controlled epidural
      administration of analgesics provides excellent analgesia after major abdominal
      surgery. Contrariwise, patients on exercise who could use a PCA-device
      experienced more pain compared to those with a continuous epidural infusion
      technique. On the other hand the patients of the PCA-group consumed less epidural
      analgesics. We did not notice any severe side effects such as respiratory
      depression or cardiovascular instability during the study.

      flow.
PG  - 1070-2
AB  - AIMS: To examine the effects of 0.5% apraclonidine on optic nerve head (ONH) and 
      peripapillary retinal blood flow by scanning laser Doppler flowmetry (SLDF).
      METHODS: ONH and peripapillary retinal blood flow of 17 healthy subjects were
      measured by SLDF before and 1 hour and 3 hours after unilateral administration of
      0.5% apraclonidine. The fellow eyes were treated with balanced salt solution and 
      the examiners were masked as to which eye was treated with apraclonidine. On each
      occasion, three scans were obtained and haemodynamic variables (volume, flow, and
      velocity) were analysed at eight locations, four in the neural rim and four in
      the peripapillary retina, avoiding ophthalmoscopically visible vessels. The
      statistical significance of changes from the baseline value of variables and the 
      differences in the measured quantities between apraclonidine treated eyes and
      fellow eyes at each time point were evaluated using Wilcoxon signed rank test.
      RESULTS: The intraocular pressure was reduced significantly in apraclonidine
      treated eyes by 15.0% (p = 0.001) at 1 hour and 30.0% (p = 0.000) at 3 hours
      after administration. In the volume, flow, or velocity of ONH and peripapillary
      retinal blood flow, there were no significant changes from the baseline values at
      1 hour and 3 hours after apraclonidine administration in either apraclonidine
      treated eyes (p > 0.4) or fellow eyes (p > 0.2). Also, no significant differences
      were found in the measured quantities between apraclonidine treated eyes and
      fellow eyes at each time point (p > 0.1). CONCLUSION: A single dose of topical
      apraclonidine 0.5% in healthy subjects does not have adverse effects on the ONH
      and peripapillary retinal blood flow.

TI  - Modification of the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) Scale for use in bipolar
      illness (BP): the CGI-BP.
PG  - 159-71
AB  - The Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI) was modified specifically for use in 
      assessing global illness severity and change in patients with bipolar disorder.
      Criticisms of the original CGI were addressed by correcting inconsistencies in
      scaling, identifying time frames for comparison, clarifying definitions of
      illness severity and change, and separating out assessment of treatment side
      effects from illness improvement during treatment. A Detailed User's Guide was
      developed to train clinicians in the use of the new CGI-Bipolar Version (CGI-BP) 
      for rating severity of manic and depressive episodes and the degree of change
      from the immediately preceding phase and from the worst phase of illness. The
      revised scale and manual provide a focused set of instructions to facilitate the 
      reliability of these ratings of mania, depression, and overall bipolar illness
      during treatment of an acute episode or in longer-term illness prophylaxis.
      Interrater reliability of the scale was demonstrated in preliminary analyses.
      Thus, the modified CGI-BP is anticipated to be more useful than the original CGI 
      in studies of bipolar disorder.

TI  - A new self-report scale for assessment of adolescent psychopathology: factor
      structure, reliability, validity, and diagnostic sensitivity.
PG  - 487-97
AB  - This paper describes four studies on self-reported problems in 2,243 adolescent
      males and females, 12 to 17 years of age. In Study 1, principal-axis factoring of
      102 items covering 11 problem domains revealed six factors comprising 49.5% of
      the variance. Study 2 used confirmatory factor analysis of a 64-item reduced set 
      on a new sample of 408 adolescents. Goodness-of-fit indicators suggested that the
      six-factor model had excellent fit to the data. Study 3 used data from the 2,157 
      adolescents used in the first two studies. Coefficient alphas ranged from .83 to 
      .92. Median test-retest reliability for the six factors was .86. There was a
      consistent structure of the correlation matrix across age and gender. Study 4 was
      a study of criterion validity, using an additional sample of 86 children with
      attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Sensitivity and specificity were
      high, with an overall diagnostic efficiency of 83%. This new self-report scale,
      the Conners/Wells Adolescent Self-Report of Symptoms (CASS), may provide a useful
      component of a multimodal assessment of adolescent psychopathology.

TI  - Effects of methylphenidate on attentional function after traumatic brain injury. 
      A randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 440-50
AB  - Attention deficits after traumatic brain injury (TBI) are common and disabling.
      Many pharmacologic agents have been used to ameliorate attention deficits, and
      considerable interest has focused on methylphenidate (MP) because of its
      documented efficacy in attention deficit disorder. However, clinical studies of
      MP in subjects with TBI have yielded mixed results. We examined the effects of MP
      on attentional function in individuals with TBI referred specifically for
      attentional assessment and treatment. Subjects were studied in a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, repeated crossover design, using five different tasks
      designed to measure various facets of attentional function. MP produced a
      significant improvement in the speed of mental processing. Orienting to
      distractions, most aspects of sustained attention, and measures of motor speed
      were unaffected. These results suggest that MP may be a useful treatment in TBI
      but is primarily useful for symptoms that can be attributed to slowed mental
      processing.

TI  - Randomized trial of modafinil for the treatment of pathological somnolence in
      narcolepsy. US Modafinil in Narcolepsy Multicenter Study Group.
PG  - 88-97
AB  - Narcolepsy is a central nervous system disorder characterized by excessive
      daytime sleepiness and cataplexy. This placebo-controlled, double-blind,
      randomized, parallel-group, 18-center study assessed the efficacy and safety of
      modafinil, a new wake-promoting drug for treating sleepiness in narcolepsy.
      Subjects with narcolepsy (n = 283) received daily modafinil, 200 or 400 mg, or
      placebo, for 9 weeks, followed by an open-label treatment period. Subjective
      sleepiness was measured with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Objective sleepiness
      was assessed with the Multiple Sleep Latency Test and the Maintenance of
      Wakefulness Test. Level of illness was measured with the Clinical Global
      Impression of Change. Modafinil significantly reduced all measures of sleepiness 
      and was associated with significant improvements in level of illness.
      Medication-related adverse experiences were few, dose-dependent, and mostly rated
      mild to moderate. Modafinil taken once daily was a very well tolerated and
      effective wake-promoting agent in the treatment of excessive daytime somnolence
      associated with narcolepsy. Modafinil demonstrated an excellent safety profile
      for up to 40 weeks of open-label treatment and efficacy was maintained,
      suggesting that tolerance will not develop with long-term use. Modafinil is a
      pharmacologically and clinically promising compound for the treatment of
      pathological daytime somnolence.

TI  - The effects of risperidone on the five dimensions of schizophrenia derived by
      factor analysis: combined results of the North American trials.
PG  - 538-46
AB  - BACKGROUND: In two double-blind trials conducted in North America, 513 patients
      with chronic schizophrenia received risperidone, haloperidol, or placebo. In the 
      present study, combined data from the two trials were analyzed. METHOD: Patients 
      were randomly assigned to receive placebo, fixed doses of risperidone (2, 6, 10, 
      and 16 mg/day) or 20 mg/day of haloperidol for 8 weeks. Factor analysis of scores
      on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) produced five dimensions
      (negative symptoms, positive symptoms, disorganized thought, uncontrolled
      hostility/excitement, and anxiety/depression), similar to the five dimensions of 
      previous factor-analytic studies of PANSS data. RESULTS: Mean changes (symptom
      reductions) in PANSS factor scores from baseline to treatment Weeks 6 and 8 were 
      significantly greater in patients receiving 6-16 mg/day of risperidone than in
      patients receiving placebo or haloperidol. The advantages of risperidone were
      greatest for negative symptoms, uncontrolled hostility/excitement, and
      anxiety/depression. Even at the lowest dose, 2 mg/day, risperidone was
      significantly (p < or = .05) superior to haloperidol in reducing negative
      symptoms. The differences in outcomes between risperidone and haloperidol on
      PANSS scores were not related to extrapyramidal symptoms. CONCLUSION: Risperidone
      produced significantly (p < or = .05) greater improvements than haloperidol on
      all five dimensions. The large between-group differences on negative symptoms,
      hostility/excitement, and anxiety/depression suggest that risperidone and other
      serotonin/dopamine antagonists have qualitatively different effects from those of
      conventional antipsychotic agents.

TI  - Double-blind comparison of bupropion sustained release and sertraline in
      depressed outpatients.
PG  - 532-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: A sustained-release formulation of bupropion (bupropion SR),
      developed with an improved pharmacokinetic profile to permit less frequent dosing
      than the immediate-release form, has not been evaluated in active comparator
      trials. This randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial was conducted to
      compare the efficacy and safety of bupropion SR and sertraline. METHOD:
      Outpatients with moderate to severe major depressive disorder (DSM-IV) received
      bupropion SR (100-300 mg/day) or sertraline (50-200 mg/day) for 16 weeks.
      Psychiatric evaluations, including the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression
      (HAM-D), the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A), the Clinical Global
      Impressions scale for Severity of Illness (CGI-S), and for Improvement (CGI-I)
      were completed, and adverse events were assessed in the clinic periodically
      throughout treatment. Patients' orgasm function was also assessed. RESULTS: Mean 
      HAM-D, HAM-A, CGI-I, and CGI-S scores improved over the course of treatment in
      both the bupropion SR group and the sertraline group; no between-group
      differences were observed on any of the scales. Orgasm dysfunction was
      significantly (p < .001) more common in sertraline-treated patients compared with
      bupropion SR-treated patients. The adverse events of nausea, diarrhea,
      somnolence, and sweating were also experienced more frequently (p < .05) in
      sertraline-treated patients. No differences were noted between the two treatments
      for vital signs and weight. CONCLUSION: This double-blind comparison of bupropion
      SR and sertraline demonstrates that bupropion and sertraline are similarly
      effective for the treatment of depression. Both compounds were relatively well
      tolerated, and orgasm dysfunction, nausea, diarrhea, somnolence, and sweating
      were reported more frequently in sertraline-treated patients.

TI  - Physostigmine prevents postanesthetic shivering as does meperidine or clonidine.
PG  - 108-13
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postanesthetic shivering develops in as many as one half of patients 
      recovering from isoflurane anesthesia. Cholinergic stimulation of the
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and adrenal medulla by physostigmine enhances
      secretion of arginine vasopressin, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. Because the
      hypothalamus is the dominant thermoregulatory controller in mammals, and these
      neurotransmitters may be involved in body temperature control, physostigmine
      administration may influence the incidence of shivering. Accordingly, the authors
      tested the hypothesis that physostigmine administration inhibits postanesthetic
      shivering. Its efficacy was compared with that of saline (negative control) and
      meperidine and clonidine (positive controls). METHODS: Sixty patients having
      surgery of the ear or nose were tested. General anesthesia was induced with 2
      mg/kg propofol, 0.1 mg/kg vecuronium, and 1.5 microg/kg fentanyl and maintained
      with isoflurane (1.5 +/- 0.4%) in 70% nitrous oxide. At the end of surgery, the
      patients were randomly assigned to receive an intravenous bolus of 0.04 mg/kg
      physostigmine, isotonic saline, 0.5 mg/kg meperidine, or 1.5 microg/kg clonidine.
      Heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, oxygen saturation, visual analog pain
      score, temperature, and postanesthetic shivering were measured during recovery.
      RESULTS: Postanesthetic shivering occurred in 6 of 15 (40%) patients given
      saline. In contrast, postanesthetic shivering was significantly reduced in
      physostigmine-treated patients (1 of 15, or 7%) and was absent in patients given 
      clonidine or meperidine. CONCLUSIONS: Physostigmine inhibited shivering as well
      as did two established treatments, meperidine and clonidine. These data suggest
      that cholinergic systems contribute to the genesis and control of postanesthetic 
      shivering.

      elderly schizophrenic patients with or without tardive dyskinesia.
PG  - 20-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasma homovanillic acid (HVA) changes in response to a challenge of 
      several days with haloperidol have been found to be predictive of the therapeutic
      response to haloperidol over a longer period of treatment. METHODS: Twenty-six
      elderly women who gave informed consent were divided into two groups, with or
      without tardive dyskinesia, and subjected to an 80-day washout, after which both 
      the dyskinetic and nondyskinetic group was divided, and half of each group given 
      haloperidol or clozapine. CONCLUSIONS: The nondyskinetic group had a brief rise
      in plasma HVA, then a decline. The dyskinetic group had no change in plasma HVA. 
      Neither group challenged with clozapine had any change in plasma HVA.

TI  - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and CNS drug interactions. A critical
      review of the evidence.
PG  - 454-71
AB  - The potential for drug-drug interactions in psychiatric patients is very high as 
      combination psychopharmacotherapy used to treat comorbid psychiatric disorders,
      to treat the adverse effects of a medication, to augment a medication effect or
      to treat concomitant medical illnesses. Interactions can be pharmacodynamic or
      pharmacokinetic in nature. This paper focuses on the metabolic kinetic
      interactions between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other
      central nervous system (CNS) drugs. The evidence for and clinical significance of
      these interactions are reviewed, with special emphasis on antipsychotics,
      tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines. Many psychotropic medications have
      an affinity for the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes which promote elimination by
      transforming lipid soluble substances into more polar compounds. SSRIs serve both
      as substrates and inhibitors of these enzymes. In vitro studies provide a
      screening method for evaluating drug affinities for substrates, inhibitors or
      inducers of CYP enzymes. Although in vitro data are important as a starting point
      for predicting these metabolic kinetic drug interactions, case reports and
      controlled experimental studies in humans are required to fully evaluate their
      clinical significance. Several factors must be considered when evaluating the
      clinical significance of a potential interaction including: (a) the nature of
      each drugs' activity at an enzyme site (substrate, inhibitor or inducer); (b) the
      potency estimations for the inhibitor/inducer; (c) the concentration of the
      inhibitor/inducer at the enzyme site; (d) the saturability of the enzyme; (e) the
      extent of metabolism of the substrate through this enzyme (versus alternative
      metabolic routes); (f) the presence of active metabolites of the substrate; (g)
      the therapeutic window of the substrate; (h) the inherent enzyme activity of the 
      individual, phenotyping/genotyping information; (i) the level of risk of the
      individual experiencing adverse effects (e.g. the elderly) and (j) from an
      epidemiological perspective, the probability of concurrent use. This paper
      systematically reviews both the in vitro and in vivo evidence for drug
      interactions between SSRIs and other CNS drugs. As potent inhibitors of CYP2D6,
      both paroxetine and fluoxetine have the potential to increase the plasma
      concentrations of antipsychotic medications metabolised through this enzyme,
      including perphenazine, haloperidol, thioridazine and risperidone in patients who
      are CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers. Controlled studies have demonstrated this for 
      perphenazine with paroxetine and haloperidol with fluoxetine. Fluvoxamine, as a
      potent inhibitor of CYP1A2, can inhibit the metabolism of clozapine, resulting in
      higher plasma concentrations. Drug interactions between the SSRIs and tricyclic
      antidepressants (TCAs) can occur. Fluoxetine and paroxetine, as potent inhibitors
      of CYP2D6, can increase the plasma concentrations of secondary and tertiary
      tricyclic antidepressants. Sertraline and citalopram are less likely to have this
      effect. Fluvoxamine can increase the plasma concentrations of tertiary TCAs.
      Fluvoxamine inhibits, via CYP3A. CYP2C19 and CYP1A2, the metabolism of several
      benzodiazepines, including alprazolam, bromazepam and diazepam. Fluoxetine
      increases the plasma concentrations of alprazolam and diazepam by inhibiting
      CYP3A and CYP2C19, respectively. The clinical importance of the interaction with 
      diazepam is attenuated by the presence of its active metabolite. Sertraline
      inhibits these enzymes only mildely to moderately at usual therapeutic doses.
      Therefore the potential for interactions is less; however, the in vivo evidence
      is minimal. Paroxetine and citalopram are unlikely to cause interactions with
      benzodiazepines. The evidence is conflicting for an interaction between
      carbamazepine and the SSRIs fluoxetine and fluvoxamine. These combinations should
      be used cautiously, and be accompanied by monitoring for adverse events and carb

TI  - The efficacy and safety of a clonidine/bupivacaine combination in caudal blockade
      for pediatric hernia repair.
PG  - 54-61
AB  - We evaluated the analgesic efficacy and hemodynamic and respiratory safety of
      clonidine when added to bupivacaine for caudal blocks in 58 children aged 38 +/- 
      2 mo (mean +/- SEM). Patients scheduled for ambulatory hernia repair were
      randomly given a caudal injection (0.75 mL/kg) of either saline placebo (P
      group), bupivacaine, 0.25% (B group), bupivacaine plus epinephrine 1:200,000 (BE 
      group), bupivacaine plus clonidine 1 microgram/kg (BC1 group), or bupivacaine
      plus clonidine 2 micrograms/kg (BC2 group). Postoperative measurements included
      duration of analgesia, hemodynamics, and respiratory monitoring for 6 h.
      Thereafter, parents assessed their child's analgesic requirements at home every 3
      h for 18 h. The duration of analgesia (median [range]) was significantly longer
      (P < 0.05) in the BC1 and BC2 groups (360 [270-360] min and 360 [355-360] min,
      respectively) compared with the P (77[45-190]), B (346[105-360]), or BE group
      (300[75-360]). Similarly, the BC1 and BC2 groups required less additional
      analgesic within the first 24 h. All groups showed a significant decrease in mean
      arterial pressure compared with baseline values, but the differences among the
      groups were not significant. Bradycardia and respiratory depression were not
      observed. Clonidine 1 and 2 micrograms/kg can be safely added to bupivacaine
      caudal blockade in small children for ambulatory hernia repair to achieve an
      increased duration of analgesia compared with bupivacaine alone or bupivacaine
      plus epinephrine. Implications: The addition of clonidine, an antihypertensive
      drug with analgesic properties, to local anesthetics in caudal blocks prolongs
      postoperative pain relief and reduces the need for additional pain treatment in
      children after hernia operation.

TI  - Replacement medication for cocaine dependence: methylphenidate.
PG  - 485-8
AB  - Agonists, or "replacement medications," are useful adjuncts in treatment of
      opiate and nicotine dependence. They have not been systematically examined in
      cocaine dependence. Results of early open trials with methylphenidate for
      treatment of cocaine dependence were equivocal. Twenty-four cocaine-dependent
      subjects were enrolled in an 11-week double-blind, placebo-controlled study of
      methylphenidate. Assignment was random. Intake included a 2-day human laboratory 
      procedure in which subjects received initial doses of methylphenidate or placebo.
      Subjects attended the clinic Monday through Friday and received oral doses of
      methylphenidate (5 mg plus 20-mg sustained release) or placebo at 8:00 a.m., with
      afternoon and weekend take-home doses (20 mg sustained-release or placebo)
      provided in Medication Events Monitoring System bottles to monitor compliance.
      Clinic visits included therapy sessions, electrocardiograms, self-report
      measures, and twice-weekly urine screens. The two groups were equivalent in terms
      of retention (methylphenidate 48% and placebo 42%) and had similar cocaine use
      outcomes (40% benzoylecgonine-positive urine screens). There were no significant 
      adverse effects. The doses were sufficient to permit detection of psychoactive
      effects ("stimulant," "more energy") and side effects ("jitteriness," "eating
      less") without increased "craving." Additional medications with different effects
      profiles are being studied to further evaluate the replacement model in cocaine
      dependence.

TI  - Clinical efficacy of methylphenidate in conduct disorder with and without
      attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - 1073-80
AB  - BACKGROUND: Stimulants are not considered appropriate for the treatment of
      children with conduct disorders (CDs). The postulated differences in stimulant
      effect between children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and 
      CD led to the hypothesis that methylphenidate hydrochloride, which is effective
      in ADHD, would not significantly improve symptoms of CD. METHODS: We randomly
      assigned 84 children with CD, between the ages of 6 and 15 years, to receive
      methylphenidate hydrochloride (up to 60 mg/d) or placebo for 5 weeks. Behavior
      was evaluated by parent, teacher, and clinician reports and by direct classroom
      observations. Two thirds of the children also met criteria for ADHD. RESULTS:
      Contrary to prediction, ratings of antisocial behaviors specific to CD were
      significantly reduced by methylphenidate treatment. The magnitude of
      methylphenidate effect indicated meaningful clinical benefit. Partialling out
      severity of ADHD did not alter the significant superiority of methylphenidate on 
      CD ratings specifically (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Methylphenidate has short-term
      positive effects on children and adolescents with CD. Key aspects of antisocial
      adjustment appear to be treatment responsive. This effect was independent of
      severity of the children's initial ADHD symptoms.

TI  - Randomised controlled trial of growth effect of hydrocortisone in congenital
      adrenal hyperplasia.
PG  - 214-8
AB  - The influence of 15 or 25 mg/m2 of daily oral hydrocortisone with fludrocortisone
      0.1 mg/day on growth and laboratory findings was evaluated in a prospective
      randomised crossover trial over 12 months in 26 children with 21-hydroxylase
      deficiency. Nine non-salt losers had fludrocortisone stopped for a further six
      month period. Height velocity was significantly decreased during treatment with
      25 mg/m2 as compared with 15 mg/m2. This was the most sensitive indicator of
      corticosteroid treatment excess. A dose dependent effect upon plasma
      concentrations of 17-hydroxyprogesterone, testosterone, and androstenedione was
      found but increased values were still detected in more than half of the
      determinations made during the 25 mg/m2 period. Height velocity and
      17-hydroxyprogesterone concentrations were positively correlated. Growth hormone 
      response to clonidine stimulation and insulin-like growth factor-1 concentrations
      were both within reference values and there was no difference between treatment
      periods. Withdrawal of fludrocortisone did not result in any difference for the
      non-salt losers. It was concluded that 25 mg/m2 of hydrocortisone depressed
      growth in children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and that full
      suppression, or even normalisation, of plasma concentrations of
      17-hydroxyprogesterone and androgens should not be considered a treatment goal,
      but instead an indication of corticosteroid treatment excess.

TI  - Epidural epinephrine and clonidine: segmental analgesia and effects on different 
      pain modalities.
PG  - 785-94
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is not known whether epidural epinephrine has an analgesic effect 
      per se. The segmental distribution of clonidine epidural analgesia and its
      effects on temporal summation and different types of noxious stimuli are unknown.
      The aim of this study was to clarify these issues. METHODS: Fifteen healthy
      volunteers received epidurally (L2-L3 or L3-L4) 20 ml of either epinephrine, 100 
      microg, in saline; clonidine, 8 microg/kg, in saline; or saline, 0.9%, alone, on 
      three different days in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over fashion. Pain
      rating after electrical stimulation, pinprick, and cold perception were recorded 
      on the dermatomes S1, L4, L1, T9, T6, T1, and forehead. Pressure pain tolerance
      threshold was recorded at S1, T6, and ear. Pain thresholds to single and repeated
      (temporal summation) electrical stimulation of the sural nerve were determined.
      RESULTS: Epinephrine significantly reduced sensitivity to pinprick at L1-L4-S1.
      Clonidine significantly decreased pain rating after electrical stimulation at
      L1-L4 and sensitivity to pinprick and cold at L1-L4-S1, increased pressure pain
      tolerance threshold at S1, and increased thresholds after single and repeated
      stimulation of the sural nerve. CONCLUSIONS: Epidural epinephrine and clonidine
      produce segmental hypoalgesia. Clonidine bolus should be administered at a spinal
      level corresponding to the painful area. Clonidine inhibits temporal summation
      elicited by repeated electrical stimulation and may therefore attenuate spinal
      cord hyperexcitability.

TI  - A comparison of quetiapine and chlorpromazine in the treatment of schizophrenia.
PG  - 265-73
AB  - A 6-week, double-blind, randomized, multicentre, parallel-group study was
      conducted to compare the efficacy of quetiapine ('Seroquel') (n=101) with that of
      chlorpromazine (n=100) in hospitalized patients with acute exacerbation of
      subchronic or chronic schizophrenia, or schizophreniform disorder. The
      tolerabilities of the two treatments were also compared. The mean daily doses of 
      quetiapine and chlorpromazine at the end of the study were 407 mg and 384 mg,
      respectively. Both treatments were effective in the treatment of positive and
      negative symptoms, with a trend towards superior efficacy for quetiapine. The
      quetiapine group had a lower incidence of adverse events than the chlorpromazine 
      group, and a low incidence of treatment-emergent extrapyramidal symptoms.
      Quetiapine was not associated with a sustained increase in serum prolactin. These
      clinical data support the preclinical profile of quetiapine as an atypical
      antipsychotic agent.

TI  - Clozapine blunts N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist-induced psychosis: a study with 
      ketamine.
PG  - 664-8
AB  - Several lines of evidence suggest that the glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate
      (NMDA) receptor is involved in the antipsychotic efficacy of the atypical
      antipsychotic agent clozapine. Clinical data on the interaction between
      clozapine's mechanism of action and NMDA receptor function have been lacking
      secondary to a paucity of pharmacologic probes of the NMDA system. We have
      utilized a double-blind, placebo-controlled infusion paradigm with subanesthetic 
      doses of the NMDA antagonist ketamine to test the hypothesis that clozapine would
      blunt ketamine-induced psychotic symptoms in schizophrenic patients. Ten
      schizophrenic patients underwent ketamine infusions while antipsychotic drug free
      and also during treatment with clozapine. Antipsychotic drug-free patients
      experienced increases in ratings of positive and negative symptoms. Clozapine
      treatment significantly blunted the ketamine-induced increase in positive
      symptoms. These data suggest that NMDA receptor function may be involved in the
      unique antipsychotic efficacy of clozapine.

TI  - Safety issues in the use of methylphenidate. An American perspective.
PG  - 143-8
AB  - Methylphenidate is the most widely use psychotropic medication in children in the
      US. It is both well tolerated and efficacious in the treatment of attention
      deficit hyperactivity disorder, and is associated with few serious adverse
      effects. However, the abuse of methylphenidate for the purpose of experiencing a 
      'high' is hazardous. The use of methylphenidate in combination with other
      medications increases the risk of adverse effects and drug interactions. Good
      communication between the physician, patient and family, together with
      monitoring, increases the likelihood that methylphenidate therapy will be
      effective and have no adverse consequences.

TI  - A comparison of sustained-release bupropion and placebo for smoking cessation.
PG  - 1195-202
AB  - BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Trials of antidepressant medications for smoking
      cessation have had mixed results. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled
      trial of a sustained-release form of bupropion for smoking cessation. We excluded
      smokers with current depression, but not those with a history of major
      depression. The 615 subjects were randomly assigned to receive placebo or
      bupropion at a dose of 100, 150, or 300 mg per day for seven weeks. The target
      quitting date (or "target quit date") was one week after the beginning of
      treatment. Brief counseling was provided at base line, weekly during treatment,
      and at 8, 12, 26, and 52 weeks. Self-reported abstinence was confirmed by a
      carbon monoxide concentration in expired air of 10 ppm or less. RESULTS: At the
      end of seven weeks of treatment, the rates of smoking cessation as confirmed by
      carbon monoxide measurements were 19.0 percent in the placebo group, 28.8 percent
      in the 100-mg group, 38.6 percent in the 150-mg group, and 44.2 percent in the
      300-mg group (P<0.001). At one year the respective rates were 12.4 percent, 19.6 
      percent, 22.9 percent, and 23.1 percent. The rates for the 150-mg group (P=0.02) 
      and the 300-mg group (P=0.01) -- but not the 100-mg group (P=0.09) -- were
      significantly better than those for the placebo group. Among the subjects who
      were continuously abstinent through the end of treatment, the mean absolute
      weight gain was inversely associated with the dose (a gain of 2.9 kg in the
      placebo group, 2.3 kg in 100-mg and 150-mg groups, and 1.5 kg in the 300-mg
      group; P= 0.02). No effects of treatment were observed on depression scores as
      measured serially by the Beck Depression Inventory. Thirty-seven subjects stopped
      treatment prematurely because of adverse events; the frequency was similar among 
      all groups. CONCLUSIONS: A sustained-release form of bupropion was effective for 
      smoking cessation and was accompanied by reduced weight gain and minimal side
      effects. Many participants in all groups were smoking at one year.

TI  - Influence of clonidine on psychopathological, endocrine and respiratory effects
      of cholecystokinin tetrapeptide in patients with panic disorder.
PG  - 55-61
AB  - The influence of clonidine pretreatment on psychopathological, endocrine and
      respiratory effects of cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (CCK-4) was characterized.
      Patients with panic disorder (DSM-III-R) were given 50 micrograms CCK-4 i.v. at
      1100 hours on 2 separate study days. In a randomized double-blind design they
      were additionally infused with 150 micrograms clonidine or placebo from 1040 to
      1110 hours. After CCK-4 all patients experienced symptom attacks. No effects of
      clonidine on panic psychopathology or blood gas parameters were observed. After
      CCK-4, in the clonidine condition the pituitary release of adrenocorticotropin
      (ACTH) and prolactin was seemingly enhanced compared to placebo. Our results
      suggest that CCK-4-induced panic attacks are not suppressible by presynaptic
      alpha-2 receptor stimulation. Moreover, they point to a synergistic postsynaptic 
      action of clonidine to CCK-4 upon pituitary hormone secretion. The diverging
      sites of action might possibly explain the discrepancies of psychopathological
      alterations and stress hormone secretion.

TI  - Double-blind comparison of olanzapine versus risperidone in the treatment of
      schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.
PG  - 407-18
AB  - Olanzapine and risperidone, both second-generation antipsychotic agents,
      represent two different pharmacologic strategies. Although they share some in
      vitro properties, they differ by virtue of their chemical structure, spectrum of 
      receptor binding affinities, animal neuropharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and in
      vivo neuroimaging profile. Based on such differences, it was hypothesized that
      the two compounds would show distinct safety and/or efficacy characteristics. To 
      test this hypothesis, an international, multicenter, double-blind,
      parallel-group, 28-week prospective study was conducted with 339 patients who met
      DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, or schizoaffective 
      disorder. Results of the study indicated that both olanzapine and risperidone
      were safe and effective in the management of psychotic symptoms. However,
      olanzapine demonstrated significantly greater efficacy in negative symptoms
      (Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms summary score), as well as overall
      response rate (> or = 40% decrease in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale
      total score). Furthermore, a statistically significantly greater proportion of
      the olanzapine-treated than risperidone-treated patients maintained their
      response at 28 weeks based on Kaplan-Meier survival curves. The incidence of
      extrapyramidal side effects, hyperprolactinemia, and sexual dysfunction was
      statistically significantly lower in olanzapine-treated than risperidone-treated 
      patients. In addition, statistically significantly fewer adverse events were
      reported by olanzapine-treated patients than by their risperidone-treated
      counterparts. Thus, the differential preclinical profiles of these two drugs were
      also evident in a controlled, clinical investigation. Olanzapine seemed to have a
      risk-versus-benefit advantage.

TI  - Bupropion and sexual function: a placebo-controlled prospective study on diabetic
      men with erectile dysfunction.
PG  - 350-7
AB  - Many antidepressant agents interfere with sexual function. The purpose of this
      single-blind, prospective study was to determine sexual side effects, both
      positive and negative, of the amino-ketone antidepressant bupropion in a group of
      nondepressed diabetic men with somatic erectile dysfunction. Fourteen men
      participated in a 10-week protocol consisting sequentially of 2 weeks of baseline
      testing, 2 weeks of placebo, and 6 weeks of bupropion. Participants also
      completed daily and weekly questionnaires concerning sexual functioning, and a
      team of investigators rated various dimensions of sexual function every 2 weeks. 
      In addition, a variety of physiologic measures, relevant either to erectile
      function or to neural/vascular systems that underlie sexual response, were
      assessed during baseline and bupropion treatment. Results indicated that neither 
      subjective nor objective measures of erectile and overall sexual functioning
      worsened during bupropion. In fact, several measures suggested a trend toward
      improved sexual functioning. Furthermore, diabetic control was unaffected by
      bupropion administration. Given the lack of adverse effects on sexual function,
      along with the potential for improved erectile response, bupropion may provide an
      attractive choice for the treatment of depression in diabetic men or others for
      whom sexual dysfunction is a concern.

TI  - A comparison of clozapine and haloperidol in hospitalized patients with
      refractory schizophrenia. Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study Group 
      on Clozapine in Refractory Schizophrenia.
PG  - 809-15
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clozapine, a relatively expensive antipsychotic drug, is widely used 
      to treat patients with refractory schizophrenia. It has a low incidence of
      extrapyramidal side effects but may cause agranulocytosis. There have been no
      long-term assessments of its effect on symptoms, social functioning, and the use 
      and cost of health care. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, one-year,
      double-blind comparative study of clozapine (in 205 patients) and haloperidol (in
      218 patients) at 15 Veterans Affairs medical centers. All participants had
      refractory schizophrenia and had been hospitalized for the disease for 30 to 364 
      days in the previous year. All patients received case-management and
      social-rehabilitation services, as clinically indicated. RESULTS: In the
      clozapine group, 117 patients (57 percent) continued their assigned treatment for
      the entire year, as compared with 61 (28 percent) of the patients in the
      haloperidol group (P<0.001). As judged according to the Positive and Negative
      Syndrome Scale of Schizophrenia, patients in the clozapine group had 5.4 percent 
      lower symptom levels than those in the haloperidol group at all follow-up
      evaluations (mean score, 79.1 vs. 83.6; P=0.02). The differences on a
      quality-of-life scale were not significant in the intention-to-treat analysis,
      but they were significant among patients who did not cross over to the other
      treatment (P=0.003). Over a one-year period, patients assigned to clozapine had
      fewer mean days of hospitalization for psychiatric reasons than patients assigned
      to haloperidol (143.8 vs. 168.1 days, P=0.03) and used more outpatient services
      (133.6 vs. 97.9 units of service, P=0.03). The total per capita costs to society 
      were high -- $58,151 in the clozapine group and $60,885 in the haloperidol group 
      (P=0.41). The per capita costs of antipsychotic drugs were $3,199 in the
      clozapine group and $367 in the haloperidol group (P<0.001). Patients assigned to
      clozapine had less tardive dyskinesia and fewer extrapyramidal side effects.
      Agranulocytosis developed in three patients in the clozapine group; all recovered
      fully. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with refractory schizophrenia and high levels of
      hospital use, clozapine was somewhat more effective than haloperidol and had
      fewer side effects and similar overall costs.

AB  - The Collaborative Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with Attention Deficit
      Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), the MTA, is the first child multisite cooperative 
      agreement treatment study of children conducted by the National Institute of
      Mental Health, Rockville, Md. It examines the long-term effectiveness of
      medication vs behavioral treatment vs both for treatment of ADHD and compares
      state-of-the-art treatment with routine community care. In a parallel-groups
      design, 576 children (age, 7-9 years) with ADHD (96 at each site) are thoroughly 
      assessed and randomized to 4 conditions: (1) medication alone, (2) psychosocial
      treatment alone, (3) the combination of both, (4) or community comparison. The
      first 3 groups are treated for 14 months and all are reassessed periodically for 
      24 months. Designers met the following challenges: framing clinically relevant
      primary questions; defining the target population; choice, intensity, and
      integration and combination of treatments for fair comparisons; combining
      scientific controls and standardization with clinical flexibility; and
      implementing a controlled clinical trial in a nonclinical setting (school)
      controlled by others. Innovative solutions included extensive decision algorithms
      and manualized adaptations of treatments to specific needs.

TI  - Long-term stimulant treatment of children with attention-deficit hyperactivity
      disorder symptoms. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 857-64
AB  - BACKGROUND: We wanted to study the effects of amphetamine on symptoms of
      attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) over a longer period than has
      been reported in previous studies of central stimulants in this condition.
      METHODS: Sixty-two children, aged 6 to 11 years, meeting DSM-III-R symptom
      criteria for ADHD participated in a parallel-group design, randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study of amphetamine treatment. Treatment was
      not restricted to children with "pure" ADHD, ie, some had comorbid diagnoses. In 
      the amphetamine group, children received active treatment for 15 months. RESULTS:
      Amphetamine was clearly superior to placebo in reducing inattention,
      hyperactivity, and other disruptive behavior problems and tended to lead to
      improved results on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children--Revised.
      Treatment failure rate was considerably lower and time to treatment failure was
      longer in the amphetamine group. Adverse effects were few and relatively mild.
      CONCLUSION: The results of this long-term, placebo-controlled study of the
      central stimulant amphetamine in the treatment of ADHD indicate that there are
      remaining positive effects of the drug 15 months after starting treatment.

PG  - 434-45
AB  - Event-related potential (ERP) studies report that the positive deflection
      following stimulus evaluation at 300 msec (P3) in hyperactive children is
      augmented by methylphenidate (MP). This study investigates P3 and preceding ERP
      components using an auditory oddball task in attention-deficit hyperactivity
      disorder (ADHD). Mismatch negativity, negativity at 100 and 200 msec, and
      positivity at 200 msec and 300 msec (P3) were obtained from 14 control and
      hyperkinetic children. ADHD children who responded to MP were tested on two
      separate days while receiving either MP or placebo. Controls were tested once. No
      differences were found between groups for ERP components preceding P3. P3
      amplitude was significantly larger under MP than under placebo, but did not
      differ from controls. Under MP, differences in P3 amplitude unexpectedly occurred
      when no response was required. A P3 amplitude increase under MP and the
      unexpected P3 suggest that MP affects attention regulation.

TI  - Blind, controlled, long-term study of the comparative incidence of
      treatment-emergent tardive dyskinesia with olanzapine or haloperidol.
PG  - 1248-54
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Tardive dyskinesia is a serious and common complication of neuroleptic
      treatment. Olanzapine is a novel antipsychotic agent exhibiting regional
      mesolimbic dopaminergic selectivity and a broad-based pharmacology encompassing
      serotonin, dopamine, muscarinic, and adrenergic receptor binding affinities. The 
      authors' goal was to compare the incidence of tardive dyskinesia among patients
      receiving olanzapine and those receiving the conventional dopamine 2 antagonist
      haloperidol. METHOD: Data were analyzed from three actively controlled and blind 
      long-term responder studies of subjects meeting DSM-III-R criteria for
      schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, or schizoaffective disorder treated
      with olanzapine (N = 707, up to 20 mg/day, 237 median days of exposure) or
      haloperidol (N = 197, up to 20 mg/day, 203 median days of exposure) who did not
      have evidence of tardive dyskinesia at baseline. All of the subjects had a
      chronic disease course (mean greater than 10 years), and there were no
      significant between-treatment group differences in demographic or disease
      characteristics. The Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale and research diagnostic 
      criteria for tardive dyskinesia were used to define the comparative incidence
      rates of long-term treatment-emergent tardive dyskinesia. RESULTS: The incidence 
      of newly emergent tardive dyskinesia at any visit after baseline, at the final
      visit, and at the final two clinical assessments was statistically significantly 
      lower among olanzapine-treated patients than among haloperidol-treated patients. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These findings support an atypical extrapyramidal symptom profile
      and the potential of a significantly lower risk of tardive dyskinesia with
      olanzapine than with haloperidol among patients requiring maintenance
      antipsychotic treatment.

      exacerbation of schizophrenia: a comparison with haloperidol and placebo. The
      Seroquel Trial 13 Study Group.
PG  - 233-46
AB  - Five fixed doses of the atypical antipsychotic "Seroquel" (quetiapine) were
      evaluated to delineate a dose-response relationship, as measured by changes from 
      baseline in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Clinical Global Impression
      (CGI), and Modified Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) summary 
      scores, and to compare efficacy and tolerability opposite placebo and
      haloperidol. Three hundred sixty-one patients from 26 North American centers
      entered this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with acute exacerbation of
      chronic schizophrenia (DSM-III-R). Patients who completed a single-blind, placebo
      washout phase were randomized to double-blind treatment with quetiapine (75, 150,
      300, 600, or 750 mg daily), haloperidol (12 mg daily), or placebo and evaluated
      weekly for 6 weeks. At end point, significant differences (p < 0.05, analysis of 
      covariance) in adjusted mean changes from baseline were identified between the
      four highest doses of quetiapine and placebo for BPRS total, BPRS
      positive-symptom cluster, and CGI Severity of Illness item scores and between
      quetiapine 300 mg and placebo for SANS summary score. Differences between
      quetiapine and haloperidol were not significant. Dose-response modeling showed
      significant linear and quadratic functions of quetiapine dose for all primary
      efficacy variables. Notably, no significant safety concerns were identified as
      dose increased. Quetiapine was no different from placebo across the dose range
      studied regarding incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms or change in prolactin
      concentrations. Quetiapine is well tolerated and clinically effective in the
      treatment of schizophrenia. It is both superior to placebo and comparable to
      haloperidol in reducing positive symptoms at doses ranging from 150 to 750 mg/day
      and in reducing negative symptoms at a dose of 300 mg/day.

PG  - 287-95
AB  - Fifty-two children (ages 7 to 14 years) with moderate retardation to borderline
      intellectual functioning were recontacted 12 to 65 months following participation
      in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of methylphenidate (MPH). Sixty-nine 
      percent of subjects continued to be prescribed medication for behavior control at
      follow-up. While 72% of the sample evidenced improvement, over two-thirds
      continued to be rated at or above the 98th percentile on the Hyperactivity Index 
      of the Parent Conners. In fact, 22% of subjects had received inpatient
      psychiatric treatment between the time of the initial MPH trial and follow-up.
      Finally, subjects with high initial ratings on the Parent Conners Conduct
      Problems scale were more likely to be suspended from school or receive inpatient 
      psychiatric treatment than subjects with low initial ratings. The results
      suggested that children with ADHD and mental retardation of borderline
      intellectual functioning continued to exhibit significant symptoms associated
      with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) at follow-up and that early 
      conduct problems were predictive of continuing behavioral difficulties.

TI  - Oral clonidine premedication does not alter the efficacy of simulated intravenous
      test dose containing low dose epinephrine in awake volunteers.
PG  - 285-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clonidine premedication modifies the hemodynamic responses to
      sympathomimetics. The present study was designed to test whether clonidine
      altered the response to a small intravenous dose of epinephrine, such as that
      which might be used in an epidural test dose. METHODS: In 18 healthy volunteers, 
      four series of determinations were performed in random order and were separated
      by a minimum 72 h: (1) no premedication followed by intravenous saline 3 ml, (2) 
      no premedication followed by intravenous test dose containing 3 ml of 1.5%
      lidocaine + 15 microg epinephrine, (3) oral clonidine (5 microg/kg 1.5 h before
      hemodynamic determinations) followed by intravenous saline, and (4) oral
      clonidine followed by intravenous epinephrine-containing test dose. Systolic
      blood pressure (SBP) and heart rate (HR) were measured continuously, and symptoms
      associated with central nervous system toxicity were noted. RESULTS: After the
      test dose injections, HR and SBP increased with or without clonidine
      premedication. The 95% confidence intervals for the maximum HR increases with and
      without clonidine were 49-61 and 44-54 beats/min, respectively, indicating that
      one could not be absolutely certain that everyone would develop a positive HR
      response. The HR increase was > or = 20 beats/min in 18 of 18 volunteers given
      epinephrine with or without clonidine and in 0 of 18 volunteers given saline.
      Calculated sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative predictive
      values were all 100% based on the conventional HR criterion and were unaltered by
      clonidine. Subjective symptoms were not affected by clonidine. CONCLUSIONS: Oral 
      clonidine does not alter the efficacy of epinephrine-containing test doses used
      for detecting intravascular injection.

TI  - Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial of modafinil in the 
      treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy.
PG  - 444-51
AB  - Seventy-five patients meeting international diagnostic criteria for narcolepsy
      enrolled in a 6-week, three-period, randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled
      trial. Patients received placebo, modafinil 200 mg, or modafinil 400 mg in
      divided doses (morning and noon). Evaluations occurred at baseline and at the end
      of each 2-week period. Compared with placebo, modafinil 200 and 400 mg
      significantly increased the mean sleep latency on the Maintenance of Wakefulness 
      Test by 40% and 54%, with no significant difference between the two doses.
      Modafinil, 200 and 400 mg, also reduced the combined number of daytime sleep
      episodes and periods of severe sleepiness noted in sleep logs. The likelihood of 
      falling asleep as measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale was equally reduced by
      both modafinil dose levels. There were no effects on nocturnal sleep initiation, 
      maintenance, or architecture, nor were there any effects on sleep apnea or
      periodic leg movements. Neither dose interfered with the patients' ability to nap
      voluntarily during the day nor with their quantity or quality of nocturnal sleep.
      Modafinil produced no changes in blood pressure or heart rate in either
      normotensive or hypertensive patients. The only significant adverse effects were 
      seen at the 400-mg dose, which was associated with more nausea and more
      nervousness than either placebo or the 200-mg dose. As little as a 200-mg daily
      dose of modafinil is therefore an effective and well-tolerated treatment of
      excessive daytime somnolence in narcoleptic persons.

TI  - Hepatotoxicity of clozapine.
PG  - 314-7
AB  - Two hundred thirty-eight patients treated with either haloperidol or clozapine
      were investigated to shed more light on the incidence and severity of
      antipsychotic-induced liver enzyme increase. Serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase 
      (SGPT) increase was most frequently seen in both treatment groups. When analyzing
      the incidence rates for patients with increased liver enzyme values (serum
      glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, SGPT, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase) that were
      higher than twice the upper limit of the normal range, clozapine-treated patients
      showed an SGPT increase (37.3%) significantly more frequently than patients
      treated with haloperidol (16.6%). Both patients with higher clozapine plasma
      levels and male patients were at a higher risk for an SGPT increase. At least 60%
      of the increase of the different enzymes remitted within the first 13 weeks of
      treatment. In general, the authors conclude that clozapine-induced liver enzyme
      elevation seems to be a common and mostly transient phenomenon.

TI  - Economic and health state utility determinations for schizophrenic patients
      treated with risperidone or haloperidol.
PG  - 298-307
AB  - The current study uses utility analysis to assess economic and quality-of-life
      benefits of risperidone in patients with chronic schizophrenia. A retrospective
      analysis was performed on Positive and Negative Syndrome Symptoms (PANSS) data
      obtained from the published Canadian multicenter risperidone trial (part of the
      North American trial). Cluster analysis applied to endpoint PANSS scores,
      including all patients (N = 135), identified three clusters representing 130
      patients with mild, moderate, and severe symptomatology. A narrative health state
      profile was written for each cluster, and 100 psychiatric nurses from Washington,
      DC, were asked to assign preference ratings to each one using linear analog and
      standard gamble (SG) methods. Mean utility values (confidence interval 95%)
      obtained from the SG ratings for the three health state profiles were 0.61 +/-
      0.069 (mild); 0.36 +/- 0.073 (moderate); and 0.29 +/- 0.071 (severe). The mild
      health state (including the majority of risperidone 6 mg-treated patients) was
      rated by nurses to have a 0.25 +/- 0.0501 greater utility than the moderate
      health state (composed of the majority of haloperidol-treated patients). The
      results of these utility evaluations (SG) by the nurses were related to the
      clinical outcome for three of the six drug treatment groups (N = 65) by
      multiplying the percentage of patients in each of the three clusters, both at
      baseline and end-point, who were receiving risperidone 6 mg/day, haloperidol, or 
      placebo, by the utility value for the health state assigned to that cluster. The 
      gain in utility for risperidone-treated patients was 2.6 times higher (0.125)
      compared with haloperidol-treated patients (0.049), and 7 times higher compared
      with placebo (-0.021). After multiplying the gain in utility of each treatment by
      the remaining expected life span for men and women, it was found that
      risperidone-treated patients obtained more than twice as many quality-adjusted
      years as haloperidol patients. The incremental drug treatment cost divided by the
      incremental benefit of risperidone versus haloperidol was found to yield a
      favorable, generally accepted cost-utility ratio.

TI  - Comparison of fluoxetine, bupropion, and placebo in the treatment of premenstrual
      dysphoric disorder.
PG  - 261-6
AB  - Serotonergic antidepressants have been shown to be effective treatments for
      premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). The efficacy of nonserotonergic
      antidepressants is less well studied. This study was a two-center, parallel
      design, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of fluoxetine, bupropion, and
      placebo in women with PMDD. Thirty-four women with PMDD completed 1 month of
      single-blind placebo and 2 months of fluoxetine 20 mg/day (N = 10), bupropion 100
      mg three times daily (N = 12), or placebo (N = 12). Clinical Global Impressions
      (CGI) Scale, an expanded form of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression
      (HAM-D), and Global Assessment Scale (GAS) ratings were obtained premenstrually
      in each of the three treatment cycles. The three treatment groups differed
      significantly in efficacy by CGI ratings. Fluoxetine was superior to both
      bupropion and placebo. Comparison of posttreatment to pretreatment HAM and GAS
      scores demonstrated significant superior efficacy of fluoxetine compared with
      placebo. Posttreatment HAM and GAS scores for bupropion were intermediate between
      but not significantly different from fluoxetine or placebo. In summary,
      fluoxetine was significantly superior to bupropion and placebo as an effective
      treatment for PMDD. Although some improvement with bupropion was noted, and both 
      medications were well tolerated, patient satisfaction was far greater with
      fluoxetine.

TI  - The acute and long-term effect of olanzapine compared with placebo and
      haloperidol on serum prolactin concentrations.
PG  - 41-54
AB  - Prolactin elevation is both a common and a persistent event with the currently
      marketed antipsychotics, excluding clozapine. Elevations have been associated
      with both acute (galactorrhea, amenorrhea) and chronic (predisposition to
      osteoporosis) treatment-emergent adverse events. One of the defining criteria for
      an atypical antipsychotic is the relative lack of persistent prolactinemia. A
      double-blind, placebo- (N = 68) and haloperidol- (Hal: 15 +/- 5 mg/day, N = 69)
      controlled trial of three dose ranges of olanzapine (Olz-L: 5 +/- 2.5 mg/day, N =
      65; Olz-M: 10 +/- 2.5 mg/day, N = 64; Olz-H: 15 +/- 2.5 mg/day, N = 69) in the
      treatment of schizophrenia afforded the opportunity to assess the temporal course
      of the influence of olanzapine and haloperidol on serum prolactin concentration. 
      Consistent with its potent D2 antagonism, haloperidol was associated with a
      statistically significantly higher incidence of treatment-emergent prolactin
      elevation (72%) than seen with placebo (8%; p < 0.001) at week 2 of therapy.
      Expectedly, this elevation was also persistent at weeks 4 and 6. In contrast,
      olanzapine-associated treatment-emergent prolactin elevations were both lower in 
      magnitude and transient. At week 2, 38% of the Olz-H, 24% of the Olz-M, and 13%
      of the Olz-L treatment groups exhibited a treatment-emergent prolactin elevation,
      with a mean increase of 0.35, 0.52, and 0.61 nmol/l, respectively; for
      haloperidol the mean increase was 1.23 nmol/l. For only the Olz-M and the Olz-H
      treatment groups did the week 2 incidence of treatment-emergent prolactin
      elevations differ statistically significantly from placebo. Both the incidence of
      elevations and the mean increase, in prolactin concentration were less than that 
      seen with haloperidol. Furthermore, by treatment week 6, all three olanzapine
      groups exhibited incidences of treatment-emergent prolactin elevation that were
      comparable to placebo and were statistically significantly less than observed
      with haloperidol. Rapid adaptation was observed in the temporal course of
      prolactin elevations associated with olanzapine based on both the categorical
      analysis of treatment-emergent high values and the analyses of temporal change in
      mean concentrations. In contrast to haloperidol, the magnitudes of the
      treatment-emergent elevations associated with olanzapine were minimal. The rates 
      of elevation were approximately one-half to one-third those observed with
      haloperidol and were significantly more transient. Olanzapine, even at the
      highest doses (15 +/- 2.5 mg/day) used, was not associated with persistent
      elevations of prolactin, consistent with an 'atypical' pharmacologic profile.

TI  - Clozapine-induced electroencephalogram changes as a function of clozapine serum
      levels.
PG  - 132-7
AB  - Specific electroencephalogram (EEG) changes during clozapine therapy were
      prospectively studied in a cohort of 50 chronic state hospital patients with
      schizophrenia who were randomly assigned to one of three nonoverlapping clozapine
      serum level ranges (50-150 ng/mL, 200-300 ng/mL, and 350-450 ng/mL). EEGs were
      obtained before clozapine was instituted, and after 10 weeks of treatment.
      Fifty-three percent of patients showed EEG changes during the 10-week study
      period. We observed three seizures (6%), one in a patient on 900 mg (serum level 
      320 ng/mL) clozapine, and two in patients with lower clozapine serum levels
      (200-300 ng/mL) who had prior histories of seizures and inadequate valproate
      coverage. Thirteen percent of patients developed spikes with no relationship to
      dose or serum level of clozapine. Fifty-three percent of patients developed
      slowing on EEG. Compared to plasma levels below 300 ng/mL, a clozapine serum
      level between 350 and 450 ng/mL led to more frequent and more severe slowing. The
      EEG slowing correlated with observed sleepiness, although this factor was not
      sufficient to explain the severity of high-dose effects.

TI  - Pharmacological management of alcohol withdrawal. A meta-analysis and
      evidence-based practice guideline. American Society of Addiction Medicine Working
      Group on Pharmacological Management of Alcohol Withdrawal.
PG  - 144-51
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide an evidence-based practice guideline on the pharmacological
      management of alcohol withdrawal. DATA SOURCES: English-language articles
      published before July 1, 1995, identified through MEDLINE search on "substance
      withdrawal--ethyl alcohol" and review of references from identified articles.
      STUDY SELECTION: Articles with original data on human subjects. DATA ABSTRACTION:
      Structured review to determine study design, sample size, interventions used, and
      outcomes of withdrawal severity, delirium, seizures, completion of withdrawal,
      entry into rehabilitation, adverse effects, and costs. Data from prospective
      controlled trials with methodologically sound end points corresponding to the
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, were
      abstracted by 2 independent reviewers and underwent meta-analysis. DATA
      SYNTHESIS: Benzodiazepines reduce withdrawal severity, reduce incidence of
      delirium (-4.9 cases per 100 patients; 95% confidence interval, -9.0 to -0.7;
      P=.04), and reduce seizures (-7.7 seizures per 100 patients; 95% confidence
      interval, -12.0 to -3.5; P=.003). Individualizing therapy with withdrawal scales 
      results in administration of significantly less medication and shorter treatment 
      (P<.001). beta-Blockers, clonidine, and carbamazepine ameliorate withdrawal
      severity, but evidence is inadequate to determine their effect on delirium and
      seizures. Phenothiazines ameliorate withdrawal but are less effective than
      benzodiazepines in reducing delirium (P=.002) or seizures (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Benzodiazepines are suitable agents for alcohol withdrawal, with choice among
      different agents guided by duration of action, rapidity of onset, and cost.
      Dosage should be individualized, based on withdrawal severity measured by
      withdrawal scales, comorbid illness, and history of withdrawal seizures.
      beta-Blockers, clonidine, carbamazepine, and neuroleptics may be used as
      adjunctive therapy but are not recommended as monotherapy.

TI  - Sense of time in children with ADHD: effects of duration, distraction, and
      stimulant medication.
PG  - 359-69
AB  - A recent theory of ADHD predicts a deficiency in sense of time in the disorder.
      Two studies were conducted to test this prediction, and to evaluate the effects
      of interval duration, distraction, and stimulant medication on the reproductions 
      of temporal durations in children with ADHD. Study I: 12 ADHD children and 26
      controls (ages 6-14 years) were tested using a time reproduction task in which
      subjects had to reproduce intervals of 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 s. Four trials at
      each duration were presented with a distraction occurring on half of these
      trials. Control subjects were significantly more accurate than ADHD children at
      most durations and were unaffected by the distraction. ADHD children, in
      contrast, were significantly less accurate when distracted. Both groups became
      less accurate with increasing durations to be reproduced. Study II: Tested three 
      doses of methylphenidate (MPH) and placebo on the time reproductions of the 12
      ADHD children. ADHD children became less accurate with increasing durations and
      distraction was found to reduce accuracy at 36 s or less. No effects of MPH were 
      evident. The results of these preliminary studies seem to support the prediction 
      that sense of time is impaired in children with ADHD. The capacity to accurately 
      reproduce time intervals in ADHD children does not seem to improve with
      administration of stimulant medication.

TI  - Desmethylselegiline, a metabolite of selegiline, is an irreversible inhibitor of 
      monoamine oxidase type B in humans.
PG  - 602-9
AB  - Selegiline, an irreversible and selective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase type B
      (MAO-B), is metabolized into desmethylselegiline, levomethamphetamine, and
      levoamphetamine. In animal experiments, desmethylselegiline also has been shown
      to be an irreversible inhibitor of MAO-B. This study investigated the inhibitory 
      potential of MAO-B and the pharmacokinetics of desmethylselegiline in humans. A
      double-blind, crossover trial was performed to compare the effects of a single
      dose (10 mg) of selegiline or desmethylselegiline on MAO-B platelet activity. The
      urinary excretion of phenylethylamine, which is considered to be a parameter of
      MAO-B inhibition, also was measured. The concentrations of selegiline,
      desmethylselegiline, and their metabolites were measured in plasma after
      administration of the two compounds. Ten healthy volunteers participated in the
      study. There was a clear inhibition of platelet MAO-B by both compounds.
      Desmethylselegiline caused a 63.7 +/- 12.7% inhibition of platelet MAO-B compared
      with 96.4 +/- 3.9% caused by selegiline. The maximal inhibition by
      desmethylselegiline was reached significantly later after desmethylselegiline
      (time to reach maximal inhibition [tmax], 27 +/- 20 hours) than after selegiline 
      administration (tmax, 1.4 +/- 1.4 hours). The platelet MAO-B activity returned to
      baseline levels within 2 weeks, thus reflecting the irreversible nature of the
      inhibition by both compounds. The cumulative 48-hour excretion of
      phenylethylamine was 33% lower after desmethylselegiline than after selegiline
      administration. All three major metabolites of selegiline could be detected in
      plasma after selegiline administration. Levoamphetamine was the only metabolite
      of desmethylselegiline. The area under the concentration-time curve from time 0
      to 24 hours (AUC0-24) of desmethylselegiline was 33 times higher than that of
      selegiline, suggesting a better bioavailability of desmethylselegiline.
      Desmethylselegiline is an orally active, irreversible inhibitor of MAO-B and
      could possibly be used to treat Parkinson's disease in the same way as
      selegiline.

TI  - Effects of clonidine on prolonged postoperative sympathetic response.
PG  - 1147-52
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Surgical trauma results in diffuse sympathoadrenal activation which is
      thought to contribute to perioperative cardiovascular complications in high-risk 
      patients. Regional anesthetic and analgesic techniques can attenuate this "stress
      response" and reduce the occurrence rate of adverse perioperative events;
      however, their use in the postoperative period is logistically difficult and
      costly. The present study was undertaken to evaluate whether transdermal
      administration of the alpha2 adrenergic-receptor agonist, clonidine, can be used 
      as a pharmacologic means of blunting the stress response throughout the
      perioperative period. DESIGN: Double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 
      patients undergoing pancreatico-biliary surgery. SETTING: Operating rooms and
      surgical intensive care unit of a major university teaching hospital. PATIENTS:
      Forty patients scheduled for major upper abdominal surgery. INTERVENTIONS:
      Patients received either clonidine (0.2 mg orally and a clonidine TTS-3 patch the
      evening before surgery and 0.3 mg orally on call to the operating room) or
      matched oral and transdermal placebo. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Heart rate, 
      systemic arterial blood pressure, plasma catecholamine, clonidine, interleukin-6 
      concentrations, and 24-hr urine cortisol and nitrogen excretion were measured the
      day before surgery and daily thereafter for 72 hrs postoperatively. Preoperative 
      transdermal (and oral) clonidine administration resulted in therapeutic plasma
      clonidine concentrations throughout the perioperative period (1.54 +/- .07 [SEM] 
      microg/mL). Clonidine reduced preoperative epinephrine and norepinephrine
      concentrations by 65%. Plasma catecholamine concentrations increased in both
      groups following surgery but were markedly lower throughout the postoperative
      period in patients receiving clonidine. Patients receiving clonidine had a
      reduced frequency rate of postoperative hypertension. Clonidine had no effect on 
      plasma interleukin-6 concentration, urine cortisol excretion, or urine nitrogen
      excretion. No adverse effects of clonidine administration were observed.
      CONCLUSIONS: The combined administration of oral and transdermal clonidine
      effectively attenuated the catecholamine response to surgical stress throughout
      the postoperative study period. Clonidine administration produced specific
      sympatholytic effects, since other elements of the stress response were not
      attenuated. Undesirable side effects were not noted. The sustained sympatholytic 
      effects we observed suggest that alpha2 adrenergic-receptor agonists may offer a 
      pharmacologic means of modifying the sympathoadrenal response to injury, and may 
      be useful in reducing perioperative complications.

TI  - Effects of methylphenidate in children with attention deficit hyperactivity
      disorder: a comparison of event-related potentials between medication responders 
      and non-responders.
PG  - 9-14
AB  - Event-related potentials (ERPs) were compared among three groups, each with 13
      subjects: (1) ADHD non-responders to methylphenidate treatment; (2) ADHD
      responders to methylphenidate treatment; and (3) normal control children.
      Response to methylphenidate was determined through extensive psychoeducational
      and cognitive assessments during a 4-week double-blind medication assessment.
      ERPs were recorded each week from 13 active electrodes during a visual feature
      detection task and a semantic classification task. Significant group effects were
      found for N2 and P3b latencies due to longer latencies for the ADHD children. Off
      medication, there were no differences between responders and non-responders.
      However, on methylphenidate non-responders had significantly longer P3b latencies
      than responders. Cognitive testing also revealed differential performance on
      medication between non-responders and responders on the paired-associate learning
      (PAL) task. Thus, both cognitive and ERP measures were found to differentiate
      ADHD non-responders and responders to methylphenidate treatment.

TI  - Comparison of epidural butorphanol plus clonidine with butorphanol alone for
      postoperative pain relief.
PG  - 91-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidural butorphanol has been shown to produce effective analgesia
      with less side effects than that of morphine but relatively short duration.
      Clonidine, an alpha 2-adrenergic agonist, has been reported to provide
      [corrected] pain relief by epidural administration. Furthermore, epidural
      clonidine has been shown to potentiate the analgesic effect of epidural morphine.
      The present study was undertaken to evaluate the analgesic and side effects of
      epidural administration (Ep) of butorphanol and clonidine. METHODS: After giving 
      their consents, 60 adult patients scheduled for abdominal surgeries were enrolled
      in this study. Prior to anesthesia induction, indwelling lumbar epidural
      catheters were placed in all patients who then received general anesthesia with
      inhalation anesthetic without narcotic analgesics. In the postoperative period,
      when the patients first complained of pain, they were divided into 2 equal groups
      of 30 patients each in a randomized and double blinded fashion with Group I
      receiving Ep butorphanol 0.5 mg and Group II receiving Ep butorphanol 0.5 mg plus
      clonidine 75 micrograms. All patients were observed for pain relief, sedation,
      vital signs, arterial blood gas studies and adverse effects for 12 h. RESULTS:
      Onset of pain relief with epidural butorphanol began at 5 min and peaked at 20-30
      min with a duration of action lasting 4-6 h. The combination of butorphanol and
      clonidine had numerically superior pain relief than that of butorphanol for the
      first 30 min but it did not attain statistical significant difference. The
      duration of action with the combination group was similar to that of butorphanol 
      alone. Incidence of adverse effects were similar in both groups except that
      hypotension and more pronounced sedation were observed in Group II. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our study showed that the addition of clonidine to epidural butorphanol did not
      enhance its analgesic effect in any significant manner nor did it reduce the
      adverse effects. This combination does not seem to offer any advantage for
      clinical use.

TI  - Does oligoantigenic diet influence hyperactive/conduct-disordered children--a
      controlled trial.
PG  - 88-95
AB  - A crossover 'placebo'-controlled, double-blind design was used to examine the
      effectiveness of an oligoantigenic diet in 49 children with
      hyperactive/disruptive behavior disorder. Effects of diet were compared with
      those yielded by stimulant medication (methylphenidate). The study was conducted 
      in an inpatient unit at the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,
      Central Institute of Mental Health, Mannheim. Change in behavior was measured in 
      standardized situations by trained raters, including behavior assessment when
      testing with CPT and PAT, during a free play situation, and at school. Twelve
      children (24%) showed significant behavioral improvement in two behavior ratings 
      during diet relative to control diet conditions. Methylphenidate used in 36
      children yielded more responders (44%) than diet. The amount of positive changes 
      in behavior in those who received both treatments was about the same. Although
      only effective in a minority of children, dietary treatment cannot be neglected
      as a possible access to treating hyperactive/disruptive children and merits
      further investigation.

      10-week, open-label, multicenter trial. ARCS Study Group. Assessment of Risperdal
      in a Clinical Setting.
PG  - 239-47
AB  - The efficacy and safety of risperidone have previously been demonstrated in
      controlled clinical trials in hospitalized chronic schizophrenia patients who met
      strict research criteria. The present study was designed to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of risperidone in a heterogeneous patient population. Patients were
      enrolled in the study if they had a diagnosis of schizophrenia (DSM-III-R) with
      or without acute exacerbation. Of the 945 patients from 158 psychiatric centers
      who entered this phase IV study, 558 completed the 10-week trial. During week 1, 
      the dose of risperidone was titrated to 6 mg/day, maintained there for 1 week,
      and then adjusted over a 4-week period as clinically necessary; the dose was then
      fixed for the final 4-week period. The mean dose of risperidone at endpoint was
      5.9 mg/day. Patients were evaluated at baseline and at weeks 2, 6, and 10, using 
      Clinical Global Impression scale, Psychotic Symptoms Assessment scale, and Global
      Assessment of Functioning scale. Significant improvement in mean scores was found
      on each of these measures at endpoint. Comparable results were obtained at week
      10 in treatment-resistant and non-treatment-resistant patients. Risperidone was
      generally well tolerated and the severity of extrapyramidal symptoms was
      significantly reduced at endpoint.

TI  - Psychopharmacologic treatment of pathologic aggression.
PG  - 427-51
AB  - Several drugs are apparently effective in treating pathologic anger and
      aggression. Because many of the studies on aggressive populations allowed the use
      of concomitant medications, it is unclear whether the efficacy of each drug in a 
      particular population is dependent on the presence of other medications, such as 
      antipsychotic agents. Finally, one needs to be circumspect in inferring efficacy 
      of a particular drug in aggressive patients with neuropsychiatric conditions
      other than the ones in which some efficacy has been established. Lithium appears 
      to be an effective treatment of aggression among nonepileptic prison inmates,
      mentally retarded and handicapped patients, and among conduct-disordered children
      with explosive behavior. Certainly, lithium would be the treatment of choice in
      bipolar patients with excessive irritability and anger outbursts, and it has been
      shown to be effective in this population. Anticonvulsant medications are the
      treatment of choice for patients with outbursts of rage and abnormal EEG
      findings. The efficacy of these drugs in patients without a seizure disorder,
      however, remains to be established, with the exception perhaps of valproate and
      carbamazepine. In fact, dyphenylhydantoin did not appear to be effective in
      treating aggressive behavior in children with temper tantrums and was found to be
      effective in only a prison population. There is some evidence for the efficacy of
      carbamazepine and valproate in treating pathologic aggression in patients with
      dementia, organic brain syndrome, psychosis, and personality disorders. As
      Yudofsky et al point out in their review of the literature, although traditional 
      antipsychotic drugs have been used widely to treat aggression, there is little
      evidence for their effectiveness in treating aggression beyond their sedative
      effect in agitated patients or their antiaggressive effect among patients whose
      aggression is related to active psychosis. Antipsychotic agents appear to be
      effective in treating psychotic aggressive patients, conduct-disordered children,
      and mentally retarded patients, with only modest effects in the management of
      pathologic aggression in patients with dementia. Furthermore, at least in one
      study, these drugs were found to be associated with increased aggressiveness in
      mentally retarded subjects. On the other hand, atypical antipsychotic agents
      (i.e., clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine) may be more effective than
      traditional antipsychotic drugs in aggressive and violent populations, as they
      have shown efficacy in patients with dementia, brain injury, mental retardation, 
      and personality disorders. Similarly, benzodiazepines can reduce agitation and
      irritability in elderly and demented populations, but they also can induce
      behavioral disinhibition. Therefore, one should be careful in using this class of
      drugs in patients with pathologic aggression. Beta-blockers appear to be
      effective in many different neuropsychiatric conditions. These drugs seem
      effective in reducing violent and assaultive behavior in patients with dementia, 
      brain injury, schizophrenia, mental retardation, and organic brain syndrome. As
      pointed out by Campbell et al in their review of the literature, however,
      systematic research is lacking, and little is known about the efficacy and safety
      of beta-blockers in children and adolescents with pathologic aggression. Although
      widely used in the management of pathologic aggression, the use of this class of 
      drugs has been limited partially by marked hypotension and bradycardia, which are
      side effects common at the higher doses. The usefulness of the antihypertensive
      drug clonidine in the treatment of pathologic aggression has not been assessed
      adequately, and only marginal benefits were observed with this drug in irritable 
      autistic and conduct disorder children. Psychostimulants seem to be effective in 
      reducing aggressiveness in brain-injured patients as well as in violent
      adolescents with oppositional or conduct disorders, particu

TI  - Relationship of the antispasticity effect of tizanidine to plasma concentration
      in patients with multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 731-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spasticity is a serious problem in multiple sclerosis (MS) and many
      patients do not achieve a satisfactory response to currently available oral
      antispasticity drugs. Tizanidine hydrochloride, an alpha 2-noradrenergic agonist,
      has been shown to have an antispasticity effect in single center trials of
      patients with MS. OBJECTIVE: To compare plasma concentrations of tizanidine with 
      objective measures of muscle tone in patients with MS with moderate to severe
      spasticity. SETTING: Ten centers, all tertiary referral centers for the
      specialized treatment of patients with MS, in the United States and Canada.
      DESIGN: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-response study of
      tizanidine hydrochloride (8 or 16 mg). PATIENTS: One hundred forty-two patients
      with spastic MS who were not taking any interfering medication, such as an
      antispasticity drug or other alpha-noradrenergic agonist, entered the trial.
      RESULTS: Tizanidine treatment reduced muscle tone significantly, as shown by
      improved Ashworth scores and increased knee swing amplitude recorded by the
      pendulum test, both of which correlated significantly with plasma concentration. 
      Placebo had no significant effect on muscle tone. Dizziness, drowsiness, dry
      mouth, and fatigue were reported most often in the group treated with tizanidine 
      at peak plasma concentration. CONCLUSIONS: Tizanidine reduces spasticity in MS,
      and both therapeutic effects and side effects are related to the plasma drug
      levels.

TI  - Quetiapine in patients with schizophrenia. A high- and low-dose double-blind
      comparison with placebo. Seroquel Study Group.
PG  - 549-57
AB  - BACKGROUND: Quetiapine fumarate (Seroquel [ICI 204,636]) is an atypical
      dibenzothiazepine antipsychotic with a greater affinity for 5-hydroxytryptamine2 
      (5-HT2) receptors than for D2 dopamine receptors; its efficacy in patients with
      schizophrenia was shown in early phase 2 trials (maximum dose, 750 mg/d).
      METHODS: In this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 286
      patients hospitalized with chronic or subchronic schizophrenia (DSM-III-R) were
      randomized to 6 weeks of treatment with high-dose quetiapine fumarate (< or = 750
      mg/d), n = 96; low-dose quetiapine fumarate (< or = 250 mg/d), n = 94; or
      placebo, n = 96. The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and Clinical Global
      Impression Severity of Illness item scores were the primary efficacy variables.
      Secondary efficacy variables included the BPRS positive-symptom cluster score,
      the Modified Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms summary score (United 
      States only), and the total score from the negative scale of the Positive and
      Negative Syndrome Scale (Europe only). Scores were analyzed using an analysis of 
      covariance for change from baseline at end point with last observations carried
      forward. The model included baseline score (covariate), center, and treatment.
      Extrapyramidal symptoms were assessed using the Simpson-Angus Scale and the
      Barnes Akathisia Scale; abnormal involuntary movements were assessed using the
      Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale. Frequency distributions of grouped
      change-from-baseline scores were analyzed using chi 2 tests. RESULTS: Of 280
      patients in whom the efficacy of quetiapine was evaluated, 159 (42% of those
      receiving high-dose treatment; 57%, low-dose treatment; and 59%, placebo)
      withdrew before trial completion, primarily because of treatment failure.
      Significant (P < .001, BPRS; P = .003, Clinical Global Impression Severity of
      Illness item; and P = .003, BPRS positive-symptom cluster) differences were
      identified between patients receiving high-dose quetiapine and placebo for both
      primary efficacy variables, with end point differences in the BPRS
      positive-symptom cluster score showing quetiapine's consistency in reducing
      positive symptoms. The reduction of negative symptoms was less consistent;
      high-dose quetiapine was superior on the Modified Scale for the Assessment of
      Negative Symptoms but not on the negative scale of the Positive and Negative
      Syndrome Scale. Quetiapine was well tolerated and did not induce extrapyramidal
      symptoms, sustained elevations of prolactin, or clinically significant changes in
      hematologic parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Quetiapine is an effective antipsychotic
      with a favorable safety profile. The optimum dose is probably greater than 250
      mg/d.

      1-week washout period, received placebo, risperidone (2, 6, 10, or 16 mg/day), or
      haloperidol (20 mg/day) for 8 weeks; the trial was completed by 253 patients.
      Severity of EPS was assessed by means of the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale 
      (ESRS). Mean changes (increases) in ESRS scores from baseline to worst score were
      significantly lower in each risperidone group than the haloperidol group on the
      total ESRS (parkinsonism + dystonia + dyskinesia), total parkinsonism,
      hypokinetic symptoms, and on the questionnaire (p < 0.001). On several of the
      subscales (dyskinesia, buccolinguomasticatory, and Clinical Global Impression
      severity of dyskinesia), mean change scores were significantly lower in some of
      the risperidone groups than in the placebo group (p < 0.05). At the clinically
      most effective risperidone dose (6 mg/day), the mean ESRS change score was not
      significantly different from that of the placebo group. A significant linear
      relationship was noted between mean change scores and increasing risperidone dose
      on 4 of the 12 ESRS subscales; nevertheless, even at 16 mg/day of risperidone,
      mean change scores were lower than in the haloperidol group. A linear
      relationship between increasing risperidone dose and use of antiparkinsonian
      medications was also apparent. Acute dystonic reactions occurred both in patients
      receiving risperidone and haloperidol. Patients with severe baseline EPS were at 
      higher risk of EPS during the study than patients with low or moderate baseline
      EPS. It is concluded that low doses of risperidone cause few or no EPS and
      recommendations for initiation of risperidone treatment are made.

TI  - A double-blind comparative study of clozapine versus chlorpromazine on Chinese
      patients with treatment-refractory schizophrenia.
PG  - 123-30
AB  - Clozapine has been shown to have superior effectiveness compared with classic
      neuroleptics in treating refractory schizophrenia in Caucasians, but its efficacy
      and safety in Chinese have not been adequately studied. Forty Chinese
      schizophrenic patients were recruited in a 12-week, double-blind, comparative
      trial. Twenty-one patients were randomly assigned to clozapine treatment and 19
      to chlorpromazine treatment. The average dose was 543 +/- 157 and 1163 +/- 228
      mg/day for clozapine and chlorpromazine, respectively. The results showed that
      six clozapine-treated patients (28.6%) had more than 20% improvement in Brief
      Psychiatric Rating Scale score and were classified as responders, whereas none of
      the chlorpromazine-treated patients was classified as a responder. The degree of 
      improvement in positive symptoms, negative symptoms and Brief Psychiatric Rating 
      Scale scores in the clozapine group was inversely correlated with the severity of
      negative symptoms at entry into the trial. Two clozapine-treated patients were
      withdrawn from the study, one because of leukopenia and nausea, and the other
      because of vomiting and hypotension. Chlorpromazine treatment was prematurely
      discontinued in two patients, because of jaundice and over sedation in one, and
      because of severe weight loss in the other (9 kg). The rate of moderate-to-severe
      sialorrhea was high in clozapine-treated patients (28.6%). Two clozapine-treated 
      patients and two chlorpromazine-treated patients showed significant improvement
      in previously existing tardive dyskinesia and one chlorpromazine-treated patient 
      exhibited aggravation of tardive dyskinesia. The results of this study indicate
      that clozapine treatment might have advantages over chlorpromazine for Chinese
      schizophrenic patients who are refractory to typical neuroleptic treatment.

TI  - Extrapyramidal symptoms and tolerability of olanzapine versus haloperidol in the 
      acute treatment of schizophrenia.
PG  - 205-11
AB  - BACKGROUND: A relative lack of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS, i.e., the syndromes 
      of dystonia, parkinsonism, akathisia, dyskinesia) is one criterion used to
      determine whether an antipsychotic is "atypical." The extrapyramidal symptom
      profiles of the novel antipsychotic olanzapine and the conventional antipsychotic
      haloperidol were compared in a population of 2606 patients from three
      well-controlled prospective clinical trials. METHOD: Extrapyramidal symptom data 
      were analyzed for 1796 patients treated with olanzapine (5 to 20 mg/day) and 810 
      patients treated with haloperidol (5 to 20 mg/day) for up to 6 weeks of therapy. 
      Patients were monitored weekly by three methods of extrapyramidal symptom
      assessment: (1) detection of extrapyramidal adverse events (signs and symptoms)
      by casual observation, nonprobing inquiry, and spontaneous report; (2) objective 
      rating scale scores: and (3) use of concomitant anticholinergic medications.
      Emergence of EPS was assessed by (1) analysis of the incidence of extrapyramidal 
      syndrome categories based on adverse events, (2) the incidence of extrapyramidal 
      syndromes based on categorical analysis of rating scale scores, (3) analysis of
      mean maximum change in rating scale scores, and (4) categorical analysis of
      anticholinergic medication use. Outcome of EPS was assessed by (1) analysis of
      mean change in rating scale scores at endpoint and (2) mean anticholinergic use
      at endpoint. RESULTS: Olanzapine was statistically significantly (p = .014, p <
      .001) superior to haloperidol in all four analyses related to emergence of EPS
      and in the two analyses related to outcome. Furthermore, during acute treatment, 
      statistically significantly fewer patients treated with olanzapine (0.3%)
      discontinued the study because of any extrapyramidal adverse event than patients 
      treated with haloperidol (2.7%, p < .001). CONCLUSION: Olanzapine exhibited a
      statistically significantly lower extrapyramidal symptom profile than the
      conventional antipsychotic haloperidol at comparably effective antipsychotic
      doses. The lower extrapyramidal symptom profile with olanzapine was evident
      despite statistically significantly more frequent use of anticholinergic drugs
      among haloperidol-treated patients. Fewer olanzapine-treated than
      haloperidol-treated patients discontinued because of EPS, suggesting that
      olanzapine should contribute to better compliance with longer term maintenance
      treatment, with minimal anticholinergic-associated events.

TI  - Olanzapine versus haloperidol: acute phase results of the international
      double-blind olanzapine trial.
PG  - 125-37
AB  - A 6-week acute phase of an international 1-year double-blind study was conducted 
      comparing three dose ranges of olanzapine (5 +/- 2.5 mg/day, 10 +/- 2.5 mg/day,
      and 15 +/- 2.5 mg/day) with a fixed dose of olanzapine (1.0 mg/day) and with a
      dose range of haloperidol (15 +/- 5 mg/day) in the treatment of 431 patients with
      schizophrenia. The purpose was to determine whether olanzapine demonstrated a
      dose-related ability to decrease overall psychopathology with minimal associated 
      extrapyramidal symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. The high-dose olanzapine 
      group showed statistically significantly greater improvement in overall
      psychopathology based on mean change in the CGI Severity score and statistically 
      significantly greater improvement in positive psychotic symptoms based on mean
      change in both the BPRS positive score and the PANSS positive score compared with
      the 1.0-mg/day olanzapine group. Analyses indicated that an increasing
      dose-response curve was observed across the range of all olanzapine dose groups. 
      Acute extrapyramidal syndromes were reported less frequently among all olanzapine
      groups compared with the haloperidol group. Endpoint mean change on both the
      Simpson-Angus Scale and the Barnes Akathisia Scale reflected improvement for all 
      olanzapine treatment groups compared with worsening for the haloperidol group.
      Olanzapine was associated with weight gain but did not appear to have any
      clinically meaningful effect on vital signs. Although olanzapine was associated
      with some increase in prolactin concentrations, increases were transient,
      occurred less often, and were of lesser magnitude than those observed with
      haloperidol.

TI  - Risperidone: effects of formulations on oral bioavailability.
PG  - 599-605
AB  - The bioavailability of risperidone was evaluated in an open-label, randomized,
      two-way, crossover study comparing a 1-mg tablet with a 1-mg/ml oral solution.
      Both formulations were administered as a single 1-mg dose with a 10-day washout
      period between treatments. Of 26 healthy men who entered the study, 23 completed 
      both treatment periods. Plasma concentrations of risperidone and the active
      moiety (risperidone plus its active metabolite, 9-hydroxyrisperidone) were
      determined by radioimmunoassays. For key pharmacokinetic values (Cmax, AUC), the 
      90% CIs on the relative bioequivalence of risperidone, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, and 
      the active moiety were contained within the equivalence range of 80-120% (80-125%
      for log-transformed data). The results demonstrate that the 1-mg/ml oral solution
      and the 1-mg tablet are bioequivalent.

TI  - Benztropine versus clozapine for the treatment of tremor in Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 1077-81
AB  - Four open-label studies have reported beneficial effects of clozapine on the
      tremor of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). We performed a double-blind
      crossover trial with a 2-week washout, comparing low-dose clozapine to
      benztropine for the treatment of tremor in PD. Twenty-two subjects enrolled and
      19 completed the study. Benztropine and clozapine were equally effective in
      improving tremor and the motor score of the United Parkinson's Disease Rating
      Scale at mean doses of 3.0 and 39 mg/day, respectively. Significant adverse
      events were experienced with each drug, but leukopenia was not encountered. We
      conclude that the atypical antipsychotic drug clozapine is helpful in the
      treatment of tremor in PD and should be considered when all other drug therapies 
      fail.

TI  - Olanzapine versus haloperidol in the treatment of schizophrenia and

      collaborative trial.
PG  - 457-65
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This international, multicenter double-blind trial was designed to
      compare the therapeutic profile of an atypical antipsychotic, olanzapine, with
      that of a conventional dopamine D2 antagonist, haloperidol. METHOD: A total of
      1,996 patients at 174 sites in Europe and North America were randomly assigned to
      treatment with olanzapine (N = 1,336) or haloperidol (N = 660) over 6 weeks. The 
      primary efficacy analysis involved the mean change from baseline to endpoint in
      total scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Secondary analyses
      included comparisons of the mean change in positive and negative symptoms,
      comorbid depression, extrapyramidal symptoms, and overall drug safety. RESULTS:
      Olanzapine demonstrated clinical results superior to those of haloperidol on
      overall improvement according to the BPRS and on every secondary measure,
      including depression. Olanzapine was also associated with significantly fewer
      discontinuations of treatment due to lack of drug efficacy or adverse events.
      Substantially more olanzapine-treated patients (66.5%) than haloperidol-treated
      patients (46.8%) completed 6 weeks of therapy. Statistically significant
      advantages of olanzapine treatment were related to 1) change in negative
      symptoms, 2) extrapyramidal symptom profile, 3) effect on prolactin levels, and
      4) response rate. CONCLUSIONS: Olanzapine shows a superior and broader spectrum
      of efficacy in the treatment of schizophrenic psychopathology, with a
      substantially more favorable safety profile, than haloperidol. It meets several
      of the criteria for a novel atypical antipsychotic agent.

TI  - Effects of methylphenidate on event-related potentials and performance of
      attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder children in auditory and visual
      selective attention tasks.
PG  - 690-702
AB  - Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) children participated in a
      double-blind placebo-controlled study in which the effects of a dosage of 15 mg
      methylphenidate (MPH) on auditory and visual selective attention tasks was
      determined by presenting frequent (90%) and infrequent (10%) stimuli in both
      relevant and irrelevant input channels. The subject's task was to respond to the 
      infrequent tones in the relevant input channel. Processing activity (negativity
      and positivity) was assessed for both tasks. N1, P2, N2, and P3b peaks were
      scored in the auditory task and N1, P1, N2, P2, P3(1), and P3b peaks were scored 
      in the visual task. Effects of MPH were more prevalent in the visual than in the 
      auditory condition. In the visual condition MPH enhanced the percentage of hits, 
      caused higher central, parietal, and occipital P3b amplitudes to attended stimuli
      (both standards and deviants), and also enhanced the frontal processing
      negativity (PN). In the auditory task MPH did not influence performance, but it
      enhanced the frontal PN as well as the parietal and occipital P3b amplitudes to
      all stimulus types. In ADHD children, MPH ameliorates some, but not all, deficits
      and also improves processing where no differences with normal children are
      present.

TI  - Diltiazem, a calcium antagonist, partly attenuates the effects of
      dextroamphetamine in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 113-20
AB  - Calcium antagonists have previously been shown to be effective in the treatment
      of mania. In the present study we used dextroamphetamine administered to humans
      as a model of mania, to determine whether the calcium antagonist diltiazem would 
      prevent dextroamphetamine-induced changes. This may help determine whether
      diltiazem is likely to be useful in the treatment of mania. Ten healthy
      volunteers were enrolled in this double-blind, placebo-controlled, balanced
      crossover study. Subjects received either oral diltiazem (60 mg) and placebo,
      placebo and dextroamphetamine (20 mg), diltiazem and dextroamphetamine, or
      placebo alone. Subjective and sleep changes were measured using visual analogue
      scales. Attentiveness and visual reaction times were measured repeatedly as were 
      diastolic and systolic blood pressure. The results showed that dextroamphetamine 
      alone produced a number of subjective changes, cardiovascular changes and changes
      in reaction time. Diltiazem significantly attenuated the cardiovascular changes, 
      but not the subjective or reaction time changes. It is hypothesized that these
      findings may represent effects of diltiazem on noradrenergic neurotransmission.
      The results are tentatively supportive of suggestions that diltiazem may be
      clinically useful in the treatment of mania, as is another calcium channel
      antagonist, verapamil.

TI  - Response to clozapine in acute mania is more rapid than that of chlorpromazine.
PG  - 109-12
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to compare the efficacy of clozapine with
      that of chlorpromazine in an open label manner (both given in association with
      lithium salts) in the treatment of acute mania. Thirty hospitalized manic
      patients were entered into the study. All patients met DSM-IV criteria for
      bipolar disorder, Manic Episode; 27 patients completed the study and three
      patients dropped for noncompliance. The duration of the study was 3 weeks.
      Patients were randomly assigned to two treatment groups; group 1 (n = 15) was
      treated with clozapine at a mean dose of 166 mg/day and group 2 (n = 12) was
      treated with chlorpromazine at a mean dose of 310 mg/day. Manic symptomatology
      was rated on Young Rating Scale for Mania (YRSM) each week; side effects were
      recorded on dosage records and treatment emergent symptoms; extrapyramidal acute 
      side effects were rated on the Simpson-Angus Rating Scale performed at the
      beginning of the study and after 3 weeks of treatment. A two-way repeated
      measures analysis of variance on YRMS scores showed a significant time effect (p 
      < 0.0001) and a significant time-group interaction (p < 0.0001). Post-hoc
      comparison between the two groups showed a significant difference after 2 weeks
      of treatment (p = 0.0001), with clozapine treated patients showing lower YRSM
      scores than chlorpromazine treated patients. YRSM scores at the end of the study 
      were not significantly different. Patients treated with clozapine showed a more
      rapid trend toward amelioration. No clinically relevant side effect was observed 
      during the study.

TI  - Adverse effects of risperidone on eye movement activity: a comparison of
      risperidone and haloperidol in antipsychotic-naive schizophrenic patients.
PG  - 217-28
AB  - Risperidone is a novel and clinically effective atypical antipsychotic medication
      with a unique biochemical profile. To contrast the neurophysiological effects of 
      this new medication with those of a typical antipsychotic medication, we
      performed quantitative measurements of saccadic eye movements in a series of
      antipsychotic-naive schizophrenic patients treated with either risperidone or
      haloperidol. Patients were tested before and after 1 month of treatment, and a
      matched group of healthy subjects was tested twice over a similar time interval. 
      Risperidone, but not haloperidol, was associated with prolonged latency and
      decreased peak velocity and accuracy of saccadic eye movements that was
      detectable 4 weeks after treatment initiation. The adverse effects of risperidone
      may be due to the lack of development of acute tolerance to its powerful
      serotonergic (5-HT2A) antagonism, which could be responsible for the disruption
      of brainstem physiology in regions controlling saccadic eye movements.

TI  - Clozapine and associated diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 108-11
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clozapine is an effective therapy for the treatment of refractory
      psychosis. Clozapine-associated adverse effects include sedation, weight gain,
      sialorrhea, palpitations, seizures, and hematologic changes such as
      agranulocytosis. METHOD: We present a four-case series in which clozapine use was
      associated with either a de novo onset or severe exacerbation of preexisting
      diabetes mellitus. RESULTS: The change in glycemic control was not significantly 
      related to weight gain. Three of the patients have been able to continue on
      clozapine therapy and have experienced a reduction in psychotic symptoms.
      CONCLUSION: Patients with a family history of diabetes mellitus or with
      preexisting diabetes mellitus may need to have blood sugar monitored closely
      during initiation of clozapine treatment.

TI  - Cardiovascular and metabolic responses to clonidine and midazolam premedication.
PG  - 190-6
AB  - In this double-blind placebo controlled study the preoperative cardiovascular and
      metabolic effects of intramuscular (i.m.) clonidine and midazolam are assessed.
      Forty-five ASA Grade I patients (n = 15 per group) undergoing plastic surgical
      procedures were randomly allocated to receive either placebo, clonidine 4
      micrograms kg-1 or midazolam 70 micrograms kg-1. Drugs were administered into the
      deltoid muscle approximately 90 min prior to the scheduled induction of
      anaesthesia. The metabolic measurements were performed using an indirect
      calorimetry device. Heart rate and blood pressure were measured noninvasively.
      Pre-operative subjective anxiety, dryness of mouth and tiredness were assessed
      using visual analogue scales (VAS). Clonidine increased subjective tiredness
      significantly more than placebo. Clonidine also induced moderate decreases in
      blood pressure and heart rate. Oxygen consumption (VO2), CO2 production and
      energy expenditure (EE) decreased significantly after clonidine and midazolam.
      The decrease in VO2 and EE was maximally 11-14% on average from the base-lines
      after clonidine and midazolam. These effects were of longer duration after
      clonidine and lasted until the end of the 90 min study period. In conclusion,
      both clonidine and midazolam are effective as a means of decreasing pre-operative
      VO2 and EE.

PG  - 521-34
AB  - A double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of methylphenidate (0.4
      mg/kgday) and different doses of fenfluramine (1.0, 1.5, or 2.0 mg/g/day) in
      children with mental retardation or borderline IQ and ADHD was conducted.
      Parents, teachers, examiners, and physicians rated the children. There were
      relatively few significant drug effects by condition. When the optimal
      fenfluramine dose for each child was compared with placebo and methylphenidate,
      significant improvements occurred for fenfluramine on several parent and teacher 
      subscales; teachers rated the children as somewhat improved with methylphenidate.
      The highest dose of fenfluramine produced more behavior compliance but apparently
      at the cost of cognitive efficiency. Most side effects (drowsiness, dizziness,
      anorexia) occurred with fenfluramine. Both drugs appear to be effective
      treatments for children with ADHD and mental retardation, although there is a
      possible neurotoxic action with fenfluramine. We recommend a gradual phase-in of 
      fenfluramine dosage, up to 1.5 mg/kg/day, for most children.

TI  - Effects of intravenous and oral clonidine on hemodynamic and plasma-catecholamine
      response due to endotracheal intubation.
PG  - 143-7
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of intravenous (IV) versus oral
      clonidine on alterations of heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP),
      cardiac output (CO), and plasma-catecholamines due to endotracheal intubation.
      DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. SETTING: University
      hospital surgery operating room. PATIENTS: 33 ASA physical status I patients were
      randomly assigned to either receive clonidine 3 micrograms/kg IV immediately
      prior to anesthesia induction, clonidine 4 micrograms/kg orally 90 minutes prior 
      to anesthesia induction, or placebo. INTERVENTIONS: Insertion of a 14 G cannula
      in a large cubital vein for the determination of plasma-catecholamines using
      local anesthesia. Insertion of a radial artery catheter for measuring blood
      pressure (BP) using local anesthesia. Transthoracic echocardiography determined
      CO. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Heart rate, MAP, CO, and plasma-catecholamine 
      concentrations were measured. Measurements were performed prior to induction,
      during intubation, and 10 minutes after intubation. During endotracheal
      intubation, MAP was significantly lower in the IV clonidine group compared with
      the placebo and the oral clonidine groups. Cardiac output was significantly lower
      in the IV clonidine group only. In contrast to the placebo group, norepinephrine 
      plasma concentrations did not increase in either clonidine group. Significant
      alterations of epinephrine plasma concentrations due to intubation were not
      observed in either group. Hemodynamics after intubation were not impaired by
      clonidine treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, IV clonidine reduced stress
      response to endotracheal intubation compared with placebo. Oral clonidine at the 
      dose used was less effective in blunting hemodynamic stress response than IV
      clonidine.

TI  - Clonidine at induction reduces shivering after general anaesthesia.
PG  - 263-7
AB  - PURPOSE: Postanaesthetic shivering occurs in 5-65% of patients. In addition to
      causing discomfort, it is associated with deleterious consequences. Our objective
      was to investigate the effect of 150 micrograms clonidine, at induction of
      anaesthesia, on perioperative core and peripheral temperature, incidence of
      postanaesthetic shivering and patients' perception of cold. METHODS: Sixty ASA 1 
      or 2 patients scheduled for elective orthopaedic limb surgery were randomly
      allocated to group 1, who received 150 micrograms clonidine iv, or group 2, who
      received a saline bolus iv, before induction. In all patients, anaesthesia was
      induced with fentanyl and propofol and maintained by spontaneous respiration (via
      a laryngeal mask airway) of oxygen, nitrous oxide and enflurane. Core
      (nasopharyngeal) and peripheral (dorsal hand) temperatures were recorded at
      induction and 15-min intervals. Nurses, unaware of the treatment groups, recorded
      visible shivering in the recovery room. When cognitive function returned,
      patients were asked to grade their perception of cold on a 10 cm linear analogue 
      scale, higher scores indicating heat discomfort. RESULTS: While core temperature 
      decreased and peripheral temperature increased in both groups, there was no
      difference between the groups at any time. However, there was a lower incidence
      of shivering in the clonidine group (20% vs 66.7%, P < 0.001). Patients receiving
      clonidine felt warmer; thermal comfort score (median interquartile range) 5.9
      (5.0-7.2) vs 5.0 (4.5-6.0), P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Clonidine 150 g iv at
      induction of anaesthesia reduces the incidence of shivering and patients'
      subjective perception of cold on emergence from general anaesthesia.

TI  - Late intraoperative clonidine administration prevents postanesthetic shivering
      after total intravenous or volatile anesthesia.
PG  - 613-7
AB  - Postoperative administration of clonidine is an effective treatment for
      shivering. However, the ability of this drug to stop postanesthetic shivering
      when administered intraoperatively remains controversial. Furthermore, the
      relative efficacy of clonidine during isoflurane and propofol anesthesia remains 
      unknown. We therefore evaluated the incidence of postanesthetic shivering in
      patients given clonidine during nitrous oxide/isoflurane or propofol anesthesia. 
      Because clonidine is an analgesic, we also evaluated postoperative pain and
      analgesic requirements. We studied 60 patients undergoing elective ear or nose
      surgery. General anesthesia was induced with 2.0 mg/kg propofol, 1.5
      micrograms/kg fentanyl, and 0.1 mg/kg vecuronium. General anesthesia was
      maintained with isoflurane and 70% nitrous oxide in one group of patients; in the
      other, a continuous infusion of propofol (8 mg.kg-1.h-1) was administered
      (without nitrous oxide). Five minutes before tracheal extubation, patients in
      each group were randomly assigned to receive saline, placebo, or 3 micrograms/kg 
      clonidine intravenously. Postanesthetic shivering was evaluated by a blind
      investigator. Postoperative pain was assessed using a visual analog scale.
      Postoperative shivering was observed in 53% of the patients given isoflurane
      without clonidine and in 13% of the patients given propofol without clonidine. No
      patient given clonidine shivered. Clonidine administration significantly reduced 
      postoperative pain. The incidence of postanesthetic shivering was significantly
      less after propofol anesthesia than after isoflurane/nitrous oxide anesthesia.
      However, a late intraoperative bolus administration of 3 micrograms/kg clonidine 
      prevents postoperative shivering in patients given either type of anesthesia.

TI  - Perioperative sympatholysis. Beneficial effects of the alpha 2-adrenoceptor
      agonist mivazerol on hemodynamic stability and myocardial ischemia. McSPI--Europe
      Research Group.
PG  - 346-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mivazerol hydrochloride is a new alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist. In
      vitro and animal studies have demonstrated both sympatholytic and antiischemic
      properties. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of mivazerol in patients during
      perioperative stress, this multicenter phase II clinical trial studied
      hemodynamic stability and myocardial ischemia in patients with coronary artery
      disease undergoing noncardiac surgery. METHODS: Three hundred patients, from
      twenty-three European medical institutions, participated in this
      placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group trial. Ninety-eight 
      were given high-dose mivazerol (1.5 micrograms.kg-1.h-1); 99, low-dose mivazerol 
      (0.75 microgram.kg-1.h-1); and 103, placebo, continuously intraoperatively and
      for 72 h postoperatively. Blood pressure and heart rate were monitored for 96 h. 
      Myocardial ischemia was assessed by Holter electrocardiography for at least 8 h
      before induction of anesthesia until 96 h after surgery. Twelve-lead
      electrocardiograms and creatine kinase myocardial band isoenzyme levels were
      obtained before and serially after surgery. Adverse cardiac events were assessed 
      for the intraoperative, early postoperative (0-24 h), and late postoperative
      (24-72 h) periods. RESULTS: The incidence of tachycardia was significantly lower 
      with high-dose mivazerol (vs. placebo) during the intraoperative (30% vs. 51%; P 
      = 0.002), early postoperative (29% vs. 50%; P = 0.002), and late postoperative
      periods (46% vs. 70%; P = 0.001). Also, the percentage of patients treated for
      tachycardia was significantly lower with the high dose (vs. placebo) during the
      early (10% vs. 20%; P = 0.043) and late (6% vs. 15%; P = 0.024) postoperative
      periods. The incidence of hypertension was significantly lower with both high and
      low doses (vs. placebo) during the intraoperative period (46% and 43%,
      respectively, vs. 63%; P = 0.010); treatment was similar at both high and low
      doses (33% and 34%, respectively, vs. 46%; P = 0.066). The incidence of
      bradycardia was significantly higher at both dose levels than with placebo during
      and after drug administration (intraoperatively-3%, 7%, and 9%; early
      postoperative-0%, 5%, and 6%; late postoperative-0%, 4%, and 6%; after drug-0%,
      6%, and 6%; placebo, low-dose, high-dose, respectively), but the need for
      treatment did not differ for the groups. The incidence of, and treatment for,
      hypotension were similar for the three groups. Intraoperative myocardial ischemia
      was significantly lower with high-dose mivazerol than with placebo (20% vs. 34%, 
      respectively, P = 0.026). When intraoperative data were subdivided into emergence
      vs. nonemergence periods (post boc analysis), the incidence of myocardial
      ischemia was significantly lower with high-dose mivazerol than with placebo
      during emergence (11% vs. 30%; P = 0.001). Regarding blood pressure, heart rate, 
      and ischemia, no rebound response occurred in the 12 h after discontinuation of
      mivazerol. The high-dose, low-dose, and placebo groups did not differ in the
      incidence of adverse cardiac outcomes (3%, 2%, and 8%, respectively) or the
      diagnosis of myocardial infarction (2%, 1%, and 6%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS:
      Continuous, 72-h perioperative administration of mivazerol to high-risk patients 
      appears to be relatively safe, producing no significant hypotension or adverse
      events but some evidence of bradycardia not associated with adverse clinical
      events. Mivazerol decreased the incidence of, and treatment for, tachycardia,
      hypertension, and myocardial ischemia, particularly during high stress periods.
      Therefore, these salutary effects of mivazerol indicate further study in
      large-scale trials that assess mivazerol's effects on adverse cardiac outcomes,
      including death and myocardial infarction.

PG  - 213-20
AB  - The management of agitation after brain injury remains uncertain because of a
      lack of a consistent definition and a poor understanding of the underlying
      mechanism. Part 1 of this review focused on definitions, differential diagnosis, 
      and assessment. Part 2 reviews potential mechanisms for posttraumatic agitation
      and common intervention strategies. The intent of this two-part series is to
      advocate for a consistent definition for posttraumatic agitation, to encourage
      the use of appropriate assessment and monitoring strategies, and to recommend
      that intervention decisions are based on at least a theoretical understanding of 
      the relationship between specific target behaviors and probable brain-behavior
      relationships.

TI  - Covert visual spatial attention in boys with attention deficit hyperactivity
      disorder: lateral effects, methylphenidate response and results for parents.
PG  - 165-76
AB  - We report three related studies of covert visual spatial orienting in child
      attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In Study 1, we examined covert
      visual spatial orienting in ADHD and comparison boys, Study 2 comprised a
      dose-response study of methylphenidate for the ADHD group, and Study 3 was an
      investigation of biological and adoptive parents. In contrast with comparison
      subjects (n = 17). ADHD boys aged 6-12 (n = 27) showed both slower reaction times
      overall and within-condition (lateral) asymmetries in reaction times.
      Specifically, boys with ADHD reacted more slowly to uncued targets in the left
      visual field than in the right visual field. Responses to stimuli in the two
      visual fields were differentially affected by methylphenidate for the ADHD group.
      Medication equalized visual field responses to the uncued targets, resulting in a
      significant cue x dose x visual field interaction. Further, medication altered
      the relative cue responsivity in the two visual fields, resulting in a
      significant dose x visual field interaction for the Validity Effect. Biological
      parents of ADHD boys (n = 16) also showed slower reaction times to uncued left
      visual field targets than to right visual field targets; in addition they showed 
      slower response to invalidity cued targets in the right visual field. These
      literal effects were not observed in adoptive parents of ADHD boys (n = 12) or
      biological parents of comparison boys (n = 14). Possible abnormal hemispheric
      asymmetry of attention functions in boys with ADHD and their biological parents
      is discussed.

      24.9 +/- 8.8 years) who received 300 mg or 600 mg of clozapine and randomized in 
      a double-blind fashion were analyzed. Subjects were evaluated using the Brief
      Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Scale on
      a weekly basis for 16 weeks. Based on the changes in their CGI scores at week 16 
      of clozapine treatment, subjects were retrospectively categorized as "improvers" 
      (N = 12) and "nonimprovers" (N = 18). The two groups were compared for changes in
      total BPRS and BPRS factor scores. In terms of total BPRS scores, we expected a
      difference between the two groups because they were categorized based on changes 
      in their CGI scores. However, the total BPRS scores in improvers showed a
      significant decrease by week 6 of clozapine treatment. On analyzing the four BPRS
      factors, the improvers showed improvement in the thinking disturbance factor by
      week 1 that remained steady from week 7. On the hostility-suspiciousness factor, 
      the improvers showed an improvement across time when compared with nonimprovers. 
      The withdrawal-retardation factor showed improvement in both groups across time, 
      whereas the anxiety-depression factor was least influenced by clozapine. These
      observations suggested that all BPRS symptom factors did not uniformly contribute
      to improvement in overall psychopathology, which was observed as a decrease in
      total BPRS scores.

TI  - Alpha 2-agonist versus alpha 1-antagonist in mild-to-moderate hypertension:
      comparison of transdermal clonidine and terazosin monotherapies.
PG  - 9-15
AB  - A double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group trial that used a predominantly
      Hispanic patient population with mild-to-moderate hypertension was designed to
      compare the efficacy, safety, and acceptability of monotherapy with either
      transdermal clonidine applied once a week or terazosin tablets taken once a day. 
      Of 44 patients admitted, 20 of 22 in the transdermal clonidine group and 15 of 21
      in the terazosin group (one patient was lost to follow-up) met the response
      criteria. These criteria included the completion of 1 full week of therapy with
      the smallest dose that resulted in a seated diastolic blood pressure of <90 mm Hg
      and the subsequent entrance into an 8-week maintenance therapy phase. At the end 
      of the 8-week maintenance phase the mean seated diastolic blood pressure remained
      <90 mm Hg in the clonidine cohort but not in the terazosin cohort, yet the
      difference was not statistically significant. There was a significantly better
      response to clonidine when all patients who received treatment were considered.
      No adverse first-dose effects were experienced with terazosin. One patient who
      received transdermal clonidine developed contact dermatitis and withdrew from the
      study prematurely. The most common side effects associated with clonidine were
      dry mouth and fatigue while those associated with terazosin were headache and
      fatigue. Compliance was excellent in both groups. Seventy-nine percent of
      patients found transdermal clonidine preferable to the oral regimen.

TI  - Blood biogenic amines during clozapine treatment of early-onset schizophrenia.
PG  - 1077-89
AB  - The aims of this investigation were to evaluate long-term and short-term effects 
      of clozapine-treatment on plasma biogenic amines and psychopathology measures in 
      adolescents with schizophrenia (DSM-III-R criteria). The long-term study was
      conducted in a study sample of 40 young patients (age 14-22 years) following a
      mean of 3.4 years of neuroleptic treatment. During the study, 20 patients
      received clozapine, and the other 20 patients were treated with standard
      neuroleptic medications. At the beginning of the open clinical trials, the
      patients had already been receiving clozapine treatment for 24 +/- 15 months.
      Assessment of the biochemical and psychopathological measures was performed on
      six occasions at consecutive 6-week intervals during maintenance treatment with
      clozapine or conventional neuroleptics. Blood levels of serotonin,
      3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-phenylglycol (MHPG), norepinephrine, and epinephrine were
      significantly higher in clozapine-treated patients than in conventionally treated
      patients. During long-term treatment, higher serotonin levels were associated
      with significantly fewer negative symptoms of schizophrenia, whereas higher MHPG 
      levels were correlated with less depression. The short-term effects of clozapine 
      were assessed in a second and independent study sample. After failing on
      conventional neuroleptics in clinical trials lasting a mean of 1.6 years, 15
      inpatients (aged 11-20 years) received clozapine. Weekly ratings of
      psychopathological symptoms using standard rating scales were performed in
      parallel to blood samplings for measurements of biogenic amines and serum levels 
      of clozapine. These measures were obtained for 6 weeks during conventional
      neuroleptic treatment and for 6 weeks during the open-label clozapine trial.
      Serum levels of serotonin and plasma norepinephrine levels were significantly
      higher during treatment with clozapine than during pretreatment with typical
      neuroleptics. A comparison of plasma epinephrine levels in responders (n = 7) and
      nonresponders (n = 8) to clozapine revealed that response to clozapine can be
      predicted by epinephrine levels prior to initiation of treatment with clozapine
      (responders ranging from 32.2 to 90.3 pg/ml; nonresponders ranging from 92.5 to
      473.5 pg/ml). Additionally, subjects who responded to clozapine showed increased 
      mean plasma concentrations of MHPG and epinephrine during treatment with this
      drug in comparison to the levels measured during pretreatment with typical
      neuroleptic medication. Nonresponders to clozapine failed to show this increase. 
      Finally, in responders to clozapine a negative linear relationship between
      negative symptoms of schizophrenia and the concentrations of plasma
      norepinephrine and serum serotonin were observed. In conclusion, our results
      demonstrate that plasma epinephrine levels prior to initiation of clozapine
      therapy predict response to this atypical neuroleptic. Our findings derived from 
      short-term and maintenance treatment with clozapine suggest involvement of
      norepinephrine, epinephrine and serotonin in the therapeutic actions of the
      atypical neuroleptic clozapine.

PG  - 627-38
AB  - Individualized assessments of the effects of three doses of methylphenidate (MPH)
      were conducted for 2 students with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
      within each child's classroom using behavioral, academic, and social measures. A 
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, multielement design was used to evaluate the
      results. Results suggested that at least one or more dosages of MPH were
      associated with some degree of improvement for both children in each area of
      functioning as compared to placebo. However, the degree of improvement at times
      varied substantially across dosage and area of functioning. Results suggest that 
      MPH dosage and area of child functioning are critical assessment parameters and
      that controlled clinical trials are necessary to optimize the effectiveness of
      treatment with MPH for the individual child.

AB  - We conducted reinforcer assessments for 3 boys with a diagnosis of attention
      deficit hyperactivity disorder who alternately received either placebo or
      previously prescribed methylphenidate. Our purpose was to evaluate whether
      methylphenidate altered the relative reinforcing effectiveness of various stimuli
      that are often used in classroom-based behavioral treatment programs (e.g.,
      activities, tangible items). Results showed clear differences for some stimuli
      between reinforcer assessments conducted when participants had received
      methylphenidate compared to placebo. Results suggest that methylphenidate might
      act as an establishing operation for some common classroom reinforcers.
      Implications for the development and evaluation of behavioral treatments are
      discussed.

AB  - Olanzapine is a new antipsychotic agent with serotonin/dopamine antagonism
      action. Efficacy in treating overall psychopathology in acute schizophrenia as
      measured by the BPRS0-6 total score was demonstrated at 10 mg/day versus placebo;
      at doses in a 5-20 mg/day range, olanzapine was comparable or superior to
      haloperidol. Superior efficacy for negative and depressive symptoms was shown in 
      comparison to haloperidol. Olanzapine has a favorable acute and tardive
      extrapyramidal symptom profile relative to haloperidol and caused substantially
      less elevation of serum prolactin. Dose-related weight gain and asymptomatic mild
      transaminase elevations occurred in olanzapine-treated patients.

PG  - 65-71
AB  - This study evaluates the relative effectiveness and side-effects of risperidone
      as compared with conventional neuroleptics in the treatment of schizophrenia, by 
      meta-analysis of 11 double-blind, randomized controlled trials. The proportion of
      patients showing clinical improvement; use of medications for extrapyramidal
      side-effects (EPS); the treatment drop-out rates; and the changes in negative
      PANSS scores were measured. Compared with conventional neuroleptics, slightly
      more patients in the risperidone group showed clinical improvement [57 vs 52%;
      odds ratio 1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04, 1.56]. The use of
      concomitant medications for EPS was significantly less in the risperidone group
      than in the conventional neuroleptic group (22.8 vs 38.4%; odds ratio 0.51, 95%
      CI: 0.41, 0.63). The overall drop-out rate was lower in the risperidone group
      than in other neuroleptic group (29.1 vs 33.9%; odds ratio 0.75, 95% CI: 0.61,
      0.94). The difference in changes in negative PANSS score between the risperidone 
      and the haloperidol group was -0.74 (95% CI: -1.50, 0.02). Weight gain and
      tachycardia are more common in patients treated with risperidone. Sensitivity
      analysis of different analytic approaches did not materially change the main
      estimates. It was concluded that the short-term efficacy of risperidone is
      comparable to other neuroleptics in the treatment of schizophrenia. It is
      associated with significantly fewer EPS than conventional neuroleptics (mainly
      haloperidol).

TI  - Pemoline-associated hepatic failure: a critical analysis of the literature.
PG  - 14-6
AB  - Pemoline is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant approved for use as part of 
      the comprehensive medical management of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 
      (ADHD). An increased risk of acute hepatic failure is believed to be associated
      with pemoline usage, raising concerns about its prescription. A descriptive
      meta-analysis of the existing scientific literature and drug reporting databases 
      was undertaken to provide more accurate understanding of this possible risk. The 
      analysis appears to indicate that current assumptions of the risk of acute
      hepatic failure posed by pemoline usage alone are overestimates. Several
      recommendations regarding hepatic monitoring in the setting of pemoline
      prescription are provided.

TI  - Minimal effects of dextroamphetamine on scopolamine-induced cognitive impairments
      in humans.
PG  - 50-7
AB  - The central anticholinergic drug scopolamine has been used to model aspects of
      the memory impairment that occurs in Alzheimer's disease and in aging. To
      determine whether nonspecific stimulant effects can attenuate the cognitive
      impairment induced by scopolamine, we studied the effects of scopolamine and the 
      stimulant dextroamphetamine in 17 young normal volunteers. After a baseline day
      of cognitive testing, subjects participated in two study days, in which they
      received dextroamphetamine (d-AMP) (0.25 mg/kg p.o.) + scopolamine (0.5 mg i.v.) 
      and placebo + scopolamine, in randomized order under double-blind conditions.
      There were no statistically significant differences in cognitive test performance
      between the two drug conditions with the exception of one of the category
      retrieval tasks. Stimulant effects were documented to occur by other measures. We
      conclude that d-AMP at the dose used does not attenuate the memory impairment
      induced by scopolamine.

TI  - Predictive value of eosinophilia for neutropenia during clozapine treatment.
PG  - 579-81
AB  - BACKGROUND: Myelotoxicity continues to hinder the widespread use of clozapine in 
      the United States. It has been theorized that eosinophilia predicts later
      agranulocytosis and that agranulocytosis occurs due to an immunologic mechanism. 
      Our study compares the rates of these dyscrasias in clozapine-treated patients
      and a control group. METHOD: Forty-one patients taking clozapine and 29 patients 
      taking haloperidol were monitored for a period of 6 months. Rates of eosinophilia
      and neutropenia were compared between the two treatment groups. RESULTS:
      Treatment-emergent eosinophilia occurred frequently in both haloperidol- and
      clozapine-treated patients. No significant difference was seen between groups in 
      the incidence of eosinophilia and neutropenia. CONCLUSION: We find no statistical
      difference between the rates of eosinophilia or neutropenia in haloperidol- and
      clozapine-treated patients. This study does not support the use of eosinophilia
      as a reliable predictor of neutropenia.

TI  - Childhood-onset schizophrenia. A double-blind clozapine-haloperidol comparison.
PG  - 1090-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Childhood-onset schizophrenia is a rare but severe form of the
      disorder that is often treatment-refractory. In this study, the efficacy and
      adverse effects of clozapine and haloperidol were compared for children and
      adolescents with early-onset schizophrenia. METHODS: Twenty-one patients (mean
      [+/-SD] age, 14.0 +/- 2.3 years) with onset of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
      of Mental Disorders, Revised Third Edition-defined schizophrenia that began by
      age 12 years and who had been nonresponsive to typical neuroleptics participated 
      in the study. Patients were randomized to a 6-week double-blind parallel
      comparison of clozapine (mean [+/-SD] final dose, 176 +/- 149 mg/d), or
      haloperidol, (16 +/- 8 mg/d). RESULTS: Clozapine was superior to haloperidol on
      all measures of psychosis (P = .04-.002). Positive and negative symptoms of
      schizophrenia improved. However, neutropenia and seizures were major concerns. To
      date, one third of the group has discontinued using clozapine. CONCLUSIONS:
      Clozapine has striking superiority for positive and negative symptoms in
      treatment-refractory childhood-onset schizophrenia. However, due to possibly
      increased toxic effects in this pediatric population, close monitoring for
      adverse events is essential.

TI  - Clozapine eligibility: the effect of stringent criteria on ethnic, gender and age
      subgroups of schizophrenic patients.
PG  - 1341-52
AB  - 1. The purpose of this retrospective chart review study was to determine whether 
      broad and stringent criteria differentially impact clozapine eligibility in
      ethnic, gender, and age subgroups of schizophrenic patients. 2. 505 patients
      charts were selected from a random cluster sample of mental health patients known
      to the city and county of San Francisco. Information related to clozapine
      eligibility was abstracted by trained non-clinical personnel. The impact of
      subgroup membership on eligibility was examined using logistic regression
      procedures. 3. Even under the broadest interpretation of FDA requirements for
      clozapine use, Asian patients were less likely to be eligible, since fewer Asian 
      patients met clozapine treatment requirements. Under more stringent eligibility
      criteria, older patients were more likely to be excluded from eligibility when TD
      does not automatically satisfy treatment criteria, and younger patients were more
      likely to lose eligibility if the number of required adequate medication trials
      increases to three. 4. Broad eligibility criteria tend to differentially exclude 
      Asian patients while more stringent criteria differentially exclude younger and
      older patients.

TI  - Potentiation of sufentanil by clonidine in PCEA with or without basal infusion.
PG  - 571-6
AB  - Sufentanil or a sufentanil-clonidine combination was evaluated to determine
      whether the basal rate in patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) might
      affect the daily consumption, quality of analgesia or incidence of side effects. 
      Following Caesarean section delivery, 60 patients were randomly assigned to
      receive one of the four following PCA regimens (15 patients per group) for the
      relief of post-operative pain by the epidural route: sufentanil 2 micrograms mL-1
      in 0.9% NaCl, demand dose 5 micrograms i.e. 2.5 mL, (group S+ with, group S
      without an infusion at 2.5 mL hr-1) or sufentanil 2 micrograms mL-1 + clonidine 3
      micrograms mL-1, demand dose 5 micrograms sufentanil + 7.5 micrograms clonidine
      i.e. 2.5 mL (group SC+ with and SC without an infusion of 2.5 ml hr-1). The other
      PCA settings (Bard I PCA pump) were a lock out of interval of 10 min and a 1 h
      limit of 20 micrograms sufentanil and 30 micrograms clonidine i.e. 10 mL. The
      parameters measured were the analgesic drug consumption and number of dose
      demands during the first 24 h, pain scores at 6 h intervals, side effects and
      quality of sleep. The concurrent infusion increased the dose requirements
      regardless of the content of the syringe. Consumption of sufentanil was the
      highest in those patients receiving the plain solution with a basal infusion.
      Clonidine addition reduced the dose requirements but only significantly in those 
      receiving the background infusion. Patients treated with the mixture tended to
      reach lower pain scores than those receiving sufentanil only without basal rate. 
      Patients receiving the mixture with basal rate requested significantly fewer
      additional demands compared with the three other groups, but this did not
      influence the quality of sleep. Since side effects were more frequently
      registered in the patients in this group, it was concluded that the optimum
      regimen was the sufentanil-clonidine combination but with deletion of the basal
      rate.

TI  - A minimum dose of clonidine added to mepivacaine prolongs the duration of
      anesthesia and analgesia after axillary brachial plexus block.
PG  - 1046-50
AB  - This study assessed the minimum dose of clonidine required to prolong the
      duration of both anesthesia and analgesia after axillary brachial plexus
      blockade. Eighty patients scheduled for elective hand surgery were divided into
      eight groups in a randomized, double-blind fashion. An axillary brachial plexus
      block was performed with 40 mL 1% mepivacaine plus 1:200,000 epinephrine. The
      control group received no clonidine. In the other groups, increasing doses of
      clonidine (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 1, and 1.5 micrograms/kg) were added to the
      local anesthetic solution. Onset time, duration of anesthesia and analgesia,
      postoperative pain score, intake of analgesics, and adverse effects were
      recorded. The eight groups were comparable in terms of onset time, postoperative 
      pain score, and analgesic requirement. The minimum dose of clonidine required to 
      significantly prolong the duration of analgesia and anesthesia was, respectively,
      0.1 and 0.5 microgram/kg. No side effects (sedation, drowsiness, bradycardia,
      arterial hypotension) were reported. We conclude that the dose of clonidine
      required to prolong significantly the duration of both anesthesia and analgesia
      after axillary brachial plexus blockade is 0.5 microgram/kg and that, at this
      dose, clonidine may be used without important reported side effects even in
      outpatients.

TI  - Methylphenidate slows reactions of children with attention deficit disorder
      during and after an error.
PG  - 633-50
AB  - A Sternberg memory search task was administered under placebo and methylphenidate
      to 42 children with cross-situational attention deficit disorder (ADD), 31
      children with cross-situational ADD plus oppositional features, and 25 patients
      with marginal ADD. Overall, stimulant medication enhanced accuracy and speed. In 
      addition, patients reacted faster on correct responses not preceded by an error
      than on errors (especially false alarms) or on correct responses following an
      error. The slowness during error reactions may reflect decreased confidence or
      confusion during stimulus classification. This uncertainty may also lead subjects
      to respond with greater caution, hence more slowly, on correct responses
      following errors. Notably, methylphenidate increased the slowing of reactions on 
      error trials as well as on correct reactions following an error. Stimulant
      medication may augment subjects' persistence when they are uncertain or confused,
      thereby heightening caution and promoting accuracy on succeeding trials.
      Consistent with previous reports of the generality of enhancement of performance 
      by stimulant medication, the impact of methylphenidate was comparable for the
      three subtypes of ADD studied.

TI  - Methylphenidate dosing: twice daily versus three times daily.
PG  - 748-56
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the short-term efficacy and side effects associated with
      two methylphenidate hydrochloride (MPH) dosing patterns. METHODS: Twenty-five
      boys with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) participated in a
      5-week, triple-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover evaluation of MPH
      administered twice (b.i.d.) versus thrice (t.i.d.) per day (mean dose = 8.8 +/- 5
      mg, .30 +/- .1 mg/kg/dose). Four dosing conditions (placebo, titration [gradual
      increase to target dose], b.i.d., and t.i.d.) were used. Dependent measures
      obtained on a weekly basis included: parent and teacher ratings of child
      behavior, parent-child conflicts, parent report of stimulant side effects, child 
      self-report of mood symptoms, a sleep log, laboratory measures of attention, and 
      actigraphic recording of sleep activity. RESULTS: All dosing conditions resulted 
      in significant effects on ADHD symptoms when compared with baseline. Relative to 
      placebo, t.i.d. dosing was characterized by improvement on the greatest number of
      behavioral measures, and both b.i.d. and t.i.d. were generally more effective
      than titration. Direct comparisons of b.i.d. and t.i.d. dosing revealed that
      t.i.d. was associated with greater improvement on the Conners Parent Rating Scale
      Impulsivity/Hyperactivity factor, with a similar marginally significant effect
      for the ADD-H Teacher Rating Scale Hyperactivity factor. The analysis of
      clinically significant change favored a three-times-a-day dosing schedule over
      placebo on both parent and teacher ratings of impulsivity/hyperactivity and
      attention. Compared with placebo, appetite suppression was rated, on average, as 
      more severe in the t.i.d. and titration conditions, but not in the b.i.d.
      condition. However, the number of subjects who exhibited any or severe appetite
      suppression did not differ significantly between the b.i.d. and t.i.d. schedules.
      Although there was no difference in sleep duration for children on b.i.d. and
      t.i.d. schedules, total sleep time appeared to decrease slightly on t.i.d.
      relative to placebo according to both parent ratings and actigraphic assessment. 
      There were no significant differences between b.i.d. and t.i.d. on any other side
      effects or sleep variables. CONCLUSIONS: For many children with ADHD, t.i.d.
      dosing may be optimal. There are few differences in acute side effects between
      b.i.d. and t.i.d. MPH dosing. The dosing schedule should be selected according to
      the severity and time course of ADHD symptoms rather than in anticipation of
      dosing schedule-related side effects.

AB  - The effectiveness of four doses (5-mg, 10-mg, 15-mg, 20-mg) of methylphenidate
      (MPH) and attentional training (AT) were evaluated using neurocognitive
      instruments (Continuous Performance Test; Matching Unfamiliar Figures Test),
      narrow- and broad-band rating scales in the context of a double-blind,
      placebo-control, within-subject reversal design for dizygotic twin girls with

      effective for improving neurocognitive test performance and behavior, although
      broad-band ratings revealed dose-response curves different from those obtained
      from the neurocognitive tests. Implications for clinical management of girls with
      ADHD are discussed.

TI  - Small, oral dose of clonidine reduces the incidence of intraoperative myocardial 
      ischemia in patients having vascular surgery.
PG  - 706-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most new perioperative myocardial ischemic episodes occur in the
      absence of hypertension or tachycardia. The ability of alpha 2-adrenoceptor
      agonists to inhibit central sympathetic outflow may benefit patients with
      coronary artery disease by increasing the myocardial oxygen supply and -demand
      ratio. METHODS: A randomized double-blind study design was used in 297 patients
      scheduled to have elective vascular surgical procedures to evaluate the effects
      of 2 micrograms/kg-1 oral clonidine (n = 145) or placebo (n = 152) on the
      incidence of perioperative myocardial ischemic episodes, myocardial infarction,
      and cardiac death. Continuous real-time S-T segment trend analysis (lead II and
      V5) was performed during anesthesia and surgery and correlated with arterial
      blood pressure and heart rate before and during ischemic events. Dose
      requirements for vasoactive and antiischemic drugs to control blood pressure and 
      heart rate as well as episodes of myocardial ischemia (i.e., catecholamines,
      beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, nitrates, and systemic vasodilators) and fluid
      volume load were recorded. RESULTS: Administration of clonidine reduced the
      incidence of perioperative myocardial ischemic episodes from 39% (59 of 152) to
      24% (35 of 145) (P < 0.01). Hemodynamic patterns, percentage of ischemic time,
      and the number of ischemic episodes per patient did not differ. Nonfatal
      myocardial infarction developed after operation in four patients receiving
      placebo compared with none receiving clonidine (day 2 to 21; P = 0.07). The
      incidence of fatal cardiac events (1 vs. 2) was not different. Dose requirements 
      for vasoactive and antiischemic drugs did not differ between the groups, but the 
      amount of presurgical fluid volume was slightly greater in patients receiving
      clonidine (951 +/- 388 vs. 867 +/- 381 ml; P < 0.03). CONCLUSION: A small oral
      dose of clonidine, given prophylactically, can reduce the incidence of
      perioperative myocardial ischemic episodes without affecting hemodynamic
      stability in patients with suspected or documented coronary artery disease.

TI  - Postoperative analgesia after peripheral nerve block for podiatric surgery:
      clinical efficacy and chemical stability of lidocaine alone versus lidocaine plus
      clonidine.
PG  - 760-5
AB  - Postoperative analgesia may be prolonged by the addition of clonidine to local
      anesthetic solutions used for regional anesthesia. The purpose of this study was 
      to test this hypothesis in a clinical trial of patients undergoing podiatric
      surgery. The study design was prospective, double-blinded, and randomized. Ninety
      ASA physical status I or II patients scheduled for bunionectomy or hammer toe
      repair were randomized to receive ankle or metatarsal blocks with plain 1.73%
      lidocaine (Group L), 1.73% lidocaine with 10 micrograms/mL of clonidine added
      (Group C10), or 1.73% lidocaine with 20 micrograms/mL clonidine (Group C20). Time
      from the performance of the block to 1) loss of sensation to pinprick, 2) return 
      of sensation to pinprick, 3) onset of postsurgical pain, and 4) time of first
      oral pain medication intake were recorded. Beginning at 1 h after the completion 
      of the block, visual analog scale (VAS) and verbal pain scores were recorded
      every 30 min. Additional postoperative oral pain medication required in the first
      9 h after the block was also recorded. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to
      analyze intergroup differences in the VAS and verbal pain scores, the time to
      first reported pain, the time to first oral pain medication, and the total amount
      of oral pain medications required. Repeated-measures ANOVA was used to analyze
      the VAS and verbal pain scores overall and integrated assessment of pain scores
      and rescue medication was per-formed. Adverse events were also recorded for each 
      group. There were no differences among the three groups with regard to overall
      VAS pain scores although Group C10 had significantly better verbal pain scores
      after the first 3 h (P < 0.05). There was also no difference in time to loss or
      return of pinprick sensation. Group C10 had a longer time to first reported pain 
      (P < 0.01), a longer time to first oral pain medication (P < 0.01), a lower
      average total dose of oral pain medication required (P < 0.05), and a lower
      integrated assessment of pain and medication (P < 0.01) than Group L. More
      patients in Group C10 reported no pain postoperatively (P < 0.01) and no pain
      medication taken (P < 0.01) than Group L. Group C20 results suggested no
      statistically significant improvement over plain lidocaine. One patient in Group 
      C20 experienced significant hypotension postoperatively. pH determinations and
      chemical analysis by capillary electrophoresis showed no significant change in
      composition of the solutions when clonidine was mixed with lidocaine and stored
      at 4 degrees C for 1 wk. Compared to 1.73% lidocaine, combining clonidine (10
      micrograms/mL) with lidocaine for local anesthetic block for foot surgery
      significantly increases the duration and quality of postoperative analgesia.

TI  - Mechanism of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor-related anemia in renal
      transplant recipients.
PG  - 973-8
AB  - To delineate the pathogenesis of the reduction in hemoglobin occurring in renal
      transplant patients treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) 
      and azathioprine (AZA) a controlled, prospective trial of ACEI withdrawal was
      conducted. The ACEI was replaced by nifedipine or clonidine in 15 kidney
      transplant patients immunosuppressed with AZA and prednisone (enalapril in 14 and
      captopril in 1). Before and during 10 to 12 weeks after withdrawal of the ACEI,
      AZA metabolites, renal function parameters and hematological parameters including
      erythropoietin and reticulocytes were evaluated. Enalaprilat levels were measured
      and compared with 15 similar patients matched for transplant function and
      enalapril dosage immunosuppressed with cyclosporine and prednisone. AZA
      metabolites did not differ significantly in the presence or absence of the ACEI. 
      Enalaprilat levels also showed no significant difference between the two patient 
      groups treated with AZA or cyclosporine. Hematocrit and hemoglobin increased
      significantly from 37.5 +/- 6.4 to 39.7 +/- 3.6% (mean +/- SD, P = 0.02) and 12.8
      +/- 2.2 to 13.5 +/- 1.2 g/dl, P = 0.04, respectively, 10 to 12 weeks after ACEI
      treatment had been discontinued. Simultaneously numbers of reticulocytes and
      erythropoietin concentrations rose significantly after 2, 4 and 10 weeks, with a 
      peak at two weeks (from 14.1 +/- 3.8 to 20.6 +/- 8.0/1000, P < 0.05 and from 14.3
      +/- 12.4 to 29.3 +/- 54.5 mU/ml, P < 0.05, respectively). In conclusion,
      ACEI-related anemia in renal transplant recipients seems to be due to the
      erythropoietin-lowering effect of this group of drugs. A pharmacokinetic
      interaction between AZA and enalapril is not likely since plasma enalaprilat
      levels were independent of the immunosuppressive regimen and AZA metabolite
      levels were unchanged in the presence and absence of the ACEI. Several mechanisms
      by which angiotensin converting enzyme blockade may cause a decrease in
      circulating erythropoietin are discussed.

TI  - Clonidine and or adrenaline decrease lignocaine plasma peak concentration after
      epidural injection.
PG  - 242-5
AB  - Clonidine is an alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist increasingly used in combination
      with lignocaine for spinal or epidural anaesthesia because of a prolonged
      analgesic effect. Life adrenaline, it may decrease lignocaine peak concentration 
      (Cmax), thus leading to decreased toxicity. However, the effects of clonidine on 
      resorption of lignocaine into the systemic circulation from the epidural space
      remain to be established. We studied the pharmacokinetics of lignocaine after
      epidural injection of lignocaine with or without clonidine, adrenaline and both
      drugs. Total body clearance and apparent volume of distribution were similar in
      the four groups, but the maximum observed concentration (Cmax) was markedly
      increased in the plain solution group as compared with the other groups; (plain
      lignocaine: 7.15 +/- 2.04 micrograms ml-1, lignocaine + adrenaline: 3.11 +/- 136 
      micrograms ml-1, lignocaine + clonidine: 4.48 +/- 1.26 micrograms ml-1,
      lignocaine + adrenaline + clonidine: 4.06 +/- 1.42 micrograms ml-1 [mean +/-
      s.d.]). Our results show that, clonidine decreases lignocaine Cmax to the same
      extent as adrenaline.

TI  - Interaction between intrathecal neostigmine and epidural clonidine in human
      volunteers.
PG  - 315-25
AB  - BACKGROUND: alpha 2-Adrenergic agonists are thought to produce analgesia, in
      part, by activating spinal acetylcholine release. The purpose of the current
      study was to examine the interaction between intrathecal neostigmine and epidural
      clonidine for analgesia and side effects in humans. METHODS: A total of 58
      volunteers received an intrathecal injection of 5% dextrose in normal saline
      (D5NS) or neostigmine (50, 100, or 200 micrograms in D5NS), followed in 1 h by
      epidural saline or clonidine (computer-controlled infusion targeted to 50, 100,
      200, or 400 ng/ml in cerebrospinal fluid) using an isobolographic design. Visual 
      analog scale pain to a noxious cold stimulus, nausea, weakness, sedation, and
      other safety variables was measured before and at specified intervals after drug 
      administration. RESULTS: The first 21 volunteers randomized to receive
      intrathecal hyperbaric neostigmine rather than D5NS received the drug while in
      the sitting position, and had none-to-minimal analgesia 1 h later. The remaining 
      volunteers received the drug while in the lateral position, and demonstrated
      dose-dependent analgesia in the foot 1 h later. Epidural clonidine also caused
      dose-dependent analgesia. The combination of neostigmine and clonidine resulted
      in an additive enhancement for analgesia, but no enhancement of each drug's side 
      effects, and a reduction in clonidine-induced hypotension. Neostigmine injected
      into subjects in the lateral position diminished clonidine-induced reductions in 
      blood pressure and plasma norepinephrine. CONCLUSION: These results support
      enhancement of alpha 2-adrenergic analgesia by intrathecal neostigmine, but do
      not demonstrate synergy, as observed in animals. Lack of enhancement of side
      effects suggests this combination may be clinically useful.

      vs 0.5% timolol. Apraclonidine Primary Therapy Study Group.
PG  - 938-42
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare long-term intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering efficacy of
      0.25% and 0.5% apraclonidine hydrochloride with 0.5% timolol maleate. DESIGN:
      Multicenter, randomized, double-masked trial. Adult patients of either sex
      diagnosed as having open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were enrolled
      following appropriate washout from all ocular hypotensive medications. Morning
      IOPs of 22 to 35 mm Hg were required for entry. Patients received 0.25% or 0.5%
      apraclonidine 3 times a day or 0.5% timolol twice a day for 90 days. Intraocular 
      pressure was measured at 8 AM (before morning dosing) and at 4 PM (8 hours after 
      dosing) on days 1, 30, and 90, and only at 8 AM on day 14. RESULTS: All 3
      medications significantly reduced IOP from baseline at all observation times (P <
      .001): 0.5% apraclonidine reduced IOP more than 0.25% apraclonidine; no
      significant difference was observed between 0.5% apraclonidine and 0.5% timolol 8
      hours after dosing on days 1, 30, and 90; and a significant difference (P < .05) 
      in favour of 0.5% timolol over 0.25% apraclonidine was observed 8 hours after
      dosing on day 30. At all morning visits following evening dosing, 0.5% timolol
      significantly reduced IOP more than both concentrations of apraclonidine.
      CONCLUSIONS: Both 0.25% and 0.5% apraclonidine significantly reduce IOP when used
      as primary ocular hypotensive medication. Although 0.25% and 0.5% apraclonidine
      reduce IOP to a similar degree as 0.5% timolol 8 hours after morning dosing,
      neither concentration is as effective for reducing morning IOP after evening
      dosing.

TI  - [Risperidone in the treatment of chronic schizophrenia: multicenter study
      comparative to haloperidol].
PG  - 165-72
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of five
      different doses of risperidone with a fixed dose of haloperidol in patients with 
      chronic schizophrenia. METHOD: After a 1-week single-blind, placebo washout
      phase, 99 chronic schizophrenic patients were randomly assigned to double-blind
      treatment with 1, 4, 8, 12 or 16 mg risperidone or 10 mg haloperidol daily for 8 
      weeks. Efficacy was assessed throughout the study by the Positive and Negative
      Syndrome Scale (PANSS) for schizophrenia, and Clinical Global Impression (CGI).
      Safety assessments included the Extrapyramidal Symptom Ratinf Scale (ESRS) UKU
      Side Effect Rating Scale, vital signs, body weight, ECG and laboratory screening.
      RESULTS: Risperidone had a bell-shaped dose-response curve, with optimal
      therapeutic responses occurring at a daily dose of 8 mg. The therapeutic response
      to haloperidol was similar to that seen with risperidone 16 mg. Risperidone was
      associated with significantly less extrapyramidal symptoms than haloperidol, as
      assessed by the ESRS. The effect was mirrored by the requirement for
      antiparkinson rescue medication. Furthermore, the overall incidence of adverse
      events was markedly lower with the optimum dose of risperidone than with
      haloperidol. CONCLUSIONS: Risperidone is at least as effective as haloperidol for
      the treatment of chronic schizophrenia. Moreover, risperidone is associated with 
      an improved adverse event profile and significantly less extrapyramidal symptoms 
      which will have beneficial implications on patient quality of life and
      compliance. These results are in agreement with the results from the
      international multicenter trial.

PG  - 1142-9
AB  - The reliability of serial [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET scans for
      psychopharmacologic studies was tested by using placebo infusions. METHODS: FDG
      scans were obtained before and after a 30 min placebo infusion (n = 10; Group 1) 
      or after each of two bolus infusions with placebo (n = 8; Group 2). Subjects
      performed a continuous performance task (CPT) during each scan. Cardiovascular
      measures and ratings of anxiety were obtained in all subjects. Samples for
      determination of plasma norepinephrine (NE) were taken at multiple time points in
      Group 1. RESULTS: A slight increase in apparent global metabolism occurred
      between scans in both Groups 1 and 2. A few regions significantly increased in
      both groups. While an apparent increase in sympathetic activity occurred during
      the placebo infusion, neither NE levels, anxiety ratings nor cardiovascular
      measures correlated with global or regional FD6 uptake. CONCLUSION: Test-retest
      differences of global and regional glucose metabolism were highly consistent
      across two experimental designs. While increases in cerebral glucose metabolism
      appeared to occur during the second scan, differences between scans were small.
      This method may offer advantages for selected psychopharmacologic studies.

TI  - Does haloperidol block methylphenidate? Motivation or attention?
PG  - 70-4
AB  - The effect of methylphenidate preceded by a moderate dose of haloperidol on
      reaction times over the duration of a continuous performance test (CPT), was
      investigated in ten male children, with a DSM-III diagnosis of attention deficit 
      disorder with hyperactivity disorder (ADDH). Using a within-subject double-blind 
      design, the effects of methylphenidate preceded by haloperidol on reaction time
      during the first and second blocks of CPT test were compared. Methylphenidate
      maintained a significantly improved reaction time in the second block of the CPT 
      test. When methylphenidate, preceded by placebo, was preceded by haloperidol this
      effect was not observed, suggesting opposing effects on attentional systems by
      methylphenidate versus haloperidol. The study is the first to examine the
      "blocking" effect of haloperidol over the course of a CPT. The results suggest
      that dopamine systems are involved in the maintenance of the CPT response, and
      support an "incentive motivation" theory of sustained attention.

TI  - The efficacy of clonidine for reducing perioperative haemodynamic changes and
      volatile anaesthetic requirements in children.
PG  - 746-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oral clonidine given as a premedicant in adults has been shown to
      reduce intraoperative inhalation anaesthetic requirements and provide
      perioperative haemodynamic stability. We conducted the current study to ascertain
      whether or not these beneficial effects of clonidine can be reproduced in
      children. METHODS: In a prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled
      clinical trial, 60 children (ASA I) aged 5-11 yr, received placebo (control), 2
      micrograms kg-1 clonidine, or 4 micrograms kg-1 clonidine orally 105 min before
      induction of anaesthesia. Anaesthesia was induced with halothane, nitrous oxide
      in oxygen via mask and maintained with halothane and 60% nitrous oxide in oxygen.
      The halothane concentration was titrated to the concentration required to
      maintain haemodynamic stability (defined as 20% of blood pressure (BP) and heart 
      rate (HR)) for maintenance of anaesthesia. The end-tidal concentration of
      halothane was monitored throughout anaesthesia. On completion of surgery, nitrous
      oxide and halothane were discontinued. Following confirmation of recovery from
      anaesthesia and muscle relaxation, the endotracheal tube was removed. RESULTS:
      Higher inspired concentrations of halothane (%) were required in the control and 
      2 micrograms kg-1 clonidine-treated groups (mean SD: 1.1 +/- 0.2 and 1.0 +/- 0.2,
      respectively) than in the 4 micrograms kg-1 clonidine-treated group (0.6 +/- 0.1)
      for haemodynamic stability (P < 0.05). Clonidine, 4 micrograms kg-1,
      significantly reduced the intraoperative lability (coefficient of variation) of
      systolic and diastolic BP and HR compared with the other two regimens.
      CONCLUSION: Oral clonidine premedication at a dose of 4 micrograms kg-1 provided 
      intraoperative haemodynamic stability and reduced anaesthetic requirements in
      children. However, we are unable to extrapolate these observations to younger
      children and infants.

TI  - Cocaine and cigarettes: a comparison of risks.
PG  - 269-78
AB  - In order to provide additional data and perspective to current clinical, policy, 
      and legal debates surrounding the prenatal use of cocaine in the USA, a
      retrospective cohort study was conducted to examine effects of cocaine on
      selected perinatal outcomes, and to compare the relative risks of adverse
      perinatal outcomes among users of cocaine and users of cigarettes. Using data
      from a large urban perinatal registry, relative risks of selected perinatal
      outcomes were determined for maternal cocaine users who were non-smokers of
      cigarettes, and used no marijuana, heroin, amphetamines, or alcohol (n = 64), and
      for cigarette smokers who do not use illicit drugs or alcohol during pregnancy (n
      = 3209). When compared with women with no recorded prenatal exposure to drugs or 
      cigarettes (n = 13,043), cocaine users had higher risks than smokers for the
      following adverse outcomes: low birthweight [Relative Risk (RR) 5.3, 95%
      Confidence Interval (CI) 3.0-9.3], small-for-gestational age (SGA) [RR 4.2, 95%
      CI 2.4-7.3], prematurity [RR 4.0, 95% CI 2.3-7.0], abruptio placentae [RR 10.0,
      95% CI 3.5-29.0], placenta praevia [RR = 2.4, 95% CI 0.3-17.8] and perinatal
      death [RR = 5.3, 95% CI 1.9-15.2]. Smokers who did not use any drugs experienced 
      most of the same adverse perinatal outcomes as cocaine users, but the magnitude
      of risk was greater in cocaine users than in smokers for all outcomes. However,
      given the greater numbers of cigarette smokers than cocaine users in the
      population the numbers of infants in the population suffering these adverse
      outcomes is likely to be greater among offspring of cigarette smokers. The data
      support the current concern about the risk of cocaine, and current efforts to
      provide treatment to pregnant cocaine users. The data also underline the
      continued substantial risks of cigarette smoking to large numbers of pregnant
      women.

TI  - Effect of lazabemide on the progression of disability in early Parkinson's
      disease. The Parkinson Study Group.
PG  - 99-107
AB  - Lazabemide (Ro 19-6327) is a relatively short-acting, reversible, and selective
      type B monoamine oxidase inhibitor that is not metabolized to amphetamines or
      other active compounds. We previously found lazabemide to be safe and well
      tolerated at dosages of up to 400 mg/day during a 6-week study of 201 patients
      with early untreated Parkinson's disease (PD). We now assess whether or not
      lazabemide influences the progression of disability in untreated PD. Patients (N 
      = 321) were assigned by randomization to one of five treatment groups (placebo,
      25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, or 200 mg/day) and followed systematically for up to 1
      year. The risk of reaching the primary end point (the onset of disability
      sufficient to require levodopa therapy) was reduced by 51% for the patients who
      received lazabemide compared with placebo-treated subjects. This effect was
      consistent among all dosages. The frequency of adverse experiences did not differ
      among the treatment groups. At dosages ranging from 25 to 200 mg/day, lazabemide 
      was well tolerated and delayed the need for levodopa in early, otherwise
      untreated PD. The magnitude and pattern of benefits were similar to those
      observed after 1 year of deprenyl (selegiline) treatment in the DATATOP clinical 
      trial.

TI  - A comparative evaluation of pilocarpine 1% and clonidine 0.125% versus timolol
      0.5%.
PG  - 87-9
AB  - All the presently available antiglaucoma medications have either local or
      systemic adverse effects. Combinations of drugs are being used not only to
      increase the effectivity and compliance but also to decrease the incidence and
      magnitude of side effects. The single dose response of open angle glaucoma eyes
      to pilocarpine 1%, clonidine 0.125%, a combination of pilocarpine 1% and
      clonidine 0.125%, and timolol 0.5% was studied in a double blind, masked, cross
      over study. Over a period of twelve hours the effectivity of the combination of
      pilocarpine 1% and clonidine 0.125% was significantly more than that of either
      drug alone and was found to be similar to that of timolol 0.5%. No local or
      systemic adverse effects were seen.

TI  - Effect of oral clonidine premedication on anesthetic requirement, hormonal
      response, hemodynamics, and recovery in coronary artery bypass graft surgery
      patients.
PG  - 263-72
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To examine how premedication with clonidine affects opioid use, 
      hemodynamic effects, hormonal responses, and recovery effects. DESIGN: Double
      blind, placebo-controlled study. SETTING: Operating room and surgical intensive
      care unit of a university medical center. PATIENTS: 54 patients undergoing
      elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. INTERVENTIONS: Patients
      received approximately 5 micrograms/kg of oral clonidine or a placebo together
      with 40 micrograms/kg lorazepam 90 minutes prior to titrated sufentanil induction
      of anesthesia. Thirty minutes prior to cardiopulmonary bypass, a second dose of
      either approximately 5 micrograms/kg clonidine or placebo was given as a slurry
      via a nasogastric tube. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Opioid use, hemodynamic
      effects, hormonal responses, and recovery effects were recorded. Values for ten
      hemodynamic variables were compiled on the evening prior to surgery, prior to
      induction, and during seven additional events and compared. Catecholamines and
      beta-endorphins were measured prior to induction, after intubation, and after
      sternotomy. The amount of sufentanil used for induction, maintenance, and total
      opioid were compared. The times to awakening and response to verbal commands were
      compared. The two groups exhibited similar patient demographics, cardiopulmonary 
      bypass time, and duration of surgery. Patients receiving clonidine required
      significantly (p < 0.04) less sufentanil for induction (clonidine: 2.19 +/- 0.95 
      micrograms/kg vs. placebo: 2.93 +/- 1.07 micrograms/kg) and total amount of
      sufentanil (clonidine: 9.1 +/- 3.9 micrograms/kg vs. placebo: 11.7 +/- 4.6
      micrograms/kg). Patients receiving clonidine required significantly (p < 0.01)
      less isoflurane (9.7 +/- 6.8 MAC min vs. 19.7 +/- 9.9 MAC min) to maintain heart 
      rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) to within 15% of baseline without
      significant differences in other vasoactive drugs. Catecholamine concentrations
      were significantly (p < 0.02) lower in patients receiving clonidine without any
      difference in beta-endorphin concentrations. Patients receiving clonidine had
      significantly (p < 0.02) lower HR, systolic arterial pressure, MAP, and systemic 
      vascular resistance prior to induction than patients receiving placebo without
      differences in other hemodynamic variables. CONCLUSION: Clonidine decreases
      opioid use and lowers hormonal response while maintaining stable hemodynamics in 
      patients undergoing CABG with sufentanil anesthesia.

TI  - Spinal clonidine produces less urinary retention than spinal morphine.
PG  - 872-3
AB  - We have conducted a double-blind, randomized study in two groups of 20 patients
      each, undergoing hip surgery during spinal anaesthesia, to compare the incidence 
      of urinary retention after spinal morphine or clonidine. Patients received 0.5%
      spinal bupivacaine 15 mg combined with either clonidine 75 micrograms or morphine
      0.2 mg. After operation, patients were examined for micturition, bladder
      distension, or both; when they failed to void, they received naloxone 0.2 mg, and
      if bladder distension persisted, a catheter was inserted. At 12 h, all patients
      in the morphine group but only five in the clonidine group had bladder
      distension, and at 24 h this was present in seven and one patient in the morphine
      and clonidine groups, respectively (P < 0.001). Naloxone was given in 16 and one,
      and a catheter was placed in one and six patients in the morphine and clonidine
      groups, respectively (P < 0.001). We conclude that spinal clonidine impaired
      bladder function to a lesser extent than morphine.

TI  - Differential effect of clozapine on weight: a controlled study.
PG  - 817-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study examined whether clozapine induces more weight gain than
      haloperidol and whether weight gain is related to clinical improvement. METHOD:
      The weight and symptoms of 39 outpatients with schizophrenia who were randomly
      assigned to double-blind treatment with either clozapine or haloperidol were
      assessed. The weight and symptoms of 33 of the patients who chose to take
      clozapine during a 1-year follow-up after the study ended were also assessed.
      RESULTS: The patients treated with clozapine gained significantly more weight
      over baseline (7%) than the haloperidol-treated patients (1%). Weight gain was
      not significantly correlated with improvements in either positive or negative
      symptoms. Fifty-eight percent of the patients followed for 1 year gained at least
      10% over their baseline weight. CONCLUSIONS: Weight gain is an important side
      effect of clozapine and is unrelated to the drug's differential antipsychotic
      efficacy.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of risperidone in psychotic patients: an open study.
PG  - 291-5
AB  - This open prospective study was undertaken to determine the efficacy and safety
      of a fixed dose (6 mg) of risperidone in psychotic patients. Hospital in-patients
      who fulfilled DSM-111-R criteria for schizophrenia, schizoaffective and bipolar
      disorders were eligible for entry into the study (n = 15). Patients who were on
      other antipsychotics had a washout period of 1 week before they were started on
      the drug. A fixed dose of risperidone was administered (6 mg). The Brief
      Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Negative Symptom Rating Scale (NSRS) and
      Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale were used to measure psychopathology and
      extrapyramidal side-effects. Five patients dropped out of the study. Two patients
      became very agitated and potentially aggressive, one patient became very restless
      and did not respond to benzodiazepines, and one dropped out because of
      restlessness that did not respond to clonazepam. Of the 10 patients who completed
      the study, 50 per cent reduction on BPRS and NSRS was achieved by five and six
      patients respectively. There was a marginally significant trend towards a greater
      reduction in the magnitude of negative symptoms. Four patients required treatment
      with anticholinergic drugs. Risperidone was effective in resistent psychotic
      patients, but agitated and impulsive psychotic patients with positive symptoms
      may not be best candidates for treatment with risperidone. On average, negative
      symptoms respond better than positive symptoms.

TI  - A prospective 4-year follow-up study of attention-deficit hyperactivity and
      related disorders.
PG  - 437-46
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous cross-sectional data showed that children and adolescents
      with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are at increased risk of
      comorbid conduct, mood, and anxiety disorders as well as impairments in
      cognitive, social, family, and school functioning. However, longitudinal data
      were needed to confirm these initial impressions. METHODS: Using DSM-III-R
      structured diagnostic interviews and raters blinded as to diagnosis, we
      reexamined psychiatric diagnoses at 1- and 4-year follow-ups in children with
      ADHD and controls. In addition, subjects were evaluated for cognitive,
      achievement, social, school and family functioning. RESULTS: Analyses of
      follow-up findings revealed significant differences between children with ADHD
      and controls in rates of behavioral, mood, and anxiety disorders, with these
      disorders increasing markedly from baseline to follow-up assessments. In
      addition, children with ADHD had significantly more impaired cognitive, family,
      school, and psychosocial functioning than did controls. Baseline diagnosis of
      conduct disorder predicted major depression and bipolar disorder at follow-up,
      and anxiety disorders at baseline predicted anxiety disorders at follow-up.
      CONCLUSION: These results confirm and extend previous retrospective results
      indicating that children with ADHD are at high risk of developing a wide range of
      impairments affecting multiple domains of psychopathology such as cognition,
      interpersonal, school, and family functioning. These findings provide further
      support for the value of considering psychiatric comorbidity in both clinical
      assessment and research protocols involving children with ADHD.

TI  - What they want and what they get: the social goals of boys with ADHD and
      comparison boys.
PG  - 169-85
AB  - Twenty-seven boys diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) 
      and 18 comparison boys participated in a competitive tetradic interaction task.
      Boys were individually interviewed before the game about their goals for the
      interaction, and adult observers inferred boys' social goals from videotapes of
      the interaction. Social acceptance was determined by combining positive and
      negative sociometric nominations collected through individual interviews at the
      end of the summer research program in which the interaction was held. In their
      self-reports, ADHD-high aggressive boys prioritized trouble-seeking and fun at
      the expense of rules to a greater extent than did both ADHD-low aggressive and
      comparison boys. Observers judged ADHD-high aggressive boys to seek attention
      more strongly and seek fairness less strongly than of the other two groups.
      Self-reported goals of defiance and cooperation predicted boys' end-of-program
      social standing, even with interactional behaviors and subgroup status controlled
      statistically. Observer-inferred goals were differentially associated with social
      acceptance for ADHD and comparison boys, suggesting discontinuities in peer
      interaction processes. Differentiation of goals from behavior and the integral
      role of children's goals in peer acceptance are discussed.

TI  - Comparison of the effects of clonidine on tyramine- and methoxamine-evoked
      mydriasis in man.
PG  - 269-75
AB  - 1. It has been reported previously that clonidine can potentiate tyramine-evoked 
      mydriasis on the pain-free side of cluster headache patients. We examined whether
      a single oral dose of clonidine (200 micrograms) can also potentiate
      tyramine-evoked mydriasis in healthy subjects, using mydriasis to methoxamine, a 
      directly acting sympathomimetic amine, as a control. 2. Eight healthy male
      volunteers participated in four weekly sessions. In the first two sessions
      (Experiment 1) the effect of clonidine or placebo on the mydriasis to tyramine
      hydrochloride eyedrops (75 mM; 2 x 10 microliters), and in the last two sessions 
      (Experiment 2) the effect of clonidine or placebo on the mydriasis to methoxamine
      hydrochloride eyedrops (20 mM; 2 x 10 microliters) was examined. In both
      experiments subjects were allocated to drugs and sessions according to a
      double-blind balanced design. In both experiments, pupil diameter of both the
      treated and the untreated eyes was recorded in standard ambient light and in the 
      dark, before, and 2 h after clonidine/placebo, via binocular infrared television 
      pupillometry. Salivation (dental roll technique), systolic and diastolic blood
      pressure (sitting), heart rate, and self-ratings of mood and feelings (visual
      analogue scales), were also measured before, and 2 h after the ingestion of
      clonidine or placebo. 3. Both tyramine and methoxamine produced a significant
      mydriasis, which was more prominent in the light condition (change in resting
      pupil size; mm +/- s.e.mean: tyramine/light 1.05 +/- 0.28; tyramine/dark: 0.73
      +/- 0.15; methoxamine/light: 1.65 +/- 0.28; methoxamine/dark: 0.85 +/- 0.15).
      Clonidine produced a significant miosis in the untreated eye which was more
      prominent in the light condition (change in resting pupil size; mm +/- s.e.mean: 
      Experiment 1, light: -1.34 +/- 0.19; Experiment 1, dark: -0.46 +/- 0.1;
      Experiment 2, light -0.97 +/- 0.18; Experiment 2, dark: -0.29 +/- 0.17).
      Clonidine had no significant effect on either tyramine- or methoxamine-evoked
      mydriasis. 4. In agreement with previous reports, clonidine significantly reduced
      salivation (g, mean +/- s.e.mean; Experiment 1: -0.84 +/- 0.22; Experiment 2:
      -0.55 +/- 0.11), systolic blood pressure (mm Hg; Experiment 1: -17.5 +/- 3.76;
      Experiment 2: -23.38 +/- 4.67), diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg; Experiment 2:
      -12.38 +/- 2.05), alertness (mm; Experiment 2: -24.19 +/- 5.40), and anxiety (mm;
      Experiment 1: -13.82 +/- 4.60), indicating the presence of pharmacodynamically
      effective tissue levels of the drug. 5. These results show that a single oral
      dose (200 micrograms) of clonidine causes significant miosis in human subjects,
      and fails to potentiate tyramine-evoked mydriasis. This indicates that the pupil 
      on the asymptomatic side of cluster headache patients is affected differently
      from the pupils of healthy volunteers by tyramine and/or clonidine.

TI  - ICI 204,636, an atypical antipsychotic: efficacy and safety in a multicenter,
      placebo-controlled trial in patients with schizophrenia. U.S. SEROQUEL Study
      Group.
PG  - 158-69
AB  - ICI 204,636 is a new, potentially atypical antipsychotic. In early phase II
      trials, the antipsychotic was well tolerated and results suggested efficacy in
      the treatment of the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The
      efficacy and safety of ICI 204,636 were evaluated on a larger scale in a 6-week, 
      multicenter, double-blind trial. Hospitalized patients who met DSM-III-R criteria
      for chronic or subchronic schizophrenia with acute exacerbation, as well as other
      criteria, were randomized to ICI 204,636 (75 to 750 mg daily) (N = 54) or placebo
      (N = 55). Patients were assessed weekly by use of the Brief Psychiatric Rating
      Scale (BPRS), Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), and Clinical 
      Global Impression Scale (CGI) for efficacy and the Simpson Scale and Abnormal
      Involuntary Movement Scale for extrapyramidal side effects (EPS). Significant
      differences (p < or = 0.05) between treatment groups, which favored ICI 204,636, 
      were identified throughout the trial. Endpoint differences were significant (by
      analysis of covariance) for BPRS factor IV (activation) and SANS scores and were 
      marginally significant for total BPRS, BPRS factor III (thought disturbance),
      BPRS positive-symptom cluster, and CGI Severity of Illness item scores (p = 0.07,
      0.09, 0.06, and 0.09, respectively). ICI 204,636 was well tolerated, although it 
      was associated with mild transient increases in alanine aminotransferase and a
      higher incidence of somnolence and anticholinergic effects compared with placebo.
      In the dose range studied, treatment with ICI 204,636 did not induce EPS as
      determined by analysis of Simpson Scale total scores and lack of
      treatment-emergent acute dystonic reactions. Furthermore, ICI 204,636 did not
      produce sustained levels of prolactin; the mean change from baseline at endpoint 
      (-7.2 micrograms/L) was comparable (p = 0.44) to that for placebo (-8.2
      micrograms/L). These findings distinguish ICI 204,636 from standard
      antipsychotics and confirm preclinical predictions that ICI 204,636 is an
      atypical antipsychotic.

TI  - Clozapine versus typical antipsychotics. A retro- and prospective study of
      extrapyramidal side effects.
PG  - 188-96
AB  - Schizophrenic patients in long-term neuroleptic monotherapy with clozapine (n =
      100) and perphenazine, flupenthixol or zuclopentixol (controls, n = 100) were
      evaluated for extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) (blind) as well as other side
      effects and mental condition (non-blind). In both groups the patients had
      received neuroleptic treatment for a total of 14 years (median) and the present
      antipsychotic (clozapine or control drug) for 5 years. Thus the clozapine-treated
      patients had previously received traditional neuroleptics for 9 years (median).
      The study was both retrospective (0.3-19 years for clozapine, 0.3-24 years for
      control drug, by means of chart information) and prospective (1 year, with
      video-controlled evaluation of EPS). There was a significantly lower prevalence
      of tardive dyskinesia (TD) in clozapine treated patients than control patients,
      although prior to this treatment there were more TD patients in the clozapine
      group (P < 0.05). This lower level of TD in the clozapine group was related to a 
      lower induction of new cases (P < 0.001) and a tendency towards greater
      disappearance of TD in the clozapine than in the control group (P = 0.07).
      Clozapine treated patients without TD had started clozapine and ceased
      traditional neuroleptics at an earlier age than those with TD. Parkinsonian signs
      were seen in 33% of the clozapine patients versus 61% of the control patients,
      mainly as hypokinesia; tremor in 3% versus 11% and rigidity in 0 versus 19%.
      Psychic akathisia was found in 14% versus 40% and motor akathisia in 7% versus
      29% of the patients, all differences significantly in favor of clozapine.
      Clozapine treated patients also had less neuroleptic-induced emotional
      indifference and depression, but more autonomic side effects than controls.

TI  - Relapse following clozapine withdrawal: effect of neuroleptic drugs and
      cyproheptadine.
PG  - 176-87
AB  - The objective of this study was to report the effect of the slow withdrawal of
      clozapine from 19 patients with neuroleptic-responsive schizophrenia at the end
      of a 2-year clinical trial of clozapine and to compare this with the results of
      naturalistic discontinuation of clozapine treatment in 64 neuroleptic-resistant
      schizophrenic patients. Nineteen neuroleptic-responsive schizophrenic patients
      who received clozapine were withdrawn from clozapine by tapering it over 3-week
      period with and without the addition of a typical neuroleptic. Fifteen of the 19 
      neuroleptic-responsive patients experienced the return of psychotic symptoms
      during or after the clozapine taper, which were most severe in the ten patients
      in whom the withdrawal of clozapine was carried out without prior addition of
      neuroleptic treatment. Addition of a neuroleptic prior to clozapine withdrawal
      prevented the emergence of positive symptoms during clozapine withdrawal in each 
      of eight patients. Nevertheless, psychotic symptoms emerged, usually within a
      week after discontinuing clozapine, in six of the eight patients. Neuroleptic
      treatment, with or without an anticholingergic drug, was much less effective in
      treating positive symptoms in these patients immediately after the clozapine
      withdrawal than it had been 2 years previously. Cyproheptadine, a non-selective
      serotonin receptor antagonist, augmented the antipsychotic effect of neuroleptics
      in each of four patients who relapsed following withdrawal from clozapine and
      relieved extrapyramidal symptoms in a fifth patient. The frequency of relapse
      following withdrawal of clozapine in 64 neuroleptic-resistant patients was
      significantly lower (25/64, 39.1%) than in the neuroleptic-responsive patients.

TI  - Olanzapine versus placebo: results of a double-blind, fixed-dose olanzapine
      trial.
PG  - 159-67
AB  - Olanzapine is a potential new "atypical" antipsychotic agent. This double-blind, 
      acute phase study compared two doses of olanzapine [1 mg/day (Olz1.0); 10 mg/day 
      (Olz10.0)] with placebo in the treatment of 152 patients who met the DSM-III-R
      criteria for schizophrenia and had a Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS)-total 
      score (items scored 0-6) > or = 24. In overall symptomatology improvement
      [BPRS-total score and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)-total score], 
      Olz10.0 was statistically significantly superior to placebo. In positive symptom 
      improvement (PANSS-positive score, BPRS-positive score), Olz10.0 was
      statistically significantly superior to placebo. In negative symptom improvement 
      (PANSS-negative score), Olz10.0 was statistically superior to placebo. Olz 1.0
      was clinically comparable to placebo in all efficacy comparisons. The only
      adverse event to show an overall statistically significant incidence difference
      was anorexia (reported for 10% of placebo-treated and 0% of Olz10.0-treated
      patients). The Olz10.0-treated patients improved over baseline with respect to
      parkinsonian and akathisia symptoms, and these changes were comparable with those
      observed with placebo. There were no dystonias associated with Olz10.0 treatment.
      At endpoint, the incidence of patients with elevated prolactin values did not
      differ statistically significantly between placebo-treated and Olz10.0-treated
      patients. Olanzapine appears to be not only safe and effective, but a promising
      atypical antipsychotic candidate.

TI  - Mechanical lesions of the fimbria fornix in rat brain studied by 1H-magnetic
      resonance imaging. Evidence for long-lasting dynamic alterations in the
      ipsilateral ventricular system.
PG  - 21-7
AB  - In vivo 1H-NMR imaging was employed to study dynamic changes in the status of
      tissue water as a function of time after mechanical brain injury induced by
      partial unilateral transection of the fimbria fornix (FF) in the rat brain and
      was correlated with histology. Changes in the brain tissue were reproducibly
      found in distinct regions which were exclusively located in the lesioned
      hemisphere. The most pronounced changes concerned the lateral ventricle.
      Ventricular enlargement became evident posterior to the site of transection after
      a few hours and was maximal after 2-4 days. At later time points the posterior
      ventricular expansion was reduced. The lateral ventricle anterior to the site of 
      transection was significantly enlarged from day 1 and continued to expand for up 
      to 7 months. Tissue response at the site of transection, mainly involving the
      hippocampal formation and the thalamus, was first manifested after 24 h, while
      signs of progressive tissue degeneration were apparent in the long term.

TI  - Carbamazepine use in children and adolescents with features of attention-deficit 
      hyperactivity disorder: a meta-analysis.
PG  - 352-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In the United States approximately 750,000 children receive
      psychostimulants to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); up to 
      25% may not respond. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the reports in the
      international literature concerning the efficacy of carbamazepine (CBZ) in
      children with ADHD features by means of meta-analysis. METHOD: A review of the
      world literature located 29 reports that dealt with behavior problems, activity
      levels, and CBZ in children. Of these, only 10 reports provided sufficient or
      pertinent information for the meta-analysis. RESULTS: In all seven open studies, 
      therapeutic responses were significant (ranging from p = .05 to .0001, two-tailed
      t test). Meta-analysis using weighted variables revealed a significant positive
      correlation (r = .88; p < .02) between duration of treatment and positive
      outcome. In three double-blind placebo-controlled studies, treatment effects for 
      CBZ's superiority over placebo ranged from p = .07 to .0001. A meta-analysis of
      these three studies revealed that CBZ was significantly (p = .018) more effective
      than placebo at controlling target symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the general
      lack of attention that CBZ has received for treating ADHD, there is preliminary
      evidence that CBZ may be an effective alternate treatment in children with
      features of ADHD.

TI  - Therapy of alcohol withdrawal syndrome in intensive care unit patients following 
      trauma: results of a prospective, randomized trial.
PG  - 414-22
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of three different alcohol withdrawal therapy
      regimens in traumatized chronic alcoholic patients with respect to the duration
      of mechanical ventilation and the frequency of pneumonia and cardiac disorders
      during their intensive care unit (ICU) stay. DESIGN: A prospective, randomized,
      blinded, controlled clinical trial. SETTING: A university hospital ICU. PATIENTS:
      Multiple-injured alcohol-dependent patients (n=180) transferred to the ICU after 
      admission to the emergency room and operative management. A total of 180 patients
      were included in the study; however, 21 patients were excluded from the study
      after assignment. INTERVENTIONS: Patients who developed actual alcohol withdrawal
      syndrome were randomized to one of the following treatment regimens:
      flunitrazepam/clonidine (n=54); chlormethiazole/haloperidol (n=50); or
      flunitrazepam/haloperidol (n=55). The need for administration of medication was
      determined, using a validated measure of the severity of alcohol withdrawal
      (Revised Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol Scale).
      MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The duration of mechanical ventilation and major
      intercurrent complications, such as pneumonia, sepsis, cardiac disorders,
      bleeding disorders, and death, were documented. Patients did not differ
      significantly between groups regarding age, Revised Trauma and Injury Severity
      Score and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score on admission.
      In all except four patients in the flunitrazepam/clonidine group, who continued
      to hallucinate, the Revised Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol 
      Scale decreased to <20 after initiation of therapy. ICU stay did not
      significantly differ between groups (p=.1669). However, mechanical ventilation
      was significantly prolonged in the chlormethiazole/haloperidol group (p=.0315)
      due to an increased frequency of pneumonia (p=.0414). Cardiac complications were 
      significantly (p=.0047) increased in the flunitrazepam/clonidine group.
      CONCLUSIONS: There was some advantage in the flunitrazepam/clonidine regimen with
      respect to pneumonia and the necessity for mechanical ventilation. However, four 
      (7%) patients had to be excluded from the study due to ongoing hallucinations
      during therapy. Also, cardiac complications were increased in this group. Thus,
      flunitrazepam/haloperidol should be preferred in patients with cardiac or
      pulmonary risk. Further studies are required to determine which therapy should be
      considered.

PG  - 417-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the side effect +profiles of 
      clozapine and risperidone. METHOD: The subjects were 20 outpatients with
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were clinically stable on a regimen
      of clozapine at the time of screening. They underwent a randomized-order
      crossover comparison of 6 weeks of risperidone treatment and 6 weeks of clozapine
      treatment. Clinical and neurocognitive variables were assessed by raters blind to
      medication status, and severity of side effects was determined from patients'
      self-reports. RESULTS: Side effect measures, but not clinical ratings, were
      significantly different after 6 weeks of treatment with the two drugs. Patients
      required more benztropine for motor effects and complained of more insomnia with 
      risperidone and more sedation with clozapine. Body weight was higher at the end
      of clozapine treatment than at the end of risperidone treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      this exploratory study, the side effect profiles of clozapine and risperidone
      were consistent with the different pharmacodynamic profiles of the two drugs.

TI  - Antipsychotic and anxiolytic properties of risperidone, haloperidol, and
      methotrimeprazine in schizophrenic patients.
PG  - 38-44
AB  - The subjects were 62 patients hospitalized for acute exacerbations of
      schizophrenia and were randomly assigned to receive risperidone (mean dose, 7.4
      mg/day), haloperidol (7.6 mg/day), or methotrimeprazine (100 mg/day) for 4 weeks.
      Clinical improvement, defined a priori as a 20% reduction in total Positive and
      Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores at end point, was attained by 81% of the
      risperidone patients, 60% of the haloperidol patients, and 52% of the
      methotrimeprazine patients (p < 0.05). The reductions in total PANSS and Clinical
      Global Impression Scale severity scores from baseline to end point were
      significantly greater in the risperidone patients than in the other two groups.
      Reductions in scores on the Psychotic Anxiety Scale were significantly greater in
      the risperidone patients than the methotrimeprazine patients; the difference
      between haloperidol and methotrimeprazine was not significant. Extrapyramidal
      symptoms (scores on the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale) were more severe in 
      the haloperidol patients than in the other two groups, but few differences were
      apparent between risperidone and methotrimeprazine patients. It is concluded that
      risperidone is an effective antipsychotic and anxiolytic agent in schizophrenic
      patients.

TI  - Cerebrospinal fluid homovanillic acid predicts behavioral response to stimulants 
      in 45 boys with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - 125-37
AB  - Central dopaminergic activity has been assumed to play a role in the efficacy of 
      stimulant drugs in attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), although
      supporting evidence has been scant. This study examined baseline cerebrospinal
      fluid (CSF) of boys with ADHD in relation to response to three different
      stimulant drugs. Forty five boys with DSM-III-R-diagnosed ADHD had a lumbar
      puncture before double-blind trials of methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine, and
      placebo. Sixteen also received pemoline as part of a subsequent open trial.
      Stepwise linear regressions determined significant predictors of drug response.
      Our prior report of a positive significant correlation between CSF homovanillic
      acid (HVA) and ratings of hyperactivity on placebo was replicated in a new sample
      of 20 boys. After baseline symptom severity, CSF HVA was the best predictor of
      stimulant drug response, with significant independent contribution to four of the
      ten measures of hyperactivity that changed significantly with medication. Higher 
      HVA predicted better drug response, and lower HVA was associated with worsening
      on some measures. This supports the mediating role of central dopaminergic
      activity in stimulant drug efficacy in childhood hyperactivity.

      acute phase of this study compared three dosage ranges of olanzapine (5 +/- 2.5
      mg/day [Olz-L], 10 +/- 2.5 mg/day [Olz-M], 15 +/- 2.5 mg/day [Olz-H]) to a dosage
      range of haloperidol (15 +/- 5 mg/day [Hal]) and to placebo in the treatment of
      335 patients who met the DSM-III-R criteria for schizophrenia. In overall
      symptomatology improvement (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale [BPRS]-total), Olz-M, 
      Olz-H, and Hal were significantly superior to placebo. In positive symptom
      improvement (BPRS-positive), Olz-M, Olz-H, and Hal were comparable and
      significantly superior to placebo. In negative symptom improvement (Scale for the
      Assessment of Negative Symptoms [SANS]-composite), Olz-L and Olz-H were
      significantly superior to placebo and Olz-H was also significantly superior to
      Hal. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events included somnolence,
      agitation, asthenia, and nervousness. No acute dystonia was observed with
      olanzapine. Treatment-emergent parkinsonism occurred with Olz-H at approximately 
      one-third the rate of Hal, and akathisia occurred with Olz-H at approximately
      one-half the rate of Hal. Prolactin elevations associated with olanzapine were
      not significantly greater than those observed with placebo and were also
      significantly less than those seen with haloperidol.

TI  - [Efficacy and tolerance of risperidone in various doses (report of a study)].
PG  - 50-6
AB  - Risperidone was compared in 2 double blind studies with haloperidol and
      perphenazine in schizophrenic psychoses. According to the maximal daily dose
      achieved the risperidone group was divided in 4 subgroups and the risperidone
      efficacy and tolerability in these groups were compared both mutually and in
      relation to the baseline. With all doses a good global antipsychotic efficacy has
      been observed. There were no statistically significant differences in influencing
      of productive or negative symptoms with exception of significantly more
      pronounced reduction of productive catatonic symptoms with 2 < max < or = 5 mg in
      comparison with doses higher than 15 mg daily. Extrapyramidal symptoms were less 
      frequent with lower doses: with 2 < max < or = 5 mg significantly lower
      occurrence of increased muscle tonus and tremor was found than with higher doses.
      With maximal daily doses above 10 mg antiparkinson drugs had to be applied in
      more patients and in the case of trihexyphenidyl this difference reached a
      statistically significant level.

TI  - A double-blind randomised comparison of the effects of epidural clonidine,
      lignocaine and the combination of clonidine and lignocaine in patients with
      chronic pain.
PG  - 337-43
AB  - Twenty patients with chronic pain who previously had obtained analgesia from
      epidural clonidine and lignocaine agreed to participate in a double-blind
      crossover study of lumbar epidural clonidine (150 micrograms), lignocaine (40 mg)
      and the combination of clonidine (150 microgram) and lignocaine (40 mg), all
      drugs were given in a volume of 3 ml. There were 11 women and 9 men with a mean
      age 53 years (range: 23-78 years); 9 patients had low back and leg pain, 9 had
      neuropathic pain, 1 had pelvic pain and 1 Wegner's granulomatosis. Pain intensity
      and pain relief, as well as sensory and motor blockade, were assessed for 3 h
      following each injection. The combination was reported as the best pain relief by
      12 of the 17 patients who completed all three arms of the study; 4 patients
      reported that clonidine was the best, 1 patient reported that none of the
      injections provided any analgesia and no patient reported that lignocaine was the
      best. SPID analysis revealed a significant difference between the combination and
      lignocaine (P < 0.05) but no other significant difference. TOTPAR analysis
      revealed no significant difference between any of the injections. All 3
      injections produced evidence of neurological blockade; clonidine produced sensory
      blockade in 3 patients and motor blockade in 3 patients. Lignocaine produced
      sensory blockade in 6 patients and motor in 8 patients, while the combination
      produced evidence of neurological blockade in all 17 patients, sensory in 6 and
      motor in 11 patients. Overall there was no relationship between neurological
      blockade and analgesia. The reported side effects appeared to be related to
      clonidine. These data indicate that in these patients with chronic pain epidural 
      clonidine had a supra-additive effect and behaved more like a co-analgesic than a
      pure analgesic.

PG  - 258-63
AB  - The metabolic effects of continuous intravenous (IV) application of the alpha 2
      agonist clonidine were evaluated by assessment of nitrogen economy and
      postaggression endocrine patterns. Twenty-four patients undergoing
      abdominothoracic esophageal cancer resection were studied. Thirteen of these
      patients with alcohol abuse were treated postoperatively with IV clonidine for
      prevention of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Eleven patients who were not treated
      with clonidine served as controls. All patients were treated in a standardized
      manner in regard to surgical technique, balanced anesthesia, and postoperative
      intensive care treatment, including thoracic epidural analgesia with bupivacaine 
      and fentanyl. Isonitrogenous and isocaloric nutrition was comparable in all
      patients. A significantly improved cumulated 6-day nitrogen balance was found in 
      clonidine-treated patients (-1.5 +/- 4.9 g nitrogen) compared to the control
      group (-17.6 +/- 4.2 g nitrogen) (P < 0.05). The main reason for improved
      nitrogen economy may be clonidine-induced growth hormone (GH) release. The
      pattern of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and insulin-like growth factor
      binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) concentrations could support this hypothesis.

      obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
PG  - 677-82
AB  - It has been well established that more than 40 percent of patients with
      obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) do not improve after an adequate trial with
      serotonin uptake inhibitors (SUIs). The first purpose of this trial was to
      compare the short-term efficacy and safety of two different strategies in a
      sample of treatment-refractory OCD patients: dose increase of the ongoing
      treatment versus the addition of another SUI. The second purpose was to
      investigate the short-term efficacy and safety of adjunctive risperidone in
      SUI-refractory OCD patients. Thirty-three OCD patients who were unimproved after 
      a short-term treatment with clomipramine (150 mg/day) were admitted to the study.
      In the first part of the study, the dose increase of clomipramine was compared
      with sertraline addition, in an open-label manner. The addition of sertraline to 
      the ongoing treatment appeared to be more effective and tolerable than the
      clomipramine dose increase. Seven (50%) of the 14 patients who were considered
      nonresponders after the first part of the study, showed good clinical improvement
      and good tolerability after risperidone augmentation. These results suggest that 
      risperidone addition to ongoing SUIs may be useful in augmenting pharmacologic
      response in OCD.

      deficit hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - 207-20
AB  - An experimental research study was done to determine whether an educational
      intervention about attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) would improve 
      a mother's knowledge about ADHD and her feelings of competence as a parent. 20
      low socioeconomic status mothers who had a male child between the ages of 5 and
      11 diagnosed with ADHD and placed on methylphenidate were randomly selected for
      the study. An experimental group of 10 mothers was given a 5-week educational
      intervention on ADHD; the remaining 10 mothers served as a control group.
      Differences between the experimental and non-experimental mothers in knowledge
      and opinions about ADHD and parental sense of competency were measured. Scores
      improved in parental satisfaction and parental sense of competency in mothers who
      participated in the educational intervention. The research findings support the
      idea that nurses can assist a family in learning and dealing with their child's
      ADHD, a chronic condition.

TI  - Cholinergic rebound and rapid onset psychosis following abrupt clozapine
      withdrawal.
PG  - 591-5
AB  - Following the conduct of a 28-day inpatient bioequivalence study of clozapine in 
      schizophrenia patients, withdrawal effects after abrupt discontinuation from
      clozapine were assessed. Thirty patients who met DSM-III-R criteria for
      schizophrenia, residual type, or schizophrenia in remission were enrolled in the 
      study. Patients were evaluated for symptoms of withdrawal effects for 7 days
      after clozapine 200 mg/day was abruptly withdrawn. Of 28 patients who completed
      the study, 11 had no withdrawal symptoms; 12 had mild withdrawal adverse events
      of agitation, headache, or nausea; four patients experienced moderate withdrawal 
      adverse events of nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea; and one patient experienced a
      rapid-onset psychotic episode requiring hospitalization. Cholinergic rebound is a
      likely explanation for the mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms and is easily
      treated with an anticholinergic agent. Mesolimbic supersensitivity, as well as
      specific properties of clozapine, are discussed as likely causes for rapidonset
      psychosis. Our findings are consistent with previous reports of withdrawal
      reactions associated with clozapine, further reminding clinicians to monitor
      patients closely following abrupt discontinuation of clozapine.

TI  - Nicotine and attention in adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
PG  - 67-73
AB  - Nicotine, like the psychostimulants methylphenidate and dextroamphetamine, acts
      as an indirect dopamine agonist and improves attention and arousal. Adults and
      adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) smoke much more 
      frequently than normal individuals or those with other psychiatric conditions,
      perhaps as a form of self-medication for ADHD symptoms. Nicotine might therefore 
      have some value as a treatment for ADHD. The present study is an acute
      double-blind crossover administration of nicotine and placebo with smokers (n =
      6) and nonsmokers (n = 11) diagnosed with adult ADHD. The drug was delivered via 
      a transdermal patch at a dosage of 7 mg/day for nonsmokers and 21 mg/day for
      smokers. Results indicate significant clinician-rated global improvement,
      self-rated vigor and concentration, and improved performance on chronometric
      measures of attention and timing accuracy. Side effects were minimal. These acute
      results indicate the need for a longer clinical trial and a comparison with other
      stimulants in adult ADHD treatment.

PG  - 305-19
AB  - We investigated the separate and combined effects of a behavioral intervention
      and methylphenidate (Ritalin) on disruptive behavior and task engagement in 3
      children with severe to profound mental retardation. The behavioral intervention 
      involved differential reinforcement of appropriate behavior and guided
      compliance. All 3 children demonstrated decreased disruptive behavior and
      improved task engagement in response to the response to the behavioral
      intervention. Two of the 3 children demonstrated similar improvement in response 
      to methylphenidate. Although both interventions were highly effective for these 2
      participants, the relative efficacy of the interventions varied between the 2
      children. There was no evidence of an additive or synergistic effect of the two
      interventions, but the high efficacy of each intervention alone limited our
      ability to detect such effects.

TI  - Clozapine eligibility among state hospital patients.
PG  - 15-25
AB  - Connecticut State Hospital's entire resident population (n = 1,300) was screened 
      on an arbitrary target day to determine eligibility for clozapine. Sixty percent 
      of 803 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder diagnoses met Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA)- approved criteria for clozapine use as judged by
      review of past medication trial records and by the responsible physicians.
      Eighty-eight percent of these patients were medically cleared, and of those
      cleared, 63 percent agreed to clozapine treatment. Of the patients who began a
      clozapine trial, 76 percent were still taking the drug 12 months later.
      Preliminary findings from a randomized trial of clozapine versus usual care (n = 
      227) indicate that discharge rates associated with clozapine and usual care do
      not differ. Once discharged, however, patients assigned to clozapine are less
      likely to be readmitted. Hence, clozapine may be more cost-effective than usual
      care. However, before savings can be realized, State governments will have to
      make up-front investments of approximately $140 million simply to give patients
      hospitalized on a single day a year's access to clozapine.

TI  - [Patient-controlled analgesia with clonidine and piritramide].
PG  - 88-94
AB  - Following parenteral administration, clonidine has analgesic effects at both
      cerebral and spinal levels. Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) makes it possible 
      to determine equipotent dosages of analgesics by relating analgesic consumption
      per time to the levels of analgesia obtained in comparable patient populations.
      Therefore, we studied the equipotency ratios of clonidine and piritramide and the
      incidence of undesired side effects in the treatment of postoperative pain in
      patients undergoing maxillo-facial surgery. METHODS: After approval of the local 
      ethics committee and informed consent 40 patients (age > 18 year, ASA I-III) were
      studied. Following randomization, the patients each received a PCA device
      containing either clonidine (bolus 30 micrograms), or piritramide (bolus 1.5 mg) 
      for treatment of postoperative pain (lockout interval 5 min in both groups).
      During the postoperative period, pain was determined using a visual analogue
      scale, while analgesic consumption, sedation, haemodynamic parameters,
      respiration rate, and the occurrence of undesired side effects were documented
      additionally. RESULTS: The groups had comparable distributions of biometric data,
      duration of anaesthesia, and ASA classification. Pain level decreased
      significantly (P < 0.0001) in both groups during the first 2 h of PCA. Mean
      arterial pressure and heart rate were lower (P < 0.05) in the clonidine group 4
      and 6 h after PCA onset, while the degree of sedation after 2 (P < 0.01) and 6 (P
      < 0.05) h was higher than in the piritramide group. Nausea and vomiting were more
      frequent (P < 0.05) in the piritramide group. Both groups showed a wide
      interpatient variation in analgesic requirement. The equipotency ratio
      clonidine/piritramid was 1:63.7. CONCLUSION: Intravenous clonidine is a potent
      analgesic and is suitable or the treatment of postoperative pain following
      maxillo-facial surgery. The analgesic potency of 150 micrograms clonidine i.v.
      was equivalent to that of 9.56 mg piritramide i.v. Nausea and vomiting occurred
      more rarely in the clonidine group, while deeper sedation was observed more
      frequently than in the piritramide group. Owing to the wide interindividual
      variation of analgesic consumption, clonidine dosages have to be adjusted to the 
      actual requirements.

TI  - Weight gain induced by clozapine.
PG  - 437-40
AB  - Patients were investigated to gain more insight into the incidence and time
      course of clozapine induced weight gain (n = 81) and to compare weight gain in
      patients treated with clozapine (n = 31) with that of patients treated with
      standard antipsychotics (haloperidol, n = 11). 35.7% of the patients treated with
      clozapine gained weight according to our definition. If patients gained weight on
      clozapine this side effect was apparent within the first 12 weeks of treatment.
      Deviation from normal body weight at the beginning of treatment showed a
      significant influence on weight gain. Sex, severity of illness, comedication,
      mean clozapine dose and degree of improvement did not show an influence on this
      side effect. Weight increase was significantly higher in patients treated with
      clozapine than in patients treated with haloperidol.

TI  - Prophylaxis of alcohol withdrawal syndrome in alcohol-dependent patients admitted
      to the intensive care unit after tumour resection.
PG  - 734-9
AB  - Prophylaxis of alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) in alcohol-dependent patients
      shortens the duration of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). The objective of 
      this study was to assess the effect of four different prophylactic regimens on
      the duration of ICU stay, prevention of AWS and rate of major intercurrent
      complications in alcohol-dependent patients admitted to the ICU after tumour
      resection. A total of 197 alcohol-dependent patients, diagnosed by the Diagnostic
      and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (third revised edition) with a daily
      ethanol intake of 60 g, were allocated randomly to one of the following regimens 
      which were commenced on admission to the ICU: flunitrazepam-clonidine,
      chlormethiazole-haloperidol, flunitrazepam-haloperidol or ethanol. The duration
      of ICU stay, prevention of AWS, incidence of tracheobronchitis and major
      intercurrent complications such as pneumonia, sepsis, cardiac disorders, bleeding
      disorders and death were documented. On admission, patients did not differ
      significantly in age, APACHE II and multiple organ failure scores. ICU stay,
      incidence of AWS, severity of AWS (revised clinical institute withdrawal
      assessment for alcohol scale > 20) and major intercurrent complication rate did
      not differ significantly between groups. Although there was no advantage in any
      of the four regimens with respect to the primary outcome measures, pulmonary and 
      cardiac patients were not included in the study. Patients in the
      chlormethiazole-haloperidol group had a significantly increased incidence of
      tracheobronchitis (P = 0.0023), probably because of an increased incidence of
      hypersecretion.

TI  - Epidural clonidine or sufentanil for intraoperative and postoperative analgesia.
PG  - 1154-62
AB  - This study contrasts the efficacy and side effects of epidural clonidine and
      sufentanil in the perioperative period. Using a randomized, prospective,
      double-blind study design, 40 patients undergoing abdominal surgery under
      propofol/nitrous oxide anesthesia were enrolled. Before anesthesia, an epidural
      catheter was inserted at the L1-L2 interspace. At induction of anesthesia, the
      patients received epidurally either clonidine (4 micrograms/kg in 10 mL) infused 
      in 20 min followed by a 2-micrograms.kg-1.h-1 infusion (5 mL/h) during 12 h
      (Group 1) or sufentanil (0.5 microgram/kg in 10 mL) in 20 min followed by a
      0.25-microgram.kg-1.h-1 infusion (5 mL/h) during 12 h (Group 2).
      Intraoperatively, increases in arterial blood pressure and heart rate not
      responding to propofol bolus (0.5 mg/kg) were treated with a bolus of intravenous
      (IV) sufentanil 0.035 microgram/kg. Postoperatively, IV sufentanil boluses (5
      micrograms) were given through a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) device.
      Postoperative analgesia was assessed by recording the IV PCA sufentanil
      requirements and the patients' visual analog scale (VAS) at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36,
      and 48 h. Sedation analog scales and side effects were also recorded. Plasma
      clonidine and sufentanil concentrations were measured after 20 min and 6, 12, and
      24 h. The number of reinjections of propofol (n = 1.6 +/- 1.6 in Group 1 vs 6.5
      +/- 4.0 in Group 2) and of IV sufentanil (n = 0.6 +/- 0.8 in Group 1 vs 3.8 +/-
      3.7 in Group 2) was significantly reduced (P < 0.001) in the epidural clonidine
      group. In the early postoperative period, pain scores and rescue analgesic
      requirements were very low in both groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - Seventeen children with attention deficit disorder (ADHD) and 10 normal controls 
      performed two tasks while event-related potentials were recorded. ADHD subjects
      took part in two more sessions under methylphenidate (MP) or placebo. In the
      spatial orienting task, invalidly cued targets elicited a longer reaction time
      (RT) and a P3 that was longer in latency and greater in amplitude than did
      validly cued targets. Performance was similar for both groups, but the early
      portion of P3 (300-400 ms) was lower in amplitude for invalidly cued targets in
      ADHD subjects. MP increased accuracy without affecting RT and shortened P3 peak
      latency and increased the amplitude of its early portion. In the focused
      attention task, accuracy was greater for controls and MP, but there were no RT
      differences. Attended stimuli elicited greater amplitude P1, N1, and P3 than did 
      nonattended stimuli, but these measures were unaffected by diagnosis or
      medication.

TI  - Clonidine plus haloperidol in the treatment of schizophrenia/psychosis.
PG  - 361-4
AB  - Because of the evidence for increased norepinephrine (NE) production in psychotic
      patients, we studied the effects of combining the alpha 2-adrenergic agonist
      clonidine with haloperidol for the treatment of schizophrenic psychosis. Twelve
      hospitalized schizophrenic patients were taken off their antipsychotic medication
      for 2 to 4 weeks before double-blind treatment with haloperidol (20 mg/day)
      combined with either clonidine or placebo. The group receiving clonidine was
      significantly more improved on the thought disorder subscale of the Brief
      Psychiatric Rating Scale (p = 0.02). The groups differed initially in the level
      of negative symptoms, but not controlling for this difference statistically by
      analysis of covariance did not change the finding with regard to the superiority 
      of combining clonidine with haloperidol. We conclude that larger treatment trials
      of combining haloperidol with clonidine are warranted.

TI  - [Comparative study of clonidine and lidocaine on the attenuation of the
      intraocular pressure increase associated with laryngoscopy and endotracheal
      intubation].
PG  - 312-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To verify and compare the efficacy of clonidine and lidocaine for
      attenuating the ocular hypertensive response generated by manipulation of the
      laryngoscope and endotracheal intubation (EIT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this
      prospective double blind study 45 patients undergoing non-ocular surgery were
      divided into 3 groups according to pretreatment protocol: A, approximately 3
      micrograms/kg clonidine orally 90-120 min before surgery; B, 1.5 mg/kg
      intravenous lidocaine 1 min before EIT and C, control group. On all patients we
      recorded intraocular pressure (IOP), mean arterial pressure and heart rate at the
      following times: basal, just before EIT, immediately after EIT, 5 minutes later
      and 10 minutes later. RESULTS: The patients pretreated with clonidine had
      significantly lower IOP levels than did the control group at all measurements
      times; patients pretreated with lidocaine had lower IOP after induction and after
      intubation. IOP was significantly lower in patients who received lidocaine than
      in control group patients after EIT, although IOP levels with lidocaine were
      higher than with clonidine. CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment with oral clonidine is an
      effective method for preventing increases in IOP after EIT, is more effective
      than pretreatment with lidocaine, and should therefore be used for that end.
      Intravenous lidocaine represents a valid alternative in emergency cases when the 
      approximate wait time of 2 hours is contraindicated.

TI  - Short-term efficacy of apraclonidine hydrochloride added to maximum-tolerated
      medical therapy for glaucoma. Apraclonidine Maximum-Tolerated Medical Therapy
      Study Group.
PG  - 423-32
AB  - PURPOSE: We determined whether the addition of topical apraclonidine
      hydrochloride to eyes that are receiving maximal medical therapy but still have
      inadequate intraocular pressure control and that are scheduled to undergo surgery
      could adequately decrease intraocular pressure, postponing the need for further
      intervention. METHODS: We performed a prospective, 90-day, multicentered,
      placebo-controlled, double-masked parallel study. We enrolled one eye each of 174
      glaucoma patients with inadequate intraocular pressure control who were on
      maximally tolerated medical therapy. We continued to administer maximum medical
      therapy for glaucoma. Study medications were either apraclonidine hydrochloride
      0.5% or placebo (apraclonidine's vehicle). Patients were instructed to take the
      study medication every eight hours. We measured intraocular pressure, change in
      intraocular pressure from baseline, and the number of eyes requiring surgery
      after the addition of study medication. RESULTS: Fifty-two (60%) of 86 patients
      treated with apraclonidine maintained adequate intraocular pressure control
      throughout the study and avoided surgery, compared with 28 (32%) of 88 patients
      treated with placebo (P < .001). Apraclonidine treatment resulted in
      significantly more patients attaining an additional 20% reduction or more in
      intraocular pressure from baseline and an intraocular pressure less than or equal
      to 20 mm Hg (P < .05). The most common ocular complication was conjunctival
      hyperemia (11 of 86 patients, 12.8%). The most frequent nonocular problem was dry
      mouth (four patients, 4.7%). CONCLUSION: Apraclonidine appeared to be safe in all
      eyes and efficacious in some eyes. It significantly lowered intraocular pressure 
      when used in combination with maximally tolerated medical therapy, which delayed 
      or prevented further glaucoma surgery for at least 90 days in 52 (60%) of 86
      treated patients.

TI  - Apraclonidine and anterior segment laser surgery. Comparison of 0.5% versus 1.0% 
      apraclonidine for prevention of postoperative intraocular pressure rise.
PG  - 1312-8
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy of 0.5% and 1.0% apraclonidine in preventing
      laser-induced intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation after trabeculoplasty,
      neodymium: YAG (Nd: YAG) iridotomy, and capsulotomy. METHODS: This is a
      prospective, masked, and randomized study of 83 patients undergoing
      trabeculoplasty, 62 patients undergoing iridotomy, and 57 patients undergoing
      capsulotomy. Surgical eyes received one drop of 0.5% or 1.0% apraclonidine
      immediately after surgery. RESULTS: Intraocular pressure reduced 2 hours after
      trabeculoplasty in the 0.5% (P = 0.028) and 1.0% (P = 0.004) groups. Intraocular 
      pressure was higher than baseline in a greater number of eyes treated with 0.5%
      (12 of 39 eyes, 31%) compared with 1.0% apraclonidine (5 of 44 eyes, 11%) (P =
      0.032). Intraocular pressure in eyes with a narrow chamber angle was reduced in
      16 (85%) of 19 eyes treated with 0.5% and in 10 (84%) of 12 eyes treated with
      1.0% apraclonidine after iridotomy. Of patients with chronic angle-closure
      glaucoma, IOP was similar to prelaser values in 11 (69%) of 16 eyes treated with 
      0.5% (P > 0.7) and 12 (80%) of 15 eyes treated with 1.0% apraclonidine (P > 0.3).
      In patients undergoing capsulotomy, pressure was significantly lowered in the
      0.5% group (P = 0.04) but not in the 1.0% apraclonidine group. After capsulotomy,
      both treatment groups had similar (P > 0.3) numbers of eyes with an IOP less than
      baseline (83% for 0.5% apraclonidine and 81% for 1.0% apraclonidine). CONCLUSION:
      The single postoperative administration of 0.5% apraclonidine is as effective as 
      the 1.0% concentration in preventing IOP elevation immediately after
      trabeculoplasty, iridotomy, or capsulotomy.

      attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - 320-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the effects on behavior and sleep of
      methylphenidate (MPH) administered at 4 PM to children with attention-deficit
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). METHODOLOGY: Twelve children admitted to a child
      psychiatric inpatient service with ADHD participated in a double-blind, crossover
      study in which they received a 4 PM dose of either 15 mg of MPH, 10 mg of MPH, or
      a placebo in random order for 12 consecutive days. Ratings of behavior, including
      ADHD symptoms, pertaining to the period from dose administration until sleep
      onset, were supplied nightly by hospital staff. Sleep latency and sleep adequacy 
      were also assessed for each night. RESULTS: MPH resulted in markedly improved
      behavioral control compared with placebo; there was no difference between 15-mg
      and 10-mg MPH doses. MPH did not alter sleep latencies observed with the placebo.
      Children were more often rated as less tired on awakening after nights that they 
      received 10 mg of MPH compared with 15 mg of MPH and the placebo. Weight loss was
      apparent among 83% of the patients, but dinner intake did not vary with
      third-dose condition. CONCLUSIONS: Morning and noon administration of stimulants 
      to children with ADHD is a near-universal practice, but many clinicians avoid a
      third, late-afternoon administration for fear of inducing insomnia. This study's 
      findings show that children with ADHD derive substantial symptom reduction from
      MPH administered in late afternoon, with no untoward effects on sleep. Therefore,
      three-times-a-day dosing should be considered for those children exhibiting ADHD 
      symptoms in the evening. Adverse effects on sleep latency were not apparent in
      the sample overall. Nonetheless, monitoring for possible aggravation of sleep
      problems and weight loss remains sound treatment practice.

TI  - Pharmacotherapy of adult attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder: a review.
PG  - 270-9
AB  - Adult attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is an increasingly
      recognized disorder with associated psychiatric comorbidity and impairment.
      Although pharmacotherapy serves an important role in treating ADHD and other
      concurrent psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents, the use of
      pharmacotherapeutics for adults with ADHD remains less established. In this
      report, the effectiveness and dosing parameters of the various agents
      investigated for adult ADHD are reviewed. A systematic review of the available
      literature identified 7 studies (N = 193 subjects) of psychostimulants and 10
      studies of nonstimulant medications (N = 167 subjects) including antidepressants,
      antihypertensives, and amino acids for the treatment of ADHD in adults. The
      majority of double-blind investigations were with the psychostimulants, with the 
      nonstimulant agents, generally antidepressants, studied under open conditions.
      There was considerable variability in diagnostic criteria, dosing parameters, and
      response rates between the various studies. Under controlled conditions, the
      aggregate literature shows that the stimulants had a clinically and statistically
      significant effect on reducing ADHD symptoms. Open studies on the nonserotonergic
      antidepressants (tricyclics, bupropion, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors) also
      show a moderate anti-ADHD effect. The literature appears to support the use of
      robust doses of both stimulants and antidepressants for ADHD in adults. Further
      controlled studies applying stringent diagnostic criteria and outcome methodology
      are necessary to define the range of pharmacotherapeutic options for adults with 
      ADHD.

TI  - Epidemiology of the adverse hemodynamic events occurring during "clonidine
      anesthesia": a prospective open trial of intraoperative intravenous clonidine.
PG  - 403-10
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Determine the hemodynamic consequences of intraoperative
      clonidine during major abdominal surgery. DESIGN: Prospective open trial.
      SETTING: Teaching hospital. PATIENTS: 402 consecutive patients scheduled for
      major abdominal surgery. INTERVENTIONS: 350 consecutive patients received
      intravenous (IV) clonidine (loading dose of 4 micrograms/kg in 20 minutes at
      anesthesia induction, followed by a continuous infusion of 2 micrograms/kg/h
      until the end of surgery). Fifty-two additional patients served as controls.
      Anesthetic technique consisted of balanced anesthesia (isoflurane, fentanyl,
      atracurium). ECG, invasive arterial blood pressure (BP), expiratory PCO2 and
      pulse oximetry were continuously recorded. Hemodynamic events (HEs) were defined 
      as moderate for a 20% reduction of the baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) or 
      a heart rate (HR) decreasing between 50 beats per minute (bpm) and 40 bpm. A 30% 
      reduction of the baseline SBP or a HR below 40 bpm was considered an important
      HE. The rate and duration of these events were recorded from induction to
      recovery. HEs requiring a specific treatment were noted. Central venous pressure,
      volume of fluid infused, and urinary output were also recorded. MEASUREMENTS AND 
      MAIN RESULTS: 21% of control patients and 31% of clonidine patients had no
      adverse HEs. A moderate reduction of the baseline BP was the most common episode 
      in both groups. The incidence of the HEs (moderate and important) was similar in 
      both groups but the duration HEs was significantly longer in the clonidine
      patients (p < 0.05). 40% of the control patients and 13% of the clonidine
      patients required specific management for their HEs (p < 0.05), the most common
      of which was hypotension without bradycardia. Neither coexisting pathology nor
      preoperative medications influenced the incidence of HEs. CONCLUSION: IV
      clonidine can be used routinely during anesthesia for major abdominal surgery.

TI  - Is there a relationship between clozapine and obsessive-compulsive disorder?: a
      retrospective chart review.
PG  - 267-70
AB  - The emergence of obsessive-compulsive symptoms during clozapine treatment has
      been reported in recent case studies, yet the incidence and significance of this 
      finding is still unclear pending reliable data from a larger sample of patients. 
      Hospital records of 142 randomly selected inpatients started on clozapine
      treatment at McLean Hospital before July 1, 1992, were reviewed retrospectively. 
      Based on a limited retrospective chart review, there were no definitive cases of 
      patients who developed obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or whose OCD worsened 
      as a result of clozapine treatment. Although some fluctuation of OCD symptoms may
      have occurred in two cases, it is unclear whether those symptoms were related to 
      treatment with clozapine (or other psychotropic drugs) or to undulations in the
      natural history of OCD. No definitive relationship between OCD symptoms and
      clozapine treatment could be established in this limited study. Further
      clarification of this matter awaits outcome research using prospective
      methodologies.

TI  - Efficacy of methylphenidate for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in
      children with tic disorder.
PG  - 444-55
AB  - BACKGROUND: The findings from case reports and patient questionnaire surveys have
      been interpreted as indicating that administration of stimulants is ill-advised
      for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children with
      tic disorder. METHODS: Thirty-four prepubertal children with attention-deficit
      hyperactivity disorder and tic disorder received placebo and three dosages of
      methylphenidate hydrochloride (0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 mg/kg) twice daily for 2 weeks
      each, under double-blind conditions. Treatment effects were assessed using direct
      observations of child behavior in a simulated (clinic-based) classroom and using 
      rating scales completed by the parents, teachers, and physician. RESULTS:
      Methylphenidate effectively suppressed hyperactive, disruptive, and aggressive
      behavior. There was no evidence that methylphenidate altered the severity of tic 
      disorder, but it may have a weak effect on the frequency of motor (increase) and 
      vocal (decrease) tics. CONCLUSION: Methylphenidate appears to be a safe and
      effective treatment for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in the majority 
      of children with comorbid tic disorder.

TI  - Amphetamine on Rorschach measures in normal subjects.
PG  - 456-65
AB  - Twenty-two normal undergraduate men were administered either d-amphetamine (0.2
      mg/kg or 0.4 mg/kg) or placebo in a double-blind, counterbalanced design. The
      test sessions were exactly three weeks apart and included, among other measures, 
      the Rorschach test. Rorschach anxiety and thought disorder variables were
      measured under drug and placebo conditions. The results suggest that amphetamine 
      causes an increase in Rorschach anxiety indices but does not elevate Rorschach
      indices of thought disorder. The observed dissociation of anxiety and thought
      disorder on the Rorschach has implications for the role of the Rorschach in
      studying anxiety disorders and schizophrenic disorders.

      multi-national, multi-centre, double-blind, parallel-group study versus
      haloperidol. Risperidone Study Group.
PG  - 712-26; discussion 727-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was performed in order to evaluate the short-term efficacy
      and safety of fixed risperidone doses compared to haloperidol. METHOD: In a
      multi-national, parallel-group, double-blind study, patients with chronic
      schizophrenia (DSM-III-R) were randomly assigned to risperidone 1, 4, 8, 12 or 16
      mg or haloperidol 10 mg daily for 8 weeks. Efficacy was assessed by the Positive 
      and Negative Syndrome Scale for schizophrenia (PANSS) and clinical global
      impression (CGI), and safety primarily by the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale
      (ESRS). RESULTS: One thousand three hundred and sixty-two patients were
      evaluated. The optimum risperidone doses were 4 mg and 8 mg, with response rates 
      of 63.4% (56.8%; 69.7%) and 65.8% (59.2%; 71.9%) respectively. Response rate in
      haloperidol-treated patients was 58.7% (52.0%; 65.3%); the 95% confidence
      intervals (CI) of the differences between risperidone 4 mg or 8 mg and
      haloperidol were (- 4.3%; 13.7%) and (- 1.9%; 16.0%) respectively. There were no 
      significant differences in CGI scores at endpoint between risperidone 4 mg, 8 mg,
      12 mg and 16 mg and haloperidol (3.0, 3.0, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.1 respectively); the
      95% CI of the differences between risperidone 4 mg or 8 mg and haloperidol were (
      - 0.4; 0.1) and ( - 0.3; 0.2) respectively. Mean shifts to the maximum total ESRS
      scores versus baseline (mean (confidence interval)) were significantly greater in
      haloperidol-treated patients (5.1 (4.0; 6.2)) than in the risperidone 1, 4, 8 and
      12 mg groups (1.1 (0.3; 1.9); 1.8 (0.9; 2.7); 2.7 (1.8; 3.6) and 3.2 (2.3; 4.1)
      respectively (P < 0.05)). CONCLUSION: Risperidone is an effective antipsychotic
      for the treatment of chronic schizophrenia; doses of 4 and 8 mg seem to be
      optimal and have a lower incidence of side-effects than haloperidol.

TI  - Epidural clonidine analgesia for intractable cancer pain. The Epidural Clonidine 
      Study Group.
PG  - 391-9
AB  - Although the vast majority of patients with cancer pain receive effective
      analgesia from standard therapy, a few patients, particularly those with
      neuropathic pain, continue to experience severe pain despite large doses of
      systemic or intraspinal opioids. Animal studies suggest intraspinal alpha
      2-adrenergic agonists may be effective in such cases. Eighty-five patients with
      severe cancer pain despite large doses of opioids or with therapy-limiting side
      effects from opioids were randomized to receive, in a double-blind manner, 30
      micrograms/h epidural clonidine or placebo for 14 days, together with rescue
      epidural morphine. Pain was assessed by visual analog score (VAS), McGill Pain
      Questionnaire, and daily epidural morphine use. Success was defined as a decrease
      in either morphine use of VAS pain, with the alternative variable either
      decreasing or remaining constant. Blood pressure, heart rate, and degree of
      nausea and sedation were monitored. Successful analgesia was more common with
      epidural clonidine (45%) than with placebo (21%). This was particularly prominent
      in those with neuropathic pain (56% vs. 5%). Pain scores were lower at the end of
      the treatment period in patients with neuropathic pain treated with clonidine
      rather than placebo, whereas morphine use was unaffected. Clonidine, but not
      placebo, decreased blood pressure and heart rate. Hypotension was considered a
      serious complication in 2 patients receiving clonidine and in 1 patient receiving
      placebo. This study confirms the findings from previous animal studies which
      showed the effective, potent analgesic properties of intraspinal alpha
      2-adrenergic agonists and suggests that epidural clonidine may provide effective 
      relief for intractable cancer pain, particular of the neuropathic type.

TI  - Common drugs may influence motor recovery after stroke. The Sygen In Acute Stroke
      Study Investigators.
PG  - 865-71
AB  - Studies in laboratory animals indicate that certain centrally acting drugs (eg,
      the antihypertensives clonidine and prazosin, neuroleptics and other dopamine
      receptor antagonists, benzodiazepines, and the anticonvulsants phenytoin and
      phenobarbital) impair behavioral recovery after focal brain injury. Even single
      doses may have long-term harmful effects. To determine whether these medications 
      have a similar negative impact in humans, we analyzed the recoveries of control
      patients who were enrolled in the Sygen in Acute Stroke Study, a multicenter
      study of the effects of GM1 ganglioside after ischemic stroke. Motor impairments 
      were measured by the motor subscores of the Toronto Stroke Scale at baseline and 
      7, 14, 21, 28, 56, and 84 days after stroke. Using these data, we compared motor 
      recovery between patients with initial motor deficits who received at least one
      of the drugs that interfere with recovery in laboratory studies ("detrimental"
      drug group, n = 37) and patients who did not receive these drugs ("neutral" drug 
      group, n = 59). The groups were well balanced with regard to the frequency of
      comorbid conditions and other prognostic factors. For upper-extremity motor
      function, repeated-measures ANOVA showed a significant interaction between drug
      group and time after stroke [F(6,528) = 2.38; p = 0.03], with a significant (p < 
      0.001) difference between the groups beginning 7 days after the stroke. A similar
      trend was present for the lower extremity, but the overall difference between the
      groups was not significant [ANOVA F(6,498) = 1.22; p = 0.29]. Drug group did
      influence the degree of independence in activities of daily living as measured
      with the Barthel Index.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - The efficacy of guanfacine in reducing perioperative hemodynamic changes and
      volatile anesthetic requirement.
PG  - 211-8
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of guanfacine, an alpha 2-adrenergic
      agonist, for attenuating hemodynamic changes associated with tracheal intubation 
      or extubation, providing intraoperative hemodynamic stability, and reducing
      inhalation anesthetic requirement in patients undergoing gynecologic surgery.
      DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. SETTING: Inpatient
      gynecology at a university hospital. PATIENTS: 45 women (ASA I) undergoing
      elective abdominal hysterectomy. INTERVENTIONS: Guanfacine and placebo
      supplementation. Oral guanfacine at 0.5 or 1 mg or a placebo (control) 3 hours
      before induction of anesthesia. Anesthesia was induced with thiamylal 5 mg/kg and
      vecuronium 0.2 mg/kg, and maintained with isoflurane and 50% nitrous oxide (N2O) 
      in oxygen. The inspired isoflurane concentration was maintained at 1% during the 
      first 5 minutes following induction of anesthesia and titrated to the
      concentration required to maintain hemodynamic stability [defined as +/- 10% of
      systolic blood pressure (SBP)]. The end-tidal concentration of isoflurane was
      monitored throughout anesthesia. On completion of surgery, N2O and isoflurane
      were discontinued. Following confirmation of recovery from anesthesia and muscle 
      relaxation, the endotracheal tube was removed. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:
      Patients in the control group showed significant increases in SBP and diastolic
      blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR) associated with tracheal intubation 50
      +/- 5, 57 +/- 6.3, and 45 +/- 4.6 (%, mean +/- SEM, p < 0.05 for any variables), 
      respectively. Plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine concentrations increased to
      382 +/- 40 pg/ml and 49 +/- 4.2 pg/ml, respectively (p < 0.05 compared with basal
      values). These changes were attenuated in patients receiving 1 mg of guanfacine
      (29 +/- 4.2, 33 +/- 4.5, 25 +/- 3.2, 210 +/- 32, and 22 +/- 3.5, respectively (p 
      < 0.05 for any variables compared with placebo group). Higher inspired
      concentrations of isoflurane (%) were required in the control and 0.5 mg
      guanfacine-treated groups (1.2 +/- 0.05 and 1.0 +/- 0.04, respectively) than in
      the 1 mg guanfacine-treated group (0.62 +/- 0.03) for hemodynamic stability (p < 
      0.05). Coefficient of variation in HR changes during surgery was 17.2, 13.9, and 
      8.8 in the placebo, guanfacine 0.5 mg, and guanfacine 1 mg treated groups,
      respectively. Compared with placebo, guanfacine 1 mg reduced the maximum changes 
      (mean +/- SEM) in SBP (7 +/- 1.2 vs. 18 +/- 2.2) and in HR (23 +/- 2.1 vs. 44 +/-
      3.6) occurring during tracheal extubation. The incidence of perioperative
      complications was similar among the three groups. CONCLUSION: Guanfacine 1 mg
      administered orally proved to be an effective premedicant for providing
      intraoperative hemodynamic stability, attenuating the increase in BP and HR
      associated with tracheal intubation and extubation, and reducing anesthetic
      requirements without increasing the incidence of perioperative complications.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of risperidone in the long-term treatment of patients with
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 402-12
AB  - The long-term efficacy and safety of risperidone were evaluated in patients with 
      chronic schizophrenia in an open-label study. Thirty-two patients received
      risperidone for 1 year and 19 of the 32 received risperidone for 2 years. The
      mean dose of risperidone was 9.4 mg/d in the 1-year follow-up. At the end of 1
      and 2 years, improvements were found in total scores on the Positive and Negative
      Syndrome Scale (PANSS), on four PANSS factors (positive, negative, excited, and
      cognitive), and the Clinical Global Impression scale. Severity of extrapyramidal 
      symptoms (based on scores on the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale) was also
      reduced. Clinical improvement (defined as a 20% or more reduction in total PANSS 
      scores) was shown by 54% of the patients at end point. Social functioning (as
      assessed by using the modified Strauss/Carpenter scale) was significantly
      improved after 2 years. Number of days spent in hospitals was significantly
      reduced during the 2 years of treatment, and the number of days in treatment
      (group) homes significantly increased. It is concluded that treatment with
      risperidone for 1 and 2 years is associated with significant reductions in
      symptoms of schizophrenia, improved social functioning, and reduction in days
      spent in the hospital.

TI  - ICI 204,636, a novel, atypical antipsychotic: early indication of safety and
      efficacy in patients with chronic and subchronic schizophrenia.
PG  - 366-78
AB  - We evaluated the effects of ICI 204,636 in 12 hospitalized patients with
      schizophrenia in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, rising-dose 
      study. Patients met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
      Third Edition, Revised criteria for chronic or subchronic schizophrenia and had a
      total score > or = 30 on the 18-item Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and a 
      score > or = 3 on the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Severity of Illness item. 
      Patients received 21 days of double-blind treatment with increasing doses of ICI 
      204,636 (25 to 250 mg/d) or placebo. Efficacy was assessed using the BPRS and
      CGI. Response to treatment was defined as a > or = 30% decrease in the BPRS total
      score from baseline. Extrapyramidal symptoms and abnormal involuntary movements
      were assessed using the Simpson Scale and Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale.
      Changes from baseline in the BPRS and CGI were significantly greater at end point
      for patients who received ICI 204,636 versus placebo (BPRS, -20.9 vs -4.8; CGI,
      -2.9 vs -1.0; P < 0.05, analysis of covariance; P < or = 0.06, Wilcoxon rank sum 
      test). All patients in the ICI 204,636 group responded to treatment (P < 0.10)
      versus only two patients in the placebo group. Mild somnolence occurred in 50% of
      ICI 204,636-treated patients. No treatment-emergent extrapyramidal symptoms or
      dystonic reactions were observed. ICI 204,636 showed efficacy in the positive and
      negative symptoms of schizophrenia and was well tolerated.

      attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - 211-33
AB  - Six boys aged 9 to 12 years attended a tutoring class focusing on reading for 30 
      minutes each morning. The investigators employed a modified Latin-square design
      in which each child began with a 5-day baseline phase followed by six 10-day
      treatment phases that used drug placebo, noncontingent reinforcers, 0.3 mg/kg
      methylphenidate, 0.7 mg/kg methylphenidate, and self-reinforcement in various
      combinations. Amount of academic performance was the major measure of outcome and
      the target behavior of self-reinforcement. Drug placebo and noncontingent
      reinforcers had no systematic impact. Methylphenidate had differential effects
      across the recorded behaviors. Self-reinforcement improved the target behavior;
      the mean effect size for self-reinforcement was 2.66. The combined effects of
      methylphenidate and self-reinforcement on academic performance were greater than 
      either of the treatments given alone (mean effect size = 2.89).

TI  - Methylphenidate and cognitive flexibility: dissociated dose effects in
      hyperactive children.
PG  - 235-66
AB  - A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to assess the 
      acute effects of placebo and three doses of methylphenidate (MPH) (0.3, 0.6, 0.9 
      mg/kg) on cognitive flexibility and overt behavior in 28 children with a
      confirmed diagnosis of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder. Two underlying
      cognitive processes (response inhibition and response reengagement) were assessed
      by measuring the probability and speed with which subjects could inhibit
      responses to a primary task (forced-choice letter discrimination) and immediately
      execute a response to a secondary task (simple reaction time) when given a signal
      to do so. Results indicated that MPH enhanced cognitive flexibility, although the
      high dose was less effective than lower doses in enhancing response inhibition.
      Dissociations of dose effects on cognitive function and behavior were
      demonstrated: Dose-response functions for changes in behavior were linear,
      whereas the function for response inhibition was U-shaped. Findings argue against
      the typical clinical practice of determining the response to stimulant treatment 
      from a single measure such as parent report of child behavior.

TI  - Risperidone versus zuclopenthixol in the treatment of acute schizophrenic
      episodes: a double-blind parallel-group trial.
PG  - 271-7
AB  - A double-blind, randomized, multi-center, parallel-group study was conducted in
      Finland to compare the efficacy and safety of risperidone with zuclopenthixol in 
      patients with acute exacerbations of schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder. 
      Ninety-eight patients were randomly assigned to treatment with risperidone (n =
      48) or zuclopenthixol (n = 50), in variable doses, for 6 weeks. The mean daily
      doses of risperidone and zuclopenthixol at the end of the trial were 8 mg and 38 
      mg respectively. Efficacy was assessed throughout by the Positive and Negative
      Syndrome Scale for schizophrenia and Clinical Global Impression. Safety
      assessments included the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale, UKU Side-Effect
      Rating Scale, vital signs, body weight and laboratory screening. The results
      indicate that risperidone is at least as effective as zuclopenthixol for the
      treatment of acute schizophrenic episodes, with a trend towards greater
      improvement in the overall severity of symptoms. The onset of action was
      significantly shorter with risperidone than with zuclopenthixol. Although the
      general tolerability of the two drugs was comparable, fewer patients experienced 
      extrapyramidal symptoms with risperidone, so that significantly fewer
      risperidone-treated patients required antiparkinsonian medication.

TI  - The efficacy of apraclonidine as an adjunct to timolol therapy. Apraclonidine
      Adjunctive Therapy Study Group.
PG  - 287-92
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering efficacy of 0.5%
      and 1.0% apraclonidine hydrochloride when used adjunctively with 0.5% timolol
      maleate in 129 patients. DESIGN: A multicenter, randomized, double-masked
      clinical trial. Adult patients of either sex diagnosed as having either
      open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were enrolled in the study. Patients
      using only 0.5% timolol maleate twice daily for at least 4 weeks and who had 8 AM
      IOPs of at least 22 mm Hg and no greater than 30 mm Hg 12 hours after dosing were
      eligible for the study. After 8 AM baseline IOPs were obtained while patients
      were taking timolol only, they were then randomized to receive either 0.5% or
      1.0% apraclonidine twice daily in addition to their timolol. Intraocular
      pressures were measured at 8 AM (before morning dosing) and at 11 AM (3 hours
      after dosing) on days 14 and 90 and at 8 AM only on day 45. RESULTS: Both
      concentrations of apraclonidine produced significant IOP reductions from baseline
      at all visits (P < .001). At 8 AM, after the nighttime dose, the additional mean 
      IOP reduction from the timolol baseline ranged from 2.5 to 3.3 mm Hg (10.3% to
      13.6% reduction, respectively). At 11 AM, 3 hours after the morning dose, the
      additional IOP reduction from the timolol baseline ranged from 4.7 to 5.2 mm Hg
      (20.0% to 21.7%, respectively). No difference in IOP reduction was observed
      between the 0.5% and 1.0% apraclonidine concentrations and no loss of IOP
      efficacy was observed for either concentration for the duration of the study.
      Sensitivity to 0.5% and 1.0% apraclonidine was observed in nine (13.8%) and 13
      (20.3%) patients, respectively. Overall, therapy was discontinued owing to ocular
      or nonocular side effects with 0.5% and 1.0% apraclonidine in 14 (21.5%) and 16
      (25%) patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that 0.5% apraclonidine is 
      equally effective as 1.0% apraclonidine when used twice daily as the first
      adjunctive drug to timolol. The drug effect is maintained for at least 90 days.

TI  - Effectiveness of apraclonidine and acetazolamide in preventing postoperative
      intraocular pressure spikes after extracapsular cataract extraction.
PG  - 191-5
AB  - We studied the effectiveness of two prophylactic agents in controlling early
      postoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) increases after cataract surgery.
      Fifty-four nonglaucomatous patients received either topical 1% apraclonidine, one
      drop before and after surgery, or sustained-release acetazolamide, 500 mg, or no 
      medication at the completion of planned extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE).
      Mean baseline IOPs were similar among patients randomized to the apraclonidine,
      acetazolamide, and control groups: 15.29 mm Hg, 15.33 mm Hg, and 14.26 mm Hg,
      respectively. At 3 hours postoperatively, IOPs were significantly lower in the
      apraclonidine group (11.13 mm Hg, P = .035), nonsignificantly lower in the
      acetazolamide group (13.3 mm Hg, P = .17), and significantly increased in the
      control group (21.32 mm Hg, P = .003). One eye in the apraclonidine group and six
      in the control group had IOPs greater than 30 mm Hg. At 24 hours, the only
      statistically significant difference was in the control group, whose mean IOPs
      remained elevated (21.83 mm Hg, P = .0008). One eye in the apraclonidine group,
      two in the acetazolamide group, and five in the control group had IOPs greater
      than 30 mm Hg. We found a significant early IOP reduction with apraclonidine
      given topically preoperatively and at the completion of planned ECCE.

TI  - Epidural clonidine combined with bupivacaine for analgesia in labor. Effects on
      mother and neonate.
PG  - 113-20
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A double-blind study was conducted to assess the
      efficacy and the safety of epidural clonidine combined with bupivacaine for
      analgesia during labor. METHODS: Two groups of pregnant healthy women were
      allocated randomly to receive either 10 mL 0.125% bupivacaine plain solution
      (group B, n = 10) or with 75 micrograms clonidine (group B + C, n = 12). Visual
      analog scale (VAS) scores were measured over 30 minutes after each epidural
      injection. Patients were monitored with an automated blood pressure device
      (Dinamap and a pulse oximeter), and fetal heart rate was measured with a
      cardiotocograph. Plasma clonidine concentrations were measured at birth in
      mothers and in the umbilical cord by radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: Visual analog
      scale scores were significantly lower in patients who received clonidine.
      Patients required a second epidural injection after 55 +/- 9 minutes in group B
      and 127 +/- 11 minutes in group B + C (P < .05). Visual analog scale scores were 
      also significantly lower in group B + C than in group B, after the second
      injection. Decreases in arterial blood pressure were comparable in the two
      groups, and no patient experienced arterial oxygen desaturation or bradycardia.
      Fetal heart rate was decreased in group B + C at the time of the second
      injection. The duration of labor after epidural administration was prolonged in
      group B + C patients compared to group B (282 +/- 43 minutes and 169 +/- 26
      minutes, respectively, P < .05). Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes were similar in 
      both groups. Plasma clonidine concentrations were, respectively, 0.31 +/- 0.16
      ng/mL 60 minutes after the first injection and 0.62 +/- 0.13 ng/mL at birth in
      mothers while plasma umbilical cord concentrations were 0.56 +/- 0.12 ng/mL.
      CONCLUSIONS: The study documents that clonidine improves epidural bupivacaine
      analgesia during labor and demonstrates transfer of the drug across the placenta.
      Therefore, a more extensive study is required to determine the incidence of
      possible side effects of clonidine in neonates.

TI  - Beta-blockers and the treatment of aggression.
PG  - 274-81
AB  - This review assesses the usefulness of beta-blockers in the treatment of
      aggression and describes the parameters for their clinical use. A Medline search 
      using the terms "beta-blockers," "aggression," "propranolol," and "brain injury" 
      identified relevant journal articles published in English between 1977 and 1993. 
      Open, prospective and double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, as well as case
      reports, were included. Beta-blockers appear to be effective in decreasing the
      frequency and intensity of aggressive outbursts associated with a wide variety of
      conditions, such as dementias, attention-deficit disorder, personality disorders,
      Korsakoff's psychosis, posttraumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, profound
      mental retardation, autism, and brain injury. A general discussion attempts to
      resolve some of the issues surrounding the possible mechanisms of beta-blocker
      effects, reviews the anatomic and neurochemical bases of aggression, and explores
      implications of the clinical use of beta-blockers.

TI  - Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and substance abuse: relationships and
      implications for treatment.
PG  - 246-58
AB  - Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and substance-use disorders are
      related to each other in a variety of ways. Although within the child-psychiatry 
      literature earlier investigations were inconsistent regarding such a link, recent
      prospective studies that followed hyperactive children and normal controls into
      adulthood have found that hyperactive adults with a history of ADHD are more
      likely than controls to have substance-use disorders. The substance-abuse
      literature is less consistent regarding the potential association between ADHD
      and substance abuse. However, recent studies suggest that persons with a
      substance-use disorder, and particularly those with a cocaine-use disorder, may
      be more likely than the general population to have a childhood history of ADHD.
      Some of the inconsistency regarding this association is due to differences in
      diagnostic criteria, type of assessments used, and reliability of information
      obtained. Each of the potential relationships that may exist between ADHD and
      substance abuse has treatment implications for the clinician. Pharmacological as 
      well as nonpharmacological approaches deserve further investigation. Because
      pharmacotherapy is a central component in the treatment of childhood ADHD,
      clinicians designing a strategy to treat both a substance-use disorder and ADHD
      need to consider pharmacological interventions. At present, the literature on
      pharmacological treatment for childhood ADHD is extensive and that for adult ADHD
      is growing; information regarding the treatment of cocaine abuse and concomitant 
      ADHD symptoms remains limited.

PG  - 593-606
AB  - This article reviews the evidence for the efficacy and effectiveness of
      risperidone in persons with schizophrenia. Nine published double-blind studies
      compare risperidone with another antipsychotic medication and/or placebo. All
      were conducted in the acute phase of illness. Risperidone's antipsychotic
      efficacy is shown to be consistently superior to that of placebo and at least
      comparable to that of haloperidol and perphenazine for patients in the acute
      phase of schizophrenia. Further research is necessary to determine the
      effectiveness of risperidone and its efficacy both as a maintenance treatment and
      in treatment-refractory and deficit-state patients.

      Apraclonidine Maximum Tolerated Medical Therapy Study Group.
PG  - 421-38; discussion 439-41
AB  - OBJECT: We determined whether the addition of topical apraclonidine hydrochloride
      to eyes receiving maximal medical therapy, with inadequate intraocular pressure
      (IOP) control, and scheduled to undergo surgery, could adequately lower IOP,
      postponing the need for surgical intervention. DESIGN: A prospective 90 day,
      multi-centered, placebo-controlled, doublemasked parallel study. PATIENTS: We
      enrolled 174 glaucoma patients with inadequate IOP control on maximally tolerated
      medical therapy. All were candidates for either laser trabeculoplasty or invasive
      surgical intervention. We enrolled only one eye per patient. INTERVENTIONS: We
      continued to administer maximum-tolerated medical therapy for glaucoma. Patients 
      took the study medication every eight hours. Study medications were either
      apraclonidine hydrochloride 0.5% or placebo (apraclonidine's vehicle). MAJOR
      OUTCOME MEASURES: We evaluated IOP, IOP change from baseline, and the number of
      eyes requiring surgery after the addition of study medication. RESULTS: Sixty one
      percent of patients treated with apraclonidine maintained adequate IOP control
      throughout the study, avoiding additional surgery compared to 33.9% patients
      treated with placebo (P < .001). Apraclonidine treatment resulted in
      significantly more patients achieving either an additional > or = 20% reduction
      in IOP from baseline (resulting in an IOP < or = 20 mm Hg) (P < 0.05). The most
      common ocular complications were conjunctival hyperemia (12.6%), itching and
      foreign body sensation (6.8%), and tearing (4.5%). The most frequent non-ocular
      adverse events related to apraclonidine were dry mouth (4.5%) and unusual taste
      perception (2.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Apraclonidine appears safe and efficacious. It
      significantly lowered IOP when used in combination with a patient's maximum
      tolerated medical therapy. This delayed or prevented further glaucoma surgery for
      at least 90 days in approximately 60% of treated patients.

TI  - Postoperative analgesia after co-administration of clonidine and morphine by the 
      intrathecal route in patients undergoing hip replacement.
PG  - 86-91
AB  - Postoperative analgesia after intrathecal co-administration of clonidine
      hydrochloride (75 micrograms) and morphine sulfate (0.5 mg) was compared with
      analgesia produced after either intrathecal morphine (0.5 mg) or 0.9% sodium
      chloride in 90 patients undergoing total hip replacement under bupivacaine spinal
      anesthesia. Patient-controlled morphine requirements were significantly reduced
      (P < 0.001) postoperation by both clonidine/morphine (median 5 mg/24 h) and
      morphine (median 7 mg/24 h) compared with control (saline) (median 28 mg/24 h).
      However, no significant additional reduction in postoperative analgesic
      requirements was shown with the clonidine/morphine combination compared with
      morphine alone. Visual analog pain scores, although good in all groups at all
      times, were significantly poorer in the control group at 2 h (P < 0.04) and 4 h
      (P < 0.001) after operation compared with both treatment groups, and
      significantly poorer than the clonidine/morphine group at 6 h (P < 0.002) and 24 
      h (P < 0.009) postoperation. Mean arterial blood pressure was significantly lower
      in the clonidine/morphine group than in the two other groups (P < 0.001) between 
      2 and 5 h after operation. The incidence of emesis was similar in the
      clonidine/morphine and morphine groups and was significantly more than in the
      control group.

TI  - The treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in Tourette's syndrome:
      a double-blind placebo-controlled study with clonidine and desipramine.
PG  - 74-81
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Because psychostimulants can exacerbate preexisting motor/phonic tics
      in individuals with Tourette's syndrome (TS), a clinical trial was performed to
      examine the ability of clonidine and desipramine to modify attention-deficit
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) behaviors in children with TS + ADHD. METHODS: A
      double-blind, placebo-controlled protocol was used in which each subject served
      as his or her own control and received, in a randomly assigned fashion, 6-week
      medication cycles with clonidine (0.05 mg four times daily), desipramine (25 mg
      four times daily), and placebo. RESULTS: Thirty-seven children with TS+ADHD
      between the ages 7 to 13 years and of normal intellect were recruited, and 34 (31
      males, 3 females) completed the entire protocol. Outcome measures for ADHD
      included Parent and Teacher Child Behavior Checklists (CBCL), continuous
      performance tests, and neuropsychologic tests of executive function. Several
      markers for ADHD were shown to improve significantly (P < .05) after treatment
      with desipramine (parent linear analogue rating, parent CBCL "hyperactivity"
      subscale, and teacher CBCL subscales "nervous/overactive," "anxious," and
      "unpopular"). Improvement with desipramine was always superior to that noted with
      clonidine. Clinical improvement did not correlate with drug blood levels. On
      measures of tic severity, neither drug made tics worse. Desipramine showed a
      statistically significant improvement on a global linear analogue scale, but not 
      on the Hopkins Motor/Vocal Tic Severity Scale, the Tourette Syndrome Severity
      Scale, or the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale. Clonidine did not significantly
      alter tic severity on any measure. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest 
      that desipramine may be a useful alternative for the treatment of symptoms of
      ADHD in children with TS.

TI  - Growth rate and growth hormone response to growth hormone-releasing hormone
      challenge in slowly growing children during chronic administration of clonidine.
PG  - 63-7
AB  - In this study the effects of chronic administration of clonidine, an
      alpha-2-adrenergic agonist, on the growth rate and GH response to GHRH in 12
      "slowly growing" children were reported. Clonidine was administered at the dose
      of 0.04 mg/m2 body surface twice daily along 12 months. The protocol of the study
      consisted in five periods of growth rate, insulin-like growth factor-1, basal and
      GHRH-stimulated GH level evaluation: 1) 6-month pretreatment (P1); 2) 6-month
      placebo administration (PO); 3) after 4 months of therapy (P1); 4) after 4 months
      of clonidine withdrawal (P2); 5) after 4 months of therapy reinstatement (P3). No
      difference was observed between P-1 and P0 when all the parameters were
      considered. During P1 a significant increase of linear growth (p < 0.05 vs P0 and
      P-1) was observed while standard deviation of height was not modified. At the end
      of P2, the growth rate and standard deviation of height were similar to those
      recorded in P0 and P-1. After reinstatement of clonidine therapy a new but less
      pronounced rise of the growth rate was found (p < 0.05 vs P1, p < 0.01 vs P0 and 
      P-1). GH, insulin-like growth factor-1, GHRH-stimulated GH levels had
      significantly increased during P1 than P0 and P-1 (p < 0.05), while during P2
      they were similar to P0 and P-1. During P3 a new increase of insulin-like growth 
      factor-I baseline and GHRH-stimulated GH levels were observed. However, these
      were significantly lower than those observed during P1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

TI  - Clonidine and opiate receptor antagonists in the treatment of heroin addiction.
PG  - 35-41
AB  - Good results in detoxification methods have been reached using both together
      clonidine and opiate receptors antagonists. One hundred fifty-two heroin-abusing 
      patients were studied evaluating withdrawal symptoms after therapy with (a)
      clonidine only, (b) clonidine and naltrexone, (c) clonidine and naloxone, and (d)
      placebos. Treatment results, emotional and behavioral changes, and involvement in
      psychosocial programs were evaluated after a 6-month follow-up. Although opiate
      antagonists were able to induce slight and transient withdrawal signs and
      symptoms, there was, in the group of patients treated with clonidine and
      naltrexone together, a low percentage of catabolites in urine and an improvement 
      in mood and family relationships. Furthermore, the patients that underwent longer
      naltrexone treatment showed a stronger involvement in psychosocial programs, and 
      even their relatives demonstrated more interest in the recovery program. A
      decrease in the difficulties of accepting an opiate antagonists treatment and a
      different evaluation of withdrawal syndrome were the results of an early use of
      naltrexone.

TI  - Addition of clonidine to epidural morphine enhances postoperative analgesia after
      cesarean delivery.
PG  - 57-61
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The randomized, double-blind, dose-response study was 
      designed to evaluate the effects of the addition of clonidine to epidural
      morphine on postoperative analgesia and side effects in patients undergoing
      cesarean delivery. METHODS: Sixty patients, undergoing cesarean delivery under
      epidural anesthesia, were randomly divided in three equal groups to receive, at
      the end of surgery, an epidural analgesic mixture consisting of 10 mL solution
      containing 2 mg of morphine diluted with 0.125% bupivacaine plus 1:800,000
      epinephrine and 0, 75, or 150 micrograms of clonidine. Duration of analgesia was 
      assessed as the pain-free interval between the end of surgery and patient's first
      analgesic request. The analgesic mixture was repeated, on patient's request, to
      36 hours after the operation. Arterial blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory
      rate, and side effects were noted. The total amount of morphine and clonidine
      delivered was also noted. RESULTS: The addition of clonidine (0, 75, or 150
      micrograms) to morphine significantly increased the duration of postoperative
      analgesia (P < .0001) (6.27 versus 13.25 and versus 21.55 hours) and reduced the 
      mean total dose of morphine (9.40 mg versus 5.0 mg versus 3.60 mg) (P < .0001).
      No significant differences in side effects were noted. CONCLUSIONS: A low dose of
      clonidine such as 75 micrograms doubled the duration of analgesia produced by 2
      mg of morphine and a dose of 150 micrograms further increased the duration of
      postoperative complete analgesia without increasing the incidence of side
      effects. The morphine requirements during the postoperative period (36 hours) was
      greatly reduced by the addition of clonidine to the analgesic epidural mixture.

TI  - Effects of methylphenidate in HIV-related depression: a comparative trial with
      desipramine.
PG  - 53-67
AB  - This report is a randomized, double-blind, comparative trial of desipramine with 
      the psychomotor stimulant methylphenidate. Twenty HIV antibody-positive patients 
      with depressive symptoms were randomly assigned to either drug. After individual 
      dose titration, the mean daily dose of desipramine was 150 mg. and
      methylphenidate 30 mg. daily. The differences in responses between desipramine
      and methylphenidate were not statistically significant on various measures of
      depression. The antidepressant effect of methylphenidate did not occur any faster
      than that of desipramine. Both significantly reduced depressive and anxious
      symptomatology over the blinded portion of the treatments. Thus, methylphenidate 
      relieves depressive symptomatology with efficacy similar to that of desipramine, 
      offering an alternative to patients who are unable to tolerate standard tricyclic
      antidepressant therapy. The dopaminergic effects of methylphenidate are likely to
      mediate its antidepressant effects.

      From the chart review, thirty-four out of eighty male patients were identified to
      have reported loss of libido, erectile difficulty, anorgasmia, and delayed
      ejaculation while receiving pharmacotherapy of selective serotonin reuptake
      blockers (fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline); tricyclic antidepressants
      (nortriptyline, imipramine, amitriptyline, desipramine, and clomipramine); and a 
      monoamine oxidase inhibitor (phenelzine). METHOD: The authors also discussed the 
      management of these sexual side effects by waiting for spontaneous remission,
      reducing the dosage level, and substituting the offending drug with other
      antidepressants. RESULTS: This article underscores the underreported nature of
      antidepressant-associated sexual dysfunction, the high incidence of
      SSRI-associated sexual side effects, equal potentials in causing sexual side
      effects among the three SSRI's, the low incidence rate of sexual adverse effects 
      from bupropion, and the minimal need to add an antidote if the side effects are
      to be managed systematically. CONCLUSIONS: Finally, male sexual side effects can 
      occur randomly and involve any sexual phase randomly, and the treatment
      approaches are similar, regardless of the types of sexual dysfunction associated 
      with antidepressants.

AB  - This study investigated the utility of the Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm 
      (PSAP), a computerized laboratory analog aggression measure. We measured the
      effects of methylphenidate (MPH) on aggressive responding in children with a
      DSM-III-R diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), who had
      high ratings on the Child Behavior Checklist Aggression Factor (CBCL; Achenbach
      1991). Results are reported for 6 subjects, ages 8-11 years. All were tested at
      baseline in an unmedicated condition, and after double-blind administration of
      placebo, 0.3 mg/kg of MPH, and 0.6 mg/kg of MPH. A main effect of decreased
      aggressive responding with MPH was found, with a dose-related change by repeated 
      measures ANOVA (F = 6.59, df = 2.10, p = .014). Post-hoc analysis with the Tukey 
      HSD indicated that only the 0.6 mg/kg was significantly (p < .05) different than 
      placebo. Implications for use of the PSAP in future investigations of medications
      in aggressive children are discussed.

TI  - A comparison of European and American dosing regimens of schizophrenic patients
      on clozapine: efficacy and side effects.
PG  - 315-20
AB  - We present a comparison of the results from two studies of patients on clozapine.
      The American study (n = 84; Hillside Hospital, Glen Oaks, NY) and the European
      study (n = 63; Innsbruck University Clinics, Innsbruck, Austria) both examine
      efficacy and side effects in schizophrenic patients on this atypical neuroleptic.
      There is a very substantial difference in the dosing regimen used on both
      continents and this is reflected in the studies reported. A question with major
      clinical implications is whether the higher doses commonly used in the United
      States lead to a better outcome or a different profile of side effects. Outcome
      as a function of serum concentration will be examined. Results confirm a lower
      dose, lower clozapine blood level, and a lesser degree of side effects in the
      Austrian cohort when compared to the American sample. Surprisingly, the clinical 
      efficacy of the lower dosing regimen was superior to the higher dose. Reasons for
      this anomaly are explored.

TI  - Clonidine and lidocaine inhibition of isoflurane-induced tachycardia in humans.
PG  - 1341-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: A rapid increase in isoflurane concentration can induce tachycardia
      and hypertension and increase plasma catecholamine concentrations. To investigate
      a possible mechanism, we measured hemodynamic responses to isoflurane
      administered via mask; we also administered clonidine for premedication,
      lidocaine topically to the nasal mucosa, or lidocaine intravenously to evaluate
      the effect of these drugs on the hemodynamic responses. METHODS: Forty ASA
      physical status 1 patients (aged 20-30 yr) scheduled for elective oral surgery
      participated in the study. Thirty patients were randomly allocated to one of
      three groups: a control group, a group receiving 3-4 micrograms.kg-1 of oral
      clonidine for premedication, and a group receiving 2 ml of 4% lidocaine spray to 
      the nasal mucosa. Ten patients were assigned nonrandomly to a group receiving
      intravenous lidocaine continuously (0.4 mg.kg-1 bolus followed by 30
      micrograms.kg-1.min-1) after the initial randomized experiments were done to test
      whether systemic lidocaine blunts the responses to inhaled isoflurane. Anesthesia
      was induced with thiamylal, after which inhalation of 1% isoflurane in 100%
      oxygen via mask was begun. The inspired concentration of isoflurane was increased
      by 1% every 5 min to a maximum of 4%. During normocapnia and without surgical
      stimulation, heart rate and systolic blood pressure were measured every minute
      for 20 min before and during isoflurane inhalation. Plasma catecholamine
      concentrations were measured before and at each isoflurane concentration.
      RESULTS: In the control and intravenous lidocaine groups, an increase in
      isoflurane concentration from 2% to 3% significantly increased systolic blood
      pressure (peak changes of 16 +/- 5 and 15 +/- 6 mmHg, respectively) and heart
      rate (peak changes of 23 +/- 3 and 13 +/- 4 beats.min-1, respectively). A change 
      in concentration to 4%, however, did not significantly alter hemodynamics. Blood 
      pressure and heart rate responses to a change to 3% isoflurane were significantly
      blunted in the groups receiving clonidine (peak changes of 4 +/- 4 mmHg and 8 +/-
      3 beats.min-1, respectively) or nasal lidocaine (peak changes of 2 +/- 1 mmHg and
      4 +/- 2 beats.min-1, respectively) compared with the control group. In all
      groups, plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations increased after
      administration of 2% and 1% isoflurane, respectively. Plasma lidocaine
      concentrations were 0.3-1.3 micrograms.kg-1 in the nasal lidocaine group and
      0.6-1.5 micrograms.kg-1 in the intravenous lidocaine group. CONCLUSIONS: Stepwise
      increases in isoflurane concentration elicited hypertension and tachycardia as
      well as increments in plasma catecholamine concentrations during mask anesthesia.
      Nasal administration of lidocaine and clonidine premedication significantly
      blunted the circulatory responses to isoflurane. Intravenous lidocaine did not
      significantly weaken the responses to changes in isoflurane concentration.

TI  - Premedication with oral and transdermal clonidine provides safe and efficacious
      postoperative sympatholysis.
PG  - 1133-40
AB  - We studied 61 patients undergoing elective major non-cardiac surgery in a
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-control clinical trial to test the hypothesis
      that the addition of clonidine to a standardized general anesthetic could safely 
      provide postoperative sympatholysis for patients with known or suspected coronary
      artery disease. Patients were allocated randomly to receive either placebo (n =
      31) or clonidine (n = 30). The treatment group received premedication with a
      transdermal clonidine system (0.2 mg/d) the night prior to surgery, which was
      left in place for 72 h, and 0.3 mg oral clonidine 60-90 min before surgery.
      Clonidine reduced enflurane requirements, intraoperative tachycardia, and
      myocardial ischemia (1/28 clonidine patients vs 5/24 placebo, P = 0.05). However,
      clonidine decreased heart rates only during the first five postoperative hours;
      the incidence of postoperative myocardial ischemia (6/28 clonidine vs 5/26
      placebo) did not differ between the two groups. Patients who experienced
      postoperative myocardial ischemia tended to have higher heart rates after
      surgery. Clonidine significantly reduced the plasma levels of epinephrine (P =
      0.009) and norepinephrine (P = 0.026) measured on the first postoperative
      morning. There were no differences in the need for intravenous fluid therapy or
      antihypertensive therapy after surgery. The number of hours spent in an intensive
      care setting and the number of days spent in hospital were not different between 
      the two groups. These results suggest that larger doses of clonidine should be
      investigated for their ability to decrease postoperative tachycardia and
      myocardial ischemia.

TI  - Balanced postoperative analgesia: effect of intravenous clonidine on blood gases 
      and pharmacokinetics of intravenous fentanyl.
PG  - 1126-32
AB  - Agonist interactions in antinociceptive effects between clonidine and opioids can
      be used to reduce opioid requirements in surgical patients. However, clonidine
      can cause marked sedation and associated respiratory dysfunction. Thus, the
      benefit of using clonidine to reduce opioid use on respiration is questionable.
      This double-blind randomized study compared the analgesic efficacy, arterial
      blood gases, and pharmacokinetics of an intravenous (IV) infusion of fentanyl 75 
      micrograms/h and a mixture of fentanyl 25 micrograms/h plus clonidine 0.3
      micrograms.kg-1.h-1 in 32 healthy young adults after surgery for scoliosis
      correction. Oxygen saturation (FIO2: 0.21) and respiratory rate were monitored as
      well as supplemental analgesia demands (IV ketoprofen via a patient-controlled
      device), pain, sedation, and hemodynamics. Oxygen and naloxone (5
      micrograms.kg-1.min-1) were administered, respectively, if more than three
      episodes of oxygen saturation less than 90% were observed within 10 min and if
      PaCO2 was higher than 50 mm Hg. Pain relief, sedation, and ketoprofen
      requirements were similar in both groups. The number of episodes of arterial
      desaturation less than 90% (> 20 s) was 106 for four patients in the fentanyl
      group (versus none in the clonidine-fentanyl group). Naloxone was required in six
      patients and oxygen in two patients of the fentanyl group (versus none in the
      group receiving clonidine). Dopamine, 10 micrograms.kg-1.min-1, was required in
      one patient of the clonidine-fentanyl group to correct hypotension. Mean arterial
      blood pressure, plasma clearance, and the elimination rate constant of fentanyl
      were lower in the clonidine-fentanyl group than in the fentanyl group.(ABSTRACT

PG  - 1121-5
AB  - The prolonging effects of oral clonidine on sensory block during tetracaine
      spinal anesthesia were studied in 47 healthy patients scheduled for urologic or
      gynecologic surgery. All patients received 15 mg tetracaine intrathecally in
      isobaric saline. The patients were randomly allocated into four groups. Group 1
      (n = 13) was administered 0.25 mg triazolam orally. Group 2 (n = 12), Group 3 (n 
      = 12), and Group 4 (n = 10) received 75 micrograms, 150 micrograms, and 300
      micrograms of oral clonidine, respectively. These drugs were administered 1 h
      before anesthesia. Sensory block was evaluated by pinprick. All regression times 
      in Groups 2, 3, and 4 were significantly longer than those in Group 1. The
      prolonging effect of oral clonidine increased in a dose-dependent manner and
      reached a maximal effect at 150 micrograms. Four patients in Group 4 developed
      bradycardia (heart rate < 45 bpm), suggesting that the dose of 300 micrograms of 
      oral clonidine may promote bradycardia during spinal anesthesia.

      anesthesia. Groups 2, 3, and 4 were administered 150 micrograms oral clonidine
      just before anesthesia or 1 h and 3 h before anesthesia respectively. Sensory
      block was assessed by pinprick. Groups 2 and 3 had a significantly prolonged time
      of sensory block (74%-94%, P < 0.01) when compared with Group 1. However, the
      prolonging effect of oral clonidine was not apparent in Group 4. We conclude
      that, when administered within 1 h before anesthesia, oral clonidine, at a dose
      of 150 micrograms, produced a significant prolongation of tetracaine spinal
      anesthesia without adverse effects.

      This did not differ significantly from the 69 per cent response rate for children
      with ADHD and other neurodevelopmental disorders. The results confirm and add to 
      the research literature indicating that ADHD children who are of preschool age

TI  - [Clozapine and refractory schizophrenia. Long-term prospective study of 20
      patients].
PG  - 767-75
AB  - Clozapine, a dibenzodiazepine derivative, has potent antipsychotic activity. But 
      bone marrow suppression resulting in agranulocytosis has been associated with
      clozapine treatment; thus its clinical development has been delayed and the
      administration of this drug has been restricted to treatment-resistant
      schizophrenic patient. This report describes an open prospective study of the
      effects of clozapine on symptomatology of patients who are refractory to
      neuroleptics. Authors prospectively followed up until 36 months, 20 DSM III-R
      schizophrenic patients who had failed to respond to various neuroleptics (7.7 +/-
      3.0). When clozapine treatment was initiated, the mean duration of the illness
      was 17 +/- 10 years. Various scales were used for evaluation: total BPRS, BPRS
      "positive symptoms", BPRS "negative symptoms", PANSS positive and PANSS negative 
      were realized at days 0 and 15, months 1, 2 and 3 and then every 3 months.
      Significative improvements in total BPRS, BPRS positive symptoms and PANSS
      positive were noted at day 15 (p < 0.005, p < 0.026, p < 0.02, respectively);
      clozapine produced significant improvement on the BPRS negative symptoms and the 
      PANSS negative at 1 month (p < 0.03 and p < 0.008, respectively). Side effects
      were studied: dry mouth was more prominent in the first month after wash-out
      (15%), while salivation was more and more prevalent (20% within the first month; 
      53% beyond). There was no agranulocytosis in this cohort; 2 cases (10%) of
      eosinophilia occurred during the first month; 20% of the patients experienced an 
      increase in total white blood cell count (> 12.000/mm3). Weight gain (> 5 kg)
      affected 32% of patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

PG  - 199-210
AB  - Levels of calcium in plasma, red blood cells, and mononuclear blood cells, levels
      of calcium in plasma, and the plasma calcium-to-magnesium ratio were measured at 
      baseline and after 3 weeks of each drug phase of a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study of methylphenidate and dextroamphetamine in hyperactive 
      boys. Levels of magnesium in plasma were significantly higher after 3 weeks of
      dextroamphetamine treatment, and the calcium-to-magnesium ratio was significantly
      lower after 3 weeks of either drug compared with the baseline or placebo
      condition. There was no change in magnesium levels in red blood cells or
      mononuclear blood cells. These measures were obtained 30 minutes before the
      morning dose and at 9 a.m., 9:30 a.m., 10:30 a.m., 11:00 a.m., and noon on the
      last day of each 3-week phase. Analysis of variance revealed a drug effect on
      plasma magnesium and on the calcium-to-magnesium ratio but no drug x time
      interaction. Although these changes were not correlated with the time course of
      acute symptomatic response to stimulant therapy, the decrease in the ratio may be
      relevant to side effects and treatment resistance associated with stimulant use.

TI  - Risperidone and clozapine in the treatment of drug-resistant schizophrenia and
      neuroleptic-induced supersensitivity psychosis.
PG  - 1129-41
AB  - 1. Supersensitivity psychosis (SSP) has emerged as a potential side effect of
      long-term neuroleptic therapy similar to tardive dyskinesia (TD). 2. Six
      schizophrenic patients with SSP, considered to be drug-resistant, were treated
      with risperidone, while another 5 were treated with clozapine. 3. The 6
      risperidone-treated patients (all women) were rated on the Clinical Global
      Impression Improvement Scale as at least very much improved. Among the 5
      clozapine-treated patients, all 4 men were found to have a marked response to
      clozapine, while the female patient was judged to be minimally improved. 4. It is
      hypothesized that not only TD but also SSP arise from destruction of cholinergic 
      interneurons in the striatum as a consequence of prolonged neuroleptic
      administration. Thus, the drug-induced parkinsonism, which was proposed as
      mediating the antipsychotic effect of dopamine D2 blocking drugs, depends on the 
      integrity of these cholinergic neurons. If these neurons are destroyed, drugs
      such as haloperidol lose their therapeutic effect. 5. In contrast, atypical
      neuroleptics like clozapine and risperidone reduce dopamine release in the
      striatum independently of prior production of extrapyramidal symptoms and, in
      this way, may be effective in psychotic illnesses unresponsive to classical
      anti-D2 neuroleptics. 6. In the present sample of patients, it is worth noting
      that schizophrenic men were good responders to clozapine. In comparison,
      risperidone was found to be efficacious in schizophrenic women.

PG  - 470-87
AB  - Using a combination of an alternating treatment and double-blind
      placebo-controlled drug design, the independent and combined effects of two
      behavioral interventions and two doses of methylphenidate (MPH) in 3 children
      with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and mental retardation (MR) 
      were assessed. In this single subject design, 2 of the 3 subjects responded
      positively to medication as measured by increased on-task behavior. The first
      behavioral intervention, a token economy for on-task behavior, was ineffective
      for increasing either on-task behavior or work accuracy when combined with
      placebo. However, improvement in work accuracy was realized with implementation
      of a second behavioral intervention that specifically targeted accuracy
      independent of drug conditions. The current findings highlight both the positive 
      effects and limitations of the two commonly used treatment modalities for ADHD.
      Future studies should continue to extend this area of investigative efforts to
      produce more data-based knowledge as to the appropriate doses of treatment, both 
      pharmacological and behavioral, with children with both ADHD and mental
      retardation.

      (direct observations, teacher rating scales) for hyperactive children with
      comorbid tic disorder. Rates of motor tic frequency were found to be moderately

      observations of tics and clinician rating scales were generally in the low to
      moderate range as were correlations between teacher and clinician rating scales. 
      Overall rates of hyperactive/disruptive behaviors were not associated with rates 
      of motor tic occurrence, and the behavioral symptoms of both disorders were also 
      independent for specific intervals of time.

TI  - Methylphenidate influences on both early and late ERP waves of ADHD children in a
      continuous performance test.
PG  - 561-78
AB  - Although it has frequently been reported that hyperactive children have
      abnormally small P3 amplitudes of the event-related potential (ERP), which are
      normalized by the stimulant drug methylphenidate (MPH), the literature is
      inconsistent concerning earlier ERP waves. The aim of the present study was to
      investigate whether the normalizing effect of a 10-mg dose of MPH was also
      apparent on earlier waves, such as the N1, the P2, and the N2, besides the P3.
      Twelve attention deficit with hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) children performed a 
      Continuous Performance Test involving a button-press response to the letter X
      (CPT-X) under the influence of MPH in a double-blind placebo controlled acute
      dosage design. ERPs were recorded at Oz, Pz, Cz, and Fz. The expected increase of
      the parietal P3, both to targets and nontargets, was apparent, as well as a
      significant increase in percentage of hits. There also was a significant increase
      of an earlier, negative going, wave, the N2, with a frontal maximum, under the
      influence of MPH. This wave was probably a manifestation of an increase in
      processing negativity for target stimuli only, after the intake of the stimulant 
      drug. No effect of MPH was found on the N1 or the P2.

TI  - Hemodynamic and analgesic profile after intrathecal clonidine in humans. A
      dose-response study.
PG  - 591-601; discussion 27A-28A
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidural clonidine produces effective postoperative analgesia in
      humans. Observed side effects include hypotension, bradycardia, sedation, and
      dryness of the mouth. A recent clinical study demonstrated that 150 micrograms
      intrathecal clonidine administered postoperatively as the sole analgesic agent
      was effective but produced hypotension and sedation. Animal studies have provided
      evidence of a biphasic effect on blood pressure after intrathecal clonidine
      administration, but no data concerning this effect in humans currently exist.
      This study was performed to evaluate the dose-response hemodynamic and analgesic 
      profiles of intrathecal clonidine administered after a standard surgical
      intervention, without perioperative administration of additional analgesics,
      local anesthetics, or tranquilizers. METHODS: In a randomized prospective
      double-blind study, 30 women who underwent elective cesarean section during
      general anesthesia with thiopental, nitrous oxide, and halothane were studied.
      Forty-five minutes after tracheal extubation, a lumbar intrathecal puncture was
      performed, and the patients received 150 (group 1), 300 (group 2), or 450 (group 
      3) micrograms clonidine. Postoperative analgesia was assessed on a visual analog 
      scale at rest and after deep cough at standard time points up to 24 h. At the
      same time points, blood pressure, heart rate, sedation, and respiratory rate also
      were recorded. RESULTS: Intrathecal clonidine decreased pain in all three groups 
      both at rest and with coughing very shortly after injection, in a dose-dependent 
      fashion. Clonidine 450 and 300 micrograms reduced pain scores significantly
      earlier (3rd and 6th min after intrathecal injection respectively), compared with
      150 micrograms clonidine. Pain relief, defined as the time to first request for
      supplemental analgesic by patients, lasted 402 +/- 75 min in group 1, 570 +/- 76 
      min in group 2, and 864 +/- 80 min in group 3; significant differences among all 
      groups; P < 0.01-0.001). Clonidine reduced mean arterial pressure compared with
      baseline only in group 1 (21 +/- 13%, P < 0.05). Delayed hypotension or
      bradycardia were not encountered after any of the three dose studies. Sedation
      was evident in all groups, but group 3 patients were significantly more sedated
      than group 1 and 2 patients. Respiratory rate and motor activity of the lower
      extremities were unaffected in all three groups (differences not significant).
      CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate dose-dependent analgesia after intrathecal
      clonidine at doses as great as 450 micrograms. The nearly immediate analgesic
      effect observed after intrathecal injection of 300 and 450 micrograms clonidine
      strongly argues for a spinal rather than a systemic site of action of this alpha 
      2-adrenergic agonist. After 300 and 450 micrograms intrathecal clonidine a
      relative hemodynamic stability is observed, suggesting a pressor effect at
      peripheral sites.

TI  - Clonidine is not a useful adjunct to methadone gradual detoxification in opioid
      addiction.
PG  - 370-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of clonidine in the management of opioid-dependent
      individuals undergoing gradual detoxification. METHOD: A double-blind
      placebo-controlled trial was conducted on 86 voluntary in-patients (59 male, 27
      female) aged 18-47 years, at a specialist drug-dependence treatment unit.
      Patients entered the trial when on 40 mg of methadone daily or less, and were
      randomised to receive incremental doses of clonidine (increasing from 0.2 mg
      daily to 1.2 mg daily) during a 14-day period of gradual methadone detoxification
      and for four weeks thereafter. Blood pressure was monitored and severity of
      opioid abstinence was assessed by questionnaire and by clinical examination.
      RESULT: Half the subjects were withdrawn or defaulted from the trial by the end
      of two weeks, those receiving clonidine earlier than those receiving dummy
      medication (9 of the former and only one of the latter because of systemic
      hypotension). Similar proportions of subjects completed detoxification in the two
      groups. In those who completed detoxification, clonidine did not significantly
      reduce either the symptoms or objective signs of opioid withdrawal. CONCLUSIONS: 
      These findings suggest that clonidine has no place as an adjunct to a programme
      of gradual opioid detoxification.

TI  - Effects of clozapine, fluphenazine, and placebo on reaction time measures of
      attention and sensory dominance in schizophrenia.
PG  - 133-44
AB  - Two reaction time (RT) paradigms were used to study clozapine's effects on
      sustained and selective attention compared to fluphenazine and placebo in 25
      chronic schizophrenic patients. Sensory dominance was studied via simple and
      choice RTs to lights and tones, and on double-stimulus trials in which the two
      stimuli were presented simultaneously. Although 8 of the 25 patients could not
      perform the RT tasks when taking placebo, there were no effects of clozapine on
      simple or choice RT compared to placebo or fluphenazine. Subjects on all 3
      treatments showed visual dominance: faster RT to lights than to tones on choice
      and double-stimulus trials. However, clozapine reduced this by means of a
      selective increase in RT to lights. Clozapine reduced failures to respond to the 
      tone on double-stimulus trials. This was shown to be due to reductions in
      hallucinations. Clozapine does not generally improve attention, but it may
      increase the ability of schizophrenic persons to process nondominant or
      unattended stimuli possibly by increasing the efficiency of resource allocation. 
      This may be partially mediated by a reduction in hallucinations.

TI  - Prevention of phantom pain after major lower limb amputation by epidural infusion
      of diamorphine, clonidine and bupivacaine.
PG  - 324-6
AB  - Phantom limb pain may appear in up to 85% of patients after amputation. There is 
      no effective treatment. Perioperative epidural infusion of morphine and
      bupivacaine, alone or in combination, is effective in preventing phantom limb
      pain in patients with pre-existing limb pain. Serious side-effects, however, make
      them difficult to manage on a general ward. Clonidine has been shown to be an
      effective postoperative analgesia when applied epidurally. To mitigate the
      potentially serious side-effects of all these drugs, we have studied their
      combined efficiency in preventing phantom limb pain in a prospective controlled
      study of 24 patients undergoing lower limb amputation. In the study group (n =
      13), an epidural infusion containing bupivacaine 75 mg, clonidine 150 micrograms 
      and diamorphine 5 mg in 60 ml normal saline was given at 1-4 ml/h 24-48 h
      preoperatively and maintained for at least 3 days postoperatively. The control
      group (n = 11) received on-demand opioid analgesia. Pain was assessed by visual
      analogue scale at 7 days, 6 months and 1 year. At 1 year follow-up, one patient
      in the study group and eight patients in the control group had phantom pain (P < 
      0.002) and two patients in the study group versus eight patients in the control
      group had phantom limb sensation (P < 0.05). There was no significant improvement
      in stump pain. We conclude that perioperative epidural infusion of diamorphine,
      clonidine and bupivacaine is safe and effective in reducing the incidence of
      phantom pain after amputation.

TI  - Clozapine, negative symptoms, and extrapyramidal side effects.
PG  - 74-7
AB  - The importance of persistent negative symptoms in schizophrenia as a limiting
      factor in psychosocial and vocational rehabilitation has been increasingly
      emphasized. As a result, treatment trials and new drug development programs are
      focusing more attention on negative symptoms. Unfortunately, there is enormous
      phenomenological overlap between negative symptoms and neuroleptic-induced
      parkinsonism. We report data from a cohort of 56 clozapine-treated patients
      demonstrating significant correlations between measures of akinesia and anergia. 
      Despite an average drug washout of over 2 weeks, the persistence of drug-induced 
      parkinsonism can confound the assessment of therapeutic drug effects on negative 
      symptoms.

TI  - Clozapine in tardive dyskinesia: observations from human and animal model
      studies.
PG  - 102-6
AB  - Clozapine has long been considered a useful treatment in patients who have
      schizophrenia with the neuroleptic-induced delayed-onset side effect tardive
      dyskinesia. We present data in support of the clinical impression using both an
      animal model of the disorder and dyskinetic patients themselves. Clozapine
      produces a lower rate of oral dyskinesia in laboratory rats after 6 months of
      chronic treatment than does haloperidol (8.6 +/- 1.3 vs. 13.6 +/- 1.4 vacuous
      chewing movements every 5 minutes, respectively), suggesting a lower propensity
      to cause tardive dyskinesia. In the human, when clozapine was compared with
      haloperidol in the treatment of patients with tardive dyskinesia, clozapine
      produced significantly greater benefit for motor symptoms after 12 months of
      treatment than did haloperidol (p < .001). Moreover, the dyskinesia rebound,
      which occurred equally in both drug groups at the beginning of the study, was
      sustained in the haloperidol group but lost in the clozapine-treated patients.
      These data suggest that dyskinetic patients lose their symptoms of tardive
      dyskinesia, along with dopaminergic hypersensitivity, with long-term clozapine
      treatment.

TI  - A double-blind trial of bupropion versus desipramine for bipolar depression.
PG  - 391-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although treatment of bipolar depression is a frequent clinical
      problem, double-blind studies of the treatment of bipolar depression are scarce. 
      Some case series and uncontrolled data suggest antidepressants may differ in
      their propensity to induce mania or their efficacy for bipolar depression.
      METHOD: The authors conducted a prospective double-blind trial to assess efficacy
      and rate of treatment-emergent mood elevation in depressed bipolar patients when 
      bupropion or desipramine was added to an ongoing therapeutic regimen of lithium
      or an anticonvulsant. Results were assessed after 8 weeks of acute treatment and 
      during maintenance treatment up to 1 year. RESULTS: No difference was found for
      acute efficacy between the two drugs. Mania/hypomania was observed in 5 of 10
      desipramine-treated patients, but only 1 of 9 bupropion-treated patients. The
      occurrence of hypomania or mania was correlated with treatment group (Kendall's
      tau correlation = 0.42; Z = -2.5, p < .012). CONCLUSION: These pilot findings
      suggest that bupropion is less likely to induce mood elevation than desipramine. 
      For treatment of bipolar depression, bupropion and desipramine appear to have
      similar antidepressant efficacy.

TI  - Efficacy of methadone versus methadone and guanfacine in the detoxification of
      heroin-addicted patients.
PG  - 463-9
AB  - In a randomized double-blind study, the clinical efficacy of methadone vs.
      methadone and guanfacine was assessed in terms of evolution of opioid withdrawal 
      symptoms during inpatient detoxification. A total of 144 patients were included
      and randomly allocated to three different treatment groups: methadone alone, and 
      two combined treatment schedules (methadone plus 3 or 4 mg of guanfacine). No
      differences were observed among the three groups with regard to retention rate
      throughout the study period. Both therapies, methadone and methadone plus
      guanfacine, determined a slight increase in withdrawal scores when methadone was 
      discontinued. However, guanfacine was unable to effectively control
      methadone-associated withdrawal symptoms. These results indicate that guanfacine 
      does not effectively reduce the opioid withdrawal symptoms.

TI  - Predictors of clozapine response in schizophrenia.
PG  - 129-32
AB  - The introduction of the atypical neuroleptic, clozapine, has had widespread
      influence not only on the treatment of the seriously mentally ill patient, but
      also on new drug development and on hypotheses of the pathophysiology of
      schizophrenia. While clozapine differs from traditional neuroleptics in its lack 
      of extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), it also is distinct in its profile of
      neurotransmitter receptor affinities. In our work examining the clinical and
      biological effects of clozapine in patients with schizophrenia, we have
      identified the presence of EPS during typical neuroleptic treatment as a
      consistent predictor of subsequent good response to clozapine. Further, our data 
      suggest that clozapine should not be reserved for the most chronically ill
      patients, but rather be utilized in patients with less chronic courses of
      schizophrenia. Biological predictors of clozapine response are consistent with
      dopaminergic, serotonergic, and noradrenergic facets to its mechanism of action.

TI  - Tics and dyskinesias associated with stimulant treatment in attention-deficit
      hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - 859-61
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of tics or dyskinesias (T/D) and examine
      associated clinical factors in children treated with stimulant medications for
      attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of a
      clinic cohort with chart review. SETTING: Hospital-based clinical service within 
      a division of developmental and behavioral pediatrics. PATIENTS: One hundred
      twenty-two children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder treated with
      stimulant medication. All children currently or recently treated were included.
      INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Determinations were made of
      medication used, medication dosage, presence or absence of T/D, time of T/D
      onset, and history and family history of T/D. Incidence of T/D was 9.0% of
      children or 8.2% of medication trials. One child (0.8%) had development of
      Tourette's syndrome. Age, medication, dosage, history of tics, or family history 
      of tics was not related to onset of T/D. CONCLUSION: Approximately 9% of children
      with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder treated with stimulant medication
      had development of T/D, predominantly transient in nature, with less than 1%
      having development of chronic tics or Tourette's syndrome. Personal or family tic
      history, medication selection, or dosage was not related to onset of T/D.

TI  - Sympathetic suppression attenuates anomalous responses to morphine in unexplained
      pain after cholecystectomy.
PG  - 185-8
AB  - Anomalous responses to morphine are common in patients with unexplained pain in
      the upper abdomen after cholecystectomy and may be linked to activation of the
      sympathetic nervous system. The hypothesis that sympathetic suppression would
      attenuate anomalous responses to morphine was tested by a randomized, cross-over 
      trial using a standard challenge with morphine, with and without pretreatment
      with clonidine (300 micrograms orally, 1 h prior to the administration of
      morphine). In 13 of the 15 patients who completed the study, pre-treatment with
      clonidine decreased plasma concentrations of noradrenaline, dopamine and
      adrenaline by 56, 15 and 25% respectively. This was associated with a significant
      reduction in morphine-induced pain (p = 0.02) and nausea (p = 0.04) and
      attenuated increases in plasma aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity (p =
      0.03). Clonidine attenuates anomalous responses to morphine, perhaps through
      effects on sympathetic nervous activity or plasma concentrations of
      catecholamines.

TI  - An isobolographic study of epidural clonidine and fentanyl after cesarean
      section.
PG  - 285-90
AB  - Although the epidural administration of clonidine and fentanyl provides pain
      relief after surgery, the interaction between the two drugs has not been examined
      formally. This study used an isobolographic method to determine whether
      epidurally administered fentanyl and clonidine interact in an additive or
      synergistic manner. Ninety women with moderate to severe pain after elective
      cesarean section under epidural anesthesia were studied. Using a randomized,
      double-blind protocol, we assigned each patient to receive a single epidural
      injection of one of three doses of fentanyl, clonidine, or a fixed ratio
      combination. Pain relief, blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and sedation were
      measured 15 min after injection. Each drug alone and in combination produced
      analgesia, as measured by pain relief scores, and reduced need for intravenous
      morphine. Although the effective dose producing analgesia in 50% of patients
      (ED50) for the mixture was only 52% of that predicted by an additive interaction,
      this did not differ significantly from additivity, likely due to large
      variability. Clonidine, alone or in combination with fentanyl, produced a minor
      reduction in BP, but did not affect HR or cause more sedation than fentanyl.
      Unlike studies in rodents, this clinical study did not demonstrate synergy
      between fentanyl and clonidine. This could reflect a true species difference or
      differences in methodologies used. Nonetheless, a reduced dose of fentanyl and
      clonidine can be combined for excellent analgesia.

TI  - Risperidone. A review of its pharmacology and therapeutic potential in the
      treatment of schizophrenia.
PG  - 253-73
AB  - Risperidone, a benzisoxazol derivative, is a novel antipsychotic agent which
      combines potent serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) 5-HT2 and dopamine D2 receptor
      antagonism. Development of the drug was stimulated by reports that the selective 
      serotonin 5-HT2 antagonist ritanserin improved the negative symptoms of
      schizophrenia and decreased extrapyramidal symptoms when combined with
      haloperidol. The relatively low incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms with
      risperidone may reflect a preferential action on mesolimbic rather than
      nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways. Recent clinical investigation suggests that 
      risperidone is of at least comparable efficacy to haloperidol and perphenazine in
      improving the symptoms of acute and chronic schizophrenia on short term
      administration. Advantages offered by risperidone over haloperidol include a
      faster onset of antipsychotic action, a lower incidence of extrapyramidal effects
      and possibly greater efficacy against the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. If 
      these benefits prove to be maintained during long term therapy, risperidone is
      likely to make a significant contribution to the treatment of schizophrenia.

TI  - Trazodone for antidepressant-associated insomnia.
PG  - 1069-72
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors investigated trazodone as a hypnotic for depressed
      patients who had persistent, exacerbated, or new insomnia while taking either
      fluoxetine or bupropion. METHOD: Seventeen depressed patients who had insomnia
      while taking fluoxetine or bupropion were given either trazodone or placebo in a 
      double-blind crossover trial. Sleep was assessed by self-report with the
      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the sleep items of the Yale-New Haven Hospital
      Depressive Symptom Inventory. RESULTS: Improvement with trazodone, but not with
      placebo, was shown by the total Pittsburgh index scores and Yale-New Haven
      inventory total sleep scores and by the Pittsburgh index measures of sleep
      duration and Yale-New Haven inventory measures of early morning awakening, and
      there was a trend toward improvement in the Yale-New Haven inventory item
      regarding middle of the night awakenings. Subjective sleep quality and sleep
      latency also showed a trend toward improvement, but the Pittsburgh index measures
      of sleep efficiency and disturbances and the Yale-New Haven inventory item
      regarding difficulty falling asleep were unaffected by trazodone. One patient
      dropped out because of excessive daytime sedation with trazodone, and another
      dropped out because of nonresponse to placebo. Of the completers, 67% experienced
      overall improvement in sleep with trazodone according to a priori criteria,
      whereas only 13% experienced improvement with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Trazodone is 
      an effective hypnotic for patients with antidepressant-associated insomnia.

      days with frequent head-banging and self-biting, whereas there were more days on 
      which blows to the head or self-biting were infrequent. Self-injurious
      participants slept 1.38 hours less per night during baseline, which was
      unaffected by naltrexone.

TI  - [Clonidine in the treatment of tobacco withdrawal. A comparison with nicotine
      chewing gum].
PG  - 453-6
AB  - The objective of our work was to carry out a prospective study on the
      effectiveness of clonidine and nicotine gum in the treatment of tobacco
      withdrawal. Sixty smokers were randomly distributed in two groups and were
      included in a tobacco withdrawal program. One group received oral clonidine
      treatment while the other group was given nicotine gum. Adjuvant therapy such as 
      group therapy or psychotherapy was not performed. At the end of one year there
      were no significant differences between the two groups with regards to the number
      of subjects who have continued to stop smoking. There were also no significant
      differences between the two groups with regards to the symptoms of tobacco
      abstinence. When we studied the relation between treatment fulfillment and
      tobacco withdrawal we observed that the clonidine treated group had a
      significantly greater number of success compared to the nicotine group (p <
      0.01).

TI  - Comparison of bupropion and trazodone for the treatment of major depression.
PG  - 170-9
AB  - Bupropion and trazodone were compared in a two-center, double-blind clinical
      trial of outpatients with moderate to severe major depression. After a 1-week
      placebo lead-in, 124 patients were randomly assigned to receive either bupropion 
      (N = 63) or trazodone (N = 61) for 6 weeks; data from 111 patients were used in
      the efficacy analysis. Dosing ranged from 225 to 450 mg/day for bupropion and 150
      to 400 mg/day for trazodone. The overall efficacy for each of the two drugs was
      similar; although improvement in the trazodone treatment group was significantly 
      greater on day 7 because of the effects on sleep. At the end of treatment, 58% of
      the bupropion-treated patients and 46% of the trazodone-treated patients were
      considered much or very much improved. Weight measurements at the time of
      discontinuation indicated a 2.5-lb mean weight loss for the bupropion treatment
      group and a 1.2-lb mean weight gain for the trazodone treatment group. The
      adverse experience profiles for bupropion and trazodone were consistent with
      their known pharmacologic profiles (i.e., activating versus sedating). Anorexia
      and anxiety were reported significantly more often for the bupropion treatment
      group, whereas somnolence, appetite increase, and edema were reported
      significantly more often for the trazodone treatment group.

TI  - The cardiovascular effects of bupropion and nortriptyline in depressed

PG  - 107-15
AB  - The cardiovascular effects of bupropion hydrochloride and nortriptyline were
      compared in a double-blind, randomized, 6-week trial in adult outpatients with
      major depression. After a 1-week placebo phase, 58 patients were randomized to
      treatment with bupropion (225-450 mg/day) and 57 to nortriptyline (75-150
      mg/day). Nortriptyline-treated patients had statistically significant heart rate 
      increases at each assessment as determined by RR intervals on electrocardiogram
      (14.5-18 bpm). Bupropion-treated patients had small but statistically significant
      increases in supine diastolic blood pressure of 5.6 mm Hg on day 7 and 7.5 mm Hg 
      on day 28. A few patients in each treatment group had orthostatic changes, but
      only nortriptyline-treated patients had symptomatic orthostatic hypotension. A
      slowing of cardiac conduction and possibly of rate-corrected repolarization
      occurred in patients treated with nortriptyline that did not occur in patients
      treated with bupropion. Compared to nortriptyline, bupropion appears to have a
      wider safety margin with regard to cardiovascular effects. This may be
      particularly true in the elderly, in patients with preexisting cardiovascular
      disease, or in overdose.

      hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - 305-16
AB  - Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), plasma, and urinary monoamine metabolites were
      determined for 29 boys, aged 6-12, with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder 
      (ADHD). Levels of CSF 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), homovanillic acid
      (HVA), and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), the metabolites of serotonin, 
      dopamine, and norepinephrine, respectively, correlated significantly with
      behavioral measures of aggression and impulsivity/hyperactivity. However, these
      correlations were in the unexpected direction; for example, CSF 5-HIAA correlated
      positively with the Brown-Goodwin Lifetime History of Aggression Scale. HVA in
      CSF was positively correlated with several measures of hyperactivity. The
      replicability of these findings, as well as possible socioenvironmental effects, 
      and the predictive value of CSF monoamines in prepubertal hyperactivity are the
      subjects of ongoing study.

TI  - Risperidone in the treatment of schizophrenia.
PG  - 825-35
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy
      of risperidone in the treatment of schizophrenic patients and determine its
      optimal dose. METHOD: This double-blind study included 388 schizophrenic patients
      drawn from 20 sites in the United States. Patients were randomly assigned to 8
      weeks' treatment with placebo, one of four doses of risperidone (2, 6, 10, or 16 
      mg), or 20 mg of haloperidol daily. RESULTS: Clinical improvement (20% reduction 
      in total scores on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia) at
      the study end point was shown by 35% of the patients receiving 2 mg of
      risperidone, 57% receiving 6 mg, 40% receiving 10 mg, and 51% receiving 16 mg;
      and by 30% receiving haloperidol and 22% receiving placebo. Statistically
      significant differences in clinical improvement were found between 6 and 16 mg of
      risperidone versus placebo and versus haloperidol. Positive symptom scores were
      significantly lower after 6, 10, and 16 mg of risperidone and 20 mg of
      haloperidol than placebo; negative symptom scores, however, were reduced
      significantly, compared with placebo, only after 6 and 16 mg of risperidone. The 
      incidence of extra-pyramidal side effects (measured by the Extrapyramidal Symptom
      Rating Scale) was significantly higher in patients treated with 16 mg of
      risperidone or 20 mg of haloperidol than placebo. The results indicate that the
      optimal daily dose of risperidone for most schizophrenic patients in this study
      was 6 mg; this dose was as effective as 16 mg, and the incidence of
      extrapyramidal symptoms in patients receiving 6 mg of risperidone was no higher
      than that in patients receiving placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Risperidone is a safe
      antipsychotic that is effective against both the positive and negative symptoms
      of schizophrenia.

TI  - Translating safety, efficacy and compliance into economic value for controlled
      release dosage forms.
PG  - 482-504
AB  - Advanced controlled release (CR) dosage forms are relative newcomers to
      pharmaceutical markets, and few studies relate their efficacy, safety or
      compliance benefits to economic value. This literature review was undertaken to
      assess the cost effectiveness of CR dosage forms using such measures as purchase 
      costs, total treatment costs, and economic value of improved therapeutic outcomes
      compared with those with non-CR dosage forms. Three therapeutic areas were
      examined: cardiovascular therapy, pain management and estrogen replacement
      therapy. In cardiovascular therapy, prescription costs of sustained release (SR) 
      verapamil were significantly higher than for conventional release verapamil.
      However, these were more than offset by lower physician, hospital and laboratory 
      expenditures for the SR group, in whom compliance was superior. Similarly,
      patients receiving SR diltiazem had better prescription refill compliance than
      those using a conventional formulation of the drug, as well as significantly
      lower aggregate healthcare costs during a 1-year study period. These lower costs 
      with both SR verapamil and diltiazem may relate to better compliance. CR
      nifedipine has lower daily acquisition costs than the conventional form,
      simplifies the dosage regimen to once daily, extends the indications of the drug 
      to hypertension as well as angina, and reduces vasodilatory adverse effects by
      reducing peak plasma drug concentrations and the postdose rate of increase in
      concentration. Compared with oral clonidine given twice daily, transdermal
      clonidine, given once weekly, had higher purchase costs, but was associated with 
      improved compliance, reduced adverse effects (due to control of plasma
      concentrations), and lower nondrug health costs, such as physician, hospital and 
      laboratory costs. Lower costs were also found for once daily oral formulations of
      various antihypertensives, suggesting that the economics of both types of CR
      dosage forms related to compliance. CR metoprolol 50 or 100mg and conventional
      release atenolol 50mg, each given once daily, provided effective
      beta1-adrenoceptor blockade. The conventional formulation caused deterioration in
      the sense of well-being that was temporally associated with sharp peaking of its 
      plasma concentrations. Such peaking did not occur with either dose of CR
      metoprolol, nor did any deterioration in the sense of well-being. Transdermal
      nitroglycerin (glyceryl trinitrate), compared with long-acting oral nitrates,
      improved quality of life (QOL) {despite a higher incidence of some adverse
      effects, such as headache, dizziness and skin irritation}. Furthermore, in some
      studies, this formulation reduced angina attacks, sublingual nitroglycerin use,
      and hospitalisation or emergency room use. Cost comparisons between transdermal
      products favoured those that have superior adhesion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400

TI  - Seizures associated with clozapine treatment in a state hospital.
PG  - 184-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The seizures associated with the atypical antipsychotic medication
      clozapine represent a serious side effect of treatment. In premarketing studies, 
      seizures occurred at a crude rate of 3.5%. It is possible that the rate and
      character of seizures would vary in clinical settings because of differences in
      patient populations or differences in the manner in which treatment is
      administered. We studied the seizures that occurred during clozapine treatment in
      a state psychiatric hospital. METHOD: We reviewed the medical charts and pharmacy
      records of 100 sequential patients who were to start clozapine treatment. The
      review period covered 6 months pretreatment through 1 year of follow-up. RESULTS:
      The patients were 55 men and 45 women, aged 20 to 61 years. Ten (5 men, 5 women) 
      had at least one seizure during clozapine treatment. Seizures occurred at all
      dose ranges (0-299 mg/day, N = 6; 300-599 mg/day, N = 2; 600-900 mg/day, N = 2). 
      Of 12 patients with histories of previous seizures, 4 (33%) had a seizure while
      taking clozapine and anticonvulsants. Of 9 patients with histories of head trauma
      but no seizures, 1 (11%) had a seizure. Of 79 patients without seizure disorder
      or a history of head trauma, 5 (6.3%) had a seizure. Nine of the patients who had
      a seizure continued on clozapine treatment with temporary dose reduction and/or
      addition of an anticonvulsant, 2 having one additional seizure. CONCLUSION:
      Clozapine-associated seizures were more frequent in this group of state hospital 
      patients than they were in premarketing studies. Clozapine-related seizures did
      not preclude successful treatment with clozapine.

PG  - 107-20
AB  - Smooth pursuit eye movement (SPEM) gain, total saccades, and subtypes of saccades
      were quantified from the visual pursuit tracking of 26 fluphenazine-treated
      patients with schizophrenia and 42 normal controls. Tracking was repeated in 16
      patients who underwent a placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover comparison of
      fluphenazine and clozapine. Fluphenazine-treated patients showed significant
      reduction in SPEM gain and significant increases in both total, intrusive, and
      anticipatory saccades and in saccadic amplitude, when compared to controls.
      Clozapine significantly reduced SPEM gain and significantly increased total and
      catch-up saccades, when compared to placebo or fluphenazine. High amplitude of
      intrusive saccades in drug-free patients predicted poor response to clozapine,
      suggesting that intact frontal cortical function may enable optimal clozapine
      response.

TI  - Clinical and cognitive effects of methylphenidate on children with attention
      deficit disorder as a function of aggression/oppositionality and age.
PG  - 206-21
AB  - Children diagnosed with attention deficit disorder (ADD; n = 44), ADD plus
      aggression/oppositionality (ADD/O; n = 34), and as not meeting ADD criteria (NC; 
      n = 29) received methylphenidate and placebo for 21 consecutive days each.
      Parents and teachers rated all groups improved under medication, but teachers
      reported less improvement for NC than for ADD/O children. Methylphenidate and
      chronological age had generally similar effects in a Sternberg task: greater
      accuracy and speed (especially for nontargets at low memory loads), larger P3b
      waves of event-related potentials, more pronounced slowing of P3b latency by
      memory load, and a greater trend of earlier peaks for targets than for
      nontargets. Both methylphenidate and maturation promoted more efficient
      strategies involving differentiated evaluation of targets and nontargets. These
      results were comparable among ADD groups.

TI  - Attention deficit in Alzheimer's disease is not simulated by an
      anticholinergic/antihistaminergic drug and is distinct from deficits in healthy
      aging.
PG  - 657-62
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate attention deficit in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its
      relationship to attention deficits associated with aging and with medications
      altering alertness. METHODS: Ten patients with probable AD, 10 healthy old
      controls, and 15 young controls performed a covert orienting of spatial attention
      task. Young controls performed the task an additional time after ingestion of
      diphenhydramine 1 mg/kg. Reaction times were obtained following valid, neutral,
      and invalid cues. RESULTS: In all groups, the reaction times were shortest for
      the validly cued stimuli and longest for the invalidly cued stimuli.
      Additionally, the AD patients performed disproportionately worse following the
      invalid cue than did the control groups. Young controls given diphenhydramine had
      decreased subjective alertness, performed worse than they did before drug but
      better than the old controls or AD patients, and had no disproportionate
      impairment with the invalid cue. CONCLUSIONS: AD patients have disproportionate
      problems shifting spatial attention compared with age-matched controls. Impaired 
      attentional performance in AD cannot be simulated in young subjects by ingestion 
      of a combined antihistamine/anticholinergic agent at a dose sufficient to produce
      significant changes in alertness.

AB  - To determine the efficacy of transdermal clonidine for alleviating
      post-orchiectomy hot flashes, a randomized, double-blind, crossover clinical
      trial was designed including 70 men with a history of prostate cancer who had
      undergone a medical or surgical orchiectomy and were suffering from hot flashes. 
      The results of this study demonstrated that clonidine did not significantly
      decrease hot flash frequency or severity. Future research is necessary to find
      effective means of alleviating hot flashes in post-orchiectomy patients.

TI  - Oral antihypertensives for hypertensive urgencies.
PG  - 352-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the data describing the use of oral antihypertensive agents 
      in the treatment of hypertensive urgencies (HU). DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search
      of the English-language literature and fan searches of papers evaluating oral
      antihypertensives in HUs and emergencies were conducted. STUDY SELECTION:
      Controlled and uncontrolled studies in humans are reviewed. Emphasis was placed
      on recent trials evaluating individual agents and comparative trials. DATA
      SYNTHESIS: Comparative trials have demonstrated that four currently available
      oral agents can lower blood pressure rapidly and predictably. Nifedipine, the
      most extensively studied, and clonidine have served traditionally as the oral
      agents of choice for the treatment of HUs. All the agents can lower blood
      pressure effectively within the first few hours after dosing, but their use also 
      has been associated with adverse effects. Nifedipine and captopril are the two
      agents with the most rapid onset, within 0.5-1 hour, and may treat hypertensive
      emergencies as well as urgencies. Clonidine and labetalol have maximal blood
      pressure lowering effects at 2-4 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Captopril, clonidine,
      labetalol, and nifedipine are all effective agents for the treatment of HUs.
      Agent selection should be based on the perceived need for urgent blood pressure
      control, the cause of HU, and concomitant conditions. A definite benefit from
      acute blood pressure lowering in HUs has yet to be demonstrated, especially in
      asymptomatic patients. More controlled trials with less aggressive dosing
      regimens and placebo controls need to be performed to assess the most appropriate
      treatment for HUs with the fewest adverse effects.

TI  - Comparison of a bupivacaine-clonidine mixture with plain bupivacaine for caudal
      analgesia in children.
PG  - 258-62
AB  - In a randomized, double-blind study in children undergoing elective orthopaedic
      surgery, we have assessed the clinical value of combining clonidine with
      bupivacaine for caudal analgesia. Forty-six children, aged 1-10 yr, were
      allocated randomly to two equal groups to receive 0.25% bupivacaine 1 ml kg-1
      combined with either normal saline 1 ml (group A) or clonidine 2 micrograms kg-1 
      in normal saline 1 ml (group B). Mean (SD) duration of caudal analgesia for
      groups A and B were 5.2 (1.2) h and 9.8 (2.1) h, respectively (P < 0.0001). Group
      B required significantly less supplementary analgesia after operation (P < 0.01).
      There was no significant difference in the incidence of side effects between the 
      two groups. The longer duration of sedation in group B (9.1 (2.5) h) resulted
      partly from the sedative effect of clonidine and partly from the longer duration 
      of analgesia provided by clonidine. We conclude that, when added to bupivacaine, 
      clonidine improves the efficacy of caudal analgesia in children.

      Catapres (.075 mg) was given orally every 12 hours for 3 days in eight healthy
      subjects. The study was conducted by a crossover design with 14 to 16 days'
      interval between the cross-over. Blood and urine samples for clonidine
      concentration were obtained, and blood pressure (BP) was measured for a 168-hour 
      period after application of M and for a 96-hour period after initiation of
      Catapres therapy. Plasma concentration of clonidine increased gradually after
      application of M and decreased gradually after removal, whereas this parameter
      increased rapidly during the absorption phase and decreased rapidly in the
      elimination phase after each dosage of Catapres. Elimination half-life of
      clonidine after removal of M was significantly greater than that after the final 
      dosage of Catapres. No significant difference was observed in maximum plasma
      concentration or area under the plasma concentration-time curve between the two
      trials. The BP lowering effects of M and Catapres did not differ significantly.
      Adverse symptoms occurred more frequently during Catapres therapy than during
      treatment with M. Most of these symptoms were observed when plasma clonidine
      concentration was relatively higher in each trial. These results suggest that M
      is effective for the treatment of hypertension with a lower incidence of adverse 
      symptoms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - HIV seroconversion in intravenous drug users in San Francisco, 1985-1990.
PG  - 223-31
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the HIV seroconversion rate, risk factors for
      seroconversion, and changes in risk behavior over time in intravenous drug users 
      (IVDU) in San Francisco, 1985-1990. DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: All
      methadone maintenance and 21-day methadone detoxification programs in San
      Francisco. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2351 heterosexual IVDU, of whom 681 were
      seronegative at first visit and seen at least twice ('repeaters'). MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURES: HIV seroconversion rates, risk factors for seroconversion, and changes 
      in behavior. RESULTS: The HIV seroconversion rate in repeaters was 1.9% per
      person-year (ppy) of follow-up [2.1% in women versus 1.7% in men (not
      significant); 4% in African Americans versus 1% in whites (P = 0.006); 3.9% ppy
      in the first third of the study, 1.2% in the second (P = 0.007), and 1.9% in the 
      last (not significant)]. Risk factors for seroconversion were five or more sexual
      partners per year [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.6; P = 0.02], use of shooting gallery
      ever (HR = 2.9; P = 0.02), and less than 1 year (lifetime) in methadone
      maintenance (HR = 2.7; P = 0.02). Self-reported intravenous cocaine use fell from
      33 to 15% over 5 years, shooting gallery use fell from 19 to 6%, and the
      proportion with five or more sexual partners fell from 25 to 10%. Bleach use rose
      to 75% of needle-sharers. CONCLUSIONS: The 1985-1990 HIV seroconversion rate in
      IVDU (1.9% ppy) was comparable to that in San Francisco cohorts of homosexual men
      (1.4% ppy). A decline in HIV seroconversion coincided with changes in risk
      behavior. Stable attendance of methadone maintenance was highly protective: the
      seroconversion rate in subjects with 1 year or more in methadone was 12% ppy.

TI  - The cognitive and psychomotor effects of opioid drugs in cancer pain management.
PG  - 67-84
AB  - The time has come to evaluate critically our practice of cancer pain management
      and the assumptions on which it is based. We owe it to our patients to maximize
      the quality of their lives and to provide evidence for them that is based on a
      scientific approach rather than anecdotal experience. From the information
      available, opioids do have effects on cognitive and psychomotor function, and
      although many of these effects diminish once the patient is on a stable dose, the
      evidence suggests that baseline pretreatment levels are not achieved. In
      addition, the relationship between measurable effects and the performance of
      everyday tasks such as driving is unclear. The challenge we now face is to
      continue the improvements in cancer pain control achieved over the last 25 years.
      The management of the central adverse effects of opioids must be focused on
      accurate assessment and careful titration of opioids against pain. Adjuvant
      analgesic drugs and non-drug measures should be used whenever possible, and drugs
      should be chosen that will not contribute to existing difficulties. The
      appropriate use of psychostimulants has yet to be established as has the relative
      benefit of one opioid over another in cancer pain.

TI  - Long-term botulinum toxin treatment of focal hand dystonia.
PG  - 70-6
AB  - We treated focal hand dystonia in 53 patients with botulinum toxin injections for
      up to 6 years. Eighty-one percent of the patients improved with at least one
      injection session. Sixty-five percent of the injections produced transient
      weakness. We followed 37 of the patients for at least 2 years from the start of
      treatment, 24 of whom discontinued treatment because of inadequate response, loss
      of response, inaccessibility of a treatment provider, or the expense of the
      toxin. Women, who had a greater extent and longer duration of benefit than men,
      were more likely to continue treatment. The mean interval between injection
      sessions was 6 months. In most patients, we injected the toxin into the same
      combination of muscles at each session. The dose of toxin generally fluctuated
      within a range of 20 units. Side effects were mild and transient and unrelated to
      the long-term use of botulinum toxin. Botulinum toxin injection is safe and
      effective for the long-term management of focal hand dystonia.

TI  - Epilepsy, psychosis, and schizophrenia: clinical and neuropathologic
      correlations.
PG  - 34-42
AB  - This study examines the relationship between epilepsy and psychosis. It compares 
      clinical, EEG, and neuropathologic data from a group of subjects who had both
      epilepsy and psychosis with similar information from another group of patients
      who had epilepsy but no evidence of psychotic illness. We examined, blind to
      clinical diagnosis, gross and microscopic material from whole-brain specimens
      from 10 patients diagnosed with epilepsy plus schizophrenia-like psychosis, nine 
      subjects diagnosed with epilepsy plus "epileptic psychosis," and 36 individuals
      with epilepsy (21 from an epileptic colony and 15 from the community at large)
      who had no history of psychosis (n = 10 + 9 + 21 + 15 = 55). We abstracted case
      histories without knowledge of pathologic findings. Epileptic colony patients had
      an earlier age at onset of seizures, while epileptic colony and epileptic
      psychosis patients had more frequent seizures. Epileptic individuals in the
      community died at a younger age than did epileptic patients in long-stay hospital
      care. Psychotic epileptic patients had larger cerebral ventricles, excess
      periventricular gliosis, and more focal cerebral damage compared with epileptic
      patients who had no psychotic illness. Epileptic patients with schizophrenia-like
      psychosis were distinguished from all other groups by a significant excess of
      pinpoint perivascular white-matter softenings. We found that mesial temporal
      sclerosis and temporal lobe epilepsy occurred with equal frequency in the
      psychotic and nonpsychotic groups; generalized seizures occurred more frequently 
      in the psychotic epileptics and the epileptic colony epileptics than in the
      community epileptic controls.

TI  - Transdermal clonidine for ameliorating tamoxifen-induced hot flashes.
PG  - 155-8
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the efficacy of transdermal clonidine for alleviating
      tamoxifen-induced hot flashes in women with a history of breast cancer. PATIENTS 
      AND METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, crossover design was used in this
      prospective study. Women with a history of breast cancer who were receiving
      tamoxifen and suffering from hot flashes were potentially eligible for this
      protocol study. RESULTS: Clonidine did reduce hot-flash frequency to a degree
      that was statistically impressive (P < .0001), but clinically moderate (20%
      reduction from baseline). It also decreased hot-flash severity (P = .02, 10%
      reduction from baseline). Clonidine was related to increased mouth dryness (P <
      .001), constipation (P < .02), itchiness under the patch (P < .01), and
      drowsiness (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Better means are needed to alleviate hot
      flashes among patients in whom estrogen therapy is contraindicated.

TI  - Effect of isradipine on cyclosporin A-related hypertension.
PG  - 50-3
AB  - There is evidence that calcium antagonists may have a beneficial effect on
      cyclosporin A (CyA)-induced hypertension after organ transplantation. In a
      double-blind controlled trial, 50 consecutive non-diabetic first
      kidney-transplant recipients were randomized to receive either isradipine, a
      dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, or placebo. There were no significant
      differences in age, weight, gender, warm and cold ischaemic periods, and original
      renal disease between treatment groups. Treatment was started intravenously 2 h
      before the transplantation procedure and was subsequently continued orally for 3 
      months. The immunosuppressive treatment included oral CyA from day 5 after a
      short course of anti-T-lymphocyte immunoglobulins. Hypertension was treated with 
      oral labetolol in combination with guanfacine if necessary. Antihypertensive
      medication was prescribed significantly more often (16 vs 7 patients; p < 0.05)
      in the placebo group. Standing systolic blood pressure was significantly lower in
      the isradipine group. The standing diastolic and both systolic and diastolic
      sitting blood pressures were similar in both groups. After 3 months, patients'
      mean serum creatinine was significantly lower with isradipine than with placebo
      (142.0 +/- 11.9 vs 164.0 +/- 10.8 mumol/l; p < 0.05). With isradipine, a
      significantly higher dose of CyA was needed to achieve adequate plasma levels
      (8.0 +/- 0.5 vs 6.2 +/- 0.5 mg/kg/day; p < 0.01). It can be concluded that
      isradipine is an effective antihypertensive agent after kidney transplantation
      and may have an influence on CyA metabolism. Furthermore, isradipine appears to
      ameliorate CyA-induced nephropathy.

TI  - The utility of curriculum-based measurement for evaluating the effects of

PG  - 101-13
AB  - Two case studies were conducted to investigate the utility of curriculum-based
      measurement of math and reading for evaluating the effects of methylphenidate on 
      the academic performance of 2 students diagnosed with attention deficit
      hyperactivity disorder. Following baseline measurement, double-blind
      placebo-controlled procedures were employed to evaluate each student's response
      to three levels (5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg) of the medication. Results of the first 
      study suggest that the curriculum-based measures were sensitive indicators of the
      student's response to medication. This finding was replicated in the second
      study. In the second study, when the student's follow-up dose of medication was
      based on trial-phase data, follow-up performance was improved compared to
      baseline performance. These case studies suggest that further research is
      warranted on the utility of curriculum-based measurements for monitoring and
      evaluating stimulant medication interventions with children with this disorder.

TI  - Platelet alpha 2-adrenergic receptor binding and the effects of d-amphetamine in 
      boys with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - 120-4
AB  - Presynaptic inhibitory alpha-adrenergic receptors are involved in regulating the 
      release of norepinephrine (NE) through a negative feedback mechanism mediated by 
      NE. Increased alpha2-adrenergic receptor activity suggests decrease NE release
      and activity, while decreased alpha2-adrenergic activity suggests increase NE
      release and activity. A large body of evidence suggests the involvement of a
      disturbance in NE activity in the pathophysiology of attention deficit
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in childhood. Platelet alpha2-adrenergic receptor
      binding was compared in 23 boys aged 7-12 with the diagnosis of ADHD and 11
      normal controls. The ADHD boys tended to have lower levels of alpha2-binding than
      controls. The administration of d-amphetamine in a double-blind
      placebo-controlled crossover design did not have any effect on alpha2-receptor
      binding in ADHD boys. Nonresponders to d-amphetamine had the lowest
      alpha2-receptor binding compared to responders and controls. These findings
      suggest a normal alpha2-adrenergic activity in ADHD boys responders to
      d-amphetamine and a possible increase in NE release in ADHD boys nonresponders to
      d-amphetamine due to decreased alpha2-adrenergic receptors.

TI  - Pharmacodynamics of MDL 72974A: absence of effect on the pressor response to oral
      tyramine.
PG  - 371-5
AB  - MDL 72974A, a new irreversible selective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B
      which is not metabolized to amphetamine-like compounds, is currently being
      developed for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. In this double blind, placebo
      controlled randomized study 24 healthy volunteers (n = 6/dose) received single
      oral doses of placebo, 1, 12 or 24 mg of MDL 72974A qd over two weeks.
      Sensitivity to orally administered tyramine was determined under fasting
      conditions before and after drug administration and the doses of tyramine
      yielding a 30 mmHg increase of SBP (PD30) compared. The 2-fold increase of
      tyramine sensitivity at end of treatment seen at all MDL 72974A dose levels,
      however, is within the variability range of the tyramine pressor response. MDL
      72974A selectively inhibits MAO-B at doses up to 24 mg orally and has a
      favourable safety profile.

TI  - Influence of apraclonidine and pilocarpine alone and in combination on post laser
      trabeculoplasty pressure rise.
PG  - 30-2
AB  - Apraclonidine and pilocarpine have been shown to be effective in reducing the
      incidence of intraocular pressure (IOP) spikes following argon laser
      trabeculoplasty. An additional reduction in the incidence of acute pressure rise 
      might theoretically be expected by combining these two effective agents. In a
      prospective randomised study we compared the ability of apraclonidine and
      pilocarpine alone and in combination to prevent post laser pressure spikes.
      Patients receiving regular pilocarpine to either eye were excluded. Seventy five 
      eyes received either apraclonidine (26 eyes), pilocarpine (23 eyes), or both
      drugs (26 eyes). Apraclonidine 1% was instilled 1 hour before and immediately
      after, and pilocarpine 4% immediately after trabeculoplasty. IOP was measured
      before and at 1, 2, and 3 hours following trabeculoplasty. In only two (8%) eyes 
      receiving combined treatment was a pressure rise observed. This frequency was
      significantly lower than that seen in eyes treated with apraclonidine alone
      (38%), or pilocarpine alone (39%). The mean fall in IOP at 1, 2, and 3 hours was 
      significantly greater in those eyes receiving combined treatment than in the
      other two groups.

PG  - 219-25
AB  - The effects on brain metabolism of the intravenous (i.v.) administration of
      dextroamphetamine was assessed by positron emission tomography (PET) with
      [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (18-FDG) in 8 adults with attention-deficit
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). During the 3-hour 18-FDG PET session, each adult
      underwent the initial scan following i.v. infusion of placebo and a second scan
      following i.v. infusion of 0.15 mg/kg dextroamphetamine in a single-blind design.
      All subjects showed increased systolic/diastolic blood pressure and improved
      continuous performance task scores after dextroamphetamine. Global and regional
      metabolic rates were not significantly altered by the stimulant. When regional
      and global rates were normalized, the metabolic rates of only three cortical
      regions differed significantly between conditions. Individually, global
      metabolism increased in 4 subjects, was unchanged in 2, and decreased in 2 after 
      stimulant infusion. No clinical characteristics differentiated these patients.
      I.V. infusion of dextroamphetamine did not significantly alter brain metabolism
      in ADHD adults in this preliminary study.

TI  - Childhood-onset schizophrenia: an NIMH study in progress.
PG  - 697-712
AB  - An ongoing study of the phenomenology, genetics, neuropsychology, physiology (eye
      tracking, autonomic responsivity), neuroimaging, biochemistry, and pharmacology
      of childhood-onset schizophrenia is described, and pilot data are presented for
      the first 22 subjects. Differentiation from autism "spectrum" disorders and other
      poorly defined, severe neurodevelopmental disorders is needed. Eye tracking and
      autonomic results are similar to patterns seen in later-onset schizophrenia and
      possibly more striking. Magnetic resonance imaging showed larger left frontal
      ventricular horn area for the schizophrenia subjects, larger left caudate, and
      lack of normal caudate asymmetry. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography
      during an auditory continuous performance task revealed decreased right
      parietal/occipital glucose metabolic rate in the schizophrenia subjects, which
      may be secondary to poor attentional performance, and increased glucose metabolic
      rate in three left frontal regions, a left parietal region, and the right
      putamen. Clozapine has been effective and well tolerated in an open trial with 12
      adolescents who responded poorly to typical neuroleptics; 16 subjects have been
      enrolled in a double-blind comparison of haloperidol and clozapine. Longitudinal 
      study of this narrowly defined and possibly more homogeneous group of very
      early-onset schizophrenia subjects will be relevant to current neurodevelopmental
      theories addressing the role of puberty, progression of pathology, and continuity
      or discontinuity with later-onset schizophrenia.

TI  - Risperidone versus clozapine in the treatment of schizophrenic patients with
      acute symptoms: a double blind, randomized trial.
PG  - 129-37
AB  - 1. In order to verify the hypothesis that risperidone is a useful therapeutic
      alternative to clozapine the authors carried out a randomized double blind trial 
      in 59 patients with paranoid hallucinatory psychoses. 2. In a treatment lasting
      28 days three groups of patients received either 4 mg risperidone (N = 20), 8 mg 
      risperidone (N = 19), or 400 mg clozapine (N = 20) daily. 3. The tolerance of 4
      mg risperidone was globally assessed as being better than that of 400 mg
      clozapine. Drop-outs under clozapine were mostly caused by side effects, whereas 
      under risperidone they tended to occur for therapeutic inefficacy. 4. The
      antipsychotic effect was highly significant and clinically relevant under both
      risperidone and clozapine.

TI  - Epidural clonidine treatment for refractory reflex sympathetic dystrophy.
PG  - 1163-9; discussion 27A
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intraspinally administered alpha 2-adrenergic agonists may relieve
      pain in sympathetically maintained pain (SMP) syndromes, such as reflex
      sympathetically dystrophy (RSD), by spinal, peripheral, and central nervous
      system actions. This study examined analgesic efficacy and side effects of
      epidurally administered clonidine in patients with severe, refractory RSD.
      METHODS: Twenty-six patients with severe chronic pain consistent with RSD were
      studied in a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled design. Cervical or lumbar
      epidural catheters were inserted for patients with upper or lower extremity RSD, 
      respectively, and patients received, in random order on three consecutive days,
      epidural injection of clonidine, 300 or 700 micrograms, or placebo. Pain (by
      visual analog score (VAS) and McGill Pain Questionnaire), sedation, blood
      pressure, and heart rate were monitored at specified intervals for 6 h after
      injection. Patients who responded to clonidine, but not placebo, then entered a
      trial of open-label, continuous epidural infusion of clonidine (10-50
      micrograms/h). RESULTS: Clonidine, but not placebo, caused pain relief, sedation,
      and decreased blood pressure and heart rate after bolus epidural injection. The
      smaller clonidine dose (300 micrograms), produced pain relief and decreases in
      blood pressure and heart rate similar to those of the 700 micrograms dose, but
      with less sedation. Epidural clonidine was infused for a mean of 43 days in 19
      patients at a mean rate of 32 micrograms/h for sustained analgesia. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Transdermal clonidine has been demonstrated to produce analgesia in the area
      surrounding its application site in patients with SMP. The current study
      indicates that extensive analgesia may be obtained by epidural administration.
      Sedation and hypotension may limit bolus epidural clonidine administration for
      RSD. The role for chronic epidural infusion of clonidine has not yet been
      established.

TI  - Effects of methylphenidate on sleep in children with attention-deficient
      hyperactivity disorder. An activity monitor study.
PG  - 1313-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of methylphenidate hydrochloride on sleep
      patterns in children diagnosed as having attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder
      (ADHD). DESIGN: A double-blind, controlled drug-placebo cross-over design.
      SETTING: Home. SUBJECTS: Ten children (aged 6 years 9 months to 12 years &
      months) diagnosed as having ADHD were consecutively recruited and compared with
      age- and sex-matched normal controls. TREATMENT: Methylphenidate hydrochloride
      (0.3 to 0.4 mg/kg) or placebo was administered at 7:30 AM. MEASUREMENTS AND
      RESULTS: Each child underwent activity monitoring at home during 6 days of no
      treatment (baseline) followed by placebo and methylphenidate treatment. The
      results of the three trial stages, as well as those of the 20 age- and
      sex-matched normal controls, were compared. A shorter total sleep duration was
      evident during the methylphenidate treatment compared with that of baseline and
      placebo treatment. The amount of quiet sleep was lower (however, not
      significantly) among the study group compared with controls, whereas no such
      difference was noted during methylphenidate treatment. Night-to-night sleep
      pattern stability was found. No other differences were found either between
      children with ADHD and controls or between on and off stages of methylphenidate
      treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the notion that ADHD is a centrally
      generated disorder attributable to hypoarousal, which subsequently stimulates
      motor overactivity. Methylphenidate does not appear to affect sleep patterns
      adversely and possibly normalizes them in patients with ADHD.

AB  - Compared two methods of evaluating methylphenidate (MPH) on measures of parental 
      acceptance, satisfaction, and compliance with the treatment. Twenty-four 6- to
      10-year-old children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) were
      randomly assigned to either a blind, placebo-controlled medication trial (MT) or 
      to a typical clinical procedures (TCP) evaluation that was nonblind and without a
      placebo control. Ratings of satisfaction were significantly higher in the MT
      condition than in the TCP condition; however, all parents became more accepting
      of MPH after participating in an evaluation. Both during the evaluation and at
      6-week and 3-month follow-ups, approximately 20% of cases were not complying with
      treatment. However, rates of compliance did not differ between the MT and TCP
      conditions.

TI  - Clozapine treatment of outpatients with schizophrenia: outcome and long-term
      response patterns.
PG  - 1145-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to examine the effects of clozapine in
      treating moderately ill schizophrenic outpatients and to determine the length of 
      medication trial needed to identify responders and nonresponders. METHODS: Rates 
      of clinical responses, relapses and hospitalizations, and levels of
      symptomatology and functioning were assessed for 30 chronic schizophrenic
      outpatients who received clozapine for one year. For some patients, data on
      relapse and hospitalization during treatment were compared with data from the
      year before treatment. RESULTS: Eighteen of the 30 patients met criteria for
      sustained response; 17 of the responders were identified within the first four
      months of treatment. Patients experienced significantly fewer relapses and
      hospitalizations during treatment than in the previous year. Improvement in
      positive symptoms, general symptomatology, and levels of functioning reached a
      plateau during the first six months of treatment and remained at that level
      during the second six months. Negative symptoms and quality of life showed
      nonsignificant improvements at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Results support the use of
      clozapine in treating chronic, residually symptomatic schizophrenic outpatients. 
      A four-month clozapine trial may be adequate to detect clinical responders in
      this population.

TI  - Malleability of social impressions of hyperactive children.
PG  - 631-47
AB  - The role of adults' social cognitions in mediating judgments of hyperactive
      children's medication-related behavior change was explored. Two hundred
      eight-eight undergraduates observed two videotaped excerpts of a hyperactive
      "target" boy playing a group game with two peers. Each target was taking either
      methylphenidate (0.6 mg/kg) during both excerpts, placebo during both excerpts,
      methylphenidate first followed by placebo, or placebo first followed by
      methylphenidate. Adults' cumulative social evaluations of the child were assessed
      after they viewed both video segments. Results indicated that observers combined 
      their perceptions of the two behavior samples into composite impressions using an
      equal-weight averaging algorithm. Even for children whose behavior improved,
      adults' ratings of undercontrolled behaviors continued to meet or, in some cases 
      exceed, research cutoff scores used to identify hyperactive children. The
      findings suggest that the actual behaviors of children with attention-deficit
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) play a more influential role in shaping
      interpersonal impressions than do perceiver social-cognitive processes such as
      primacy, recency, or integration biases.

TI  - Methadone combined with clonidine versus clonidine alone in opiate
      detoxification.
PG  - 529-35
AB  - The availability and use of a methadone/clonidine combination versus clonidine
      alone in opiate detoxification were studied. In Phase I of the study, a
      sequential combination of methadone followed by clonidine was utilized in those
      patients presenting with a primary diagnosis of opiate dependence. During the
      Phase II of the study, only clonidine was available. Medications were
      administered only if the history and clinical findings indicated impending or
      acute opiate withdrawal syndrome. Overall, there was no difference between the
      Phase I and Phase II groups when the number of opiate dependent admissions,
      patients completing detoxification, and the patients completing a follow-up
      rehabilitation program were compared. However, the patients in Phase I whose
      clinical symptomatology warranted the use of methadone were more likely to
      complete the detoxification program when compared to the patients in Phase II who
      received clonidine only. There was no difference between the two groups in
      completion of a follow-up rehabilitation. Detoxification with clonidine alone was
      more likely to be successful if the patient has had prior detoxification
      experience with methadone or if there was a secondary dependence of alcohol,
      sedative, or tranquilizer present coexisting with the primary opiate dependence
      diagnosis.

PG  - 665-9
AB  - We studied 10 patients with chronic back pain who had claimed benefit with a
      previous extradural dose of clonidine 150 micrograms combined with local
      anaesthetic. We compared a single dose of clonidine 150 micrograms given by
      either the extradural or i.v. route in a double-blind, randomized, double-dummy
      and cross-over fashion, with 80% power to detect a difference in the analgesic
      effect of the two routes. Pain intensity, pain relief, adverse effects, mood,
      sedation and vital signs were assessed by a nurse observer. I.v. clonidine
      produced significantly (P < 0.04) greater analgesia than extradural clonidine in 
      one of the five analgesic outcome measures. Clonidine given by either route
      produced statistically significant sedation and significant decreases in arterial
      pressure and heart rate. In this study, extradural clonidine had no significant
      clinical advantages compared with i.v. clonidine; clonidine 150 micrograms by
      either route produced a high incidence of adverse effects.

PG  - 661-4
AB  - We have studied the anaesthetic and analgesic properties of intrathecal clonidine
      and intrathecal morphine in patients undergoing total hip replacement under
      spinal anaesthesia. After routine spinal anaesthesia with 0.5% plain bupivacaine 
      2.75 ml, patients were allocated randomly to receive intrathecal clonidine,
      morphine or saline (control) as adjuvant to the bupivacaine. Postoperative
      analgesic effects were measured by consumption of morphine via patient-controlled
      analgesia and visual analogue pain scores. Both intrathecal clonidine and
      intrathecal morphine prolonged the time to first analgesia compared with saline
      (mean 278 (SD 93.2) min, 498 (282.4) min and 54 (61.9) min, respectively) (P <
      0.001). Total morphine consumption on the first night after operation was
      significantly less in the intrathecal morphine group. There were no differences
      between the clonidine and the control group. Intrathecal clonidine prolonged the 
      duration of spinal analgesia, but was markedly inferior to the intrathecal
      morphine in providing subsequent postoperative analgesia.

TI  - Changes in psychopathology and dyskinesia after neuroleptic withdrawal in a
      double-blind design.
PG  - 267-71
AB  - The goal of this study was to assess the time course of change in psychopathology
      and dyskinesia after neuroleptic withdrawal. Fifteen DSM-III schizophrenic
      patients were abruptly withdrawn in a double-blind fashion from stable
      haloperidol treatment. Weekly ratings of dyskinesia and psychopathology were
      performed for 4 weeks post-withdrawal. There was an overall increase in
      dyskinesia ratings over the 4-week period (p < 0.05) beginning in week 2, with
      dyskinetic movements of the fingers showing the most significant increase (p <
      0.001). There were no overall changes in psychopathology, though the group
      appeared to be bimodal with 6 of the 15 patients showing a significant relapse in
      psychotic symptoms. Neither baseline TD nor psychotic relapse significantly
      interacted with change in TD over time. These schizophrenic patients showed an
      increase in global dyskinesia rating early within four weeks of neuroleptic
      withdrawal. This time course did not appear to be associated with reemergence of 
      psychopathology which occurred later. A significant minority of patients relapsed
      within this time period. This suggests the relative safety of brief periods of
      neuroleptic withdrawal for carefully selected patients in a controlled setting
      with specific goals (e.g., for evaluation or in preparation for clozapine) and
      the need to further understand who is at risk for rapid relapse.

TI  - Pharmacoepidemiology of clozapine in 202 inpatients with schizophrenia.
PG  - 1262-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clozapine in a field trial for hospitalized patients with 
      treatment-resistant schizophrenia. METHOD: The setting consisted of a large,
      state-operated, public psychiatric system. The protocol called for the treating
      psychiatrist to provide symptom- and adverse-effect ratings at four times
      following the start of drug therapy. The outcome criteria included the Sandoz
      study outcome measure of symptom improvement as well as discharge status for one 
      year of follow-up. To assess the validity of the ratings, several measures of
      internal consistency were determined. Clozapine therapy was started in 227
      patients, and symptom data are available for 202. RESULTS: Overall, 33 percent (n
      = 66) of the patients were improved at the end of one year of treatment; 12
      percent (n = 24) maintained symptom improvement at all three evaluation times.
      Modest, statistically significant improvement after 12 weeks compared with
      baseline Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) total scores was observed for the 
      patients continuing medication (n = 152); the emergence of a previously
      unimproved group (n = 26) explains this modest improvement. However, in the
      analysis of all patients (n = 202), (including dropouts), there was no
      significant symptom improvement after 12 weeks. Lower baseline BPRS scores
      predicted significant symptom improvement after 12 weeks of treatment. Among
      those medicated for one year, the pattern of symptom improvement showed that the 
      probability of late improvement was 0.26 for those previously unimproved, and the
      probability of a 12-week responder losing improvement was 0.23, resulting in a
      net group gain of 3 cases in 100. By the end of one year, 8 percent (n = 17) of
      the cohort was discharged, and 3 percent (n = 7) was transferred to another
      facility while continuing to receive clozapine. Of the 227 original patients
      started on clozapine therapy, medication was discontinued for adverse effects in 
      11 percent (n = 25): white blood cell count (WBC) decrease (but no
      agranulocytosis) in 5 percent (n = 12), seizures in 1 percent (n = 3), one
      patient with seizures and decreased WBC count, and other events (e.g.,
      cardiovascular changes, fever, or possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome) in 4
      percent (n = 9). Patient refusal was reported for 6 percent (n = 13) of those
      starting treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Although only 19 percent of the patients
      exhibited improvement at 6 weeks, the response rate at 12 weeks (29 percent) for 
      this naturalistic study cohort was similar to that in the major, double-blind,
      six-week, controlled, clinical trial of clozapine. The impersistence of response 
      as symptoms were followed for up to one year is a finding that deserves rigorous 
      evaluation.

TI  - Changes in event-related potentials with stimulant medication in children with
      attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - 139-56
AB  - Thirty-two children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
      undergoing a 4 week double-blind medication assessment (methylphenidate) and 32
      normal controls were studied using event-related potentials (ERPs). The ERPs were
      recorded from 13 active electrodes during a visual feature detection task.
      Significant age effects were found in N2, P3a and P3b latencies, that did not
      interact with group. The P3a and P3b latencies were significantly longer in the
      ADHD children on baseline testing; there were no latency differences between the 
      groups of children when the normal controls were compared with the ADHD children 
      on their optimal drug dosage (as determined by extensive behavioural and
      cognitive assessments). There were no significant distributional effects either
      between groups, or with the ADHD children as a function of medication; there were
      also no significant differences in reaction time measures. Thus, only the ERPs
      reflected slowed processing in the ADHD children that normalized on appropriate
      medication.

TI  - Relative efficacy of the proposed Space Shuttle antimotion sickness medications.
PG  - 375-83
AB  - Space motion sickness has been estimated as affecting between 1/3 and 1/2 of all 
      space flight participants. NASA has at the moment proposed a combination of
      promethazine and ephedrine (P/E) and one of scopolamine and dextroamphetamine
      (S/D), both given orally, as well as a transdermally applied scopolamine (TAS),
      as preventive and ameliorative measures. The reported double-blind study, tests
      the early phase actions and efficacy of the transdermal scopolamine (Transderm
      (TM)-V of ALZA Corporation) and compares these in detail to the oral medications.
      Motion sickness resistance was tested by standardized head movements while
      accelerating at 0.2 degree/sec2 to a maximum rotation of 240 degrees/sec, with an
      intermediate plateau of 10 min at 180 degrees/sec. To permit weighting motion
      sickness protection against other system influences, cardiovascular,
      psychological (subjective and objective), and visual parameter changes were
      documented for the three therapeutic modes. The relative impact of the various
      modalities on operational and experimental components of space missions is
      discussed. A comparison to intramuscularly administered promethazine (a backup
      therapeutic mode suggested for Space Shuttle use) is also included.
