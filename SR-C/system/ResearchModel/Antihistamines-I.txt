TI  - Comparison of cetirizine, ebastine and loratadine in the treatment of immediate
      mosquito-bite allergy.
PG  - 534-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: People frequently experience whealing and delayed papules from
      mosquito bites. Whealing is mediated by antisaliva immunoglobulin (Ig)E
      antibodies and histamine. Cetirizine, ebastine and loratadine have earlier shown 
      effects on mosquito-bite reactions but no comparative studies exist. METHODS: A
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study was performed with cetirizine 
      10 mg, ebastine 10 mg and loratadine 10 mg in 29 mosquito-bite-sensitive adults
      exposed to Aedes aegypti mosquito-bites. The size of the bite lesion and the
      intensity of pruritus (visual analog scale) were measured at 15 min and 2, 6 and 
      24 h. RESULTS: Cetirizine and ebastine, but not loratadine, decreased
      significantly the size of whealing (P < 0.01) and accompanying pruritus (P <
      0.001) compared to placebo. Cetirizine was most effective on pruritus but caused 
      more often sedation than ebastine or loratadine. The delayed bite symptoms
      remained too faint for any statistical comparison. CONCLUSION: This comparative
      study in mosquito-bite-sensitive adults shows that cetirizine and ebastine
      decrease significantly whealing and accompanying pruritus, and that cetirizine
      seems to be the most effective against pruritus.

TI  - Variant effect of first- and second-generation antihistamines as clues to their
      mechanism of action on the sneeze reflex in the common cold.
PG  - 1483-8
AB  - Treatment with first-generation antihistamines reduces sneezing, rhinorrhea,
      nasal mucus weight, and, in some instances, cough in subjects with experimental
      or natural colds; however, treatment with second-generation antihistamines has
      not been effective for these complaints in trials in subjects with natural colds.
      This article reports the negative results of a clinical trial with loratadine, a 
      second-generation antihistamine, in adults in the rhinovirus challenge model.
      This finding in the highly controlled setting of the challenge model confirms the
      earlier negative studies with second-generation antihistamines in natural colds. 
      First-generation antihistamines block both histaminic and muscarinic receptors as
      well as passing the blood-brain barrier. Second-generation antihistamines mainly 
      block histaminic receptors and do not pass the blood-brain barrier. The
      effectiveness of first-generation antihistamines in blocking sneezing in colds
      may be due primarily to neuropharmacological manipulation of histaminic and
      muscarinic receptors in the medulla.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of loratadine versus fexofenadine in the treatment of
      seasonal allergic rhinitis: a double-blind comparison with crossover treatment of
      nonresponders.
PG  - 760-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nonsedating antihistamines are well-established treatment for
      seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR), but patients do not always respond to the first
      antihistamine prescribed. OBJECTIVE: This double-blind, double-dummy, randomized,
      2-phase, multicenter study was designed primarily to compare the therapeutic
      responses to loratadine and fexofenadine in patients who failed initial therapy
      with the other drug. METHODS: Male and female patients aged 12 to 60 years
      received loratadine 10 mg once daily (n = 331) or fexofenadine 60 mg twice daily 
      (n = 328) for 14 days (phase 1); nonresponders (ie, those who had <25% reduction 
      in the sum of 5 SAR symptoms rated by the investigator on a 4-point scale)
      subsequently received the alternate medication for 14 days (phase 2). The
      investigator's rating of relief (complete, marked, moderate, or slight relief of 
      symptoms or treatment failure) at the end of phase 2 was the primary efficacy
      measure; changes in total symptom severity (TSS) assessed by the investigator
      (4-point scale) and the patient (11-point visual analog scale) were secondary
      measures. RESULTS: Mean decreases in TSS were significantly greater with
      loratadine than with fexofenadine for the 659 patients who completed phase 1
      (-12.7 vs -10.2, respectively; P = 0.019; patient assessment) and for the 389
      patients who responded to initial therapy (-6.6 vs -6.1, respectively; P = 0.037;
      investigator assessment). Of the 389 patients who responded to initial therapy,
      61.0% had received loratadine and 57.0% had received fexofenadine. More
      nonresponders to initial therapy had moderate, marked, or complete relief of
      symptoms after switching to loratadine than after switching to fexofenadine
      (62.4% vs 51.2%, respectively; P = 0.005) and treatment failure in 10.6% vs
      21.7%, respectively (P = 0.011). CONCLUSION: Overall, ioratadine provided
      significantly better therapeutic response than fexofenadine in patients who
      failed to respond to initial therapy with the other drug.

TI  - Inhibition of histamine or allergen-induced wheals by a single dose of
      acrivastine, fexofenadine or cetirizine.
PG  - 351-5
AB  - Certirizine, a potent H1-blocking agent, is often recommended as an emergency
      drug in anaphylactic reactions because of its well documented fast onset of
      action. In this randomized, cross-over study we compared the onset of action
      after a single dose of two recently introduced antihistamines, acrivastine and
      fexofenadine, with that of cetirizine. The inhibition of the wheal-and-flare
      reaction produced by skin prick test with histamine in 20 healthy volunteers and 
      with a relevant pollen allergen in 20 atopic patients, respectively, were
      measured before and at regular intervals up to 60 min after the ingestion of
      acrivastine (8 mg and 16 mg), fexofenadine (120 mg) and cetirizine (10 mg and 20 
      mg). Wheal-and-flare reaction were significantly inhibited 20 min after the
      intake of 16 mg acrivastine in atopic patients and 30 min after intake of 8 mg
      acrivastine in healthy volunteers, whereas cetirizine produced a significant
      inhibition of the wheal-and-flare reaction within 40-60 min. No significant
      inhibition could be observed within 60 min after fexofenadine intake. Therefore, 
      in clinical settings when a fast onset of the H1-blocking action is mandatory
      (e.g., after insect stings or for short-term prophylaxis) we recommend
      acrivastine.

TI  - Double-blind comparison of cetirizine and loratadine in children ages 2 to 6
      years with perennial allergic rhinitis.
PG  - 149-55
AB  - Antihistamines are the pharmacologic cornerstone of treatment for allergic
      rhinitis. The comparative effects of the newer, more specific H (1) -antagonists 
      cetirizine and loratadine among younger patients are not well characterized. The 
      efficacy and safety of cetirizine and loratadine were compared in a prospective, 
      randomized, double-blind, longitudinal, parallel-group study of 80 children, 2 to
      6 years of age, with perennial allergic rhinitis caused by house dust mites or
      plant pollens (verified by a radioallergosorbent or skin test). Patients received
      cetirizine or loratadine at 0.2 mg/kg once daily in the morning for 28 days.
      Histamine skin tests and eosinophil counts from nasal smears were performed at
      baseline and at the end of treatment. Individual rhinitis symptoms were assessed 
      by the investigator at baseline and on day 28 and by parents at baseline and
      daily in symptom diaries. Global assessments were made by using a visual analog
      scale at baseline and at the end of treatment. Cetirizine produced significantly 
      greater inhibition of the wheal response compared with loratadine (P <.0001).
      Eosinophil counts were improved to a comparable degree with both agents.
      Cetirizine and loratadine produced comparable improvements in symptoms and
      according to a global evaluation as assessed by the investigator at the end of
      treatment. Both agents produced substantial symptomatic relief according to
      patients' daily diary assessments; however, cetirizine was more effective than
      loratadine in relieving the symptoms of rhinorrhea, sneezing, nasal obstruction, 
      and nasal pruritus (P <. 0001). Both treatments were well tolerated; two patients
      receiving cetirizine were dropped from the study because of adverse events.
      Cetirizine and loratadine provided effective, well-tolerated relief of the
      symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis in small children. Cetirizine was more
      effective than loratadine in inhibiting the wheal response to histamine challenge
      and afforded greater reductions in most individual symptoms assessed daily by the
      parent.

TI  - Link between patient preferences and treatment outcomes in seasonal allergic
      rhinitis: an empiric investigation.
PG  - 268-77
AB  - In a multicenter, parallel-group, double-masked, randomized study, two
      questionnaires were administered to a clinical study population to identify which
      specific symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis patients perceived as most
      important to relieve (personal preferences) and to learn whether any relationship
      existed between patient preferences and the severity of their symptoms during
      treatment with antihistamines. The group was composed of 256 males and 313
      females. Their mean age was 32.4 years, and mean duration of seasonal allergic
      rhinitis was 14.5 years, with mean age of onset of 17.7 years. After receiving
      placebo for 1 week, patients were randomly allocated to receive an antihistamine 
      (fexofenadine or loratadine) for 2 weeks. Patient preferences for relief of
      individual allergy symptoms (rhinitis; sneezing; itchy, watery, red eyes; itchy
      nose, palate, or throat) and related conditions (fatigue, physical limitations)
      were scored using 2 different questionnaires before treatment (0-to-10 category
      rating scale for assessing the 4 symptoms of allergic rhinitis) and after
      receiving placebo for 1 week (Feeling Thermometer). Symptom severity was reported
      in patient diaries after 1 and 2 weeks of antihistamine treatment and was
      measured by patient self-assessment. All symptoms were considered by the patients
      to be important to relieve, the most important being itchy, watery, red eyes and 
      rhinorrhea. The severity of allergy symptoms was consistently related to the
      importance of symptoms identified before treatment. Therefore, including patient 
      preferences in medical evaluations might be a useful tool in evaluating the
      success of their treatment.

TI  - Differential effects of new-generation H1-receptor antagonists in pruritic
      dermatoses.
PG  - 180-3
AB  - In search of an improved treatment of pruritic dermatoses, we have studied
      azelastine, a novel H1-receptor antagonist, during a 2-week treatment period,
      using a double-blind, placebo-controlled design. The potent H1-antagonist
      cetirizine was used for comparison. Symptoms were recorded daily by the patients 
      on a diary card, using a 4-point scale. The same parameters and adverse events
      were evaluated at weekly intervals, and global improvement was evaluated at the
      end of treatment. In all 230 evaluable patients with moderate to severe itching, 
      azelastine caused an overall significant improvement in comparison to placebo (P 
      = 0.02), with significance also for pruritus (P = 0.01 after 1 week and P = 0.02 
      after 2 weeks). Both drugs reduced itching more effectively in urticaria than in 
      atopic eczema. Azelastine was superior to cetirizine in reducing pruritus,
      whereas cetirizine caused a more marked reduction of whealing. Both drugs rarely 
      caused fatigue and dry mouth, but taste perversion occurred only in
      azelastine-treated patients (9.7%) and headaches only with cetirizine (10.4%).
      Therefore, the two H1-blockers exert differential effects on pruritus verses
      whealing and a distinctive adverse events pattern. The data also underline the
      low efficacy of antihistamines in atopic eczema, compared to urticaria.

TI  - A parallel-group comparison of astemizole and loratadine for the treatment of
      perennial allergic rhinitis.
PG  - 175-81
AB  - The efficacy and safety of the two antihistamines, astemizole and loratadine,
      were compared in a double-blind study of 84 patients with perennial allergic
      rhinitis. Patients were randomized to receive orally either astemizole 10 mg once
      daily (n = 40) or loratadine 10 mg once daily (n = 44) for 1 week. No other
      antirhinitis medication was allowed during the study. By day 7 the mean daily
      symptom scores, recorded on diary cards, were lower in patients receiving
      astemizole than in those receiving loratadine for runny nose, itchy nose and
      sneezing, although not for blocked nose, and treatment differences only reached
      statistical significance for runny nose. After 7 days, 53.75% of patients on
      astemizole and 38.6% on loratadine were free of symptoms, and 87% of patients on 
      astemizole described the treatment as good or excellent compared with 62% on
      loratadine. The present results suggest that astemizole may be more effective
      than loratadine in controlling symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis.

TI  - Cetirizine versus hydroxyzine and placebo in chronic idiopathic urticaria.
PG  - 1075-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the safety and efficacy of cetirizine with that of
      hydroxyzine and placebo in the treatment of chronic idiopathic urticaria. DESIGN:
      A 4-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled 
      safety and efficacy study. SETTING: Patients were treated in a variety of allergy
      practice settings. PATIENTS: The study population consisted of 188 patients who
      were at least 12 years of age, with symptomatic chronic idiopathic urticaria that
      had occurred episodically for at least 6 weeks. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were
      given either cetirizine 10 mg once daily, hydroxyzine 25 mg tid, or placebo for 4
      weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients and investigators used a 4-point scale to 
      evaluate symptoms of urticaria and adverse effects of treatment. Ratings were
      compared among those taking cetirizine, hydroxyzine, or placebo. RESULTS: After 1
      day of treatment, patients randomized to receive cetirizine 10 mg/d exhibited a
      reduction in the number of episodes of urticaria (and a reduction in pruritus)
      compared with patients who received hydroxyzine 25 mg tid and patients who
      received placebo (p = 0.002). The number of urticarial episodes in patients
      treated with hydroxyzine did not reach significance until day 2 (p = 0.001).
      Compared with patients who received placebo, patients who received cetirizine and
      those who received hydroxyzine showed reductions during weeks 1, 2, and 3 and at 
      end-point analysis in the number and size of lesions and in the severity of
      pruritus (p < 0.04). Patient and physician evaluations at the end of week 4
      revealed an improvement in urticarial symptoms for the hydroxyzine and cetirizine
      groups compared with the placebo group (p < 0.001). Four patients in the
      hydroxyzine group, 1 patient in the cetirizine group, and 1 patient in the
      placebo group discontinued the study because of sedation. No patient withdrew
      because of lack of efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Cetirizine 10 mg once daily was
      equivalent to hydroxyzine 25 mg tid in controlling the symptoms of patients with 
      chronic urticaria, as assessed by patient and investigator evaluations.

TI  - Cetirizine and astemizole therapy for chronic idiopathic urticaria: a
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, comparative trial.
PG  - 192-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cetirizine and astemizole have been shown to be safe and effective in
      the treatment of patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria. Cetirizine brings
      about clinical benefit more rapidly. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to 
      compare the efficacy of single daily doses of cetirizine and astemizole in
      relieving the symptoms of chronic idiopathic urticaria, with particular emphasis 
      on the commencement of action. METHODS: Patients with chronic idiopathic
      urticaria were randomly assigned to relieve either 10 mg of cetirizine, 10 mg of 
      astemizole, or placebo for 4 weeks in a multicenter double-blind trial. Patients 
      rated symptom severity each night, and investigators rated symptoms weekly.
      RESULTS: One hundred eighty-seven patients were enrolled in the trial; 180 were
      included in the safety analysis and 177 were included in at least one efficacy
      analysis. Both cetirizine and astemizole were significantly superior to placebo
      in relieving symptoms of chronic idiopathic urticaria. Both patients' and
      investigators' ratings indicated that cetirizine acted more rapidly. Both active 
      treatments were well tolerated, and the incidence of somnolence did not differ
      statistically between cetirizine (14.5%) and astemizole (10.3%). CONCLUSION: Both
      cetirizine and astemizole provide effective relief of the symptoms of chronic
      idiopathic urticaria with similar side-effect profiles. However, clinical benefit
      occurs significantly more rapidly with cetirizine.

      of Dutch experience, 1989-94.
PG  - 234-42
AB  - The review summarizes the major results of eight double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, volunteer studies undertaken by three independent
      institutions for showing the effects on actual driving performance of "sedating" 
      and "nonsedating" antihistamines (respectively, triprolidine, diphenhydramine,
      clemastine and terfenadine, loratadine, cetirizine, acrivastine, mizolastine, and
      ebastine). A common, standardized test was used that measures driving impairment 
      from vehicular "weaving" (i.e., standard deviation of lateral position (SDLP)).
      Logical relationships were found between impairment and dose, time after dosing, 
      and repeated doses over 4-5 days. The newer drugs were generally less impairing, 
      but differences existed among their effects, and none was unimpairing at doses
      1-2x the currently recommended levels. One or possibly two of the newer drugs
      possessed both performance-enhancing and -impairing properties, depending on
      dose, suggesting two mechanisms of action.

AB  - This study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of loratadine and
      astemizole for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis. A total of 167 adult 
      patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis was enrolled in a randomized
      double-blind, parallel group study. Patients were treated once daily for 2 months
      during a spring allergy season. Both treatment groups showed significant
      reduction of symptoms (P < .01) from baseline. The physicians' and patients'
      evaluations of response to treatment were generally higher for loratadine than
      astemizole but only reached statistical significance (P < .05) at the 1-week
      evaluation. Astemizole-treated patients showed statistically significantly more
      weight gain than did loratadine-treated patients. Loratadine and astemizole were 
      comparable in reducing the signs and symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis. Both
      treatments were well tolerated, although less weight gain was observed in
      patients treated with loratadine.

TI  - A comparison of the efficacy of azelastine nasal spray and loratidine tablets in 
      the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis.
PG  - 268-75
AB  - A total of 30 patients suffering from seasonal allergic rhinitis were treated in 
      a 6-week randomized, double-blind, double-dummy parallel-group study, comparing
      azelastine nasal spray (0.14 mg/nostril administered twice daily) and loratidine 
      tablets (10 mg once daily). Symptoms evaluated were sneezing, nose and/or eye
      itching, lacrimation, rhinorrhoea, photophobia, nasal occlusion, throat
      irritation, smell loss, nasal mucosa swelling, conjunctivitis, and pharyngeal
      mucosa reddening. Each symptom was assessed according to severity and given a
      score on a four-point rating scale. Compared with baseline, total symptom scores 
      for both the azelastine and loratidine treatment groups were reduced at each of
      the assessments during treatment. No significant differences were observed
      between the two treatment groups. The investigator concluded that azelastine,
      formulated as a nasal spray, is as effective as loratidine tablets in the relief 
      of the symptoms of seasonal rhinitis and that it has a rapid onset of action.
