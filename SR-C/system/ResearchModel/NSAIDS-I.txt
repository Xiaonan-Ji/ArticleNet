TI  - Comparing the efficacy of cyclooxygenase 2-specific inhibitors in treating
      osteoarthritis: appropriate trial design considerations and results of a
      randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 3102-11
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of the cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2)-specific
      inhibitors celecoxib and rofecoxib in treating the signs and symptoms of
      osteoarthritis (OA). METHODS: In this randomized, placebo-controlled,
      double-blind, multicenter study, 475 patients with OA of the knee received either
      celecoxib 200 mg/day (n = 189), rofecoxib 25 mg/day (n = 190), or placebo (n =
      96) for 6 weeks. Arthritis assessments were performed at baseline, week 3, and
      week 6 (or at the time of early termination). RESULTS: In primary measures of
      efficacy (OA pain score on a 100-mm visual analog scale [VAS] and total domain
      score on the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index),
      celecoxib 200 mg/day and rofecoxib 25 mg/day demonstrated similar efficacy. At
      week 6, celecoxib was associated with a 34-mm mean improvement on the VAS for OA 
      pain, compared with 31.6 mm for rofecoxib and 21.2 mm for placebo. The difference
      between celecoxib and rofecoxib was -2.5 mm, with an upper limit of the 95%
      confidence interval of 2.7 mm and within the prespecified definition of
      noninferiority. Secondary measures of efficacy showed similar results. All
      differences in primary and secondary measures of efficacy between the 2 active
      treatments and placebo were statistically significant (P < 0.02), whereas all of 
      the comparisons of efficacy between celecoxib and rofecoxib met the predefined
      criteria for noninferiority. All treatments were well tolerated throughout the
      study, with similar proportions of patients withdrawing due to adverse events.
      CONCLUSION: Celecoxib 200 mg/day and rofecoxib 25 mg/day are equally efficacious 
      in treating the signs and symptoms of OA.

TI  - Gastrointestinal tolerability and effectiveness of rofecoxib versus naproxen in
      the treatment of osteoarthritis: a randomized, controlled trial.
PG  - 539-46
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity mediated by dual cyclooxygenase
      (COX)-1 and COX-2 inhibition of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can
      cause serious alterations of mucosal integrity or, more commonly, intolerable GI 
      symptoms that may necessitate discontinuation of therapy. Unlike NSAIDs,
      rofecoxib targets only the COX-2 isoform. OBJECTIVE: To assess the tolerability
      of rofecoxib compared with naproxen for treatment of osteoarthritis. DESIGN:
      Randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: 600 office and clinical research sites.
      PATIENTS: 5557 patients (mean age, 63 years) with a baseline diagnosis of
      osteoarthritis of the knee, hip, hand, or spine. INTERVENTION: Rofecoxib, 25
      mg/d, or naproxen, 500 mg twice daily. Use of routine medications, including
      aspirin, was permitted. MEASUREMENTS: Discontinuation due to GI adverse events
      (primary end point) and use of concomitant medication to treat GI symptoms
      (secondary end point). Efficacy was determined by patient-reported global
      assessment of disease status and the Australian/Canadian Osteoarthritis Hand
      Index, as well as discontinuations due to lack of efficacy. Patients were
      evaluated at baseline and at weeks 6 and 12. RESULTS: Rates of cumulative
      discontinuation due to GI adverse events were statistically significantly lower
      in the rofecoxib group than in the naproxen group (5.9% vs. 8.1%; relative risk, 
      0.74 [95% CI, 0.60 to 0.92]; P = 0.005), as were rates of cumulative use of
      medication to treat GI symptoms (9.1% vs. 11.2%; relative risk, 0.79 [CI, 0.66 to
      0.96]; P = 0.014]). Subgroup analysis of patients who used low-dose aspirin (13%)
      and those who previously discontinued using arthritis medication because of GI
      symptoms (15%) demonstrated a relative risk similar to the overall sample for
      discontinuation due to GI adverse events (relative risk, 0.56 [CI, 0.31 to 1.01] 
      and 0.53 [CI, 0.34 to 0.84], respectively). No statistically significant
      difference was observed between treatments for efficacy in treating
      osteoarthritis or for occurrence of other adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: In
      patients with osteoarthritis treated for 12 weeks, rofecoxib, 25 mg/d, was as
      effective as naproxen, 500 mg twice daily, but had statistically significantly
      superior GI tolerability and led to less use of concomitant GI medications.
      Benefits of rofecoxib in subgroup analyses were consistent with findings in the
      overall sample.

TI  - A randomised, double-blind, clinical trial comparing the efficacy of nimesulide, 
      celecoxib and rofecoxib in osteoarthritis of the knee.
PG  - 37-46
AB  - Joint pain is the main complaint in patients affected by osteoarthritis (OA), and
      NSAIDs are commonly used to treat pain associated with OA. Over the past few
      years, cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2-selective inhibitors have been proved to have
      certain advantages over non-selective NSAIDs and have been increasingly used for 
      pain management in patients with OA. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this
      randomised, double-blind, within-patient study was to compare the analgesic
      efficacy of three COX-2 inhibitors in 30 patients affected by symptomatic OA of
      the knee. We evaluated the effects of oral nimesulide (100mg), celecoxib (200mg) 
      and rofecoxib (25mg). Each drug was administered for 7 days. METHODS: Analgesic
      efficacy was determined using the patient's assessment of pain on a visual
      analogue scale (VAS) and by total pain relief over 3 hours (TOPAR3) on the first 
      and last days of treatment. In addition, the overall analgesic efficacy and
      tolerability were determined by a global assessment by the patient at the end of 
      each week of treatment, using 5-point categorical scales. At the end of the
      study, each patient was asked about which of the three forms of treatment they
      would choose as a continuation of the pain therapy. RESULTS: Taking all the
      results into consideration, nimesulide proved to be significantly more effective 
      in providing symptomatic relief than did celecoxib and rofecoxib. Furthermore,
      nimesulide provided more rapid relief of pain associated with walking than did
      the other two drugs tested. Patients expressed similar preference for nimesulide 
      and rofecoxib, but a lesser preference for celecoxib treatment. No patient
      withdrew from the study because of adverse events and the three different forms
      of treatment were generally safe and well tolerated. CONCLUSION: The present data
      confirm our previous observations in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, further 
      suggesting that nimesulide represents an effective agent for the treatment of
      joint pain, with particular reference to the rapid onset of its analgesic effect.

TI  - Cardiovascular thrombotic events in arthritis trials of the cyclooxygenase-2
      inhibitor celecoxib.
PG  - 411-8
AB  - To determine whether the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor celecoxib affects
      cardiovascular thrombotic risk, we analyzed the incidence of cardiovascular
      events for celecoxib, placebo, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 
      in the entire controlled, arthritis clinical trial database for celecoxib. The
      primary analysis used the Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration end points, which
      include: (1) cardiovascular, hemorrhagic, and unknown deaths, (2) nonfatal
      myocardial infarction, and (3) nonfatal stroke. Other secondary thrombotic events
      were also examined. Separate analyses were performed for all patients and for
      those not taking aspirin. Data from all controlled, completed arthritis trials of
      > or =4 weeks duration, including 13 new drug application studies and 2 large
      post-marketing trials (CLASS and SUCCESS) were included for analyses. Patients
      were randomized to celecoxib at doses from 100 to 400 mg twice daily (18,942
      patients; 5,668.2 patient-years of exposure), diclofenac 50 to 75 mg twice daily,
      ibuprofen 800 mg thrice daily, naproxen 500 mg twice daily (combined NSAID
      exposure of 11,143 patients; 3,612.2 patient-years), or placebo (1,794 subjects; 
      199.9 subject-years). Data from a long-term uncontrolled trial with 5,209
      patients (6,950 patients-years) treated with celecoxib were included in a
      supplemental analysis. The entire 15-trial database was searched for possible
      serious thrombotic events as well as to identify all deaths. For these patients, 
      detailed clinical data were obtained and reviewed by 2 of the investigators (WBW 
      and JSB), who were independently and blinded to exposure, to classify the event
      as primary, secondary, or neither. All analyses were done using the
      intent-to-treat population, and time-to-event analyses were performed using
      per-patient data. To examine heterogeneity of results among studies, tests of
      interaction were performed using the Cox model. Incidences of the primary and
      secondary events were not significantly different between the celecoxib and
      placebo groups, nor for the celecoxib group compared with the NSAIDs group,
      regardless of aspirin use and NSAID type. The relative risks comparing celecoxib 
      with the NSAIDs for the primary events were 1.06 (95% confidence interval 0.70 to
      1.61, p = 0.79) for all patients, and 0.86 (95% confidence interval 0.48 to 1.56,
      p = 0.62) for the subgroup not taking aspirin. Similarly, for secondary
      cardiovascular end points, all relative risks were < or =1 for celecoxib compared
      with either placebo or NSAIDs. These comparative analyses demonstrate no evidence
      of increased risk of cardiovascular thrombotic events associated with celecoxib
      compared with either conventional NSAIDs or placebo.

TI  - Interaction of rofecoxib and celecoxib with warfarin.
PG  - 1319-23
AB  - The interaction of celecoxib and rofecoxib with warfarin was studied. Patients
      stable on warfarin therapy and concurrently taking a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)
      inhibitor comparator (traditional nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications,
      salsalate, or acetaminophen) randomly received celecoxib 200 mg/day or rofecoxib 
      25 mg/day for three weeks. After a one-week washout period, the patients were
      crossed over to treatment with the opposite COX-2 inhibitor for three more weeks.
      The International Normalized Ratio (INR) was measured at baseline and at weeks 1,
      2, and 3 of therapy with each COX-2 inhibitor by testing blood samples obtained
      by finger stick. Data for 16 patients were analyzed. The INR increased by 13%,
      6%, and 5% on average in patients taking celecoxib at weeks 1, 2, and 3,
      respectively, and by 5%, 9%, and 5% in patients taking rofecoxib. Changes in the 
      INR were statistically significant at week 1 for celecoxib and at week 2 for
      rofecoxib. Of the 12 subjects who had a clinically significant > or = 15% change 
      in the INR while receiving either COX-2 inhibitor, 4 showed this change for both 
      agents. Adverse drug reactions were similar for each COX-2 inhibitor, but the
      rate of edema requiring medical intervention was higher in the rofecoxib group.
      Significant increases in the INR were observed in patients who were stable on
      warfarin therapy after the addition of therapy with rofecoxib or celecoxib.

TI  - Valdecoxib is as effective as diclofenac in the management of rheumatoid
      arthritis with a lower incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers: results of a 26-week
      trial.
PG  - 1207-15
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and upper gastrointestinal (GI) safety of
      valdecoxib 20 and 40 mg daily with those of diclofenac 75 mg slow release (SR)
      twice daily in treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Seven hundred and
      twenty-two patients with adult-onset RA were enrolled into this 26-week,
      randomized, multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group study (246 in the
      valdecoxib 20 mg daily arm, 237 in the valdecoxib 40 mg daily arm and 239 in the 
      diclofenac 75 mg SR daily arm). Acetylsalicylic acid use (< or =325 mg per day)
      was similar across all groups: 5.4% in the diclofenac group, 5.7% in the
      valdecoxib 20 mg group and 5.9% in the valdecoxib 40 mg group. Efficacy was
      measured by the Patient's Assessment of Arthritis Pain [visual analogue scale
      (VAS)] and the modified Health Assessment Questionnaire (mHAQ) at baseline and at
      weeks 2, 6, 8, 12, 18 and 26 of treatment, or at early termination. Upper GI
      safety was evaluated by endoscopy at the end of treatment, which took place no
      more than 2 days after the last dose of study medication or at early termination.
      RESULTS: Valdecoxib 20 and 40 mg daily were comparable to diclofenac 75 mg SR
      twice daily in treating the signs and symptoms of RA. No significant differences 
      were observed between treatment groups with respect to mean changes from baseline
      in the Patient's Assessment of Arthritis Pain (VAS) or mHAQ. The incidence of
      gastroduodenal ulcers in patients receiving valdecoxib 20 mg daily (6%) and
      valdecoxib 40 mg daily (4%) was significantly lower (P < 0.001) than in patients 
      receiving diclofenac 75 mg SR twice daily (16%). Valdecoxib 20 mg daily was also 
      associated with significantly improved GI tolerability (P = 0.035) compared with 
      diclofenac. CONCLUSIONS: Single daily doses of valdecoxib 20 and 40 mg provided
      efficacy comparable to that of diclofenac, with a superior upper GI safety
      profile in the long-term treatment of RA patients.

TI  - Incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers in patients with rheumatoid arthritis after 12
      weeks of rofecoxib, naproxen, or placebo: a multicentre, randomised, double blind
      study.
PG  - 820-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies in patients with osteoarthritis have suggested that 
      the selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor rofecoxib results in less
      gastrointestinal damage than non-selective non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs
      (NSAIDs). This study compared the incidence of endoscopically detected
      gastroduodenal ulcers in rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with rofecoxib or 
      a non-selective NSAID. METHODS: In this multicentre, randomised, double blind, 12
      week study, patients with rheumatoid arthritis were allocated to rofecoxib 50 mg 
      once daily (n=219), naproxen 500 mg twice daily (n=220), or placebo (n=221).
      Endoscopy was performed at baseline and at six and 12 weeks. Lifetable analysis
      and log rank tests were used to analyse the incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers > 
      or =3 mm. Gastric or duodenal ulcers > or =5 mm and erosions were also evaluated 
      as secondary end points. Tolerability was assessed by adverse events. RESULTS:
      The cumulative incidence of ulcers > or =3 mm at 12 weeks was significantly
      higher in patients on naproxen (25.5%) than in patients receiving rofecoxib
      (6.8%; difference 18.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 11.7%, 25.7%); p<0.001) or 
      placebo (2.9%; difference 22.6% (95% CI 16.1%, 29.1%); p<0.001). The difference
      between rofecoxib (6.8%) and placebo (2.9%) did not reach statistical
      significance (p=0.066). Results were similar for ulcers > or =5 mm and for mean
      changes from baseline in the number of gastroduodenal erosions. The overall
      incidence of clinical adverse events was similar among treatment groups (61% of
      patients on placebo, 62% in patients on rofecoxib, and 66% in patients on
      naproxen). CONCLUSIONS: Rofecoxib 50 mg daily (twice the dose recommended for
      this patient population) resulted in a lower incidence of endoscopically detected
      gastroduodenal ulcers and erosions than treatment with naproxen 500 mg twice
      daily.

TI  - Celecoxib versus diclofenac and omeprazole in reducing the risk of recurrent
      ulcer bleeding in patients with arthritis.
PG  - 2104-10
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommend that patients at risk for ulcer disease 
      who require treatment for arthritis receive nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs
      (NSAIDs) that are selective for cyclooxygenase-2 or the combination of a
      nonselective NSAID with a proton-pump inhibitor. We assessed whether celecoxib
      would be similar to diclofenac plus omeprazole in reducing the risk of recurrent 
      ulcer bleeding in patients at high risk for bleeding. METHODS: We studied
      patients who used NSAIDs for arthritis and who presented with ulcer bleeding.
      After their ulcers had healed, we randomly assigned patients who were negative
      for Helicobacter pylori to receive either 200 mg of celecoxib twice daily plus
      daily placebo or 75 mg of diclofenac twice daily plus 20 mg of omeprazole daily
      for six months. The end point was recurrent ulcer bleeding. RESULTS: In the
      intention-to-treat analysis, which included 287 patients (144 receiving celecoxib
      and 143 receiving diclofenac plus omeprazole), recurrent ulcer bleeding occurred 
      in 7 patients receiving celecoxib and 9 receiving diclofenac plus omeprazole. The
      probability of recurrent bleeding during the six-month period was 4.9 percent (95
      percent confidence interval, 3.1 to 6.7) for patients who received celecoxib and 
      6.4 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 4.3 to 8.4) for patients who
      received diclofenac plus omeprazole (difference, -1.5 percentage points; 95
      percent confidence interval for the difference, -6.8 to 3.8). Renal adverse
      events, including hypertension, peripheral edema, and renal failure, occurred in 
      24.3 percent of the patients receiving celecoxib and 30.8 percent of those
      receiving diclofenac plus omeprazole. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with a recent
      history of ulcer bleeding, treatment with celecoxib was as effective as treatment
      with diclofenac plus omeprazole, with respect to the prevention of recurrent
      bleeding. Renal toxic effects are common in high-risk patients receiving
      celecoxib or diclofenac plus omeprazole.

TI  - Comparison of low-dose rofecoxib versus 1000 mg naproxen in patients with
      osteoarthritis. Results of two randomized treatment trials of six weeks duration.
PG  - 337-44
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of rofecoxib 12.5 mg once daily to 
      naproxen 500 mg twice daily in patients > or = 40 years of age with knee or hip
      osteoarthritis (OA). METHOD: Two identical 6-week, randomized, double-blind
      studies were conducted (1 in Africa, Australia, Europe, Canada, Mexico, & South
      America; 1 in Asia). Primary endpoints were pain walking on a flat surface,
      patient global assessment of response to therapy, and investigator global
      assessment of disease status. RESULTS: Overall, 944 patients participated. For
      all efficacy endpoints, treatment effects for rofecoxib and naproxen were
      comparable and seen at the first measures of efficacy. Both compounds were
      generally well-tolerated, with an improved gastrointestinal safety profile for
      rofecoxib versus naproxen. CONCLUSIONS In these studies, rofecoxib 12.5 mg once
      daily (the lowest indicated dose) and naproxen 500 mg twice daily showed similar 
      treatment effects in OA patients. Rofecoxib and naproxen were generally well
      tolerated.

TI  - Effects of celecoxib and rofecoxib on blood pressure and edema in patients > or
      =65 years of age with systemic hypertension and osteoarthritis.
PG  - 959-63
AB  - Concomitant use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including the
      cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) specific inhibitors, with antihypertensive medication is
      common practice for many patients with arthritis. This study evaluated the
      effects of celecoxib 200 mg/day and rofecoxib 25 mg/day on blood pressure (BP)
      and edema in a 6-week, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind study in patients
      > or =65 years of age with osteoarthritis who were treated with fixed
      antihypertensive regimens. One thousand ninety-two patients received study
      medication (celecoxib, n = 549; rofecoxib, n = 543). Significantly more patients 
      in the rofecoxib group compared with the celecoxib group developed increased
      systolic BP (change >20 mm Hg plus absolute value > or =140 mm Hg) at any time
      point (14.9% vs 6.9%, p <0.01). Rofecoxib caused the greatest increase in
      systolic BP in patients receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or
      beta blockers, whereas those on calcium channel antagonists or diuretic
      monotherapy receiving either celecoxib or rofecoxib showed no significant
      increases in BP. Clinically significant new-onset or worsening edema associated
      with weight gain developed in a greater percentage of patients in the rofecoxib
      group (7.7%) compared with the celecoxib group (4.7%) (p <0.05). Thus, in
      patients with controlled hypertension on a fixed antihypertensive regimen,
      careful monitoring of BP is warranted after the initiation of celecoxib or
      rofecoxib therapy.

TI  - Incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers associated with valdecoxib compared with that 
      of ibuprofen and diclofenac in patients with osteoarthritis.
PG  - 1101-11
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether valdecoxib, at chronic arthritis doses, has the
      characteristics of a cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2) specific inhibitor, as measured by
      a reduced incidence of upper-gastrointestinal ulceration compared with
      conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). METHODS: This
      double-blind, multicentre, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study compared the 
      incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers associated with valdecoxib 10 mg daily (q.d.) 
      and 20 mg q.d. with that of ibuprofen 800 mg three times daily (t.i.d.) or
      diclofenac 75 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) when administered over a 12-week period.
      The incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers was assessed by upper-gastrointestinal
      endoscopy, performed at baseline and again at the end of week 12 (or at early
      study termination). Efficacy assessments were performed at baseline and at weeks 
      2, 6 and 12 using Patient's and Physician's Global Assessments of Arthritis.
      RESULTS: A total of 1052 osteoarthritis patients were enrolled into the trial.
      The incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers over 12 weeks was 5% in patients receiving
      valdecoxib 10 mg q.d., 4% in patients receiving valdecoxib 20 mg q.d., 7% in
      patients receiving placebo, 16% in patients receiving ibuprofen 800 mg t.i.d. (P 
      <0.05 v. placebo), and 17% in patients receiving diclofenac 75 mg b.i.d. (P <0.05
      v. placebo). The incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers at week 12 seen in the
      ibuprofen 800 mg t.i.d. and diclofenac 75 mg b.i.d. groups was significantly
      higher than that in the valdecoxib 10 mg q.d. and valdecoxib 20 mg q.d. groups (P
      <0.05). The incidence rates of gastroduodenal ulcers were not significantly
      different between the valdecoxib treatment groups or between valdecoxib- and
      placebo-treated patients. Efficacy responses to valdecoxib 10 mg and 20 mg q.d.
      were significantly greater than placebo and comparable with both ibuprofen 800 mg
      t.i.d. and diclofenac 75 mg b.i.d. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study
      demonstrate that valdecoxib has an upper-gastrointestinal safety profile typical 
      of a COX-2 specific inhibitor. Overall, the data indicate that administration of 
      valdecoxib offers similar efficacy for the treatment of osteoarthritis but
      improved upper-gastrointestinal safety compared with the conventional NSAIDs,
      ibuprofen and diclofenac, based on the significantly lower incidence of
      gastroduodenal ulcers detected by endoscopy.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of valdecoxib in treating the signs and symptoms of
      rheumatoid arthritis: a randomized, controlled comparison with placebo and
      naproxen.
PG  - 1008-16
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of the COX-2 specific inhibitor valdecoxib
      with the conventional NSAID naproxen and placebo in treating rheumatoid arthritis
      (RA). METHODS: This multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      trial compared the efficacy and safety of valdecoxib 10 mg (n=209), 20 mg (n=212)
      or 40 mg once daily (q.d.) (n=221) with naproxen 500 mg b.i.d. (n=226) or placebo
      (n=222), in treating the signs and symptoms of RA. Efficacy was assessed by the
      number of patients responding to treatment according to the American College of
      Rheumatology-Responder Index (ACR-20). RESULTS: ACR-20 response was recorded for 
      all randomized patients who received a single dose of study medication (above).
      Valdecoxib, at all administered doses, produced significant improvements in the
      ACR-20 Responder Index at weeks 2, 6 and 12 compared with placebo (P<or=0.01).
      Valdecoxib and naproxen did not differ in terms of ACR-20 response rate and the
      three doses of valdecoxib were similar to one another. All three doses of
      valdecoxib were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Single daily doses of valdecoxib 10,
      20 and 40 mg demonstrated efficacy that was superior to placebo and similar to
      naproxen in treating the signs and symptoms of RA. All three doses provided
      similar levels of efficacy.

      with naproxen in patients with osteoarthritis.
PG  - 530-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We compared the efficacy and upper gastrointestinal safety of the
      cyclooxygenase-2-specific inhibitor valdecoxib with naproxen and placebo in
      treating moderate to severe osteoarthritis of the knee. STUDY DESIGN: This
      multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study compared the
      efficacy and upper gastrointestinal tract safety of valdecoxib at dosages of 5,
      10, and 20 mg once daily with placebo and naproxen at the dosage of 500 mg twice 
      daily. POPULATION: We included patients who had been diagnosed with moderate to
      severe osteoarthritis of the knee according to the modified criteria of the
      American College of Rheumatology. OUTCOMES MEASURED: The Patient's and
      Physician's Global Assessment of Arthritis (PaGAA, PhGAA), Patient's Assessment
      of Arthritis Pain-Visual Analog Scale (PAAP-VAS), and Western Ontario and
      McMaster's Universities (WOMAC) Osteoarthritis indices were assessed at baseline 
      and at weeks 2, 6, and 12. Upper gastrointestinal ulceration was assessed by pre-
      and posttreatment endoscopies. RESULTS: Valdecoxib 10 and 20 mg once daily (but
      not 5 mg once daily) demonstrated similar efficacy to naproxen at 500 mg twice
      daily, and all 3 dosages were superior to placebo for the PaGAA, PhGAA, PAAP-VAS,
      and WOMAC Osteoarthritis indices at most assessments throughout the 12-week study
      (P <.05). The incidence of endoscopically proven ulcers was significantly higher 
      in the naproxen group than in the 5- and 10-mg valdecoxib groups, but not in the 
      20-mg valdecoxib group. All 3 valdecoxib doses were comparable to placebo in
      ulcer incidence. CONCLUSIONS: Valdecoxib (10 and 20 mg once daily) is
      significantly superior to placebo and as effective as naproxen (500 mg twice
      daily) in improving moderate to severe osteoarthritis of the knee. Upper
      gastrointestinal tract safety of valdecoxib (5 and 10 mg) was comparable to that 
      of placebo and significantly better than that of naproxen.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of the COX-2 specific inhibitor valdecoxib in the management 
      of osteoarthritis of the hip: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      comparison with naproxen.
PG  - 290-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Non-steroidal antiinflammatory agents are commonly used to treat pain 
      and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis (OA), but have poor
      gastrointestinal (GI) tolerability. This study compared the efficacy of the COX-2
      specific inhibitor valdecoxib with naproxen and placebo, in treating symptomatic 
      OA of the hip. DESIGN: This multicenter, randomized, double-blind 12-week study
      compared the efficacy and tolerability of single daily doses of valdecoxib 5 mg
      and 10 mg with placebo or naproxen 500 mg BID. Efficacy was assessed by Patient's
      and Physician's Global Assessment of Arthritis, and the WOMAC (Western Ontario
      and McMasters) OA Individual and Composite Indices. The incidence of adverse
      events was monitored throughout the study. RESULTS: Valdecoxib was clinically and
      statistically superior to placebo for Patient's and Physician's Global Assessment
      of Arthritis and for all WOMAC OA Indices over the 12 week study period (P<or=
      0.05). Valdecoxib 10 mg was similar to naproxen in terms of efficacy, and
      demonstrated greater numerical improvements compared with valdecoxib 5 mg.
      Valdecoxib 5 mg and 10 mg demonstrated similar tolerability compared to placebo
      and a lower incidence of GI-related adverse effects compared with naproxen.
      CONCLUSIONS: Single daily doses of valdecoxib 5 mg and 10 mg were similar to
      naproxen and superior to placebo, in treating symptomatic OA of the hip. Both
      doses of valdecoxib were well tolerated and demonstrated improved GI tolerability
      compared to naproxen.

TI  - Dose response and safety study of meloxicam up to 22.5 mg daily in rheumatoid
      arthritis: a 12 week multicenter, double blind, dose response study versus
      placebo and diclofenac.
PG  - 436-46
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This Phase III, placebo and active controlled, multicenter trial
      evaluated the efficacy and safety of meloxicam 7.5, 15, and 22.5 mg daily for the
      treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: A 12 week, randomized, double
      blind, double dummy, parallel group trial compared daily oral meloxicam 7.5, 15, 
      and 22.5 mg to placebo (negative control) and diclofenac 75 mg BID (positive
      control). A total of 894 patients (18 years of age with confirmed RA who flared
      following an NSAID-free period) were randomized to be treated. Baseline scores
      for all endpoints were similar among the treatment groups. Patient assessments
      were at 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks or early termination. RESULTS: All treatment
      groups demonstrated significant improvement from baseline (p < 0.001). Meloxicam 
      7.5 and 22.5 mg was significantly superior to placebo in all 5 primary efficacy
      endpoints (swollen joint count, tender joint count, patient pain, patient and
      physician global; all p < 0.05). Diclofenac 150 mg was superior to placebo for 4 
      of 5 primary efficacy measures (all but swollen joint count; p < 0.05) and
      meloxicam 15 mg was superior for 3 of 5 primary endpoints (patient pain and
      patient and physician global). AUC of patient global, patient pain, and modified 
      Health Assessment Questionnaire demonstrated dose-response (p < 0.04), while AUC 
      ACR20 showed a qualitative trend in the same direction. The rate of
      gastrointestinal (GI) events during the 12 week trial for all doses of meloxicam 
      and diclofenac did not differ significantly from placebo (23.2-32.0%). GI
      withdrawals were comparable and not significantly different across all treatment 
      groups (4.3-5.7%). CONCLUSION: This trial demonstrated a dose response
      relationship for meloxicam 7.5, 15, and 22.5 mg using AUC measurement of response
      for the treatment of RA. All 3 doses of meloxicam. and positive control, were
      effective in the treatment of RA. The overall incidence rate of GI events did not
      differ significantly from placebo in either the meloxicam treatment groups or the
      positive control.

TI  - Ulcer prevention in long-term users of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs:
      results of a double-blind, randomized, multicenter, active- and
      placebo-controlled study of misoprostol vs lansoprazole.
PG  - 169-75
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies that report prevention of ulcer recurrence among long-term
      users of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that do not stratify for
      Helicobacter pylori status may not be generalizable to the large population of
      individuals without H pylori. METHODS: This was a prospective, double-blind,
      multicenter, active- and placebo-controlled study among 537 patients without H
      pylori who were long-term users of NSAIDs and who had a history of endoscopically
      documented gastric ulcer. Patients were randomized to receive placebo, 200 microg
      of misoprostol 4 times a day, or 15 or 30 mg of lansoprazole once daily for 12
      weeks. Ulcer status was determined by endoscopy at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. RESULTS:
      Patients receiving lansoprazole (15 or 30 mg) remained free from gastric ulcer
      longer than those who received placebo (P<.001) but for a shorter time than those
      who received misoprostol. By week 12, the percentages of gastric ulcer-free
      patients were as follows: placebo, 51% (95% confidence interval [CI],
      41.1%-61.3%); misoprostol, 93% (95% CI, 87.2%-97.9%); 15-mg lansoprazole, 80%
      (95% CI, 72.5%-87.3%); and 30-mg lansoprazole, 82% (95% CI, 75.0%-89.6%). A
      significantly higher proportion of patients in the misoprostol group reported
      treatment-related adverse events and early withdrawal from the study. When the
      impact of withdrawals on ulcer development was considered (as failures), therapy 
      was successful for 69% for each of the active treatment groups and 35% for the
      placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Proton pump inhibitors such as lansoprazole are
      superior to placebo for the prevention of NSAID-induced gastric ulcers but not
      superior to misoprostol, 800 microg/d. When the poor compliance and potential
      adverse effects associated with misoprostol are considered, proton pump
      inhibitors and full-dose misoprostol are clinically equivalent.

TI  - Comparative efficacy and safety of celecoxib and naproxen in the treatment of
      osteoarthritis of the hip.
PG  - 467-79
AB  - Osteoarthritis (OA) is responsible for more disability of the lower extremities
      in the elderly than any other disease in the US. The pain associated with OA is
      the primary symptom leading to disability in these patients. Current ACR
      guidelines recommend consideration of acetaminophen for mild-to-moderate pain and
      conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or COX-2 specific
      inhibitors for moderate-to-severe OA symptoms. The aim of this study was to
      compare the efficacy and safety of the COX-1 sparing, COX-2 specific inhibitor,
      celecoxib, with the conventional NSAID naproxen, and placebo, in the treatment of
      OA of the hip. In this multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 1061
      patients with symptomatic OA of the hip were randomized to receive celecoxib at
      doses of 100 mg, 200 mg, or 400 mg/day; naproxen 1000 mg/day; or placebo, for 12 
      weeks. Patients were evaluated using standard measures of efficacy at baseline,
      2-4 days after discontinuing previous NSAID or analgesic therapy, and after 2, 6,
      and 12 weeks of treatment. All doses of celecoxib and naproxen significantly
      improved the symptoms of OA, at all time points compared with placebo. This
      sustained treatment effect of celecoxib was dose dependent. In terms of pain
      relief and improvement in functional capacity, celecoxib 200 mg/day and 400
      mg/day were similarly efficacious and were comparable to naproxen. Both drugs
      were generally well tolerated. Celecoxib at a dose of 200 mg/day is as effective 
      as a standard therapeutic dose of the conventional NSAID, naproxen, in reducing
      the pain associated with OA of the hip.

TI  - Efficacy of rofecoxib, celecoxib, and acetaminophen in osteoarthritis of the
      knee: a randomized trial.
PG  - 64-71
AB  - CONTEXT: Osteoarthritis (OA) is often treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, or specific inhibitors of cyclooxygenase 2
      (COX-2). OBJECTIVE: To assess the relative therapeutic efficacy of rofecoxib,
      celecoxib, and acetaminophen in adults with OA. DESIGN AND SETTING: Randomized,
      parallel-group, double-blind trial, conducted from June 1999 to February 2000, in
      29 clinical centers in the United States. PATIENTS: Three hundred eighty-two
      patients aged at least 40 years who had OA of the knee that was previously
      treated with NSAIDs or acetaminophen. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly
      assigned to receive rofecoxib, 12.5 mg/d (n = 96); rofecoxib, 25 mg/d (n = 95);
      celecoxib, 200 mg/d (n = 97); or acetaminophen, 4000 mg/d (n = 94) for 6 weeks.
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Assessments over days 1 to 6 and over 6 weeks included
      pain on walking, night pain, pain at rest, and morning stiffness as measured on a
      Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (100-mm visual analog 
      scale [VAS]) and global response to therapy compared among 4 treatment groups.
      RESULTS: 79% of patients completed the study. More patients treated with
      acetaminophen discontinued early due to lack of efficacy than patients treated
      with COX-2 inhibitors (31% vs 18%-19%). Efficacy assessed in the first 6 days of 
      therapy showed greatest response to rofecoxib, 25 mg/d, followed by rofecoxib,
      12.5 mg/d, celecoxib, and acetaminophen, respectively, in terms of relief of pain
      on walking (-32.2, - 29.0, - 26.4, and -20.6 mm change on the VAS; P</=.04 for
      all others vs acetaminophen; P =.05 for 25-mg rofecoxib vs celecoxib), rest pain 
      (-21.8, - 18.6, - 15.5, and - 12.5 mm; P</=.02 for either dose of rofecoxib vs
      acetaminophen and P =.02 for rofecoxib, 25 mg/d, vs celecoxib), night pain
      (-25.2, - 22.0, - 18.7, and - 18.8 mm; P =.04 for rofecoxib, 25 mg/d, vs both
      acetaminophen and celecoxib), and morning stiffness (-30.4, - 28.4, - 25.7, and -
      20.9 mm; P</=.02 for either dose of rofecoxib vs acetaminophen). Over 6 weeks,
      rofecoxib, 25 mg/d, provided greatest response for night pain (P<.002 vs
      celecoxib and P =.006 vs acetaminophen and P =.02 vs rofecoxib, 12.5 mg/d),
      composite pain subscale (P</=.03 vs all other treatments), stiffness subscale
      (P</=.04 vs celecoxib and acetaminophen), and physical function subscale (P =.001
      vs acetaminophen). Global responses over 6 weeks showed a similar pattern (good
      or excellent response at week 6: 60%, 56%, 46%, and 39%, respectively; P</=.03
      for rofecoxib, 25 mg/d, vs celecoxib and acetaminophen; P =.02 for rofecoxib,
      12.5 mg/d, vs acetaminophen). All treatments were generally safe and well
      tolerated. CONCLUSION: Rofecoxib, 25 mg/d, provided efficacy advantages over
      acetaminophen, 4000 mg/d, celecoxib, 200 mg/d, and rofecoxib, 12.5 mg, for
      symptomatic knee OA.

TI  - Reduced incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers with celecoxib, a novel
      cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, compared to naproxen in patients with arthritis.
PG  - 1019-27
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) block prostaglandin
      production by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX); they are believed to cause
      gastroduodenal damage by inhibiting the COX-1 isoform and to have analgesic and
      anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the COX-2 isoform. As compared to
      conventional NSAIDs, celecoxib, a COX-2 specific inhibitor, has been shown in
      previous single posttreatment endoscopy studies to be associated with lower
      gastroduodenal ulcer rates. In response to concerns that such studies may
      under-represent ulceration rates, the present serial endoscopy study was designed
      to compare cumulative gastroduodenal ulcer rates associated with the use of
      celecoxib to those of naproxen, a conventional NSAID. METHODS: In this
      double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter study, 537 patients with osteoarthritis
      (OA) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were randomized to treatment with celecoxib 200
      mg b.i.d. (n = 270) or naproxen 500 mg b.i.d. (n = 267) for 12 wk. Gastroduodenal
      damage was determined from esophagogastroduodenoscopy after 4, 8, and 12 wk of
      therapy. Arthritis efficacy was evaluated with Patient's and Physician's Global
      Assessments. RESULTS: Gastroduodenal ulcer rates after celecoxib and naproxen
      treatment were 4% versus 19% in the 0-4 wk interval (p < 0.001), 2% versus 14% in
      the 4-8 wk interval (p < 0.001), and 2% versus 10% in the 8-12 wk interval (p <
      0.001), respectively. After 12 wk of treatment, the cumulative incidence of
      gastroduodenal ulcers was 9% with celecoxib and 41% with naproxen. In the
      celecoxib group, gastroduodenal ulcers were significantly associated with
      Helicobacter pylori status (p < 0.05), concurrent aspirin usage (p = 0.001), and 
      a history of ulcer (p = 0.010), but not with disease type (OA/RA), age, gender,
      other relevant medical histories, or concurrent corticosteroid or
      disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs usage (p > 0.05). Celecoxib produced a
      significantly lower incidence rate of both gastric (p < 0.001) and duodenal (p < 
      0.030) ulcers. The two agents produced similar improvements in Patient's and
      Physician's Global Assessments of arthritis efficacy. The incidence of adverse
      events and withdrawal rates did not differ significantly between treatments.
      CONCLUSIONS: As compared to naproxen (500 mg b.i.d.), use of celecoxib (200 mg
      b.i.d.), a COX-2 specific agent, at the recommended RA dose and twice the most
      frequently prescribed OA dose, was associated with lower rates of gastric,
      duodenal, and gastroduodenal ulcers but had comparable efficacy, in patients with
      OA and RA.

TI  - Cyclooxygenase-2--specific inhibitors and cardiorenal function: a randomized,
      controlled trial of celecoxib and rofecoxib in older hypertensive osteoarthritis 
      patients.
PG  - 85-95
AB  - BACKGROUND: Arthritis and hypertension are common comorbid conditions affecting
      elderly adults. Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in patients treated
      with antihypertensive medication can lead to destabilization of blood pressure
      control and other cardiorenal events. The potential for similar interactions with
      cyclooxygenase-2-specific inhibitors has not been fully explored. The authors
      evaluated the cardiorenal safety of two new cyclooxygenase-2-specific inhibitors,
      celecoxib and rofecoxib. METHODS: This study was a 6-week, randomized,
      parallel-group, double-blind trial in patients with osteoarthritis who were > or 
      =65 years of age and were taking antihypertensive agents. Patients received
      once-daily celecoxib 200 mg or rofecoxib 25 mg. The primary endpoints were the
      development of edema, changes in systolic blood pressure, and changes in
      diastolic blood pressure as measured at any time point in the study. Measurements
      occurred at baseline and after 1, 2, and 6 weeks of treatment. FINDINGS: Eight
      hundred ten patients received study medication (celecoxib, n = 411; rofecoxib, n 
      = 399). Nearly twice as many rofecoxib- compared with celecoxib-treated patients 
      experienced edema (9.5% vs. 4.9%, P = 0.014). Systolic blood pressure increased
      significantly in 17% of rofecoxib- compared with 11% of celecoxib-treated
      patients (P = 0.032) at any study time point. Diastolic blood pressure increased 
      in 2.3% of rofecoxib- compared with 1.5% of celecoxib-treated patients (P =
      0.44). At week 6, the change from baseline in mean systolic blood pressure was
      +2.6 mmHg for rofecoxib compared with -0.5 mmHg for celecoxib (P = 0.007).
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients taking antihypertensive therapy and receiving
      cyclooxygenase-2-specific inhibitors should be monitored for the development of
      cardiorenal events. Patients receiving celecoxib experienced less edema and less 
      destabilization of blood pressure control compared with those receiving
      rofecoxib.

      weeks treatment in patients with osteoarthritis.
PG  - 19-24
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the incidence of selected spontaneously reported adverse
      events (AEs) in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) treated with rofecoxib (VIOXX, 
      12.5 mg qd) or Arthrotec (diclofenac 50 mg/misoprostol 200 mcg bid). METHODS:
      Double-blind, parallel-group, 6-week study of patients aged > or = 40 years with 
      a clinical diagnosis of OA treated with rofecoxib or Arthrotec. Primary endpoint:
      self-reported diarrhea; secondary endpoints: abdominal pain, discontinuations due
      to AEs, GI AEs and NSAID-type GI AEs (ie., acid reflux, dyspepsia, epigastric
      discomfort, heartburn, nausea, vomiting). RESULTS: Among 483 patients (80.3%
      females, mean age 62.1), the rofecoxib group vs the Arthrotec group respectively 
      reported diarrhea 6.2% vs 16.2% (p<0.001); drug-related diarrhea 3.7% vs 16.2%
      (p<0.001); one or more clinical AEs 52.9% vs 73.0% (p<0.001); GI AEs 28.9% vs
      48.5% (p<0.001); NSAID-type GI AEs 18.6% vs 29.9% (p=0.004); discontinuations due
      to abdominal pain 0.4% vs 3.7% (p<0.05); and discontinuations due to any AE 4.1% 
      vs 9.1% (p=0.029). No significant differences were observed in efficacy.
      CONCLUSION: Rofecoxib 12.5 mg qd has improved GI tolerability and similar
      efficacy compared to Arthrotec (diclofenac 50 mg/misoprostol 200 mcg bid).

TI  - Celecoxib versus diclofenac in the management of osteoarthritis of the knee.
PG  - 11-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A clinical trial was conducted in 600 patients with OA of the knee to 
      test the hypothesis that the specific COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, has equivalent 
      efficacy and a superior tolerability/safety profile when compared to diclofenac, 
      the current worldwide standard of care. METHODS: Patients were administered
      celecoxib 100 mg BID, diclofenac 50 mg TID or placebo for 6 weeks in a
      multicentre, double-blind. placebo-controlled trial. RESULTS: Primary efficacy
      measures (index joint pain by VAS, WOMAC index) indicated statistically
      significant improvement versus placebo for both celecoxib and diclofenac and no
      statistically significant differences between celecoxib and diclofenac. American 
      Pain Society (APS) measures to assess the rapidity of onset of action showed
      statistically significant and comparable pain relief versus placebo within 24 h
      for both celecoxib and diclofenac. More diclofenac patients reported GI side
      effects than patients treated with either placebo or celecoxib.
      Diclofenac-treated patients experienced statistically significant elevations in
      mean hepatic transaminases and serum creatinine and reductions in haemoglobin
      concentration when compared to placebo, events not observed with celecoxib.
      CONCLUSION: Celecoxib 200 mg daily is as effective as diclofenac 150 mg daily for
      relieving signs and symptoms of OA of the knee, including pain, and has a rapid
      onset of action. However, celecoxib appears to have a superior safety and
      tolerability profile.

TI  - Efficacy of celecoxib, a cyclooxygenase 2-specific inhibitor, in the treatment of
      ankylosing spondylitis: a six-week controlled study with comparison against
      placebo and against a conventional nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug.
PG  - 180-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the short-term efficacy of celecoxib, a cyclooxygenase
      2-specific inhibitor, in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis (AS). METHODS:
      The study was a 6-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 3 
      treatment arms: placebo, ketoprofen 100 mg twice daily, and celecoxib 100 mg
      twice daily. Patients who had AS according to the modified New York criteria,
      without peripheral synovitis and with active disease (pain > or =40 mm on a
      100-mm visual analog scale [VAS] and an increase in pain of at least 30% after
      nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug withdrawal) were eligible for study. Primary
      outcome measures were change in pain intensity (VAS) and change in functional
      impairment (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index [BASFI]). RESULTS: Of
      the 246 randomized patients, 76 were allocated to receive placebo, 90 ketoprofen,
      and 80 celecoxib. There were no statistically significant differences between
      treatment groups at study entry. During the 6 weeks of the study, the decrease in
      pain and functional impairment was greater in the active treatment groups than in
      the placebo group, with a trend in favor of celecoxib when the 2 active
      treatments were compared. The mean changes were -13 mm, -21 mm, and -27 mm (P =
      0.006) for pain and 1, -6, and -12 (P = 0.0008) for BASFI score in the placebo,
      ketoprofen, and celecoxib groups, respectively. During treatment, the number of
      patients reporting epigastric pain was 6 (8%), 13 (14%), and 10 (13%) in the
      placebo, ketoprofen, and celecoxib groups, respectively. CONCLUSION: The results 
      of this study confirm the clinically relevant antiinflammatory effect of
      celecoxib at a 200-mg daily dosage, with significant improvement of both pain and
      function in patients with AS.

TI  - Rofecoxib, a new cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, shows sustained efficacy, comparable
      with other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: a 6-week and a 1-year trial in
      patients with osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis Studies Group.
PG  - 1124-34
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Rofecoxib, a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor (sometimes known as a
      specific cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor or Coxib), is used in osteoarthritis (OA).
      Published information indicates rofecoxib's improved gastrointestinal safety
      profile over nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs).
      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of rofecoxib in treating OA in 2
      studies. METHODS: Two randomized, double-blind, parallel-group studies in
      patients with OA of the knee or hip were conducted using identical entry criteria
      and end points. A 6-week placebo-controlled trial in 736 patients compared 12.5
      and 25 mg of rofecoxib once daily with 800 mg of ibuprofen 3 times daily, and a
      1-year study compared 12.5 and 25 mg of rofecoxib once daily with 50 mg of
      diclofenac 3 times daily in 693 patients. RESULTS: Rofecoxib, at 12.5 and 25 mg, 
      demonstrated efficacy clinically comparable with ibuprofen, assessed by 3 primary
      end points according to predefined comparability criteria. Both rofecoxib doses
      and ibuprofen provided significantly greater efficacy than placebo on all primary
      end points at 6 weeks. Both rofecoxib doses and diclofenac showed similar
      efficacy over 1 year. All treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Rofecoxib 
      is effective in treating OA with once-daily dosing for 6 weeks and 1 year.
      Rofecoxib was generally safe and well-tolerated in OA patients for 6 weeks and 1 
      year. Arch Fam Med. 2000;9:1124-1134

TI  - Comparison of upper gastrointestinal toxicity of rofecoxib and naproxen in
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis. VIGOR Study Group.
PG  - 1520-8, 2 p following 1528
AB  - BACKGROUND: Each year, clinical upper gastrointestinal events occur in 2 to 4
      percent of patients who are taking nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory
      drugs (NSAIDs). We assessed whether rofecoxib, a selective inhibitor of
      cyclooxygenase-2, would be associated with a lower incidence of clinically
      important upper gastrointestinal events than is the nonselective NSAID naproxen
      among patients with rheumatoid arthritis. METHODS: We randomly assigned 8076
      patients who were at least 50 years of age (or at least 40 years of age and
      receiving long-term glucocorticoid therapy) and who had rheumatoid arthritis to
      receive either 50 mg of rofecoxib daily or 500 mg of naproxen twice daily. The
      primary end point was confirmed clinical upper gastrointestinal events
      (gastroduodenal perforation or obstruction, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and 
      symptomatic gastroduodenal ulcers). RESULTS: Rofecoxib and naproxen had similar
      efficacy against rheumatoid arthritis. During a median follow-up of 9.0 months,
      2.1 confirmed gastrointestinal events per 100 patient-years occurred with
      rofecoxib, as compared with 4.5 per 100 patient-years with naproxen (relative
      risk, 0.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.3 to 0.6; P<0.001). The respective
      rates of complicated confirmed events (perforation, obstruction, and severe upper
      gastrointestinal bleeding) were 0.6 per 100 patient-years and 1.4 per 100
      patient-years (relative risk, 0.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.2 to 0.8;
      P=0.005). The incidence of myocardial infarction was lower among patients in the 
      naproxen group than among those in the rofecoxib group (0.1 percent vs. 0.4
      percent; relative risk, 0.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.1 to 0.7); the
      overall mortality rate and the rate of death from cardiovascular causes were
      similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with rheumatoid arthritis,
      treatment with rofecoxib, a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2, is
      associated with significantly fewer clinically important upper gastrointestinal
      events than treatment with naproxen, a nonselective inhibitor.

TI  - Gastrointestinal toxicity with celecoxib vs nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
      for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis: the CLASS study: A randomized
      controlled trial. Celecoxib Long-term Arthritis Safety Study.
PG  - 1247-55
AB  - CONTEXT: Conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are
      associated with a spectrum of toxic effects, notably gastrointestinal (GI)
      effects, because of inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1. Whether COX-2-specific 
      inhibitors are associated with fewer clinical GI toxic effects is unknown.
      OBJECTIVE: To determine whether celecoxib, a COX-2-specific inhibitor, is
      associated with a lower incidence of significant upper GI toxic effects and other
      adverse effects compared with conventional NSAIDs. DESIGN: The Celecoxib
      Long-term Arthritis Safety Study (CLASS), a double-blind, randomized controlled
      trial conducted from September 1998 to March 2000. SETTING: Three hundred
      eighty-six clinical sites in the United States and Canada. PARTICIPANTS: A total 
      of 8059 patients (>/=18 years old) with osteoarthritis (OA) or rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA) were enrolled in the study, and 7968 received at least 1 dose of
      study drug. A total of 4573 patients (57%) received treatment for 6 months.
      INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive celecoxib, 400 mg twice
      per day (2 and 4 times the maximum RA and OA dosages, respectively; n = 3987);
      ibuprofen, 800 mg 3 times per day (n = 1985); or diclofenac, 75 mg twice per day 
      (n = 1996). Aspirin use for cardiovascular prophylaxis (</=325 mg/d) was
      permitted. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of prospectively defined symptomatic 
      upper GI ulcers and ulcer complications (bleeding, perforation, and obstruction) 
      and other adverse effects during the 6-month treatment period. RESULTS: For all
      patients, the annualized incidence rates of upper GI ulcer complications alone
      and combined with symptomatic ulcers for celecoxib vs NSAIDs were 0.76% vs 1.45% 
      (P =.09) and 2. 08% vs 3.54% (P =.02), respectively. For patients not taking
      aspirin, the annualized incidence rates of upper GI ulcer complications alone and
      combined with symptomatic ulcers for celecoxib vs NSAIDs were 0.44% vs 1.27% (P
      =.04) and 1.40% vs 2.91% (P =.02). For patients taking aspirin, the annualized
      incidence rates of upper GI ulcer complications alone and combined with
      symptomatic ulcers for celecoxib vs NSAIDs were 2.01% vs 2.12% (P =.92) and 4.70%
      vs 6.00% (P =.49). Fewer celecoxib-treated patients than NSAID-treated patients
      experienced chronic GI blood loss, GI intolerance, hepatotoxicity, or renal
      toxicity. No difference was noted in the incidence of cardiovascular events
      between celecoxib and NSAIDs, irrespective of aspirin use. CONCLUSIONS: In this
      study, celecoxib, at dosages greater than those indicated clinically, was
      associated with a lower incidence of symptomatic ulcers and ulcer complications
      combined, as well as other clinically important toxic effects, compared with
      NSAIDs at standard dosages. The decrease in upper GI toxicity was strongest among
      patients not taking aspirin concomitantly. JAMA. 2000;284:1247-1255

      rofecoxib vs ibuprofen in patients with osteoarthritis. Rofecoxib/Ibuprofen
      Comparator Study Group.
PG  - 1781-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit both
      cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). It is not known whether a 
      specific inhibitor of COX-2 will provide efficacy in osteoarthritis (OA)
      comparable with NSAIDs. Therefore, we compared the efficacy and safety of the
      rofecoxib, which specifically inhibits COX-2, with those of the NSAID ibuprofen
      in patients with OA. OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical efficacy and tolerability
      of rofecoxib (12.5 and 25 mg once daily) with ibuprofen (800 mg 3 times daily).
      METHODS: A randomized, double-blind trial of 809 adults with OA was conducted.
      Patients with OA in whom the knee or hip was the primary source of pain were
      randomized to 1 of 4 treatment groups on demonstration of disease activity:
      placebo; rofecoxib, 12.5 or 25 mg once daily; or ibuprofen, 800 mg 3 times daily.
      Clinical efficacy and safety were monitored during a 6-week treatment period.
      RESULTS: Both doses of rofecoxib demonstrated efficacy clinically comparable with
      ibuprofen as assessed by 3 primary end points (pain walking on a flat surface
      [Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index], patient global 
      assessment of response to therapy, and investigator global assessment of disease 
      status) according to predefined comparability criteria. Both rofecoxib doses and 
      the ibuprofen dose provided significantly (P<.001) greater efficacy than placebo 
      on all primary end points. Results from secondary end points were consistent with
      those of the primary end points. All treatments were well tolerated; the overall 
      incidence rates of clinical adverse experiences were not significantly different 
      (P>.05) among the treatment groups. CONCLUSION: Rofecoxib was well tolerated and 
      provided clinical efficacy comparable with a high dose of the NSAID ibuprofen.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical efficacy of rofecoxib, a specific inhibitor of
      cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), with that of diclofenac in patients with osteoarthritis
      (OA) and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of rofecoxib. METHODS: We
      performed a randomized, double-blind, active comparator-controlled trial in 784
      adults with OA of the knee or hip. Patients were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment
      groups: 12.5 mg of rofecoxib once daily, 25 mg of rofecoxib once daily, and 50 mg
      of diclofenac 3 times daily. Clinical efficacy and safety were evaluated over a
      1-year continuous treatment period. RESULTS: Rofecoxib at dosages of 12.5 and 25 
      mg demonstrated efficacy that was clinically comparable to that of diclofenac, as
      assessed by all 3 primary end points according to predefined comparability
      criteria. Results from secondary end points were consistent with those of the
      primary end points. There were small statistical differences favoring diclofenac 
      for 2 of the end points. All treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSION:
      Rofecoxib was well tolerated and provided efficacy that was clinically
      comparable, according to predefined statistical criteria, to that of 150 mg of
      diclofenac per day in this 1-year study. Specific inhibition of COX-2 provided
      therapeutic efficacy in OA.

TI  - Comparison of the effect of rofecoxib (a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor), ibuprofen, 
      and placebo on the gastroduodenal mucosa of patients with osteoarthritis: a
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The Rofecoxib Osteoarthritis 
      Endoscopy Multinational Study Group.
PG  - 370-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This randomized, double-blind study tested the hypothesis that
      rofecoxib, a drug that specifically inhibits cyclooxygenase 2, would cause fewer 
      gastroduodenal ulcers than ibuprofen (in a multicenter trial), and its side
      effects would be equivalent to those of placebo (in a prespecified analysis
      combining the results with another trial of identical design). METHODS: Seven
      hundred seventy-five patients with osteoarthritis were randomized to receive
      rofecoxib at a dosage of 25 mg or 50 mg once daily, ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times
      daily, or placebo. Gastroduodenal ulceration was assessed by endoscopy at 6, 12, 
      and (for active treatment) 24 weeks. The primary and secondary end points were
      the incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers at 12 and 24 weeks, respectively. RESULTS:
      Ulcers were significantly less common (P < 0.001) following treatment with
      rofecoxib (25 mg or 50 mg) than with ibuprofen after 12 weeks (5.3% and 8.8%
      versus 29.2%, respectively) or 24 weeks (9.9% and 12.4% versus 46.8%,
      respectively). In the combined analysis, the 12-week ulcer incidence with 25 mg
      rofecoxib (4.7%) and with placebo (7.3%) satisfied prespecified criteria for
      equivalence. CONCLUSION: At 2-4 times the therapeutically effective dose,
      rofecoxib caused fewer endoscopically detected ulcers than did ibuprofen.
      Rofecoxib at a dose of 25 mg (the highest dose recommended for osteoarthritis)
      satisfied prespecified criteria for equivalence to placebo.

TI  - Celecoxib versus diclofenac in long-term management of rheumatoid arthritis:
      randomised double-blind comparison.
PG  - 2106-11
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit
      cyclo-oxygenase (COX), which leads to suppression of COX-1-mediated production of
      gastrointestinal-protective prostaglandins. Gastrointestinal injury is a common
      outcome. We compared the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of long-term therapy 
      with celecoxib, a COX-1 sparing inhibitor of COX-2, with diclofenac, a
      non-specific COX inhibitor. METHODS: 655 patients with adult-onset rheumatoid
      arthritis of at least 6 months' duration were randomly assigned oral celecoxib
      200 mg twice daily or diclofenac SR 75 mg twice daily for 24 weeks.
      Anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity and tolerability were assessed at
      baseline, every 4 weeks, and at week 24. We assessed gastrointestinal safety by
      upper-gastrointestinal endoscopy within 7 days of the last treatment dose at
      centres where the procedure was available. Analysis was by intention-to-treat.
      FINDINGS: 430 patients underwent endoscopy (celecoxib n=212, diclofenac n=218).
      The two drugs were similar in management of rheumatoid arthritis pain and
      inflammation. Gastroduodenal ulcers were detected endoscopically in 33 (15%)
      patients treated with diclofenac and in eight (4%) in the celecoxib group
      (p<0.001). The rate of withdrawal for any gastrointestinal-related adverse event,
      most commonly abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and dyspepsia, was nearly three times
      higher in the diclofenac-treated group than in the celecoxib group (16 vs 6%;
      p<0.001). INTERPRETATION: Celecoxib showed sustained anti-inflammatory and
      analgesic activity similar to diclofenac, with a lower frequency of upper
      gastrointestinal ulceration or gastrointestinal adverse events, and tolerability 
      was better.

TI  - Anti-inflammatory and upper gastrointestinal effects of celecoxib in rheumatoid
      arthritis: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 1921-8
AB  - CONTEXT: In vitro studies have shown that celecoxib inhibits cyclooxygenase 2
      (COX-2) but not COX-1, suggesting that this drug may have anti-inflammatory and
      analgesic activity without adverse upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract effects that
      result from COX-1 inhibition. OBJECTIVE: To test whether celecoxib has efficacy
      as an anti-inflammatory and analgesic with reduced GI tract mucosal damage
      compared with conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in patients with 
      rheumatoid arthritis. DESIGN: Randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled,
      double-blind trial lasting 12 weeks, with follow-up at weeks 2, 6, and 12, from
      September 1996 thorugh February 1998. SETTING: Seventy-nine clinical sites in the
      United States and Canada. PATIENTS: A total of 1149 patients aged 18 years or
      older with symptomatic rheumatoid arthritis who met inclusion criteria were
      randomized; 688 (60%) of these completed the study. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were 
      randomized to receive celecoxib, 100 mg, 200 mg, or 400 mg twice per day (n =
      240, 235, and 218, respectively); naproxen, 500 mg twice per day (n = 225); or
      placebo (n = 231). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Improvement in signs and symptoms of
      rheumatoid arthritis as assessed using standard measures of efficacy and GI tract
      safety as assessed by upper GI tract endoscopy before and after treatment,
      compared among treatment groups. RESULTS: All dosages of celecoxib and naproxen
      significantly improved the signs and symptoms of arthritis compared with placebo.
      Maximal anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity was evident within 2 weeks of
      initiating treatment and was sustained throughout the 12 weeks. The incidence of 
      endoscopically determined gastroduodenal ulcers in placebo-treated patients was 4
      (4%) of 99, and the incidences across all dosages of celecoxib were not
      significantly different (P>.40): 9 (6%) of 148 with 100 mg twice per day, 6 (4%) 
      of 145 with 200 mg twice per day, and 8 (6%) of 130 with 400 mg twice per day. In
      contrast, the incidence with naproxen was 36 (26%) of 137, significantly greater 
      than either placebo or celecoxib (P<.001). The overall incidences of GI tract
      adverse effects were 19% for placebo; 28%, 25%, and 26% for celecoxib 100 mg, 200
      mg, and 400 mg twice per day, respectively; and 31 % for naproxen. CONCLUSION: In
      this study, all dosages of celecoxib were efficacious in the treatment of
      rheumatoid arthritis and did not affect COX-1 activity in the GI tract mucosa as 
      evidenced by less frequent incidence of endoscopic ulcers compared with naproxen.

TI  - Treatment of osteoarthritis with celecoxib, a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor: a
      randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 1095-105
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of celecoxib, a cyclooxygenase-2
      (COX-2) inhibitor, with those of naproxen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug 
      (NSAID), and placebo in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee. METHODS: In 
      this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 1003
      patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee were randomly assigned to
      receive celecoxib at doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg twice a day; naproxen, 500 mg
      twice a day; or placebo for 12 weeks. Patients were evaluated with standard
      measures of efficacy 2 to 7 days after discontinuing previous NSAID or analgesic 
      therapy and after 2, 6, and 12 weeks of treatment with the study drug. RESULTS:
      Celecoxib treatment led to significant improvement in the signs and symptoms of
      osteoarthritis as determined by all efficacy measures. Significant pain relief
      occurred within 2 days of the initiation of treatment, and maximum
      anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity, evident within 2 weeks, was sustained
      throughout the 12-week study. All celecoxib doses were efficacious compared with 
      placebo, although the 50-mg twice-daily dosage regimen was minimally effective.
      The higher doses of celecoxib (100 and 200 mg twice a day) were similarly
      efficacious, and the magnitude of improvement observed with these dosing regimens
      was comparable to that seen with naproxen at a dose of 500 mg twice a day. All
      doses of celecoxib and naproxen were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: COX-2 inhibition
      with celecoxib is an effective approach for the treatment of osteoarthritis, as
      seen by clinical improvement in signs and symptoms comparable to treatment with
      naproxen.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the functional status of patients with signs and
      symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee after treatment with celecoxib compared
      with placebo and naproxen. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, double-blind,
      parallel-group, 12-week trial. SETTING: Multicenter study conducted at 71 sites
      in the United States and Canada. PATIENTS: One thousand four patients with active
      osteoarthritis of the knee in a flare state. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were
      assigned randomly to one of five treatment groups: placebo; celecoxib 50 mg
      twice/day, 100 mg twice/day, and 200 mg twice/day; and naproxen 500 mg twice/day.
      MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities
      Osteoarthritis Index was used to measure functional status. At the end of the
      treatment period, patients in the four active treatment groups had significantly 
      better functional status than those receiving placebo. Patients treated with
      celecoxib 100 mg twice/day had significantly better improvements in pain scores
      than those treated with placebo and naproxen. CONCLUSION: Celecoxib was better
      than placebo and comparable with naproxen in improving aspects of functional
      status in patients with osteoarthritis.

TI  - A randomized trial comparing the effect of rofecoxib, a cyclooxygenase 2-specific
      inhibitor, with that of ibuprofen on the gastroduodenal mucosa of patients with
      osteoarthritis. Rofecoxib Osteoarthritis Endoscopy Study Group.
PG  - 776-83
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Prostaglandin production in the normal gastrointestinal tract,
      believed to be critical for mucosal integrity, is mediated by cyclooxygenase
      (COX)-1, whereas prostaglandin production at inflammatory sites seems to occur
      via induction of COX-2. We hypothesized that COX-2-specific inhibition with
      rofecoxib (25 mg once daily) in the treatment of patients with osteoarthritis
      would cause fewer gastroduodenal ulcers than an equally effective dose of
      ibuprofen (800 mg 3 times a day), a nonspecific COX inhibitor. METHODS: A total
      of 742 osteoarthritis patients without ulcers on baseline endoscopy were randomly
      assigned to receive rofecoxib (25 or 50 mg once daily), ibuprofen (800 mg 3 times
      daily), or placebo. Endoscopy was repeated at 6, 12, and 24 weeks. At 16 weeks,
      by study design, 95% of the placebo group and 5% of the other groups were
      discontinued. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers >/=3 mm 
      with rofecoxib (25 or 50 mg once daily) was significantly (P < 0.001) lower than 
      with ibuprofen and was statistically equivalent to placebo at week 12 (placebo,
      9.9%; 25 mg rofecoxib, 4.1%; 50 mg rofecoxib, 7.3%; and ibuprofen, 27.7%). At 24 
      weeks, ulcer rates were 25 mg rofecoxib, 9. 6%; 50 mg rofecoxib, 14.7%; and
      ibuprofen, 45.8% (P < 0.001, ibuprofen vs. 25 and 50 mg rofecoxib). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Rofecoxib, at doses 2-4 times the dose demonstrated to relieve symptoms of
      osteoarthritis, caused significantly less gastroduodenal ulceration than
      ibuprofen, with ulcer rates comparable to placebo.

TI  - Improvement in gastrointestinal tolerability of the selective cyclooxygenase
      (COX)-2 inhibitor, meloxicam, compared with piroxicam: results of the Safety and 
      Efficacy Large-scale Evaluation of COX-inhibiting Therapies (SELECT) trial in
      osteoarthritis.
PG  - 946-51
AB  - SELECT is a large-scale, prospective, international, multicentre, double-blind,
      double-dummy, randomized, parallel-group trial. Patients with exacerbation of
      osteoarthritis were treated with the recommended dose of meloxicam (7.5 mg) or
      piroxicam (20 mg) once daily for 28 days; 4320 patients were administered
      meloxicam and 4336 piroxicam. The incidence of adverse events was significantly
      lower in the meloxicam group (22.5%) compared with the piroxicam group (27.9%; P 
      < 0.001), mainly due to the significantly lower incidence of gastrointestinal
      (GI) adverse events in the meloxicam than in the piroxicam group (10.3% vs
      15.4%,; P < 0.001), while the efficacy of both drugs was equivalent. Individual
      GI events occurred significantly less often with meloxicam than piroxicam:
      dyspepsia (3.4% vs 5.8%; P < 0.001), nausea/vomiting (2.5% vs 3.4%; P < 0.05) and
      abdominal pain (2.1% vs 3.6%; P < 0.001). There were 16 patients with
      perforations, ulcerations or bleeding (PUBs) of the upper GI tract in the
      piroxicam group compared with seven in the meloxicam group (relative risk
      piroxicam:meloxicam = 1.4). Four PUBs were complicated (perforations or
      bleedings); none of these occurred in the meloxicam group (relative risk
      piroxicam:meloxicam = 1.9). The outcome of SELECT is consistent with that of the 
      large-scale clinical trial of similar design and size which compared 7.5 mg
      meloxicam with 100 mg diclofenac in patients with osteoarthritis, and with a
      previous global analysis of the safety of meloxicam. It adds further data to the 
      proposed relationship between selective inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 and
      improved GI tolerability of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

TI  - Gastrointestinal tolerability of meloxicam compared to diclofenac in
      osteoarthritis patients. International MELISSA Study Group. Meloxicam Large-scale
      International Study Safety Assessment.
PG  - 937-45
AB  - Although widely used, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are
      associated with a high incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) side-effects.
      Inhibition of the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme is the basis for both the efficacy 
      and toxicity of NSAIDs. The discovery of two COX isoforms, constitutive COX-1 and
      inducible COX-2, has led to the hypothesis that selective inhibition of COX-2
      will minimize the potential for GI toxicity without compromising efficacy. The
      Meloxicam Large-scale International Study Safety Assessment (MELISSA) trial
      reported here was therefore set up to investigate the tolerability of meloxicam, 
      a preferential inhibitor of COX-2, compared to diclofenac. MELISSA was a
      large-scale, double-blind, randomized, international, prospective trial,
      conducted over 28 days in patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis. Patients
      received either meloxicam 7.5 mg or diclofenac 100 mg slow release, the
      recommended doses for the treatment of osteoarthritis. Evaluation of the profile 
      of adverse events was the main aim of the trial, together with assessment of
      efficacy. A total of 9323 patients received treatment (4635 and 4688 in the
      meloxicam and diclofenac groups, respectively). Significantly fewer adverse
      events were reported by patients receiving meloxicam. This was attributable to
      fewer GI adverse events (13%) compared to diclofenac (19%; P < 0.001). Of the
      most common GI adverse events, there was significantly less dyspepsia (P <
      0.001), nausea and vomiting (P < 0.05), abdominal pain (P < 0.001) and diarrhoea 
      (P < 0.001) with meloxicam compared to diclofenac. Five patients on meloxicam
      experienced a perforation, ulcer or bleed vs seven on diclofenac (not
      significant). No endoscopically verified ulcer complication was detected in the
      meloxicam group compared to four with diclofenac. There were five patient days of
      hospitalization in patients on meloxicam compared to 121 with diclofenac. Adverse
      events caused withdrawal from the study in 254 patients receiving meloxicam
      (5.48%) compared to 373 (7.96%) on diclofenac (P < 0.001). These differences were
      attributable to differences in reported GI adverse events (3.02% on meloxicam vs 
      6.14% on diclofenac; P < 0.001). Differences in efficacy, as assessed by visual
      analogue scales, consistently favoured diclofenac. In all instances, 95%
      confidence intervals did not cross zero, suggesting a statistically significant
      effect. However, differences were small (4.5-9.01% difference) and did not reach 
      pre-determined levels of clinical significance. Nevertheless, significantly more 
      patients discontinued meloxicam because of lack of efficacy (80 out of 4635 vs 49
      out of 4688; P < 0.01). The MELISSA trial confirms earlier studies suggesting
      that meloxicam has a significantly improved GI tolerability profile in comparison
      with other NSAIDs, including diclofenac. These results may in part reflect the
      preferential COX-2 selectivity of meloxicam, although the dose and other aspects 
      of tolerability may be important. These results may provide support for the
      hypothesis that selective inhibition of COX-2 relative to COX-1 might be an
      effective approach towards improved NSAID therapy.

TI  - A double-blind, randomized trial to compare meloxicam 15 mg with diclofenac 100
      mg in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee.
PG  - 283-8
AB  - Meloxicam is a new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), which, in animal 
      tests, displays a high potency for anti-inflammatory and analgesic action. The
      aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of 15 mg
      meloxicam in comparison with 100 mg slow-release diclofenac in patients with
      osteoarthritis of the knee. Two hundred and fifty-eight patients were included in
      the intent-to-treat analysis; these were randomized into two groups to receive
      either 15 mg meloxicam (N = 128) or 100 mg diclofenac (N = 130) for a period of 6
      weeks. The results with respect to efficacy showed a trend in favor of meloxicam 
      regarding pain on movement, global efficacy and paracetamol consumption, although
      these differences did not reach statistical significance. The most
      frequently-occurring adverse events in both groups were of a gastrointestinal
      (GI) nature. However, there was a higher incidence (26 vs 16%) of GI adverse
      events in the diclofenac group compared with the meloxicam group. Both drugs were
      well tolerated when assessed by the patients on a visual analog scale (VAS).
      Thus, 15 mg meloxicam is an effective and well-tolerated therapy for
      osteoarthritis and compares favorably with diclofenac 100 mg, a well-established 
      treatment for this indication.

TI  - Meloxicam in osteoarthritis: a 6-month, double-blind comparison with diclofenac
      sodium.
PG  - 39-43
AB  - A multicentre, double-blind, randomized study was conducted in patients with
      osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip or knee in order to compare the efficacy and
      safety of the new cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, meloxicam, with diclofenac 
      sodium, a conventional treatment for this condition. Three hundred and thirty-six
      patients were treated with oral meloxicam 7.5 mg once daily or diclofenac 100 mg 
      slow release once daily for 6 months. There were no significant differences
      between the treatment groups with respect to overall pain, pain on movement,
      global efficacy or quality of life scores at the end of treatment, all of which
      showed good levels of improvement. Sixty-six patients were withdrawn after the
      start of the double-blind phase due to adverse events (n = 21, meloxicam; n = 31,
      diclofenac) or to lack of efficacy (seven in each group). The median of dose
      paracetamol taken concomitantly was statistically significantly lower in the
      meloxicam group than in the diclofenac group (185 vs 245 mg/day; P = 0.0123) with
      a comparable proportion of patients taking concomitant paracetamol therapy in
      both groups. Both drugs were well tolerated, although severe adverse events,
      treatment withdrawal and clinically significant laboratory abnormalities were
      more common with diclofenac than with meloxicam. Thus, meloxicam 7.5 mg is a safe
      and effective treatment for OA of the hip and knee which demonstrates a trend
      towards an improved safety profile compared with diclofenac.

      piroxicam 20 mg in patients with osteoarthritis of the hip.
PG  - 35-8
AB  - Meloxicam 15 mg once daily (n = 128) was compared with piroxicam 20 mg (n = 127) 
      in this 6 week, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized, multicentre study in
      out-patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip. Assessments of
      pain, global efficacy and global tolerance were made on a 10 cm horizontal visual
      analogue scale; severity of OA was evaluated by Lequesne's index. Efficacy
      results showed significant improvement compared with baseline, with no
      significant difference between meloxicam 15 mg and piroxicam 20 mg. The type and 
      frequency of adverse events were comparable for the two drugs. The most frequent 
      events reported were gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, occurring in 21 and 23% of 
      meloxicam and piroxicam patients respectively. The global tolerance assessment by
      patients at the end of treatment favoured meloxicam. In conclusion, meloxicam at 
      a dose of 15 mg/day is comparable in efficacy and safety to piroxicam 20 mg.

      7.5 mg daily and naproxen 750 mg daily in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
PG  - 22-8
AB  - Meloxicam is a new non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) which
      preferentially inhibits cyclooxygenase-2 over cyclooxygenase-1. A double-blind
      parallel-group trial compared meloxicam 7.5 mg once daily (n = 199) with naproxen
      750 mg (n = 180) in rheumatoid arthritis. There was no significant difference
      between the groups regarding the primary efficacy variables (global efficacy
      assessment by patient and investigator, number of painful/tender and swollen
      joints) and eight of the ten secondary efficacy endpoints. Only the swollen joint
      severity index and the number of discontinuations due to lack of efficacy
      favoured naproxen 750 mg significantly over meloxicam 7.5 mg. Meloxicam was
      better tolerated in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, with fewer GI adverse events
      in the meloxicam-treated group (30.3%) than in the naproxen-treated group
      (44.7%), where two patients developed ulcers. No ulcers were seen in meloxicam
      patients. Significantly more patients discontinued due to GI adverse events in
      the naproxen group. Additionally, there was a significant decrease in haemoglobin
      and a significant increase in serum creatinine and urea in the naproxen group
      compared with the meloxicam group. In conclusion, meloxicam 7.5 mg once daily is 
      a promising treatment in rheumatoid arthritis, with efficacy comparable to
      naproxen 750 mg. Meloxicam has the advantage of a significantly lower incidence
      of GI and renal side effects.

TI  - Misoprostol reduces serious gastrointestinal complications in patients with
      rheumatoid arthritis receiving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. A
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 241-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether concurrent administration of misoprostol
      reduces the occurrence of serious upper gastrointestinal complications, such as
      perforation, gastric outlet obstruction, or bleeding, in patients with rheumatoid
      arthritis who are receiving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
      DESIGN: 6-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: 664 
      clinical practices of family medicine, internal medicine, or rheumatology in the 
      United States and Canada. PATIENTS: 8843 men and women (mean age, 68 years)
      receiving continuous therapy with any of 10 specified NSAIDs for control of
      symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Patients were enrolled between July 1991 and
      August 1993. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned to receive 200
      micrograms of misoprostol or placebo four times a day. MEASUREMENTS: Development 
      of serious upper gastrointestinal complications detected by clinical symptoms or 
      findings (not by scheduled endoscopy). RESULTS: Serious upper gastrointestinal
      complications were reduced by 40% (odds ratio, 0.598 [95% CI, 0.364 to 0.982; P =
      0.049]) among patients receiving misoprostol (25 of 4404 patients) compared with 
      those receiving placebo (42 of 4439 patients). During the first month, more
      patients receiving misoprostol (20%) than placebo (15%) withdrew from the study, 
      primarily because of diarrhea and related problems (P < 0.001). Risk factors for 
      serious upper gastrointestinal complications were increasing age, history of
      peptic ulcer or bleeding, and cardiovascular disease. Patients with all four risk
      factors would have a 9% risk for a major complication in 6 months. CONCLUSIONS:
      In older patients with rheumatoid arthritis, misoprostol reduced serious
      NSAID-induced upper gastrointestinal complications by 40% compared with placebo.
