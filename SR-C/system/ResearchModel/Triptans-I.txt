TI  - Comparative efficacy of eletriptan vs. naratriptan in the acute treatment of
      migraine.
PG  - 869-76
AB  - This was a randomized, double-blind study designed to evaluate the comparative
      efficacy and tolerability of the 40-mg dose of eletriptan and the 2.5-mg dose of 
      naratriptan. Patients (n = 548) meeting International Headache Society (IHS)
      criteria for migraine were randomized to treat a single migraine attack with
      either eletriptan 40 mg, naratriptan 2.5 mg, or placebo. Headache response rates 
      at 2 h and 4 h, respectively, were 56% and 80% for eletriptan, 42% and 67% for
      naratriptan (P < 0.01 for both time-points vs. eletriptan), and 31% and 44% for
      placebo (P < 0.0001 vs. both active drugs at both time-points). Eletriptan also
      showed a significantly greater pain-free response at 2 h (35% vs. 18%; P < 0.001)
      as well as lower use of rescue medication (15% vs. 27%; P < 0.01) and higher
      sustained headache response at 24 h (38%) compared with naratriptan (27%; P <
      0.05) and placebo (19%; P < 0.01). Both eletriptan and naratriptan were well
      tolerated. The results confirm previous meta-analyses that have suggested the
      superiority of eletriptan vs. naratriptan in the acute treatment of migraine.

TI  - A review of the effects of almotriptan and other triptans on clinical trial
      outcomes that are meaningful to patients with migraine.
PG  - 331-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: Traditional end points in clinical trials of migraine therapy, such
      as 2-hour pain response, may not fully address the outcomes patients consider
      most important: rapid and sustained freedom from pain over 24 hours, and a low,
      placebo-like incidence of adverse events. A composite efficacy measure such as
      the sustained pain-free rate (no pain by 2 hours after dosing, no recurrence, no 
      use of rescue medication from 2 to 24 hours after dosing) may be more
      appropriate. OBJECTIVE: Clinically relevant differences between almotriptan and
      other triptans were reviewed in the context of the attributes of acute migraine
      treatment that patients consider most important. METHODS: This review was based
      on published reports of open-label and placebo-controlled clinical trials of
      almotriptan, results of a survey concerning the attributes patients consider most
      important in a migraine medication, and a published meta-analysis of 53
      placebo-controlled clinical trials of triptans involving >24,000 patients.
      RESULTS: Almotriptan was effective and well tolerated in the placebo-controlled
      clinical trials; results of the 6- and 12-month open-label studies supported its 
      good tolerability profile. A respective 87% and 86% of respondents to the patient
      survey indicated that they considered complete freedom from pain and no
      recurrence among the most important attributes of migraine treatment, both of
      which are included in the sustained pain-free rate. In the meta-analysis,
      almotriptan had a favorable efficacy and tolerability profile compared with other
      triptans, particularly with respect to sustained pain-free rate, which was
      significantly higher with almotriptan 12.5 mg compared with sumatriptan 100 mg
      (25.9% vs 20.0%, respectively; P < 0.05). In addition, the placebo-subtracted
      rate of adverse events was significantly lower with almotriptan compared with
      sumatriptan (1.8% vs 4.4%, respectively; P < 0.05). Results of a head-to-head
      placebo-controlled trial of almotriptan 12.5 mg and sumatriptan 100 mg supported 
      the balance of efficacy and tolerability observed for almotriptan in the
      meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Data from clinical trials suggest that almotriptan is
      effective and well tolerated in the treatment of acute migraine pain. Based on a 
      sustained pain-free rate that is among the highest and an adverse-event rate that
      is among the lowest for the triptans, almotriptan represents a therapeutic option
      for the initial treatment of acute migraine with or without aura.

TI  - Sumatriptan in migraine with unilateral cranial autonomic symptoms: an open
      study.
PG  - 400-3
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the response to sumatriptan in migraineurs with
      unilateral cranial autonomic symptoms such as lacrimation, eye redness, eyelid
      edema, nasal congestion, and rhinorrhea. BACKGROUND: Given the potential
      large-scale recruitment of peripheral neurovascular 5-HT1B/1D receptors
      consequent to the activation of the trigeminal autonomic reflex in such patients,
      the presence of unilateral cranial autonomic symptoms may predict a positive
      response to sumatriptan. METHODS: Seventy-two consecutive migraineurs with
      unilateral cranial autonomic symptoms were given sumatriptan 50-mg tablets to
      treat 1 migraine attack and were asked to record their clinical response to the
      drug at different time points. End points were pain-relief and pain-free response
      at 1 and 2 hours. RESULTS: Pain relief was reported by 47 patients (65.3%) at 1
      hour and by 59 (81.9%) at 2 hours. Pain-free response was reported by 22 patients
      (30.6%) at 1 hour and by 44 (61.1%) at 2 hours. Responsiveness to sumatriptan did
      not correlate with the type or number of unilateral cranial autonomic symptoms,
      demographic characteristics, prophylactic treatments, use of contraceptives, or
      concomitant tension-type headache. CONCLUSIONS: Migraineurs with unilateral
      cranial autonomic symptoms seem to respond to sumatriptan better than other
      migraineurs. The presence of unilateral cranial autonomic symptoms may predict a 
      positive response to the triptans.

TI  - Migraine headache recurrence: relationship to clinical, pharmacological, and
      pharmacokinetic properties of triptans.
PG  - 376-88
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Triptan use is associated with headache recurrence,
      and this has been cited as an important reason for patient dissatisfaction with
      the treatment. The mechanism by which recurrence occurs is not clear, and the
      incidence of recurrence varies with the triptan used. In order to explore the
      pharmacological and physiological interaction of triptans and migraine headache
      recurrence further, some specific clinical, pharmacological, and pharmacokinetic 
      factors that might influence migraine recurrence were evaluated in a review of
      the major efficacy data for the drugs in the triptan class. These factors were
      5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptor activities, the pharmacokinetic elimination half-life 
      of each triptan, and the clinical efficacy of each compound, determined by the
      proportion of patients with headache relief and the therapeutic gain over
      placebo. METHODS: Clinical data were derived from 31 triptan, placebo-controlled,
      major efficacy studies used in a previous meta-analysis. The mean recurrence
      rate, mean headache response, and therapeutic gain were calculated using the
      results from the individual clinical studies. Mean headache response and
      therapeutic gain were calculated at the time point used to define recurrence in
      each study. Data for binding affinity and potency were taken from a
      direct-comparison in vitro pharmacology study, and the elimination half-life
      quoted in the data sheet for each triptan was used. Rank correlation with
      recurrence rate was performed for each of the test parameters. RESULTS: Mean
      headache recurrence rates ranged from 17% for frovatriptan 2.5 mg to 40% for
      rizatriptan. Elimination half-life and recurrence were inversely correlated (r = 
      -1.0, P =.0016). There was also a significant inverse correlation between 5-HT1B 
      receptor potency and recurrence (r = -0.68, P =.034), but 5-HT1D receptor potency
      was not correlated with recurrence (r = -0.20, P =.54). In addition, the binding 
      affinities for the 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors were not correlated to headache
      recurrence. Importantly, it also was demonstrated that initial clinical efficacy 
      was not correlated to headache recurrence. The correlation coefficient for
      headache response was 0.18 (P =.53) and for therapeutic gain, -0.11 (P =.71).
      CONCLUSION: The incidence of migraine headache recurrence varies between drugs in
      the triptan class. Migraine recurrence does not appear to be related to initial
      clinical efficacy, but is influenced by the pharmacological and pharmacokinetic
      properties of the individual triptans. The triptans with longer half-lives and
      greater 5-HT1B receptor potency had the lowest rates of headache recurrence.

PG  - 214-22
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To confirm the efficacy advantage of eletriptan 40 mg over sumatriptan
      100 mg. Background.-Eletriptan 80 mg has demonstrated significantly greater
      efficacy when compared to both sumatriptan 50 mg and 100 mg in two studies.
      Eletriptan 40 mg demonstrated significantly greater efficacy than sumatriptan 100
      mg in one previous trial. METHODS: Two thousand one hundred thirteen patients
      with a diagnosis of migraine according to International Headache Society criteria
      were randomized using a double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group design, and
      treated for a single migraine attack with either eletriptan 40 mg, sumatriptan
      100 mg, or placebo. The primary endpoint was 2-hour headache response. Secondary 
      endpoints included headache response rates at 1 hour, pain-free rates, absence of
      associated symptoms, functional response at 1 and 2 hours, and sustained headache
      response. RESULTS: Headache response rates at 2 hours postdose were significantly
      higher for eletriptan 40 mg (67%) than for sumatriptan 100 mg (59%; P <.001) and 
      placebo (26%; P <.0001). Eletriptan 40 mg consistently showed significant (P
      <.01) efficacy over sumatriptan 100 mg across secondary clinical outcomes,
      including 1-hour headache response; 2-hour pain-free response; absence of nausea,
      photophobia, and phonophobia; functional improvement; use of rescue medication;
      treatment acceptability; and sustained headache response (P <.05). Overall,
      treatment-related adverse events were low, nausea being the only adverse event
      with an incidence of 2% or higher (4.9% with eletriptan, 4.2% sumatriptan, 2.8%
      placebo). CONCLUSION: This trial confirmed that eletriptan 40 mg offers superior 
      efficacy in treating migraine pain and associated symptoms and in restoring
      patient functioning when compared with sumatriptan 100 mg.

TI  - Efficacy, safety, and tolerability of oral eletriptan for treatment of acute
      migraine: a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in the 
      United States.
PG  - 202-13
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy, consistency, safety, and tolerability of 
      oral eletriptan in the acute treatment of three migraine attacks. BACKGROUND:
      Eletriptan is a selective 5-HT1B/1D agonist member of a class of agents known to 
      be effective in the acute treatment of migraine. METHODS: Thirteen hundred
      thirty-four patients were randomized to 20 mg, 40 mg, or 80 mg of eletriptan, or 
      placebo and could treat up to three attacks. The primary efficacy endpoint was
      2-hour headache response for the first attack. Secondary endpoints included
      associated symptom relief, and pain-free, sustained pain-free, and consistency of
      response. RESULTS: Eletriptan 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg achieved significantly (P
      <.0001) better headache response rates than placebo at 2 hours (47%, 62%, and
      59%, respectively, versus 22%) and 4 hours (64%, 76%, and 79%, respectively,
      versus 25%). Headache response was observed to be rapid, showing improvement at
      0.5 hour and 1 hour. Two-hour pain-free response rates for eletriptan 20 mg, 40
      mg, and 80 mg were 14%, 27%, and 27%, respectively, compared with 4% for placebo.
      Sustained pain-free response rates were significantly (P <.001) better for
      eletriptan 20 mg (10%), 40 mg (20%), and 80 mg (18%) compared with placebo (3%). 
      Eletriptan had a higher consistency of intrapatient response than placebo in two 
      of three (68% to 82%) and three of three attacks (32% to 60%) versus 16% and 8%, 
      respectively. All eletriptan doses yielded significant functional improvement at 
      2 hours. Adverse events were generally mild or moderate and transient, with
      eletriptan 20 mg having an adverse event profile comparable to placebo.
      CONCLUSIONS: Eletriptan is efficacious, displaying high consistency of response
      over multiple attacks, and is well tolerated for the acute treatment of migraine.

TI  - Tolerability of the triptans: clinical implications.
PG  - 93-107
AB  - The triptans represent a relatively new class of compounds effective in the
      treatment of migraine. The safety and tolerability of these drugs have been
      extensively investigated since the first triptan (sumatriptan) became
      commercially available. A report on a very large population of patients tested
      during clinical trials and in postmarketing studies, confirms that these drugs
      are safe and well tolerated when correctly used. Adverse events are frequently
      reported, but are usually mild and only a few patients discontinue therapy
      because of them. These adverse events include, in particular, the so-called
      'triptan symptoms' (tingling, sensation of warmth, etc.). The exact mechanism of 
      chest symptoms reported by 20% of patients with migraine treated with triptans
      remains unclear, but are exceptionally related to a cardiac mechanism. CNS
      adverse events (i.e. somnolence) are also reported, but it is a matter of debate 
      whether they are related to the pharmacological properties (i.e. lipophilicity)
      of the drug or are symptoms of the disease itself. The potential risk for drug
      overuse must be taken into account when the triptans are given to patients with a
      high frequency of migraine attacks. Clinical interaction of triptans with other
      drugs metabolised in the liver may theoretically influence the incidence of
      adverse events, but there is little evidence to support this assumption. There is
      no evidence of a teratogenic risk of triptans in pregnant women taking these
      drugs.

TI  - Crossover comparison of efficacy and preference for rizatriptan 10 mg versus
      ergotamine/caffeine in migraine.
PG  - 20-9
AB  - Rizatriptan is a selective 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonist with rapid oral
      absorption and early onset of action in the acute treatment of migraine. This
      randomized double- blind crossover outpatient study assessed the preference for 1
      rizatriptan 10 mg tablet to 2 ergotamine 1 mg/caffeine 100 mg tablets in 439
      patients treating a single migraine attack with each therapy. Of patients
      expressing a preference (89.1%), more than twice as many preferred rizatriptan to
      ergotamine/caffeine (69.9 vs. 30.1%, p < or = 0.001). Faster relief of headache
      was the most important reason for preference, cited by 67.3% of patients
      preferring rizatriptan and 54.2% of patients who preferred ergotamine/caffeine.
      The co-primary endpoint of being pain free at 2 h was also in favor of
      rizatriptan. Forty-nine percent of patients were pain free 2 h after rizatriptan,
      compared with 24.3% treated with ergotamine/caffeine (p < or = 0.001),
      rizatriptan being superior within 1 h of treatment. Headache relief at 2 h was
      75.9% for rizatriptan and 47.3% for ergotamine/caffeine (p < or = 0.001), with
      rizatriptan being superior to ergotamine/caffeine within 30 min of dosing. Almost
      36% of patients taking rizatriptan were pain free at 2 h and had no recurrence or
      need for additional medication within 24 h, compared to 20% of patients on
      ergotamine/caffeine (p < or = 0.001). Rizatriptan was also superior to
      ergotamine/caffeine in the proportions of patients with no nausea, vomiting,
      phonophobia or photophobia and for patients with normal function 2 h after drug
      intake (p < or = 0.001). More patients were (completely, very or somewhat)
      satisfied 2 h after treatment with rizatriptan (69.8%) than at 2 h after
      treatment with ergotamine/caffeine (38.6%, p < or = 0.001). Recurrence rates were
      31.4% with rizatriptan and 15.3% with ergotamine/caffeine. Both active treatments
      were well tolerated. The most common adverse events (incidence > or = 5% in one
      group) after rizatriptan and ergotamine/caffeine, respectively, were dizziness
      (6.7 and 5.3%), nausea (4.2 and 8.5%) and somnolence (5.5 and 2.3%).

TI  - Eletriptan vs sumatriptan: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple migraine 
      attack study.
PG  - 1210-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of oral eletriptan, 40 mg and 80 mg, and oral 
      sumatriptan, 50 mg and 100 mg, in the acute treatment of migraine. METHODS:
      Patients with a history of migraine (n = 1,008) were randomly assigned to receive
      placebo, 40 mg of eletriptan, 80 mg of eletriptan, 50 mg of sumatriptan, or 100
      mg of sumatriptan to treat up to three attacks. Early headache response (at 1
      hour) was the primary endpoint, in addition to the standard endpoint, 2-hour
      headache response. RESULTS: Headache response rates were 12% at 1 hour and 31% at
      2 hours for placebo; 24% at 1 hour and 50% at 2 hours for sumatriptan 50 mg; 27% 
      at 1 hour and 53% at 2 hours for sumatriptan 100 mg; 30% at 1 hour and 64% at 2
      hours for eletriptan 40 mg; and 37% at 1 hour and 67% at 2 hours for eletriptan
      80 mg. More patients receiving eletriptan 80 mg achieved a 1-hour headache
      response than did patients receiving sumatriptan 50 mg (p < 0.05). All doses of
      eletriptan were superior to sumatriptan at 2 hours for headache response and
      complete pain relief (p < 0.05). Significantly more patients on eletriptan 80 mg 
      achieved headache response in all attacks than did patients receiving either
      sumatriptan dose. Eletriptan 40 mg was superior to both sumatriptan doses in
      functional improvement (p < 0.005). The superior efficacy of both eletriptan
      doses was associated with higher rates of patient acceptability than sumatriptan 
      50 mg (p < 0.05). Eletriptan and sumatriptan were well tolerated. CONCLUSION:
      Oral eletriptan (40 mg and 80 mg) is effective, safe, and tolerable in the acute 
      treatment of migraine and yields a consistent response.

TI  - Determinants of migraine-specific quality of life.
PG  - 680-5
AB  - This paper reports an analysis of two randomized controlled trials of
      rizatriptan, in which the 24-h Migraine Quality of Life QuestionnaireCopyright
      was used to assess migraine-specific quality of life in patients receiving acute 
      treatment. The objective of the analysis was to determine which clinical effects 
      of a migraine medication, as measured by traditional clinical trial endpoints,
      contribute to a better short-term health-related quality of life. The results
      demonstrate that patients who experience complete pain relief and are able to
      function at their normal ability within 2 h and experience no headache recurrence
      have the highest migraine-specific quality of life scores. Patients who were
      satisfied with medication at 2 h had higher migraine-specific quality of life
      scores than those who were not satisfied. In conclusion, migraine therapy that
      provides rapid, complete, and sustained pain relief, with restoration of
      functional ability, has the most beneficial impact on short-term health-related
      quality of life for migraineurs.

TI  - Restoring migraine sufferers' ability to function normally: a comparison of
      rizatriptan and other triptans in randomized trials.
PG  - 172-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many migraine patients are unable to function normally during a
      migraine attack. Assessments of treatment efficacy have tended to focus on
      migraine symptoms, rather than looking at functional impact. This study compared 
      the efficacy of different oral triptans for restoring normal function in migraine
      sufferers. METHODS: Retrospective subgroup analysis of data from five randomized,
      placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials in which oral rizatriptan was
      directly compared with oral sumatriptan 100 mg (772 attacks), 50 mg (2,227
      attacks), and 25 mg (1,182 attacks), naratriptan 2.5 mg (413 attacks), and
      zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (578 attacks) for the acute treatment of a moderate or severe
      migraine attack. Functional disability was evaluated by patients on a 4-grade
      scale ('normal', 'mild impairment', 'severe impairment', 'requires bedrest') at
      baseline and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3 and 4 h after dosing. This analysis looked at
      the percentage of patients who had normal functional ability at 2 h, the last
      time point before escape medications were allowed, in the subgroup of patients
      who had some level of disability at baseline. RESULTS: Most patients in each
      trial and treatment group had some level of disability at baseline (range =
      94-100%). At 2 h, more patients on rizatriptan 10 mg were able to function
      normally compared with sumatriptan 100 mg (39 vs. 32%, odds ratio = 1.4, p =
      0.021), sumatriptan 50 mg (47 vs. 42%, odds ratio = 1.2, p = 0.033), sumatriptan 
      25 mg (48 vs. 36%, odds ratio = 1.7, p < 0.001), naratriptan 2.5 mg (39 vs. 22%, 
      odds ratio = 2.5, p < 0.001), and zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (45 vs. 36%, odds ratio =
      1.6, p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: In direct head-to-head comparative clinical trials, 
      oral rizatriptan 10 mg enabled more migraine sufferers to function normally at 2 
      h after dosing than oral sumatriptan, naratriptan, and zolmitriptan.

TI  - Almotriptan, a new anti-migraine agent: a review.
PG  - 217-34
AB  - Almotriptan is a new anti-migraine agent with nanomolar affinity for human
      5-HT(1B), 5-HT(1D), and 5-HT(1F) receptors, weak affinity for 5-HT(1A) and
      5-HT(7) receptors and no significant affinity for more than 20 other
      pharmacological receptors. Almotriptan was effective in animal models predictive 
      of anti-migraine activity in humans and had a good safety profile in animal
      studies. From the toxicological point of view, almotriptan has a profile similar 
      to that of other marketed triptans. In animal studies, at levels substantially
      higher than required for therapeutic activity in humans, almotriptan was devoid
      of any oncogenic, genotoxic or teratogenic effects. Almotriptan is well absorbed 
      orally; its absolute bioavailability in humans is 70%. Its peak plasma levels are
      reached at 1 to 3 h after its administration; its elimination half-life is 3 to 4
      h. Almotriptan is metabolized by monoamine oxidase-mediated oxidative deamination
      and cytochrome P450-mediated oxidation as the major metabolic route and by flavin
      monooxygenase as the minor route. No dose adjustment is required for gender or
      age, and only in the case of severe renal impairment the dose should not exceed
      12.5 mg over a 24-h period. There was no significant interaction between a single
      dose of almotriptan and propranolol, fluoxetine or verapamil, at multiple doses. 
      The efficacy of almotriptan in the treatment of acute migraine was demonstrated
      in clinical trials on more than 3000 patients with migraine. At two h after oral 
      administration of almotriptan, 12.5 mg, the percentages of patients showing pain 
      relief and a pain-free score were 64 and 36%, respectively. The effects of
      almotriptan were significantly better than those of placebo. When almotriptan was
      administered in the early phase of migraine, the percentage of pain-free patients
      at 2 h rose to 84%. In a phase III, double-blind and placebo-controlled study,
      the incidence of adverse events with almotriptan was not statistically different 
      from that of placebo. Based on the available data, it appears that almotriptan is
      the triptan of choice when good efficacy and high tolerability are desired.

TI  - Zolmitriptan is effective and well tolerated in Japanese patients with migraine: 
      a dose-response study.
PG  - 376-83
AB  - This phase II study investigated the efficacy, tolerability and dose-response
      relationship of oral zolmitriptan in the treatment of a single migraine attack in
      Japanese patients. A bridging analysis then assessed the validity of
      extrapolating western clinical data to these Japanese patients. In this
      multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients
      received a single dose of placebo or zolmitriptan 1, 2.5 or 5 mg. The primary
      endpoints were 2-h headache response and the tolerability of zolmitriptan. A
      statistically significant dose-response relationship was observed for the 2-h
      headache response (P=0.003). The 2.5 mg group had significantly greater 2-h
      headache response than the placebo group (P=0.032). The adverse event profile was
      similar to that reported in western patients, and no adverse events unique to the
      Japanese population were observed. The bridging analysis report confirmed similar
      efficacy and tolerability of zolmitriptan in Japanese and western populations. In
      the Japanese patients, the estimated response rates were 34.3%, 45.2%, 57.7% and 
      66.2% for placebo, and zolmitriptan 1, 2.5 and 5 mg, respectively, while in the
      western population the corresponding rates were 39.9%, 49.6%, 61.2% and 71.7%.
      Zolmitriptan is effective and well tolerated in the acute treatment of migraine
      in Japanese patients. The optimal dose was 2.5 mg, although the 5 mg dose may
      provide further benefit for some patients. The bridging analysis supports
      extrapolation of data from western to Japanese patients.

      three attacks.
PG  - 23-32
AB  - The efficacy, safety and tolerability of the 5-HT1B/D receptor agonist eletriptan
      (40 mg and 80 mg) in acute treatment of migraine was evaluated in a
      multinational, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled,
      three-attack study treating 1153 patients. In the initial attack, significantly
      more eletriptan patients reported headache relief and complete pain relief at 2 h
      vs. placebo (40 mg 62% and 32%, 80 mg 65% and 34%, placebo 19% and 3%; P <
      0.0001). Headache relief occurred faster after eletriptan, with more patients at 
      both doses reporting relief 30 min (P < 0.01) and 1 h (P < 0.0001) after
      treatment than after placebo. There was a significantly lower recurrence rate
      with eletriptan 80 mg compared with placebo (P < 0.01). Adverse events for all
      treatments were generally mild or moderate and self-limiting. Eletriptan 40 mg
      and eletriptan 80 mg both appear to be effective and well-tolerated acute
      migraine treatments.

TI  - Zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablet is effective in the acute treatment of 
      migraine.
PG  - 101-6
AB  - A new formulation of zolmitriptan has been developed that dissolves on the tongue
      without the need for additional fluid intake. In this double-blind, parallel
      study, 471 patients were randomized to receive the zolmitriptan orally
      disintegrating tablet 2.5 mg (n=231) or matching placebo (n=240) to treat a
      single moderate or severe migraine. Headache relief following zolmitriptan 2.5 mg
      (63%) was significantly greater than with placebo (22%) at 2 h post-dose (primary
      endpoint; P < 0.0001). The zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablet was also
      significantly more effective than placebo for 1-, 2- and 4-h pain-free response
      (8% vs. 3%, P=0.0207, 27% vs. 7%, P < 0.0001, and 37% vs. 11%, P < 0.0001,
      respectively). Of those patients stating a preference, 70% of patients preferred 
      the orally disintegrating tablet to a conventional tablet. Zolmitriptan orally
      disintegrating tablets are an effective and convenient alternative to a
      conventional tablet, allowing migraine attacks to be treated anytime a migraine
      strikes, which can facilitate earlier treatment.

TI  - Zolmitriptan versus sumatriptan for the acute oral treatment of migraine: a
      randomized, double-blind, international study.
PG  - 237-45
AB  - This randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study compared the efficacy and
      tolerability of zolmitriptan (2.5 or 5 mg) and sumatriptan (50 mg) in the acute
      oral treatment of up to six moderate-to-severe migraine attacks. The intention to
      treat (ITT) population comprised of 1522 patients: 500 treated with zolmitriptan 
      2.5 mg (2671 attacks), 514 with zolmitriptan 5 mg (2744 attacks) and 508 with
      sumatriptan 50 mg (2693 attacks). Overall, the 2-h headache response rates in
      these groups were 62.9, 65.7 and 66.6%, respectively. There were no statistically
      significant differences between sumatriptan 50 mg and zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (P =
      0.12) or 5 mg (P = 0.80). Approximately 40% of patients in each group reported a 
      2-h headache response in > or = 80% of attacks. There were no statistically
      significant differences between the groups in the rates of headache response at 1
      h (zolmitriptan 2.5 mg 36.9%, zolmitriptan 5 mg 39.5% and sumatriptan 50 mg
      38.0%) or 4 h (70.3, 72.9 and 72.2%, respectively) or in the rates of meaningful 
      migraine relief at 1, 2 or 4 h or sustained (24-h) pain relief. All treatments
      were well tolerated. In conclusion, zolmitriptan (2.5 or 5 mg) proved similarly
      efficacious compared with sumatriptan (50 mg), both in terms of response rates
      and consistency across attacks.

TI  - Oral rizatriptan versus oral sumatriptan: a direct comparative study in the acute
      treatment of migraine. Rizatriptan 030 Study Group.
PG  - 748-55
AB  - Rizatriptan is a potent, oral, 5-HT1B/1D agonist with more rapid absorption and
      higher bioavailability than oral sumatriptan. It was postulated that this would
      result in more rapid onset of effect. This randomized, double-blind,
      triple-dummy, parallel-groups study compared rizatriptan 5 mg, rizatriptan 10 mg,
      sumatriptan 100 mg, and placebo in 1268 outpatients treating a single migraine
      attack. Headache relief rates after rizatriptan 10 mg were consistently higher
      than sumatriptan at all time points up to 2 hours, with significance at 1 hour
      (37% versus 28%, P = 0.010). All active agents were significantly superior to
      placebo with regard to headache relief and pain freedom at 2 hours (P < or =
      0.001). The primary efficacy endpoint of time to pain relief through 2 hours
      demonstrated that, after adjustment for age imbalance, rizatriptan 10 mg had
      earlier onset than sumatriptan 100 mg (P = 0.032; hazard ratio 1.21). Rizatriptan
      10 mg was also superior to sumatriptan on pain-free response (P = 0.032),
      reduction in functional disability (P = 0.015), and relief of nausea at 2 hours
      (P = 0.010). Significantly fewer drug-related clinical adverse events were
      reported after rizatriptan 10 mg (33%, P = 0.014) compared with sumatriptan 100
      mg (41%). We conclude that rizatriptan 10 mg has a rapid onset of action and
      relieves headache and associated symptoms more effectively than sumatriptan 100
      mg.

PG  - 455-61
AB  - The efficacy and tolerability of rizatriptan (MAXALT) and zolmitriptan (ZOMIG)
      were compared in a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, stratified (on prior
      use of rizatriptan and/or zolmitriptan), placebo-controlled, single attack study 
      in 766 patients. Rizatriptan tended to provide freedom from pain sooner than
      zolmitriptan (hazard ratio 1.26, P = 0.075), acting within 60 min following
      dosing. More patients were pain free at 2 h on rizatriptan than on zolmitriptan
      (43.2% vs. 35.6%, P=0.041), while headache relief at 2 h was similar (70.5% vs.
      66.8%). At 2 h, fewer patients on rizatriptan had symptoms of photophobia (35.6% 
      vs. 43.5%, P = 0.029) and nausea (25.2% vs. 32.5%, P=0.046), and more patients on
      rizatriptan had normal function (45.4% vs. 37.0%, P=0.025) than zolmitriptan.
      Headache recurred in 28% of patients taking rizatriptan, 29% taking zolmitriptan 
      and 26% taking placebo. Both active treatments were effective compared to placebo
      and were well tolerated. The most common side-effects with rizatriptan were
      asthenia/fatigue, somnolence and dizziness, while the most common side-effects
      with zolmitriptan were asthenia/fatigue and dizziness.

TI  - Efficacy of naratriptan tablets in the acute treatment of migraine: a
      dose-ranging study. Naratriptan S2WB2004 Study Group.
PG  - 970-80
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study sought to compare the efficacy of several doses of
      naratriptan tablets with that of sumatriptan tablets and placebo in the acute
      treatment of a single migraine attack. METHODS: This was a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-ranging study. Patients
      received either naratriptan tablets (1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, or 10 mg), sumatriptan
      tablets (100 mg), or placebo. RESULTS: A total of 643 patients took part in the
      study. Two hours after dosing, headache relief was reported by significantly more
      patients treated with any dose of naratriptan (52%-69%) or sumatriptan (60%) than
      with placebo (31%) (P < 0.05). Four hours after dosing, headache relief was
      reported by significantly more patients treated with any dose of naratriptan
      (63%-80%) or sumatriptan (80%) than with placebo (39%) and by significantly more 
      patients treated with sumatriptan 100 mg (80%) than with naratriptan 1 mg (64%), 
      2.5 mg (63%), or 5 mg (65%) (P < 0.05). Twenty-four-hour overall efficacy
      (headache relief maintained through 24 hours postdose with no worsening, no use
      of rescue medication, and no recurrence) was reported by more patients treated
      with any dose of naratriptan (39%-58%) or sumatriptan (44%) than with placebo
      (22%). Headache recurrence was reported in 17% to 32% of naratriptan-treated
      patients, 44% of sumatriptan-treated patients, and 36% of placebo recipients. The
      overall incidence of adverse events was similar in patients treated with
      naratriptan 1 mg (20%), naratriptan 2.5 mg (21%), and placebo (23%). For
      naratriptan 5, 7.5, and 10 mg, the incidence of adverse events was 32%, 37%, and 
      35%, respectively, and for sumatriptan 100 mg it was 26%. CONCLUSIONS: Our
      results suggest that the 2.5-mg dose of naratriptan tablets offers the optimal
      efficacy-to-tolerability ratio at the dose range between 1 and 10 mg. Although
      naratriptan 2.5 mg was less effective than sumatriptan 100 mg at 4 hours after
      dosing, the 2 medications showed similar efficacy at 24 hours.

      trial design.
PG  - 30-8
AB  - In this international, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single
      attack study, 'triptan naive' migraine patients were randomized in an 8:8:1 ratio
      to receive zolmitriptan 5 mg, sumatriptan 100 mg or placebo. The all-treated
      analysis included 1058 patients who took study medication. The primary endpoint, 
      complete headache response, was reported by 39%, 38% and 32% of patients treated 
      with zolmitriptan, sumatriptan and placebo, respectively, with no significant
      difference between treatment groups. In patients with moderate headache at
      baseline, complete response was significantly greater following zolmitriptan than
      after placebo (48% vs. 27%; P=0.01); there was no significant difference between 
      sumatriptan and placebo groups (40% vs. 27%). In patients with severe baseline
      headache (where a greater reduction in headache intensity is required for a
      headache response), there was no significant difference between any groups in
      complete headache response rates. For secondary endpoints, active treatment
      groups were significantly superior to placebo for: 1-, 2- and 4-h headache
      response (e.g. 2-h headache response rates: zolmitriptan 59%; sumatriptan 61%;
      placebo 44%; P < 0.01 vs. placebo); pain-free response rates at 2 and 4 h;
      alleviation of nausea and vomiting; use of escape medication and restoration of
      normal activity. The incidence of adverse events was similar between zolmitriptan
      and sumatriptan groups but was slightly lower in the placebo group. The lack of
      difference between active treatments and placebo for complete response probably
      reflects the high placebo response obtained, which is probably a result of
      deficiencies in trial design. For example, the randomization ratio may result in 
      high expectation of active treatment. Thus, while ethically patient exposure to
      placebo should be minimized, this must be balanced against the scientific
      rationale underpinning study design.

TI  - A comparative trial of zolmitriptan and sumatriptan for the acute oral treatment 
      of migraine.
PG  - 119-28
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This randomized, double-blind, parallel group multicenter study
      compared response rates and tolerability of zolmitriptan with sumatriptan in the 
      acute treatment of migraine. METHODS: A sample consisting of 1445 outpatients
      with an established diagnosis of migraine was randomized to zolmitriptan, 2.5 mg 
      or 5 mg, or sumatriptan, 25 mg or 50 mg. Patients took 1 tablet for
      moderate/severe migraine and a second identical tablet, if necessary, for
      recurrent headache of moderate/severe intensity 4 to 24 hours after the initial
      dose. Up to six attacks were treated during a 6-month period. The primary outcome
      measure was headache response 2 hours after the initial dose. Secondary end
      points included 1-hour and 4-hour headache response and pain relief over 24
      hours. RESULTS: A headache response at 2 hours was noted in 67.1% of patients
      taking zolmitriptan, 2.5 mg, and 64.8% of those taking zolmitriptan, 5 mg, versus
      59.6% of patients taking sumatriptan, 25 mg, and 63.8% of those taking
      sumatriptan, 50 mg. At 2 and 4 hours, the differences between zolmitriptan, 2.5
      mg, and sumatriptan, 25 mg, were statistically significant (odds ratio=1.49 and
      1.67, respectively; both P<.001). Statistically significant differences between
      zolmitriptan, 2.5 mg, and sumatriptan, 50 mg, were seen at 2 and 4 hours post
      dose (odds ratio=1.21 and 1.23, respectively; both P<.05). At 1 hour post dose,
      the headache response rate for zolmitriptan, 2. 5 mg, was numerically higher than
      response rates for sumatriptan, 25 mg and 50mg (odds ratio=1.16, odds ratio=1.06,
      though they failed to reach statistical significance; P=.061, P=.461
      respectively). Differences between zolmitriptan, 5 mg, and sumatriptan, 25 mg,
      were statistically significant at 1, 2, and 4 hours (odds ratio=1.43, 1. 46, and 
      1.78, respectively; all P<.001) and at 1 and 4 hours versus sumatriptan, 50 mg
      (odds ratio=1.28, P=.002; odds ratio=1.29, P=.012, respectively). Although not
      statistically significant at 2 hours, more patients responded to zolmitriptan, 5 
      mg, than to sumatriptan, 50 mg (odds ratio=1.16, P=.064). Patients receiving
      zolmitriptan, 2. 5 mg or 5 mg, achieved more pain relief over 24 hours than
      patients receiving sumatriptan, 25 mg (odds ratio=1.47, and 1.54 respectively,
      both P<.001) or sumatriptan, 50 mg (odds ratio=1.17, P=.021; odds ratio=1.22,
      P=.005, respectively). All treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS:
      Zolmitriptan, 2.5 mg and 5 mg, was at least as effective as sumatriptan, 25 mg or
      50 mg, for all parameters studied. Zolmitriptan, 2.5 mg, was significantly more
      effective than sumatriptan, 50 mg, in terms of headache response at 2 and 4
      hours. Patients taking zolmitriptan were significantly more likely to have pain
      relief over 24 hours than those taking sumatriptan.

TI  - Eletriptan in acute migraine: a double-blind, placebo-controlled comparison to
      sumatriptan. Eletriptan Steering Committee.
PG  - 156-63
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of oral eletriptan
      (20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg) with that of oral sumatriptan (100 mg) and placebo for 
      the acute treatment of migraine. BACKGROUND: Eletriptan is a potent and selective
      agonist at human recombinant 5HT1B/1D receptors, with efficacy in animal models
      that predict antimigraine activity. In healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetics
      of eletriptan are characterized by linear and rapid oral absorption. METHODS:
      Randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study conducted in 857 outpatients with 
      a diagnosis of migraine according to the International Headache Society (IHS)
      criteria. Of these, 692 took study medication for one acute migraine attack and
      provided on-drug efficacy data. Subjects received either placebo, 100 mg of
      sumatriptan or 20 mg, 40 mg, or 80 mg of eletriptan for the treatment of an acute
      migraine attack. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with a
      headache response (improvement in pain intensity from moderate or severe to mild 
      or none) at 2 hours after treatment. RESULTS: At the primary endpoint (2 hours
      after dosing), headache response rates were 24% (30/126) for placebo; 55%
      (63/115) for sumatriptan, 100 mg; 54% (70/129) for eletriptan, 20 mg; 65%
      (76/117) for eletriptan, 40 mg; and 77% (91/118) for eletriptan, 80 mg. There was
      a difference compared with placebo (p<0.001) for all doses of eletriptan, and at 
      2 hours there was a difference between sumatriptan, 100 mg, and eletriptan, 80 mg
      (p<0.001). Headache-free rates at 2 hours were superior to placebo (6%; p<0.001) 
      for both the 80-mg dose of eletriptan (37%) and the 40-mg dose (29%), with the
      80-mg dose also being superior to 100 mg of sumatriptan (23%; p<0.05). Eletriptan
      and sumatriptan were well tolerated, and the majority of adverse events were mild
      or moderate in intensity and transient. CONCLUSION: In this placebo-controlled
      trial, eletriptan, at selected doses, demonstrated superior efficacy, onset of
      action and patient acceptability in the acute treatment of migraine when compared
      with oral sumatriptan and placebo.

TI  - Comparison of rizatriptan 10 mg vs. naratriptan 2.5 mg in migraine.
PG  - 173-9
AB  - Rizatriptan (MAXALT(TM), Merck & Co., Inc.) is a selective 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor
      agonist with rapid oral absorption and early onset of action for the acute
      treatment of migraine. This randomized, double-masked, double-dummy,
      placebo-controlled study compared rizatriptan 10 mg to naratriptan (NARAMIG(TM), 
      AMERGE(TM), both Glaxo Wellcome plc) 2.5 mg in 522 patients treating a single
      migraine attack. Rizatriptan was more effective than naratriptan. Rizatriptan
      provided earlier headache relief than naratriptan (hazard ratio 1.62, p < 0.001),
      acting as early as 30 min. More patients were pain free at 2 h on rizatriptan
      than on naratriptan (44.8 vs. 20.7%, p < 0.001). Rizatriptan also provided
      earlier relief of associated migraine symptoms within 2 h than naratriptan and
      more patients had normal function at 2 h (39.3 vs. 22.6%, p < 0. 001). Both
      active treatments were effective compared to placebo. Both active treatments were
      well tolerated. The most common side effects with rizatriptan were dizziness,
      asthenia/fatigue, nausea and somnolence, while the most common side effects with 
      naratriptan were dizziness and asthenia/fatigue.

TI  - Emergency management of migraine: is the headache really over?
PG  - 899-905
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To observe headache frequency after release for acute migraine
      sufferers treated in an ED; to observe the impact after-release headaches and
      associated symptoms have on quality of life; and to document the variability in
      migraine management in an emergency setting. METHODS: Prospective observational
      study, including 24- and 72-hour telephone follow-up. RESULTS: Over a 4-month
      period, 143 patients with headaches (149 visits) were observed in the ED. Of 108 
      patients successfully contacted, the incidence of headache in the first 24 hours 
      after release was 49.1%. Forty-two patients left the ED without pain; 13 of these
      subsequently had return of headache. Sixty-six left with some degree of pain,
      with 40 having headache persistence at 24 hours. The difference in 24-hour
      headache rate between the 2 groups is significant (p=0.008). Five patients still 
      had headaches at 72 hours after release, but 54 of 70 contacted had taken
      medication for their symptoms between 24 and 72 hours after release. Forty-five
      percent were not back to normal function at 24 hours, while 21 of 70 were still
      not sleeping well at 72 hours. Finally, 8 different classes of medications were
      used in the ED for migraine headaches, with 20 patients receiving at least 3
      types of medication. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment for acute migraine headache in this
      emergency setting was variable. Patients not obtaining complete relief in the ED 
      had a higher rate of headache after release than did those who left with no pain.
      Migraine sufferers may have normal daily function affected for up to 72 hours or 
      longer after ED treatment.
