TI  - Comparative efficacy of two once daily methylphenidate formulations (Ritalin LA
      and Concerta) and placebo in children with attention deficit hyperactivity
      disorder across the school day.
PG  - 545-55
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to compare the differences in clinical
      efficacy of the starting dose of Ritalin LA (20mg) to the starting dose of
      Concerta (18mg), in a laboratory school setting for the duration of an entire
      school day. Secondary objectives were to compare Ritalin LA 20mg with Concerta
      36mg, and Ritalin LA and both Concerta doses versus placebo across the school
      day. METHODS: Thirty-six children (29 males, 7 females), aged 6-12 years, with
      attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, previously stabilized on
      methylphenidate (MPH), completed this four-way, randomized, single-blind
      crossover, analog classroom study. Patients were evaluated on day 0 and
      randomized to receive treatment on days 7, 14, 21, and 28 (Ritalin LA 20mg,
      Concerta 18mg, Concerta 36mg, or placebo). RESULTS: Swanson, Kotkin, Agler,
      M-Flynn and Pelham Rating Scale (SKAMP)-attention: The effect of Ritalin LA 20mg 
      across the morning was statistically different from that of Concerta 18mg and
      36mg, as demonstrated by the change in the area under the curve (AUC) during the 
      first 4 hours (0-4) from pre-dose. AUC((0-4)) for RitalinLA was -2.48 versus
      -1.36 for Concerta 18mg (p = 0.015), and -1.55 for Concerta 36mg (p = 0.043).
      AUC((0-8)) change from pre-dose for Ritalin LA was -4.48 versus -2.72 for
      Concerta 18mg (p = 0.074), and -3.24 for Concerta 36mg (p =
      0.208).SKAMP-deportment: AUC((0-4)) for Ritalin LA was -1.67 compared with -0.28 
      for Concerta 18mg (p < 0.001), and -0.55 for Concerta 36mg (p = 0.004).
      AUC((0-8)) change from pre-dose for Ritalin LA was -2.81 compared with -0.82 for 
      Concerta 18mg (p = 0.018), and -1.34 for Concerta 36mg (p = 0.078).Combined: Mean
      AUC((0-4)) change from pre-dose for Ritalin LA was -2.05 compared with -0.78 for 
      Concerta 18mg (p < 0.001), -1.01 for Concerta 36mg (p = 0.003). The mean
      AUC((0-8)) change from pre-dose for Ritalin LA was -3.58 compared with -1.70 for 
      Concerta 18mg (p = 0.010), -2.22 for Concerta 36mg (p = 0.061). Math
      test-attempted: Mean pre-dose score for Ritalin LA was about 73 compared with 74,
      90, and 81 for Concerta 18mg, 36mg, and placebo, respectively. Mean AUC((0-8))
      change from pre-dose for Ritalin LA was 202 compared with 115 for Concerta 18mg
      (p = 0.135), 137 for Concerta 36mg (p = 0.265). Math test-correct: Mean pre-dose 
      score for Ritalin LA was 68 compared with 64, 78, and 76 for Concerta 18mg, 36mg,
      and placebo, respectively. Mean AUC((0-8)) change from pre-dose for Ritalin LA
      was 183 compared with 100 for Concerta 18mg (p = 0.144), and 117 for Concerta
      36mg (p = 0.245).Safety: One patient from each treatment group experienced a
      single mild adverse event that included abdominal pain, nausea, and dyspnea.
      CONCLUSION: While both Ritalin LA and Concerta were shown to be effective, the
      different release profiles of each formulation can result in distinct differences
      between the effects on measures of attention and deportment.

TI  - Cardiovascular effects of atomoxetine in children, adolescents, and adults.
PG  - 729-40
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atomoxetine is a highly specific presynaptic inhibitor of the
      noradrenaline (norepinephrine) transporter that was recently approved in the US
      for the treatment of patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
      (ADHD). Adverse effects on the cardiovascular system, including abnormalities in 
      heart rate, blood pressure, or cardiac rhythm have been associated with several
      noradrenergic medications. OBJECTIVE: To further elucidate the magnitude and
      impact of blood pressure and pulse elevations in patients taking atomoxetine.
      STUDY DESIGN: Short-term cardiovascular safety in children, adolescents, and
      adults with ADHD was assessed in five randomised, double-blind trials (duration
      up to 10 weeks) with atomoxetine (n = 612) or placebo (n = 474). Long-term
      cardiovascular safety in children and adolescents (n = 169) was assessed in
      patients who entered an open-label extension or a blinded continuation following 
      short-term treatment. METHODS: Adverse events, blood pressure, sitting pulse, and
      electrocardiograms (ECGs) were collected throughout the trials. QT intervals were
      corrected for heart rate by a data-specific correction factor (QTcD; derived from
      baseline ECGs) as well as standard methods. RESULTS: Atomoxetine treatment was
      associated with small but statistically significant increases in mean systolic
      blood pressure in adults and diastolic blood pressure in children and
      adolescents. Mean pulse rate increased for all atomoxetine treatment groups. The 
      increases in blood pressure and pulse tended to occur early in therapy,
      stabilised, and returned toward baseline upon drug discontinuation. There was no 
      significant difference between atomoxetine and placebo treatment groups in change
      in QTcD interval for all study populations. Palpitations in the adult patient
      population were the only significant cardiovascular adverse event (p = 0.037)
      occurring more frequently in the atomoxetine treatment group (3.7%) than in the
      placebo group (0.8%). Discontinuations due to cardiovascular-related events were 
      very uncommon in the adult group, and did not occur in the child/adolescent
      group. CONCLUSION: While atomoxetine has noradrenergic activity, increases in
      pulse and blood pressure were small and of little, if any, clinical significance.
      Atomoxetine was not associated with QT interval prolongation. Cardiovascular
      effects of atomoxetine were minimal, and atomoxetine was well tolerated in short-
      and long-term studies.

TI  - Childhood behavior disorders and injuries among children and youth: a
      population-based study.
PG  - 262-9
AB  - CONTEXT: While an association between pediatric behavioral disorders and injuries
      is generally acknowledged, no studies have measured the risk for injury in the
      context of a large, population-based study that is free of cohort biases.
      OBJECTIVES: To examine the association between childhood behavior disorders
      ([CBDs] as indicated by prescription for methylphenidate [MPH]) and a variety of 
      injury outcomes, and to evaluate the risk for injury among these children after
      controlling for known demographic correlates. DESIGN: Population-based database
      analysis of all children in British Columbia (BC) under the age of 19 as of
      December 31, 1996; comparison of those who had been prescribed MPH and therefore 
      placed in the CBD group (n = 16, 806) and those who were not (n = 1,010,067).
      Demographic information collected was as follows: age, sex, measures of
      socioeconomic status, and region of residence. OUTCOME MEASURES: Common types of 
      childhood injury in BC: International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision 
      N-codes (fractures, open wounds, poisoning/toxic effect, concussion,
      intracranial, burns) and E-codes (falls, postoperative complications, motor
      vehicle accidents, struck by object, adverse effects of drugs, suffocation,
      drowning). DATA SOURCE: BC Linked Health Data Set and the BC Triplicate
      Prescription Program. RESULTS: After controlling for known demographic
      correlates, odds for injury was greater among those treated with MPH and presumed
      to have a behavioral disorder, when injury was characterized either by type
      (1.67; 99% confidence interval: 1.54-1.81) or cause (1.52; 99% confidence
      interval: 1.40-1.66) of injury. This increased risk extended to unexpected
      categories of injury such as postoperative complications and adverse effects of
      drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Children with CBDs have >1.5 times the odds of sustaining
      injuries of a variety of types from a variety of causes, even after controlling
      for known demographic correlates, than those without behavioral disorders. The
      risks for these children extend beyond those that might be directly associated
      with impulsivity and overactivity. Injury prevention strategies aimed at this
      group of children and youth would be beneficial. Policy-makers should account for
      increased risk of a wide variety of injuries in this group of children and youth.

TI  - Atomoxetine in adults with ADHD: two randomized, placebo-controlled studies.
PG  - 112-20
AB  - BACKGROUND: [corrected] Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been 
      less studied in adults than in children, and the treatment studies reported to
      date have been small, single-center trials. To assess the efficacy of
      atomoxetine, a new and highly selective inhibitor of the norepinephrine
      transporter, we conducted two large, multicenter treatment trials. METHODS: Two
      identical studies using randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled designs and 
      a 10-week treatment period were conducted in adults with DSM-IV-defined ADHD as
      assessed by clinical history and confirmed by a structured interview (study I, n 
      = 280; study II, n = 256). The primary outcome measure was a comparison of
      atomoxetine and placebo using repeated measures mixed model analysis of
      postbaseline values of the Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale. RESULTS: In each
      study, atomoxetine was statistically superior to placebo in reducing both
      inattentive and hyperactive and impulsive symptoms as assessed by primary and
      secondary measures. Discontinuations for adverse events among atomoxetine
      patients were under 10% in both studies. CONCLUSION: Atomoxetine appears to be an
      efficacious treatment for adult ADHD. Its lack of abuse potential may be an
      advantage for many patients.

TI  - Results from 2 proof-of-concept, placebo-controlled studies of atomoxetine in
      children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - 1140-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atomoxetine is a nonstimulant drug being studied for the treatment of
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Atomoxetine is a highly specific
      inhibitor of the presynaptic norepinephrine transporter with minimal affinity for
      other noradrenergic receptors or other neurotransmitter transporters or
      receptors. Results of 2 proof-of-concept studies are reported that tested the
      hypothesis that a selective inhibitor of presynaptic norepinephrine uptake would 
      be effective for the treatment of ADHD in school-aged children. METHOD: Two
      identical 12-week, stratified, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      trials were conducted in children who met DSM-IV criteria for ADHD. The primary
      efficacy outcome measure was the mean change from baseline to endpoint in the
      Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale (ADHD RS) total score.
      Secondary efficacy measures included the Clinical Global
      Impressions-ADHD-Severity (CGI-ADHD-S) and the Conners' Parent Rating
      Scale-Revised: Short Form (CPRS-R:S). RESULTS: A total of 291 patients were
      randomized in the 2 trials combined (Study 1, N = 147; Study 2, N = 144).
      Stimulant-naive patients were randomized to atomoxetine, placebo, or
      methylphenidate. Patients with prior stimulant exposure were randomized to
      atomoxetine or placebo. Atomoxetine significantly reduced ADHD RS total scores
      compared with placebo in each study (p <.001). Changes in the CGI-ADHD-S (Study
      1: p =.003; Study 2: p =.001) and CPRS-ADHD Index (Study 1: p =.023; Study 2: p
      <.001) also showed atomoxetine to be statistically significantly superior to
      placebo in reducing ADHD symptoms. Atomoxetine was found to be well tolerated in 
      this population of pediatric patients. CONCLUSION: Two studies of atomoxetine
      early in its development confirmed that atomoxetine, a specific and selective
      inhibitor of noradrenergic uptake, was effective for the treatment of children
      with ADHD. In addition, atomoxetine was found to be well tolerated.

TI  - Once-daily atomoxetine treatment for children and adolescents with attention
      deficit hyperactivity disorder: a randomized, placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 1896-901
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors assessed the efficacy of once-daily atomoxetine
      administration in the treatment of children and adolescents with attention
      deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). METHOD: In a double-blind study, children 
      and adolescents with ADHD (N=171, age range=6-16 years) were randomly assigned to
      receive 6 weeks of treatment with either atomoxetine (administered once daily) or
      placebo. RESULTS: Outcomes among atomoxetine-treated patients were superior to
      those of the placebo treatment group as assessed by investigator, parent, and
      teacher ratings. The treatment effect size (0.71) was similar to those observed
      in previous atomoxetine studies that used twice-daily dosing. Parent diary
      ratings suggested that drug-specific effects were sustained late in the day.
      Discontinuations due to adverse events were low (less than 3%) for both treatment
      groups, and no serious safety concerns were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Once-daily
      administration of atomoxetine is an effective treatment for children and
      adolescents with ADHD.

TI  - An experimental comparison of Pycnogenol and methylphenidate in adults with
      Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).
PG  - 49-60
AB  - Twenty-four adults (24 to 53 years old) with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity
      Disorder (ADHD), Combined Type, were studied in a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, crossover study of Pycnogenol and methylphenidate. Pycnogenol
      is an antioxidant derived from the bark of the French maritime pine tree.
      Methylphenidate is a standard pharmaceutical intervention for ADHD. Anecdotal
      reports suggest that Pycnogenol improves concentration in adults with ADHD
      without adverse side effects. Participants received Pycnogenol, methylphenidate, 
      and placebo, each for three weeks, in a randomized and counterbalanced order.
      Although ADHD symptoms improved during treatment, neither methylphenidate nor
      Pycnogenol outperformed the placebo control, as measured by self-report rating
      scales, rating scales completed by the individual's significant other, and a
      computerized continuous performance test. The conservative dosage levels and
      relatively brief length of treatment may have contributed to the absence of
      significant differences among treatment conditions. Implications for future
      research are noted.

TI  - Efficacy of Adderall and methylphenidate in attention deficit hyperactivity
      disorder: a drug-placebo and drug-drug response curve analysis of a naturalistic 
      study.
PG  - 121-9
AB  - Stimulant medication has, for many years, been the pharmacological treatment of
      choice for children and adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
      (ADHD). Recently, several studies have documented the efficacy of a new
      stimulant, Adderall. Although these initial studies provide useful information
      for clinicians treating ADHD children, their method of data presentation has
      provided limited information about the clinical significance of drug effects.
      Thus, to address the issue of clinical significance, we completed drug-placebo
      response curve analyses of a blinded, placebo-controlled study of Adderall and
      methylphenidate (MPH). Our results show that the efficacy of Adderall and MPH to 
      improve functioning is seen throughout the full range of improvement scores. Both
      drugs prevent worsening and, for a majority of patients, lead to improvements
      that are well into the normal range. The analyses also highlight an important
      subgroup of placebo responders, which suggests that future research should focus 
      on how to predict robust placebo response in ADHD patients.

TI  - Treatment of ADHD in children with tics: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 527-36
AB  - BACKGROUND: The treatment of children with attention deficit hyperactivity
      disorder (ADHD) and Tourette syndrome (TS) has been problematic because
      methylphenidate (MPH)--the most commonly used drug to treat ADHD--has been
      reported to worsen tics and because clonidine (CLON)--the most commonly
      prescribed alternative--has unproven efficacy. METHODS: The authors conducted a
      multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical trial in which 136 children with
      ADHD and a chronic tic disorder were randomly administered CLON alone, MPH alone,
      combined CLON + MPH, or placebo (2 x 2 factorial design). Each subject
      participated for 16 weeks (weeks 1-4 CLON/placebo dose titration, weeks 5-8 added
      MPH/placebo dose titration, weeks 9-16 maintenance therapy). RESULTS:
      Thirty-seven children were administered MPH alone, 34 were administered CLON
      alone, 33 were administered CLON + MPH, and 32 were administered placebo. For our
      primary outcome measure of ADHD (Conners Abbreviated Symptom
      Questionnaire--Teacher), significant improvement occurred for subjects assigned
      to CLON (p < 0.002) and those assigned to MPH (p < 0.003). Compared with placebo,
      the greatest benefit occurred with combined CLON + MPH (p < 0.0001). CLON
      appeared to be most helpful for impulsivity and hyperactivity; MPH appeared to be
      most helpful for inattention. The proportion of individual subjects reporting a
      worsening of tics as an adverse effect was no higher in those treated with MPH
      (20%) than those being administered CLON alone (26%) or placebo (22%). Compared
      with placebo, measured tic severity lessened in all active treatment groups in
      the following order: CLON + MPH, CLON alone, MPH alone. Sedation was common with 
      CLON treatment (28% reported moderate or severe sedation), but otherwise the
      drugs were tolerated well, including absence of any evident cardiac toxicity.
      CONCLUSIONS: Methylphenidate and clonidine (particularly in combination) are
      effective for ADHD in children with comorbid tics. Prior recommendations to avoid
      methylphenidate in these children because of concerns of worsening tics are
      unsupported by this trial.

TI  - Bupropion SR vs. methylphenidate vs. placebo for attention deficit hyperactivity 
      disorder in adults.
PG  - 129-34
AB  - Despite the increasing recognition of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder
      (ADHD) in adults, there are few controlled trials demonstrating the effectiveness
      of pharmacological treatments, particularly with nonstimulants. One controlled
      trial found bupropion SR more effective than placebo in the treatment of ADHD
      adults. We conducted a controlled study to contrast the effectiveness of
      bupropion SR and methylphenidate to placebo in ADHD adults. A randomized,
      double-blind, parallel design was used in this study. Following a 7-day placebo
      lead-in, 30 ADHD (DSM-IV) subjects (18-60 years old) were randomized to
      bupropion, methylphenidate, or placebo for 7 weeks. Methylphenidate was titrated 
      over 1 week to a maximum dose of 0.9 mg/kg/d divided into 3 doses while bupropion
      was titrated over 2 weeks to a maximum dose of 200 mg A.M. and 100 mg P.M.
      Response rates based on Clinical Global Impression improvement ratings in
      patients receiving bupropion, methylphenidate, and placebo were 64, 50, and 27%, 
      respectively. The difference in response rates between active treatment and
      placebo was not statistically significant (p = 0.14). Neuropsychological testing 
      demonstrated trends favoring drug treatment on measures of immediate recall and
      verbal fluency. While bupropion SR may be a viable clinical alternative for
      adults with ADHD, further investigation is needed.

TI  - Efficacy of a mixed amphetamine salts compound in adults with
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - 775-82
AB  - BACKGROUND: We report on a controlled trial of a mixed amphetamine salts compound
      (Adderall, dextroamphetamine sulfate, dextro-, levoamphetamine sulfate,
      dextroamphetamine aspartate, levoamphetamine aspartate, and dextroamphetamine
      saccharate) in the treatment of adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
      (ADHD). METHODS: This was a 7-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      crossover study of Adderall in 27 well-characterized adults satisfying full
      DSM-IV criteria for ADHD of childhood onset and persistent symptoms into
      adulthood. Medication was titrated up to 30 mg twice a day. Outcome measures
      included the ADHD Rating Scale and the Clinical Global Impression Score. Comorbid
      psychiatric disorders were assessed to test for potential effects on treatment
      outcome. RESULTS: Treatment with Adderall at an average oral dose of 54 mg
      (administered in 2 daily doses) was effective and well tolerated. Drug-specific
      improvement in ADHD symptoms was highly significant overall (42% decrease on the 
      ADHD Rating Scale, P<.001), and sufficiently robust to be detectable in a
      parallel groups comparison restricted to the first 3 weeks of the protocol
      (P<.001). The percentage of subjects who improved (reduction in the ADHD rating
      scale of > or =30%) was significantly higher with Adderall treatment than with a 
      placebo (70% vs 7%; P =.001). CONCLUSIONS: Adderall was effective and well
      tolerated in the short-term treatment of adults with ADHD. More work is needed to
      evaluate the long-term effects of Adderall, or other amphetamine compounds, in
      the treatment of adults with ADHD.

TI  - Adult ADHD. Controlled medication assessment.
PG  - 287-96
AB  - Many adults with ADHD respond to stimulant therapy, but controlled medication
      assessments have not been reported. We administered an effortful working memory
      task in four half-day sessions, double blind, at methylphenidate levels of 0, 5, 
      10 and 20 mg. Dose-response curves were established individually. Fifteen of 17
      patients displayed a favorable response to one or more levels of medication; that
      is, they achieved more correct responses and less variability than on placebo.
      Each dose level elicited optimal performance from some of the patients. Unlike
      monitoring by self-report, the objective medication assessment offers an
      expeditious approximation to the ultimate optimal dose, potentially saving the
      patient weeks on an ineffective and/or excessive dosage regime.

TI  - A placebo-controlled study of guanfacine in the treatment of children with tic
      disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - 1067-74
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of guanfacine in treating
      children with tic disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). 
      METHOD: Subjects from a specialty tic disorders clinic were randomly assigned to 
      receive 8 weeks of treatment with guanfacine or placebo under double-blind
      conditions. Follow-up visits occurred every 2 weeks for safety monitoring and
      dose adjustment. RESULTS: Thirty-four medication-free subjects (31 boys and three
      girls with a mean age of 10.4 years) with ADHD, combined type, and a tic disorder
      participated. After 8 weeks of treatment, guanfacine was associated with a mean
      improvement of 37% in the total score on the teacher-rated ADHD Rating Scale,
      compared to 8% improvement for placebo. Nine of 17 subjects who received
      guanfacine were blindly rated on the Clinical Global Improvement scale as either 
      much improved or very much improved, compared with none of 17 subjects who
      received placebo. The mean score on the parent-rated hyperactivity index improved
      by 27% in the guanfacine group and 21% in the placebo group, not a significant
      difference. On the Continuous Performance Test, commission errors decreased by
      22% and omission errors by 17% in the guanfacine group, compared with increases
      of 29% in commission errors and of 31% in omission errors in the placebo group.
      Tic severity decreased by 31% in the guanfacine group, compared to 0% in the
      placebo group. One guanfacine subject with sedation withdrew at week 4.
      Guanfacine was associated with insignificant decreases in blood pressure and
      pulse. CONCLUSIONS: Guanfacine appears to be a safe and effective treatment for
      children with tic disorders and ADHD.

TI  - Comparing guanfacine and dextroamphetamine for the treatment of adult
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - 223-8
AB  - The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of the alpha-2a agonist
      guanfacine with that of dextroamphetamine for the treatment of adult
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Seventeen adult outpatients who 
      met DSM-IV criteria for ADHD participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
      crossover study comparing drug effects on ADHD symptoms. Measures of change
      included the DSM-IV ADHD Behavior Checklist for Adults and the Copeland Symptom
      Checklist for Adult Attention Deficit Disorders. Cognitive measures of attention 
      included the Stroop and Controlled Oral Word Association Test using the letters
      "C," "F," and "L" (COWAT, CFL version). For each trial, the drug was administered
      daily and titered up to optimal doses of maximum efficacy but with a minimum of
      side effects, and then data were collected. Both drugs significantly reduced ADHD
      symptoms on the DSM-IV Adult Behavior Checklist for Adults over placebo (p <
      0.05). The Stroop Color subscale showed significant improvement for both drugs (p
      < 0.05), but the Color-Word measures showed significant improvement for
      guanfacine only (p < 0.01). The average dose of guanfacine was 1.10 (SD = 0.60), 
      and the most common side effect of guanfacine was fatigue. No subjects
      discontinued drug trials. This preliminary study indicates that guanfacine may be
      a well-tolerated treatment option for adult ADHD.

TI  - A controlled clinical trial of bupropion for attention deficit hyperactivity
      disorder in adults.
PG  - 282-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Despite the increasing recognition of attention deficit hyperactivity 
      disorder (ADHD) in adults, there is a paucity of controlled pharmacological
      trials demonstrating the effectiveness of compounds used in treatment,
      particularly nonstimulants. The authors report results from a controlled
      investigation to determine the anti-ADHD efficacy of bupropion in adult patients 
      with DSM-IV ADHD. METHOD: This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      randomized, parallel, 6-week trial comparing patients receiving sustained-release
      bupropion (up to 200 mg b.i.d.) (N=21) to patients receiving placebo (N=19). The 
      authors used standardized structured psychiatric instruments for diagnosis of
      ADHD. To measure improvement, they used separate assessments of ADHD, depression,
      and anxiety symptoms at baseline and each weekly visit. RESULTS: Of the 40
      subjects (55% male) enrolled in the study, 38 completed the study. Bupropion
      treatment was associated with a significant change in ADHD symptoms at the week-6
      endpoint (42% reduction), which exceeded the effects of placebo (24% reduction). 
      In analyses using a cutoff of 30% or better reduction to denote response, 76% of 
      the subjects receiving bupropion improved, compared to 37% of the subjects
      receiving placebo. Similarly, in analyses using Clinical Global Impression scale 
      scores, 52% of the subjects receiving bupropion reported being "much improved" to
      "very improved," compared to 11% of the subjects receiving placebo. CONCLUSIONS: 
      These results indicate a clinically and statistically significant effect of
      bupropion in improving ADHD in adults. The results suggest a therapeutic role for
      bupropion in the armamentarium of agents for ADHD in adults, while further
      validating the continuity of pharmacological responsivity of ADHD across the
      lifespan.

TI  - Controlled trial of high doses of pemoline for adults with
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - 257-64
AB  - Despite the increasing awareness of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
      (ADHD) in adults, there are a limited number of controlled pharmacologic studies 
      of this disorder. Because the stimulant medication magnesium pemoline (Cylert,
      Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) has been found effective in treating ADHD
      in pediatric groups, we tested its efficacy in adults with ADHD using higher
      daily doses than those previously studied. We conducted a 10-week, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled, crossover design study of pemoline at a target daily dose of 
      3 mg/kg per day in 35 adult patients with DSM-III-R and -IV ADHD. We used
      standardized structured psychiatric instruments for diagnosis. To measure
      improvement, we used separate assessments of ADHD, depressive, and anxiety
      symptoms at baseline and at each biweekly visit. ADHD outcome was determined
      using the ADHD symptom checklist and Clinical Global Impression scales of
      Severity and Improvement. Of the 35 adults with ADHD who were randomized in the
      trial, 27 (77%) completed the protocol. Treatment with pemoline in the final week
      of the 4-week active phase was best tolerated at doses substantially lower than
      the target dose of 3 mg/kg per day (mean dose, 2.2 mg/kg per day; mean+/-SD,
      148+/-95 mg). Pemoline was significantly better at reducing ADHD symptoms
      compared with placebo (z = 2.4,p < 0.02). Using a predefined 30% reduction in
      symptoms as an indication of improvement, 50% of pemoline-treated subjects and
      17% of subjects in the placebo group were considered positive responders (chi2 = 
      7.1, p = 0.008). These results indicate that pemoline is moderately effective in 
      the treatment of ADHD in adults. Although robust doses were targeted, most adults
      preferred more moderate dosing (120-160 mg/day). Given the limited efficacy,
      tolerability, and concerns of hepatic dysfunction, pemoline should be considered 
      as second-line medication for treating ADHD in adults.

TI  - Long-term methylphenidate therapy in children with comorbid attention-deficit
      hyperactivity disorder and chronic multiple tic disorder.
PG  - 330-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study examined changes in attention-deficit hyperactivity (ADHD)
      behaviors and motor and vocal tics during long-term treatment with
      methylphenidate. METHODS: Thirty-four prepubertal children with ADHD and chronic 
      multiple tic disorder (who had participated in an 8-week, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled methylphenidate evaluation) were evaluated at 6-month
      intervals for 2 years as part of a prospective, nonblind, follow-up study.
      Treatment effects were assessed using direct observations of child behavior in a 
      simulated (clinic-based) classroom and behavior rating scales completed by
      parents and physician. Videotapes of the simulated classroom were scored by
      coders who were blind to treatment status. RESULTS: There was no evidence (group 
      data) that motor tics or vocal tics changed in frequency or severity during
      maintenance therapy compared with diagnostic or initial double-blind placebo
      evaluations. Behavioral improvements demonstrated during the acute drug trial
      were maintained during follow-up. There was no evidence (group data) of
      clinically significant adverse drug effects on cardiovascular function or growth 
      at the end of 2 years of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term treatment with
      methylphenidate seems to be safe and effective for the management of ADHD
      behaviors in many (but not necessarily all) children with mild to moderate tic
      disorder. Nevertheless, careful clinical monitoring is mandatory to rule out the 
      possibility of drug-induced tic exacerbation in individual patients.

PG  - 670-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the safety and efficacy of methylphenidate in children with
      the dual diagnosis of epilepsy and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
      (ADHD). STUDY DESIGN: Thirty children, aged 6.4 to 16.4 years, with epilepsy and 
      ADHD were studied during a 4-month period. During the initial 2 months of the
      study, the children were treated with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) only, and for
      the remaining 2 months, methylphenidate was added at a morning dose of 0.3 mg/kg.
      They underwent neurologic assessment, brain computed tomography, IQ testing, and 
      assessment with the Childhood Behavior Checklist at baseline before
      methylphenidate therapy. Electroencephalography, AED determinations, and the
      continuous-performance task (CPT) test were done at baseline and after 2 months
      of methylphenidate therapy. A double-blind, crossover design was used to compare 
      the effects of methylphenidate versus placebo on an electroencephalogram, AED
      levels, and the CPT. On the 2 days of testing, the child received AEDs and a
      capsule containing either placebo or methylphenidate. RESULTS: None of the 25
      children of this sample who were seizure free had attacks while taking
      methylphenidate. Of the 5 children with seizures, 3 had an increase in attacks,
      whereas the other 2 showed no change or a reduction. There were no significant
      changes in AED levels or electroencephalographic findings. Methylphenidate
      benefited 70% of children according to parental report; methylphenidate also
      enhanced performance on the CPT. Side effects of methylphenidate were mild and
      transient. CONCLUSION: Methylphenidate is effective in treating children with
      epilepsy and ADHD and safe in children who are seizure free. Caution is warranted
      for those still having seizures while receiving AED therapy.

TI  - A double-blind, crossover comparison of methylphenidate and placebo in adults
      with childhood-onset attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - 434-43
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are few controlled studies of methylphenidate hydrochloride in 
      adults with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and their results
      have been equivocal. The discrepancies among these studies may be related to low 
      doses, diagnostic uncertainties, and lack of attention to comorbid disorders.
      METHODS: We conducted a randomized, 7-week, placebo-controlled, crossover study
      of methylphenidate in 23 adult patients with DSM-III-R ADHD using standardized
      instruments for diagnosis, separate assessments of ADHD and depressive and
      anxiety symptoms, and a robust daily dose of methylphenidate hydrochloride, 1.0
      mg/kg per day. RESULTS: We found a marked therapeutic response for
      methylphenidate treatment of ADHD symptoms that exceeded the placebo response
      (78% vs 4%, P < .0001). Response to methylphenidate was independent of gender,
      psychiatric comorbidity with anxiety or moderate depression, or family history of
      psychiatric disorders. CONCLUSION: Robust doses of methylphenidate are effective 
      in the treatment of adult ADHD.
