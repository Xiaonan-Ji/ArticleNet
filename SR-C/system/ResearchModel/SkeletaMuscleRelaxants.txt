TI  - Chronic daily headache prophylaxis with tizanidine: a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, multicenter outcome study.
PG  - 470-82
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of tizanidine hydrochloride versus placebo as
      adjunctive prophylactic therapy for chronic daily headache (chronic migraine,
      migrainous headache, or tension-type headache). BACKGROUND: Tizanidine is an
      alpha2-adrenergic agonist that inhibits the release of norepinephrine at both the
      spinal cord and brain, with antinociceptive effects that are independent of the
      endogenous opioid system. Previous open-label studies have suggested the drug may
      be effective for treatment of chronic daily headache. METHODS: Two hundred
      patients completed a 4-week, single-blind, placebo baseline period, with 134
      fulfilling selection criteria and then randomized to tizanidine or placebo.
      Ninety-two patients completed at least 8 weeks of treatment (tizanidine, n = 45; 
      placebo, n = 47), and 85 patients completed 12 weeks of treatment (tizanidine, n 
      = 44; placebo, n = 41). Most patients (77%) met the diagnostic criteria for
      migraine of the International Headache Society; 23% had either chronic migrainous
      headache or chronic tension-type headache. Tizanidine was slowly titrated over 4 
      weeks to 24 mg or the maximum dose tolerated (mean, 18 mg; SD, 6.4; median, 20.0;
      range, 2 to 24), divided equally over three dose intervals per day. Overall
      headache index ([headache days x average intensity x duration in hours]/28 days) 
      was the primary end point. RESULTS: Tizanidine was shown to be superior to
      placebo in reducing the overall headache index (P =.0025), as well as mean
      headache days per week (P =.0193), severe headache days per week (P =.0211),
      average headache intensity (P =.0108), peak headache intensity (P =.0020), and
      mean headache duration (P =.0127). The mean percentage improvement during the
      last 4 weeks of treatment with tizanidine versus placebo was 54% versus 19% for
      the headache index (P =.0144), 55% versus 21% for severe headache days (P
      =.0331), 35% versus 19% for headache duration (P =.0142), 35% versus 20% for peak
      headache intensity (P =.0106), 33% versus 20% for average headache intensity (P
      =.0281), and 30% versus 22% for total headache days (P =.0593). Patients
      receiving tizanidine also scored higher ratings of overall headache improvement
      on a visual analog scale (P =.0069). There was no statistically significant
      difference in outcome for patients with chronic migraine versus those with only
      migrainous or tension-type headache. Adverse effects reported by more than 10% of
      the patients included somnolence (47%), dizziness (24%), dry mouth (23%), and
      asthenia (19%). Dropouts due to adverse events did not differ significantly
      between tizanidine and placebo. CONCLUSIONS: The results support tizanidine as an
      effective prophylactic adjunct for chronic daily headache, including migraine,
      migrainous headache, and tension-type headache. These results also suggest the
      possible importance of an alpha2-adrenergic mechanism underlying the
      pathophysiology of this spectrum of headache disorders.

TI  - Abuse of combinations of carisoprodol and tramadol.
PG  - 512-4
AB  - Neither carisoprodol (Soma) nor tramadol (Ultram) is a controlled substance at
      the federal level. However, evidence indicates that these medications may have
      abuse potential, particularly in patients with a history of substance abuse. We
      report three cases in which a combination of carisoprodol and tramadol was used
      illicitly to obtain psychotropic effects. Carisoprodol or tramadol should be
      prescribed with caution for patients at risk for substance abuse, and extreme
      caution should be used when prescribing both drugs simultaneously for any
      patient.

TI  - Modified-release formulation of tizanidine in chronic tension-type headache.
PG  - 633-7
AB  - The efficacy of the modified-release formulation of tizanidine (Sirdalud) was
      compared with placebo in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study of 138 
      women and 47 men, aged 18 to 79 years, with a history of chronic tension-type
      headache (IHS categories 2.2 and 2.3). The treatment period was 6 weeks preceded 
      by a 2-week prerandomization period. The patients were randomly assigned to
      receive 6-mg Sirdalud, 12-mg Sirdalud MR, or placebo. The study medication was
      taken once per day, orally in the evening. Efficacy was measured by visual analog
      scale, the number of headache-free days, the daily duration of headache, and the 
      use of paracetamol. The primary end point was the severity of daily headache
      derived from visual analog scale scores covering the last 2 treatment weeks. One 
      hundred sixty patients (56 in the 6-mg group, 49 in the 12-mg group, and 55 in
      the placebo group) completed the study. The severity of the headache decreased
      similarly in the treatment groups and the placebo group. The visual analog scale 
      values decreased from the prerandomization values by 53% in the 6-mg group, 48%
      in the 12-mg group, and 52% in the placebo group. The modified-release
      formulation of tizanidine in doses up to 12 mg taken in the evening is not
      superior to placebo in the treatment of chronic tension-type headache. The
      placebo effect was unexpectedly strong in the present study, supporting the view 
      that psychophysiological mechanisms are of considerable importance in sustaining 
      chronic tension-type headache.

TI  - Effect of baclofen on gait in spastic MS patients.
PG  - 244-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To measure gait and postural stability by objective methods in
      spastic MS patients and to evaluate the effect of baclofen on gait and postural
      stability. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fourteen spastic MS patients were examined in a 
      placebo controlled double-blind, cross-over trial of oral baclofen treatment. The
      gait was measured on a computerized treadmill and postural stability was measured
      on a computer assisted force-plate. RESULTS: Only insignificant improvements in
      the clinical measurements during baclofen treatment were found. At baseline gait 
      was characterized by low speed, short steps and unsteadiness. Postural stability 
      was severely impaired. During baclofen treatment only vertical unsteadiness of
      gait diminished significantly. DISCUSSION: We conclude that patients primarily
      with spasticity, concomitant with hampering or painful spasms and co-contractions
      should be offered treatment with baclofen. Only some will experience improvement 
      of their gait disorders, when treated with baclofen.

TI  - A review of carisoprodol deaths in Jefferson County, Alabama.
PG  - 726-30
AB  - BACKGROUND: Carisoprodol is a skeletal muscle relaxant with the potential for
      abuse. A carisoprodol overdose is rarely considered fatal. Nevertheless, we
      encountered carisoprodol in several cases, prompting review of our experience.
      METHODS: We did a retrospective study of cases examined at the Jefferson County
      Coroner/Medical Examiner Office from January 1, 1986, to October 31, 1997,
      reviewing investigative reports and autopsy findings. RESULTS: Carisoprodol was
      present in 24 cases. Seventeen decedents died of acute drug intoxication.
      Carisoprodol was never the sole drug detected at autopsy, nor was it ever the
      sole cause of death. Propoxyphene was a co-intoxicant in 8 of the 24 cases.
      CONCLUSIONS: Carisoprodol causes respiratory depression. Since the mechanism of
      death was respiratory depression in 82% of the decedents who died of acute
      intoxication, we consider that carisoprodol was probably responsible, in part,
      for those deaths. The simultaneous use of propoxyphene and carisoprodol seems to 
      be especially dangerous.

TI  - A comparison of clonidine, cyproheptadine and baclofen in spastic spinal cord
      injured patients.
PG  - 150-6
AB  - In twenty-five SCI subjects, antispasticity effects of three putative
      antispasticity agents [clonidine (an alpha-2 noradrenergic agonist),
      cyproheptadine (a 5-HT2 antagonist) and baclofen (a GABA-B agonist)] were tested 
      in terms of changes in leg tone as graded by the Ashworth scale (AS), in terms of
      the vibratory inhibition of the H-reflex (VII) and in terms of the ability of the
      knee to swing passively in the pendulum test as quantified by video motion
      analysis. When compared to the no drug period, all three drug treatments showed
      an antispasticity effect on the AS, the VII and the amplitude of the first swing 
      and the relaxation index of the pendulum test, p. < 0001. Surprisingly,
      cyproheptadine and baclofen produced a greater reduction in the VII than
      clonidine, p. < 01. The amplitude of the first swing in the pendulum test
      correlated well with the AS, r = .88, and the antispasticity effects of the drugs
      produced improvements in both measures, a reduced AS and increased amplitude of
      knee swing in the pendulum test. Therefore, video motion analysis of the pendulum
      test is as valid a measure of spasticity as the Ashworth scale and is not limited
      by subjectivity of the examiner.

TI  - Long-term botulinum toxin treatment of focal hand dystonia.
PG  - 70-6
AB  - We treated focal hand dystonia in 53 patients with botulinum toxin injections for
      up to 6 years. Eighty-one percent of the patients improved with at least one
      injection session. Sixty-five percent of the injections produced transient
      weakness. We followed 37 of the patients for at least 2 years from the start of
      treatment, 24 of whom discontinued treatment because of inadequate response, loss
      of response, inaccessibility of a treatment provider, or the expense of the
      toxin. Women, who had a greater extent and longer duration of benefit than men,
      were more likely to continue treatment. The mean interval between injection
      sessions was 6 months. In most patients, we injected the toxin into the same
      combination of muscles at each session. The dose of toxin generally fluctuated
      within a range of 20 units. Side effects were mild and transient and unrelated to
      the long-term use of botulinum toxin. Botulinum toxin injection is safe and
      effective for the long-term management of focal hand dystonia.

TI  - Epilepsy, psychosis, and schizophrenia: clinical and neuropathologic
      correlations.
PG  - 34-42
AB  - This study examines the relationship between epilepsy and psychosis. It compares 
      clinical, EEG, and neuropathologic data from a group of subjects who had both
      epilepsy and psychosis with similar information from another group of patients
      who had epilepsy but no evidence of psychotic illness. We examined, blind to
      clinical diagnosis, gross and microscopic material from whole-brain specimens
      from 10 patients diagnosed with epilepsy plus schizophrenia-like psychosis, nine 
      subjects diagnosed with epilepsy plus "epileptic psychosis," and 36 individuals
      with epilepsy (21 from an epileptic colony and 15 from the community at large)
      who had no history of psychosis (n = 10 + 9 + 21 + 15 = 55). We abstracted case
      histories without knowledge of pathologic findings. Epileptic colony patients had
      an earlier age at onset of seizures, while epileptic colony and epileptic
      psychosis patients had more frequent seizures. Epileptic individuals in the
      community died at a younger age than did epileptic patients in long-stay hospital
      care. Psychotic epileptic patients had larger cerebral ventricles, excess
      periventricular gliosis, and more focal cerebral damage compared with epileptic
      patients who had no psychotic illness. Epileptic patients with schizophrenia-like
      psychosis were distinguished from all other groups by a significant excess of
      pinpoint perivascular white-matter softenings. We found that mesial temporal
      sclerosis and temporal lobe epilepsy occurred with equal frequency in the
      psychotic and nonpsychotic groups; generalized seizures occurred more frequently 
      in the psychotic epileptics and the epileptic colony epileptics than in the
      community epileptic controls.

TI  - Comparison of amitriptyline, cyclobenzaprine, and placebo in the treatment of
      fibromyalgia. A randomized, double-blind clinical trial.
PG  - 32-40
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the relative efficacy and tolerability of amitriptyline,
      cyclobenzaprine, and placebo in the treatment of fibromyalgia, and to identify
      predictors of response to amitriptyline and cyclobenzaprine. METHODS: Two hundred
      eight patients who fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology criteria for
      the classification of fibromyalgia were entered into a 6-month prospective,
      double-blind, multicenter trial and were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups:
      amitriptyline, cyclobenzaprine, or placebo. RESULTS: After 1 month, 21%, 12%, and
      0% of the amitriptyline, cyclobenzaprine, and placebo patients, respectively, had
      significant clinical improvement (amitriptyline versus placebo P = 0.002,
      cyclobenzaprine versus placebo P = 0.02, amitriptyline versus cyclobenzaprine P
      not significant). These percentages increased to 36%, 33%, and 19%, respectively,
      at the 6-month assessment (P not significant). The nature and frequency of side
      effects reported by patients treated with amitriptyline and those reported by
      patients treated with cyclobenzaprine were similar. A normal Minnesota
      Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) profile at baseline was predictive of
      clinical improvement at the 1-month evaluation (odds ratio 3.3, 95% confidence
      interval 1.2-9.0). However, neither the MMPI profile nor any of the demographic, 
      clinical, or functional parameters evaluated at baseline predicted long-term
      response. CONCLUSION: Our data confirm the short-term efficacy of amitriptyline
      and cyclobenzaprine in a small percentage of patients with fibromyalgia.
      Long-term efficacy could not be demonstrated because of a higher-than-expected
      placebo response. Predictors of response to these drugs could not be determined.

TI  - Pharmacologic management of the spastic and dystonic upper limb in children with 
      cerebral palsy.
PG  - 585-9
AB  - Spasticity or dystonia of the upper limb in children with CP commonly is seen as 
      part of a more involved clinical picture. Each can cause functional problems in
      and can interfere with the quality of life of children with CP. Pharmacologic
      manipulation of the spasticity and dystonia requires a patient and ordered
      approach. Treatment often is performed using an open trial method, with
      medications introduced slowly but often being limited in their usefulness by
      significant side effects. Despite multiple medications being available for
      spasticity and dystonia management, few of the oral treatments have been assessed
      systematically in children with CP. Specific evaluation of the use of enteral
      medications in upper limb management is even rarer.

TI  - Clinical effectiveness of oral treatments for spasticity in multiple sclerosis: a
      systematic review.
PG  - 319-29
AB  - Spasticity is a common disabling feature of multiple sderosis. A variety of drugs
      are in regular use as oral treatment induding badofen, dantrolene, tizanidine,
      and diazepam. Published evidence of effectiveness is limited. Most trials are of 
      small size, of short duration, and have not reported on functional outcomes.
      Studies have been published which suggest that badofen, tizanidine, and diazepam 
      are all effective in reducing dinical measures of spasticity, but there is little
      evidence that they lead to an improvement in patient function. There is no
      evidence to suggest any difference in effectiveness between them. The evidence
      that dantrolene has any effect on spasticity is of poor quality. Diazepam and
      dantrolene are associated with more side effects than baclofen and tizanidine.
      There is evidence for the effectiveness of gabapentin in reducing spasticity and 
      improving function in the short term, though longer-term studies are needed to
      establish its true value. One randomized controlled trial of threonine does not
      support its effectiveness.

TI  - Quinine-associated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-hemolytic uremic syndrome:
      frequency, clinical features, and long-term outcomes.
PG  - 1047-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: Quinine-associated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-hemolytic
      uremic syndrome (TTP-HUS) is thought to be uncommon and to have a good prognosis.
      OBJECTIVE: To describe the frequency, clinical features, and long-term outcomes
      of quinine-associated TTP-HUS. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: Hospitals in
      central-western Oklahoma. PATIENTS: 225 consecutive patients with TTP-HUS,
      1989-2000. MEASUREMENTS: Presenting features and clinical outcomes. RESULTS:
      Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-hemolytic uremic syndrome was associated with
      quinine in 17 patients. Four patients died, and 7 survivors currently have
      chronic renal failure. Since 1 July 1995, 132 patients with clinically suspected 
      TTP-HUS were explicitly asked about drug exposure. Fourteen (11%) had taken
      quinine, and 7 had taken other drugs associated with TTP-HUS. Neurologic
      abnormalities were as severe in patients with quinine-associated TTP-HUS as in
      the 118 patients who had not taken quinine. CONCLUSIONS: Quinine is a common
      cause of drug-associated TTP-HUS and can cause death and chronic renal failure.
      When the disorder is described as TTP-HUS rather than only as HUS, the severity
      of neurologic abnormalities and the occasional absence of renal failure are
      emphasized. If recurrent disease is to be prevented, clinicians must recognize
      quinine as a possible cause.

TI  - Vegetarian diet in the treatment of fibromyalgia.
PG  - 41-7
AB  - Brain tryptophan is low in fibromyalgia. Intake of protein rich in large neutral 
      amino acids is reported to lower brain tryptophan. This study was undertaken to
      assess whether any reduction of such proteins by exclusion of animal protein from
      the diet reduced pain and morbidity in fibromyalgia patients. It was an open,
      randomized controlled trial. 37 subjects with fibromyalgia were enrolled in the
      vegetarian diet and 41 in the amitriptyline groups. The outcome was assessed with
      the help of frequencies of fatigue, insomnia & non-restorative sleep, pain score 
      on a 10-point VAS and tender point count. Fatigue, insomnia and non-restorative
      sleep were present in 41, 26 and 32 subjects before and in 3, 0 and 0 subjects
      respectively at six weeks of treatment in the amitriptyline group. The pain score
      and tender point count were 6.2 +/- 1.9 & 16.1 +/- 2.3 before and 2.3 +/- 1.3 &
      6.4 +/- 3.0 after treatment. All these differences were significant (P < 0.001). 
      In the vegetarian diet group, fatigue, insomnia and non-restorative sleep were
      present in 36, 24 and 27 subjects before and in 34, 29 and 29 subjects at six
      weeks of treatment. The pain score and tender point count were 5.7 +/- 1.8 and
      15.7 +/- 2.4 before and 5.0 +/- 1.8 & 14.7 +/- 3.6 after treatment. All these
      differences were insignificant except that in the pain score. The decrease in the
      pain score, though significant, was much smaller than that in the amitriptyline
      group. So, it may be concluded that vegetarian diet is a poor option in the
      treatment of fibromyalgia.

TI  - Impact of off-pump coronary artery surgery on myocardial performance and
      beta-adrenoceptor function.
PG  - 428-32
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the hemodynamic changes during beating heart
      revascularization of the left anterior descending artery, the circumflex artery, 
      and the right coronary artery as well as cardiovascular beta-adrenoceptor
      function before and after off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery. DESIGN:
      Prospective study. SETTING: University department of cardiothoracic anesthesia.
      PARTICIPANTS: Twenty patients scheduled for off-pump coronary artery bypass
      surgery using the Octopus 2 stabilizer system. INTERVENTIONS: Isoproterenol, 4
      microg, was administered intravenously after induction of anesthesia and again
      after surgery to monitor cardiac beta-receptor function. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN
      RESULTS: The hemodynamic responses to isoproterenol and cardiovascular variables 
      were monitored before, during, and after immobilization of the target coronary
      artery with catheters in the radial and pulmonary arteries. During surgery on the
      left anterior descending artery (n = 23), stroke volume and cardiac index
      decreased 17 mL (21%) and 400 mL (17%). During revascularization of the
      circumflex artery (n = 9), stroke volume and cardiac index decreased 19 mL (28%) 
      and 300 mL (17%). During surgery on the posterior aspect of the heart (n = 13),
      stroke volume and cardiac index decreased 22 mL (29%) and 400 mL (17%). All the
      cardiovascular variables had returned to baseline values 5 minutes after
      releasing the heart. The hemodynamic responses to isoproterenol were equal before
      and after surgery. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that the hemodynamic 
      changes associated with off-pump surgery on the 3 major coronary arteries are
      similar and of short duration. No desensitization of cardiovascular
      beta-adrenoceptors was found. This finding is in contrast to the deterioration in
      beta-adrenoceptor function seen after surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.

TI  - Newer antiepileptic drugs: advantages and disadvantages.
PG  - 277-83
AB  - The choice of an antiepileptic drug depends firstly on its efficacy in specific
      seizure types and epilepsies. However, it is imperative to consider whether
      possible adverse events will outweigh any benefits. The advantages and
      disadvantages of vigabatrin, lamotrigine, gabapentin, topiramate, tiagabine and
      felbamate are considered in some detail, and oxcarbazepine, stiripentol,
      remacemide, zonisamide and levetiracetam more briefly. Vigabatrin is effective
      for partial seizures and infantile spasms, but visual field defects are limiting 
      its use. Lamotrigine has a wide spectrum, needs to be prescribed with care.
      Gabapentin is unlikely to cause adverse effects, but has relatively poor
      efficacy. Topiramate is widely effective, but can be poorly tolerated. Tiagabine 
      is relatively untried in childhood epilepsies. The use of felbamate is restricted
      to severe refractory epilepsies. Stiripentol can be effective in severe myoclonic
      epilepsy in infancy. Zonisamide has a special place in the progressive myoclonus 
      epilepsies. Levetiracetam, remacemide and oxcarbazepine have been used mainly for
      partial seizures: further studies of their roles in other circumstances are
      required.

TI  - Gabapentin monotherapy: new indication. Sometimes helpful.
PG  - 40-2
AB  - (1) Gabapentin is now licensed for first-line or replacement monotherapy of
      partial epilepsy, in patients over 12 years of age. (2) The assessment file
      concurs with current recommendations of medicines agencies. (3) One comparative
      trial of first-line monotherapy showed a similar efficacy/adverse effects ratio
      of gabapentin and carbamazepine. Gabapentin has not been compared with valproate 
      sodium. (4) In one trial, involving patients with refractory epilepsy, various
      doses of gabapentin were added to an ongoing inadequately effective treatment,
      which was then gradually stopped. Gabapentin monotherapy was considered
      satisfactory in a minority of patients. (5) The adverse effects of gabapentin are
      limited to neuropsychological disorders, namely dizzy spells, drowsiness, fatigue
      and headache. The risk of interactions is also limited. (6) The optimal dose
      regimen of gabapentin is not yet established.

TI  - Gabapentin in the treatment of hemifacial spasm.
PG  - 110-2
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of gabapentin in the treatment of hemifacial
      spasm. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-three patients with hemifacial spasm not
      suitable for surgery or therapy with botulinum toxin were treated with
      gabapentin. The main efficacy parameter was the percentage of spasm reduction.
      RESULTS: A clinically significant reduction of spasms was obtained by 16
      patients. CONCLUSION: Gabapentin was effective and safe in reducing hemifacial
      spasm in 16 out 23 (69.6%) patients.

TI  - The stiff-man syndrome and related disorders.
PG  - 147-53
AB  - The stiff-man syndrome (SMS) is characterised by rigidity and spasm of
      predominantly axial and proximal limb muscles. The cause of the condition is
      unknown but the finding of antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) in
      approximately 60% of patients has suggested an autoimmune basis. Pathological
      findings are limited to a small number of cases which are reviewed in this paper.
      In some, evidence of an inflammatory aetiology has been found, and there appears 
      to be overlap with progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity (PER) which may
      present with a similar clinical picture. The spontaneous muscle activity in SMS
      and PER is of central origin, related to release of polysynaptic spinal and
      brainstem reflexes. The SMS is readily distinguished from the continuous muscle
      activity, spasm and cramps of Isaac's syndrome and neuromyotonia which originate 
      in the peripheral nervous system. Fasciculations, myokymia, myotonia and complex 
      repetitive discharges are characteristic of these peripheral neuromuscular
      disorders.

TI  - Open-label dose-titration safety and efficacy study of tizanidine hydrochloride
      in the treatment of spasticity associated with chronic stroke.
PG  - 1841-6
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Spasticity is a frequently observed motor impairment that
      develops after stroke; it can cause pain and disability in those affected. The
      objective of the present study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      tizanidine, a centrally acting alpha(2)-adrenergic agonist, in the treatment of
      stroke-related spasticity. METHODS: Forty-seven patients, who were a minimum of 6
      months poststroke and had significant spasticity, were studied at 4 centers.
      Tizanidine was administered in an open-label manner for 16 weeks, beginning at 2 
      mg/d and slowly titrated to a maximum of 36 mg/d. The Modified Ashworth Scale,
      muscle strength testing, functional assessments, and Pain and Functional
      Spasticity Questionnaires were administered at baseline and at 4, 8, 16, and 18
      weeks (after 1 week off tizanidine). RESULTS: Spasticity was significantly
      improved between baseline and week 16, with a decrease in total upper extremity
      Modified Ashworth Scale score of 2.80+/-0.47 (P<0.0001). No decline in strength
      was noted. Treatment with tizanidine resulted in a significant improvement in
      pain intensity (P=0.0375), quality of life (P=0.0001), and physician assessment
      of disability (P=0.0001). The most frequent side effects were somnolence (62%)
      and dizziness (32%). No serious adverse events were considered to be drug
      related. Ten of 47 patients (21%) were able to reach the maximum daily dosage of 
      36 mg. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the data suggest that tizanidine is safe and
      efficacious in the treatment of stroke-related spasticity, preserving muscle
      strength while reducing muscle tone and painful spasms in affected patients.

TI  - Clinical and functional outcome after alcohol neurolysis of the tibial nerve for 
      ankle-foot spasticity.
PG  - 733-9
AB  - PURPOSE: To report one's experience of using 50-100% alcohol for neurolysis of
      the tibial nerve in chronic ankle-foot spasticity. METHODS: The records of
      patients who received alcohol neurolysis of the tibial nerve were retrospectively
      reviewed. Repetitive monopolar nerve stimulation was used to localize the tibial 
      nerve. Outcome measures included muscle tone as measured by the Modified Ashworth
      Score (MAS), passive ankle range of motion (PROM), effect on clonus, plantar
      flexor motor strength, visual gait analysis and use of orthoses. RESULTS: A total
      of 21 tibial nerves were neurolysed in 18 patients (mean age 38.9 +/- 15.8 years,
      12 males, six females). Mean duration post-event was 14.8 +/- 3.9 months. The
      mean pre-neurolysis MAS was 2.50 +/- 0.77 and this improved to 0.97 +/- 0.88 (p <
      0.001) and 0.93 +/- 0.85 (p < 0.001) at 1 and 6 months post-procedure,
      respectively. Average duration of effect was 10.5 +/- 8.9 months. Eleven out of
      12 patients (91.7%) with sustained ankle clonus had complete abolishment lasting 
      6 months. Mean gain in PROM was 24.6 +/- 16.1 degrees and 32.6 +/- 19.0 degrees
      at 1 and 3 months post-neurolysis, respectively (p < 0.001, < 0.02). No decrease 
      in motor strength was seen post-neurolysis. All 13 ambulant patients had visible 
      improvements in gait. Complications were transient and included dysesthetic pain 
      (4), sensory loss (1) and distal limb oedema (1). CONCLUSION: Alcohol neurolysis 
      (50-100%) of the tibial nerves is an effective and safe method of managing
      ankle-foot spasticity.

TI  - Treatment advances for cocaine-induced ischemic stroke: focus on
      dihydropyridine-class calcium channel antagonists.
PG  - 1191-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors reviewed the pathogenesis of cocaine-related cerebral
      ischemia, appraised current knowledge of its sequelae, and assessed the role of
      putative therapeutic agents, particularly dihydropyridine-class calcium channel
      antagonists. METHOD: The authors performed an OVID-based literature review of all
      indexed journals between 1966 and 2000. RESULTS: Cocaine abuse significantly
      increases the risk of ischemic stroke. The principal mechanism of cocaine-induced
      cerebral ischemia is vasospasm of large cranial arteries or within the cortical
      microvasculature. Increased levels of extracellular monoamines, particularly
      dopamine, mediate vasospasm. Neuroanatomical and labeling studies also have shown
      that dopamine-innervated neurons may regulate cerebral blood flow. Indeed,
      dopamine-rich brain regions appear to be relatively specific targets for
      cocaine-induced cerebral ischemia. Neuroimaging studies show that cocaine-induced
      hypoperfusion can persist even after 6 months of abstinence. Hypoperfusion can
      result in deficits on complex and simple psychomotor tasks but perhaps not on
      memory or attention. Severe cerebral ischemia can directly precipitate neuronal
      death and degradation, a condition exacerbated by liberation of the excitatory
      amino acid glutamate. Dihydropyridine-class calcium channel antagonists inhibit
      cocaine-mediated dopamine release on neurons involved in vasospasm and the
      control of cortical circulation. Other causes of cerebral ischemia include
      thrombogenesis and vasculitis. Although antithrombotic agents have potential in
      alleviating cocaine's neurotoxic effects, their use may be limited by the risk of
      spontaneous hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: Cocaine abuse can result in stroke,
      neuroischemia, and cognitive deficits that can persist even after prolonged
      abstinence. Dihydropyridine-class calcium channel antagonists, such as
      isradipine, show promise as therapeutic agents for preventing cocaine-induced
      cerebral ischemia.

TI  - Gender differences in depression associated with neurologic illness: clinical
      correlates and pharmacologic response.
PG  - 65-72
AB  - Functional depression (i.e., depression without neuropathology) occurs
      approximately twice as often in women as in men. A review of the literature from 
      the period 1966-1999 on the prevalence, clinical correlates, and treatment of
      depression in neurologic disease revealed a female preponderance of depression in
      diffuse neurologic disease, including Alzheimer's disease. In focal neurologic
      disease, the data were consistent for men and women, with a 1:1 ratio. Treatment 
      data on depression in neurologic disease are scant, with the exception of
      poststroke depression. Although gender-based outcome data on the treatment of
      functional depression reveal better tolerability and response to serotonin
      reuptake inhibitors in women than in men, this phenomenon cannot be generalized
      to depression in neurologic disease. Men seem to consistently respond better than
      premenopausal women to tricyclic antidepressants in both functional and
      neurologic disease. Understanding how gender influences depression in neurologic 
      illness and its response to treatment is a necessary step to improve the
      specificity of psychiatric treatment for depression.

TI  - Early coadministration of clonazepam with sertraline for panic disorder.
PG  - 681-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is debate about combining benzodiazepines with selective
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the acute treatment of panic disorder. Although 
      this medication combination is widely used in clinical practice, there is no
      well-tested, optimal method of coadministering these medications for the
      treatment of panic disorder. The purpose of this study was to test the efficacy
      of early coadministration of clonazepam with sertraline in the treatment of panic
      disorder. METHODS: Fifty patients with panic disorder were randomized into a
      double-blind clinical trial. Patients received open-label sertraline for 12 weeks
      (target dose, 100 mg/d), and in addition were randomized to groups receiving
      either 0.5 mg of active clonazepam 3 times daily or placebo clonazepam for the
      first 4 weeks of the trial. The clonazepam dose was then tapered during 3 weeks
      and discontinued. RESULTS: Thirty-four (68%) of 50 patients completed the trial. 
      Drop-out rates were similar in the sertraline/placebo vs the
      sertraline/clonazepam group (38% vs 25%) (P =.5). An intent-to-treat analysis (on
      last observation carried forward data) revealed a much greater proportion of
      responders in the sertraline/clonazepam compared with the sertraline/placebo
      group at the end of week 1 of the trial (41% vs 4%) (P =.003). There was also a
      significant between-group difference at the end of week 3 with 14 (63%) of 22 of 
      the sertraline/clonazepam group responding to treatment vs 8 (32%) of 25 of the
      sertraline/placebo group (P =.05). This difference was not observed at other
      times during the trial. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that rapid stabilization 
      of panic symptoms can be safely achieved with a sertraline/clonazepam
      combination, supporting the clinical utility of this type of regimen for
      facilitating early improvement of panic symptoms relative to sertraline alone.

TI  - Randomized placebo controlled trial of lofexidine hydrochloride for chronic
      pelvic pain in women.
PG  - 1719-21
AB  - BACKGROUND: We hypothesised that the orally-active alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist 
      lofexidine hydrochloride would ameliorate chronic pelvic pain in women. METHODS: 
      A randomized placebo-controlled parallel group trial was undertaken in the
      University Hospital Gynaecology Clinic. Women with pelvic pain of at least 6
      months duration were eligible, and were randomized using a sealed envelope system
      to receive up to 600 mg lofexidine hydrochloride twice daily over 8 weeks or
      placebo. Outcome measures were summary and daily diary visual analog scales for
      pain (VAS) and a 5 point self rating scale. RESULTS: 9/19 women randomized to
      lofexidine completed the study compared to 14/20 of those randomized to placebo. 
      Intention-to-treat analysis showed that 4/19 in the lofexidine group achieved 50%
      or greater reduction in VAS compared with 8/20 in the placebo group (OR 2.5, 95% 
      CI 0.6--10.3). Summary and diary VAS were closely correlated. CONCLUSIONS: Within
      the limits of a small study with power to detect only a substantial effect, we
      conclude that lofexidine hydrochloride is not effective for the treatment of
      chronic pelvic pain.

AB  - The successful management of epilepsy requires a thorough and individualized
      approach that accurately establishes the patient's seizure type(s) and, when
      appropriate, epilepsy syndrome. Selection of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic
      therapy should be rational and tailored to each patient. In this manner,
      clinicians are able to take advantage of new treatments to minimize the impact of
      seizures, treatment side effects, and epilepsy-related psychosocial difficulties 
      on their patients, thereby enabling them to function in society at the highest
      possible level.

TI  - Outcomes assessment of clinical pharmacy services in a psychiatric inpatient
      setting.
PG  - 1309-16
AB  - The effects of psychiatric pharmacy services on clinical outcomes of acute care
      psychiatric inpatients were studied. Patients recruited at a state psychiatric
      facility during phase 1 (October 1996-March 1997) served as the control group and
      received only traditional centralized pharmaceutical services and
      physician-requested psychiatric pharmacotherapy consultations. Patients recruited
      during phase 2 (May-December 1997) received intensive psychiatric pharmacy
      services and served as the experimental group. Pharmaceutical services during
      phase 2 included attending treatment team meetings, performing baseline
      assessments and weekly reviews, providing pharmacotherapy recommendations,
      obtaining medication histories, reviewing drug administration records daily,
      monitoring for adverse drug reactions, conducting medication education classes,
      and counseling patients before discharge. Outcome variables included clinical
      response determined with objective rating scales, cost of care, length of stay,
      adverse events, rate of acceptance of recommendations, patient compliance with
      the first clinic visit scheduled after discharge, quality of life, and patient
      satisfaction. Data were analyzed for 48 patients in the control group and 45
      patients in the experimental group. There were no significant differences between
      the two groups with respect to age, sex, duration of illness, number of
      hospitalizations, and number of months since the last hospitalization. Patients
      in the experimental group showed significant improvements in clinical response
      and drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms compared with the controls and were
      highly satisfied with the pharmaceutical services they received. Medication costs
      did not differ significantly, and length of stay was about 29 days for each
      group. The provision of clinical pharmacy services provided to inpatients in an
      acute care psychiatric facility was associated with improvements in rating-scale 
      scores for clinical response and for drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms.

TI  - Area-selective stimulus-provoked seizures in post-anoxic coma.
PG  - 294-7
AB  - We describe the case of a 70-year-old patient in whom hemiconvulsive seizures
      occurred during metabolic derangement, multiple stroke and post-anoxic coma
      following cardiac arrest. We employed the methods of clinical and EEG evaluation 
      and CT brain scan. We found that hemiconvulsive seizures were provoked following 
      a light tactile stimulus in the left-trigeminal area and occasionally a strong
      tapping in the right-trigeminal area. We conclude that this type of
      stimulus-provoked seizure is extremely rare and could be explained by diffuse and
      severe brain damage.

TI  - Antiepileptogenic agents: how close are we?
PG  - 1045-55
AB  - Epilepsy is a common neurological condition, affecting about 4% of individuals
      over their lifetime. Epilepsy can be idiopathic, secondary to an underlying
      genetic abnormality or unknown causes, or acquired. Known potential causes
      account for about one third of epilepsy. Control of epilepsy has primarily
      focused on suppressing seizure activity after epilepsy has developed. An
      intriguing possibility is to control acquired epilepsy by preventing
      epileptogenesis, the process by which the brain becomes epileptic. Many
      laboratory models simulate human epilepsy as well as provide a system for
      studying epileptogenesis. The kindling model involves repeated application of
      subconvulsive electrical stimulation to the brain, leading to spontaneous
      seizures. Other models include the cortical or systemic injection of various
      chemicals. These models suggest that many antiepileptic drugs, from phenobarbital
      and valproate (valproic acid) to levetiracetam and tiagabine, have
      antiepileptogenic potential. Some promising other possibilities include
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) or
      alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) antagonists as
      well as the neurotrophins and their receptors. Phenobarbital, phenytoin,
      valproate, carbamazepine and, to a very limited extent, diazepam have been
      evaluated in clinical trials to test whether they actually prevent
      epileptogenesis in humans. Results have been very disappointing. Meta-analyses of
      12 different drug-condition combinations show none with significantly lower
      unprovoked seizure rates among those receiving the active drug. In 4 of the 12,
      the observed rate was actually slightly higher among treated individuals. None of
      the newer drugs have been evaluated in antiepileptogenesis trials. Until some
      drugs demonstrate a clear antiepileptogenic effect in clinical trials, the best
      course to reduce the incidence of epilepsy is primary prevention of the
      risk-increasing events--for example, wearing helmets, using seat belts, or
      decreasing the risk of stroke by reducing smoking.

TI  - Cyclobenzaprine and back pain: a meta-analysis.
PG  - 1613-20
AB  - BACKGROUND: Back pain is a common problem for which cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride
      is frequently prescribed. OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review of
      cyclobenzaprine's effectiveness in the treatment of back pain. METHODS: We
      searched MEDLINE, PsycLIT, CINAHL, EMBASE, AIDSLINE, HEALTHSTAR, CANCERLIT, the
      Cochrane Library, Micromedex, Federal Research in Progress, and the references of
      reviewed articles, and contacted Merck, Sharpe and Dohme for English-language,
      randomized, placebo-controlled trials of cyclobenzaprine in adults with back
      pain. Outcomes included global improvement and 5 specific domains of back pain
      (local pain, muscle spasm, range of motion, tenderness to palpation, and
      activities of daily living). Study quality was assessed using the methods of
      Jadad. Summary outcomes were obtained using a random-effects model. RESULTS:
      Patients treated with cyclobenzaprine were nearly 5 times (odds ratio, 4.7; 95%
      confidence interval, 2.7-8.1) as likely to report symptom improvement by day 14
      as were those treated with placebo. Slightly fewer than 3 individuals (2.7; 95%
      confidence interval, 2.0-4.2) needed treatment for 1 to improve. The magnitude of
      this improvement was modest, with an effect size of 0.38 to 0.58 in all 5
      outcomes (local pain, muscle spasm, tenderness to palpation, range of motion, and
      activities of daily living). Treatment efficacy for these 5 outcomes was greatest
      early, in the first few days of treatment, declining after the first week.
      Patients receiving cyclobenzaprine also experienced more adverse effects, the
      most common being drowsiness. CONCLUSIONS: Cyclobenzaprine is more effective than
      placebo in the management of back pain; the effect is modest and comes at the
      price of greater adverse effects. The effect is greatest in the first 4 days of
      treatment, suggesting that shorter courses may be better. Studies comparing the
      relative value of acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and
      cyclobenzaprine individually and in combination in the treatment of back pain are
      needed.

TI  - Pain in the nursing home.
PG  - 575-94, viii
AB  - The treatment of pain in the nursing home setting continues to present several
      unique and challenging problems. Increasingly, studies are focusing on the large 
      number of elderly with important pain problems in long-term care. The inclusion
      of pain as an area of clinical focus in the Minimum Data Set has fueled interest 
      in this problem and will provide solid data for future study. Researchers are
      attempting to establish reliable and valid data using standardized assessment
      tools previously validated in younger adults and are attempting use of
      traditional and cutting-edge assessment tools in cognitively impaired patients.
      Assessment is being linked to innovative interventions in noncommunicative,
      cognitively impaired residents using primary care nurses who best know these
      patients to decipher "normal" from "abnormal" behavior. The application of
      available pharmacologic interventions are more challenging because of the higher 
      incidence of side effects in the elderly; part of this problem is the result of
      the decreased hepatic metabolism and renal clearance present in older patients.
      The nursing home environment has limited resources that can create logistical
      concerns in terms of diagnosis and treatment but also can positively limit overly
      invasive modalities. This article explores these issues and offers suggestions
      for the appropriate assessment and management of pain in long-term care
      residents.

TI  - Advances in neurointensive care.
PG  - 300-9
AB  - PURPOSE: To highlight recent advances in neurological and neurosurgical intensive
      care. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search was conducted from January 1980 to August
      2000. Keywords included intensive care, head injury, subarachnoid haemorrhage,
      status epilepticus, myasthenic crisis, Guillain-Barre syndrome and stroke. All
      articles in English were considered for review. Additional articles were
      identified from the references of the retrieved articles and cross-referencing
      selected articles. DATA EXTRACTION: All clinical studies, review articles and
      abstracts were reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS: Rapid advances in neurological and
      neurosurgical intensive care in the last decade have led to the development of
      specialised neurointensive care units with joint ventures between neurology and
      neurosurgery. Work in these units have contributed immensely to our understanding
      of the pathophysiology and management of acute brain injury. The principles of
      intensive care management include amelioration or reversal of brain injury and
      preservation of normal neural tissue. Treatment algorithms are possible with the 
      aid of intense clinical and neurophysiologic monitoring. Ongoing clinical and
      basic science research may provide new treatment options for the intensivist in
      the acute phase of brain injury. CONCLUSION: Specialised neurointensive care
      units provide the best environment for the patient with acute brain injury.
      Outcome is frequently enhanced the clinicians skilled towards dealing with the
      whole spectrum of neurologic insults.

TI  - Clinical characteristics and management of ALS.
PG  - 155-66
AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common form of degenerative motor
      neuron disease in adulthood. The clinical picture was accurately described by
      Charcot over 125 years ago and consists of generalized fasciculations,
      progressive atrophy and weakness of the skeletal muscles, spasticity and
      pyramidal tract signs, dysarthria, dysphagia, and dyspnea. Pseudobulbar affect is
      common. Disease-specific treatment options are still unsatisfactory. However,
      therapeutic nihilism is not justified as a large array of palliative measures is 
      available to enhance the quality of life of patients and their families.
      Palliative care in ALS is a multidisciplinary effort requiring careful
      coordination. An open and frank disclosure of the diagnosis is of paramount
      importance. Nutritional deficiency due to pronounced dysphagia can be relieved by
      a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. Respiratory insufficiency can be
      effectively treated by noninvasive home mechanical ventilation. The terminal
      phase of the disease should be discussed, at the latest, when symptoms of dyspnea
      appear in order to prevent unwarranted fears of "choking to death." Collaboration
      with hospice and completion of advance directives can be of invaluable help in
      the terminal phase.

TI  - Antiepileptogenesis and seizure prevention trials with antiepileptic drugs:
      meta-analysis of controlled trials.
PG  - 515-24
AB  - PURPOSE: To synthesize evidence concerning the effect of antiepileptic drugs
      (AEDs) for seizure prevention and to contrast their effectiveness for provoked
      versus unprovoked seizures. METHODS: Medline, Embase, and The Cochrane Clinical
      Trials Register were the primary sources of trials, but all trials found were
      included. Minimal requirements: seizure-prevention outcome given as fraction of
      cases; AED or control assigned by random or quasi-random mechanism. Single
      abstracter. Aggregate relative risk and heterogeneity evaluated using
      Mantel-Haenszel analyses; random effects model used if heterogeneity was
      significant. RESULTS: Forty-seven trials evaluated seven drugs or combinations
      for preventing seizures associated with fever, alcohol, malaria, perinatal
      asphyxia, contrast media, tumors, craniotomy, and traumatic brain injury.
      Effective: Phenobarbital for recurrence of febrile seizures [relative risk (RR), 
      0.51; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.32-0.82) and cerebral malaria (RR, 0.36;
      CI, 0.23-0.56). Diazepam for contrast media-associated seizures (RR, 0.10; CI,
      0.01-0.79). Phenytoin for provoked seizures after craniotomy or traumatic brain
      injury (craniotomy: RR, 0.42; CI, 0.25-0.71; TBI: RR, 0.33; CI, 0.19-0.59).
      Carbamazepine for provoked seizures after traumatic brain injury (RR, 0.39; CI,
      0.17-0.92). Lorazepam for alcohol-related seizures (RR, 0.12; CI, 0.04-0.40).
      More than 25% reduction ruled out valproate for unprovoked seizures after
      traumatic brain injury (RR, 1.28; CI, 0.76-2.16), and carbamazepine for
      unprovoked seizures after craniotomy (RR, 1.30; CI, 0.75-2.25). CONCLUSIONS:
      Effective or promising results predominate for provoked (acute, symptomatic)
      seizures. For unprovoked (epileptic) seizures, no drug has been shown to be
      effective, and some have had a clinically important effect ruled out.

TI  - Radioisotopic control for baclofen pump catheter failure.
PG  - 283-5
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Case report of Baclofen pump catheter failure investigated by
      radioisotope injection. OBJECTIVES: To report a safe and reliable method for
      evaluating catheter dysfunction. SETTING: France. METHODS: Single case report of 
      failure of Baclofen pump investigated by radioisotope injection. RESULTS: The
      injection demonstrated the block in the catheter. The catheter failure was not
      visualised by plain X-ray nor by filling the pump with radio-opaque solution.
      CONCLUSION: Catheter failure is a common cause of intrathecal drug delivery
      problems and may be difficult to diagnose. When catheter disconnection, kink, or 
      dislodgement is not visible on X-ray, radioisotopic control is a safe and
      reliable method for assessment.

      starvation before regional anaesthesia for cataract surgery, the use of sedation 
      in these patients, monitoring and if oxygen supplementation was given. The
      results show that most patients are not starved before this type of regional
      anaesthesia, and that the majority of patients receive no supplementary sedation 
      or intravenous analgesia. Over 70% of patients received oxygen supplementation.

TI  - Combined motor disturbances following severe traumatic brain injury: an
      integrative long-term treatment approach.
PG  - 633-8
AB  - Patients surviving severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) often suffer from residual
      impairments in motor control, communication skills, cognition and social
      behaviour. These distinctly hamper their capability to return to their
      'pre-trauma' activity. Comprehensive and integrated rehabilitation programmes
      initiate, during the acute phase, a prolonged treatment process which starts at
      the most sophisticated medical systems. There is no clear end point for the
      treatment of these patients, since the recovery process and the rehabilitation
      activity may continue for years, even after patients return home to live with
      their families. The inherent inability to make a firm early prediction regarding 
      outcome of patients and the late appearance of additional symptoms stress the
      need for a comprehensive close long-term follow-up. The following presentation
      concerns the description of the treatment strategy and long-term improvement of a
      22-year-old male who suffered from very severe TBI. On admission to the emergency
      room, he was in the decerebrated position and his Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was at
      the lowest (3). The focus of this presentation is on the recovery of motor
      function. The initial motor disabilities included weakness in all four limbs, in 
      particular left hemiplegia, and right hemiparesis with severe bilateral ataxic
      elements and a marked tremor of the right arm. Range of motion was limited in
      hips, and he suffered from stiff trunk and neck. Goals of physiotherapy were
      directed towards improving range of motion (ROM) and active movement. Casting,
      use of orthoses, biofeedback, hydrotherapy, hippotherapy, medication and nerve
      blocks for reducing spasticity were timely applied during the process. The motor 
      improvement in this very severe TBI patient who is now over 3 years post-injury
      still continues and has a functional meaning. He has succeeded in being able to
      stand up by himself from a chair and is able to walk unaided and without orthoses
      for very short distances--up to five steps. He is able to drink soup without
      assistance and play a few notes on the piano. Marked cognitive improvement
      occurred as well. It is concluded that motor improvement may be evident over long
      periods of time and various timely interventions may assist in the process.

TI  - Improvement of sleep apnea in a patient with cerebral palsy.
PG  - 540-2
AB  - Intrathecal baclofen (ITB) can reduce spasticity in adults and children with
      cerebral palsy. Benefits of ITB therapy include improved Ashworth scores,
      activities of daily living, and mobility. The impact of ITB therapy on sleep
      apnea in patients with cerebral palsy has not been reported. This case report
      describes a 29-yr-old female with mixed spastic athetoid quadriparetic cerebral
      palsy with dystonia, gross motor function IV, who had sleep apnea, requiring
      nightly continuous positive airway pressure. She received ITB with the goal to
      improve her wheelchair positioning and decrease her excessive movements. After
      the initiation of the ITB, reduction of her spasticity and dystonia was noted, as
      well as improvement of her sleep apnea. This case suggests that ITB therapy may
      improve respiratory function through reduction of respiratory muscle spasticity.

TI  - Growth parameters and endocrine function in relation to echocardiographic
      parameters in children with ventricular septal defect without heart failure.
PG  - 146-52
AB  - To determine the effect of ventricular function, size of ventricular septal
      defect (VSD), and endocrine function on linear growth in children with VSD, we
      studied 88 children with VSD over a period of 1 year. Growth was assessed by
      determining the height standard deviation scores (HtSDS) and growth velocity (GV)
      every 4 months. Two hundred age-matched normal children served as controls for
      the growth data. Endocrine evaluation was performed in 30 randomly selected
      children with VSD, and 20 age-matched children with constitutional delay of
      growth (CSS). Growth hormone (GH) response to clonidine provocation was evaluated
      and circulating free thyroxine (FT4) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I)
      concentrations measured. Echocardiographic evaluation of the different cardiac
      parameters including shunt size and shunt fraction (Qp/Qs) was performed using a 
      colour-coded echodoppler. The HtSDS, body mass index (BMI), and mid-arm
      circumference (MAC) of children with VSD were significantly decreased compared to
      those for the normal control group. The dietary intake evaluated by the recall
      method, appeared to be adequate in the majority of these children (83/88). IGF-I 
      concentrations were reduced in children with VSD (87.5 +/- 29 ng/ml) versus
      normal age-matched children (169 +/- 42 ng/ml). Basal and clonidine-stimulated GH
      concentrations were significantly higher in children with VSD (4.6 +/- 2.1
      microg/l and 28.8 +/- 7.9 microg/l respectively) versus controls (17.8 +/- 4.2
      microg/l). In these patients (n = 88) the HtSDS was correlated negatively with
      the size of the shunt (r = -0.793, p < 0.001), shunt fraction (Qp/Qs) (r = -0.76,
      p < 0.001), pulmonary mean gradient (r = -0.4, p = 0.006), and pulmonary maximum 
      velocity (r = -0.32, p = 0.02). Growth velocity (GV) was correlated negatively
      with pulmonary maximum gradient (r = -0.3, p = 0.02), pulmonary maximum velocity 
      (r = -0.37, p = 0.007), and pulmonary stroke volume (Qp) (r = -0.345, p = 0.01). 
      The BMI and IGF-I concentrations were correlated significantly with the size of
      the shunt (r = -0.453, p < 0.01), Qp/Qs (r = -0.432, p < 0.01), HtSDS (r = 0.565,
      p < 0.01), and BMI (r = 0.435, p < 0.01). It appears that in patients with VSD,
      the size of the left-to-right shunt and the abnormal hemodynamics in the
      pulmonary circulation are important factors in the etiology of impaired growth.
      It is suggested that the hypermetabolic status of these patients compromise
      nutrition and this decreases IGF-I synthesis with subsequent slowing of linear
      growth and weight gain.

TI  - Nocturnal leg cramps. Clinically mysterious and painful--but manageable.
PG  - 34, 39-42
AB  - Nocturnal leg cramps are common occurrences among older, generally healthy
      adults. Although there are many known causes--endocrinologic, neurologic, and
      vascular disorders, treatment with certain drugs, and occupational factors--a
      significant portion of cases are idiopathic. History, physical exam, and
      laboratory testing can provide clues for distinguishing between cramps with
      identifiable causes and idiopathic cases. For nonidiopathic cases, management
      consists of treating the underlying cause whenever possible. A nonpharmacologic
      approach (massaging and stretching) is the recommended first-line treatment for
      idiopathic cases. Quinine sulfate also appears to offer safe and effective
      symptom management of idiopathic cases, although its efficacy has not been
      definitively established in clinical trials.

TI  - Recent advances in the diagnosis and management of epilepsy.
PG  - 73-84
AB  - Epilepsy is the second most common neurological disorder in developed countries. 
      Recent advances in the understanding of pathogenetic mechanisms and in the
      diagnosis and management of epilepsy over the past decade have had a significant 
      impact on every aspect of epilepsy management. A simple diagnosis is inadequate
      for both patients and physicians. A full diagnostic investigation to classify the
      type of epilepsy is now mandatory for appropriate care. In this review, current
      views on pathogenetic mechanisms, controversies in classification, advances in
      neuroimaging techniques, the use of novel antiepileptic drugs, and
      non-pharmacological treatment options for intractable epilepsy will be discussed.

TI  - Pantoprazole.
PG  - 999-1008
AB  - The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, and
      dosage and administration of pantoprazole are reviewed. Pantoprazole is a gastric
      hydrogen-potassium adenosine triphosphatase (H+/K(+)-ATPase) inhibitor. It shares
      the same core structure as other currently available proton-pump inhibitors
      (PPIs). The FDA-labeled indication is the short-term treatment of erosive
      esophagitis. PPIs act by selectively inhibiting H+/K(+)-ATPase in the secretory
      canaliculus of the stimulated parietal cell. Understanding the pharmacodynamics
      of PPIs is more relevant than knowing their pharmacokinetics, since the duration 
      of action depends on the rate of de novo proton-pump regeneration, not the
      duration of drug circulation in the body. Pantoprazole is well absorbed,
      undergoes little first-pass metabolism, and has an absolute bioavailability of
      approximately 77%. Pantoprazole has been evaluated in more than 100 clinical
      trials involving more than 11,000 patients. It is effective in treating erosive
      esophagitis and duodenal and gastric ulcers. It is also effective as adjunctive
      treatment with antimicrobials in patients infected with Helicobacter pylori.
      Pantoprazole has been shown to control acid production in Zollinger-Ellison
      syndrome. Pantoprazole is well tolerated. The most commonly reported adverse
      effects are headache, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. The recommended oral dosage
      for erosive esophagitis is 40 mg once a day for up to eight weeks. The
      recommended i.v. dose is 40 mg given over 15 minutes once a day in patients with 
      gastroesophageal reflux disease who are unable to take oral medication.
      Pantoprazole appears to be as safe and effective as other PPIs in acid-related
      disorders.

TI  - Pain following spinal cord injury.
PG  - 63-73
AB  - Chronic pain is an important problem following spinal cord injury (SCI) and is a 
      major impediment to effective rehabilitation. The reported prevalence of chronic 
      SCI pain is variable but averages 65% with around one third of these people
      rating their pain as severe. The mechanisms responsible for the presence of pain 
      are poorly understood. However, evidence from clinical observations and the use
      of animal models of SCI pain suggests that a number of processes may be
      important. These include functional and structural plastic changes in the central
      nervous system following injury, with changes in receptor function and loss of
      normal inhibition resulting in an increased neuronal excitability. A number of
      specific types of SCI pain can be distinguished based on descriptors, location
      and response to treatment. Nociceptive pain can arise from musculoskeletal
      structures and viscera and neuropathic pain can arise from spinal cord and nerve 
      damage. The role of psychological and environmental factors also needs to be
      considered. Accurate identification of these pain types will help in selecting
      appropriate treatment approaches. Current treatments employ a variety of
      pharmacological, surgical, physical and psychological approaches. However,
      evidence for many of the treatments in use is still limited. It is hoped that
      future research will identify effective treatment strategies that accurately
      target specific mechanisms.

TI  - When to suspect and how to monitor babesiosis.
PG  - 1969-74
AB  - In the past decade, cases of babesiosis in humans have been reported with
      increasing frequency, especially in the northeastern United States. Babesia
      microti (in the United States) and bovine strains (in Europe) cause most
      infections in humans. Most cases are tick-borne, although cases of
      transfusion-associated and transplacental/perinatal transmission have also been
      reported. Factors associated with more severe disease include advanced age,
      previous splenectomy and immunodeficient states. Symptoms include high fever,
      chills, diaphoresis, weakness, anorexia and headache. Later in the course of the 
      illness, the patient may develop jaundice. Congestive heart failure, renal
      failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome are the most common
      complications. Therapy using the combination of quinine sulfate and clindamycin
      was the most commonly used treatment; however, atovaquone suspension plus
      azithromycin was recently reported an equally effective and less toxic therapy.
      Exchange transfusion, together with antibabesial chemotherapy, may be necessary
      in critically ill patients.

TI  - New generation anti-epileptics for facial pain and headache.
PG  - 42-6
AB  - The prophylactic management of recurrent head and facial pains may be challenging
      because of lack of efficacy and/or bothersome adverse effects of available drug
      therapies. New generation antiepileptic drugs offer new perspectives in difficult
      cases. We will review the available published data and present our experience
      with lamotrigine in various head and facial pains such as migraine, cluster
      headache, neuropathic trigeminal pain, atypical facial pain, and chronic
      tension-type headache. Twenty-five patients were enrolled and followed for 18
      months. The dose was gradually increased in steps of 25 mg up to the effective
      dose (mean 250 mg/d). Lamotrigine was most effective in trigeminal neuralgia and 
      dysesthesia, but was of little utility in the other head or facial pains.

TI  - Management of chronic tension-type headache with tricyclic antidepressant
      medication, stress management therapy, and their combination: a randomized
      controlled trial.
PG  - 2208-15
AB  - CONTEXT: Chronic tension-type headaches are characterized by near-daily headaches
      and often are difficult to manage in primary practice. Behavioral and
      pharmacological therapies each appear modestly effective, but data are lacking on
      their separate and combined effects. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical efficacy
      of behavioral and pharmacological therapies, singly and combined, for chronic
      tension-type headaches. DESIGN AND SETTING: Randomized placebo-controlled trial
      conducted from August 1995 to January 1998 at 2 outpatient sites in Ohio.
      PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred three adults (mean age, 37 years; 76% women) with
      diagnosis of chronic tension-type headaches (mean, 26 headache d/mo).
      INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned to receive tricyclic
      antidepressant (amitriptyline hydrochloride, up to 100 mg/d, or nortriptyline
      hydrochloride, up to 75 mg/d) medication (n = 53), placebo (n = 48), stress
      management (eg, relaxation, cognitive coping) therapy (3 sessions and 2 telephone
      contacts) plus placebo (n = 49), or stress management therapy plus antidepressant
      medication (n = 53). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Monthly headache index scores
      calculated as the mean of pain ratings (0-10 scale) recorded by participants in a
      daily diary 4 times per day; number of days per month with at least moderate pain
      (pain rating >/=5), analgesic medication use, and Headache Disability Inventory
      scores, compared by intervention group. RESULTS: Tricyclic antidepressant
      medication and stress management therapy each produced larger reductions in
      headache activity, analgesic medication use, and headache-related disability than
      placebo, but antidepressant medication yielded more rapid improvements in
      headache activity. Combined therapy was more likely to produce clinically
      significant (>/=50%) reductions in headache index scores (64% of participants)
      than antidepressant medication (38% of participants; P =.006), stress management 
      therapy (35%; P =.003), or placebo (29%; P =.001). On other measures the combined
      therapy and its 2 component therapies produced similar outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our
      results indicate that antidepressant medication and stress management therapy are
      each modestly effective in treating chronic tension-type headaches. Combined
      therapy may improve outcome relative to monotherapy.

TI  - Pharmacological aids to locomotor training after spinal injury in the cat.
PG  - 65-74
AB  - This Topical Review summarizes some of the work we have done mainly in the cat
      using agonists and antagonists of various neurotransmitter systems injected
      intravenously or intrathecally to initiate or modulate the expression of hindlimb
      locomotion after a spinal lesion at T13. The effects of the same drugs are
      compared in various preparations: complete spinal, partial spinal or intact cats.
      This has revealed that there can be major differences in these effects. In turn, 
      this suggests that although the locomotor rhythm might normally be triggered and 
      modulated by the activation of a variety of receptors (noradrenaline, serotonin, 
      glutamate), after spinalization there appears to be a predominance of
      glutamatergic mechanisms. Recent work also suggests that, in the cat, the
      integrity of the midlumbar segments is crucial for the expression of spinal
      locomotion. Taken together, this work raises some hope that a targeted
      pharmacotherapy with better understood drugs and mode and locus of delivery could
      become a clinical reality.

TI  - The use of bupropion in the treatment of restlessness after a traumatic brain
      injury.
PG  - 463-7
AB  - The occurrence of restlessness after a traumatic brain injury (TBI) is common.
      Severe restlessness can be a barrier in the multidisciplinary treatment of
      patients with TBI. The following case describes a patient with restlessness after
      a head-on motor vehicle accident. The patient was tachycardic, diaphoretic,
      demonstrating decerebrate posturing and a Rancho Los Amigos Stage II--III.
      Significant left lower leg restlessness was severe enough to cause bruising and
      ulceration. A multidisciplinary look was taken at the effects of using different 
      neurotransmitter modulators in the treatment of restlessness after a TBI. Current
      biology treatment options include the use of medications that either modulate
      dopamine or noradrenaline alone. Bupropion effects both the dopaminergic and
      noradrenergic pathways. In the following case, the patient's restlessness was
      resistant to almost every medication employed. The only medication that proved to
      be effective in significantly reducing the patient's restlessness was bupropion. 
      The evidence for the use of bupropion in the treatment of restlessness after a
      TBI has never been discussed previously, aside from anecdotal accounts. It is
      hoped that this case will prove insight into another treatment option for
      patients who have severe restlessness.

TI  - Spinal endoscopy in chronic low back pain with radiculopathy. A prospective case 
      series.
PG  - 454-60
AB  - All 38 patients listed for day-case spinal endoscopy over a 12-month period
      (April 1998 - April 1999), who had chronic severe low back pain with a
      radiculopathic element, were studied prospectively. The mean [range] pain
      duration before treatment was 10.9 [2-26] years and 50% had failed back surgery
      syndrome. In all patients in whom treatment was completed (n = 34), the
      pain-generating nerve roots were located through symptom interaction with the
      patient. All had epidural scar tissue, 14 (41%) having dense adhesions.
      Mobilisation of adhesions around the nerve root (neuroplasty) was performed so
      that a pocket was formed for the subsequent placement of bupivacaine, Depomedrone
      and clonidine. No intra-operative complications occurred and side-effects were
      minimal. Follow-up over a 12-month period showed statistically significant
      reductions in pain scores and disability. Spinal endoscopy may be the diagnostic 
      method of choice for epidural fibrosis. It has substantial therapeutic and
      research potential. Prospective randomised studies are required.

TI  - Review of rivastigmine and its clinical applications in Alzheimer's disease and
      related disorders.
PG  - 653-66
AB  - Rivastigmine (Exelontrade mark, Novartis) is a novel intermediate-acting
      reversible and non-competitive carbamate acetylcholinesterase (AChE) that was
      recently introduced for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Preclinical
      studies have shown that rivastigmine has many similarities to other currently
      available cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) and some important differences. The
      drug has been evaluated for this use in two well designed, published, adequately 
      powered, Phase III, 26 week clinical trials that included a total of more than
      1500 rivastigmine and 700 placebo recipients. Most of these patients had
      concomitant disorders that were being treated with numerous other drugs. These
      studies indicate that rivastigmine (6 - 12 mg/day) usually produces cognitive,
      global and functional changes that indicate significantly less deterioration than
      was observed with placebo in patients with mild-to-moderate AD, with higher doses
      producing more benefits. Rivastigmine is beneficial in all three domains (namely 
      cognition, daily activities and behaviour) of AD. Data on long-term efficacy
      support continued benefits of rivastigmine beyond 6 months. Rivastigmine is
      generally well-tolerated with no requirement for routine electrocardiogram (ECG) 
      or blood monitoring. Rivastigmine causes adverse events that are generally those 
      expected from a ChEI and mainly involve gastrointestinal system. They are usually
      mild-to-moderate, of short duration and responsive to dosage reduction. They
      occur mostly during the dosage titration phase and decrease during the
      maintenance phase. Clinically significant drug-drug interactions are unlikely.
      The consistent efficacy in treating all three domains (cognition, daily
      functioning and behaviour) and good tolerability, particularly with slow
      titration, makes rivastigmine a good first-line ChEI therapy for the treatment of
      AD. Therapeutic dose range is 6 - 12 mg/day. Rivastigmine should be started at
      1.5 mg b.i.d. with meals and increased at 2 - 4 week intervals to achieve the
      highest tolerated dose.

TI  - Pharmacology and clinical experience with tiagabine.
PG  - 179-87
AB  - Tiagabine (TGB), a recently approved anti-epileptic drug (AED), has a specific
      and unique mechanism of action involving the inhibition of gamma-aminobutyric
      acid (GABA) re-uptake into neurones and glia. TGB is potent and has linear and
      predictable pharmacokinetics. It does not induce or inhibit hepatic metabolism
      and has no clinically significant effects on the serum concentrations of other
      AEDs or commonly used non-AEDs. Double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in
      primarily hepatic enzyme-induced patients showed that TGB 30 - 56 mg/day is an
      effective add-on treatment for all subtypes of partial seizures. The most common 
      adverse effects in the trials were dizziness, asthenia (weakness), somnolence,
      accidental injury, infection, headache, nausea and nervousness. These side
      effects were usually mild to moderate in severity and generally did not require
      medical intervention. Long-term safety studies show continued efficacy of TGB
      over time and no evidence of tolerance for efficacy. Open studies confirm that
      patients with medically refractory partial epilepsy can be successfully converted
      to TGB monotherapy and that TGB may be effective for other seizure types, such as
      infantile spasms.

TI  - An opioid receptor antagonist, naltrexone, does not alter taste and smell
      responses in humans.
PG  - 397-402
AB  - Several studies have shown that an opioid receptor antagonist, naltrexone,
      decreases palatable food consumption. Naltrexone has also been reported to reduce
      ethanol intake in alcohol-preferring rodents and human alcoholics. The aim of the
      present study was to assess the effects of naltrexone on taste and smell
      responses in healthy male volunteers. Naltrexone did not alter intensity and
      pleasantness of sucrose, quinine, citric acid, sodium chloride, and ethanol
      taste. Similarly, ratings of olfactory stimuli (orange extract and ethanol) and
      Coca-Cola flavor were not influenced by the opioid antagonist. Our findings may
      indicate that: (i) naltrexone exerts marginal, if any, effects on gustatory and
      olfactory responses in humans; (ii) the drug does not alter orosensory responses 
      to ethanol.

TI  - Baclofen overdose in two siblings.
PG  - 110-2
AB  - Baclofen is a muscle relaxant used in both adults and children with neuromuscular
      disorders to control spasticity. In children, relatively few cases of overdose
      have been previously reported. We report two cases of baclofen overdose occurring
      in two siblings. One sibling with cerebral palsy was being treated with baclofen 
      at the time of overdose. Both cases presented with severe respiratory depression 
      requiring mechanical ventilation. Serum baclofen concentrations from both
      children were significantly elevated. We also review the published literature on 
      baclofen overdose in children and adolescents. These cases emphasize the
      importance of warning parents about the potential toxicity of baclofen when
      prescribing the drug to a family member.

TI  - Treatment of neuromuscular and musculoskeletal problems in cerebral palsy.
PG  - 5-16
AB  - Cerebral palsy typically involves a variety of neuromuscular and musculoskeletal 
      problems. These problems include spasticity, dystonia, contractures, abnormal
      bone growth, poor balance, and loss of selective motor control. These problems
      can interfere with function and treating them can improve function. The
      treatments include physical and occupational therapy, bracing, oral medications, 
      neurolytic blocks, neurosurgical procedures, orthopaedic surgery and others.
      Using a multidisciplinary treatment team with a good understanding of cerebral
      palsy, the best treatment options can be determined and functional outcomes
      maximized.

TI  - An open-label dose-titration study of the efficacy and tolerability of tizanidine
      hydrochloride tablets in the prophylaxis of chronic daily headache.
PG  - 357-68
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess effectiveness and safety of tizanidine hydrochloride tablets
      for the prophylaxis of chronic daily headache. BACKGROUND: Tizanidine
      hydrochloride is an alpha2-adrenergic agonist that inhibits the release and
      effectiveness of norepinephrine at both central sites (eg, the locus ceruleus)
      and the spinal cord. It acts as a central muscle relaxant and has antinociceptive
      effects. Preliminary research and retrospective analyses have suggested efficacy 
      in treatment of both chronic tension-type headache and chronic daily headache
      with migrainous features. DESIGN: Thirty-nine patients with more than 15 headache
      days per month (33 with migraine, 5 migrainous, 1 chronic tension-type) completed
      a 4-week baseline, with 31 completing a planned 12 weeks of treatment with
      tizanidine. Dosing was titrated from 2 mg at bedtime to a median daily dose of 14
      mg (mean, 13.5; SD, 4.3; range, 4 to 20, divided over three doses per day) by
      treatment week 4. RESULTS: The overall headache index through week 12 (headache
      frequency x average intensity x duration) declined significantly (P<.00000002),
      with a corresponding increase in mean percentage improvement from 49% for weeks 1
      through 4, to 65% for weeks 5 through 8, and 64% for weeks 9 through 12
      (P<.0182). During weeks 9 through 12, 67% had improved more than 50% compared to 
      baseline. Overall headache frequency declined from 22.83 to 15.83 days per month 
      (P<.00001), with frequency of severe headaches dropping from 7.52 to 3.58 days
      per month (P<.000035). Average headache intensity dropped from 1.83 to 1.07
      (1-to-5 scale), peak intensity declined from 2.37 to 1.40, and mean duration was 
      reduced from 6.96 to 4.00 hours per headache (P<.00001). Improvement also
      occurred on visual analog scales of overall headache status, mood, sleep, quality
      of life (P<.00001), and sexual function (P<.0075); as well as the Beck Depression
      Inventory-II (P<.00073). Mild-to-moderate adverse events reported by more than
      10% of the patients included somnolence, asthenia, and dry mouth. Only 3 patients
      discontinued treatment due to adverse events: somnolence and dry mouth alone (n =
      1), or in combination with either hyperkinesis (n = 1) or constipation (n = 1).
      One patient had elevated liver enzymes that returned to normal after the drug was
      discontinued. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide preliminary support for the
      efficacy, safety, and tolerability of tizanidine in the prophylaxis of chronic
      daily headache.

TI  - Progressive intracranial vascular disease with strokes and seizures in a boy with
      progeria.
PG  - 212-5
AB  - Progeria, a rare genetic disorder, is characterized by severe growth failure,
      premature aging, and very early atherosclerosis with coronary artery and
      cerebrovascular disease. There has been no detailed description of progressive
      cerebrovascular changes in progeria or any attempted neurologic correlation of
      those changes. A 5-year-old boy developed signs of progeria at 4 months and
      hypertension at 4 years, treated with atenolol and dipyridamole. Left-sided
      seizures with a left hemiparesis occurred at 5 years. Magnetic resonance imaging 
      (MRI) showed bilateral acute, subacute, and chronic cerebral infarctions.
      Magnetic resonance angiography disclosed severe stenosis of the left internal
      carotid artery. The child was also found to have an aortic valve vegetation and
      was anticoagulated. He subsequently developed right-sided seizures, and treatment
      with gabapentin was started. Later, severe stenosis also of the right internal
      carotid artery was found. MRI showed new left cerebral infarction. The child's
      neurologic symptoms almost certainly were caused by cerebral infarctions from
      progressive atherosclerosis of major intracranial vessels, but
      clinical-neuroradiologic correlations were imprecise. There were multiple
      cerebral infarctions of different ages, some asymptomatic, others ipsilateral to 
      the child's neurologic findings. No therapy has halted progression of the child's
      cerebrovascular disease.

TI  - Energy requirements of spasticity.
PG  - 277-8
AB  - Direct measurement of energy expended by spasticity in children with severe
      spastic quadriparesis is difficult. Insertion of an intrathecal baclofen pump in 
      a 13-year-old boy with severe spasticity and profound mental retardation resulted
      in an estimated 30 to 40% decrease in his spasticity. As he had been on a
      carefully calculated ketogenic diet and fed by gastrostomy, his precise caloric
      intake was known. Decrease in spasticity, on the same caloric intake, led to
      marked weight gain. Reduction of 100 calories intake resulted in new weight
      stability. It was possible therefore, to estimate indirectly energy used by his
      spasticity. This 100 calories, representing 34% of calories above his resting
      energy requirement, corresponded to an independently estimated 30 to 40% of
      caloric expenditure of his spasticity. It was concluded that when calculation of 
      calories is critical, energy utilization by spasticity must be taken into
      consideration.

TI  - Preventive therapy in pediatric migraine.
PG  - 71-8
AB  - Preventive therapy for migraine headache includes identification of migraine
      precipitants, possible adjustments in lifestyle, appropriate management of acute 
      headache, and, when necessary, the use of pharmacologic agents. There are no
      well-controlled clinical trials with sufficient patient numbers to support the
      use of any agent in the prevention of migraine headache in children. Data on the 
      use of amitriptyline and divalproex sodium in open-label studies suggest that
      these agents may be efficacious. The mechanism of action for these agents is
      unknown but may be related to the 5-hydroxytyptamine-2 (5-HT2) receptor
      antagonism or regulation of ion channels. A review of the pertinent literature on
      migraine prophylaxis in children is presented. Dosing guidelines are presented
      based on the limited data available and clinical experience.

TI  - Novel treatments for bipolar disorder.
PG  - 661-71
AB  - Treatments other than lithium have recently emerged as equally important in the
      management of bipolar disorder. The spectrum of efficacy of newer treatments
      differs from lithium and among the novel drug treatments valproate, generally
      used as the better tolerated divalproex form, principally benefits manic
      symptomatology both acutely and in prophylaxis. Atypical antipsychotic drugs have
      demonstrated efficacy in reducing acute manic symptoms. No controlled evidence of
      efficacy in prophylaxis has been published. Lamotrigine has demonstrated efficacy
      in both acute bipolar depression and maintenance efficacy in rapid cycling
      bipolar patients, especially those patients with bipolar II disorder, which is
      principally manifested as depression. Randomised, double-blind, placebo-
      controlled studies provide good evidence that regimens of risperidone or
      olanzapine in combination with lithium or valproate provide greater improvement
      in acute mania than the mood stabilisers alone. Similarly, valproate combined
      with antipsychotics provided greater improvement in mania than antipsychotic
      medication alone and resulted in lower dosage of the antipsychotic medication. A 
      positive but unclear placebo-controlled study of omega-3 fatty acids added to
      lithium in bipolar disorder needs confirmation in standard clinical trial
      paradigms. Several other drugs that were reported as beneficial in various facets
      of bipolar disorder in open trials have not differed from placebo when studied in
      randomised, placebo-controlled trials.

TI  - Management of chronic daily headache utilizing a uniform treatment pathway.
PG  - 650-3
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if the use of a uniform treatment pathway might be
      effective in treating patients with primary chronic daily headache. METHODS:
      Thirty-three consecutive patients with primary chronic daily headache were
      managed according to a treatment pathway which involved sequential administration
      of divalproex sodium, amitriptyline, amitriptyline plus phenelzine, or methadone.
      RESULTS: Twenty-two patients (67%) reported a 50% or greater reduction in
      headache days per month following initiation of treatment. Most positive
      treatment responses (17 [77%] of 22) were attributed to divalproex sodium.
      CONCLUSION: Implementation of a uniform treatment pathway may result in
      significant clinical improvement in a sizable proportion of patients with chronic
      daily headache.

TI  - Neuroleptic malignant-like syndrome after abrupt withdrawal of baclofen.
PG  - 61-3
AB  - We present the case of a 36-year-old man who presented with a clinically
      neuroleptic malignant-like syndrome involving disorientation, signs of autonomic 
      dysfunction, rigidity and raised total creatine kinase level, but in the absence 
      of any neuroleptic medication. He had, however, abruptly stopped taking his
      long-term baclofen in the days prior to presentation. He improved markedly after 
      the reintroduction of baclofen, and we postulate that his clinical syndrome
      resulted from the sudden withdrawal of this drug. We concur with the concept that
      neuroleptic malignant syndrome represents a spectrum of disorders, and add it to 
      the list of possible sequelae after abrupt withdrawal of baclofen.

TI  - Intrathecal baclofen in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy.
PG  - 156-8
AB  - X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder
      involving the destruction of white matter in the brain and adrenocortical hormone
      deficiency. Clinical symptoms first appear between 4 and 8 years of age and
      include spasticity, visual loss, dysphagia, and seizures. In this report,
      continuous infusion of intrathecal baclofen was used to treat the severe
      spasticity of an 8-year-old patient with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. The
      improvement in this patient's quality of life, including the elimination of pain 
      and the increased ease of care, suggests that intrathecal baclofen should be
      considered as part of the treatment strategy for spasticity associated with
      X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and other neurodegenerative disorders in children
      and adults.

TI  - Oral gabapentin (neurontin) treatment of refractory genitourinary tract pain.
PG  - 47-9
AB  - PURPOSE: Refractory genitourinary pain is a common but difficult condition to
      treat. Examples of chronic genitourinary pain include orchalgia, interstitial
      cystitis, pain after bladder suspension surgery, nonbacterial prostatitis, and
      genital pain related to lumbosacral neuropathy. We report our experience with
      oral gabapentin treatment for this condition. Gabapentin is an anticonvulsant
      with unclear but therapeutic effects on neurologic pain. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Twenty-one patients referred with refractory genitourinary pain were treated with
      oral gabapentin. There were 9 men and 12 women. In the male patients, the
      location of pain was testicle (4), bladder (2), penis (1), or prostate (2). In
      female patients, the pain was located in the urethra (4), bladder (6), vulva (1),
      or vagina (1). The dose of gabapentin was titrated from 300 up to 2,100 mg/day.
      Subjective pain severity and 10-cm visual pain scale was used before and 6 months
      after therapy. RESULTS: The mean dose of gabapentin was 1,200 mg/day (range
      300-2,100 mg). Ten of 21 patients reported subjective improvement of their pain. 
      The remaining patients did not perceive any improvement. Gabapentin was well
      tolerated; only 4 patients dropped out due to side effects. The most common
      adverse effects were dizziness and drowsiness. Five of 8 patients with
      interstitial cystitis reported improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Although only 10 of 21
      patients improved with gabapentin, this cohort included only patients with
      refractory genitourinary pain that failed a wide range of prior treatments.
      Gabapentin belongs in the armaterium of the urologist who treats genitourinary
      pain.

TI  - A posterior tibial nerve neurilemoma unrecognized for 10 years: case report.
PG  - 668-72
AB  - OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Neoplasms of peripheral nerves can be obscured,
      especially during the early phase. The author reports a patient with a posterior 
      tibial nerve neurilemoma (schwannoma). For a decade, the tumor was misdiagnosed
      as nonspecific S1 radiculopathy and psychogenic chronic pain syndrome. The
      patient's presentation and initial management are unique. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: 
      A 40-year-old woman reported severe left foot and calf pain, numbness, and
      weakness. The symptoms were evident during three pregnancies, and they gradually 
      progressed. The neuropathic pain was protracted, despite implantation of a dorsal
      column stimulator and administration of a wide variety of medications and
      therapies. The symptoms were unresponsive to both inpatient and outpatient
      treatments, which resulted in a misdiagnosis of psychogenic pain for more than a 
      decade. Diagnostic scans obtained by computed tomography, ultrasonography, and
      nuclear scintigraphy confirmed a popliteal fossa mass. INTERVENTION: A high,
      large posterior tibial nerve neurilemoma was found intraoperatively, positioned
      just below the sciatic nerve bifurcation with extensive degenerative features and
      hemorrhages. Surgical resection provided immediate recovery. CONCLUSION:
      Peripheral nerve tumors are rarely acknowledged clinical entities. Chronic
      unexplained foot and calf pain and a positive Tinel's sign should raise suspicion
      of posterior tibial nerve neurilemoma. Even in patients who have had such tumors 
      for a decade, surgical resection remains the treatment of choice.

TI  - Epileptic and non-epileptic seizures in multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 2-9
AB  - Knowledge concerning the relationship between multiple sclerosis and epilepsy is 
      reviewed. Epidemiological studies have established that epileptic seizures are
      more frequent in multiple sclerosis than predicted by chance. Partial epilepsies 
      with focal seizures often with atypical symptoms and with or without secondary
      generalisation are the usual pattern. In the survey special emphasis is laid on
      the direct correlation between paroxysmal phenomena and plaques now demonstrable 
      by modern imaging techniques. These images have shown that epileptic seizures can
      be caused by cortical and subcortical lesions and by their accompanying oedema.
      We extend the review to non-epileptic paroxysmal symptoms, such as tonic spasm,
      which may be confused with epileptic seizures. As far as they are supported by
      data, recommendations for diagnosis and therapy are given. Open questions are
      identified and issues for further research are suggested.

TI  - Ketoconazole in bipolar patients with depressive symptoms: a case series and
      literature review.
PG  - 23-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data from several studies suggest that medications, such as
      ketoconazole, which lower cortisol levels, may be effective for major depressive 
      disorder (MDD). As with MDD, the manic, depressive, and mixed phases of bipolar
      disorder are frequently associated with elevated cortisol levels. The literature 
      on the use of cortisol-lowering strategies in mood disorders is reviewed, and a
      case series illustrating the use of ketoconazole in bipolar depression is
      presented. METHODS: For the review, the MEDLINE and PSYCHINFO databases were
      searched, as were the bibliographies of pertinent articles to find papers on the 
      use of cortisol-lowering agents in patients with mood disorders. In our
      open-label case series (n = 6), ketoconazole (up to 800 mg/day) as an add-on
      therapy was given to patients with treatment-resistant or intolerant bipolar I or
      II disorders with current symptoms of depression. RESULTS: Several case reports
      and small open studies suggest that cortisol-lowering agents may be useful for
      patients with depression. Two recent placebo-controlled trials of ketoconazole on
      patients with MDD report conflicting results. In our case series, all three
      patients who received a dose of at least 400 mg/day had substantial reductions in
      depressive symptoms. None had significant increases in mania. However, cortisol
      levels were not lowered in any of the subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The literature
      suggests that cortisol-lowering medications may be effective for a subset of
      depressed patients. Our preliminary findings suggest that ketoconazole may be
      useful in some patients with bipolar depression. Larger clinical trials are
      needed to confirm our observations.

TI  - Topical anesthesia for cataract surgery: a population-based perspective.
PG  - 445-51
AB  - PURPOSE: To analyze the anesthetic regimen and sedation in a population-based
      cohort of unselected cataract surgery cases operated on with the goal of
      maximizing the percentage of patients with topical anesthesia and no sedation.
      SETTING: Department of Ophthalmology, Norrlands University Hospital, Umea,
      Sweden. METHODS: This prospective observational population-based study comprised 
      all patients having cataract surgery during a 1 year period at 1 institution.
      Data were collected from the patients' records, which were standardized. Outcome 
      measures were use of preoperative sedation, type of anesthesia, intraoperative
      complications, and adverse events. RESULTS: The study comprised 890 cases
      performed by 4 surgeons. Seventy-two percent of patients had no sedation and
      topical anesthesia only. All patients except 1 who had previous cataract surgery 
      with topical anesthesia chose the same method for their second-eye surgery. The
      rate of posterior capsule rupture was in the expected range for a population with
      high incidences of pseudoexfoliation and mature cataract. CONCLUSIONS: It is
      possible to achieve a high percentage of effective topical anesthesia for
      cataract surgery in a population-based setting. The findings have implications
      for cost-containment in health services.

      comparative pilot study.
PG  - 178-82
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of amitriptyline and sudden analgesic withdrawal
      on headache frequency and quality of life in patients suffering from chronic
      daily headache related to analgesics abuse. METHODS: Seventeen nondepressed
      patients with chronic drug-induced headache were included in a 9-week,
      parallel-group, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. After abrupt 
      analgesic withdrawal, amitriptyline or an active placebo (trihexyphenidyl) was
      started. The primary efficacy variable was headache frequency recorded on a
      headache diary in the last 4 weeks of each treatment. The secondary efficacy
      variable was quality of life (Nottingham Health Profile). RESULTS: Headache
      frequency decreased by 45% in the amitriptyline group and by 28% in the
      trihexyphenidyl group. Amitriptyline enhanced all the dimensions of quality of
      life and significantly improved emotional reaction and social isolation.
      CONCLUSION: This pilot study suggests a beneficial effect of amitriptyline on
      headache frequency and quality of life for patients with chronic drug-induced
      headache.

TI  - Efficacy of gabapentin in migraine prophylaxis.
PG  - 119-28
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare gabapentin with placebo for use as a prophylactic agent in 
      patients with migraine (with or without aura). STUDY DESIGN AND TREATMENT: After 
      screening, a 4-week, single-blind, placebo baseline period was followed by a
      12-week, double-blind, treatment period. The 12-week treatment period consisted
      of a 4-week titration phase and an 8-week stable-dosing phase. During the 4-week 
      titration phase, patients were started on one 300-mg capsule of gabapentin or
      matching placebo. Patients were titrated weekly from 900 mg/day (end of week 1)
      to 2400 mg/day (end of week 4) and had to be receiving a stable dose of study
      medication by the end of the titration period. Study medication was to be given
      on a three-times-a-day dosing regimen. METHODS: The study hypothesis was defined 
      a priori as a lower 4-week migraine rate during the second stabilization period
      for the gabapentin-treated patients as compared with the placebo-treated
      patients. The analyses were performed with the 4-week migraine rate at baseline
      as a covariate and center as a blocking factor. RESULTS: At seven participating
      centers, 143 patients with migraine were randomized in a 2:1 ratio and received
      either gabapentin (n = 98) or matching placebo (n = 45). Thirty-three patients
      (24.1%) discontinued prematurely from the study, including 24 (24.5%) of 98
      gabapentin-treated patients and 9 (20.0%) of 45 placebo-treated patients; the
      majority of patients discontinued due to adverse events (16 [16.3%] of 98
      gabapentin-treated patients; 4 [8.9%] of 45 placebo-treated patients). Patients
      included in the analysis were evenly balanced for age, sex, race, weight, and
      height. The majority of these patients were white (80 [92.0%] of 87) and women
      (72 [82.8%] of 87), with a mean age of approximately 39.4 years and a history of 
      migraine episodes for a mean of about 21 years. At the end of the 12-week
      treatment phase, the median 4-week migraine rate was 2.7 for the
      gabapentin-treated patients maintained on a stable dose of 2400 mg/day and 3.5
      for the placebo-treated patients (P =.006), compared with 4.2 and 4.1,
      respectively, during the baseline period. Additionally, 26 (46.4%) of 56 patients
      receiving a stable dose of 2400 mg/day gabapentin and 5 (16.1%) of 31 patients
      receiving placebo showed at least a 50% reduction in the 4-week migraine rate (P 
      =.008). The average number of days per 4 weeks with migraine was also
      statistically significant and favored gabapentin (P =.006) during stabilization
      period 2. The median change in 4-week headache rate was statistically significant
      as well (P =.013). The most frequently reported adverse events for both treatment
      groups were asthenia, dizziness, somnolence, and infection. Adverse events
      determined by the investigator to be associated with study drug resulted in
      patient withdrawal in 13 (13.3%) of 98 gabapentin-treated patients and 3 (6.7%)
      of 45 placebo-treated patients. Somnolence and dizziness accounted for many of
      the premature withdrawals among those taking gabapentin. CONCLUSION: Gabapentin
      is an effective prophylactic agent for patients with migraine. In addition,
      gabapentin appears generally well tolerated with mild to moderate somnolence and 
      dizziness.

TI  - Pain in nursing home residents: management strategies.
PG  - 13-29
AB  - Pain is prevalent and undertreated in nursing home residents, despite the
      existing wide array of effective pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment
      modalities. In order to improve the quality of life of these vulnerable
      individuals, practitioners require education about the correct approach to
      assessment and management. Assessment should be comprehensive, taking into
      account the basic underlying pathology (e.g. osteoarthritis, osteoporosis,
      peripheral neuropathy, fibromyalgia, cancer) as well as other contributory
      pathology (e.g. muscle spasm, myofascial pain) and modifying comorbidities (e.g. 
      depression, anxiety, fear, sleep disturbance). Pharmacological management should 
      be guided by a stepped-care approach, modelled after that recommended by the
      World Health Organization for treatment of cancer pain. Nonopioid and opioid
      analgesics are the cornerstone of pharmacological pain management. Tricyclic
      antidepressants and anticonvulsants can be very effective for the treatment of
      certain types of neuropathic pain. In addition to treating the pain per se,
      attention should be given to prevention of disease progression and exacerbation, 
      as maintaining function is of prime importance. Nursing home residents with
      severe dementia challenge the practitioner's pain assessment skills; an empirical
      approach to treatment may sometimes be warranted. The success of treatment should
      be measured by improvement in pain intensity as well as physical, psychosocial
      and cognitive function. Effective pain management may impact any or all of these 
      functional domains and, therefore, substantially improve the nursing home
      resident's quality of life.

TI  - Pseudo-TORCH syndrome or Baraitser-Reardon syndrome: diagnostic criteria.
PG  - 18-23
AB  - Intracranial calcification and microcephaly, which represent the main clinical
      features of the TORCH-syndrome, can also be determined by a rare autosomal
      recessive infection-like condition named pseudo-TORCH syndrome. This emerging
      entity has been registered in eight families so far. We report on five patients
      from three unrelated Italian families affected by pseudo-TORCH syndrome.
      Reevaluation of literature allowed us to draw a specific clinical profile of the 
      syndrome. Indeed, congenital microcephaly, congenital cerebral calcification,
      spasticity and seizures are the main clinical features, and have been present in 
      almost all patients reported so far. On the contrary, findings resembling
      congenital infectious diseases including neonatal icterus, hyperbilirubinemia,
      thrombocytopenia, and hepatomegaly, affect less than half of the patients.
      Considering the diagnosis of pseudo-TORCH syndrome in patients with neonatal
      microcephaly and cerebral calcification is necessary since an early diagnosis may
      allow adequate genetic counseling to the families.

TI  - Clinical utility of botulinum toxin in the treatment of cerebral palsy:
      comprehensive review.
PG  - 37-46
AB  - The physical properties, mechanism of action, and clinical evidence supporting
      the use of botulinum toxin in the management of spasticity in cerebral palsy are 
      discussed. Assessment methods, patient selection criteria, and methodology for
      preparation and administration of botulinum toxin are discussed in detail and a
      treatment algorithm based on the cumulative experience of the author is provided.
      Botulinum toxin type A is well tolerated, safe, and effective in the treatment of
      patients with spastic cerebral palsy. Appropriate patient selection is
      imperative. Treatment goals need to be well defined and tailored to the
      individual patient's needs. Growth and development is a continuous and evolving
      process, necessitating the constant reassessment of the patient and modification 
      of future treatment goals. The ultimate success of management in cerebral palsy
      is dependent on the development of a comprehensive spasticity team with
      complementing skills who, together, can significantly improve the quality of life
      of these patients.

TI  - Pharmacotherapy of spasticity: oral medications and intrathecal baclofen.
PG  - 31-6
AB  - Spasticity is a common problem in children with neurologic impairment,
      particularly in those with cerebral palsy. Clinicians commonly make use of oral
      medications to attempt to reduce spasticity and increase function. Little has
      been published in the literature concerning the use of these medications in
      children and their effects on both muscle tone and function. This article is a
      review of the sites of action, side effects, and efficacy of benzodiazepines,
      baclofen, dantrolene sodium, alpha2-adrenergic agonists, and gabapentin. A brief 
      review of intrathecal baclofen is included as well.

PG  - 16-23
AB  - Recent developments in therapeutic interventions for children with spasticity
      have complicated managerial decision making. A simplified paradigm for the
      pathophysiology of spasticity is presented, which emphasizes the ways in which
      treatment modalities disrupt hyperexcitable segmental spinal reflex arcs. Various
      techniques for the management of spasticity are reviewed, along with factors
      relevant to proper patient selection for therapeutic intervention. Potential
      goals for spasticity management are considered as are outcome measures for
      assessing the efficacy of these technologies.

AB  - The ultimate goal for management of patients with cerebral palsy is to help them 
      grow up to become as independent as possible, learn to make their own choices in 
      life, and pursue their own dreams. Optimal mobility is crucial to achieving
      independence and is also necessary for better health and quality of life in these
      patients. This article discusses the treatment of spasticity in cerebral palsy,
      addresses tone management issues in relationship to mobility and physical
      fitness, and introduces the reader to a comprehensive approach to the management 
      of patients with cerebral palsy.

TI  - Quinine induced coagulopathy--a near fatal experience.
PG  - 282-4
AB  - A 67 year old man presented to his local dentist for restorative treatment. He
      stated he was fit and well and denied taking any medications. When he was given
      an inferior alveolar nerve block, excessive bleeding was noted at the injection
      site and the dentist advised the patient see an oral and maxillofacial surgeon.
      An appointment was made for the patient but he did not attend. Three days later, 
      he presented with evidence of massive deep haemorrhage to the point of airway
      compromise. He underwent hospital admission, early intubation, intensive care for
      nine days and hospitalization for six weeks. The cause of his bleeding was a
      severe thrombocytopoaenia, induced by chronic ingestion of quinine. He was
      self-medicating with this to relieve muscular cramps. Despite this experience,
      the patient continued to deny that quinine was the cause of his problem and that 
      he had failed in his obligations to advise the dentist of his drug history.
      Dentists need to be alert to the risk that patients may not reveal their true
      medical history. There are, however, obligations on the dentist to ensure the
      accuracy of information the patient gives and to ensure that patients whom they
      believe are at risk follow their advice. Teamwork and skillful airway management 
      prevented this patient's demise.

TI  - Factors associated with sleep apnea in men with spinal cord injury: a
      population-based case-control study.
PG  - 15-22
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize a population of spinal cord injury (SCI) patients with
      sleep apnea, and to determine associated factors and comorbidities. STUDY DESIGN:
      Population-based retrospective case-control study. SUBJECTS: 584 male patients
      served by a Veterans Affairs SCI service. MEASURES: Medical records were reviewed
      for sleep apnea diagnosis, demographic information, neurologic characteristics,
      and treatments received. Sleep study reports were not available to determine the 
      nature of abnormal respiratory events (ie central, obstructive, hypoventilation).
      For each case with tetraplegia, a control tetraplegic subject without sleep apnea
      diagnosis was selected. RESULTS: We identified 53 subjects with diagnosed sleep
      apnea: 42 tetraplegic, 11 paraplegic. This represented 14.9% of all tetraplegic
      and 3.7% of all paraplegic patients in the population (P<0.0001 for comparison of
      tetraplegic and paraplegic proportions). In tetraplegic subjects, sleep apnea was
      associated with obesity and more rostral motor level, but not with ASIA
      Impairment Scale. Medical comorbidities associated with sleep apnea in non-SCI
      patients, such as hypertension, were more common in case subjects. Less than half
      of case subjects were receiving some form of treatment. For motor-complete
      tetraplegics, long-term positive airway pressure treatment was less common with
      motor level C5 and above compared to C6 and below. CONCLUSION: In this
      population, sleep apnea has been frequently diagnosed, particularly in
      tetraplegic subjects. The true prevalence is likely to be considerably higher,
      since this study considered only previously diagnosed cases. Sleep apnea was
      associated with obesity and higher neurologic level, but not ASIA Impairment
      Scale. Medical comorbidities were more frequent in this group, and treatment
      acceptance was poor with higher level motor-complete injuries. Since the type of 
      sleep apnea (central or obstructive) was not distinguished, we cannot comment on 
      the prevalence and associations based on specific types of sleep apnea.

TI  - Sildenafil citrate: a therapeutic update.
PG  - 2-23
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since its approval by the US Food and Drug Administration in March
      1998, sildenafil citrate has been used by millions of men for the treatment of
      erectile dysfunction. Recent studies and consensus reports have expanded our
      understanding of its efficacy, safety, contraindications, and drug interactions. 
      OBJECTIVE: This paper reviews recent studies of the efficacy of sildenafil, its
      adverse effects and drug interactions, and socioeconomic factors involved in its 
      use, with a focus on specific patient populations (prostate cancer, diabetes
      mellitus, ischemic heart disease, spinal cord injuries, neurologic disorders).
      METHODS: Clinical studies, case reports, and commentaries and editorials
      concerning sildenafil published in the international literature between January
      1999 and August 2000 were identified through searches of MEDLINE, PREMEDLINE, and
      International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, using the terms sildenafil, Viagra, and
      erectile dysfunction. RESULTS: Sildenafil has demonstrated effectiveness in men
      with erectile dysfunction associated with prostatectomy, radiation therapy,
      diabetes mellitus, certain neurologic disorders, and drug therapy (eg, selective 
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]). It has not been as effective in women
      with sexual dysfunction, with the exception of SSRI-associated sexual
      dysfunction. Some disorders unrelated to sexual dysfunction (eg, esophageal
      motility dysfunction) may also respond to sildenafil. In the general population, 
      sildenafil is considered to have an acceptable tolerability profile; however,
      patients with moderate to severe cardiovascular disease or those taking nitrate
      therapy are at increased risk for potentially serious cardiovascular adverse
      effects with sildenafil therapy. In addition, patients taking drugs that inhibit 
      the cytochrome P450 3A4 isozyme, which metabolizes sildenafil, may experience
      increased drug concentrations and possible toxicity from normal doses of
      sildenafil. CONCLUSIONS: Sildenafil is an effective first-line therapy for
      erectile dysfunction in men. The decision to prescribe this agent should include 
      such considerations as the cost-risk-benefit balance, patient access, drug
      distribution pathways, and prescription drug coverage.

TI  - Conservative management of low back pain.
PG  - 21-31
AB  - Back pain is prevalent worldwide, but back pain disability has reached epidemic
      proportions in many industrialised societies. Few patients have serious medical
      pathology or direct neurological involvement requiring surgery. Although the
      causes remain unclear, physical stress and its consequences on discs, facet
      joints and supporting soft tissues at work or leisure are important, sometimes
      aggravated by adverse psychosocial factors. Modern management emphasises the role
      of self-care, beginning in primary care with the first episode. Without root
      compression, bed rest should not exceed 48 hours. Emphasis is on encouraging a
      rapid return to physical fitness and other activities, including employment,
      acknowledging that returning to a normal life may require working through pain.
      Medication facilitates this. No one should remain in pain beyond six weeks
      without being referred to a specialist service for a physical and psychosocial
      assessment by appropriately trained professionals and with consultant support for
      investigation, pain management and rehabilitation when needed.

TI  - R3 nociceptive reflex in multiple sclerosis patients with paroxysmal symptoms
      treated with gabapentin.
PG  - 205-9
AB  - Gabapentin (GBP) is a new, well-tolerated antiepileptic drug found to be
      effective for painful paroxysmal symptoms (PS) in multiple sclerosis (MS). The
      aim of this study was to obtain a neurophysiological evaluation of the effects of
      GBP on the nociceptive system of MS patients suffering PS. We studied 10 MS
      patients, 6 males, 4 females (mean age 47.3 years), suffering PS (3 had
      trigeminal neuralgia, 1 painful tonic spasms and 6 dysesthetic or paresthetic
      symptoms). Three patients were, at the same time, also being treated with
      carbamazepine. Pain was evaluated by means of the Visual Faces Scale. R3
      nociceptive reflex was recorded after 2 weeks' treatment. R3 thresholds and
      latencies were evaluated and a statistical analysis was performed. A significant 
      variation was found in R3 thresholds between the values recorded before and
      during GBP treatment; no significant variation was observed in R3 latencies.

TI  - Who is using cannabis as a medicine and why: an exploratory study.
PG  - 435-43
AB  - This article reports on an exploratory study of medical cannabis users.
      Interviews were completed with 50 self-identified medical cannabis users
      recruited through notices in newspapers and on bulletin boards. They reported
      using cannabis for a variety of conditions including HIV-AIDS-related problems,
      chronic pain, depression, anxiety, menstrual cramps, migraine, narcotic addiction
      as well as everyday aches, pains, stresses and sleeping difficulties. A majority 
      also used cannabis for recreational purposes, and many were longer-term cannabis 
      users. However, there were some notable exceptions. Almost all smoked cannabis
      and many did so two to three times a day. Few admitted negative experiences with 
      cannabis, although some problems evident to the researchers were not clearly
      admitted. Those who told their doctors about their medical cannabis use found
      doctors noncommittal or supportive. The results raise questions about the
      definition of medical cannabis use and about policies that might be developed to 
      accommodate such use. Limitations of the study are noted and further research
      suggested. Research priorities include population surveys, studies involving
      larger, more representative samples of medical cannabis users and studies of
      medical cannabis use among people with HIV-AIDS.

TI  - Choice and use of newer anticonvulsant drugs in older patients.
PG  - 441-52
AB  - Epilepsy is common in the elderly. The incidence of epilepsy is age-dependent,
      with a peak during the first year of life and higher incidence in those older
      than 75 years. Cerebrovascular disease is a common cause of epilepsy in the
      elderly. Drug treatment of the elderly is a challenge because of pharmacokinetic 
      changes with aging, including impaired drug protein binding or displacement of
      drug from protein binding sites, potentially causing drug toxicity as a result of
      increased free drug concentrations. With aging, hepatic mass and blood flow
      decline along with renal function. Established anticonvulsant drugs have adverse 
      effects and drug interactions that can make treating the elderly difficult. Newly
      available anticonvulsants cause fewer drug-drug interactions and less toxicity.
      Gabapentin is not metabolised, is not bound to protein, and has a favourable
      adverse effect profile and thus may be useful in the treatment of elderly
      patients. Lamotrigine reduced seizures between 20 and 30% in trials. Dose
      response was between 300mg per day and 500mg per day. This drug was well
      tolerated in open-label trials. Rash occurred in younger patients. Oxcarbazepine 
      is rapidly absorbed and is converted to a monohydroxy derivative. Use with
      hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs necessitates an increase in dose. This drug may be 
      substituted for carbamazepine. Hyponatraemia has been reported and monitoring is 
      suggested. Topiramate blocks voltage-dependent sustained repetitive firing and
      has an effect on the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors. It affects
      glutamate responses and inhibits carbonic anhydrase. Topiramate has a dose
      response pattern up to 400mg per day. Cognitive effects limits its use in some
      patients. Nephrolithiasis has occurred with this drug. Tiagabine blocks GABA
      transporter proteins. Clearance is rapid and metabolism complete. Hepatic
      dysfunction prolongs clearance. The use of tiagabine has not been reported in the
      elderly. Zonisamide is rapidly absorbed and protein binding is 50%. Plasma
      half-life is 55 hours but is reduced to about 30 hours by hepatic enzyme-inducing
      drugs. Responder rate is 45%. Adverse effects include drowsiness, altered
      thinking and nephrolithiasis. Treatment of the elderly requires obligatory
      polypharmacy with potential drug interactions. Changes in body physiology alter
      absorption, binding, metabolism and elimination of drugs. Concomitant illness and
      sensitivity to drug effects narrow the therapeutic range and complicate
      pharmacokinetics in elderly patients. Newer anticonvulsant drugs have advantages 
      that may outweigh risks and have therapeutic profiles that may aid in the
      treatment of this special population of patients.

TI  - A preliminary study of bupropion sustained-release for smoking cessation in
      patients with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder.
PG  - 94-8
AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of bupropion sustained-release
      (SR) on smoking cessation in patients with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder 
      (PTSD). Fifteen veterans with chronic PTSD who desired to stop smoking enrolled
      in a 12-week double-blind evaluation of bupropion SR and placebo. Patients were
      randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either bupropion SR or placebo.
      Bupropion SR was initiated at 150 mg daily for 3 or 4 days and increased to a
      final dose of 150 mg twice daily (300 mg daily total). Ten patients received
      bupropion SR and five received placebo. Nine of the patients who received
      bupropion SR were already being treated with at least one other psychotropic
      medication. One of the ten patients did not complete the study because of
      medication side effects. Eighty percent of patients receiving bupropion SR
      successfully stopped smoking by the end of week 2, and 6 (60%) of these 10
      maintained smoking cessation at the study endpoint (week 12). At the 6-month
      follow-up, 40% of the patients (4 of 10) who received bupropion SR maintained
      smoking cessation. One (20%) of the five patients who received placebo stopped
      smoking and maintained smoking cessation at the 6-month follow-up. Bupropion SR
      was generally well-tolerated in combination with other psychotropic medications. 
      Bupropion SR may be effective in helping patients who desire to quit smoking and 
      who also have a concomitant anxiety disorder, such as PTSD.

TI  - Altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics in children with severe, acute traumatic brain
      injury.
PG  - 1452-61
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine if phenytoin protein binding and
      metabolism were altered in prepubescent pediatric patients within the first 10
      days following severe, acute traumatic brain injury. Patients (n = 10) received
      phenytoin loading doses (15-20 mg/kg) followed by a maintenance regimen (7
      mg/kg/day) initiated within 12 hours of the loading dose. Phenytoin serum
      concentrations were measured serially on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 10 at 1, 6,
      and 12 hours. Time-invariant and time-variant Michaelis-Menten pharmacokinetic
      models were fit to the unbound phenytoin concentration-time data (ADAPT II).
      Albumin concentrations significantly decreased over time (p < 0.001) and were
      predictive of the phenytoin binding ratio (r2 = 0.373, p < 0.0001). The
      time-variant model provided a superior fit of the data in 7 patients with no
      difference between models in 3 patients. Rapid inhibition of metabolism
      (Vmaxbaseline = 2.82 +/- 2.35 mg/kg/day) was observed initially following injury.
      This was followed by induction of metabolism as reflected by a Vmaxinduced of
      20.79 +/- 13.71 mg/kg/day, which was approximately twofold higher than reported
      values for nonstressed children. Children with severe, acute neurotrauma were
      found to have markedly altered protein binding and phenytoin metabolism.

TI  - Pain management in older adults: prevention and treatment.
PG  - 188-99
AB  - The release of guidelines in 1998 by the American Geriatrics Society on "The
      Management of Chronic Pain in Older Persons" was a breakthrough in helping to
      manage pain in this population. Already advances have fostered a need to update
      recommendations. This article focuses on the treatment strategies available for
      seniors that are likely to help to fulfill the obligation to relieve pain and
      suffering in patients. A review was done of the literature using Medline and
      other search techniques. New pain scales have been developed with seniors in mind
      and greater testing of older scales in elderly populations have helped to
      identify measures of pain more suited to frail seniors. Advances in
      cyclooxygenase inhibition selectivity, alternative medicine, and progress in the 
      identification of nonopioid pain receptors and the development of products to
      target them are just a few of changes that have altered the way clinicians think 
      about treating pain. The use of hospice in end-of-life palliative care is a
      valuable resource for clinicians managing pain at that phase in care as well.
      Tools are available to prevent and treat pain successfully in seniors. Educating 
      clinicians about available assessment tools, techniques and interventions may be 
      the biggest challenge to comforting the older adult in pain.

TI  - Mefloquine chemoprophylaxis in Chinese railway workers on contract in Nigeria.
PG  - 116-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nonimmune Chinese nationals on a 2-year railway contract job were
      commenced on mefloquine (MQ) chemoprophylaxis 20 weeks after arrival in Nigeria. 
      The objective of the study was to determine the usefulness of mefloquine (MQ)
      (despite the delay in starting) and its tolerability in this group. METHODS:
      Ninety-one workers (89 males, 2 females) were commenced on weekly MQ 250 mg doses
      for 17 weeks. Most of the subjects were followed up to 16 weeks after cessation
      of chemoprophylaxis. The morbidity pattern before, during, and after cessation of
      chemoprophylaxis was compared. RESULTS: Of the 91 workers included in the study, 
      89 were evaluable. Three (3.37%) of these developed clinical illness during the
      17-week period of chemoprophylaxis. This protection was highly significant when
      compared to 23 of 91 people (25.27%) who developed clinical illness before
      chemoprophylaxis was commenced (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.04-0.43, p <.001). The risk of 
      developing acute malaria increased more than three times, among 84 members of the
      group who were followed up to 16 weeks after MQ was discontinued (RR 3.18, 95% CI
      0.89-11.34). Two subjects withdrew after the second dose due to adverse
      reactions, however the remaining 89 subjects tolerated the drug for the 16-week
      period. CONCLUSIONS: Mefloquine significantly reduced malaria morbidity in the
      study group. Pretravel counseling and advice is important in preventing
      unnecessary deaths and morbidity in nonimmune travelers to malarious areas.

TI  - Characterization of chronic pain and somatosensory function in spinal cord injury
      subjects.
PG  - 253-63
AB  - The pathophysiology of the chronic pain following spinal cord injury (SCI) is
      unclear. In order to study it's underlying mechanism we characterized the
      neurological profile of SCI subjects with (SCIP) and without (SCINP) chronic
      pain. Characterization comprised of thermal threshold testing for warmth, cold
      and heat pain and tactile sensibility testing of touch, graphesthesia and
      identification of speed of movement of touch stimuli on the skin. In addition,
      spontaneously painful areas were mapped in SCIP and evoked pathological
      pain--allodynia, hyperpathia and wind-up pain evaluated for both groups. Both
      SCIP and SCINP showed similar reductions in both thermal and tactile sensations. 
      In both groups thermal sensations were significantly more impaired than tactile
      sensations. Chronic pain was present only in skin areas below the lesion with
      impaired or absent temperature and heat-pain sensibilities. Conversely, all the
      thermally impaired skin areas in SCIP were painful while painfree areas in the
      same subjects were normal. In contrast, chronic pain could be found in skin areas
      without any impairment in tactile sensibilities. Allodynia could only be elicited
      in SCIP and a significantly higher incidence of pathologically evoked pain (i.e. 
      hyperpathia and wind-up pain) was seen in the chronic pain areas compared to
      SCINP. We conclude that damage to the spinothalamic tract (STT) is a necessary
      condition for the occurrence of chronic pain following SCI. However, STT lesion
      is not a sufficient condition since it could also be found in SCINP. The abnormal
      evoked pain seen in SCIP is probably due to neuronal hyperexcitability in these
      subjects. The fact that apparently identical sensory impairments manifest as
      chronic pain and hyperexcitability in one subject but not in another implies that
      either genetic predisposition or subtle differences in the nature of spinal
      injury determine the emergence of chronic pain following SCI.

TI  - Babesiosis.
PG  - 21-4
AB  - A case of human babesiosis is presented. This case emphasizes the need to
      consider tick-borne disease in anyone who presents with prolonged and undulating 
      fevers, chills, headache, myalgias, and arthralgias. This holds true particularly
      in areas endemic for tick-borne diseases, even in the absence of a history of
      tick bite. These symptoms, associated with signs of intravascular hemolysis,
      thrombocytopenia, and renal insufficiency in a patient who resides in, or with
      recent travel to, the Northeastern United States, strongly suggest a diagnosis of
      babesiosis.

AB  - Several psychotropic and neurotropic agents are useful in treating patients with 
      skin diseases such as obsessive compulsive skin manipulation, delusions of
      parasitosis, generalized pruritus, and post-herpetic neuralgia. The mechanism of 
      action of these agents is based on their interaction with central and peripheral 
      neuronal receptors. The medications discussed in this article include the
      tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, naltrexone, pimozide,
      and gabapentin. The pharmacology, mechanism of action, adverse effects, drug
      interactions, and monitoring guidelines are outlined for each of these drugs.

PG  - 321-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review is to examine the accumulating evidence
      indicating that lamotrigine is effective in the treatment of neuropathic pain.
      METHOD: A review of the available literature. RESULTS: Neuropathic pain is a
      debilitating series of conditions that are often poorly controlled. The molecular
      action of lamotrigine in terms of its effects in preclinical models of pain and
      hyperalgesia are considered along with the accumulating evidence suggesting that 
      lamotrigine may be effective in the clinical management of neuropathic pain.
      CONCLUSION: A review of the literature suggests that lamotrigine may be effective
      in the management of neuropathic pain.

TI  - New avenues in treatment of paediatric migraine: a review of the literature.
PG  - 101-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Headaches are a common problem in paediatric practice. Recurrent
      headaches can be a significant source of stress for patient and parents, and
      disruptive regarding school obligations and parental work responsibilities. Most 
      treatment interventions are developed from research data extrapolated from adult 
      studies, with resultant concerns of safety and efficacy when utilizing these
      therapeutic conclusions in children. METHODS: This paper incorporates current
      treatment strategies in paediatric migraine utilizing a Medline search of English
      language studies from January 1988 to December 1999, with a literature search
      referencing the terms of paediatrics, migraines, headaches, therapy and
      treatment. Reference sections of the articles were reviewed for pertinent
      information prior to January 1988. Articles were evaluated systematically to
      formulate concise terms for diagnosis of paediatric migraine and applicability to
      clinical treatment studies. Particular emphasis was placed on newer options with 
      relevance in adult treatment such as triptans and anti-epileptic drugs, and their
      benefit in therapy of paediatric migraine. Non-pharmacological options were also 
      subjected to organized review to determine relevance in treatment of paediatric
      migraine. RESULTS: The review of the literature indicates that although migraine 
      in childhood and adolescence appears to be increasing in prevalence, few clinical
      studies are available, with most current treatment recommendations utilizing data
      from adult studies. CONCLUSION: Further headache treatment studies in the
      paediatric population are necessary in order to ascertain safety and efficacy of 
      pharmaco-therapeutics in these children. Also, much current interest in treatment
      in adults with recurrent headaches involves non-pharmacological areas-dietary
      modification and stress management. Application of these avenues especially
      warrants further clarification with regard to relevance in paediatric migraine
      treatment.

TI  - Hypnic headache: another indomethacin-responsive headache syndrome?
PG  - 830-5
AB  - Hypnic headache syndrome is a benign, recurrent, late-onset headache disorder
      that occurs exclusively during sleep. Lithium has been reported to be an
      effective treatment, but the side effects of this medication are sometimes
      prohibitive, particularly in the elderly. Other drugs have been reported to be
      effective in this disorder, including caffeine, flunarizine, and verapamil.
      Recently, indomethacin has been reported to effectively suppress hypnic
      headaches. We report the response of seven patients with hypnic headache who were
      treated with indomethacin. Hypnic headache syndrome appears to represent yet
      another headache disorder in which there is sometimes an impressive response to
      indomethacin.

TI  - Anticonvulsants for neuropathic pain syndromes: mechanisms of action and place in
      therapy.
PG  - 1029-52
AB  - Neuropathic pain, a form of chronic pain caused by injury to or disease of the
      peripheral or central nervous system, is a formidable therapeutic challenge to
      clinicians because it does not respond well to traditional pain therapies. Our
      knowledge about the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain has grown significantly over
      last 2 decades. Basic research with animal and human models of neuropathic pain
      has shown that a number of pathophysiological and biochemical changes take place 
      in the nervous system as a result of an insult. This property of the nervous
      system to adapt morphologically and functionally to external stimuli is known as 
      neuroplasticity and plays a crucial role in the onset and maintenance of pain
      symptoms. Many similarities between the pathophysiological phenomena observed in 
      some epilepsy models and in neuropathic pain models justify the rational for use 
      of anticonvulsant drugs in the symptomatic management of neuropathic pain
      disorders. Carbamazepine, the first anticonvulsant studied in clinical trials,
      probably alleviates pain by decreasing conductance in Na+ channels and inhibiting
      ectopic discharges. Results from clinical trials have been positive in the
      treatment of trigeminal neuralgia, painful diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic
      neuralgia. The availability of newer anticonvulsants tested in higher quality
      clinical trials has marked a new era in the treatment of neuropathic pain.
      Gabapentin has the most clearly demonstrated analgesic effect for the treatment
      of neuropathic pain, specifically for treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy
      and postherpetic neuralgia. Based on the positive results of these studies and
      its favourable adverse effect profile, gabapentin should be considered the first 
      choice of therapy for neuropathic pain. Evidence for the efficacy of phenytoin as
      an antinociceptive agent is, at best, weak to modest. Lamotrigine has good
      potential to modulate and control neuropathic pain, as shown in 2 controlled
      clinical trials, although another randomised trial showed no effect. There is
      potential for phenobarbital, clonazepam, valproic acid, topiramate, pregabalin
      and tiagabine to have antihyperalgesic and antinociceptive activities based on
      result in animal models of neuropathic pain, but the efficacy of these drugs in
      the treatment of human neuropathic pain has not yet been fully determined in
      clinical trials. The role of anticonvulsant drugs in the treatment of neuropathic
      pain is evolving and has been clearly demonstrated with gabapentin and
      carbamazepine. Further advances in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying
      neuropathic pain syndromes and well-designed clinical trials should further the
      opportunities to establish the role of anticonvulsants in the treatment of
      neuropathic pain.

TI  - Withdrawal therapy improves chronic daily headache associated with long-term
      misuse of headache medication: a retrospective study.
PG  - 658-62
AB  - Chronic daily headache (CDH) associated with long-term misuse of headache
      medication is a common clinical problem which is refractory to most treatments.
      The present study is a retrospective analysis of the effect of drug withdrawal
      therapy in patients with CDH and frequent long-term use of headache symptomatic
      medication. One hundred and one adult patients (74 women and 27 men, aged between
      16 and 72 years, mean age 43 years) were evaluated 1-3 months after drug
      withdrawal therapy had been initiated. The mean headache frequency at baseline
      was 26.9+/-4.0 days per month. Fifty-seven (56%) patients were significantly
      improved (defined as at least 50% reduction in number of headache days) after a
      period of drug withdrawal therapy. Based on the outcome of the drug withdrawal
      therapy, the patients were divided into three categories: group I, those who had 
      between 0 and 10 headache days per month (n = 41), group II, those who had 11-20 
      days (n = 37), and group III, those who had 21-30 days (n = 23). The mean
      headache frequencies in groups I, II and III were 5.6+/-2.8 days, 15.7+/-2.5 days
      and 28.7+/-2.4 days, respectively. Treatment with amitriptyline was offered to
      patients in whom no improvement had been achieved. Ten of those 22 patients (36%)
      experienced a significant (> or = 50%) reduction of headache days. It is
      concluded that out-patient drug withdrawal therapy is the treatment of choice in 
      patients with CDH and frequent long-term use of headache symptomatic medication, 
      and that about one quarter of these CDH patients do not respond to drug
      withdrawal therapy only.

TI  - Chronic pain after spinal cord injury: a survey of practice in spinal injury
      units in the USA.
PG  - 658-60
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the current practice regarding assessment and management 
      of patients with chronic pain after spinal cord injury (SCI) in the United States
      of America (USA). METHODS: A postal questionnaire sent to the medical directors
      of 12 spinal injury units in the USA. RESULTS: A response was received from eight
      of the 12 units. Chronic pain was considered a significant problem amongst
      patients with SCI. There was inconsistency of opinion regarding prevalence
      estimates, investigation and management of chronic pain after SCI; but
      classification systems for pain were remarkably similar amongst units. Most felt 
      that there was a need for further information, although only one unit said it was
      presently conducting research into the subject. CONCLUSION: Our survey has
      demonstrated the uncertainty that exists amongst USA specialists dealing with
      pain after SCI, and strengthens the case for more research into the subject with 
      a view to developing guidelines for care.

TI  - Adjunctive gabapentin treatment of bipolar disorder.
PG  - 433-7
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to analyze the effectiveness of
      gabapentin administration to bipolar patients who had an incomplete response to
      other mood stabilizers. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty-two RDC bipolar 1 and II
      patients were assessed by means of the SADS and entered if they gave their
      consent to participate. All them had suffered from frequent relapses,
      subsyndromal features (mostly depressive) and incomplete response to other drugs.
      They all received open-label increasing doses of gabapentin until clinical
      response. The patients were assessed through the CGI-BP and a specific
      questionnaire at baseline and at 12 weeks of follow-up. RESULTS: Six out of the
      22 patients dropped out for various reasons (four because of relapse, one because
      of side effects and one more because of poor compliance). Eight of the 16
      patients that completed the 12-week follow-up showed at least two stages of
      improvement in the CGI. Using the last observation-carried forward analysis, the 
      improvement was statistically significant for the depression subscale, and
      apparently related to social functioning, irritability and anxiety. Only one
      patient dropped out because of intolerance (mild rash). The mean dose of
      gabapentin was 1,310 mg/day. CONCLUSION: Gabapentin may be a useful drug for the 
      add-on treatment of bipolar patients with poor response to other mood
      stabilizers. Gabapentin may improve depressive residual symptoms such as
      irritability, social withdrawal or anxiety. These results should be confirmed in 
      randomized clinical trials.

TI  - Clinical experience with pantoprazole in gastroesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 1169-85; discussion 1149-50
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pantoprazole is a new proton pump inhibitor indicated for the
      treatment of erosive esophagitis associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease 
      (GERD) and is available in both oral and intravenous (IV) formulations.
      OBJECTIVE: This paper reviews the pharmacologic properties of pantoprazole and
      summarizes the findings from clinical studies of this drug. METHODS: This review 
      was compiled from the published literature, abstracts from clinical trials, and
      data on file with the manufacturer of pantoprazole. RESULTS: Pantoprazole
      selectively accumulates in the acidic environment of gastric parietal cells and
      acts at the final step of acid secretion by binding 2 key cysteine residues of
      the proton pump involved in gastric acid production. The bioavailability of
      pantoprazole is not altered by concomitant administration of food or antacids or 
      with repeated dosing. Both oral and IV formulations of pantoprazole exhibit
      linear pharmacokinetics. Several clinical trials have proved pantoprazole
      superior to histamine-2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) in reducing acid secretion
      and elevating gastric pH levels. Pantoprazole has been shown to be more effective
      than ranitidine (P < 0.05), famotidine (P < 0.001), and nizatidine (P < 0.05),
      and at least as effective as omeprazole, in healing erosive esophagitis and
      relieving associated symptoms of GERD, including regurgitation. Pantoprazole is
      also more effective than the H2RA nizatidine for the treatment of nighttime
      heartburn (P < 0.05). Studies have shown pantoprazole to be well tolerated;
      adverse events, including headache, diarrhea, flatulence, abdominal pain,
      eructation, nausea, and rash, occurred in < or = 6% of patients. The oral and IV 
      formulations of pantoprazole are equally potent in inhibiting gastric acid
      secretion; thus, switching between formulations requires no dosage adjustments.
      Special patient populations, including the elderly and patients with renal or
      mild to moderate hepatic impairment, can take pantoprazole without an adjustment 
      in dosage. CONCLUSIONS: Because of its unique pharmacokinetic properties,
      mechanism of action, and reduced potential for producing cytochrome P-450-based
      drug interactions, pantoprazole in both oral and IV formulations is effective
      over a full 24 hours and is well tolerated in a variety of patient types.

TI  - New-onset tic disorder following acute hemorrhage of an arteriovenous
      malformation.
PG  - 769-71
AB  - The etiology of tic disorder includes idiopathic, postencephalitic, head injury, 
      carbon monoxide poisoning, stroke, and developmental syndromes. We report a case 
      of new-onset complex motor and vocal tics that began after hemorrhage of an
      arteriovenous malformation located in the left frontal lobe. We have found no
      reported cases of new-onset tics related to arteriovenous malformations or
      hemorrhage into the frontal lobes. The patient is a 16-year-old
      right-hand-dominant boy who presented with generalized tonic-clonic seizures.
      Evaluation, including magnetic resonance imaging, revealed a left frontal
      arteriovenous malformation, confirmed by angiogram. Following resection, there
      was an intraparenchymal hemorrhage of the left frontal lobe with intraventricular
      hemorrhage, noted most prominently in the left lateral and IIIrd ventricles, and 
      a subdural hematoma caudal to the craniotomy. The postoperative course was
      complicated by hemiparesis and global aphasia. During recovery, the patient
      developed what was thought to be a complex partial seizure evidenced by head
      turning to the right with vocalization and left upper extremity clonic jerks.
      These were brief and occurred multiple times per day. A trial of carbamazepine
      was given with no improvement. It was noted that the spells occurred more
      frequently under stress, as when the patient was frustrated with communication.
      The diagnosis was changed to complex motor tics and the therapy changed to
      clonidine. The tics subsequently improved by 80%, although they were still
      present. We believe the development of complex motor tics due to frontal
      hemorrhage represents a unique etiology and could complicate postsurgical
      recovery in similar cases.

TI  - Internal globus pallidotomy in dystonia secondary to Huntington's disease.
PG  - 1248-51
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND METHOD: The prototypic motor feature of Huntington's disease
      (HD) is chorea, but parkinsonism and involuntary movements such as dystonia and
      myoclonus can also be present. Pallidotomy has been shown to be an effective
      treatment for medically refractory Parkinson's disease (PD). We performed
      bilateral microelectrode guided-stereotactic pallidotomies targeted at globus
      pallidum internus (GPi) to treat a 13-year-old patient diagnosed with Westphal
      variant of HD with intractable generalized dystonia and parkinsonism. RESULTS:
      Intraoperative microelectrode recordings of GPi cells showed a relatively low
      firing rate, 29 +/- 14 Hz, with most neurons showing pauses. Acutely, after
      surgery, limb dystonia mildly improved but trunk dystonia persisted.
      Postoperative follow up 3 months later showed minimal clinical improvement in
      dystonic features with marked worsening of spasticity. CONCLUSION: In our case,
      bilateral pallidotomy produced modest palliative functional improvement in
      dystonic features. Cellular firing patterns were markedly different than in PD
      and were similar to those found in dystonia.

TI  - Intrathecal baclofen for dystonia: benefits and complications during six years of
      experience.
PG  - 1242-7
AB  - Fourteen patients with primary or secondary dystonia received intrathecal
      baclofen (ITB) through an implanted pump following a trial dose. Patients were
      selected for ITB trial if they had clinically unsatisfactory responses to oral
      antidystonic medications, including oral baclofen. Patients were rated using the 
      Burke-Fahn-Marsden rating scale by a blinded rater after the dose of ITB was
      optimized. Five patients experienced improvement in symptoms as determined by a
      change in rating scale scores, although only two had a clear clinical benefit.
      Etiology of dystonia did not determine the efficacy of ITB therapy, as benefit or
      failure was seen in both primary and secondary dystonia.

TI  - Markedly severe dystonia in Japanese encephalitis.
PG  - 1168-72
AB  - Encephalitis has been reported to be a rare cause of severe dystonia. We describe
      five patients with markedly severe dystonia from Japanese encephalitis. These
      patients with markedly severe dystonia were seen during the past 8 years as a
      subgroup of 50 patients with Japanese encephalitis. The diagnosis of markedly
      severe dystonia was based on increasingly frequent episodes of generalized
      dystonia with bulbar, respiratory, or metabolic derangement or leading to
      exhaustion or pain. The diagnosis of JE was based on clinicoradiologic features
      and a fourfold increase of hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody titers in paired 
      serum. The outcome of the patients was defined as a good, partial, or poor
      recovery on the basis of 1-year clinical status. All the patients were males, and
      their ages ranged from 6 to 19 years. Movement disorders appeared 1 to 3 weeks
      after the illness as the level of consciousness started improving. During the
      next 1 to 4 weeks, patients began to experience markedly severe dystonia. It was 
      associated with marked axial dystonia resulting in opisthotonus and retrocollis
      in five patients, jaw-opening dystonia in two patients, teeth clenching in one
      patient, and oculogyric crisis and neck deviation in another patient. The attacks
      of markedly severe dystonia lasted for 2 to 30 minutes and occurred as many as 20
      to 30 times daily. Other developments included fixed limb dystonia in one
      patient, severe spasticity and rigidity in five patients, and focal muscle
      wasting in one patient. These patients had only a modest improvement after
      treatment. Markedly severe dystonia abated by 2 to 6 months in all the patients
      who were followed up. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging showed bilateral
      thalamic involvement in all patients, brainstem involvement in three patients,
      and basal ganglia involvement in two patients. At the 3-month follow-up, all
      patients had a poor outcome. At 1 year, one patient had a complete recovery; one 
      had a partial recovery; and two were bedridden. It can be concluded that markedly
      severe dystonia is an important and serious sequela of Japanese encephalitis and 
      may occur as the result of thalamus, midbrain, or basal ganglia involvement in
      various combinations.

TI  - The efficacy of intrathecal morphine and clonidine in the treatment of pain after
      spinal cord injury.
PG  - 1493-8
AB  - We performed a double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial in 15 patients to
      determine the efficacy of intrathecal morphine or clonidine, alone or combined,
      in the treatment of neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury. The combination of
      morphine and clonidine produced significantly more pain relief than placebo 4 h
      after administration; either morphine or clonidine alone did not produce as much 
      pain relief. In addition, lumbar and cervical cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
      concentrations, sampled at these levels at different times after administration
      were examined for a relationship between pain relief and CSF drug concentration. 
      Lumbar CSF drug concentrations were initially several orders of magnitude larger 
      than those in cervical CSF. After 1-2 h, the concentrations of morphine in
      cervical CSF markedly exceeded those of clonidine. The concentration of morphine 
      in the cervical CSF and the degree of pain relief correlated significantly. We
      conclude that intrathecal administration of a mixture of clonidine and morphine
      is more effective than either drug administered alone and is related to the
      CSF-borne drug concentration above the level of spinal cord injury. If there is
      pathology that may restrict CSF flow, consideration should be given to
      intrathecal administration above the level of spinal cord damage to provide an
      adequate drug concentration in this region.

TI  - Polysomnography in hypnic headache syndrome.
PG  - 748-52
AB  - Hyponic headache syndrome is an unusual chronic headache that usually begins
      after age 60 years and occurs exclusively during sleep. Despite the relationship 
      between the headache and sleep, no formal sleep evaluation with overnight
      polysomnography has been reported for this syndrome. Three patients with
      long-standing hypnic headache underwent overnight polysomnography. The results
      were quite variable, ranging from normal to marked sleep insufficiency. A hypnic 
      headache was captured in one patient arising out of rapid eye movement sleep at a
      time of severe oxygen desaturation. Formal sleep evaluation should be considered 
      in patients with hypnic headache because there may be pathophysiologic and
      therapeutic implications.

TI  - Novel drug development for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
PG  - 21-8
AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has become an increasingly attractive area
      for the pharmaceutical industry, the most experimentally tractable of the
      neurodegenerative diseases. Mechanisms underlying cell death in ALS are likely to
      be important in more common but more complex disorders. Riluzole, the only drug
      launched for treatment ALS is currently undergoing industrial trials for
      Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington disease, stroke and head injury. Other
      compounds in Phase III testing for ALS (mecamserin, xaliproden, gabapentin) are
      also in trials for other neurodegenerative disorders. Mechanisms of action of
      these advanced compounds are limited to glutamate antagonism, direct or indirect 
      growth factor activity, as well as GABA agonism and interaction with calcium
      channels. A broader range of mechanisms is represented by compounds in Phase I
      trials: glutamate antagonism (dextramethorphan/p450 inhibitor; talampanel),
      growth factors (leukemia inhibiting factor; IL-1 receptor; encapsulated cells
      secreting CNTF) and antioxidants (TR500, a glutathione-repleting agent;
      recombinant superoxide dismutase; procysteine.) An even broader range of
      mechanisms is being explored in preclinical discovery programs. Recognition of
      the difficulties associated with delivery of protein therapeutics to the CNS has 
      led to development of small molecules interacting either with neurotrophin
      receptors or with downstream intracellular signalling pathways. Other novel drug 
      targets include caspaces, protein kinases and other molecules influencing
      apoptosis. High-throughput screens of large libraries of small molecules yield
      lead compounds that are subsequently optimized by chemists, screened for
      toxicity, and validated before a candidate is selected for clinical trials. The
      net is cast wide in early discovery efforts, only about 1% of which result in
      useful drugs at the end of a decade-long process. Successful discovery and
      development of novel drugs will increasingly depend on collaborative efforts
      between the academy and industry.

TI  - Psychotropic interactions with warfarin.
PG  - 250-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Improving knowledge about the cytochrome p450 system means that
      potential drug interactions can be predicted. Interactions involving warfarin may
      be thus avoidable. As many patients who have suffered from a stroke or other
      thromboembolic events may also develop psychiatric disorder, knowledge about
      possible interactions with psychotropics is essential for prescribers. METHOD: A 
      Medline and hand search of published literature was complemented by contacting
      manufacturers. RESULTS: The antidepressants citalopram, nefazodone and sertraline
      have relatively low interaction potential with warfarin; fluoxetine and
      fluvoxamine relatively high. Carbamazepine appears to reduce warfarin's
      anticoagulant effect. Other antipsychotics, antidepressants and anxiolytics have 
      only a theoretical risk of interaction. Lithium, gabapentin, sulpiride and
      amisulpride are predominantly renally excreted and so are not likely to interact 
      with warfarin. CONCLUSION: Many psychotropics are involved in predictable
      interactions with warfarin. Drugs with a known low interaction potential should
      be chosen instead of those known or predicted to interact.

TI  - Levetiracetam. A review of its adjunctive use in the management of partial onset 
      seizures.
PG  - 871-93
AB  - Levetiracetam, the S-enantiomer of alpha-ethyl-2-oxo-1-pyrollidine acetamide, is 
      approved for use as adjunctive therapy in adult patients with partial onset
      seizures. Oral levetiracetam 1000, 2000 and 3000 mg/day administered as
      adjunctive therapy for up to 18 weeks significantly increased responder rates and
      reduced seizure frequency compared with placebo in 3 well designed pivotal trials
      in adults with treatment-refractory partial seizures with or without secondary
      generalisation. Levetiracetam 3000 mg/day also significantly increased the number
      of seizure-free patients, but the effects of levetiracetam 1000 and 2000 mg/day
      on this end-point were unclear. Effects on seizure severity were not assessed in 
      these trials. Although not yet approved as monotherapy or for use in paediatric
      patients, efficacy was observed with levetiracetam 3000 mg/day as monotherapy in 
      adult patients with refractory partial seizures with or without secondary
      generalisation and with the 10 to 40 mg/kg/day dosage as adjunctive therapy in
      children with refractory partial seizures. However, these data are limited. Oral 
      levetiracetam 1000, 2000 and 3000 mg/day as adjunctive therapy is generally well 
      tolerated with an overall incidence of adverse events similar to that observed
      with placebo. The most commonly reported events in individual clinical trials
      were CNS-related and included somnolence, asthenia, headache and dizziness.
      Levetiracetam administered as adjunctive therapy does not appear to interact with
      other anticonvulsant drugs, and no clinically relevant interactions were observed
      between levetiracetam and digoxin, warfarin or probenecid; oral contraceptive
      protective efficacy was also not affected by levetiracetam. CONCLUSIONS:
      Levetiracetam is a new anticonvulsant agent with a favourable tolerability
      profile and a low potential for drug interactions. It has shown efficacy as
      adjunctive therapy in patients with treatment-refractory partial onset seizures
      with or without secondary generalisation in clinical trials. Direct comparative
      trials with other anticonvulsant agents are not yet available, but
      placebo-controlled clinical evidence to date suggests that levetiracetam (1000,
      2000 and 3000 mg/day) is a useful option as adjunctive therapy in patients with
      this subtype of epilepsy.

TI  - Intrathecal baclofen pump use for spasticity: a clinical survey.
PG  - 536-41
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To obtain information from continuous intrathecal baclofen infusion
      (CIBI) pump centers regarding specific clinical practices and experiences.
      METHODS: A total of 115 centers were surveyed by mail. RESULTS: Forty centers
      (35%) responded with information about 1,002 test doses and 936 pump placements. 
      Patient diagnoses included cerebral palsy, spinal cord injury, traumatic brain
      injury, and others. The average test dose was 50 microg. A total of 87% of trials
      were successful. The most common test dose complications were nausea/vomiting
      (2.6%) and sedation (2.2%). Pump placement complications included cerebrospinal
      fluid (CSF) collection (3.3%), constipation (2.9%), headache (2.4%), and CSF leak
      (2.2%). The most common long-term complications were catheter kink or migration
      (4%) and infection (1.2%). Improved daily activities including easier diapering, 
      dressing, transfers, orthotic wear and comfort, and sitting tolerance were
      reported in the majority (>90%) of patients. Mixed results were reported for oral
      motor function and head, bladder, and bowel control. CONCLUSIONS: CIBI is an
      effective treatment for severe spasticity, with dramatic quality-of-life
      improvements and a small number of significant complications. Long-term benefits 
      and complications need to be monitored in this complex population.

TI  - Amitriptyline reduces myofascial tenderness in patients with chronic tension-type
      headache.
PG  - 603-10
AB  - The tricyclic anti-depressant amitriptyline is widely used in the treatment of
      chronic tension-type headache. The aim of the present study was to investigate
      whether the analgesic effect is caused by a reduction of muscle pain or by a
      general reduction of pain sensitivity. Thirty-three non-depressed patients with
      chronic tension-type headache were treated with amitriptyline 75 mg/day and with 
      the highly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram 20 mg/day in a
      32-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-way crossover study. At the end 
      of each treatment period, actual headache intensity and pericranial myofascial
      tenderness were recorded, pressure pain detection and tolerance thresholds were
      measured in the finger and in the temporal region and the electrical pain
      threshold was measured at the labial commissure. Amitriptyline reduced tenderness
      and headache intensity significantly more than placebo (P=0.01 and P=0.04,
      respectively). The reduction in tenderness could be ascribed solely to the group 
      of patients who responded to amitriptyline treatment by at least 30% reduction in
      headache while tenderness was unchanged in non-responders. Amitriptyline did not 
      affect pressure or electrical pain thresholds at any of the examined locations.
      Citalopram had no significant effect on any of the examined parameters. These
      findings indicate that amitriptyline elicits its analgesic effect in chronic
      myofascial pain by reducing the transmission of painful stimuli from myofascial
      tissues rather than by reducing overall pain sensitivity. We suggest that this
      effect is caused by a segmental reduction of central sensitization in combination
      with a peripheral anti-nociceptive action.

TI  - [Comparison of 0.125% bupivacaine and 0.2% ropivacaine in obstetric analgesia].
PG  - 643-8
AB  - This comparative study of low doses of ropivacaine was conducted in order to
      identify the most effective form of analgesia during labour with the aid of
      supplementary low doses of fentanyl and clonidine. 60 ASA I and II parturient
      primipares who had asked for epidural analgesia were randomly assigned to two
      groups. Group R was given 5-7 ml 0.2% ropivacaine and Group B 0.125% bupivacaine 
      with both groups receiving 75 ng clonidine and 50 ng fentanyl with their first
      bolus of local anaesthetic. The parameters measured included the speed and spread
      of the sensory blockade and the scale of any motor blockade. The material
      haemodynamics and VAS pain relief scores were also measured at 30-minute
      intervals during labour and all side-effects (nausea, vomiting, localised or
      generalised itching, headache etc) were also monitored. Apgar anaesthetics and
      other drugs was decided on the basis of the VAS score (a further dose was given
      to women with a VAS of > 3-4). The study was completed by a telephone interview 6
      months after delivery and the data were analysed using the Student's t-test and
      the chi 2 test. The analgesic effect was satisfactory in both groups and no
      statistically significant differences were found between the two groups under
      most of the headings analysed, apart from the top-up doses needed to maintain
      adequate analgesia. The average time between the first VAS to parturition was 292
      mns in Group B and 267 mns in Groups R. Top-up doses of local anaesthetic (2.35
      vs 5.05) came on average to 15.8 ml in Group B compared to 24.1 ml in Group R.
      There were 20% Caesarian sections in Group R and 13.8% in Group B. Optimum
      analgesia was achieved in Group R, the level of analgesia was insufficient or
      barely sufficient in 3.3% of cases. There was no Apgar score < 7 in either group.
      It was therefore concluded that both bupivacaine and ropivacaine offer excellent 
      analgesia during labour and have no significant side effects on mothers or
      babies.

TI  - Diazepam treatment to increase the cerebral GABAergic activity in acute stroke: a
      feasibility study in 104 patients.
PG  - 437-40
AB  - In preparation of a trial on the neuroprotective effect of GABAergic activation
      by a benzodiazepine, we performed a feasibility study in 104 patients with acute 
      (less than 24 h) stroke. 5 mg diazepam twice daily for 5 days (n = 44) was well
      tolerated, feasible, and appeared to be safe. Testing a dose of 10 mg twice daily
      for 5 days (n = 17) was stopped early because of drowsiness around day 5,
      interfering with regular patient care. A dose of 10 mg twice daily for 3 days was
      well tolerated, despite reported drowsiness in 12 of 43 patients. First-dose
      application by rectiole was feasible in 97% of the 104 patients. No blood
      pressure drop or respiratory arrest or insufficiency were detected, whereas the
      2-week case fatality rate was similar to that of controls matched for age, sex,
      and stroke severity. We conclude that testing the GABAergic activity during the
      acute phase of stroke by 10 mg diazepam twice daily for 3 days is well tolerated 
      and practically feasible, and it does not subject patients to an increased risk
      of potential serious adverse effects. Preparations for a large randomized trial
      are in a final stage.

TI  - Amitriptyline treatment of chronic pain in patients with temporomandibular
      disorders.
PG  - 834-41
AB  - Randomized clinical trials of amitriptyline will require data from pilot studies 
      to be used for sample size estimates, but such data are lacking. This study
      investigated the 6-week and 1-year effectiveness of low dose amitriptyline (10-30
      mg) for the treatment of patients with chronic temporomandibular disorder (TMD)
      pain. Based on clinical examination, patients were divided into two groups:
      myofascial and mixed (myofascial and temporomandibular joint disorders). Baseline
      pain was assessed by a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain intensity and by the 
      McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ). Depression was assessed by the Beck Depression
      Inventory (BDI) short form. Patient assessment of global treatment effectiveness 
      was obtained after 6 weeks and 1 year of treatment by using a five-point ordinal 
      scale: (1) worse, (2) unchanged, (3) minimally improved, (4) moderately improved,
      (5) markedly improved. The results showed a significant reduction for all pain
      scores after 6 weeks and 1 year post-treatment. The depression scores changed in 
      depressed but not in non-depressed patients. Global treatment effectiveness
      showed significant improvement 6 weeks and 1 year post-treatment. However, pain
      and global treatment effectiveness were less improved at 1 year than at 6 weeks.

TI  - An evaluation of intrathecal ziconotide for the treatment of chronic pain.
PG  - 2403-10
AB  - Ziconotide, the synthetic form of cone snail peptide pi-conotoxin MVIIA, is a
      neurone-specific N-type calcium channel blocker with an analgesic and
      neuroprotective effect. Intrathecal ziconotide has been recommended for approval 
      by the FDA for the management of chronic pain. Spinally administered ziconotide
      produces analgesia by blocking neurotransmitter release from primary nociceptive 
      afferents and prevents the propagation of pain signals to the brain. It has an
      advantage over intrathecal morphine in that there is no development of tolerance 
      after prolonged use. Systemic toxicity is considerably reduced by administration 
      of smaller doses intrathecally and selective delivery to the site of action in
      the nervous system. Nevertheless, there are neurological adverse effects due to
      delay in clearance of ziconotide from the neural tissues. Overall, ziconotide has
      a favourable risk/benefit ratio with advantages over several currently available 
      intrathecal therapies for pain.

TI  - Zaleplon - a review of a novel sedative hypnotic used in the treatment of
      insomnia.
PG  - 841-58
AB  - Zaleplon (N-[3-(3-cyanopyrazolo[1,5-a] pyrimidin-7-yl) phenyl]-N-ethyl acetamide)
      is a non-benzodiazepine recently introduced for clinical use. This agent is
      indicated for the short-term treatment of insomnia. Preclinical studies have
      shown that the benzodiazepines triazolam and Ro17-1812 can substitute for
      zaleplon in animals trained to distinguish zaleplon from saline. The
      benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil can antagonise the discriminative stimulus
      effect of zaleplon. These findings suggest that zaleplon is recognised by animals
      as a benzodiazepine agent. Zaleplon is active after ip. and oral administration
      in a variety of motor performance tests, including locomotor activity, rotarod
      and the loaded grid. Zaleplon has been shown to be active in a number of
      different anticonvulsant models, including the pentylenetetrazole, isoniazid and 
      electroshock models. The compound is also reported to be active against
      convulsions induced by bicuculline, picrotoxin and strychnine. Studies in
      anxiolytic models suggest that zaleplon may have weak anxiolytic activity. From
      preclinical studies, it appears zaleplon possesses a reduced risk of tolerance
      compared to triazolam, is less likely to potentiate the effects of ethanol and is
      unlikely to produce amnestic effects. In man, zaleplon is rapidly absorbed and
      undergoes extensive presystemic metabolism. The compound has a plasma half-life
      of approximately one hour and is metabolised primarily via the aldehyde oxidase
      system to form 5-oxo-zaleplon. This metabolite, along with other minor
      metabolites formed in vivo, do not appear to contribute to the activity of
      zaleplon. Metabolites of zaleplon are excreted primarily via the urine. Phase I
      studies suggest that single daytime doses of zaleplon up to 15 mg are
      well-tolerated. Short-term impairment of performance occurs when zaleplon is
      administered during the day at doses epsilon 20 mg. However, given the short
      half-life of the compound, significant impairment of daytime performance is
      unlikely if zaleplon is administered at bedtime or shortly after retiring for the
      evening. Results from Phase II/III studies suggest that zaleplon (5 - 20 mg)
      produces a dose-dependent reduction in sleep latency in patients suffering from
      primary insomnia. The clinical efficacy of zaleplon persists for at least four
      weeks at doses of 10 mg and 20 mg. Studies in patients with a history of drug
      abuse suggest that the abuse potential of zaleplon (at doses above the
      therapeutic dose range) is similar to that seen with the benzodiazepine
      triazolam.

AB  - We report a case of stroke in a child with acquired protein C deficiency
      receiving valproic acid (VPA). To investigate the possible association of VPA
      with protein C deficiency, protein C levels were measured in 20 children

TI  - Body packer: cocaine intoxication, causing death, masked by concomitant
      administration of major tranquilizers.
PG  - 555-8
AB  - Cocaine, derived from the leaves of the shrub Erythroxylon coca, which grows on
      the slopes of the Andes, remains one of the most widely abused illicit drugs
      (Johnson et al., 1993). Its abuse appears to be increasing and as a result, so is
      its trafficking across borders, with ever-increasing sophistication of
      concealment (Rouse, 1992). Over the past few years, cases of cocaine intoxication
      have been reported, resulting from ruptured packets of cocaine that have been
      swallowed, or inserted into the vagina or rectum by couriers (drug smugglers), so
      called 'body packers' or 'mules' (Westli and Mittleman, 1981; Ricaurte and
      Langston, 1995). Cocaine is a powerful sympathomimetic and central nervous system
      stimulant, an overdose of which causes primarily cardiac, neurological and
      psychiatric effects (Ricaurte and Langston, 1995). Acute toxicity is dose-related
      and is characterized in the first place by its sympathomimetic effects, which
      include tachycardia, hypertension and hyperthermia arrythmias, followed by
      seizures. Brainstem depression and cardio-respiratory collapse, stroke, coma,
      intracranial vasculitis, myocardial infarction and sudden death have all been
      reported in cocaine abuse (Ricaurte and Langston, 1995). We present a fatal case 
      with neurological and psychiatric symptoms, but without the usual cardiac and
      systemic signs.

TI  - Epilepsy and antiepileptic drug therapy in juvenile neuronal ceroid
      lipofuscinosis.
PG  - 1296-302
AB  - PURPOSE: To survey the characteristics of epilepsy in patients with juvenile
      neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (JNCL) and determine the antiepileptic drug (AED) 
      treatment most suitable for these patients. METHODS: The study included 60
      patients with JNCL; their mean age was 16.5 years (range 5-33). The age at onset 
      of epilepsy, type of seizures, effect of the first AED on seizures, and the
      current seizure frequency and AED therapy were studied. The side effects of the
      AEDs were also clarified. RESULTS: Fifty of the 60 patients had epilepsy.
      Patients' first epileptic seizure occurred at a mean age of 10.0 years (range
      5-16), the most common type being generalized seizures. As the first AED tried,
      valproate (VPA) and lamotrigine (LTG) appeared equally effective, with 80% of the
      patients responding to these AEDs. During the study year, the median seizure
      frequency was four seizures a year (range 0-120), and 72% of the patients had
      good or satisfactory seizure control (0-6 seizures a year). In the different AED 
      therapy groups, the proportion of patients with good or satisfactory seizure
      control ranged from 25% to 100%. LTG in monotherapy or in combination with
      clonazepam (CZP) was superior to other AEDs or combinations, but VPA also seemed 
      effective. Adverse effects leading to the discontinuation of an AED were observed
      in 25% of the patients, most frequently in patients receiving phenobarbital (PB).
      No patient receiving LTG had to discontinue the drug due to adverse effects.
      CONCLUSION: Epilepsy in JNCL can usually be successfully treated with the current
      AEDs. In Finnish patients with JNCL, treatment is based on LTG, or, secondarily, 
      VPA. In combination therapy, CZP seems a valuable add-on AED.

      study. GREAT Study Investigators Group. Gabapentin in Refractory Epilepsy Add-on 
      Treatment.
PG  - 1289-95
AB  - PURPOSE: Our objective was to compare the efficacy and safety of gabapentin and
      vigabatrin as first-line add-on treatment in patients with partial epilepsy.
      METHODS: This was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized dose titration study.
      After baseline assessment and randomization, the dose could be increased if
      seizures persisted and reduced if side effects occurred. Health-related quality
      of life was assessed at baseline and at the end of the study. By a protocol
      amendment post hoc, all randomized patients were offered a standardized perimetry
      examination at the end of the study. Improvement rate was the proportion of
      patients with a reduction of seizure frequency of at least 50% during an 8-week
      period without any adverse events causing withdrawal. RESULTS: One hundred two
      patients were randomized and analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis. The
      improvement rate was 48% in the gabapentin group and 56% in the vigabatrin group.
      The improvement rate, when per protocol criteria were fulfilled, was 57% in the
      gabapentin group and 59% in the vigabatrin group. The proportion of seizure-free 
      patients was 31% in the gabapentin group and 39% in the vigabatrin group. There
      was no difference in quality-of-life scores between the groups. Perimetry after
      termination of the study on 64 patients showed abnormal results in 3 of 32
      patients in the vigabatrin group. CONCLUSION: Approximately one third of the
      patients in both groups became seizure-free. Although no major differences were
      seen in terms of the improvement rate between the groups, equivalence between the
      two drugs was not found.

PG  - 515-7
AB  - A 48-year-old male suffering with SUNCT (severe unilateral neuralgiform headache 
      with conjunctival injection and tearing, rhinorrhea and sub-clinical sweating)
      presented in 1996 after a 10-year history of multiple failed therapies. The
      symptoms included strictly left-sided ocular, as well as facial and temple pain. 
      The pain attacks were burning, sharp, shooting and occurred 25 times daily,
      lasting 2 to 3 minutes with tearing and conjunctival injection. There was no
      associated nausea or vomiting, but there was photophobia. No other autonomic
      changes were reported and the pain was not triggerable. Initially Indocin
      (indomethacin) was tried without significant benefit. Gabapentin (Neurontin) was 
      then started with improvement at 1800 mg per day. The patient was then lost to
      follow-up for 3 years, as he moved from the Los Angeles area. He returned in 1999
      having stopped the gabapentin after his prescription ran out in 1996, reporting
      the pain returned immediately. Again gabapentin was prescribed and at 900 mg
      three times daily he has been pain free for 12 months.

TI  - Recurrent short-lasting headache associated with paroxysmal hypertension: a
      clonidine-responsive syndrome.
PG  - 509-14
AB  - The clinical syndrome of hypertension, headache, palpitation, diaphoresis,
      flushing, and emotional lability is classically associated with pheochromocytoma.
      Two patients are presented with this constellation of symptoms in whom
      investigations for pheochromocytoma were unrevealing. Headache was the presenting
      and most prominent complaint, with daily episodes of short-lasting, intermittent,
      and paroxysmal attacks. Each paroxysm of headache was associated with a dramatic 
      increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. After failure to control the
      labile fluctuations in blood pressure and headache with several classes of
      anti-hypertensive medications used in combination, a prompt and persistent
      response occurred after the administration of clonidine. The pathophysiology of
      this syndrome and the mechanism of clonidine action are reviewed in the context
      of a possible failure of the baroreceptor reflex.

TI  - Treating fibromyalgia.
PG  - 1575-82, 1587
AB  - Fibromyalgia is an extremely common chronic condition that can be challenging to 
      manage. Although the etiology remains unclear, characteristic alterations in the 
      pattern of sleep and changes in neuroendocrine transmitters such as serotonin,
      substance P, growth hormone and cortisol suggest that dysregulation of the
      autonomic and neuroendocrine system appears to be the basis of the syndrome. The 
      diagnosis is clinical and is characterized by widespread pain, tender points and,
      commonly, comorbid conditions such as chronic fatigue, insomnia and depression.
      Treatment is largely empiric, although experience and small clinical studies have
      proved the efficacy of low-dose antidepressant therapy and exercise. Other less
      well-studied measures, such as acupuncture, also appear to be helpful. Management
      relies heavily on the physician's supportive counseling skills and willingness to
      try novel strategies in refractory cases.

PG  - 237-47
AB  - The explosion in understanding how the central nervous system (CNS) works affords
      new opportunities to interact with the nervous system to compensate for
      dysfunction due to disease or injury. Neuromodulation is a term that describes
      methods that carry out that interaction based on principles of nerve cell
      physiology. There currently are two neuromodulation techniques used that require 
      implantable devices-neurostimulation and implantable, chronic drug delivery. This
      article describes the devices used for neuromodulation, the motivation for the
      different feature sets of the devices, and the physiological and technological
      principles underpinning their use.

TI  - Treatment of fibromyalgia with antidepressants: a meta-analysis.
PG  - 659-66
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fibromyalgia is a common, poorly understood musculoskeletal pain
      syndrome with limited therapeutic options. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review
      the efficacy of antidepressants in the treatment of fibromyalgia and examine
      whether this effect was independent of depression. DESIGN: Meta-analysis of
      English-language, randomized, placebo-controlled trials. Studies were obtained
      from searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PSYCLIT (1966-1999), the Cochrane Library,
      unpublished literature, and bibliographies. We performed independent duplicate
      review of each study for both inclusion and data extraction. MAIN RESULTS:
      Sixteen randomized, placebo-controlled trials were identified, of which 13 were
      appropriate for data extraction. There were 3 classes of antidepressants
      evaluated: tricyclics (9 trials), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (3
      trials), and S-adenosylmethionine (2 trials). Overall, the quality of the studies
      was good (mean score 5.6, scale 0-8). The odds ratio for improvement with therapy
      was 4.2 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2.6 to 6.8). The pooled risk
      difference for these studies was 0.25 (95% CI, 0.16 to 0.34), which calculates to
      4 (95% CI, 2.9 to 6.3) individuals needing treatment for 1 patient to experience 
      symptom improvement. When the effect on individual symptoms was combined,
      antidepressants improved sleep, fatigue, pain, and well-being, but not trigger
      points. In the 5 studies where there was adequate assessment for an effect
      independent of depression, only 1 study found a correlation between symptom
      improvement and depression scores. Outcomes were not affected by class of agent
      or quality score using meta-regression. CONCLUSION: Antidepressants are
      efficacious in treating many of the symptoms of fibromyalgia. Patients were more 
      than 4 times as likely to report overall improvement, and reported moderate
      reductions in individual symptoms, particularly pain. Whether this effect is
      independent of depression needs further study.

TI  - Palatal myoclonus: report of two cases.
PG  - 901-4
AB  - We describe two cases of palatal myoclonus (PM), one essential and another
      secondary to a stroke. Case 1: a 64 years old female who developed clicking
      sounds in both ears after a stroke and three years later on noticed a progressive
      involuntary movement of the throat associated with rhythmic contractions of the
      soft palate, muscles of tongue and throat. MRI showed an ischemic area in
      brainstem. The patient had a partial response to the use of sumatriptan 6 mg
      subcutaneously. Case 2: a 66 years old female who began with ear clicking at left
      ear that worsed slowly associated with tinnitus and arrhythmic movements of soft 
      palate and an audible click at left ear. Brain MRI was normal; audiometry showed 
      bilateral neurosensory loss. She was prescribed clonazepan 1 mg daily with
      complete recovery. Primary and secondary palatal myoclonus share the same
      clinical features but probably have different pathophysiological underlying
      mechanisms.

TI  - Bipolar depression: pharmacotherapy and related therapeutic strategies.
PG  - 558-72
AB  - The depressed phase of bipolar affective disorder is a significant cause of
      suffering, disability, and mortality and represents a major challenge to treating
      clinicians. This article first briefly reviews the phenomenology and clinical
      correlates of bipolar depression and then focuses on the major pharmacological
      treatment options. We strongly recommend use of mood stabilizers as the
      first-line treatment for the type I form of bipolar depression, largely because
      longer-term preventative therapy with these agents almost certainly will be
      indicated. Depressive episodes that do not respond to lithium, divalproex, or
      another mood stabilizer, or episodes that "breakthrough" despite preventive
      treatment, often warrant treatment with an antidepressant or electroconvulsive
      therapy. The necessity of mood stabilizers in the type II form of bipolar
      depression is less certain, aside from the rapid cycling presentation. Both
      experts and practicing clinicians recommend bupropion and the selective serotonin
      reuptake inhibitors as coequal initial choices, with venlafaxine and monoamine
      oxidase inhibitors, such as tranylcypromine, preferred for more resistant cases. 
      The risk of antidepressant-induced hypomania or mania with concomitant mood
      stabilizer therapy is low, on the order of 5% to 10% during acute phase therapy. 
      Additional therapeutic options and optimal durations of therapy also are
      discussed.

TI  - Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for low back pain: a systematic review
      within the framework of the Cochrane Collaboration Back Review Group.
PG  - 2501-13
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A systematic review of randomized and double-blind controlled
      trials was performed. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
      drugs are the most frequently prescribed medications worldwide and are widely
      used for patients with low back pain. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the treatment of nonspecific low back
      pain with or without radiation, and to assess which type of nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drug is most effective. METHODS: For this study, the Cochrane
      Controlled Trials Register, Medline and Embase, and reference lists of articles
      were searched. Two reviewers blinded with respect to authors, institution, and
      journal independently extracted data and assessed the methodologic quality of the
      studies. If data were considered clinically homogeneous, a meta-analysis was
      performed. If data were considered clinically heterogeneous, a qualitative
      analysis was performed using a rating system with four levels of evidence:
      strong, moderate, limited, and no evidence. RESULTS: This review involved 51
      trials and 6057 patients. Of these trials, 16 (31%) were of high quality. The
      pooled relative risk for global improvement after 1 week was 1.24 (95% confidence
      interval [CI] = 1.10-1.41), and for additional analgesic use was 1.29 (95% CI =
      1.05-1.57), indicating a statistically significant but small effect in favor of
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as compared with a placebo. The results of
      the qualitative analysis showed that there is conflicting evidence (Level 3) that
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are more effective than paracetamol for
      acute low back pain, and that there is moderate evidence (Level 2) that
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are not more effective than other drugs for 
      acute low back pain. There is strong evidence (Level 1) that various types of
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are equally effective for acute low back
      pain. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence from the 51 trials included in this review
      suggests that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are effective for short-term
      symptomatic relief in patients with acute low back pain. Furthermore, there does 
      not seem to be a specific type of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that is
      clearly more effective than others. Sufficient evidence on chronic low back pain 
      still is lacking.

      lateralization.
PG  - 406-13
AB  - The mechanisms of conscious perception are uncertain. In a preliminary study,
      dramatic effects of train duration on perception in a patient with right brain
      stroke were noted. In this study, the mechanisms of train duration on perception 
      of peripheral somatosensory stimuli are examined. Subjects included healthy
      adults and patients with right brain infarctions. Train duration effects on
      perception were examined in relation to cerebral infarction, handedness, age,
      elevated peripheral threshold via bupivacaine, and impaired attention via
      diazepam or scopolamine. Perceptual thresholds to electrical pulses on the hand
      decreased as train duration increased, but only over the first several hundred
      milliseconds. Compared to controls, right brain stroke patients showed much
      greater lowering of threshold in the affected hand as train duration was
      extended. Age and bupivacaine elevated thresholds, but had little or no influence
      on train duration effects. Diazepam and scopolamine had no effect on thresholds. 
      Thresholds were lower in the left than right hand of healthy dextral subjects,
      irrespective of age. Sinistral subjects had less left/right asymmetry. Increased 
      train duration effect in patients is not explained by a primary elevation in
      threshold or by impaired vigilance. Lower perceptual thresholds in the left hand 
      of healthy dextral subjects is consistent with right cerebral dominance for
      externally directed attention.

TI  - The epidural and intrathecal administration of somatotrophin-release inhibiting
      factor: native and synthetic analogues.
PG  - 82-90
AB  - It is well-known that morphine is the king of analgesics. It is widely used, and 
      administered in various ways for the control of acute and chronic pain states.
      There are, however, certain types of pain and certain clinical conditions in
      which morphine cannot be used due to the risk of possible complications. These
      are usually pain states associated with intracranial hypertension, the presence
      of serious respiratory problems, the onset of major opioid tolerance, persistent 
      vomiting, and so on. The search for "alternative analgesics" has been in progress
      for a decade, alternatives that could be used alone or in combination for spinal 
      administration in the treatment of complex chronic pain states and with a low
      incidence of secondary effects. Today, research is carefully assessing the
      clinical effectiveness and the side effects of a series of drugs for spinal
      administration, that is, epidural or intrathecal, such as the new narcotics,
      alpha-2 agonists, central muscle relaxants, calcitonin, and local anesthetics. In
      this alternative analgesic category we have to mention the somatotrophin-release 
      inhibiting factor (SRIF), which is an ubiquitous native hormone with widespread, 
      predominantly inhibitory actions, and octreotide, its synthetic analogue. In this
      article we review the literature on the natural drug and its synthetic analogue, 
      paying particular attention to the problems connected with intraspinal
      administration and analgesic properties.

TI  - Periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges: association with seizures.
PG  - 402-6
AB  - The clinical features and EEGs of 45 consecutive patients (40 adults and 5
      children) who had periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) were
      reviewed to determine the relationship between seizures and PLEDs. Focal
      encephalitis and ischemic stroke were the most frequent underlying processes for 
      adult patients. All of the children, but only six of the adults, had long-lasting
      cerebral disorders whereas the remaining adults had acute or subacute illness.
      There were 38 patients (84.4%) experiencing a seizure disorder. Twenty-six of
      them had their first seizure during their acute illness, as the pattern of PLED
      was encountered. Eight cases had status epilepticus, and seven of them had
      epilepsia partialis continua. Nineteen patients had a recent seizure in the day
      when PLEDs were observed but not during EEG recording; 12 patients had their
      seizures within 10 days before the observation of PLED. PLEDs were grouped into
      three categories with respect to their extensions: lateralized to one hemisphere 
      (n = 22), localized in one region (n = 17) and being prominent over one side with
      contralateral spread (n = 6). The last group was found to be more closely
      associated with frequent seizures or status epilepticus than the other two
      groups. Our results showed that PLEDs were highly correlated with recent seizures
      in the majority of the patients. These EEG findings may be considered as a
      manifestation of an increased neuronal excitability caused by different
      etiologies; but not an ictal pattern.

TI  - Raloxifene: a review of its use in postmenopausal osteoporosis.
PG  - 379-411
AB  - Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that partially mimics the
      effects of estrogens in bone and the cardiovascular system, while functioning as 
      an antiestrogen in endometrial and breast tissue. In randomised
      placebo-controlled studies involving postmenopausal women or patients with
      osteoporosis, raloxifene 60 to 150 mg/day was effective in increasing bone
      mineral density (BMD) over 12- to 36-month periods. At the 60 mg/day recommended 
      dosage, increases of 1.6 to 3.4%, 0.9 to 2.3% and 1.0 to 1.6% were reported in
      lumbar spine, femoral neck and total hip, respectively, versus < or =0.5% with
      placebo. Raloxifene 60 or 120 mg/day decreased the risk of vertebral fractures
      over a 36-month period in postmenopausal patients with osteoporosis. Significant 
      reductions in radiographic fracture risk versus placebo (30 and 50%) occurred
      regardless of whether patients had existing fractures at baseline. Although
      raloxifene did not affect the overall incidence of nonvertebral fractures, a
      reduction in the incidence of ankle fracture was reported in comparison with
      placebo. In postmenopausal women, raloxifene 60 mg/day significantly reduced
      serum levels of total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol from baseline,
      compared with placebo. High density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride
      levels were unaffected. Raloxifene 60 or 120 mg/day reduced the risk of invasive 
      breast cancer by 76% during a median of 40 months' follow-up in postmenopausal
      patients with osteoporosis and no history of breast cancer. A relative risk
      reduction of 90% was reported for estrogen-receptor positive invasive breast
      cancers; estrogen-receptor negative cancer risk was unaffected by raloxifene.
      Raloxifene was generally well tolerated in clinical trials at dosages up to 150
      mg/day. Adverse events thought to be related to raloxifene treatment were hot
      flushes and leg cramps. Venous thromboembolism was the only serious adverse event
      thought to be related to raloxifene treatment and a relative risk of 3.1 compared
      with placebo treatment was reported in patients with osteoporosis. Vaginal
      bleeding occurred in < or =6.4% of raloxifene-treated women but was reported by
      50 to 88% of those receiving estrogens or hormone replacement therapy (HRT).
      Raloxifene treatment was not associated with stimulatory effects on the
      endometrium. CONCLUSIONS: Raloxifene significantly increases BMD in
      postmenopausal women and reduces vertebral fracture risk in patients with
      osteoporosis. In clinical trials, raloxifene was generally well tolerated
      compared with placebo and HRT, although its propensity to cause hot flushes
      precludes use in women with vasomotor symptoms. In particular, the lack of
      stimulatory effects on the endometrium and the reduction in invasive breast
      cancer incidence indicate raloxifene as an attractive alternative to HRT for the 
      management of postmenopausal osteonorosis.

TI  - Intrathecal baclofen withdrawal simulating neuroleptic malignant syndrome in a
      child with cerebral palsy.
PG  - 561-5
AB  - Intrathecal baclofen infusion (IBI) is being used with increasing frequency in
      children to treat spasticity and dystonia. In this report, we summarize the
      clinical course of a 9-year-old boy with quadriplegic cerebral palsy with mixed
      tonal abnormalities (spasticity and dystonia) experiencing withdrawal from
      intrathecal baclofen. His clinical course is compared to that of adults
      experiencing withdrawal from IBI and to neuroleptic malignant syndrome. If
      unrecognized, this disorder may have significant potential for morbidity and
      mortality. Clues to diagnosis, appropriate evaluation, and potential treatments
      are discussed. When a child treated with IBI presents with unexplained multiorgan
      system dysfunction, particularly if accompanied by evidence of rhabdomyolysis,
      the integrity of the IBI system must be evaluated. In some cases, evaluation
      might necessitate surgical exploration. Caregivers most commonly seek urgent
      evaluation and treatment from their primary care provider when their child
      experiences fever or acute illness. Primary care providers of children treated
      with IBI should be made aware of this clinical scenario to prevent delays in
      diagnosis.

AB  - We report persistent headaches developing in a patient subsequent to the
      placement of a spinal cord stimulator in the upper cervical spine. These
      persistent headaches responded to dihydroergotamine and sumatriptan. Headaches
      ceased upon repositioning of the stimulator lower in the cervical spine. We
      postulate an effect of the device on the trigeminovascular system via the nucleus
      caudalis trigeminalis and/or spinal trigeminal tract.

TI  - Fixation dysfunction with intermittent saccadic intrusions managed by yoked
      prisms: a case report.
PG  - 183-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: A 44-year-old woman came to us with a chief symptom of "jumping
      letters side-to-side, which is most noticeable while reading." The onset occurred
      after she had experienced a closed head traumatic brain injury 3 years earlier.
      Several neuro-ophthalmologists diagnosed a fixational instability secondary to
      saccadic intrusions and prescribed Gabapentin, which provided minimal relief.
      METHODS: The term saccadic intrusions refers to an inappropriate saccade with a
      disrupting effect on fixation. Our examination revealed a myopic anisometropia.
      Motility testing confirmed saccadic intrusions that lessened on occlusion of
      either eye and superior gaze. A plano spectacle with six-prism diopter-yoked base
      down was used to position the eyes in the superior null point.
      Electro-oculography, using the Visagraph II, demonstrated pre and post changes
      with the prism. The uncorrected anisometropia allowed the patient to be monocular
      under binocular viewing conditions. CASE REPORT: The case report focuses on
      fixational problems that may occur secondary to traumatic brain injuries. There
      is evidence that the origin of the problem may be from uninhibited brain stem
      circuits. Pharmacological treatment may only offer transient improvement. The
      responsibility of a functional cure is often placed on the optometrist.
      CONCLUSION: This case demonstrates how an alternative use of prism and
      prescription application can play an important role in the management of fixation
      dysfunctions.

TI  - Central nervous system paracoccidioidomycosis. Report of a case successfully
      treated with itraconazol.
PG  - 231-4
AB  - Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a primary pulmonary infection that often
      disseminates to other organs and systems. Involvement of the central nervous
      system (CNS) is rare and due to the fact that both clinical alertness and
      establishment of the diagnosis are delayed, the disease progresses causing
      serious problems. We report here a case of neuroparacoccidioidomycosis (NPCM),
      observed in a 55 year-old male, who consulted due to neurological symptoms (left 
      hemiparesis, paresthesias, right palpebral ptosis, headache, vomiting and tonic
      clonic seizures) of a month duration. Upon physical examination, an ulcerated
      granulomatous lesion was observed in the abdomen. To confirm the diagnosis a
      stereotactic biopsy was taken; additionally, mycological tests from the ulcerated
      lesion and a bronchoalveolar lavage were performed. In the latter specimens, P.
      brasiliensis yeast cells were visualized and later on, the brain biopsy revealed 
      the presence of the fungus. Treatment with itraconazole (ITZ) was initiated but
      clinical improvement was unremarkable; due to the fact that the patient was
      taking sodium valproate for seizure control, drug interactions were suspected and
      confirmed by absence of ITZ plasma levels. The latter medication was changed to
      clonazepam and after several weeks, clinical improvement began to be noticed and 
      was accompanied by diminishing P. brasiliensis antigen and antibody titers. In
      the PCM endemic areas, CNS involvement should be considered more often and the
      efficacy of itraconazole therapy should also be taken into consideration.

TI  - Gabapentin in the prophylaxis of migraine: a double-blind randomized
      placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 145-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Gabapentin is an antiepileptic drug of new generation that increases
      brain GABA levels. We report the results of a three-month randomised double-blind
      placebo-controlled study on the effects of gabapentin in the prophylaxis of
      patients with migraine meeting the IHS criteria. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We treated
      63 patients suffering from migraine with or without aura. Patients treated their 
      attack at home using symptomatic drugs and clinical assessment was recorded on a 
      diary. After a washout of 8 week from any other prophylactic treatment, all
      patients were treated with 1200 mg/day of gabapentin; this is our therapeutic
      plan: 400 mg/day from 1st to 3rd day, 800 mg/day from 4th to 6th day and 1200
      mg/day from 7th day. RESULTS: No patients withdrew, gabapentin was well
      tolerated; adverse events (somnolence, dizziness, tremor, fatigue and ataxia)
      generally were transient and mild to moderate in severity and in 13 patients
      (27%) only occurred. At the end of treatment, in such case, we reported a
      significative reduction of frequency and intensity of migraine in 30 patients
      treated with gabapentin. DISCUSSION: Our observations indicate that gabapentin is
      well tolerated by patients and that reduces headache frequency and use of
      symptomatic drugs in both groups. Gabapentin shows to have an effective
      therapeutic action in the prophylactic treatment of migraine.

TI  - Hydroquinine pharmacokinetics after oral administration in adult patients with
      muscle cramps.
PG  - 263-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to determine the pharmacokinetic properties
      of hydroquinine after oral administration in adult patients with muscle cramps.
      The main reason for this study was the poor availability of pharmacokinetic data,
      hindering the design of studies to explore the possible relationship between
      hydroquinine concentrations and effects. METHODS: Sixteen adult patients with a
      clinical history of muscle cramps were given once-daily oral doses of 300 mg
      hydroquinine hydrobromide for 4 days. Serum and saliva samples were taken
      following a predefined schedule until 24 h after the last dose. Urine was
      collected during the study period. Hydroquinine concentrations were measured, and
      calculations were made of pharmacokinetic parameters using non-linear curve
      fitting. RESULTS: Pharmacokinetics of hydroquinine could be best described using 
      a one-compartment open model. After oral administration, hydroquinine was rapidly
      absorbed (mean +/- SD: maximum concentration 2.43+/-0.68 mg/ 1; time to maximum
      concentration 1.4+/-1.2 h; lag time 0.54+/-0.50 h). With an elimination half-life
      of 10.9+/-6.1 h, steady-state was reached in several days. The distribution
      volume was 1.24+/-0.29 l/kg, total clearance was 6.7+/-3.2 l/h. The measured
      unbound hydroquinine fraction was 8.6+/-3.0%. No correlation was found between
      saliva and serum concentrations. Cumulative urinary excretion of unchanged
      hydroquinine 24 h after the first dose was 35.5+/-9.2 mg. CONCLUSION:
      Pharmacokinetic properties of hydroquinine are roughly similar to those of
      quinine. The unchanged fraction of hydroquinine excreted in urine is higher than 
      that reported for quinine. Saliva hydroquinine concentrations could not be
      related to serum values. Steady-state trough or other fixed-time serum
      concentrations may prove useful for further optimisation of hydroquinine dosage.

      studies, individual placebo-controlled studies for the treatment of specific
      chronic pain syndromes, and metaanalytic studies were reviewed and placed into
      table format. Analysis of this evidence led to the following conclusions: The
      evidence was consistent in indicating that overall antidepressants may have an
      antinociceptive effect in chronic pain, and that these drugs were effective for
      neuropathic pain. There was also some evidence that these drugs could be
      effective for psychogenic or somatoform disorder-associated pain. This evidence
      also strongly suggested that serotonergic-noradrenergic antidepressants may have 
      a more consistent antinociceptive effect than the serotonergic antidepressants.
      Finally, this evidence indicated that antidepressants could be effective for pain
      associated with some specific pain syndromes, such as chronic low back pain,
      osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, fibrositis or fibromyalgia, and ulcer
      healing. Possible reasons for the conflicting results of studies in this area are
      presented, and problems that could limit the validity of the conclusions of this 
      review are discussed.

TI  - Effectiveness of amitriptyline in the prophylactic management of childhood
      headaches.
PG  - 539-49
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the effectiveness of a standardized dose of amitriptyline, 1 
      mg/kg, for childhood headaches. BACKGROUND: Amitriptyline has been shown to be
      effective for the prophylaxis of migraine in adults. Studies in children,
      however, have been quite limited. In adults, the suggested effective dose range
      is 10 to 150 mg. In children, a standardized dosage is often not used, resulting 
      in a dosage range in clinical practice that often varies from a very low dose to 
      a dose equivalent to that used in adults. METHODS: Children with more than three 
      headaches per month were treated with amitriptyline, slowly increasing the dose
      to 1 mg/kg per day. The frequency, severity, and duration of their headaches were
      initially evaluated and subsequently measured at each follow-up evaluation. Two
      hundred seventy-nine children had headaches occurring frequently enough to
      indicate prophylactic treatment. Of these children, 192 (68.8%) were treated with
      amitriptyline. The average age at presentation was 12.0 (+/- 3.0) years. The
      ratio of boys to girls was 1:1.74. The average frequency of headaches was 17.1
      (+/- 10.1) days per month. The average severity was 6.84 (+/- 1.67) on a 10-point
      pain scale. The average duration was 11.5 (+/- 15.0) hours. The most frequent
      diagnoses using International Headache Society criteria were migraine (60.6%),
      migraine with aura (7.9%), and tension-type headache (10.4%). Of these children, 
      146 have been seen for at least one follow-up examination, occurring on average
      67.3 (+/- 32.3) days after beginning prophylactic treatment. RESULTS: A total of 
      84.2% of the children reported an overall perception of being better, while 11.6%
      reported being the same. The frequency of headaches improved to 9.2 (+/- 10.0)
      days per month. The average severity was reduced to 5.1 (+/- 2.1), and the
      average duration was reduced to 6.3 (+/- 11.1) hours. If daily or continuous
      headaches were excluded, the improvements were more marked. Minimal side effects 
      were reported from these children and their families. Long-term evaluation (156
      to 415 days) showed continued sustained improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Amitriptyline
      is an effective prophylactic medication for children with frequent headaches. A
      standardized dosing regimen results in a significant number of children
      responding with minimal side effects. The children are able to tolerate this
      dosing scheme and demonstrate good adherence to a dosing schedule of once a day.

TI  - Intrathecal baclofen alleviates autonomic dysfunction in severe brain injury.
PG  - 316-9
AB  - Sympathetic storm phenomena are well known therapeutic problems in patients with 
      severe brain injury. We have treated four patients with intrathecal baclofen
      (ITB) who suffered from severe hypertension, tachycardia and other sympathetic
      storm phenomena after different primary events. In all patients conventional
      therapy with sedatives and antiadrenergic medication had been taken to the upper 
      limits before initiating ITB. Autonomic dysfunction immediately improved in three
      of four patients. In all patients ITB, via lumbar or ventricular route, proved
      safe and without complications. The anatomical and pharmacological basis of the
      GABA-B agonist action on such sympathetic storm phenomena are not yet fully
      understood. However, the positive results observed in three out of four patients 
      are promising and require further investigation. ITB is a new therapeutic
      approach to control otherwise unresponsive sympathetic storm phenomena in severe 
      brain injury.

TI  - A review of the treatment of primary headaches. Part II: Tension-type headache.
PG  - 2-9
AB  - This paper reviews pharmacological and other approaches currently used to treat
      tension-type headache (TTH), and examines aspects of the classification and
      pathogenesis of this common complaint. Accurate diagnosis is essential before
      treatment is prescribed and should involve complete history taking, thorough
      neurological examination and evaluation of possible associated factors. The most 
      frequently used drugs for the acute treatment of TTH are non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) of which only some have been shown to be
      efficacious in placebo-controlled trials. Amitriptyline remains the first choice 
      treatment for prophylaxis. Other antidepressants, muscle relaxants and
      benzodiazepines may be used, but few have been evaluated adequately in
      placebo-controlled trials. Biofeedback and relaxation training, demonstrated
      efficacious by controlled studies, may be used when the aim is to avoid the side 
      effects of pharmacological treatment.

TI  - Routine hospital alcohol detoxification practice compared to symptom triggered
      management with an Objective Withdrawal Scale (CIWA-Ar).
PG  - 135-44
AB  - Charts of patients hospitalized for uncomplicated alcohol withdrawal were
      examined and detoxification practices compared. Patients detoxified using a
      Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol-revised (CIWA-Ar) based PRN 
      protocol on the addiction unit received significantly fewer chlordiazepoxide
      milligram equivalents over shorter duration than patients managed by other
      detoxification methods on other hospital units. Significantly fewer patients
      received benzodiazepines in the CIWA-Ar protocol managed group, but inter-group
      differences (p < 0.01) remained when only medicated patients were compared.
      Differences between the protocol and non-protocol groups did not reach
      statistical significance when PRN only strategies were examined, suggesting that 
      the use of a symptom-triggered strategy may account for the noted effects.

TI  - Outpatient sequential high dose alkylation with stem cell support for patients

PG  - 2033-40
AB  - We evaluated the feasibility of administering, in an out-patient setting, a
      sequential high dose alkylating regimen with hematopoietic growth factor (HGF)
      and stem cell support to patients with advanced breast cancer. Peripheral blood
      stem cells (PBSC) were previously collected after chemotherapy and HGF. Two
      consecutive cycles of alkylating agents were planned: Thiotepa (T) then, 15 days 
      later, BCNU (B). Three dose levels of each agent were administered in cohorts of 
      consecutive patients: 400, 500 and 600 mg/m2 respectively. HGF and reinfusion of 
      PBSC followed both cycles. Toxicity and response were evaluated according to the 
      WHO recommendations. From April 1996 to August 1988, 30 women were enrolled: 8 in
      the first, 12 in the second and 10 in the third dose level. In all cases, B was
      administered after T with a median delay of 25 days because of grade 3/4
      hematological toxicity. 4 patients did not receive B because of previous lung
      radiotherapy, persistent tricytopenia or insufficient PBSC collection. 19
      patients with measurable lesions were considered for response. The objective
      response rate was 48% (11% CR, 37% PR). We recommended T and B at a dose of 600
      mg/m2 to conduct a phase II study in metastatic breast cancer and even to
      administer B before T.

TI  - Reversible acute renal allograft dysfunction due to gabapentin.
PG  - 208-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of gabapentin as an effective analgesic agent for neuropathic
      pain has expanded considerably. Its lack of both anticholinergic side effects and
      interference with the metabolism of drugs via the cytochrome P450 pathway make it
      especially useful for transplant recipients. METHODS AND RESULTS: We describe the
      case of a renal transplant recipient with a long-term stable functioning
      allograft who developed reversible acute renal dysfunction after beginning
      gabapentin therapy for chronic pain due to diabetic neuropathy. CONCLUSIONS: We
      suggest that gabapentin may cause acute renal dysfunction by a mechanism
      involving renal afferent vasoconstriction. Caution should be employed when
      considering the use of gabapentin in transplant recipients, especially when
      combined with other agents that may potentiate renal vasoconstriction.

AB  - Older patients can suffer from various forms of migraine. These patients should
      be educated regarding triggers and considered for prophylactic and acute
      treatments for frequent episodes. Practitioners should keep in mind the unique
      challenges of treating migraine in older persons and first search for other
      serious yet treatable causes for headache in these patients.

TI  - The effect of baclofen on the transmission in spinal pathways in spastic multiple
      sclerosis patients.
PG  - 1372-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To measure the effect of baclofen on the transmission in different
      spinal pathways to soleus motoneurones in spastic multiple sclerosis patients.
      METHODS: Baclofen was administered orally in 14 and intrathecally in 8 patients. 
      H(max)/M(max), presynaptic inhibition by biceps femoris tendon tap of femoral
      nerve stimulation, depression of the soleus H-reflex following previous
      activation of the Ia afferents from the soleus muscle (i.e. postactivation
      depression), disynaptic reciprocal Ia inhibition of the soleus H-reflex and the
      number of backpropagating action potentials in primary afferents, which may be a 
      sign of presynaptic inhibition, were examined. RESULTS: Baclofen depressed the
      soleus H(max)/M(max) ratio significantly following oral and intrathecal baclofen.
      None of the two tests of presynaptic inhibition, or the postactivation depression
      or the disynaptic reciprocal Ia inhibition of the soleus H-reflex were affected
      by baclofen administration. Also the action potentials of the primary afferents
      were unchanged during baclofen administration. CONCLUSIONS: The antispastic
      effect of baclofen is not caused by an effect on the transmitter release from Ia 
      afferents or on disynaptic reciprocal Ia inhibition. One possible explanation of 
      the depression of the H-reflex by baclofen is suggested to be a direct depression
      of motoneuronal excitability.

TI  - Low-dose gabapentin combined with either lamotrigine or carbamazepine can be
      useful therapies for trigeminal neuralgia in multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 45-8
AB  - Paroxysmal symptoms occur frequently in multiple sclerosis (MS). Usually they are
      treated with carbamazepine (CBZ) and phenytoin, although these medications are
      often interrupted due to adverse effects. We report 11 MS patients with
      trigeminal neuralgia (TN): 6 intolerant to a therapeutic dosage of CBZ, showing
      serious adverse effects and subsequently treated with a combination of low-dose
      CBZ and gabapentin (GBP) (group 1); 5 treated with lamotrigine (LMT), showing
      adverse effects and subsequently treated with GBP (group 2). Subjective pain
      level and impairment in performing daily activities were rated utilizing a
      3-point scale at time 0 and at optimal dosage time (T1). GBP was initiated at 300
      mg daily and titrated, until pain control was achieved without new adverse
      effects, to a maximum dose of 1,200 mg daily. CBZ or LMT were reduced to a level 
      which no longer produced adverse effects, although resulting in a lack of
      efficacy in relieving pain. Pain control was obtained in all patients but 1, with
      no side effects. The plasma level analysis, performed in 5 patients, resulted in 
      normal values. The mean dosages at T1 were: group 1 CBZ 400 mg and GBP 850 mg
      daily; group 2 LMT 150 mg and GBP 780 mg daily. Combining drugs with
      complementary modes of action may provide a rational pharmacological approach to 
      the management of TN in MS.

AB  - An 87-year-old woman with antiphospholipid syndrome accompanied by cortical
      blindness and thalamic syndrome resulting from infarction of the posterior
      cerebral artery is reported. She was hospitalized because of laceration of the
      head. Two months later, she complained of loss of visual acuity, sharp pain and
      numbness involving the left half of the body except her face. New right posterior
      lobe infarction and the existence of old left infarctions were confirmed by
      serial CT scans. Helical CT scan revealed embolization of the posterior cerebral 
      artery with atherosclerotic stenosis. Serological examination showed biologically
      false-positive and positive findings for lupus anticoagulant. She was treated
      with warfarin potassium and clonazepam.

      Steps Study Group.
PG  - 241-8
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of gabapentin as
      adjunctive therapy in doses required to achieve the most effective seizure
      control. There were 2016 patients with partial seizures requiring adjunctive
      therapy who received gabapentin at doses up to 3600 mg/day in this open-label,
      multicenter, 16-week study. Of the 1055 patients evaluable for efficacy, 573
      received gabapentin < or =1800 mg/day and 482 received > 1800 mg/day as the
      highest dose received. For the overall efficacy evaluable population, the
      percentage of patients achieving at least a 50% reduction in seizure frequency
      was 76.0%; 46.4% of the patients were seizure free. Patients whose highest
      gabapentin dose did not require > 1800 mg/day had, at baseline, fewer seizures
      and were receiving fewer concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) at baseline than 
      those patients requiring > 1800 mg/day. This suggests that patients requiring
      higher doses of gabapentin were more refractory to drug treatment at the start of
      the study. Gabapentin was well tolerated at all doses in this study. The results 
      of the study demonstrate that gabapentin is effective as adjunctive therapy in
      patients with partial seizures whose seizures are inadequately controlled by
      traditional AEDs.

TI  - Effect of vitamin D and calcium on bone mineral density in children with CP and
      epilepsy in full-time care.
PG  - 403-5
AB  - Atraumatic fractures are often seen in children and adolescents with cerebral
      palsy (CP) and epilepsy in full-time care. Increased bone fragility was
      postulated to be due to osteopenia resulting from a combination of factors
      including immobilization and antiepileptic treatment. The aim of this study was
      to determine the effect of vitamin D and calcium substitution on bone mineral
      density (BMD) in a group of children with CP in full-time care. Twenty children
      with the most severe form of CP (spastic quadriplegia) who had been treated with 
      antiepileptic drugs for a relatively long period of time were included in the
      study. Physical examination and laboratory analyses excluded other possible
      causes of osteopenia. BMD was measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry. Thirteen
      patients were treated for 9 months with 1,25-dihydroxy-cholecalciferol vitamin D 
      (0.25 mcg daily) and with calcium (500 mg daily). Seven control children were
      used for observation only. BMD greatly increased in the treated group, while
      children with CP in full-time care who did not receive vitamin D and calcium
      substitution continued to lose their bone mass. It can be concluded that the
      addition of vitamin D and calcium increases BMD in children with the most severe 
      form of CP, who are receiving antiepileptic drugs.

TI  - Restless legs syndrome: clinical features and treatment.
PG  - 397-403
AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS), widely recognized as a definite clinical entity,
      has an estimated prevalence of 1 to 15% in different ethnic populations. However,
      it remains an underdiagnosed condition and its symptoms are frequently ascribed
      to stress and anxiety. Advancement in modern imaging techniques and clinical drug
      trials provide evidence of an impaired dopaminergic system in RLS. Management
      involves investigating and correcting treatable secondary causes, avoidance of
      aggravating factors, and pharmacologic therapy. Recent controlled trials have
      demonstrated the effectiveness of dopamine agonists such as pramipexole and
      pergolide. Additional research is needed to further elucidate the pathophysiology
      of RLS, through obtaining post-mortem specimens and refinement of neuroimaging
      and neurophysiologic techniques. Isolation of specific genetic loci in familial
      cases would enable better characterization of distinct clinical and genetic
      subsets of RLS and result in better understanding of this disease at the
      molecular level.

TI  - Pharmacological and molecular characterization of glutamate receptors in the MIN6
      pancreatic beta-cell line.
PG  - 379-85
AB  - The MIN6 pancreatic beta-cell line responds to glutamate,
      alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and kainate, but 
      not N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) or 1S,3R-trans-ACPD, with increases in [Ca2+]i.
      This correlates with MIN6 expression of AMPA receptor subunits (GluR1-4) but only
      weak expression of NMDA NR2 receptor subunits, as determined by reverse
      transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Pharmacological
      characterization of the MIN6 AMPA receptors showed that AMPA-triggered [Ca2+]i
      responses were blocked by GYKI 52466, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX)
      and pentobarbital. AMPA-triggered [Ca2+]i responses were also blocked in
      Na(+)-free medium and by the voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channel antagonist La3+.
      Unlike cortical neuronal cultures, which show a loss of membrane-associated
      protein kinase C (PKC) activity and die in response to excitatory amino acid
      exposure, glutamate was not toxic to MIN6 cells and it did not decrease PKC
      activity. These studies indicate that MIN6 cells possess Ca(2+)-impermeable AMPA 
      receptors that secondarily allow Ca2+ influx following AMPA-induced
      depolarization and that, despite elevating [Ca2+]i, AMPA is not toxic to these
      cells. The effects of glutamate and glutamate receptor antagonists on pancreatic 
      cells needs to be better understood if these compounds are to be used as
      therapeutic agents to treat stroke.

TI  - Gabapentin is effective in treating nocturnal painful spasms in multiple
      sclerosis.
PG  - 192-3
AB  - In-patients with MS nocturnal spasms (NPS) occur frequently, primarily during the
      night and may influence the ability to and/or quality of sleep. We enrolled in an
      open label trial with GBP (up to 600 mg/day) 24 MS patients with NPS. We obtained
      patient reports of subjective discomfort at pre-treatment and following 2- (T1)
      and 8 weeks (T2), utilizing a 3-point analogue scale. Twenty of the 22 patients
      who completed the study reported resolution or amelioration of discomfort.
      Clinical improvement occurred 1 - 5 days following initial treatment. Three
      patients experienced adverse effects but completed the minimal follow-up period
      (2 weeks). Two patient dropped out of the study due to no compliance or adverse
      effects. A very low dose of GBP may be effective treatment for MS patients with
      NPS who may benefit from rapid improvement of discomfort with minimal risk of
      adverse effects.

TI  - The management of multiple sclerosis patients.
PG  - 263-70
AB  - The management of individuals with multiple sclerosis must be considered under
      the following headings: administration and follow-up of adequate
      disease-modifying treatment, symptomatic relief and neurorehabilitation.
      Neurorehabilitation deserves a four-step strategy: multidisciplinary assessment, 
      identification of areas of potential functional improvement, setting of goals of 
      short/long-term duration, and measurement of outcomes. The patient's perspective 
      is important to evaluate through questionnaires about quality of life. Well
      organized disability services with multidisciplinary specialists are probably
      cost effective and efficient. Determining the actual economic impact of multiple 
      sclerosis and defining the most cost-effective type of care for persons with
      multiple sclerosis is a need in all countries faced with the limitation of
      healthcare resources. In persons with multiple sclerosis the range of main
      symptoms includes the loss of mobility and spasticity, pain, tremor, abnormal eye
      movements, paroxysmal symptoms, bladder and bowel dysfunction, sexual
      disturbances, fatigue and depression. Current palliative treatments, which are
      reviewed, are partly successful depending on the type of symptoms under
      consideration.

TI  - Heterotopic ossification in childhood and adolescence.
PG  - 406-13
AB  - Heterotopic ossification, or myositis ossificans, denotes true bone in an
      abnormal place. The pathogenic mechanism is still unclear. A total of 643
      patients (mean age, 9.1 years) admitted for neuropediatric rehabilitation were
      analyzed retrospectively with respect to the existence of neurogenic heterotopic 
      ossification. The purpose of this study was to obtain information about
      incidence, etiology, clinical aspect, and consequences for diagnosis and therapy 
      of this condition in childhood and adolescence. Heterotopic ossification was
      diagnosed in 32 patients (mean age, 14.8 years) with average time of onset of 4
      months after traumatic brain injury, near drowning, strangulation, cerebral
      hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, or spinal cord injury. The sex ratio was not
      significant. In contrast to what has been found in adult studies, serum alkaline 
      phosphatase was not elevated during heterotopic ossification formation. A
      persistent vegetative state for longer than 30 days proved to be a significant
      risk factor for heterotopic ossification. The incidence of neurogenic heterotopic
      ossification in children seems to be lower than in adults. A genetic
      predisposition to heterotopic ossification is suspected but not proven. As a
      prophylactic regimen against heterotopic ossification we use salicylates for
      those patients in a coma or persistent vegetative state with warm and painful
      swelling of a joint and consider continuous intrathecal baclofen infusion and
      botulinum toxin injection for those patients with severe spasticity. We prefer to
      wait at least 1 year after trauma before excision of heterotopic ossification.

TI  - Gabapentin enhances the analgesic effect of morphine in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 185-91
AB  - The most effective group of drugs for the treatment of severe pain is opioid
      analgesics. Their use, however, is limited by decreased effects in neuropathic
      and chronic pain as a result of increased pain and development of tolerance.
      Gabapentin (GBP) is effective in both experimental models of chronic pain and
      clinical studies of neuropathic pain. Therefore, we investigated, in a
      randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study, the pharmacodynamic and
      pharmacokinetic interaction of GBP and morphine in 12 healthy male volunteers.
      Morphine (60 mg, controlled release) or placebo was administered at 8:00 AM, and 
      GBP (600 mg) or placebo was administered at 10:00 AM, thus comparing the
      analgesic effect of placebo + GBP (600 mg) with placebo + placebo and morphine
      (60 mg) + GBP in comparison to morphine plus placebo by using the cold pressor
      test. The duration and intensity of the side effects were assessed by using
      visual analog scales. The analgesic effect was evaluated by the change in the
      area under the curve (h x %; 0% baseline before Medication 1) of pain tolerance. 
      Placebo + GBP (18.9% x h, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -2.5 to 40.3) did not
      present any significant analgesic effect compared with placebo + placebo (4.7% x 
      h, 95% CI: -16.7 to 26.1). A significant increase in pain tolerance was observed 
      comparing the combination of morphine and GBP (75.5% x h, 95% CI: 54.0-96.9) with
      morphine + placebo (40.6% x h, 95% CI: 19. 2-62.0). The observed adverse events
      after placebo + GBP were not significantly different compared with placebo +
      placebo. Morphine + placebo led to the expected opioid-mediated side effects.
      They were significantly more pronounced compared with placebo + placebo but did
      not differ significantly compared with the combination of morphine + GBP.
      Concerning the pharmacokinetic variables of morphine and its glucuronides, no
      significant difference between morphine + placebo and morphine + GBP was
      observed, whereas the area under the curve of GBP (43.9 +/- 5.3 vs 63.4 +/- 16.2 
      microg. h(-1). mL(-1), P < 0.05) significantly increased, and apparent oral
      clearance (230.8 +/- 29.4 mL/min vs 178 +/- 97.9 mL/min, P = 0.06) and apparent
      renal clearance (86.9 +/- 20.6 vs 73.0 +/- 24.2 mL/min, P = 0.067) of GBP
      decreased when morphine was administered concomitantly. These results suggest two
      different sites for the pharmacokinetic interaction-one at the level of
      absorption and the other at the level of elimination. Our study reveals both a
      pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interaction between morphine and GBP, leading
      to an increased analgesic effect of morphine + GBP. These results and the good
      tolerability of GBP should favor clinical trials investigating the clinical
      relevance of the combination of morphine and GBP for treating severe pain.
      IMPLICATIONS: In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial with 12
      healthy volunteers, we studied the interaction of morphine and gabapentin using
      the cold pressor test. The anticonvulsant gabapentin enhanced the acute analgesic
      effect of morphine. Furthermore, the plasma concentration of gabapentin was
      increased when morphine was administered concomitantly. Therefore, the well
      tolerated combination of gabapentin and morphine may improve pain therapy,
      especially in pain states, like chronic and neuropathic pain, which respond
      poorly to opioids.

TI  - Neurologic emergencies in the cancer patient.
PG  - 311-21
AB  - Neurologic complications of cancer and its therapy are varied and common, but
      there are few true neurologic emergencies. However, when a neurologic emergency
      does occur, rapid diagnosis and treatment can preserve neurologic function and,
      in some circumstances, save a life. Epidural spinal cord compression, raised
      intracranial pressure (ICP), status epilepticus, and intracerebral hemorrhage
      (ICH) are the most common neurologic emergencies in the cancer patient. This
      chapter details the clinical features, possible etiologies, diagnostic tests, and
      treatment options for each of these complications.

TI  - Use of gabapentin in the treatment of neuropathic pain.
PG  - 802-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of gabapentin for the treatment of neuropathic
      pain. DATA SOURCES: Clinical literature was identified through MEDLINE (from 1990
      to October 1999). Key search terms were gabapentin and pain. DATA SYNTHESIS:
      Neuropathic pain can be a problematic, chronic syndrome that is frequently
      refractory to current drug treatments. Gabapentin is a newer generation
      antiepileptic drug that is commonly used in treatment of neuropathic pain. An
      evaluation of clinical trials using gabapentin to treat neuropathic pain was
      performed. CONCLUSIONS: Gabapentin appears to be effective in treating various
      neuropathic pain disorders. Gabapentin may have advantages over current
      therapies, such as a favorable safety profile and lack of drug interactions;
      however, cost issues and limited experience may limit the use of gabapentin as a 
      first-line option.

TI  - Treatment of postherpetic neuralgia: an update.
PG  - 1113-26
AB  - Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a chronic pain syndrome that is often refractory 
      to treatment and can last for years, causing physical and social disability,
      psychological distress, and increased use of the healthcare system. In this paper
      we provide an update on recent developments in the treatment of PHN. We emphasise
      the results of recent studies that provide an evidence-based approach for
      treating PHN that was not available until very recently. In randomised,
      controlled clinical trials, the topical lidocaine patch, gabapentin, and
      controlled release oxycodone have been shown to provide superior pain relief in
      patients with PHN when compared with placebo. It has also recently been
      demonstrated that the tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline provides equivalent 
      analgesic benefit when compared with amitriptyline, but is better tolerated.
      Based on these results, nortriptyline can now be considered the preferred
      antidepressant for the treatment of PHN, although desipramine may be used if the 
      patient experiences unacceptable sedation from nortriptyline. The topical
      lidocaine patch, gabapentin and controlled release oxycodone all appear to be as 
      effective as tricyclic antidepressants in the treatment of patients with PHN, and
      the results of these recent studies suggest that each of these treatments should 
      be considered early in the course of treatment. Additional controlled trials are 
      needed to compare the efficacy and tolerability of these 4 treatments- tricyclic 
      antidepressants, gabapentin, the topical lidocaine patch and controlled release
      opioid analgesics--used singly and in various combinations in the treatment of
      patients with PHN.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of topiramate in childhood and adolescent epilepsy: a
      clinical experience.
PG  - 137-41
AB  - A 3-year retrospective review was undertaken of the use of topiramate in 51
      children aged 3-16 years with partial and generalized epilepsies who attended a
      tertiary referral epilepsy centre in a large children's hospital. The mean
      follow-up period was 19 months (range 6-33 months). Twenty-six children (51%)
      were still receiving topiramate at the time of their last review. Fifteen
      children (29%) showed a greater than 50% reduction in their seizure frequency and
      four children (8%) became seizure free, three on topiramate monotherapy. The drug
      appeared to be most effective in children with moderate learning difficulties
      with 75% showing an improvement in seizure control compared with 25% of children 
      with normal educational functioning. Topiramate was withdrawn in 25 patients. The
      reasons for withdrawal included adverse effects in 20, lack of effect in three
      and worsening of seizures in two patients. Adverse side effects were reported in 
      57% of the 51 patients. The majority of the side effects were related to
      behavioural and cognitive difficulties, with less-common side effects including
      anorexia, weight loss and headaches.

TI  - Sildenafil effects on sexual and cardiovascular responses in women with spinal
      cord injury.
PG  - 812-5
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Sexual dysfunction is common in women with spinal cord injuries
      (SCIs) and other neurologic conditions. Sildenafil has previously been shown to
      be safe and effective in the treatment of erectile dysfunction due to SCI. This
      study is the first to evaluate the sexual and cardiovascular effects of
      sildenafil in women with SCIs in a controlled, laboratory setting. METHODS:
      Nineteen premenopausal women with SCIs were randomly assigned to receive either
      sildenafil (50 mg) or placebo in a double-blind, crossover design study.
      Physiologic and subjective measures of sexual response, heart rate, and blood
      pressure were recorded during baseline and sexual stimulation conditions. Adverse
      events were also recorded. RESULTS: Significant increases in subjective arousal
      (SA) were observed with both drug (P <0.01) and sexual stimulation conditions (P 
      <0.001), and a borderline significant (P <0.07) effect of drug administration on 
      vaginal pulse amplitude (VPA) was noted. Maximal responses occurred when
      sildenafil was combined with visual and manual sexual stimulation. Cardiovascular
      data showed modest increases in heart rate (+/-5 bpm) and mild decreases in blood
      pressure (+/-4 mm Hg) across all stimulation conditions, consistent with the
      peripheral vasodilatory mechanism of the drug. Sildenafil was well tolerated with
      no evidence of significant adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that
      sildenafil may partially reverse the sexual dysfunction commonly associated with 
      SCI in women. Consistent with previous findings in men, the sexual effects of the
      drug were most evident under conditions of optimal stimulation. Mild, clinically 
      insignificant cardiovascular effects were also noted. Further large-scale studies
      of sildenafil's effects in women with neurogenic sexual dysfunction are strongly 
      indicated.

TI  - Treatment of prostatitis.
PG  - 3015-22, 3025-6
AB  - The term prostatitis is applied to a series of disorders, ranging from acute
      bacterial infection to chronic pain syndromes, in which the prostate gland is
      inflamed. Patients present with a variety of symptoms, including urinary
      obstruction, fever, myalgias, decreased libido or impotence, painful ejaculation 
      and low-back and perineal pain. Physical examination often fails to clarify the
      cause of the pain. Cultures and microscopic examination of urine and prostatic
      secretions before and after prostatic massage may help differentiate prostatitis 
      caused by infection from prostatitis with other causes. Because the rate of
      occult infection is high, a therapeutic trial of antibiotics is often in order
      even when patients do not appear to have bacterial prostatitis. If the patient
      responds to therapy, antibiotics are continued for at least three to four weeks, 
      although some men require treatment for several months. A patient who does not
      respond might be evaluated for chronic nonbacterial prostatitis, in which
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, alpha-blocking agents, anticholinergic
      agents or other therapies may provide symptomatic relief.

TI  - Violent recurrent ballism associated with infections in two children with static 
      encephalopathy.
PG  - 570-4
AB  - A variety of cerebral insults can result in static encephalopathy with
      developmental delays and relatively fixed motor and cognitive deficits. We
      describe two boys with static encephalopathy who experienced recurrent episodes
      of generalized, violent ballism seemingly provoked by relatively minor infectious
      illnesses or surgical procedures. These episodes first began at ages 14 and 9
      years, respectively. The baseline clinical states included relatively mild
      choreoathetosis plus cognitive impairment, as well as spasticity and/or ataxia.
      These episodes of ballism developed over hours, remained for weeks, and
      ultimately returned to baseline. Neuroleptics, anticonvulsants, and
      benzodiazepines were only partially beneficial; responses corresponded to the
      degree of sedation. Potential for self-injury or rhabdomyolysis/myoglobinuria led
      to the use of general anesthetics or neuromuscular blocking agents during
      selected episodes. Blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid studies, magnetic
      resonance imaging head scans, and electroencephalography revealed no diagnostic
      clues as to the precise causative factor precipitating these episodes.

PG  - 161-9
AB  - Multiple sclerosis is a complex disease which presents a unique challenge in
      clinical management. This decade has seen the advent of new therapies which are
      partially effective in modifying the disease course. However, current therapies
      have no impact on existing neurological deficits and so supportive measures,
      symptomatic treatment and comprehensive rehabilitation remain at the core of
      management. Historically clinical practice has often been empirical but
      management should now be evidence-based and guided by consensus opinion if
      improvements in care are to be made.

TI  - Treatment options in postherpetic neuralgia.
PG  - 25-35; discussion 48-52
AB  - Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a separate disease entity that represents a
      complication of acute herpes zoster. PHN, involving aberrant somatosensory
      processing in the peripheral and/or central nervous system, is considered to be a
      chronic neuropathic pain, frequently unresponsive to all treatment modalities.
      Despite the clinical trial data demonstrating successful pain relief with several
      drug regimens, the pharmacologic management of neuropathic pain is difficult,
      particularly in PHN. Response to therapy is generally inhomogeneous. Some
      patients experience long-term pain control with either topical or oral
      monotherapy with antidepressants, anticonvulsants, or opioids. Other PHN
      patients, such as those suffering pain due to central nervous system lesions, are
      extraordinarily refractory to all measures. This article will review current
      treatments--tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants, local anesthetics,
      clonidine, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-antagonists, and opioids and focus on
      mechanism-based pharmacologic interventions. Pharmacologic approaches can be
      classified into three groups: 1) drugs that act topically in the affected skin
      area; 2) drugs that act on nerve excitability and conduction in sensory axons;
      and 3) drugs that act on neural damage related synaptic changes. This last group 
      is the only pain treatment option related to central denervation. To date, the
      treatment of PHN has relied on the use of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), which
      represent the most comprehensively studied medications for this pain syndrome.
      Clinical data indicate that TCAs are effective analgesics in approximately 50% of
      patients; these drugs have been recommended as first-line agents for all
      neuropathic pain syndromes except trigeminal neuralgia, but are frequently
      contraindicated or poorly tolerated in elderly patients with PHN. If monotherapy 
      fails, a mechanism- and/or symptom-based multidrug regimen can be used. There is 
      also consistent support for intravenous and topical lidocaine, intravenous
      ketamine, carbamazepine, and opioids. Gabapentin, a new anticonvulsant, can be
      considered a first-line oral medication for PHN based on the efficacy and safety 
      results of a recently completed double-blind trial. In addition to positive
      effects on PHN, sleep, mood, and overall quality of life were significantly
      improved.

TI  - Nefazodone in patients with treatment-refractory posttraumatic stress disorder.
PG  - 203-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a highly prevalent and often 
      chronic disorder among combat veterans, persisting in as many as 15% of Vietnam
      veterans for at least 20 years. Treatment response in veterans with
      combat-related PTSD has been disappointing. Although anxiolytics,
      anticonvulsants, antipsychotics, and antidepressants have been tried, none has
      been consistently associated with improvement in all primary symptom domains
      (i.e., intrusive recollections, avoidance/numbing, and hyperarousal). This
      open-label study evaluated the use of nefazodone in a group of Vietnam veterans
      with chronic, treatment-refractory symptoms of PTSD. METHOD: Male outpatients
      with DSM-IV PTSD who had failed a minimum of 3 previous medication trials were
      eligible for the study. Nineteen Vietnam combat veterans entered the study and
      were treated with nefazodone, 100-600 mg/day, for 12 weeks. PTSD symptoms,
      anxiety, depression, sleep, sexual functioning, and adverse events were assessed 
      weekly. RESULTS: Severity of depression lessened, as did PTSD symptoms of
      intrusive recollections, avoidance, and hyperarousal. Depressive symptom severity
      as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory decreased by a mean of 30%.
      Similarly, there was an overall drop in the intensity of PTSD symptoms as
      measured by the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale of 32% with a 26% improvement
      for symptoms of intrusion, 33% for avoidance, and 28% for arousal. In addition,
      improvements in sleep and sexual functioning were reported. The mean daily dose
      of nefazodone after 12 weeks was 430 mg (range, 200-600 mg/day). The most
      frequently reported side effects were headaches (53%), dry mouth (42%), and
      diarrhea (42%), but side effects tended to be mild and transient. CONCLUSION: In 
      this group of Vietnam veterans with chronic treatment-refractory PTSD and
      multiple comorbid Axis I psychiatric disorders, nefazodone was well tolerated and
      effective. Larger, controlled studies are warranted.

TI  - Clinical predictors of acute response with quetiapine in psychotic mood
      disorders.
PG  - 185-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: In controlled studies of patients with schizophrenia, the atypical
      antipsychotic quetiapine, 300 mg/day, has been shown to be as effective in the
      treatment of positive and negative symptoms as haloperidol. However, little is
      known about the efficacy of quetiapine in patients with psychotic mood disorders.
      The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of quetiapine in the
      treatment of psychotic mood disorders in comparison with nonaffective psychotic
      disorders and identify clinical factors associated with quetiapine response.
      METHOD: In a naturalistic setting, by reviewing medical records, we assessed
      response to quetiapine and factors associated with response to quetiapine in 145 
      consecutive patients newly treated with the drug at a nonprofit academic
      psychiatric hospital. These patients had received a discharge diagnosis of
      bipolar disorder (manic, mixed, or depressive type), major depression with
      psychotic features, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder (bipolar or
      depressive type), delusional disorder, or psychosis not otherwise specified (NOS)
      according to DSM-IV criteria. RESULTS: Patients with a diagnosis of bipolar
      disorder, manic, mixed, or depressed and schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type
      displayed higher response rates (> 74%) compared with patients with
      schizophrenia. However, this finding did not achieve statistical significance. A 
      diagnosis of major depression with psychotic features (p = .02) and longer
      duration of illness (p = .03) were associated with less chance of responding.
      CONCLUSION: Quetiapine may be a useful alternative or adjunctive treatment for
      patients with bipolar and schizoaffective disorders.

TI  - Acute neurological stroke care in Europe: results of the European Stroke Care
      Inventory.
PG  - 5-10
AB  - Following the 1997 Recommendations of the EFNS Task Force on Acute Neurological
      Stroke Care (European Journal of Neurology, 1997: 4:435-441) a European Inventory
      was undertaken to assess the development of acute stroke care in the EFNS member 
      countries and to give an estimate of the needs based on 1997 data. All 30 members
      of the EFNS Stroke Scientist Panel were asked to complete a questionnaire on
      acute stroke epidemiology as well as acute stroke care in their country. Data
      were based either on national surveys, hospital statistics, or estimates given on
      the basis of extrapolation of regional studies, or other defined sources.
      Specialist estimates were also taken into account where no other data source was 
      available. Data from 22 countries were received and referred to almost one
      million strokes occurring per year in a population of over 500 million. Most
      epidemiological data confirmed an east-west gap known from previous studies.
      These included rates that, in eastern countries, were higher for incidence,
      stroke as a leading cause of death, and 30-day case-fatality, and rates that were
      lower for overall hospitalization or availability of CT scanning. East-west
      differences were not seen for the total number of acute stroke units or the
      number of acute stroke units set up within neurological hospital departments, nor
      for most other quality indicators of acute stroke care with the exception of
      technological standards in some countries. The higher rates for 30-day
      case-fatality in eastern Europe (mostly above 20%) compared with western Europe
      (mostly below 20%) are probably caused by a case mix with more severe ischemic
      strokes and a higher percentage of cerebral haemorrhages admitted for acute care 
      in eastern Europe. This is probably due to the higher prevalence of the most
      common risk factors for stroke in these countries which tend to result in more
      severe strokes. This, therefore, underlines the need for stroke prevention
      programmes especially in eastern Europe. This epidemiological east-west gap is
      not reflected by most quality indicators for acute stroke care, e.g. total number
      of acute stroke units available within each country. Most eastern European
      countries have a well-developed neurological care system for acute stroke but
      still have urgent technological and socioeconomical needs. The leading role of
      clinical neurology in acute stroke care is visible in most but not all European
      countries.

TI  - Flexor reflexes in chronic spinal cord injury triggered by imposed ankle
      rotation.
PG  - 793-803
AB  - Hypersensitivity of the flexor reflexes to input from force-sensitive muscle
      afferents may contribute to the prevalence and severity of muscle spasms in
      patients with spinal cord injuries. In the present study, we triggered flexor
      reflexes with constant-velocity ankle movements into end-range dorsiflexion and
      plantarflexion positions in 8 individuals with spinal cord injuries. We found
      that all 8 subjects had coordinated increases in flexion torque at the hip and
      ankle following externally imposed plantarflexion movements at the ankle. In
      addition, end-range dorsiflexion movements also triggered flexor reflexes in 3
      subjects, although greater loads were required to trigger such reflexes using
      dorsiflexion movements (compared to plantarflexion movements). These three-joint 
      reflex torque patterns triggered by ankle movement were broadly comparable to
      flexion withdrawal responses elicited by electrocutaneous stimuli applied to a
      toe, although the amplitude of the torque response was generally lower. We
      conclude that excitation of muscle and joint-related afferents induced by
      end-range movements may be responsible for exaggerated flexion reflex responses
      in spinal cord injury.

TI  - Addiction: part II. Identification and management of the drug-seeking patient.
PG  - 2401-8
AB  - The medications most often implicated in prescription drug abuse are opioid
      analgesics, sedative-hypnotics and stimulants. Patients with acute or chronic
      pain, anxiety disorders and attention-deficit disorder are at increased risk of
      addiction comorbidity. It is important to ask patients about their substance-use 
      history, including alcohol, illicit drugs and prescription drugs. Patients who
      abuse prescription drugs may exhibit certain patterns, such as escalating use,
      drug-seeking behavior and doctor shopping. A basic clinical survival skill in
      situations in which patients exert pressure on the physician to obtain a
      prescription drug is to say "no" and stick with it. Physicians who overprescribe 
      can be characterized by the four "Ds"-dated, duped, dishonest and disabled.
      Maintaining a current knowledge base, documenting the decisions that guide the
      treatment process and seeking consultation are important risk-management
      strategies that improve clinical care and outcomes.

TI  - Epilepsy in elderly people.
PG  - 1441-6
AB  - The prevalence and incidence of epilepsy are highest in later life with around
      25% of new cases occurring in elderly people, many of whom will have concomitant 
      neurodegenerative, cerebrovascular, or neoplastic disease. Difficulties accepting
      the diagnosis are frequently compounded by its unpredictable nature. Those
      affected commonly lose confidence and independence. Seizures in older people can 
      result in physical injury, adding to low morale. Complete control is achievable
      in around 70% of patients with antiepileptic drug treatment. Optimum management
      requires rapid investigation, accurate diagnosis, effective treatment,
      sympathetic education, and assured support. The emergence of seizure disorders in
      old age places an increasing burden on health-care facilities and costs. A
      coordinated programme among health-care workers is advised to maintain the
      independence and improve the quality of life of this vulnerable patient
      population.

TI  - A review of the epidemiology and approaches to the treatment of social anxiety
      disorder.
PG  - 497-509
AB  - This review presents current literature on the epidemiology and treatment of
      social anxiety disorder (social phobia). This illness has been demonstrated to be
      the most common anxiety disorder with a 1-year prevalence of 7 to 8% and a
      lifetime prevalence of 13 to 14% in patients aged between 15 and 54 years. Social
      anxiety disorder can be classified into 2 subtypes, discrete and generalised.
      Morbidity is high with this disorder, and 70 to 80% of patients have co-morbid
      mental disorders. Although effective treatments are available, social anxiety
      disorder is under-recognised and under-treated. Treatments that have been
      systemically studied and have shown efficacy in patients with social anxiety
      disorder include pharmacotherapy (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
      monoamine oxidase inhibitors, reversible inhibitors of monoamine-A and
      benzodiazepines) and short term psychotherapies (cognitive behaviour therapy,
      social skills training and exposure in vivo therapy). Beta-blockers are useful in
      treating performance-related anxiety. Few published data are available on the
      treatment of social anxiety disorder with a combination of pharmacotherapy and
      psychotherapy. We conclude this review by discussing proposed algorithms for
      treating both subtypes of social anxiety disorder.

TI  - Baclofen increases the soleus stretch reflex threshold in the early swing phase
      during walking in spastic multiple sclerosis patients.
PG  - 105-14
AB  - The effect of baclofen on walking performance was examined in nine spastic
      multiple sclerosis patients. In addition, nine healthy subjects were tested as
      controls. The modulation of the short latency soleus stretch reflex was closer to
      normal with baclofen compared to the recordings without baclofen, the modulation 
      index being 74% (range: 60 - 100) with baclofen and 62% (range: 20 - 100) without
      baclofen, P=0.03. In healthy subjects the modulation index was 100% (range: 52 - 
      100). In the early swing phase the threshold of the soleus stretch reflex was
      significantly higher during baclofen medication being 139 deg/s (range: 63 - 302)
      compared with 93 deg/s (range: 37 - 187) without baclofen, P=0.004. The relation 
      between the stretch velocity (input) and the amplitude of the stretch reflex
      (output) in early swing phase was unchanged being 0. 27 microVs/deg (range: 0.1 -
      1.51) in patients with baclofen and 0. 24 microVs/deg (range: 0.08 - 0.79)
      without baclofen, P=0.25. Baclofen induced no change in input - output properties
      of the stretch reflex during walking compared with findings in a sitting position
      at matched EMG activity. There was a significant correlation between clinical
      spasticity score and stretch reflex threshold in the early swing phase
      (rho=-0.61, P=0.04) and between clinical spasticity score and the slope of the
      best linear fit in the early swing phase (rho=0.72, P=0.009).

TI  - Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) with resistance to local anesthetic block: 
      a case report.
PG  - 67-71
AB  - We present a case of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) Type 1 in a
      12-year-old girl. The patient did not respond to the usual therapeutic modalities
      used to treat CRPS, including physical therapy, lumbar sympathetic block,
      epidural local anesthetic block, intravenous lidocaine infusion, or other oral
      medications. Of note is the fact that, during epidural block, the patient
      demonstrated a resistance to local anesthetic neural blockade in the area of the 
      body involved with the pain problem. The mechanism of this resistance could be
      related to the changes in the dorsal horn cells of the spinal cord, secondary to 
      activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, which may play a role in the
      pathophysiology of this pain syndrome.

TI  - Prophylactic pharmacological treatment of chronic daily headache.
PG  - 83-102
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review all the prophylactic pharmacological treatments for chronic 
      daily headache from the past decade. BACKGROUND: Chronic daily headache is among 
      the most common diagnoses seen in specialized headache centers. Prior to 1988,
      there were no criteria for the diagnosis of chronic tension-type headache and
      chronic daily headache. An expanded chronic daily headache classification has
      been proposed. METHODS: A MEDLINE search was performed using the following key
      words: chronic daily headache, intractable headache, transformed migraine,
      chronic tension headache, and chronic tension-type headache. We limited our
      review to those studies published in English in the last decade, including
      published abstracts and letters to the editor. Double-blind studies carried out
      prior to 1988 were also included. RESULTS: Pharmacological treatments for chronic
      daily headache include antidepressants (tricyclics, tetracyclics, monoamine
      oxidase inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), anticonvulsants,
      muscle relaxants, 5-HT1 agonists, ergots, 5-HT2 antagonists, antianxiety agents, 
      and miscellaneous drugs. Many of these reports are anecdotal, and most are open
      rather than double-blind studies. CONCLUSIONS: There is a great variety of
      pharmacological treatments available for chronic daily headache. Only the
      antidepressants have been extensively studied. Other medications may be used if
      these fail. Recommendations based on our experience at the Headache Unit of the
      Montefiore Medical Center are outlined here.

TI  - Headaches in a pediatric emergency department: etiology, imaging, and treatment.
PG  - 25-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the spectrum of diagnoses, the use of CT scans of the brain,
      and pharmacological treatments in patients presenting to a pediatric emergency
      department with headaches as the chief complaint. METHODS: A 1-year retrospective
      chart review of all children who presented to the emergency department with a
      headache as the chief complaint. RESULTS: One hundred thirty patients (0.7% of
      all pediatric emergency department visits, mean age = 9.3 years) were included in
      the study. Primary headaches included 11 migraine (8.5%) and 2 tension headaches 
      (1.5%). Most of the secondary nonneurological headaches were associated with
      viral and respiratory illnesses (n=37, 28.5%), while the majority of the
      secondary neurological headaches included 26 posttraumatic (20%), 15 possible
      ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunctions (11.5%), and 3 cases of aseptic
      meningitis (2.3%). The neurological etiology in 9 of these children (6.9%) was
      found to be serious (subdural hematoma, epidural hematoma, proven
      ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction, brain abscess, pseudotumor cerebri, and
      aseptic meningitis). Fifteen patients could not be etiologically classified,
      either because no specific etiology was found or their discharge diagnoses could 
      not clearly explain the headache. Approximately 10% (5/53) of the CT scans of the
      head that were performed showed new abnormal findings including hydrocephalus
      secondary to ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction (2), subdural hematoma (1),
      epidural hematoma (1), and skull fracture (1). Forty-two patients (32%) were
      treated pharmacologically. Thirty-nine of the 42 treated patients (93%) were
      given over-the-counter analgesics, and 9 (21%) were given prescribed analgesics. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the headaches in the pediatric emergency department 
      were secondary to concurrent illness and minor head trauma, and required no
      pharmacological treatment or only treatment with minor analgesics. In a small
      minority of patients, headaches were secondary to serious neurological
      conditions, which required immediate medical attention. Computed tomography scans
      showed new abnormalities in a minority of patients and should be reserved for
      those with neurological diagnoses such as head trauma and ventriculoperitoneal
      shunt, as well as for those patients with recent onset of headaches with no clear
      etiological explanation, and for those with high-risk medical conditions, such as
      hypocoagulabilities. Future prospective studies are needed to assess the efficacy
      of the various pharmacological treatments in this population.

TI  - Regional and racial differences in response to antihypertensive medication use in
      a randomized controlled trial of men with hypertension in the United States.
      Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study Group on Antihypertensive
      Agents.
PG  - 825-31
AB  - BACKGROUND: Stroke incidence and mortality rates are higher in the southeastern
      region of the United States, which is called the "Stroke Belt." We compared the
      response to antihypertensive medication use in patients from different US
      regions. METHODS: The short-term and 1-year efficacy of the antihypertensive
      medications hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, diltiazem hydrochloride (sustained
      release), captopril, prazosin hydrochloride, and clonidine was compared by US
      region in a randomized controlled trial of 1,105 men with hypertension from 15 US
      Veterans Affairs medical centers. RESULTS: Compared with patients outside the
      Stroke Belt, patients inside the Stroke Belt achieved significantly lower
      treatment success rates of diastolic blood pressure control at 1 year with
      hydrochlorothiazide (63% vs 41%), atenolol (62% vs 46%), captopril (60% vs 30%), 
      and clonidine (69% vs 43%); there were no differences in treatment success rates 
      with diltiazem (70% vs 71%) or prazosin (54% vs 53%). When controlling for race, 
      patients inside the Stroke Belt had significantly lower treatment success rates
      with hydrochlorothiazide (P = .003) and clonidine (P = .003), and the lower
      success rate with atenolol approached significance (P = .15). Regardless of
      region, blacks were less likely than whites to achieve treatment success with
      atenolol (P = .02) or prazosin (P = .03) and more likely with diltiazem (P =
      .05). There was a trend for blacks residing inside the Stroke Belt to have a
      lower treatment success rate than other race-region groups when treated with
      captopril (P = .07). Many regional and racial differences in diet, lifestyle, and
      other characteristics were observed. After adjustment for these characteristics
      by regression analysis, the effect of residing inside the Stroke Belt remained
      for captopril (P = .01) and clonidine (P = .01) and approached significance for
      hydrochlorothiazide (P = .10). CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension in patients residing
      inside the Stroke Belt responded less to the use of several antihypertensive
      medications and important differences were shown in a number of characteristics
      that may affect the control of blood pressure, compared with patients residing
      outside the Stroke Belt.

TI  - Comparative study of the efficacy and safety of trazodone versus clorazepate in
      the treatment of adjustment disorders in cancer patients: a pilot study.
PG  - 264-72
AB  - The efficacy of trazodone (mean once-daily dose 111.5 +/- 36.3 mg) versus
      clorazepate (mean once-daily dose 17.5 +/- 7.5 mg) to relieve anxious and
      depressive symptoms in 18 patients undergoing treatment for breast cancer was
      investigated in a 28-day randomized, double-blind study. Efficacy was evaluated
      using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Revised Symptom Checklist
      and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of
      Life Questionnaire. A successful response to treatment was achieved in 91%
      (10/11) of patients who received trazodone and 57% (four of seven) of patients
      who were administered clorazepate (P = 0.1373). Bayesian analysis revealed that
      the prior probability of making a wrong decision in prescribing trazodone rather 
      than clorazepate reduced from 26% to 8%. Assessment of the clinical scales
      suggested a benefit of trazodone compared with clorazepate, although the
      differences were not significant. Safety of both treatments was similar.
      Trazodone is devoid of an abuse risk and dependence and, therefore, could be a
      valuable alternative to clorazepate in the treatment of adjustment disorders in
      cancer patients.

AB  - Continuous intrathecal baclofen infusion (CIBI) is a relatively new treatment
      modality for severe spasticity of spinal cord origin. Literature review suggests 
      relief of severe spasms and rigidity is proven with CIBI, in patients with spinal
      cord injury and multiple sclerosis, while ongoing research exists for patients
      with acquired brain injury and cerebral palsy. Criteria for patient selection,
      the screening trial process, an outline of the surgical procedure, and
      generalities of maintenance therapies, will be reviewed broadly as per
      literature, as well as specifically to the Vancouver experience with adults.
      Additionally, reported patient outcomes and implications for nursing will be
      shared.

AB  - Drugs modulating the levels of specific central neurotransmitters may influence
      both the rate and amount of functional recovery after focal brain injuries such
      as stroke. Because such drugs may be effective long after brain injury, the
      "therapeutic window" may be widened beyond the first few hour after stroke and an
      entirely new avenue for pharmacological intervention may be possible. The impact 
      of drugs affecting norepinephrine and gamma-aminobutyric acid have been among the
      most extensively studied in the laboratory, and preliminary clinical data suggest
      similar effects in humans.

TI  - Analgesic effects of botulinum toxin A: a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical
      trial.
PG  - 116-21
AB  - Postoperative pain in children with spastic cerebral palsy (CP) is often
      attributed to muscle spasm and is difficult to manage using opiates and
      benzodiazepines. Adductor-release surgery to treat or prevent hip dislocation in 
      children with spastic CP is frequently performed and is often accompanied by
      severe postoperative pain and spasm. A double-blinded, randomized,
      placebo-controlled clinical trial of 16 patients (mean age 4.7 years) with a
      mainly spastic type of CP (either diplegic or quadriplegic in distribution) was
      used to test the hypothesis that a significant proportion of postoperative pain
      is secondary to muscle spasm and, therefore, might be reduced by a preoperative
      chemodenervation of the target surgical muscle by intramuscular injection of
      botulinum toxin A (BTX/A). Compared with the placebo, BTX/A was found to be
      associated with a reduction in mean pain scores of 74% (P<0.003), a reduction in 
      mean analgesic requirements of approximately 50% (P<0.005), and a reduction in
      mean length of hospital admission of 33% (P<0.003). It was concluded that an
      important component of postoperative pain in the patient population is due to
      muscle spasm and this can be managed effectively by preoperative injection with
      BTX/A. These findings may have implications for the management of pain secondary 
      to muscle spasm in other clinical settings.

TI  - Adverse effects associated with the intrathecal administration of ziconotide.
PG  - 291-6
AB  - The omega-conopeptide, ziconotide, is an N-type calcium-channel blocker that has 
      been shown to produce antinociception in animals using formalin and hot-plate
      tests. Initial reports of intrathecal administration of ziconotide in cancer and 
      AIDS patients whose pain was unrelieved with opioids demonstrated analgesic
      efficacy. Although adverse effects were reported, these appeared to be easily
      managed through dose reduction or symptomatic treatment. This clinical report
      describes the experiences of three patients with serious adverse effects
      associated with intrathecal ziconotide.

TI  - Pain and allodynia/hyperalgesia induced by intramuscular injection of serotonin
      in patients with fibromyalgia and healthy individuals.
PG  - 31-9
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of injection of serotonin
      (5-HT) into the masseter muscle on pain and allodynia/hyperalgesia. Twelve female
      patients with fibromyalgia (FM) and 12 age-matched female healthy individuals
      (HI) participated in the study. The current pain intensity (CPI) and the pressure
      pain threshold (PPT) of the superficial masseter muscles were assessed
      bilaterally. 5-HT in one of three randomized concentrations (10(-3), 10(-5),
      10(-7) M) or isotonic saline was then injected into either of the two masseter
      muscles in a double-blind manner. After the injections the CPI and PPT were
      recorded ten times during 30 min. The injections were repeated twice with the
      other concentrations of 5-HT after 1 and 2 weeks, respectively. In the FM-group
      there was a non-significant increase of CPI after injection that lasted during
      the entire 30-min period irrespective of whether 5-HT or saline was injected.
      Neither did the PPT change significantly. In the HI-group pain developed
      significantly after injection irrespective of whether 5-HT or saline was
      injected, but significantly more so after 5-HT at 10(-3) M than saline injection.
      CPI decreased quickly and then remained on a very low level for most of the
      experiment. 5-HT at both 10(-5) M and 10(-3) M caused a significantly greater
      decrease of PPT than saline. In conclusion, our results show that 5-HT injected
      into the masseter muscle of healthy female subjects elicits pain and
      allodynia/hyperalgesia, while no such responses occur in patients with
      fibromyalgia.

AB  - Trigeminal neuralgia was the focus of a recent workshop convened by the National 
      Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and the National Institute
      of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR). The workshop brought together basic 
      scientists, clinicians, epidemiologists, and patient advocates. New research
      directions for epidemiology, diagnosis and assessment, pain mechanisms, and
      treatment were identified. (The workshop was held in Rockville MD on September
      14, 1999, with financial support from NINDS, NIDCR, the NIH Office of Rare
      Diseases, and the NIH Pain Research Consortium.)

TI  - Efficacy and safety of trazodone versus clorazepate in the treatment of
      HIV-positive subjects with adjustment disorders: a pilot study.
PG  - 223-32
AB  - The efficacy of trazodone and clorazepate to relieve anxiety and depressive
      symptoms in 21 HIV-positive subjects with adjustment disorders was determined in 
      a 28-day single-centre, randomized, double-blind study. Subjects were evaluated
      using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Revised Symptom Checklist,
      the European Organization for Research and the Treatment of Cancer Quality of
      Life Questionnaire, and a binary criterion based on the Clinical Global
      Impression. The incidence of successful treatment was 80% for trazodone compared 
      with 64% for clorazepate; the sample number was too small to establish a
      significant difference. Bayesian analysis revealed the probability of making a
      wrong decision in prescribing trazodone rather than clorazepate reduced from 35% 
      to 18% in this small sample. Clinical evaluations using the different scales
      suggest some benefit from trazodone, although this was not significant. Safety of
      both treatments was similar. Trazodone is devoid of the risk of abuse and
      dependence, and may be a valuable alternative to benzodiazepines for the
      treatment of HIV-related adjustment disorders.

TI  - The efficacy of newer antidepressants in the treatment of chronic pain: a review 
      of current literature.
PG  - 257-77
AB  - Tricyclic antidepressants have been extensively studied and frequently used in
      the treatment of various chronic pain syndromes. Newer antidepressants, namely
      fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, fluvoxamine, citalopram, trazodone,
      nefazodone, bupropion, mirtazapine, and venlafaxine, have also been considered
      for this indication, although they have been less extensively studied. This
      article reviews the available publications, including placebo-controlled trials, 
      other outcome studies, and case reports, pertaining to the use of these
      medications for chronic pain. Although some of these newer compounds may be
      effective for specific types of pain, making generalizations regarding their use 
      as analgesics is difficult, given the limitations of existing data. Additional
      observations based on the data are presented in the hope that they may help to
      guide further research and clinical use.

TI  - Effectiveness of rehabilitation for spinal pain.
PG  - 63-81
AB  - The evidence for effectiveness of different approaches is often diluted by the
      inclusion of heterogeneous groups and, in this case, lack of agreement over what 
      constitutes 'acute' and 'chronic' back pain is a clear confounding factor.
      Although there are undoubtedly common issues in the approach to these problems,
      there are also clear differences. Closer definition of the problem and the
      development of specific and targeted outcome measures is required. In common with
      other areas of musculoskeletal rehabilitation, the evidence strongly supports
      exercise (except possibly in the rare case of true radicular back pain) and a
      cognitive behavioural approach to pain management. The variability of evidence in
      support of manipulation suggests that patient selection is important, but as yet 
      those selection criteria are not clear. As is often the case, medical
      interventions are rarely submitted to evaluation in terms of functional outcome
      so, for procedures such as epidurals and facet joint injections, the jury is
      still out at the current time.

TI  - Treatment alternatives for spinal cord injury related spasticity.
PG  - 199-217
AB  - Spasticity is a disorder of the motor system that occurs after injury to the
      central nervous system, which may increase the disability of an individual with
      spinal cord injury (SCI). Treatment options detailed in this review include
      rehabilitation techniques and modalities, pharmacological options, injection
      techniques, intrathecal baclofen, and surgery. This review will hopefully help
      health professionals to be aware of the treatment alternatives available for
      patients with SCI related spasticity.

AB  - Electrophysiological monitoring of selected neural pathways of the brain,
      brainstem, spinal cord and peripheral nervous system has become mandatory in some
      surgery of the nervous system where preventable neural injury can occur. Evoked
      potentials are relatively simple methods of testing the integrity of various
      aspects of the nervous system. This review covers the variety of evoked
      potentials that can be monitored and outlines the principles of their
      measurement. Their use in specific situations and how factors such as anaesthesia
      might affect them is presented.

TI  - Intrathecal catheter with subcutaneous port for clonidine test bolus injection. A
      new route and type of treatment for detrusor hyperreflexia in spinal cord-injured
      patients.
PG  - 14-7
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to assess the
      feasibitity, technical data and use of intrathecal catheter implantation with
      subcutaneous port for clonidine test injections and individual evaluation.
      METHODS: According to approval of the local ethics committee, 9 consecutive SCI
      patients (6 men, 3 women) had catheter and port implantation between January 1998
      and May 1999. All did not respond to systemic drug therapy in combination to
      self-clean intermittent catheterisation (SCIC). Implantation was done under
      general anesthesia. Needle and catheter were Medtronic Infusion Synchromed
      Intraspinal catheter (Induratrade mark, 8703W). Clonidine test injections were
      allowed at D5. RESULTS: There were no complications during operation. Follow-up
      was 8.2 months (0.5-17). After clonidine bolus injection test and validation, 6
      patients decided to have permanent pump implantation, 2 chose other therapies and
      one did not tolerate clonidine intrathecal injections for blood arterial pressure
      side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Intrathecal clonidine may represent a useful
      conservative treatment of both severe bladder hyperreflexia and spinal
      spasticity. Its short-term effects can be individually evaluated through bolus
      injection in subcutaneous port before definitive pump implantation.

TI  - Refractory epilepsy: treatment with new antiepileptic drugs.
PG  - 51-7
AB  - Five antiepileptic drugs have been marketed in the last decade. We report here a 
      retrospective study of patients attending our unit who were prescribed one of the
      new antiepileptic drugs. All these patients had refractory localization related
      epilepsy and had failed to respond to a first-line drug. The drugs had a
      different profile of side-effects but topiramate (42%) was the most common drug
      to be withdrawn due to side-effects as compared with tiagabine (26%), vigabatrin 
      (16%), gabapentin (16%), and lamotrigine (15%). With regard to efficacy, 31% of
      the patients receiving gabapentin had a greater than 50% reduction in seizures
      compared with lamotrigine (25%), topiramate (20%), vigabatrin (19%) and tiagabine
      (11%). The number of patients remaining seizure free with gabapentin was 8%
      whilst for lamotrigine this was 5%, vigabatrin 5%, topiramate 1% and tiagabine
      4%. In conclusion, all these five antiepileptic drugs are useful in treating
      refractory localization related epilepsy.

TI  - Cardiac drug and psychotropic drug interactions: significance and
      recommendations.
PG  - 408-29
AB  - Understanding cardiac drug interactions with concurrent psychotropic
      prescriptions is essential for the practicing cardiologist and primary care
      physician, as well as for the psychiatrist. There has been an explosive use of
      new drugs in both psychiatry and cardiology without widespread knowledge of their
      potential interactions. The increasing tendency toward poly-pharmacy, the use of 
      psychotropic medications by cardiologists and primary care physicians caring for 
      cardiac patients, and the growth of the aging population present major challenges
      for the practitioner. Finally, there is a need to have models/paradigms for
      predicting potential drug interactions--e.g., the Cytochrome p450 schema. This
      paper describes a method to identify, understand, and codify the interactions
      between psychotropic and cardiac drugs, a systematic approach for updating this
      key database and specific cardiac-psychotropic drug interactions. Specifically,
      this paper 1) details the interactions, 2) addresses the level of their clinical 
      significance, 3) describes the potential mechanism(s) of the interactions, and 4)
      offers recommendations to the clinician. Since the majority of the original
      clinical trials, either for cardiac medications or psychotropic drugs, do not
      include studies comparing these two drug domains contemporaneously, their
      interactions often become known only with their combined use in the clinical
      arena, using the patient as "guinea pig," and through subsequent reporting.

TI  - Neck pain. Primary care work-up of acute and chronic symptoms.
PG  - 47-8, 51-4, 57
AB  - Acute or chronic neck pain can arise from degenerative processes, musculoskeletal
      trauma, or structural changes. For all patients presenting with neck pain,
      determining the presence of radiculopathy or myelopathy is an important step in
      initial assessment. Depending on the duration of pain, the work-up should include
      appropriate use of traditional and advanced imaging studies. For cases that do
      not suggest traumatic, structural, or rheumatologic origins, alternate
      considerations should include stress, depression, and--because of its increased
      incidence in older persons--cancer. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, mild
      oral analgesics, and short-term corticosteroid therapy are the mainstays of
      treatment, although physical therapy and traction can be helpful for some
      patients. The presence of a herniated disk, cord compression (severe stenosis),
      tumor, or other structural lesion may require surgical decompression.

TI  - Continuous intrathecal pump infusion of baclofen with antibiotic drugs for
      treatment of pump-associated meningitis. Case report.
PG  - 347-9
AB  - Intrathecal baclofen administered by means of an implantable pump is being
      increasingly used for successful treatment of spasticity. Meningitis following
      intrathecally administered baclofen is a rare but serious complication that is
      difficult to treat without removal of the pump. Because success rates with
      intravenously administered antibiotic drugs for the treatment of meningitis have 
      been low, intrathecal administration of antibiotic agents is often required to
      eradicate the pathogen. The authors report the case of a patient in whom
      Staphylococcus epidermidis meningitis developed after insertion of an intrathecal
      baclofen pump. The patient was successfully treated by intrathecal
      coadministration of vancomycin and baclofen.

TI  - Management of eclampsia in the accident and emergency department.
PG  - 7-11
AB  - Eclampsia is defined as the occurrence of seizures in pregnancy or within 10 days
      of delivery, accompanied by at least two of the following features documented
      within 24 hours of the seizure: hypertension, proteinuria, thrombocytopenia or
      raised aspartate amino transferase. Eclampsia complicates approximately one in
      2,000 pregnancies in the United Kingdom and it remains one of the main causes of 
      maternal death. Up to 38% of cases of eclampsia can occur without premonitory
      signs or symptoms of pre-eclampsia-that is, hypertension, proteinuria, and
      oedema. Only 38% of eclamptic seizures occur antepartum; 18% occur during labour 
      and a further 44% occur postpartum. Rare cases of eclampsia have occurred over a 
      week after delivery. Outcome is poor for mother and child. Almost one in 50 women
      suffering eclamptic seizures die, 23% will require ventilation and 35% will have 
      at least one major complication including pulmonary oedema, renal failure,
      disseminated intravascular coagulation, HELLP syndrome, acute respiratory
      distress syndrome, stroke, or cardiac arrest. Stillbirth or neonatal death occurs
      in approximately one in 14 cases of eclampsia. Up to one third of eclamptic
      seizures occur out of hospital. For this reason, initial management may involve
      accident and emergency departments. Early involvement of senior obstetric staff
      is crucial. Optimal emergency management of seizures, hypertension, fluid balance
      and subsequent safe transfer is essential to minimise morbidity and mortality.

TI  - Clonazepam and sertraline: absence of drug interaction in a multiple-dose study.
PG  - 19-27
AB  - Thirteen subjects (seven men, six women) completed a placebo-controlled,
      randomized, double-blind, crossover study to determine whether an interaction
      occurs between clonazepam and sertraline. Ten days of once-daily doses of either 
      clonazepam 1 mg and placebo (CZ + PL) or clonazepam 1 mg and sertraline 100 mg
      (CZ + SR) were administered; there was an 11-day washout period. Sertraline did
      not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of clonazepam (p > 0.13).
      Clonazepam apparent oral clearance, volume of distribution, and half-life were
      3.9 +/- 0.2 L/hr, 233 +/-11 L, and 40.5 +/- 0.3 hours, respectively. The kinetics
      of the inactive metabolite 7-aminoclonazepam were marginally affected by
      sertraline, with a 21% decrease in the elimination half-life (p = 0.03) relative 
      to CZ + PL and no significant difference between treatments in area under the
      curve or metabolite ratio. Card sorting (CS), digit-symbol substitution test
      (DSST), nurse-rated sedation scale (NRSS), and self-rated sedation scores were
      assessed four times daily on days -1 (PL + PL), 1, 4, 7, and 10. There were no
      differences between treatments in area under the effect curve or maximum observed
      effect for CS, DSST, or NRSS. Maximum impairment on all assessment days was low, 
      with a less than 10% change from the drug-free values for CS and DSST. Despite
      higher clonazepam concentrations, predose (time 0) psychomotor and sedation
      scores did not differ among days -1, 1, 4, 7, and 10 or between treatments. These
      results in healthy volunteers indicate that sertraline does not affect the
      pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of clonazepam.

TI  - A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of abecarnil and diazepam in the
      treatment of patients with generalized anxiety disorder.
PG  - 12-8
AB  - In a multicenter, double-blind trial, 310 patients who had received a diagnosis
      of generalized anxiety disorder were treated for 6 weeks with either abecarnil,
      diazepam, or placebo at mean daily doses of 12 mg of abecarnil or 22 mg of
      diazepam administered three times daily. Patients who were improved at 6 weeks
      could volunteer to continue double-blind treatment for a total of 24 weeks. The
      maintenance treatment phase allowed the comparison of taper results for the three
      treatments at several study periods (0-6 weeks, 7-12 weeks, and more than 12
      weeks). Slightly more diazepam (77%) and placebo (75%) patients completed the
      6-week study than abecarnil patients (66%). At intake and baseline, after a
      1-week placebo washout, the patient was required to have a Hamilton Rating Scale 
      for Anxiety score of > or =20. Major adverse events for both abecarnil and
      diazepam were drowsiness, dizziness, fatigue, and coordination difficulties.
      Clinical improvement data showed that both abecarnil and diazepam produced
      statistically significantly more symptom relief than did placebo after 1 week of 
      treatment. At 6 weeks treatment (using last observation carried forward
      analysis), however, only diazepam still differed significantly (p < 0.01) from
      placebo. High placebo response (56% moderate to marked global improvement) at 6
      weeks, as well as a slightly lower nonsignificant improvement rate observed with 
      abecarnil, a partial y-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist, when compared with
      diazepam, a full GABA agonist, most likely contributed to our findings. Finally, 
      taper results showed that only diazepam and not abecarnil caused the presence of 
      temporary discontinuation symptoms, but only in patients who had been treated for
      at least 12 weeks.

TI  - Intravenous valproate in neuropsychiatry.
PG  - 88-92
AB  - Valproic acid (VPA) is administered for a variety of indications in neurology and
      psychiatry. The intravenous form of VPA, valproate, has been used extensively by 
      neurologists since the 1980s for patients with status epilepticus, as serum
      levels can be achieved rapidly and telemetry is not required during
      administration. Psychiatrists have less experience with intravenous valproate,
      and little is documented in the literature regarding its nonepileptic
      indications. Patients who are unable or unwilling to take drugs orally, or for
      whom rapid treatment is clinically indicated, may benefit from VPA. Neuroleptics 
      and benzodiazepines often are given parenterally; however, they may be
      accompanied by side effects. Intravenous valproate was administered successfully 
      to three patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. It is hoped that this report
      will increase clinicians' awareness of this important and well-tolerated
      treatment option.

TI  - Neuronal death after brain injury. Models, mechanisms, and therapeutic strategies
      in vivo.
PG  - 383-95
AB  - Neuronal damage in the central nervous system leads to primary cell death,
      induced directly by the trauma, and delayed secondary death of neurons, the
      latter depending on environmental changes, lack of metabolic and trophic supply, 
      and altered gene transcription. While primary death of neurons occurring within a
      short time after trauma is not a realistic target for therapy, secondary cell
      death might be prevented by new neuroprotective strategies. Although there are
      increasing data concerning cell rescue after ischemic and traumatic brain injury 
      through the last decade, the mechanisms that underlie secondary death of neurons 
      following lesion are still incompletely understood and are now the subject of a
      more detailed investigation. In this review, we want to give an overview on what 
      is known about the molecular mechanisms of delayed ischemic and traumatic
      neuronal death in vivo and about promising neuroprotective treatment strategies
      that might be of future clinical relevance or have already entered clinical
      trials.

TI  - Pain management of junctional epidermolysis bullosa in an 11-year-Old boy.
PG  - 465-8
AB  - Epidermolysis bullosa is a group of hereditary blistering disorders for which
      there is no definitive therapy. Wound care is an important component of
      management. Regular dressing changes are required to protect blistered and eroded
      skin, and to prevent secondary infection and sepsis. These dressing changes can
      be very painful for patients with extensive erosions. We report our experience of
      pain management in an 11-year-old boy with severe junctional epidermolysis
      bullosa. Amitryptiline and cognitive behavioral techniques were effective in
      relieving chronic pain and discomfort. Oral midazolam 0.33 mg/kg administered 20 
      minutes prior to baths and dressing changes substantially improved his tolerance 
      of wound care.

TI  - Measurement of the effect of a bolus dose of intrathecal baclofen by a repetitive
      movement test.
PG  - 1080-5
AB  - We assessed the repetitive movement (RM) test for measuring the effect of a trial
      bolus dose of intrathecal baclofen on spasticity. The RM test measures passive
      range of motion (ROM) by electrogoniometry and stretch reflex activity (SRA) of
      the flexors and extensors of the knee and ankle by surface electromyography. The 
      SRA has a dynamic component (dynamic stretch reflex, DSR) and a tonic component
      (tonic stretch reflex, TSR). Four hypotheses were formulated: (a) RM results show
      a negative relationship between SRA and ROM; (b) values on the RM test are
      correlated with clinical scores of tonus and spasticity; (c) RM results show a
      reduction in SRA after administration of the clinically optimal dose of baclofen;
      and (d) RM results show a dose-dependent effect of intrathecal baclofen on SRA.
      Twenty-four patients were selected because they had impairments and disabilities 
      caused by intractable spasticity. A bolus of baclofen was administered with
      incremental doses (25-150 micrograms) until an optimal effect or no effect was
      obtained. The main outcome measures were RM test and clinical assessments of the 
      Ashworth and spasm score. The results were (a) For the ankle a negative
      correlation was found between ROM and TSR of the flexor and extensors; for the
      knee a significant negative correlation was found only with the DSR of the biceps
      femoris. (b) A positive correlation was found between the Ashworth score and TSR 
      of the extensors and between the spasm score and DSR and TSR of the gastrocnemius
      muscle. (c) Significant differences were found between baseline measurements and 
      the optimal dose of baclofen for all measures. (d) A significant dose-dependent
      effect of intrathecal baclofen on the level of SRA was observed. The RM test is
      thus a useful clinical tool for objectively measuring the effect of intrathecal
      baclofen administration on spasticity in patients with an upper motor neuron
      syndrome.

TI  - Stereotactic surgery: what is past is prologue.
PG  - 16-27
AB  - Two old and simple simple concepts, a three-dimensional positioning stage and a
      coordinate system, were combined in 1906 to create a new one: the stereotactic
      method. For 25 years, it found little application until it was rediscovered for
      investigations in small animals. After the first human subcortical stereotactic
      procedure was performed in 1947, stereotactic methods found greatest application 
      in the placement of subcortical lesions in the treatment of movement disorders.
      Rapid advances in the development of instrumentation, methods, and understanding 
      of human neuroanatomy and neurophysiology resulted. However, a dormant period
      followed the introduction of L-dopa in 1968. The advent of computer-based medical
      imaging applied to the stereotactic method encouraged adaptation of stereotactic 
      methods to the management of intracranial tumors, the rapid development of new
      surgical hardware, and the rediscovery of old methods and evolution of new ones
      for the treatment of movement disorders. In addition, the incorporation of
      computer systems as stereotactic surgical instruments further increased the
      capabilities of stereotactic methods. Radiosurgical applications increased with
      the proliferation of gamma units and the development of linear accelerator-based 
      radiosurgical methods. Computers are used to fuse and reformat imaging databases 
      for surgical planning, simulation, and frameless stereotactic intraoperative
      guidance. As a result, surgical procedures have become more effective in meeting 
      preoperative goals and less invasive. Low-cost, high-speed, microprocessor-based 
      workstation computers and intuitive user interfaces have increased the acceptance
      into mainstream neurosurgery. It is anticipated that a significant portion of
      neurosurgery, and probably most surgical procedures in general, will comprise
      computer-based interventions guided by volumetric imaging-defined data sets
      acquired preoperatively or by intraoperative imaging systems. The stereotactic
      surgery of the future may employ all or a combination of the following
      technologies: frameless stereotactic surgery, robotic technology, microrobotic
      dexterity enhancement, and telepresence robotics.

TI  - Postictal psychosis in a child.
PG  - 818-9
AB  - Postictal psychoses are brief psychotic episodes that usually occur after poorly 
      controlled partial complex seizure clusters. The psychosis commonly appears
      following a lucid interval, ranging from a few hours to days after seizure
      termination. An underlying structural brain abnormality is common and usually
      involves the temporal lobe. Postictal psychosis, while well known in adults, has 
      not been described previously in children. We describe a 9-year-old boy with
      right hemiparesis due to a neonatal stroke, who developed a postictal
      schizophrenia-like psychosis following status epilepticus. Electroencephalography
      showed left-sided slowing. A brain computed tomographic scan and magnetic
      resonance imaging revealed left hemisphere hypoplasia. A 99mTc-ECD single photon 
      emission computed tomographic scan of the brain revealed decreased
      left-hemisphere perfusion, most pronounced to the medial temporal lobe. The
      psychosis resolved gradually over 7 days without antipsychotic therapy. To the
      best of our knowledge, this is the first description of postictal psychosis in a 
      child.

TI  - Appropriateness of medication selection for older persons in an urban academic
      emergency department.
PG  - 1232-42
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency of potentially inappropriate medication
      selection for older persons presenting to the ED, the most common problematic
      drugs, risk factors for suboptimal medication selection, and whether use of these
      medications is associated with worse outcomes. METHODS: The authors performed a
      prospective cohort study of 898 patients 65 years or older who presented to an
      urban academic ED in 1995 and 1996. Seventy-nine percent of the patients were
      African-American and 43% did not graduate from high school. Potentially
      inappropriate medications and adverse drug-disease interactions were identified
      using the 1997 Beers explicit criteria for elders. During the three months after 
      the initial visit, revisits to the ED or hospital, death, and changes in
      health-related quality of life were analyzed as measured by validated questions
      adapted from the Medical Outcomes Study. RESULTS: Upon presentation, 10.6% of the
      patients were taking a potentially inappropriate medication, 3.6% were given one 
      in the ED, and 5.6% were prescribed one upon discharge from the ED. The most
      frequently prescribed potentially inappropriate medications in the ED were
      diphenhydramine, indomethacin, meperidine, and cyclobenzaprine. Emergency
      physicians added potentially inappropriate medications most often to patients
      with discharge diagnoses of musculoskeletal disorder, back pain, gout, and
      allergy or urticaria. Potentially adverse drug-disease interactions were
      relatively uncommon at presentation (5.2%), in the ED (0.6%), and on discharge
      from the ED (1.2%). Potentially inappropriate medications and adverse
      drug-disease interactions prescribed in the ED were not associated with higher
      rates of revisit to the ED, hospitalization, or death, but were correlated with
      worse physical function and pain. However, confidence intervals were wide for
      analyses of revisits and death. CONCLUSIONS: Suboptimal medication selection was 
      fairly common and was associated with worse patient-reported health-related
      quality of life.

TI  - Transdermal histamine in multiple sclerosis: part one -- clinical experience.
PG  - 424-8
AB  - Histamine has a long history of therapeutic use in many diseases, including
      multiple sclerosis (MS). Recently, transdermal histamine has been successfully
      employed for the amelioration of symptoms of both relapsing-remitting and
      progressive multiple sclerosis. This paper summarizes preliminary experiences
      with transdermal histamine for MS at the Tahoma Clinic: 67 percent of 55 patients
      using histamine transdermal cream had improvements in one or more areas,
      including extremity strength, balance, bladder control, fatigue, activities of
      daily living, and cognitive functioning, sustained for periods of up to three
      months. One-third of patients had improvements in three or more areas of
      functioning. Five possible mechanisms of action are postulated: augmentation of
      subnormal cerebral tissue levels of histamine; improved electrical function of
      demyelinated fibers; increased cerebral blood flow; suppression of autoimmune
      responses; and stimulation of remyelination. These will be discussed in detail in
      Part 2 of this article.

TI  - Opsoclonus in a patient with cerebellar dysfunction.
PG  - 229-31
AB  - After two days of malaise, headache, nausea, and vomiting, a 26-year-old man
      suddenly developed opsoclonus and stance and gait ataxia, without myoclonus.
      Having excluded a paraneoplastic etiology, we assumed that the disorder was
      probably related to a viral infection. Spontaneous resolution occurred in about
      two months. Opsoclonus became flutter dysmetria and then resolved. Saccadic eye
      movement recording disclosed the occurrence of hypermetria, increased velocity,
      and delayed latency, which also resolved. In this patient, the correspondence
      between clinical and ocular motor abnormality courses suggests a transient
      cerebellar dysfunction as the possible pathophysiologic mechanism for opsoclonus.

TI  - Pheochromocytoma in Italy: a multicentric retrospective study.
PG  - 619-24
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To conduct an epidemiological study on pheochromocytoma in Italy.
      METHODS: Data on 284 patients with pheochromocytoma observed between 1978 and
      1997 were collected from 18 Italian centers through a questionnaire reporting
      epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological and surgical data. RESULTS:
      53.6% of the patients were females and 46.4% were males. Thirty-two tumors were
      discovered as incidental adrenal masses. The most frequent referred symptoms were
      palpitations (58.1%), headache (51.9%), sweating (48. 8%) and anxiety (35.3%).
      Their association was present only in 15.5% of patients. Paroxysmal symptoms were
      reported in 67.1% and hypertensive crises in 59.7% of patients. Normal blood
      pressure (systolic and diastolic) was present both in the supine and upright
      positions in 21.1% of patients. Among laboratory assays, urinary vanylmandelic
      acid (VMA) was the most widely used (58.1%) and was the least sensitive (25% of
      false negative results). Basal plasma catecholamines were found to be normal in
      11.3% of patients but were always elevated when sampled during a hypertensive
      paroxysm. A clonidine suppression test was performed in 38 patients with no
      adverse side effects. It gave a false negative response in 2 patients. A glucagon
      test was performed in 21 patients. It was interrupted for acute hypertension in
      52.4% of patients. Only 5/21 patients were normotensive and had normal basal
      plasma catecholamines. In these patients the test gave a positive response in
      four (80%). CT (79.6%) and I-MIBG scintigraphy (68.5%) were the most widely used 
      methods for tumor localization. CT sensitivity was 98.9% for intra-adrenal and
      90.9% for extra-adrenal tumors. MIBG sensitivity was 88.5%. In the 263 patients
      who underwent surgery, the tumor was intra-adrenal in 89.4%, extra-adrenal in
      8.5%, intra- and extra-adrenal in 2.1%, and bilateral in 11.0% of patients.
      Malignancy was reported in 9.9% of cases. Surgery caused remission of
      hypertension in 59.3%, improvement in 26.8%, and no changes in 13. 9% of
      patients. In the last group the interval between initial symptoms and diagnosis
      was significantly longer. CONCLUSIONS: The present study confirms that the
      clinical presentation of pheochromocytoma is variable and aspecific. Normotension
      is often present and often the tumor is discovered incidentally. An indication
      for the routine use of screening methods more sensitive than urinary VMA is
      strongly suggested. The clonidine test was found to be safe and should be
      preferred to the glucagon test which has to be restricted to very selected
      patients. CT and MIBG scintigraphy are almost always successful in localizing the
      tumor. Reversal of hypertension by surgery seems to depend on an early diagnosis.

TI  - Drug treatment of patients with insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness:
      pharmacokinetic considerations.
PG  - 305-30
AB  - Insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) are frequently observed
      conditions in the general public. A national survey in the USA in 1979 indicated 
      that 35% of American adults experience insomnia in the course of a year. The
      prevalence of EDS varies depending on the survey (0.3 to 13.3%), but a recent
      study stated that 2.4% of individuals reported that they continually fell asleep 
      at work. These problems are often long term and negatively affect the
      individuals' quality of life. People with these sleep problems often have
      difficulties maintaining high levels of productivity at work or pursuing their
      daily activities; individuals with insomnia lack the feeling of being rested or
      refreshed in the morning and EDS is unavoidable in most cases. Behavioural
      therapy has been shown to be effective for many people affected with insomnia and
      EDS. However, pharmacological treatments using hypnosedatives and central nervous
      system (CNS) stimulants are usually necessary, and effective, for those with more
      severe cases. These compounds have thus been widely prescribed in clinical
      practice (e.g., 2.6% of all adults surveyed used medically prescribed
      hypnosedatives and 4.5% used over-the-counter drugs to promote sleep). The onset 
      and duration of action of these hypnosedatives and CNS stimulant drugs are
      important factors to be considered when prescribing these compounds. These
      factors primarily depend on physicochemical properties (lipid solubility and
      protein binding), as well as the pharmacokinetic profile (absorption,
      distribution, elimination and clearance) of the compounds. Significant
      differences in profile exist amongst hypnosedatives and CNS stimulants, and these
      differences may account for the observed variations in clinical action and
      adverse effects during and after treatment. In this review, we will introduce
      recently obtained knowledge of the pharmacokinetics of hypnosedatives and CNS
      stimulants and their applications for patients affected with insomnia and EDS.

TI  - Anaesthesia and pain management in cerebral palsy.
PG  - 32-41
AB  - Cerebral palsy is the result of an injury to the developing brain during the
      antenatal, perinatal or postnatal period. Clinical manifestations relate to the
      area affected. Some of the conditions associated with cerebral palsy require
      surgical intervention. Problems during the peri-operative period may include
      hypothermia, nausea and vomiting and muscle spasm. Peri-operative seizure
      control, respiratory function and gastro-oesophageal reflux also require
      consideration. Intellectual disability is common and, in those affected, may
      range from mild to severe. These children should be handled with sensitivity as
      communication disorders and sensory deficits may mask mild or normal intellect.
      They should be accompanied by their carers at induction and in the recovery room 
      as they usually know how best to communicate with them. Postoperative pain
      management and the prevention of muscle spasm is important and some of the drugs 
      used in the management of spasm such as baclofen and botulinum toxin are
      discussed. Epidural analgesia is particularly valuable when major orthopaedic
      procedures are performed.

TI  - Peripheral and central effect of baclofen on ankle joint stiffness in multiple
      sclerosis.
PG  - 98-105
AB  - The effect of baclofen on the soleus stretch reflex and peripheral muscle
      function was tested in 10 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients with spasticity in the
      lower extremities. Peroral baclofen (15-60 mg daily) induced a decrease in the
      twitch torque of the soleus muscle elicited by supramaximal nerve stimulation.
      The torque was 15.1 +/- 5.5 Nm with baclofen and 17.1 +/- 5.0 Nm without baclofen
      (P = 0.03). The slope of the background torque/EMG relation was also changed from
      1.53 Nm/microV with baclofen to 1.13 NM/microV without it (P = 0.03), and the
      soleus stretch reflex threshold decreased from 11.4 degrees /s (3.1-62.8) to 6.2 
      degrees /s (3.1-25.1) without baclofen medication (P = 0.03) in the relaxed
      muscle. Furthermore, baclofen induced an approximately 20% decrease in the total 
      stiffness at the ankle joint at all contraction levels due to a decrease in the
      short-latency stretch reflex. From a clinical point of view, the peripheral
      action of baclofen may be unfortunate. Spasticity is often accompanied by
      weakness, which may be the major cause of any disability. Consequently, reduction
      in spasticity by the central effect of baclofen may be counteracted by its
      influence on muscle properties. In addition, treatment of spasticity by baclofen 
      may unmask weakness.

PG  - 688-91
AB  - We have compared the efficacy and safety of combined granisetron and droperidol
      with each anti-emetic alone for preventing post-operative nausea and vomiting
      after thyroidectomy. In a prospective, randomized, double-blind study, 180 women 
      received granisetron 40 micrograms kg-1, droperidol 20 micrograms kg-1, or
      granisetron 40 micrograms kg-1 plus droperidol 20 micrograms kg-1 (n = 60 of
      each) intravenously immediately before induction of anaesthesia. A standard
      general anaesthetic technique and post-operative analgesia were used. A complete 
      response, defined as no post-operative nausea and vomiting and no need for
      another rescue anti-emetic, during the first 24 h after anaesthesia occurred in
      88%, 60% and 98% of patients who had received granisetron, droperidol and
      granisetron plus droperidol (P < 0.05; overall Fisher's exact probability test). 
      No clinically important adverse events due to the drugs were observed in any of
      the groups. In summary, prophylactic use of combined granisetron and droperidol
      is more effective than each drug alone for the prevention of post-operative
      nausea and vomiting in female patients undergoing thyroidectomy.

TI  - Epidemiology and drug treatment of epilepsy in elderly people.
PG  - 255-69
AB  - Seizures are extremely common in the elderly, with an annual incidence reaching
      100 per 100000 people aged over 60 years. Most are precipitated by acute
      symptomatic illnesses such as stroke or systemic disease. Chronic neurological
      diseases such as Alzheimer's disease may also cause seizures. The aetiology of
      seizures in many patients is unknown. Seizures may be situational and subside
      quickly, but the prevalence of chronic seizures--epilepsy--is as high as 1% in
      the elderly. The majority of seizures are of partial onset, especially complex
      partial. Complex partial seizures at this age may be very subtle and hard to
      diagnose. Generalised-onset seizures also occur, perhaps as a result of diffuse
      changes with aging or degenerative disease or to a combination of genetic and
      environmental factors. The prognosis for complete seizure control in this
      population is relatively favourable. Physiological and disease-related changes
      with aging result in complex pharmacokinetics. Most changes lead to a need for
      gentler drug treatment with cautious initiation of drugs at lower dosages.
      Consideration must be given to renal and hepatic function, protein binding and
      drug interactions. Determinations of free (unbound) drug concentrations are
      helpful for highly protein bound drugs. The dosages of newer drugs excreted
      renally must be adjusted based on creatinine clearance. The dosage of most drugs 
      is determined empirically by careful observation of seizure control and adverse
      effects. Carbamazepine, valproic acid (sodium valproate), gabapentin and
      lamotrigine have certain theoretical advantages, but comparative trials of
      anticonvulsants in the elderly are needed. The ideal drug for older patients
      would be effective, without neurological toxicity, with low protein binding, a
      nonparticipant in drug interactions and amenable to once daily administration.

TI  - Long-term psychological and neurological complications of lindane poisoning.
PG  - 513-7
AB  - A thin, healthy, partial-vegetarian, white female, who was exposed to three doses
      of lindane (through the application of Kwell), developed a severe case of
      long-term lindane poisoning. Review of the literature suggests that her toxicity 
      was so severe because of the repetitive nature of her exposure and the fact that 
      she was partly protein restricted when first exposed. She developed profound
      central nervous system toxicity, as well as skin and gastrointestinal changes,
      that persisted for 20 months. She was treated with high doses of Valium. It was
      noted that every time her Valium was diminished below a critical level, her
      symptoms tended to recur until she had adequately cleared the lindane from her
      system. We believe this is the longest term of poisoning reported following
      exposure to an organochloride insecticide. Her symptoms are well explained by the

TI  - The effect of tiagabine on spasticity in children with intractable epilepsy: a
      pilot study.
PG  - 728-30
AB  - Preliminary pharmacologic evidence suggests that tiagabine, a new presynaptic
      gamma-aminobutyric acid-uptake inhibitor developed as an antiepileptic drug, may 
      also relieve spasticity. This pilot study assessed the drug's efficacy in 14
      children with congenital or acquired spastic quadriplegia and concomitant
      intractable epilepsy refractory to treatment with multiple antiepileptic drugs.
      The primary outcome variable was change in motor function; the secondary outcome 
      was change in seizure frequency. Tiagabine was initiated at 0.1-0.2 mg/kg/day and
      then gradually titrated upward until seizures ceased, adverse effects supervened,
      or the maximum dose of 1.1 mg/kg/day was reached. When a modified Ashworth scale 
      was used to assess motor function, a mean improvement of approximately 50% was
      observed. Common findings included improved tone, strength, coordination, range
      of motion, and relaxation of extremities, with less ataxia and wobbling. Mean
      reduction in seizure frequency was 50-74%. Randomized, double-blind controlled
      studies are needed to confirm the suggested efficacy of tiagabine in relieving
      chronic spasticity in children with neurodevelopmental disorders.

TI  - Treatment of cerebral origin spasticity with continuous intrathecal baclofen
      delivered via an implantable pump: long-term follow-up review of 18 patients.
PG  - 733-6
AB  - OBJECT: The goal of this study was to assess the long-term benefits of managing
      severe spasticity by using continuous infusion of intrathecal baclofen delivered 
      via an implantable pump. METHODS: Eighteen patients with severe spasticity of
      cerebral origin, who failed to respond adequately to more conservative
      treatments, have-been treated with continuous infusion of intrathecal baclofen
      delivered via an implanted pump. Follow-up review of these patients has lasted
      between 12 months and 9 years. The patients have been assessed using a variety of
      tools. Seventeen have had a significant reduction in tone and all have benefited 
      by a reduced need for nursing care or increased function or both. CONCLUSION:
      Long-term continuous infusion of intrathecal baclofen delivered via an
      implantable pump offers an effective method for dealing with otherwise
      intractable spasticity.

TI  - Evaluation and management of occupational low back disorders.
PG  - 94-111
AB  - This clinical practice review of occupational low back disorders describes
      work-related risk factors, occupational history, physical evaluation, clinical
      tests, diagnosis, care, and prevention. It is part of a quality assurance (QA)
      and quality improvement (QI) effort to establish exemplary occupational practice 
      standards. It emphasizes the involvement of occupational medicine physicians in
      exposure assessment, care of injured workers, and disease prevention. Important
      occupational risk factors such as lifting, awkward body posture and vibration, in
      addition to psychosocial, socio-economic and other factors are summarized. The
      focus is on mechanical back disorders. Return-to-work, rehabilitation and
      prevention strategies are discussed as part of integrated disability management
      involving the injured worker, the primary care provider, employers and other
      relevant parties.

TI  - The treatment of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder. An
      American Academy of Sleep Medicine Review.
PG  - 970-99
AB  - A task force consisting of six authors reviewed the published literature on the
      therapy of the restless legs syndrome or periodic limb movements in sleep
      available in indices through April, 1998. They selected the 45 articles for
      detailed review which presented original investigations of therapeutic impact on 
      the restless legs syndrome (RLS) or periodic limb movements (PLM) and which met
      minimal standards. These articles dealt with a range of pharmacological and other
      treatment modalities, although most dealt with medications and almost half of
      those concentrated on dopaminergic agents, especially levodopa in various
      formulations. Almost half of the articles reviewed used controlled methodologies,
      most commonly cross-over methodologies with randomized allocation of subjects.
      Multi-center studies with large numbers of subjects and long-term controlled
      studies were not found. Information was extracted from the articles and study
      design, clinical definition, evaluative measures, side effects, and outcomes were
      tabulated in 6 evidence tables and summarized in the accompanying text. This
      literature was evaluated for the nature of the studies performed and its coverage
      of potential therapies. The review concludes with comments on possible future
      directions for therapeutic investigation based on the current state of the
      literature.

AB  - Article abstract-Interferon beta (IFNbeta) reduces the relapse rate, disease
      activity as measured by serial MRI scanning, and disease progression of MS.
      Therapy with IFNbeta may be associated with a number of adverse reactions.
      Relatively frequent side effects include flu-like symptoms, transient laboratory 
      abnormalities, menstrual disorders, and increased spasticity. Dermal injection
      site reactions occur after subcutaneous application of IFNbeta-1b and IFNbeta-1a.
      Possible side effects of IFNbeta include various autoimmune reactions, capillary 
      leak syndrome, anaphylactic shock, thrombotic-thrombocytopenic purpura, insomnia,
      headache, alopecia, and depression. We discuss the mechanisms and management of
      the different side effects of IFNbeta.

TI  - Palatal myoclonus--a case report.
PG  - 593-5
AB  - Palatal myoclonus is usually due to a brainstem or cerebellar lesion disrupting
      the dentato-rubro-olivary pathway. Rarely it may be caused by a cortical lesion. 
      The precipitating factor in 70% of all cases is an infarct. We describe an
      unusual case of a patient with palatal myoclonus who had an old ipsilateral
      cerebellar infarct and a new contralateral subcortical (corona radiata) infarct. 
      We postulate that the new infarct caused disinhibition of the old cerebellar
      infarct, resulting in palatal myoclonus. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the 
      brain did not show any hypertrophy of the inferior olivary nucleus. Her myoclonus
      proved refractory to clonazepam, valproate and phenytoin.

TI  - Spontaneous expulsion of large vesicle calculi in a woman with paraparesis.
PG  - 737-8
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Urolithiasis is a common but preventable complication of Spinal
      Cord Disorders (SCD). CASE REPORT: We report a 25-year-old woman with paraparesis
      who spontaneously passed two large calculi perurethra without pain and developed 
      urethral scarring. Detrusor hyperreflexia, absence of sensations and lack of
      sphincter tone could have contributed to painless expulsion of the large calculi 
      in this patient. CONCLUSION: Dysuria, a prominent symptom of urolithiasis may not
      be present in subjects with SCD. Awareness about urolithiasis among health
      professionals involved in the care of SCD patients is necessary for prevention
      and early intervention.

TI  - The psychological effects of spinal cord injury: a review.
PG  - 671-9
AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) usually necessitates considerable changes in the life of
      an individual, and their family members. SCI may demand difficult psychological
      adjustment and in addition place great strain on family roles and relationships. 
      Glass (1993) summarises the situation thus: 'The experience of spinal cord injury
      is one of the most devastating injuries which might affect an individual. The
      resultant disability, after which normal cognitive function and intellectual
      ability usually remains, produces not only an inability to move and feel limbs,
      but also the inability to control the function of internal organs and even, in
      severe cases, the ability to breathe independently.'1

TI  - Zanamivir: a review of its use in influenza.
PG  - 761-84
AB  - Zanamivir is a novel inhibitor of the enzyme neuraminidase, a surface
      glycoprotein essential for the replication of type A and B influenza viruses.
      Statistically significant reductions in median time to alleviation of major
      symptoms of influenza were reported in phase II and III studies of zanamivir.
      Benefit was seen with early treatment (within 30 or 36 hours of onset of illness)
      in phase II trials. Median times to alleviation of major (or 'clinically
      significant') symptoms were reduced by 1 to 2.5 days after treatment with
      zanamivir 10 mg twice daily by oral inhalation for 5 days in 3 phase III studies.
      Benefit of zanamivir treatment in terms of time to return to normal activities
      and reductions in consumption of paracetamol (acetaminophen), and reductions in
      the level of interference of influenza with sleep, work, leisure and recreational
      activities, were reported. Reductions relative to placebo of 2.5 to 3.25 days
      were observed in median time to alleviation of major symptoms in high-risk
      patients. Available data also indicate potential of zanamivir in the prophylaxis 
      of influenza. A statistically significant reduction in the incidence of influenza
      A was reported with zanamivir 10 mg by oral inhalation once daily for 4 weeks in 
      a double-blind study in 1107 persons in 2 university communities. Prophylactic
      benefit of zanamivir in influenza A and B outbreaks has also been suggested by
      data from a nursing home community. Adverse event profiles in patients receiving 
      zanamivir therapeutically or prophylactically appear similar to those in patients
      receiving placebo. The most commonly reported adverse events in therapeutic
      trials have been nasal signs and symptoms, diarrhoea, nausea, headache,
      bronchitis and cough. Conclusions: Prompt treatment with zanamivir in patients
      with naturally acquired influenza is associated with significant reductions in
      duration of symptomatic illness, accelerated return to normal levels of activity 
      and reduced consumption of antibiotics for influenza-related complications. While
      vaccination in selected populations remains the seasonal intervention of choice
      for prophylaxis, the efficacy, good tolerability and lack of resistance seen with
      zanamivir are likely to make the drug a valuable treatment option, particularly
      in individuals not covered or inadequately protected by vaccination, and in those
      at high risk of influenza-related complications. Confirmation of the prophylactic
      efficacy of zanamivir would indicate a major potential role for the drug in this 
      setting, especially in persons for whom vaccination is not suitable or fully
      effective, in closed communities (e.g. nursing homes) and in individuals at high 
      risk.

TI  - A comparison of osteopathic spinal manipulation with standard care for patients
      with low back pain.
PG  - 1426-31
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of osteopathic manual therapy (i.e., spinal manipulation) 
      in patients with chronic and subchronic back pain is largely unknown, and its use
      in such patients is controversial. Nevertheless, manual therapy is a frequently
      used method of treatment in this group of patients. METHODS: We performed a
      randomized, controlled trial that involved patients who had had back pain for at 
      least three weeks but less than six months. We screened 1193 patients; 178 were
      found to be eligible and were randomly assigned to treatment groups; 23 of these 
      patients subsequently dropped out of the study. The patients were treated either 
      with one or more standard medical therapies (72 patients) or with osteopathic
      manual therapy (83 patients). We used a variety of outcome measures, including
      scores on the Roland-Morris and Oswestry questionnaires, a visual-analogue pain
      scale, and measurements of range of motion and straight-leg raising, to assess
      the results of treatment over a 12-week period. RESULTS: Patients in both groups 
      improved during the 12 weeks. There was no statistically significant difference
      between the two groups in any of the primary outcome measures. The
      osteopathic-treatment group required significantly less medication (analgesics,
      antiinflammatory agents, and muscle relaxants) (P< 0.001) and used less physical 
      therapy (0.2 percent vs. 2.6 percent, P<0.05). More than 90 percent of the
      patients in both groups were satisfied with their care. CONCLUSIONS: Osteopathic 
      manual care and standard medical care had similar clinical results in patients
      with subacute low back pain. However, the use of medication was greater with
      standard care.

TI  - Managing pediatric epilepsy syndromes with new antiepileptic drugs.
PG  - 1106-16
AB  - The management of epilepsy in the pediatric patient requires careful evaluation, 
      classification, and pharmacologic treatment. Despite best efforts on the part of 
      clinicians, approximately 25% of children remain refractory to appropriate
      medical therapies. The development of an improved classification system and the
      emergence of several new antiepileptic drugs have enabled some progress in this
      area, specifically in children with disorders such as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and
      infantile spasms, which are notoriously difficult to control. However, limited
      data are available that define the optimal use of new antiepileptic agents in
      pediatric patients. To most effectively treat children with epilepsy syndromes,
      further research must be completed to validate the positive effects described in 
      case reports, open-label clinical trials, and early controlled clinical trials.

TI  - Cost analysis of the treatment of severe spinal spasticity with a continuous
      intrathecal baclofen infusion system.
PG  - 395-404
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to analyse and evaluate the costs of
      continuous intrathecal baclofen administration as a modality in the treatment of 
      severe spasticity in the Netherlands. DESIGN: A cost analysis was conducted as
      part of a prospective, multicentre, multidisciplinary, randomised and
      placebo-controlled clinical trial. The study covered the period from December
      1991 to September 1995. The data on medical consumption and costs were collected 
      over a 3-year period from different sources: administrative databases of health
      insurance companies, hospital registries and a patient survey. These data were
      structured by means of a flowchart analysis of the medical decision-making by
      specialists and general practitioners (GPs). They included data on in- and
      outpatient care, home care and care in nursing homes. The cost analysis was
      conducted using data from 18 patients included in the trial and from 15 so-called
      'match' patients. The latter group are patients with comparable diseases leading 
      to spasticity and living in comparable circumstances. Next to absolute costs
      (direct and indirect) of care and treatment for the 2 groups of patients, cost
      differences between the 2 groups were considered (differential cost analysis).
      SETTING: Per patient cost data, collected prospectively for 2 years during the
      phase of clinical evaluation, and retrospectively 1 year before implantation. The
      data were collected on patients from in- and outpatient care, home care and care 
      in nursing home settings. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: The trial patients (8 men)
      had a mean age of 46 years; 11 patients had multiple sclerosis and 7 patients had
      spinal cord injuries. The match patients (7 men) had a mean age of 48 years; 9
      patients had multiple sclerosis and 6 patients had spinal cord injuries.
      INTERVENTIONS: Trial patients were treated with a subcutaneously implanted
      programmable continuous infusion pump (SynchroMed, Medtronic), filled with
      baclofen (a muscle relaxant) to treat patients with chronic disabling spasticity 
      who did not respond to a maximum dose of oral baclofen, dantrolene and
      tizanidine. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS: An analysis of hospital stay
      between both groups showed a significant difference during the implantation year.
      The average number of hospital days per patient in the year in the treated group 
      was 31.5 days and in the match group was 18.7 days. Significant cost differences 
      between both groups in the year that started with pump implantation and the
      following year can be attributed mostly to the costs of implantation of the pump 
      and related hospitalisation days. The total costs of patient selection, testing, 
      implanting the pump and follow-up amounted to $US28,473 for the first year.
      Savings must be taken into consideration as well. The savings of direct costs
      were due to withdrawal of oral medication (estimated annual total of between
      $US1950 and $US2800 per patient). Indirect savings on employment and nursing home
      costs, amounted annually to $US1047 and $US5814, respectively. Scenarios make it 
      possible to consider policy consequences. The case of 'extending' the indications
      for this treatment to a larger population has been calculated and visualised.
      CONCLUSIONS: The costs of the therapy (continuous intrathecal infusion of
      baclofen) can be attributed mostly to implantation of the pump and related
      hospitalisation days. Savings originated from withdrawal of oral medication, job 
      preservation and avoidance or delay of admission to a nursing home.

TI  - Headache in Meniere's disease.
PG  - 427-33
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We examined headache in 86 patients with severe or moderately severe
      Meniere's disease (MD) or with Meniere's syndrome (MS) chosen for intratympanic
      gentamicin treatment. Forty-five patients with vestibular neuronitis (VN) served 
      as a control group. METHODS: In addition to a clinical examination, the patients 
      filled out a questionnaire concerning their headache. RESULTS: Altogether 60 MD
      patients (70%) and 26 VN patients (58%) reported headache. Headache was severe in
      35 MD patients (58%), moderate in 16 patients (27%) and slight in nine MD
      patients (15%), and as a whole more severe than that of the VN patients (P <
      0.01). The MD patients exhibited significantly more occipital (P < 0.005) and
      neck headache (P < 0.005) than the VN patients. Analgesics had been used by 82%, 
      antidepressants by 35%, sumatriptan by 13% and carbamazepine and/or amitriptyline
      by 12% of the MD patients suffering from headache. Pain relief was reported as
      good by 27%, satisfactory by 60%, poor by 5% of the MD patients and 8% could not 
      rate the pain relief. In this study migraine was diagnosed in 5 MD patients.
      CONCLUSION: It is concluded that MD is associated with headache that can be
      handicapping, and tricyclic antidepressants with pain alleviating medication is
      often needed to treat the headache in MD whereas sumatriptan did not alleviate
      the headache of the non-migraine patients.

AB  - An 11-year-old girl presented with a syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic
      hormone secretion, which was transitory and, initially, of obscure origin.
      Subsequently, the patient's hypothalamic disorder emerged as a component of a

      to the basal ganglia and brainstem. Where such a disorder fits in the spectrum
      from acute disseminating encephalomeylitis to multiple sclerosis is discussed.

TI  - Depressogenic medication as an aetiological factor in major depression: an
      analysis in a clinical population of depressed elderly people.
PG  - 875-81
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the role of depressogenic medication in the aetiology of
      major depression in the elderly. BACKGROUND: Depression can be caused, provoked
      or sustained by drugs prescribed for other reasons. The evidence for this
      statement is based on case-reports, not on investigations in relevant
      populations. METHOD: In the geriatric wards of three Dutch psychiatric hospitals,
      195 patients with a DSM-III-R diagnosis of major depression (MDD) were studied.
      In the first week after admission the following data were recorded: age, gender, 
      personal psychiatric history, family psychiatric history, Montgomery-Asberg
      Depression Rating Scale, Mini-Mental State Examination, history of stroke, use of
      medication and number of different medications used. Subjects using depressogenic
      medication were contrasted with subjects not using depressogenic medication on
      all variables. RESULTS: There was a significant negative relationship, adjusted
      for the other variables, between the use of depressogenic medication and a
      previous admission for depression. No other significant relationships between the
      use of depressogenic medication and aetiological variables were found. Patients
      with a first-time admission for MDD use depressogenic medication 2.44 times more 
      often than patients with previous admissions for depression. CONCLUSION: The use 
      of depressogenic medication is an independent and clinically relevant
      aetiological factor in MDD.

TI  - Efficacy, safety, and gradual discontinuation of clonazepam in panic disorder: a 
      placebo-controlled, multicenter study using optimized dosages.
PG  - 604-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of optimized dosages of clonazepam 
      for the treatment of panic disorder and assess the tolerability of a schedule for
      gradual discontinuation. METHOD: Adult patients with panic disorder with or
      without agoraphobia (DSM-III-R criteria) were randomly assigned to receive either
      placebo or clonazepam in individually adjusted doses over 3 weeks to approximate 
      an optimal dosage, which was then maintained for an additional 3 weeks, amounting
      to a 6-week therapeutic phase. The daily dose range was 0.25 to 4.0 mg
      administered in 2 divided doses. In the following 7-week discontinuance phase,
      the doses were tapered gradually to cessation. RESULTS: At the therapeutic
      endpoint, clonazepam (N = 222) proved clinically and statistically superior to
      placebo (N = 216) in change in the number of panic attacks and in Clinical Global
      Impressions-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) and CGI-Change scores, Patient's Global
      Impression of Change scores, amount of fear and avoidance associated with phobic 
      symptoms, and duration of anticipatory anxiety. The gradual tapering of
      clonazepam was not associated with symptoms suggestive of withdrawal syndrome.
      Although patients taking clonazepam experienced some clinical worsening compared 
      with the status achieved at endpoint, particularly in terms of number of panic
      attacks, no deterioration was observed using their condition at baseline as point
      of reference. No overall evidence of rebound was found. All regimens were
      generally well tolerated. Somnolence was the main adverse event associated with
      clonazepam therapy. The percentage of patients who reported adverse events was
      higher in the clonazepam group than in the placebo group, as was the mean number 
      of adverse events per patient. CONCLUSION: In this placebo-controlled trial,
      clonazepam was an efficacious and safe shortterm treatment of the symptoms of
      panic disorder. Discontinuance during and after slow tapering was well tolerated.

TI  - Assessment of drug resistance to the malaria parasite in residents of Kampala,
      Uganda.
PG  - 421-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess drug-resistance of the malaria parasite in elite residents
      of Kampala city, Uganda. DESIGN: Recruited into the study were patients with
      complaints of fever, backache and headache or general malaise and body joint
      pains, could recall their previous treatment for the current complaints and could
      show laboratory reports indicating presence of malaria parasites. Blood was taken
      from those patients and examined for malaria parasites. SETTING: Kampala
      Diagnostic and Imaging Consultants Clinic, Kampala, Uganda from 1994 to 1997.
      RESULTS: Out of 268 patients, 27%, 26%, 12%, 11%, 6%, 6% and 5% strains of
      malaria parasites were respectively resistant to chloroquine, quinine,
      metakelfin, fansidar, halfan, artenam and camoquine. Double drug resistance was
      also observed in the patients who had taken chloroquine and quinine (21%),
      chloroquine and fansidar (16%) and quinine and fansidar (10%) out of 86. Some
      strains exhibited resistance to chloroquine, quinine and fansidar (12.6%) out of 
      71. R III was observed in 17 strains of malaria parasites, eight of them were for
      chloroquine, four for fansidar and three for quinine. Twenty-six patients had
      frequent recurrence of malaria lasting for over one year. CONCLUSION: One third
      of Plasmodium falciparum strains by 1997 had acquired resistance to chloroquine
      and quinine and some were gradually acquiring multi-drug resistance, leading to
      frequent recurrence of malaria and use of many different types of antimalarials.

      conducted at Kampala Diagnostic and Imaging Consultants Clinic from 1994 to 1997.
      It enrolled patients with complaints of fever, backache and headache or general
      body malaise and joint pains, who could recall their previous treatment for the
      current complaints and could show laboratory reports indicating the presence of
      malaria parasites. Blood samples of the patients were collected and examined. Out
      of 268 patients, 27%, 26%, 12%, 11%, 6%, 6%, and 5% strains of malaria parasites 
      were respectively resistant to chloroquine, quinine, metakelfin, fansidar,
      halfan, artenam, and camoquine. Among patients who had taken two drugs, double
      drug resistance was observed in those who had taken chloroquine and quinine
      (21%), chloroquine and fansidar (16%), and quinine and fansidar (10%). Moreover, 
      26 patients had frequent recurrence of malaria lasting for over 1 year. In
      conclusion, one-third of Plasmodium falciparum strains by 1997 had acquired
      resistance to chloroquine and quinine and some were slowly acquiring multidrug
      resistance resulting in frequent recurrence of malaria and use of many different 
      types of antimalarials.

TI  - Midthoracic catheter tip placement for intrathecal baclofen administration in
      children with quadriparetic spasticity.
PG  - 833-6; discussion 836-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In an effort to increase the effect of intrathecal baclofen on
      upper-extremity spasticity, the tip of the intrathecal catheter was placed at the
      T6-T7 level rather than at the traditional T11-T12 level in children with spastic
      quadriparesis. METHODS: Twelve children with spastic quadriparesis from varying
      causes had significant reductions in spasticity after a test dose of intrathecal 
      baclofen and subsequently underwent placement of a programmable pump and
      intrathecal catheter tip placed at the T6-T7 level with fluoroscopic guidance.
      With the use of Ashworth scores for four muscle groups in both the upper and
      lower extremities, degrees of spasticity were determined by a physiatrist
      preoperatively and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Mean changes in
      upper- and lower-extremity Ashworth scores and baclofen dosages for the entire
      cohort were compared with published results in which the catheter tip had been
      placed at the T11-T12 level. RESULTS: Spasticity was significantly reduced in all
      muscle groups (P < 0.001). The lower-extremity reduction in spasticity of 1.6
      points at 3 and 12 months was greater than published reductions of 1.1 points at 
      3 and 12 months. The upper-extremity reduction in spasticity was noticeably
      greater at 3 and 12 months (1.7 and 2.0 points, respectively) than published
      results at 3 and 12 months (0.4 and 0.6 points, respectively). At 3, 6, and 12
      months, our mean baclofen dosage remained below the dosages administered at the
      T11-T12 level. There were no complications related either to the positioning of
      the catheter higher in the spinal canal or to the administration of baclofen at
      the T6-T7 level. CONCLUSION: Compared with published results, placement of the
      tip of the intrathecal catheter at the T6-T7 level was associated with greater
      relief of upper-extremity spasticity without loss of effect on the lower
      extremities. The mean dosages of baclofen in our study group were lower compared 
      with mean dosages administered at the T11-T12 level. There was no morbidity
      related to the more rostral location of the catheter.

TI  - Activated cytokine production in patients with accidental hypothermia.
PG  - 263-8
AB  - We have demonstrated recently that therapeutic moderate hypothermia of 32-33
      degrees C, induced by surface cooling under the administration of narcotics,
      sedatives and muscle relaxant, suppresses cytokine production after traumatic
      brain injury. We present here the first documented case report of augmented
      cytokine production in two accidental hypothermia patients, unconscious 84-
      (acute immersion) and 87- (non-immersion) year-old women, whose rectal
      temperatures were below 28 degrees C. The victims were artificially ventilated
      after sedation with midazolam and buprenorphine in accordance with our protocol. 
      Rewarming at the rate of approximately 1 degrees C/h was done by blowing
      forced-air with appropriate fluid resuscitation. Plasma interleukin(IL)-6 and/or 
      IL-8 levels were measured using ELISA in the patients. In both patients, plasma
      IL-6 levels on admission were already elevated and the cytokine levels further
      increased during and after the rewarming period. In the patient with the poorer
      prognosis, the plasma IL-8 level on admission was not elevated remarkably but
      after rewarming the level rose significantly. Augmented IL-6 production in
      accidental hypothermia was sustained for 6 days in the patient with the poorer
      prognosis but not in the subject with good recovery, who was treated with
      anti-thrombin III in the early phase. Since the mechanisms for developing
      accidental hypothermia were different, simple comparisons between the two cases
      should be limited. But, these findings may suggest a need for testing a
      hypothesis whether cytokine modulation could be a therapeutic approach worthy of 
      consideration. The results presented here also suggest that in hypothermia,
      changes in cytokine release may vary depending on procedures such as the
      anesthetic drugs used, the duration of the therapy, or the rate of rewarming from
      hypothermia.

TI  - Panic disorder in a patient with traumatic brain injury: a case report and
      discussion.
PG  - 705-14
AB  - Individuals that may be especially susceptible to panic attacks in the
      rehabilitation setting are patients who have suffered traumatic brain injuries,
      post-concussion syndrome, lesions, or encephalopathy. An individual is described 
      who suffered a traumatic brain injury and was determined to have suffered a panic
      attack during his rehabilitation stay. The manifestations of panic attacks are
      described, using the case report as an example. The psychological aetiology of
      panic disorders is also reviewed, and treatment options using four major classes 
      of neuropharmacologic agents: benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants,
      monoamide oxidase inhibitors, and serotonin reuptake inhibitors, are discussed.
      Given the increasing incidence and survival of patients with traumatic brain
      injuries, the complications of panic attacks and disorders will become more
      important; they are a serious condition that can affect an individual's
      lifestyle, employment, and relationships, and increase the risk of suicide.
      Rehabilitation specialists should be aware of the manifestations and management
      of panic attacks and come to appreciate that recognition of this treatable
      condition is important during all stages of rehabilitation.

TI  - Generalizing from a controlled trial: the effects of patient preference versus
      randomization on the outcome of inpatient versus outpatient chronic pain
      management.
PG  - 57-65
AB  - Patients accepting randomization in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) may not
      be representative of the clinical population from which they are drawn, calling
      into question the generalizability of study findings. Comparison of randomized
      and non-randomized inpatient and outpatient samples at baseline and in treatment 
      outcomes up to one year was made to determine whether the findings of the RCT
      generalized to non-randomized patients in the same treatment program. One hundred
      and twenty one patients with intractable pain, randomized between inpatient,
      outpatient and waiting list control, were compared with 128 who elected for
      either inpatient or outpatient treatment. Treatment was a group-based
      multidisciplinary cognitive-behavioral treatment program aimed at enabling
      patients to return to more normal function despite persistent pain, delivered to 
      mixed groups of randomized and elective patients, and outcome was measured by
      physical performance, pain impact on function, mood, and drug use. Agreement to
      randomization was a function of travelling distance from home to hospital.
      Non-randomized patients largely resembled their randomized counterparts before
      and after treatment. In order to indicate the clinical significance of results,
      analyses were conducted using numbers needed to treat (NNTs). NNTs estimate the
      number of patients required in the treatment condition for one of them to achieve
      the specified outcome who would not have achieved it in the comparison condition.
      Across a range of measures at one month follow-up, comparison of inpatients with 
      outpatients gave NNTs between 2.3 and 7.5, and comparison of inpatients with
      waiting list controls gave NNTs between 2.3 and 3.6. At one year inpatients
      showed greater likelihood than outpatients of maintaining these treatment gains.

AB  - In the past year, further evidence establishing the usefulness of beta
      interferons and glatiramer in the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple
      sclerosis has been advanced. Interferon-beta-1b was also shown to be efficacious 
      in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. This and other trials of symptomatic
      treatments are reviewed. Based on an appraisal of recent experimental studies,
      future promising approaches to intervene in the chain of immunopathogenetic
      events are discussed.

TI  - A meta-analysis of fibromyalgia treatment interventions.
PG  - 180-91
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and compare the efficacy of pharmacological and
      nonpharmacological treatments of fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). METHODS: This
      meta-analysis of 49 fibromyalgia treatment outcome studies assessed the efficacy 
      of pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment across four types of outcome 
      measures-physical status, self-report of FMS symptoms, psychological status, and 
      daily functioning. RESULTS: After controlling for study design, antidepressants
      resulted in improvements on physical status and self-report of FMS symptoms. All 
      nonpharmacological treatments were associated with significant improvements in
      all four categories of outcome measures with the exception that physically-based 
      treatment (primarily exercise) did not significantly improve daily functioning.
      When compared, nonpharmacological treatment appears to be more efficacious in
      improving self-report of FMS symptoms than pharmacological treatment alone. A
      similar trend was suggested for functional measures. CONCLUSION: The optimal
      intervention for FMS would include nonpharmacological treatments, specifically
      exercise and cognitive-behavioral therapy, in addition to appropriate medication 
      management as needed for sleep and pain symptoms.

TI  - Epidural blood patch under fluoroscopic control: non-surgical treatment of lumbar
      cerebrospinal fluid fistula following implantation of an intrathecal pump system.
PG  - 648-52
AB  - The treatment of lumbar cerebrospinal fluid fistula in the presence of an
      intrathecal catheter is known to be difficult. Open revision surgery is
      recommended in the literature, although the rate of recurrence is high. The
      epidural blood patch technique is well established as a successful treatment for 
      post-dural-puncture headaches. Recent work about the distribution of the injected
      blood and theoretical considerations about the mechanism of action make this
      method suitable for the occlusion of spinal leakage even in the presence of an
      intrathecal catheter. In this note technical details are given for a successful
      therapy of lumbar cerebrospinal fluid fistula including the right positioning of 
      the opening of the needle (cerebrospinal fluid can be expected intrathecally and 
      epidurally) by injection of contrast medium first for myelography then for
      epidurography. In this procedure the (epidural) distribution of autologous blood 
      can be indirectly controlled by compression of the dural sac. The method is easy 
      to perform, and the possible risks are small.

TI  - Apneustic breathing in children with brainstem damage due to hypoxic-ischemic
      encephalopathy.
PG  - 560-7
AB  - To confirm the presence of apneusis in patients with hypoxic-ischemic
      encephalopathy and to clarify which factors influence their respiratory patterns,
      polygraphic studies were performed on two patients. Apneusis was clinically
      suspected in both patients who had severe brainstem damage. In one subject,
      inputs of vagal afferents from the gastrointestinal tract and the urinary bladder
      often resulted in extreme tachypnea instead of apneusis. Lung inflation
      facilitated expiration during inspiratory arrest. Expiration preceded a periodic 
      inhibition of rigospastic discharge in the right biceps muscle. In the other
      subject, prolonged inspiratory pauses with cyanosis occurred with or without
      preceding epileptic seizure. Both phenytoin dose reduction and treatment with
      tandospirone, a serotonin-1A agonist, were effective in improving the respiratory
      distress in this subject.

TI  - Multiple sclerosis and its treatment.
PG  - 315-22
AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a common neurological disorder responsible for
      substantial neurological morbidity. Although it is considered to be an autoimmune
      demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS), mediated by
      antigen-specific CD4+ T helper (Th1) T-cells, therapeutic strategies aimed at
      generalised immunosuppression have been disappointing. Recently, immunomodulatory
      therapies like interferon (IFN)-beta and glatiramer acetate have proved more
      effective. They reduce the rate and severity of clinical relapses and, in the
      case of IFN-beta, delay the rate of disease progression. Symptomatic therapies
      and rehabilitation, however, remain the mainstay of treatment for the majority of
      patients with MS. The immunopathogenesis of MS and its treatments, both disease
      modifying and symptomatic, are reviewed below.

TI  - Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors: an update.
PG  - 69-84
AB  - Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including fluoxetine,
      sertraline, paroxetine, fluvoxamine, and citalopram, represent an important
      advance in the pharmacotherapy of mood and other disorders. They are chemically
      unrelated to tricyclic, heterocyclic, and other first-generation antidepressants.
      SSRIs are the treatment of choice for many indications, including major
      depression, dysthymia, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, eating
      disorders, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder, because of their efficacy, good
      side-effect profile, tolerability, and safety in overdose, as well as patient
      compliance. A review of the literature was conducted using Medline and the terms 
      "SSRIs," "fluoxetine," "sertraline," "paroxetine," "fluvoxamine," and
      "citalopram." Articles were limited to those published in English within the last
      15 years. The search revealed that indications for antidepressants include
      unipolar depression, dysthymia, bipolar depression, treatment-resistant
      depression, depression in the medically ill, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive
      disorder, eating disorders, social phobia, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder.
      One SSRI, fluoxetine, has demonstrated safety in pregnancy. Side effects of SSRIs
      include gastrointestinal disturbances, headache, sedation, insomnia, activation, 
      weight gain, impaired memory, excessive perspiration, paresthesia, and sexual
      dysfunction.

TI  - Childhood secondary (symptomatic) epilepsy, seizure control, and intellectual
      handicap in a nontropical region of South Africa.
PG  - 1110-3
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence of secondary (symptomatic) epilepsy and to
      ascertain levels of seizure control and intellectual function in a clinic
      population of children drawn from a poor community in a temperate region of South
      Africa. METHODS: Detailed review of the records of every child with recurrent
      seizures who attended a special epilepsy outpatient clinic during 1995. RESULTS: 
      A total of 1,017 children was studied. In 432 (43%), there was historic,
      clinical, and radiologic evidence to suggest that epilepsy was symptomatic of
      underlying brain damage or defect. Acceptable seizure control was maintained with
      a single standard anticonvulsant drug (AED) in 65% of cases. In the 6 months
      preceding the study, 37% of the subjects had remained seizure free. Forty-seven
      percent of the study population were considered to be of subnormal intelligence. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In a children's hospital outpatient population in the Western Cape
      region of South Africa, the prevalence of secondary epilepsy is higher than is
      found in developed countries. There is need within the community for preventive
      measures aimed at reducing the prevalence of perinatal insults, meningitis,
      tuberculosis, neurocysticercosis, and cerebral trauma.

TI  - Baclofen for prevention of migraine.
PG  - 589-91
AB  - Baclofen, an analog of the putative inhibitory neurotransmitter
      gamma-aminobutyric acid is capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier. The drug 
      has been shown to have an antinociceptive action and is used effectively in the
      management of spasticity. Baclofen was first used in the treatment of trigeminal 
      neuralgia in 1980 and is currently used in the management of various types of
      neuropathic pain. The effect of baclofen on migraine has not been previously
      studied. The aim of the present open pilot study was to evaluate the efficacy of 
      baclofen in patients with migraine. Fifty-four patients with migraine with and
      without aura who experienced 4-8 migraine attacks during a 4-week baseline were
      included. Baclofen, 15-40 mgs, was given in three divided doses for 12 weeks.
      Headache frequency and severity were recorded. Fifty-one patients completed the
      trial. Baclofen was found to be effective in 86.2% with > or = 50% headache
      reduction from baseline. Three patients could not tolerate the drug due to
      adverse events. In this open study, baclofen was found to be effective for
      prophylactic treatment of migraine.

PG  - 274-7
AB  - A patient with muscle phosphoglycerate mutase deficiency (PGAMD) and
      exercise-induced muscle cramps had tubular aggregates in muscle and increased
      muscle Ca2+-adenosine triphosphatase and calcium content. Two ischemic forearm
      exercise tests induced contractures in the patient. On dantrolene treatment, the 
      patient became asymptomatic, and the ischemic test was performed without
      contracture. These findings suggest that cramps in muscle PGAMD are caused by a
      high calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum relative to calcium
      re-uptake capacity.

TI  - The relationship between myofascial trigger points of gastrocnemius muscle and
      nocturnal calf cramps.
PG  - 451-9
AB  - To support that myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) of gastrocnemius muscle is one
      cause of nocturnal calf cramps, quantitative assessment of the efficacy of
      trigger point (TrP) injection compared with oral quinine in the treatment of
      nocturnal calf cramps (NCC) associated with MPS of gastrocnemius muscle was
      designed. Twenty four subjects with NCC and gastrocnemius TrPs were randomly
      divided into two groups of twelve for each treatment. Patients in group 1 were
      treated with xylocaine injection at the gastrocnemius TrP, and 300 mg of quinine 
      sulfate p.o. was prescribed for patients of group 2. The treatment period was
      four weeks with a follow-up 4 weeks later. Cramps were assessed quantitatively
      (in terms of frequency, duration, pain intensity, cramp index, and pain threshold
      of the gastrocnemius TrPs) before treatment, after treatment and at the end of
      the follow-up respectively. The outcome of treatment in both groups showed a
      statistically significant reduction in all quantitative aspects of cramps (95%
      confidence interval). Also the pain threshold of the gastrocnemius TrP was
      significantly increased in group 1 only when comparing the pre-treatment and at
      the end of follow-up. In comparing the two groups we found no statistical
      difference during the period of treatment. The benefit of both strategies lasted 
      up to four weeks following cessation of the treatment but the outcome of all
      measures (except pain threshold) were found to be significantly better in the
      group treated with TrP injection. The results of this study support that
      gastrocnemius trigger point is one cause of NCC and show that the TrP injection
      strategy for NCC associated with myofascial pain is not only as effective as oral
      quinine during the treatment period but also better in the prolonged effect at
      follow-up.

TI  - Clinical presentation and diagnosis of cerebral malaria in children in the
      highlands of western Kenya.
PG  - 89-92
AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical presentation of cerebral malaria in children in the
      highlands has not been documented. OBJECTIVE: To describe the presentation of
      cerebral malaria in the age group one to twelve years. DESIGN: Prospective study 
      conducted from May to September 1997, the rainy season during which malaria
      occurs in epidemics in the highlands of Kenya. SETTING: Paediatric wards of the
      Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital, Eldoret which is the Teaching Hospital for
      Moi University and the referral centre for surrounding districts of Western
      Kenya, with an altitude of over 2000 metres above sea level. PATIENTS: Twenty
      three consecutive children aged one to twelve years with cerebral malaria as
      defined by the WHO were studied. All children were treated with the standard
      quinine regimen for cerebral malaria. RESULTS: Majority of the children were six 
      to ten years of age with 95.7% having a normal weight for age. 91.3%, 89.5% and
      72.2% had fever, headache and convulsions respectively. 68.1% had a short
      duration of illness (less than three days) with only 9.5% presenting with
      hypoglycaemia. Severe anaemia was not observed but 72% had mild to moderate
      anaemia. Hyperparasitaemia (parasite counts greater than 100,000 per microlitre) 
      was found in majority of the cases. CONCLUSION: Cerebral malaria presentation in 
      the highlands is similar to that among non-immune populations and is an acute
      fulminant illness presenting with coma, hyperparasitaemia, fever and convulsions 
      in children with normal nutritional status.

TI  - Non-nicotine pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation.
PG  - 653-69
AB  - The selection of a non-nicotine treatment is based on the acceptability of
      various treatments with smokers, the ability to address the specific neurobiology
      of nicotine addiction, and the option to provide treatment for co-morbid
      conditions of nicotine-dependent patients. The search for effective treatments
      for nicotine dependence has generated a wide variety of non-nicotine approaches
      based on the neuropharmacologic and sensory basis for tobacco use. The only
      non-nicotine, FDA-approved medication is bupropion, an amino-ketone agent that is
      believed to work on the dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotransmitters involved
      in perpetuating nicotine dependence. This article reviews other unapproved
      medications, mechanisms of action, and their effectiveness in clinical trials.

TI  - Successful intrathecal ethanol block for intractable spasticity of AIDS-related
      progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.
PG  - 450-2
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the efficacy of intrathecal ethanol block to relieve
      intractable spasticity in AIDS-related progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
      (PML) when long-term intrathecal baclofen infusion cannot be used. METHODS: A
      33-year-old man with AIDS-related PML developed very severe spastic paraparesis
      (Ashworth rigidity score, 4) and painful muscle spasms. The patient was unable to
      sit in his wheelchair and remained bed bound. Combined oral baclofen and
      tizanidine at therapeutical doses were used without any effect on the spasticity.
      The patient refused the placement of an intrathecal catheter for long-term
      baclofen infusion. A single intrathecal ethanol (6 ml) injection in the L2-L3
      intervertebral space with the patient placed in a lateral Trendelenburg (40 C)
      position was performed. RESULTS: The procedure was very effective in improving
      the stiffness (Ashworth rigidity score. 2, after the technique) and the muscle
      spasms disappeared. No side effects during or after the injection were observed. 
      CONCLUSION: Intrathecal ethanol block is a last but very useful choice for
      treatment of intractable spasticity in PML and other neurologic disorders in AIDS
      patients when other oral treatments have failed and intrathecal baclofen infusion
      is not suitable.

      or deliberate dural puncture. It also occurs after epidural or spinal analgesia
      for labor and delivery. Treatment may be conservative with analgesics and/or
      caffeine. Definitive treatment can be accomplished with an epidural blood patch
      (EBP). We present a case of postpartum convulsions which were temporally related 
      to a caffeine infusion and an EBP.

TI  - Central I1-imidazoline receptors as targets of centrally acting antihypertensive 
      drugs. Clinical pharmacology of moxonidine and rilmenidine.
PG  - 420-9
AB  - Moxonidine and rilmenidine are moderately selective I1-receptor stimulants. The
      imidazoline (I1) agonists cause peripheral sympathoinhibition, triggered at the
      level of central nervous imidazoline receptors. Imidazoline receptor stimulants
      are effective antihypertensive agents with a hemodynamic profile that is
      attractive from a pathophysiologic point of view. The antihypertensive activity
      of these agents is caused by vasodilatation and reduced peripheral vascular
      resistance. Left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volume is reduced,
      whereas heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, and pulmonary artery pressures
      are largely unchanged. Long-term left ventricular hypertrophy is reduced. Both
      drugs, when applied in a once-daily dosage schedule, appear to control
      hypertension in most patients. Both drugs have been compared with representative 
      agents from the major classes of antihypertensive drugs in controlled trials and 
      found to be equally effective in blood pressure control. The incidence and
      severity of side effects are lower than those for clonidine, particularly with
      respect to sedation. A rebound (withdrawal) phenomenon has so far not been
      reported for moxonidine and rilmenidine. Therefore, I1-receptor stimulants offer 
      the possibility of developing centrally acting agents with a better side-effect
      profile than do the classic alpha 2-adrenoceptor stimulants.

TI  - Diagnosis and treatment of severe dysplastic spondylolisthesis.
PG  - 326-8
AB  - Spondylolisthesis, the anterior or posterior displacement of one vertebra on
      another, usually affects the lumbar region. Five percent of the population has
      one of the five classes of spondylolisthesis, which include dysplastic, isthmic, 
      degenerative, traumatic, and pathologic spondylolisthesis. This article focuses
      on the dysplastic type, which makes up 14% to 21% of all spondylolisthesis.
      Dysplastic spondylolisthesis usually causes no symptoms in children; pain usually
      begins in adolescence. The key to diagnosis is the appropriate use of radiography
      in the evaluation of low back pain. This report describes a case involving a
      21-year-old woman presenting with back pain to the family physician. Also, it
      details how the diagnosis was achieved and evaluates conservative and aggressive 
      treatment options.

TI  - A new twist for stopping the shakes? Revisiting GABAergic therapy for essential
      tremor.
PG  - 807-8
AB  - Aside from physiological tremor, essential tremor (ET) is by far the most common 
      cause of tremor in humans, affecting large numbers of individuals in every human 
      population. The crude prevalence of ET has been conservatively estimated to be
      between 0.4% and 3.9%, although some estimates of the prevalence of ET among the 
      elderly are higher than 20%. Essential tremor is the most prevalent adult-onset
      movement disorder, and is also regarded as one of the most common neurological
      disorders of adults, with a prevalence that is similar to or greater than that of
      stroke, Alzheimer disease, migraine headache, and lumbosacral pain syndromes.
      Essential tremor is as much as 20 times more prevalent than Parkinson disease.

TI  - Safety and tolerability of gabapentin as adjunctive therapy in a large,
      multicenter study.
PG  - 965-72
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the tolerability and safety of gabapentin (GBP) as add-on
      therapy for seizure control. METHODS: Conducted in an outpatient setting and
      reflecting usual practice, this study compared tolerability of GBP dosages < or =
      1,800 versus >1,800 mg/day, when these doses were required to achieve the most
      effective seizure control. Two analyses of adverse events are presented:
      tolerability and safety. In the tolerability analysis, each patient served as his
      or her own control to compare the occurrence of adverse events at GBP < or =1,800
      versus >1,800 mg/day. The safety analysis required patients to receive at least
      one dose of GBP and have a follow-up contact. RESULTS: A total of 2,216 patients 
      enrolled in this open-label, 16-week study and were evaluable for safety. Of
      these, 74.0% completed the 16-week study, and 281 met the tolerability criteria. 
      Within these 281 patients, two mutually exclusive groups were compared (a) those 
      reporting adverse events at only < or =1,800 mg/day (low dose); and (b) those
      reporting adverse events at only >1,800 mg/day (high dose). Three adverse events 
      (asthenia, headache, and dizziness) were observed in a statistically
      significantly larger number of patients at only the low dose than in the group
      reporting these same adverse events at only the high dose, suggesting that
      patients who tolerated GBP at < or = 1,800 mg/day did not experience a
      significant increase in adverse events with dosages >1,800 mg/day. Overall, 10.6%
      of the 2,216 patients in the safety population prematurely withdrew because of
      adverse events, and 3.5% discontinued because of lack of efficacy. Safety and
      tolerability of GBP was rated as excellent or good for 78.5% of all patients.
      CONCLUSIONS: Gabapentin doses >1,800 mg/day were as well tolerated as doses < or 
      =1,800 mg/day and were not associated with more adverse events.

TI  - Migraine prescription density and recommendations. Results of the PCAOM Study.
PG  - 511-9
AB  - We estimate the extent to which recommendations on the prevention and treatment
      of migraine issued by professional medical bodies are implemented in medical
      practice in Germany. Computerized data (MediPlus, IMS Health) were analyzed in
      4,636 male and 16,573 female migraineurs from 383 primary care practices 1994
      through 1996 (Primary Care of Migraine, PCAOM study). A total of 90,540 drug
      prescriptions with a documented diagnosis of migraine were issued in 45,669
      person-years (1,492 prescriptions [DM 40.99] per person-year to men, 2,109
      prescriptions [DM 62.01] per person-year to women). Approximately three of every 
      four prescriptions were incompatible with the recommendations of the German
      Migraine and Headache Society (DMKG), amounting to extrapolated costs of DM 49
      million per year borne by the German statutory health insurance fund for
      combination migraine preparations. The density of non-DMKG therapies for
      diagnosed migraine followed a sigmoid curve with increasing patient age, while
      DMKG-compliant therapies described a bell-shaped curve. Referrals to neurological
      care specialists were not associated with subsequent primary care focus on
      recommended therapies. We conclude that medication prescribed for migraine is
      largely not according to long-standing recommendations by medical societies in
      Germany.

TI  - Neurological manifestations of malaria : an update.
PG  - 85-91
AB  - Several neurological complications are associated with complicated and severe
      falciparum malaria. Cerebral malaria is one of the most dreaded complication. The
      children are particularly more vulnerable to have this complication. Despite
      availability of several potent antimalarial drugs in recent past, the mortality
      status has not changed. A large number of survivors are left with disabling
      neurological sequelae. Few patients may experience post-malaria neurological
      syndrome after recovery from complicated falciparum infection. Various
      psychiatric syndromes have been described either as early manifestation of
      cerebral malaria or part of post malaria neurological syndrome. From Indian
      subcontinent several patients of delayed cerebellar ataxia have also been
      described following recovery from clinical malaria. In paediatric patients,
      convulsions of cerebral malaria need to be differentiated from febrile
      convulsions. Falciparum malaria is also associated specifically with convulsions 
      in uncomplicated patients of malaria. Several isolated case reports of various
      other neurological syndromes like peripheral neuropathies, various movement
      disorders, myelopathies and stroke like syndrome have been described. However
      association of these neurological manifestations with malaria remains doubtful.

AB  - The aim of this study was to develop quantitative analytical methods in the
      application of the pendulum test to both normal and spastic subjects. The lower
      leg was released by a torque motor from different starting positions. The
      resulting changes in the knee angle were fitted by means of a time-varying model.
      Stiffness and viscosity coefficients were derived for each half-cycle oscillation
      in both flexion and extension, and for all knee starting positions. This method
      was applied to the assessment of the effects of Botulinum toxin A (BTX) in
      progressive multiple sclerosis patients in a follow-up study. About half of the
      patients showed a significant decrement in stiffness and viscosity coefficients.

TI  - Tinea capitis: an overview with emphasis on management.
PG  - 171-89
AB  - Tinea capitis is perhaps the most common mycotic infection in children. In North 
      America the epidemiology of tinea capitis has changed so that Trichophyton
      tonsurans now predominates over Micro-sporum audouinii. With this transition the 
      utility of the Wood's light for diagnosis has been reduced since T. tonsurans
      infection is Wood's light negative. Griseofulvin has been the mainstay of therapy
      for the last 40 years. The newer antifungal agents-itraconazole, terbinafine, and
      fluconazole-appear to be effective and safe for the treatment of tinea capitis.
      When tinea capitis is due to T. tonsurans or other endothrix species the
      following regimens have been used: itraconazole continuous regimen (5 mg/kg/day
      for 4 weeks), itraconazole pulse regimen with capsules (5 mg/kg/day for 1 week
      plus 1-3 pulses 3 weeks apart), and itraconazole pulse regimen with oral solution
      (3 mg/kg/day for 1 week plus 1-3 pulses 3 weeks apart). With terbinafine tablets 
      the continuous regimen (>40 kg body weight, 250 mg/day; 20-40 kg, 125 mg/day; and
      <20 kg, 125 mg/day) is given for 2 to 4 weeks. Fluconazole tablets or oral
      suspension (6 mg/kg/day) were administered for 20 days in one trial. Another
      possibility may be 6 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks and evaluating the scalp 4 weeks
      later. An extra week of therapy (6 mg/kg/day) can be administered if clinically
      indicated at that time. A once-weekly regimen may also be effective. When
      ectothrix organisms (e.g., Microsporum canis) are present, a longer duration of
      therapy may be required. The data suggest that the newer agents are effective,
      safe with few adverse effects, and have a high benefit:risk ratio. It remains to 
      be seen to what extent griseofulvin will be superseded for the treatment of tinea
      capitis. Adjunctive therapies may help decrease the risk of infection to other
      individuals. Appropriate measures should be taken to reduce the possibility of
      reinfection.

TI  - Effects of a beta2-agonist on airway hyperreactivity in subjects with cervical
      spinal cord injury.
PG  - 1533-8
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Aerosolized ipratropium bromide or orally administered baclofen 
      or oxybutynin chloride (Ditropan) block methacholine-associated airway
      hyperreactivity in subjects with chronic cervical spinal cord injury (SCI),
      whereas these agents do not inhibit airway hyperreactivity associated with the
      inhalation of histamine. The present study was performed to determine whether
      pretreatment with a beta2-agonist attenuates airway hyperresponsiveness in these 
      subjects. PARTICIPANTS: Subjects with chronic cervical SCI previously
      demonstrating airway hyperreactivity were challenged with methacholine (n = 9) or
      histamine (n = 16) alone and, on a separate day, 25 min following inhalation of
      nebulized metaproterenol sulfate. RESULTS: Inhalation of the beta2-agonist was
      associated with an increase in provocative concentration causing a 20% decrease
      in FEV1 (PC20) values (geometric mean) from 1.01+/-2.76 to 20.54+/-6.24 mg/mL for
      methacholine and from 2.29+/-2.26 to 19.82+/-5.93 mg/mL for histamine. No
      correlation was found between specific PC20 values for individual subjects and
      percentage improvement in FEV1 (liter) following inhalation of metaproterenol
      sulfate and between PC20 values and baseline FEV1 percent. CONCLUSION: These
      data, combined with findings that patients with chronic high cervical SCI
      experience increased breathlessness following exposure to exogenous agents,

TI  - A fugue-like state associated with diazepam use.
PG  - 442-3
AB  - Diazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine. Although diazepam is commonly
      associated with a variety of side effects, it is generally not believed to cause 
      fugue-like states or retrograde amnesia. This report presents the case of an
      active duty patient who developed a brief fugue-like state with retrograde
      amnesia. This was associated with the short-term oral use of diazepam. There was 
      no other apparent cause for his symptoms, which resolved within 24 hours after
      the diazepam was discontinued. This case suggests that short-term use of diazepam
      can lead to a brief fugue-like state with retrograde amnesia that has not been
      reported previously.

TI  - A patient with multiple sclerosis and Down's syndrome with a rare paroxysmal
      symptom at onset.
PG  - 505-7
AB  - Down's syndrome (DS) is often associated with autoimmune diseases, although an
      association with multiple sclerosis (MS) has not been previously reported. A
      49-year-old male with DS experienced progressively worsening gait and bladder
      dysfunction. Following Poser criteria, the patient was diagnosed with
      laboratory-supported definite MS. Ten days following diagnosis the patient
      experienced dysestetic paroxysmal pain at the pelvic level (an uncommon complaint
      in MS) which was initially addressed with carbamazepine, resulting in mild relief
      and adverse effects consisting of increased motor deficit and decreased daytime
      alertness. A titration combination of lamotrigine and gabapentin, two relatively 
      new antiepileptic drugs which have been utilized individually for a number of
      neurological symptoms, resulted in significant reduction in pain frequency and
      intensity, with no adverse effects. This case study presents details of the first
      reported association of DS and MS, between which the pathogenetic relationship
      remains unclear. The presence of a rare symptom complaint in MS, as well as the
      effective combination of lamotrigine and gabapentin for treating this symptom,
      without adverse effects is an additional interesting aspect of this case.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride for the prophylaxis
      of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in South Africa.
PG  - 741-9
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of
      atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride combination therapy for the prophylaxis of
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria in at-risk nonimmune subjects in South Africa. This
      open-label trial was conducted at research sites in South Africa during the main 
      malaria transmission season, February through July. The study volunteers were
      temporarily living in, or traveling to, a malaria-endemic area. They received I
      tablet of 250 mg atovaquone and 100 mg proguanil hydrochloride once daily for up 
      to 10 weeks. Subjects were monitored using sequential clinical and laboratory
      assessments. Thick blood smears were stained and evaluated by a central
      laboratory. An immunochromatographic test for P. falciparum was also used for
      on-site patient management. Prophylactic success was summarized using a 95%
      confidence interval for the proportion of subjects who did not develop
      parasitemia or who withdrew due to a treatment-related adverse event. A total of 
      175 subjects (15% women) were enrolled in the trial. The mean duration of drug
      exposure was 8.9 weeks. The combination of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride
      was well tolerated. The most frequently reported adverse events considered
      possibly related to study treatment were headache (7%), abdominal pain (2%),
      increased cough (2%), and skin disorder (2%). No serious adverse events were
      reported, and no treatment-emergent effects were noted for any laboratory
      variables. One subject who was noncompliant with therapy developed parasitemia,
      and 3 subjects withdrew due to a treatment-related adverse event (2 subjects with
      headache and 1 with nausea and dizziness). The prophylaxis success rate was 97%. 
      In this study, atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride combination therapy had an 
      excellent safety and efficacy profile for prophylaxis of P. falciparum malaria in
      nonimmune subjects.

TI  - Dystonia as a presenting feature of the 3243 mitochondrial DNA mutation.
PG  - 488-91
AB  - A variety of neurologic phenotypes have been described in patients with
      mitochondrial disorders. We report a 32-year-old man in whom dystonia was the
      salient and presenting feature of a mitochondrial DNA mutation. He presented at
      age 23 with writer's cramp and progressed over 5 years to exhibit dystonia in
      facial muscles and lower limbs. He also has exercise intolerance, mild, bilateral
      ptosis, proximal muscle weakness, and sensorineural hearing loss. Molecular
      genetic analysis of blood, urine, and muscle biopsy demonstrated the presence of 
      a heteroplasmic point mutation at nucleotide position 3243. The 3243 mtDNA
      mutation has pleomorphic manifestations, and dystonia should be added to the list
      of associated clinical features.

TI  - Safety issues concerning the use of disulfiram in treating alcohol dependence.
PG  - 427-35
AB  - Disulfiram is known to cause hepatitis, which is sometimes fatal. The best
      estimate of the frequency of disulfiram-induced fatal hepatitis is 1 case in
      30,000 patients treated/year. Its appears to be more common in patients given
      disulfiram for the treatment of nickel sensitivity. Frequent blood testing for
      liver function is probably not necessary, but patients taking disulfiram should
      be in regular contact with a physician. There are rare reports of psychosis and
      confusional states in conjunction with disulfiram treatment and peripheral
      neuropathy and optic neuritis have been reported; these effects are dose-related.
      Psychiatric complications appear to be more common with the use of disulfiram in 
      India than in Western countries. Of the less serious adverse effects, tiredness, 
      headache and sleepiness are the most common. Deaths from the disulfiram-alcohol
      (ethanol) interaction have not been reported in recent years, possibly because
      the dosages used are lower than those used 40 years ago, and patients with
      cardiac disease are now excluded from treatment. There is no evidence to suggest 
      that disulfiram causes cancer. Of note, there are drug interactions with
      compounds that utilise the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Disulfiram can be
      viewed as a drug with a moderate record of adverse effects. Alcohol dependence,
      for which it can be a helpful treatment, is associated with a high morbidity and 
      mortality.

TI  - Management of toenail onychomycosis.
PG  - 865-71
AB  - The treatment of toenail onychomycosis is reviewed. Onychomycosis contributes to 
      40% of all nail disorders and appears to be increasing in frequency. Mycotic nail
      infections are usually caused by dermatophytes, yeasts, and nondermatophyte
      molds. Most cases of toenail onychomycosis are caused by dermatophytes. Mycotic
      nail infections do not always resolve spontaneously and may have a substantial
      impact on the patient's quality of life. Current treatment modalities for
      onychomycosis include surgery, topical antifungals, and oral antifungals. Surgery
      is generally not recommended as first-line therapy. Broad-spectrum topical and
      oral antifungal agents are the most frequently used treatments. Topical treatment
      is well tolerated but is usually not effective because of poor patient compliance
      and inadequate penetration of the nail. Oral antifungals are more successful but 
      carry greater risks. Griseofulvin and ketoconazole have been oral antifungals
      traditionally used for onychomycosis, but these agents are associated with
      relatively low cure rates. Itraconazole and terbinafine are both safe and
      effective first-line agents, with reported overall cure rates of 50-90% for
      dermatophyte-related onychomycosis. Intermittent oral antifungal therapy may
      reduce the risk of systemic adverse effects and the cost of therapy; more study
      of this approach is needed. Oral antifungal agents offer patients with toenail
      onychomycosis greater likelihood of a cure than topical antifungals, but oral
      therapy carries greater risks and requires closer monitoring.

TI  - Tiagabine: new preparation. Refractory partial epilepsy: another alternative.
PG  - 99-101
AB  - (1) Tiagabine combination therapy has been assessed in quality clinical trials.
      (2) In patients with partial epilepsy placebo-controlled trials have shown that, 
      in combination with an antiepileptic treatment considered ineffective, tiagabine 
      reduces the frequency of seizures by at least 50% in approximately a quarter of
      patients. (3) Its efficacy does not appear to be superior to that of viga batrin,
      gabapentin, lamotrigine or progabide, but there have been no direct comparisons
      between tiagabine and these other antiepileptic drugs. (4) The main adverse
      effects of tiagabine are neuropsychological. No serious adverse effects have been
      described. (5) Tiagabine is not an enzyme inducer but efficacy can be reduced if 
      it is combined with enzyme-inducing antiepileptics. (6) Tiagabine therapy cannot 
      be monitored using plasma drug levels.

TI  - Symptoms of recurrent intrathecal baclofen withdrawal resulting from drug
      delivery failure: a case report.
PG  - 272-7
AB  - A 24-yr-old, completely (T8) paraplegic male patient presenting with severe
      spasticity had a drug administration device implanted in April 1991 for
      continuous intrathecal administration of baclofen. After a period of remarkable
      improvement in both the spasticity level and his quality of life, the patient
      experienced several short-lasting episodes of increased spasticity, with severe
      spasms. Among the possible causes of these deleterious episodes were
      microcrystalluria, obstipation, a decubitus ulcer, a foreign body in the
      buttocks, drug tolerance to baclofen, electromagnetic interference, and erroneous
      filling and programing of the pump. The catheter was the most common source of
      intrathecal baclofen withdrawal symptoms and had to be changed four times in 5
      yr. Intrathecal baclofen administered through an implantable drug administration 
      device is a highly effective but complex and expensive procedure that requires
      careful patient selection and close monitoring by highly qualified and
      well-trained health professional. Withdrawal symptoms may be related to
      noncompliance on the part of the patient, erroneous filling or programing of the 
      pump, depletion of the battery, random component failure, concomitant illness,
      drug tolerance, or advancement of the disease itself. When failure of the device 
      is suspected, substitution with oral baclofen is recommended until a full work-up
      is performed to determine the defect.

TI  - Continuously infused intrathecal baclofen for spastic/dystonic hemiplegia: a
      preliminary report.
PG  - 247-54
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine whether the continuous intrathecal
      delivery of baclofen will control spastic hypertonia associated with
      long-standing hemiplegia from acquired brain injury. Six hemiparetic patients
      (average age, 50 (range, 42-66) yr) with more than 6 mo of disabling lower limb
      spastic hypertonia on one side caused by either a unilateral traumatic brain
      injury or a stroke were recruited in a consecutive manner. The setting was a
      tertiary care outpatient and inpatient rehabilitation center directly attached to
      a university hospital. Patients were screened via a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, crossover design to receive either an intrathecally
      administered bolus injection of normal saline or 50 microg of baclofen. Data for 
      Ashworth rigidity scores, spasm scores, and deep tendon reflex scores were
      collected on the affected upper limb and lower limb side. Those who dropped an
      average of two points on their affected lower limb side Ashworth scores were then
      offered computer-controlled pump implantation for continuous intrathecal
      administration of baclofen. Differences over time were assessed via descriptive
      statistics and Wilcoxon's signed-rank test. After 3 mo of treatment, the average 
      lower limb Ashworth score on the affected side decreased from 3.7 +/- 1.0 to 1.9 
      +/- 0.6 standard deviation (SD) (P < 0.0001), the reflex score from 1.8 +/- 1.3
      to 0.5 +/- 0.8 SD (P = 0.0208), and the spasm score from 1.3 +/- 1.2 to 0.8 +/-
      1.3 SD (P > 0.05). The average upper limb Ashworth score on the affected side
      decreased from 3.4 +/- 0.9 to 2.1 +/- 0.9 SD (P = 0.0002), the reflex score from 
      2.3 +/- 0.5 to 1.7 +/- 0.5 SD (P > 0.050, and the spasm score from 0.8 +/- 1.3 to
      0 +/- 0 SD (P > 0.05). The average intrathecally administered dose of baclofen
      that was required to attain these effects was 205.3 microg, which was
      continuously infused for 24 h. Continuous intrathecal infusion of baclofen is
      capable of maintaining a reduction in the dystonia on the hemiparetic side
      without significantly affecting motor strength on the normal side.

TI  - Recent developments in drug therapy for multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 110-20
AB  - Symptomatic treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) includes a diverse range of
      drugs intended to relieve the specific symptoms with which a patient may present 
      at a particular point in the progression of the disease. These drugs, not
      specifically designed for the treatment of MS, may include antispastic agents
      (e.g. baclofen), drugs to reduce tremor (e.g. clonazepam), anticholinergics (e.g.
      oxybutynin) which relieve urinary symptoms, anti-epileptics (e.g. carbamazepine) 
      to control neuralgia, stimulants to reduce fatigue (e.g. amantadine), and
      antidepressants (e.g. fluoxetine) to treat depression. The treatment of acute
      relapses or exacerbations is dominated by corticosteroids such as
      methylprednisolone. The most active area of current investigation is the
      development of drugs which will inhibit the progression of the disease process
      itself, and in this category the beta- and alpha-interferons are the most
      effective drugs currently available, although many new treatments are currently
      in trials, including immunoglobulin, copolymer-1. bovine myelin, T-cell receptor 
      (TCR) peptide vaccines, platelet activating factor (PAF) antagonists, matrix
      metallo-proteinase inhibitors, campath-1, and insulin-like growth factor (IGF).

TI  - The role of excitotoxicity in neurodegenerative disease: implications for
      therapy.
PG  - 163-221
AB  - Glutamic acid is the principal excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian
      central nervous system. Glutamic acid binds to a variety of excitatory amino acid
      receptors, which are ligand-gated ion channels. It is activation of these
      receptors that leads to depolarisation and neuronal excitation. In normal
      synaptic functioning, activation of excitatory amino acid receptors is
      transitory. However, if, for any reason, receptor activation becomes excessive or
      prolonged, the target neurones become damaged and eventually die. This process of
      neuronal death is called excitotoxicity and appears to involve sustained
      elevations of intracellular calcium levels. Impairment of neuronal energy
      metabolism may sensitise neurones to excitotoxic cell death. The principle of
      excitotoxicity has been well-established experimentally, both in in vitro systems
      and in vivo, following administration of excitatory amino acids into the nervous 
      system. A role for excitotoxicity in the aetiology or progression of several
      human neurodegenerative diseases has been proposed, which has stimulated much
      research recently. This has led to the hope that compounds that interfere with
      glutamatergic neurotransmission may be of clinical benefit in treating such
      diseases. However, except in the case of a few very rare conditions, direct
      evidence for a pathogenic role for excitotoxicity in neurological disease is
      missing. Much attention has been directed at obtaining evidence for a role for
      excitotoxicity in the neurological sequelae of stroke, and there now seems to be 
      little doubt that such a process is indeed a determining factor in the extent of 
      the lesions observed. Several clinical trials have evaluated the potential of
      antiglutamate drugs to improve outcome following acute ischaemic stroke, but to
      date, the results of these have been disappointing. In amyotrophic lateral
      sclerosis, neurolathyrism, and human immunodeficiency virus dementia complex,
      several lines of circumstantial evidence suggest that excitotoxicity may
      contribute to the pathogenic process. An antiglutamate drug, riluzole, recently
      has been shown to provide some therapeutic benefit in the treatment of
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease are
      examples of neurodegenerative diseases where mitochondrial dysfunction may
      sensitise specific populations of neurones to excitotoxicity from synaptic
      glutamic acid. The first clinical trials aimed at providing neuroprotection with 
      antiglutamate drugs are currently in progress for these two diseases.

TI  - Functional MRI-BOLD of visually triggered headache in patients with migraine.
PG  - 548-54
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spreading depression of Leao has been hypothesized as the basis for
      the visual aura of the migraine attack, supported by cerebral blood flow
      measurements of spreading hypoperfusion. The early depolarizing or activation
      phase of experimental spreading depression, however, is associated with a
      transient but pronounced cerebral blood flow increase that precedes spreading
      hypoperfusion. OBJECTIVE: To study this early phase of the migraine attack, we
      investigated visually triggered attacks of headache and visual symptoms using a
      red-green checkerboard stimulus in patients with migraine. INTERVENTIONS: We
      studied occipital cortex activation during visual stimulation by measuring
      occipital cortex perfusion with functional magnetic resonance imaging-blood
      oxygenation level-dependent contrast in 10 patients with migraine with aura and 2
      patients with migraine without aura and 6 healthy subjects. RESULTS: In 6
      patients with migraine with aura and 2 patients with migraine without aura, their
      typical headache with (n = 2) or without visual change was visually triggered at 
      7.3 minutes (mean time) after visual stimulation began. In 5 of these patients,
      the onset of headache or visual change, or both, was preceded by suppression of
      initial activation (mean onset time, 4.3 minutes; P<.001) The suppression slowly 
      propagated into contiguous occipital cortex at a rate ranging from 3 to 6 mm/
      min. This neuronal suppression was accompanied by baseline contrast intensity
      increases that indicated vasodilatation and tissue hyperoxygenation. CONCLUSIONS:
      We conclude that visually triggered headache and visual change in patients with
      migraine is accompanied by spreading suppression of initial neuronal activation
      and increased occipital cortex oxygenation. We postulate that this spreading
      suppression may be associated with initial activation of a migraine attack,
      independent of whether there are associated aura symptoms. We further postulate
      that there may be an association between vasodilation accompanying the initial
      stage of suppression and the induction of headache.

TI  - Lessons to be learned: a case study approach: prolonged methaemoglobinaemia due
      to inadvertent dapsone poisoning; treatment with methylene blue and exchange
      transfusion.
PG  - 52-5
AB  - The authors present a case of methaemoglobinaemia of acute onset, with an
      unusually protracted course. The long persistence of this disorder led to a
      search for the cause which was eventually traced to medication with dapsone. The 
      latter was found to be inappropriately being taken by the patient instead of an
      antispasmodic that had been prescribed for a spinal condition; this was because
      the tablets had been incorrectly labelled and dispensed in a pharmacy. The
      patient took increasing doses of the presumed 'antispasmodic' tablets as they
      seemed to lack clinical effect, thus further exacerbating the toxic consequences.
      Moreover, the patient brought his wrongly labelled tablets into hospital and was 
      allowed to use them there, contrary to normal hospital policy. As treatment for
      the methaemoglobinaemia both bolus and continuous infusions of methylene blue
      were used, which probably contributed to the severe haemolysis which followed.
      Furthermore, the development of a rare side effect of dapsone toxicity, namely
      that of a sensorimotor neuropathy, is reported.

TI  - Epidurography and therapeutic epidural injections: technical considerations and
      experience with 5334 cases.
PG  - 697-705
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Even in experienced hands, blind epidural steroid
      injections result in inaccurate needle placement in up to 30% of cases. The use
      of fluoroscopy and radiologic contrast material provides confirmation of accurate
      needle placement within the epidural space. We describe our technique and
      experience with contrast epidurography and therapeutic epidural steroid
      injections, and review the frequency of systemic and neurologic complications.
      METHODS: Epidural steroid injections were performed in 5489 consecutive
      outpatients over a period of 5 1/2 years by three procedural neuroradiologists.
      In 155 cases (2.8%), the injections were done without contrast material owing to 
      either confirmed or suspected allergy. The remaining 5334 injections were
      performed after epidurography through the same needle. Patients and referring
      clinicians were instructed to contact us first regarding complications or any
      problem potentially related to the injection. In addition, the referring
      clinicians' offices were instructed to contact us regarding any conceivable
      procedure-related complications. RESULTS: Only 10 patients in the entire series
      required either oral (n = 5) or intravenous (n = 5) sedation. Four complications 
      (0.07%) required either transport to an emergency room (n = 2) or hospitalization
      (n = 2). None of the complications required surgical intervention, and all were
      self-limited with regard to symptoms and imaging manifestations. Fluoroscopic
      needle placement and epidurography provided visual confirmation of accurate
      needle placement, distribution of the injectate, and depiction of epidural space 
      disease. CONCLUSION: Epidurography in conjunction with epidural steroid
      injections provides for safe and accurate therapeutic injection and is associated
      with an exceedingly low frequency of untoward sequelae. It can be performed
      safely on an outpatient basis and does not require sedation or special
      monitoring.

TI  - Adding low dose meperidine to spinal lidocaine prolongs postoperative analgesia.
PG  - 327-34
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of the addition of low dose meperidine to
      spinal lidocaine on the sensory and motor blockade profile, and the quality and
      duration of postoperative analgesia. METHODS: In a randomized double blind
      prospective dose finding study 40 patients undergoing transurethral prostatectomy
      with spinal anesthetic were allocated to receive 75 mg lidocaine 5% intrathecally
      as the sole agent (group A), or co-administered with 0.15 mg x kg(-1) meperidine 
      (group B) or 0.30 mg x kg(-1) meperidine (group C). Sensory and motor blockade
      profiles were documented. Postoperatively, the amount of analgesics required,
      time to first analgesic, visual analogue scores and adverse events were recorded.
      RESULTS: Sensory blocks at or above T10 was maintained for 128, 156 and 145
      minutes in groups A, B and C respectively. There was no difference in the latency
      or duration of the motor block among the three groups. Patients in group C had
      lower visual analogue pain scores (VAPS) over time than did those in groups A and
      B (P < 0.05). Time to first analgesia was longer (429 +/- 197 minutes) in group C
      than in group A (254 +/- 157 minutes) (P < 0.05). Fewer patients in group C
      required parenteral opioid postoperatively than in group A (P < 0.05). The
      incidence of bradycardia was higher in the groups receiving meperidine. No
      symptoms of transient radicular irritation (TRI) were reported in the groups
      receiving meperidine. CONCLUSION: The addition of 0.3 mg x kg(-1) of meperidine
      to spinal lidocaine prolongs postoperative analgesia without delaying discharge
      from post anesthetic care unit (Table II) and reduces the requirement for
      parenteral analgesics (Table III).

TI  - Recommendations for physical activity in patients with multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 179-91
AB  - For many years, patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), an inflammatory
      demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, have been advised to avoid
      exercise. MS is believed to be autoimmune in origin, mediated by activated T
      cells which penetrate the blood-brain barrier and attack myelin. The
      pathophysiology, with respect to function is an impairment of saltatory
      conduction, specifically, slowing of conduction speed and/or conduction block.
      Symptoms can temporarily worsen on exposure to heat or during physical exercise. 
      Exercise programmes must be designed to activate working muscles but avoid
      overload that results in conduction block. Fatigue, often severe, affects about
      85% of MS patients and, along with motor and sensory symptoms, results in
      decreased mobility and reduced quality of life. Physical activity and recreation 
      are reduced in patients with MS. Before developing recommendations, physical
      activity patterns and the physical effects of MS should be assessed in individual
      patients. Patients may then be functionally classified. Physical activity can
      also be classified in a pyramid structure, with the most basic functions forming 
      the base and the most integrated functions on top. The muscular fitness pyramid
      progresses through passive range of motion, active resistive, specific
      strengthening and integrated strength exercises Overall physical activity may be 
      increased according to functional level by performing activities of daily living,
      incorporating inefficiencies into daily living, pursuing more active recreation
      and eventually developing a structured exercise programme. The importance of the 
      proper exercise environment, balance and coordination issues and factors related 
      to adherence are discussed.

TI  - The safety and tolerability of zolpidem--an update.
PG  - 81-93
AB  - Zolpidem belongs to a new class of hypnotic agents, chemically distinct from the 
      pre-existing ones, and has a unique neuropharmacological profile. It induces
      sedative/hypnotic effects in rodents at doses much lower than those for
      anticonvulsant and myorelaxant activities. Clinically, zolpidem is indicated for 
      the short term treatment of insomnia. It has a short half-life (2.4h), with no
      active metabolite, and does not accumulate during repeated administration. The
      pharmacokinetic profile associated with the absence of active metabolites is
      consistent with the short duration of action and absence of residual effects that
      have been observed. Polysomnographic experience indicates that zolpidem induces a
      sleep pattern which is similar to that of physiological sleep, and which produces
      either no or only minimal effects on sleep architecture after abrupt
      discontinuation. Aspects of the general safety of zolpidem have been studied in
      data obtained from healthy volunteers and patients, both adult and elderly,
      during its clinical development and in post-marketing experience. Zolpidem
      appears to be well-tolerated in adults and in the elderly, when administered in
      accordance with prescribing instructions. The available data indicate that, in
      these circumstances, the risk of abuse or dependence is minimal.

TI  - Patient-controlled analgesia: An efficient therapeutic tool in the postoperative 
      setting.
PG  - 112-21
AB  - Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) is one of the newer techniques for pain
      management. It was developed in reaction to the large number of unsatisfied
      postoperative patients suffering from moderate to severe pain despite the
      availability of potent analgesic drugs. With PCA, patients are allowed to
      self-administer small analgesic doses into a running intravenous infusion,
      intramuscularly, subcutaneously or even into the spinal space. Clinical
      experience soon demonstrated that individual variability in pain intensity and
      analgesic needs was extremely large. Psychological factors seem to be as
      important as the surgical trauma. Opioid consumption is usually higher than with 
      conventional regimens, but without serious side effects. Although patients
      generally prefer self-control, pain relief is not necessarily better than with
      well-conducted conventional techniques. In addition to routine clinical pain
      management, PCA has proven its importance in research, e.g. for pain measurement,
      to determine predictors of postoperative pain, to evaluate drug interactions and 
      the concept of pre-emptive analgesia, or for pharmacokinetic designs. PCA has
      been extremely important in order to change the mind of physicians and nursing
      staff with respect to individual pain management strategies.

TI  - Nefopam strongly depresses the nociceptive flexion (R(III)) reflex in humans.
PG  - 399-404
AB  - Nefopam hydrochloride has been commercialized as an analgesic drug in most
      Western European countries for 20 years. It has been shown to possess analgesic
      activity with a profile distinct from that of opioids or anti-inflammatory drugs.
      In order to define the mechanisms of action of this pharmacological agent, we
      studied, in a double-blind and cross-over fashion, its effects on the nociceptive
      flexion (R(III)) reflex and the corresponding pain sensation in ten healthy
      volunteers. The R(III), reflex elicited by electrical stimulation of the sural
      nerve was recorded from the biceps femoris. Two experiments were performed on
      each volunteer at an interval of 7 days. On each experimental day, four
      recruitment (intensity-response) curves of the R(III) reflex were constructed:
      before (control period) and then 30, 60 and 90 min after the intravenous
      injection of nefopam (20 mg) or a placebo. Nefopam induced a powerful depression 
      of the nociceptive R(III) reflex. It increased the threshold of the reflex and
      decreased the slope of the recruitment curve. At the same time, it decreased the 
      painful sensations (as measured with a visual analogue scale(VAS)) elicited by
      the maximum stimulus intensity. These data suggest that nefopam probably produces
      its analgesic action through central (spinal and/or supraspinal) mechanisms.
      However, complementary peripheral mechanisms cannot be excluded on the basis of
      the present study. In view of these results, it seems that new clinical studies
      will have to be undertaken to revisit this potent analgesic agent and try to
      limit its adverse effects (i.e. nausea, vomiting, sweating). Its fast onset of
      action could clearly be an advantage, notably in the treatment of post-operative 
      pain.

TI  - Neonatal tetanus: a continuing challenge in the southeast of Turkey: risk
      factors, clinical features and prognostic factors.
PG  - 171-4
AB  - Neonatal tetanus (NT) still causes significant mortality in developing countries,
      although in 1989 WHO adopted the goal of eliminating the disease by 1995-2000. To
      characterize the regional characteristics, clinical charts of 55 neonates (42
      males and 13 females) admitted to the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Ward of Dicle
      University Hospital, Diyarbakir, Turkey with the diagnosis of NT from 1991 to
      1997 were reviewed. Mean age at admittance was 8.9+/-4.3 days with a range of
      3-25 days. Mean period for the appearance of first symptoms was 5.8 days ranging 
      between 1 and 21 days. Mean birth weight of the patients was 3369+/-560g. All
      patients were from rural areas and were delivered at home by untrained
      traditional birth attendants with no prior antenatal healthcare services. Razor
      blade (55%), scissors (27%), and knife (18%) were the instruments used to cut the
      cord in non-hygienic conditions. No mothers had prior vaccination with tetanus
      toxoid during their pregnancy. Spasticity (76%), lack of sucking (71%), trismus
      (60%), fever (49%), omphalitis (44%), irritability (24%), risus sardonicus (22%),
      and opithotonus (15%) were the most common presenting signs and symptoms. Age at 
      admission < 7.5 days and symptoms of onset <4.9 days, risus sardonicus and
      opisthotonus were associated with fatal outcome. All patients were treated with
      human tetanus immunglobulin or equine tetanus antitoxin where available,
      antibiotic therapy by penicillin G (100.000 U/kg/day) and intravenous high dose
      diazepam (40 mg/kg/day). Overall mortality rate was 40% (22 cases), without any
      equipment for mechanical ventilation. Health education of mothers and birth
      attendants, promotion of hospital delivery and prenatal tetanus immunization of
      all pregnant women particularly in rural areas are recommended, if NT is to be
      prevented.

AB  - Sometimes neurologists face malpractice suits that occur from cases when a
      patient's diagnosis is not foreseeable. This requires that neurologists make
      clear and accurate notes on patient charts to show current reasoning in
      expectation that eventually, the neurologist may have to defend his or her
      misdiagnosis in court. Two current trial cases are presented in this article. You

TI  - Felbamate in refractory partial epilepsy.
PG  - 43-8
AB  - This open-label study was performed to evaluate efficacy and safety of Felbamate 
      (FBM) add-on therapy in drug-refractory partial epilepsy. We evaluated 36
      patients (12 males) aged 11-68 years (mean 29.8) in which FBM was titrated
      gradually from 300 mg/day to a mean total maintenance daily dose of 1936 mg.
      Patients were monitored according to clinical practice and performed regularly
      laboratory tests. Mean follow-up of FBM therapy was 10 months (range 2-27). In
      this study, 5% of patients resulted to be seizure-free, 11% showed a seizure
      reduction more than 75%, 23% decreased their seizure frequency between 50% and
      75% (P = 0.0001). The adverse events which were reported more frequently were:
      nausea, vomiting, anorexia and weight loss. Even if the patients sample is small 
      FBM proves its efficacy in partial epilepsy, showing a relatively well tolerated 
      profile.

TI  - Classification of tremor and update on treatment.
PG  - 1565-72
AB  - Tremor is a symptom of many disorders, including Parkinson's disease, essential
      tremor, orthostatic tremor, cerebellar disease, peripheral neuropathy and alcohol
      withdrawal. Tremors may be classified as postural, rest or action tremors.
      Symptomatic treatment is tailored to the tremor type. Combination therapy with
      carbidopa and levodopa remains the first-line approach for parkinsonian tremor.
      Essential tremor may be amenable to propranolol or primidone. Propranolol may be 
      useful in treating alcohol withdrawal tremor, and isoniazid may control the
      cerebellar tremor associated with multiple sclerosis. Clonazepam may relieve
      orthostatic tremor. Other agents are also available for the treatment of tremor. 
      When medical therapy fails to control the tremor, surgical options such as
      thalamotomy, pallidotomy and thalamic stimulation should be considered in severe 
      cases. Thalamic stimulation, the most recent of these surgical approaches, offers
      the advantage over ablative procedures of alleviating tremor without the creation
      of a permanent lesion.

TI  - 3-substituted GABA analogs with central nervous system activity: a review.
PG  - 149-77
AB  - Gabapentin and Pregabalin are both 3-alkylated gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA)
      analogs. Gabapentin was designed as a lipophilic GABA analog and was first
      synthesized as a potential anticonvulsant and was launched in 1994 as add-on
      therapy for the treatment of epilepsy. In this review the discovery and
      development of gabapentin as an anticonvulsant are discussed. During human trials
      and while in clinical use, it became apparent that gabapentin induced some other 
      potentially useful therapeutic effects in chronic pain states and behavioral
      disorders. A review of animal and clinical data relating to these other potential
      therapeutic utilities is presented. Pregabalin was identified after an
      investigation into other 3-substituted GABA analogs. It has since been shown to
      have a similar pharmacological profile to gabapentin with greater potency in
      preclinical models of pain and epilepsy. Studies of the mechanism(s) of action of
      these compounds are discussed. Work towards identifying new analogs of both
      gabapentin and pregabalin is also reviewed.

TI  - Spasticity in children with cerebral palsy: a retrospective review of the effects
      of intrathecal baclofen.
PG  - 49-61
AB  - The administration of baclofen by intrathecal pump is a new technique used to
      reduce spasticity for individuals with upper motor neuron system injuries.
      Children with cerebral palsy often have difficulty in mobility because of this
      form of spasticity. The purpose of this study was to assess the functional
      outcomes of intrathecal baclofen pump therapy with spasticity in children with
      cerebral palsy. A retrospective review of medical records for pediatric cerebral 
      palsy patients receiving intrathecal baclofen for intractable spasticity was
      performed. Of 23 sequential medical records meeting requirements for inclusion in
      the study, 17 subjects had sufficient recorded data to be included in the study. 
      Data from the medical records included Ashworth scores, therapy complications,
      and changes in mobility and independence. Although no significant changes in the 
      upper extremities with intrathecal baclofen occurred at one and three months, the
      trial bolus showed statistically significant changes in mean Ashworth scores. The
      pre- and posttrial bolus Ashworth scores for the lower extremities showed
      statistically significant decreases in the posttrial scores and at one and three 
      months when compared with the pretrial scores (p < .001). Complications were
      resolved with conservative management without long-term sequelae. No infections, 
      respiratory depressions, or deaths occurred as a result of intrathecal baclofen
      therapy in this study. Although intrathecal baclofen had a significant effect in 
      reducing lower extremity spasticity in children with cerebral palsy, further
      prospective studies are needed to determine the effects of intrathecal baclofen
      on such indicators as activities of daily living.

TI  - MRI abnormalities associated with partial status epilepticus.
PG  - 1021-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report neuroimaging findings in patients with complex partial
      status epilepticus. BACKGROUND: During status epilepticus, neuroimaging may be
      used to exclude other neurologic conditions. Therefore, it is important to
      identify the neuroimaging features that are associated with status epilepticus.
      In addition, MRI characteristics may provide insight into the pathophysiologic
      changes during status epilepticus. METHODS: The history and neuroimaging
      examination results of three patients with complex partial status epilepticus
      were reviewed. Studies obtained during status epilepticus included
      diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI), MR angiography (MRA), postcontrast T1-weighted MRI,
      T2-weighted MRI, and CT. Follow-up MRI was obtained in two patients, and autopsy 
      results were available for the third. RESULTS: Some of the MRI and CT findings
      during partial status epilepticus mimicked those of acute ischemic stroke: DWI
      and T2-weighted MRI showed cortical hyperintensity with a corresponding low
      apparent diffusion coefficient, and CT showed an area of decreased attenuation
      with effacement of sulci and loss of gray-white differentiation. However, the
      lesions did not respect vascular territories, there was increased signal of the
      ipsilateral middle cerebral artery on MRA, and leptomeningeal enhancement
      appeared on postcontrast MRI. On follow-up imaging, the abnormalities had
      resolved, but some cerebral atrophy was present. CONCLUSIONS: The radiologic
      characteristics of status epilepticus resemble those of ischemic stroke but can
      be differentiated based on lesion location and findings on MRA and postcontrast
      MRI. The MRI abnormalities indicated the presence of cytotoxic and vasogenic
      edema, hyperperfusion of the epileptic region, and alteration of the
      leptomeningeal blood-brain barrier. These changes reversed, but they resulted in 
      some regional brain atrophy.

TI  - Plasma anti-serotonin and serotonin anti-idiotypic antibodies are elevated in
      panic disorder.
PG  - 386-91
AB  - The psychoneuroimmunology of panic disorder is relatively unexplored. Alterations
      within brain stress systems that secondarily influence the immune system have
      been documented. A recent report indicated elevations of serotonin (5-HT) and
      ganglioside antibodies in patients with primary fibromyalgia, a condition with
      documented associations with panic disorder. In line with our interest in
      dysregulated 5-HT systems in panic disorder (PD), we wished to assess if
      antibodies directed at the 5-HT system were elevated in patients with PD in
      comparison to healthy volunteers. Sixty-three patients with panic disorder and 26
      healthy volunteers were diagnosed by the SCID. Employing ELISA, we measured
      anti-5-HT and 5-HT anti-idiotypic antibodies (which are directed at 5-HT
      receptors). To include all subjects in one experiment, three different batches
      were run during the ELISA. Plasma serotonin anti-idiotypic antibodies: there was 
      a significant group effect [patients > controls (p = .007)] and batch effect but 
      no interaction. The mean effect size for the three batches was .76. Following
      Z-score transformation of each separate batch and then combining all scores,
      patients demonstrated significantly elevated levels of plasma serotonin
      anti-idiotypic antibodies. Neither sex nor age as covariates affected the
      significance of the results. There was a strong correlation between
      anti-serotonin antibody and serotonin anti-idiotypic antibody measures. Plasma
      anti-serotonin antibodies: there was a significant diagnosis effect [patients >
      controls (p = .037)]. Mean effect size for the three batches was .52. Upon
      Z-score transformation, there was a diagnosis effect with antibody elevations in 
      patients. Covaried for sex and age, the result falls below significance to trend 
      levels. The data raise the possibility that psychoimmune dysfunction,
      specifically related to the 5-HT system, may be present in PD. Potential
      interruption of 5-HT neurotransmission through autoimmune mechanisms may be of
      pathophysiologic significance in certain patients with panic disorder. It remains
      to be demonstrated if the peripheral autoimmunity is representative of CNS 5-HT
      neuronal alterations. Replication appears warranted.

TI  - Aggressive pharmacologic treatment of pain.
PG  - 193-213, vii
AB  - In this article, the author outlines the pharmacology of nociception and
      discusses the two major classes of drugs used for pain control: opioids and
      nonopioid analgesics. In order to provide satisfactory pain relief and prevent
      the possible sequelae of untreated pain, physicians must possess both knowledge
      and expertise in the use of opioid and nonopioid analgesics. Opioid analgesics
      have been underused in the management of pain. Opioids have a higher analgesic
      potency and wider range of indications than any of the other currently available 
      medications for pain control. The second class of drugs, the nonopioid analgesics
      and adjuvants, has recently expanded to include new and potentially beneficial
      medications. This article furthers the understanding on how to use analgesics for
      a prompt, safe, and effective pharmacologic treatment of acute and chronic pain.

TI  - The analgesic effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
PG  - 407-13
AB  - This paper endeavours to provide a critical clinical review of the use of
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in the management of pain. Case
      reports, placebo-controlled trials and trials comparing SSRIs with tricyclic
      antidepressants (TCAs) are considered. The analgesic effects of TCAs are well
      known and this review suggests that there is little evidence for their
      replacement by SSRIs in pain management. There are, at present, too few
      comparative drug trials to make a definitive statement, although the trend is
      clearly against SSRIs.

TI  - Olanzapine serum concentrations in psychiatric patients given standard doses: the
      influence of comedication.
PG  - 87-90
AB  - We recorded steady state serum concentrations of olanzapine in 56 psychiatric
      patients under routine conditions. Twenty-two patients (39%) underwent
      monotherapy; the rest received additional psychotropic drugs. Doses were given
      once daily in the evening, and serum olanzapine levels were measured 12 hours
      later. For the whole group, the concentration-to-dose ratio (C/D) varied 26-fold,
      with a median value of 4.8 (nmol/L)/(mg/24 hours), but 80% of the patients had
      C/D values within the range 2 to 10 (nmol/L)/(mg/24 hours). All but three
      patients received standard doses (5-20 mg/24 hours), of whom 80% had serum
      concentrations of olanzapine within the range 22 to 146 nmol/L. Patients
      comedicated with potential inhibitors of CYP2D6 and other drugs displayed a
      median C/D approximately 40% higher than the group undergoing monotherapy.
      Patients comedicated with carbamazepine had a median C/D 36% lower than that of
      the monotherapy group. Therefore, the serum concentration range (12-hour values) 
      of 25 to 150 nmol/L can be expected for patients receiving a standard daily dose.

AB  - A man with severe inflammatory bowel disease suffered from chronic abdominal pain
      and depression. A transdermal amitriptyline gel preparation was compounded since 
      he was unable to take drugs orally Serum concentrations of amitriptyline and its 
      active metabolite nortriptyline were measured over 24 hours. Symptoms of
      depression were monitored before starting transdermal therapy and at the end of 6
      weeks. Pain symptoms and amitriptyline adverse drug events were monitored daily
      Steady-state serum concentrations of drug and metabolite were within the
      therapeutic range over 24 hours. The patient reported that his mood was improved 
      but his abdominal pain remained unchanged. Transdermal amitriptyline gel was well
      tolerated and is an alternative delivery system in patients unable to take drugs 
      orally.

      dyssynergia.
PG  - 54-7
AB  - This study is an analysis of the Memotherm prosthesis in spinal cord injured
      patients with Detrusor-external sphincter dyssynergia (DESD). Twenty-four
      patients were evaluated urodynamically before and after placement of the
      intraurethral stent prosthesis. All the patients had been chronically managed
      with an indwelling urinary catheter, intermittent catheterization or condom
      catheters. Sixty-six per cent had history of recurrent urinary tract infection,
      37% had symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia. Nine patients had previous external
      sphincterotomy. Follow-up ranged from 3 39 months (mean 15.4 months). After stent
      insertion all patients were able to achieve spontaneous reflex voiding with the
      use of condom catheter. Postoperative urodynamics parameters bladder leak point
      pressure and residual urine volume decreased significantly after stent insertion.
      Stent insertion was accomplished without any operative complications. In four
      patients stent migration (16%) required telescoping a new system over the
      migrated stent. In two patients the stent was removed because of problems of
      infection and calculus formation. In conclusion, this system (Memotherm) is an
      attractive, and potentially reversible treatment for DESD in SCI patients.

TI  - An audit of the perceived efficacy and tolerability of gabapentin therapy in an
      out-patient cohort with chronic epilepsy.
PG  - 111-3
AB  - A retrospective audit of the perceived efficacy and tolerability of adjunctive
      gabapentin (GBT) therapy in patients with intractable epilepsy was carried out.
      The case-notes of 263 consecutive patients attending a tertiary referral centre
      in whom GBT had been added to concomitant anti-epileptic drugs were reviewed.
      There were 119 males (45%); the median age was 35 years (range 15-81 years) and
      the median duration of epilepsy was 20 years. The median dose of GBT administered
      was 1,600 mg (range 300-4,800 mg). Twenty-nine patients (11%) had a reduction in 
      seizure frequency of greater than 50% and 7 (3%) achieved seizure freedom of 6
      months' duration at least while taking GBT. Side-effects were reported by 169
      patients (61%) and in 40 (15%) an increase in seizure frequency of 50% occurred, 
      this being the commonest reason for GBT withdrawal. The median duration of
      treatment was 4 months (range 0.03-47 months). Ten patients, in whom GBT therapy 
      had proven ineffective in doses of 900-1,800 mg, were rechallenged with doses of 
      300-4,800 mg. One individual experienced a 50% reduction in seizure frequency and
      1 an increase in seizures of at least 50%. GBT was generally well tolerated at
      high doses and rechallenge of a small number with GBT in doses up to 4,800 mg did
      not result in further improvement in seizure frequency in the majority.

TI  - Multiple sclerosis and the urologist.
PG  - 743-57
AB  - PURPOSE: We provide an updated reference detailing the neurological and
      urological state of the art approach to multiple sclerosis (MS) with special
      emphasis on the pathology and physiology, effects on the genitourinary tract,
      diagnostic evaluation, and treatment of neurological and urological
      manifestations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A MEDLINE computerized reference search
      and manual bibliography review were performed to find pertinent peer reviewed
      articles on the neurological and urological manifestations and treatment of MS. A
      meta-analysis was performed on the urodynamic findings of 22 studies involving
      1,882 patients from well-defined MS populations. RESULTS: The majority of
      patients with MS have genitourinary symptoms ranging from urgency, urge
      incontinence and frequency to urinary retention. Symptoms do not accurately
      reflect the underlying urological pathology but parallel pyramidal tract
      dysfunction. Urodynamic evaluation has an important role in determining proper
      bladder management. The most common urodynamic finding is detrusor hyperreflexia 
      in 62% of these patients, followed by detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia in 25% and
      hypocontractility in 20%. Less than 1% of patients has renal deterioration and
      most may be treated with conservative measures. If conservative measures fail,
      new forms of bladder reconstruction and diversion may be effectively used. The
      incidence of sexual dysfunction is up to 80% in men and 72% in women, and
      treatment focuses on improvement of overall disability and erectile or orgasmic
      function. CONCLUSIONS: Although the genitourinary consequences of MS are rarely
      life threatening, they can cause significant morbidity and patient frustration.
      With the rapid advances in the medical management of MS the urologist should be
      actively involved in multispecialty treatment of these patients.

TI  - Quinine for nocturnal leg cramps: a meta-analysis including unpublished data.
PG  - 600-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: With respect to the use of quinine for the treatment of nocturnal leg 
      cramps, to determine whether the findings of a previously performed meta-analysis
      of published data are altered with the addition of unpublished data, and whether 
      publication bias is present in this area. DESIGN: A meta-analysis of eight (four 
      published and four unpublished) randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      trials, seven of which had a crossover design. SETTING: Randomized trials that
      were available as of July 1997. SUBJECTS: Ambulatory patients (659) who suffered 
      from regular nocturnal leg cramps. MAIN RESULTS: When individual patient data
      from all crossover studies were pooled, persons had 3.60 (95% confidence interval
      [CI] 2.15, 5.05) fewer cramps in a 4-week period when taking quinine compared
      with placebo. This compared with an estimate of 8.83 fewer cramps (95% CI 4.16,
      13.49) from pooling published studies alone. The corresponding relative risk
      reductions were 21% (95% CI 12%, 30%) and 43% (95% CI 21%, 65%), respectively.
      Compared with placebo, the use of quinine was associated with an increased
      incidence of side effects, particularly tinnitus. Publication bias is present in 
      the reporting of the efficacy of quinine for this indication, as almost all
      published studies reported larger estimates of its efficacy than did unpublished 
      studies. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that quinine is efficacious in the
      prevention of nocturnal leg cramps. However, its benefit may not be as large as
      reported from the pooling of published studies alone. Given the side effect
      profile of quinine, nonpharmacologic therapy (e.g., regular passive stretching of
      the affected muscle) is the best first-line treatment. For persons who find this 
      ineffective and whose quality of life is significantly affected, a trial of
      quinine is warranted. Prescribing physicians must closely monitor the risks and
      benefits in individual patients. Publication bias is present in this area even
      though there is controversy about the role of quinine in the treatment of leg
      cramps. To minimize the possibility of this bias, persons performing
      medication-related meta-analyses should seek high-quality unpublished data from
      drug regulatory agencies and pharmaceutical companies.

TI  - Tizanidine treatment of spasticity: a meta-analysis of controlled, double-blind, 
      comparative studies with baclofen and diazepam.
PG  - 241-51
AB  - To conduct a meta-analysis of the antispastic efficacy and tolerability of
      tizanidine, we reviewed records of the European sponsor of tizanidine trials and 
      selected double-blind, randomized studies of moderate duration in which oral
      tizanidine was compared with baclofen or diazepam. Studies were required to have 
      individual patient data; three key outcome measures (Ashworth Rating Scale for
      muscle tone, a measure of muscle strength, and Global Tolerability to Treatment
      Rating); and patients with multiple sclerosis or cerebrovascular lesions. Ten
      trials involving 270 patients met these criteria. Seven studies used baclofen as 
      the positive control; three used diazepam. As measured by Total and Lower Body
      Ashworth scores, tizanidine and similar spasticity-reducing effects to both
      baclofen and diazepam. Muscle strength was affected less by tizanidine than by
      either comparator, and investigators judged tizanidine to have greater
      tolerability. Within the limits of these comparisons, tizanidine, baclofen, and
      diazepam were equally effective in decreasing excessive muscle tone in patients
      with multiple sclerosis or cerebrovascular lesions. Muscle strength improved in
      all three treatment groups, but improvement was greatest with tizanidine.

TI  - Carisoprodol: a drug of continuing abuse.
PG  - 723-4
AB  - Carisoprodol (Soma) is a noncontrolled, skeletal-muscle relaxant whose active
      metabolite is meprobamate. Despite previous indications that the drug may be
      abused, it continues to be widely prescribed for musculoskeletal conditions
      involving muscle spasm. Presented here are three cases demonstrating patterns of 
      carisoprodol abuse not previously reported. Carisoprodol usage should be limited 
      to short-term treatment. Patients for whom carisoprodol is prescribed are at risk
      for meprobamate dependence.

TI  - Gabapentin for the treatment of spasticity in patients with spinal cord injury.
PG  - 686-9
AB  - Our serendipitous observations suggested that some patients with spasticity
      appeared to have improved following the administration of the anticonvulsant drug
      gabapentin. As some patients with spasticity are either refractory to or
      intolerant of established medical treatments, we conducted this study to
      investigate the effect of gabapentin on spasticity in patients with spinal cord
      injury. Twenty-five patients with spinal cord injury and spasticity received oral
      gabapentin (2400 mg over 48 h) in a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled 
      crossover study. We assessed responses by measuring the Ashworth spasticity
      scale, muscle stretch reflexes, presence of clonus and reflex response to noxious
      stimuli. Patient ratings were obtained using a Likert Scale. Administration of
      gabapentin, but not placebo, was associated with an 11% reduction in spasticity
      as measured by the Ashworth Scale (P = 0.04) and by a 20% reduction in the Likert
      Scale (P = 0.0013). Significant changes were not obtained for the other measures.
      The data obtained suggest that gabapentin may be useful in the management of
      spasticity associated with spinal cord injury.

TI  - Relationship of the antispasticity effect of tizanidine to plasma concentration
      in patients with multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 731-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spasticity is a serious problem in multiple sclerosis (MS) and many
      patients do not achieve a satisfactory response to currently available oral
      antispasticity drugs. Tizanidine hydrochloride, an alpha 2-noradrenergic agonist,
      has been shown to have an antispasticity effect in single center trials of
      patients with MS. OBJECTIVE: To compare plasma concentrations of tizanidine with 
      objective measures of muscle tone in patients with MS with moderate to severe
      spasticity. SETTING: Ten centers, all tertiary referral centers for the
      specialized treatment of patients with MS, in the United States and Canada.
      DESIGN: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-response study of
      tizanidine hydrochloride (8 or 16 mg). PATIENTS: One hundred forty-two patients
      with spastic MS who were not taking any interfering medication, such as an
      antispasticity drug or other alpha-noradrenergic agonist, entered the trial.
      RESULTS: Tizanidine treatment reduced muscle tone significantly, as shown by
      improved Ashworth scores and increased knee swing amplitude recorded by the
      pendulum test, both of which correlated significantly with plasma concentration. 
      Placebo had no significant effect on muscle tone. Dizziness, drowsiness, dry
      mouth, and fatigue were reported most often in the group treated with tizanidine 
      at peak plasma concentration. CONCLUSIONS: Tizanidine reduces spasticity in MS,
      and both therapeutic effects and side effects are related to the plasma drug
      levels.

TI  - Meprobamate overdosage: a continuing problem. Sensitive GC-MS quantitation after 
      solid phase extraction in 19 fatal cases.
PG  - 173-80
AB  - We describe a simple method for the urinary identification and blood quantitation
      of meprobamate suitable for any toxicological laboratory. After urinary screening
      using GC-MS technology, quantitation is performed by GC-MS in the selected-ion
      monitoring mode. Isolation of the drug is achieved by solid phase extraction on a
      C-18 cartridge. A specific elution is obtained by three volumes of
      acetone:triethylamine (99:1 v/v). Lidocaine is used as internal standard. RSDs
      (%) of the within-day and between-day precision studies are always less than 7.2 
      on the entire range of calibration. Linearity is inspected using an analysis of
      variance ANOVA. Homogeneity of the variances is tested using Hartley's test.
      Weighted linear regression is then computed. Limits of detection and
      quantification are given by an analysis of the blanks. The present method was
      applied in our laboratory over a period of 1 year. Meprobamate appeared as a drug
      which still has a significant frequency (5.5%) and is the most frequently
      involved in fatal pharmaceutical overdoses (15.3%). Post mortem concentrations
      ranged from 41 to 397 mg/l (mean = 182) and are compared to those of the
      literature.

TI  - A controlled evaluation of ibuprofen and diazepam for chronic orofacial muscle
      pain.
PG  - 139-46
AB  - The clinical efficacy, side effect liability, and hormonal effects of two
      prototypic pharmacologic agents were evaluated for the management of chronic
      myogenous facial pain in a double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial.
      Thirty-nine subjects (35 women,. 4 men) with daily or near-daily orofacial pain
      of at least 3 months' duration and tenderness to palpation of masticatory muscles
      participated. Patients were randomly allocated to one of four treatments:
      placebo, diazepam, ibuprofen, or the combination of diazepam and ibuprofen. Pain,
      mood, muscle tenderness, maximal interincisal opening, and plasma levels of
      beta-endorphin were measured following 2-week baseline and 4-week treatment
      periods. Pain, as measured by a visual analog scale, was significantly decreased 
      in the diazepam and diazepam plus ibuprofen groups but not for the ibuprofen or
      placebo groups. Analysis of variance showed a significant drug effect for
      diazepam but not for ibuprofen, indicating that pain relief was attributable to
      diazepam. No significant changes were noted in muscle tenderness, interincisal
      opening, or plasma beta-endorphin level. This study supports the efficacy of
      diazepam in the short-term management of chronic orofacial muscle pain. The lack 
      of effect following administration of an anti-inflammatory analgesic suggests
      that inflammation is not the basis for chronic muscle pain in the orofacial
      region, and that the analgesic effect of such medications is not sufficient for
      pain relief in this condition.

TI  - Effectiveness of gabapentin in controlling spasticity: a quantitative study.
PG  - 171-5
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to study the effectiveness of gabapentin in
      controlling spasticity in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) using a surface
      EMG-based quantitative assessment technique called the brain motor control
      assessment (BMCA). Six men from a Veterans Affairs Medical Center with spasticity
      due to traumatic SCI were studied as part of a multi-center, placebo-controlled, 
      cross-over, clinical trial of gabapentin. Spasticity was evaluated using
      multi-channel surface EMG recordings of muscles in the lower extremities, abdomen
      and low back before and during treatment with oral gabapentin or placebo.
      Gabapentin or placebo was given orally in doses 400 mg three times daily for 48
      h. Following a 10 day wash-out period subjects were crossed-over to receive the
      medication not received the first time. This was followed by an elective
      open-label extension. Group results during the controlled trial did not reach
      statistical significance at the dosage used. One subject demonstrated a dramatic 
      improvement in spasticity that was apparent both clinically and with the BMCA.
      Other subjects demonstrated modest improvements which were seen in the BMCA but
      not recognized clinically. During the open label extension, the four subjects who
      participated experienced important clinical improvements with higher doses (to
      3600 mg/day). These improvements were often in components of spasticity in which 
      the BMCA had detected subclinical changes during the cross-over trial. A seventh 
      subject was studied using the BMCA at doses of 1200 mg T.I.D. gabapentin, off
      gabapentin and 800 mg T.I.D. gabapentin and demonstrated quantitatively a
      dose-related effect with higher doses of gabapentin which matched clinical
      observations. Gabapentin at doses of 400 mg T.I.D. may be effective in
      controlling some features of spasticity in persons with SCI. Higher doses provide
      greater control of spasticity, and controlled studies using higher doses are
      needed to evaluate gabapentin's efficacy.

TI  - Randomised controlled trial of hydroquinine in muscle cramps.
PG  - 528-32
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although quinine and hydroquinine are commonly prescribed for muscle 
      cramps, controlled clinical trials of these drugs have reported mixed findings
      about efficacy. We investigated hydroquinine therapy in otherwise healthy adults 
      who had frequent, ordinary muscle cramps. METHODS: This randomised, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial consisted of three consecutive 2-week
      periods: qualification, treatment, and washout, 68 women and 44 men who had at
      least three muscle cramps per week were enrolled. During the treatment period,
      participants were randomly assigned 300 mg daily dose of hydroquinine
      hydrobromide dihydrate (54 participants) or placebo (58). The frequency, severity
      (1-10), duration, and location of muscle cramps, as well as any side-effects,
      were recorded by participant in daily diaries. The primary outcome measures were 
      the number of muscle cramps and the number of days during which the participants 
      had muscle cramps (cramp-days). FINDINGS: We excluded five participants from both
      groups from the analysis. Thus, data from 49 hydroquinine-group participants and 
      53 placebo-group participants were analysed. In both groups the total number of
      muscle cramps and the number of cramp-days decreased during the treatment period 
      compared with the qualification period. However, these improvements were greater 
      in the hydroquinine group than in the placebo group. The hydroquinine-group
      participants reported a median of 8 (95% CI 7-12) fewer cramps and median of 3
      (1-4) fewer cramp-days, whereas those on placebo reported only 3 (0-5) fewer
      cramps and 1 (0-5) fewer cramp-days. 32 (65%) of participants in the hydroquinine
      group had a 50% or greater reduction in the number of muscle cramps. After the
      onset of cramps, hydroquinine did not reduce the severity or duration of cramps. 
      We also found a sustained effect after treatment had stopped. Hydroquinine was
      well tolerated, and resulted in only mild side-effects. INTERPRETATION: In our
      study, 300 mg hydroquinine was safe to take in the short-term and significantly
      more effective than placebo in the prevention of frequent, ordinary muscle
      cramps. This therapeutic effect outlasted the duration of treatment.

TI  - Alpha 2-agonist versus alpha 1-antagonist in mild-to-moderate hypertension:
      comparison of transdermal clonidine and terazosin monotherapies.
PG  - 9-15
AB  - A double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group trial that used a predominantly
      Hispanic patient population with mild-to-moderate hypertension was designed to
      compare the efficacy, safety, and acceptability of monotherapy with either
      transdermal clonidine applied once a week or terazosin tablets taken once a day. 
      Of 44 patients admitted, 20 of 22 in the transdermal clonidine group and 15 of 21
      in the terazosin group (one patient was lost to follow-up) met the response
      criteria. These criteria included the completion of 1 full week of therapy with
      the smallest dose that resulted in a seated diastolic blood pressure of <90 mm Hg
      and the subsequent entrance into an 8-week maintenance therapy phase. At the end 
      of the 8-week maintenance phase the mean seated diastolic blood pressure remained
      <90 mm Hg in the clonidine cohort but not in the terazosin cohort, yet the
      difference was not statistically significant. There was a significantly better
      response to clonidine when all patients who received treatment were considered.
      No adverse first-dose effects were experienced with terazosin. One patient who
      received transdermal clonidine developed contact dermatitis and withdrew from the
      study prematurely. The most common side effects associated with clonidine were
      dry mouth and fatigue while those associated with terazosin were headache and
      fatigue. Compliance was excellent in both groups. Seventy-nine percent of
      patients found transdermal clonidine preferable to the oral regimen.

      Design, methods and clinical findings.
PG  - 11-23
AB  - This report describes the design, methods and clinical results of a prospective
      sequential multinational (5 countries) study conducted to evaluate the effects of
      subcutaneous sumatriptan on health-related quality of life, workplace
      productivity, clinical parameters and patient satisfaction. Adult patients with
      moderate to severe migraine initially received customary therapy for migraine
      episodes for 12 weeks, followed by 24 weeks' treatment with self-administered
      subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg. Demographic, baseline, health-related quality of
      life and patient satisfaction rating data were collected during visits to the
      clinic. Data relating to migraine symptoms, migraine therapy, work productivity
      and non-work activity time were collected on diary cards filled out by the
      patients. 749 patients were recruited to the study and 637 received at least 1
      dose of sumatriptan. Overall, 75.5% of migraines were successfully treated within
      2 hours with sumatriptan compared with 31.9% with customary therapy; 36% of
      patients reported complete relief at 2 hours with sumatriptan treatment compared 
      with 1% of patients receiving customary therapy. 69% of patients successfully
      treated 70% of their migraines with sumatriptan within 2 hours, compared with 12%
      of patients with customary therapy. No serious adverse events were reported; 50% 
      of patients reported an adverse event during the 12-week customary therapy phase 
      and 89% of patients during the 24-week sumatriptan phase. These clinical results,
      which are consistent with those reported in randomised blinded studies of
      subcutaneous sumatriptan, suggest that relief of migraine symptoms occurs more
      often, and in less time, in patients receiving subcutaneous sumatriptan rather
      than customary therapy as their primary medication.

TI  - A case of tizanidine-induced hepatic injury.
PG  - 772-3
AB  - The case history is presented of a woman who developed serious liver injury while
      taking 36 mg tizanidine daily. Other causes of hepatic injury were excluded.
      Symptoms resolved after discontinuation of tizanidine, and the liver enzyme
      levels were nearly normal 6 weeks after discontinuation of the drug. Rechallenge 
      with 4 mg tizanidine caused a relapse. The temporal relationship between the
      symptoms and liver enzyme elevations, the absence of other potential causes, and 
      the reaction to rechallenge, strongly implicate tizanidine as the cause of
      hepatic injury. As we are not aware of similar case histories, this seems to be
      the first reported case of tizanidine-induced hepatic injury.

TI  - Outcomes assessment of drug treatment in multiple sclerosis clinical trials.
PG  - 198-210
AB  - The purpose of this review is to evaluate the clinical outcomes of drug therapy
      in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) in those studies which purported to
      include an assessment of quality of life. Pharmacological management of MS is
      primarily directed towards control of symptoms and prevention of disease
      progression or relapse. Although there are many drug and nondrug approaches used 
      in the treatment of MS, this review focuses largely on approaches that
      incorporate some method of clinical outcome assessment. To aid in the
      interpretation of the data presented, a short descriptive summary of these
      assessment methods has been included. Although most studies incorporate at least 
      one clinical outcome measure into the evaluation of efficacy, only one study has 
      examined the economic impact of intervention in MS. The authors of that study
      demonstrated good correlation between the level of disability assessed using
      conventional quality-of-life measures and associated healthcare costs.
      Surprisingly, although many treatment approaches used in MS have significant
      associated toxicity and only modest benefits in terms of disease control, there
      is a remarkable paucity of data on the impact of these treatments on patients'
      quality of life. Studies that incorporate pharmacoeconomic and health-related
      quality-of-life consequences related to the treatment of MS are required.

TI  - Measuring quality of life in patients with depression or anxiety.
PG  - 305-15
AB  - One-fifth of all disability is caused by psychiatric morbidity, with depression
      and anxiety the most common conditions. Despite this, and the wide range of
      pharmaceutical treatments available, few quality-of-life studies have been
      conducted with depressed or anxious patients. Most studies focus on symptoms and 
      adverse effects, rather than on the impact of these on the patient. Where health 
      status is assessed, inappropriate generic measures have been used. Recently, a
      depression-specific measure of quality of life, the Quality of Life in Depression
      Scale, has been developed and is starting to be used in clinical trials. No
      equivalent measure for anxiety is available. Given the range and rapid increase
      in the number of treatments available for depression and anxiety, and issues of
      compliance and individual response to treatment, much more attention must be
      given to quality of life in these conditions.

TI  - Meta-analysis of efficacy of quinine for treatment of nocturnal leg cramps in
      elderly people.
PG  - 13-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess quantitatively the efficacy of quinine (as quinine sulphate)
      compared with placebo in the treatment of nocturnal leg cramps. DESIGN: A
      meta-analysis of six randomised, double blind, crossover trials. SETTING:
      Randomised trials that were available as of April 1994. SUBJECTS: A total of 107 
      general ambulatory patients who suffered from regular nocturnal leg cramps from
      six clinical trials. RESULTS: Data from individual patients were used to
      calculate point estimates and 95% confidence intervals for each of the outcome
      measures reported by these studies. Treatment with quinine resulted in a
      significant reduction in the number of cramps for a four week period compared
      with placebo (8.83 fewer cramps; 95% confidence interval 4.16 to 13.49).
      Treatment with quinine reduced the number of nights with cramps by 27.4% (24.0%
      to 30.8%) compared with placebo. Treatment did not produce a significant change
      in the severity or duration of individual nocturnal leg cramps. Side effects were
      uncommon. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that quinine can prevent nocturnal
      leg cramps in general ambulatory populations. Given the possible serious side
      effects of treatment with quinine, the benefits and risks in patients taking this
      drug should be closely monitored.

TI  - Psychological and emotional effects of the use of oral baclofen: a preliminary
      study.
PG  - 349-53
AB  - Spasticity is a common problem following spinal cord injury. The drug of choice
      to control spasms is baclofen. There would appear to be no reported studies which
      have evaluated the psychological and emotional effect of this drug. This
      preliminary study investigated a number of such effects, including depression,
      anxiety and general mood state. First, we examined 10 subjects before and during 
      the administration of baclofen. They were then compared to a control group of 12 
      subjects. A second cohort of 12 subjects taking baclofen were compared to a
      control group of nine subjects at a specific time after injury. Results indicated
      that whilst some significant differences were found, suggesting an increase in
      fatigue with use of baclofen, no major adverse psychological effects were noted. 
      The implications of these results were discussed and suggestions for further
      research were highlighted.

TI  - Carisoprodol as a drug of abuse.
PG  - 429-32
AB  - Carisoprodol (available as Soma and in other commercial forms) is a commonly
      prescribed muscle relaxant. A small group of patients was recently discovered
      colluding to obtain the drug under false pretenses for the purposes of substance 
      abuse. Animal and human studies have previously shown limited potential for
      tolerance or abuse, while the evidence for therapeutic efficacy is inadequate.
      There are two previous case reports of human carisoprodol abuse or dependence,
      one in which a patient showed signs of a true withdrawal syndrome. A third case
      involved a fatality linked to carisoprodol abuse. Data from the National
      Institute on Drug Abuse reveal that overdose and abuse of carisoprodol may be
      more common than previously suspected. Carisoprodol use should be limited to
      short-term treatment of acute musculoskeletal conditions involving significant
      muscle spasm. Suspicions of abuse should be raised by patients requesting the
      drug by name, "losing" prescriptions, using carisoprodol chronically, or denying 
      the efficacy of less mind-altering alternatives.

TI  - Neuropsychiatric effects of cardiovascular drug therapy.
PG  - 73-93
AB  - Various cardiovascular drugs have been shown to have neuropsychiatric effects
      that can be harmful or therapeutically beneficial to patients. As an example,
      both sedation and mental depression have been described in patients receiving
      centrally acting antihypertensive drugs and beta-adrenergic blockers, related to 
      their antiadrenergic actions. In contrast, because of these antiadrenergic
      actions, agents like clonidine have been used to treat opiate, alcohol, and
      nicotine withdrawal, while beta blockers have been used to treat symptoms of
      performance anxiety, migraine, and psychocardiac disorders. Some antiarrhythmic
      drugs have been associated with delirium, and digitalis toxicity has been shown
      to cause hallucinations, mania, euphoria, and depression. The calcium-channel
      blocker verapamil has been used as an adjunctive treatment in patients with
      bipolar disorders. Since neuropsychiatric symptoms are seen in patients with
      cardiovascular disease, clinicians should be aware of the possible relationship
      between these symptoms and concurrent cardiovascular drug therapy.

TI  - The use of quality of life measures in multiple sclerosis research.
PG  - 63-72
AB  - Quality of life research contributes knowledge essential to the health and
      healthcare of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. This article reviews 83 MS
      studies in English that have presented data on quality of life. The studies may
      be classified into three categories, according to the application and the main
      focus: 1) evaluating the development and validity of quality of life
      questionnaires and clinical scales (n = 27); 2) evaluating factors that might
      influence the quality of life or comparing the quality of life among various
      groups (n = 37); and 3) using quality of life questionnaires as outcome measures 
      in medical trials and other interventions (n = 19). The studies have shown that
      quality of life questionnaires more broadly measure the impact of MS than do the 
      most frequently used measures of disease activity and effects. Using quality of
      life measures provides additional information in evaluating the effects of
      treatment and in studying the development of the disease. Such information is
      crucial in planning interventions for MS patients. A challenge in this field is
      to improve the study designs, including reaching some agreement on how to measure
      the quality of life.

TI  - Rapid onset mitoxantrone-induced cardiotoxicity in secondary progressive multiple
      sclerosis.
PG  - 59-62
AB  - Mitoxantrone is a recently approved drug for patients with secondary progressive 
      multiple sclerosis (SPMS). However, cardiac side effects limit Mitoxantrone use
      in SPMS and its lifetime cumulative dose should not exceed 140 mg/m2.
      Additionally, Mitoxantrone is contraindicated for use in SPMS patients with a
      baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of < or = 50%. The goal of
      this study was to monitor LVEF more frequently than ordinarily recommended since 
      experience with Mitoxantrone use in SPMS patients is limited. An unexpected
      decline in LVEF in one of the SPMS patients being treated with Mitoxantrone
      prompted further investigation into this finding. In our clinic, 47 patients on
      Mitoxantrone were followed prospectively; 28 of 47 patients had received a
      minimum of three doses and underwent a repeat LVEF evaluation prior to their
      fourth dose of Mitoxantrone. Of these 28 patients, five of 28 (17.8%) had a
      significant decline in LVEF from baseline. It is suggested that more stringent
      cardiac monitoring guidelines than current Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      recommendations be used to avert potential cardiac complications in SPMS patients
      on Mitoxantrone.

TI  - Intention tremor during manual aiming: a study of eye and hand movements.
PG  - 44-54
AB  - Accurate goal-directed movements toward a visual target require a precise
      coordination of both the oculomotor and limb motor systems. Intention tremor and 
      eye movement deficits are frequently observed in multiple sclerosis (MS). The
      goal of this study was to examine the characteristics of intention tremor and
      simultaneously produced eye movements during rapid goal-directed movements. Eye
      and hand movements were synchronously measured in 16 MS patients with intention
      tremor and 16 control subjects. Manual performances of the patient group were
      characterized by a delayed onset, slower execution and aiming inaccuracies. In
      line with the clinically defined picture of intention tremor differences between 
      patients and control subjects were most pronounced toward the end of the
      movement. Dependent variables were obviously greater in MS patients compared with
      control subjects, and correlated well with clinical outcome measures. The
      application of an inertial load to the limb did not show any effect on intention 
      tremor. In addition to impaired limb coordination, evidence has been found that
      eye movements, too, were abnormal in patients compared with control subjects.
      Moreover, eye and hand movement deficits seemed to be closely related, suggesting
      a common underlying command structure. Inaccurate eye movements were likely to
      hamper an accurate motor performance of the hand.

TI  - Safety and tolerability of the lidocaine patch 5%, a targeted peripheral
      analgesic: a review of the literature.
PG  - 111-7
AB  - The safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the lidocaine patch 5% (Lidoderm), a
      targeted peripheral analgesic with an FDA-approved indication for the treatment
      of postherpetic neuralgia, has been well established. Recent case reports and
      studies have suggested potential efficacy in other neuropathic and nonneuropathic
      pain conditions. Several pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated minimal
      systemic absorption with 12-, 18-, and 24-hour/day dosing. Mean maximum plasma
      concentrations have shown the lidocaine patch to possess a minimal risk for
      systemic toxicities or drug-drug interactions. The most common adverse events
      generally involve mild skin reactions. There have been no drug-drug interactions 
      noted in clinical trials. Recent evidence suggests that extended application does
      not result in A-beta-mediated sensory loss at the application site, which is
      particularly important in patients who already have a degree of sensory loss due 
      to their underlying condition. The lidocaine patch provides a treatment option
      that carries a relatively low systemic adverse event and drug-drug interaction
      risk burden, even with continuous application of up to four patches per day.

TI  - Topical and peripherally acting analgesics.
PG  - 1-20
AB  - Acute nociceptive, inflammatory, and neuropathic pain all depend to some degree
      on the peripheral activation of primary sensory afferent neurons. The localized
      peripheral administration of drugs, such as by topical application, can
      potentially optimize drug concentrations at the site of origin of the pain, while
      leading to lower systemic levels and fewer adverse systemic effects, fewer drug
      interactions, and no need to titrate doses into a therapeutic range compared with
      systemic administration. Primary sensory afferent neurons can be activated by a
      range of inflammatory mediators such as prostanoids, bradykinin, ATP, histamine, 
      and serotonin, and inhibiting their actions represents a strategy for the
      development of analgesics. Peripheral nerve endings also express a variety of
      inhibitory neuroreceptors such as opioid, alpha-adrenergic, cholinergic,
      adenosine and cannabinoid receptors, and agonists for these receptors also
      represent viable targets for drug development. At present, topical and other
      forms of peripheral administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
      opioids, capsaicin, local anesthetics, and alpha-adrenoceptor agonists are being 
      used in a variety of clinical states. There also are some clinical data on the
      use of topical antidepressants and glutamate receptor antagonists. There are
      preclinical data supporting the potential for development of local formulations
      of adenosine agonists, cannabinoid agonists, cholinergic ligands, cytokine
      antagonists, bradykinin antagonists, ATP antagonists, biogenic amine antagonists,
      neuropeptide antagonists, and agents that alter the availability of nerve growth 
      factor. Given that activation of sensory neurons involves multiple mediators,
      combinations of agents targeting different mechanisms may be particularly useful.
      Topical analgesics represent a promising area for future drug development.

TI  - The effect of noradrenergic drugs on the recovery of walking after spinal cord
      injury.
PG  - 137-43
AB  - Clonidine, a noradrenergic agonist has been associated with improved walking in
      both spinal cat and spinal cord injured (SCI) subjects. OBJECTIVES: The objective
      of this brief review is to compare the effects of clonidine on walking
      capabilities in SCI subjects with functionally complete and incomplete spinal
      cord injuries. STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: Both oral administration and intrathecal
      injection of clonidine were investigated. A motorized treadmill was used and
      harness support provided in most of the SCI subjects as no walking capabilities
      could be observed overground. A single subject design was used in these chronic
      SCI subjects. SETTING: Canada and France. RESULTS: In complete SCI subjects while
      receiving clonidine, none of the subjects was able to initiate independent
      stepping. In contrast, the greatest effects were found in SCI subjects with
      injuries that are incomplete but still severely disabling while minimal effects
      could be observed in the more functional SCI subjects. These effects on walking
      are observed in measures of walking speed, and electromyographic and kinematic
      patterns. Regardless of effects on walking, however, a consistent decrease of the
      flexor reflex amplitude could be observed in all SCI subjects independent of the 
      severity of the lesion. CONCLUSION: This review demonstrated that clonidine could
      be a powerful anti-spasmodic drug in addition to improving locomotion in a
      limited number of SCI subjects. The mechanism, significance and implications of
      these results will be discussed.

TI  - Effect of autogenic training on drug consumption in patients with primary
      headache: an 8-month follow-up study.
PG  - 251-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of Schultz-type autogenic training on
      headache-related drug consumption and headache frequency in patients with
      migraine, tension-type, or mixed (migraine plus tension-type) headache over an
      8-month period. BACKGROUND: Behavioral treatments often are used alone or
      adjunctively for different types of headache. There are, however, only a few
      studies that have compared the efficacy and durability of the same treatment in
      different types of primary headache, and the effects of treatment on
      headache-related drug consumption rarely have been assessed even in these
      studies. METHODS: Twenty-five women with primary headache (11 with mixed
      headache, 8 with migraine, and 6 with tension-type headache) were evaluated via
      an open-label, self-controlled, 8-month, follow-up study design. After an initial
      4 months of observation, patients began learning Schultz-type autogenic training 
      as modified for patients with headache. They practiced autogenic training on a
      regular basis for 4 months. Based on data from headache diaries and daily
      medication records, headache frequencies and the amounts of analgesics,
      "migraine-specific" drugs (ergots and triptans), and anxiolytics taken by the
      patients were compared in the three subgroups over the 8-month period.
      Results.-From the first month of implementation of autogenic training, headache
      frequencies were significantly reduced in patients with tension-type and mixed
      headache. Significant reduction in frequency was achieved in patients with
      migraine only from the third month of autogenic training. Decreases in headache
      frequencies were accompanied by decreases in consumption of migraine drugs and
      analgesics resulting in significant correlations among these parameters.
      Reduction in consumption of anxiolytic drugs was more rapid and robust in
      patients with tension-type headache compared to patients with migraine, and this 
      outcome failed to show any correlation with change in headache frequency.
      CONCLUSION: Schultz-type autogenic training is an effective therapeutic approach 
      that may lead to a reduction in both headache frequency and the use of headache
      medication.

TI  - Migraine preventive medication reduces resource utilization.
PG  - 171-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if long-term resource utilization is reduced by adding a 
      preventive medication to a migraine management regimen that already includes
      acute medication. BACKGROUND: In 2000, new evidence-based guidelines for the
      treatment of migraine were released by the US Headache Consortium and the
      American Academy of Neurology. Although these guidelines emphasize the role of
      preventive medication in achieving significant clinical improvement, little yet
      is known concerning the impact of such management on medical and pharmaceutical
      resources. Methods.-Resource utilization information in a large claims database
      was analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Adding a preventive medication to migraine
      management reduced the use of other migraine medications, as well as visits to
      physician offices and emergency departments. In addition, both acute and
      preventive medications were associated with lower utilization of computed
      tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans. CONCLUSION: Migraine preventive 
      drug therapy is effective in reducing resource consumption when added to therapy 
      consisting only of an acute medication.

TI  - Prolactinomas, dopamine agonists and headache: two case reports.
PG  - 169-73
AB  - Headache is a common problem in patients with pituitary tumours. Small pituitary 
      lesions can cause debilitating headache, suggesting that the size of the
      pituitary tumour may not be the only causal factor in pituitary-related headache.
      We present two cases of prolactinoma-associated headache. The first case has a
      clinical diagnosis of short-lasting unilateral headache attacks with conjunctival
      injection and tearing (SUNCT). The second case has a clinical diagnosis of
      hemicrania continua and idiopathic stabbing headache. In each case, the
      administration of dopamine agonists has led to an exacerbation of symptoms. We
      review the relevant literature to understand the pathophysiological implications 
      of these cases.

TI  - Complex regional pain syndrome--diagnostic, mechanisms, CNS involvement and
      therapy.
PG  - 61-75
AB  - Complex regional pain syndromes (CRPS, formerly reflex sympathetic dystrophy and 
      causalgia) are neuropathic pain conditions of one extremity developing
      inadequately after a trauma. The initiating trauma affects primarily the
      extremity, but can also be a central lesion (e.g., spinal cord injury, stroke).
      CRPS is clinically characterized by sensory, autonomic and motor disturbances.
      Pathophysiologically there is evidence for functional changes within the central 
      nervous system and for involvement of peripheral inflammatory processes. The
      sympathetic nervous system plays a key role in maintaining pain and autonomic
      dysfunction in the affected extremity. After a primary central lesion, secondary 
      peripheral changes in the paretic extremity are suggested to be important in
      initiating a CRPS. Though there is no diagnostic gold standard, careful clinical 
      evaluation and additional test procedures should lead to an adequate diagnosis.
      An early diagnosis and an interdisciplinary approach are important for optimal
      and successful treatment.

TI  - Pain and rehabilitation after spinal cord injury: the case of sensory spasticity?
PG  - 250-6
AB  - Sixty percent of patients with posttraumatic para- or tetraplegia suffer from
      severe, continuous burning and/or lancinating pain. Multiple sclerosis produces
      pain in more than 30%. This pain can be as important as the absent mobility or
      sexual function as a cause of lowered quality of life. Two unique types of
      longstanding neuropathic pain can be recognized in persons with spinal cord
      injury: (1). segmentally distributed pain at the lesion; and (2). pain in the
      body below the lesion, often with late onset. The first type could be produced by
      nerve root entrapment or by direct segmental deafferentation. The second type
      probably contains several forms of central pain, evoked either by the original
      spinal lesion, by an expanding syrinx in the spinal cord or by secondary changes 
      at higher levels of the somatosensory systems. Patients with central pain almost 
      always have stimulus-independent pain. Its intensity may vary independently, be
      related to the presence of visceral activity/inflammation or be constant. In
      addition, stimulus-dependent pain is sometimes present, usually because skin
      areas or viscera below the lesion are allodynic. Partial spinal lesions,
      especially centrally in the cervical spinal cord, may be more prone to produce
      pain than are complete lesions. There is limited analgesic effectiveness in
      controlled studies of serotonin reuptake inhibitors, of sodium channel blockers
      (lidocaine, tetracaine), of the GABA receptor agonist baclofen (one study) and of
      the NMDA-receptor antagonist ketamine (one study). There are anecdotal reports on
      oral carbamazepine, on gabapentin, on intrathecal opiates and also on the
      alpha(2)-agonist clonidine, being effective in central neuropathic pain.
      Neurostimulation is effective only if it evokes paraesthesia in the painful area;
      hence TENS may give relief of segmental pain. Neurodestructive procedures and
      central neurostimulation have been largely unsuccessful. As in other longstanding
      pain, improved coping through cognitive-behavioural rehabilitation may be helpful
      for the clinical outcome.

TI  - Spinal interneurones; how can studies in animals contribute to the understanding 
      of spinal interneuronal systems in man?
PG  - 19-28
AB  - The first part of this review deals with arguments that the essential properties 
      and organization of spinal interneuronal systems in the cat and in man are
      similar. The second part is concerned with the possibility that some
      interneuronal systems may be responsible for motor disturbances caused by spinal 
      cord injuries and that these interneurones may be defined. This possibility is
      discussed with respect to the hyperexcitability of alpha-motoneurones and the
      exaggeration of stretch reflexes in spastic patients. To this end, what is known 
      about cat spinal interneurones and about the neuronal basis and pharmacological
      treatment of spasticity, is put together. Interneurones in di- and trisynaptic
      reflex pathways from group II muscle afferents are singled out, since they are
      depressed by the alpha(2) noradrenaline receptor agonists clonidine and
      tizanidine, which is a critical feature of interneurones expected to contribute
      to exaggerated stretch reflexes which are reduced by alpha(2) noradrenaline
      receptor agonists. Recent observations that reflex excitation of extensor
      motoneurones from group II afferents is enhanced in spastic patients and that the
      pathologically strong reflex actions of group II afferents are reduced by
      clonidine and tizanidine support this proposal. On the other hand, a lack of
      effect of clonidine and tizanidine upon other types of excitatory or inhibitory
      interneurones argues against any major contribution of such interneurones to the 
      abnormally strong responses of alpha-motoneurones to muscle stretch.

TI  - Newer GABAergic agents for pharmacotherapy of infantile spasms.
PG  - 657-75
AB  - Infantile spasms is an age-specific epileptic syndrome in infants and young
      children. Although the exact mechanism is unknown, adrenocorticotrophic hormone
      (ACTH) has been the mainstay for the therapeutic management of infantile spasms
      and other developmental epilepsies. Clinical benefits of ACTH in infantile spasms
      could partially relate to its stimulatory effects on the release of
      adrenocorticosteroids and neurosteroids. Glucocorticoids, pyridoxine and
      ketogenic diet therapy have all been used for the treatment of refractory
      infantile spasms. Recent studies indicate that several newer anticonvulsant
      agents, which are positive allosteric modulators of GABA(A) receptors, are as
      effective as ACTH in acutely controlling infantile spasms. The efficacy of agents
      that enhance GABA-mediated inhibition (such as vigabatrin and benzodiazepines)
      for rapid and complete abolition of infantile spasms has been demonstrated in
      several clinical studies. Ganaxolone, a novel neuroactive steroid has, however,
      demonstrated outstanding efficacy and better tolerability in children with
      intractable infantile spasms. Zonisamide, topiramate, deoxycorticosterone and
      neurosteroids are emerging as effective treatment approaches. These new
      antiepileptic drugs represent a potential nonhormonal approach for infantile
      spasms, but additional studies are needed to verify their efficacy and
      tolerability. Future studies will hopefully identify rational antiseizure drugs
      that not only control infantile spasms but also abrogate its risk on the
      development of the brain.

TI  - Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, Glivec): a new therapy for chronic myeloid leukemia
      and other malignancies.
PG  - 601-13
AB  - Imatinib mesylate (STI571, Gleevec, Glivec, a selective inhibitor of the BCR-ABL 
      tyrosine kinase causative of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), represents the
      paradigm of how a better understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms of a
      neoplastic disease can lead to the development of a targeted molecular therapy.
      Phase II clinical trials have shown marked therapeutic activity of imatinib in
      all evolutive phases of CML, but notably in the chronic phase, where it induces
      complete hematological responses in almost 100% of patients resistant or
      intolerant to interferon, with a major cytogenetic response rate of 60%,
      including 41% complete cytogenetic responses. The preliminary results of an
      ongoing phase III multicenter randomized study comparing imatinib with interferon
      plus cytarabine as first-line treatment for CML favor imatinib in terms of
      efficacy and safety. If confirmed with longer follow-up,these results would
      establish imatinib as the choice therapy for the majority of CML patients, with
      allogeneic transplantation being restricted as initial therapy only to younger
      patients with a family donor. Longer follow-up will answer some questions, such
      as those on long-term safety, durability of the responses, whether these will
      translate into a survival prolongation and the possibility of molecular
      responses. In addition, further information on the mechanisms involved in the
      primary and acquired resistance to imatinib is needed. Besides the Bcr-Abl
      protein, the drug is also active against other tyrosine kinases, such as Abl, the
      stem-cell factor receptor (c-kit) and the platelet-derived growth factor
      receptor, whose inhibition might have potential implications for the treatment of
      several malignancies. In this sense, it must be pointed out that imatinib has
      shown a remarkable activity in gastrointestinal stromal tumors.

TI  - The pathogenesis and management of painful diabetic neuropathy: a review.
PG  - 88-98
AB  - Painful diabetic neuropathy has always been a challenging complication of
      diabetes mellitus. Emerging theories suggest that early dysaesthesia associated
      with painful neuropathy may act as a marker for the development of the 'at risk' 
      foot, allowing preventative clinical strategies to be undertaken. The mechanisms 
      of neuropathic pain are complex. The authors' intentions are to help members of
      the diabetes care team better understand and appreciate the diverse symptoms
      reported by patients. The various treatments available for painful neuropathy are
      discussed in detail. Robust comparative studies on such treatments are, however, 
      unavailable and the authors have designed a logical approach to management based 
      on best current evidence and their own clinical experience.

TI  - Talampanel, a new antiepileptic drug: single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics 
      and initial 1-week experience in patients with chronic intractable epilepsy.
PG  - 46-53
AB  - PURPOSE: Talampanel (LY300164), a potent and selective
      alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA)-receptor antagonist, 
      is a potential new antiepileptic drug (AED). This study examines the single- and 
      multiple-dose pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of talampanel in
      patients with intractable epilepsy and assesses the potential for pharmacokinetic
      interaction. METHODS: Eleven of 14 patients entered into the study completed.
      Fourteen patients were evaluated for safety, 13 patients were used in the
      single-dose, and 11 patients in the multiple-dose pharmacokinetic analysis. Each 
      patient initially received a single 35-mg dose of talampanel followed by the
      measurement of pharmacokinetic profiles. A 21-day t.i.d. dosing regimen was then 
      determined for each patient based on his or her initial pharmacokinetic profile. 
      Adverse events were recorded by patients or their carers. RESULTS: After oral
      ingestion, talampanel was rapidly absorbed, with maximal plasma concentrations
      achieved within 1-3 h. Talampanel concentrations in patients taking
      enzyme-inducing AEDs were 50% lower than those seen in healthy volunteers. Mean
      talampanel t1/2 values were 3.0 h compared with 4.2 h in healthy volunteers.
      After multiple-dose and steady-state, talampanel t1/2 values were increased to
      5.6 h Talampanel and valproic acid (VPA) appear to inhibit each other's
      metabolism mutually. Talampanel had no effect on plasma concentrations of other
      AEDs. Multiple-dose talampanel administration was associated with nonlinear
      pharmacokinetics. No serious adverse events were reported; the most frequently
      reported being dizziness, ataxia, drowsiness, and headaches CONCLUSIONS:
      Talampanel dosing strategies may be reliant on concomitant AED medication, as
      enzyme-inducing AEDs enhance, whereas VPA inhibits its metabolism. Talampanel was
      well tolerated, although adverse events occurred at lower doses compared with
      those in healthy subjects, probably because of the additive effect of concomitant
      AEDs.

TI  - Tetanus.
PG  - 398-407
AB  - Tetanus is a potentially life threatening disease affecting nearly 50,000 to 1
      million people world wide every year. Four major clinical forms of tetanus are
      described i.e. generalized, cephalic, localized and neonatal. Neonatal tetanus is
      particularly common in developing countries, due to unhygienic child birth
      practices, social taboos and improper immunization of pregnant mothers.
      Management of this disorder involves a team approach and aims at eradicating
      focus of infection, neutralizing the toxin, controlling spasms and dysautonomia
      and providing adequate ventilatory and supportive care. Metronidazole may be the 
      preferred antibiotic although penicillin is still used frequently. Adequate wound
      debridement is necessary to prevent spore germination. Spasms are usually managed
      by sedatives like diazepam and neuromuscular blocking agents. Magnesium sulphate 
      is an attractive substitute and may be tried if ventilatory facilities are
      unavailable. Use of baclofen is potentially advantageous but cannot be routinely 
      prescribed. Dysautonomia is difficult to manage and requires therapy with
      benzodiazepines, morphine, magnesium sulphate, adrenergic blockers and recently
      tried baclofen therapy. Supportive care including ventilatory assistance are
      highly essential for successful outcome of the patients. It is imperative that
      complications are diagnosed early and managed appropriately. Immunization is
      extremely effective and is the key to prevention. Adequate steps and measures
      should be taken to increase awareness of this potentially preventable disease.

TI  - Surgery in the patient with neurologic disease.
PG  - 257-71
AB  - Patients with neurologic disease who require surgery present distinct issues and 
      challenges for the medical consultant. Although it is not possible to offer a
      unified approach to neurologic patients, the primary care consultant should
      understand the clinical issues that are common to these patients, and the
      individual considerations necessitated by the nature of the neurologic disorder
      and the clinical characteristics of the patient. The preoperative evaluation
      combines elements of literature evidence on risk assessment with a thorough
      understanding of the planned procedure and local practice patterns, and clinical 
      judgment as to the estimated risk-benefit ratio. Perioperative management
      necessitates attention to many general principles of perioperative care, such as 
      awareness of the potential for cardiopulmonary complications and the need for DVT
      prophylaxis. In addition, there are management issues for neurologic patients,
      such as blood pressure control and evaluation of hyponatremia, which may differ
      from other surgical patients. In these circumstances, the interaction of the
      neurologic condition with the medical condition and the implications of treatment
      on the underlying neurologic process also need to be considered.

TI  - The role of surgical placement and pump orientation in intrathecal pump system
      failure: a technical report.
PG  - 107-9
AB  - Intrathecal pump catheter complications are the most common cause of failure in
      drug delivery. A previous report has documented that intra-abdominal positioning 
      of the intrathecal pump may predispose the pump-catheter neck to premature
      catheter breakdown and leakage. Based on this report, we reviewed over 100
      intrathecal pump cases to determine the frequency of malpositioning and its role 
      in the pathogenesis of catheter failure. We found three specific cases where a
      'fulcrum effect' occurred due to intra-abdominal positioning of the pump
      predisposing the catheter to breakdown. This study demonstrates that
      intra-abdominal placement of the pump can predispose the catheter to
      failure/breakdown and that surgeons should attempt to place the pump catheter
      neck in a superiomedial position, distant from any bony prominences, to prevent
      the 'fulcrum effect' on the pump-catheter neck junction and reducing the
      likelihood of either internal or external compressive forces.

TI  - Review of esomeprazole in the treatment of acid disorders.
PG  - 253-64
AB  - Esomeprazole (Nexium, AstraZeneca) is the (S)-isomer of omeprazole and the first 
      proton pump inhibitor to be developed as an optical isomer. Esomeprazole has an
      improved pharmacokinetic profile, resulting in increased systemic exposure and
      less interindividual variability compared with omeprazole, and more effective
      suppression of gastric acid production compared with other proton pump
      inhibitors. In several large, double-blind, randomised trials, significantly
      higher rates of endoscopically-confirmed healing of erosive oesophagitis and
      resolution of heartburn have been achieved in patients with gastro-oesophageal
      reflux disease receiving 8 weeks of esomeprazole 40 mg o.d. compared with those
      receiving omeprazole 20 mg o.d. or lansoprazole 30 mg o.d. In the maintenance of 
      healed erosive oesophagitis, esomeprazole 10, 20 or 40 mg o.d. was significantly 
      more effective than placebo in two 6-month, randomised, double-blind trials.
      Additionally, esomeprazole 20 mg o.d. was more effective than lansoprazole 15 mg 
      in the maintenance of healed erosive oesophagitis in another 6-month, randomised,
      double-blind trial. Healing of oesophagitis was also effectively maintained by
      esomeprazole 40 mg o.d. in a 12-month non-comparative trial. Esomeprazole 20 or
      40 mg o.d. effectively relieved heartburn in patients with gastro-oesophageal
      reflux disease without oesophagitis in two 4-week, placebo-controlled trials.
      Clinical trials have shown that triple therapy with esomeprazole 40 mg o.d. in
      combination with amoxicillin and clarithromycin produced Helicobacter pylori
      eradication rates similar to those obtained using triple therapy involving
      twice-daily dosing with other proton pump inhibitors. Esomeprazole is
      well-tolerated, with a spectrum and incidence of adverse events similar to those 
      associated with omeprazole.

TI  - Review of lamotrigine and its clinical applications in epilepsy.
PG  - 243-51
AB  - Lamotrigine is an anti-epileptic agent with broad efficacy. Lamotrigine works at 
      voltage-sensitive sodium channels, thereby stabilising the neuronal membrane and 
      inhibiting the release of excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate and
      aspartate. Early preclinical animal studies indicate its broad-spectrum efficacy,
      which was later confirmed in clinical trials. Multiple randomised,
      placebo-controlled and comparative trials demonstrate its efficacy against
      partial and secondarily generalised seizures. Open-label trials show its efficacy
      against generalised seizures, especially absence seizures of childhood absence
      epilepsy and generalised seizures of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Lamotrigine has
      a wide clinical dose range and possesses favourable pharmacokinetic properties.
      It has a good tolerability and safety profile, which enhance compliance. Its
      small risk of serious skin rash should be weighed against its potential benefits 
      when choosing lamotrigine on an individual basis. Lamotrigine is an excellent
      therapeutic option in epilepsy.

TI  - Seizure disorders in the elderly.
PG  - 325-32
AB  - Seizure disorders become increasingly common after the age of 60 years and can
      have a significant impact on functional status. The goal of antiepileptic drug
      therapy is to control seizures but preserve quality of life. If possible, seizure
      control should be achieved with one agent given in the lowest effective dosage.
      Clinical response, rather than drug levels, should guide dosage changes. All
      antiepileptic drugs can cause dose-dependent sedation and cognitive impairment.
      Although the newer agents may have theoretical advantages over standard
      antiepileptic agents, higher cost may limit their use. Drugs for first-line
      monotherapy of seizures in elderly patients include carbamazepine, valproic acid,
      oxcarbazepine, gabapentin, and lamotrigine.

TI  - Diagnostic cholangiopancreatography.
PG  - 145-55
AB  - As in recent years, the articles on diagnostic endoscopic retrograde
      cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) published between July 2001 and June 2002 again
      reflect a defensive attitude and are mainly concerned with magnetic resonance
      cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and the complications associated with the new
      imaging method. Diagnostic ERCP is declining in importance and has held its
      position mainly due to new advances in tissue sampling, pressure measurement, and
      the use of echo probes and miniature endoscopes. Problems of training in ERCP
      have still not yet been resolved, due to the contradictions inherent in low case

TI  - [Serotonin syndrome--several cases of this often overlooked diagnosis].
PG  - 1660-3
AB  - During the recent decade an increasing number of inquiries concerning cases of
      overdoses exhibiting typical signs of the serotonin syndrome have been recorded
      at the Swedish Poisons Information Centre. Four of these cases are presented
      together with a review of the literature. All patients had overdosed moclobemide 
      and in one case this was the only drug taken. The other patients had ingested
      moclobemide together with citalopram (2 cases) and clomipramine (1 case).
      Moreover, other serotoninergic pharmaceuticals as sertraline and sumatriptan were
      simultaneously ingested in one case and buspirone in another. Three of the cases 
      had hyperthermia, > 40 degrees C and the same number showed pronounced muscle
      rigidity, coma and mydriasis. Other severe signs and symptoms upon admission
      included positive Babinski and trismus in two cases each and seizures in one. All
      patients received mechanical ventilation. Two were treated with dantrolene sodium
      and one of them was given cyproheptadine as well. One patient received
      cyproheptadine treatment alone and another prolonged muscle relaxation. Three
      patients had a typical short clinical course, whereas one patient developed
      rhabdomyolysis, DIC and arrhythmias. All patients fully recovered.

TI  - Practice parameter: treatment of the child with a first unprovoked seizure:
      Report of the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology
      and the Practice Committee of the Child Neurology Society.
PG  - 166-75
AB  - The Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the
      Practice Committee of the Child Neurology Society develop practice parameters as 
      strategies for patient management based on analysis of evidence regarding risks
      and benefits. This parameter reviews published literature relevant to the
      decision to begin treatment after a child or adolescent experiences a first
      unprovoked seizure and presents evidence-based practice recommendations. Reasons 
      why treatment may be considered are discussed. Evidence is reviewed concerning
      risk of recurrence as well as effect of treatment on prevention of recurrence and
      development of chronic epilepsy. Studies of side effects of anticonvulsants
      commonly used to treat seizures in children are also reviewed. Relevant articles 
      are classified according to the Quality Standards Subcommittee classification
      scheme. Treatment after a first unprovoked seizure appears to decrease the risk
      of a second seizure, but there are few data from studies involving only children.
      There appears to be no benefit of treatment with regard to the prognosis for
      long-term seizure remission. Antiepileptic drugs (AED) carry risks of side
      effects that are particularly important in children. The decision as to whether
      or not to treat children and adolescents who have experienced a first unprovoked 
      seizure must be based on a risk-benefit assessment that weighs the risk of having
      another seizure against the risk of chronic AED therapy. The decision should be
      individualized and take into account both medical issues and patient and family
      preference.

TI  - Prevalence of reduced bone mass in children and adults with spastic quadriplegia.
PG  - 12-6
AB  - This study was designed to test the hypothesis that non-ambulatory patients with 
      spastic quadriplegia will have reduced bone mass which worsens with increasing
      age. Forty-eight patients (age 5 to 48 years, median age 15 years; 19 females and
      29 males) were studied. Anticonvulsants were used in 29 patients (60.4%). Lumbar 
      spine bone mineral density (LS-BMD) was markedly reduced compared with age-and
      sex-matched control individuals with a z score of -2.37 +/- 0.21. Twenty-eight
      (58%) had z scores of less than -2. A history of documented previous fracture was
      present in 19 patients (39%). Patients with a history of fracture had
      significantly lower (p = 0.05) LS-BMD z scores (-2.81 +/- 0.29) compared with
      those without a history of fracture (-2.11 +/- 0.26). Mean serum 25-OH vitamin D 
      was 29.6 +/- 1.9ng/mL (normal 9 to 37.6ng/mL) with three patients having serum
      25-OH vitamin D levels less than 15ng/mL. These findings indicate that BMD is
      markedly reduced in non-ambulatory children and adults with neuromuscular
      disease. Reductions in bone mass put them at greater risk for non-traumatic
      fractures.

TI  - Explicit, evidence-based criteria to assess the quality of prescribing to elderly
      nursing home residents.
PG  - 102-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: prescribing in nursing homes is frequently suboptimal. Indicators to 
      measure prescribing quality, including appropriateness of prescribing certain
      drugs or combinations of drugs, to hospital inpatients have been developed
      previously. OBJECTIVE: to modify prescribing indicators, including
      appropriateness of prescribing algorithms developed in the hospital setting, for 
      use in nursing homes. DESIGN: an audit of prescribing to patients resident in a
      random sample of nursing homes on a single day. Setting, subjects: 22 nursing
      homes in the former South Thames Region selected from lists of nursing homes with
      more than 35 residents. All residents aged 65 years or over were eligible.
      METHODS: prescribing indicators, including evidence-based indicators of
      appropriateness of prescribing benzodiazepines, steroids with beta(2) agonists,
      antithrombotics with digoxin and aspirin with nitrates were adapted: to reflect
      where prophylaxis was not justified in terms of quality of life; and for use with
      primary care clinical records. Indicators were used to evaluate drugs prescribed 
      to each resident to determine whether prescribing was appropriate. RESULTS: 13
      indicators were successfully modified and applied. The 934 residents included
      were prescribed a mean of 5.1 regular items. Only 496/934 (55%) drug sensitivity 
      statements were completed. Although 24% residents received benzodiazepines,
      clinical data indicated that only 7% received benzodiazepines appropriately. Over
      three-quarters of residents with ischaemic heart disease received appropriate
      aspirin therapy, but fewer than half residents with atrial fibrillation received 
      appropriate antithrombotic therapy. It was not possible to derive reference
      ranges of observed prescribing that included homes demonstrating appropriate
      prescribing whilst excluding those with inappropriate prescribing. Intra-cluster 
      correlations ranged from 0.027 to 0.335. CONCLUSION: quality of prescribing
      indicators were successfully modified for the nursing home setting. Application
      identified suboptimal prescribing to nursing home residents.

TI  - Continuous infusion of midazolam in the treatment of refractory generalized
      convulsive status epilepticus.
PG  - 177-82
AB  - We studied the efficacy and safety of midazolam given as a continuous infusion in
      the treatment of refractory generalized convulsive status epilepticus (RGCSE). We
      carried out a prospective, open study, in 19 patients (11 men) with RGCSE in the 
      intensive care unit at Firat Medical Center in Elazig. When intravenous
      administration of 0.3 mg/kg diazepam (three times at 5-min intervals), 20 mg/kg
      phenytoin, and 20 mg/kg phenobarbital failed to bring the episode under control, 
      patients were administered an intravenous bolus of midazolam (200 microg/kg)
      followed by a continuous infusion at 1 microg/kg min. The dose was increased by 1
      microg/kg min every 15 min until the episode of seizure was brought under
      control. The time from beginning of treatment to control of seizures, infusion
      rate, and side-effects were monitored. The mean age of the patients was 40.4
      years (range 16-87 years). The clinical etiology of RGCSE was idiopathic epilepsy
      (6 cases), anoxicischemic cerebral insult due to cardiac arrest (3), viral
      encephalitis (2), intrahemispheric hematoma due to hemorrhagic stroke (1),
      cerebral infarct due to ischemic stroke (1), pituitary adenoma (1),
      post-traumatic epilepsy (1), renal failure (1), tuberculous meningitis (1), and
      unknown (2). In eighteen (94.7%) patients, seizures were completely controlled in
      a mean time of 45 min (range, 5-120 min) at a mean infusion rate of 8 microg/kg
      min (range, 3-21 microg/kg min). In one patient seizures did not stop. Midazolam 
      administration did not cause any significant change in blood pressure, heart
      rate, oxygen saturation, or respiratory status. The mean time to full
      consciousness for patients after stopping the infusion was 1.6 hours (range,
      2.0-8.5 hours). The mean infusion duration of midazolam was 14.5 hours (range,
      12-25 hours). Midazolam is an effective and safe drug to control RGCSE, and may
      represent a substantial improvement over current therapeutic approaches such as
      pentobarbital anesthesia.

TI  - Neuro-inflammation as a therapeutic target in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
PG  - 1720-4
AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressive neuromuscular
      disease that destroys both upper and lower motor neurons, resulting in
      spasticity, diffuse muscular atrophy, weakness, and ultimately death from
      respiratory failure. It is presumed that in the vast majority of cases, ALS is
      acquired and occurs sporadically, although the exact etiology is unknown. Recent,
      emerging evidence suggests that neuro-inflammation may be a pathological
      characteristic of this disease; this could represent a potential therapeutic
      target for a pharmacological agent to help treat this severe disease. This
      article reviews the current research in this area and discusses theoretical and
      clinical ramifications of these recent findings.

TI  - Diazepam as an adjuvant analgesic to morphine for pain due to skeletal muscle
      spasm.
PG  - 66-9
AB  - Side effects of morphine are common when it is given in titrated doses to control
      severe pain in advanced cancer. We describe a case of severe back pain resistant 
      to parenteral morphine accompanied by muscle spasm, in which the addition of
      diazepam both had an opioid-sparing effect and provided superior symptomatic
      relief. Diazepam appears to have a specific role as an adjuvant analgesic for
      pain due to skeletal muscle spasm associated with painful vertebral metastases.

TI  - Measuring the impact of MS on walking ability: the 12-Item MS Walking Scale
      (MSWS-12).
PG  - 31-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a patient-based measure of walking ability in MS. METHODS: 
      Twelve items describing the impact of MS on walking (12-Item MS Walking Scale
      [MSWS-12]) were generated from 30 patient interviews, expert opinion, and
      literature review. Preliminary psychometric evaluation (data quality, scaling
      assumptions, acceptability, reliability, validity) was undertaken in the data
      generated by 602 people from the MS Society membership database. Further
      psychometric evaluation (including comprehensive validity assessment,
      responsiveness, and relative efficiency) was conducted in two hospital-based
      samples: people with primary progressive MS (PPMS; n = 78) and people with
      relapses admitted for IV steroid treatment (n = 54). RESULTS: In all samples,
      missing data were low (< or =3.8%), item test-retest reproducibility was high (> 
      or =0.78), scaling assumptions were satisfied, and reliability was high (> or
      =0.94). Correlations between the MSWS-12 and other scales were consistent with a 
      priori hypotheses. The MSWS-12 (relative efficiency = 1.0) was more responsive
      than the Functional Assessment of Multiple Sclerosis mobility scale (0.72), the
      36-Item Short Form Health Survey physical functioning scale (0.33), the Expanded 
      Disability Status Scale (0.03), the 25-ft Timed Walk Test (0.44), and Guy's
      Neurologic Disability Scale lower limb disability item (0.10). CONCLUSIONS: The
      MSWS-12 satisfies standard criteria as a reliable and valid patient-based measure
      of the impact of MS on walking. In these samples, the MSWS-12 was more responsive
      than other walking-based scales.

TI  - An open study of olanzapine and fluoxetine for psychotic major depressive
      disorder: interim analyses.
PG  - 1164-70
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although atypical antipsychotic agents are commonly used in the
      treatment of psychotic depression, there are no published prospective studies on 
      their use in this condition. The aim of this study was to assess, by interim
      analyses, the efficacy of the atypical antipsychotic agent olanzapine in
      combination with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant agent 
      fluoxetine. METHOD: We enrolled 27 patients (17 women [63.0%] and 10 men [37.0%];
      mean +/- SD age: 41.2 +/- 14.7 years) with DSM-IV-defined major depressive
      disorder with psychotic features into an open trial of olanzapine, 5 to 20
      mg/day, plus fluoxetine, 20 to 80 mg/day. Patients were assessed at each visit
      with the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and both the psychotic and 
      mood modules of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders,
      Patient Edition. We are reporting the results of the first 6 weeks of treatment. 
      RESULTS: Twenty-two (81.5%) of the 27 enrolled patients completed the 6-week open
      trial, and 5 (18.5%) dropped out, with only 2 (7.4%) dropping out due to side
      effects. Of the 27 patients, 74.1% (N = 20) met criteria for melancholic
      features, 14.8% (N = 4) had delusions alone, 18.5% (N = 5) had hallucinations
      alone, and 66.7% (N = 18) reported both delusions and hallucinations. In
      addition, the overall rates of response for the intent-to-treat group were as
      follows: depression response rate, 66.7% (N = 18); psychosis response rate, 59.3%
      (N = 16); psychotic depression response rate, 55.6% (N = 15); and psychotic
      depression remission rate, 40.7% (N = 11). CONCLUSION: The combination of
      olanzapine and fluoxetine appears to be a promising, safe, and effective
      treatment for psychotic depression. Double-blind studies are needed to confirm
      this impression.

TI  - Windup of flexion reflexes in chronic human spinal cord injury: a marker for
      neuronal plateau potentials?
PG  - 416-26
AB  - The physiological basis of flexion spasms in individuals after spinal cord injury
      (SCI) may involve alterations in the properties of spinal neurons in the flexion 
      reflex pathways. We hypothesize that these changes would be manifested as
      progressive increases in reflex response with repetitive stimulus application
      (i.e., "windup") of the flexion reflexes. We investigated the windup of flexion
      reflex responses in 12 individuals with complete chronic SCI. Flexion reflexes
      were triggered using trains of electrical stimulation of plantar skin at variable
      intensities and inter-stimulus intervals. For threshold and suprathreshold
      stimulation, windup of both peak ankle and hip flexion torques and of integrated 
      tibialis anterior electromyographic activity was observed consistently in all
      patients at inter-stimulus intervals < or =3 s. For subthreshold stimuli,
      facilitation of reflexes occurred only at intervals < or =1 s. Similarly, the
      latency of flexion reflexes decreased significantly at intervals < or =1 s.
      Patients that were receiving anti-spasticity medications (e.g., baclofen) had
      surprisingly larger windup of reflex responses than those who did not take such
      medications, although this difference may be related to differences of spasm
      frequency between the groups of subjects. The results indicate that the increase 
      in spinal neuronal excitability following a train of electrical stimuli lasts for
      < or =3 s, similar to previous studies of nociceptive processing. Such
      long-lasting increases in flexion reflex responses suggest that cellular
      mechanisms such as plateau potentials in spinal motoneurons, interneurons, or
      both, may partially mediate spinal cord hyperexcitability in the absence of
      descending modulatory input.

TI  - Implantable devices for pain control: spinal cord stimulation and intrathecal
      therapies.
PG  - 619-49
AB  - Untreated chronic pain is costly to society and to the individual suffering from 
      it. The treatment of chronic pain, a multidimensional disease, should rely on the
      expertise of varying health care providers and should focus not only on the
      neurobiological mechanisms of the process but also on the psychosocial aspects of
      the disease. Implantable devices are costly and invasive, and such efficacious
      therapies should be used only when more conservative and less costly therapies
      have failed to provide relief of pain and suffering. Spinal cord stimulation
      provides neuromodulation of neuropathic, but not nociceptive, pain signals and
      when used for appropriate indications in the right individuals provides
      approximately 60-80% long-term pain relief in 60-80% of patients trialled for
      efficacy. Intrathecal therapies with opioids such as morphine, fentanyl,
      sufentanil or meperidine--or non-opioids such as clonidine or
      bupivacaine--provide analgesia in patients with nociceptive or neuropathic pain
      syndromes. Baclofen, intrathecally, provides profound relief of muscle spasticity
      due to multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injuries, brain injuries or cerebral
      palsy.

TI  - Variations among emergency departments in the treatment of benign headache.
PG  - 90-7
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: The practice patterns of US emergency departments in the
      treatment of patients with isolated benign headache have been recently described.
      How treatment varies among EDs has not been reported. To assess institutional
      variability in the pharmacotherapy of patients with benign headache, we describe 
      and analyze the practice patterns of 3 US EDs. METHODS: This health records
      survey included a cohort sample of consecutive adult patients aged 16 to 65 years
      treated with parenteral medication for isolated benign headache at 3
      nonaffiliated US EDs: a large, group-model health maintenance organization, a
      tertiary-care academic center, and a rural community hospital. Patients who
      underwent a diagnostic search for intracranial pathology, who had any nonheadache
      secondary diagnosis, or who had coexistent trauma, fever (temperature of > or
      =38.0 degrees C [100.4 degrees F]), or known pregnancy were excluded from study
      analysis. Demographic, clinical, and pharmacotherapeutic variables were collected
      for each ED visit. Descriptive analyses were performed; comparisons were made
      with t tests. RESULTS: Of the 490 eligible patients treated during the 4-month
      study period, the mean age was 36.4 years, and 374 (76%) were women. During their
      629 visits, 364 (58%) received a migraine diagnosis, and 258 (41%) received a
      nonspecific headache diagnosis. Polypharmacy was common: 515 (82%) received 2 or 
      more medications, and 154 (25%) received 3 or more medications. Pharmacotherapy
      varied greatly among the EDs. Use of opioid agonists showed the widest variation 
      (16% to 72%), although use of dihydroergotamine (5% to 16%), prochlorperazine
      (32% to 59%), and adjunct diphenhydramine with prochlorperazine (42% versus 88%) 
      also varied. CONCLUSION: Great institutional variability exists among US EDs in
      the parenteral treatment of patients with isolated benign headache.

TI  - Chronic pain secondary to disability: a review.
PG  - 3-17
AB  - BACKGROUND: Until recently, very little has been written regarding chronic pain
      as a secondary problem in persons who already have a physical disability, despite
      the potential for pain to increase the negative impact of what may already be a
      very disabling condition. The purpose of this review is to summarize what is
      currently known concerning the nature and scope of chronic pain as a secondary
      condition to disability, specifically spinal cord injury, acquired amputations,
      cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, neuromuscular disease, and postpolio
      syndrome. METHOD: What is known concerning the frequency, severity, impact, and
      treatment of pain in these specific conditions is reviewed, as are the factors
      that contribute to, or are associated with, adjustment to chronic pain in these
      disability groups. The authors conclude with several research questions that
      emerge from this knowledge, the answers to which will contribute to the long-term
      goal of the reduction of pain and suffering in persons with disabilities.
      CONCLUSIONS: The existing literature clearly documents that many persons with
      disabilities experience chronic pain. Many questions remain unanswered regarding 
      the scope, severity, and treatment of chronic pain in these groups.

TI  - Demographics, assessment and management of pain in the elderly.
PG  - 23-57
AB  - The prevalence of pain increases with each decade of life. Pain in the elderly is
      distinctly different from pain experienced by younger individuals. Cancer is a
      leading cause of pain; however, other conditions that cause pain such as facet
      joint arthritis (causing low back pain), polymyalgia rheumatica, Paget's disease,
      neuropathies, peripheral vascular disease and coronary disease most commonly
      occur in patients over the age of 50 years. Poorly controlled pain in the elderly
      leads to cognitive failure, depression and mood disturbance and reduces
      activities of daily living. Barriers to pain management include a sense of
      fatalism, denial, the desire to be 'the good patient', geographical barriers and 
      financial limitations. Aging causes physiological changes that alter the
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of analgesics, narrowing their therapeutic 
      index and increasing the risk of toxicity and drug-drug interactions. CNS changes
      lead to an increased risk of delirium. Assessment among the verbal but
      cognitively impaired elderly is satisfactorily accomplished with the help of
      unidimensional and multidimensional pain scales. A comprehensive physical
      examination and pain history is essential, as well as a review of cognitive
      function and activities of daily living. The goal of pain management among the
      elderly is improvement in pain and optimisation of activities of daily living,
      not complete eradication of pain nor the lowest possible drug dosages. Most
      successful management strategies combine pharmacological and nonpharmacological
      (home remedies, massage, topical agents, heat and cold packs and informal
      cognitive strategies) therapies. A basic principle of the pharmacological
      approach in the elderly is to start analgesics at low dosages and titrate slowly.
      The WHO's three-step guideline to pain management should guide prescribing.
      Opioid choices necessitate an understanding of pharmacology to ensure safe
      administration in end-organ failure and avoidance of drug interactions. Adjuvant 
      analgesics are used to reduce opioid adverse effects or improve poorly controlled
      pain. Adjuvant analgesics (NSAIDs, tricyclic antidepressants and antiepileptic
      drugs) are initiated prior to opioids for nociceptive and neuropathic pain.
      Preferred adjuvants for nociceptive pain are short-acting paracetamol
      (acetaminophen), NSAIDs, cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors and corticosteroids
      (short-term). Preferred drugs for neuropathic pain include desipramine,
      nortriptyline, gabapentin and valproic acid. Drugs to avoid are pentazocine,
      pethidine (meperidine), dextropropoxyphene and opioids that are both an agonist
      and antagonist, ketorolac, indomethacin, piroxicam, mefenamic acid, amitriptyline
      and doxepin. The type of pain, and renal and hepatic function, alter the
      preferred adjuvant and opioid choices. Selection of the appropriate analgesics is
      also influenced by versatility, polypharmacy, severity and type of pain, drug
      availability, associated symptoms and cost.

TI  - Lansoprazole: in the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease in children.
PG  - 57-61; discussion 62
AB  - Lansoprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, inactivates the H(+)/K(+)-ATPase pump in
      parietal cells, thereby suppressing basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion
      and increasing intragastric pH. After 8-12 weeks' treatment with lansoprazole,
      all children (n = 27) with esophagitis at baseline were healed (confirmed by
      endoscopy) and 76% of 62 evaluable children experienced improvements in overall
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms. In this noncomparative trial, 66
      children (aged 1-11 years) with GERD with or without esophagitis received oral
      lansoprazole 15 or 30 mg once daily dependent on their weight. The drug is
      generally well tolerated in children with GERD. In the largest study, the most
      common treatment-related adverse events occurring during therapy were
      constipation and headache.

TI  - Gabapentin withdrawal presenting as status epilepticus.
PG  - 925-8
AB  - A 34-year-old male with lumbar disc disease and surgery was placed on gabapentin 
      daily for chronic back pain. He remained on a steady dose of 8000 mg/day for 9
      months, almost doubled what is considered therapeutic. He ran out of medication, 
      was unable to refill his prescription for 2 days and presented to the emergency
      department in status epilepticus. There was no previous history of seizure
      disorder and he was on no other medications. A medical evaluation for an
      alternative etiology of his seizures was negative. Although gabapentin withdrawal
      has been previously reported and usually consists of anxiety, diaphoresis, and
      palpitations, this is the first reported patient with generalized seizures and
      status epilepticus secondary to gabapentin withdrawal.

TI  - Epilepsia partialis continua associated with widespread gliomatosis cerebri.
PG  - 392-6
AB  - We report an uncommon association of intractable epilepsia partialis continua
      that was the main presentation of widespread gliomatosis cerebri in two females. 
      Both children had a preceding prolonged secondary generalized seizure 2-4 months 
      before the evolution of epilepsia partialis continua, including recurrent
      clusters of left-sided myoclonic twitching and sensory impairment. During these
      events, the children remained fully alert. These seizures were corroborated by
      prolonged focal epileptic spike/wave discharges evident on the
      electroencephalograms. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging in the first patient
      demonstrated a wide area of increasing signals over the right frontocentral
      regions, along with diffuse cortical-subcortical infiltration impinging on the
      left hemisphere. In the second patient a cortical lesion was suspected.
      Evaluation for Rasmussen's encephalitis, focal cortical dysplasia, or a
      gliomatous process was conducted; the patients underwent a stereotactic brain
      biopsy in which the histologic findings were compatible with gliomatosis cerebri 
      with diffuse widespread infiltration of glioma cells with no constitution of a
      circumscribed tumor mass. The first patient was treated with cranial radiation,
      chemotherapy, steroids, and combined antiepileptic therapy. The focal seizures
      gradually but markedly decreased in frequency, and sensory impairment abated
      within 18 months after establishment of the diagnosis and ensuing therapy.
      Cognition remains intact. The second female died 2 years after presentation
      despite massive chemotherapy and antiepileptic medications. Although rare,
      gliomatosis cerebri should be taken into account in the differential diagnosis of
      epilepsia partialis continua in children to facilitate a rapid diagnosis and
      initiation of prompt treatment of this rare disorder that may respond to a
      concurrent effective combination of cranial radiation, chemotherapy, and
      antiepileptic medications.

TI  - Adverse drug events associated with hospital admission.
PG  - 5-11
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To increase the knowledge base on the frequency, causality, and
      avoidability of adverse drug events (ADEs) as a cause for admission in internal
      medicine or when occurring during hospitalization. METHODS: A prospective study
      was performed for 6 periods of 8 days each. Epidemiologic data (e.g., age,
      gender, medical history), drug utilization, and adverse drug reactions on
      patients hospitalized during these periods were collected by a pharmacy student. 
      RESULTS: A total of 156 patients (70 men and 86 women) were included in the
      study. The patients' mean age +/- SD was 66.5 +/- 18.1 years and mean length of
      stay was 13.2 +/- 9 days. Renal and hepatic insufficiency and previous history of
      drug intolerance were observed in 17.9%, 10.2%, and 2% of the hospitalized
      patients, respectively. Thirty-eight ADEs occurred in 32 patients; in 15 cases,
      ADEs were identified as the reason for admission, 10 cases occurred during
      hospitalization, and 13 cases were present at admission, but were not the cause
      of admission. The most frequent ADEs involved the neurologic (23.6%), renal
      (15.7%), and hematologic (13.1%) systems. Among these 38 ADEs, 22 were considered
      avoidable (57.9%); 20 of these were associated with therapeutic errors
      (inappropriate administration, drug-drug interactions, dosage error, drug not
      stopped despite the onset of ADEs). Patients with ADEs stayed longer in the
      hospital and took more drugs both before and during their hospital stay (p <
      0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Most of the ADEs observed in this study were avoidable. The
      risk/benefit ratio of administered drugs could be improved with better knowledge 
      of the patients' medical history and the risk factors of ADEs.

TI  - Utilizing brain imaging for analgesic drug development.
PG  - 1342-7
AB  - Analgesia is defined as loss of pain sensation without loss of consciousness;
      pain may be acute or chronic. Acute pain is well understood and can be controlled
      with currently available analgesics. Chronic pain, however, is not effectively
      controlled with current analgesics and side effect profiles often limit the use
      of these agents. Currently there are: (i) no objective methods for defining pain 
      or analgesia in humans; (ii) no objective methods for correlating efficacy of
      analgesics in animal testing with human testing; and (iii) no objective method of
      evaluating the efficacy of analgesics in painful conditions, including
      neuropathic pain in which adaptive or maladaptive changes evolve with time. A
      technological revolution in functional brain imaging in humans and animals offers
      new approaches to objective evaluation of analgesics and of clinical pain states.
      These approaches hold great promise for revolutionizing drug development at
      preclinical and clinical stages.

TI  - A paradoxical effect of levetiracetam may be seen in both children and adults
      with refractory epilepsy.
PG  - 42-6
AB  - The aim of this prospective, uncontrolled clinical study was to evaluate the
      tolerability and the efficacy of levetiracetam as add-on treatment in 78 adults
      and 44 children with intractable epilepsy. The patients' seizure frequency in the
      8 weeks baseline period was compared to their seizure frequency after a mean
      follow-up of 8 months of treatment.A greater than 50% reduction in seizure
      frequency was achieved in 31 adults (40%) and 9 children (20%), of whom 7 adults 
      (9%) and 3 children (7%) became seizure free. Most often levetiracetam was well
      tolerated, somnolence being the most frequently reported side effect (18% in
      adults and 7% in children). However, in 14 adults (18%) and 19 children (43%)
      levetiracetam was associated with an increase (>25%) in seizure frequency. Such a
      paradoxical effect, including the development of status epilepticus in three
      adults and four children, appeared most often in mentally retarded patients
      during the first 2 months of treatment, and on relatively high doses. Two
      children developed status epilepticus after 5 and 7 months, respectively. In
      conclusion, levetiracetam is usually well tolerated as add-on treatment in
      patients with difficult-to-treat partial onset seizures. By using a lower initial
      dose and a slower dose escalation than recommended by the manufacturer, a
      paradoxical effect may perhaps be avoided. In children, doses >20 mgkg(-1) per
      day should be introduced with caution.

TI  - Treatment of acid-related diseases in the elderly with emphasis on the use of
      proton pump inhibitors.
PG  - 911-27
AB  - Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have revolutionised the treatment of acid-related
      disorders, and they have also made it possible to define the spectrum of acid
      inhibition required for optimal treatment in each disorder. Five PPIs are now
      available: the older drugs, omeprazole, lansoprazole and pantoprazole, and the
      two newest, rabeprazole and esomeprazole. These agents have predominantly been
      developed in the younger adult population, and data for the elderly population
      are limited. Subtle differences have emerged between the old and the new PPIs in 
      their pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and efficacy profiles. The degree of
      clinical relevance of these differences in the adult population is in question.
      However, according to this review, based on the available data for the elderly
      and by inference from the adult population, the differences are highly relevant
      in the elderly population. Studies of the pharmacokinetics of older PPIs
      demonstrated considerable variation in drug clearance that was reflected in a
      wide range of efficacy related to acid suppression with standard dosages. The
      newer PPIs offer several advantages over older agents, particularly in terms of
      rapid, profound and consistent acid inhibition. Consistent acid inhibition is
      particularly important in the elderly since clinical response is often difficult 
      to judge in this patient group. An individual's cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19
      genotype predicts the degree of acid suppression and consequently the clinical
      efficacy of the PPIs. The older PPIs are predominantly metabolised by CYP2C19,
      with this being of more importance for omeprazole and lansoprazole than
      pantoprazole. The hepatic metabolism of rabeprazole is predominantly by
      nonenzymatic reactions and minimally by CYP-mediated reactions, which therefore
      confers an advantage over older PPIs in that genetic polymorphisms for CYP2C19 do
      not significantly influence rabeprazole clearance, clinical efficacy or potential
      for drug interactions. The metabolism of esomeprazole involves CYP2C19 but to a
      lesser extent than its predecessor omeprazole. Furthermore, esomeprazole has a
      more rapid onset of action and less variation in clearance rates than omeprazole.
      Drug clearance decreases with age independently of CYP2C19 status, exaggerating
      some of the differences between the PPIs and increasing the risk of drug
      interactions.

TI  - Quinine pharmacokinetics in chronic haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 604-9
AB  - AIMS: Quinine is often used to prevent muscle cramps in patients with chronic
      renal failure. A standard dose of 300 mg at bedtime is usually recommended, but
      little is known about the pharmacokinetics of quinine in the presence of renal
      failure. METHODS: We studied the pharmacokinetics of quinine in eight normal
      subjects and eight patients with chronic renal failure on haemodialysis after a
      single oral dose of quinine sulphate (300 mg). RESULTS: The concentration of
      alpha1-acid glycoprotein (AAG), the major binding protein for quinine, was
      increased in haemodialysis patients compared with control subjects (1.52 g l-1 vs
      0.63 g l-1 [mean difference 1.033; 95% CI 0.735, 1.330]) whereas albumin levels
      were decreased (30 g l-1 vs 40 g l-1 [mean difference 9.5; 95% CI 3.048,
      15.952]). Accordingly, the free fraction of quinine was decreased (0.024 vs 0.063
      [mean difference 0.0380; 95% CI 0.0221, 0.0539]) and the apparent volume of
      distribution tended to decrease (0.95 l kg-1 vs 1.43 l kg-1 [mean difference
      0.480; 95% CI 0.193, 1.154]). The quinine binding ratio correlated with the
      plasma concentration of AAG but not that of albumin. The clearance of free
      (unbound) quinine was increased in haemodialysis patients compared with controls 
      (67.9 ml min-1 kg-1 vs 41.1 ml min-1 kg-1 [mean difference -26.8; 95% CI,
      -56.994, 3.469]), and the area under the curve (AUC) of the two main metabolites,
      3-hydroxyquinine and 10,11-dihydroxydihydroquinine were increased. CONCLUSIONS:
      In patients with chronic renal failure, there is an increase in plasma protein
      binding and in the clearance of free drug, resulting in lower plasma
      concentration of free quinine.

TI  - Tetrazepam drug sensitivity -- usefulness of the patch test.
PG  - 135-8
AB  - The muscle relaxant tetrazepam may cause severe cutaneous adverse effects. We
      report 4 cases of varying intensity: Stevens-Johnson syndrome,
      erythema-multiforme-like exanthema, maculopapular and maculo-urticarial
      exanthema. Patch testing with tetrazepam (10% in petrolatum) was strongly
      positive in the 2 patients with severe skin eruptions and weakly positive in the 
      other 2. Oral rechallenge with tetrazepam was positive in 3 patients (1 not
      done). Diazepam, with a similar chemical structure to tetrazepam, was negative on
      patch testing and on oral challenge testing in 2 patients. Although the optimal
      patch test concentration of tetrazepam has still to be determined, it is a useful
      diagnostic tool to confirm sensitization, particularly in patients with severe
      bullous eruptions.

      and south-central United States of America. METHOD: Case reports and literature
      review. RESULTS: Case reports are presented of four children or adolescents with 
      SCI who exhibited self-injurious behavior. Two of the subjects had symptoms
      consistent with dysesthesia. The self-injurious behavior in these two subjects
      and a very young child responded to treatment with anticonvulsants. The
      self-injurious behavior in the fourth patient was probably the result of poor
      technique of using his mouth to move his hands, which responded to conservative
      management including education, occupational therapy and gloves. CONCLUSION:
      Self-injurious behavior is a relatively unusual complication of pediatric onset
      SCI, and may be a manifestation of dysesthesia and be responsive to treatment
      with anticonvulsants.

TI  - Quetiapine in the treatment of rapid cycling bipolar disorder.
PG  - 335-40
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This prospective open-label study assessed the impact of add-on
      quetiapine in the treatment of rapid cycling bipolar patients. METHODS: Fourteen 
      rapid cycling bipolar patients were treated with quetiapine, which was added to
      their ongoing medication regimen for 112 +/- 33 days. At the beginning of the
      study, five were manic, three were in a mixed state, three were depressed, two
      hypomanic and one was euthymic. Patients were assessed prospectively with a
      modified version of the Clinical Global Impression Scale for Bipolars (CGI-BP),
      the Young Scale for mania (YMRS) and the Hamilton Scale for Depression (HDRS).
      RESULTS: A significant reduction of the following scale scores was observed: a
      1.8 point reduction for the general CGI-BP (p = 0.013), a -1.3 point for the
      mania subscale (p = 0.016), a -1.01 point for the YMRS (p = 0.025). Improvement
      in depressive symptoms was not significant, neither in the CGI-BP (-1 point, p = 
      0.074) nor in the HDRS (-5.2 points, p = NS). The most common side-effect was
      sedation (n = 6, 43%). Doses of quetiapine were significantly reduced by the end 
      of the study (443 +/- 235 mg/day versus 268 +/- 190 mg/day, p = 0.008) and they
      also differed according to the initial episode to be treated (720 +/- 84 mg/day
      for mania, and 183 +/- 29 mg/day for depression, p = 0.023). CONCLUSIONS:
      Quetiapine could possibly be an effective treatment for rapid cycling bipolar
      patients. Adequate doses for acute episodes could significantly differ according 
      to the episode polarity and the length of treatment.

TI  - Antiepileptic drug therapy for adults: when to initiate and how to choose.
PG  - 1367-75
AB  - Although antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are commonly used to control and prevent
      seizures, their long-term use carries a considerable risk of morbidity. The
      decision to start AEDs is made once the risks of further seizures outweigh the
      risks of treatment. Despite a large body of literature on the subject, this
      common clinical issue perplexes many practitioners because of its neurologic,
      psychological, and, at times, legal implications. Adding to the confusion is the 
      recent approval of several new AEDs. This article summarizes the current evidence
      to support individual clinical decisions regarding initiation of AEDs in adults
      and considers the use of AEDs as seizure prophylaxis. Recently approved AEDs are 
      discussed to help the practitioner understand when to initiate and how to choose 
      the appropriate AED for the patient with seizures.

TI  - Current management of interstitial cystitis.
PG  - 649-60
AB  - The management of patients with IC remains a challenge because no single agent
      has proven universally effective. DMSO and PPS have been evaluated through early 
      placebo-controlled trials, and these two agents are FDA approved treatments for
      IC. BCG is currently undergoing a large placebo-controlled trial, and hyaluronic 
      acid is receiving similar clinical evaluation. Sacral nerve root stimulation
      shows promise with early favorable results. As with any treatment algorithm, it
      is reasonable to begin with conservative treatment using time-dependent
      milestones, allowing adequate trials of successive therapy while ensuring an
      appropriate pace for timely symptom resolution.

TI  - Rectal diazepam gel for treatment of acute repetitive seizures in adults.
PG  - 1915-20
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of diazepam (DZP) rectal gel
      (Diastat; Elan Pharmaceuticals, Dublin, Ireland) for the treatment of acute
      repetitive seizures in adult patients in 2 multicenter, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled parallel studies. METHODS: Ninety-six adults 18 years or older
      with acute repetitive seizures, 70 of whom received treatment, were randomized
      into the 2 studies. Active and placebo medications were supplied in prefilled,
      identical-appearing delivery systems. In study 001, patients received a second
      dose 4 hours after the initial treatment. Patients in study 003 received only 1
      treatment. Patients were observed for 12 hours after the first dose. RESULTS:
      There was a significant reduction in seizure frequency in patients who received
      DZP compared with the placebo group. The median number of seizures per hour in
      the group treated with DZP rectal gel was 0.00, vs 0.13 in the placebo group (P
      =.002). In addition, significantly more DZP rectal gel-treated patients remained 
      seizure-free during the 12-hour observation period (71% [22/31] vs 28% [11/39]). 
      Using Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis, time to the next seizure was found to be 
      significantly longer in DZP rectal gel-treated than placebo-treated patients
      (P<.001). Global assessment as provided by the caregivers was in favor of DZP
      rectal gel for both study 001 (P =.17) and study 003 (P =.02). Dizziness and
      somnolence were the only central nervous system adverse events that occurred more
      frequently in patients receiving DZP rectal gel than in those receiving placebo. 
      CONCLUSION: In adults, rectal DZP formulated as Diastat significantly reduced the
      likelihood of seizure recurrence during an episode of acute repetitive seizures, 
      with minimal safety concerns.

TI  - Amitriptyline in the prophylaxis of central poststroke pain. Preliminary results 
      of 39 patients in a placebo-controlled, long-term study.
PG  - 3030-2
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to 
      investigate the effectiveness of amitriptyline for the prophylactic treatment of 
      patients with acute thalamic stroke in preventing central poststroke pain.
      METHODS: Subject received, in a randomized sequence, either amitriptyline
      titrated from 10 to 75 mg in extended-release form or placebo over a therapy
      period of 365 days. We documented the time when pain developed; the intensity,
      type, site, and distribution of pain; and the presence/absence and type of
      allodynia. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients (23 women and 16 men; age range, 36 to
      68 years) with central poststroke pain participated. The placebo group showed a
      pain rate of 21% within 1 year after the diagnosis of thalamic stroke compared
      with 17% in the group under prophylactic treatment with amitriptyline. Average
      (SE) time to pain was 318 (23) days for patients in the placebo group and 324
      (24) days for patients in the amitriptyline group. CONCLUSIONS: With the achieved
      sample sizes of this study and a pain rate of approximately 21% in the placebo
      group, any near-perfect pain protection would have been detected. Near-perfect
      pain protection, in this context, refers to pain in <2.4% of the recruited
      patients treated with amitriptyline or in approximately 89% of placebo-treated
      patients. Larger studies are recommended to test the hypothesis that prophylactic
      amitriptyline reduces but does not completely prevent central poststroke pain.

TI  - Increase in Cx45 gap junction channels in cerebral smooth muscle cells from SHR.
PG  - 940-6
AB  - We recently reported the novel finding of expression and function of connexin45
      (Cx45) in cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells. We examined the hypothesis that
      Cx45 is altered in hypertension. Immunoblots for Cx45 showed a significant
      increase in Cx45 in cerebral arteries from adult spontaneously hypertensive rats 
      (SHR) compared with adult Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, with no difference in aorta or
      femoral artery. Patch-clamp of cerebral smooth muscle cells pairs from SHR versus
      WKY showed a significantly steeper voltage dependence of deactivation and partial
      block of junctional currents by quinine and by a peptide that interferes with
      docking of Cx45, consistent with dominance of functional Cx45 channels in SHR. We
      examined potential roles of blood pressure versus angiotensin in elevated Cx45 in
      SHR by measuring Cx45 protein in 4 groups: (1) long-term administration in Wistar
      rats of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME; (2) long-term administration 
      in SHR of the ACE inhibitor captopril; (3) long-term administration in Wistar
      rats of angiotensin; and (4) exposure of basilar artery segments in organ culture
      to angiotensin. Blood pressure was significantly elevated in groups 1 and 3 and
      was normal in group 2. In groups 1, 2, and 4, there was no significant change in 
      Cx45 protein. In group 3, there was a modest but insignificant increase in Cx45
      protein but no change in voltage dependence of deactivation of junctional
      currents. Overall, our data show increased Cx45 in SHR that is unlikely to be due
      to either elevated blood pressure or to angiotensin. Relative dominance of Cx45
      over Cx43 in cerebral vessels may predispose SHR to ischemic stroke.

TI  - In vivo imaging of neuroinflammation.
PG  - 581-6
AB  - We briefly outline the rationale for employing positron emission tomography
      (PET), using the ligand [11C](R)-PK11195, the binding site for which is highly
      expressed by activated microglia, in order (a) to detect in vivo
      neuroinflammatory changes occurring in a variety of brain diseases and at
      different disease stages and (b) to monitor the progression of neuroinflammation 
      as a generic in vivo marker of 'disease activity'. The use of [11C](R)-PK11195
      PET is described as a systematic attempt at measuring the emerging phenomenology 
      of tissue pathology itself-as opposed to measuring, for example, the loss of
      neuronal function or structure-and as a proof of principle for the clinical
      utility of imaging glial cells in vivo.

TI  - Phenomenology of "Lubag" or X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism.
PG  - 1271-7
AB  - X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP), or Lubag syndrome, is known to cause
      progressive dystonia, with or without parkinsonism, among Filipino male adults
      with maternal roots from the Philippine island of Panay. We present
      cinematographic material of 11 cases of Lubag carrying the XDP haplotypes who
      manifest with a wide spectrum of movement disorders, including dystonia, tremor, 
      parkinsonism, myoclonus, chorea, and myorhythmia. Because of overlapping
      features, Lubag patients are commonly misdiagnosed as idiopathic dystonia,
      essential tremor, Parkinson's disease, or Parkinson's-plus syndromes. Thus, it is
      imperative to elicit an exhaustive family history in any Filipino male adult who 
      presents with a movement disorder.

TI  - A survey of a novel epilepsy clinic.
PG  - 519-22
AB  - The management of a group of epilepsy patients from primary care, in a
      geographical area with clear epilepsy management guidelines and secondary care
      clinics is surveyed. Suggestions are made to improve liaison between primary and 
      secondary care as well as epilepsy management in primary care. All 42 local
      primary care practices were invited to take part in this project. A study day
      providing a broad overview of epilepsy management was held. Those attending were 
      expected to identify all patients in their practice with epilepsy using
      diagnostic codes and prescribing data. Nine of the invited 42 practices took part
      in the project, and identified 506 patients prescribed anti-epilepsy drugs
      (AEDs). Three hundred and three patients were invited for review by their
      practice nurse, following exclusion of those prescribed AEDs for other
      conditions, children and those already under specialist review. One hundred and
      sixteen patients attended for review. Seventy-one patients were identified as
      requiring specialist review and a consultant neurologist, epilepsy nurse
      specialist and clinical assistant completed them. Of the 71 patients 31 had
      experienced no seizures for 5 years, 40 had experienced seizures in the past 5
      years, of whom 32 had experienced seizures in the last year. Sixteen were
      suffering at least one seizure per month, and a few had poorly controlled
      epilepsy. Patients were taking mainly Phenytoin, Carbamazepine and Sodium
      valproate. Twenty were taking polytherapy and one no treatment.Fifty-two patients
      reported side effects and 15 poor compliance. Many patients reviewed were
      considered to be taking unnecessary medication and suffering unnecessary side
      effects. There is a need for improved epilepsy management in primary care and
      better liaison between primary and secondary care.

      childhood.
PG  - 489-93
AB  - We report a girl with refractory partial seizures since 7 years of age, secondary
      to right frontal cortical dysplasia, who developed MRI and SPECT abnormalities in
      the contralateral hemicerebellar cortex. These became more marked, leading to
      left hemicerebellar atrophy. Crossed cerebellar diaschisis has been described
      mostly in hemispheric stroke and supratentorial tumours, but less often in
      epilepsy. It is usually a transient phenomenon. This report shows that crossed
      cerebellar diaschisis can develop within two years of seizure onset and evolve
      over time.

AB  - Acquired Pendular Nystagmus (APN) may cause distressing visual symptoms in
      patients who are already suffering a severe general disease. Averbuch-Heller et
      al. conducted the first double-blind controlled study on treatment for APN. They 
      showed that gabapentin substantially reduces pendular nystagmus and significantly
      increases visual acuity in the majority of patients. We present a patient with
      APN due to multiple sclerosis who suffered severe oscillopsy and reduction of
      visual acuity and who substantially benefited from a trial treatment with this
      agent.

TI  - Effectiveness of adjunctive gabapentin in resistant bipolar disorder: is it due
      to anxious-alcohol abuse comorbidity?
PG  - 584-91
AB  - We evaluated effectiveness and predictors of response of gabapentin (GBP) as
      adjunctive treatment in a sample of 43 subjects with DSM-III-R bipolar disorder
      who were resistant to standard mood stabilizers. Diagnostic evaluation was
      performed by means of the Semistructured Interview for Mood Disorder. Clinical
      evaluation was performed at the beginning and end of the observation period by
      means of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), the Young Mania Rating
      Scale, and the Clinical Global Impression Scale. GBP was administered as an
      adjunctive treatment for an 8-week period in combination with other mood
      stabilizers, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, and neuroleptics. Mean dosage +/- 
      SD at week 8 was 1270 +/- 561.4 mg (range, 600-2400 mg). Adjunctive treatment
      with GBP was well tolerated by almost all the subjects; only three patients had
      to interrupt treatment before week 8, two because of inefficacy and one because
      of the appearance of side effects (ataxia and irritability); in other patients,
      the most frequent side effects were sedation, irritability, tremor, ataxia or
      motor instability, and nausea. Eighteen (41.9%) of 43 patients who began
      treatment were considered responders. Mean total HAM-D score showed a significant
      reduction during the 8 weeks of treatment. Analysis of the various HAM-D
      dimensions showed that the anxiety-somatization factor was the one with the
      greatest change. Seventeen of the 18 responder patients remained in remission for
      a period ranging from 4 to 12 months without clinically significant side effects 
      or adverse events. One patient had to interrupt GBP treatment and be administered
      neuroleptics because of the reappearance of manic symptoms. Regarding response
      predictors, logistical regression analysis showed that the presence of panic
      disorder and alcohol abuse was associated with positive response. The results of 
      the present study replicate prior studies indicating that GBP is an effective and
      well tolerated treatment in a large proportion of bipolar patients who are
      resistant to traditional mood stabilizers. More specifically, this drug appears
      to have antidepressant and anxiolytic properties. What is new in the present
      report is the suggestion that the utility of GBP in resistant bipolar disorder
      resides in its effectiveness against comorbid panic disorder and alcohol abuse.

TI  - Treatment of restless legs syndrome with gabapentin: a double-blind, cross-over
      study.
PG  - 1573-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of gabapentin on sensory and motor symptoms in
      patients with restless legs syndrome (RLS). METHODS: Patients with RLS (22
      idiopathic, 2 secondary to iron deficiency) were randomized and treated for 6
      weeks with either gabapentin or placebo. After a 1-week washout they crossed over
      to the alternative treatment for 6 weeks. Patients were rated at baseline and at 
      scheduled intervals by the RLS Rating Scale, Clinical Global Impression, pain
      analogue scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. At the end of each treatment 
      period, all-night polysomnography was performed. RESULTS: Compared to placebo,
      gabapentin was associated with reduced symptoms on all rating scales. In
      addition, sleep studies showed a significantly reduced periodic leg movements
      during sleep (PLMS) index and improved sleep architecture (increased total sleep 
      time, sleep efficiency, and slow wave sleep, and decreased stage 1 sleep).
      Patients whose symptoms included pain benefited most from gabapentin. The mean
      effective dosage at the end of the 6-week treatment period was 1,855 mg, although
      therapeutic effects were already observed at the end of week 4 (1,391 mg).
      CONCLUSIONS: Gabapentin improves sensory and motor symptoms in RLS and also
      improves sleep architecture and PLMS.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of hydroxyzine in the treatment of generalized anxiety
      disorder: a 3-month double-blind study.
PG  - 1020-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) represents an
      important public health issue. Hydroxyzine, an antagonist of histamine receptors,
      showed both efficacy and safety in previous short-term double-blind studies over 
      placebo in this pathology. The aim of the current study was to confirm those
      positive results over a 3-month period in adult outpatients. METHOD: This
      multicenter, parallel (hydroxyzine [50 mg/day]; bromazepam [6 mg/day]),
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included 2 weeks of
      single-blind run-in placebo, 12 weeks of double-blind randomized treatment, and 4
      weeks of single-blind run-out placebo. Three hundred thirty-four of 369 selected 
      outpatients with a diagnosis of GAD according to DSM-IV criteria and a Hamilton
      Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) total score >/= 20 were randomized before
      entering the double-blind period. The primary outcome criterion was the change in
      the HAM-A score from baseline to 12 weeks of double-blind treatment with
      hydroxyzine compared with placebo. RESULTS: In the intent-to-treat analysis, the 
      mean +/- SD change in HAM-A scores from baseline to endpoint was -12.16 +/- 7.74 
      for hydroxyzine and -9.64 +/- 7.74 for placebo (p =.019). Results at endpoint for
      percentage of responders (p =.003) and remission rates (p =.028), Clinical Global
      Impressions-Severity scale score (p =.001), maintenance of efficacy (p =.022),
      and Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale score on day 84 (p =.008) also
      confirmed the efficacy of hydroxyzine over placebo. The study showed no
      statistically significant difference between hydroxyzine and bromazepam. Except
      for drowsiness, which was more frequent with bromazepam, safety results were
      comparable in the 3 groups. CONCLUSION: Hydroxyzine showed both efficacy and
      safety in the treatment of GAD and appears to be an effective alternative
      treatment to benzodiazepine prescription.

TI  - Chronic pain of spinal origin: the costs of intervention.
PG  - 2614-9; discussion 2620
AB  - The cost of chronic benign spinal pain is large and growing. The costs of
      interventional treatment for spinal pain were at a minimum of $13 billion (U.S.
      dollars) in 1990, and the costs are growing at least 7% per year. Medical
      treatment of chronic pain costs $9000 to $19,000 per person per year. The costs
      of interventional therapy is calculated. Methods of evaluating differential
      treatments in terms of costs are described. Cost-minimization versus
      cost-effectiveness approaches are described. Spinal cord stimulation and
      intraspinal drug infusion systems are alternatives that can be justified on a
      cost basis. Cost minimization analysis suggests that epidural injections under
      fluoroscopy may not be justified by the current literature.

TI  - Neuraxial medication delivery: the development and maturity of a concept for
      treating chronic pain of spinal origin.
PG  - 2593-605; discussion 2606
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A literature review and synthesis were performed. OBJECTIVE: To
      summarize the history, use, and innovation related to neuraxial drug delivery for
      the treatment of intractable back pain. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The discovery
      of opioid receptors in the early 1970s provided a rational basis for the delivery
      of opioid drugs intraspinally. Epidural or intrathecal infusions deliver drugs
      directly to opioid receptors, limit systemic exposure, and by decreasing the
      opioid dosage required for pain relief, generally reduce side effects. The
      benefits of short-term spinal analgesia led to investigation of longer-term
      continuous subarachnoid opioid infusions for the management of both cancer pain
      and noncancer pain, such as that of spinal origin. METHODS: RESULTS: Unique
      features of this article include an updated pain continuum, updated indications
      for intrathecal therapy, a detailed comparison of trial techniques, a detailed
      comparison of the advantages of different types of pumps, a synopsis of
      troubleshooting for inadequate efficacy, and an updated statement regarding
      intrathecal pumps and radiologic procedures, including MRI scanning. Some
      challenges remain. Large-scale well-controlled studies could answer some
      perplexing questions regarding efficacy in patients with noncancer or neuropathic
      pain. Patient selection criteria undoubtedly will be refined and validated as
      more patients are treated. In addition, further investigation of specifically
      targeted medications or drug combinations for intraspinal use could increase
      efficacy, reduce side effects, and expand indications. CONCLUSIONS: Intraspinal
      medication delivery has become an effective technique for control of intractable 
      pain in appropriately selected patients seen by spine surgeons.

TI  - Combined pharmacologic and surgical approach to acquired nystagmus due to
      multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 780-2
AB  - PURPOSE: To describe a combined pharmacological and surgical approach to treating
      acquired nystagmus in a patient with multiple sclerosis. DESIGN: Interventional
      case report. METHODS: A 40-year-old patient with acquired horizontal and vertical
      nystagmus and severe oscillopsia secondary to multiple sclerosis had combined
      treatment with gabapentin and a vertical Kestenbaum-type procedure. RESULTS:
      After gabapentin treatment (3,000 mg orally daily) the horizontal nystagmus was
      significantly reduced, and the patient developed a marked chin-up position. The
      vertical nystagmus remained unchanged, dampening on downgaze. A recession of both
      inferior rectus muscles reduced the nystagmus significantly in primary position, 
      the abnormal head position disappeared, and oscillopsia completely resolved.
      Treatment increased visual acuity from 6/24 in the right eye and 6/60 in the left
      eye to 6/9 in both eyes. CONCLUSIONS: Acquired nystagmus in multiple sclerosis
      can be significantly improved by using a combined pharmacological and surgical
      approach.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the effects of botulinum toxin-A (btA) on
      spasticity in children with cerebral palsy (CP). Thirty-five children with
      spastic CP were evaluated. The injection group consisted of 25 patients who were 
      injected with btA and received conventional physical therapy. The control group
      consisted of 10 patients who were treated with conventional physical therapy
      only. In the injection group, btA was applied to the lower extremity spastic
      muscles at a total dose of 8-10 lU/kg. Spasticity was measured by the Ashworth
      scale. Gait function was evaluated by clinical gait assessment in all patients
      and temporal distance factors in 16 patients. All the parameters were recorded
      before treatment, after three days and after one month of therapy. Following
      injection of btA, significant improvement in all parameters was observed. No
      statistically significant progression was noted in the control group except
      clinical gait analysis scores. Comparing the three-day and one-month measurements
      of spasticity of the two groups, statistically significant results were obtained 
      in favour of the injection group in all parameters except for clinical gait
      analysis scores. The findings of this study showed btA injection to be an
      effective treatment for reducing spasticity and improving gait function in
      patients with spastic CP

TI  - Dexamethasone 8 mg in combination with ondansetron 4 mg appears to be the optimal
      dose for the prevention of nausea and vomiting after laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy.
PG  - 922-6
AB  - PURPOSE: The combination of antiemetic drugs could be a solution to prevent
      severe postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). The aim of this randomized
      double blind, dose-ranging study was to determine the minimum single effective
      dose of dexamethasone combined with ondansetron for the prevention of PONV in
      patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. METHODS: One hundred eighty
      patients were allocated randomly to one of six groups to receive saline (P
      group), ondansetron 4 mg (O group), or ondansetron 4 mg and dexamethasone at
      doses of 2 mg (OD2 group), 4 mg (OD4 group), 8 mg (OD8 group), and 16 mg (OD16
      group). A standardized general anesthetic was used. All episodes of PONV during
      the intervals of zero to six hours, 6-12 hr and 12-24 hr after surgery were
      evaluated using a numeric scoring system. Mean visual analogue scale pain scores 
      at rest and on movement, the time to first demand of analgesia, total analgesic
      consumption in 12 hr epochs, duration of hospital stay, and side effects were
      recorded. RESULTS: The incidence of PONV in the OD8 (16%) and OD16 (16%) groups
      was lower than in the 83% (P < 0.001) and O groups (50%) at the 12-24 hr epoch (P
      < 0.05). There were no differences in antiemetic effect between the O, OD2 and
      OD4 groups and between the OD8 and OD16 groups. Pain scores, total analgesic
      consumption, duration of hospital stay and side effects were similar among
      groups. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that 8 mg is the minimum dose of
      dexamethasone that, combined with ondansetron 4 mg will effectively prevent PONV 
      in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

TI  - Long-term safety and efficacy of continuous intrathecal baclofen.
PG  - 660-5
AB  - Long-term continuous intrathecal baclofen (CITB) infusion is a treatment option
      used to manage otherwise intractable spasticity and is delivered via an
      implantable pump. The purpose of this single-center multidisciplinary review was 
      to report on the long-term safety and efficacy of CITB in the treatment of 21
      children with intractable severe spasticity of cerebral origin. Nineteen
      recipients had spastic quadriplegia and two had spastic diplegia. Seven
      recipients had level IV severity on the Gross Motor Functional Classification
      System and 14 had level V. Median age at implantation was 12 years (range 4 to
      20). Fifteen recipients were male, 6 were female. Seventeen recipients were alive
      at the end of the follow-up period (31 to 78 months; mean 53, SD 4). The Ashworth
      scale showed a substantial decrease in spasticity in the upper and lower
      extremities at 6 months and at the most recent follow-up. The Gross Motor
      Function Measure and Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory showed no
      functional change. Most treatment goals were at least partly achieved. Caregivers
      reported a reduction in use of oral medication for spasticity, and improvements
      in comfort, function, and ease of care. Caregiver satisfaction was high. During
      80 recipient-years of pump operation, 153 treatment-associated adverse events
      occurred: 27 of these were device-related. There were four deaths unrelated to
      CITE, including one from acute pancreatitis. Our findings might assist in
      establishing patient selection criteria and treatment goals, improving patient
      follow-up, and monitoring adverse events.

TI  - Anti-epileptic drugs.
PG  - 304-9
AB  - As a sizeable population is affected by epilepsy, so its effective management is 
      a matter of concern. Newer anti-epileptic drugs are now in use, aimed at controls
      of seizure with fewer side-effects over and above the conventional anti-epileptic
      drugs. The anti-epileptic drugs can be divided in two groups--conventional
      anti-epileptic drugs and newer anti-epileptic drugs. The drugs which fall in the 
      first group are--phenytoin, phenobaibitone, valproic acid, carbamazepine,
      ethosuximide and clonazepam. The second group of drugs are--lamotrigine,
      clobazam, oxcarbazepine, topiramate and gabapentin. The pharmacology of the drugs
      are described in a nutshell in this article.

TI  - Nocturnal leg cramps in older people.
PG  - 596-8
AB  - Nocturnal leg cramps are common in older people. Such cramps are associated with 
      many common diseases and medications. Physiological methods may be useful for
      preventing cramps in some people, but there have been no controlled trials of
      these approaches. Quinine is moderately effective in preventing nocturnal leg
      cramps. However, there are concerns about the risk/benefit ratio with this drug. 
      In patients with severe symptoms, a trial of 4-6 weeks' treatment with quinine is
      probably still justified, but the efficacy of treatment should be monitored, for 
      example using a sleep and cramp diary.

TI  - Reversible brain lesions in childhood hypertension.
PG  - 1005-7
AB  - Posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome is characterized by an acute, usually
      reversible, encephalopathy with transient occipital lobe abnormalities detected
      on MRI that occur mostly in association with acute hypertension. The clinical
      presentation includes seizures, headache, altered mental status and blindness.
      Disturbed autoregulation of cerebral blood flow and endothelial injury are
      central to the pathogenesis of this disorder. Prompt control of hypertension
      results in rapid and complete neurological recovery. In this report we discuss
      the cases of two children with acute onset hypertension of different aetiologies 
      that presented with the characteristic features of posterior leukoencephalopathy 
      syndrome. CONCLUSION: Early recognition of this readily treatable condition may
      obviate the need for extensive and invasive investigations. Despite the alarming 
      lesions on the MRI, prompt control of hypertension carries a uniformly favourable
      prognosis.

TI  - The effect of intrathecal baclofen on muscle co-contraction in children with
      spasticity of cerebral origin.
PG  - 225-30
AB  - AIM: Investigation of the effect of intrathecal baclofen administration on the
      time course of electrical patterns of muscle activation in patients with
      spasticity due to upper motor neuron syndrome. METHODS: Six children with
      clinical signs of upper motor neuron syndrome resulting from an acquired cerebral
      hypoxic injury were tested. Simultaneous multichannel acquisition of surface EMG 
      activity from flexor/extensor muscle groups of the upper and lower limbs was
      recorded. Investigated muscle group pairs included biceps/triceps brachii, wrist 
      flexors/extensors, rectus/biceps femoris and tibialis anterioris/gastrocnemius.
      Time-frequency analysis of EMG activity at rest and while eliciting a stretch
      reflex was performed. The non-linear cross-correlation coefficient and time lag
      estimation were computed between paired channel groups both for baseline and
      post-intrathecal baclofen injection conditions for epochs consisting of 2 s prior
      to and 2 s after voluntary contraction. The effect of baclofen was assessed 3 h
      following single-bolus intrathecal injections of 25 or 50 microg during the
      baclofen trial and 6 months after baclofen pump implantation. RESULTS: In the
      baseline condition, the stretch reflex resulted in a synchronous increase in
      spectral EMG power in both the agonist and the antagonist muscles. The mean
      correlation coefficient between agonist and antagonist muscles was 0.948 (SD =
      0.034), and the mean time lag was 4.64 ms (SD = 1.84 ms). After intrathecal
      administration of baclofen, a dramatic decrease in the correlation coefficient
      between agonist and antagonists (mean value = 0.342) during voluntary contraction
      was observed. This corresponded to a significant reduction of tone and spasticity
      in all four limbs, and reduction of the Ashworth score by 2 points on average.
      CONCLUSION: After intrathecal baclofen administration, we observed a significant 
      decrease in the co-contraction pattern typically associated with upper motor
      neuron spasticity. This was evident clinically and was quantitatively expressed
      by the significantly decreased degree of coupling in EMG activity of
      agonist/antagonist muscles. Although a relatively small sample was investigated
      in this study, we were able to demonstrate the efficacy of this procedure in
      restoring selective activation of agonists during voluntary contraction. This is 
      one of the prerequisites of an improvement of motor function in patients with
      spasticity.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial of buprenorphine in the management of short-term
      ambulatory heroin withdrawal.
PG  - 1395-404
AB  - AIM: To determine whether buprenorphine is more effective than clonidine and
      other symptomatic medications in managing ambulatory heroin withdrawal. DESIGN:
      Open label, prospective randomized controlled trial examining withdrawal and
      4-week postwithdrawal outcomes on intention-to-treat. SETTING: Two specialist,
      out-patient drug treatment centres in inner city Melbourne and Sydney, Australia.
      PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and fourteen dependent heroin users were recruited.
      Participants were 18 years or over, and with no significant other drug
      dependence, medical or psychiatric conditions or recent methadone treatment. One 
      hundred and one (89%) participants completed a day 8 research interview examining
      withdrawal outcomes, and 92 (81%) completed day 35 research interview examining
      postwithdrawal outcomes. INTERVENTIONS: Participants randomized to control (n =
      56) (up to 8 days of clonidine and other symptomatic medications) or experimental
      (n = 58) (up to 5 days of buprenorphine) withdrawal groups. Following the 8-day
      withdrawal episode, participants could self-select from range of postwithdrawal
      options (naltrexone, substitution maintenance, or counselling). MEASUREMENTS:
      Retention in withdrawal; heroin use during withdrawal; and retention in drug
      treatment 4 weeks after withdrawal. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Withdrawal severity;
      adverse events, and heroin use in the postwithdrawal period. FINDINGS: The
      experimental group had better treatment retention at day 8 (86% versus 57%, P =
      0.001, 95% CI for numbers needed to treat (NNT) = 3-8) and day 35 (62% versus
      39%, P = 0.02, 95% CI for NNT = 4-18); used heroin on fewer days during the
      withdrawal programme (2.6 +/- 2.5 versus 4.5 +/- 2.3, P < 0.001, 95% CI = 1-2.5
      days) and in the postwithdrawal period (9.0 +/- 8.2 versus 14.6 +/- 10, P < 0.01,
      95% CI = 1.8-9.4); and reported less withdrawal severity. No severe adverse
      events reported. CONCLUSIONS: Buprenorphine is effective for short-term
      ambulatory heroin withdrawal, with greater retention, less heroin use and less
      withdrawal discomfort during withdrawal; and increased postwithdrawal treatment
      retention than symptomatic medications.

TI  - Gabapentin in neuropathic pain syndromes: a randomised, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 557-66
AB  - A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled 8-week study was conducted to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of gabapentin in the treatment of neuropathic
      pain, using doses up to 2400 mg/day. The study used a novel design that was
      symptom- rather than syndrome-based; an approach that aimed to reflect the
      realities of clinical practice. Participants had a wide range of neuropathic pain
      syndromes, with at least two of the following symptoms: allodynia, burning pain, 
      shooting pain, or hyperalgesia. Patients were randomised to gabapentin (n=153) or
      placebo (n=152). Gabapentin was given in three divided doses, initially titrated 
      to 900 mg/day over 3 days, followed by two further increases, to a maximum of
      2400 mg/day if required by the end of week 5. The primary outcome measure was
      changed in average daily pain diary score (baseline versus final week). Over the 
      8 week study, this score decreased (i.e. improved) by 1.5 (21%) in gabapentin
      treated patients and by 1.0 (14%) in placebo treated patients (P=0.048,
      rank-based analysis of covariance). Significant differences were shown in favour 
      of gabapentin (P<0.05) for the Clinician and Patient Global Impression of Change,
      and some domains of the Short Form-McGill Pain Questionnaire. Improvements were
      also shown in patient-reported outcomes in quality of life, as seen by
      significant differences in favour of gabapentin in several domains of the
      Short-Form-36 Health Survey. Gabapentin was well tolerated and the majority of
      patients completed the study (79 versus 73% for placebo). The most common adverse
      events were mild to moderate dizziness and somnolence, most of which were
      transient and occurred during the titration phase. This study shows that
      gabapentin reduces pain and improves some quality-of-life measures in patients
      with a wide range of neuropathic pain syndromes.

      symptoms. All patients demonstrated side effects which limited the targeted dose.
      It is suggested that the subtle positive effect of naltrexone and the
      hypersensitivity of these patients to its side effects do not encourage the use
      of naltrexone in the treatment of PTSD patients.

TI  - Tianeptine and fluoxetine in major depression: a 6-week randomised double-blind
      study.
PG  - 299-303
AB  - In a 6-week, multicentre, randomised, double-blind controlled study, tianeptine
      (37.5 mg/day) and fluoxetine (20 mg/day) were compared for efficacy and safety in
      178 patients with major depression. No significant difference was shown between
      the two drugs, either in terms of efficacy (MADRS, CGI, COVI) or in terms of
      safety, except for the CGI 'severity of illness' which was lower at the end point
      with tianeptine than with fluoxetine. The percentages of responders (as defined
      by a 50% decrease of the MADRS score from baseline to end point) were 75% with
      tianeptine and 67% with fluoxetine, showing the efficacy of both drugs. In
      conclusion, both tianeptine and fluoxetine are effective and well-tolerated
      treatments for major depression.

TI  - Acute effects of baclofen, a gamma-aminobutyric acid-B agonist, on laboratory
      measures of aggressive and escape responses of adult male parolees with and
      without a history of conduct disorder.
PG  - 160-7
AB  - RATIONALE: The possible role of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in human
      aggression was evaluated by administering baclofen, a GABA-B agonist and
      comparing the effects on laboratory measures of aggression and escape among
      subjects with and without a history of conduct disorder. METHODS: Twenty male
      subjects with a history of criminal behavior participated in experimental
      sessions, which measured aggressive and escape responses. Ten subjects had a
      history of childhood conduct disorder (CD+) and ten control subjects had no
      history of CD. Aggression was measured using the point subtraction aggression
      paradigm (PSAP), which provides subjects with aggressive, escape, and
      monetary-reinforced response options. RESULTS: Acute doses (0.07, 0.14 and 0.28
      mg/kg) of baclofen had remarkably different effects on aggressive responses among
      CD+ subjects relative to control subjects. Aggressive responses of CD+ subjects
      decreased, while aggressive responses of control subjects increased following
      baclofen administration. Baclofen decreased escape responses for both CD+ and
      control subjects. No changes in monetary-reinforced responses were observed,
      indicative of no central nervous system stimulation or sedation. CONCLUSIONS: The
      GABA-B agonist baclofen suppressed aggressive responses in subjects with a
      history of childhood CD, while producing the opposite effect in control subjects.
      These suggest a possible unique role for GABA in the regulation of aggression in 
      CD+ population.

AB  - IMPLICATIONS: The authors describe an unusual case of central pain (CP) that
      resulted from giant venous hemangiomas. The patient was treated with a variety of
      medications, including the N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist dextromethorphan. We
      report the first known association between venous malformations and CP and
      briefly describe why the use of dextromethorphan in this disorder requires
      further evaluation.

TI  - Central pain: an overview.
PG  - 97-103
AB  - Central pain is a particular form of neuropathic pain. Due to lesions in the
      spinothalamocortical pathways, ectopic neuronal discharges can occur into
      different neurons of the spinal cord and brain. Functional MRI, and positron
      emission tomography might be able to visualize ongoing pain activity which is,
      sometimes the consequence of spinothalamocortical lesions. Sometimes the patient 
      experiences a burning ice-like sensation. This is more frequent in spinal cord
      lesions than in brain injuries. Some adrenergic, gabergic neurotransmitters,
      glycine, prostanoids and glutamate may play a role in pain transmission. These
      transmitters can induce changes in the neuronal membrane potential. Consequently,
      amitriptyline as an adrenergic reuptake inhibitor and the sodium channel blockers
      are the drugs of first-choice. A test procedure with placebo, opioids,
      lignocaine, propofol and ketamine might give some insight into advanced drug
      treatment. If oral or transdermal drug delivery is not indicated or ineffective, 
      the intrathecal administration route can be attempted with baclofen, clonidine,
      opioids and midazolam. Invasive electrostimulation is the last treatment option. 
      Thalamic stimulation can be tried in spinal cord injuries, and sensory motor
      cortex stimulation is sometimes the last resort for brain lesions associated with
      pain.

TI  - Gabapentin and lamotrigine in Indian patients of partial epilepsy refractory to
      carbamazepine.
PG  - 359-63
AB  - 52 patients (25 males and 27 females) suffering from refrectory partial seizures,
      of not more than two years duration and on carbamazepine monotherapy were
      enrolled in this study. Patients were randomly put on gabapentin (19 males and 8 
      females) or lamotrigine (6 males and 19 females) as add on therapy. The efficacy 
      of the drugs was assessed by the seizure frequency, pattern of seizures and
      seizure free interval. The safety was evaluated from the biochemical
      investigations and the adverse effects observed or reported by the patients
      during the course of the study. The average frequency of basal partial seizures
      was 6.26+3.86 and 5.04+2.47 which decreased significantly (p<. 001) after 12
      weeks of add on therapy to 1.75+2.16. and 1.68+2.94 in the GBP and LTG group
      respectively. However, there was no significant difference between the two drugs 
      after 12 weeks of add on therapy. The PCB (primary change in basal seizure
      frequency) values decreased to -72+34.92 and -76.22+29.68 in the GBP and LTG
      group respectively. The difference in these two groups was not significant. The
      responder rate was 77.7% and 92% respectively in GBP and LTG group respectively. 
      GBP was found to be more effective in partial seizures with secondarily
      generalization while LTG was effective in all subtypes of partial seizures. The
      abnormal scalp EEG was recorded in 33.3% (9 of 27 patients) in GBP group and 40
      %( 10 of 25 patients) in LTG group and it did not revert to normal in 33.3% and
      40% of patients in either of groups (GBP/LTG). Minor side effects which were self
      limiting were noticed in 80% in groups I and 74% were groups II.

TI  - Melatonin as adjunctive therapy in the prophylaxis of cluster headache: a pilot
      study.
PG  - 787-92
AB  - BACKGROUND: The periodicity of cluster headache suggests involvement of the
      suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, the biological clock. The secretion 
      of melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland and regulated by the
      suprachiasmatic nucleus, is altered in patients with cluster headache. Melatonin 
      shifts circadian rhythms. A previous study of melatonin for primary prophylaxis
      of cluster headache demonstrated a 50% response rate. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the 
      use of melatonin as adjunctive therapy in patients with cluster headache who have
      incomplete relief of their headaches on conventional therapy. METHODS: Nine
      patients participated in the study, six with chronic cluster headache and three
      with episodic cluster headache. Patients with chronic cluster headache completed 
      a baseline diary for 1 month, followed by 1 month of melatonin treatment, then 1 
      month of placebo. Patients with episodic cluster headache received placebo for 1 
      month, then melatonin for 1 month. Patients continued their usual prophylactic
      and abortive treatments during the study. Headache frequency, intensity, and use 
      of analgesics were recorded. The primary endpoint of the study was the mean
      number of headaches per day, with mean daily analgesic consumption and percentage
      of mild, moderate, and severe headaches as secondary endpoints. RESULTS: There
      were no significant differences between means on analysis of variance and t
      testing for the melatonin, placebo, and baseline months for all primary and
      secondary endpoints. There were no side effects reported. CONCLUSIONS: Patients
      with chronic cluster headache or patients with episodic cluster headache whose
      headaches are uncontrolled on conventional therapy do not appear to gain
      therapeutically from the addition of melatonin to their usual treatment regimens.
      It is perhaps the phase-shifting properties of melatonin that mediate its effect 
      in patients with episodic cluster headache, and it may be necessary to treat from
      the beginning of the cluster bout to reset the circadian pacemaker, thus
      producing a more positive outcome.

TI  - Health resource utilization of the emergency department headache "repeater".
PG  - 747-53
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To document the health resource utilization of patients who repeatedly
      use emergency department services for headache care. BACKGROUND: Patients with
      headache who frequently use emergency department services may differ from
      patients with more typical, episodic migraine. Previous studies of health
      resource utilization have often failed to distinguish the high utilizer as a
      specific subset of the migraine population. DESIGN: Retrospective review of
      urgent care/emergency department charts, clinic charts, and pharmacy rosters.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients who made three or more visits for headache to an
      urgent care/emergency department (UC/ED) facility for headache over a 6-month
      study period were identified and designated as "repeaters" for this study.
      Pharmacy profiles and appointment histories of 52 of the 54 repeaters whose
      records were available were reviewed for the 12 months prior to the study period.
      RESULTS: Over the 6-month study period, 518 patients visited the UC/ED 1004 times
      for primary headache complaints. Fifty-four (10%) repeaters made 502 visits (50% 
      of total visits; mean 9.3, range 3-50). In the 12 months prior to the study
      period, 52 of these repeaters made 1832 visits to the UC/ED or clinic (mean 35.2,
      range 0-178): 1458 (79.6%) were headache related, and 1271 (69.4%) of all visits 
      were to the UC/ED. An estimated 12-month cost for all visits was $183,760.
      Pharmacy rosters showed use of narcotics in 41 of the 52 patients (annual mean
      +/- SD, 613 +/- 670 tablets), benzodiazepines in 30 patients (500 +/- 486
      tablets), and butalbital products in 27 patients (395 +/- 590 tablets). Mean
      daily use of all symptomatic medications combined was 3.9 +/- 3.2 doses/day.
      CONCLUSION: Health resource utilization of emergency department headache
      repeaters is predominantly headache-related acute care. Associated medication
      overuse is frequently present. Efforts to improve care for patients with headache
      will benefit from distinguishing the high utilizer as a subset of the migraine
      population.

TI  - Restless legs syndrome in the older adult: diagnosis and management.
PG  - 741-51
AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is common in the elderly, with an estimated
      prevalence of 10 to 35% in individuals over 65 years of age. RLS is characterised
      by paraesthesias and dysaesthesias of the legs, typically occurring in the
      evening. The symptoms occur at rest and result in motor restlessness; movement
      often temporarily relieves the symptoms. Patients with poorly controlled RLS may 
      develop related problems including insomnia (due to sleep-onset restlessness or
      periodic limb movements or related sleep fragmentation) and depression. RLS can
      be a primary disorder that develops in the young and includes familial cases.
      Secondary RLS occurs in association with iron-deficiency anaemia, uraemia and
      polyneuropathies. Typically, RLS is misdiagnosed or undiagnosed for years. In the
      elderly, both primary and secondary types of the disorder are common. It is
      thought that RLS represents lower CNS levels of, or reduced responsiveness to,
      dopamine. The symptoms improve with dopaminergic therapy. Ergotamine
      dopamine-receptor agonists such as pergolide, and the non-ergotamine
      dopamine-receptor agonists pramipexole and ropinirole, are becoming more commonly
      used to treat RLS. The dopamine precursor levodopa, in combination with
      carbidopa, is another effective therapeutic agent. An advantage of levodopa is
      lower cost than non-ergotamine and ergotamine dopamine-receptor agonists.
      However, the adverse effect of symptom augmentation appears to develop more
      frequently with levodopa than dopamine-receptor agonists; therefore, levodopa may
      currently be used somewhat less often as first-line therapy. Patients with
      painful symptoms may respond favourably to the anticonvulsants gabapentin and
      carbamazepine. Opioids and hypnosedatives are helpful in selected patients;
      however, these agents may have troubling adverse effects in the elderly.
      Correction of iron deficiency improves symptoms in patients with low ferritin
      levels. Lifestyle modification may also be helpful. Therapy is directed at
      symptoms, and most symptomatic patients benefit from treatment. It is important
      to consider RLS in the differential diagnosis of any patient with paraesthesias
      of the limbs.

TI  - The assessment and management of chronic pain in children.
PG  - 737-46
AB  - Chronic pain in children and adolescents is frequently misdiagnosed by
      caregivers. It is not treated until it results in the loss of routine ability and
      function. Chronic pain is often associated with underlying diseases commonly seen
      in childhood, including sickle cell disease, malignancy, rheumatologic disorders,
      inflammatory bowel disease, trauma, and states where there is no identifiable
      etiology. Chronic pain differs from acute pain in that it serves no useful
      function. Untreated or under-treated chronic pain will result in the unnecessary 
      suffering of the patient, disruption of family routine, and cohesiveness and
      restriction of the child's daily activities, thereby increasing long-term
      disability. Accurate and repeated assessment of chronic pain is required for
      therapy to be effective. Assessment of chronic pain in children is difficult due 
      to their developing cognitive abilities. The assessment of childhood pain varies 
      with the child's age, type of pain, situation, and prior painful experiences.
      Assessment tools such as the Varni-Thompson Pediatric Pain Questionnaire and the 
      Visual Analog Scale are helpful for both the patient and physician in helping to 
      identify situations that precipitate pain, to rate the level of pain and
      determine if therapy has been effective. Documentation of pain assessments and
      the effectiveness of interventions in the medical record should be included as a 
      routine part of all patient records. Most caregivers have extensive experience in
      the treatment of acute pain in children but are often not comfortable with the
      management of complicated and chronic pain states. The therapy for chronic pain
      in children is multifactorial. It can include agents from multiple classes of
      pharmacologic agents (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, tricyclic
      antidepressants, and antineuroleptics) nonconventional therapies (acupuncture and
      pressure and aromatherapy), as well as herbal and homeopathic remedies.

TI  - Fabry disease: recent advances in enzyme replacement therapy.
PG  - 1467-76
AB  - Fabry disease is an X-linked inherited disorder of metabolism due to mutations in
      the gene encoding alpha-galactosidase A, a lysosomal enzyme. The enzymatic defect
      leads to the systemic accumulation of incompletely metabolised
      glycosphingolipids, primarily globotriaosylceramide, in plasma and lysosomes
      within various tissues. Inability to prevent the progression of glycosphingolipid
      deposition causes significant morbidity, associated with significant impact on
      quality of life and diminished lifespan from early onset strokes, heart attack
      and progressive renal failure. The disease manifests primarily in hemizygous
      males; however, there is increasing recognition that heterozygous (carrier)
      females may also develop disease-related complications. Indeed, most
      heterozygotes present with cardiac, renal or neurological symptoms, although with
      later-onset and to a lesser extent than is observed in hemizygotes. Until
      recently, medical management was symptomatic, consisting of partial pain relief
      with analgesic drugs (carbamazepin, gabapentin), kidney and vascular protection
      with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, statins and folic acid, whereas
      renal transplantation or dialysis is available for patients experiencing end
      stage renal failure. The ability to produce high doses of alpha-galactosidase A
      has opened the way to preclinical studies, and enzyme replacement therapy has
      recently been validated as a therapeutic agent in clinical trials. Long-term
      safety and efficacy of replacement therapy are currently being investigated.
      Increasing knowledge of the natural history of Fabry disease and greater
      experience with enzyme therapy should enable optimal patient care. The complexity
      and relative rarity of Fabry disease necessitates a multi-disciplinary team
      approach that may be facilitated by a disease registry.

TI  - Tricyclic antidepressants and fibromyalgia: what is the mechanism of action?
PG  - 1437-45
AB  - Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain disorder of which other clinical features, such as
      persistent fatigue and disordered sleep, may be a secondary consequence. The
      initial pharmacological approach to treating the disorder is the management of
      the pain. Tricyclic antidepressants are the most effective drugs in use so far,
      especially when administered in combination with other therapies (e.g., selective
      serotonin re-uptake inhibitors), which suggests modulation of the
      neurotransmitters serotonin and noradrenaline. The effectiveness of amitriptyline
      and related tricyclic antidepressants, however, is consistent with the
      involvement of mechanisms, such as potassium channel modulation and NMDA receptor
      antagonism, in addition to or in place of the modulation of monoamine
      neurotransmitters. Investigation of the importance of each of the pharmacological
      properties of amitriptyline and related molecules in the management of
      fibromyalgia could provide clues for the rational design of new drugs.

TI  - Anticonvulsants in central pain.
PG  - 1411-20
AB  - Treatment of central neuropathic pain (CP) following lesions of the CNS is a
      great challenge to the clinician. Preclinical and clinical studies indicate that 
      neuronal hyperexcitability in damaged areas of the central nervous system plays a
      major role in the development of CP. Anticonvulsants are thought to act by
      increasing gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated inhibition, decreasing abnormal
      neuronal hyperexcitability by modulating sodium and calcium channels or by
      inhibiting excitatory amino acid actions. The resulting inhibition of excess
      neuronal activity is thought to be the basis for the use of anticonvulsants in
      epilepsy as well as neuropathic pain. Both first-generation anticonvulsant drugs 
      (e.g., phenytoin, benzodiazepines, valproate and carbamazepine) and
      second-generation anticonvulsant drugs (e.g., lamotrigine, gabapentin and
      topiramate) are used in CP conditions. However, few randomised controlled trials 
      on the treatment of this condition have been published. Present suggestions for
      anticonvulsant treatment of CP are lamotrigine as the first choice, followed by
      gabapentin or carbamazepine/oxcarbazepine. These compounds are considered as
      effective as the antidepressant amitriptyline.

TI  - Therapeutic potential of kava in the treatment of anxiety disorders.
PG  - 731-43
AB  - Anxiety disorders are among the most common psychiatric disorders that affect all
      age groups of the general population. Currently, the preferred treatment is with 
      pharmacological drugs that have antidepressant or anti-anxiety properties.
      However, these agents have numerous and often serious adverse effects, including 
      sedation, impaired cognition, ataxia, aggression, sexual dysfunction, tolerance
      and dependence. Withdrawal reactions on termination after long-term
      administration are also a major limiting factor in the use of these agents.
      Herbal remedies, including kava (Piper methysticum), have been shown to be
      effective as alternative treatments, at least in mild to moderate cases of
      anxiety. Kava is a social and ceremonial herb from the South Pacific. It is
      available in the west as an over-the-counter preparation. Its biological effects,
      due to a mixture of compounds called kavalactones, are reported to include
      sedative, anxiolytic, antistress, analgesic, local anaesthetic, anticonvulsant
      and neuroprotective properties. The pharmacological properties of kava are
      postulated to include blockade of voltage-gated sodium ion channels, enhanced
      ligand binding to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptors, diminished
      excitatory neurotransmitter release due to calcium ion channel blockade, reduced 
      neuronal reuptake of noradrenaline (norepinephrine), reversible inhibition of
      monoamine oxidase B and suppression of the synthesis of the eicosanoid
      thromboxane A(2), which antagonises GABA(A) receptor function. Clinical studies
      have shown that kava and kavalactones are effective in the treatment of anxiety
      at subclinical and clinical levels, anxiety associated with menopause and anxiety
      due to various medical conditions. Until recently, the adverse effects attributed
      to kava use were considered mild or negligible, except for the occurrence of a
      skin lesion. This disorder, called kava dermopathy, occurs only with prolonged
      use of large amounts of kava and is reversible on reduced intake or cessation.
      Rare cases of interactions have occurred with pharmaceutical drugs that share one
      or more mechanisms of action with the kavalactones. In the past few years, about 
      35 cases of severe liver toxicity associated with kava intake have been reported 
      in Europe and the US. However, a direct causal relationship with kava use has
      been difficult to establish in the majority of the cases, and there is
      insufficient evidence to implicate kava as the responsible agent. Nevertheless,
      until further research clarifies any causality, kava should be used with caution.

TI  - Respiratory failure in tetanus: case report and review of a 25-year experience.
PG  - 1488-92
AB  - The objectives of the study were to describe a novel presentation of tetanus and 
      to review the course of the respiratory component and the treatment and
      management of the disease. A case report is presented with a review of a 25-year 
      experience at Mayo Clinic. We describe the case of a 65-year-old woman who
      presented with persistent hiccups, dyspnea, and pleurisy of 3 days duration that 
      was caused by tetanus from inadequate secondary immunity. She required intubation
      for progressive trismus and laryngospasm-associated respiratory failure. Infusion
      of lorazepam did not control her spasms. Refractory spasms and hiccups resolved
      with fentanyl and cisatracurium therapy. After 3 weeks, the patient was weaned
      from the ventilator with complete recovery. In the past 25 years, nine additional
      patients have presented to Mayo Clinic with acute tetanus. Respiratory failure
      requiring intubation developed in seven patients, and six of the seven intubated 
      patients survived with minimal deficits. The prognosis of tetanus is favorable if
      it is diagnosed promptly and if treatment and supportive measures are begun. To
      our knowledge, this is the first report of a patient with acute tetanus
      presenting with hiccups. This report also confirms the results of previous
      studies that suggested a need for improved immunity in the elderly population.

TI  - Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome).
PG  - 243-7
AB  - The arguments over the nomenclature of the syndrome are reviewed. Ethical
      considerations favour replacing the present eponyms with the title of
      panthothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN), now that more is known 
      about the cause of the condition. The symptoms and signs of the syndrome are
      described, and these can present from infancy to adult life. Dystonia,
      involuntary movements and spasticity are prominent causes of disability. If the
      onset is delayed the presentation can be unusual. Tests that can help in
      diagnosis are reviewed, especially the "eye of the tiger" revealed by magnetic
      resonance imaging scanning. Death usually occurs about 10 years after the onset, 
      but the course may be more prolonged. The findings on autopsy are also
      considered, with the typical findings of iron pigment deposits and axonal
      spheroids. Then the causes are discussed. Once the responsible gene PANK2 had
      been discovered on chromosome 20 it was found that this encoded for pantothenate 
      kinase which is essential for the synthesis of coenzyme A from pantothenate; and 
      this is integral to fatty acid synthesis and energy metabolism. Also this can
      lead to a concentration of cysteine in the basal ganglia, and then to an
      accumulation of iron in these areas. The cysteine-iron complex will result in
      tissue damage by promoting oxidative stress, as in some other neurodegenerative
      diseases. The syndrome of PKAN can therefore be identified as a disorder of
      pantothanate, vitamin B5, metabolism. Infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy is briefly 
      described as there have been suggestions that it is a variety of PKAN, but the
      evidence is in favour of the two diseases being separate entities. There may as
      yet be no specific treatment for this syndrome, but much can be done to help
      these children. Drugs may be needed to control epilepsy, and when dystonia is
      severe it may be possible to alleviate this by medical or surgical means. Also
      there will be other problems needing expert management, such as the provision of 
      alternative means of communication if dysarthria is marked. The hope for the
      future is that now the cause has been found it will be possible to use methods
      such as antioxidative therapy and gene induction procedures.

TI  - Rhombencephalosynapsis: clinical findings and neuroimaging in 9 children.
PG  - 209-14
AB  - Rhombencephalosynapsis is a rare congenital abnormality characterised by dorsal
      fusion of the cerebellar hemispheres, agenesis or hypogenesis of the vermis,
      fusion of dentate nuclei and superior cerebellar peduncles. We describe 9
      children, aged 1.5 to 6 years, with rhombencephalosynapsis. Isolated
      rhombencephalosynapsis was found in 2 patients, hydrocephalus in 3 children and
      another 3 children had ventriculomegaly. Additional supratentorial abnormalities 
      were documented in 5 patients. Clinical findings ranged from mild truncal ataxia 
      and normal cognitive abilities to severe cerebral palsy and mental retardation.
      No correlation between clinical findings and magnetic resonance imaging could be 
      established so far.

TI  - Interaction trial between artemether-lumefantrine (Riamet) and quinine in healthy
      subjects.
PG  - 1147-58
AB  - Forty-two healthy Caucasian subjects were randomized in a double-blind, parallel 
      three-group study (14 subjects per group) to investigate potential
      electrocardiographic and pharmacokinetic interactions between the antimalarials
      artemether-lumefantrine (six-dose regimen of Riamet over 3 days) and quinine (2-h
      intravenous infusion of 10 mg/kg body weight, not exceeding 600 mg in total, 2 h 
      after the last dose of Riamet). The study medications were all safe and well
      tolerated after all treatments. Neither the pharmacokinetics of lumefantrine nor 
      the pharmacokinetics of quinine was influenced by the presence of the other drug.
      Plasma levels of artemether and dihydroartemisinin appeared to be lower following
      the combined treatment Riamet + quinine, but this was not considered to be
      clinically relevant. Riamet alone had no effect on QTc interval. Infusion of
      quinine alone caused a transient prolongation of QTc interval, which was
      consistent with the known cardiotoxicity of quinine, with this effect being
      slightly but significantly greater when quinine was infused after Riamet. It
      would thus appear that the inherent risk of QTc prolongation of IV quinine was
      enhanced by prior administration of Riamet. However, these occasional QTc
      prolongations, which were small in magnitude and not correlated with plasma
      concentrations of any of the compounds, were not considered to be of clinical
      importance. In conclusion, overlapping therapy with artemether-lumefantrine and
      IV quinine in the treatment of patients with complicated or multidrug-resistant
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria may result in a modest increased risk of QTc
      prolongation, but this is far outweighed by the potential therapeutic benefit.

TI  - Massage therapy and frequency of chronic tension headaches.
PG  - 1657-61
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The effect of massage therapy on chronic nonmigraine headache was
      investigated. METHODS: Chronic tension headache sufferers received structured
      massage therapy treatment directed toward neck and shoulder muscles. Headache
      frequency, duration, and intensity were recorded and compared with baseline
      measures. RESULTS: Compared with baseline values, headache frequency was
      significantly reduced within the first week of the massage protocol. The
      reduction of headache frequency continued for the remainder of the study (P
      =.009). The duration of headaches tended to decrease during the massage treatment
      period (P =.058). Headache intensity was unaffected by massage (P =.19).
      CONCLUSIONS: The muscle-specific massage therapy technique used in this study has
      the potential to be a functional, nonpharmacological intervention for reducing
      the incidence of chronic tension headache.

TI  - Three screening batteries to detect cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 382-9
AB  - To compare the sensitivities for detecting cognitive impairment in patients with 
      multiple sclerosis (MS) and administration times of three brief batteries of
      neuropsychological tests, 64 patients with MS completed the Neuropsychological
      Screening Battery for Multiple Sclerosis (NPSBMS), the Screening Examination for 
      Cognitive Impairment (SEFCI), and the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of
      Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). Failure on a particular test was defined as a 
      score below the 5th percentile for healthy controls, and the number of patients
      who failed at least one or two tests (out of four) was determined for each
      battery. Both the SEFCI and the NPSBMS identified significantly more patients
      with impairment than the RBANS, which was no more sensitive than the Mini-Mental 
      State Exam (MMSE). Results were similar at both the one- and two-failed-tests
      criteria, but there were no significant differences between the SEFCI and the
      NPSBMS at either failure criterion. Mean administration time was 22.6 min for the
      SEFCI compared to 31.7 min for the NPSBMS (p < 0.001). Eleven (17%) of the
      patients refused to attempt the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT), one 
      component of the NPSBMS. For screening patents on a single occasion, the SEFCI is
      preferred because its administration time is shorter than the NPSBMS.

TI  - Patients' associations with regard to analgesic drugs and their forms for
      application -- a pilot study.
PG  - 480-5
AB  - Patients' and caregivers' fear of addiction to and concern about side effects of 
      morphine have been found to be among the major barriers to adequate pain relief
      in cancer patients. In contrast, the transdermal administration of opioids by
      means of fentanyl patches does not seem to evoke such fears. In a qualitative
      study, 60 patients in our outpatient pain clinic recorded up to five associations
      with a list of diseases, drugs and administration routes. Cancer and AIDS were
      associated most often with death, followed by suffering, anxiety and
      hopelessness. Migraine was associated predominantly with pain and other physical 
      symptoms. Aspirin was associated less with pain in general than with headache
      and, sometimes, specifically with alcohol or hangover. Morphine was associated
      predominantly with pain and pain relief, but fears of intoxication, abuse and
      addiction and concerns about side effects were frequently named. Major
      differences were evident from the associations with the different routes of
      administration. The word 'pill' was mostly associated with contraception.
      Associations with 'tablets' were more pharmacological in nature, and side effects
      were frequently named. Patches were associated with wounds, cuts, bruises, and
      blisters and with protection. Some associations with patches were related to
      comfort. Injections and infusions were associated with physicians or the hospital
      environment. In conclusion, patients expressed major differences in their
      perceptions of the different drugs and routes of administration. The results may 
      give a first hint that minor cultural differences even between western European
      countries may lead to major differences in prescribing habits and treatment
      regimens.

TI  - Negative allosteric modulation of AMPA-preferring receptors by the selective
      isomer GYKI 53784 (LY303070), a specific non-competitive AMPA antagonist.
PG  - 235-54
AB  - GYKI 53784 or LY303070
      [(-)1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-4,5-dihydro-3-methylcarbamoyl-2
      ,3-benzodiazepine] belongs to a new family of 2,3-benzodiazepine compounds (also 
      called homophtalazines) selective and non-competitive antagonists at
      alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate (AMPA) receptors. These
      compounds include the original GYKI-52466, its more potent derivative GYKI 53655 
      and the active isomer of the latter, GYKI 53784. This review summarizes current
      knowledge of this novel AMPA antagonist: GYKI 53784. GYKI 53784 is the most
      potent of the compounds in the 2,3-benzodiazepine class, blocking AMPA
      receptor-mediated responses. In contrast to the compounds of the quinoxalinedione
      family, that block AMPA as well as kainate receptors, GYKI 53784 does not block
      the activation of kainate receptors. Furthermore, GYKI 53784 does not act at the 
      same receptor site as positive AMPA modulators (i.e., cyclothiazide, BDP-12,
      1-BCP or aniracetam). GYKI 53784 is a powerful neuroprotective agent in both in
      vitro and in vivo models of AMPA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity. In contrast to
      NMDA receptor antagonists, whose favorable clinical actions are compromised by
      important side effects such as the impairment of memory functions, the selective 
      AMPA antagonist, GYKI 53784, may be of potential clinical value, both in acute
      (stroke and trauma) and chronic (Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy) neurological
      disorders.

      Conference (EILAT VI).
PG  - 31-71
AB  - The Sixth Eilat Conference on New Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs) took place in
      Taormina, Sicily, Italy from 7th to 11th April, 2002. Basic scientists, clinical 
      pharmacologists and neurologists from 27 countries attended the conference, whose
      main themes included dose-response relationships with conventional and recent
      AEDs, teratogenic effects of conventional and recent AEDs, update on clinical
      implications of AED metabolism, prevention of epileptogesis, and seizure
      aggravation by AEDs. According to tradition, the central part of the conference
      was devoted to a review of AEDs in development, as well to updates on AEDs, which
      have been marketed in recent years. This article summarizes the information
      presented on drugs in preclinical and clinical development, including carabersat 
      (SB-204269), CGX-1007 (Conantokin-G), pregabalin, retigabine (D-23129),
      safinamide, SPD421 (DP-VPA), SPM 927, talampanel and valrocemide (TV 1901).
      Updates on fosphenytoin, gabapentin, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine,
      tiagabine, topiramate, vigabatrin, zonisamide, new formulations of valproic acid,
      and the antiepileptic vagal stimulator device are also presented.

TI  - Gastroesophageal reflux in children: pathogenesis, prevalence, diagnosis, and
      role of proton pump inhibitors in treatment.
PG  - 673-85
AB  - A substantial percentage of infants, children and adolescents experience
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and its accompanying symptoms, as well as 
      disease complications. The diagnosis of GERD in children is made based upon the
      child's history, and data derived primarily from pH monitoring tests and
      endoscopy. In those children with confirmed reflux disease, the options for
      management parallel those recommended in adult patients, with the first step
      consisting of lifestyle changes. Surgical procedures may also be performed;
      however, these are rarely recommended prior to an adequate course of
      pharmacologic therapy, and appropriate case selection is important. Among the
      current pharmacotherapeutic options available in the US, the prokinetic agents
      and the acid-inhibitory agents (histamine-2 receptor antagonists, proton pump
      inhibitors) are the most widely used. The clinical utility of the prokinetic
      agents has been limited by the recent withdrawal of cisapride from the US
      marketplace and the potential for irreversible central nervous system
      complications with metoclopramide. Numerous clinical studies performed in adults,
      and several studies involving children, have demonstrated that the proton pump
      inhibitors are more effective than the histamine-2 receptor antagonists in the
      relief of GERD symptoms and healing of erosive esophagitis. In children,
      omeprazole and lansoprazole may be administered as the intact oral capsule, or in
      those who are unable or unwilling to swallow, the granule contents of the capsule
      may be mixed with soft foods (e.g. apple sauce) or fruit drinks/liquid dietary
      supplements prior to oral administration with no detrimental effects on
      pharmacokinetics, bioavailability, or pharmacodynamics. Studies performed with
      omeprazole and lansoprazole in children have shown pharmacokinetic parameters
      that closely resemble those observed in adults. In over a decade of use in
      adults, the proton pump inhibitor class of agents has been found to have a good
      safety profile. Studies involving children have also shown these agents to be
      well tolerated. In numerous drug-drug interaction studies performed with these
      two proton pump inhibitors, relatively few clinically significant interactions
      have been observed.

      three patients eclampsia started no earlier than 6, 8 and 11 days postpartum.
      Seizures were preceded by headache, vomiting, visual disturbance or impaired
      level of consciousness. One patient suffered a series of seizures making
      neurointensive care necessary. In another patient the clinical course was
      complicated by an additional Guillain-Barre syndrome. Aside from the typical
      parieto-occipital lesions brain MRI showed cerebellar hyperintensities on T2
      weighted sequences as well as abnormalities on diffusion weighted images in one
      patient. In all patients neurological deficits and MRI findings were reversible.

TI  - Measurement of the effect of a bolus dose of intrathecal baclofen by continuous
      measurement of force under fibreglass casts.
PG  - 1254-62
AB  - Continuous intrathecal administration of baclofen with implanted programmable
      pump systems is recommended in the treatment of severe spasticity of cerebral
      origin. Prior to pump implantation, a baclofen bolus test (BBT) is used to assess
      the effectiveness of intrathecal baclofen using the modified Ashworth Scale (MAS)
      and Penn Spasm Frequency Scales (SFS). The result of a BBT may be difficult to
      interpret in patients with reduced joint mobility caused by contractures. The aim
      of this study was to apply a new spasticity measurement which would quantify and 
      visualise the effect of a BBT in 10 patients with severe cerebral spasticity and 
      contractures. Spasticity was recorded continuously by the measurement of force
      under circular fibreglass casts in 10 knee joint contractures. Force was recorded
      as net-torque by multiplying the force and distance between sensor and joint
      axis, thus allowing inter-individual comparison. MAS, SFS, and two three-hour
      time integrals of net-torque were determined before and after intrathecally
      administered baclofen. No significant changes in MAS (p = 0.1) and SFS (p = 0.07)
      were observed; however, a significant reduction of time integrals of net-torque
      after baclofen administration (p = 0.005) was found. The present study shows that
      the antispastic effect of intrathecally administered BBT can be quantitatively
      assessed and visualised using the described method. It also suggests that this
      method can be helpful in the assessment of the effectiveness of the BBT in
      patients with severe spasticity of cerebral origin and contractures.

TI  - Complete response of a recurrent, multicentric malignant glioma in a patient
      treated with phenylbutyrate.
PG  - 239-42
AB  - Sodium phenylbutyrate is a biological-response modifier that acts as a
      dose-dependent inhibitor of glioma cell proliferation, migration, and
      invasiveness in vitro, possibly by inhibition of urokinase and c-myc pathways.
      Despite its biological activity in vitro, there have not been any prior reports
      of efficacy in the treatment of human malignant gliomas. We report a 44-year-old 
      female with a recurrent, multicentric, malignant glioma who experienced a durable
      remission lasting more than four years. The patient initially presented with
      seizures caused by a biopsy-proven anaplastic astrocytoma of the frontal lobe.
      The patient was treated with radiation therapy and Procarbazine-CCNU-Vincristine 
      (PCV). However, the tumor progressed and extended to the corpus callosum with
      midline shift, refractory to four cycles of continuous 72-h infusion of
      BCNU/Cisplatinum. Additional enhancing lesions appeared in the left frontal and
      left temporal lobes. The patient was started on sodium phenylbutyrate, 18 g daily
      in three divided oral doses, and reduced to 9 g/day and eventually to 4.5 g/day
      to eliminate mild, reversible side effects. Four years later, the patient has a
      KPS functional score of 100%. Phenylbutyrate is a well-tolerated, oral agent that
      shows potential for the treatment of malignant gliomas. Further studies should be
      considered to identify a subset of patients that have tumors sensitive to
      phenylbutyrate, either as a single agent or in combination with radiation therapy
      or other chemotherapeutic agents.

TI  - Post-partum cerebral angiopathy: repetitive TCD, MRI, MRA, and EEG examinations.
PG  - 570-2
AB  - We report of a woman with post-partum cerebral angiopathy (PCA), in whom we
      repetitively performed transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD), MR imaging (MRI),
      and MR angiography (MRA) to evaluate the underlying pathophysiology. A
      31-year-old woman, Gemini pregnant, complained of severe throbbing frontal
      headache four days after an uneventful delivery by Cesarean section. Blurred
      vision occurred eight days after delivery, followed by three generalized
      tonic-clonic seizures. Neurological examination revealed a somnolent woman
      without focal neurological deficits. At the day of the seizures increased flow
      velocities and disturbed flow were observed in the right posterior and anterior
      cerebral artery on transcranial Doppler (TCD). MRI showed infra- and
      supratentorial patchy hyperintensities in T2-weighted images and in the FLAIR
      sequence. Diffusion-weighted imaging revealed corresponding multi-focal
      hyperintense areas indicating increased diffusion and MRA showed a diffuse
      multisegmental narrowing of all pial arteries. MRI at day 10 was completely
      normal, but MRA still revealed vascular narrowing in the right posterior cerebral
      artery. General slight flow accelerations in all basal arteries occurred after 10
      days and lasted for three weeks. PCA is apparently associated with a vascular
      narrowing causing cerebral ischemia with increased diffusion. Later reactive
      cerebral hyperperfusion is observed. Vascular narrowing and cerebral
      hyperperfusion still persist after MRI has normalized.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness comparison of tizanidine and baclofen in the management of
      spasticity.
PG  - 827-37
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Baclofen and tizanidine are both used for the treatment of muscle
      spasticity of spinal origin. Their effectiveness, cost and adverse-effect
      profiles differ. This paper sets out to estimate the cost effectiveness of each
      drug, and the impact of changing from baclofen to tizanidine. DESIGN: A
      simplified but realistic model of physician behaviour and patient response was
      developed as a decision tree and populated with data derived from the available
      published clinical comparative trials. We considered patients with spasticity
      caused by multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury. The outcome measure used was 
      'cost per successfully treated day' (STD). Costs were estimated from the
      perspective of the UK National Health Service at 2000 values. RESULTS: Expected
      cost for a cohort of 100 patients over 1 year was estimated to be pound 181 545
      with baclofen and pound 211 930 with tizanidine. The estimated number of STDs was
      20,192 with tizanidine and 17,289 with baclofen. The overall cost effectiveness
      of managing spasticity using baclofen and tizanidine was very similar ( pound
      10.50 and pound 10.49 per STD respectively). The incremental cost effectiveness
      (ICE) of using tinzanidine as an alternative to baclofen for first-line treatment
      was pound 10.47 per STD. Sensitivity analysis found the model to be robust to
      changes in key parameters CONCLUSION: Drug cost should not be a determining
      factor in making this treatment choice, as the cost effectiveness ratios are
      similar for both products.

AB  - Gabapentin (GBP, CAS 60142-96-3) has anticonvulsant and antinociceptive
      properties; the latter relate especially to chronic neuropathic pain. The mode of
      action of GBP, possibly different in epilepsy and chronic pain syndromes, is only
      poorly understood. This minireview is aimed at compiling the different mechanisms
      by which GBP may diminish the nociceptive transmission in the dorsal horn of the 
      spinal cord.

TI  - Pharmacologic options for the management of multiple sclerosis symptoms.
PG  - 223-31
AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease with a wide-ranging impact on physical
      functioning. Although pharmacotherapy plays an indispensable role in the
      management of MS symptoms, optimal disease management requires a
      multidisciplinary approach that combines medication, rehabilitation, and patient 
      education. Successful control of symptoms is critical to quality of life for MS
      patients. Immunomodulating drugs provide a means of controlling the underlying
      disease process, but they are not a cure. This places responsibility on health
      care providers to control a patient's MS-related symptoms to limit disability and
      delay impairment in the activities of daily living. Owing to the importance of
      symptom control, comprehensive patient evaluations should be performed at regular
      intervals to determine the extent of neurological damage and disease progression 
      and to address changing patient needs. The goal of interventions should be not
      only to treat the primary and secondary symptoms of MS but also to provide access
      to the psychosocial support that will help MS patients and their families
      continue to cope as disease status changes.

TI  - Migraine: preventive treatment.
PG  - 491-512
AB  - Migraine is a common episodic headache disorder. A comprehensive headache
      treatment plan includes acute attack treatment to relieve pain and impairment and
      long-term preventive therapy to reduce attack frequency, severity, and duration. 
      Circumstances that might warrant preventive treatment include: (i) migraine that 
      significantly interferes with the patient's daily routine despite acute
      treatment; (ii) failure, contraindication to, or troublesome side-effects from
      acute medications; (iii) overuse of acute medications; (iv) special
      circumstances, such as hemiplegic migraine; (v) very frequent headaches (more
      than two a week); or (vi) patient preference. Start the drug at a low dose. Give 
      each treatment an adequate trial. Avoid interfering, overused, and
      contraindicated drugs. Re-evaluate therapy. Be sure that a woman of childbearing 
      potential is aware of any potential risks. Involve patients in their care to
      maximize compliance. Consider co-morbidity. Choose a drug based on its proven
      efficacy, the patient's preferences and headache profile, the drug's
      side-effects, and the presence or absence of coexisting or co-morbid disease.
      Drugs that have documented high efficacy and mild to moderate adverse events
      (AEs) include beta-blockers, amitriptyline, and divalproex. Drugs that have lower
      documented efficacy and mild to moderate AEs include selective serotonin reuptake
      inhibitors (SSRIs), calcium channel antagonists, gabapentin, topiramate,
      riboflavin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

AB  - Lesions of the spinal cord causing paroxysmal kinesigenic choreoathetosis are
      rare and most of the reported cases have been because of multiple sclerosis. We
      now describe this movement disorder occurring in a patient who developed a
      myelitis of unknown aetiology. A typically striking remission followed treatment 
      with carbamazepine. It is suggested that the effect of the drug and the disorder 
      itself may both be explained on the basis of altered sodium channels.

TI  - Sex hormones and chronic headache in women.
PG  - 1839-48
AB  - Women experience changes in headache pattern in relation to changes in their
      reproductive cycles. Menarche, menses, pregnancy, menopause and the use of
      exogenous oestrogen-containing medications frequently alter baseline headache
      patterns. Changing patterns of headache in women may be linked to alterations in 
      levels of sex hormones. Sex hormones directly influence headache by affecting the
      activity of a variety of neurochemicals important for headache, including
      serotonin (5HT). Treating headache alterations in women may include therapies
      that modify sex hormones or neurochemicals.

TI  - A randomized study of the effects of single-dose gabapentin versus placebo on
      postoperative pain and morphine consumption after mastectomy.
PG  - 560-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: The anticonvulsant gabapentin has proven effective for neuropathic
      pain in three large placebo-controlled clinical trials. Experimental and clinical
      studies have demonstrated antihyperalgesic effects in models involving central
      neuronal sensitization. It has been suggested that central neuronal sensitization
      may play an important role in postoperative pain. The aim of the study was to
      investigate the effect of gabapentin on morphine consumption and postoperative
      pain in patients undergoing radical mastectomy. METHODS: In a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 70 patients received a single dose of
      oral gabapentin (1,200 mg) or placebo 1 h before surgery. Patients received
      patient-controlled analgesia with morphine at doses of 2.5 mg with a lock-out
      time of 10 min for 4 h postoperatively. Pain was assessed on a visual analog
      scale at rest and during movement, and side effects were assessed on a four-point
      verbal scale 2 and 4 h postoperatively. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients in the
      gabapentin group and 34 patients in the placebo group completed the study.
      Gabapentin reduced total morphine consumption from a median of 29 (interquartile 
      range, 21-33) to 15 (10-19) mg (P< 0.0001). Pain during movement was reduced from
      41 (31-59) to 22 (10-38) mm at 2 h postoperatively (P < 0.0001) and from 31
      (12-40) to 9 (3-34) mm at 4 h postoperatively (P = 0.018). No significant
      differences between groups were observed with regard to pain at rest or side
      effects. CONCLUSION: A single dose of 1,200 mg oral gabapentin resulted in a
      substantial reduction in postoperative morphine consumption and movement-related 
      pain after radical mastectomy, without significant side effects. These promising 
      results should be validated in other acute pain models involving central neuronal
      sensitization.

TI  - The impact of intrathecal baclofen on gastrointestinal function.
PG  - 825-36
AB  - Intrathecal baclofen (ITB) application has become the first choice in the
      management of otherwise intractable generalized spasticity. The mechanism whereby
      ITB alleviates increased skeletal muscle tone is generally accepted; however,
      less is known about its effect on smooth muscles. The authors present two
      patients who developed a paralytic ileus during ITB infusion for supraspinal
      spasticity. In addition, they performed a retrospective chart analysis of another
      12 patients receiving ITB with respect to their intestinal function. They
      calculated the cumulative sum of days without bowel movements plus the cumulative
      sum of interventions intended to promote intestinal peristalsis before and during
      ITB treatment. Intestinal function deteriorated in 10, remained unchanged in one,
      and improved in three patients compared to baseline, irrespective of concomitant 
      oral baclofen medication. This is the first study addressing a previously
      unnoticed, but potentially deleterious side effect of ITB treatment. The findings
      suggest, however, that close observation of intestinal activity in conjunction
      with the generous use of prokinetic, laxantic or eubiotic drugs may allow for
      continuation of ITB treatment, even in particularly sensitive patients.

TI  - Effects of low power laser and low dose amitriptyline therapy on clinical
      symptoms and quality of life in fibromyalgia: a single-blind, placebo-controlled 
      trial.
PG  - 188-93
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of low power laser
      (LPL) and low-dose amitriptyline therapy and to investigate effects of these
      therapy modalities on clinical symptoms and quality of life (QOL) in patients
      with fibromyalgia (FM). Seventy-five patients with FM were randomly allocated to 
      active gallium-arsenide (Ga-As) laser (25 patients), placebo laser (25 patients),
      and amitriptyline therapy (25 patients). All groups were evaluated for the
      improvement in pain, number of tender points, skin fold tenderness, morning
      stiffness, sleep disturbance, muscular spasm, and fatigue. Depression was
      evaluated by a psychiatrist according to the Hamilton Depression Rate Scale and
      DSM IV criteria. Quality of life of the FM patients was assessed according to the
      Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ). In the laser group, patients were
      treated for 3 min at each tender point daily for 2 weeks, except weekends, at
      each point with approximately 2 J/cm(2) using a Ga-As laser. The same unit was
      used for the placebo treatment, for which no laser beam was emitted. Patients in 
      the amitriptyline group took 10 mg daily at bedtime throughout the 8 weeks.
      Significant improvements were indicated in all clinical parameters in the laser
      group (P = 0.001) and significant improvements were indicated in all clinical
      parameters except fatigue in the amitriptyline group (P = 0.000), whereas
      significant improvements were indicated in pain (P = 0.000), tender point number 
      (P = 0.001), muscle spasm (P = 0.000), morning stiffness (P = 0.002), and FIQ
      score (P = 0.042) in the placebo group. A significant difference was observed in 
      clinical parameters such as pain intensity (P = 0.000) and fatigue (P = 0.000) in
      favor of the laser group over the other groups, and a significant difference was 
      observed in morning stiffness (P = 0.001), FIQ (P = 0.003), and depression score 
      (P = 0.000) after therapy. A significant difference was observed in morning
      stiffness (P = 0.001), FIQ (P = 0.003), and depression (P = 0.000) in the
      amitriptyline group compared to the placebo group after therapy. Additionally, a 
      significant difference was observed in depression score (P = 0.000) in the
      amitriptyline group in comparison to the laser group after therapy. Our study
      suggests that both amitriptyline and laser therapies are effective on clinical
      symptoms and QOL in fibromyalgia and that Ga-As laser therapy is a safe and
      effective treatment in cases with FM. Additionally, the present study suggests
      that the Ga-As laser therapy can be used as a monotherapy or as a supplementary
      treatment to other therapeutic procedures in FM.

TI  - Risperidone in the treatment of mania: efficacy and safety results from a large, 
      multicentre, open study in Spain.
PG  - 15-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: A number of open studies and preliminary results of unpublished
      double-blind trials have suggested that the novel antipsychotic risperidone may
      be effective and well tolerated in the treatment of acute mania in bipolar
      disorder. METHODS: A total of 174 patients entered this large, open, multicentre 
      trial. Inclusion criteria were: current manic, hypomanic or mixed episode
      (DSM-IV), and a Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) score of >7. Assessments included
      the YMRS, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Hamilton Rating Scale for
      Depression (HAM-D), Clinical Global Impression (CGI), and Udvalg for Kliniske
      Undersogelser (UKU) subscale for neurological side effects. RESULTS: There were
      significant reductions (P<0.0001) on the YMRS, PANSS and HAM-D scores and a
      significant improvement (P<0.0001) in CGI ratings at the endpoint. There were no 
      statistically significant increments in the severity of extrapyramidal symptoms
      according to the UKU. Risperidone was generally well tolerated. The mean dose of 
      risperidone at the endpoint was 4.9+/-2.9 mg/day. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL
      IMPLICATIONS: This open study provides further evidence that risperidone is safe 
      and effective in combination with mood stabilisers in the manic phase of bipolar 
      disorder. LIMITATIONS: The open design and the use of concomitant medications
      make unclear to what extent the positive results were entirely related to
      risperidone.

TI  - Gabapentin versus lamotrigine monotherapy: a double-blind comparison in newly
      diagnosed epilepsy.
PG  - 993-1000
AB  - PURPOSE: This randomised, double-blind study compared the newer antiepileptic
      drugs (AEDs) gabapentin (GBP) and lamotrigine (LTG) as monotherapy in newly
      diagnosed epilepsy. METHODS: Patients with partial seizures with and/or without
      secondary generalization or primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures were
      randomized to either GBP or LTG. During 2- and 6-week titration periods,
      respectively, GBP dosage reached 1,800 mg/day, and LTG, 150 mg/day. In the
      subsequent 24-week maintenance phase, the dose could be adjusted based on seizure
      control or adverse events between 1,200 and 3,600 mg/day for GBP and 100 and 300 
      mg/day for LTG. The primary end point was time to exit, a composite of efficacy
      and tolerability. Evaluable patients were used for the primary efficacy analysis,
      whereas tolerability was examined on an intent-to-treat basis. RESULTS: A total
      of 309 patients was randomized, and 291 (148 GBP, 143 LTG) were included in the
      evaluable population. Nineteen patients in each group had an exit event. The
      median time to exit was 69 days for GBP and 48 days for LTG. The hazard ratio was
      estimated as 1.043 (90% confidence intervals, 0.602-1.809). Overall, 106 (71.6%
      of the evaluable population) GBP-treated and 96 (67.1%) LTG-treated patients
      completed the study. Of those, 80 (75.5%) patients taking GBP and 73 (76.0%)
      taking LTG remained seizure free during the final 12 weeks of treatment. Only 14 
      (8.9%) GBP-treated patients and 15 (9.9%) LTG-treated patients withdrew because
      of study drug-related adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: GBP and LTG monotherapy were
      similarly effective and well tolerated in patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy.

TI  - A postmarketing surveillance study of gabapentin as add-on therapy for 3,100
      patients in England.
PG  - 983-92
AB  - PURPOSE: Our aim was to monitor the use of gabapentin (GBP) by patients
      prescribed this drug by primary care physicians in England soon after it was
      marketed in the United Kingdom. METHODS: A noninterventional observational cohort
      study was conducted by using the technique of prescription-event monitoring.
      Patients were identified from dispensed National Health Service prescriptions.
      Outcome data were obtained from questionnaires sent to the doctor approximately 6
      months after the initial prescription. These data included demographic
      information, events reported since starting GBP, and reason for stopping the
      drug, if it was stopped. Incidence rates were calculated for given periods for
      all events reported. Additional information was requested for selected events of 
      medical interest, including pregnancies. Standardised mortality ratio (SMR) was
      calculated. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 3,100 patients, of whom 136 (4%) were
      children. The median duration of treatment was 8.1 months. The most frequently
      reported adverse events reported during the first month of treatment,
      drowsiness/sedation, dizziness, and malaise/lassitude, also were the commonest
      reasons for discontinuing GBP and reported as suspected adverse drug reactions
      (ADRs). There were no congenital anomalies in the 11 babies born to women who
      used GBP during the first trimester of pregnancy. Crude mortality rate was 5
      times that in general population but similar to that in other published studies. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Neurologic-related events were the most frequently reported adverse 
      events. They also were the commonest reasons for discontinuing treatment and
      reported as suspected ADRs. No previously unrecognised adverse events were
      detected in this large cohort of patients who were among the first treated with
      gabapentin in England.

TI  - Lamotrigine as an augmentation agent in treatment-resistant depression.
PG  - 737-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: The anticonvulsant lamotrigine has been reported to be efficacious
      and well tolerated as monotherapy in the treatment of bipolar patients as well as
      in treatment-refractory bipolar disorder. However, there is a paucity of research
      on the use of lamotrigine as an augmentation agent in treatment-refractory
      unipolar major depressive disorder. METHOD: This study was a retrospective chart 
      review on the efficacy of lamotrigine augmentation in 37 individuals diagnosed
      with chronic or recurrent major depressive disorder (DSM-IV) who had failed to
      respond adequately to at least 2 previous trials of antidepressants. Thirty-one
      patients who were on lamotrigine treatment for at least 6 weeks (6 discontinued
      prematurely due to adverse events) took a mean dose of 112.90 mg/day for a mean
      of 41.80 weeks. The primary efficacy parameter for this study was the Clinical
      Global Impressions scale, which was retrospectively applied. In addition, these
      data were supplemented by an analysis of prospectively rated Global Assessment of
      Functioning scores. RESULTS: On the basis of intent-to-treat analysis, response
      rates were as follows: 40.5% (15/37) much improved or very much improved, 21.6%
      (8/37) mildly improved, and 37.8% (14/37) unchanged. The percentage of patients
      who were rated much or very much improved and completed 6 weeks on the drug was
      48.4% (15/31). No differences were found in the doses of lamotrigine given to
      responders and nonresponders. CONCLUSION: Analyses revealed that lamotrigine
      treatment was most effective for patients who had been depressed for shorter
      periods of time and had failed fewer previous trials of antidepressants. Data
      also suggested a trend toward increased response for patients with comorbid
      anxiety disorders and/or chronic pain syndromes.

TI  - Clonidine-induced hypertension in a patient with a spinal lesion.
PG  - 1396-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report a case of possible clonidine-induced hypertension (by
      Naranjo score) in a patient with a C4 spinal lesion. BACKGROUND: Clonidine is a
      medication long used to treat hypertension, and it is still used in the treatment
      of refractory hypertension. Although effective, clonidine use is hindered by
      adverse effects and its dual mechanism of action. CASE SUMMARY: A 39-year-old
      white, quadriplegic man with poorly controlled pain displayed many
      characteristics consistent with autonomic dysfunction (e.g., C4 spinal lesion,
      orthostatic hypotension, hypertension). The patient was routinely receiving
      transdermal clonidine and also received transdermal nitroglycerin paste as needed
      for control of acute hypertensive episodes. On the recommendation of the home
      healthcare pharmacists, clonidine was discontinued. Since that time, the
      patient's blood pressure and the use of emergent antihypertensive treatment have 
      decreased significantly (maximum systolic and diastolic BP by approximately 50
      and 25 mm Hg, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Many of the characteristics of
      autonomic dysfunction, such as refractory hypertension, can seem selective for
      the use of clonidine and, because of its reliance on central alpha(2)-activity
      for its hypotensive effects, clonidine may induce hypertension in patients with
      autonomic dysfunction. Clonidine should be used with great caution when autonomic
      dysfunction is suspected.

TI  - Dramatic recovery of paclitaxel-disabling neurosensory toxicity following
      treatment with venlafaxine.
PG  - 777-80
AB  - Venlafaxine is an antidepressant which acts through the inhibition of the
      reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin. Venlafaxine is active against
      neuropathic and chronic pain. We report the case of a 69-year-old woman who
      presented a paclitaxel-induced neuropathy. She presented paresthesias, pin pricks
      in both hands with functional impairment. Venlafaxine hydrochloride was
      introduced at 37.5 mg twice daily. The patient noticed a dramatic recovery of her
      symptoms within 2 days, with both reduction of the paresthesias and functional
      improvement. This is the first report of efficacious use of venlafaxine for the
      treatment of paclitaxel cumulative neurosensory toxicity.

TI  - The clinical development of the bryostatins.
PG  - 673-83
AB  - The bryostatins are a group of novel macrocyclic lactones derived from the marine
      bryozoan, Bugula neritina. In vitro evidence indicates that their main mechanism 
      of action is modulation of protein kinase C (PKC) activity. Phase I studies
      suggested significant antineoplastic activity against several tumor types and
      defined the main dose-limiting toxicity as myalgia. Bryostatin-1 has subsequently
      been investigated extensively in phase II clinical trials as a single agent,
      although trial design has been hampered by lack of human pharmacokinetic data.
      Results have been generally disappointing but in vitro and animal data suggests
      an important role for bryostatin-1 in combination with cytotoxic agents.
      Preliminary results of phase I studies support these observations but further
      work needs to be done to define the future role of the bryostatins in the clinic.

TI  - Benzodiazepine behavioral side effects: review and implications for individuals
      with mental retardation.
PG  - 376-410
AB  - Behavioral side effects associated with benzodiazepines (such as clonazepam,
      diazepam, and lorazepam) are an easily overlooked and underrecognized problem
      with individuals who have mental retardation and can be inadvertently confused
      with other behavioral or psychiatric conditions. Based upon a literature review, 
      behavioral side effects occurred for 13.0% of 446 individuals with mental
      retardation who were prescribed benzodiazepines for either behavioral or
      psychiatric conditions (n = 138, 17.4%), epilepsy (n = 208, 15.4%), or other
      medical conditions such as myoclonus or cerebral palsy (n = 100, 2.0%).
      Behavioral side effects for individual benzodiazepines for which data were
      available ranged from 11.4% to 25.0%. Implications of nonrecognition are
      discussed, and clinical indicators suggesting review by appropriate medical
      personnel are provided.

TI  - Tolerability of hypnosedatives in older patients.
PG  - 529-39
AB  - Sleep disturbances are common and prevalence rates increase with age. Especially 
      in the elderly, somatic diseases and medications with adverse effects relating to
      sleep are frequent reasons for disturbed and nonrefreshing sleep. It should be
      emphasised that these reasons must be excluded before symptomatic therapy is
      started. In some cases the use of hypnosedatives may be included as part of the
      treatment of a somatic disease and may cause sleep disturbances. Pharmacotherapy 
      is one of the main approaches in the management of primary insomnia and should be
      part of a broader treatment strategy including nonpharmacological methods. This
      article focuses on the tolerability of frequently prescribed hypnosedatives in
      the elderly with primary insomnia and addresses the primary care physician. In
      general, recommendations for the pharmacotherapy of insomnia in elderly patients 
      include using a reduced dosage. For some substances (e.g. zolpidem, zopiclone,
      zaleplon, temazepam and triazolam) the recommended dosage is half that
      recommended for younger patients. The properties of the selected hypnosedative
      should be taken into consideration and matched with the type of sleep disturbance
      experienced by the patient. Ultrashort-acting drugs may be useful when initiating
      sleep is the main problem, whereas short- and intermediate-acting substances are 
      recommended for maintaining sleep. Possible interactions with pre-existing
      medication must also be taken into consideration. Some agents such as
      antipsychotics, antidepressants, melatonin and herbal agents may be used in
      specific indications. However, only a few of these substances have proven
      tolerability in the elderly and further investigations are recommended.

TI  - Aging and intestinal motility: a review of factors that affect intestinal
      motility in the aged.
PG  - 515-27
AB  - Normal aging is associated with significant changes in the function of most
      organs and tissues. In this regard, the gastrointestinal tract is no exception.
      The purpose of this review is to detail the important age-related changes in
      motor function of the various parts of the gastrointestinal tract and to
      highlight some of the important motility changes that may occur, either in
      relation to common age-related disorders, or as a result of certain drugs
      commonly prescribed in the aged. A major confounding factor in the interpretation
      of motor phenomena throughout the gastrointestinal tract in this age group is the
      frequent coexistence of neurological, endocrinological and other disease states, 
      which may be independently associated with dysmotility. Overall, current data are
      insufficient to implicate normal aging as a cause of dysmotility in the elderly. 
      Normal aging is associated with various changes in gastrointestinal motility, but
      the clinical significance of such changes remains unclear. More important is the 
      impact of various age-related diseases on gastrointestinal motility in the
      elderly: for example, long-standing diabetes mellitus may reduce gastric emptying
      in up to 50% of patients; depression significantly prolongs whole-gut transit
      time; hypothyroidism may prolong oro-caecal transit time; and chronic renal
      failure is associated with impaired gastric emptying. In addition, various,
      frequently used drugs in the elderly cause disordered gastrointestinal motility. 
      These drugs include anticholinergics, especially antidepressants with an
      anticholinergic effect, opioid analgesics and calcium antagonists.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To implement and evaluate a collaborative medication management
      service model. DESIGN: Participatory action research. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS:
      The study was conducted from March 1999 to March 2000; 1000 patients, 63
      pharmacists and 129 general practitioners from six Divisions of General Practice 
      in South Australia participated. INTERVENTIONS: A collaborative service delivery 
      model, involving a preliminary case conference, a home visit and a second case
      conference, was agreed through discussions with medical and pharmacy
      organisations and then implemented. OUTCOME MEASURES: Medication-related
      problems; actions recommended; actions implemented; and outcomes after actions
      taken. RESULTS: Overall, 2764 problems were identified. The most common
      medication-related problem (17.5% of all problems) was the need for additional
      tests. Thirty-seven per cent of problems related to medicine selection, 20% to
      patient knowledge, and 17% to the medication regimen. Of 2764 actions recommended
      to resolve medication-related problems, 42% were implemented. Of the 978 problems
      for which action was taken and follow-up data were available, 81% were reported
      to be "resolved", "well managed" or "improving". CONCLUSION: This implementation 
      model was successful in engaging GPs and pharmacists and in assisting in the
      resolution of medication-related problems.

TI  - The role of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs) in CNS pathophysiology.
PG  - 1411-5
AB  - The peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs) have been identified to bind
      selectively benzodiazepine ligands and an isoquinoline carboxamide derivative PK 
      11195 with high affinity. PBRs are present in the central nervous system (CNS),
      peripheral tissues, and most organs in the human body. PBRs are different from
      the central benzodiazepine receptors (CBRs) related to the nerve cell membrane
      GABA(A) receptor and are thought to play several physiological and
      pathophysiological functions in the CNS and immune system due to their meanly
      localization in glial cells, the mitochondrial outer membrane of peripheral cells
      and blood leucocytes and to their important roles in steroidogenesis, cell
      proliferation and differentiation. Recent research has shown that the density of 
      PBRs is significantly increased in CNS several disorders, such as epilepsy,
      multiple sclerosis, cerebral ischemia, astrocytoma, brain injury and
      neurodegenerative diseases. Recent progress in the pharmacology of PBRs is
      reviewed here with respect to the functions in the brain and peripheral tissues
      including apoptosis, immune system modulation, seizure promotion, reactions of
      anticonvulsants on peripheral blood cells, and adverse drug reactions (ADR) of
      anticonvulsants.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of a novel surface-active agent, purified poloxamer 188, in rat,
      rabbit, dog and man.
PG  - 87-103
AB  - Purified poloxamer 188 (PP188) is a non-ionic, block copolymer surfactant that is
      currently being evaluated clinically in sickle cell disease vaso-occlusive crisis
      and acute chest syndrome and preclinically in spinal cord injury and muscular
      dystrophy. This paper describes the pharmacokinetics of PP188 in rats, pregnant
      rats, pregnant rabbits, dogs and humans. Plasma protein binding interaction
      studies demonstrated no clinically significant effects on narcotic analgesics,
      hydroxyurea, warfarin, diazepam or digitoxin, but an increase in free fraction
      for propranolol. The plasma concentrations increased proportionate with
      increasing dose in all species tested. Renal clearance accounted for 90% of total
      plasma clearance in man. A single metabolite was detected and quantified in the
      plasma from dogs and humans that was cleared more slowly than parent drug.
      Allometric scaling of plasma clearance and volume of distribution at steady-state
      (Vss) across species provided good predictions of the pharmacokinetic parameters 
      in humans. Based on the comparative pharmacokinetics of PP188 in rat, rabbit, dog
      and man, all three animal species were appropriate models for evaluating various 
      aspects of PP188's toxicological profile.

TI  - Continuous intrathecal infusion of baclofen in patients with spasticity caused by
      spinal cord injuries.
PG  - 228-30
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of intrathecal
      baclofen therapy delivered by a programmable pump for the chronic treatment of
      spinal spasticity. Twelve patients with intractable spasticity caused by spinal
      cord injuries underwent implantation of a programmable continuous infusion pump
      after significant reduction in spasticity following an intrathecal test bolus of 
      baclofen. No deaths or new permanent neurological deficits occurred following
      surgery or chronic intrathecal baclofen therapy. The follow-up (12 months) shows 
      a reduction in rigidity in the lower limb of 2.0 points on the Ashworth scale and
      in the upper limb of 1.2 points. Muscle spasms were reduced from a mean
      preoperative score of 2.8 to a mean postoperative score of 1.0. In two cases, we 
      observed postoperative catheter dislocation, a complication which could be
      corrected surgically. This study demonstrates that chronic intrathecal baclofen
      infusion is a safe and effective form of treatment of intractable spasticity in
      patients with spinal cord injury. There is considerable reduction in the risk of 
      infection in view of the fact that interrogation and programming of the implanted
      programmed pumps is noninvasive.

TI  - Central post-stroke pain syndrome: yet another use for gabapentin?
PG  - 718-20
AB  - Although gabapentin was originally developed for treating partial seizures, it
      has been used mainly to treat various peripheral neuropathic pain conditions;
      however, there is very limited experience with gabapentin for the treatment of
      pain conditions of the central nervous system like central post-stroke pain
      syndrome. We report the case of a 45-yr old man with central post-stroke pain
      syndrome who failed to respond to a variety of oral analgesics, but within 2 wk
      of the inception of gabapentin therapy, his average pain was significantly
      reduced and his level of function improved. We conclude that gabapentin may be an
      effective medication for the treatment of central post-stroke pain syndrome.

AB  - Heat waves result in excess deaths, excess emergency department visits, and
      intensive care unit admissions for heat stroke. We describe the clinical features
      and 3-month outcome of a patient with near-fatal heat stroke, admitted to our
      intensive care unit in July, 2001. After heavily working for hours at a
      construction site during a heat wave, the 28-year-old male presented with 41.4
      degrees C body temperature and multiorgan failure, consisting of neurological
      impairment, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, disseminated intravascular
      coagulation, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In the first week
      there was no evidence of infection. Treatment included cooling, aggressive volume
      resuscitation, administration of antithrombin-III concentrates and steroids. The 
      patient survived and recovered normal neurological, renal, respiratory and
      haematological function, and no disability persisted. This case illustrates
      survival and complete recovery after multiorgan failure in heat stroke with
      vigorous intensive care. Treatment with antithrombin and steroids and may well
      have contributed to the favourable outcome. Correction of reduced antithrombin
      III levels to supranormal by therapeutic administration of antithrombin III
      concentrate in disseminated intravascular coagulation of heat stroke was not
      associated with any bleeding complications.

TI  - An open case series on the utility of tiagabine as an augmentation in refractory 
      bipolar outpatients.
PG  - 259-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tiagabine (Gabitril) is a GABA uptake inhibitor recently introduced
      in the United States as an adjunctive treatment for partial complex seizures.
      Three published studies have addressed the use of tiagabine for bipolar disorder 
      (BPD); two described positive results and one negative results. We assessed the
      efficacy of add-on tiagabine in a larger sample of adult BPD outpatients.
      METHODS: Twenty-two adult outpatients with DSM-IV diagnosed BPD of some type who 
      were considered unsatisfactory responders to standard medications for BPD were
      treated in an open fashion with adjunctive tiagabine in a low-dose range. After
      baseline demographic data and mood state at the time of entry were documented,
      each patient was monitored clinically for at least 6 months while the dose of
      tiagabine was adjusted according to the patient's clinical status. The subjects
      were rated using the clinical global impression-bipolar version scale (CGI-BP).
      RESULTS: After 6 months, eight (36%) of the patients were responders to tiagabine
      by CGI-BP rating. The dose range of tiagabine for responders was 1-8 mg per day. 
      All 14 nonresponders had to discontinue tiagabine because of unacceptable but
      reversible side effects; one nonresponder experienced breakthrough absence
      seizures. LIMITATIONS: This study was performed in a nonrandom, open naturalistic
      clinical setting. The sample size was small. CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose tiagabine
      appears to have mood-stabilizing and antimanic properties as an add-on medication
      for some adult outpatients who have BPD refractory to standard medications.
      Tiagabine appears to be safe for most adult BPD outpatients. The results of this 
      preliminary open study await confirmation by double-blind controlled studies.

TI  - Behavioral and pharmacologic treatment of transformed migraine with analgesic
      overuse: outcome at 3 years.
PG  - 483-90
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether combined treatment using medication and
      biofeedback would be more effective than drug treatment alone for treating
      transformed migraine complicated by analgesic overuse. BACKGROUND: Headaches that
      are chronic, daily, and aggravated by medication overuse are particularly
      difficult to treat. METHODS: Sixty-one consecutive patients with transformed
      migraine and analgesic overuse were treated with inpatient pharmacologic therapy 
      alone or with inpatient pharmacologic therapy combined with biofeedback-assisted 
      relaxation. All patients then were followed prospectively for 3 years. RESULTS:
      Both treatment groups exhibited similar levels of improvement immediately
      following treatment and for 1 year thereafter. At year 3, participants receiving 
      combined treatment showed greater sustained improvement on two of three outcome
      measures assessed (ie, fewer days of headache and reduced consumption of
      analgesic medication). In addition, a greater number of patients assigned to
      pharmacologic treatment alone relapsed (ie, resumed overuse of analgesics)
      compared to patients receiving combined treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These results
      suggest that a combination of pharmacologic and behavioral treatment is more
      effective than drug therapy alone in the long-term management of transformed
      migraine with analgesic overuse. Confirmation of these findings, as well as
      extension to other forms of behavioral and cognitive-behavioral treatment, is
      required.

AB  - The current concepts in neurocritical care including advancement in therapeutic
      interventions and monitoring modalities are covered for four entities: stroke,
      subarachnoid hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury. Although 
      therapies were mainly supportive in the past, acute ischemic stroke may now be
      treated with tissue plasminogen activator if inclusion and exclusion criteria are
      met. The management of subarachnoid hemorrhage including cerebral vasospasm is
      discussed in detail. Traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury with
      prevention of secondary injury to limit further sequelae are also covered.
      Medical complications which increase morbidity and mortality are also presented.

TI  - A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of remacemide hydrochloride in patients 
      with refractory epilepsy following pre-surgical assessment.
PG  - 371-6
AB  - This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group
      study investigated the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of remacemide
      hydrochloride in adult patients ( n= 59) with refractory epilepsy, undergoing
      reduced or discontinued antiepileptic drug (AED) usage, as part of an evaluation 
      for epilepsy surgery. On discontinuation or reduction of maintenance AEDs,
      patients received remacemide hydrochloride, up to 600 mg daily, or placebo, for
      up to ten days or until they experienced a fourth complex partial (CPS) or a
      generalised tonic-clonic (GTC) seizure. Pre- and post-study blood and urine
      samples were taken for analysis. Remacemide hydrochloride showed a significantly 
      ( P= 0.045) longer median time to fourth seizure compared with placebo (6.8 vs.
      3.8 days). Median nine-day seizure counts were significantly ( P= 0.0327) lower
      with remacemide hydrochloride than placebo (6.2 vs. 12.8). Eleven remacemide
      hydrochloride patients and six placebo patients completed ten days' treatment.
      Remacemide and desglycinyl metabolite levels were lower in patients receiving
      concomitant carbamazepine or phenytoin than in those receiving non-inducing AEDs 
      or remacemide hydrochloride alone. No serious adverse events occurred; all
      patients receiving remacemide hydrochloride completed the study. Remacemide
      hydrochloride was well tolerated and showed significant therapeutic activity in
      this patient population.

TI  - Long-term prognosis of vascular hemiballismus.
PG  - 2109-11
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the
      long-term prognosis of hemiballismus due to first-ever ischemic strokes. METHODS:
      A cohort of 27 patients with hemiballismus due to first-ever ischemic strokes was
      followed for a mean period of 30 months (range, 5 days to 150 months). RESULTS:
      During the follow-up period there were 11 deaths (44%). The survival rate was 85%
      (95% CI, 71% to 99%) at 6 months, 81% (95% CI, 65% to 97%) at 15 months, 51% (95%
      CI, 24% to 78%) at 36 months, and only 32% (95% CI, 4% to 60%) at 150 months. The
      survival rate free from recurrent stroke was 96% (95% CI, 87% to 100%) at 6
      months, 91% (95% CI, 79% to 100%) at 12 months, 80% (95% CI, 61% to 99%) at 24
      months, and 27% (95% CI, 0% to 71%) at 150 months. CONCLUSIONS: The long-term
      prognosis of patients with vascular hemiballismus is similar to that of other
      stroke patients, ie, it follows the etiologic pattern of hemiballismus.

TI  - New and emerging prophylactic agents for migraine.
PG  - 611-34
AB  - Frequent, severe and long-lasting migraine attacks require prophylaxis.
      Established drugs used for the prevention of migraine such as beta-adrenoceptor
      antagonists (beta-blockers), calcium channel antagonists, antidepressants and
      others have an unknown mode of action in migraine. Their prophylactic effect in
      migraine was discovered by chance in clinical practice when these drugs were used
      for other purposes. Recently, research into the mechanisms of migraine and the
      progressive recognition that cortical hyperexcitability and an imbalance between 
      neuronal inhibition [mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)] and excitation
      (mediated by excitatory amino acids) may play an important role in migraine
      pathophysiology have lead to the identification of potential new agents for the
      prevention of migraine attacks. This paper reviews the recent literature on these
      new agents. A search was conducted using MEDLINE from 1998 to November 2001 with 
      the following search terms: migraine, preventive, prophylactic and treatment.
      Headache textbooks edited in 2000 and 2001 were also used. After analysing the
      available controlled and uncontrolled clinical studies as well as abstracts,
      divalproex sodium (valproate semisodium) can be recommended for the prevention of
      migraine. Lamotrigine may be useful for preventing aura associated with migraine,
      and topiramate seems a promising option pending trials with more patients, which 
      are currently underway. Riboflavin (which is possibly involved in improving
      neuronal energy production) appears to be a promising agent, although comparisons
      with established prophylactic medications are needed. Gabapentin, magnesium,
      lisinopril and botulinum toxin A have recently been suggested to be effective;
      however, at present, there are insufficient rigorous and reliable controlled data
      on these drugs for them to be indicated for such use. Emerging options such as
      tiagabine, levetiracetam, zonisamide and petasites may all be useful, but
      controlled data are required to confirm their efficacy. The anti-asthma
      medication montelukast was found to be effective in an open trial, but
      ineffective in a recently completed controlled trial. There is an expectation
      that modern neuroscience will soon provide more efficacious and better tolerated 
      prophylactic medications for migraine.

TI  - Proton pump inhibitors: an update.
PG  - 273-80
AB  - Since their introduction in the late 1980s, proton pump inhibitors have
      demonstrated gastric acid suppression superior to that of histamine H2-receptor
      blockers. Proton pump inhibitors have enabled improved treatment of various
      acid-peptic disorders, including gastroesophageal reflux disease, peptic ulcer
      disease, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug-induced gastropathy. Proton pump 
      inhibitors have minimal side effects and few significant drug interactions, and
      they are generally considered safe for long-term treatment. The proton pump
      inhibitors omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, and the recently approved
      esomeprazole appear to have similar efficacy.

      review the literature on the efficacy and tolerability of antiepileptic drugs in 
      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, both case reports and open studies, as well as
      controlled studies if available. The results of the studies will be presented
      together with their methodological limitations (e.g., open trials, use of
      additional medications, and lack of use of standardized scales for Posttraumatic 
      Stress Disorder). The effects of antiepileptic drugs on kindling, a suggested
      pathogenesis for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder are overviewed, and suggestions
      for further research are raised.

TI  - Do preclinical seizure models preselect certain adverse effects of antiepileptic 
      drugs.
PG  - 33-40
AB  - Classical screening tests (maximal electroshock, MES, and threshold
      pentylenetetrazol, PTZ) employ non-epileptic rodents and identify antiepileptic
      drugs (AEDs) with mechanisms of action associated with significant CNS side
      effects. Thus MES identifies drugs acting on Na+ channels that produce cerebellar
      toxicity. It may be possible to produce novel AEDs more selectively targeted at
      voltage-sensitive (VS) ion channels. There is little specific evidence for the
      likely success of this strategy with subunit selective agents targeted at the
      different VS Na+ channels. Drugs targeted at specific VS Ca++ channels (T, N, P/Q
      types) may be useful in generalised seizures. There are many as yet unexplored
      possibilities relating to K+ channels. GABA related drugs acting on PTZ clonic
      seizures tend to induce sedation and muscle hypotonia. Studies in mice,
      particularly with knock-in mutations, but also with subunit selective agents
      acting via the GABA(A) benzodiazepine site, suggest that it is possible to
      produce agents which do or do not induce particular side effects (sedative,
      hypnotic, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant, amnesia, anaesthesia). Whether these
      findings transfer to man has yet to be established. Acquired epilepsy in rodents 
      (e.g. kindling or spontaneous seizures following chemically- or
      electrically-induced status epilepticus) or acquired epilepsy in man (following
      prolonged febrile seizures or traumatic brain injury) is associated with multiple
      changes in the function and subunit composition of ion channels and receptor
      molecules. Optimal screening of novel AEDs, both for efficacy and side effects,
      requires models with receptor and ion channel changes similar to those in the
      target human syndrome.

TI  - Irampanel Boehringer Ingelheim.
PG  - 908-10
AB  - The oxazole derivative, irampanel, a non-competitive AMPA receptor antagonist, is
      under development by Boehringer Ingelheim for the potential treatment of stroke
      [329079]. Phase I/IIa trials for stroke had been initiated by July 2000 [374144].
      Phase II trials were ongoing in April 2001 [407163]; in April 2002, however, the 
      drug did not appear on the company's research and development pipeline [446554], 
      and a company spokesperson declined to confirm its current status [450591]. The
      compound was also originally under investigation for other neurological
      disorders, including epilepsy and pain [329079], although by October 1999,
      development was only ongoing for stroke [346080].

TI  - Cannabinoids in the treatment of pain and spasticity in multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 859-64
AB  - There is a large amount of evidence to support the view that the psychoactive
      ingredient in cannabis, delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta9-THC), and
      cannabinoids in general, can reduce muscle spasticity and pain under some
      circumstances. Cannabinoid (CB1) receptors in the CNS appear to mediate both of
      these effects and endogenous cannabinoids may fulfil these functions to some
      extent under normal circumstances. However, in the context of multiple sclerosis 
      (MS), it is still questionable whether cannabinoids are superior to existing,
      conventional medicationsfor the treatment of spasticity and pain. In the case of 
      spasticity, there are too few controlled clinical trials to draw any reliable
      conclusion at this stage. In the case of pain, most of the available trials
      suggest that cannabinoids are not superior to existing treatments; however, few
      trials have examined chronic pain syndromes that are relevant to MS. Whether or
      not cannabinoids do have therapeutic potential in the treatment of MS, a further 
      issue will be whether synthetic cannabinoids should be used in preference to
      cannabis itself. Smoking cannabis is associated with significant risks of lung
      cancer and other respiratory dysfunction. Furthermore, delta9-THC, as a
      broad-spectrum cannabinoid receptor agonist, will activate both CB1 and CB2
      receptors. Synthetic cannabinoids, which target specific cannabinoid receptor
      subtypes in specific parts of the CNS, are likely to be of more therapeutic use
      than delta9-THC itself. If rapid absorption is necessary, such synthetic drugs
      could be delivered via aerosol formulations.

TI  - Esomeprazole: a clinical review.
PG  - 1333-9
AB  - The pharmacology, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and
      adverse effects of esomeprazole are reviewed. Esomeprazole, a proton-pump
      inhibitor (PPI), is the S-isomer of omeprazole. Esomeprazole has FDA-approved
      labeling for use in the treatment of symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease 
      (GERD), including healing and maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis and
      as part of a triple-drug regimen for Helicobocter pylori infection. Esomeprazole 
      is structurally similar to other PPIs but is the first PPI to include only the
      active isomer, which may lead to improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
      characteristics. Esomeprazole maintains intragastric pH at a higher level and
      above 4 for a longer period than other PPIs. Clinical studies have shown that
      esomeprazole is at least equivalent in safety and efficacy to other drugs in the 
      class. Esomeprazole has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of erosive
      esophagitis, the maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis, and the treatment
      of signs and symptoms of GERD. Effective dosages are 20 or 40 mg orally every day
      or as needed. Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily in combination with
      amoxicillin and clarithromycin is effective in eradicating H. pylori infection.
      The potential for interacting with other drugs is limited and is similar to that 
      of omeprazole. The most common adverse effects are headache, respiratory
      infection, and abdominal symptoms. Esomeprazole has pharmacokinetic properties
      that may make it more effective than omeprazole in some patients.

TI  - Expression and differential processing of caspases 6 and 7 in relation to
      specific epileptiform EEG patterns following limbic seizures.
PG  - 71-87
AB  - The caspase family of cell death proteases has been implicated in the mechanism
      of neuronal death following seizures. We investigated the expression and
      processing of caspases 6 and 7, putative executioner caspases. Brief limbic
      seizures were evoked by intraamygdala kainic acid to elicit unilateral death of
      target hippocampal CA3 neurons in the rat. Seizures rapidly induced cleavage of
      constitutively expressed caspase-6, followed by elevated VEIDase activity and the
      proteolysis of lamin A. Neuronal caspase-6 immunoreactivity was markedly
      upregulated within cortex and hippocampus in relation to bursts of polyspike
      paroxysmal discharges. In contrast, while caspase-7 expression also increased
      within cortical and hippocampal neuronal populations in response to the same
      seizure patterns, caspase-7 was not proteolytically activated. These data
      highlight differences in expression and activation of caspases 6 and 7 in
      response to identifiable seizure patterns, focusing potential therapeutic targets
      for neuroprotection in epilepsy.

TI  - Individualizing the exercise prescription for persons with fibromyalgia.
PG  - 419-36, x-xi
AB  - "Exercise is good for you; you must exercise, and just do it" are common
      admonitions to fibromyalgia (FM) patients by health professionals. "I can't
      exercise; I hurt too much to exercise; and, I don't have enough energy to
      exercise" are equally common responses from patients with FM. Such exchanges can 
      lead to frustration for both patient and provider. The factor that neither
      participant in the dialogue is addressing is that exercise carries both risks and
      benefits for persons with FM. Although for decades exercise has been acknowledged
      to be a key component of the treatment of FM, the majority of FM patients remain 
      aerobically unfit, with poor muscle strength and limited flexibility. Unfit
      muscle is theoretically more prone to muscle microtrauma, which causes localized 
      pain and may trigger widespread pain through disordered central processing. The
      purpose of this article is to provide practicing health care providers with
      guidelines for prescribing exercise to FM patients that take into account the
      risk/benefit ratio. A sample exercise prescription is included.

AB  - The realization of dysautonomia in FM has opened the possibility for new and
      different therapeutic interventions. Much more research is needed to better
      define the role of ANS in the pathogenesis of FM. If this research supports
      current hypotheses, therapeutic trials with disciplines and substances intended
      to correct autonomic dysfunction will be indicated.

TI  - Treatment of fatigue in fibromyalgia.
PG  - 367-78
AB  - Clearly, fatigue is a large and challenging problem for those suffering from
      fibromyalgia. It adds greatly to the morbidity and disability associated with the
      disease. In the management of this specific symptom in fibromyalgia, attention
      should first be focused on identifying comorbidities that may be present and
      contribute to fatigue. As with other symptoms of fibromyalgia, education is a
      critical component of management. This can be done by the practitioner, with
      available free resources, or with specialized cognitive behavioral programs. This
      education process can be augmented with a variety of other nonpharmacologic
      therapies, especially very gradually increasing, low-impact, aerobic exercise
      programs. Numerous pharmacologic therapies may also be helpful as an adjunct to
      treatment. Classes of compounds that raise central levels of norepinephrine or
      dopamine appear to be the most specific for management of fatigue. There are also
      many medications used to combat fatigue in other disorders that have not yet been
      adequately explored as to the possible benefits in alleviating the fatigue of
      fibromyalgia. Advances in the management of fatigue in fibromyalgia are likely to
      come from a variety of directions. Easier access to well designed
      nonpharmacologic therapies is essential, because these treatments are
      underutilized in clinical practice at present. Improvements in pharmacologic
      therapies will come from new insights into mechanisms, especially those that
      might only be present in subsets of patients and would respond to more targeted
      therapies.

TI  - Management of sleep disorders in fibromyalgia.
PG  - 353-65
AB  - In summary, the treatment of patients with FM requires a proper assessment of the
      reason for the unrefreshing sleep, which is an important component of the FM
      syndrome. Sleep laboratory investigations provides a suitable rationale for
      management where a specific primary sleep disorder is determined. Nonspecific
      treatments include various behavioral approaches to improve sleep hygiene,
      fitness, and regular proper nutrition that serve to regularize disturbances in
      circadian sleep-wake rhythms. As yet, no medication is known to improve the EEG
      sleep arousal disorders that include phasic (alpha-delta), tonic alpha non-REM
      sleep disorders, or the periodic K alpha cycling alternating pattern disorder.
      Traditional hypnotic agents, while helpful in initiating and maintaining sleep
      and reducing daytime tiredness, do not provide restorative sleep or reduce pain. 
      Tricyclic drugs, such as amitriptyline and cyclobenzaprine, may provide long term
      benefit for improving sleep but may not have a continuing benefit beyond one
      month for reducing pain. The use of a biologic agent that facilitates
      sleep-related neuroendocrine functions, for example growth hormone, is reported
      to improve symptoms but the need for injection and high cost restrict its use. No
      systematic studies have been reported on the use of remedial measures for the
      management of PLMS/restless legs syndrome and sleep apnea that occur in some
      patients with FM.

AB  - Despite disappointing results when subjected to randomized clinical trials,

TI  - The neuropharmacology of centrally-acting analgesic medications in fibromyalgia.
PG  - 235-59
AB  - As demonstrated above, the anatomy and neuropharmacology of the pain pathways
      within the CNS, even to the level of the midbrain, are extraordinarily complex.
      Indeed, discussions of the effects of these agents on the neuropharmacology of
      the thalamus, hypothalamus, and cortex were excluded from this review owing to
      their adding further to this complexity. Also, the dearth of data regarding FMS
      pain pathophysiology necessitated a relatively generic analysis of the pain
      pathways. As mentioned in the introduction, the current thought is that central
      sensitization plays an important role in FMS. However, we see in this chapter
      that the behavioral state of central sensitization may be a result of alterations
      in either the ascending systems or in one or more descending systems. Studies to 
      assess the presence or relative importance of such changes in FMS are difficult
      to perform in humans, and to date there are no animal models of FMS. Accepting
      these limitations, it is apparent that many drugs considered to date for the
      treatment of FMS do target a number of appropriate sites within both the
      ascending and descending pain pathways. The data regarding clinical efficacy on
      some good candidate agents, however, is extremely preliminary. For example, it is
      evident from the present analysis that SNRIs, alpha 2 agonists, and NK1
      antagonists may be particularly well suited to FMS, although current data
      supporting their use is either anecdotal or from open-label trials [114,149].
      Other sites within the pain pathways have not yet been targeted. Examples of
      these include the use of CCKB antagonists to block on-cell activation or of
      nitric oxide synthetase antagonists to block the downstream mediators of NMDA
      activation. Efficacy of such agents may give considerable insight into the
      pathophysiology of FMS. Finally, as indicated previously, FMS consists of more
      than just chronic pain, and the question of how sleep abnormalities, depression, 
      fatigues, and so forth tie into disordered pain processing is being researched
      actively. Future research focusing on how the various manifestations of FMS
      relate to one another undoubtedly will lead to a more rational targeting of drugs
      in this complex disorder.

TI  - The rational management of fibromyalgia patients.
PG  - 181-99, v
AB  - The exponential increase in pain research over the last 10 years has established 
      fibromyalgia (FM) as a common chronic pain syndrome with similar neurophysiologic
      aberrations to other chronic pain states. As such, the pathogenesis is considered
      to involve an interaction of augmented sensory processing (central sensitization)
      and peripheral pain generators. The notion, that FM symptomatology results from
      an amplification of incoming sensory impulses, has revolutionized the
      contemporary understanding of this enigmatic problem and provided a more rational
      approach to treatment. To date, the management of FM has been mainly palliative, 
      with the aims of reducing pain, improving sleep, maintaining function, treating
      psychologic distress and diminishing the impact of associated syndromes. The
      rapidly evolving neurophysiologic, psychophysiologic and molecular biologic basis
      for chronic pain states has already opened up new avenues for management which
      should be applicable to this difficult group of patients. Indeed, it is now
      possible to think about a "rational" approach to managing FM patients that was
      unthinkable just a few years ago.

TI  - The locked-in syndrome: a syndrome looking for a therapy.
PG  - 571-82
AB  - The locked-in syndrome (LIS) is a very severe condition caused by a primary
      vascular or traumatic injury to the brainstem, normally corresponding to a
      ventral pons lesion due to an obstruction of the basilar artery, and
      characterized by upper motor neuron quadriplegia, paralysis of lower cranial
      nerves, bilateral paresis of horizontal gaze and anarthria, and with preserved
      consciousness. Patients who have suffered this pontine lesion generally have
      preserved vertical eye movements and movement of the eyelids (blinking), this
      being their only means of responding to the outside world. A survey was conducted
      of 44 people diagnosed with LIS, all of them belonging to the Association of
      Locked-in Syndrome (ALIS) of France. Results of this survey showed that LIS was
      equally frequent in men and women (51.2% vs. 48.1%) and had occurred at any age
      between 22-77 years of age (normally between 41-52 years, the mean age being
      46.79 years). The average time that transpired post-insult was 71.35 months. The 
      principal cause of LIS was stroke (86.4%), with traumatic brain injury (TBI)
      being a distant second cause with an incidence of only 13.6%. The diagnosis of
      LIS was usually made around the middle of the second month after onset (mean of
      78.76 days). The principal treatments, when present, were pharmacological and
      physiotherapy. However, 47.1% of the patients were not receiving treatment of any
      kind at the time of the survey. Neuropsychologically, 86% had a good attentional 
      level, 97.6% were temporally oriented and 76.7% could read; 18.6% reported memory
      problems and 24% showed visual deficit (found mainly in patients with LIS
      originated by TBI); 47.5% reported a good mood state and 12.5% reported feeling
      depressed; 61.1% reported having sexual desire, but only 30% maintained sexual
      relations; 78% were capable of emitting sounds and 65.8% could communicate
      without technical aid; 73.2% enjoyed going out and 81% met with friends at least 
      twice a month. Only 14.3% participated in social activities and 23.8% watched
      television regularly. Nearly 100% of the patients reported being sensitive to
      touch to any part of their bodies. This survey suggests diagnostics and
      rehabilitation procedures.

TI  - Raloxifene for the treatment and prevention of breast cancer?
PG  - 334-40
AB  - Raloxifene is a member of a family of drugs known as selective estrogen receptor 
      modulators (SERMs). Raloxifene is currently approved by the FDA for the
      prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. SERMs hold the 
      potential to treat and prevent breast cancer, osteoporosis and coronary heart
      disease. Ongoing clinical trials are in place to address the role of raloxifene
      and SERMs in each of these areas. We review the pharmacology, clinical utility,
      safety and tolerability of raloxifene and speculate on what the future holds for 
      SERMs and their use in breast cancer.

TI  - Newer antiepileptic drugs in bipolar disorder: rationale for use and role in
      therapy.
PG  - 549-62
AB  - Antiepileptic drugs (AEDS) are used regularly in the treatment of patients with
      bipolar disorders. Carbamazepine and valproic acid (sodium valproate) are
      effective as antimanic treatments, and the success of these medications has
      prompted investigation of other AEDs as possible treatments in patients with mood
      disorders. Lamotrigine appears to be the most promising of the newer AEDs with
      respect to effects in mood disorders. Current evidence suggests efficacy of this 
      drug both as monotherapy and as an adjunctive agent in bipolar depression, and
      studies are underway to clarify its efficacy in mood stabilisation and rapid
      cycling, as currently available data are equivocal. Use of gabapentin is not as
      well supported in the literature, although data from open trials using it as an
      adjunctive agent suggest that it may be helpful in patients with bipolar
      depression. There have been some open trials and case reports supporting the use 
      of topiramate as an adjunctive agent for the treatment of mania; however, data
      from controlled trials are not yet available. Further controlled trials of
      lamotrigine, gabapentin or topiramate as monotherapy and adjunctive treatment are
      needed to clarify their potential roles in the treatment of patients with mood
      disorders.

TI  - [Spasticity treated with selective posterior rhizotomy].
PG  - 1190-1
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spasticity is often seen in patients with central nervous lesions.
      Some patients with severe spasticity are not optimally treated with physiotherapy
      and medication. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We present a case history of a 41-year-old 
      woman with multiple sclerosis and severe painful spasticity in her lower limbs.
      Her spasticity did not respond to treatment with physiotherapy, spasmolytic
      medication, botulinum toxin A, intrathecal baclofen or epidural spinal cord
      stimulation. RESULT: The patient was treated with selective posterior rhizotomy
      S1-L1. Section of 60% of the rootlets on the right side and 40% on left the side 
      resulted in a good outcome with less spasticity and pain. Finally her
      contractures were treated with tenotomy and myotomy, also with good functional
      result. INTERPRETATION: Patients suffering from severe painful spasticity and who
      do not respond to physiotherapy in combination with other spasmolytic medication 
      should be considered for surgical treatment. In some patients posterior rhizotomy
      is the treatment of choice.

TI  - Addressing spasticity-related pain in children with spastic cerebral palsy.
PG  - 123-33
AB  - Children with spastic cerebral palsy (CP) often suffer pain as a result of their 
      spasms. Some studies have suggested that the pain experienced by these children
      may be poorly controlled or respond poorly to treatment. Limited research is
      available that addresses the treatment of pain due to spasms in children.
      Therefore, clinicians do not have empirical evidence to guide their decisions.
      Many current treatment options have not been tested for their effect on pain.
      Previous research has been guided more by the ability of these treatments to
      increase functional abilities. Pain also is an important indicator of quality of 
      life; however, this has been overlooked in research.

TI  - Chloride increases adrenergic receptor-mediated platelet and vascular responses.
PG  - 492-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: We postulated that increasing intracellular chloride concentration
      ([Cl-]i) in human platelets would potentiate alpha2 adrenergic receptor
      (A2AR)-mediated platelet aggregation, and that vascular reactivity would also be 
      increased by raising [Cl-]i in blood vessels. We further hypothesized that
      ligands binding to the A2AR would increase [Cl-]i by stimulating carbonic
      anhydrase-dependent chloride/bicarbonate exchange. Because diuretics are potent
      inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase, we speculated that these agents inhibit
      platelet aggregation and vascular contractility through inhibition of chloride
      influx by decreasing carbonic anhydrase activity, and subsequently,
      chloride/bicarbonate exchange. The aim of this study was to test these
      hypotheses. METHODS: Platelet aggregation was measured by determining changes in 
      optical density of platelet-rich plasma. Contractile responses to A2AR agonists
      were recorded in isolated vascular smooth muscle. The substances [Cl-]i and
      intracellular pH (pHi) were measured using microfluorometric methods. Carbonic
      anhydrase activity and chloride/bicarbonate exchange were determined by an in
      vitro assay based on the Stewart cycle. RESULTS: Increasing [Cl-]i potentiated
      platelet aggregation and vascular contractility, and epinephrine raised [Cl-]i by
      stimulating carbonic anhydrase-dependent chloride/bicarbonate exchange.
      Furthermore, diuretic-dependent inhibition of carbonic anhydrase activity
      decreased chloride/bicarbonate exchange. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the
      concept that diuretics inhibit carbonic anhydrase activity and
      chloride/bicarbonate exchange in platelets and vascular smooth muscle. The
      ensuing reduction in [Cl-]i that is induced by diuretics in these tissues could
      play a role in reducing the effect of catecholamines on precipitating thrombotic 
      stroke or myocardial infarction.

TI  - Transient pulmonary infiltrates possibly induced by quinine sulfate.
PG  - 775-8
AB  - Quinine sulfate, which has been available for many years, has not been implicated
      definitively in the development of pulmonary toxicity. A variety of adverse
      effects, however, have been reported with quinine administration. A 45-year-old
      woman with longstanding rheumatoid arthritis experienced wheezing, severe
      anxiety, breathlessness, cough, orthopnea, mild fever, chills, and pleuritic
      chest discomfort after taking a single dose of quinine for nocturnal leg cramps. 
      Radiographic imaging demonstrated diffuse, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates
      suggestive of pulmonary edema. No cause other than acute quinine ingestion could 
      be identified despite thorough cardiac and infectious disease evaluations.
      Clinicians should be aware of a possible association between quinine sulfate and 
      pulmonary toxicity.

TI  - Functional benefits and cost/benefit analysis of continuous intrathecal baclofen 
      infusion for the management of severe spasticity.
PG  - 1052-7
AB  - OBJECT: Intrathecally delivered baclofen has been used as a treatment for severe 
      spasticity since 1984. Despite this, there are uncertainties surrounding the
      benefits of treatment and the costs involved. The authors assessed the evidence
      of benefits and identified costs and the cost/benefit ratio for continuous
      intrathecal baclofen infusion in the treatment of severe spasticity. METHODS: A
      systematic literature review was conducted to estimate the effect of continuous
      intrathecal baclofen infusion on function and quality-of-life (QOL) measures in
      patients with severe spasticity. Outcomes were related to standard QOL scores to 
      estimate potential gains in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Information on
      the costs of continuous intrathecal baclofen infusion was obtained from hospitals
      in the United Kingdom. This information was combined to estimate the cost/benefit
      ratio for the use of continuous intrathecal baclofen infusion in patients with
      different levels of disability from severe spasticity. Studies indicate that
      bedbound patients are likely to improve their mobility and become able to sit out
      of bed. Patients with severe spasm-related pain are likely to have major
      improvement or complete resolution of this pain. Many other benefits are also
      reported. Such benefits are related to costs per QALY in the range of 6,900
      pounds to 12,800 pounds ($10,550-$19,570 US). CONCLUSIONS: In carefully selected 
      patients who have not responded to less invasive treatments, continuous
      intrathecal baclofen infusion is likely to lead to worthwhile functional
      benefits. Continuous intrathecal baclofen infusion has an acceptable cost/benefit
      ratio compared with other interventions that are funded by the health service.

TI  - Design of the Spine Patient outcomes Research Trial (SPORT).
PG  - 1361-72
AB  - SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT) was
      designed to assess the relative efficacy and cost-effectiveness of surgical and
      nonsurgical approaches to the treatment of common conditions associated with low 
      back and leg pain. OBJECTIVES: To describe the rationale and design of the SPORT 
      project and to discuss its strengths and limitations. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive. 
      METHODS: First, the authors explain the rationale for embarking on SPORT, i.e.,
      deficiencies in the existing scientific knowledge base for treatment of these
      conditions. Second, the authors describe the design of SPORT, including topics
      such as specific aims, participating sites, study population, recruitment and
      enrollment, study interventions, follow-up, outcomes, statistical analysis, and
      study governance and organization. Finally, issues that complicate the
      performance of randomized trials in surgery as they relate to the design and
      conduct of SPORT are discussed. RESULTS: The SPORT project is being conducted at 
      11 clinical centers around the United States. It involves the simultaneous
      conduct of three multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trials. The study
      includes patients with the three most common diagnoses for which spine surgery is
      performed: intervertebral disc herniation, spinal stenosis, and degenerative
      spondylolisthesis, and it compares the most commonly used standard surgical and
      nonsurgical treatments for patients with these diagnoses. By the end of
      enrollment the authors anticipate a total of 500 patients with intervertebral
      disc herniation, 370 patients with spinal stenosis, and 300 patients with
      degenerative spondylolisthesis in the randomized trials. Patients who meet the
      eligibility criteria but decline to be randomized are invited to participate in
      an observational cohort study. Patients are being followed for a minimum of 24
      months with visits scheduled at 6 weeks and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months.
      CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study will provide high-quality scientific
      evidence to aid clinical decision-making and improve treatment outcomes for these
      common, costly, and, in some instances, debilitating conditions.

TI  - Reversible coma in children after improper baclofen pump insertion.
PG  - 454-60
AB  - We report the occurrence of delayed postoperative coma in five of nine
      consecutive children following surgery for insertion of baclofen infusion pumps. 
      We suspect that improper technique resulted in an inadvertent administration of
      an intrathecal baclofen bolus. We suggest ways to minimize this risk.

TI  - Gabapentin. Pfizer.
PG  - 470-7
AB  - Gabapentin has been approved for the treatment of neuropathic pain in six
      European countries, New Zealand and Australia, and numerous countries in Latin
      America. By January 2001, Pfizer was preparing to file an NDA in the US for this 
      indication; by October 2001, this NDA had been filed with the FDA. The drug is a 
      GABA analog, but is not a GABA mimetic, although some neurons that respond to
      gabapentin are GABAergic. Gabapentin, at relevant concentrations, binds to an
      auxiliary protein of voltage-gated calcium channels (a2/3) and apparently, as a
      result, modulates the action of calcium channels and neurotransmitter release.
      This may account for many of its pharmacological actions. Gabapentin is also a
      substrate for the large neutral amino acid transporter, and this may be the major
      route allowing gabapentin access to the CNS. Modulation of synaptic transmission 
      between primary afferents and substantia gelatinosa neurons, and blockade of
      signal transduction, are two potential mechanisms of action, in addition to
      inhibition of glutamate release by voltage-sensitive calcium channels. In
      September 2001, Morgan Stanley predicted sales of US $1871 million in 2002
      falling to US $413 million in 2006.

TI  - Antidepressants in pain management.
PG  - 454-8
AB  - Antidepressants exhibit a number of pharmacological mechanisms, including
      norepinephrine and serotonin modulation, direct and indirect effects on opioid
      receptors, inhibition of histamine, cholinergic and N-methyl-D-aspartate
      receptors, and inhibition of ion channel activity. Although it is not entirely
      clear which mechanisms produce analgesia and to what extent, the available animal
      and clinical trials data indicates that tricyclic antidepressants are effective
      in treating many types of pain. The newer selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
      also appear to be effective for chronic headache and other non-neuropathic forms 
      of chronic pain but are not as well studied. This article reviews the current
      basic and clinical research on antidepressants in pain management.

TI  - Treatments for chronic pain associated with spinal cord injuries: many are tried,
      few are helpful.
PG  - 154-63
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective was to investigate, in two community samples of people
      with spinal cord injuries, the frequency of use of different pain treatments and 
      the perceived helpfulness of these treatments. DESIGN AND SETTING: A postal
      survey was conducted in the community. PARTICIPANTS: The participants were 471
      persons aged 18 years or older who had spinal cord injuries and pain. There were 
      2 separate samples (n = 308 and n = 163). OUTCOME MEASURES: The pain treatments
      used, the helpfulness of these treatments, and the Chronic Pain Grade
      questionnaire answers were assessed. RESULTS: Respondents reported multiple pain 
      treatments (range of 0-14 and median of 4 in sample 1; range of 0-16 and median
      of 4 in sample 2). The most commonly reported treatments were oral medications
      and physical therapy. Medication types most commonly reported were nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, and opioids. The treatments
      rated as most helpful were opioid medications, physical therapy, and diazepam
      therapy, and those rated as least helpful were spinal cord stimulation,
      counseling or psychotherapy, administration of acetaminophen, and administration 
      of amitriptyline. Alternative treatments reported as most helpful were massage
      therapy and use of marijuana. Acupuncture was tried by many but was rated as only
      moderately helpful. CONCLUSIONS: This survey of two large samples of
      community-dwelling individuals with spinal cord injury-related chronic pain
      indicates that multiple pain treatments are tried but only a few are rated as
      more than somewhat helpful. Furthermore, the treatments that are most commonly
      reported are not always those that are rated as most helpful. The findings point 
      to a number of potentially fruitful directions for future research.

PG  - 267-70
AB  - Despite being acknowledged as an important component in the overall management of
      multiple sclerosis, the relatively few evaluative studies in symptomatic
      treatment and rehabilitation have meant that the evidence base is still poor. The
      encouraging work on health outcome measures, together with an improved
      understanding of the mechanisms underlying disability, provide a useful base for 
      improving the lot of patients with multiple sclerosis. These advances need to be 
      associated with improved models of care which provide comprehensive and
      accessible services throughout the course of the disease.

TI  - The placebo effect in alternative medicine: can the performance of a healing
      ritual have clinical significance?
PG  - 817-25
AB  - In alternative medicine, the main question regarding placebo has been whether a
      given therapy has more than a placebo effect. Just as mainstream medicine ignores
      the clinical significance of its own placebo effect, the placebo effect of
      unconventional medicine is disregarded except for polemics. This essay looks at
      the placebo effect of alternative medicine as a distinct entity. This is done by 
      reviewing current knowledge about the placebo effect and how it may pertain to
      alternative medicine. The term placebo effect is taken to mean not only the
      narrow effect of a dummy intervention but also the broad array of nonspecific
      effects in the patient-physician relationship, including attention; compassionate
      care; and the modulation of expectations, anxiety, and self-awareness. Five
      components of the placebo effect--patient, practitioner, patient-practitioner
      interaction, nature of the illness, and treatment and setting--are examined.
      Therapeutic patterns that heighten placebo effects are especially prominent in
      unconventional healing, and it seems possible that the unique drama of this realm
      may have "enhanced" placebo effects in particular conditions. Ultimately, only
      prospective trials directly comparing the placebo effects of unconventional and
      mainstream medicine can provide reliable evidence to support such claims.
      Nonetheless, the possibility of enhanced placebo effects raises complex
      conundrums. Can an alternative ritual with only nonspecific psychosocial effects 
      have more positive health outcomes than a proven, specific conventional
      treatment? What makes therapy legitimate, positive clinical outcomes or
      culturally acceptable methods of attainment? Who decides?

TI  - Postherpetic neuralgia after shingles: an under-recognized cause of chronic
      vulvar pain.
PG  - 625-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vulvar shingles, an uncommon presentation of a common disease,
      probably affects 1.5 million American women during their lifetime and leaves
      about 150,000 with postherpetic neuralgia, a chronic neuropathic pain syndrome.
      Prompt diagnosis and treatment can minimize pain severity and duration. CASES:
      The case of an 88-year-old woman with sacral shingles is described. Complications
      led to her demise. A 35-year-old with a 6-year history of disabling vulvar pain
      and many diagnostic procedures was ultimately diagnosed with postherpetic
      neuralgia. CONCLUSION: Shingles needs to be included in the differential
      diagnosis of vulvar rashes because it is a modifiable risk factor for chronic
      vulvar pain. The possibility of postherpetic neuralgia must be considered in
      women with unexplained vulvar dysesthesia.

TI  - Gabapentin for neuropathic pain following spinal cord injury.
PG  - 282-5
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of patient data. OBJECTIVE: To present two
      years of experience in the use of gabapentin for the alleviation of neuropathic
      pain in spinal cord injury patients. SETTING: Supra-regional Spinal Cord Service,
      Melbourne, Australia. METHOD: Data were retrieved from the medical records of all
      spinal cord injury patients prescribed gabapentin for neuropathic pain. Pain was 
      assessed prior to and during treatment at 1, 3 and 6 months with a 10 cm visual
      analogue scale which ranged from 0 ('no pain') to 10 ('worst pain imaginable'),
      or by the documentation of a verbal description of pain. RESULTS: Seventy-six per
      cent of patients receiving gabapentin reported a reduction in neuropathic pain.
      In those patients with data at all four measurement points, the mean pretreatment
      score was 8.86. Following treatment with gabapentin the score dropped to 5.23,
      4.59 and 4.13 at 1, 3 and 6 months, respectively. Where only a verbal description
      of pain was documented, the trend was that the pretreatment report of
      'unbearable' was replaced by 'liveable' during treatment. CONCLUSION: Our
      experience suggests that gabapentin offers an effective therapeutic alternative
      for the alleviation of neuropathic pain following spinal cord injury. Controlled 
      clinical trials are now required to confirm these observations.

TI  - Horseback riding in children with cerebral palsy: effect on gross motor function.
PG  - 301-8
AB  - The effects of recreational horseback riding therapy (HBRT) on gross motor
      function in children with cerebral palsy (CP: spastic diplegia, spastic
      quadriplegia, and spastic hemiplegia) were determined in a blinded study using
      the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM). Seventeen participants (nine females,
      eight males; mean age 9 years 10 months, SE 10 months) served as their own
      control. Their mean Gross Motor Function Classification System score was 2.7 (SD 
      0.4; range 1 to 5). HBRT was 1 hour per week for three riding sessions of 6 weeks
      per session (18 weeks). GMFM was determined every 6 weeks: pre-riding control
      period, onset of HBRT, every 6 weeks during HBRT for 18 weeks, and 6 weeks
      following HBRT. GMFM did not change during pre-riding control period. GMFM Total 
      Score (Dimensions A-E) increased 7.6% (p<0.04) after 18 weeks, returning to
      control level 6 weeks following HBRT. GMFM Dimension E (Walking, Running, and
      Jumping) increased 8.7% after 12 weeks (p<0.02), 8.5% after 18 weeks (p<0.03),
      and remained elevated at 1.8% 6 weeks following HBRT (p<0.03). This suggests that
      HBRT may improve gross motor function in children with CP, which may reduce the
      degree of motor disability. Larger studies are needed to investigate this
      further, especially in children. with more severe disabilities. Horseback riding 
      should be considered for sports therapy in children with CP.

TI  - Facilitated glucose transporter protein type 1 (GLUT1) deficiency syndrome:
      impaired glucose transport into brain-- a review.
PG  - 295-304
AB  - Facilitated glucose transporter protein type 1 (GLUT1) deficiency syndrome (MIM
      138140) defines a prototype of a novel group of disorders resulting from impaired
      glucose transport across blood-tissue barriers. It is caused by a defect in
      glucose transport into brain, mediated by the facilitative glucose transporter
      GLUT1. Since 1991, more than 70 patients have been identified. The hallmark of
      the disease is a low glucose concentration in the CSF (hypoglycorrhachia) in the 
      presence of normoglycaemia (CSF/blood glucose ratio <0.4). Clinical features are 
      variable and include seizures, developmental delay, acquired microcephaly,
      hypotonia, and a complex motor disorder with elements of ataxia, dystonia, and
      spasticity. The GLUT1 defect can be confirmed in erythrocytes by glucose uptake
      studies and GLUT1 immunoreactivity, and by molecular analysis of the GLUT1 gene. 
      Several heterozygous mutations resulting in GLUT1 haploinsufficiency have been
      identified. An effective treatment is available by means of a ketogenic diet as
      ketone bodies serve as an alternative fuel for the developing brain. CONCLUSION: 
      this treatable condition should be suspected in children with unexplained
      neurological disorders associated with epilepsy and developmental delay and
      confirmed by a lumbar puncture.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of levetiracetam in children with partial seizures: an
      open-label trial.
PG  - 518-24
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the efficacy and safety of levetiracetam (LEV) as adjunctive
      therapy in children with treatment-resistant partial-onset seizures. METHODS:
      Children (aged 6-12 years) with treatment-resistant partial-onset seizures
      receiving one standard antiepileptic drug (AED) were eligible. After a 4-week
      baseline period, children received LEV in a 6-week titration phase (target dose, 
      40 mg/kg/day) followed by an 8-week evaluation phase. Seizure frequency during
      the evaluation period with individualized LEV doses (20-40 mg/kg/day) were
      compared with the 4-week baseline seizure frequency. Plasma concentrations of LEV
      and other AEDs were determined to evaluate potential drug interactions. RESULTS: 
      Twenty-four subjects enrolled and received LEV; 23 entered the evaluation phase, 
      and 22 completed the evaluation phase. Compared with their baseline seizure
      frequency, 12 (52%) of 23 subjects entering the evaluation phase had their
      seizure frequency decrease by >50%. Two subjects remained seizure free during the
      entire evaluation period. LEV did not significantly affect plasma concentrations 
      of any concomitant AED during this study, and no alteration of mean clinical
      laboratory values was observed. The most commonly reported adverse events were
      headache, infection, anorexia, and somnolence. CONCLUSIONS: This open-label study
      of adjunctive LEV therapy (at 20-40 mg/kg/day) suggests that LEV is effective,
      safe, and well tolerated in children ages 6-12 years with treatment-resistant
      partial-onset seizures. A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of
      LEV adjunctive therapy in children with treatment-resistant partial-onset
      seizures is needed and ongoing to confirm these open-label findings.

TI  - SUNCT Syndrome: diagnosis and treatment.
PG  - 373-83
AB  - Short-lasting Unilateral Neuralgiform headache attacks with Conjunctival
      injection and Tearing (SUNCT) is a syndrome predominant in males, with a mean age
      of onset around 50 years. The attacks are strictly unilateral, generally with the
      pain persistently confined to the ocular/periocular area. Most attacks are
      moderate to severe in intensity and burning, stabbing or electrical in character.
      The mean duration of paroxysms is 1 minute, with a usual range of 10 to 120
      seconds (total range 5 to 250 seconds). Prominent, ipsilateral conjunctival
      injection and lacrimation regularly accompany the attacks. Nasal
      stuffiness/rhinorrhoea are frequently noted. In addition, there is subclinical
      forehead sweating. During attacks, there is increased intraocular pressure on the
      symptomatic side and swelling of the eyelids. No changes in pupil diameter have
      been observed. Attacks can be triggered mostly from trigeminally innervated
      areas, but also from the extratrigeminal territory. There are also spontaneous
      attacks. An irregular temporal pattern is the rule, with symptomatic periods
      alternating with remissions in an unpredictable fashion. During active periods,
      the frequency of attacks may vary from <1 attack/day to >30 attacks/hour. The
      attacks predominate during the daytime, nocturnal attacks being seldom reported. 
      A SUNCT-like picture has been described in some patients with either intra-axial 
      or extra-axial posterior fossa lesions, mostly vascular disturbances/
      malformations. In the vast majority of patients, however, aetiology and
      pathogenesis are unknown. In SUNCT syndrome, there is a lack of persistent,
      convincingly beneficial effect of drugs or anaesthetic blockades that are
      generally effective in cluster headache, chronic paroxysmal hemicrania,
      trigeminal neuralgia, idiopathic stabbing headache ('jabs and jolts syndrome'),
      and other headaches more faintly resembling SUNCT syndrome. Single reports have
      claimed that carbamazepine, lamotrigine, gabapentin, corticosteroids or surgical 
      procedures may be of help. However, caution is recommended when assessing any
      therapy in a disorder such as SUNCT syndrome, in which the rather chaotic and
      unpredictable temporal pattern makes the assessment of any drug/therapeutic
      effect per se a particularly difficult matter.

TI  - Atypical low back pain: stiff-person syndrome.
PG  - 218-21
AB  - Stiff-person syndrome was diagnosed in a patient with chronic low back pain. The 
      diagnosis of this rare neurological condition rests mainly on the clinical
      findings of axial and proximal limb rigidity, increased lumbar lordosis often
      accompanied with pain, and normal neurological findings apart from brisk deep
      tendon reflexes. Electromyography of the lumbar paraspinal muscles shows motor
      unit firing at rest with normal appearance of the motor unit potentials. Titers
      of antibody to glutamic acid decarboxylase are elevated. Diazepam is the
      treatment of reference. Physical therapy can substantially improve quality of
      life.

TI  - Management options for the child with spastic cerebral palsy.
PG  - 53-9; quiz 59-61
AB  - Knowledge of spasticity management for the child with cerebral palsy begins with 
      understanding how cerebral palsy and spasticity are defined and related. The next
      step is learning what the treatment options are and how they can impact the
      child. There are many strategies for managing spasticity. This article focuses on
      pharmacologic and surgical approaches. Pharmacologic is further subdivided into
      medications taken by mouth, given through an injection (Botox) or delivered by a 
      pump (baclofen). Surgery includes neurosurgical and orthopaedic procedures. Each 
      treatment is reviewed using rationale, patient selection, delivery methodology,
      and management technique citing the advantages and disadvantages of each
      modality.

TI  - Gabapentin for relief of neuropathic pain related to anticancer treatment: a
      preliminary study.
PG  - 214-9
AB  - The aim of our study was to explore a potential analgesic effect of gabapentin in
      patients with neuropathic pain caused by anticancer treatment. A total of 23
      outpatients without active disease and with chronic, treatment-related pain were 
      included in this single-center, open-label, exploratory, non-controlled study.
      The primary end-points were pain intensity and pain relief following a 4-week
      treatment period. A total of 15 patients (65%) completed the study, 5 (22%)
      discontinued the study due to treatment failure and 3 (13%) due to toxicity. More
      than 50% reduction in pain intensity was obtained in 11 of 23 patients (48%, 95% 
      CI 30-66%). Pain relief increased from 8.33% (+/- 13.64) to 66.58% (+/- 18.35) (p
      <0.01). Somnolence, mental clouding, and headache were the most frequently
      reported adverse events. We concluded that gabapentin should be accepted for
      further investigation in this important setting of supportive care.

TI  - Deramciclane (Egis).
PG  - 289-94
AB  - Egis, in collaboration with Orion Pharma and Pharmacia, is developing
      deramciclane, a 5-HT(2A) antagonist and a 5-HT(2C) inverse agonist, as a
      potential treatment for anxiety disorders [300642]. The compound was also in
      development for epilepsy but no recent development has been reported for this
      indication. As of May 2001, comprehensive phase III studies with deramciclane in 
      ten European countries were progressing according to plan [399853], [408534]. By 
      August 2001, phase III studies were also underway in South Africa [420313]. In
      November 2001, Pharmacia indicated that NDA filing is expected to take place in
      2004 [431903]. In February 2001, Orion announced its intention to commercialize
      deramciclane globally [399853]. In August 2001, Orion and Pharmacia signed an
      agreement under which the two companies were to collaborate in the development
      and commercialization of deramciclane in the US [420313]. Analysts at Morgan
      Stanley predicted in November 2001, that deramciclane would make sales of $25
      million in 2004, rising to $150 million in 2005 [435320]. Analysts at Lehman
      Brothers predicted in December 2001, that deramciclane had a 75% chance of being 
      marketed by 2004, with peak sales potential of $450 million [434768].

TI  - Movement-provoked muscle torque and EMG activity in longstanding motor complete
      spinal cord injured individuals.
PG  - 86-90
AB  - Muscle resistance was evaluated by measurement of movement-provoked torque
      performed during simultaneous thigh muscle EMG recordings in individuals with a
      motor complete spinal cord injury (SCI). Fifteen men with a motor complete (ASIA 
      grade A or B) cervical injury participated in the study. The activity started at 
      an average of 0.11 seconds after the start of the provoking movement as evidenced
      by EMG recordings. However, no activity at all was found before the end of the
      movement provocation for 0.3 seconds in >60% of the test situations, whereas
      muscle torque was recorded in all cases. Significantly higher resistive muscle
      torque (p = 0.049) was provoked during extension movement compared with that of
      flexion. On the contrary, the maximum muscle activity was significantly higher (p
      = 0.009) during flexion movement compared with that during extension, with no
      differences between muscle groups. The resistive muscle torque seems to measure
      the passive viscoelastic component rather then the active spastic component of
      the movement-provoked muscle resistance in our group of motor complete SCI
      individuals.

TI  - Treatment of the overactive bladder: possible central nervous system drug
      targets.
PG  - 18-24
AB  - The well-known side effects of antimuscarinic drugs have focused interest on
      other modalities of treatment of the overactive bladder. To effectively control
      bladder activity, identification of suitable targets for pharmacologic
      intervention is necessary. Such targets may be found in the central nervous
      system (CNS) or peripherally. Several CNS transmitters may modulate voiding, but 
      few drugs with a defined CNS site of action have been developed for treatment of 
      voiding disorders. Drugs affecting gamma-aminobutyric acid, opioid, serotonin,
      noradrenaline, dopamine, or glutamatergic receptors and mechanisms are known to
      influence micturition, and potentially such drugs could be developed for clinical
      use. However, a selective action on the lower urinary tract may be difficult to
      obtain.

TI  - Naratriptan in the prophylaxis of cluster headache.
PG  - 56-7
AB  - A 36-year-old man with cluster headache refractory to trials of standard
      prophylactic treatment and only partially responsive to parenteral sumatriptan
      and inhaled oxygen was admitted to an inpatient pain unit. The diagnosis of
      cluster headache was confirmed by direct observation of a typical attack. Despite
      efforts at prophylaxis, the patient continued to experience three to four severe 
      headaches per day. Attempts to control his headaches with scheduled parenteral
      dihydroergotamine were successful, but headaches recurred when the medication was
      tapered, and continuous or intermittent use of parenteral dihydroergotamine was
      not felt to be a practical option for the patient. Naratriptan 2.5 mg twice daily
      completely abolished his headaches, which recurred when the medication was
      discontinued. No electrocardiographic or laboratory abnormalities were observed
      during treatment, and the patient reported no side effects.

TI  - Third generation anticonvulsants in bipolar disorder: a review of efficacy and
      summary of clinical recommendations.
PG  - 275-83
AB  - BACKGROUND: To review the literature on efficacy of third generation
      anticonvulsants for treatment of bipolar disorder and provide clinical
      recommendations. METHOD: Open and controlled studies, case reports, and case
      series on the efficacy of lamotrigine, gabapentin, topiramate, tiagabine, and
      zonisamide were located through electronic searches of several databases, by
      manual search of proceedings of international meetings, and through contacting
      authors of recent reports. RESULTS: Lamotrigine is the best studied
      anticonvulsant and has efficacy in acute bipolar depression and in longer term
      treatment of bipolar depression as well as rapid-cycling bipolar II disorder but 
      not in acute mania. Open reports suggest usefulness of gabapentin as an adjunct
      in bipolar disorder, but double-blind trials failed to confirm efficacy in acute 
      mania and treatment-resistant rapid-cycling bipolar disorder. Topiramate is
      reported to be effective in acute mania and rapid-cycling bipolar disorder in
      several open studies, but methodological problems in a double-blind study led to 
      a failed study in acute mania. However, topiramate may lead to weight loss in
      some patients. Zonisamide deserves further investigation, but tiagabine does not 
      appear to be useful in acute mania. CONCLUSION: Lamotrigine clearly fills an
      unmet need in treating bipolar depression and rapid-cycling bipolar disorder.
      Other third generation anticonvulsants with the exception of tiagabine offer
      promise but require confirmation of their efficacy from double-blind studies.

TI  - The pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorders in children and adolescents.
PG  - 555-71
AB  - As the recognition of paediatric and adolescent anxiety disorders improves, so
      does the number of recommended treatments. Newer medications (chiefly
      serotonergic antidepressants) have emerged as the pharmacological treatment of
      choice and have largely replaced benzodiazepines and tricyclic antidepressants
      (TCAs) for these disorders. This review will focus on placebo-controlled and
      open-label studies concerning the treatment of anxiety in children and
      adolescents, comparing data from newer antidepressant medications (plus
      buspirone) with data on TCAs and benzodiazepines in this population. There are
      few randomised, placebo-controlled trials of medications for anxiety in children 
      and adolescents, with most data coming from open-label trials and case series.
      Moreover, there are no studies comparing pharmacological versus behavioural
      treatments. Most recent data concerning the efficacy of selective serotonin
      reuptake inhibitors suggests that these agents will be effective and safe in the 
      treatment of paediatric anxiety disorders. The potential side effect profiles of 
      these newer agents also makes them an attractive first choice for anxiety when
      compared to the benzodiazepines or TCAs, each of which poses its own potentially 
      serious adverse effects. More research is needed in the area of
      psychopharmacological treatments for paediatric and adolescent anxiety, not only 
      to substantiate the current beliefs that serotonergic agents are effective and
      safe but to pinpoint the factors that might predict responses to particular
      agents or classes of medications. Future investigations should focus on
      treatments which have already proven effective for adult anxiety disorders (both 
      medications and psychotherapies), given the apparent links between paediatric and
      adult anxiety disorders.

TI  - Botulinum toxin in the management of spasticity in adults.
PG  - 128-30
AB  - Botulinum toxin (BTX) is a powerful neurotoxin which blocks cholinergic
      transmission at the neuromuscular junction. Judiciously applied, it can reduce
      local muscle overactivity while maintaining the strength in other muscles. To
      date BTX has not been licensed for use in spasticity in the UK and the literature
      pertaining to clinical practice is still relatively scant. However, controlled
      trials have provided evidence of the effectiveness of BTX both in reducing
      spasticity itself and in achieving functional gain. The guidance given here to
      clinicians involved in the management of spasticity covers the types of patient
      suitable for treatment using BTX, the appropriate dosage, and the necessary
      follow-up procedures and documentation.

TI  - Quetiapine augmentation in patients with treatment resistant obsessive-compulsive
      disorder: a single-blind, placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 115-9
AB  - Recently, atypical antipsychotics have been used for the management of the
      patients with refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The aim of the
      present study was to evaluate the results of quetiapine augmentation to a
      serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) in the patients with refractory OCD. Fifty-two
      patients with OCD according to DSM-IV entered 3 months of an open-label phase
      treatment with a SRI with or without concomitant adjunctive treatment regimen. Of
      them, 27 patients were refractory OCD. These patients were randomly divided into 
      two groups, SRI plus quetiapine and SRI plus placebo, for an 8-week single-blind 
      phase. The course of OCD was evaluated by Yale-Brown Obsession-Compulsion
      (Y-BOCS) and Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness and Improvement
      (CGI-SI and I) Scales every other week for 8 weeks. Of the 14 patients in group
      I, nine (64.4%) showed significant improvement with 60% or greater improvement on
      the Y-BOCS and one (7.1%) partial improvement with 30% or greater improvement on 
      the Y-BOCS, whereas no improvement was observed in group II. The addition of
      quetiapine to ongoing SRI therapy has been found to be effective and
      well-tolerated approach in patients with refractory OCD.

TI  - Lamotrigine update and its use in mood disorders.
PG  - 860-73
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide a qualitative, systematic update and review of the
      pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy in mood disorders, adverse effects, and 
      costs of lamotrigine. DATA SOURCES: Citations obtained from MEDLINE searches
      (1985-September 2001) using lamotrigine as a text word, articles identified in
      reference lists of pertinent articles, abstracts presented at conferences, and
      research data from GlaxoSmithKline. DATA EXTRACTION: English-language articles
      were considered for possible inclusion. Each title and abstract was examined to
      determine whether the publication contained up-to-date information relevant to
      the objective. Twenty clinical trials that provided data on response rates in
      mood disorders were tabulated. DATA SYNTHESIS: Lamotrigine's primary action is to
      modulate voltage-gated sodium channels. Evidence suggests that it decreases
      glutamate transmission, directly reduces calcium influx, mildly blocks
      transmitter reuptake, and alters intracellular mechanisms of resting transmitter 
      release. The average half-life of lamotrigine is approximately 24 hours, but
      decreases to approximately 7.4 hours when used concurrently with phenytoin, and
      increases to approximately 59 hours with valproic acid. Seven of the 20 clinical 
      trials were randomized, double-blind, and controlled. Existing data are
      inadequate to evaluate lamotrigine use in major depression. The pooled response
      rates for patients with depressed, manic, mixed, and rapid cycling bipolar
      disorder were similar, ranging from 52% to 63%. Adverse effects are infrequent
      when the drug is used alone, but become more frequent when lamotrigine is
      combined with other anticonvulsants. While most rashes are mild, approximately 1 
      in 500 patients develops exfoliative dermatitis. A slow upward dose titration is 
      recommended to reduce the incidence of serious rash, but this may delay the
      attainment of adequate dosage for 6 weeks. Lamotrigine has positive effects on
      cognitive function, but occasionally produces insomnia. Lamotrigine costs 2-4
      times more than lithium, carbamazepine, and generic valproic acid. CONCLUSIONS:
      When efficacy, adverse effects, and cost are considered, lamotrigine should
      probably be reserved as a second-line agent for bipolar depression.

TI  - Efficacy of amitriptyline for relief of pain in spinal cord injury: results of a 
      randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 365-73
AB  - Chronic pain in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) is a difficult problem for 
      which there is no simple method of treatment. Few randomized controlled trials of
      medications for pain in persons with SCI have been conducted. This study was
      designed to determine whether amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, is
      efficacious in relieving chronic pain and improving pain-related physical and
      psychosocial dysfunction in persons with SCI. Eighty-four participants with SCI
      and chronic pain were randomized to a 6-week trial of amitriptyline or an active 
      placebo, benztropine mesylate. All pre- and post-treatment assessments were
      conducted by evaluators blind to the allocation. Regression analyses were
      conducted to examine whether there was a medication group effect on the primary
      (average pain intensity) and secondary outcome measures. No significant
      differences were found between the groups in pain intensity or pain-related
      disability post-treatment, in either intent-to-treat analyses or analyses of
      study completers. These findings do not support the use of amitriptyline in the
      treatment of chronic pain in this population, but we cannot rule out the
      possibility that certain subgroups may benefit.

TI  - Gabapentin: pharmacology and its use in pain management.
PG  - 451-62
AB  - Although its exact mode of action is not known, gabapentin appears to have a
      unique effect on voltage-dependent calcium ion channels at the postsynaptic
      dorsal horns and may, therefore, interrupt the series of events that possibly
      leads to the experience of a neuropathic pain sensation. Gabapentin is especially
      effective at relieving allodynia and hyperalgesia in animal models. It has been
      shown to be efficacious in numerous small clinical studies and case reports in a 
      wide variety of pain syndromes. Gabapentin has been clearly demonstrated to be
      effective for the treatment of neuropathic pain in diabetic neuropathy and
      postherpetic neuralgia. This evidence, combined with its favourable side-effect
      profile in various patient groups (including the elderly) and lack of drug
      interactions, makes it an attractive agent. Therefore, gabapentin should be
      considered an important drug in the management of neuropathic pain syndromes.

TI  - Baclofen-mediated gastro-oesophageal acid reflux control in patients with
      established reflux disease.
PG  - 869-73
AB  - AIM: To explore the effect of baclofen on oesophageal acid exposure in patients
      with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty patients
      with established reflux disease were included in this double-blind, randomized,
      crossover study. Baclofen, 40 mg, or placebo was given as a single dose with a
      washout period of 4 weeks. Symptoms were assessed by a visual analogue scale.
      Oesophageal pH was registered for 12 h and analysed for the whole period and for 
      the 0-4-h, 4-8-h, 8-12-h and 2-h post-prandial periods. RESULTS: Baclofen
      significantly reduced the number of reflux episodes during the 0-4-h (7.9 vs.
      16.5, P < 0.0001; post-prandially: 6.0 vs. 11.2, P < 0.0001) and 0-12-h (46.5 vs.
      73, P=0.0001; post-prandially: 18.8 vs. 29.3, P < 0.0001) periods. The fraction
      of time with pH < 4 was significantly lowered during the 0-4-h period (9.3 vs.
      15.6, P=0.0019; post-prandially: 16.1 vs. 23.5, P=0.0083). Similar results were
      also obtained in patients with a hiatus hernia (n=13). Belching was significantly
      reduced (32 vs. 69 episodes, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: A single oral dose of 40 mg 
      baclofen significantly reduced both the number of reflux episodes and the
      fraction of time with pH < 4, an effect primarily found during the first 4 h
      after dosing.

TI  - Persistence of attacks of cluster headache after trigeminal nerve root section.
PG  - 976-84
AB  - Cluster headache is a strictly unilateral headache that occurs in association
      with cranial autonomic features. We report a patient with a trigeminal nerve
      section who continued to have attacks. A 59-year-old man described a 14-year
      history of left-sided episodes of excruciating pain centred on the retro-orbital 
      and orbital regions. These episodes lasted 1-4 h, recurring 2-3 times daily. The 
      attacks were associated with ipsilateral ptosis, conjunctival injection,
      lacrimation, rhinorrhoea and facial flushing. From 1986 to 1988, he had trials of
      medications without any benefit. In February 1988, he had complete surgical
      section of the left trigeminal sensory root that shortened the attacks in length 
      for 1 month without change in their frequency or character. In April 1988, he had
      further surgical exploration and the root was found to be completely excised;
      post-operatively, there was no change in the symptoms. From 1988 to 1999, he had 
      a number of medications, including verapamil and indomethacin, all of which were 
      ineffective. Prednisolone 30 mg orally daily rendered the patient completely pain
      free. Sumatriptan 100 mg orally and 6 mg subcutaneously aborted the attack after 
      approximately 45 and 15 min, respectively. He was completely anaesthetic over the
      entire left trigeminal distribution. Left corneal reflex was absent. Motor
      function of the left trigeminal nerve was preserved. Neurological and physical
      examination was otherwise normal. MRI scan showed a marked reduction in the
      calibre of the left trigeminal nerve from the nerve root exit zone in the pons to
      Meckel's cave. An ECG-gated three-dimensional multislab MRI inflow angiogram was 
      performed. No dilatation was observed in the left internal carotid artery during 
      the cluster attack. Blink reflexes were elicited with a standard electrode and
      stimulus. Stimulation of the left supraorbital nerve produced neither ipsilateral
      nor contralateral blink reflex response. Stimulation of the right supraorbital
      nerve produced an ipsilateral response with a mean R2 onset latency of 36 ms and 
      a contralateral response with a mean R2 onset latency of 32 ms. Lack of
      ipsilateral vessel dilatation makes the role of vascular factors in the
      initiation of cluster attacks questionable. With complete section of the left
      trigeminal sensory root the brain would perceive neither vasodilatation nor a
      peripheral neural inflammatory process; however, the patient continued to have an
      excellent response to sumatriptan. The case illustrates that cluster headache may
      be generated primarily from within the brain, and that triptans may have
      anti-headache effects through an entirely central mechanism.

AB  - The authors present two patients, with poorly controlled temporal lobe epilepsy, 
      who received transplants of omental tissue on the anterior perforated space and
      left temporal lobe. At present, 26 months after the operation, the first patient 
      has improved about 85 percent; whereas the second patient has complete control of
      seizures nine months after the operation. These clinical results indicate that
      epileptic seizures can be reduced or aborted with this new surgical modality
      (reconstructive technique).

TI  - Topiramate treatment of bipolar spectrum disorders: a retrospective chart review.
PG  - 185-9
AB  - The objective of this paper was to determine if topiramate is effective as
      treatment for bipolar spectrum disorders in a naturalistic setting. All charts of
      outpatients treated with topiramate (n = 76) were reviewed, and clinical response
      was assessed retrospectively using the Clinical Global Impressions Scale for
      Improvement. Mild improvement was seen in 47% (n = 36) and moderate-to-marked
      improvement in 13% (n = 10). Responders received a higher mean dose (180 mg/day) 
      than did nonresponders (83.2 mg/day, p = 0.002). Topiramate dose was also higher 
      in those who lost weight (138.3 mg/day) than in those who did not (70 mg/day, p =
      0.007). Weight loss was experienced by 50% of the sample, with a mean loss of
      14.2 lbs. Side effects were reported by 82% (n = 62) of the population, including
      cognitive effects, sedation, parasthesias, nausea, insomnia, headache, and
      dizziness. Adverse effects led 36% (n = 27) of the total sample to discontinue
      treatment with topiramate. Topiramate led to significant weight loss in about
      half of this bipolar population, while also improving mood symptoms at least
      mildly in most patients. Topiramate response and weight loss were both
      dose-related, with efficacy, in particular, associated with higher doses (mean = 
      180 mg/day) than frequently used in current clinical practice.

TI  - Mechanisms and current treatments of urogenital dysfunction in multiple
      sclerosis.
PG  - 1-8
AB  - The majority of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) suffer from lower urinary
      tract symptoms and sexual dysfunction at some stage of the disease. This has a
      negative impact on the quality of life of patients as well as causing concern to 
      caregivers and family. Neurologists can now treat most of these symptoms by a
      number of pharmacological and nonpharmacological methods. This review presents
      the neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, neuropharmacology and pathophysiology of the
      urinary bladder and sexual organs, and the biological mechanisms underlying
      urogenital dysfunction in MS patients. Current treatment options for urinary and 
      sexual dysfunction are reviewed. As most urogenital symptoms of MS can now be
      treated by conservative means, expert urological or gynaecological consultation
      should be requested only if more aggressive diagnostic or therapeutic measures
      are needed.

TI  - Pain treatment in persons with cerebral palsy: frequency and helpfulness.
PG  - 291-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify the interventions currently being used by adults with
      cerebral palsy (CP) for pain management, examine the perceived helpfulness of
      these interventions, and determine the extent to which these individuals with
      cerebral palsy-related pain were accessing the services of healthcare providers
      for the explicit purpose of addressing pain. DESIGN: Retrospective, descriptive
      study of 64 adults with cerebral palsy-related chronic pain. Subjects ranged in
      age from 18 to 76 yr and included 35 women and 29 men. Subjects were evaluated by
      using a protocol-based interview. RESULTS: The study sample sought and used a
      variety of pain treatments and healthcare providers and rated many of the
      interventions as being at least moderately helpful. Despite the reported
      helpfulness of the pain interventions, however, most are only being used by a
      small subset of the sample. CONCLUSION: The majority of the sample with chronic
      pain did not access healthcare providers for help in managing their pain.
      Cerebral palsy-related pain is undertreated in the adult population with cerebral
      palsy.

TI  - Rectally administered diclofenac (Voltaren) reduces vomiting compared with opioid
      (morphine) after strabismus surgery in children.
PG  - 430-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nausea, vomiting and pain are common complications after strabismus
      surgery in children. Diclofenac, a non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug, is widely 
      used to treat acute and chronic pain but there are few reports of its use given
      rectally in children undergoing strabismus surgery. This open randomised study
      was designed to investigate the analgesic and anti-emetic properties of rectally 
      administered diclofenac compared with opioid (morphine) given i.v. in connection 
      with strabismus surgery in children. METHODS: After obtaining approval from the
      local ethics committee and written informed consent from the parents, 50 ASA
      class I-II children, 4-16 years of age, were randomised to receive either
      rectally administered diclofenac (Voltaren) 1 mg/kg or i.v. opioid (morphine)
      0.05 mg/kg perioperatively. The children were consecutively operated upon from
      May 1999 to January 2001. Anaesthesia was induced with fentanyl and propofol and 
      maintained with propofol. Nitrous oxide was omitted. The postoperative pain was
      assessed after arrival at the post anaesthesia care unit (PACU) by using the
      validated Wong and Baker scale (FACES) Pain Rating Scale. Postoperative nausea
      and vomiting (PONV) was assessed by measuring the frequency of vomiting and the
      degree of nausea. RESULTS: In the diclofenac group the incidence of PONV during
      the first 24 h was 12% (of which one child had severe vomiting). The incidence of
      PONV was much higher, 72% (P = 0.0000), in the morphine group, where 56% of the
      children also had severe vomiting. There were no difference in pain score between
      the two groups. Recovery time at the PACU was longer (P < 0.002) and the
      postoperative analgesic requirement higher in the morphine group (10 vs. 5
      children). No children needed overnight admission to the hospital. CONCLUSION:
      Diclofenac given rectally is an effective analgesic for this kind of surgery and 
      gives less postoperative nausea than i.v. morphine. No serious adverse events
      were observed.

TI  - Sympathetic nervous activation following subarachnoid hemorrhage: Influence of
      intravenous clonidine.
PG  - 160-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Subarachnoid hemorrhage is often accompanied by systemic
      complications and cerebral vasospasm. Elevated levels of circulating
      catecholamines may be involved in the pathophysiology behind these events. The
      alpha-2-agonist clonidine inhibits sympathetic outflow by a central mechanism.
      Unrestricted sympathoexcitation may be detrimental and administration of
      clonidine may be beneficial in these patients. METHODS: Using isotope dilution
      methodology, norepinephrine kinetic determinations, comprising determination of
      arterial norepinephrine concentration and rates of norepinephrine spillover to
      and removal, or clearance, from plasma, were performed on three occasions during 
      the first week after subarachnoid hemorrhage in 25 patients. Eleven of these
      patients received clonidine (continuous i.v. infusion 5.8 +/- 0.7 microg x kg(-1)
      x 24 h(-1)) and the remainder, standard therapy. Initial results were compared
      with 17 healthy age-matched subjects and eight patients suffering from severe
      traumatic brain injury without traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. RESULTS:
      Subarachnoid hemorrhage patients exhibited markedly elevated arterial plasma
      norepinephrine concentrations [3.74 +/- 0.48, P < 0.001 vs. healthy subjects
      (1.59 +/- 0.11 nmol/L) and P < 0.05 vs. head trauma patients (1.94 +/- 0.29
      nmol/L)]. The rate of clearance of norepinephrine from plasma in the subarachnoid
      patients was also significantly greater than that observed in the healthy
      subjects (2.66 +/- 0.15 vs. 2.14 +/- 0.15 L/min, P < 0.05) and the head trauma
      patients (2.00 +/- 0.12 L/min, P < 0.05). Compared with both control groups, on
      admission the rate of spillover of norepinephrine to plasma following
      subarachnoid hemorrhage was markedly elevated (9.11 +/- 1.12, P < 0.001).
      Clonidine treatment (continuous i.v. infusion 5.8 +/- 0.7 microg x kg(-1) x 24
      h(-1)) did not reduce the increased rate of spillover of norepinephrine to plasma
      following subarachnoid hemorrhage. CONCLUSION: Sympathetic nervous activity is
      markedly elevated following subarachnoid bleeding. Clonidine had no effect on the
      rate of norepinephrine spillover to, or clearance from, plasma in these patients.
      Clearly, further studies are required to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for
      generating sympathetic nervous activation following subarachnoid hemorrhage.

TI  - Is the 5-HT(7) receptor involved in the pathogenesis and prophylactic treatment
      of migraine?
PG  - 1-11
AB  - The mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of migraine and their possible
      association with serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) have not yet been
      elucidated. One of the major obstacles in achieving this goal is the lack of
      information on the mechanisms by which the monoamine could possibly trigger
      and/or modulate the basic pathophysiological features of the condition, that is, 
      cranial vasodilatation and neurogenic inflammation. This information should
      provide a useful theoretical framework to insight the nature of the postulated
      fundamental triggering mechanism in the brain that ultimately results in head
      pain. Novel avenues for research and drug development may be envisaged upon the
      recent observations showing that 5-HT is actually able to produce vasodilatation 
      of intra- and extra-cranial blood vessels through a mechanism pharmacologically
      resembling the 5-HT(7) receptor type, and that the messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding 
      for this receptor is highly expressed in cranial vessels. Other lines of evidence
      have suggested that the 5-HT(7) receptor may play an excitatory role in neuronal 
      systems and that it may be involved in hyperalgesic pain and neurogenic
      inflammation. On the basis of these observations, it is proposed that the 5-HT(7)
      receptor may well represent a link between the abnormal phenomena of 5-HT
      processing and neurotransmission that are observed in migraine patients, and the 
      vascular and neurogenic alterations that account for migraine headache. This view
      is supported by the fact that most of the migraine prophylactic 5-HT receptor
      antagonists display relatively high affinity for the 5-HT(7) receptor, which
      significantly correlates with their pharmaceutically active oral doses.

TI  - Pregnancy and chronic headache.
PG  - 389-93
AB  - Headache patterns in women change in relation to fluctuations in oestrogen
      levels. Increasing oestrogen levels in early pregnancy offer a protective effect 
      against headache, particularly for women with migraine. However, some women
      continue to experience troublesome headache throughout pregnancy. Headache
      persisting at the end of the first trimester will usually continue without
      improvement for the remainder of pregnancy and should be treated. Safe and
      effective acute care treatment options include paracetamol, opioids and
      anti-emetics. The use of triptans during pregnancy is controversial and not
      broadly recommended. Safe and effective preventive treatments include relaxation,
      biofeedback, beta-blockers, some antidepressants and gabapentin in early
      pregnancy.

TI  - An overview of the pharmacology, efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of
      lansoprazole.
PG  - 132-9
AB  - Lansoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that reduces gastric acid secretion in a 
      dose-dependent manner via inhibition of H+/K+-adenosine triphosphatase in gastric
      parietal cells. It also exhibits antibacterial activity against Helicobacter
      pylori in vitro. During almost 10 years of clinical use, lansoprazole has proved 
      effective and well tolerated in a wide range of acid-related disorders, including
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), duodenal ulcers, gastric ulcers,
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-related ulcers, as well as non-ulcer
      dyspepsia and acid hypersecretion. It is also used, in combination with
      antibiotics, for H. pylori eradication. In the above indications, lansoprazole
      has generally proved to be superior to the histamine H2-receptor antagonists, and
      is at least as effective as the other currently available proton pump inhibitors.
      This review aims to evaluate the pharmacology, efficacy, safety and
      cost-effectiveness of lansoprazole in acid-related disorders, with particular
      emphasis on its use in GORD and H. pylori eradication regimens.

AB  - Chronic pelvic pain is a condition which receives less attention in men than in
      women. It is often difficult to diagnose and more difficult to treat. The new
      classification of prostatis and its variants has introduced the term 'chronic
      pelvic pain syndrome' which underlines the difficulties in dealing with this
      disorder which may represent a variety of chronically painful conditions with a
      large functional component.

TI  - The medical management of spasticity.
PG  - 30-4; discussion 53-61
AB  - When spasticity produces a clinical disability by interfering with posture, motor
      capacity, nursing or daily living activities, medical treatment is recommended.
      It is mainly indicated when the muscle overactivity is diffusely distributed and 
      should be implemented early, to prevent permanent musculoskeletal deformities or 
      contractures. A pharmacological approach relies on the use of drugs which
      modulate neurotransmitters acting at the cortico-spinal level (GABA, glycine,
      glutamate, noradrenaline, serotonin). The aim of this treatment is to decrease
      spinal reflex excitability by reducing the release of excitatory
      neurotransmitters, or by potentiating the activity of inhibitory inputs.
      Evaluation of the efficacy of these drugs is determined by the therapeutic
      objectives which may be biomechanical, or functional. Diazepam increases
      presynaptic inhibition by stimulating GABA(A) receptors in the brainstem and
      spinal cord. In double-blind studies of patients with spinal cord lesions,
      antispastic efficacy has been shown, but side-effects are common. Baclofen
      stimulates GABA(B) receptors inducing a suppression of excitatory
      neurotransmitter release. Antispastic efficacy is sufficiently documented, but no
      definite effects on ambulation or activities of daily living have been proved.
      Tizanidine has an alpha2-agonist activity (at spinal and supraspinal level) and
      decreases the presynaptic activity of excitatory interneurones. The main clinical
      effects are a reduction in tonic stretch, polysynaptic reflexes, and
      co-contraction, with fewer side-effects but no definite functional change. The
      efficacy of several other antispastic drugs is documented in a few controlled
      studies, but the majority of information arises from open trials or anecdotal
      observations.

TI  - Serotonergic agents in the treatment of fibromyalgia syndrome.
PG  - 707-12
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate literature that discusses the treatment of fibromyalgia
      syndrome (FMS) with agents that involve the neurotransmitter serotonin. DATA
      SOURCES: Biomedical literature accessed through MEDLINE (1966-August 2001) and
      International Pharmaceutical Abstracts. DATA SYNTHESIS: The cause and
      pathophysiology of FMS remain elusive, although abnormalities in the serotonin
      pathway have been implicated. Several serotonergic agents have been studied for
      use in FMS. Trials and case reports focusing on the use of newer agents: the
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, venlafaxine and tramadol, were reviewed.
      CONCLUSIONS: Current research suggests that the serotonergic agents may reduce at
      least some of the symptoms of FMS. However, medications that act on multiple
      neurotransmitters may prove to be more effective in symptom management.
      Additional long-term studies are required in order to validate these results.

TI  - Treatment of resistant depression by adding noradrenergic agents to lithium
      augmentation of SSRIs.
PG  - 634-40
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy of second-line augmentation with noradrenergic
      antidepressants (NAs) in depressed patients who partially responded to lithium
      augmentation of selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). CASE SUMMARY:
      Six patients with major depression or double depression (major depression and
      dysthymia) who were partially responsive to lithium and SSRI treatment were given
      either bupropion or desipramine, in an open clinical manner. Improvement was
      determined and rated by a psychiatrist based on clinical judgment guided by the
      Clinical Global Impression (CGI) improvement scale and by the Global Assessment
      of Functioning (GAF) as described in Axis V in the Diagnostic and Statistical
      Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition. RESULTS: Among the 6 depressed
      patients with partial remission (much improved in symptoms and moderate
      functional improvement: CGI score 2, GAF score 51-60) while taking the SSRI and
      lithium combination, 2 showed complete remission (very much improved in symptoms 
      and good functioning: CGI 1, GAF 80-100) and 3 achieved near-complete remission
      (very much improved in symptoms and significant functional recovery: CGI 1, GAF
      61-80) when given either bupropion or desipramine. One patient did not show any
      additional clinical or functional improvement. Second-line augmentation with
      bupropion was better tolerated than desipramine. CONCLUSIONS: This clinical
      observation suggests that second-line augmentation with NAs may be a viable
      option to optimize recovery in depressed patients with a partial response to
      lithium augmentation of SSRIs.

TI  - The anxiolytic effect of the novel antipsychotic ziprasidone compared with
      diazepam in subjects anxious before dental surgery.
PG  - 206-10
AB  - The novel atypical antipsychotic ziprasidone has a pharmacologic profile notable 
      for potent agonism of serotonin (5-HT)1A receptors, antagonism at 5-HT1D
      receptors, and reuptake inhibition of norepinephrine. 5-HT1A receptor agonism, in
      particular, suggests anxiolytic activity, and ziprasidone has shown preliminary
      efficacy in treating the symptoms of anxiety associated with psychotic disorders.
      In this study, the anxiolytic efficacy of ziprasidone was evaluated in
      nonpsychotic subjects who were anxious before undergoing minor dental surgery. We
      compared a single oral dose of 20 mg ziprasidone (N = 30) with that of 10 mg
      diazepam (N = 30) and placebo (N = 30) in a randomized, parallel-group,
      double-blind study. The peak anxiolytic effect of ziprasidone compared with that 
      of placebo was similar to that of diazepam but had a later onset. At 3 hours
      postdose, the anxiolytic effect of ziprasidone was significantly greater than
      that of placebo (p < 0.05) and somewhat greater than that of diazepam. Diazepam
      showed a significantly greater anxiolytic effect than placebo at 1 hour (p <
      0.05) but not at 3 hours. The sedative effect of ziprasidone was never greater
      than that of placebo, whereas that of diazepam was significantly greater than
      that of placebo 1 to 1.5 hours postdose. Ziprasidone was generally well
      tolerated. Only one patient reported treatment-related adverse events (nausea and
      vomiting) and, unlike diazepam, ziprasidone did not cause reductions in blood
      pressure. Dystonia, extrapyramidal syndrome, akathisia, and postural hypotension 
      were not seen with ziprasidone. Thus, ziprasidone may possess anxiolytic effects 
      in addition to its antipsychotic properties.

TI  - Low-dose tizanidine with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for detoxification 
      from analgesic rebound headache.
PG  - 175-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe an outpatient regimen for analgesic detoxification and
      resolution of analgesic rebound headache. BACKGROUND: Frequent analgesic use is
      believed to promote the transformation of episodic migraine into a chronic,
      pervasive headache syndrome. Management of pain precipitated by analgesic
      withdrawal is crucial to treatment success. Outpatient treatment protocols
      designed to achieve successful withdrawal will reduce costs and potentially lead 
      to more widespread implementation of therapy. METHODS: Patients with appropriate 
      histories were managed on an outpatient basis for detoxification by
      discontinuation of the offending analgesic and initiation of treatment with
      tizanidine and a long-acting nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Patients kept
      diaries of pain and medication use. Results were evaluated at 6 and 12 weeks.
      Patients able to tolerate no or trivial analgesic use (ie, 4 or fewer doses in
      each 2-week period) were considered responders. RESULTS: At 6 weeks, 36 patients 
      (65%) were responders. At 12 weeks, 38 patients (69%) were responders. The
      chronic daily headache pattern had resolved at 12 weeks in 34 patients (62%).
      CONCLUSIONS: This treatment protocol was well tolerated and yielded a high degree
      of efficacy, demonstrating that outpatient management can be effective for
      achieving analgesic withdrawal and resolution of analgesic rebound headache.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate long-term results of chronic intrathecal Baclofen infusion
      on the spasticity, on the spasms and to evaluate the side-effects of the
      intrathecal Baclofen in patients with supraspinal spasticity. CLINICAL MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: Fourteen patients with severe progressive refractory to medical
      therapy spasticity were evaluated after chronic intrathecal Baclofen infusion
      performed by implantation of subcutaneous pump. The patients had suffered
      traumatic or anoxic acquired brain injuries. The clinical evaluation was made
      using Ashworth Scale (AS) and the Spasm Frequency Scale (SFS). RESULTS: The
      intrathecal therapy showed a statistically significant improvement of the tone
      and of the spasms. CONCLUSIONS: The intrathecal infusion of Baclofen seems to be 
      an effective treatment in patients with supraspinal spasticity.

TI  - Late diagnosis of ornithine transcarbamylase defect in three related female
      patients: polymorphic presentations.
PG  - 241-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe three female patients of one family with different
      phenotypes of the same mutation of the ornithine transcarbamylase gene. X-linked 
      inherited ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency is the most frequent urea cycle
      disorder. Many of the hemizygous males die during the neonatal period. Women, who
      are mostly healthy carriers, can also develop symptomatic hyperammonemia. DESIGN:
      Case study. SETTING: Intensive care unit and internal medicine unit at a
      university hospital. PATIENTS: The 20-yr-old female propositus was hospitalized
      for unexplained coma. She had a history of headaches, recurrent vomiting,
      specific anorexia for high-protein foods, and an acute neurologic crisis with
      alleged food poisoning 8 yrs before. The present episode began with psychiatric
      symptoms and seizures treated by diazepam and valproate. This unexplained coma,
      associated with respiratory alkalosis and major brain swelling on brain computed 
      tomography scan, revealed hyperammonemia leading to the diagnosis of ornithine
      transcarbamylase deficiency. Continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration and
      treatment with sodium benzoate and phenylbutyrate improved the situation.
      However, the patient had some neurologic sequelae. DNA studies have disclosed a
      pathogenic mutation in the ornithine transcarbamylase gene of the patient, her
      mother, and her sister. For the mother, the disease was overlooked despite the
      onset of unusual headaches and neurologic signs that mimicked a cerebral tumor 12
      yrs before. The 28-yr-old sister of the propositus has always been asymptomatic, 
      even during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of urea cycle disorder should be
      considered in any patient with unexplained neurologic and psychiatric disorders
      with selective anorexia, even in adulthood. Unexplained coma with cerebral edema 
      and respiratory alkalosis requires urgent measurement of ammonemia and metabolic 
      work-up.

TI  - Effects of functional electrical stimulation training for six months on body
      composition and spasticity in motor complete tetraplegic spinal cord-injured
      individuals.
PG  - 25-32
AB  - The effect of functional electrical stimulation (FES) training on body
      composition, assessed by computed tomography, and the effect of spasticity,
      assessed by both objective and subjective measures, are evaluated. Fifteen
      motor-complete spinal-cord-injured men participated in the study. Eight of the 15
      subjects undertook FES cycling 3 times weekly for 6 months. Whole body computed
      tomography scans evaluated changes in body composition. Simultaneous Modified
      Ashworth Scale and electromyography (EMG) measurements, resistive torque
      (Kin-Com) and EMG measurements, and self-ratings with Visual Analogue Scale
      during four consecutive days were used to evaluate changes in spasticity. Lower
      extremity muscle volume increased by an average of 1300 cm3 (p < 0.001) in the
      training group compared to the control group, who experienced no change.
      Otherwise no changes in body composition were seen. Significant correlations
      (Spearman) were found between individual EMG activity recordings and
      movement-provoked Modified Ashworth Scale ratings in 26% of the test situations, 
      irrespective of group and time. The objective and subjective evaluation of
      movement-provoked passive (viscoelastic) and active (spasticity-related)
      resistance remained unchanged.

TI  - Strategies for optimizing antiepileptic drug therapy in elderly people.
PG  - 329-64
AB  - The elderly take more antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) than all other adults. This
      extensive use directly correlates with an increased prevalence of epilepsy in a
      growing population of older people, as well as other neuropsychiatric conditions 
      such as neuropathic pain and behavioral disorders associated with dementia and
      for which AEDs are administered. The agents account for nearly 10% of all adverse
      drug reactions in the elderly and are the fourth leading cause of adverse drug
      reactions in nursing home residents. Numerous factors associated with advanced
      age contribute to the high frequency of untoward drug effects in this population;
      however, strategies are available to ensure optimal outcomes.

TI  - Electrophysiological assessment of the effect of intrathecal baclofen in spastic 
      children.
PG  - 336-40
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of intrathecal baclofen in a group of spastic 
      children using electrophysiological procedures described in adults. METHODS: Six 
      children (aged 1-14 years) with severe spasticity of various aetiologies
      underwent transcranial magnetic stimulation, H reflex and flexor reflex studies
      before and after intrathecal injection of baclofen. Ashworth scale was used for
      clinical evaluation of spasticity. RESULTS: Motor evoked potentials, present in
      two patients before baclofen, were preserved after injection. Before baclofen, H 
      reflex was present in 5 patients (H(max)/M(max) from 0.23 to 0.84) and absent in 
      one who had infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy. After baclofen, it was absent in 4
      patients and markedly reduced in one. Surface of flexor reflex significantly
      decreased after baclofen (P=0.01), while threshold significantly increased
      (P=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: In spastic children, the action of baclofen on spinal
      pathways may be quantified by the same electrophysiological procedures as in
      adults. This approach may contribute to select optimal dosage.

TI  - Hypertensive disease in twin pregnancies: a review.
PG  - 8-14
AB  - Reports over the past seventy years show that twin gestations lead to an
      increased risk of hypertensive disorders. Numerous studies discuss the incidence 
      of hypertensive disease in twin versus singleton gestations, as well as effects
      of parity, race, age, income level, smoking, zygosity and heritability on this
      condition. The range of relative risk of gestational hypertension, preeclampsia
      and eclampsia for twin compared to singleton gestations is 1.2 to 2.7, 2.8 to 4.4
      and 3.4 to 5.1 respectively. Parity, African-American ethnicity, and young
      maternal age are all factors that increase the relative risk of acquiring
      hypertensive disease to 4.0, 1.8 and 1.5 in mothers of twin gestations. Factors
      such as maternal smoking, income level and zygosity have a negligible effect on
      the relative risk of acquiring hypertensive disease in twin gestations. In
      addition to twin mothers exhibiting a higher incidence of hypertensive disease
      compared to their singleton counterparts, they also exhibit an earlier onset of
      hypertensive disease at both 35 and 37 weeks of gestation comparatively. Uric
      acid levels measured at 30-31 weeks of gestation in twin mothers predicted the
      onset of preeclampsia with a sensitivity of 73% and a specificity of 74%. The
      range of risks presented in the literature is wide and the therapies avocated are
      diverse. We therefore decided to summarize the risks in a comparative fashion and
      to review current therapeutic strategies for the convenience of clinicians who
      confront increasing numbers of multiple pregnancies. The tables bring all recent 
      published risks together in the first comparative analysis in which the data has 
      been converted to relative risks and confidence intervals. Because the literature
      is relatively silent on specific management of hypertensive disease in twin
      pregnancies, general management recommendations for singleton gestations should
      be used by practitioners caring over twin gestations.

TI  - Management of fibromyalgia: what are the best treatment choices?
PG  - 577-92
AB  - Fibromyalgia still represents an enigma to modern medicine and the
      aetiopathogenesis is far from explored. The management of patients with
      fibromyalgia is thus mostly based on empirical research, and only a few
      controlled studies have been performed. Basic drug therapy rests on the
      administration of amitriptyline and conventional analgesics. Such therapy should 
      be initiated only after careful patient information and delineation of
      therapeutic goals are provided. Any drug therapy should be administered in
      combination with physical treatment and cognitive behavioural therapy. Because of
      the appearing contours of pathogenic mechanisms, hopefully a number of new drugs 
      will be available to the patients with this complex pain syndrome in the near
      future.

TI  - Headache during pregnancy.
PG  - 179-85
AB  - Headache in pregnancy is a common problem but diagnosis and management can be
      challenging. Most headaches in pregnant women are either migraine or tension
      types and can be easily treated. Rarely, the headache in a pregnant patient
      signals a life-threatening condition. Obstetricians should be able to effectively
      manage the common causes of headache as well as recognize the warning signs of
      potentially serious conditions. Diagnosis and management should be systematic yet
      individualized.

TI  - Anticonvulsants: aspects of their mechanisms of action.
PG  - 3-9
AB  - An ideal anticonvulsant drug would prevent or inhibit excessive pathological
      neuronal discharge without interfering with physiological neuronal activity and
      without producing untoward effects. Such an ideal compound is not yet available. 
      However, during the last few years several new anticonvulsants have appeared
      (e.g. vigabatrine, gabapentin, topiramate, lamotrigine, tiagabine, felbamate and 
      oxcarbazepine) which may challenge the older, more established substances (i.e.
      phenytoin, benzodiazepines, phenobarbital, valproate, carbamazepine and
      ethosuximide). Interestingly, several of the old and new anticonvulsants are
      beneficial in the treatment of various psychiatric conditions (most notably mood 
      disorders) as well as neuropathic pain. The reason these various drugs are
      effective in the treatment of such disparate clinical conditions is unknown. The 
      answer may be that the neuronal dysfunctions underlying these conditions are
      similar in a mechanistic sense, but are manifested in different neurons/locations
      of the nervous system, or that the drugs possess several mechanisms of action
      that contribute in different ways to the favourable effect depending on the
      condition studied. Even though all these drugs inhibit excessive neuronal
      activity, this acute effect appears to be produced by several mechanisms, which
      fall into three major categories: (1) blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels; 
      (2) indirect or direct enhancement of inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid
      [GABAergic] neurotransmission; or (3) inhibition of excitatory glutamatergic
      neurotransmission. Moreover, several of these drugs fall into more than one
      category, and it is often unclear which category is responsible for a given
      effect of a drug. It is plausible that some of the beneficial effects observed in
      the clinic can be explained by the secondary neural depressant mechanisms of
      action of these substances, whereas other benefits may be due to long-term
      neuroplastic effects, which may either be common or different across the various 
      conditions treated.

TI  - The effect of guided imagery and amitriptyline on daily fibromyalgia pain: a
      prospective, randomized, controlled trial.
PG  - 179-87
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The effectiveness of an attention distracting and an attention
      focusing guided imagery as well as the effect of amitriptyline on fibromyalgic
      pain was studied prospectively. METHODS: Fifty-five women with previously
      diagnosed fibromyalgia were monitored for daily pain (VAS) in a randomized,
      controlled clinical trial. One group received relaxation training and guided
      instruction in "pleasant imagery" (PI) in order to distract from the pain
      experience (n=17). Another group received relaxation training and attention
      imagery upon the "active workings of the internal pain control systems",
      "attention imagery" (AI) (n=21). The control group (CG) received treatment as
      usual (n=17). Patients were also randomly assigned to 50-mg amitriptyline/day or 
      placebo. Some psychological and socio-demographic variables were also measured
      initially. The slopes of diary pain ratings over a 4-week period were used as the
      outcome measures. RESULTS: We found significant differences of the pain-slopes
      between the three psychological conditions (P=0.0001). The pleasant imagery
      (P<0.005), but not the attention imagery group's slope, declined significantly
      when compared with the control group (P>0.05). There was neither a difference
      between the amitriptyline and placebo slopes (main effects, P=0.98) nor a
      significant amitriptyline x psychological interaction (P=0.76). CONCLUSION:
      Pleasant imagery (PI) was an effective intervention in reducing fibromyalgic pain
      during the 28-day study period. Amitriptyline had no significant advantage over
      placebo during the study period.

TI  - Long-term use of gabapentin for treatment of pain after traumatic spinal cord
      injury.
PG  - 116-21
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the long-term efficacy of gabapentin as a treatment of
      pain after spinal cord injury. DESIGN: All patients with traumatic-onset spinal
      cord injury treated with gabapentin were identified and followed up using a
      longitudinal observational design with two contact points (6 and 36 months after 
      the trial) using a semi-structured interview. The first follow-up interview
      attempted to capture all 31 patients placed on therapeutic trial. The second
      follow-up interview attempted to capture those reporting a favorable response (n 
      = 14) to the therapeutic trial at the first follow-up. RESULTS: Of the 27
      patients contacted at the first follow-up (87% response rate), 6 (22%)
      discontinued the trial secondary to intolerable side effects; therefore, the pain
      analgesic effects of gabapentin in these patients could not be determined. Of the
      remaining 21 patients, 14 (67%) reported a favorable response (i.e., a 2 or
      greater point reduction on a 0-10 pain-rating scale). The second follow-up
      interview captured 11 (79% response rate) of the 14 patients reporting a
      favorable response at the first interview, and 91% (10 of 11 patients) continued 
      to report that gabapentin was an effective analgesic. There was no evidence to
      suggest dosing difficulties due to tolerance over the 3-year period. Sedation,
      dizziness, and forgetfulness were the most common side effects. CONCLUSIONS:
      Gabapentin may be an effective treatment of pain after spinal cord injury among
      those able to tolerate initial and long-term side effects.

TI  - The vegetative and minimally conscious states in children: spasticity, muscle
      contracture and issues for physiotherapy treatment.
PG  - 217-30
AB  - The neuropathology of the vegetative (VS) and minimally conscious (MCS) states
      and the pathophysiology of spasticity are reviewed. Current treatment options
      available in the physical management of children in a low-level state and factors
      influencing the physiotherapy treatment of children in a low-level state will be 
      discussed. The complex neuropathology of VS and MCS helps to explain the varied
      clinical presentations of children in VS and MCS. Spasticity and muscle
      contracture are common motor sequelae of VS and MCS. Loss of inhibition by
      descending motor pathways is thought to result in increased muscle tone or
      spasticity. However, secondary changes in muscle fibre structure and
      periarticular connective tissue may be an additional component to increased
      muscle tone. A multimodal approach combining physical, pharmacological and
      surgical interventions is likely to be the most effective. Knowledge of the
      likelihood of recovery from VS and MCS can be helpful in determining the
      frequency and intensity of physiotherapy. Ethical issues in the management of
      children in a low-level state include a consideration of the benefits to the
      child and the child's family and the costs to the health care team and the
      medical institution.

TI  - Symptom control in cancer patients: the clinical pharmacology and therapeutic
      role of suppositories and rectal suspensions.
PG  - 117-38
AB  - Rectally administered medications are essential in palliative medicine,
      particularly in the last days of life. They are underutilized. The pharmacology
      of rectally administered medications relates not only to the medication but also 
      to the suppository base, additives, drug ionization, p K(a), absorptive surface
      of the rectum, and rectal health. The pharmacokinetics may differ from those of

      therapy.
PG  - 444-6
AB  - Hyperhidrosis is a relatively common condition with a multitude of causes. Spinal
      cord injury may be complicated by hyperhidrosis. Many forms of therapy have been 
      reported for this phenomenon but few have been demonstrated to be efficacious. We
      describe a case of a child with hyperhidrosis from a spinal cord injury and
      report the first therapeutic use, to our knowledge, of gabapentin for
      hyperhidrosis.

TI  - Brain metastases from fallopian tube carcinoma responsive to intra-arterial
      carboplatin and intravenous etoposide: a case report.
PG  - 179-84
AB  - Fallopian tube carcinoma is the least common neoplasm of the female genital
      tract. Although rare, neurological complications such as brain metastases can
      develop. It remains unclear, however, what role chemotherapy has in the treatment
      of these patients and what route of administration is most effective.
      Intra-arterial (IA) regional administration of chemotherapy may increase
      intra-tumoral drug concentrations and improve efficacy. We report the case of a
      47-year-old woman who developed bilateral fallopian tube cancer and multifocal
      brain metastases. After progression through radiation therapy and oral
      chemotherapy, she was placed on IA carboplatin (200 mg/m2/d x 2 days every 4
      weeks) and intravenous etoposide (100 mg/m2/d x 2 days every 4 weeks). During
      treatment she had objective tumor shrinkage that has remained stable for more
      than 12 months. For patients with fallopian tube carcinoma that develop brain
      metastases and respond poorly to surgery and/or irradiation, multi-agent
      chemotherapy containing carboplatin should be considered. The effectiveness of
      carboplatin may be improved if administered by the IA route.

TI  - Tic douloureux.
PG  - 156-65
AB  - Tic douloureux is an excruciatingly painful condition that primarily affects
      elderly people. It consists of unilateral electric shock-like facial pains
      triggered by non-noxious stimulation with clear-cut pain-free intervals. It
      should be discriminated from all other types of facial pain by the history and
      physical examination. Primary treatment includes anticonvulsant drugs; if these
      fail or side effects prevent their use, a surgical procedure is warranted. Almost
      every patient with tic douloureux can be relieved of his or her pain with
      anticonvulsant medications or surgery. Stereotactic radiosurgery, percutaneous
      gangliolysis and suboccipital craniectomy with microvascular decompression are
      the primary surgical options. The common aspects of tic douloureux and some of
      the rarer variations are reviewed, and treatment options are presented.

TI  - Palliative care in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
PG  - 829-47
AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common degenerative motor neuron 
      disease in adults. The clinical picture consists of generalized fasciculations,
      progressive atrophy and weakness of the skeletal muscles, spasticity and
      pyramidal tract signs, dysarthria, dysphagia, and dyspnea. Pseudobulbar affect is
      common. Disease-specific treatment options are still unsatisfactory. Therapeutic 
      nihilism is not justified as a large array of palliative measures available to
      enhance the quality of life of patients and their families. Because of its
      clinical characteristics, ALS represents a paradigm for palliative care in
      neurological diseases. Numerous projects are being undertaken worldwide in an
      effort to enlarge the evidence base for palliative interventions in ALS.
      Palliative care in ALS is a multidisciplinary effort requiring careful
      coordination. An open and empathic disclosure of the diagnosis is essential.
      Nutritional deficiency caused by dysphagia can be relieved by a percutaneous
      endoscopic gastrostomy. Respiratory insufficiency can be effectively treated by
      non-invasive home mechanical ventilation. The terminal phase of the disease
      should be discussed at the latest when symptoms of dyspnea appear, in order to
      prevent unwarranted fears of "choking to death." Psychological and spiritual care
      of patients and families are important. Collaboration with hospice institutions
      and completion of advance directives can be of invaluable help in the terminal
      phase.

TI  - Palliative care in patients with multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 801-27
AB  - Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central
      nervous system (CNS) and can be characterized by acute exacerbations or gradual
      worsening of neurological function and disability. The course of the disease is
      highly variable and unpredictable, however, there are short and long-term
      favorable and unfavorable predictive factors, which may provide some information 
      about the future pattern of the disease. Palliative care in MS is directed at
      symptom management, psychosocial support, and rehabilitation. The goal in
      palliative care is to achieve a high quality of life. The disease modifying
      agents, interferon beta, Glatiramer acetate and Mitoxantrone are the mainstay of 
      treatment in MS. Symptomatic relief and counseling of patients with MS have a
      strong impact on quality of life.

TI  - Functional improvement in patients with severe spinal spasticity treated with
      chronic intrathecal baclofen infusion.
PG  - 311-5
AB  - In this retrospective study we evaluated the efficacy and functional benefits of 
      chronic intrathecal baclofen infusion in severe spinal spasticity. Twenty
      patients with a diagnosis of severe intractable spinal spasticity were evaluated 
      prior to implantation of a programmable pump for chronic intrathecal baclofen
      therapy and at follow up, which ranged from 12 to 36 months (mean 22.4 months).
      The mean age of the patients was 39.1 years. The prevailing pathology was
      multiple sclerosis. All were unable to walk. Patient assessment was based on the 
      Ashworth Scale, the Spasms Frequency Scale, self-reported pain and Functional
      Independence Measure (FIM) scores. The Wilcoxon test was used for statistical
      analysis. A statistically significant decrease in muscle tone, spasms and pain
      was observed in all the patients. The Ashworth score decreased from 4.4 to 1.8,
      the spasms frequency score from 2.5 to 0.5 and the self-reported pain score from 
      5.5 to 2.3. The FIM score also showed a statistically significant change
      (increasing from a mean of 33.8 to 58.7). Two patients in employment were able to
      return to work. No severe side effects were observed. Chronic intrathecal
      baclofen infusion was seen to produce a functional improvement in patients with
      severe spinal spasticity, particularly as regards bathing, comfortable wheelchair
      sitting and mobility.

TI  - Inflammatory mass lesions associated with intrathecal drug infusion catheters:
      report and observations on 41 patients.
PG  - 78-86; discussion 86-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Several reports have described inflammatory mass lesions at the tip of
      intraspinal drug administration catheters. We evaluated the number of patients
      reported with this condition and whether data support hypotheses that have been
      put forth regarding the cause of these lesions. METHODS: Information that was
      reported in the medical literature, and by Medtronic, Inc., to the United States 
      Food and Drug Administration as of November 30, 2000, was reviewed. RESULTS:
      Forty-one cases were identified, including 16 from the literature and 25 that
      were not published previously in the literature. Because of voluntary reporting
      and other methodological limitations, the actual number of cases must be higher
      than reported. All of the patients had chronic pain. The mean duration of therapy
      was 24.5 months. Most masses were located in the thoracic region. Intrathecal
      drugs included morphine or hydromorphone, either alone or mixed with other drugs,
      in 39 of 41 cases. No masses were reported in patients who received baclofen as
      the only intrathecal medication. Thirty patients underwent surgery to relieve
      spinal cord or cauda equina compression. Eleven patients were nonambulatory at
      last follow-up, and one died of a pulmonary embolus. Surgical specimens revealed 
      noninfectious chronic inflammation, granuloma formation, and fibrosis or
      necrosis. DISCUSSION: The most plausible hypothesis with regard to the cause of
      intrathecal catheter tip mass lesions implicates the administration of relatively
      high-concentration or high-dose opiate drugs or the use of drugs and admixtures
      that are not labeled for intrathecal use. CONCLUSION: Patients who require
      high-dose intraspinal opioid therapy and those who receive drugs or admixtures
      that are not approved for intrathecal use should be monitored closely for signs
      of an extra-axial mass or catheter malfunction. Prompt diagnosis and treatment
      may preserve neurological function.

PG  - 195-201
AB  - Stroke is the most common cause of seizures in the elderly, and seizures are
      among the most common neurologic sequelae of stroke. About 10% of all stroke
      patients experience seizures, from stroke onset until several years later. This
      review discusses current understanding of the epidemiology, pathogenesis,
      classification, clinical manifestations, diagnostic studies, differential
      diagnosis, and management issues of seizures associated with various
      cerebrovascular lesions, with a focus on anticonvulsant use in the elderly.

TI  - Perioperative use of corticosteroid and bupivacaine combination in lumbar disc
      surgery: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 343-6
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A prospective and controlled study of perioperative use of combined
      local anesthetic and corticosteroid in lumbar disc surgery. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND
      DATA: The anti-inflammatory mechanism of corticosteroids is considered to be
      caused by the inhibition of phospholipase A2, which plays an important role in
      the pain mechanism of lumbar disc problems. Although some authors have
      demonstrated that the use of intramuscular bupivacaine during lumbar discectomy
      resulted in a marked reduction of postoperative back pain, others have reported
      that the key intervention was probably the administration of epidural
      corticosteroid. The coadministration of these two drugs in lumbar disc surgery
      for the relief of postoperative back pain has yet not been studied adequately.
      OBJECTIVES: Assessment of the combined use of perioperative corticosteroids and
      bupivacaine for the relief of postoperative pain after lumbar disc surgery.
      METHODS: Forty-four selected patients had acute-onset single-level unilateral
      herniated nucleus pulposus that were refractory to conservative management. All
      patients underwent lumbar disc surgery under standard general anesthesia. Before 
      surgical incision, the skin and subcutaneous tissues were infiltrated with 10 mL 
      of 1% lidocaine with 1:200,000 adrenaline to produce local vasoconstriction.
      During wound closure, 20 mL 0.9% saline in Group 1 (n = 22) and 20 mL 0.25%
      bupivacaine in Group 2 (n = 22) were injected into the paravertebral muscles and 
      subcutaneus tissues. In addition, a piece of autologous fat taken from the wound 
      was first soaked in 40 mg of methylprednisolone for 10 minutes, then placed over 
      the exposed nerve root, and the remaining steroid was flushed into the wound in
      Group 2. The wound was closed after drug administration in both groups. In the
      postoperative period, all patients received 100 mg of meperidine intramuscularly 
      when needed and were allowed to receive a second dose at least 4 hours later than
      the first dose for postoperative analgesia. Postoperative back pain intensity,
      heart rate, and mean arterial pressure were assessed 1, 3, 6, and 12 hours after 
      the conclusion of surgery. RESULTS: Visual analog scale pain scores for the
      postoperative recordings were lower in Group 2 than in Group 1, but these
      findings were not statistically significant. Patients in Group 1 received 77.3
      +/- 48.8 mg meperidine, and those in Group 2 received 31.8 +/- 45.5 mg
      meperidine, for pain medication in the first 12 hours (P < 0.05). Heart rate and 
      mean arterial pressure were not significantly different between the two groups in
      all recording periods. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that the perioperative use of 
      bupivacaine and corticosteroids during lumbar discectomy maintains effective
      postoperative analgesia and decreases opioid usage without complications.

TI  - A study of benzodiazepine users claiming drug-induced psychiatric morbidity.
PG  - 271-8
AB  - To ascertain whether benzodiazepines (BZDs) cause behavioural side effects other 
      than those already known or trigger latent mental illness processes, the medical 
      records of 32 patients who had submitted claims for BZD-induced side effects to
      the Swedish Pharmaceutical Insurance (SPI) claims office during 1985-92 were
      re-assessed by two psychiatrists on the basis of the DSM-IV system to determine
      whether a psychiatric syndrome existed before, during, or after the prescription 
      of BZDs. Of the 32 case reports entered into the study, 22 concerned women; mean 
      age at the time of SPI claim submission was 47 years, and the mean duration of
      BZD treatment was 11.7 years. The BZD dosages were in most cases within
      recommended therapeutic limits. Twenty-five claimants had also been using other
      psychotropic drugs. In 28 of the 32 cases a psychiatric syndrome in accordance
      with DSM-IV was present before the start of BZD treatment-in most cases an
      anxiety syndrome or anxious personality trait. In the other four cases no
      diagnosis could be given owing to paucity of information. In the 12 cases of
      claimants who fulfilled BZD dependence criteria at some point during treatment,
      withdrawal syndromes might have affected the clinical picture to some extent.
      Four claimants received additional post-BZD-treatment Axis I diagnoses, but in
      all four cases the new diagnoses were clearly related to the pre-existing symptom
      pattern. Thus, apart from the dependence on the drug there was no evidence of
      psychiatric morbidity caused by the BZDs. The symptoms reported by the claimants 
      as evidence of BZD-induced psychiatric morbidity seem in most cases to have been 
      a feature of pre-existing psychopathology which became more manifest after
      discontinuation of BZD treatment.

TI  - Complex regional pain syndrome.
PG  - 174-80
AB  - Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), formerly known as reflex sympathetic
      dystrophy, is a regional, posttraumatic, neuropathic pain problem that most often
      affects 1 or more limbs. Like most medical conditions, early diagnosis and
      treatment increase the likelihood of a successful outcome. Accordingly, patients 
      with clinical signs and symptoms of CRPS after an injury should be referred
      immediately to a physician with expertise in evaluating and treating this
      condition. Physical therapy is the cornerstone and first-line treatment for CRPS.
      Mild cases respond to physical therapy and physical modalities. Mild to moderate 
      cases may require adjuvant analgesics, such as anticonvulsants and/or
      antidepressants. An opioid should be added to the treatment regimen if these
      medications do not provide sufficient analgesia to allow the patient to
      participate in physical therapy. Patients with moderate to severe pain and/or
      sympathetic dysfunction require regional anesthetic blockade to participate in
      physical therapy. A small percentage of patients develop refractory, chronic pain
      and require long-term multidisciplinary treatment, including physical therapy,
      psychological support, and pain-relieving measures. Pain-relieving measures
      include medications, sympathetic/somatic blockade, spinal cord stimulation, and
      spinal analgesia.

TI  - Comparative efficacy of SSRIs and amisulpride in burning mouth syndrome: a
      single-blind study.
PG  - 38-43
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Although a significant amount of evidence indicates the efficacy of
      some antidepressants in treating psychogenic pain and somatoform disorder, very
      few studies have investigated their possible therapeutic action in burning mouth 
      syndrome (BMS). The purpose of this 8-week, single-blind study was to provide
      preliminary data on the efficacy and tolerability of amisulpride and the
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) paroxetine and sertraline for
      patients with BMS. METHOD: Seventy-six patients with BMS (diagnosed according to 
      the criteria in the literature and integrating the Diagnostic Interview
      Schedule-Revised for a complete psychiatric assessment), with no possible local
      or systemic causes and without concurrent major depression, were randomly
      assigned to receive amisulpride (50 mg/day), paroxetine (20 mg/day), or
      sertraline (50 mg/day). Efficacy assessments included a visual analogue scale
      (VAS) for pain intensity, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), the
      Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A), and the Clinical Global Impressions
      scale (CGI). RESULTS: All 3 treatment regimens resulted in a significant
      improvement from baseline in burning mouth symptoms at week 8 as demonstrated by 
      the quantitative (mean reduction in VAS, HAM-D, and HAM-A scores) and qualitative
      (percentage of responders) analyses. Amisulpride showed a shorter response
      latency than the SSRIs. No serious adverse events were reported, and the
      incidence of side effects did not differ among the 3 groups. None of the patients
      who received amisulpride withdrew from the trial, whereas withdrawal from the
      trial occurred within the first week of treatment in 11.5% of patients (N = 3)
      treated with paroxetine and in 21.7% of patients (N = 5) treated with sertraline.
      CONCLUSION: The data suggest that amisulpride and SSRIs may be effective
      treatments for BMS; they are equally effective and equally well tolerated in the 
      short-term treatment of BMS. Amisulpride is associated with better compliance
      within the first week of treatment and with a shorter response latency in
      comparison with SSRIs. This finding may indicate that amisulpride is especially
      useful at the beginning of drug therapy of BMS. Double-blind, placebo-controlled 
      trials are needed to further document the efficacy of amisulpride and SSRIs in
      the treatment of BMS.

TI  - Common emergent pediatric neurologic problems.
PG  - 155-76
AB  - Although there are a variety of neurologic disease processes that the emergency
      physician should be aware of the most common of these include seizures, closed
      head injury, headache, and syncope. When one is evaluating a patient who has had 
      a seizure, differentiating between febrile seizures, afebrile seizures, and SE
      helps to determine the extent of the work-up. Febrile seizures are typically
      benign, although a diagnosis of meningitis must not be missed. Educating parents 
      regarding the likelihood of future seizures, and precautions to be taken should a
      subsequent seizure be witnessed, is important. The etiology of a first-time
      afebrile seizure varies with the patient's age at presentation, and this
      age-specific differential drives the diagnostic work-up. A follow-up EEG is often
      indicated, and imaging studies can appropriate on a nonurgent basis. Appropriate 
      management of SE requires a paradigm of escalating pharmacologic therapy, and
      early consideration of transport for pediatric intensive care services if the
      seizure cannot be controlled with conventional three-tiered therapy. Closed head 
      injury frequently is seen in the pediatric emergency care setting. The absence of
      specific clinical criteria to guide the need for imaging makes management of
      these children more difficult. A thorough history and physical examination is
      important to uncover risk factors that prompt emergent imaging. Headaches are
      best approached by assessing the temporal course, associated symptoms, and the
      presence of persistent neurologic signs. Most patients ultimately are diagnosed
      with either a tension or migraine headache; however, in those patients with a
      chronic progressive headache course, an intracranial process must be addressed
      and pursued with appropriate imaging. Syncope has multiple causes but can
      generally be categorized as autonomic, cardiac, or noncardiac. Although vasovagal
      syncope is the most common cause of syncope, vigilance is required to identify
      those patients with a potentially fatal arrhythmia or with heart disease that
      predisposes to hypoperfusion. As such, all patients who present with syncope
      should have an ECG. Additional work-up studies are guided by the results of
      individual history and physical examination.

TI  - Lansoprazole: pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and clinical uses.
PG  - 1663-70
AB  - Lansoprazole (Prevacid, TAP Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) is a substituted benzimidazole
      that inhibits gastric acid secretion. This agent is approved for the short-term
      treatment of erosive reflux oesophagitis, active gastric ulcer, active duodenal
      ulcer and the treatment of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced
      gastric and duodenal ulcers. It is also approved for the long-term treatment of
      healed reflux oesophagitis, healed duodenal ulcer, the treatment of
      hypersecretory conditions such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and the eradication 
      of Helicobacter pylori as a component of triple therapy with lansoprazole,
      clarithromycin and amoxicillin, or dual therapy with lansoprazole and
      amoxicillin. Its mechanism of action is to selectively inhibit the membrane
      enzyme H+/K+ ATPase in gastric parietal cells. In clinical trials, lansoprazole
      is more effective than placebo or histamine (H2)-receptor antagonists in the
      treatment of reflux oesophagitis. Lansoprazole administered at a dose of 30 mg
      daily produced faster relief of symptoms and superior healing rates in patients
      with gastric or duodenal ulcers or reflux oesophagitis than H2-receptor
      antagonists. A daily dose of 30 mg lansoprazole reduced epigastric pain faster
      than omeprazole 20 mg daily in patients with peptic ulcer disease but healing
      rates at 4 and 8 weeks were similar with both agents at these dosages.
      Lansoprazole was more effective than H2-receptor antagonists in patients with
      Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and produced similar treatment outcome to omeprazole. 
      Lansoprazole in combination with clarithromycin and amoxicillin produced similar 
      rates of eradication of H. pylori. In clinical trials, lansoprazole is
      well-tolerated and has a low frequency of side effects similar to that of
      H2-receptor antagonists or omeprazole.

TI  - Neurologic complications including paralysis after a medication error involving
      implanted intrathecal catheters.
PG  - 31-6
AB  - PURPOSE: Long-term continuous intrathecal infusion of medications for chronic
      medical problems is common. We investigated the cause of a cluster of severe
      neurologic complications in patients with intrathecal catheters. METHODS: We
      performed an epidemiologic cohort study of patients who had intrathecal catheters
      in place in one neurosurgical practice, to assess the presence of new neurologic 
      complications and associated risk factors. RESULTS: The practice included 61
      patients who received pain medication through implanted intrathecal catheter
      pumps, 19 of whom were treated with morphine, either alone or in combination with
      other medications. None of the 42 patients whose drug regimen did not include
      morphine developed a complication, whereas 8 of 13 patients who received morphine
      in refills of their pumps during one 4-week period experienced neurologic
      complications. Three persons underwent laminectomy for sterile abscesses and were
      left with new paralysis or leg weakness. Testing of two stock bottles from the
      involved pharmacy, both labeled as containing pure morphine, revealed the
      presence of methadone in addition to morphine. One of these bottles also
      contained trace ethanol. A sample of medication aspirated from the pump of a
      patient prescribed morphine from the same pharmacy was also found to have
      contained methadone and methanol. CONCLUSIONS: A variety of severe neurologic
      complications was associated with inadvertent administration of methadone, and
      perhaps other unintended substances, by means of implanted intrathecal catheters 
      to a group of patients. Medical errors in an outpatient pharmacy led to this
      outbreak.

TI  - Perspectives on the use of anticonvulsants in the treatment of bipolar disorder.
PG  - 421-46
AB  - The authors reviewed the available literature on the efficacy of carbamazepine,
      valproate, and other newer anticonvulsants for the treatment of bipolar disorder.
      A comprehensive Medline search was conducted, and all uncontrolled and controlled
      reports on anticonvulsants used for the treatment of bipolar patients were
      identified. Carbamazepine and valproate have been shown to be effective in the
      acute treatment of bipolar disorder, and are the first-choice treatments for
      lithium-refractory patients. While the efficacy of these drugs in the acute
      treatment of the illness has been satisfactorily documented, double-blind
      randomized studies are still necessary to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of
      both anticonvulsants. Patients on a mixed state and rapid cyclers seem to respond
      better to valproate and carbamazepine than to lithium. The preliminary data
      evaluating the efficacy of newer anticonvulsants, such as gabapentin,
      lamotrigine, and topiramate in bipolar patients is still limited, but some of the
      available findings are promising, and these new agents may represent appropriate 
      third choices for refractory bipolar individuals. Double-blind, controlled
      studies with the newer anticonvulsants are still largely unavailable, and it will
      be necessary to evaluate their acute and prophylactic mood-stabilizing effects.
      The prospects for future therapeutic advances in this area are also discussed.

TI  - Social functioning and quality of life in the schizophrenic patient: advantages
      of amisulpride.
PG  - 1-8
AB  - Schizophrenia is associated with significant social, psychological and
      occupational dysfunction. Not only is this distressing for the patients and their
      family and friends, but it also results in high indirect costs. Reintegration
      back into society, one of the most important aspects of quality life for
      schizophrenic patients and their physicians, must therefore take into account a
      patient's social functioning and employability, as well as improvement in
      symptoms. Although the typical antipsychotics are effective in managing the
      positive symptoms of schizophrenia, they may not alleviate other aspects of the
      disorder. They are also associated with extrapyramidal symptoms and other severe 
      adverse events that have significant consequences for quality of life and
      compliance. The atypical antipsychotic, amisulpride, has an improved safety and
      tolerability profile and has been shown to be significantly more effective than
      placebo and haloperidol on a number of quality of life and social functioning
      scales, including the Global Assessment of Functioning, the Quality of Life
      Scale, the Functional Status Questionnaire and the Psychosocial Aptitude Rating
      Scale. In conclusion, amisulpride, in addition to its proven clinical efficacy,
      may help reintegration of the schizophrenic patient back into society.

TI  - Delirium associated with zolpidem.
PG  - 1562-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report a case of an elderly woman sustaining an episode of delirium
      after one dose of zolpidem. CASE SUMMARY: An 86-year-old white woman was admitted
      to the hospital for headaches and diplopia. On hospital day 3, the patient
      received zolpidem 5 mg and, approximately two hours later, became restless,
      disoriented, and physically agitated. She was treated with haloperidol and was
      restrained for her safety. The patient's symptoms resolved by day 5, and she had 
      no recollection of the incident. No rechallenge was attempted. DISCUSSION:
      Pharmacokinetic factors may play an important role in zolpidem-induced adverse
      drug reactions. Elderly women can achieve up to a 63% higher serum concentration 
      than men. The patient in our report had factors such as age, gender, and
      hypoalbuminemia, which may have increased the maximum concentration and the AUC
      of zolpidem and possibly increased her risk of an adverse reaction. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This case, along with previous reports, warrants the cautious use of zolpidem.
      Clinicians should be aware that a majority of these reactions occur in women. It 
      appears that the reactions are concentration dependent, therefore, dosage
      reductions should be made in elderly patients and those with hepatic
      insufficiency.

TI  - Human "autotomy".
PG  - 187-9
AB  - We describe two cases of self-injurious behaviour. One was a man with central
      post-stroke pain with maximal pain in the tip of the nose, who excavated his ala 
      nasae--in which he subsequently continued to experience phantom pain. The second 
      case a man who, following ophthalmic herpes zoster and possibly mild postherpetic
      neuralgia. He subsequently scratched his anaesthetic forehead down to the bone,
      while denying he experienced any pain. We would describe the first case as one of
      true autotomy; but the second as destruction of an anaesthetic part of the body. 
      The implications for human and animal physiopathology are discussed.

TI  - Post-traumatic stress disorder: a review of psychobiology and pharmacotherapy.
PG  - 411-22
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on the psychobiology and pharmacotherapy of
      PTSD. METHODS: Relevant studies were identified by literature searches (Pub-med, 
      Web of Science) and through reference lists. The search was ended by May 2001.
      RESULTS: There is evidence of involvement of opioid, glutamatergic, GABAergic,
      noradrenergic, serotonergic and neuroendocrine pathways in the pathophysiology of
      PTSD. Medications shown to be effective in double-blind placebo-controlled trials
      includes selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, reversible and irreversible
      MAO-inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants and the anticonvulsant lamotrigine.
      Still more agents appear promising in open-label trials. CONCLUSION: The
      complexity of the psychobiology is reflected by the difficulties in treating the 
      disorder. According to the present knowledge, suggestions for drug treatment of
      PTSD are made.

TI  - The biopsychosocial model and spinal cord injury.
PG  - 644-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To highlight the importance of taking the psychological, social and
      biological aspects into consideration when dealing with somatic complaints of
      spinal cord injured patients. SETTING: Supra-regional Spinal Injury Unit in the
      UK. STUDY DESIGN: Case study series. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The somatic complaints
      of four patients with spinal cord injury were assessed and their relationship to 
      psychological and social issues were correlated. Two patients suffered
      unexplained pain, another excessive spasm uncontrolled with intrathecal Baclofen 
      pump and the fourth with several pressure sores, constipation and other physical 
      problems. The impact of psychosocial issues on the somatic complaints were
      analysed. RESULTS: In all four patients the resolution of their psychosocial
      issues resulted in significant gains vis-a-vis their somatic complaints.
      CONCLUSION: Psychological and social issues of spinal injury patients could have 
      a serious impact on the resolution of somatic complaints. It is important to take
      these into consideration in their treatment.

TI  - Right versus left prefrontal transcranial magnetic stimulation for
      obsessive-compulsive disorder: a preliminary investigation.
PG  - 981-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is preliminary evidence that repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (rTMS) may be useful for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive
      disorder (OCD), but no definitive study has been published, and the effect of
      laterality of stimulation is uncertain. METHOD: Subjects (N = 12) with resistant 
      OCD were allocated randomly to either right or left prefrontal rTMS daily for 2
      weeks and were assessed by an independent rater at 1 and 2 weeks and 1 month
      later. RESULTS: Subjects had an overall significant improvement in the obsessions
      (p < .01), compulsions (p < .01), and total (p < .01) scores on the Yale-Brown
      Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) after 2 weeks and at 1-month follow-up. This 
      improvement was significant for obsessions (p < .05) and tended to significance
      for total Y-BOCS scores (p = .06) after correction for changes in depression
      scores on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. There was no significant
      difference between right- and left-sided rTMS on any of the parameters examined. 
      Two subjects (33%) in each group showed a clinically significant improvement that
      persisted at I month but with relapse later in I subject. CONCLUSION: A
      proportion (about one quarter) of patients with resistant OCD appear to respond
      to rTMS to either prefrontal lobe, although in the absence of a sham treatment
      group in this study, we cannot rule out the possibility of this being a placebo
      response. This treatment warrants further investigation to better establish its
      efficacy and examine the best parameters for response.

TI  - Diffuse alveolar damage and recurrent respiratory failure: report of 6 cases.
PG  - 1398-402
AB  - We report 6 patients in whom diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) was found on 1 or more
      lung biopsy specimens and who experienced recurrent episodes of acute respiratory
      failure. The patients ranged in age from 43 to 55 years. Two to five episodes of 
      respiratory failure occurred in each over a period of 4 months to 2 years. One
      patient developed evidence of chronic lung disease; while the others remained
      well between episodes. Lung biopsies showed the acute stage of DAD in 3,
      overlapping acute and organizing stages in 3, and the organizing stage in 2. A
      definite cause was not identifiable in any. However, 4 had been treated with
      narcotics for chronic pain before the first episode, and 1 received this
      treatment before the recurrent episode. Three also were receiving psychotropic
      drugs for anxiety and depression. Five patients had evidence of gastroesophageal 
      reflux disease (GERD) and/or hiatal hernia, 2 of whom underwent Nissen
      fundoplication in hopes of preventing future recurrences. Although a definite
      cause of the recurrent DAD was not identified, the findings suggest the
      possibility of a reaction to narcotics and/or psychotropic drugs in some
      patients, with a possible additional effect of GERD. A drug history should be
      carefully elicited in patients with recurrent DAD, and all potentially toxic
      drugs should be stopped.

TI  - Advances in pharmacological treatment of migraine.
PG  - 1831-45
AB  - Migraine is a paroxysmal disorder with attacks of headache, nausea, vomiting,
      photo- and phonophobia and malaise. This review summarises new treatment options 
      both for the therapy of the acute attack as well as for migraine prophylaxis.
      Analgesics like aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are
      effective in treating migraine attacks. Few controlled trials were performed for 
      the use of ergotamine or dihydroergotamine. These trials indicate inferior
      efficacy compared with serotonin (5-HT(1B/D)) agonists (triptans). The triptans
      (almotriptan, eletriptan, frovatriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, sumatriptan and
      zolmitriptan), are highly effective. They improve headache as well as nausea,
      photo- and phonophobia. The different triptans show only minor differences in
      efficacy, headache recurrence and adverse effects. The knowledge of their
      different pharmacological profile allows a more specific treatment of the
      individual migraine characteristics. Migraine prophylaxis is recommended, when
      more than three attacks occur per month, if attacks do not respond to acute
      treatment or if side effects of acute treatment are severe. Substances with
      proven efficacy include the beta-blockers metoprolol and propranolol, the calcium
      channel blocker flunarizine, several 5-HT antagonists and amitriptyline. Recently
      anti-epileptic drugs (valproic acid, gabapentin, topiramate) were evaluated for
      the prophylaxis of migraine. The use of botulinum toxin is under investigation.

PG  - 2193-205
AB  - Along with nausea and vomiting, postanaesthetic shivering is one of the leading

      distinguishing factor during electromyogram recordings between patients with
      postanaesthetic shivering and shivering in fully awake patients is the existence 
      of clonus similar to that recorded in patients with spinal cord transection.
      Clonus coexists with the classic waxing and waning signals associated with
      cutaneous vasoconstriction (thermoregulatory shivering). The primary cause of
      postanaesthetic shivering is peroperative hypothermia, which sets in because of
      anaesthetic-induced inhibition of thermoregulation. However, shivering associated
      with cutaneous vasodilatation (non-thermoregulatory shivering) also occurs, one
      of the origins of which is postoperative pain. Apart from causing discomfort and 
      aggravation of pain, postanaesthetic shivering increases metabolic demand
      proportionally to the solicited muscle mass and the cardiac capacity of the
      patient. No link has been demonstrated between the occurrence of shivering and an
      increase in cardiac morbidity, but it is preferable to avoid postanaesthetic
      shivering because it is oxygen draining. Prevention mainly entails preventing
      peroperative hypothermia by actively rewarming the patient. Postoperative skin
      surface rewarming is a rapid way of obtaining the threshold shivering temperature
      while raising the skin temperature and improving the comfort of the patient.
      However, it is less efficient than certain drugs such as meperidine, clonidine or
      tramadol, which act by reducing the shivering threshold temperature.

TI  - Varicella zoster virus. Recent advances in management.
PG  - 2299-304
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide an update on strategies for managing varicella zoster virus
      (VZV) and for preventing and treating established postherpetic neuralgia (PHN).
      QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: Treatment guidelines are based on randomized clinical
      trials. Recommendations concerning other aspects of VZV management (e.g.,
      vaccination) are based mainly on expert opinion. MAIN MESSAGE: Varicella and
      herpes zoster caused by VZV can give rise to serious morbidity and mortality and 
      should be treated. For preventing chickenpox, safe and effective immunization is 
      widely recommended. Treating varicella-exposed seronegative pregnant women
      requires special attention because the virus can harm expectant mothers, fetuses,
      and newborns. The antiviral drugs, acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir, have
      been approved for treating herpes zoster and have a role in reducing the duration
      of PHN. Established PHN can be managed with analgesics, tricyclic
      antidepressants, and other agents. CONCLUSION: Vaccination and antiviral and
      other systemic agents can substantially reduce the morbidity associated with VZV 
      infection.

TI  - The first world report of botulinum A toxin injection for status migrainosus.
PG  - 1199-203
AB  - The author reports the first ever documented publication in the world concerning 
      the use of botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) injection for status migrainosus. A 58-year 
      old man had been suffering from migraine without aura for 20 years. This last
      attack (a very severe throbbing headache) started over the left side of his head 
      and he had tried several medications (paracetamol, aspirin, ergotamine, mefenamic
      acid, and diazepam) during the attack to no vail. Physical examination revealed
      an acutely ill patient with an agonizing pain condition. General and neurological
      examinations were normal. BTX-A solution was then injected into the Fung Chou
      point (classical Chinese acupuncture point for migraine) in the total amount of
      25 international unit. Dramatic response was observed within 1 hour of injection 
      and status migrainosus was abort within 10 hours. He was headache-free and had no
      further attack of migraine for another 2 months.

TI  - Management of chronic pain in children.
PG  - 476-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the demography, clinical characteristics, treatment,
      functional limitations and outcomes of patients referred to a paediatric
      multidisciplinary pain clinic. DESIGN: Prospective data collection, descriptive
      study. PATIENTS AND SETTING: Tertiary referral centre pain clinic (Royal
      Children's Hospital, Melbourne) over two years (March 1998 - March 2000). MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Pain profile; functional disability (school absenteeism, sleep 
      disturbance and inability to perform sport); treatments received; outcome.
      RESULTS: 207 patients (mean age, 13.1 years; 73% females; 29% rural residents)
      were referred in the two years. Concomitant medical conditions were present in
      106/207 (51%) patients, the commonest being cerebral palsy or spasticity (22
      patients) and malignancy (18). Complex regional pain syndrome was diagnosed in 44
      patients. Functional disability due to pain included school absenteeism (95% of
      school attenders), sleep disruption (71% of all patients) and inability to
      perform sport (90% of those able to participate in sport previously). Of the 105 
      patients who missed five or more days of school because of pain, 93 attended
      school regularly after treatment. Sleep disturbance improved in 129/146 (88%)
      patients, and 129/147 (88%) resumed sporting activity after multidisciplinary
      intervention. Outcome was classified as good in 134 patients (65%), moderate in
      32 (15%) and poor in 16 (8%). CONCLUSIONS: Chronic pain in children and
      adolescents often results in considerable functional disability. Functional
      improvement can be achieved using a multidisciplinary approach to pain management
      in children.

TI  - Successful treatment of myasthenia gravis with tacrolimus.
PG  - 111-4
AB  - Tacrolimus (FK-506) is a calcium-calcineurin inhibitor, successfully used in
      transplant recipients. We report the successful use of tacrolimus as a single
      immunosuppressant in a patient who had developed myasthenia gravis (MG) during
      interferon alpha treatment. In this case, the coexistence of hepatitis C and type
      2 diabetes mellitus contraindicated the use of both steroids and azathioprine,
      and cyclosporine A, although effective, had induced renal failure. Tacrolimus
      proved to be effective in the treatment of MG, was not significantly hepatotoxic,
      and was less nephrotoxic than cyclosporine.

AB  - We report on a 28-year-old woman with insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus with a 
      5-year history of progressive stiffness and painful spasms of the right leg,
      exaggerated by sudden auditory and tactile stimuli or by emotional stress. There 
      were no signs of truncal rigidity or exaggerated lumbar lordosis. Anti-glutamic
      acid decarboxylase antibodies were positive in her serum. She improved
      substantially with clonazepam 4 mg/day. She presented with electrophysiological
      findings not previously reported in stiff leg syndrome, which may suggest
      increased inhibition in the uninvolved upper extremities.

TI  - Long-term follow-up on restless legs syndrome patients treated with opioids.
PG  - 1105-9
AB  - The medical records of 493 patients with restless legs syndrome (RLS) from three 
      major centers were studied to determine the number and outcome of patients who
      had been treated with opioids as a monotherapy. At one time or another 113
      patients (51 men, 62 women; age range, 37-88 years) had been on opioid therapy
      either alone (36 patients) or with opioids added secondarily to other medications
      used to treat RLS (77 patients). Twenty-three of the 36 opioid monotherapy
      patients had failed dopaminergic and other therapeutic agents prior to the
      initiation of opioid monotherapy. Twenty of the 36 opioid monotherapy patients
      continue on monotherapy for an average of 5 years 11 months (range, 1-23 years), 
      despite their knowledge of the availability of other therapies. Of the 16
      patients who discontinued opioids as a sole therapy, the medication was
      discontinued in only one case because of problems related to addiction and
      tolerance. Polysomnography on seven patients performed after an average of 7
      years 1 month of opioid monotherapy (range, 1-15 years) showed a tendency toward 
      an improvement in all leg parameters and associated arousals (decrease in PLMS
      index, PLMS arousal index, and PLM while awake index) as well as all sleep
      parameters (increase in stages 3 and 4 and REM sleep, total sleep time, sleep
      efficiency, and decrease in sleep latency). Two of these seven patients developed
      sleep apnea and a third patient had worsening of preexisting apnea. Opioids seem 
      to have long-term effectiveness in the treatment of RLS and PLMS, but patients on
      long-term opioid therapy should be clinically or polysomnographically monitored
      periodically for the development of sleep apnea.

TI  - In vitro protein binding studies with BMS-204352: lack of protein binding
      displacement interaction in human serum.
PG  - 41-4
AB  - BMS-204352, a maxi-K channel opener, is currently under development for the
      treatment of stroke. Protein binding of BMS-204352 was determined in sera from
      several species, namely, rat, monkey, dog, and human. Data indicated that the
      compound was shown to be highly protein bound in serum from all species (ca.
      99.6%). In order to test for the potential for drug-drug interactions and
      competitive displacement of BMS-204352 by diazepam, phenytoin, propranolol, and
      warfarin, in vitro experiments were performed using spiked human serum and ex
      vivo human plasma samples. Protein binding was determined using equilibrium
      dialysis for 4 h at maximal therapeutic concentrations for each drug alone or in 
      appropriate combination in spiked serum samples. Ex vivo samples from a clinical 
      BMS-204352 study (0, 1, and 24 h) were dialyzed separately after addition of
      diazepam, phenytoin, propranolol, or warfarin. Drug content in biological
      matrices was measured for radioactivity using liquid scintillation counting.
      Results indicated that (1) addition of diazepam, phenytoin, propranolol, or
      warfarin did not alter the free fraction of BMS-204352; (2) BMS-204352 did not
      displace diazepam, phenytoin, propranolol, or warfarin from their protein binding
      sites, and (3) comparison of ex vivo plasma samples after BMS-204352 dosing
      indicated no impact of BMS-204352 and/or its metabolites on the free fraction of 
      diazepam, phenytoin, propranolol, or warfarin. In conclusion, the potential for a
      drug-drug interaction due to alterations in protein binding with BMS-204352 is
      unlikely.

TI  - AUStralian study of titration to effect profile of safety (AUS-STEPS): high-dose 
      gabapentin (neurontin) in partial seizures.
PG  - 1335-9
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and impact on quality of
      life of gabapentin (Neurontin; GBP) as adjunctive therapy in patients with
      refractory partial seizures. METHODS: AUS-STEPS was an open-label, multicenter,
      prospective study in patients experiencing partial seizures who were inadequately
      controlled with one to three concurrent antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). GBP treatment
      was titrated to a maximum of 4,800 mg/day, over a treatment period of 24 weeks,
      to achieve an efficacious and tolerable dosage. Efficacy was assessed by
      seizure-frequency data. Quality of life was evaluated by using the QOLIE-10
      questionnaire, and safety was assessed by adverse-event reports and clinical
      laboratory findings. RESULTS: A total of 176 patients received treatment with
      GBP, with 174 evaluable for intention-to-treat (ITT) efficacy analysis. A
      reduction of >50% in overall seizure frequency was observed in 93 patients (53%).
      There was a small (4.6%) overall improvement in QOLIE-10 score. The most frequent
      adverse events were dizziness (31%), fatigue (29%), somnolence (27%), headache
      (21%), and ataxia (20%), with no major increase seen in adverse events
      necessitating discontinuation as the dose of GBP was titrated upward.
      CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that patients with partial epilepsy may be
      effectively treated with GBP at dosages of < or =4,800 mg/day, without altering
      the safety profile of the drug.

TI  - Third-generation antidepressants: do they offer advantages over the SSRIs?
PG  - 941-54
AB  - Third-generation antidepressants are a group of antidepressant agents of variable
      action, not confined to serotonin reuptake inhibition. These agents include
      venlafaxine, reboxetine, nefazodone and mirtazapine. Claims have been made for
      these agents in terms of improved efficacy, faster speed of onset of effect and
      greater safety in the treatment of depression compared with previous medications,
      such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). This article reviews
      the evidence for these improvements. Thirty active comparator studies were
      reviewed involving the third-generation antidepressant agents. While there were
      isolated reports of improvements over comparator agents for venlafaxine,
      reboxetine and mirtazepine, there were no convincing differences between
      third-generation agents and comparators in terms of overall efficacy, relapse
      prevention and speed of onset. The third-generation antidepressants were,
      however, of equivalent safety to SSRIs and maintained improvements in safety over
      first-generation agents.

TI  - Botulinum treatment of spasticity: why is it so difficult to show a functional
      benefit?
PG  - 771-6
AB  - Clinical experience seems to indicate that botulinum toxin injections can, in
      selected patients with upper motor neurone syndrome, reduce spasticity and
      improve voluntary movement and active function. However, double-blind
      placebo-controlled trials have had difficulty showing active functional
      improvement, despite the clear ability of botulinum toxin to reduce spasticity.
      This prompts a re-analysis of the basic assumption that spasticity impairs
      voluntary movement and a review of the methodology of the clinical trials. Motor 
      dysfunction is usually caused by weakness and the other "negative" features of
      upper motor neurone syndrome, rather than muscle overactivity. Recent research
      has explored the pathophysiological basis of the voluntary movement disorder, in 
      particular the role of the various forms of motor overactivity, which might be
      amenable to botulinum toxin treatment. The failure of double-blind
      placebo-controlled clinical trials to show improvement in active function is, to 
      a large extent, a result of their methodology, especially patient selection,
      injection protocols, and the choice of outcome measures. Clinical trials need to 
      be re-designed and based upon expert experience and a better understanding of the
      pathophysiology of the motor disorder.

TI  - Intractable depression or psychosis.
PG  - 402-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Some patients with treatment resistant depression may have a difficult
      to recognize and therefore untreated thought disorder. Even a subtle disorder may
      significantly impact patients' lives. This case illustrates a mechanism for
      identifying and treating this subgroup of patients. METHOD: The treatment of a
      67-year-old female with intractable depression is described. RESULTS: The
      Rorschach Exner Comprehensive System identified the presence of a thought
      disorder with four out of five conditions positive on the Schizophrenia Index and
      five out of seven conditions positive on the Depression Index. Low-dose
      risperidone was added to the patient's medications with excellent results.
      Post-testing indicated that the Schizophrenia and Depression Indices were no
      longer positive. CONCLUSION: A subgroup of patients with intractable depression
      may have an underlying thought disorder that can be identified with the Rorschach
      and successfully treated with low-dose antipsychotic medication.

TI  - Spasticity: a rehabilitation challenge in the elderly.
PG  - 295-9
AB  - There is no doubt that spasticity is a significant cause of disability in the
      elderly. Regrettably, it is a condition that is often poorly treated and can
      result in a range of unnecessary complications which can cause further problems
      for the disabled person and their family. There are now a number of effective
      treatment options. However, before such options are defined the specific goals of
      rehabilitation need to be clarified and an appropriate outcome measure chosen in 
      order to determine when such goals are being met. The treatment should be
      multidisciplinary and input from both the physician and a physiotherapist is
      essential. Involvement of the elderly person with spasticity, and often their
      family, is also important in the education process. Simple physiotherapy
      interventions can be remarkably helpful, including attention to positioning and
      seating. The role of the physician initially focuses on oral medication. Although
      we still have older drugs including diazepam, baclofen and dantrolene there are
      now more modern drugs including tizanidine and, more recently, gabapentin.
      However, most spasticity is focal in origin and thus requires focal treatment.
      Although phenol nerve blocks are sometimes helpful the use of botulinum toxin is 
      now to be highly recommended. There is now clear evidence of the efficacy of
      botulinum toxin, which has been a significant advance in our management of
      spasticity. More advanced and difficult to treat problems can be alleviated by
      intrathecal baclofen or sometimes intrathecal phenol or, as a last resort,
      surgical intervention. The advent of lycra garments for the overall management of
      more diffuse spasticity is now becoming both fashionable and effective.
      Conclusion: The management of spasticity in the elderly person is a significant
      challenge to the rehabilitation team and a combined approach can produce
      significant benefit for the disabled elderly person.

TI  - Amprenavir: new preparation. Another HIV protease inhibitor: no proven advance.
PG  - 70-2
AB  - (1) The reference antiretroviral treatment for HIV-infected patients is a
      three-drug regimen combining drugs from different families, namely two nucleoside
      reverse transcriptase inhibitors + a protease inhibitor or a non nucleoside
      reverse transcriptase inhibitor. In our opinion, indinavir is the first-choice
      protease inhibitor. (2) The clinical file on amprenavir is limited. In
      particular, it is not known whether the recommended dose regimen (1 200 mg twice 
      a day) is the best one. A 48-week trial involving 232 patients previously
      untreated with antiretrovirals showed that the combination of amprenavir (1 200
      mg) + lamivudine (150 mg) + zidovudine (300 mg), administered twice a day, was
      more effective than lamivudine + zidovudine on viral load. (3) An unblinded trial
      involving 504 patients, who had already received a reverse transcriptase
      inhibitor but no protease inhibitor, compared three-drug regimens consisting of
      amprenavir (1 200 mg twice a day) and two reverse transcriptase inhibitors, or
      indinavir (800 mg three times a day) and two reverse transcriptase inhibitors,
      for 48 weeks. Changes in viral load and the CD4+ lymphocyte count did not favour 
      the amprenavir-containing regimen. (4) Laboratory studies suggest that the risk
      of cross-resistance between amprenavir and other HIV protease inhibitors is lower
      than with other compounds of this class. However, it is unclear whether this
      means that amprenavir would be clinically effective after failure of one or
      several other protease inhibitors. (5) The main adverse effects of amprenavir are
      gastrointestinal disorders and paraesthesias. Overall, the safety profile
      resembles that of the other protease inhibitors. (6) Like other protease
      inhibitors, amprenavir can potentially interact with many other drugs, owing to
      its hepatic metabolism. (7) Amprenavir is taken in two daily doses irrespective
      of meal times, but this advantage over other protease inhibitors is cancelled out
      by the fact that patients have to swallow 8 large soft capsules at each intake.
      (8) In our opinion, pending further data, amprenavir should be used only in
      well-conducted clinical trials.

AB  - For patients without a specific diagnosis, treatment of low back pain begins with
      strategies to avoid re-injury and exacerbation. Most patients benefit from some
      form of medical therapy, guided by the three-step World Health Organization
      analgesic ladder. Opioid therapy is appropriate when needed for low back pain,
      especially in the acute period. Adjuvant medication (eg, an anticonvulsant or
      antidepressant) may help reduce or eliminate the need for opioid therapy. Side
      effects are common with opioid medications, although many resolve with time.
      Patient education in exercise, back protection, nutrition, and sexual concerns is
      an important component of treatment. Some patients may benefit from referral to a
      pain center for multidisciplinary management. Those with a structural or
      mechanical cause of pain may do well with surgery.

TI  - Cushing syndrome induced by serial occipital nerve blocks containing
      corticosteroids.
PG  - 902-4
AB  - A patient with chronic daily headaches developed overt signs of Cushing syndrome 
      during treatment with serial occipital nerve block injections. Investigation
      demonstrated an exogenous source of corticosteroids as the cause of the Cushing
      syndrome in this patient, thus, implicating the corticosteroid component of the
      occipital nerve blocks. To our knowledge, this is the first report of Cushing
      syndrome caused by occipital nerve blockade. Caution is warranted in employing
      even usual therapeutic doses of synthetic corticosteroids, particularly in
      long-acting or depot preparations.

TI  - West syndrome--The University of Hong Kong experience (1970-2000).
PG  - 609-15
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical pattern of West syndrome (WS) in a university
      based hospital. METHODOLOGY: The database of children seen in the Epilepsy Clinic
      of Queen Mary Hospital and Duchess of Kent Children's Hospital during a 30-year
      period (1970-2000) was reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 105 cases had WS (1.9%). The
      number of new cases of WS admitted per year ranged from one to eight. The range
      of annual incidence of WS to newly diagnosed epilepsy was 0.8-4.8%. The etiology 
      included idiopathic (N=19, 18%), cryptogenic (N=23; 22%), symptomatic (N=56;
      53.3%) and unknown (N=7; 5.7%). Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and/or
      prednisone were given to 42 children (40%). Most were effective in controlling WS
      on an all-or-none fashion. Seizure outcome included 12 with remission, persistent
      in the same form in two and persisting but changed to another form in the rest.
      Neurological outcome at the last follow up in 2000 December included multiple
      disabilities (N=16), cerebral palsy (N=22), mental retardation (N=94) and
      Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (N=13). We analysed the following risk factors in
      relation to poor outcome: age of onset, age of presentation, time lag before
      treatment, etiology, family history of epilepsy and hormonal treatment. Only
      etiology of WS has a positive correlation with poor outcome (P<0.0005).
      CONCLUSIONS: WS is an uncommon epileptic syndrome. The majority had poor outcome,
      especially those with causes identified. Infantile spasm is a specific epileptic 
      phenomenon in a maturational stage of a child when heterogeneous disorders can
      present with the same clinical epileptic and electroencephalographic phenomenon.

TI  - Epidemiology of West syndrome in Singapore.
PG  - 584-5
AB  - The incidence of West syndrome (WS) was determined by a search of reports of
      electroencephalograms (EEG) recorded in 1998 and 1999 in all public hospitals in 
      Singapore. Amongst records of patients born in 1998, nine were found with EEG
      features of hypsarrhythmia or modified hypsarrhythmia with onset of seizures
      between January 1,1998 and December 31, 1999. The medical records of these
      patients were reviewed. The population of children born in 1998 was 43,664. In
      1998 and 1999, 67% of all hospital admissions for patients 2 years or younger in 
      Singapore were in public hospitals. The cumulative incidence of WS in Singapore
      corrected for the percentage of hospital admissions to public hospitals was
      3.1/10,000 live births. The corrected cumulative incidences in Chinese, Malays
      and Indians were 2.7, 3.1 and 3.3 per 10,000, respectively. Three cases were
      idiopathic; three were due to congenital structural lesions of the brain; one
      each had periventricular leucomalacia, intracranial hemorrhage and severe
      intrauterine growth retardation. None of the patients were normal at follow up.
      The three patients with idiopathic WS had mild global developmental delay and the
      other six cases had cerebral palsy and severe mental retardation. With the best
      modern medical treatment, possibly only two of the nine cases of WS may have been
      prevented.

TI  - Lansoprazole: an update of its place in the management of acid-related disorders.
PG  - 1801-33
AB  - Lansoprazole is an inhibitor of gastric acid secretion and also exhibits
      antibacterial activity against Helicobacter pylori in vitro. Current therapy for 
      peptic ulcer disease focuses on the eradication of H. pylori infection with
      maintenance therapy indicated in those patients who are not cured of H. pylori
      and those with ulcers resistant to healing. Lansoprazole 30 mg combined with
      amoxicillin 1g, clarithromycin 250 or 500mg, or metronidazole 400 mg twice daily 
      was associated with eradication rates ranging from 71 to 94%, and ulcer healing
      rates were generally >80% in well designed studies. In addition, it was as
      effective as omeprazole- or rabeprazole-based regimens which included these
      antimicrobial agents. Maintenance therapy with lansoprazole 30 mg/day was
      significantly more effective than either placebo or ranitidine in preventing
      ulcer relapse. Importantly, preliminary data suggest that lansoprazole-based
      eradication therapy is effective in children and the elderly. In the short-term
      treatment of patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), lansoprazole
      15, 30 or 60 mg/day was significantly more effective than placebo, ranitidine 300
      mg/day or cisapride 40 mg/day and similar in efficacy to pantoprazole 40 mg/day
      in terms of healing of oesophagitis. Lansoprazole 30 mg/day, omeprazole 20 mg/day
      and pantoprazole 40 mg/day all provided similar symptom relief in these patients.
      In patients with healed oesophagitis. 12-month maintenance therapy with
      lansoprazole 15 or 30 mg/day prevented recurrence and was similar to or more
      effective than omeprazole 10 or 20 mg/day. Available data in patients with
      NSAID-related disorders or acid-related dyspepsia suggest that lansoprazole is
      effective in these patients in terms of the prevention of NSAID-related
      gastrointestinal complications, ulcer healing and symptom relief. Meta-analytic
      data and postmarketing surveillance in >30,000 patients indicate that
      lansoprazole is well tolerated both as monotherapy and in combination with
      antimicrobial agents. After lansoprazole monotherapy commonly reported adverse
      events included dose-dependent diarrhoea, nausea/vomiting, headache and abdominal
      pain. After short-term treatment in patients with peptic ulcer, GORD, dyspepsia
      and gastritis the incidence of adverse events associated with lansoprazole was
      generally < or = 5%. Similar adverse events were seen in long-term trials,
      although the incidence was generally higher (< or = 10%). When lansoprazole was
      administered in combination with amoxicillin, clarithromycin or metronidazole
      adverse events included diarrhoea, headache and taste disturbance. In conclusion,
      lansoprazole-based triple therapy is an effective treatment option for the
      eradication of H. pylori infection in patients with peptic ulcer disease.
      Preliminary data suggest it may have an important role in the management of this 
      infection in children and the elderly. In the short-term management of GORD,
      lansoprazole monotherapy offers a more effective alternative to histamine
      H2-receptor antagonists and initial data indicate that it is an effective
      short-term treatment option in children and adolescents. In adults lansoprazole
      maintenance therapy is also an established treatment option for the long-term
      management of this chronic disease. Lansoprazole has a role in the treatment and 
      prevention of NSAID-related ulcers and the treatment of acid-related dyspepsia;
      however, further studies are needed to confirm its place in these indications.
      Lansoprazole has emerged as a useful and well tolerated treatment option in the
      management of acid-related disorders.

TI  - Has basic research contributed to chronic pain treatment?
PG  - 1128-35
AB  - Our understanding of nociceptive processing and of plastic changes after
      persistent noxious input has increased immensely within the last two decades. It 
      is now clear that long-lasting noxious stimulation or damage to the nervous
      system give rise to a neuronal hyperexcitability and that this sensitisation of
      the nervous system plays an important role for development and maintenance of
      chronic pain. The manifestations of such hyperexcitability are numerous and
      include among others: increased neuronal response to a suprathreshold stimulus,
      expansion of the peripheral areas from where a central neurone can be activated
      and the recruitment of previous non-responding nociceptive neurones. Furthermore,
      it has been possible to modulate this neuronal hyperexcitability by the discovery
      of molecular targets for pain, by sequencing DNA of ion channels and receptors
      and by development of new molecules that exert their effects on these molecular
      targets. The changes in responsiveness appear to be partly time and intensity
      dependent and partly dependent on the cause of injury. Whereas relatively
      short-lasting and moderate noxious input leads to reversible plastic changes,
      more intense and long-lasting noxious stimulation implies a risk for persistent
      and more profound alterations in transmitters, receptors, ion channels and in
      neuronal connectivity. Despite the explosion of new knowledge in pain processing 
      and in molecular background for neuroplasticity, this progress has unfortunately 
      not resulted in a corresponding improvement of our ability to treat chronic pain.
      The number of patients with chronic unrelieved pain is still high and newer types
      of treatment have so far not resulted in a substantially better treatment.
      Nevertheless, there is now an ongoing systematic research in which chronic pain
      conditions are assessed in a fashion so that mechanisms underlying pain can be
      dissected. Moreover, controlled clinical trials together with systematic reviews 
      are carried out which in the future should permit formulation of treatment
      algorithms for chronic pain. Finally, it is likely that the development of new
      specific types of treatment will show efficacy if they are evaluated and analysed
      not on the global pain experience, but more specifically on those targets and
      elements of the pain experience they are aimed to deal with.

TI  - Human immunodeficiency virus and the peripheral nervous system workshop.
PG  - 1561-6
AB  - To provide a venue for a comprehensive multidisciplinary review of the current
      state of knowledge regarding the human immunodeficiency virus-associated
      peripheral neuropathies and to provide the institute with guidance in formulating
      future research initiatives, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and
      Stroke (Bethesda, Md) convened a workshop on September 18 through 19, 2000. The
      participants were chosen from various disciplines and included clinicians,
      pathologists, neurobiologists, neurophysiologists, virologists, and
      neuroimmunologists. The present article summarizes the highlights of the meeting 
      and includes the recommendations developed by the participants for future
      research. As might be expected in a rapidly evolving scientific field, the
      meeting was characterized by a lively and far-ranging discussion of data
      interpretation, experimental approaches, and priorities for future research.
      However, the recommendations presented at the end of this article constitute a
      consensus judgment reached by all of the participants of the most important areas
      for future research.

TI  - Sulpiride in the treatment of somatoform disorders: results of a European
      observational study to characterize the responder profile.
PG  - 304-13
AB  - An open, observational study was conducted in five European countries to obtain
      information concerning the profile of patients responding to sulpiride. A total
      of 1,356 patients were evaluable for analysis. The majority of patients (81.1%)
      had at least three principal somatic complaints; asthenia being the most common, 
      followed by dizziness and headache. Most patients (76.0%) were rated as
      moderately to extremely ill according to the Clinical Global Impression (CGI)
      severity score. All patients received oral sulpiride for 3-6 weeks (mean dose,
      175 mg/day). Sulpiride demonstrated good efficacy as shown by a reduction in the 
      incidence and severity of somatic complaints, and an improvement in CGI severity 
      score and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist--58 items. Based on a CGI rating of very 
      much or much improved, 58.2% of patients were rated as responders. Sulpiride was 
      well tolerated. There were no serious adverse events and only 16 patients (1.2%) 
      were withdrawn prematurely from the study due to adverse events. There were no
      differences between the countries regarding the patients' profile or their
      response to sulpiride. Thus, the prescription profile of sulpiride appears not to
      be culturally dependent.

TI  - Review of treatment options for refractory epilepsy: new medications and vagal
      nerve stimulation.
PG  - 17-25
AB  - PURPOSE: the choices available for patients whose partial seizures are poorly
      controlled include seven new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) or vagal nerve
      stimulation (VNS) as add-on therapy. Comparisons are needed to help physicians
      and patients select among the options for treatment. METHODS: we compared
      efficacy and adverse events of new treatments from controlled clinical trials of 
      patients with uncontrolled partial seizures. Response rates (> or =50% decrease
      in partial seizures) at doses recommended in product labeling for adjunct therapy
      were tabulated for overall success (placebo response rate subtracted from AED
      response rate). Adverse events listed in product labeling were tabulated as
      complaint rates (placebo events subtracted from AED events). VNS trials used low 
      dose stimulation as a pseudo-placebo. RESULTS: overall success rates fell into
      two general groups with ranges of 12-20% for gabapentin (GBP), lamotrigine (LTG),
      tiagabine (TGB), zonisamide and 27-29% for levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, and
      topiramate (TPM). Summary Complaint Scores also fell into two general groups with
      ranges of -27 to -82 for GBP, levetiracetam, TGB, zonisamide and -113 to -205 for
      LTG, oxcarbazepine and TPM. VNS scores were in the lower or higher success and
      summary complaint categories depending on whether scores from the pseudo-placebo 
      group were subtracted from the high dose group. CONCLUSIONS: these data allow
      comparisons among AEDs and VNS using similar data from standard types of clinical
      trials.

TI  - A risk-benefit assessment of treatments for infantile spasms.
PG  - 813-28
AB  - Infantile spasms are a devastating epileptic encephalopathy of the young child.
      The continuing spasms and hypsarrhythmia have a deleterious effect on brain
      maturation and further cognitive development. Corticotropin (adrenocorticotropic 
      hormone) or corticosteroids have been the gold standard treatment for the last 40
      years, but there is little agreement on the best agent to use, or the dosage and 
      duration of the treatment. Despite this empirical approach, corticotropin or
      corticosteroids are effective in controlling spasms and normalising
      electroencephalograms in about 60% of cases. The major concern with this
      treatment is the occurrence of frequent and severe adverse effects. The
      introduction of vigabatrin in the 1990s improved the outcome of infantile spasms.
      Vigabatrin shows an efficacy at least equal to that of corticosteroids, and even 
      higher in specific groups such as those with tuberous sclerosis. The major
      advantages of vigabatrin are the ability to initiate treatment at the full
      dosage. rapid efficacy, suitability for outpatient treatment and particularly
      good tolerability with only minor adverse effects. Recently, however, the safety 
      of vigabatrin has caused concern since a specific visual field loss has been
      reported in treated adults. The current problem is determining the risk-benefit
      ratio of vigabatrin and corticosteroids/corticotropin in children with infantile 
      spasms, and to specify the groups where their use could be optimal. Visual field 
      loss is usually asymptomatic and can be detected only by perimetric visual field 
      studies. In children, especially in the young or disabled, it is difficult if not
      impossible to detect the visual field loss and it is not yet known if children
      are at higher or lower risk for this adverse effect. Until a clear answer about
      the occurrence of this adverse effect in children has been established through
      randomised study, vigabatrin may still be considered first-line therapy in
      infantile spasms. Children who do not achieve a good response to vigabatrin
      should be switched to corticotropin/corticosteroid therapy. Despite the efficacy 
      of corticosteroids and vigabatrin, the use of the conventional antiepileptic
      drugs, the newly developed antiepileptic drugs and some promising results with
      ketogenic diet, 25 to 30% of patients with infantile spasms continue to have
      spasms and experience psychomotor regression. These drug-resistant patients could
      be candidates for surgery.

TI  - Intrathecal baclofen for generalized dystonia.
PG  - 652-7
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of intrathecal bacolfen (ITB)
      on patients with severe generalized dystonia. Eighty-six participants ranging in 
      age from 3 to 42 years (median age 13 years) with generalized dystonia refractory
      to oral medications were offered treatment with ITB. Dystonia was associated with
      cerebral palsy in 71% of participants. Response to ITB was tested by continuous
      infusions in 72%, and by bolus injections in 17% of participants who had both
      dystonia and spasticity. Ninety-one percent of participants responded to the
      screening infusion and 93% to the bolus injections. Pumps were implanted in 77
      participants. Dystonia scores at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months were significantly
      decreased (p<0.005) compared with baseline scores. Dystonia scores were
      significantly lower in those with intrathecal catheters positioned at T4, or
      higher than in those with catheters at T6 or lower (p=0.005). Ninety-two percent 
      of participants implanted with a pump retained their responses to ITB during a
      median follow-up of 29 months. Patient questionnaires indicated that quality of
      life and ease of care improved in 86% and speech improved in 33%. Side effects of
      ITB occurred in 26% of participants. Surgical complications occurred in 38% and
      included CSF leaks, infections, and catheter problems. ITB is probably the
      treatment of choice for generalized dystonia if oral medications are ineffective.

TI  - Drug-associated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-hemolytic uremic syndrome.
PG  - 286-93
AB  - Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP-HUS) is an
      inclusive term describing diverse syndromes of multiple etiologies with the
      common features of thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Other 
      organ involvement, including renal failure, neurologic abnormalities, and
      gastrointestinal symptoms, is common. Adverse reactions to drugs increasingly are
      reported as a potential cause of TTP-HUS. More than 50 drugs and other substances
      have been associated with the development of TTP-HUS, but many case reports are
      difficult to interpret because there is uncertainty regarding the diagnosis of
      TTP-HUS and because there is uncertainty regarding the relation of drug exposure 
      to the onset of TTP-HUS. A systematic analysis of reports of drug-associated
      TTP-HUS will be required to better understand the strength of clinical evidence
      linking drugs to the etiology of TTP-HUS. In this review, five drugs that have
      been the subject of the most and the most recent reports of drug-associated
      TTP-HUS are discussed: mitomycin C, cyclosporine, quinine, ticlopidine, and
      clopidogrel. The clinical features of TTP-HUS associated with these drugs are
      different, suggesting two principal mechanisms by which drugs may cause TTP-HUS: 
      dose-related toxicity (mitomycin C, cyclosporine), and immune-mediated reaction
      (quinine, ticlopidine, clopidogrel). The role of plasma exchange is uncertain,
      but this treatment is appropriate because of the high mortality and morbidity of 
      drug-associated TTP-HUS. Recognition of a drug-associated etiology in a patient
      with TTP-HUS is critical to avoid re-exposure and recurrent illness.

TI  - Quinine and cramp: uncertainty efficacy, major risks.
PG  - 154-7
AB  - (1) Simple muscle cramp is a mild condition. It is defined as painful involuntary
      muscle contraction that occurs at rest and resolves spontaneously. (2) Passive
      stretching of the affected muscle relieves cramp. (3) The clinical file on
      quinine in simple cramp is inadequate, being based on small trials with
      conflicting results. (4) Two meta-analysis of comparative cross-over trials
      suggest that the benefit of quinine is negligible in this setting (less than one 
      cramp avoided per week of treatment). (5) Severe and even fatal adverse effects
      have been reported, especially haematological complications such as
      thrombocytopenia, haemolytic anaemia, pancytopenia, and disseminated
      intravascular coagulation. (6) Dose-dependent sensory manifestations of
      cinchonism are far from rare (especially tinnitus). (7) The risk-benefit ratio of
      quinine in cramp is too unfavourable to justify its use.

TI  - Successful use of methadone in the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain arising 
      from burn injuries: a case-study.
PG  - 771-5
AB  - Methadone is used increasingly as a second-line opioid in the management of
      cancer pain refractory to conventional opioids. Recent case studies suggest that 
      its use as an analgesic could be extended to non-cancer pain, especially
      neuropathic pain. The present case study reports, for the first time, the
      efficacy of methadone in a burn patient experiencing neuropathic pain in his
      healed wounds. The patient sustained extensive (55% total body surface area)
      chemical burns and developed chronic burning sensations, particularly in the
      lower limbs where skin grafting had been performed. Conventional
      pharmacotherapies against neuropathic pain were attempted to control pain for
      over 5 years. The agents used included long- and short-acting opioids,
      amitriptyline, clonazepam, and gabapentin, but they all failed to relieve the
      pain. When methadone (5 mg every 12 h) was introduced, it significantly
      alleviated the patient's pain within a few days of administration. The patient
      has now been taking methadone (15 mg every 12 h) for 10 months and reports that
      the opioid caused 70% pain relief and a 55% amelioration in his quality of life. 
      Although these results are based on a case report, they suggest that a switch to 
      methadone might be useful in some burn patients who have developed chronic
      neuropathic pain unrelieved by conventional pharmacotherapies. Methadone,
      however, needs to be titrated with vigilance and thus should be administered by a
      physician experienced with its use in the treatment of chronic pain.

TI  - Dysautonomia syndrome in the acute recovery phase after traumatic brain injury:
      relief with intrathecal Baclofen therapy.
PG  - 917-25
AB  - In the initial phase of severe head injury, dysautonomic abnormalities are
      frequent. Within the framework of a prospective study, evaluating the efficacy of
      continuous intrathecal Baclofen therapy (CIBT) on hypertonia during the initial
      recovery phase of severe head injury, the authors report on the preliminary
      results of this treatment on paroxysmal dysautonomia about four patients.
      Continuous intrathecal Baclofen infusion was first delivered, for a test period, 
      continuously for 6 days. If a relapse of dysautonomia occurred at the end of the 
      test period, an implantation of a continuous intrathecal infusion pump delivering
      Baclofen was performed. Results were assessed with four continuous variables;
      duration (days), dose of Baclofen per day (microg/d), number of dysautonomic
      paroxysmal episodes per day, and initial recovery evaluated by a scale of the
      first initial stages of head injury coma recovery. For three patients: (1) the
      number of dysautonomic paroxysmal episodes per day and the doses of Baclofen
      during the follow-up period were correlated (p = 0.02, p < 0.001, p = 0.008,
      respectively, distribution-free test of Spearman), (2) during the test period and
      the relapse after the test period, the number of paroxysmal episodes and the
      Baclofen dose are correlated to p < 0.05, p = 0.03, p = 0.04, respectively
      (distribution-free test of Spearman). The second statistical test was used to
      prove that Baclofen doses and number of paroxysmal dysautonomic episodes are
      correlated independently of the duration of follow-up. The fourth patient
      improved with CIBT without any recurrence at the end of the treatment test
      period. For the four patients, recovery score increased during the overall
      follow-up. In the authors' experience CIBT is very efficient to control
      paroxysmal dysautonomia during the initial recovery phase in severe head injury, 
      and seems to facilitate recovery.

TI  - Drug-resistant cluster headache responding to gabapentin: a pilot study.
PG  - 744-6
AB  - Prompted by the results of gabaergic drugs, such as valproate and topiramate, we 
      performed this pilot study to assess the effect of gabapentin in cluster
      headache. Eight patients suffering from episodic cluster headache and four
      suffering from chronic cluster headache were studied. All of them had failed to
      respond to traditional prophylactic drugs. The design of the study was an open
      trial. The main parameter for effectiveness was the number of daily attacks.
      Gabapentin was given at the daily dosage of 900 mg. All patients were pain free
      after a maximum of 8 days after starting therapy, with a bout duration thus
      reduced to 16-40% of the average previous bouts (only applies to episodic cluster
      patients). We hypothesize that the gabaergic action of gabapentin, perhaps
      combined with other mechanisms, such as calcium channel blockade, may be
      responsible for its remarkable effects on cluster headache.

TI  - Pre-eclampsia: a predisposing factor for neonatal venous sinus thrombosis?
PG  - 242-6
AB  - Neonatal venous sinus thrombosis is a well-recognized, but infrequently
      diagnosed, cause of neonatal encephalopathy. Previous reports have tended to omit
      reference to the importance of maternal factors in predisposing the infant to
      this condition. This report, in which eight patients with neonatal venous sinus
      thrombosis are presented, will reveal a strong association between pre-eclampsia,
      prothrombotic disorders, and neonatal venous sinus thrombosis. Contrary to
      previously published reports, there is a high likelihood of neurodevelopmental
      residua after this condition.

TI  - Predictors of loud snoring in persons with spinal cord injury.
PG  - 30-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Predictors of loud snoring were examined in a cohort of 197 persons
      with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) recruited by advertisement and from a
      Veterans Affairs Medical Center SCI Service. METHODS: Data were collected on age,
      marital status, antispasticity medications, duration of injury, level and
      completeness of injury, stature, and weight. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated
      for all participants. A health questionnaire was used to collect data on snoring 
      and respiratory history. Habitual snorers were defined as those who reported loud
      snoring more than 1 night per week. RESULTS: The mean age (+/- SD) was 51.2 +/-
      14.8 years, and 84 of 197 (42.6%) were habitual snorers. The most obese research 
      subjects, regardless of antispasticity medication use, were more likely to report
      snoring, but the risk of snoring was greatest among subjects who were obese and
      used antispasticity medication. Subjects who used antispasticity medication and
      had a BMI above the median (> or = 25.3 kg/m2) had a 7-fold risk of reporting
      snoring compared with subjects below the median who did not use antispasticity
      medication (P = .001). The greatest risk occurred in those who used diazepam
      alone or baclofen and diazepam together and had a BMI at or above the median.
      Subjects who used these medications and had a BMI below the median did not have a
      significantly increased risk. Neurological motor completeness, level of injury,
      age, and years since injury were not significant predictors of snoring.
      CONCLUSION: Because snoring is a marker for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), the
      data suggest that in obese individuals with SCI, the use of antispasticity
      medications may be a risk factor for OSA.

TI  - The tolerability of lamotrigine in elderly patients with epilepsy.
PG  - 621-30
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the tolerability of lamotrigine in elderly patients with 
      epilepsy. DESIGN: Pooled data from 13 lamotrigine clinical trials. SETTING:
      Multicentre clinical trials conducted in primary care and neurology practices.
      PARTICIPANTS: 208 elderly patients (aged > or = 65 years) were identified: 146
      lamotrigine-treated patients, 53 carbamazepine-treated patients and 9
      phenytoin-treated patients. INTERVENTIONS: Extent of exposure, incidence of
      drug-related adverse events, serious adverse events and study withdrawals were
      examined. RESULTS: The median duration of exposure for lamotrigine monotherapy
      and add-on therapy was 24.1 and 47.4 weeks, respectively. The median daily dosage
      of lamotrigine was 100 mg for monotherapy (range 75 to 500 mg) and 300 mg for
      add-on therapy (range 25 to 700 mg). Overall, the incidence of drug-related
      adverse events was lower for lamotrigine than comparator drugs: 49% (72/146) for 
      lamotrigine compared with 72% (38/53) for carbamazepine (p = 0.006), and 89%
      (8/9) for phenytoin (p = 0.035) although patient numbers in each treatment group 
      were not comparable. Patients receiving lamotrigine reported incidences of
      somnolence (p = 0.012), rash (p = 0.034), and headache (nonsignificant) that were
      one-half the incidence reported with carbamazepine monotherapy. Rash was the most
      common reason for study withdrawal: 4% (6/146) lamotrigine, 17% (9/53)
      carbamazepine and 0% phenytoin. Seven (5%, 7/146) lamotrigine-treated patients, 4
      (8%, 4/53) carbamazepine-treated patients and 1 (11%, 1/9) phenytoin-treated
      patient experienced drug-related serious adverse events. CONCLUSION: Lamotrigine,
      used in the currently prescribed adult dosage regimen, was well tolerated in
      elderly patients with epilepsy.

TI  - Systemic adenosine infusions alleviated neuropathic pain.
PG  - 121-2
AB  - A 15-year-old boy suffering from a degenerative neurometabolic disorder was
      treated in a palliative home care unit. Opioid administered by continuous
      intravenous infusion gave excellent relief from headache, muscle pain and pain
      from renal calculi. He continued to complain of burning pain in response to
      tactile stimuli. A prior quantitative sensory test had shown changes in
      sensation. Intravenous adenosine (ADO) infusions were given weekly. After 5 weeks
      of infusions, there was no recurrence of pain between treatments. ADO infusions
      were continued for 7 months without any side effects or signs of tolerance to the
      drug. There are indications that ADO may play a role as a modulator of
      neuropathic and nociceptive pain. In this case with pronounced allodynia, our
      interpretation is that neuropathic mechanisms were responsible and that ADO
      infusions played an important role in controlling pain.

AB  - IMPLICATIONS: Our report describes for the first time the continuous long-term
      intrathecal application of S(+)-ketamine in a patient with chronic pain and
      morphine tolerance. Intrathecally applied S(+)-ketamine led to a significant pain
      reduction and consecutively reduced the doses of intrathecal morphine required
      for pain relief even several weeks after the cessation of the 24-day period of
      intrathecal S(+)-ketamine administration.

TI  - Pregabalin (Pfizer).
PG  - 828-34
AB  - Pfizer is developing pregabalin, a follow-up compound to its GABA agonist
      gabapentin, for the potential treatment of several central nervous system (CNS)
      disorders including epilepsy, neuropathic pain, anxiety and social phobia
      [286425]. By December 2000, Pfizer anticipated filing an NDA for pregabalin for
      seven major indications (beginning with neuropathic pain and add-on epilepsy),
      with the FDA by the end of 2001. Filings for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), 
      social anxiety disorder and fibromyalgia are expected to take place in 2002, and 
      filings for epilepsy monotherapy and panic disorders are expected to take place
      in early- and late-2003, respectively [336918], [393182], [399956]. By January
      2001, pregabalin was in phase II development in Japan for the potential treatment
      of neuropathic pain, with an anticipated approval date of 2005 [394827]. However,
      following analysis by the FDA of a mouse study that showed incidence of a
      specific tumor type, Pfizer announced in February 2001, that it is restricting
      the use of pregablin in some clinical patients [398726] and it has frozen trials 
      for neuropathic pain [398785]. In April 2001, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
      predicted potential sales of $350 million in 2002, rising to $1750 million in
      2006, with peak sales in excess of $2000 million [406923].

TI  - Safinamide (Newron Pharmaceuticals).
PG  - 809-13
AB  - Safinamide (formerly PNU-151774E), a sodium and calcium channel modulator that
      also inhibits monoamine oxidase B (MAOB), is under development by Newron
      Pharmaceuticals for the potential treatment of epilepsy, Parkinson's disease
      (PD), pain and stroke [345222], [348351]. Phase I trials for epilepsy and PD have
      been completed, and dose-finding studies for both indications had commenced in
      March 2001 [401685]. The compound was previously developed by Pharmacia & Upjohn 
      (P&U) for the potential treatment of epilepsy, an indication for which it
      initially reached phase I trials [294891], [345007]. Newron acquired the rights
      to safinamide from P&U at the end of 1998. Results from two phase I trials of the
      compound (single ascending dose and steady state at three doses), completed in
      March 2000, demonstrated that the drug is well tolerated with good
      bioavailability and linear pharmacokinetics [359652].

TI  - Headache evaluation and treatment by primary care physicians in an emergency
      department in the era of triptans.
PG  - 1969-73
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite advances in treatment, patients with migraine have been
      underdiagnosed and undertreated. METHODS: Documentation of visits by patients
      with headache to an urgent care department staffed by primary care physicians was
      reviewed. Patients were also sent a brief headache screen, and those who replied 
      were interviewed by telephone. "Repeaters" (patients who made 3 or more visits in
      6 months) were excluded from chart review. RESULTS: Over 6 months, 518 patients
      made 1004 visits to the emergency department for primary headache complaints: 464
      patients (90%) made 1 or 2 visits (total visits, 502). A review of 174 charts
      documenting a diagnosis of migraine found that (1) the need for prophylaxis was
      determined in only 40 (31%) of the patients who were not already undergoing
      prophylaxis and (2) treatment in the emergency department was migraine specific
      in 46 patients (26%) or otherwise appropriate in 45 (25%). A review of 90 charts 
      documenting nonmigraine diagnoses found that 30 patients (33%) had adequate
      history documented to exclude migraine as the diagnosis. Eighty-six patients
      (17%) were interviewed. An emergency department diagnosis of migraine (n = 59)
      corresponded to a final diagnosis of migraine with (n = 21) or without (n = 18)
      medication overuse or chronic daily headache and/or transformed migraine with (n 
      = 18) or without (n = 2) medication overuse. Discharge diagnoses that were not
      migraine (n = 27) had final diagnoses of migraine with (n = 9) or without (n = 9)
      medication overuse or chronic daily headache/transformed migraine with (n = 7) or
      without (n = 2) medication overuse. CONCLUSIONS: In this emergency department
      population, many patients with migraine, chronic daily headache, or medication
      overuse are not accurately diagnosed. The need for prophylaxis is not usually
      assessed. Treatment is migraine specific in the minority of patients.
      Tension-type headache is rarely an accurate diagnosis in this emergency
      department population.

TI  - The effect of a dopamine agonist on dysarthric speech production: a case study.
PG  - 397-414
AB  - The effect of Permax (pergolide mesylate), a dopamine agonist, was assessed in an
      individual with traumatic brain injury. The participant evidenced symptoms of
      hypokinetic dysarthria. His performance on and off Permax was evaluated in a BABA
      design. Measures were obtained across physiological systems. There were few
      differences in the on and off conditions. In the on condition, he evidenced an
      abnormally large velopharyngeal orifice area, dysfluencies in stimulus sentences,
      and less precise articulation. However, listeners perceived him to be more
      animated in the on condition. In addition, he reported better performance in the 
      on condition. The study highlights potential discrepancies among participant
      report, listener perception, and objective measures. Learning outcomes: As a
      result of this activity, the participant will be able (1) to recognize the effect
      of dopamine agonists as an adjunct to other pharmacological interventions and (2)
      to determine potential discrepancies among participant report, listener
      perception and objective physiological and acoustic measures.

TI  - Medical treatment and neuroprotection in traumatic brain injury.
PG  - 1517-32
AB  - The goal of this article is to give an overview about the established current
      treatment concepts of traumatic brain injury, as well as an outlook on possible
      future developments in pharmacological neuroprotection. Modern medical treatment 
      modalities of traumatic brain injury (TBI), including the preclinical management 
      of severely head-injured patients, are reviewed. Since an increased intracranial 
      pressure represents the most common complication of severe traumatic brain
      injury, frequently associated with the development of secondary brain damage,
      special emphasis was given to an updated treatment algorithm for this important
      condition. New insight into the pathophysiology of severe traumatic brain injury,
      especially the realization that brain damage develops sequentially, initiated
      several new treatment approaches aiming at the interruption of pathophysiological
      mechanisms leading to secondary brain injury. A high number of pharmacological
      substances have been tested for their ability to ameliorate secondary damage
      after TBI, or are currently under clinical trial. Although no drug has achieved
      this goal so far, the most promising of these therapeutical approaches, glutamate
      receptor antagonists, calcium channel antagonists, free radical scavengers, and
      cyclosporin A will be discussed in this review. Although a "magical bullet" for
      the treatment of traumatic brain injury has not been developed yet, several of
      the currently investigated neuroprotective strategies seem to be encouraging. A
      promising future approach might be to evaluate treatment strategies that combine 
      several pharmacological agents, and possibly other treatment modalities, such as 
      mild hypothermia, "tailored" according to the special pathology of patient
      subgroups, or even to every single patient in order to achieve an improvement in 
      outcome after TBI.

TI  - Adjunctive agents in the management of chronic pain.
PG  - 1070-81
AB  - Chronic pain syndromes include cancer-related pain, postherpetic neuralgia,
      painful diabetic neuropathy, and central poststroke pain and are common in the
      elderly. Adjunctive (or adjuvant) analgesics, defined as drugs that do not
      contain acetaminophen and those not classified as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory
      or opioid agents, play a role in the management of chronic pain. The term
      "adjunctive" (or "adjuvant") is a misnomer as several of these agents may
      constitute first-line therapy for many chronic pain syndromes. Tricyclic
      antidepressants have formed the backbone of therapy for chronic neuropathic pain 
      for years. However, the difficulty with using agents of this class, due to their 
      clinically significant adverse-event potential, has led to the evaluation of
      other agents, most notably, the antiepileptic drugs. The most useful are
      gabapentin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine. In selected patients, baclofen,
      mexiletine, and clonidine may be useful as well. Cancer-related pain may respond 
      substantially to corticosteroids, and pain associated with bone metastases to
      parenteral bisphosphonates and strontium. Practitioners should consider these
      alternative agents when treating chronic pain.

TI  - Dyspepsia: challenges in diagnosis and selection of treatment.
PG  - 1130-44; discussion 1129
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite considerable study, the pathophysiology of dyspepsia remains 
      obscure. This and other factors have impeded development of precise and effective
      treatment strategies. OBJECTIVE: This paper provides a brief review of the
      clinical syndrome of dyspepsia and its pathophysiology, symptoms, diagnosis, and 
      treatment. METHODS: To identify articles for inclusion in this review, a search
      of MEDLINE was conducted using the key word dyspepsia. Because the literature on 
      this topic is voluminous and duplicative, the search was limited primarily to
      literature from the last decade and to articles concerning dyspepsia in adults.
      RESULTS: The symptoms of dyspepsia, which may include epigastric pain, heartburn.
      bloating, and early satiety, defy diagnosis in as many as 50% of patients, even
      after endoscopy and other appropriate studies. In the other half of patients,
      such causative disorders as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcer 
      disease, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, and gastric cancer may be diagnosed.
      Despite controversy regarding the selection of therapy, empiric treatment is
      common for apparent idiopathic dyspepsia. Histamine2-receptor antagonists, proton
      pump inhibitors (PPIs), promotility agents, and coating agents have all been used
      as empiric therapy for dyspeptic symptoms. With empiric treatment, subsequent
      management is directed by the therapeutic response. In the absence of a
      definitive diagnosis, treatment is usually selected on the basis of the type and 
      severity of symptoms, a thorough history and physical examination, and factors
      such as age and the presence of Helicobacter pylori infection. Five PPIs are
      currently available--lansoprazole, omeprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole, and
      esomeprazole--all with established efficacy in GERD and other acid-mediated
      disorders. The PPIs can be expected to be useful in certain patients with
      dyspepsia, and may be prescribed for patients who are found to re- spond to
      potent antisecretory therapy. Patients' concern about their symptoms, practical
      considerations, and restrictions imposed by managed care organizations may all
      affect the choice between empiric therapy and early endoscopy in patients with
      dyspepsia. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the variety of therapeutic options available for 
      the symptoms of dyspepsia, the many presentations of this condition and the
      uncertainty of the response to the currently available therapeutic options
      continue to pose a substantial clinical challenge.

TI  - Malignant hyperthermia.
PG  - 632-52
AB  - Malignant hyperthermia is an autosomal-dominant inherited disorder of the
      skeletal muscle cell characterized by a hypermetabolic response to all commonly
      used inhalational anaesthetics and depolarizing muscle relaxants. The clinical
      syndrome includes muscle rigidity, hypercapnia, tachycardia and myoglobinuria as 
      result of increased carbon dioxide production, oxygen consumption and muscle
      membrane breakdown. In human beings and animals susceptible to malignant
      hyperthermia, it is generally accepted that an increase in the level of
      myoplasmic free calcium is the cause of the syndrome. Various hypotheses have
      been proposed to account for the increase of intracellular calcium levels, e.g. a
      defect in the calcium release channel of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (ryanodine
      receptor), an abnormality of the excitation-contraction coupling mechanisms, or
      alterations in second messenger systems of skeletal muscles. This review gives an
      overview of the main features of this disease and recent advances in research
      including pathophysiology, treatment, diagnosis and genetics as well as
      association with other disorders.

TI  - Acute effect of clonidine on left ventricular pressure-volume relation in
      hypertensive patients with diastolic heart dysfunction.
PG  - 635-42
AB  - We sought to assess the haemodynamic effects of clonidine on left ventricular
      (LV) pressure-volume relation in patients with diastolic heart dysfunction due to
      essential hypertension. Towards this end, simultaneous recordings of LV volume
      (acoustic quantification) and LV pressure (micromanometer) were obtained in 10
      such patients before and after drug administration and compared to baseline
      findings on 10 matched normal controls. The following measurements and
      calculations were obtained: maximal positive and negative first derivative of LV 
      pressure (peak +dP/dt and peak -dP/dt, respectively), LV minimal and
      end-diastolic pressure, peak systolic blood pressure, time constant of relaxation
      (TAU), LV stroke work and LV stiffness constant. The two invasive indexes, LV
      stiffness constant and TAU classified 10/10 patients as having abnormal LV
      diastolic function compared with 7/10 patients so classified by Doppler studies. 
      Central sympathetic suppression by a single oral dose of clonidine 0.125 mg in
      these patients resulted within 60 min in a decrease of heart rate and mean
      arterial pressure as well as a significant improvement of LV diastolic function
      indexes. Specifically, the LV stiffness constant (ml(-1)), in normal subjects was
      0.0028 vs 0.0152 (P < 0.001) in hypertensive subjects at baseline, vs 0.0053 in
      hypertensive after clonidine (P < 0.001 vs baseline). Likewise, the E/A ratio,
      was 1.08 in normal subjects vs 0.88 (P < 0.0001) in hypertensives at baseline, vs
      1.28 in hypertensives after clonidine (P < 0.0001 vs baseline). With clonidine
      the diastolic portion of the pressure-volume curve was displaced downward. In
      conclusion, clonidine can improve diastolic dysfunction without depressing
      systolic LV performance. The improvement may be attributable in part to
      withdrawal of direct sympathetic influence on the myocardium and in part to the
      indirect effect of systemic, pulmonary and coronary artery relaxation.

TI  - Selective posterior rhizotomy and intrathecal baclofen for the treatment of
      spasticity.
PG  - 57-65
AB  - Spasticity occurs in children and adults due to a wide range of conditions,
      including cerebral palsy, head and spinal cord trauma, cerebrovascular accidents 
      and multiple sclerosis. Multiple treatment options have been described, including
      medical and surgical treatments. Medical treatments include intramuscular
      botulinum A toxin, oral baclofen and supportive bracing. Surgical approaches
      include selective posterior rhizotomy, intrathecal baclofen and orthopedic
      procedures to address deformities. Many reports have been published on these
      different treatment options, but rarely has a comparison been made between them. 
      Therefore, this review is aimed at comparing selective posterior rhizotomy and
      intrathecal baclofen injection for spasticity due to cerebral palsy, especially
      in children.

TI  - Glatiramer acetate induces a Th2-biased response and crossreactivity with myelin 
      basic protein in patients with MS.
PG  - 209-19
AB  - Glatiromer acetate (GA) is an approved treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS). The
      proposed mechanism of action is the induction of GA-specific T cells
      characterized by protective anti-inflammatory Th2 response. We tested this
      hypothesis in 11 MS patients treated with GA from 1-19 months. Interferon-gamma
      and IL-5 (markers of Th1 and Th2 responses respectively) were assayed by ELISA in
      GA-specific T-cell lines (TCL) supernatants. Th1/Th2 bias was defined based on
      the ratio of IFN-gamma/IL-5 secretion. Fifty-eight pre-treatment and 75
      on-treatment GA-specific TCL were generated. On-treatment mean IL-5 levels in
      GA-TCL increased significantly, whereas those for IFN-gamma were markedly
      reduced. Consequently, the ratio of IFN-gamma IL-5 also shifted in favor of a Th2
      response. The percentage of GA-TCL classified as Th1 was decreased, whereas those
      classified as Th2 increased on-treatment as compared to pre-treatment. Some
      GA-specific TCL, (approximately 25%) generated during treatment secreted
      predominantly IL-5 in response to MBP and the immunodominant MBP peptide 83-99,
      indicating that these crossreactive antigens can act as partial agonists for
      GA-reactive TCL. These results strongly suggest that the mechanism of action of
      GA in MS involves the induction of crossreactive GA-specific T cells with a
      predominant Th2 cytokine profile.

TI  - Intrathecal baclofen for spastic hypertonia from stroke.
PG  - 2099-109
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We sought to determine whether continuous intrathecal
      delivery of baclofen can effectively decrease spastic hypertonia due to stroke.
      METHODS: Stroke patients with >6 months of intractable spasticity were screened
      via a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design of either
      intrathecal normal saline or 50 microgram baclofen. Those who dropped an average 
      of 2 points in either their affected lower extremity side Ashworth or Penn spasm 
      frequency scores were then offered computer-controlled pump implantation for
      continuous ITB and followed prospectively for up to 12 months. RESULTS: In 21
      stroke patients 6 hours after the active drug bolus, the average (+/-SD) lower
      extremity Ashworth score on the affected extremities decreased from 3.3+/-1.2 to 
      1.4+/-0.7 (P<0.0001), spasm score from 1.2+/-1.2 to 0.1+/-0.3 (P=0.0224), and
      reflex score from 2.1+/-1.2 to 0.1+/-0.5 (P<0.0001). The average upper extremity 
      Ashworth score on the affected extremities decreased from 2.8+/-1.1 to 1.8+/-0.8 
      (P<0.0001), spasm score from 0.7+/-1.0 to 0.2+/-0.4 (P=0.1544), and reflex score 
      from 2.1+/-0.9 to 1.2+/-0.9 (P=0.0004). All active drug scores were statistically
      different from placebo scores at 6 hours (P<0.05). With up to 12 months of
      continuous infusion of ITB in 17 implanted patients, the average lower extremity 
      Ashworth score on the affected extremities decreased from 3.7+/-1.0 to 1.8+/-1.1 
      (P<0.0001), the spasm score dropped from 1.2+/-1.3 to 0.6+/-1.0 (P=0.4282), and
      the reflex score decreased from 2.4+/-1.3 to 1.0+/-1.3 (P<0.0001). The average
      upper extremity Ashworth score in the affected extremities decreased from
      3.2+/-1.1 to 1.8+/-0.9 (P<0.0001), the spasm score dropped from 0.7+/-1.0 to
      0.3+/-0.8 (P=0.8685), and the reflex score decreased from 2.4+/-0.8 to 1.5+/-1.2 
      (P=0.3337). The average continuous ITB dose required to attain these effects was 
      268 microgram/d. CONCLUSIONS: Intrathecal infusion of baclofen is capable of
      maintaining a reduction in the spastic hypertonia resulting from stroke.

TI  - Neuroendocrine and immune aspects of fibromyalgia.
PG  - 521-31
AB  - Fibromyalgia is a form of non-articular rheumatism characterised by long term (>3
      months) and widespread musculoskeletal aching, stiffness and pressure
      hyperalgesia at characteristic soft tissue sites, called soft tissue tender
      points. The biophysiology of fibromyalgia, however, has remained elusive and the 
      treatment remains mainly empirical. This article reviews the
      neuroendocrine-immune pathophysiology of fibromyalgia. There is no major evidence
      that fibromyalgia is accompanied by activation of the inflammatory response
      system, by immune activation or by an inflammatory process. There is some
      evidence that fibromyalgia is accompanied by some signs of immunosuppression,
      suggesting that immunomodifying drugs could have potential in the treatment of
      fibromyalgia. Recent trials with cytokines, such as interferon-alpha, have been
      undertaken in patients with fibromyalgia. Immunotherapy with these agents,
      however, may induce symptoms reminiscent of fibromyalgia and depression in a
      considerable number of patients. Lowered serum activity of prolyl endopeptidase
      (PEP), a cytosolic endopeptidase that cleaves peptide bonds on the carboxyl side 
      of proline in proteins of relatively small molecular mass, may play a role in the
      biophysiology of fibromyalgia through diminished inactivation of algesic and
      depression-related peptides, e.g. substance P. Trials with PEP agonists could be 
      worthwhile in fibromyalgia. The muscle energy depletion hypothesis of
      fibromyalgia is supported by findings that this condition is accompanied by
      lowered plasma levels of branched chain amino acids (BCAAs), i.e. valine, leucine
      and isoleucine. Since there is evidence that BCAA supplementation decreases
      muscle catabolism and has ergogenic values, a supplemental trial with BCAAs in
      fibromyalgia appears to be justified.

TI  - Ketotifen in treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria.
PG  - 257-65
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The present in vivo study evaluates the potential use of ketotifen, a 
      tricyclic antihistaminic drug, in treatment of Sudanese patients with
      uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria (19-38 years). METHODS: Four groups
      of patients (each has 15) were randomly selected and treated by chloroquine
      (25mg/kg wt) in comparison with regimen combinations of ketotifen (0.13 mg/kg
      body wt) with chloroquine, ketotifen with Fansidar (33.3mg/kg body wt) and
      ketotifen with both chloroquine and Fansidar. RESULTS: Prior to treatment all
      patients had a parasite density that varied from 1 x 10(3)-3.46 x 10(4)/mL blood.
      On day 2, the highest level of parasitaemia was recorded in patients treated with
      chloroquine only. Other patients had a significantly lower parasitaemia (P<0.05) 
      with an average range of 111-243 parasites/300 leucocytes. On day 3 no parasites 
      were detected in groups treated by ketotifen and Fansidar or by ketotifen in
      combination with Fansidar and chloroquine. The mean time of parasite clearance
      was minimum (<32 h) amongst patients that had chloroquine administered with
      ketotifen alone or with both Fansidar and ketotifen. The cumulative percentage of
      cases with recrudescence was >39% in groups that had the chloroquine regimen
      alone or the combination of chloroquine with ketotifen. A single case of
      recrudescence was also diagnosed on day 28 in the group treated with ketotifen
      plus fansidar but no recrudescence occurred in the group treated with the
      combination of the three drugs. CONCLUSION: This study indicates the possible
      role of ketotifen in treatment for falciparum malaria particularly when
      administered in combination with chloroquine and fansidar.

TI  - Are there predictive factors for long-term outcome after withdrawal in
      drug-induced chronic daily headache?
PG  - 691-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate prognostic factors for long-term outcome of patients
      after inpatient withdrawal because of drug-induced chronic daily headache.
      PROCEDURES: Fifty-five patients (36 females) were re-examined by means of a
      standardized interview after inpatient withdrawal. The mean observation period
      was 9.28 +/- 2.85 years (mean +/- SD; median 8.58; range 5.00-13.50). RESULTS:
      Five years after withdrawal, one-third of the patients (34.6%) had an overall
      favourable outcome, one-third (32.7%) had no recurrent drug overuse and reported 
      a clear-cut improvement of headache, and one-third (32.7%) developed recurrent
      drug overuse. Most relapses occurred within 2 years, and a small percentage
      within 5 years. No predictors for long-term outcome after inpatient withdrawal
      were found. CONCLUSIONS: All patients with drug-induced chronic daily headache
      should be considered as good candidates for inpatient withdrawal, and no patient 
      should be excluded from that therapy.

TI  - Prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of glyceryl
      trinitrate in endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography-induced
      pancreatitis.
PG  - 1178-82
AB  - BACKGROUND: One possible aetiology of pancreatitis following endoscopic
      retrograde cholangio pancreatography (ERCP) is cannulation-induced spasm of the
      sphincter of Oddi and consequent pancreatic duct obstruction. Sublingual glyceryl
      trinitrate (GTN) has been shown to produce periampullary sphincter relaxation.
      The aim of this study was to determine whether prophylactic long-acting GTN could
      reduce the incidence of ERCP-induced pancreatitis. METHODS: In a randomized
      double-blind study, prophylactic treatment with GTN (2 mg given sublingually 5
      min before endoscopy) was compared with placebo in 186 patients who presented for
      elective ERCP. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of pancreatitis within 24 
      h, defined as a serum amylase concentration greater than 1000 units/ml in
      association with a visual analogue pain score of more than 5. RESULTS: The
      incidence of pancreatitis was lower in the GTN group compared with placebo (seven
      of 90 versus 17 of 96; P < 0.05). Mean serum amylase values were similar in the
      two groups. The protective effect of GTN appears to be highest in the diagnostic 
      ERCP group (one of 54 versus ten of 66; P = 0.012) and in the group in which
      cholangiography alone was performed (one of 54 versus eight of 57; P = 0.032).
      CONCLUSION: Prophylactic treatment with GTN reduces the incidence of pancreatitis
      following ERCP but does not seem to reduce the extent of hyperamylasaemia or the 
      severity of pancreatitis.

TI  - The estimated cost of managing focal spasticity: a physician practice patterns
      survey.
PG  - 57-68
AB  - The purpose of this study was to estimate the overall cost of managing focal
      spasticity after stroke (CVA) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) and the cost
      impact of individual treatments. Sixty physicians described management strategies
      over six treatment visits for four focal spasticity case studies (one upper and
      one lower extremity case for CVA and TBI). Mean and median per-case costs were
      determined across physicians; median per-case costs of physicians who did or did 
      not report use of specific treatments were compared. Mean per-case costs of
      managing spasticity are as follows: CVA upper, $5,131; CVA lower, $5,384; TBI
      upper, $14,615; and TBI lower, $13,966. Median per-case costs for strategies
      including botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) were less than those without BTX-A in
      CVA upper; median costs for strategies including oral baclofen were more than
      those without baclofen in CVA lower. Fewer total treatments were reported with
      BTX-A than without; more total treatments were reported with baclofen than
      without. No individual treatment had a significant impact on median treatment
      costs in TBI. Physician-reported spasticity management costs are substantial.
      Despite higher drug costs for BTX-A compared with oral therapies like baclofen,
      strategies for managing spasticity in CVA that include BTX-A may cost less than
      those without BTX-A.

TI  - Subfascial implantation of intrathecal baclofen pumps in children: technical
      note.
PG  - 753-6; discussion 756-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Indwelling intrathecal drug delivery systems are becoming increasingly
      important as a method of neuromodulation within the nervous system. In
      particular, intrathecal baclofen therapy has shown efficacy and safety in the
      management of spasticity and dystonia in children. The most common complications 
      leading to explantation of the pumps are skin breakdown and infection at the pump
      implantation site. The pediatric population poses particular challenges with
      regard to these complications because appropriate candidates for intrathecal
      baclofen therapy are often undernourished and thus have a dearth of soft tissue
      mass to cover a subcutaneously implanted baclofen pump. We report a technique of 
      subfascial implantation that provides greater soft tissue coverage of the pump,
      thereby reducing the potential for skin breakdown and improving the cosmetic
      appearance of the implantation site. METHODS: Eighteen consecutively treated
      children (average age, 8 yr, 7 mo) with spasticity and/or dystonia underwent
      subfascial implantation of a baclofen pump. These children's mean weight of 42.9 
      lb is less than the expected weight for a group of children in this age group,
      ranging from 4 years, 8 months, to 15 years, 7 months. In all patients, the pump 
      was inserted into a pocket surgically constructed between the rectus abdominus
      and the external oblique muscles and the respective anterior fascial layers.
      RESULTS: At an average follow-up of 13.7 months, no infection or skin breakdown
      had occurred at the pump surgical site in any of the 18 patients. CONCLUSION: At 
      this early follow-up, the subfascial implantation technique was associated with a
      reduced rate of local wound and pump infections and provided optimal cosmetic
      results as compared with that observed in retrospective cases.

TI  - Is multiple sclerosis caused by a silent infection with malarial parasites? A
      historico-epidemiological approach: part II.
PG  - 292-301
AB  - The comparison between the old map of malaria and the later distribution of
      multiple sclerosis (MS) first carried out in the USA (Part I) is continued in
      Europe. The Italian 'dilemma' (Kurtzke), meaning the disappearance of the
      north-south gradient in Italy by recent surveys, can be solved when considering
      the dependence of malaria transmission in relation to the altitude. Further, the 
      high prevalence of MS in earlier times in Mississippi, Louisiana and in the
      former province of Lucania in Italy can be explained by preceding epidemics of
      malaria. Brickner's therapeutic trial with quinine in cases of MS patients is
      reevaluated, and by this the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction is shown to exist in MS 
      too. The possible significance of the old and rather forgotten provocative
      methods for the diagnosis of latent malaria is discussed.

AB  - Peripheral polyneuropathy is the most frequent complication of diabetic mellitus.
      In spite of many clinical trials of different specific interventions for diabetic
      polyneuropathy, intensive glycemic control remains the only effective specific
      therapy currently available for this troublesome complication. This systematic
      overview reports the status of current clinical trials in diabetic polyneuropathy
      with an emphasis on those interventions directed towards specific
      pathophysiological derangements. A discussion of clinical trials of agents
      directed towards relieving painful symptoms of diabetic polyneuropathy concludes 
      this overview.

TI  - Intrathecal baclofen in tetraplegia of spinal origin: efficacy for upper
      extremity hypertonia.
PG  - 413-9
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of
      intrathecal baclofen (ITB) for upper extremity spastic hypertonia in tetraplegia 
      of spinal origin. SETTING: University of Alabama at Birmingham hospital. METHODS:
      The medical records of 14 individuals with tetraplegia of spinal origin who
      underwent intrathecal baclofen pump placement were reviewed. The effects of
      intrathecal baclofen on spasm frequency, deep tendon reflexes, and tone (Ashworth
      scale) were assessed for the upper and lower extremities for a 1-year follow-up
      period. RESULTS: There were statistically significant declines in upper extremity
      spasm scores (1.8 points, P=0.012), reflex scores (1.4 points, P<0.0001) and
      Ashworth scores (0.6 points, P<0.0001) for the 1-year follow-up period. For the
      lower extremities, all decreases were significant (P<0.0001). There was also a
      statistically significant (P<0.0001) increase in intrathecal baclofen dosage
      requirements during the 1-year follow-up period to maintain the reductions in
      spasm frequency, reflexes and tone. CONCLUSIONS: Intrathecal baclofen is a safe
      and effective intervention for treating upper extremity hypertonia of spinal
      origin. In addition, the level of intrathecal catheter placement is felt to be of
      importance.

TI  - A systematic review of vertigo in primary care.
PG  - 666-71
AB  - The symptom of vertigo is usually managed in primary care without further
      referral. This review examines the evidence on which general practitioners can
      base clinical diagnosis and management of this relatively common complaint.
      Research in this area has in the main been from secondary and tertiary centres
      and has been of variable quality. Indications are that the conditions that
      present in general practice are most likely to be benign positional vertigo,
      acute vestibular neuronitis, and Meniere's disease; however, vascular incidents
      and neurological causes, such as multiple sclerosis, must be kept in mind. An
      important practice point is that vestibular sedatives are not recommended on a
      prolonged basis for any type of vertigo. There is a need for basic
      epidemiological and clinical management research of vertigo in general practice.

TI  - Costs, quality of life and disease severity in multiple sclerosis: a
      cross-sectional study in Sweden.
PG  - 27-35
AB  - This study assessed the cost to society of multiple sclerosis (MS) in Sweden in
      1998. The cost-of-illness method, based on the human capital theory, was used as 
      the theoretical framework. The study used a cross-sectional approach, in which
      resource utilization data and quality-of-life data (utilities) were collected at 
      a single time point. The total cost of MS was estimated at 4868 MSEK, or 586
      MEUR, giving an annual cost of 442 500 SEK, or 53 250 EUR, per patient (1USD =
      9.73 SEK, 1 EUR = 8.31 SEK, as of 21 September 2000). Direct costs accounted for 
      about 67% of total cost, and they were dominated by the cost of personal
      assistants and drugs. Indirect costs (loss of production) accounted for about 33%
      of total costs. To these economic costs, intangible costs of 2702 MSEK (325 MEUR)
      should be added as well. Direct, indirect and informal care costs all rose
      significantly with increased disability and were higher during a relapse. Quality
      of life declined substantially with increased disability and was lower during a
      relapse. Multiple sclerosis was found to be associated with much higher costs to 
      society than has been ascertained by former studies. The study also revealed a
      strong correlation between severity of the disease and quality of life. These
      results are crucial for further studies on the cost-effectiveness of new
      treatments aimed at preventing relapses and reducing progression of the disease.

TI  - A pilot study of gabapentin as treatment for acquired nystagmus.
PG  - 107-13
AB  - The effects of the anticonvulsant gabapentin were measured on vision and eve
      movements in three patients with acquired pendular nystagmus. In two patients,
      the nystagmus was associated with multiple sclerosis and, in the other, it
      followed brainstem stroke. A single oral 600 mg dose of gabapentin produced
      improvement of vision due to changes in ocular oscillations in all three
      patients. The effect was sustained after five weeks of treatment in two patients 
      who elected to continue taking gabapentin 900-1500 mg/day. The results of this
      pilot study suggest that a controlled trial of gabapentin should be conducted to 
      evaluate its role in the treatment of acquired forms of nystagmus.

TI  - Report of three case studies with olanzapine for chronic pain.
PG  - 166-8
AB  - Olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic, has broad spectrum psychotropic effects,
      affecting dopamine receptors 1, 2, and 3, 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A,
      5-hydroxytryptamine 2C, muscarinic, alpha-adrenergic, alpha-adrenergic, and
      histamine H-sites. This unique pharmacologic property allows clinicians to use
      the agent as an adjunct for pain control, particularly when the intensity of the 
      pain is exacerbated by dysregulation of neurotransmitters. Three case studies are
      presented from a suburban family practice setting in which olanzapine has been
      successfully used to regulate pain perception in adults with chronic pain.

TI  - Coccygodynia: a proposal for an algorithm for treatment.
PG  - 257-66
AB  - Coccygodynia (coccydynia, coccygalgia) or coccygeal pain is a well-known but
      rarely studied painful syndrome affecting the coccyx region. Its etiology is not 
      well understood. Symptoms include development of pericoccygeal soft tissues,
      pelvic floor muscle spasms, referred pain from lumbar pathology, arachnoiditis of
      the lower sacral nerve roots, local post-traumatic lesions, and somatization. In 
      spite of advances in the treatment of other pain conditions, coccygodynia remains
      in a position for which therapeutic options are not clearly designed. On the
      basis of an anatomic review, proposed pathogenesis of coccygodynia, and the
      number of treatment approaches that have been proposed, we propose an algorithm
      for therapeutic decision making in the treatment of this syndrome.

TI  - Management of opioid side effects in cancer-related and chronic noncancer pain: a
      systematic review.
PG  - 231-56
AB  - Side effects can limit opioid dosage and reduce quality of life. The purpose of
      this systematic review was to assess the management of opioid side effects in the
      context of cancer pain management or, in the event that no evidence was available
      for cancer pain, for chronic noncancer pain. The side effects studied were
      constipation, pruritus, nausea and vomiting, myoclonus, sedation, respiratory
      depression, and delirium. Opioid rotation to manage side effects was also
      studied. For each side effect, we searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Controlled
      Trials Register and identified 657 possible titles for inclusion. Of these, 67
      studies met inclusion criteria for analysis. The lack of well-designed,
      randomized controlled trials and the heterogeneity of populations and study
      designs made the drawing of firm conclusions difficult and precluded performance 
      of meta-analysis. The type, strength, and consistency of evidence for available
      interventions to manage opioid side effects vary from strong (eg, on the use of
      naloxone to reverse respiratory depression or constipation) to weak (eg, changing
      from the oral to epidural route of morphine administration to manage sedation).
      Well-designed trials in the specified populations are required to furnish
      clinicians with secure evidence on managing opioid side effects successfully.

TI  - Straightforward consultation or complicated condition? General practitioners'
      perceptions of low back pain.
PG  - 3-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low back pain is a common condition in general practice and
      represents a significant part of a general practitioner's workload. However,
      despite guidelines, back pain still presents considerable challenges to
      clinicians. OBJECTIVE: To explore the perceptions and declared behaviour of UK
      general practitioners in relation to patients with low back pain. METHOD: A
      qualitative design was used, involving semi-structured interviews with 17 GPs in 
      the North of England. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using
      qualitative thematic analysis. RESULTS: Two major themes emerged from the data
      relating to approaches to and perceptions of low back pain. A dichotomy emerged, 
      where GPs describe their approach to what they know to be a straightforward
      consultation where most patients recover, and the frustration they experience
      when patients do not. Although GPs are using a simple bio-mechanistic approach to
      low back pain, they also operate a method of categorising patients, which
      involves identifying real and pseudo patients. When confronted with 'challenging'
      cases, that is those who do not recover, most GPs feel isolated and poorly
      prepared. CONCLUSION: GPs adopt a bio-mechanistic approach to LBP which appears
      to work well for the majority of patients, as the natural history of low back
      pain dictates that most patients will recover. However, this approach to low back
      pain fails at the margins and this is evident by the significant minority of
      persistent sufferers and the GP's reaction to them. Expanding patient-centredness
      to explore psychological and social dimensions in relation to low back pain
      presents an ongoing challenge in general practice.

TI  - Melatonin for treatment of REM sleep behavior disorder in neurologic disorders:
      results in 14 patients.
PG  - 281-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the treatment response with melatonin for rapid eye
      movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) associated with other neurologic
      disorders. BACKGROUND: Clonazepam has been considered the treatment of choice for
      RBD. However, an alternative treatment is desirable for those with RBD refractory
      to clonazepam, for those who experience intolerable side-effects with clonazepam,
      and for those in whom clonazepam precipitates or aggravates obstructive sleep
      apnea (OSA). To date, there is minimal published data and limited follow-up
      regarding the use of melatonin for patients with RBD associated with other
      neurologic syndromes and disorders. DESIGN/METHODS: The response to melatonin
      treatment for RBD was reviewed on consecutive patients the investigators treated 
      with this agent at Mayo Clinic Rochester from January 2000 to June 2001. The
      coexisting neurologic disorders, reasons for using melatonin, effective doses,
      side-effects, and duration of follow-up were also reviewed on all patients.
      RESULTS: Fourteen patients were commenced on melatonin over the specified time
      period (13 male, median RBD onset age 56 years, range 20-77 years). The
      coexisting neurologic findings/disorders were dementia with Lewy bodies (n=7),
      mild cognitive impairment with mild parkinsonism (n=2), multiple system atrophy
      (n=2), narcolepsy (n=2), and Parkinson's disease (n=1). The reasons for using
      melatonin in these cases were incomplete response of RBD to clonazepam in six
      patients, existing cognitive impairment in five, intolerable side-effects with
      clonazepam in two, and presence of severe obstructive sleep apnea and narcolepsy 
      in one. With seven patients continuing to use clonazepam at 0.5-1.0 mg/night, RBD
      was controlled in six patients, significantly improved in four, and initially
      improved but subsequently returned in two; no improvement occurred in one patient
      and increased RBD frequency/severity occurred in one patient. The effective
      melatonin doses were 3 mg in two cases, 6 mg in seven cases, 9 mg in one case,
      and 12 mg in two cases. Five patients reported side-effects, which included
      morning headaches (2), morning sleepiness (2), and delusions/hallucinations (1); 
      these symptoms resolved with decreased dosage. The mean duration of follow-up was
      14 months (range 9-25 months), with eight patients experiencing continued benefit
      with melatonin beyond 12 months of therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In this series,
      persistent benefit with melatonin beyond 1 year of therapy occurred in most but
      not all patients. Melatonin can be considered as a possible sole or add-on
      therapy in select patients with RBD. Prospective, long-term, controlled trials
      with melatonin are warranted in a larger number of patients with RBD associated
      with a variety of neurologic symptoms and disorders.

TI  - Mechanisms of action of intrathecal medications.
PG  - 353-64
AB  - Intrathecal delivery of medications for the management of chronic pain syndromes 
      reflects a modern targeted delivery system with the potential for even greater
      efficacy than is outlined in Tables 1 and 2. The twentieth century ushered in the
      development of parenteral approaches of medical therapy for chronic pain and
      other diseases that were superior to the traditional oral delivery methods known 
      in the preceding century. Targeted drug delivery represents a significant
      advancement in the treatment of patients with chronic pain and is likely be the
      method of choice for the twenty-first century. This method of delivery is best
      represented by current drug delivery systems, such as the intrathecal drug pump. 
      Traditional pharmacologic agents will still be used in the twenty-first century; 
      however, the development of novel compounds, transplanted tissues, and genetic
      engineering will likely usher in a new era of pain management, including their
      use as analgesics for intraspinal infusion.

      effects of MS on pregnancy, and vice versa. Reassurance can often be given
      regarding contraception, fertility, pregnancy management, pregnancy outcome, and 
      the risk of the child developing MS. Much more information is needed, however, on
      the effects and implications of MS therapies on pregnancy and breast-feeding.

TI  - Intrathecal baclofen therapy for stroke-related spasticity.
PG  - 36-46
AB  - Intrathecal baclofen (ITB) therapy is a widely recognized management technique
      for severe, disabling spasticity in individuals with cerebral palsy and spinal
      and brain injuries. Its utility in the stroke population has only been recognized
      recently. Unlike the aforementioned patient populations, many stroke survivors
      are ambulatory and are able to maintain a certain degree of functional
      independence through compensatory use of the uninvolved limbs. Clinicians often
      fail to recognize the potential enhancement in the function of these individuals 
      if they gain better control of their spastic limbs. Other spasticity treatments, 
      such as oral medications and neurolytic procedures, offer the advantage of being 
      nonsurgical; however, not every stroke patient will respond well to them. Some
      patients may not tolerate the systemic side effects of oral medications, such as 
      drowsiness and sedation. In patients with severe multilimb spasticity, phenol and
      even high doses of botulinum toxin may not adequately control spasticity. ITB
      therapy offers the advantage of effectively decreasing severe, diffuse spasticity
      without causing untoward effects on arousal and cognition. This article will
      review the efficacy of ITB therapy in treating spasticity and enhancing function 
      in stroke survivors.

TI  - Role of gabapentin in spinal muscular atrophy: results of a multicenter,
      randomized Italian study.
PG  - 537-41
AB  - Recent studies suggest that gabapentin has a neuroprotective effect in
      experimental models of motoneuron disease. We carried out a multicenter,
      randomized, controlled trial of gabapentin versus no treatment in 120 patients
      with type II or III spinal muscular atrophy for 12 months. We assessed maximum
      voluntary isometric contraction with a handheld myometer and calculated an arm
      megascore (summing elbow flexion, hand grip, and three-point pinch scores), and a
      leg megascore (summing knee flexion, knee extension, and foot extension scores). 
      Forced vital capacity and timed tasks were also evaluated. Arm megascore improved
      by at least 30% in 24.6% of treated and 16.9% of untreated patients (relative
      risk = 1.45; 95% confidence interval = 0.71-2.97). The leg megascore improved by 
      at least 30% in 37.7% of treated and 20.3% of untreated patients (relative risk =
      1.85; 95% confidence interval = 1.02-3.37). We conclude that gabapentin produced 
      a significant improvement in leg megascore at 6 months, which was more evident at
      12 months, with a trend for improvement in arm megascore at 12 months. The
      treatment had no effect on forced vital capacity or timed functional tests.

TI  - Medications in pregnancy and lactation.
PG  - 585-613
AB  - Lack of information and misinformation often lead to physicians advising mothers 
      to discontinue breastfeeding because of medication use. Also, many mothers do not
      adhere to their prescriptions or quit breastfeeding because of medication use.
      Although in both cases this cessation of breastfeeding is probably based on
      concern for the infant's safety, the physician may also be influenced by
      expediency and fear of litigation. The safest course for physicians who are
      treating nursing mothers is to consult reliable sources before advising
      discontinuation of breastfeeding. Overwhelming evidence has shown that
      breastfeeding is the most healthful form of nutrition for babies and should
      therefore be encouraged by physicians. Physicians should take the following
      approach to maximize safe maternal medication use for both the mother and the
      breastfed infant: 1. Determine if medication is necessary. 2. Choose the safest
      drug available, that is, one that; is safe when administered directly to infants,
      has a low milk:plasma ratio, has a short half-life, has a high molecular weight, 
      has high protein binding in maternal serum, is ionized in maternal plasma, is
      less lipophilic. 3. Consultation with the infant's pediatrician is encouraged. 4.
      Advise the mother to take the medication just after she has breastfed the infant 
      or just before the infant's longest sleep period. 5. If there is a possibility
      that a drug may risk the health of the infant, arrange for the monitoring of
      serum drug levels in the infant. Emergency physicians are often faced with the
      daunting task of treating a large variety of high-acuity patients, including
      patients who happen to be pregnant or nursing mothers. Priority, of course, needs
      to be given to life-saving treatment. When physicians are treating pregnant or
      breastfeeding patients, they need to use reliable resources to evaluate the risks
      and benefits of the medication for the mother and the infant. Most medications
      should have no effect on milk supply or on infant well-being. In most cases,
      treatment plans for patients should include encouragement from the emergency
      physician that he or she has researched the chosen medicine and that
      breastfeeding may safely continue.

      covered by the center of pressure over a one second period) and time to
      stabilization from center of pressure measures were calculated following
      perturbations. The intervention phase consisted of massed practice on the moving 
      platform (100 perturbations/day for 5 days). Analysis included hierarchical
      linear modeling and a repeated measures ANOVA. All children demonstrated a
      significant improvement in their ability to recover stability as demonstrated by 
      reduced center of pressure area and time to stabilization following training.
      These improvements were still present 30 days following completion of training.
      Results suggest that postural control mechanisms in school-age children (7 to 13 
      years) with CP are modifiable.

TI  - The treatment of trigeminal neuralgia in patients with multiple sclerosis using
      percutaneous radiofrequency rhizotomy.
PG  - 220-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) has a higher incidence among patients with 
      multiple sclerosis (MS) than in the general population. This cohort of MS
      patients with TN presents a series of management challenges including poor
      tolerance of antineuralgic medications and occasional bilateral presentation. We 
      analyzed our surgical series of MS patients presenting with TN who were treated
      with percutaneous radiofrequency rhizotomy to estimate the success, failure and
      recurrence rate of this procedure for those patients. METHODS: Surgical reports
      were retrospectively reviewed between the years 1996-2000. Patients with MS and
      TN who received a percutaneous rhizotomy during that time were included in the
      study and followed until the end of 2002. Data regarding age, sex, duration of MS
      and pain, response to medical treatment, pain distribution and surgical outcome
      were evaluated. RESULTS: There were thirteen patients with MS and medically
      refractory TN treated with percutaneous radiofrequency rhizotomy. The average age
      at diagnosis for MS was 41 with TN beginning an average of eight years later.
      Following rhizotomy, complete pain relief without the need for any medication was
      achieved in 81% of the patients. The addition of medications resulted in pain
      control in the remaining patients. During a mean follow-up period of 52 months,
      there was a 50% recurrence rate. There were no complications related to the
      procedure and the associated facial numbness was well-tolerated. CONCLUSIONS:
      Percutaneous radiofrequency rhizotomy is a safe and effective method for the
      treatment of TN in patients with MS. The unique susceptibility of this cohort to 
      the side effects of antineuralgic medications may require early consideration of 
      rhizotomy.

TI  - Spasticity in a child with myelomeningocele treated with continuous intrathecal
      baclofen.
PG  - 218-21
AB  - Patients with myelomeningocele may often suffer from severe spasticity. Surgical 
      treatment of the underlying pathology such as hydromyelia and tethered cord may
      be successful, but failures are not uncommon. Those cases may offer a surgical
      challenge since further therapeutic options are limited. We present the case of a
      7-year-old boy with myelomeningocele and related conditions suffering from severe
      spasticity and pain in his lower limbs. Surgical efforts with untethering and
      posterior fossa decompression failed to improve the symptoms. A test with 25
      microg intrathecally delivered baclofen showed a total relief of spasticity and
      pain so that a pump for continuous baclofen delivery was implanted. During 32
      months of follow-up, his spasticity has been under excellent control on 55-157
      microg baclofen per day. Continuous delivery of intrathecal baclofen may be a
      surgical option to consider in patients with myelomeningocele and severe
      spasticity.

TI  - Basilar artery occlusion in children: misleading presentations, "locked-in"
      state, and diagnostic importance of accompanying vertebral artery occlusion.
PG  - 450-62
AB  - Basilar artery occlusion in children is rare. The clinical diagnosis of basilar
      artery occlusion is often difficult because the initial neurologic findings, most
      frequently hemiparesis, involuntary movements, or headache, are often transient
      and can suggest complicated migraine, seizures, or both. We have reviewed 37
      previously reported pediatric cases of basilar artery occlusion and present 3
      additional ones. In the 40 cases, basilar artery occlusion alone occurred in 22; 
      in the other 18, there was accompanying vertebral artery occlusion. In the cases 
      of pure basilar artery occlusion, the most common causes were trauma and
      arteritis, but in most such cases, the etiology could not be determined. The
      cause was found much more often in cases of basilar artery occlusion with
      accompanying vertebral artery occlusion, with trauma being the most frequent
      etiology, especially in boys between 6 and 14 years. Of the 37 previously
      reported pediatric cases of basilar artery occlusion, 7 were "locked in" early in
      the course (mute, quadriparetic, aware, and communicative with eye movements), as
      were our 3 cases. In most cases of basilar artery occlusion that are locked in,
      the basilar artery occlusion involves its midportion, sparing the anterior
      inferior cerebellar and superior cerebellar arteries.

TI  - Clinical review: Severe malaria.
PG  - 315-23
AB  - Malaria represents a medical emergency because it may rapidly progress to
      complications and death without prompt and appropriate treatment. Severe malaria 
      is almost exclusively caused by Plasmodium falciparum. The incidence of imported 
      malaria is increasing and the case fatality rate remains high despite progress in
      intensive care and antimalarial treatment. Clinical deterioration usually appears
      3-7 days after onset of fever. Complications involve the nervous, respiratory,
      renal, and/or hematopoietic systems. Metabolic acidosis and hypoglycemia are
      common systemic complications. Intravenous quinine and quinidine are the most
      widely used drugs in the initial treatment of severe falciparum malaria, whereas 
      artemisinin derivatives are currently recommended for quinine-resistant cases. As
      soon as the patient is clinically stable and able to swallow, oral treatment
      should be given. The intravascular volume should be maintained at the lowest
      level sufficient for adequate systemic perfusion to prevent development of acute 
      respiratory distress syndrome. Renal replacement therapy should be initiated
      early. Exchange blood transfusion has been suggested for the treatment of
      patients with severe malaria and high parasitemia. For early diagnosis, it is
      paramount to consider malaria in every febrile patient with a history of travel
      in an area endemic for malaria.

TI  - A case of unilateral neglect in Huntington's disease.
PG  - 261-73
AB  - Unilateral neglect, an attentional deficit in detecting and acting on information
      coming from one side of space, is a relatively common consequence of right
      hemisphere stroke. Although neglect has been observed following damage to a
      variety of brain structures, to date no reports exist of neglect phenomena
      arising from Huntington's Disease (HD). However, reports in the animal and human 
      literature suggest that neglect is possible following damage to a primary site
      for Huntington's pathology, the basal ganglia. Here we present a patient (BG)
      with genetically proven HD who, in the context of the mild intellectual,
      executive and attentional impairments associated with the disorder, showed a
      remarkably severe and stable neglect for left space. MRI and electrophysiological
      results make it unlikely that the spatial bias could be accounted for by basic
      sensory loss. In addition, behavioural investigation indicated that, although
      BG's neglect operated in a very striking manner along body-centred co-ordinates
      (missing almost all information presented to her left), more general limitations 
      in visual attention were apparent to the left-side of information presented
      entirely to the right of the body midline. Further evidence is presented showing 
      that the neglect was manifest on tactile and auditory tasks as well as those
      presented in the visual domain. The presence of neglect in HD in this case is
      novel and somewhat puzzling, particularly as flourodeoyglucose positron emission 
      tomography revealed bilateral caudate hypoperfusion. Reducing the statistical
      threshold on this analysis revealed a potential frontal hypometabolism that was
      more marked in the right than left hemisphere. However, as this was only apparent
      at a threshold below that normally considered acceptable (due to the resulting
      number of false positives), this possible account of the neglect must be viewed
      very cautiously.

TI  - Off-label applications for SSRIs.
PG  - 498-504
AB  - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used because of their 
      safety, tolerability, and demonstrated efficacy across a broad range of clinical 
      conditions. Medical literature supports the use of SSRIs for the treatment of
      many conditions outside of the indications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration. SSRIs offer a reasonable alternative to traditional therapy for
      generalized anxiety disorder. A side effect of SSRIs coincidentally provides
      therapy for premature ejaculation. SSRIs may reduce the frequency and severity of
      migraine headaches and are possibly effective in reducing the pain of diabetic
      neuropathy. When taken in combination with tricyclic antidepressants, SSRis offer
      more potent therapy for fibromyalgia than either agent alone. SSRIs appear to be 
      effective in some patients with neurocardiogenic syncope that is refractory to
      standard therapies. Clinical experience supported by ongoing research continues
      to expand on the broad array of therapeutic applications for this class of
      medication.

TI  - Atovaquone-proguanil for prophylaxis and treatment of malaria.
PG  - 1266-75
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the currently available information on atovaquone-proguanil 
      for treatment and prophylaxis of malaria. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search was
      conducted from 1966 to February 2003 using key phrases Malarone, atovaquone,
      proguanil, and malaria. Further articles were identified from a manual search of 
      the references of identified articles. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION:
      English-language studies with animal and human data evaluating preclinical
      pharmacology, human studies on pharmacokinetics, and clinical trials were
      evaluated. Relevant data were extracted from identified articles. DATA SYNTHESIS:
      Atovaquone-proguanil has been evaluated for treatment of acute, uncomplicated
      malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum in 8 clinical trials. In these studies,
      treatment with atovaquone-proguanil led to a higher (87-100% vs. 72-88%) or
      equally effective (94-100% vs. 90-100%) cure rate than the comparator
      antimalarial agents. Atovaquone-proguanil has been evaluated for prophylaxis of
      malaria in 6 clinical trials. In the 4 placebo-controlled trials for semi-immune 
      residents or nonimmune migrants, the prophylaxis success rates in the
      atovaquone-proguanil and placebo arms ranged from 98% to 100% and 48% to 82%,
      respectively. The prophylaxis with success rates were similar among the 2 arms
      when atovaquone-proguanil was compared with other antimalarial regimens in
      nonimmune travelers. Atovaquone-proguanil was well tolerated in these clinical
      trials. CONCLUSIONS: Atovaquone-proguanil is a safe and effective alternative to 
      current recommended regimens for prophylaxis and treatment of malaria.

TI  - Baclofen treatment for chronic posttraumatic stress disorder.
PG  - 1177-81
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have shown the efficacy of gamma-aminobutyric acid B 
      (GABA(B)) receptor agonists in treating anxiety in patients with panic disorder
      and in treating depression and anxiety in alcoholic patients. We hypothesized
      that baclofen, a GABA(B) agonist, would be an effective treatment in the
      symptomatic management of veterans with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD). METHODS: Fourteen male veterans with chronic, combat-related PTSD were
      enrolled in an open-label, 8-week, monotherapy trial of baclofen titrated to a
      maximum of 80 mg/d in 3 divided doses. The primary outcome measure was the
      Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), and secondary outcome measures included
      the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, 
      the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale, and the Clinical Global Impressions. 
      RESULTS: In the 11 patients who completed the 8-week trial, the mean total CAPS
      score decreased significantly from baseline (from 82.9 +/- 16.1 to 63.5 +/-
      21.2). The avoidance and hyperarousal subscales showed significant decreases
      (from 36.2 +/- 6.2 to 26.5 +/- 9.6 and from 31.9 +/- 6.5 to 22.1 +/- 7.1,
      respectively), whereas the re-experiencing subscale remained unchanged.
      Significant improvements were also noted on all secondary outcome measures.
      Treatment response was noted within the first 4 weeks of treatment and was
      maintained throughout the trial. Baclofen therapy was well tolerated, as only 1
      patient dropped out due to adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: Baclofen therapy was
      effective in treating both the PTSD symptoms and accompanying depression and
      anxiety in patients with chronic PTSD due to combat. Larger, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled studies are needed to confirm the efficacy of baclofen in the 
      treatment of PTSD.

TI  - Double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the efficacy of trazodone in alcohol
      post-withdrawal syndrome: polysomnographic and clinical evaluations.
PG  - 377-83
AB  - Alcohol detoxification is accompanied by sustained difficulties in sleep
      initiation and maintenance. These difficulties are thought to be an important
      cause of relapse to alcohol use. However, the treatment of sleep problems with
      hypnotic drug is made difficult by cross-tolerance between benzodiazepines and
      alcohol. In this report, we evaluated the capacity of trazodone (TRZ), a
      second-generation antidepressant with anxiolytic and sedative properties, to
      increase the sleep efficiency in alcohol-dependent patients after detoxification.
      Sixteen patients completed the TRZ (n = 8) or the placebo (PL; n = 8) treatment
      arms. Polysomnographies were performed at baseline, after the 1st drug dose, and 
      after 4 weeks of treatment. The main outcome was sleep efficiency. Secondary
      outcomes included changes in other sleep parameters, Hamilton Depression Rating
      and Clinical Global Impression scales. Sleep efficiency was increased in the TRZ 
      group when it was computed after sleep onset, both immediately after 1st
      administration of the drug and after 4 weeks of treatment. No benefit was
      observed in the PL group. Sleep improvement under TRZ also included the number of
      awakenings, intermittent wake sleep time, and non-rapid eye movement sleep.
      Hamilton and Clinical Global scales were better for the TRZ group. TRZ is thus a 
      potential option in the treatment of alcohol post-withdrawal insomnia.

TI  - Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura after cephalosporin administration: a
      possible relationship.
PG  - 1317-21
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is an autoimmune
      disorder. The pathogenesis is believed to be mediated by an autoantibody directed
      against the metalloproteinase responsible for the degradation of the
      very-high-molecular-weight multimers of the vWF. The syndrome can be precipitated
      by a variety of conditions, and certain medications also have been implicated.
      CASE REPORTS: The cases of two patients who took a cephalosporin antibiotic,
      cephalexin (Keflex, Eli Lilly), and then developed TTP are reported. One patient 
      subsequently received a third-generation cephalosporin, ceftriaxone (Rocephin,
      Roche), without adverse reaction. Of interest, one patient had taken cefaclor
      (Ceclor, Eli Lilly) 8 years before and had also developed TTP at that time. The
      other patient also took cefaclor for approximately 3 weeks before taking
      cephalexin. In addition, she had had a dose of clarithromycin (Biaxin, Abbott
      Laboratories) the day before the onset of the TTP symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: To our
      knowledge, TTP has not been reported previously after administration of
      cephalosporin antibiotics. Attention is called to the possibility that this
      syndrome may occur after exposure to some of these drugs, although the incidence 
      is very rare or, alternatively, underdiagnosed.

TI  - Establishing principles for migraine management in primary care.
PG  - 493-507
AB  - Published guidelines for the management of migraine in primary care were
      evaluated by an international advisory board of headache specialists, to
      establish evidence-based principles of migraine management that could be
      recommended for international use. Twelve principles of migraine management were 
      identified, covering screening, diagnosis, management and treatments: Almost all 
      headaches are benign/primary and can be managed by all practising clinicians. Use
      questions/a questionnaire to assess the impact on daily living and everyday
      activities, for diagnostic screening and to aid management decisions. Share
      migraine management between the clinician and the patient. Provide individualised
      care for migraine and encourage patients to manage their migraine. Follow up
      patients, preferably with migraine calendars or diaries. Regularly re-evaluate
      the success of therapy using specific outcome measures and monitor the use of
      acute and prophylactic medications regularly. Adapt migraine management to
      changes that occur in the illness and its presentation over the years. Provide
      acute medication to all migraine patients and recommend it is taken at the
      appropriate time, during the attack. Provide rescue medication/symptomatic
      treatment for when the initial therapy fails. Offer to prescribe prophylactic
      medications, as well as lifestyle changes, to patients who have four or more
      migraine attacks per month or who are resistant to acute medications. Consider
      concurrent co-morbidities in the choice of appropriate prophylactic medication.
      Work with the patient to achieve comfort with mutually agreed upon treatment and 
      ensure that it is practical for their lifestyle and headache presentation. Using 
      these principles, practising clinicians can screen and diagnose their headache
      patients effectively and manage their migraine patients over the long-term
      natural history of the migraine process. In this way, the majority of migraine
      patients can be well treated in primary care, ensuring a structured and
      individualised approach to headache management, and conserving valuable
      healthcare resources.

TI  - Photosensitive erythema multiforme and erythema multiforme-like polymorphous
      light eruption.
PG  - 157-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Photosensitive erythema multiforme (EM) is a rare disorder. It
      usually occurs only if a herpes virus infection or ingestion of drugs precedes
      exposure to sunlight in selected patients. METHODS: We report a 37-year-old man
      who had recurrent EM eruptions following sun exposures over a period of 20 years.
      Lesions were prevalently located on exposed skin, but unexposed skin and mucosa
      of the oropharynx were also affected. The patient had poor tolerance to sunlight 
      and denied having herpes simplex infection or using drugs. RESULTS: Provocative
      phototest induced clinically and histologically similar lesions at low dose
      thresholds of UVA (10 J/cm2) and UVB (100 mJ/cm2). CONCLUSION: On the basis of
      clinical and histological findings and results of phototesting, a diagnosis of
      photosensitive EM was made. The EM-like variant of polymorphous light eruption is
      discussed in the differential diagnosis.

TI  - Pain and MS.
PG  - 14-9
AB  - Pain is frequently evident in the course of multiple sclerosis (MS) and is
      estimated to occur in approximately 50% of patients. The incidence of pain has no
      apparent correlation to disease severity. Moreover, a comprehensive definition of
      pain has not been established, thus making the evaluation of this chronic,
      evolving symptom difficult. On the basis of its pathophysiology, pain can occur
      as a consequence of neurological impairment and disability, somatic pain or
      because of neurological damage. Although there are few randomized trials for pain
      in MS, new therapeutic strategies are now available and interest in the
      symptomatic treatment of MS is growing.

TI  - Rational design of peptide vaccines for autoimmune disease: harnessing molecular 
      recognition to fix a broken network.
PG  - 61-73
AB  - Autoreactive T-cells and antibodies are found at low levels in normal individuals
      and are thought to be kept at bay by regulatory T-cells and a network of
      idiotypic and anti-idiotype-bearing antigen receptors on lymphocytes as well as
      idiotypic anti-idiotypic antibodies. Disruption of this network by genetic,
      environmental and unknown factors is thought to result in autoimmune diseases. An
      obvious, ideal and specific therapy for such disorders would be to harness this
      regulatory network to re-establish immunologic homeostasis. In practice, however,
      this is not an easy task as most autoimmune diseases involve polyclonal responses
      to self antigen. Thus, we are faced with the conundrum of not knowing which
      autoreactive idiotype-bearing antibody or antigen receptor(s) to target in order 
      to restore or induce network regulatory function. The thesis of this review is
      that understanding a fundamental property governing peptide/protein shape can be 
      used in part to circumvent the problems of self reactivity and polyclonality in
      autoimmune disorders. More specifically, an algorithm has been developed to
      design peptide vaccines with shapes that are thought to be complementary in
      contour to self epitopes which seem to be the focus of autoimmunity. In theory,
      such complementary shapes should be engendered in certain autoreactive antigen
      receptors--these complementary constructs consequently represent receptor
      mimetics. By targeting an immune response against such mimetics, one generates a 
      polyclonal anti-idiotype response that matches the complexity of the autoimmune
      response itself. This article will describe the algorithm for vaccine design,
      summarize the in vitro and in vivo evidence for its efficacy and discuss possible
      therapeutic utility in human autoimmune diseases.

TI  - Clinical evaluation of amitriptyline for the control of chronic pain caused by
      temporomandibular joint disorders.
PG  - 221-5
AB  - Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) is characterized by a combination of symptoms
      affecting the temporomandibular joint and/or chewing muscles. The two most common
      clinical TMD symptoms are pain and dysfunction. Pain is usually caused by
      dysfunction, and emergency therapy has focused on controlling it. Recent
      investigations into TMD have led to the recommendation of antidepressants as a
      supporting treatment against constant neuralgic pain. The aim of this
      double-blind study was to verify the efficiency of antidepressants
      (amitriptyline) as a support in the treatment of chronic TMD pain. Twelve female 
      volunteers presenting chronic TMD pain were divided into two groups and treated
      for 14 days: Group 1 with 25 mg/day of amitriptyline and Group 2 with a placebo. 
      The intensity of pain and discomfort was evaluated daily, using a visual analog
      scale (VAS), over a period of seven days preceding the treatment (baseline),
      during the 14-day treatment, and for seven days after the treatment. The results 
      revealed a significant reduction of pain and discomfort in Group 1 (75%) compared
      to Group 2 (28%) during the three weeks beginning at baseline (p < 0.01).
      Amitriptyline proved to be an efficient alternative treatment for chronic pain in

TI  - Unusual early-onset Huntingtons disease.
PG  - 429-32
AB  - Huntington's disease is an autosomal dominant progressive neurodegenerative
      disorder characterized by involuntary movements, cognitive decline, and
      behavioral disorders leading to functional disability. In contrast to patients
      with adult onset, in which chorea is the major motor abnormality, children often 
      present with spasticity, rigidity, and significant intellectual decline
      associated with a more rapidly progressive course. An unusual early-onset
      Huntington's disease case of an 11-year-old boy with severe hypokinetic/rigid
      syndrome appearing at the age of 2.5 years is presented. Clinical diagnosis was
      confirmed by polymerase chain reaction study of the expanded IT-15 allele with a 
      compatible size of 102 cytosine-adenosine-guanosine repeats L-Dopa mildly
      ameliorated rigidity, bradykinesia, and dystonia. We conclude that Huntington's
      disease should be included in the differential diagnoses of regressive syndromes 
      of early childhood.

TI  - Hepatotoxicity of hypolipidemic drugs.
PG  - 415-33
AB  - Dyslipidemic conditions and their cardiovascular related complications are
      common. Effective primary and secondary prevention strategies include therapies
      to lower LDL and total cholesterol and to increase HDL. Further, it seems that
      there is a need for therapeutic reduction in triglycerides as it emerges as an
      independent risk factor for CVD. Many clinical trials have been designed to
      evaluate pharmacologic compounds in the treatment of the dyslipidemias and they
      seem to have shown a safe profile, both in the experiment phases and in
      post-marketing observation studies. Nevertheless, sporadic reports of
      hepatotoxicity with statins and niacin still arise (Table 2). Although routine
      hepatic biochemical test monitoring is recommended, the cost-effectiveness is
      questionable because often these reactions are idiosyncratic and may not be
      identified by this routine screening. The risk/benefit ratio is in favor of using
      these medications in individuals at risk. There is no evidence to suggest
      intrinsic hepatotoxic activity as such. Drugs that lower triglycerides such as
      fibrates, have been observed to improve hepatic biochemical tests, although in
      small series. This leads to speculation whether treatment with fibrates would be 
      beneficial for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a condition that is
      emerging as one of enormous magnitude.

AB  - An 8-year-old boy with an implanted intrathecal baclofen pump presented with
      intermittent signs of baclofen under- and overdose. Pump interrogation, pump
      volumes, plain X-rays, catheter contrast fluoroscopy and CT of the intrathecal
      catheter tip were unremarkable. A microfracture of the extradural catheter was
      only seen at a magnification of x20 and confirmed by scanning electron
      microscopy. Symptoms resolved following replacement. Microfracture of the
      intrathecal catheter of baclofen pump systems may present puzzling symptomatology
      and be difficult to diagnose by conventional means.

TI  - Epileptic spasms in clusters without hypsarrhythmia in infancy.
PG  - 109-13
AB  - Spasms are defined as epileptic seizures characterized by brief axial
      contraction, in flexion, extension or mixed, symmetric or asymmetric, lasting
      from a fraction of a second to 1-2s, and are associated with a slow-wave
      transient or sharp and slow-wave complex, followed or not by voltage attenuation.
      Epileptic spasms usually appear in clusters and are age-dependent. This type of
      epileptic spasms associated with the particular EEG pattern, hypsar rhythmia,
      constitutes the basis for the diagnosis of West syndrome. The question is, how to
      nosologically define those patients who clearly present epileptic spasms in
      clusters without modified or typical hypsarrhythmia and with or without focal
      paroxysmal discharges on the interictal EEG. In the present series, the four
      patients show that epileptic spasms in clusters may occur in infancy, without
      hypsarrhythmia. They all presented the following features: normal
      neuropsychological development before onset of epileptic spasms, clusters of
      epileptic spasms, focal clinical and/or EEG abnormalities, normal
      neuroradiological imaging, neurometabolic investigations and karyotypes. In three
      of the patients, seizures were refractory to AEDs. Epileptic spasms in clusters
      without hypsarrhythmia that start in the first year of life represent a subtype
      of infantile spasms that generally are refractory to AEDs. It is not yet clear
      whether it should be considered as a variant of West syndrome or not [Published
      with Video sequence].

TI  - The safety of pharmaceutical excipients.
PG  - 541-50
AB  - The most important part of a medicine as far as its weight is concerned, is
      constituted by its excipients, which have the important functions of guaranteeing
      the dosage, stability and bioavailability of the active principle. The components
      employed as excipients must present the characteristics required by their
      technological function but, as with any substance administered to man, they must 
      also correspond to suitable safety requirements. In fact, in the past the
      importance of evaluating the possible adverse effects of excipients was
      underestimated, because their inertia and innocuity were taken for granted. The
      safety profile of these substances is more deeply researched as regards the
      toxicological aspect only if they are also employed in the food industry
      (anti-oxidants, sweeteners, colouring agents, etc.). Indeed, in this case, the
      International Toxicological Committees (among which the Joint Expert Committee on
      Food Additives, a mixed committee of the WHO/FAO) demand thorough studies in
      laboratory animals, with the intent of protecting the consumer's safety. Tackling
      the question of the toxicity of excipients thoroughly is not a simple matter for 
      several reasons: the large number of substances on the market and the diversity
      of their chemical profiles, their sources, their technological functions, and the
      presence of secondary products and/or contaminants that may be the true causes of
      adverse effects. In this article we shall review the principal classes of
      excipients and their respective side effects. Then we shall proceed to their
      toxicological evaluation, giving examples of: (a) intrinsic toxicity, or adverse 
      effects that may be encountered in the whole population; and (b) specific
      toxicity, which manifests only in people who are carriers of a transmissible
      disease or who are genetically predisposed, such as people with allergies and
      intolerances.

TI  - Eosinophilic exudative pleural effusion after initiation of tizanidine treatment:
      a case report.
PG  - 85-90
AB  - In this case report, we present a 42-year-old man with history of chronic low
      back pain after a work-related injury. The patient failed multiple therapeutic
      modalities both conservative and interventional, including numerous spinal
      injections and placement of a spinal cord stimulator. Finally, an intrathecal
      morphine pump was placed to control his pain in addition to oral pain
      medications. The course of the treatment included adding a muscle relaxant,
      tizanidine (Zanaflex), to control spasms in the lower extremities. Six weeks
      after starting tizanidine, a large pleural effusion was noted incidentally on a
      computerized tomography scan of the thoracic and lumbar spine. The patient
      underwent work-up for the pleural effusion; all tests came back negative.
      Finally, a drug reaction to tizanidine was suspected. The drug was discontinued, 
      and 4 weeks later the pleural effusion resolved.

      disorders.
PG  - 1951-5
AB  - Several lines of evidence support a mutual relationship between the nervous
      system and the immune system. Therefore, it is not surprising that some
      neuropsychiatric disorders are also characterized by immune abnormalities. In
      patients with phobic disorders and in patients with migraine without aura some
      common immune abnormalities have been detected and, in particular, natural
      immunity deficits, exaggerated release of proinflammatory cytokines and
      circulating bacterial endotoxins have been found. In other neurological disease, 
      some etiologic factors have been detected as in the case of Guillain-Barre
      syndrome in which molecular mimicry between Campylobacter jejuni endotoxin and
      GM1 ganglioside may cause an acute inflammatory polyneuropathy. On the other
      hand, attempts to identify an antigen have been made in patients with Alzheimer's
      disease and schizophrenia. Finally, the chronic fatigue syndrome, an old illness 
      in search for an antigen, risk factors and precipitating agents have been
      described but evidence for a specific antigen is still lacking.

TI  - Pediatric movement disorders.
PG  - 529-35
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Pediatric movement disorders are a heterogeneous group of
      symptoms that occur in the context of a large number of different neurological
      diseases. Accurate diagnosis and quantification of these disorders is essential
      for determining outcome, appropriate treatment, and criteria for inclusion in
      research trials. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent advances in
      diagnosis and treatment for childhood movement disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: The
      ultimate goal is to discover new treatments that can lead to measurable
      improvement in functional outcome for affected children. In order to accomplish
      this goal, we must have consistent definitions and accurate measurements to
      determine the diagnosis and severity for each child in a clinic or research
      trial. Recent progress in defining childhood movement disorders has led to
      consensus definitions of different types of hypertonia. There has also been
      progress in the development of outcome measures that relate to meaningful
      functional performance in a variety of skill areas. Most exciting is the prospect
      of new treatments, and we survey the current non-medical, medical, and surgical
      therapies for childhood motor disorders. SUMMARY: Although pediatric movement
      disorders are a complex and often poorly understood group of symptoms, recent
      work has shown that there is a possibility of defining, measuring, and ultimately
      treating these debilitating diseases.

TI  - Gabapentin dosing in the treatment of epilepsy.
PG  - 1382-406
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gabapentin is considered a safe and well-tolerated antipileptic drug 
      (AED) with a favorable pharmacokinetic profile and a broad therapeutic index.
      However, recent studies have used higher doses and faster titration schedules
      than those used in the pivotal trials that established the efficacy of gabapentin
      in the treatment of partial seizures. OBJECTIVE: The purposes of this review were
      to assess the gabapentin titration and dosing regimens that have been published
      in peer-reviewed journals, to develop dosing recommendations to maximize
      antiseizure efficacy without compromising tolerability, and to formulate
      guidelines for an adequate therapeutic assessment of gabapentin dosage efficacy. 
      METHODS: In the absence of sufficient placebo-controlled, double-blind studies, a
      formal evidence-based assessment could not be performed. However, a MEDLINE
      search using the search terms gabapentin and epilepsy, spanning back to the year 
      1986, produced numerous published reports from randomized, placebo-controlled and
      open-label trials, as well as case reports. These were reviewed to assess the
      range of dosing and titration schedules reported. Reports that employed
      gabapentin doses and titration schedules were selected for review. RESULTS: Our
      review of this literature suggests improved seizure control at higher gabapentin 
      maintenance dosages (< or =3600 mg/d) than are used today in clinical practice
      (1800 mg/d) without an increase in the incidence of adverse reactions. Most of
      the patients who received high dosages (eg, 3600 mg/d) or experienced fast
      titration rates tolerated gabapentin well. Side effects occurred around the onset
      of dosing and were reported in some studies to be transient. CONCLUSIONS: Based
      in the literature here, in most adult patients, gabapentin may be initiated at a 
      dosage of 900 mg/d and titrated to maintenance dosages > or = 3600 mg/d. Children
      may be treated with gabapentin 23 to 78 mg/kg per day. Based on controlled and
      open trials, the majority of patients will tolerate gabapentin well enough for an
      adequate therapeutic assessment. Titration to effect can be accomplished rapidly,
      if necessary; however, as with other AEDs, optimal seizure control may take
      months to achieve.

TI  - Analysis of the patients attending a specialist UK headache clinic over a 3-year 
      period.
PG  - 14-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study analyzed the profile of patients who attended a specialist 
      UK headache clinic over a 3-year period. METHODS: An audit was conducted of the
      clinical records of patients attending the specialist headache clinic at King's
      College, London, between January 1997 and January 2000. Data were collected for
      diagnoses given, current medications taken, medications prescribed and
      recommended, and investigations conducted. Results were calculated as numbers and
      proportions of patients for the 3-year period and for the 3 separate 12-month
      periods. RESULTS: A total of 458 patients were included in the audit. Most
      patients were diagnosed as having chronic daily headache (CDH, 60%) or migraine
      (33%). Prior to the clinic visit, most patients with CDH and migraine treated
      their headaches with analgesics, and there was little use of prophylactic
      medication. In the clinic, 74% of patients with CDH and 85% of migraineurs were
      prescribed prophylactic medication, and 81% of migraineurs were given triptans
      for acute treatment. Diagnostic testing was performed in 12% of the patients, and
      all results were normal or negative. CONCLUSIONS: CDH and migraine were the most 
      common headache types encountered in this UK secondary-care clinic. Review of
      treatment patterns used prior to the initial clinic evaluation suggests that
      management of CDH and migraine in UK primary care is suboptimal, and educational 
      initiatives are needed to improve headache management.

TI  - Fibromyalgia syndrome: an overview of potential drug targets.
PG  - 668-73
AB  - Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a chronic disease of widespread and debilitating
      pain. The cause of FMS is unknown and its risk factors are poorly understood. It 
      occurs frequently in the general population where it is often co-morbid with
      other rheumatoid and pain disorders, and psychiatric disorders such as anxiety
      and depression, making diagnosis particularly difficult. Several types of drugs
      are used to treat FMS, but none are specifically approved for this indication.
      FMS appears to be strongly associated with depression or at least with some
      symptoms of depression, and antidepressants appear to be effective in the
      treatment of this disorder. The advent of new classes of antidepressants with
      fewer side effects than older drugs has suggested new avenues of therapy for
      patients diagnosed with FMS.

TI  - Restless legs syndrome and drug-induced akathisia in headache patients.
PG  - 450-6
AB  - The purpose of the research presented in this article was to characterize
      restless leg syndrome (RLS) in a headache population and correlate treatment
      induced risks with dopamine blockers. Fifty patients with severe headache who
      were admitted to an outpatient infusion center were enrolled. The diagnosis of
      RLS was established using the International Restless Leg Syndrome Study Group
      criteria. Patients were screened for baseline akathisia using an akathisia scale 
      and reexamined for akathisia after receiving intravenous infusion with one of
      four dopamine receptor blocking agents as treatment for their headaches. A change
      from baseline to post-infusion assessment of two points on a global assessment of
      akathisia was considered positive for drug-induced akathisia. Our results
      indicated that 41 (82%) of patients had episodic or chronic migraine. The rest
      had new daily persistent headache, cluster, or posttraumatic headache. Seventeen 
      subjects (34%) met the criteria for RLS. Nineteen (38%) of the subjects developed
      drug-induced akathisia. Thirteen (76.5%) of the subjects with RLS developed
      akathisia compared with only 6 of the 33 (18.2%) without RLS (P<.0001). Finally, 
      we concluded that headache patients with RLS are at a greatly increased risk of
      developing drug-induced akathisia when treated with intravenous dopamine receptor
      blocking agents.

TI  - Update on cluster headache.
PG  - 333-40
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Although cluster headache has traditionally been thought of as
      a vascular headache disorder, its periodicity suggests an involvement of central 
      areas such as the hypothalamus. This review covers the past 3 years, which have
      seen remarkable progress in understanding the pathophysiology of circadian
      headache syndromes and have brought exciting news. RECENT FINDINGS: As more
      cluster headache patients are seen by headache specialists, new forms of this
      well-defined primary headache syndrome are being identified. In addition, we
      discuss recent findings with regard to abnormalities in the secretion of
      hormones, genetic influences, neuroimaging of cluster headache attacks, and the
      use of newer substances as preventive therapy in cluster headache. SUMMARY: We
      have entered a new diagnostic and therapeutic era in primary headache disorders. 
      In recent reports, the use of deep brain stimulation of the hypothalamus has
      enabled intractable chronic cluster headache patients to be successfully operated
      upon. Further research in this field is urgently needed and the recent
      possibility of combining deep brain stimulation with positron emission tomography
      will certainly help to unravel the brain circuitry implicated in
      stimulation-produced analgesia. The time has come to use the evidence for a
      disorder of circadian rhythm in cluster headache to further the development of
      chronobiotics in the treatment of this disorder.

TI  - Neurosurgery for intractable obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression:
      critical issues.
PG  - 199-212
AB  - Intractable OCD and depression cause tremendous suffering in those affected and
      in their families. The impaired ability to function of those affected imposes a
      heavy burden on society as a whole. Existing data suggest that lesion procedures 
      offer benefit to a large proportion (ranging from about 35%-70%) of patients with
      intractable OCD and depression. The literature also suggests that although
      serious long-term adverse events have occurred, these are relatively infrequent
      overall. Methodologic limitations of the earlier reports on any of these
      procedures were described previously in this article. The major academic centers 
      conducting this work have since been obtaining systematic prospective data using 
      modern assessment tools. Nevertheless, even with improved methodologies, more
      recent studies confront some remaining issues that have been difficult to
      overcome fully. First, the number of patients who have received any one procedure
      has been relatively small, constraining statistical power. This limits the
      ability of researchers to enhance patient selection based on clinical
      characteristics. This is important, because patients with intractable OCD and
      depression referred for neurosurgery have high rates of comorbid Axis I
      diagnoses, personality disorders, and functional impairments, which may have
      value in predicting response. Other features, such as age of onset, chronicity,
      and symptom subtypes, may be likewise useful. Another key factor in response may 
      be postoperative management, which has varied most over time but also across
      patients enrolled in trials. As noted previously, randomized controlled trials of
      neurosurgical treatment for intractable psychiatric illness have not been
      reported, although one has been proposed for gamma knife capsulotomy in
      intractable OCD [23]. The development of deep brain stimulation has also made
      sham-controlled studies possible and also allows within-patient designs to be
      considered. Bearing these problems in mind, the literature does provide important
      guidance on a number of key points, including approaches to referral, patient
      selection, and the need for long-term prospective follow-up and postoperative
      management. Nevertheless, important gaps in knowledge remain in all these areas. 
      Research is expected to narrow these gaps in a number of ways, including patient 
      selection, optimizing the procedures themselves, and understanding the mechanisms
      of therapeutic action. Neuroimaging studies will play a key role in achieving
      these aims (see the article by Rauch in this issue). So will cross-species
      translational research on the anatomy and physiology of the pathways implicated
      in the pathophysiology and response to treatment in these disorders. Future
      research in psychiatric neurosurgery must proceed cautiously. A recent editorial 
      statement of the OCD-DBS Collaborative Group [26] recommends a minimum set of
      standards for any multidisciplinary teams contemplating work in this domain. The 
      rationale for those standards is found throughout this issue and is especially
      developed in the article by Fins. The need for safe and effective therapeutic
      options for people suffering with these severe illnesses is just as clear. The
      experience over the last several decades provides grounds for careful optimism
      that refined lesion procedures or reversible deep brain stimulation may relieve
      suffering and improve the lives of people with these devastating disorders.

TI  - The use of gabapentin for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia.
PG  - 852-89
AB  - BACKGROUND: Varicella-zoster virus causes chickenpox and can reemerge later in
      life to cause herpes zoster or shingles. One of the most common and disabling
      complications of herpes zoster is postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). OBJECTIVES: This 
      article reviews the current primary literature about the efficacy and
      tolerability of gabapentin for the treatment of PHN. Gabapentin pharmacokinetics 
      and drug interactions are also reviewed. METHODS: A literature search in the
      English language was conducted using OVID Web, which contained the following
      databases: MEDLINE (1966-present), EMBASE (1980-2002), Current Contents/Clinical 
      Medicine (1999-2002), Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (1898-present),
      Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews (fourth quarter, 2002), and International
      Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-2002). Search terms used were postherpetic
      neuralgia; zoster; gabapentin; neuropathic pain; pain; pharmacoeconomic; cost;
      controlled clinical trial; randomized, controlled trial; postherpetic neuralgia
      and gabapentin; gabapentin and pain; treatment and postherpetic neuralgia;
      gabapentin and age; gabapentin and gender; gabapentin and ethnicity; and
      gabapentin and pharmacokinetics. RESULTS: Gabapentin displays nonlinear
      absorption kinetics, is minimally protein bound (< 3%), has a high mean (SD)
      volume of distribution (50.4 [8.0] L), and is excreted via the kidneys as
      unchanged drug. Two randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter
      clinical trials demonstrated the effectiveness of gabapentin at doses of up to
      3600 mg/d to significantly reduce pain (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001), improve sleep (P
      < 0.01), and improve some parameters on the Short Form-McGill Pain Questionnaire 
      (P < 0.05). Dizziness and somnolence were the most common side effects leading to
      withdrawal from the trials. The recommended dosage in adults is 300 mg at bedtime
      on day 1,300 mg BID on day 2, and 300 mg TID on day 3, titrating up as needed to 
      2400 to 3600 mg/d. To reduce adverse events in patients with renal impairment,
      the dose should be adjusted based on the patient's creatinine clearance.
      CONCLUSIONS: Gabapentin appears to be effective and well tolerated for the
      short-term treatment of PHN. However, future controlled studies are needed to
      determine whether the effectiveness of gabapentin for PHN is maintained for > 2
      months, to establish the optimal dose of gabapentin for PHN, and to compare the
      efficacy of gabapentin with that of other pharmacologic agents used for the
      treatment of PHN.

AB  - PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this report is to review both fundamental
      studies in laboratory animals and preliminary clinical data suggesting that
      certain drugs may affect behavioural recovery after brain injury. MAIN OUTCOMES
      AND RESULTS: Laboratory studies show that systemically-administered drugs that
      affect specific central neurotransmitters including norepinephrine and GABA
      influence affect recovery in a predictable manner. Although some drugs such as
      d-amphetamine have the potential to enhance recovery, others such as neuroleptics
      and other central dopamine receptor antagonists, benzodiazepines and the
      anti-convulsants phenytoin and phenobarbital may be detrimental. In one study,
      72% of patients with traumatic brain injury received one or a combination of the 
      drugs that may impair recovery based on both animal experiments and studies in
      recovering stroke patients. CONCLUSIONS: Until the true impact of these classes
      of drugs are better understood, care should be exercised in the use of
      medications that may interfere with the recovery process in patients with
      traumatic brain injury. Additional research needs to be completed before the
      clinical efficacy of drugs that may enhance recovery can be established.

TI  - The KEEPER trial: levetiracetam adjunctive treatment of partial-onset seizures in
      an open-label community-based study.
PG  - 153-61
AB  - PURPOSE: Three randomized, placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated the safety
      and efficacy of levetiracetam, a new antiepileptic medication, as add-on therapy 
      for partial-onset seizures. The purpose of this study was to gather additional
      safety and efficacy data on levetiracetam in the real-world setting of
      community-based practice. METHODS: This was a phase IV prospective, open-label,
      multicenter, community-based trial. A total of 1030 patients (intent-to-treat
      (ITT) population) at least 16 years old (mean, 42.2 years) with partial-onset
      seizures were enrolled by over 300 investigators. Patients whose partial-onset
      seizures were inadequately controlled on their current medications had
      levetiracetam 500 mg bid added to their regimens. The levetiracetam dose was
      increased by 500 mg bid at the end of weeks 2 and 4 to a maximum dose of 1500 mg 
      bid, unless the patient had been seizure-free during the preceding 2-week period.
      The dose was then to remain the same for 12 weeks. The main outcome measures were
      reduction in seizure frequency, global evaluation scale (GES), and adverse
      events. RESULTS: During the 16 weeks of the trial, 57.9% (542/936) experienced at
      least a 50% reduction in the frequency of partial-onset seizures, 40.1% (375/936)
      experienced at least a 75% reduction, and 20% (187/936) demonstrated a 100%
      seizure reduction. During the last 6 weeks of the study, 66.7% (500/750)
      experienced at least a 50% reduction in the frequency of partial seizures, 52.4% 
      (393/750) experienced at least a 75% reduction, and 42.1% (316/750) demonstrated 
      a 100% seizure reduction. On the investigator-completed clinical impression
      rating (GES), 74.3% (734/988) of patients were considered improved, with 37% of
      patients showing marked improvement. The most common adverse events were
      somnolence, dizziness, asthenia, and headache; these events were predominantly
      mild-to-moderate in nature. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide further evidence
      regarding the efficacy and safety of levetiracetam as adjunctive treatment for
      partial-onset seizures.

PG  - 867-97, viii-ix
AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common disabling neurologic disease of young 
      people affecting between 350 and 450,000 individuals in the United States.
      Substantial advances have been made in the diagnostic assessment and treatment
      interventions over the last 10 years such that we are now able effectively to
      treat both the disease process and the associated symptomatic complaints
      associated with MS. Most patients consult with their primary care physician at
      the time when the first clinical manifestations of MS emerge. These physicians
      play a central role in the early identification and treatment of patients with
      MS. This article emphasizes the expanding diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities
      evolving for the MS patient and the crucial role played by primary care
      physicians in collaboration with neurologists in the coordination of the initial 
      diagnostic and treatment plan.

TI  - Managing spasticity in spinal cord injury: safe administration of bridge boluses 
      during intrathecal baclofen pump refills.
PG  - 2-4
AB  - Intrathecal baclofen now plays an important role in the management of spasticity 
      in a number of neurologic conditions including spinal cord disorders. Dosage
      errors can be a source of significant morbidity and the risk is greatest when the
      clinician is changing solution concentration. When changing concentrations, it is
      imperative to program the pump correctly by incorporating a bridge bolus to
      compensate for the residual baclofen solution in the pump and catheter. This
      paper reviews the appropriate methods to safely calculate the bridge bolus, with 
      an illustrative example.

TI  - Pharmacological approaches to migraine.
PG  - 35-63
AB  - Migraine is a paroxysmal disorder with attacks of headache, nausea, vomiting,
      photo- and phonophobia and malaise. This review summarises new treatment options 
      both for the therapy of the acute attack as well as for migraine prophylaxis.
      Analgesics like aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are
      effective in treating migraine attacks. Few controlled trials were performed for 
      the use of ergotamine or dihydroergotamine. These trials indicate inferior
      efficacy compared to serotonin (5-HT)1B/D-agonists (further on called
      "triptans"). The triptans (almotriptan, eletriptan, frovatriptan, naratriptan,
      rizatriptan, sumatriptan and zolmitriptan) are highly effective. They improve
      headache as well as nausea, photo- and phonophobia. The different triptans have
      minor differences in efficacy, headache recurrence and adverse effects. The
      knowledge of their different pharmacological profile allows a more specific
      treatment of the individual migraine characteristics. Migraine prophylaxis is
      recommended, when more than 3 attacks occur per month, if attacks do not respond 
      to acute treatment or if side effects of acute treatment are severe. Substances
      with proven efficacy include the beta-blockers metoprolol and propranolol, the
      calcium channel blocker flunarizine, several 5-HT antagonists and amitriptyline. 
      Recently antiepileptic drugs (valproic acid, gabapentin, topiramate) were
      evaluated for the prophylaxis of migraine. The use of botulinum-toxin is under
      investigation.

TI  - Pain in terminally ill patients: guidelines for pharmacological management.
PG  - 621-31
AB  - Successful pharmacological treatment of pain in terminally ill patients is
      possible most of the time. It requires a determination of the type of pain
      syndrome (i.e. nociceptive, neuropathic or mixed). Complete pain assessment also 
      requires an understanding of other dimensions of suffering that a patient may be 
      experiencing on psychological, social and spiritual/existential levels. The World
      Health Organization has introduced a three-step approach to treating pain.
      Opioids are the mainstay of therapy for moderate to severe pain at the end of
      life. Familiarity with the pharmacokinetics, equianalgesic dose and adverse
      effects of opioids is necessary for their safe and effective use. In addition,
      adjuvant analgesics such as antiepileptic drugs, antidepressants and local
      anaesthetics are often needed to optimise pain control, especially in patients
      with neuropathic pain. Given the complex aetiology of pain states, combinations
      of classes of adjuvants may sometimes be needed for effective treatment.

TI  - Response to intravenous immunoglobulin in anti-Yo associated paraneoplastic
      cerebellar degeneration: case report and review of the literature.
PG  - 187-90
AB  - Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD) is a debilitating neuro-degenerative
      disease associated with antibodies directed against the purkinje cells of the
      cerebellum. Treatment using chemotherapy or other treatment of the primary tumor 
      to various immunologically directed therapies has been attempted but outcomes
      have been poor. We discuss a patient with ovarian carcinoma and PCD seen in our
      institution who showed a marked beneficial response to intravenous immunoglobulin
      (IVIG) and methylprednisolone. A Medline search from 1966-2002 produced fifteen
      cases of PCD confirmed by antibody testing that were treated with IVIG, either
      alone, or with a combination of other therapies. The clinical characteristics and
      treatment responses of these patients are analyzed in this review. Most patients 
      that were treated with IVIG and had what was defined as a good response were
      treated within one month of symptoms. Patients treated between one month and
      three months often had stable disease and patients treated after three months of 
      symptoms usually had a poor outcome. Early treatment with sufficiently high doses
      of IVIG seems to provide a better chance of treatment success. The additional
      benefit of early high dose intravenous methylprednisolone is unclear. Due to the 
      devastating nature of the disease, a trial of IVIG and steroids is warranted as
      early as possible in a dose of 2g/kg to any patient with a clinical picture of
      PCD and positive antibodies.

TI  - The Lindblom roller.
PG  - 359-64
AB  - Neuropathic pain is caused by injury of the peripheral or central nervous system.
      The neurological examination of the sensory system in neuropathic pain patients
      guides the anatomical localization of the injury. Among the sensory modalities to
      be tested, priority should be given to those subserved by small peripheral
      sensory fibers or by the spinothalamic tract that most commonly are abnormal in
      neuropathic pain patients. Testing of cold and warm perception was traditionally 
      carried out in the clinic using tubes filled with water at different
      temperatures, a cumbersome method that has limited the routine examination of
      these sensory modalities. The Lindblom roller offers a practical and effective
      method of readily testing temperature perception and is among the best available 
      clinical tools for delineating the anatomical boundaries of a sensory
      abnormality. Routinely use of the Lindblom roller shall be standard bedside
      clinical assessment of neuropathic pain patients. To exemplify this statement we 
      describe two patients affected by complex and fluctuating painful sensory
      abnormalities caused by an extradural mass compressing the spinal cord. The level
      of the injury was readily localized with a roller kept at room temperature.

TI  - Monitoring of creatinine kinase during weaning of intrathecal baclofen and with
      symptoms of early withdrawal.
PG  - 489-92
AB  - Abrupt withdrawal from intrathecal baclofen (ITB) can result in severe rebound
      spasticity, confusion, and seizures. It has been recently recognized that abrupt 
      withdrawal from ITB may, in rare cases, result in life-threatening
      rhabdomyolysis, hyperthermia, autonomic disturbances, and sepsis-like
      presentations. Early recognition of the most severe forms of the withdrawal
      syndrome is essential for effective intervention. The common and unique features 
      in such individuals seem to be severe increased spasticity and marked elevation
      in creatinine kinase levels. This case of an individual with T4 paraplegia with
      recurrent episodes of ITB withdrawal associated with severe spasticity and
      elevated creatinine kinase levels who required rapid weaning of high-dose ITB to 
      allow removal of an infected pump and catheter illustrates the value of
      monitoring creatinine kinase levels in evaluation of suspected ITB withdrawal and
      during rapid weaning of ITB when necessary.

TI  - Intrathecal baclofen for spasticity management in Rett syndrome.
PG  - 560-2
AB  - Intrathecal baclofen infusions have proven to be effective for management of
      spasticity during the last two decades. Efficacy of intrathecal baclofen for
      spasticity of spinal origin has been well established and has shown promise in
      treatment of spasticity that is not spinal in origin. Rett syndrome is a
      neurodevelopmental disorder primarily affecting girls and women. Manifested in
      the advanced stages of this syndrome is increased spasticity leading to
      functional decline. Presented is a case report of a 32-yr-old white woman with
      Rett syndrome, diagnosed before the age of 2 yr, and significant spasticity that 
      was successfully managed with intrathecal baclofen. After placement of an
      intrathecal baclofen pump, the dose was increased slowly during 1 yr to 800
      microg/day with good clinical response. There was observed a significant decrease
      in upper and lower limb Ashworth scores, from an average of 3-4 to 2-3, during
      this 1-yr period. The decrease in spasticity in this patient eventually led to
      improved range of motion, positioning, skin care, hygiene, and quality of life.
      Intrathecal baclofen is an effective option in managing severe spasticity from
      Rett syndrome.

TI  - Current management challenges in HIV: tolerability of antiretrovirals and

PG  - 221-33
AB  - The use of antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection has led to substantial
      reductions in morbidity and mortality. Many regimens, such as those combining
      three or more antiretroviral agents, result in near-complete suppression of HIV
      replication. Increased attention to short- and long-term toxicities of
      antiretroviral therapy reflects a number of factors including the indefinite
      duration of antiretroviral therapy required to preserve clinical benefit, the
      variety of antiretrovirals available, the use of antiretrovirals in combinations,
      and the declining incidence of HIV-associated opportunistic disease. Long-term
      success requires therapy to be individualized, carefully balancing toxicities
      with efficacy and resistance.

TI  - Headache case studies for the primary care physician.
PG  - 589-607
AB  - In a given year, over 5% of persons in the United States seek medical care for
      headaches, most often seeing their primary care physician. The five cases here
      review diagnosis and treatment of migraine and other primary headaches,
      medication rebound headaches, and headaches in the elderly including temporal
      arteritis. Although headaches (along with dizziness and back pain) may be one of 
      the least preferred diseases internists see, the increasing number of effective
      treatments may favorably change this opinion and result in better care for their 
      patients.

TI  - Getting the spinal cord to think for itself.
PG  - 805-8
AB  - Despite the interruption in communication between the brain and lower centers by 
      spinal cord injury, many of the neurons engaged in generating locomotion survive.
      Several strategies have been used to activate spinal cord circuitry independent
      of the higher centers, including direct electrical stimulation, pharmacological
      agents, and training programs that involve moving the legs through the motions of
      walking. Ambulatory leg movements are achieved by these interventions, leading to
      substantial functional improvements in the subset of patients with incomplete
      spinal cord injury. The neurobiological basis for these phenomena likely involves
      activity-dependent reconfiguration of synaptic connections within the spinal
      cord. Fostering this process may lead to further benefits for individuals with
      spinal cord injury.

TI  - Efficacy of a low-dose regimen of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride in acute skeletal
      muscle spasm: results of two placebo-controlled trials.
PG  - 1056-73
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride is a muscle relaxant that is effective 
      in improving muscle spasm, reducing local pain and tenderness, and increasing
      range of motion in acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions. Sedation is the
      most common adverse event associated with its use at the usual dosage of 10 mg
      TID. Studies in healthy adults suggest that a lower dose may produce less
      sedation. Because cyclobenzaprine's duration of action is 4 to 6 hours, reducing 
      the dosing frequency to 10 mg BID would create a potentially painful untreated
      interval between doses. The alternative is administration of a lower dose (eg, 5 
      or 2.5 mg) TID. OBJECTIVE: These studies were designed to assess the efficacy and
      tolerability of cyclobenzaprine 2.5, 5, and 10 mg TID compared with placebo in
      patients with acute musculoskeletal spasm. METHODS: In 2 randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials conducted at primary care
      centers in the United States, adult patients with acute painful muscle spasm of
      the lumbar or cervical region were randomly assigned to receive treatment with
      2.5, 5, or 10 mg cyclobenzaprine TID or placebo for 7 days (study 1:
      cyclobenzaprine 5 or 10 mg TID or placebo; study 2: cyclobenzaprine 2.5 or 5 mg
      TID or placebo). The primary efficacy measures were patient-rated clinical global
      impression of change, medication helpfulness, and relief from starting backache. 
      Neither study included a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) as an active
      control. Although physicians frequently prescribe an analgesic or NSAID in
      addition to cyclobenzaprine, these studies were not designed to assess whether
      adding cyclobenzaprine provides a benefit over that of an analgesic. RESULTS: One
      thousand four hundred five patients (737 study 1; 668 study 2), two thirds with
      low back pain and one third with neck pain, were randomized to treatment. Their
      mean age was 42 years, and approximately 89% were white. In both studies,
      patients receiving cyclobenzaprine 5 or 10 mg had significantly higher mean
      scores on the primary efficacy measures compared with those receiving placebo
      (study 1-P</=0.001 cyclobenzaprine 5 and 10 mg vs placebo, all measures at visits
      2 and 3; study 2-P</=0.03 cyclobenzaprine 2.5 mg vs placebo, relief from starting
      backache on day 3 only; cyclobenzaprine 5 mg vs placebo, patient-rated clinical
      global impression of change, medication helpfulness, and relief from starting
      backache at visit 3 or day 7 only). On day 7, significantly more patients
      receiving cyclobenzaprine 5 or 10 mg reported relief compared with placebo
      recipients (P < 0.05 all cyclobenzaprine groups vs placebo). Onset of relief was 
      apparent within 3 or 4 doses of the 5-mg regimen. In the subanalysis of the
      proportion of responders in the pooled 5-mg groups who did and did not report
      somnolence, a meaningful treatment effect was observed on all primary efficacy
      variables in patients who did not report somnolence, suggesting that efficacy was
      independent of sedation. Cyclobenzaprine was well tolerated. Somnolence and dry
      mouth, the most common adverse effects, were mild and dose related. Overall, >/= 
      1 adverse event was reported in 54.1%, 61.8%, and 35.4% of patients receiving
      cyclobenzaprine 5 or 10 mg or placebo, respectively, in study 1 and by 43.9%,
      55.9%, and 35.4% of patients receiving cyclobenzaprine 2.5 or 5 mg or placebo,
      respectively, in study 2. Adverse events were the primary reason for
      discontinuation of treatment in the cyclobenzaprine 5- and 10-mg groups in both
      studies. In study 2, ineffectiveness of therapy was the main reason for
      discontinuation of therapy in the group receiving cyclobenzaprine 2.5 mg.
      CONCLUSIONS: Cyclobenzaprine 2.5 mg TID was not significantly more effective than
      placebo. The cyclobenzaprine 5- and 10-mg TID regimens were associated with
      significantly higher mean efficacy scores compared with placebo. Cyclobenzaprine 
      5 mg TID was as effective as 10 mg TID, and was associated with a lower incidence
      of sedation.

TI  - Staff perceptions of end-of-life care in long-term care.
PG  - 23-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although residential care/assisted living facilities and nursing homes
      have increasingly become a significant site of death for older Americans, little 
      is known about staff perceptions of end-of-life care, perceived need for
      improvement in care, and differences by type of setting. DESIGN, SETTING, AND
      PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-nine staff provided their perceptions of end-of-life care
      for 99 decedents from 74 residential care/assisted living facilities and nursing 
      homes in four states as part of a larger cohort study. Staff were interviewed
      retrospectively regarding care provided during residents' last month of life.
      MEASUREMENTS: Staff reported on 11 areas of end-of-life care, describing the
      importance of each area and the level of improvement they felt was indicated.
      Weighted "need for change" scores were calculated as the product of perceived
      importance and need for improvement. RESULTS: Both residential care/assisted
      living and nursing home staff reported a need for more staff education and
      nursing assistant time, as well as more use of volunteers. The two lowest ranked 
      items for both facility types were involvement of hospice and encouragement for
      staff to attend funeral services. Nursing home staff perceived a greater need for
      improvement than residential care/assisted living staff in all 11 areas.
      CONCLUSION: Results underscore the staffing demands of end-of-life care across
      facility types, and staff desires to be able to provide quality care throughout
      the dying process.

TI  - Challenges in pain management among persons with AIDS in a long-term-care
      facility.
PG  - 51-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Opiate-resistant pain has been studied in cancer for many years;
      however, its existence in end-stage acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has
      captured little attention. This paper examines the existence, prevalence, and
      characteristics of opiate-resistant pain among persons with AIDS receiving end of
      life care at Bailey-Boushay House, an AIDS-skilled nursing facility in Seattle,
      WA. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of consecutive discharges during 1996
      to 1999 examined patients near the end of life with advanced AIDS who had used
      opioid patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) for pain relief. The patients were
      divided into a control group (n = 97) and an opiate-resistant group (ongoing,
      severe pain with morphine use of greater than 100 mg/hr in an alert patient with 
      no response to doubling doses, n = 12). The two groups were compared on the basis
      of current diagnosis of depression, history of injection drug abuse, peripheral
      neuropathy, or central nervous system involvement. RESULTS: Out of a total of 740
      AIDS admissions during the study period, 226 patients were admitted for terminal 
      care. Of these, 109 utilized a PCA for pain control for at least a day before
      death. Twelve (1.6% of all admissions, 5% of terminal patients, 11% of PCA users)
      experienced opiate-resistant pain. No associations with injection drug abuse,
      central nervous system involvement, depression, or peripheral neuropathy were
      found. CONCLUSIONS: Opiate-resistant pain is rare and can be relieved by
      aggressive use of adjuvants for pain treatment. There are no distinguishing
      characteristics that are predictive of this pain syndrome among AIDS patients
      near the end of life. The recognition of,prompt attention to, opiate-resistant
      pain remains a challenge for medical providers.

TI  - Toxicity of kava pyrones, drug safety and precautions--a case study.
PG  - 68-73
AB  - Kava pyrones have been sold in Germany as OTC anxiolytics until June 2002, when
      all preparations with a kava pyrone content of more than 10(-4) of a homeopathic 
      stock solution were withdrawn. Other countries in which kava pyrones have been
      used as anxiolytics, namely GB and the USA, have not followed suit. Kava pyrone
      anxiolytics have been positively reviewed by the Cochrane Collaboration; also
      newer German clinical studies have indicated pharmacological anxiolysis at the
      recommended doses. To use the first choice of treatment, psychotherapy, for all
      uncomplicated cases of pathological fear does not appear to be realistic. Current
      data about kava pyrone toxicity are unclear. Judging from the few well documented
      cases of kava pyrone hepatotoxicity (appr. 2 out of 36) in Germany and
      Switzerland, an immunologically mediated idiosyncratic mechanism appears to be
      most likely, especially at higher doses, whereas a direct toxic mechanism is much
      less likely. No direct results are available for the incidence of kava
      pyrone-related adverse drug effects. From spontaneously reported cases the
      incidences of adverse drug reactions cannot be obtained, a rough estimation
      indicates the incidence of hepatotoxicity to be comparable to those of
      benzodiazepines. Taken together, the withdrawal of kava pyrone-based anxiolytics 
      appears to be an ill founded over-reaction given the lack of superior therapeutic
      alternatives. Neither the case evaluations presented by the BfArM (Bundesamt fur 
      Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte = Federal Office for Drugs and Medical Products)
      nor the complete rejection of proof for therapeutic efficacy of kava pyrone
      anxiolytics are scientifically well founded.

TI  - Restoring function after spinal cord injury.
PG  - 1-15
AB  - BACKGROUND: By affecting young people during the most productive period of their 
      lives, spinal cord injury is a devastating problem for modern society. A decade
      ago, treating SCI seemed frustrating and hopeless because of the tremendous
      morbidity and mortality, life-shattering impact, and limited therapeutic options 
      associated with the condition. Today, however, an understanding of the underlying
      pathophysiological mechanisms, the development of neuroprotective interventions, 
      and progress toward regenerative interventions are increasing hope for functional
      restoration. REVIEW SUMMARY: This study addresses the present understanding of
      SCI, including the etiology, pathophysiology, treatment, and scientific advances.
      The discussion of treatment options includes a critical review of high-dose
      methylprednisolone and GM-1 ganglioside therapy. The concept that limited
      rebuilding can provide a disproportionate improvement in quality of life is
      emphasized throughout. CONCLUSIONS: New surgical procedures, pharmacologic
      treatments, and functional neuromuscular stimulation methods have evolved over
      the last decades that can improve functional outcomes after spinal cord injury,
      but limiting secondary injury remains the primary goal. Tissue replacement
      strategies, including the use of embryonic stem cells, become an important tool
      and can restore function in animal models. Controlled clinical trials are now
      required to confirm these observations. The ultimate goal is to harness the
      body's own potential to replace lost central nervous system cells by activation
      of endogenous progenitor cell repair mechanisms.

TI  - Management of neuropathy and foot problems in diabetic patients.
PG  - 38-55
AB  - Diabetic neuropathy (DN) is a complex set of clinical syndromes that affect
      distinct regions of the nervous system, either singly or combined. DN is the most
      common form of neuropathy in the developed countries of the world and is
      responsible for 50% to 75% of nontraumatic amputations. It is also the most life 
      damaging--once autonomic neuropathy sets in, the mortality rate approximates 25% 
      to 50% within 5 to 10 years. Distal symmetric polyneuropathy, the most common
      form of DN, usually involves both small and large nerve fiber damage. Small nerve
      fiber neuropathies occur early and are often present without objective signs or
      electrophysiologic evidence of nerve damage. The greatest risk is foot ulceration
      and subsequent gangrene. Large nerve fiber neuropathies, which involve the
      sensory and motor nerves, are generally neuropathies of signs rather than
      symptoms. Clinical presentation usually includes a "glove and stocking"
      distribution of sensory loss and the greatest risk is Charcot's neuroarthropathy.
      Diagnosis of DN relies heavily on a careful patient history and physical
      examination. Most critical is that both the patient and the patient's shoes
      should be examined and corrective measures taken. Several studies have shown that
      good diabetes control can significantly reduce neuropathy. As new drugs and ways 
      to enhance nerve blood flow and block pain pathways at different levels are being
      explored, the effective treatment of DN and the reduction of its impact on
      quality of life as well as mortality will become a reality. Patient education and
      preventive strategies, however, are still the best ways to treat the
      complications of neuropathy and reduce the amputation rate.

TI  - Efficacy of a self-management group intervention for elderly persons with chronic
      pain.
PG  - 156-67
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of a self-management group intervention in
      improving physical functioning, mood, and pain among elderly persons with chronic
      pain, and to identify factors that may be associated with improvement. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: Forty-five residents of three retirement communities (86% women;
      mean age, 82.0 years) were assigned randomly to a 7-week pain self-management
      group or an educational booklet control condition. Participants completed
      self-report measures of pain, functioning, depression, and pain-related beliefs
      at baseline, 9 weeks later (after treatment), and 3 months after the
      post-treatment assessment. RESULTS: The self-management group showed
      significantly greater pre- to post-treatment improvement in physical role
      function (P = 0.04) and characteristic pain intensity (P = 0.02). No significant 
      differences were found between groups on measures of pain-related activity
      interference, depression, and pain-related beliefs. Improvement in characteristic
      pain and physical role function was not associated with baseline depression
      scores, pretreatment expectations, or changes in pain-related beliefs.
      DISCUSSION: This study provides preliminary support for the efficacy of a
      self-management group intervention for older adults with chronic pain and has
      implications for future studies of such approaches for this and similar
      populations.

TI  - High dose methadone and ventricular arrhythmias: a report of three cases.
PG  - 321-4
AB  - Three patients who developed torsades de pointes while receiving high dosages of 
      oral methadone (>600mg/day) are presented. In all of the cases, drug interactions
      involving methadone and CYP3A4 isoenzyme system were possible. Two cases involve 
      some previous cardiac impairment. The potential for toxic doses of methadone to
      cause ventricular arrhythmia is raised by these cases. Until further evidence is 
      available it may be prudent to be vigilant for arrhythmias when high dosages of
      methadone (>600mg/day) are used, especially in patients on other drugs that
      interact with the CYP3A4 isoenzyme system, or with conditions that predispose to 
      torsades de pointes.

TI  - Safety, efficacy and determinants of effectiveness of antimalarial drugs during
      pregnancy: implications for prevention programmes in Plasmodium
      falciparum-endemic sub-Saharan Africa.
PG  - 488-506
AB  - Plasmodium falciparum malaria in pregnancy poses substantial risk to a pregnant
      woman and her neonate through anaemia and low birth weight (LBW), respectively,
      and is responsible for up to 35% of preventable LBW in malaria-endemic areas.
      Chemoprophylaxis or intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) with an effective
      antimalarial can ameliorate the adverse effects of malaria during pregnancy.
      Current guidelines from the WHO recommend that women in highly malarious areas
      receive IPT with an effective antimalarial. Two central considerations in
      evaluating drugs for use during pregnancy are safety for the mother and her
      foetus and effectiveness, which is determined by efficacy, cost, availability,
      deliverability and acceptability of the drug. These factors may be scored and
      potential drugs or drug combinations ranked in order of potential effectiveness
      for use in prevention programmes. The seven most promising regimens are all IPT, 
      primarily because they are more easily delivered and less expensive than
      chemoprophylaxis. Currently, IPT with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is more
      likely to have the best overall effectiveness in preventing adverse outcomes
      associated with malaria in pregnancy. Its low cost, wide availability, easy
      deliverability and acceptability make it the clear choice in countries where
      efficacy of the drug remains good. For countries where resistance to SP is rising
      or already high, amodiaquine (alone or in combination with SP or artesunate)
      artesunate + SP, chlorproguanil-dapsone (with and without artesunate) and
      artemether-lumefantrine require urgent evaluation for use in pregnancy.

AB  - In this open-label add-on study of levetiracetam in refractory childhood epilepsy
      syndromes, we studied the effect of a rapid introduction of levetiracetam on the 
      total seizure frequency in 21 children, known to have partial and generalized
      seizures. Starting dosage was 10 mg/kg/day, increased every 4th day by 10 mg/kg
      up to a maximum of 60 mg/kg/day, depending on efficacy and tolerability. In this 
      highly refractory population, 47% showed a seizure frequency reduction of more
      than 50%. Levetiracetam was effective both in partial and generalized seizures,
      with a significant effect on myoclonic seizures. Only mild side-effects were
      observed in four of 21 children, at a dosage of more than 40 mg/kg/day.

TI  - Myoclonus in childhood.
PG  - 41-51
AB  - The term "myoclonus" sounds esoteric, yet it is part of our normal physiology,
      occurring as a muscle jerk on drowsiness or falling asleep, during rapid eye
      movement (REM) sleep, and as hiccoughs. Myoclonus is also a developmental feature
      of the human nervous system, comprising some of the earliest fetal movements. In 
      pathologic settings, myoclonus may be the only neurologic abnormality, as in
      essential myoclonus, but more often it is one symptom of a larger neurologic
      problem. The vast etiologic spectrum of symptomatic myoclonus can be bewildering,
      but defining the underlying problem may provide the opportunity to develop
      specific therapies. Otherwise, treatment is merely symptomatic. The approach to
      the patient should be to verify the nature of the movement disorder and establish
      a specific etiologic diagnosis. A battery of neurophysiologic, neuroradiologic,
      and other laboratory studies is needed to localize the origin of the myoclonus
      and identify causative lesions. Drug treatment is largely empiric but must be
      systematic and aimed at restoring activities of everyday living. Unlike in
      epilepsies, in myoclonus multiple drugs usually must be combined to attain
      functional improvement.

AB  - Tremor in childhood, beginning in the neonatal period, is more common than
      generally appreciated. Although some tremor disorders in children (eg, essential 
      tremor) also affect adults, others (eg, shuddering, jitteriness, spasmus nutans, 
      and vitamin B12-deficiency tremor) are seen exclusively in children. This review 
      covers the etiology, clinical features, and treatment of the major tremor
      syndromes in children, and when appropriate, makes comparisons with similar
      disorders in adults.

TI  - Complementary and alternative medicine use in families of children with cerebral 
      palsy.
PG  - 364-70
AB  - In order to assess patterns of usage of complementary and alternative medicine
      (CAM) in families of children with cerebral palsy (CP), 213 families with a child
      (0 to 18 years) with CP were recruited at the university medical center in Ann
      Arbor, MI, USA as part of a descriptive survey. Two hundred and thirty-five
      surveys were distributed. Mean age of the child was 8 years 6 months (SD 4y :
      9mo) and 56% of the sample was male with 35% full-time independent ambulators,
      while the rest used an assistive device or a wheelchair. Fifty-four percent were 
      in special education classrooms. Families were given a survey on functional
      status of the child with CP, CAM usage of the child and the parent, factors
      influencing the decision to use CAM, demographics, and clinical information. Of
      the families, 56%, used one or more CAM techniques. Massage therapy (25%) and
      aquatherapy (25%) were the most common. Children of families that used CAM were
      significantly younger (7y : 9mo, SD 4y : 7mo) than non-users (9y : 6mo, SD 4y :
      6mo: t-test p < 0.01 two-tailed). Children with quadriplegic CP, with spasticity,
      and those who could not walk independently were more commonly exposed to CAM
      (Pearson's chi2 [P(chi)2] p = 0.01 two-tailed; for mobility, odds ratio [OR] of
      2.5 with regression). Mothers with a college degree had a greater tendency to use
      CAM for their child than those without (P(chi)2 p = 0.01 two-tailed). Fathers of 
      children who used CAM were older than fathers of those who did not (37y : 9mo
      versus 33y : 2mo, p = 0.04 two-tailed). There was no significant difference
      between groups for mother's age, father's education, income, or for population of
      home town. Parents who used CAM for themselves were more likely to try CAM for
      their child (70% versus 47%, OR 2.1), and were much more likely to be pleased
      with the outcome (71% versus 42%, OR 3.5). Child's age (younger), lack of
      independent mobility, and parental use of CAM were the most significant
      predictive factors identified via logistic regression.

TI  - Complications of intrathecal baclofen pumps in children.
PG  - 1-6
AB  - Intrathecal baclofen is increasingly being used to manage severe spasticity in
      children. Although substantial tone reduction with this treatment has been
      documented, complications also occur. In this study, we describe the device- and 
      major non-device-related complications in a group of 100 consecutive children and
      young adults who received 117 intrathecal baclofen pumps for the management of
      severe spasticity. Twenty-four patients (24%) experienced a total of 48
      complications. The most common complication was disconnection of the catheter at 
      its connection to the pump, occurring in 9% of pumps implanted. This complication
      occurred more frequently in pumps with catheter access ports (16%) than in those 
      without ports (2%). Catheter dislodgement from the intrathecal space was the next
      most common complication, occurring in 8% of pumps implanted (13% of pumps with
      ports, 4% of pumps without ports). To decrease the occurrence of the most common 
      complications of intrathecal pumps, we now typically implant pumps without
      catheter access ports, and we use 2-piece catheters. Although the lack of an
      access port may be a disadvantage for troubleshooting, most complications can be 
      detected in pumps without a port. Patient and family education is critical in
      preventing serious consequences of baclofen withdrawal resulting from
      catheter-related complications.

TI  - Medications and substances as a cause of headache: a systematic review of the
      literature.
PG  - 122-36
AB  - Medication- or substance-induced headache is probably an underrecognized entity
      with numerous etiologies, including prescribed medication, over-the-counter
      medication, illicit drugs, anesthetic agents, foods, food additives, beverages,
      vitamins, inhaled substances, and substances used in diagnostic procedures. The
      author performs a systemic review of the literature to provide an exhaustive
      description of the relationship between medications and substances and headaches 
      of various types, along with pathophysiologic mechanisms whenever possible.
      Suggestions for improved identification of this phenomenon and its avoidance are 
      provided. More scientific evaluation of substances and their possible association
      with headache is required with almost all substances indicated herein.

PG  - 653-64
AB  - Intravenous immunoglobulin preparations (IVIG) are known to be effective in the
      treatment of various autoimmune and inflammatory disorders into their
      immunomodulatory, immunoregulatory, and anti-inflammatory properties. Recently,
      IVIG has been utilized in the management of highly sensitized patients awaiting
      renal transplantation. The mechanisms of suppression of panel reactive antibodies
      (PRA) in patients awaiting transplantation are currently under investigation and 
      appear to be related to anti-idiotypic antibodies present in IVIG preparations.
      In this review, the various immunomodulatory mechanisms attributable to IVIG and 
      their efficacy in reducing PRAs will be described. In addition, the use of IVIG
      in solid organ transplant recipients will be reviewed. The adverse events, safety
      considerations, and economic impact of IVIG protocols for patients awaiting solid
      organ transplantation will be discussed.

TI  - Early recognition of neuroleptic malignant syndrome during traumatic brain injury
      rehabilitation.
PG  - 631-7
AB  - Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a rare disorder that manifests with
      hyperthermia, muscle rigidity and autonomic instability. Presented is a case
      series of individuals with traumatic brain injury and agitation who, when treated
      with neuroleptics, developed neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Although the
      incidence of this syndrome is rare, it is associated with significant morbidity
      and mortality. The onset of symptoms inconsistent with the patient's current
      level of recovery should alert the clinician to consider other possible diagnosis
      and failure to distinguish the features of neuroleptic malignant syndrome from
      post-traumatic agitation will delay appropriate intervention for this potentially
      life-threatening disorder.

TI  - Management of neurocysticercosis.
PG  - 577-91
AB  - Neurocysticercosis is a common cause of neurological disease in developing
      countries and a major cause of epilepsy worldwide. A unique characteristic of
      human neurocysticercosis is that the living parasite is very well tolerated in
      human brain, so symptoms and clinical disease primarily result from death of the 
      organism and accompanying inflammatory reaction in the human CNS. Among the
      diverse clinical manifestations of human neurocysticercosis, seizures are the
      most common, but other clinical problems occur, depending upon the localisation
      and viability of the parasite. Although both praziquantel and albendazole are
      effective agents, there is controversy about their role in several forms of the
      disease. Systematic reviews have pointed out the limited quality of available
      data on therapy. At a recent international conference convened to develop
      guidelines for treatment of this disease, areas of consensus and disagreement on 
      the role of antiparasitic therapy were discussed. It was clear to all that
      cysticercosis cannot be regarded as a single disorder; treatment needs to be
      modified based on the location and number of cysticerci and the host response.
      There was a strong consensus that there is no role for antiparasitic drugs in
      patients with only calcified lesions. Studies suggest that patients with single
      enhancing lesions will do well regardless of antiparasitic therapy. Antiparasitic
      drugs are contraindicated in patients with cerebral oedema (cysticercal
      encephalitis). Most experts strongly recommend antiparasitic therapy in patients 
      with multiple subarachnoid cysticerci or giant cysticerci. In patients with
      ventricular cysticerci, endoscopic removal is the preferred therapy. However,
      recent evidence suggests that placement of a ventricular shunt followed by
      antiparasitic therapy is an acceptable alternative. Standard treatment for
      localization-related epilepsy is effective for seizures caused by cysticercosis. 
      In general, seizures are easily controlled in this illness. While many
      controversies regarding the treatment of patients with neurocysticercosis were
      not resolved at the international consensus conference, participants did conclude
      that controlled prospective studies are required to define optimal therapy for
      the infection and that treatment of infected individuals must be individualised.

TI  - Benign familial and non-familial infantile seizures: a study of 64 patients.
PG  - 45-9
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The recently proposed diagnostic scheme for people with epileptic
      seizures and with epilepsy (Epilepsia 2001) includes two idiopathic focal
      epileptic syndromes with onset during the first year of life, the benign familial
      and non-familial infantile seizures. OBJECTIVES: To analyze the electroclinical
      features and evolution in patients with benign familial and non-familial
      infantile seizures. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-four patients (36 males and 28
      females) were evaluated at the Neurology Department of the J. P. Garrahan
      Children's Hospital between February 1990 and December 2001. We analyzed gender, 
      age at onset, duration, manifestations, circadian distribution and frequency of
      seizures, family history of epilepsy and paroxysmal dyskinesias. EEG and
      neuroradiological studies were performed. The semeiology of the seizures was
      analyzed only according to the description in the clinical history. Ictal EEGs
      could not be recorded. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients, 14 girls and 11 boys, had a
      family history of similar seizures with an age at seizure onset of 3 to 22 months
      (median of 5.5 months). Nine patients (36%) had apparently generalized
      convulsions only; five patients (20%) partial seizures only and ten patients
      (50%) had both partial and generalized seizures. Convulsions were brief, during
      wakefulness in all, and occurred in clusters in 12 patients (48%). Interictal EEG
      was normal in 24 patients (96%). Similar seizures and age at onset were found in 
      14 fathers, ten mothers and one uncle of these patients. Twenty-two patients
      (88%) had their last seizure before the age of 30 months. Two siblings of the
      same family later had brief episodes of paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia, which 
      in one of them were associated with infantile seizures. Later, two fathers
      developed paroxysmal kinesigenic dystonia. One of them also had had infantile
      seizures. A second group of 39 patients (25 boys and 14 girls) showed similar
      electroclinical features and evolution but there was no history of infantile
      seizures in first-degree relatives family history of epilepsy was found in 12.8% 
      of second-degree relatives, but the type of epilepsy could not be defined.
      CONCLUSION: This study confirms the existence of a familial benign epileptic
      syndrome in infancy, of probable dominant autosomical transmission. A large group
      also had similar electroclinical features but without a family history. We
      discuss the possible relationships between the two groups and suggest that
      further genetic studies may solve the problem.

TI  - Epilepsy and hypothalamic hamartoma: look at the hand Pallister-Hall syndrome.
PG  - 27-30
AB  - We report the case of a 29-year-old patient, who suffered from drug resistant
      laughing seizures since childhood. The clinical examination was normal, except
      for sequelae of hand and feet surgery during infancy for post-axial polydactyly. 
      Cerebral MRI showed a hypothalamic hamartoma. The association of complex limb
      abnormalities with hypothalamic hamartoma lead to the diagnosis of Pallister-Hall
      syndrome. This syndrome is related to a mutation of gene GLI3, located on
      chromosome 7p13, and its inheritance is autosomal dominant. In the case of
      laughing seizures, a cerebral MRI should be performed to look for a hypothalamic 
      hamartoma. The observation of such lesions indicates the necessity of standard
      radiographies of the hands and feet, to search for associated abnormalities.
      These findings might help to recognize a Pallister-Hall syndrome, thus allowing
      genetic counseling.

TI  - Paroxysmal dyskinesias in childhood.
PG  - 168-72
AB  - We report on clinical features of a large series of patients with paroxysmal
      dyskinesias. Fourteen patients had paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia, with a mean
      age at onset of 7.1 years. In thirteen children the condition was idiopathic and 
      nine of them had a positive family history; the remaining one had a Chiari
      malformation. Response to antiepileptic drugs was good in 60% of the treated
      patients. Six children had paroxysmal non-kinesigenic dyskinesia, with a mean age
      at onset of 8.1 years. Five children were symptomatic because of cerebral palsy
      (two patients), basal ganglia stroke (one patient), and acute inflammatory
      encephalopathy (one patient); the remaining patient's condition was familial with
      autosomal-dominant mode of inheritance. Response to medical treatment was
      unsuccessful contrasting with paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia. Six children had
      paroxysmal exercise-induced dyskinesia, with a mean age at onset of 5 years.
      Their condition was idiopathic, with a positive family history in four. Two of
      these patients had also rolandic epilepsy and writer's cramp, and the syndrome
      had been previously mapped to chromosome 16. Although there have been great
      advances in the genetics of paroxysmal dyskinesias in which an ion channel
      dysfunction has been hypothesized, the diagnosis is still based on clinical
      grounds. The precise classification of the patients with paroxysmal dyskinesias
      is important for therapeutic decisions.

TI  - An East-West approach to the management of central post-stroke pain.
PG  - 27-30
AB  - The development of neuropathic pain following stroke is not uncommon. The
      consequences include significant disabilities and depression. Treatment can often
      be difficult and responses unsatisfactory. We report a patient with severe
      central post-stroke pain (CPSP) of the right leg benefiting from a combination of
      Western multidisciplinary therapies AND acupuncture. A literature search has
      revealed that relatively few studies have been done on the management of CPSP,
      compared with other types of neuropathic pain. Amitriptyline and carbamazepine
      were found to produce positive effects on post-stroke pain in one small study;
      lamotrigine and gabapentin are two newer drugs which appear promising. To the
      best of our knowledge, the use of acupuncture for the treatment of CPSP has not
      been previously reported.

TI  - Seizures and therapy in adolescents with uncomplicated epilepsy.
PG  - 229-36
AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to describe seizures and their therapy among Swedish
      adolescents, aged 13-22, with active but uncomplicated epilepsy. METHOD: The
      adolescents answered questionnaires (158/193). Data were also obtained from
      medical records. RESULTS: Epileptic seizure types could be specified in 92.1% of 
      the cases. Predominant types were Primary Generalised Tonic-Clonic Seizures and
      Partial Complex Seizures with Secondary Generalisation. Clinical diagnoses by
      physicians were unspecified in 25.8%. Ninety percent were on antiepileptic drugs 
      (AEDs), most commonly valproate and carbamazepine. New AEDs were used in 9.3% of 
      the cases and polytherapy in 13.9%. More than 40% of the respondents had seizures
      despite AED treatment. Side effects of AEDs were experienced by 61%, most
      commonly tiredness, concentration difficulties and headache. Patients on
      polytherapy experienced significantly more side effects. The choice of a new AED 
      over a traditional one was not related to seizure type or seizure control.
      CONCLUSIONS: Many adolescents had persistent seizures despite treatment at a
      specialist regional epilepsy centre. This, plus the high reported rate of side
      effects of AED treatment, suggests that treatment is not optimal for the group
      studied. As traditional AEDs strongly dominated treatment possibly newly marketed
      AEDs are underused in this group.

AB  - In the US, millions of people participate in physical activity on a regular
      basis. However, among the many people with epilepsy, few incorporate exercise
      into their daily routine. Whether it is because of parental or physician
      restriction, the fact remains that people with epilepsy are less fit and are not 
      getting the exercise they need. For many years, patients with seizure disorders
      have been discouraged from participating in physical fitness and team sports due 
      to the fear that it will exacerbate their seizure disorder. However, this
      overprotective attitude has been slowly changing in light of more recent data on 
      this subject. The evidence shows that patients with good seizure control can
      participate in both contact and non-contact sports without adversely affecting
      seizure frequency. This article reviews the effects of exercise on seizure
      control among patients with epilepsy. It examines the morbidity and mortality
      associated with exercise, as well as its psychological and physiological effects.
      Various topics concerning antiepileptic drugs and exercise are also discussed.

TI  - Current insights into familial spastic paraparesis: new advances in an old
      disease.
PG  - 43-9
AB  - Hereditary spastic paraparesis (HSP) comprises a clinically and genetically
      heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by progressive spasticity and
      hyperreflexia of the lower limbs. The past few years have witnessed an
      exponential increase in knowledge of this disease and we can now list 19 loci
      mapped on the human genome and eight genes cloned. However, this wider knowledge 
      of the molecular basis of HSP has had limited impact on clinical practice: the
      use of antispastic drugs and regular physiotherapy still remain crucial in the
      therapeutic management of patients. Nonetheless, the identification of new genes 
      mutated in HSP furthers comprehension of the pathomechanisms involved and helps
      in genetic counseling, especially of asymptomatic individuals who request
      molecular analyses.

TI  - Clinical pharmacology of topiramate versus lamotrigine versus phenobarbital:
      comparison of efficacy and side effects using odds ratios.
PG  - 491-503
AB  - Clinical pharmacologists, neurologists, internists, and all health care givers
      must consider the efficacy, safety, and side effect profile of a given
      antiepileptic drug (AED) when determining which drug is best for a given patient.
      The first purpose of this paper is to address whether the "new" AEDs have
      advantages over the "old" drugs. The second purpose is to teach those interested 
      in clinical pharmacology about the use of Web-based information access to answer 
      a neurology/clinical pharmacology problem: to compare the efficacy and side
      effects of topiramate versus lamotrigine versus phenobarbital using odds ratios. 
      Cost of all three AEDs was also compared. A number of new AEDs, including
      topiramate and lamotrigine, have been developed for chronic focal and secondarily
      generalized epileptic seizures. Efficacy of these drugs as anticonvulsants does
      not seem to be superior to that of traditional anticonvulsants such as
      phenobarbital. However, the advantage of the new drugs is a different spectrum of
      possible adverse events. Newer AEDs may or may not induce sedation and may
      minimize noncompliance by reducing side effects of lethargy and cognitive
      impairment. The difficulty in achieving therapeutic dosage because of side
      effects makes one consider whether these agents are "better" than the oldest and 
      most side effect-prone AED, phenobarbital. The new AEDs have less frequent
      interactions, leading to improved tolerability with comedication. This exercise
      compares two "new" AEDs, topiramate and lamotrigine, with phenobarbital by
      evaluating efficacies and side effects using relative odds ratios, a method
      commonly used in drug development research. Development of new algorithms and/or 
      new knowledge will bring beneficial tools to all clinical pharmacologists.

      infection. Mycoses treated in one area may recur because of organism travel from 
      concomitant areas of infection. Failure of patients and physicians to recognize a
      fungal etiology early may lead to more extensive, severe, or difficult-to-treat
      infections. Finally, a patient's concurrent illnesses may play a part in
      susceptibility and ability to manage fungal infections. For these reasons,
      scientists have studied and developed newer antifungal agents with better
      efficacy and greater convenience in dosing. These drugs, however, still have side
      effects and medication interactions that may limit their use in some patients.
      Better efforts to educate patients and physicians alike may aid in faster
      recognition and treatment of dermatophytoses. More research is needed to continue
      to develop drugs suitable for use in a broader range of patients and diagnostic
      tests that may be quicker or more specific than conventional ones.

TI  - A practical approach to fibromyalgia.
PG  - 278-85
AB  - Fibromyalgia is the name given to a collection of symptoms with no clear
      physiologic cause, The constellation of symptoms are clearly recognizable as a
      distinct pathologic entity. The diagnosis is made through clinical observations
      made by the examiner. Differential diagnosis must include other somatic syndromes
      as well as disease entities like hepatitis, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus,
      electrolyte imbalance, multiple sclerosis, and cancer. Diagnostic criteria are
      given as guidelines for the diagnosis, not as absolute requirements. Treatment of
      this condition remains individualized and relies heavily on having a therapeutic 
      relationship with a provider. Treatment of this syndrome needs to be looked at as
      an ongoing process. Goal oriented treatment aimed at maintaining specific
      functions can be directed at helping a patient get restorative sleep, alleviating
      the somatic pains that ail the patient, keeping a person productive, regulating
      schedules or through goal oriented agreements made with the patient. Since this
      syndrome is chronic and may effect all areas of a persons functioning the family 
      and social support system of the person being treated need to be evaluated.
      Patients often seek alternative medical treatments for this problem including
      diet therapy, acupuncture, and herbal therapy. Treatment must involve more than
      just the symptoms presented and the patient can only be treated successfully if
      they are willing to work at changing their own perceptions, and ways of relating 
      to stressors in their world.

TI  - Acquired heterotopic ossification in the settings of cerebral anoxia and
      alternative therapy: two cases.
PG  - 535-44
AB  - Acquired Heterotopic Ossification (HO) has been well described in the literature 
      as a recognized complication following spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury
      and joint arthroplasty. Commonly, large proximal limb joints are affected. The
      underlying mechanisms for ectopic bone formation remain poorly elucidated.
      Post-stroke hemiplegia as a cause of neurogenic HO is rare, and no published
      reports of HO occurring after anoxic brain injury in adults have been documented.
      This study reports two unusual cases of acquired HO: (1) Polyarticular HO
      involving the ankle joint in a 24-year-old Chinese female who suffered severe
      anoxic encephalopathy following near drowning which resulted in persistent
      vegetative state; and (2) Elbow HO in chronic post-stroke hemiplegia occurring as
      a complication of alternative therapy following repeated forceful manipulation by
      a traditional practitioner in a 46 year-old male.

TI  - Droperidol in the emergency department: is it safe?
PG  - 441-7
AB  - Droperidol is an antipsychotic and antiemetic drug that has been used extensively
      by emergency physicians, psychiatrists, and anesthesiologists worldwide since
      1967. It also has been used effectively for other diverse conditions, such as
      treatment of headache and vertigo. As of January 2001, Droperidol was no longer
      available in Europe after its founder, Janssen-Cilag Pharmaceuticals,
      discontinued its distribution. In December 2001, the United States Food and Drug 
      Administration (FDA) placed a black box warning on the use of Droperidol in
      response to an association between Droperidol and fatal cardiac dysrhythmias,
      such as torsade de pointes, resulting from prolongation of the QT interval. In
      this review we closely examine the pharmacology, indications, use, and
      complications associated with Droperidol, and speculate on its future use in the 
      Emergency Department.

TI  - Intrathecal baclofen withdrawal mimicking sepsis.
PG  - 423-7
AB  - Baclofen (Lioresal) is a drug of choice to treat spasticity and is increasingly
      being administered intrathecally via an implantable pump in cases refractory to
      oral therapy. Emergency physicians will likely treat patients with baclofen
      withdrawal or overdose as this treatment becomes more widespread. The syndrome of
      baclofen withdrawal presents with altered mental status, fever, tachycardia,
      hypertension or hypotension, seizures, and rebound spasticity, and may be fatal
      if not treated appropriately. Baclofen withdrawal may mimic other diseases
      including sepsis, meningitis, autonomic dysreflexia, malignant hyperthermia, or
      neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Treatment consists of supportive care,
      reinstitution of baclofen, benzodiazepines, and diagnosis and eventual repair of 
      intrathecal pump and catheter malfunction.

TI  - Hyperthermia following traumatic brain injury: a critical evaluation.
PG  - 163-73
AB  - Hyperthermia, frequently seen in patients following traumatic brain injury (TBI),
      may be due to posttraumatic cerebral inflammation, direct hypothalamic damage, or
      secondary infection resulting in fever. Regardless of the underlying cause,
      hyperthermia increases metabolic expenditure, glutamate release, and neutrophil
      activity to levels higher than those occurring in the normothermic brain-injured 
      patient. This synergism may further compromise the injured brain, enhancing the
      vulnerability to secondary pathogenic events, thereby exacerbating neuronal
      damage. Although rigorous control of normal body temperature is the current
      standard of care for the brain-injured patient, patient management strategies
      currently available are often suboptimal and may be contraindicated. This article
      represents a compendium of published work regarding the state of knowledge of the
      relationship between hyperthermia and TBI, as well as a critical examination of
      current management strategies.

TI  - Benefits and risks of pharmacological treatments for essential tremor.
PG  - 461-81
AB  - Essential tremor can cause significant functional disability in some patients.
      The arms are the most common body part affected and cause the most functional
      disability. The treatment of essential tremor includes medications, surgical
      options and other forms of therapy. Presently there is no cure for essential
      tremor nor are there any medications that can slow the progression of tremor.
      Treatment for essential tremor is recommended if the tremor causes functional
      disability. If the tremor is disabling only during periods of stress and anxiety,
      propranolol and benzodiazepines can be used during those periods when the tremor 
      causes functional disability. The currently available medications can improve
      tremor in approximately 50% of the patients. If the tremor is disabling,
      treatment should be initiated with either primidone or propranolol. If either
      primidone or propranolol do not provide adequate control of the tremor, then the 
      medications can be used in combination. If patients experience adverse effects
      with propranolol, occasionally other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (such as
      atenolol or metoprolol) can be used. If primidone and propranolol do not provide 
      adequate control of tremor, occasionally the use of benzodiazepines (such as
      clonazepam) can provide benefit. Other medications that may be helpful include
      gabapentin or topiramate. If a patient has disabling head or voice tremor,
      botulinum toxin injections into the muscles may provide relief from the tremor.
      Botulinum toxin in the hand muscles for hand tremor can result in bothersome hand
      weakness and is not widely used. There are other medications that have been tried
      in essential tremor and have questionable efficacy. These drugs include carbonic 
      anhydrase inhibitors (e.g. methazolamide), phenobarbital, calcium channel
      antagonists (e.g. nimodipine), isoniazid, clonidine, clozapine and mirtazapine.
      If the patient still has disabling tremor after medication trials, surgical
      options are usually considered. Surgical options include thalamotomy and deep
      brain stimulation of the thalamus. These surgical options provide adequate tremor
      control in approximately 90% of the patients. Surgical morbidity and mortality
      for these procedures is low. Deep brain stimulation and thalamotomy have been
      shown to have comparable efficacy but fewer complications have been reported with
      deep brain stimulation. In patients undergoing bilateral procedures deep brain
      stimulation of the thalamus is the procedure of choice to avoid adverse effects
      seen with bilateral ablative procedures. The use of medication and/or surgery can
      provide adequate tremor control in the majority of the patients.

TI  - Excitotoxic and excitoprotective mechanisms: abundant targets for the prevention 
      and treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.
PG  - 65-94
AB  - Activation of glutamate receptors can trigger the death of neurons and some types
      of glial cells, particularly when the cells are coincidentally subjected to
      adverse conditions such as reduced levels of oxygen or glucose, increased levels 
      of oxidative stress, exposure to toxins or other pathogenic agents, or a
      disease-causing genetic mutation. Such excitotoxic cell death involves excessive 
      calcium influx and release from internal organelles, oxyradical production, and
      engagement of programmed cell death (apoptosis) cascades. Apoptotic proteins such
      as p53, Bax, and Par-4 induce mitochondrial membrane permeability changes
      resulting in the release of cytochrome c and the activation of proteases, such as
      caspase-3. Events occurring at several subcellular sites, including the plasma
      membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria and nucleus play important roles in
      excitotoxicity. Excitotoxic cascades are initiated in postsynaptic dendrites and 
      may either cause local degeneration or plasticity of those synapses, or may
      propagate the signals to the cell body resulting in cell death. Cells possess an 
      array of antiexcitotoxic mechanisms including neurotrophic signaling pathways,
      intrinsic stress-response pathways, and survival proteins such as protein
      chaperones, calcium-binding proteins, and inhibitor of apoptosis proteins.
      Considerable evidence supports roles for excitotoxicity in acute disorders such
      as epileptic seizures, stroke and traumatic brain and spinal cord injury, as well
      as in chronic age-related disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and
      Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A better understanding of
      the excitotoxic process is not only leading to the development of novel
      therapeutic approaches for neurodegenerative disorders, but also to unexpected
      insight into mechanisms of synaptic plasticity.

TI  - The management of persistent pain.
PG  - 444-7
AB  - Persistent pain is a complex mix of physical and psychological symptoms and is
      ideally managed by a biopsychosocial approach. Often the relative contributions
      of family and personal relationships, finances, work, past pain experiences and
      personality outweigh those of the nociceptive or neuropathic processes from which
      most pain originates. Recent advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology
      of pain may lead to improved drug treatments; however, non-drug
      treatments--education, lifestyle modification, exercise and reassurance--should
      be used routinely to improve patients' quality of life. Patients with persistent 
      pain that is difficult to control or has complex psychosocial influences, or who 
      have a history of medication misuse, should be referred to a multidisciplinary
      pain centre. Selected patients may be offered invasive options such as nerve
      blocks or spinal-cord stimulation. The best outcomes are achieved in patients
      treated in group-based pain-management programs using cognitive-behavioural
      therapy to improve physical function, change unhelpful thinking and improve
      patients' understanding of their situation.

TI  - Intrathecal baclofen for the treatment of spasticity of cerebral origin.
PG  - 31-4
AB  - Nurses monitoring children receiving intrathecal baclofen therapy can assist with
      management of these patients by being aware of possible complications related to 
      a change in tone, medication withdrawal, or overdose. The tone management team
      relies on family care providers, school nurses, ambulatory clinic nurses, and
      outside physical and occupational therapists to provide information and updates
      on changes in patient status as needed. Close collaboration and communication
      regarding the child and his/her response to ITB is essential to providing safe
      and effective care for this challenging population of patients.

TI  - Overuse of symptomatic medications among chronic (transformed) migraine patients:
      profile of drug consumption.
PG  - 43-7
AB  - Chronic daily headache and chronic (transformed) migraine (TM) patients represent
      more than one third of the subjects seen in specialized headache centers. Most of
      these patients may overuse symptomatic medications (SM) taken on a daily basis to
      relieve headache and associated symptoms. The conversion to the daily or
      near-daily pattern of headache presentation is thought to be related to the
      medication overuse. The aim of this study was to evaluate the profile of SM
      consumption among transformed migraine patients attending a tertiary center. One 
      hundred thirty three consecutive patients (22 men and 111 women, ages 17 to 80)
      with TM and overuse of SM according to the proposed criteria of Silberstein et al
      (1994, 1996) were prospectively studied. None of the patients were under
      treatment for other conditions. Among them, 73 (54.9%) were using one category of
      SM, while 55 (41.3%) and 5 (3.8%) patients were taking simultaneously two and
      three categories of SM respectively. The categories of overused symptomatic
      medications varied from simple analgesics to narcotics, triptans and combinations
      of ergot derivatives and caffeine and of analgesics and caffeine. The average
      intake per patient per day was of 3 to 4 tablets and mostly of the patients
      overused simple analgesics (isolated or in combination with other substances)
      (75.2%), caffeine containing drugs (71.4%), drugs containing ergotamine
      derivatives (26.1%), triptans (alone or combined) (15.5%), drugs with narcotics
      or ansiolitics (13%) and anti-inflammatory drugs (3.7%). The mechanisms by which 
      the overuse of symptomatic medications may play a role in this transformation are
      uncertain but despite of the necessity of controlled trials to demonstrate the
      real role of such compounds in the development of transformed migraine, this
      study emphasizes the necessity for more rigorous prescribing guidelines for
      patients with frequent headaches.

TI  - Phenytoin-diazepam interaction.
PG  - 659-63
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report a case of phenytoin toxicity potentially associated with
      concurrent diazepam therapy. CASE SUMMARY: A 44-year-old First Nations man
      presented to the emergency department with headache, nystagmus, diplopia, and
      ataxia. Apart from a long-standing seizure disorder, his past medical history was
      unremarkable. The antiepileptic drug regimen of phenytoin, phenobarbital, and
      lamotrigine had been unchanged for almost 5 months. Total phenytoin serum
      concentration reported 2 weeks prior to hospital admission was 8 micro g/L. Two
      days prior to admission, he was prescribed amoxicillin and diazepam; he denied
      use of nonprescription or herbal medications. The serum phenytoin concentration
      drawn in the hospital was 37 micro g/mL. Both phenytoin and diazepam were
      stopped, and the symptoms resolved. His neurologic abnormalities were attributed 
      to phenytoin toxicity caused by an interaction with diazepam. DISCUSSION: The
      literature documenting a potential interaction between diazepam and phenytoin is 
      conflicting. Case reports and controlled studies have demonstrated both increases
      and decreases in serum phenytoin concentrations when these agents were
      administered concomitantly. Phenytoin induces the metabolism of drugs that are
      substrates of CYP2C, CYP2D, and CYP3A; however, phenytoin is eliminated
      predominantly by CYP2C9- and CYP2C19-dependent hepatic metabolism. Diazepam is
      one example of a drug that is extensively metabolized by CYP2C19 and could
      potentially influence phenytoin elimination by acting as an alternate substrate
      for this isoenzyme. In our patient, the timing of drug administration, clinical
      and physical examination findings, and laboratory data suggest that diazepam
      therapy resulted in phenytoin toxicity. Use of the Naranjo probability scale
      indicated a probable relationship between the adverse clinical effects observed
      and phenytoin and diazepam coadministration in this patient. CONCLUSIONS:
      Phenytoin is a known inducer of drugs metabolized by CYP2C, CYP2D, and CYP3A, but
      its own metabolism may be altered by drugs influencing CYP2C9 or CYP2C19, such as
      diazepam. Agents not acting as enzyme inhibitors or inducers, but instead
      behaving as alternate substrates for enzyme-binding sites, may produce clinically
      relevant drug interactions through an underrecognized mechanism.

TI  - Epilepsia partialis continua as a first symptom of multiple sclerosis:
      electrophysiological study of one case.
PG  - 199-203
AB  - RATIONALE: The prevalence of epilepsy in people with multiple sclerosis (MS) is
      higher than in the general population. Sometimes seizures are among the first
      symptoms and can be unusual in their semiology. In rare cases a long-lasting
      focal somatomotor status [i.e., epilepsia partialis continua (EPC)] has been
      reported. CASE REPORT: A 21-year-old male patient presented with a clinical
      picture of EPC as a first symptom of MS at age of 19. A neurophysiological study 
      agreed with a cortical origin of myoclonic jerks. CONCLUSIONS: MS should be
      considered a rare but possible aetiology of EPC in adults.

TI  - Comprehension of affective prosody in multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 148-53
AB  - Deficits in cognition have been repeatedly documented in patients with multiple
      sclerosis (MS), but their ability to comprehend emotional information has
      received little study. Forty-seven patients with MS and 19 demographic controls
      received the comprehension portion of the Aprosodia Battery, which is known to be
      sensitive to the impairments of patients with strokes and other neurological
      conditions. Patients also received tests of hearing, verbal comprehension and
      naming, a short cognitive battery, and the Beck Depression Inventory. Patients
      with MS were impaired in identifying emotional states from prosodic cues. The
      magnitude of the deficits was greatest for patients with severe physical
      disability and under test conditions of limited prosodic information.
      Correlational analyses suggested that the patients' difficulties in comprehending
      affective prosodic information were not secondary to hearing loss, aphasic
      deficits, cognitive impairment, or depression. For some patients with MS,
      deficits in comprehending emotional information may contribute to their
      difficulties in maintaining effective social interactions.

TI  - Mechanisms and management of an incomplete epidural block for cesarean section.
PG  - 39-57
AB  - Epidural blockade is an important option for anesthesia in parturients undergoing
      abdominal delivery. Despite the multiple benefits of this method, there is at
      least one significant downside--a relatively high occurrence of unsatisfactory
      anesthesia that requires intervention. Depending on the presumed mechanism of
      epidural block failure and other clinically relevant factors (e.g., timing of
      diagnosis, urgency of the procedure, and so forth), certain effective measures
      are recommended to successfully manage this demanding situation. In general, it
      is important to make every effort to make the pre-existing epidural effective or 
      replace it with another regional technique, because overall, regional anesthesia 
      is associated with significantly lower maternal mortality. It is important to
      identify a dysfunctional epidural block preoperatively before a maximum volume of
      local anesthetic has been administered. If catheter manipulation does not produce
      substantial improvement, and there is no time constraint, it is safe and
      reasonable to replace the epidural catheter. However, risks associated with
      excessive volume of local anesthetic should be kept in mind. Additional epidural 
      injections or a second catheter placement might be considered under special
      circumstances. Single-shot spinal anesthesia after a failed epidural may provide 
      fast onset and reliable surgical anesthesia. Available data, although limited and
      contradictory, suggest the possibility of unpredictably high or total spinal
      anesthesia. Many authors, however, believe that appropriate precautions and
      modifications in technique make this a safe alternative. These modifications
      include limiting the amount of epidural local anesthetic administered when
      diagnosing a nonfunctioning epidural and decreasing the dose of intrathecal local
      anesthetic by 20% to 30%. If there is no documented block when the spinal is
      inserted, and more than 30 minutes have passed from the last epidural dose, it is
      probably safe to use a normal dose of local anesthetic. Continuous spinal
      anesthesia with a macro catheter might be a dependable alternative, particularly 
      if large amounts of local anesthetic have already been used or the patient's
      airway is a cause for concern. Although there are no reports of combined spinal
      epidural anesthesia being used in this context, it would appear to be an
      attractive alternative. It allows the anesthesiologist to give smaller doses
      intrathecally, while still offering the flexibility of augmenting the block if
      needed. When inadequate epidural block becomes apparent during surgery there are 
      limited alternatives. Depending on the origin and the pattern of inadequate
      anesthesia, options may include psychological support, supplementation with a
      variety of inhalational and intravenous agents, and local anesthetic
      infiltration. Induction of general anesthesia is typically left as a backup
      option, but must be strongly considered if the patient continues to have
      pain/discomfort.

TI  - Selection criteria for the clinical use of the newer antiepileptic drugs.
PG  - 405-21
AB  - In recent years, several new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have been licensed:
      felbamate, gabapentin, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, tiagabine,
      topiramate, vigabatrin and zonisamide. These drugs have proven efficacy as add-on
      therapy in patients with difficult-to-treat partial epilepsy, as 20-50% of
      patients treated in add-on trials experienced a seizure reduction of >or=50%.
      Relatively few trials have been conducted to evaluate these drugs as monotherapy 
      for patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy. In the monotherapy trials that have
      been conducted, the newer drugs were often as efficacious as conventional drugs, 
      and their tolerability was often better. However, the methodology of these trials
      can be criticised. Because of the relative lack of robust data for the newer
      agents, the conventional drugs have thus far maintained their status as
      first-line monotherapy. However, when first-line monotherapy fails, an
      alternative drug has to be chosen from the available conventional and newer
      drugs. This article aims to give detailed background information on the newer
      AEDs in order to enable physicians to make a rational choice from the available
      drugs for individual patients. Data are provided for the different newer AEDs on 
      mechanisms of action; efficacy in refractory partial epilepsy, newly diagnosed
      epilepsy in adults and generalised seizure types; adverse effects;
      pharmacokinetics; and use in special patient categories.

TI  - Preventative treatment for migraine and tension-type headaches : do drugs having 
      effects on muscle spasm and tone have a role?
PG  - 373-81
AB  - Baclofen, tizanidine and botulinum toxin A, agents used to treat disorders of
      muscle tone, have been studied as potential preventative treatments for migraine,
      tension-type headache and other related disorders. The most extensive work has
      been completed with botulinum toxin A. However, there is still a paucity of well 
      controlled, clinical trials with this agent, and overall there have been
      conflicting and oftentimes equivocal results: studies of its use in migraine
      headache have suggested efficacy, whereas those of tension-type headache have not
      shown significant evidence of efficacy. There were few significant adverse events
      associated with the use of botulinum toxin A in these trials. The mechanism by
      which botulinum toxin A may work to prevent headache is not clear. Although
      changes in muscle tone may play a role in the effect of the drug, central
      mechanisms such as effects on neuropeptides involved in the pathogenesis of
      migraine may also be relevant. Further clinical trial work is in progress to help
      determine optimal administration schedules and choice of injection locations with
      botulinum toxin A for specific headache disorders. There has been limited study
      of the use of baclofen, an agent that acts centrally via GABA(A) receptors, in
      migraine and cluster headache, with only two open trials conducted to date. Both 
      of these studies support the use of baclofen in the preventive treatment of
      headache.Tizanidine, which may have both a peripheral and a central mechanism in 
      the locus ceruleus in migraine headache, has been studied in several clinical
      trials. Although the primary mechanism of action of this agent is, like
      clonidine, as an alpha-adrenoceptor agonist, it has little antihypertensive
      effect. Open trials of tizanidine have shown it to be useful in chronic headache.
      One well controlled trial, conducted as a follow-up to an open-label trial in the
      preventive treatment of chronic daily headache, reported tizanidine as having a
      statistically significant benefit over placebo. Also of interest is its use in
      conjunction with a long-acting NSAID to aid in the treatment of rebound headache 
      accompanying the discontinuation of overused acute migraine therapies. In
      conclusion, though limited, the studies suggest the efficacy of botulinum toxin
      A, baclofen and tizanidine in primary headache disorders.

TI  - Lamotrigine versus valproate monotherapy-associated weight change in adolescents 
      with epilepsy: results from a post hoc analysis of a randomized, double-blind
      clinical trial.
PG  - 133-9
AB  - Recent trends toward obesity and associated health risks in children highlight
      the significance of weight gain as a side effect with certain antiepilepsy drugs.
      No previous study has prospectively compared, in adolescents, weight effects for 
      two commonly used antiepilepsy drugs. We report results from a post hoc
      subanalysis of adolescent data from a randomized, double-blind study comparing
      weight effects of lamotrigine and valproate. Patients were > or = 12 years of age
      with new-onset partial or generalized seizures who were randomized 1:1 to
      lamotrigine or valproate. Patients were escalated to a dose range of 100 to 500
      mg/day for lamotrigine and 10 to 60 mg/kg/day for valproate based on clinical
      response, with target doses maintained for 24 weeks. Results are reported for
      adolescents aged 12 to 20 years. Weight changes during maintenance were higher (P
      < .05) in valproate (n = 20) patients than in lamotrigine (n = 18) patients, and 
      change in body mass index was higher (P < .05) in valproate patients at the end
      of the study. At week 32, mean body mass index in the valproate group was above
      the 85th percentile representing "at risk for overweight." Whereas weight
      remained stable in adolescents treated with lamotrigine, weight increased in
      those treated with valproate by week 10 of this study and continued to increase
      at the end of the study.

TI  - Vitamin K deficiency in severely disabled children.
PG  - 93-7
AB  - Vitamin K status was examined in 21 severely disabled children in our hospital
      from September 2001 to August 2002, and 9 children were found to have a vitamin K
      deficiency. The 21 patients were divided into two groups: group A, 9 patients
      with vitamin K deficiency, and group B, 12 patients without vitamin K deficiency.
      The laboratory data and background factors in the two groups were compared
      statistically. In group A, all patients received enteral nutrition and
      anticonvulsants. The protein induced by vitamin K absence-II values were elevated
      in eight patients. Seven exhibited a bleeding tendency. Six developed vitamin K
      deficiency in association with infection and four were treated with antibiotics. 
      All showed a good response to the administration of vitamin K. The patients in
      group A had factors such as use of antibiotics, infection, and elemental
      nutrition at significantly higher rates than those in group B. Data indicating
      nutrition factors such as body weight, caloric intake, total protein level, and
      hemoglobin level were not significantly different between the two groups.
      Severely disabled children suffer from deficiencies of various nutritional
      elements. However, vitamin K deficiency in severely disabled children has not
      been fully investigated. Infection, use of antibiotics, and elemental nutrition
      are risk factors for vitamin K deficiency in severely disabled children. In
      severely disabled children, there might be marginal vitamin K intake via enteral 
      nutrition, so more vitamin K supplementation is necessary, especially with
      infection and use of antibiotics.

TI  - Chronic stimulation of the globus pallidus internus for treatment of non-dYT1
      generalized dystonia and choreoathetosis: 2-year follow up.
PG  - 785-92
AB  - OBJECT: The authors studied the long-term efficacy of deep brain stimulation
      (DBS) of the posteroventral lateral globus pallidus internus up to 2 years
      postoperatively in patients with primary non-DYT1 generalized dystonia or
      choreoathetosis. The results are briefly compared with those reported for DBS in 
      DYT1 dystonia (Oppenheim dystonia), which is caused by the DYT1 gene. METHODS:
      Enrollment in this prospective expanded pilot study was limited to adult patients
      with severely disabling, medically refractory non-DYT1 generalized dystonia or
      choreoathetosis. Six consecutive patients underwent follow-up examinations at
      defined intervals of 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years postsurgery. There were five
      women and one man, and their mean age at surgery was 45.5 years. Formal
      assessments included both the Burke-Fahn-Marsden dystonia scale and the recently 
      developed Unified Dystonia Rating Scale. Two patients had primary generalized
      non-DYT1 dystonia, and four suffered from choreoathetosis secondary to infantile 
      cerebral palsy. Bilateral quadripolar DBS electrodes were implanted in all
      instances, except in one patient with markedly asymmetrical symptoms. There were 
      no adverse events related to surgery. The Burke-Fahn-Marsden scores in the two
      patients with generalized dystonia improved by 78 and 71% at 3 months, by 82 and 
      69% at 1 year, and by 78 and 70% at 2 years postoperatively. This was paralleled 
      by marked amelioration of disability scores. The mean improvement in
      Burke-Fahn-Marsden scores in patients with choreoathetosis was 12% at 3 months,
      29% at 1 year, and 23% at 2 years postoperatively, which was not significant. Two
      of these patients thought that they had achieved marked improvement at 2 years
      postoperatively, although results of objective evaluations were less impressive. 
      In these two patients there was a minor but stable improvement in disability
      scores. All patients had an improvement in pain scores at the 2-year follow-up
      review. Medication was tapered off in both patients with generalized dystonia and
      reduced in two of the patients with choreoathetosis. All stimulation-induced side
      effects were reversible on adjustment of the DBS settings. Energy consumption of 
      the batteries was considerably higher than in patients with Parkinson disease.
      CONCLUSIONS: Chronic pallidal DBS is a safe and effective procedure in
      generalized non-DYT1 dystonia, and it may become the procedure of choice in
      patients with medically refractory dystonia. Postoperative improvement of
      choreoathetosis is more modest and varied, and subjective ratings of outcome may 
      exceed objective evaluations.

TI  - Shoulder pain in hemiplegia revisited: contribution of functional electrical
      stimulation and other therapies.
PG  - 49-54; quiz 56
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Post-stroke shoulder pain is probably the most frequent complication 
      in hemiplegia and has repercussions on motor rehabilitation and the psychological
      equilibrium of the patient. The strategies for prevention and treatment are
      presented. AETIOLOGY: Among the various factors contributing to the occurrence of
      shoulder pain in hemiplegia, some are related to the joint, such as lesion of the
      rotator cuff tendons, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, inferior-anterior subluxation
      of the head of the humerus, whereas others are related to the neurologic lesion
      such as central post-stroke pain, lack of sensibility, unilateral neglect and
      spasticity. PREVENTION: Efforts should be made from the start to keep the
      shoulder in an ideal position at all times and movement of the shoulder and upper
      limb should be carried out with care. TREATMENT: Will be aimed to the cause of
      pain and passive or active range of motion exercises will be encouraged.
      Physical, medical and surgical treatments have improved over the last few
      decades. Functional electrical stimulation in patients with shoulder pain and
      subluxation, applied early after onset of the stroke, has shown beneficial
      positive effects on subluxation, pain and mobility. Efforts should therefore be
      made to better understand the post-stroke shoulder pain in order to provide
      better outcomes of rehabilitation and thus improve quality of life for patients.

TI  - Report of eight new cases of hypnic headache and mini-review of the literature.
PG  - 211-9
AB  - Hypnic headache is a rare condition first described by Raskin in 1988. This
      headache is not included in the first edition of the International Headache
      Society classification (IHC 1st Edition). We describe eight new Italian hypnic
      headache cases and consider our findings in the light of literature data. Our
      cases do not completely fulfil the diagnostic criteria for the syndrome proposed 
      in 1997 by Goadsby and Lipton: four of our patients reported an attack duration
      longer than 60 minutes (ranging from 3 to 10 hours) and five reported unilateral 
      pain. These data are in line with an analysis of all 61 cases published in the
      literature to date, which reveals a pain duration of over 60 minutes in 45.9% of 
      the cases and unilateral attacks in 36%. Hypnic headache will be included in the 
      fourth chapter (Other Primary Headaches) of the revised edition of the
      above-mentioned classification (IHC 2nd Edition).

TI  - Modafinil affects mood, but not cognitive function, in healthy young volunteers.
PG  - 163-73
AB  - Modafinil is a selective wakefulness-promoting agent with beneficial effects in
      narcolepsy and conditions of sleep deprivation. In a double-blind study we
      examined its effects in 30 healthy, non sleep-deprived students (19 men and 11
      women, aged 19-23 years), who were randomly allocated to placebo, 100 or 200 mg
      modafinil and 3 h later completed 100 mm visual analogue scales relating to mood 
      and bodily symptoms, before and after an extensive battery of cognitive tests
      (pen and paper and CANTAB). There were no significant differences between the
      three treatment groups on any of the cognitive tests used in this study. There
      was a significant post-treatment change in the factor measuring 'somatic anxiety'
      and in individual ratings of 'shaking', 'palpitations', 'dizziness',
      'restlessness', 'muscular tension', 'physical tiredness' and 'irritability',
      which was mainly due to significantly higher ratings of somatic anxiety in the
      100 mg group compared with the other two groups. Further changes in mood were
      revealed after the stress of cognitive testing, with the 100 mg group showing
      greater increases in the 'psychological anxiety' and the 'aggressive mood'
      factors (as measured from the Bond and Lader scales).

TI  - Chronic daily headaches in children.
PG  - 485-91
AB  - Chronic daily headache (CDH) or highly frequent headaches are being recognised as
      an increasing problem. In adults it is estimated that up to 4% of the population 
      has CDH, however, this number appears to be lower in children. The actual
      prevalence of CDH in children, however, has not been determined. The simplest
      definition of CDH is > 15 headache days per month. In the international headache 
      society (IHS) criteria, only chronic tension-type headaches and chronic cluster
      headaches are recognised as CDH. Criteria for CDH have been suggested for adults 
      that mirror the IHS criteria. In children, the majority of CDH appear to be
      migraine related. The next revision of the IHS criteria has been proposed to
      include chronic migraine as one of the CDH. Evaluation of CDH needs to include a 
      complete history and physical examination to identify any possibility of the
      headache representing secondary headaches. Treatment and management involves a
      multi-tiered approach, which includes abortive therapy when the headache becomes 
      more severe. With the precaution of avoiding overuse of analgesic medication,
      prophylactic therapy is used to help reduce the characteristics of the headache
      as well as the frequency and mild behavioural therapy.

TI  - Pregabalin: a new anxiolytic.
PG  - 663-72
AB  - Pregabalin (S-[+]-3-isobutylgaba) was designed as a lipophilic GABA
      (gamma-aminobutyric acid) analogue substituted at the 3'-position in order to
      facilitate diffusion across the blood-brain barrier. It was originally developed 
      as an anticonvulsant agent, however it has been shown to be effective in the
      treatment of several disorders including hyperalgesia and behavioural disorders. 
      Although its exact mode of action remains unclear, pregabalin interacts with the 
      same binding site and has a similar pharmacological profile as its predecessor,
      gabapentin (1-[aminomethyl] cyclohexane acetic acid). Its main site of action
      appears to be on the alpha(2)delta subunit of voltage-dependent calcium channels,
      widely distributed throughout the peripheral and central nervous system.
      Pregabalin appears to produce an inhibitory modulation of neuronal excitability. 
      In healthy volunteers, it is rapidly absorbed with peak blood concentrations
      within 1 h and it has a bioavailability of approximately 90%. In preclinical
      trials of anticonvulsant activity, pregabalin is three to ten times more potent
      than gabapentin. It is well-tolerated and associated with dose-dependent adverse 
      effects (ataxia, dizziness, headache and somnolence) that are mild-to-moderate
      and usually transient. There are no known pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions 
      reported to date. Preliminary animal and human studies showed beneficial effects 
      in both ethological and conflict models of anxiety, as well as having some
      sleep-modulating properties. In Phase II and III trials, pregabalin shows
      promising anxiolytic action when compared to placebo in generalised anxiety
      disorder, social phobia and panic disorder.

TI  - Functional assessment following intrathecal baclofen therapy in children with
      spastic cerebral palsy.
PG  - 26-34
AB  - The purpose of this article is to describe outcomes of intrathecal baclofen
      therapy for 29 patients with cerebral palsy, focusing on impairments, functional 
      limitations, and disability. Patients received individualized rehabilitation and 
      were followed up to 24 months. The primary outcome measures were the Ashworth
      Scale and the functional skills and caregiver assistance scales of the Pediatric 
      Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI). Ashworth Scale scores were
      significantly reduced (P < or = .0005). All areas of functional skills and
      caregiver assistance improved. Comparing groups of adults and patients less than 
      18 years, there were no significant differences, but there was a relationship
      between age and dose. Comparing groups of patients in high and low levels of
      independent functional mobility, no significant differences were found. These
      results provide suggestive evidence that the combination of intrathecal baclofen 
      therapy and rehabilitation has positive effects across the dimensions of
      disablement. This study serves as a basis for high-level scientific studies of
      these effects.

TI  - Therapeutic drug monitoring of racemic citalopram: a 5-year experience in Sweden,
      1992-1997.
PG  - 183-91
AB  - Racemic citalopram (CIT) was introduced in Sweden in 1992 for management of major
      depression. During a 5-year period, 1992 to 1997, serum samples of CIT and
      desmethylcitalopram (DCIT) were collected for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)
      from patients from all over Sweden. These samples were accompanied by clinical
      information on a specially designed TDM request form. They represented men and
      women of various ages (11-94 years) usually on multiple concomitant medications
      and treated in a naturalistic setting. The TDM samples eligible for evaluation (n
      = 749), all trough values at steady state, were studied with respect to inter-
      and intraindividual pharmacokinetic variability. Extensive, interindividual serum
      concentration variability was seen on all dose levels. For dose-corrected
      concentrations (C/D) and for clearance (Cl) we found the coefficient of variation
      (CV) to be approximately 55% for all variables (C/D CIT, C/D DCIT, the ratio DCIT
      to CIT, and for Cl CIT). The intraindividual variations over time for the same
      parameters were 30% to 35%. On a population level, signs of a possible saturation
      of CYP2D6 associated with increasing DCIT-to-CIT ratios with increasing daily
      doses was observed. Age and gender affected the pharmacokinetics of CIT and DCIT.
      Women showed significantly higher C/D CIT and C/D DCIT and lower Cl CIT values
      compared with men, and patients aged more than 65 years had higher C/D CIT and
      C/D DCIT and lower Cl CIT values compared with younger patients. Finally,
      concomitant medication affected the outcome of serum concentrations by a general 
      increase in C/D CIT and C/D DCIT but without alteration in the DCIT-to-CIT ratio.
      Thus, this tendency of changes in the CIT disposition when multiple drugs are
      used (and multiple diseases are prevailing?) seems more general in character than
      specific for a certain drug or type of drugs.

      animal handling and housing.
PG  - 130-43
AB  - In experimental neurological models of brain injury, behavioral manipulations
      before and after the insult can have a major impact on molecular, anatomical, and
      functional outcome. Investigators using animals for preclinical research should
      keep in mind that people with brain injury have lived in, and will continue to
      live in, an environment that is far more complex than that of the typical
      laboratory rodent. To yield more reliable and relevant behavioral assessment, it 
      may be appropriate in some cases to house animals in environments that allow for 
      motor enrichment and to handle animals in ways that promote tameness. Experience 
      can affect mechanisms of plasticity and degeneration beneficially or adversely.
      Behavioral interventions that have been found to modulate postinjury brain events
      are reviewed. The timing and interaction of biological and motor therapies and
      the potential contribution of experience-dependent and drug-induced trophic
      factor expression are discussed.

AB  - Benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS), also known as benign rolandic
      epilepsy (BRE) of childhood represents 15% of all childhood epilepsies [Handbook 
      of Epilepsy Treatment (2000)]. A majority of these patients do no require
      treatment; however, in those cases where treatment is justified, the most
      efficacious medication with a benign safety profile should be selected. We
      present three clinical cases of otherwise healthy children with BECTS who were
      treated only with levetiracetam. All three of these children remain seizure-free 
      and are experiencing no reported side effects.

PG  - 83-5
AB  - Intrathecal baclofen is used as a muscle relaxant and antispasmodic in cases of
      spasticity resulting from central nervous system trauma. The baclofen withdrawal 
      syndrome may include hyperthermia, tachycardia, hypertension, seizures, altered
      mental status, and psychomotor agitation. We report a case in which the removal
      of a baclofen pump lead tothe development of severe withdrawal symptoms despite
      oral baclofen replacement therapy. In order to avoid the development of
      withdrawal, adequate doses of GABA agonist agents should be administered
      immediately prior to, and following, baclofen pump removal.

TI  - Treatment of oro-facial hypersensitivity following brain injury.
PG  - 347-54
AB  - A 56 year old man who was 10 months post-severe traumatic brain injury was unable
      to tolerate oral hygiene. He had oro-facial hypersensitivity, oral dyspraxia and 
      limited oral function. Poor oral hygiene with coating of oral structures and
      infection was present. An intensive systematic desensitization programme over 2
      weeks, even at this late stage post-injury, increased oral tolerance and allowed 
      full oral hygiene. Participation in oral hygiene and functional patterns of
      movement also improved, enabling some oral nutritional intake. This case study
      provides controlled evidence, very little of which exists in the literature, to
      demonstrate the effectiveness of these treatment techniques

TI  - Gabapentin dosing for neuropathic pain: evidence from randomized,
      placebo-controlled clinical trials.
PG  - 81-104
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pain is one of the most common reasons for seeking medical attention,
      and neuropathic pain is among the most common types of pain. Despite its
      prevalence, neuropathic pain is often underrecognized and inadequately treated.
      Many cases are refractory to the medications traditionally used for pain, such as
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Tricyclic antidepressants are considered
      first-line agents for neuropathic pain, but their use is limited by unwanted side
      effects and a risk of cardiovascular mortality. OBJECTIVES: The goals of this
      article were to review data on the efficacy and tolerability of gabapentin in the
      treatment of neuropathic pain in adults and to determine the optimal dosing
      schedule. METHODS: Randomized controlled studies of gabapentin for neuropathic
      pain were identified through a search of PubMed and MEDLINE from 1966 to the
      present using the search terms gabapentin, randomized, placebo, and pain.
      Abstracts of identified articles were screened for study size (>100 patients per 
      treatment arm) and use of appropriate efficacy measures. A separate review based 
      on information provided by the manufacturer of gabapentinaand clinical trial Web 
      sites was conducted to ascertain whether there had been any other relevant
      industry- or government-sponsored trials. The manufacturer provided additional
      unpublshed study data. RESULTS: Data from 5 randomized, placebo-controlled trials
      were included in the review, 1 of which has not yet been published. Gabapentin
      was effective in the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic
      neuralgia, and other neuropathic pain syndromes. It relieved symptoms of
      allodynia, burning pain, shooting pain, and hyperesthesia. Adverse effects were
      typically mild to moderate and usually subsided within approximately 10 days from
      the initiation of treatment. Based on available data, it appears that treatment
      should be started at a dose of 900 mg/d (300 mg/d on day 1, 600 mg/d on day 2,
      and 900 mg/d on day 3). Additional titration to 1800 mg/d is recommended for
      greater efficacy. Doses up to 3600 mg/d may be needed in some patients. The
      effective dose should be individualized according to patient response and
      tolerability. CONCLUSION: At doses of 1800 to 3600 mg/d, gabapentin was effective
      and well tolerated in the treatment of adults with neuropathic pain.

TI  - Lamotrigine in patients with bipolar disorder and cocaine dependence.
PG  - 197-201
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bipolar disorder is associated with the highest substance abuse rates
      of any psychiatric illness. Therefore, treatments that stabilize mood and
      decrease drug use or cravings are of great interest. Open-label lamotrigine was
      examined in 30 outpatients with DSM-IV bipolar disorder and cocaine dependence.
      Lamotrigine was either added to existing medication regimens or used as
      monotherapy. METHOD: Lamotrigine was started at a dose of 25 mg/day (12.5 mg/day 
      in those taking valproic acid) and titrated to a maximum dose of 300 mg/day.
      Subjects received a baseline evaluation including a structured clinical interview
      and weekly assessments for 12 weeks with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression
      (HAM-D), Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), 
      and Cocaine Craving Questionnaire (CCQ). At each appointment, a urine sample was 
      obtained, and participants reported drug use during the previous week. The
      subjects consisted of 13 men and 17 women with cocaine dependence and bipolar I
      disorder (N = 22), bipolar II disorder (N = 7), or bipolar disorder not otherwise
      specified (N = 1), with a mean +/- SD age of 35.4 +/- 7.2 years. Data were
      analyzed using the last observation carried forward on all subjects who completed
      the baseline evaluation and at least 1 postbaseline assessment. RESULTS:
      Significant improvement was observed in HAM-D, YMRS, and BPRS scores (p < or
      =.02). Cravings also significantly decreased as measured by the CCQ (p <.001).
      Dollar amount spent on drugs decreased nonsignificantly. Lamotrigine was well
      tolerated, with no subjects discontinuing due to side effects. CONCLUSION:
      Lamotrigine treatment was well tolerated in this sample and associated with
      statistically significant improvement in mood and drug cravings but not drug use.
      The findings suggest that larger controlled trials of lamotrigine are needed in
      this population.

TI  - Therapeutics in pediatric epilepsy, Part 1: The new antiepileptic drugs and the
      ketogenic diet.
PG  - 359-70
AB  - Epilepsy is one of the most common and challenging neurologic disorders affecting
      children. Although various modalities exist to treat pediatric-onset seizures,
      seizures in 25% of children who are diagnosed as having epilepsy remain
      refractory to available therapies. Of the 8 new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs)
      (felbamate, gabapentin, lamotrigine, topiramate, tiagabine, levetiracetam,
      oxcarbazepine, and zonisamide), all but 2 (zonisamide and levetiracetam) have
      received Food and Drug Administration approval for adjunctive use in the
      pediatric population. However, most of the new AEDs used in adults have also been
      used in children, beyond the AEDs' approved indications. The ultimate goal of
      patient management is to choose the therapeutic option that provides the best
      chance of improving the patient's quality of life. Issues that relate to
      treatment choice include the likelihood of seizure recurrence, type and severity 
      of seizures, available AED efficacies and toxicities, need for hematologic
      monitoring, ease of dosing, underlying medical conditions, medication
      interactions, urgency of initiating therapy, and cost. In this review, we discuss
      these issues for each of the 8 new AEDs; we also discuss the ketogenic diet and
      briefly review the older AEDs. Knowledge of the available AEDs will enable the
      practitioner to choose the best drug or drugs for individual patients.

TI  - A mysterious temporal penetrating head wound without fracture.
PG  - 245-53
AB  - Unwitnessed head injuries are often diagnostic and management dilemmas.
      Low-velocity penetrating head wounds are rare. This paper describes a case of an 
      accidental low-velocity penetrating head wound through the soft tissue of the
      temporal region. This lesion resulted in a deep intra-cerebral haemorrhage, after
      the initial assessment revealed no evidence of skull fracture, missile or missile
      track. The diagnostic evaluation and medical course of this case are presented.
      This is the first case in the medical literature of a brain injury by an object
      that penetrated the calvarium at low velocity but which did not produce a
      fracture of the skull. The evolving diagnostic dilemma is outlined to its
      conclusion, through 3 years of follow-up observation.

TI  - Somatic dysfunction during carisoprodol cessation: evidence for a carisoprodol
      withdrawal syndrome.
PG  - 75-80
AB  - Carisoprodol is a commonly used skeletal muscle relaxant with potential for abuse
      because of its active metabolite, meprobamate, and several reports have suggested
      that patients abruptly stopping intake of carisoprodol may have a withdrawal
      syndrome. The authors studied changes in the occurrence of somatic dysfunctions
      in five patients during an 8-day period following discontinuation from large
      doses of carisoprodol. Results showed that the number of somatic dysfunctions
      changed significantly during the withdrawal period. Each patient had an increase 
      in the number of somatic dysfunctions during the first 3 days after cessation of 
      carisoprodol with return to at or near baseline by the eighth day. This was
      reflected statistically in a significant-within-subjects effect for time. Results
      of supplemental analyses revealed a significant component of the effect and a
      trend for the quadratic component to be significant. Increases in the number of
      somatic dysfunctions during carisoprodol discontinuation support the existence of
      a carisoprodol withdrawal syndrome.

TI  - Burning mouth syndrome.
PG  - 135-45
AB  - Burning mouth syndrome is the occurrence of oral pain in a patient with a normal 
      oral mucosal examination. It can be caused by both organic and psychologic or
      psychiatric factors, which can be broken down into local, systemic. psychologic
      or psychiatric, and idiopathic causes. The most frequently associated conditions 
      are psychiatric (depression, anxiety, or cancerphobia); xerostomia; nutritional
      deficiency; allergic contact dermatitis; candidiasis; denture-related pain: and
      parafunctional behavior. Multiple different factors contributing to the oral pain
      are common, and a systematic approach to the evaluation is important.
      Identification of correctable causes of BMS should be emphasized and psychiatric 
      causes should not be invoked without thorough evaluation of the patient. A
      directed history and careful oral examination must be completed to exclude local 
      diseases and identify clues to potential causes. Assessment of medications,
      psychiatric history and background, and selected laboratory and patch tests may
      help identify the etiologies of these symptoms. Treatment should be tailored to
      each patient and may best be managed in a multidisciplinary approach with input
      from dermatologists, dentists, psychiatrists. otorhinolaryngologists, and primary
      care providers. A thoughtful and structured evaluation of the patient with BMS
      has been associated with improvement in about 70% of patients. The remaining
      patients may benefit from empiric therapy with a chronic pain protocol and
      continued supportive interactions.

TI  - An evaluation of antidepressants in rheumatic pain conditions.
PG  - 371-5
AB  - In a randomized, double-blind, parallel study, fluoxetine and amitriptyline were 
      compared with placebo in the treatment of chronic rheumatic pain. A total of 59
      patients were evaluated during 4 wk of treatment and received 20 mg fluoxetine,
      25 mg amitriptyline, or placebo daily. Pain intensity, pain relief, vital
      variables, and global evaluation were used to assess efficacy. To evaluate safety
      variables, the incidence of side effects was noted. Both amitriptyline and
      fluoxetine significantly reduced pain intensity compared with placebo. Similarly,
      pain relief was greater with both amitriptyline and fluoxetine than with placebo.
      At the end of the fourth week, fluoxetine was superior in efficacy to
      amitriptyline. The incidence of adverse effects was significantly greater with
      amitriptyline; dryness of the mouth was the most predominant side effect. We
      conclude that fluoxetine is an effective analgesic with fewer side effects.

TI  - Management of chronic pain. Part I.
PG  - 389-454
AB  - Chronic pain is associated with substantial psychosocial and economic stress,
      coupled with functional loss and various levels of vocational dysfunction. The
      role of a pain center is to focus on chronic pain in a multidisciplinary,
      comprehensive manner, providing the patient with the most effective opportunity
      to manage his or her chronic disease syndrome. This article focuses on methods to
      manage many types of chronic pain and describes a broad range of pharmacologic
      and nonpharmacologic interventions and options available to the patient. Part I
      of this two-part monograph describes pharmacotherapeutic interventions and
      regional nerve blocks. Part II focuses on psychologic assessment and treatment
      and physical therapy. A multimodal management strategy offers patients the
      greatest improvement potential for specific chronic pain syndromes. Cognitive and
      behavioral therapies and physical therapies are described. This combination of
      therapies may provide patients with the skills and knowledge needed to increase
      their sense of control over pain. The integration of appropriate
      pharmacotherapeutic regimens, neural blockades, physical therapy, and psychologic
      techniques maximizes a patient's effectiveness in dealing with chronic pain.
      Three case studies are presented in Part II.

      newly diagnosed diabetic adults.
PG  - 19-24
AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the occurrence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in adults
      without a prior history of type I diabetes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective
      review was conducted of medical records of adults presenting with DKA between
      1987 and 1993. The medical record was reviewed to classify patients as type I,
      type II, or newly diagnosed diabetics and to determine the status of diabetic
      treatment following the episode of DKA in those patients without prior history of
      type I diabetes. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-six patients were included in the
      study; 106 (47%) were classified as type I and 58 (26%) as type II from data
      available in the medical record, and 62 (27%) had DKA as the initial
      manifestation of the disease. Nineteen percent of the patients in whom diabetes
      was a new diagnosis and 52% of the patients who had a prior history of NIDDM were
      > or = 40 years old. Of patients with follow-up of at least 12 months, about 24% 
      of the newly diagnosed and 8% of those with a history of NIDDM were not taking
      insulin. CONCLUSION: DKA occurs in patients with type II diabetes. Older patients
      may present with clinically apparent type I diabetes. Some adults who present
      with DKA do not remain insulin dependent.

TI  - Musculoskeletal pain syndromes that affect adolescents.
PG  - 740-7
AB  - Musculoskeletal pain is one of the most common pains of adolescence, along with
      headache and abdominal pain, and arthralgia is the single most common reason for 
      referral to the pediatric rheumatologist. Not surprisingly, the pediatric
      rheumatologist is frequently called to distinguish organic from functional
      symptoms. During the past decade, the pediatric rheumatology community has been
      evaluating increasing numbers of adolescents and preadolescents who experience
      musculoskeletal symptoms presumably as a defense against emotional stress from
      achievement either in academic work or in sports. To complicate the challenge
      further, coexistent organic and psychologic disturbance is not rare. Clearly,
      organic illness does not protect a patient from emotional plan, and it may be
      most difficult to differentiate nonorganic pain in a patient with a known organic
      illness. Conversely, adolescents with organic illness may use their disease for
      secondary gain. Fear of misdiagnosis of physical illness as psychiatric and the
      notion that all of the patient's complaints should be explained by a unifying
      diagnosis cause diagnostic error in both psychogenic illness with physical
      manifestations and physical illness with psychogenic symptoms.

TI  - Concentration--effect and concentration--toxicity relations with lamotrigine: a
      prospective study.
PG  - 534-8
AB  - This prospective study was designed to ascertain whether measurement of
      lamotrigine (LTG) concentrations in the epilepsy clinic could be used to predict 
      the onset of complete seizure control or the emergence of adverse effects. LTG
      was initiated in doses of 25 or 50 mg daily in 69 patients with newly diagnosed
      or poorly controlled epilepsy and was increased monthly in 50-mg increments until
      the patient became seizure-free for at least 6 months or developed adverse
      effects that abated after a reduction in dosage. LTG and other antiepileptic drug
      (AED) concentrations were measured at each clinic visit but were not supplied to 
      the investigator examining the patients. Overall, 19 patients either withdrew due
      to lack of efficacy or defaulted from the clinic. Of the remaining 50 patients,
      32 (19 monotherapy, 13 polytherapy) became seizure-free at widely varying daily
      LTG doses (median 200 mg, range 25-850 mg) and concentrations (median 3.8 mg/L,
      range 1.4-18.7 mg/L). Likewise, the 18 patients (5 monotherapy, 13 polytherapy)
      who experienced intolerable side effects showed substantial variations in daily
      LTG doses (median 300 mg, range 100-900 mg) and concentrations (median 4.0 mg/L, 
      range 0.4-18.5 mg/L). No useful concentration-effect or concentration-toxicity
      relation with LTG could be demonstrated in this study; therefore, we believe that
      routine therapeutic drug monitoring with this new AED is not currently indicated.

TI  - A guide to the understanding and use of tricyclic antidepressants in the overall 
      management of fibromyalgia and other chronic pain syndromes.
PG  - 1047-52
AB  - The purpose of this review is to present relatively detailed information on the
      characteristics of tricyclic antidepressants, mainly amitriptyline hydrochloride 
      and doxepin hydrochloride, for use as an integral part of the safe and effective 
      management of fibromyalgia and, to a lesser extent, other chronic pain syndromes.
      Data sources include MEDLINE searches in English, relevant reference books and
      textbooks, my personal database and library, as well as personal clinical
      experience. I discuss these data with regard to the pharmacologic
      characteristics, mechanisms of action, adverse effects, and precautions involved 
      with the use of tricyclic antidepressants. Additional information is given on
      drug selection and dosage titration. Much emphasis is placed on the fact that
      while tricyclic antidepressants play a major role in the management of
      fibromyalgia and other chronic pain syndromes, lifestyle alterations (eg.
      physical reconditioning and exercise), as well as behavior modification, are also
      vital to a successful outcome in management.

TI  - Continuous intrathecal baclofen infusion for symptomatic generalized dystonia.
PG  - 934-8; discussion 938-9
AB  - Five patients with generalized dystonia who were refractory to oral medications
      were treated by continuous intrathecal baclofen infusion. Dystonia was related to
      cerebral palsy in three patients and to Hallervorden-Spatz disease in two.
      Responsiveness to intrathecally administered baclofen was evaluated after bolus
      injections in one patient and during continuous infusions via an external
      micropump in four. Patients who responded to trial injections were subsequently
      implanted with a programmable pump for continuous infusion of baclofen. Dystonia 
      in the three patients were cerebral palsy was substantially improved by
      continuous intrathecal baclofen infusion in doses of 500 to 800 micrograms/d.
      Benefit has persisted for > 19 months of continuous infusion. Dystonia in the two
      patients with Hallervorden-Spatz disease was not improved, although the screening
      trial was limited by side effects in one patient and by meningitis in the other. 
      We conclude that continuous intrathecal baclofen infusion is beneficial therapy
      for some patients with generalized dystonia and that additional investigations
      are indicated.

TI  - Familial paroxysmal dystonic choreoathetosis revisited.
PG  - 317-20
AB  - A case of familial paroxysmal dystonic choreoathetosis (PDC) documented by
      video/EEG monitoring is described. The father of the proband is affected by
      exertional cramping but not PDC, lending support to the previous hypothesis that 
      exertional cramping may represent a "forme fruste" or the incomplete expression
      of PDC. Other family members affected by PDC are women, with exercise-induced
      cramping alone found in two men. Two of the women report prolonged exertion as a 
      precipitant of lengthy spells consistent with typical PDC rather than the
      previously described "intermediate," exercise-induced form of PDC. Exertional
      cramping in families affected by PDC may represent the variable expression of the
      "dystonia gene" in male members. Conversely, exercise-induced PDC, both of the
      intermediate and longer form described here, may have a predilection to manifest 
      in women.

TI  - Alpha 2-adrenergic agonists increase cellular lactate efflux.
PG  - 1104-7
AB  - We reported previously that genetic polymorphisms of the alpha 2-adrenergic
      receptor are associated with hyperinsulinemia, diabetes mellitus, and
      hypertension in blacks. The evolutionary driving force for maintaining such
      deleterious mutations in the black population is unknown. Recognizing that
      vascular alpha 2-adrenergic receptors mediate cold-induced vasoconstriction and
      that temperature maintenance is a primary thrust of cellular metabolism, we
      postulated that vascular alpha 2-adrenergic receptors contribute significantly to
      metabolic heat generation in homeotherms such as humans. Using aerobic lactate
      production as an indicator of thermogenesis, we measured metabolic heat
      production in HT29 cells that expressed the gene encoding human vascular alpha
      2-adrenergic receptors. Epinephrine, an alpha 2-adrenergic receptor agonist,
      increased net lactate efflux from 226 +/- 20 to 280 +/- 20 nmol/min (mean +/- SE)
      (P = .06). Clonidine, a more specific alpha 2-adrenergic agonist, increased
      lactate efflux from 110 +/- 6 to 156 +/- 8 nmol/min (P < .01). Similarly, in the 
      presence of physiological concentrations of glucose (5.5 mmol/L), insulin
      increased lactate production from 123 +/- 6 to 175 +/- 10 nmol/min (P < .01).
      Because differences in aerobic glycolysis may also explain the heat intolerance
      and abnormal fuel homeostasis found in genetically hypertensive rats, we also
      measured lactate production in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells isolated
      from stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) and normotensive
      control Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). Vascular smooth muscle cells from SHRSP had
      significantly greater lactate efflux compared with cells from normotensive WKY
      (296 +/- 4 versus 172 +/- 2 nmol/min, P < .001). These differences were not due
      to abnormalities in glucose uptake, as lactate efflux was greater in SHRSP cells 
      compared with WKY cells when dextrose was replaced with equimolar concentrations 
      of fructose (230 +/- 6 versus 138 +/- 2 nmol/min, P < .001). alpha 2-Adrenergic
      agonists increase lactate efflux in HT29 cells, and abnormalities in vascular
      smooth muscle lactate metabolism in genetically hypertensive rats is independent 
      of altered glucose uptake. These data provide support for our hypothesis that
      balanced polymorphisms of the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor could offer protection 
      against cold stress by increasing the thermogenic response associated with
      aerobic lactate production.

TI  - Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, autonomic activity, and hemodynamics in
      patients with heart failure who perform isometric exercise.
PG  - 999-1006
AB  - Effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI) on autonomic responses
      and hemodynamics in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) subjected to
      isometric exercise have not been studied. We tested whether acute ACEI might
      influence the effects of isometric exercise in patients with CHF. In the first
      part of the study we showed that isometric exercise increased blood pressure in
      the control group and in the CHF group, whereas cardiac output increased only in 
      the control group. Stroke volume remained unchanged in the control group, whereas
      it decreased significantly in CHF group. We next analyzed the effect of acute
      ACEI (5 mg ramipril) on the decrease in cardiac output during isometric stress in
      patients with CHF. During isometric exercise mean blood pressure and heart rate
      increased similarly in both groups. However, cardiac output decreased during
      placebo by -0.48 +/- 0.12 L/min (p < 0.01) but not during ACEI. Spectral analysis
      of blood pressure showed an increase (p < 0.01) in the high-frequency
      parasympathetic component from 7.3% +/- 3.6% to 18.1% +/- 9.5% after ACEI.
      norepinephrine plasma levels increased after isometric stress in the placebo
      group, whereas other hormones did not change. ACEI prevented the norepinephrine
      increase after isometric stress. Thus the decrease in cardiac output during
      isometric exercise in patients with CHF was prevented by acute ACEI. The effect
      of ACE inhibition may be related to reduced sympathetic activity.

TI  - Comparison of the effects of clonidine on tyramine- and methoxamine-evoked
      mydriasis in man.
PG  - 269-75
AB  - 1. It has been reported previously that clonidine can potentiate tyramine-evoked 
      mydriasis on the pain-free side of cluster headache patients. We examined whether
      a single oral dose of clonidine (200 micrograms) can also potentiate
      tyramine-evoked mydriasis in healthy subjects, using mydriasis to methoxamine, a 
      directly acting sympathomimetic amine, as a control. 2. Eight healthy male
      volunteers participated in four weekly sessions. In the first two sessions
      (Experiment 1) the effect of clonidine or placebo on the mydriasis to tyramine
      hydrochloride eyedrops (75 mM; 2 x 10 microliters), and in the last two sessions 
      (Experiment 2) the effect of clonidine or placebo on the mydriasis to methoxamine
      hydrochloride eyedrops (20 mM; 2 x 10 microliters) was examined. In both
      experiments subjects were allocated to drugs and sessions according to a
      double-blind balanced design. In both experiments, pupil diameter of both the
      treated and the untreated eyes was recorded in standard ambient light and in the 
      dark, before, and 2 h after clonidine/placebo, via binocular infrared television 
      pupillometry. Salivation (dental roll technique), systolic and diastolic blood
      pressure (sitting), heart rate, and self-ratings of mood and feelings (visual
      analogue scales), were also measured before, and 2 h after the ingestion of
      clonidine or placebo. 3. Both tyramine and methoxamine produced a significant
      mydriasis, which was more prominent in the light condition (change in resting
      pupil size; mm +/- s.e.mean: tyramine/light 1.05 +/- 0.28; tyramine/dark: 0.73
      +/- 0.15; methoxamine/light: 1.65 +/- 0.28; methoxamine/dark: 0.85 +/- 0.15).
      Clonidine produced a significant miosis in the untreated eye which was more
      prominent in the light condition (change in resting pupil size; mm +/- s.e.mean: 
      Experiment 1, light: -1.34 +/- 0.19; Experiment 1, dark: -0.46 +/- 0.1;
      Experiment 2, light -0.97 +/- 0.18; Experiment 2, dark: -0.29 +/- 0.17).
      Clonidine had no significant effect on either tyramine- or methoxamine-evoked
      mydriasis. 4. In agreement with previous reports, clonidine significantly reduced
      salivation (g, mean +/- s.e.mean; Experiment 1: -0.84 +/- 0.22; Experiment 2:
      -0.55 +/- 0.11), systolic blood pressure (mm Hg; Experiment 1: -17.5 +/- 3.76;
      Experiment 2: -23.38 +/- 4.67), diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg; Experiment 2:
      -12.38 +/- 2.05), alertness (mm; Experiment 2: -24.19 +/- 5.40), and anxiety (mm;
      Experiment 1: -13.82 +/- 4.60), indicating the presence of pharmacodynamically
      effective tissue levels of the drug. 5. These results show that a single oral
      dose (200 micrograms) of clonidine causes significant miosis in human subjects,
      and fails to potentiate tyramine-evoked mydriasis. This indicates that the pupil 
      on the asymptomatic side of cluster headache patients is affected differently
      from the pupils of healthy volunteers by tyramine and/or clonidine.

TI  - Fibromyalgia syndrome: a review.
PG  - 1698-712
AB  - Fibromyalgia syndrome includes symptoms of widespread, chronic musculoskeletal
      aching and stiffness and soft tissue tender points. It is frequently accompanied 
      by fatigue and sleep disturbance. Fibromyalgia is more common in women than in
      men, and it occurs at a mean age of 49 years. Differential diagnosis includes
      myofascial pain syndrome and chronic fatigue syndrome. Fibromyalgia is a
      multifactorial problem and no universal treatment guidelines apply to all cases. 
      Pharmacologic therapy may incude tricyclic antidepressants. In addition to
      commonly used pharmacologic therapies, patient education, reassurance and an
      exercise program can each play an important role in relieving the symptoms
      associated with this common musculoskeletal syndrome.

TI  - The sedative and sympatholytic effects of oral tizanidine in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 817-20
AB  - Tizanidine, an imidazoline derivative with alpha 2-receptor-mediated central
      muscle relaxant activity, is in widespread clinical use for the treatment of
      spasticity. To evaluate its possible role in anesthesia we assessed the sedative 
      and sympatholytic effects of orally administered tizanidine in a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, randomized, cross-over study in six healthy male volunteers. 
      Three different doses of tizanidine (4, 8, and 12 mg) were tested and compared to
      clonidine 150 micrograms. The sedative and sympatholytic effects of tizanidine 12
      mg were comparable in magnitude to those of clonidine 150 micrograms, but the
      effects of clonidine were longer lasting. Similarly, the observed decreases in
      arterial blood pressure (diastolic, 13% and 19%; systolic, 10% and 8% for
      tizanidine and clonidine, respectively) and salivation were comparable in
      magnitude but of shorter duration after tizanidine 12 mg than after clonidine.
      Clonidine and tizanidine 12 mg had also similar effects on the secretion of
      growth hormone. Our results indicate that the effects of a single 12-mg oral dose
      of tizanidine resemble those of 150 micrograms oral clonidine, but are of shorter
      duration. Tizanidine may thus be a useful alternative to clonidine as an orally
      active, short-acting alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist in the perioperative period.

TI  - Evidence based general practice: a retrospective study of interventions in one
      training practice.
PG  - 819-21
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To estimate the proportion of interventions in general practice that 
      are based on evidence from clinical trials and to assess the appropriateness of
      such an evaluation. DESIGN: Retrospective review of case notes. SETTING: One
      suburban training general practice. SUBJECTS: 122 consecutive doctor-patient
      consultations over two days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportions of interventions 
      based on randomised controlled trials (from literature search with Medline,
      pharmaceutical databases, and standard textbooks), on convincing non-experimental
      evidence, and without substantial evidence. RESULTS: 21 of the 122 consultations 
      recorded were excluded due to insufficient data; 31 of the interventions were
      based on randomised controlled trial evidence and 51 based on convincing
      non-experimental evidence. Hence 82/101 (81%) of interventions were based on
      evidence meeting our criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Most interventions within general
      practice are based on evidence from clinical trials, but the methods used in such
      trials may not be the most appropriate to apply to this setting.

TI  - A prospective study of coffee drinking and suicide in women.
PG  - 521-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Among the many reported central nervous system effects of long-term
      caffeine use is improvement in mood. OBJECTIVE: To examine prospectively the
      relationship of coffee and caffeine intake to risk of death from suicide.
      METHODS: We conducted a 10-year follow-up study (1980 to 1990) in an ongoing
      cohort of 86 626 US female registered nurses aged 34 to 59 years in 1980, who
      were free of diagnosed coronary heart disease, stroke, or cancer. Information on 
      coffee and caffeine intake was collected by a semiquantitative food frequency
      questionnaire in 1980. Deaths from suicide were determined by physician review of
      death certificates. RESULTS: Fifty-six cases of suicide occurred during 832 704
      person-years of observation. Compared with non-drinkers of coffee, the
      age-adjusted relative risk of suicide in women who consumed two to three cups per
      day was 0.34 (95% confidence interval [CI, 0.17 to 0.68) and 0.42 (95% CI, 0.21
      to 0.86) in women who consumed four or more cups per day (P for linear
      trend=.002). These findings remained essentially unchanged after adjusting for a 
      broad range of potential confounding factors, including smoking habit, alcohol
      intake, medication use (diazepam and phenothiazine), history of comorbid disease 
      (hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or diabetes), marital status, and
      self-reported stress. A strong inverse relationship was similarly found for
      caffeine intake from all sources and risk of suicide. CONCLUSIONS: The data
      suggest a strong inverse association between coffee intake and risk of suicide.
      Whether regular intake of coffee or caffeine has clinically significant effects
      on the maintenance of affect or the prevention of depression merits further
      investigation in clinical trials and population-based prospective studies.

TI  - Long-term intrathecal administration of midazolam and clonidine.
PG  - 63-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical usefulness of the long-term intrathecal
      administration of midazolam and clonidine in patients with refractory neurogenic 
      and musculoskeletal pain. SETTING: Pain Centre, Academic Hospital Groningen,
      Groningen, The Netherlands. PATIENTS: Four patients with chronic benign
      neurogenic and musculoskeletal pain, not responding to conventional analgesic
      therapy. OUTCOME-MEASURES: Visual Analogue Score, Activities of Daily Living.
      RESULTS: The intrathecal administration of midazolam and clonidine produced
      almost immediate and nearly complete pain relief. Even with continuous use,
      tolerance seemed to be no problem, and side effects appear to be minimal.
      CONCLUSION: Intrathecal infusion of midazolam and clonidine produced promising
      results in four patients with refractory chronic benign pain. Further research
      will be necessary to determine the efficacy and the risk-to-benefit ratio of
      long-term administration of this combination.

TI  - Fever in neurologic diseases.
PG  - 45-66
AB  - In the sense that the brain houses the central mechanism for the regulation of
      body temperature, almost all illnesses that cause fever must interact with the
      central nervous system. There are far fewer diseases, however, in which the
      nervous system symptomatology is of prime diagnostic importance. A helpful way to
      view fever in association with neurologic disease is to roughly divide these
      disease entities into four broad categories: (1) neurologic impairment resulting 
      from fever itself, (2) fever as the sole manifestation of a central nervous
      system infection, (3) systemic febrile disorders with central nervous system
      signs and symptoms, and (4) primary neurologic diseases, either central or
      peripheral in origin, with fever as a presenting sign. This article discusses the
      clinical presentation of disorders in each of these categories as an aid to the
      clinician in diagnosing and differentiating between these syndromes.

TI  - Felbamate levels in patients with epilepsy.
PG  - 280-3
AB  - The usefulness of felbamate (FBM) levels in managing epilepsy patients has not
      been determined. The purpose of the present study was to determine if FBM levels 
      obtained at routine office visits correlated with side effects reported by
      patients. We determined FBM levels by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) 
      of 46 epilepsy patient plasma specimens (41 patients) and assessed medication
      toxicity and seizure frequency by a questionnaire. Thirty-six patients were
      treated with other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs); concomitant AED levels not in
      ranges believed to cause toxicity. FBM levels ranged from 9 to 134 microgram/ml, 
      and were divided into three groups for analysis, resulting in low-range (9-36
      microgram/ml), midrange (37-54 microgram/ml), and high-level (44-134
      microgram/ml) groups. Anorexia and complaints of severe side effects were
      reported significantly more often in the high-level group as compared with the
      low- and midrange groups. Significantly more patients in the high-level group
      (10/13) reported decreased seizure frequency, as compared with 12 of 30 patients 
      in the low- and midrange groups combined. FBM levels correlated linearly with
      doses overall, but most closely in FBM monotherapy patients.

TI  - Simultaneous bilateral pallidoansotomy for idiopathic dystonia musculorum
      deformans.
PG  - 145-8
AB  - A 17-year-old Russian male with a 9-year diagnosed history of dystonia musculorum
      deformans manifested as severe tortipelvis, lordosis, and axial and appendicular 
      spastic dystonia, refractory to medical therapy, is reported. This patient
      underwent a simultaneous bilateral pallidoansotomy with dramatic results.
      Postoperative evaluation revealed sustained alleviation of all dystonic symptoms 
      and abnormal movements. Rapid recovery of useful strength in all limbs as well as
      dramatic improvement in coordination occurred. Bilateral posteroventral
      pallidotomy and pallidoansotomy in the past have proven effective in alleviation 
      of all parkinsonian symptoms, including dyskinesia and dystonia, without the
      concurrent risk of intransigent side effects associated with bilateral
      thalamotomy or other stereotactic surgical procedures. Pallidoansotomy may prove 
      to be the treatment of choice for idiopathic torsion dystonia and merits further 
      investigation.

TI  - A practical approach to the patient with back pain.
PG  - 670-6, 683-4
AB  - Management of back pain is most likely to be effective when treatment is based on
      a specific diagnosis, when patients are followed proactively to recovery and when
      psychosocial factors receive appropriate attention. Selected non-habit-forming
      drugs are useful, especially when taken on a regular basis rather than on an "as 
      needed" basis. Rest is less useful in the management of back pain than previously
      believed and may be counterproductive. Surgery has value only in carefully
      selected patients, primarily those with well-documented sciatic nerve injury that
      has not responded to a course of conservative treatment.

TI  - Randomised trial of pyronaridine versus chloroquine for acute uncomplicated
      falciparum malaria in Africa.
PG  - 24-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The spread of chloroquine resistance poses a serious problem in
      Africa, where falciparum malaria transmission is the highest in the world.
      Pyronaridine, an acridine derivative, has been used successfully to treat malaria
      in China for over 20 years. We compared the efficacy of pyronaridine and
      chloroquine in African adult patients with acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria
      in Yaounde, Cameroon, where chloroquine resistance is well established. METHODS: 
      96 patients were randomly assigned treatment with chloroquine 25 mg/kg or
      pyronaridine 32 mg/kg, both orally and divided over 3 days. Patients were
      followed up for at least 14 days on an outpatient basis. Analysis was by
      on-active-treatment. FINDINGS: After losses from follow-up (11) or because of
      self-medication with quinine (four), 41 patients treated with chloroquine and 40 
      treated with pyronaridine were analysed. Parasite clearance during the 14-day
      follow-up with chloroquine and pyronaridine was 44% and 100%, respectively. All
      patients treated with pyronaridine were afebrile by day 3, and parasitaemia
      cleared by day 4. No serious drug-related side-effects were noted in
      pyronaridine-treated patients. INTERPRETATION: Pyronaridine was rapidly effective
      and well-tolerated in African patients with acute, uncomplicated falciparum
      malaria and may represent an alternative drug against chloroquine-resistant
      malaria.

OAB - PIP: The spread of chloroquine resistance is a major problem in Africa, where
      falciparum malaria transmission is the highest in the world. Pyronaridine is an
      acridine derivative which has been used successfully to treat malaria in China
      for more than 20 years. The efficacy of pyronaridine and chloroquine is compared 
      in African adult patients with acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Yaounde,

      randomly assigned treatment with chloroquine 25 mg/kg or pyronaridine 32 mg/kg,
      both orally and divided over 3 days. The subjects were followed for at least 14
      days on an outpatient basis. Analysis was by on-active-treatment. 11 patients
      were lost to follow-up and 4 self-medicated with quinine. The remaining 41
      patients treated with chloroquine and 40 treated with pyronaridine were analyzed.
      Parasite clearance during the follow-up period with chloroquine and pyronaridine 
      was 44% and 100%, respectively. All patients treated with pyronaridine were
      afebrile by day 3, with parasitemia cleared by day 4. No serious drug-related
      side-effects were noted in pyronaridine-treated patients. It may be concluded
      that pyronaridine was rapidly effective and well-tolerated in African patients
      with acute, uncomplicated falciparum malaria and that it could prove to be an
      alternative drug against chloroquine-resistant malaria.

TI  - Ictal speech manifestations in temporal lobe epilepsy: a video-EEG study.
PG  - 45-9
AB  - To evaluate ictal speech manifestations in complex partial seizures (C PS), we
      reviewed videotapes of 68 consecutive patients who underwent anterior temporal
      lobectomy (ATL) for treatment of intractable epilepsy in Taiwan. In all, 261 CPS 
      were collected from their video-EEG (VEEG) recordings. Cerebral speech dominance 
      was determined by intracarotid injection of sodium amobarbital (Wada test) in all
      cases. Ictal speech manifestations, classified as verbalization or vocalization, 
      occurred in 32 patients (47.1%) with 96 seizures (36.8%). Ictal verbalization
      occurred in 10 patients (14.7%). Ictal vocalization was observed in 28 patients
      (41.2%); including 6 patients who also had ictal verbalization. Thirty-six
      patients (52.9%) had no seizure with ictal speech manifestations. Ictal
      verbalization had significant lateralization value: 90% of patients with this
      manifestation had seizure focus in the nondominant temporal lobe (p = 0.049).
      Seizures of patients with ictal vocalization were not more likely to arise from
      either temporal lobe. We also observed bilingual patients who exclusively spoke
      in their mother tongue (Taiwanese) rather than the acquired language (Mandarin)
      in 72.2% of seizures with verbalization. This finding is significant and contrary
      to a commonly held notion that the acquired language is used in seizures
      associated with speech behaviors.

PG  - 63-70
AB  - Thirty-nine patients with acute low back pain were treated with amitriptyline
      (150 mg/d) or acetaminophen (2,000 mg/d) in a controlled double-blind design for 
      5 weeks. Both groups revealed mild depression, normal coping, and increased
      anxiety at the beginning, with significant improvement in anxiety state and pain 
      at the end of treatment. A repeated measures analysis of variance demonstrated
      that amitriptyline was more effective than acetaminophen in reducing pain
      intensity from the second week of treatment. Age and depression were the only
      significant pretreatment predictors of posttreatment pain. The study evaluates
      the significance of these findings.

TI  - Comparative role of omeprazole in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux
      disease.
PG  - 1252-62
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and its treatment,
      with emphasis on the use and place of omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor. DATA
      SOURCES: A compilation prepared by the National Library of Medicine's Interactive
      Retrieval Services (Medlars II) for the period 1987 to 1994 was used as the data 
      source. STUDY SELECTION: Focus was placed on human comparative clinical studies
      with well-accepted measures of esophageal healing (endoscopy) and symptom
      resolution. Safety data were compiled from the clinical trials literature and
      large postmarketing data studies. Pharmacoeconomic studies selected were judged
      to meet the criteria of good design, presence of sensitivity testing, and
      statement of perspective. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were obtained from double-blind, 
      controlled clinical studies. Other data were extracted from pertinent literature 
      of good design and significant results. DATA SYNTHESIS: Overall, the clinical
      trials of omeprazole for the treatment of patients with erosive GERD demonstrate 
      that omeprazole provides superior therapy in terms of esophageal healing symptom 
      resolution and patient compliance when compared with histamine2-receptor
      antagonists (H2RAs) and antacids. In addition, studies also indicate that
      omeprazole is the most effective agent for the treatment of patients with GERD
      refractory to other treatments. Dosage adjustment is not necessary in patients
      with impaired renal or hepatic function or in the elderly. Finally, although the 
      acquisition drug cost for daily treatment of patients with GERD is highest with
      the use of omeprazole, pharmacoeconomic studies indicate that treatment is more
      cost-effective with the use of omeprazole than with H2RA or antacid treatment
      alone or combined with nonpharmacologic approaches. CONCLUSIONS: Based on
      efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness, omeprazole is the drug of choice for
      the treatment of patients with endoscopically confirmed erosive GERD.

TI  - Effects of dobutamine versus insulin on cardiac performance, myocardial oxygen
      demand, and total body metabolism after coronary artery bypass grafting.
PG  - 653-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose was to study whether the hemodynamic benefit of a
      catabolic catecholamine (dobutamine) induces a certain oxygen cost for the
      myocardial energy demand and whether this effect would be less pronounced if an
      anabolic intervention, such as the administration of insulin, was used. DESIGN: A
      prospective and randomized study. SETTING: A university hospital. PARTICIPANTS:
      Investigation of two comparable groups of cardiac patients. INTERVENTIONS: The
      interventions were postoperative infusions of dobutamine, 7 micrograms/kg/min,
      and of insulin, 1.5 U/kg/h, respectively, over a period of 30 minutes.
      MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The effects of the interventions were measured
      using parameters relating to cardiac work and myocardial oxygen demand. Moreover,
      parameters relating to total body metabolism were also recorded. In the
      dobutamine group, cardiac index (CI) and left ventricular stroke work index
      (LVSWI) increased significantly (p < 0.05) during therapy by 30% and 40%,
      respectively. Cardiac effort index (CEI) and tension time index (TTI) also
      increased (p < 0.05) during therapy by 41% and 30%, respectively. However, in the
      insulin group, CI and LVSWI also increased (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05) during
      therapy, although to a lesser extent (16% and 14%), but CEI and TTI did not
      change at all during therapy. Total body CO2 production (VCO2) and O2 consumption
      (VO2) in the dobutamine group increased (p < 0.05) during therapy by 9% and 11%, 
      respectively, whereas in the insulin group only CO2 production increased (p <
      0.05) by 13%. O2 consumption remained unchanged in this group. CONCLUSIONS: It is
      concluded that dobutamine as well as insulin administration increase cardiac
      performance. However, in contrast to dobutamine, insulin does not appear to
      increase myocardial oxygen demand. Therefore, the anabolic insulin administration
      may represent a more economic pattern of energy-consuming hemodynamic
      intervention than does the catabolic catecholamine administration.

      who demonstrated the classical triad of elevated body temperature, neurological
      disturbances, and anhidrosis. He developed rhabdomyolysis and acute renal
      failure. Eventually he died. Since manifestations of classical heat stroke appear
      to mimic an acute phase response, cytokines are thought to play an important role
      in its pathogenesis.

TI  - Chronic intrathecal baclofen in severely disabling spasticity: selection,
      clinical assessment and long-term benefit.
PG  - 216-25
AB  - Flexor and extensor spasms associated with severe spasticity frequently cause
      pain and suffering in neurologically impaired patients, and greatly interfere
      with comfort and activities. When high doses of oral medications are necessary to
      keep the symptoms under control and are poorly tolerated, the long-term
      spinal-selective intrathecal infusion of baclofen by means of implanted drug pump
      and catheter is a safe, efficient and reversible alternative to destructive
      surgical procedures. Between September 1991 and March 1995, intrathecal baclofen 
      was infused in 18 selected patients out of a series of 42 severely disabled
      spastic cases. We report here our preliminary experience with the criteria of
      selection, the initial intrathecal bolus test and the long-term benefit of the
      selected patients. Our results confirm the dramatic immediate and long-term
      benefit reported in other series. After a period of treatment of 1 to 42 months, 
      13 patients had a complete disappearance of their spastic symptoms without any
      oral treatment, one patient kept unchanged clonus despite the use of low-dose
      oral treatment and another one a severe, not improved dysuria although in both of
      them hypertonia and spasms were abolished. Finally, 2 patients had important
      joint stiffness slightly impairing the benefit from the treatment. None of the 18
      patients had central side-effects related to baclofen. With time, a slight
      increase in daily dose (inferior to 10%) was necessary in most patients.

TI  - Risperidone versus clozapine in the treatment of psychosis in six patients with
      Parkinson's disease and other akinetic-rigid syndromes.
PG  - 556-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: We report six cases of psychosis in patients with akinetic-rigid
      syndromes who were treated with risperidone. RESULTS: Five of the six patients
      experienced intolerable exacerbation of parkinsonism. Four subsequently did well 
      on clozapine therapy. One patient required nursing home placement and a feeding
      gastrostomy as a result of the worsening parkinsonism during risperidone
      treatment, but was able to return home and have the gastrostomy removed after
      switching from risperidone to clozapine. Two of the five patients who worsened
      motorically also developed encephalopathy during risperidone treatment; the
      encephalopathy resolved when the patients were switched to clozapine treatment.
      Only one patient, the youngest, did well on risperidone therapy. CONCLUSION: We
      believe that risperidone is not a substitute for clozapine in treating psychosis 
      in parkinsonian patients and should be used with caution.

TI  - Panic disorder.
PG  - 2055-63, 2067-8
AB  - Panic disorder is a chronic illness that affects at least 3 percent of the
      population. Panic disorder is associated with significant morbidity and an
      increased risk of suicide. Patients generally present with multiple somatic and
      psychologic complaints, including heart palpitations, chest pain, tremor,
      shortness of breath, choking, nausea or abdominal distress, dizziness,
      derealization, fear of losing control or going crazy, fear of dying,
      paresthesias, chills or hot flushes, headache, diarrhea, insomnia, chronic
      fatigue, anxiety and depression. To make the correct diagnosis, these symptoms
      must be evaluated carefully since they also occur with serious cardiovascular,
      pulmonary, endocrinologic and neurologic disorders. Many effective treatments are
      available, including tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake
      inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, benzodiazepines such as alprazolam and 
      clonazepam, and psychotherapy.

TI  - Sudden 'stroke-like' onset of hemiparesis due to herpetic encephalitis.
PG  - 320-1
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Herpes simplex encephalitis usually has a progressive
      cause. Sudden neurological deficits are unusual. METHOD: Case study. RESULTS: A
      17-year-old girl presented with an acute onset focal neurological deficit
      followed one week later by the more classical feature of altered level of
      consciousness, fever and focal seizures. The diagnosis of herpetic encephalitis
      was made by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and by the significant increase in
      cerebrospinal fluid titres of antibodies against herpes simplex type I.
      CONCLUSION: Herpetic encephalitis should be considered in the differential
      diagnosis of acute stroke in young patients even in the absence of encephalitic
      features, if common etiological factors such as embolization and intracerebral
      bleed are excluded.

TI  - Antivertigo medications and drug-induced vertigo. A pharmacological review.
PG  - 777-91
AB  - The approach to drug treatment of vertigo is almost exclusively symptomatic.
      There are 3 major goals for drug treatment of vertigo. The first one is to
      eliminate the hallucination of motion. Drugs with vestibular 'suppressant'
      properties are used for this purpose. The major vestibular suppressants are
      anticholinergic and antihistamine drugs. The second goal is to reduce the
      accompanying neurovegetative and psychoaffective signs (nausea, vomiting,
      anxiety). Antidopaminergics are used for this purpose. The third goal is to
      enhance the process of 'vestibular compensation' to allow the brain to find a new
      sensory equilibrium in spite of the vestibular lesion. Until now, the
      pharmacological manipulation of vestibular compensation has been assessed in
      animals but not in humans with vestibular lesions. Vestibular suppressant drugs
      delay rather than enhance compensation. A variety of other drugs is also used in 
      the treatment of vertigo, including benzodiazepines, histaminergic agents,
      sympathomimetics and calcium antagonists. Their mechanism of action is poorly
      understood. The data base derived from clinical trials evaluating antivertigo
      medications is often questionable because of methodological limitations. This
      explains why habits of prescription are mainly empirical, and why striking
      differences can be noticed from one country to another. We can hope that new
      treatments may emerge from the present interest in receptor subclasses and
      neuromodulators of the vestibular system, and we must be ready to evaluate these 
      potential new pharmacological agents with reliable clinical methods in humans.

TI  - Propriospinal myoclonus in tetraplegic patients: clinical, electrophysiological
      and therapeutic aspects.
PG  - 678-81
AB  - Propriospinal myoclonus is a rare and relatively little studied complication of
      spinal cord injury. We report two patients with an extension-producing myoclonus 
      presenting with tetraplegia caused by cervical trauma. Rhythmic extension jerks
      of the trunk and lower limbs appeared several weeks after their injury in a
      context of severe spasticity. The characteristics of these jerks were determined 
      by polymyography of 12 muscles. They lasted between 306 and 1127 ms with a
      frequency of 0.3 to 0.5 Hz. By comparing latencies their origin was found to be
      in the lumbar cord from which there was a slow (2 m s-1) upward and downward
      spread. Oral treatment with baclofen and sodium valproate was partially
      successful in one patient, but ineffective in the other. Intrathecal 75 or 100
      micrograms baclofen produced a striking, complete disappearance of myoclonus
      prompting the implantation and successful use of a baclofen pump in one patient. 
      These two new cases suggest the existence of a lumbar generator in which
      myoclonic extension jerks originate, and demonstrate a new therapeutic
      alternative in intrathecal baclofen for patients resistant to oral medication.

AB  - Based on the proposed neurotoxic etiology of ALS and possible actions of
      gabapentin and lamotrigine, there is some reason to hope for a beneficial
      response when using these agents in patients with ALS. However, because of the
      lack of evidence supporting this use, the cost of treatment, and the risk of
      adverse effects, there is no rationale for this use before larger, controlled
      clinical trials are completed.

TI  - Opioid-induced muscle activity: implications for managing chronic pain.
PG  - 1118-21
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To increase awareness of opioid-induced involuntary muscle
      hyperactivity and to present management options. CASE SUMMARY: A
      ventilator-dependent 71-year-old man presented with pain caused by metastatic
      lung cancer. Transdermal fentanyl therapy was titrated to 200 micrograms/h. Two
      days later a continuous morphine infusion was initiated because of frequent
      administration of oral morphine solution for breakthrough pain. The patient
      became progressively less responsive and began exhibiting involuntary muscle
      hyperactivity thought to represent breakthrough pain. Despite the inability to
      assess pain control effectively in this unresponsive patient, the morphine
      infusion rate was increased from 22 to 717 mg/h within 7 days. No change in
      muscle hyperactivity was observed. DISCUSSION: Over the last decade involuntary
      muscle hyperactivity has been documented as an adverse effect of chronic opioid
      therapy. The literature describing the incidence of this toxicity, possible risk 
      factors for its development, and recommendations for its management are
      discussed. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of muscle hyperactivity in an unresponsive
      patient receiving chronic opioid therapy may represent opioid toxicity.
      Recommendations for managing opioid-induced muscle hyperactivity include
      reduction of the opioid dosage and/or administration of clonazepam therapy.

TI  - Excitatory amino acids in health and disease.
PG  - 1279-89
AB  - PURPOSE: To review the role of excitatory neurotransmitters in normal mammalian
      brain function, the concept of excitotoxic neuronal death as an important final
      common path in a variety of diseases, and modification of excitatory synaptic
      transmission as an important new pharmacological principle. These principles are 
      discussed, with special emphasis on diseases of importance to older adults. DATA 
      SOURCES: A MEDLINE search from 1966 to May 1995 was undertaken, as well as a
      manual search of current issues of clinical and basic neuroscience journals, for 
      articles that addressed glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate and/or excitotoxicity.
      STUDY SELECTION: A total of 5398 original and 68 review articles were identified 
      that addressed animal and human experimentation relevant to excitotoxic neuronal 
      death. There were 364 articles with potential significance for clinical
      application identified; 132 of the most recent references are provided. DATA
      EXTRACTION: All articles were classified into three categories: general receptor,
      biology pathogenesis of disease, and pharmacotherapy. RESULTS: Glutamic and
      aspartic acids are the physiological mediators of most excitatory synaptic
      transmission. This is critical to several normal nervous system functions,
      including memory and long-term modification of synaptic transmission and
      nociception. Activation of the inotropic NMDA and non-NMDA receptors increases
      transmembrane calcium and sodium fluxes, and the metabotropic glutamate receptor 
      activation results in generation of inositol triphosphate and inhibition of
      adenylate cyclase. Numerous modulatory sites exist, especially on the NMDA
      receptor. Nitric oxide, arachidonic acid, superoxide, and intracellular calcium
      overload are the ultimate mediators of neuronal death. Glutamate re-uptake
      transporters belong to a unique family of amino acid transport systems, the
      malfunction of which is intricately involved in disease pathogenesis. Ischemic
      stroke, hypoglycemia, Parkinson's disease, alcohol intoxication and withdrawal,
      Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and chronic pain syndromes are only some of the
      important clinical neurological disorders with a major pathogenic role for the
      excitatory amino acids. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacological manipulation of the
      excitatory amino acid receptors is likely to be of benefit in important and
      common diseases of the nervous system. Only a few of the currently available
      drugs that modify excitatory neurotransmission, such as remacemide, lamotrigine, 
      and tizanidine, have an acceptable therapeutic index. The identification of
      numerous receptor subtypes, topographic variabilities of distribution, and
      multiple modulatory sites will provide a true challenge to the
      neuropharmacologist.

TI  - Suppressing sympathetic activation in congestive heart failure. A new therapeutic
      strategy.
PG  - 719-24
AB  - Neurohormonal activation with increased plasma renin activity and norepinephrine 
      and vasopressin levels is characteristic of congestive heart failure and
      contributes to further decompensation and poor prognosis. We treated 20 such
      patients with the centrally acting sympathoinhibitory drug clonidine 0.15 mg BID 
      and obtained hemodynamic measurements by cardiac catheterization and plasma
      neurohormone levels before and 2 to 3 hours after the first dose; in 7 patients, 
      these measurements were taken again after 1 week of therapy. The initial dose
      produced significant decreases of 8% in mean arterial pressure, 23% in right
      atrial pressure, 21% in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, 19% in mean pulmonary
      artery pressure, and 12% in heart rate, a 17% increase in stroke volume; and no
      significant changes in cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance. All
      changes remained virtually constant after 1 week. Plasma norepinephrine decreased
      by 28% after the initial dose and 62% after 1 week (P < 0.1), whereas plasma
      renin activity remained essentially unchanged. Plasma vasopressin tended to
      increase, its levels being inversely correlated with those of posttreatment
      norepinephrine (r = -.48 P < .03). Patients with baseline norepinephrine levels >
      0.400 ng/mL has significantly poorer baseline hemodynamic parameters and tended
      to show more improvement with clonidine, although their data remained
      significantly worse than patients whose baseline norepinephrine was within the
      normal range. Sympathetic suppression with clonidine in congestive heart failure 
      reduces preload, heart rate, and arterial pressure, all indexes of myocardial
      energy demand; the lack of significant reduction in systemic vascular resistance 
      and increase in cardiac output might be attributable in part to enhanced release 
      of vasopressin.2+ f2p4

TI  - Leg cramps: differential diagnosis and management.
PG  - 1794-8
AB  - Leg cramps are a common problem, especially in the elderly. The differential
      diagnosis is extensive and includes the following conditions: true cramps, such
      as those related to heat, hemodialysis and electrolyte disturbances, as well as
      idiopathic cramps (the most common type); contractures occurring in conditions
      such as metabolic myopathies and thyroid disease; tetany, which is usually
      related to electrolyte disturbances, and dystonias, such as occupational cramps
      and those related to antipsychotic medications. Other leg problems that are not
      cramps, such as restless legs syndrome and periodic leg movements, also must be
      distinguished. The etiology of idiopathic leg cramps is not clear. Treatments for
      leg cramps include stretching exercises, quinine sulfate and vitamin E, but no
      treatment is conclusively effective. Nonetheless, in many patients relief of
      symptoms is achieved with one or more of these treatments.

TI  - Delayed onset of fatal basilar thrombotic embolus after whiplash injury.
PG  - 2194-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Whiplash injuries are generally seen after rear-end rather than
      frontal car collisions. Previous reports have documented death up to 8 days after
      serious whiplash injury. We report a case of lethal basilar thrombotic embolus
      that occurred 2 months after the patient's injury in a collision. CASE
      DESCRIPTION: After whiplash trauma in a car accident, a 50-year-old taxi driver
      suffered from headache and episodic visual disturbances. Two months after the
      accident he suddenly lost consciousness and was admitted to the hospital. A CT
      scan performed at that time was indicative of basilar thrombosis. The patient
      died 3 days later. The autopsy revealed a thrombosis in the right vertebral
      artery and a thrombotic embolus in the basilar artery. Microscopically, a lesion 
      of the right vertebral artery was found at the level of the atlantoaxial joint.
      CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the whiplash injury caused a lesion of the right
      vertebral artery, leading to repeated transient ischemic attacks and finally to a
      fatal basilar thrombotic embolus. We suggest that in patients with disturbances
      of the vertebrobasilar circulation, attention should be paid to occurrence of
      neck trauma in the preceding 3 months. Further, anticoagulant therapy should
      particularly be considered in patients who after suffering neck injuries develop 
      signs of transient ischemic attacks with origin from the posterior cerebral
      circulation.

TI  - Anticonvulsant drugs for management of pain: a systematic review.
PG  - 1047-52
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine effectiveness and adverse effects of anticonvulsant drugs
      in management of pain. DESIGN: Systematic review of randomised controlled trials 
      of anticonvulsants for acute, chronic, or cancer pain identified by using
      Medline, by hand searching, by searching reference lists, and by contacting
      investigators. SUBJECTS: Between 1966 and February 1994, 37 reports were found;
      20 reports, of four anticonvulsants, were eligible. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
      Numbers needed to treat were calculated for effectiveness, adverse effects, and
      drug related withdrawal from study. RESULTS: The only placebo controlled study in
      acute pain found no analgesic effect of sodium valproate. For treating trigeminal
      neuralgia, carbamazepine had a combined number needed to treat of 2.6 for
      effectiveness, 3.4 for adverse effects, and 24 for severe effects (withdrawal
      from study). For treating diabetic neuropathy, anticonvulsants had a combined
      number needed to treat of 2.5 for effectiveness, 3.1 for adverse effects, and 20 
      for severe effects. For migraine prophylaxis, anticonvulsants had a combined
      number needed to treat of 1.6 for effectiveness, 2.4 for adverse effects, and 39 
      for severe effects. Phenytoin had no effect on the irritable bowel syndrome, and 
      carbamazepine had little effect on pain after stroke. Clonazepam was effective in
      one study for temporomandibular joint dysfunction. No study compared one
      anticonvulsant with another. CONCLUSIONS: Anticonvulsants were effective for
      trigeminal neuralgia and diabetic neuropathy and for migraine prophylaxis. Minor 
      adverse effects occurred as often as benefit.

TI  - Efficacy of transdermal clonidine in short-term treatment of cluster headache: a 
      pilot study.
PG  - 430-3
AB  - Some clinical as well as pharmacological indications seem to suggest that a
      reduction of the noradrenergic tone occurs in cluster headache (CH), during both 
      the active and remission periods. But sharp fluctuations of the sympathetic
      system may trigger the attacks. Clonidine, an alpha-2-adrenergic presynaptic
      agonist, regulates the sympathetic tone in the central nervous system. Therefore,
      a continuous administration of low-dose clonidine could be potentially beneficial
      in the active phase of CH by antagonizing the variations in noradrenergic tone.
      After a run-in week, we administered transdermal clonidine (5 - 7.5 mg) for one
      week to 13 patients suffering from CH, either episodic (8 cases) or chronic (5
      cases). During clonidine treatment, the mean weekly frequency of attacks dropped 
      from 17.7 +/- 7.0 to 8.7 +/- 6.6 (p = 0.0005), the pain intensity of attacks
      measured on the visual analogue scale from 98.0 +/- 7.2 to 41.1 +/- 36.1 mm (p = 
      0.001), and the duration from 59.3 +/- 21.9 to 34.3 +/- 24.6 min (p = 0.02). This
      open pilot study strongly suggests that transdermal clonidine may be an effective
      drug in the preventive treatment of CH. Its efficacy is possibly due to its
      central sympatho-inhibition, which reduces or prevents the occurrence of
      fluctuations of noradrenaline release that may induce the attacks.

TI  - Paroxysmal dyskinesias: clinical features and classification.
PG  - 571-9
AB  - We studied 46 patients with paroxysmal dyskinesia and classified them according
      to phenomenology, duration of attacks, and etiology. There were 13 patients, 7
      females, who had paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD), 10 with attacks lasting
      5 minutes or less (short lasting) and 3 with attacks lasting longer than 5
      minutes (long lasting). Twenty-six patients, 18 females, had paroxysmal
      nonkinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD), 9 with short-lasting and 17 with long-lasting
      PNKD. Five patients, 3 females, had paroxysmal exertion-induced dyskinesia (PED),
      3 with short-lasting PED and the other 2 with long-lasting PED. In addition,
      there was 1 patient with paroxysmal hypnogenic dyskinesia (PHD) and 1 with
      paroxysmal superior oblique myokymia. Only 2 patients, 1 with PKD and 1 with PHD,
      had family history of paroxysmal dyskinesias. No specific cause could be
      identified in 21 patients; in the other 23 patients the etiologies included the
      following: psychogenic (9 patients), cerebrovascular diseases (4), multiple
      sclerosis (2), encephalitis (2), cerebral trauma (2), peripheral trauma (2),
      migraine (1), and kernicterus (1). Nine of 10 (90%) patients with PKD improved
      with medications, mostly anticonvulsants, compared with only 7 of 19 (37%) with
      PNKD. This new classification, based chiefly on precipitating events, allowed
      appropriate categorization of the attacks in all our patients with paroxysmal
      dyskinesias.

TI  - Gender-associated differences in emergency department pain management.
PG  - 414-21
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine whether patient or provider gender is associated
      with the number, type, and strength of medications received by emergency
      department patients with headache, neck pain, or back pain. DESIGN: Prospective
      cohort study. SETTING: Stanford University Hospital ED PARTICIPANTS: Patients 18 
      years and older who arrived at the ED with a chief complaint of headache, neck
      pain, or back pain between February 1, 1993, and September 30, 1993. Provider
      participants included medical students, interns, residents, nurse practitioners, 
      and attending physicians. RESULTS: ED administration of analgesic versus no
      analgesic, strength of analgesic administered, and administration of multiple
      medications. The study group consisted of 190 patients, 110 of them female. The
      patients were evaluated by 84 providers, 60 of them male. According to the
      providers surveyed, female patients described more pain than did male patients (P
      < .01) and were perceived by providers to experience more pain (P = .03). Female 
      patients received more medications (P < .01) and were less likely to receive no
      medication (P = .01). Female patients also received more potent analgesics (P =
      .03). Linear and logistic regression analysis showed that patient perception of
      pain was the strongest predictor of the number and strength of medications given;
      patient gender was not a predictor. CONCLUSION: Female patients with headache,
      neck pain, or back pain describe more pain and are perceived by providers to have
      more pain than male patients in the ED. Female patients also receive more
      medications and stronger analgesics. In this study, severity of patient pain
      rather than gender stereotyping appeared to correlate most with pain-management
      practices.

TI  - Case report: analgesic nephropathy: a soda and a powder.
PG  - 161-6
AB  - Analgesic nephropathy has long been considered a potentially preventable cause of
      renal disease. Early reports were described in patients who consumed analgesics
      containing phenacetin. In recent data, the removal of phenacetin from analgesic
      preparations resulted in a reduction in analgesic-induced end stage renal disease
      in Europe and Australia. However, a reduction in the incidence of analgesic
      nephropathy has not occurred uniformly, suggesting that phenacetin is not the
      sole cause. Current data raise concerns regarding adverse renal effects of
      acetaminophen and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Aspirin taken alone may be
      of least concern. The diagnosis of analgesic nephropathy is suggested in subjects
      with chronic renal failure, a history of daily consumption of analgesic
      preparations, small bumpy kidneys, and renal papillary necrosis or chronic
      interstitial nephritis. However, the spectrum of disease may be changing, because
      these agents also may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and chronic
      renal disease due to nephrosclerosis, glomerulonephritis, and diabetes mellitus. 
      Potential pathogenetic mechanisms in analgesic nephropathy include direct
      cellular injury induced by analgesics, prostaglandin inhibition with reduction or
      redistribution of renal blood flow, and interesting new concepts regarding the
      role of caffeine in increasing oxygen demand and reducing oxygen supply in the
      medulla. The primary goal of therapy is discontinuation of analgesic consumption.
      Because of the association between analgesic intake and uroepithelial tumors,
      surveillance of patients for neoplasm is suggested.

TI  - NMDA receptor-dependent excitotoxicity: the role of intracellular Ca2+ release.
PG  - 356-9
AB  - Massive activation of glutamate receptors can result in excessive rises in
      cytoplasmic Ca2+ that are thought to underlie the fundamental processes
      ultimately leading to neuronal death. Preventing such cellular Ca2+ rises in the 
      brain may reduce considerably the neuronal damage produced by stroke, head
      trauma, or epilepsy. Activation of NMDA receptors is instrumental in this type of
      neurotoxicity. Recent findings, discussed here by Istvan Mody and John MacDonald,
      indicate that a large proportion of the neurotoxic Ca2+ that enters nerve cells
      following NMDA receptor activation originates from an intracellular Ca2+ pool.
      The release of Ca2+ from this pool is sensitive to the skeletal muscle relaxant
      dantrolene, and this may constitute a novel and alternative therapeutic approach 
      against NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity.

TI  - Adverse reactions associated with nefopam.
PG  - 382-4
AB  - AIM: To review postmarketing experience of adverse reactions associated with
      nefopam. METHODS: Spontaneous reports of adverse reactions associated with
      nefopam over a 12 year period received by the New Zealand Centre for Adverse
      Reactions Monitoring were reviewed. RESULTS: There were 70 reports of adverse
      reactions thought to be causally related to nefopam, most of which appear to be
      predictable extensions of the pharmacological effect of nefopam, and included
      confusion, hallucinations, convulsions, dizziness, headache, sweating, urinary
      retention, nausea, vomiting, tachycardia and palpitations. The first report of
      angina is described. Convulsions occurred in a stable epileptic in whom nefopam
      was contraindicated, and in another where the seizure threshold may have been
      lowered by a concomitant tricyclic antidepressant. CONCLUSIONS: Nefopam can cause
      unpleasant adverse effects and there are important cautions and contraindications
      with this analgesic. A clearer presentation of its basic pharmacology in the
      datasheet should help to ensure appropriate use.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of gabapentin in clinical practice.
PG  - 891-900
AB  - The efficacy and tolerability of gabapentin therapy for seizures in patients in
      clinical practice were retrospectively evaluated. Demographics, seizure type and 
      history, prior anticonvulsant therapy, concomitant anticonvulsant medications,
      gabapentin dosing, side effects, seizure response, and tolerability data were
      obtained from 100 consecutive clinical practice patients (47 men and 53 women)
      treated with gabapentin. All patients had been previously treated with a mean of 
      2.9 anticonvulsant drugs and were currently taking a mean of 1.75 anticonvulsant 
      drugs. Seventy-two patients experienced a greater than 50% reduction in seizures,
      and 23 of these patients experienced a greater than 75% reduction; 57 patients
      continued gabapentin treatment, 5 of whom remain seizure free and side effect
      free with gabapentin monotherapy. Of the 42 patients discontinuing treatment, 17 
      had no seizure reduction, 17 had side effects, and 8 had both. One additional
      patient died. The mean daily dosage for all 100 patients was 2107 mg, and the
      mean daily dosage for patients who continued gabapentin treatment was 2270 mg. No
      linear relationship was found between dosage and patient weight. Fifty-two
      patients had the dosage of at least 1 concomitant anticonvulsant medication
      reduced, 31 had at least 1 concomitant anticonvulsant medication removed from the
      regimen, and 9 required a dosage increase of at least 1 anticonvulsant
      medication. Twenty patients experienced fatigue, which was usually transient
      after treatment initiation; in 13 patients fatigue was associated with
      carbamazepine therapy. In addition, 7 patients experienced ataxia (6 of whom were
      taking concomitant carbamazepine), and 2 experienced weight gain. Patients
      experiencing side effects resulting in discontinuation were taking a mean daily
      dose of gabapentin of 1182 mg. The maximum effective and tolerable daily dosage
      under clinical practice conditions appears to exceed dosages established in
      clinical trials. The results of our study suggest broader treatment parameters
      for gabapentin than initially determined in the more restrictive clinical trials 
      conducted during the drug's development.

PG  - 268-70
AB  - Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a rare myopathy inducing severe accident when
      carriers are exposed to triggering agents. MH susceptibility (MHS) is assessed by
      pharmacological tests performed on muscle strips. Exertional heat stroke (EHS) is
      a severe accident occurring during long and strenuous exercise. It has been
      observed that numerous EHS patients are susceptible to MH according to
      pharmacological tests. Because most of those EHS-MHS subjects were soldiers, we
      hypothesize that military duty could select subjects with infraclinical myopathy 
      and therefore would increase the MHS:EHS subject ratio.

TI  - A phase II study of ondansetron as antiemetic prophylaxis in patients receiving
      high-dose polychemotherapy and stem cell transplantation.
PG  - 301-6
AB  - The field of high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplantation has been
      expanded recently as a treatment for solid tumors and hematological malignancies.
      Severe emesis remains one of the main extramedullary side-effects of high-dose
      regimens during the first week of treatment. Traditional antiemetics such as
      chlorpromazine, diazepam, and phenothiazines are extensively used but are unable 
      to control emesis. The new antiemetic ondansetron, a serotonin receptor (5HT3)
      antagonist appears to be superior to these drugs for cisplatin-induced emesis.
      The study we present here is an attempt to control emesis following high-dose
      regimens, during bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplantation, with
      ondansetron. To our knowledge no other paper has reported the efficacy of this
      antiemetic in such group of patients. A total of 29 patients who received highly 
      emetogenic polychemotherapy as conditioning regimens for bone marrow
      transplantation were treated with ondansetron, which was given as an 8-mg i.v.
      short infusion prior the initiation of treatment and every 6 h thereafter for 3
      days, and an 8-mg dose every 8 h for 5 additional days. All the patients had
      previously been treated with chemotherapy and were evaluable for response and
      toxicity. Complete and major protection of vomiting on day 1 was achieved by 76% 
      of the patients, 58% on day 2 and 52% on day 3. Nausea was absent or mild in 79% 
      of patients on day 1, 45% on day 2 and 41% on day 3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

TI  - Fibromyalgia: more than just a musculoskeletal disease.
PG  - 843-51, 853-4
AB  - Fibromyalgia is a common condition characterized by diffuse musculoskeletal pain 
      and fatigue. The syndrome is defined by the presence of musculoskeletal tender
      points on physical examination. Additionally, persons with this syndrome have a
      high incidence of headaches, ocular and vestibular complaints, paresthesias,
      esophageal dysmotility, "allergic" symptoms, irritable bowl syndrome,
      genitourinary symptoms and affective disorders. Recent research has revealed a
      number of objective biochemical, hormonal and neurotransmitter abnormalities
      associated with fibromyalgia, making it a clearly identifiable condition. These
      abnormalities may clarify our understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of 
      fibromyalgia.

AB  - Multiple pharmacologic agents were used in attempt to relieve a constant and
      severe headache in a 47-year-old patient following craniotomy for removal of an
      acoustic neuroma. Possible etiologies for the unremitting headache are presented.
      Response to various pharmacologic agents are listed and discussed. During the
      postoperative course of two surgeries on this patient, it was possible to propose
      an etiology for the headache by analyzing the mechanisms of each therapeutic
      agent, along with the patient's response. Divalproex sodium provided complete
      relief, suggesting the headache is attributable to cell membrane instability.

TI  - Sleep electroencephalography and the clinical response to amitriptyline in
      patients with fibromyalgia.
PG  - 1211-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and clinical correlations of an anomaly
      consisting of electroencephalographic (EEG) waves within the alpha frequency band
      during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in patients with fibromyalgia, and to 
      evaluate the alpha NREM sleep anomaly as a predictor of response to
      amitriptyline. METHODS: Twenty-two patients with fibromyalgia were studied in a
      2-month, double-blind, crossover trial of amitriptyline (25 mg/day) versus
      placebo. Nocturnal EEGs were conducted on 2 consecutive nights at baseline and at
      the end of each 2-month treatment period. RESULTS: Six patients (27%) had a
      clinical response to amitriptyline, while none responded to placebo (P = 0.02).
      Treatment with amitriptyline or placebo did not result in any changes in the
      alpha ratings during NREM sleep. Only 8 patients (36%) exhibited the alpha NREM
      sleep anomaly at baseline. Those patients reported more sleep difficulty, but
      otherwise were clinically indistinguishable from those without this EEG sleep
      anomaly. Lower baseline alpha NREM sleep ratings were seen in responders to
      amitriptyline than in nonresponders, but these differences did not reach
      statistical significance. CONCLUSION: The alpha NREM sleep anomaly is present in 
      only a small proportion of patients with fibromyalgia. It does not correlate with
      disease severity nor is it affected by treatment with amitriptyline. A larger
      sample size will be needed to adequately assess the value of this sleep anomaly
      in predicting the response to amitriptyline.

TI  - Phosphinic acid analogues of GABA. 1. New potent and selective GABAB agonists.
PG  - 3297-312
AB  - The antispastic agent and muscle relaxant baclofen 1 is a potent and selective
      agonist for bicuculline-insensitive GABAB receptors. For many years efforts to
      obtain superior GABAB agonists were unsuccessful. We describe the syntheses and
      biological properties of two new series of GABAB agonists, the best compounds of 
      which are more potent than baclofen in vitro and in vivo. They were obtained by
      replacing the carboxylic acid group of GABA or baclofen derivatives with either
      the phosphinic acid or the methylphosphinic acid residue. Surprisingly, ethyl-
      and higher alkylphosphinic acid derivatives of GABA yielded novel GABAB
      antagonists, which are described in part 2 of this series. Structure-activity
      relationships of the novel GABAB agonists are discussed with respect to their
      affinities to GABAB receptors as well as to their effects in many functional
      tests in vitro and in vivo providing new muscle relaxant drugs with significantly
      improved side effect profiles.

TI  - Progress in reducing nausea and emesis. Comparisons of ondansetron (Zofran),
      granisetron (Kytril), and tropisetron (Navoban).
PG  - 343-57
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nausea and vomiting are the most distressing side effects associated 
      with the administration of chemotherapy for neoplastic diseases. Nausea, in
      particular, often had been ignored in studies of chemotherapy side effects.
      Recently, progress has been made in the control of chemotherapy-induced nausea
      and vomiting, due, in part, to a better understanding of the physiologic
      mechanisms involved. METHODS: This paper reviews recent advances in the control
      of emesis, focusing on pharmacologic treatments. RESULTS: The efficacy and safety
      of the serotonin (5-HT3) receptor antagonists granisetron, ondansetron, and
      tropisetron in the control of acute and delayed emesis and emesis induced by
      repeat-cycle chemotherapy are summarized. Although differences in study design
      and definitions of response criteria have made it difficult to compare the
      studies that have evaluated these three agents, the overall body of literature
      supports several clinical findings. CONCLUSIONS: (1) The 5HT3 antiemetic agents
      have been shown to be clinically more effective in the control of nausea and
      emesis than previously used agents. (2) No one of the three has demonstrated
      consistently greater efficacy. (3) Efficacy appears to be more pronounced for
      cisplatin-containing regimens than for moderate or less emetogenic chemotherapy
      regimens. (4) Effectiveness of the 5HT3 agents appears to be less for delayed
      nausea and emesis than for acute symptoms. Potential control of anticipatory
      nausea and emesis has not been investigated. (5) Control over nausea appears to
      be significantly less than control over emesis. In the studies in which it has
      been measured, nausea control remains incomplete for approximately half the
      patients given 5HT3 agents. (6) The efficacy of the agents appears to diminish
      across repeated days and, perhaps, across repeated chemotherapy cycles. (7) The
      addition of a steroid such as dexamethasone increases the efficacy of both 5HT3
      and other antiemetic agents. This effect also seems to apply to delayed nausea
      and emesis.

TI  - Chronic use of symptomatic headache medications.
PG  - 179-86
AB  - Chronic use of symptomatic headache medication is believed to be a risk factor
      for drug-induced chronic headache. This study reports the frequency of chronic
      use of symptomatic headache medications implicated in drug-induced chronic
      headache among primary-care headache (PCH) patients and identifies predictors of 
      chronic/frequent use. The design uses a 2-year cohort study of a sample of PCH
      patients in Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound, a large health maintenance
      organization in Seattle, WA. Among 779 PCH patients (aged 18-74 years)
      interviewed at baseline, 662 (85%) completed both 1- and 2-year follow-up
      interviews. This study estimates the percent of PCH patients reporting: (1)
      frequent use of over-the-counter, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, opioid,
      sedative-hypnotic, and ergot medications (defined as 14 or more days of use for
      each class in the prior month), (2) chronic/frequent use of these medications,
      defined as surpassing criteria for frequent use on at least 2 of the 3 study
      interviews, and (3) chronic/frequent polypharmacy, defined as chronic/frequent
      use of 2 or more classes of headache medication. Twenty-one percent of PCH
      patients were chronic/frequent users of symptomatic headache medications, while
      2.6% met study criteria for chronic/frequent polypharmacy. Chronic/frequent use
      of over-the-counter medications (15.9%) was twice as common as chronic/frequent
      use of prescription medications (7.7%). Headache days at baseline was the
      strongest predictor of chronic/frequent medication use. After controlling for
      baseline persistence and severity, older patients were more likely to be
      chronic/frequent users of headache medications. The age effect was explained by
      chronic/frequent use of over-the-counter medications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

TI  - Long-term intrathecal baclofen therapy in patients with intractable spasticity.
PG  - 208-17
AB  - BACKGROUND: Severe spasticity unresponsive to oral drugs may respond
      satisfactorily to baclofen delivered intrathecally. METHODS: Intrathecal baclofen
      (IB) therapy delivered by means of implanted infusion pumps was used for nine
      patients with severe spasticity. Six patients had multiple sclerosis, two
      cervical spinal cord injury, and one head injury. All were non-ambulatory.
      RESULTS: Patients showed improvement in many areas, including ability to
      transfer, seating, pain control, personal care, and liability to skin breakdown. 
      Before IB therapy, only three of the nine patients were able to live at home in
      the community and six were institutionalized. At the end of our follow-up period,
      only one patient remained institutionalized, three lived in group homes and five 
      lived at home in the community. In the year preceding pump implantation, the nine
      patients spent a total of 755 days in acute care hospitals. In the year following
      onset of IB therapy, they spent only 259 days in hospital. CONCLUSIONS: IB
      therapy can improve patient quality of life and can be cost-effective in
      carefully selected patients with severe spasticity and disability. The drug
      delivery catheter is that part of the therapeutic system most vulnerable to
      failure. Because of the varied expertise required to manage these patients
      effectively, and the potential for a variety of complications, it is essential
      that an IB program is supported by a well-organized multi-disciplinary medical
      team.

TI  - Measuring patient-centered outcomes in neurologic disease. Extending the Q-TWiST 
      method.
PG  - 754-62
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current clinical research and outcomes assessment on multiple
      sclerosis rely on an approach to disability measurement that is heavily
      influenced by ambulation. Not only is this strategy often insensitive to the
      clinical changes affected by pharmacotherapeutic or rehabilitative interventions 
      but it also disregards the symptoms that patients seem to consider most
      enervating. We propose a new method for evaluating clinical interventions in
      terms of their impact on the symptoms of multiple sclerosis, side effects,
      parameters of exacerbation, and disease progression, while considering the
      patient's perspective. METHODS: The extended Q-TWiST method yields an estimation 
      of treatment trade-offs in terms of Quality-adjusted Time Without Symptoms and
      Toxicities (Q-TWiST). An illustration of this method is presented by using a
      hypothetical clinical trial of two treatments. The trade-offs between the two
      treatments are highlighted to facilitate treatment decision making by using
      individual patient importance weights. CONCLUSION: We discuss applications to
      other clinical research and other chronic diseases.

TI  - Effect of esmolol given during cardiopulmonary bypass on fractional area of
      contraction from transesophageal echocardiography.
PG  - 219-24
AB  - The infusion of esmolol during hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) has no
      negative myocardial effects after CPB, despite increased esmolol levels during
      CPB due to hypothermia. The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, prospective
      study was to measure the effects of esmolol infused during CPB on cardiac
      function as measured by calculated indices of cardiac work and by transesophageal
      echocardiography (TEE). Patients scheduled for CPB were randomized to receive
      intravenous esmolol (300 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 during CPB after bolus of 2 mg/kg 
      prior to CPB) or placebo. Infusion was stopped at 10 min after release of aortic 
      cross-clamp. Hemodynamics and TEE were recorded during the procedure. Fractional 
      area of contraction (FAC), an approximation of left ventricular ejection
      fraction, was calculated from end-diastolic and end-systolic areas. Esmolol was
      administered to 15 patients and placebo to 14. Heart rates in the esmolol group
      were lower during infusion and prior to CPB (P < 0.05). Stroke volume index and
      left ventricular stroke work index were higher in the esmolol group at 15 min
      post-CPB (P < 0.05). FAC was higher in the esmolol group at 15 and 30 min
      post-CPB (P < 0.05), but no difference was observed between groups at 1 h
      post-CPB. Esmolol infused during CPB in this series of patients was associated
      with better left ventricular function during the first 0.5 h post-CPB.

TI  - Catheter systems for intrathecal drug delivery.
PG  - 215-7
AB  - A prospective study of intrathecal catheter reliability was performed at
      Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center. All 102 patients who had baclofen
      administered chronically for spasticity via an implanted drug pump were included.
      Sixty percent of the patients had no catheter complications; the remaining
      patients had one to five complications over their course of treatment. Survival
      analysis demonstrated a steady rate of malfunction up to 80 months, with the mean
      time to first failure recorded at 20 months. Kinks, holes, breaks, dislodgments, 
      and disconnections were the most common complications. On the basis of their
      research the authors conclude that the thin-walled silastic catheter does not
      perform well and that larger, thick-walled catheters should be used.

TI  - Stiff-man syndrome: case report.
PG  - 735-8
AB  - Stiff-man syndrome is a rare neurologic disorder characterized by progressive,
      fluctuating muscle rigidity with painful muscle contractions affecting
      predominantly the back and proximal extremities. In the ED, the diagnosis can be 
      easily overlooked and misdiagnosed as acute or chronic low back pain and muscle
      spasm. This syndrome is often associated with diabetes, autoimmune diseases, and 
      cancer. This report describes an illustrative case of a 39-year-old woman who
      presented to the ED with a two-year history of right leg spasms and low back pain
      that had become so severe in the preceding two days that she was unable to
      ambulate. Clues to the patient's proper diagnosis coincide with the diagnostic
      criteria for stiff-man syndrome: the presence of a slowly progressive stiffness
      of the axial muscles and proximal limb muscles, making ambulation difficult;
      hyperlordosis of the lumbar spine; episodic spasms precipitated by jarring or
      sudden movement; a normal intellectual, sensory, and motor examination when not
      in spasm; and a marked amelioration of symptoms with the IV administration of
      diazepam. High-dose oral diazepam is the maintenance drug of choice.

TI  - Neurocritical care for acute ischemic stroke.
PG  - 511-27
AB  - Therapy for acute ischemic stroke includes general and specific measures. General
      management such as respiratory and cardiac care, fluid and electrolyte
      management, blood pressure control, and treatment of increased ICP is the basis
      of all stroke treatment. Specific treatment is directed to recanalization of the 
      occluded vessel, control of life-threatening brain edema, and protection of
      neuronal tissue against the toxic effects of ischemia. Although controlled
      studies are still lacking, application of the proposed general interventions
      provides a high-quality standard in patients with acute stroke. Among specific
      therapies, medical thrombolysis has demonstrated instances of significant and
      sustained neurologic improvement. Several multicenter trials are underway to
      confirm these preliminary results. In addition to thrombolysis, cell-protecting
      drugs hold promise for the future. Presumably, a combination of thrombolytic and 
      cell-protecting agents will be the treatment of choice in early stroke in the
      future.

TI  - Trigeminal neuralgia in multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 1294-6
AB  - Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) occurred in 35 patients (1.9%) from a large multiple
      sclerosis (MS) clinic population (N = 1,882). TN began on average 11.8 years
      after the first MS symptom but in five patients was the first symptom of MS,
      preceding the next MS symptom by 1 to 11 years. The onset of MS was later in the 
      patients who had TN, and bilateral TN occurred more frequently than expected (in 
      14% of TN patients). The age at onset of TN was no younger than in idiopathic TN 
      except when TN was the first MS symptom. Most patients had a good result from
      medical or surgical therapy.

TI  - Human antiprotozoal therapy: past, present, and future.
PG  - 427-39
AB  - Human protozoal infections are ubiquitous and occur worldwide. In many cases,
      antiprotozoal agents currently in use predate the modern antibiotic era. Despite 
      the relative lag in development of new antiprotozoal agents, the 1990s have
      witnessed an increasing level of interest in these infections, inspired by
      international travel and immigration, a growing awareness of antiprotozoal drug
      resistance, and the significance of acute and recrudescent protozoal infections
      in immunosuppressed hosts. This review summarizes for nonclinician readers the
      past, present, and future therapies for common human protozoal infections, as
      well as pharmacologic mechanisms of action and resistance and common toxicities
      associated with these agents.

TI  - Diazepam and body weight in myelopathy patients.
PG  - 200-2
AB  - Because diazepam appeared to affect body weight, spastic myelopathy patients for 
      whom this drug had been prescribed but in whom the dose was altered were compared
      with similar patients, without changes in antispastic medication. A retrospective
      survey averaging 10 months was conducted for these two groups to determine weight
      changes of 10 pounds or more. After reduction or discontinuation of diazepam in
      seven patients, all lost weight -12 to 35 lbs at rates of 0.9 to 3.5 lb per
      month. On unchanged medication, only one of twelve patients lost as much as 10
      lb, p < 0.001. After partially or fully restoring diazepam in four patients, all 
      gained weight -7 to 26 lbs-at rates of 1.8 to 4.3 lbs per month. Three of the
      four patients and two of the 12 without medication change gained as much as 10
      pounds, p = 0.03. We conclude that body weight in myelopathy patients is affected
      by the use of diazepam. The effect of other medications used for spasms was not
      assessed.

TI  - Excitatory amino acid receptors and neurodegeneration.
PG  - 319-37
AB  - This review describes recent advances in our understanding of the pharmacology of
      excitatory amino acid receptors, and the application of this knowledge to the
      unravelling of the aetiology of neurodegenerative diseases, and to their therapy.
      Ionotropic excitatory amino acid receptors can be divided into two large
      families, the NMDA receptor family, and the AMPA/kainate receptor family.
      Receptor cloning studies have shown there to be a large number of potential
      subtypes of receptors in both these families. Antagonists have been developed for
      the NMDA receptor which can interact with at least four independent drug
      recognition sites on the receptor. For the AMPA/kainate receptor, two classes of 
      antagonist have so far been identified. Reasonably potent, selective and
      brain-penetrating antagonists now exist for virtually all these sites, and
      compounds inhibiting the release of glutamic acid presynaptically have also been 
      identified, such as riluzole. The ability of glutamic acid to kill neurons
      (excitotoxicity) seems to be mediated, in most cases, by an interaction with NMDA
      receptors, leading to an uncontrollable rise in intracellular calcium
      concentrations and thence cell lysis and death. The setting-up of glutamatergic
      loops seems to be a key process in the maintenance, spread and amplification of
      neurodegenerative foci. The existence of such processes has been amply
      demonstrated in animal models of stroke, in which both NMDA and AMPA/kainate
      receptor antagonists have neuroprotective effects. Clinical trials are underway
      with NMDA receptor antagonists in stroke. Excitotoxic mechanisms probably also
      contribute to pathology in head trauma and viral encephalopathy. Ingestion of
      excitatory amino acids may play a role in neurological conditions of dietary
      aetiology, such as neurolathyrism and domoic acid intoxication. For chronic
      neurodegenerative diseases, the role of excitatory amino acids is much less
      clear, although there is some evidence for the existence of excitotoxic
      mechanisms in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Evidence from animal models suggests
      that drugs that block glutamatergic neurotransmission might be beneficial in
      Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, but
      the relevance of these animal models to the human pathology is not clear.
      However, preliminary clinical results suggest riluzole to be efficacious in
      prolonging survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and certain weak NMDA
      receptor antagonists are currently used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
      The next few years could witness a breakthrough in the treatment of neurological 
      conditions as drugs that interfere with glutamatergic transmission become
      available for clinical use.

TI  - The effects of flumazenil in neuropsychiatric disorders.
PG  - 215-32
AB  - Flumazenil is a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. It is currently used mainly
      in the anaesthetic and emergency rooms to reverse the effect of exogenous
      benzodiazepines. Its use in a variety of experimental animal models and in human 
      neuropsychiatric disorders continues to generate a wealth of information on the
      possible role of the benzodiazepine-GABA(A) receptor complex in their
      pathogenesis. In addition, labelled with carbon-11, flumazenil has proved to be
      one of the most successful positron emission tomography ligands stimulating
      research on the role of the benzodiazepine receptor in these disorders. This
      review focuses on the current state of play of flumazenil as a therapeutic or
      investigative agent in neuropsychiatry, citing also the relevant animal models.

TI  - A risk-benefit assessment of cisapride in the treatment of gastrointestinal
      disorders.
PG  - 384-92
AB  - Cisapride is a substituted benzamide compound that stimulates motor activity in
      all segments of the gastrointestinal tract by enhancing the release of
      acetylcholine from the enteric nervous system. Cisapride is administered orally
      in the treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, functional dyspepsia,
      gastroparesis, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction syndromes and chronic
      constipation. In gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in both adults and children,
      cisapride provides symptomatic improvement and mucosal healing. Long term
      treatment with cisapride is effective in the prevention of relapse of
      oesophagitis. Cisapride improves gastric emptying rates and improves symptoms in 
      patients with gastroparesis of various origins. Unlike domperidone and
      metoclopramide, long term administration of cisapride seems to result in
      persistently enhanced gastric emptying. Cisapride is also effective in improving 
      symptoms in patients with functional dyspepsia. In comparative studies in
      patients with functional dyspepsia, cisapride was at least as effective as
      metoclopramide, domperidone, clebopride, ranitidine and cimetidine. Cisapride
      increases stool frequency and reduces laxative consumption in patients with
      idiopathic constipation. Severe cases of slow transit constipation seem
      refractory to cisapride. Clinical studies also indicate that cisapride might be
      effective in the treatment of chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction,
      postoperative ileus, peptic ulcer and irritable bowel syndrome. Further clinical 
      studies are warranted to define the role of cisapride in these conditions. The
      dosage of cisapride ranges from 5mg 3 times daily to 20mg twice daily. Cisapride 
      is generally well tolerated, both during short and long term treatment. In
      children, cisapride is also well tolerated in doses of 0.2 to 0.3 mg/kg, 3 to 4
      times daily.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - CNS adverse events associated with antimalarial agents. Fact or fiction?
PG  - 370-83
AB  - CNS adverse drug events are dramatic, and case reports have influenced clinical
      opinion on the use of antimalarials. Malaria also causes CNS symptoms, thus
      establishing causality is difficult. CNS events are associated with the quinoline
      and artemisinin derivatives. Chloroquine, once considered too toxic for humans,
      has been the antimalarial of choice for 40 years. While a range of serious CNS
      effects have been documented during chloroquine therapy, the incidence is unclear
      (extrapyramidal symptoms occur with an incidence of 1 in 5000). Amodiaquine has a
      higher incidence of mild CNS effects than chloroquine. Mefloquine therapy causes 
      dose-related transient dizziness. Serious CNS events during mefloquine therapy
      occur in 1:1200 Asians and 1:200 Caucasians/Africans. Risk factors include
      dosage, concomitant drug use/interactions, previous history of a CNS event and
      disease severity. Retreatment (within a month) increases the risk in Asians
      7-fold. Studies indicate that the frequency of serious CNS events with mefloquine
      prophylaxis (1:10,000) is similar to that with chloroquine (1:13,600). Quinine
      causes cinchonism at standard therapeutic doses. High-tone hearing loss occurs,
      but irreversible auditory or ocular effects are very rare. The artemisinin
      derivatives are associated with dose-dependent brain lesions in rodent, canine
      and nonhuman primates. At low doses, histological injury has been demonstrated,
      without clinical neurological signs. No significant toxicity has been reported in
      humans. Other antimalarial drugs are seldom associated with CNS adverse events.
      Data do not suggest a need to diminish the correct use of the quinoline
      derivatives. Irreversible effects are extremely rare and usually associated with 
      overdosing or prior history of a serious CNS event. Concomitant therapeutic use
      of 2 drugs from the same family, or retreatment with the same drug, should be
      avoided. Onset of drug-associated serious CNS events requires drug
      discontinuation and future avoidance of the drug.

TI  - Disposition of gabapentin in anuric subjects on hemodialysis.
PG  - 622-6
AB  - Gabapentin is an anticonvulsant drug, which in man is cleared solely by renal
      excretion and is not bound to plasma proteins. Because the clearance of
      gabapentin is dependent on renal function, the pharmacokinetics of gabapentin
      were investigated in anuric subjects maintained on hemodialysis. Plasma samples
      were obtained over an 8-day period after administration of single oral 400-mg
      doses of gabapentin. Pre- and post-dialyzer plasma samples and dialysate samples 
      from quantitative collection of dialyzer effluent were obtained during
      hemodialysis sessions performed 2, 4, and 7 days after dosing. A mean (SD)
      maximum gabapentin plasma concentration of 6.0 (2.4) micrograms/mL was achieved
      at 4.7 (2.1) hours post-dose. The elimination half-life of gabapentin on
      non-hemodialysis days averaged 132 hours. Approximately 35% of the gabapentin
      dose was recovered in dialysate, and mean hemodialysis clearance of gabapentin
      was 142 (26) mL/min; approximately 93% of the dialyzer creatinine clearance.
      Gabapentin elimination half-life during hemodialysis was approximately 4 hours.
      Systemic plasma gabapentin concentrations increased approximately 30% during the 
      first 2 hours after hemodialysis as a result of drug redistribution in the body. 
      It is recommended that patients with end-stage renal disease maintained on
      hemodialysis receive an initial 300-mg to 400-mg gabapentin loading dose. Plasma 
      gabapentin concentrations can be maintained by giving 200 to 300 mg of gabapentin
      after every 4 hours of hemodialysis.

TI  - Clinical pharmacokinetics of lansoprazole.
PG  - 458-70
AB  - Lansoprazole, a benzimidazole derivative with antisecretory and antiulcer
      activities, inhibits the acid pump activity at the final stage of the enzyme
      process and therefore reduces the acid secretion of parietal cells. Lansoprazole 
      is converted to active metabolites in the acid environment of these cells. It is 
      rapidly absorbed from a gastric acid-resistant formulation and is approximately
      97% bound in human plasma. Single dose pharmacokinetics of lansoprazole appear to
      be linear over the range from 15 to 60mg. Food and time of dose influence
      absorption after single doses, but do not modify the antisecretory effect of
      multiple doses. Lansoprazole is extensively metabolised following oral
      administration into sulphone and 5-hydroxylated metabolites by the cytochrome
      P450 enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2C18. Two other metabolites have been identified in
      plasma: sulphide and hydroxylated sulphone. Mean plasma elimination half-life
      (t1/2) is between 1.3 and 2.1 hours in healthy volunteers. 15 to 23% of the total
      dose is found in urine as free and conjugated hydroxylated metabolites, while
      unchanged lansoprazole is not detected. The pharmacokinetic profile of the drug
      is not modified by multiple administration. In healthy elderly volunteers, area
      under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and t1/2 are significantly
      greater after single administration occurs to the same extent as in young
      volunteers. Renal failure has no influence on the pharmacokinetics of
      lansoprazole, but severe hepatic failure causes a significant decrease in
      clearance and an increase in the AUC and t1/2 of lansoprazole. This is
      accompanied by modifications in the AUC of metabolites, but severe hepatic
      failure has minimal effect on accumulation of the drug after multiple
      administration. The pharmacokinetics of lansoprazole in patients with
      acid-related disorders do not differ from those in healthy volunteers. Studies of
      interactions of lansoprazole with warfarin, prednisone, theophylline, phenazone
      (antipyrine), diazepam, phenytoin and oral contraceptives suggest minimal risk of
      any clinically significant interaction.

TI  - The treatment of multiple sclerosis: current and future.
PG  - 200-9
AB  - During the past year observations have been published that might lead to further 
      improvement in the design of future clinical trials. At the same time, results of
      clinical trials have become available that suggest that a number of treatments
      could be of benefit in the care of patients in the various phases of multiple
      sclerosis. Future multiple sclerosis clinical trials should involve a blinded
      investigator restricted to assessing the clinical outcome variables, and because 
      current evidence suggests that magnetic resonance imaging gives an objective and 
      sensitive reflection of the biological evolution of the disease, such scanning
      should also be included. The use of a composite outcome variable in a trial of
      chronic progressive multiple sclerosis should also be considered in order to
      increase the percentage of patients reaching the clinical endpoint. In 1994
      recommendations were published for the selection of relapsing-remitting patients 
      for treatment with interferon beta-1b; furthermore, large and well performed
      clinical trials demonstrated that interferon beta-1a and copolymer-1 are also
      partially effective, though not curative, for these patients. Two smaller studies
      suggested that low-dose methotrexate and cladribine might have a beneficial
      effect on the course of the disease in patients with secondary chronic
      progressive multiple sclerosis, the former drug probably being less toxic.
      Unfortunately, therapeutic perspectives for patients with primary progressive
      multiple sclerosis are less promising at present. Several studies suggest that
      4-aminopyridine and tizanidine have therapeutic potential for symptomatic
      treatment; the former by improving neurological deficits, the latter by relieving
      troublesome spasticity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Felbamate relieved trigeminal neuralgia.
PG  - 139-42
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The analgesic efficacy of the novel anticonvulsant felbamate was
      evaluated in trigeminal neuralgia. PATIENTS AND SETTING: This trial was offered
      in a tertiary referral center to three outpatients with severe pain who had
      exhausted other medical options, yet did not wish to undergo surgery.
      INTERVENTIONS: Felbamate was prescribed as the sole analgesic for approximately 1
      month. OUTCOME MEASURES: A visual analogue scale was utilized. RESULTS: Felbamate
      potently diminished the severe pain of trigeminal neuralgia and was well
      tolerated. The drug was withdrawn because of subsequent reports elsewhere of
      aplastic anemia and hepatic failure associated with it when used for epilepsy.
      CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary evidence suggested that felbamate was effective in
      relieving trigeminal neuralgia. Stabilization of neuronal membrane depolarization
      was the most likely mechanism of action. However, significant potential risks
      preclude further use of felbamate in the management of nonmalignant pain.
      Principles that have proven useful in screening for new anticonvulsant drugs
      might be relevant to the development of methods by which to search for new
      analgesic drugs.

PG  - 134-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This trial aimed to study moclobemide, a reversible, Type-A selective 
      monoamine oxidase inhibitor, in patients with chronic neuropathic pain. DESIGN:
      Pain clinic patients suitable for antidepressant therapy were treated for 2
      months in an open label, uncontrolled trial with moclobemide 150-600 mg/day.
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual analog scores of pain and affective symptoms, a
      side-effect checklist, and clinical global impressions of efficacy and
      tolerability. RESULTS: The trial was terminated after assessment of seven
      patients; partial analgesic activity was discernible only in one, and beneficial 
      mood effects notable in two others. Significant adverse effects, particularly
      insomnia and GI disturbance, were reported by the majority of patients.
      CONCLUSION: Moclobemide appears to have limited efficacy in the treatment of
      neuropathic pain.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial of citalopram in the treatment of fibromyalgia.
PG  - 445-9
AB  - Amitriptyline and cyclobenzaprine have shown some efficacy in treatment of the
      generalised pain syndrome, fibromyalgia. The aim of this study was to examine the
      efficacy of antidepressant dosages of the serotonin re-uptake inhibitor
      citalopram in fibromyalgia. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study 22
      patients with fibromyalgia were randomized to treatment with citalopram for 4
      weeks at a dosage of 20 mg a day while 21 received placebo. After 4 weeks the
      dosage was increased to 40 mg for a further 4 weeks if the subjects did not
      report a marked improvement. After the end of treatment (8 weeks) no changes were
      observed in self-assessment of symptoms, physician's global assessment, tender
      points, Beck depression score or voluntary muscle strength and no differences
      were observed between the groups. Citalopram showed no demonstrable effect on
      this group of pain patients. The strength of the study was sufficient to exclude 
      an effect of citalopram of more than 1 steps of 10 on the categoric scales for
      pain, fatigue and general condition (95% confidence limit), which indicates that 
      the sample size was sufficiently large.

TI  - Common drugs may influence motor recovery after stroke. The Sygen In Acute Stroke
      Study Investigators.
PG  - 865-71
AB  - Studies in laboratory animals indicate that certain centrally acting drugs (eg,
      the antihypertensives clonidine and prazosin, neuroleptics and other dopamine
      receptor antagonists, benzodiazepines, and the anticonvulsants phenytoin and
      phenobarbital) impair behavioral recovery after focal brain injury. Even single
      doses may have long-term harmful effects. To determine whether these medications 
      have a similar negative impact in humans, we analyzed the recoveries of control
      patients who were enrolled in the Sygen in Acute Stroke Study, a multicenter
      study of the effects of GM1 ganglioside after ischemic stroke. Motor impairments 
      were measured by the motor subscores of the Toronto Stroke Scale at baseline and 
      7, 14, 21, 28, 56, and 84 days after stroke. Using these data, we compared motor 
      recovery between patients with initial motor deficits who received at least one
      of the drugs that interfere with recovery in laboratory studies ("detrimental"
      drug group, n = 37) and patients who did not receive these drugs ("neutral" drug 
      group, n = 59). The groups were well balanced with regard to the frequency of
      comorbid conditions and other prognostic factors. For upper-extremity motor
      function, repeated-measures ANOVA showed a significant interaction between drug
      group and time after stroke [F(6,528) = 2.38; p = 0.03], with a significant (p < 
      0.001) difference between the groups beginning 7 days after the stroke. A similar
      trend was present for the lower extremity, but the overall difference between the
      groups was not significant [ANOVA F(6,498) = 1.22; p = 0.29]. Drug group did
      influence the degree of independence in activities of daily living as measured
      with the Barthel Index.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - The effects of intrathecally administered baclofen on function in patients with
      spasticity.
PG  - 352-62
AB  - The purpose of this article is to review the literature on the effects of
      intrathecally administered baclofen on impairment in spasticity and muscle
      activation patterns, on functional limitations in mobility and self-care, and on 
      disability in daily life roles. We found plentiful evidence of improvement in
      spasticity, spasms, and bladder function and some reports of improved patterns of
      muscle activation and kinematics of single-joint movement. Improved ability to
      accomplish transfers, self-care, and locomotion is less consistently studied but 
      has also been reported in about 60% to 70% of patients. Evidence of improved
      quality of life is primarily anecdotal but may be found in 10% to 30% of
      patients. We conclude that research protocols should be developed to clarify
      effects on control of voluntary movement, functional limitations, and quality of 
      life.

TI  - Analgesic and hemodynamic effects of epidural clonidine, clonidine/morphine, and 
      morphine after pancreatic surgery--a double-blind study.
PG  - 869-74
AB  - This study characterizes analgesia an hemodynamics after epidural clonidine 8
      micrograms/kg (Group C) or clonidine 4 micrograms/kg+morphine 2 mg (Group CM) in 
      comparison to epidural morphine 50 micrograms/kg (Group M). Forty-five patients
      scheduled for pancreatectomy in combined general/epidural anesthesia were
      studied. The study drugs were administered 75 min postoperatively and for 10 h
      pain intensity (visual analog scale [VAS]), heart rate (HR), mean arterial
      pressure (MAP), and cardiac output (CO) were measured; filling pressures were
      kept > 5 mm Hg. Adequate analgesia could be achieved within 1 h in all patients
      of Groups C and CM, but only in six patients of Group M (P < 0.001). Quality of
      analgesia was comparable in all groups (VAS reduction 82% +/- 20%, mean +/- SD)
      but duration of analgesic action was longer in Groups CM (586 +/- 217 min) and M 
      (775 +/- 378 min) compared to Group C (336 +/- 119 min) (P < 0.001). In Group M, 
      no hemodynamic alterations occurred. In Groups C and CM, HR, CO, and MAP were
      reduced significantly compared to baseline within the first 15-90 min, while
      stroke volume and systemic vascular resistance remained stable. We conclude, that
      hemodynamic alteration after epidural clonidine under conditions of stable
      filling pressures is caused mainly by a decrease in HR. It is not an effect of
      analgesia but of the intrinsic antihypertensive action of clonidine.

TI  - Antagonism of the effects of clonidine by the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist,
      fluparoxan.
PG  - 477-83
AB  - 1. The effects of fluparoxan, an alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, on the
      pharmacodynamic changes induced by clonidine were investigated in this
      placebo-controlled, double-blind, two-period, cross-over study in 16 healthy male
      volunteers (aged 19 to 44 years). 2. Subjects received either fluparoxan or
      placebo, twice-daily for 5 1/2 days (11 doses). One hour after the first and last
      dose of each treatment period, clonidine (200 micrograms) was infused
      intravenously over 5 min. 3. Indices of clonidine-mediated pharmacodynamic
      responses (growth hormone secretion, bradycardia, hypotension, xerostomia and
      sedation) were taken before and after clonidine infusion. Growth hormone
      secretion was assessed by quantifying serum growth hormone concentrations;
      sedation was assessed by both visual analogue scales (VAS) and by a visual
      psychomotor response meter, measuring critical flicker fusion (CFF). 4. The
      majority of subjects reported minor adverse events such as lethargy, headache and
      dry mouth following clonidine infusion. All adverse events were likely to be
      related to clonidine, as they occurred consistently between treatment groups.
      Fluparoxan has, however, in previous studies been reported to cause headache and 
      light-headedness. 5. Prior to the clonidine infusion, fluparoxan caused small but
      statistically significant increases in systolic blood pressure (4 mm Hg) and
      salivary flow (approximately 30%) after both single and repeated doses. A small
      increase in heart rate (2 beats min-1) was seen after a single dose which was
      also statistically significant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Rapid infusion of amphotericin B in dextrose.
PG  - 523-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the data examining the use of rapid infusion of amphotericin
      B in dextrose infusions. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search of the English-language
      literature and review of pertinent references' bibliographies was used to
      identify articles evaluating the effect of amphotericin B infusion rates on the
      incidence of adverse reactions. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Controlled
      and uncontrolled studies involving humans are reviewed; emphasis is placed on
      recent comparative trials. Pertinent information, as judged by the authors, was
      selected for discussion. DATA SYNTHESIS: Amphotericin B, a polyene antifungal
      agent with significant toxicity, remains the agent of choice for many serious
      fungal infections. The potential benefits of rapid administration of amphotericin
      B in reducing the incidence and/or severity of adverse reactions were noted soon 
      after its introduction. Recent studies have examined the tolerability of rapid
      (0.75-1 h) amphotericin B infusions. Results of studies assessing the
      tolerability of rapid amphotericin B infusions suggest that tolerance to
      infusion-related reactions develops during therapy. Comparative trials have
      obtained variable results. The comparative trials supporting rapid amphotericin B
      infusion have generally used crossover designs, enrolled small numbers of
      patients, and excluded patients with significant renal or cardiovascular
      dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid amphotericin B infusions should be avoided during
      initiation of therapy when infusion-related reactions tend to be most
      problematic, and in patients with cardiovascular disease, renal dysfunction, and 
      potassium disorders because of the potential risk for cardiac arrhythmias. The
      literature currently available is conflicting and insufficient to support the
      routine use of rapid amphotericin B infusion.

TI  - Propantheline bromide in the management of hyperhidrosis associated with spinal
      cord injury.
PG  - 489-92
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report 2 cases in which oral propantheline reduced the discomfort
      associated with sweating related to spinal cord injury (SCI), and to review the
      literature on the management of SCI-related sweating. CASE SUMMARIES: Case 1: A
      27-year-old quadriplegic man with an American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA)
      Frankel class C injury to C5/C6 experienced profuse sweating and requested
      propantheline. He stated that he had received the medication previously and
      reported that propantheline 15 mg tid had controlled his sweating. Propantheline 
      bromide was reinstituted, and within 24 hours, the patient's episodes of profuse 
      sweating had decreased markedly in number and frequency. Case 2: A 35-year-old
      quadriplegic woman had an ASIA class D lesion at C3. Since her injury, she had
      experienced profuse sweating that worsened when she became cold and at night. She
      stated that her sweating was under control as long as she took propantheline.
      Propantheline therapy was continued and no further sweating episodes have
      occurred. DATA SOURCE: A MEDLINE search was used to identify pertinent literature
      including reviews. Standard texts and texts referenced in the pertinent
      literature also were examined. STUDY SELECTION: All available sources of
      information were reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS: The earliest case reports of systemic 
      therapy for hyperhidrosis described the use of the anticholinergic methantheline 
      bromide. Methantheline in combination with ergoloid mesylates also was suggested 
      for the treatment of congenital hyperhidrosis. Local topical therapy for
      hyperhidrosis, such as aluminum chlorohydrate and aluminum chloride, the active
      ingredients in some antiperspirants, have been tried with some success. Talc,
      starch, and other powders have been suggested to absorb excessive sweat. Formalin
      and glutaraldehyde also have been used. Topical propantheline bromide has been
      used successfully in treating palmar and plantar hidrosis. Clonazepam has been
      used successfully in a case of unilateral localized hyperhidrosis. Systemic
      phenoxybenzamine has been used with some success and there have been attempt at
      other systemic therapy using mecamylamine, atropine, propoxyphenel, and
      methenamine. Scopolamine patches also have been used successfully in a small
      number of patients. Other agents that have been used include dibenamine,
      piperoxan, and phentolamine. Systemic propantheline also has been listed as an
      agent with potential efficacy in treating the profuse sweating associated with
      SCI, but was not recommended primarily because of adverse effects and difficulty 
      in titrating to the lowest effective dosage. However, studies or case reports
      specific to the use of propantheline in patients with SCI appear to be lacking,
      as are reports of direct comparison between propantheline and other agents.
      DISCUSSION: Concerning the mechanism of action of propantheline bromide for
      hyperhidrosis, it seems reasonable to attribute its effects to the drug's
      well-documented anticholinergic/antimuscarinic actions. At dosages used to
      effectively treat neurogenic bladder, propantheline bromide also should block the
      muscarinic receptors responsible for sweat gland stimulation. Central nervous
      system adverse effects should be minimal at usual clinical dosages, as
      propantheline does not cross the blood-brain barrier. CONCLUSIONS: It would
      appear that in some patients with SCI who are subject to incidental episodes of
      profuse sweating, oral propantheline may offer some relief and may, in fact, be
      well tolerated, as in the cases described. Additionally, propantheline would seem
      a good therapeutic choice in SCI patients with excessive sweating and neurogenic 
      bladder dysfunction who may derive dual benefit from the agent.

TI  - "Off" painful dystonia in Parkinson's disease treated with botulinum toxin.
PG  - 333-6
AB  - The "off" painful dystonia (OPD), usually concerning the feet, is a type of
      abnormal involuntary movement, induced by the chronic use of levodopa. It is
      mostly observed in the advanced stage of Parkinson's disease (PD), particularly
      in the early morning, in the evening, and late at night. Indeed, some patients
      have experienced OPD also during "on" periods when dystonic posture of the foot
      alternates with dyskinesia. The pain probably is due to sustained muscle
      contraction, which causes prolonged muscle spasm, as in primary dystonia or
      torticollis. Dopaminergic drugs like bromocriptine, pergolide, and especially
      apomorphine (s.c. infusions, or bolus), can dramatically improve the OPD.
      Anticholinergics baclofen and lithium are alos used in the management of OPD with
      some benefit. On the other hand, clinical experience shows that in many cases,
      these therapeutic procedures are not always enough to produce the expected
      results. Thirty PD patients (22 men and eight women) with OPD of the foot were
      treated with botulinum toxin (Botox, Btx) using electromyograms to guide
      injections. Dystonia was evaluated using a quantitative rating scale. The
      selection of the muscles for Btx treatment was carried out on the basis of foot
      posture. We injected Btx into tibialis posterior, tibialis anterior,
      gastrocnemius, flexor digitorum longus, and extensores hallucis longus with a
      median dose 40 IU for each muscle, distributed in two sites. In all patients, the
      pain improved within 10 days, whereas in 21 patients, the pain disappeared
      completely for 4 months (range, 3-7 months); a concomitant improvement in
      intensity of the dystonic spasm was also observed. No side effects were reported.
      Seven patients with associated "on" foot dystonia described an improvement of
      foot posture on walking. In conclusion, in this uncontrolled study, the use of
      Btx in OPD seemed a promising tool to improve pain linked to foot dystonia;
      however, because of the well-known underlying dopaminergic defect in OPD, the Btx
      therapy should be considered only if the dopaminergic treatment established for
      the management of OPD has failed.

TI  - A comparison of intrathecally administered narcotic and nonnarcotic analgesics
      for experimental chronic neuropathic pain.
PG  - 595-9
AB  - The antinociceptive actions of morphine and tizanidine (an alpha 2-adrenergic
      agonist) administered intrathecally in a rat model of mononeuropathic pain were
      investigated. Tizanidine increased to normal levels the intensity of a noxious
      pressure stimulus required to induce paw withdrawal (p < 0.01) and decreased the 
      duration of limb withdrawal from both normal-temperature and cooled floors in a
      dose-dependent manner (p < 0.01). Tizanidine had virtually no effect on the
      latency of paw withdrawal from a noxious heat stimulus. In comparison, morphine
      significantly decreased, in a dose-dependent manner, limb withdrawal from the
      normal-temperature and cooled floors and increased to cutoff values the
      withdrawal latencies of both noxious heat and pressure stimuli (p < 0.01). The
      effect of tizanidine was limited to the hyperalgesic limb and served to normalize
      reactive latencies, whereas morphine affected both hindlimbs and increased
      latencies to supranormal cutoff values. These data suggest that intrathecal
      tizanidine may be more specific than morphine in reversing the allodynia and
      hyperpathia associated with neuropathic pain states and may be of value in the
      management of patients with these clinical syndromes.

TI  - Pretreatment regimens for adverse events related to infusion of amphotericin B.
PG  - 755-61
AB  - Infusion-related adverse events (IRAEs) such as nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, 
      and thrombophlebitis that are associated with amphotericin B therapy often lead
      clinicians to prescribe a number of adjunctive pretreatment medications in an
      attempt to reduce the incidence and severity of these events. The purpose of this
      study was to determine the incidence of IRAEs during the first week of systemic
      amphotericin B therapy and to identify pretreatment regimens that are effective
      in preventing these IRAEs. Three hundred ninety-seven adult inpatients receiving 
      amphotericin B therapy were prospectively monitored, and data regarding IRAEs and
      pretreatment regimens were collected. Of these patients, 282 (71%) developed at
      least one IRAE during the first 7 days of therapy. The IRAEs most commonly
      reported were fever (51% of patients) and chills (28%), followed by nausea (18%),
      headache (9%), and thrombophlebitis (5%). The most common regimens included
      diphenhydramine, a corticosteroid, acetaminophen, and heparin, administered alone
      or in combination with these or other drugs. Overall, common pretreatment
      regimens were similar in efficacy to no pretreatment in the prevention of IRAEs. 
      Thus empirical premedication for IRAEs associated with amphotericin B cannot be
      routinely advocated; instead, patients should be treated when symptoms first
      arise and then premedicated for subsequent amphotericin B infusions.

TI  - Hypertension in pregnancy. Practical management recommendations.
PG  - 555-62
AB  - Hypertension is a common and potentially serious complication of human pregnancy.
      It can be a marker of underlying maternal disease processes aggravated by
      pregnancy, or it can be directly related to the pregnancy (pre-eclampsia). It is 
      associated with increased risks of fetal growth retardation and, if severe, can
      cause both maternal and fetal problems. The risks to both mother and neonate can 
      be reduced by appropriate supervision and therapy. Close monitoring of maternal
      and fetal welfare will help to determine the optimum time for delivery. Maternal 
      hypertension should be controlled with agents considered to be well tolerated in 
      pregnancy. Following the index pregnancy, all patients with early and/or severe
      hypertension should be investigated for an underlying cause. Provided that there 
      is clinical resolution of acute pregnancy-related hypertension, investigations
      are usually postponed until at least 3 months following delivery.

TI  - Botulinum toxin treatment of essential head tremor.
PG  - 822-4
AB  - We examined in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study the effects of botulinum 
      toxin in 10 patients with essential head tremor. Each subject received two
      treatments approximately 3 months apart, one with botulinum toxin injections and 
      another with normal saline injections into the sternocleidomastoid and splenius
      capitis muscles. The subjects were assessed before each treatment and at 2, 4,
      and 8 weeks after injections. There was moderate to marked improvement in
      clinical ratings in five subjects after botulinum toxin injections and in one
      subject after placebo. There was moderate to marked subjective improvement in
      five patients with botulinum toxin as compared with three subjects with placebo. 
      Side effects were mild and transient. We conclude that botulinum toxin may be
      useful for patients with essential head tremor who have failed to benefit from
      oral medications.

TI  - Identifying multiple sclerosis patients with mild or global cognitive impairment 
      using the Screening Examination for Cognitive Impairment (SEFCI).
PG  - 718-23
AB  - Cognitive impairment affects 40 to 70% of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), 
      but its occurrence cannot be predicted from knowledge of the individual patient's
      age, level of physical disability, duration of disease, disease type, or
      performance on standard mental status examinations. To evaluate the usefulness of
      a brief screening battery, the Screening Examination for Cognitive Impairment
      (SEFCI), 103 community-dwelling MS patients and 32 healthy normal controls
      received the SEFCI and a 2-hour battery of other neuropsychological tests chosen 
      for their sensitivity to the cognitive impairments most often observed in MS.
      Performance on the SEFCI correctly identified 86% of the patients with impairment
      on any of the 11 measures from the longer battery, 100% of the patients with
      impairments in at least three cognitive domains, and 90% of the patients without 
      cognitive impairment. Because the SEFCI is sensitive, specific, and easily
      administered and scored, it should aid the physician in deciding whether to refer
      an MS patient for a complete evaluation.

AB  - This article explores the evidence for a common vascular pathophysiology for
      idiopathic Meniere's disease and migraine. After retrospectively reviewing 85
      cases of Meniere's disease, it is concluded that (1) migraine occurs more often
      in patients with Meniere's disease than in the general population, (2) the
      classic symptoms of Meniere's disease can be part of a migraine attack, (3)
      symptoms of Meniere's disease may be associated with a migraine attack without
      headache (migraine equivalent), (4) treatment for the migraine with methysergide 
      maleate or prednisone may also improve the symptoms of Meniere's disease, and (5)
      prospective studies with adequate follow-up are needed to further investigate
      this association.

AB  - Three new antiepileptic drugs have been approved for use in the USA in the past
      year and a half and several others are available in Europe and Japan. Each of
      these drugs has been efficacious against partial seizures without or with
      secondary generalization and some may also be efficacious against primary
      generalized seizures. None of the new drugs appears to be a quantum leap in
      therapy over the others that are already available. How these new drugs will be
      integrated into a rational scheme for the treatment of individuals with epilepsy 
      remains to be determined. Side-effect profiles, pharmacokinetic issues, and cost 
      will likely be significantly issues.

PG  - 281-5
AB  - A retrospective chart review for the 1993 calendar year identified 187 children
      with cerebral malaria admitted to a large teaching hospital in central Ghana,
      West Africa. The most common clinical presentation was fever, sensorial
      depression and convulsions in young children experiencing their first episode of 
      malaria. One-half had splenomegaly. Additional features, seen in decreasing
      frequency, were hepatomegaly, vomiting, abdominal pain and headache. Long term
      sequelae were identified in 9% and mortality in 6%. Risk factors for central
      nervous system disease were negative history for previous malaria (P < 0.005) and
      a high percentage of parasitemia (P < 0.001). Death or long term sequelae were
      associated with multiple seizures and prolonged sensorial depression. The
      incidence of malaria is currently increasing in Western Africa and young children
      are more likely than older children to develop severe disease.

TI  - Lupus anticoagulant in the elderly may be associated with both quinine and
      quinidine usage.
PG  - 136-9
AB  - Thirty-one patients aged over 60 yrs and with lupus anticoagulant (LA) were
      reviewed for their drug intake. Twenty-three (73%) were taking cinchona
      alkaloids, 10 (32%) quinine for night cramps, 11 (35%) quinidine for cardiac
      arrhythmia and 2 (6%) were taking both. These frequencies of drugs usage differed
      significantly from age and sex matched controls (p < 0.001). Five patients had
      features suggestive of the antiphospholipid syndrome. Repeat testing showed
      persistent LA activity in all but 2 of 5 patients in whom the relevant drug had
      been ceased. This is the first description of a possible causal association
      between LA and quinine therapy.

TI  - Clinical experience with excitatory amino acid antagonist drugs.
PG  - 503-13
AB  - BACKGROUND: Excitotoxic damage due to excess release of neuronal glutamate is
      hypothesized to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of focal cerebral
      ischemia. Drugs that antagonize excitatory amino acid function are consistently
      neuroprotective in preclinical models of stroke, and many are now entering
      clinical trials. SUMMARY: Antagonists of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor
      are furthest advanced in clinical development for stroke. Both noncompetitive
      (aptiganel hydrochloride, dextrorphan) and competitive (selfotel, d-CPPene)
      antagonists have undergone tolerability studies in acute stroke and traumatic
      brain injury. These agents all cause a similar spectrum of neuropsychological
      symptoms, and several have important cardiovascular effects. Other modulatory
      sites on the NMDA receptor complex, notably the polyamine and magnesium ion
      sites, are also the subject of clinical trials. Glycine site antagonists are in
      early clinical development. Non-NMDA glutamate receptor antagonists remain in
      preclinical study. Neuroprotection by agents that block glutamate release in
      vitro may be due to sodium channel blockade in vivo, but some agents (619C89)
      exhibit neurological effects similar to NMDA antagonists in stroke. The
      therapeutic index is unknown for different drugs but may be determined by
      cardiovascular effects, especially hypotension, which may be detrimental after
      stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Excitatory amino acid antagonists are in advanced
      development in the treatment of stroke and traumatic brain injury. A similar
      pattern of side effects is apparent with the majority of agents. However,
      cardiovascular effects may ultimately define therapeutic index for each drug.

AB  - Although anxiety and depression are among the most common symptoms of persons
      seen in medical practice, a number of dilemmas still exist in the identification 
      and management of these disorders. The objectives of this paper are to review the
      prevalence and identification of anxiety, depression, and mixed
      anxiety-depression in medical practice; to review issues involving the medical
      evaluation of these disorders; to clarify the relevance of psychosocial issues to
      choice of treatment; and to review issues involving medication treatment choices.

AB  - Spinal spasticity is the term used to describe the increase in muscle tone which 
      often develops following spinal cord injury (SCI). A review of spasticity and
      approaches to its treatment has been presented in a previous article. The purpose
      of this paper is to discuss the pharmacologic agents that are currently used to
      treat spinal spasticity. These medications can be classified as centrally and
      peripherally acting agents. The following review is therefore organized into two 
      sections, according to the site of drug action.

TI  - The management of upper urinary tract calculi by piezoelectric extracorporeal
      shock wave lithotripsy in spinal cord injury patients.
PG  - 132-5
AB  - From May 1988 to September 1994, 15 spinal cord injury patients were treated by
      piezoelectric extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. Aged from 23 to 71 years
      (mean = 39), they presented with a total of 23 stones, of which 18 were located
      in the calyces, three in the renal pelvis and two in the proximal ureter. The
      maximum dimensions of calculi varied from 5 to 35 mm (mean = 11). Patients were
      placed in a dorsal decubitus position during the sessions, three being sedated
      with diazepam, while the other 12 remained unsedated. All were treated routinely 
      with systemic antibiotics. Auxiliary procedures consisted of two pyelocalyceal
      flushings, three double J ureteral stenting and three ureteroscopies with
      fragment removal with a Dormia basket. No episode of autonomic dysreflexia was
      observed. Short term side effects were limited to a few cases of gross haematuria
      which regressed spontaneously. Overall, eight successes (53%), and seven failures
      (47%), were registered. Of the failures, one was the result of a partial
      fragmentation, while six were related to intrarenal retention of residual
      fragments resulting in four cases in rapid recurrences. Extracorporeal shock wave
      lithotripsy can be easily applied to spinal cord injury patients. Its usefulness 
      and limitations need to be well understood and a global consideration must be
      applied to the prevention and early detection of the upper urinary calculi in
      this exposed population of patients.

AB  - The radiological approach of a child with severe cervical spinal cord injury
      after a difficult breech delivery is presented. This diagnosis is often missed

TI  - SUNCT syndrome: trials of drugs and anesthetic blockades.
PG  - 138-42
AB  - Nine patients with the SUNCT syndrome (Spanish and Norwegian patients) have, over
      many years, been given several drugs effective in the cluster headache syndrome, 
      trigeminal neuralgia, and other headaches, as well as drugs not previously used
      in headache. Various cranial nerves were also anesthetized in an endeavor to
      ameliorate the suffering of those patients. Although a partial effect was
      obtained with carbamazepine and corticosteroids in some patients, none of the
      drugs or anesthetic blockades had consistent, lasting, complete effect on
      headache paroxysms in SUNCT. The essentially negative outcome of this study aids 
      in further characterizing SUNCT as a separate disorder, and, above all, in
      distinguishing it from trigeminal neuralgia and the cluster headache syndrome.

TI  - New antiepileptic drugs.
PG  - 155-62
AB  - Notwithstanding pharmacokinetics has greatly increased the rational approach to
      the drug treatment of epilepsies, about 25% of the patients do not respond to the
      therapy. Therefore, a great effort has been made to discover new antiepileptic
      drugs effective in refractory seizures. On the basis of increased knowledge of
      seizure pathophysiology two principal groups of drugs have been developed: the
      first enhancing brain GABA activity (vigabatrin); the second inhibiting
      excitatory amino-acids (lamotrigine and felbamate). Oxcarbazepine has the same
      mechanism of action as carbamazepine, whereas gabapentin's mechanism is still
      uncertain. The major clinical indications of these new antiepileptic drugs are
      represented by partial complex seizures. Side effects (mostly regarding the
      central nervous system) appear mild, and clinical interactions have little
      importance. The role of therapeutic drug monitoring for these substances is at
      present not well established.

AB  - Sleep disturbances are found in most depressive patients. Serotonin reuptake
      inhibitors, such as fluoxetine hydrochloride, seem to improve sleep by changing
      the depressive affect and the underlying biological mechanisms. Insomnia is an
      occasional adverse effect of the medication, but it was shown that only 2-3% of
      the patients with fluoxetine-induced insomnia discontinued the drug for this
      reason. We could not find any report of nightmares or night terrors under
      fluoxetine treatment. We report on four patients who experienced nightmares on
      fluoxetine monotherapy.

TI  - The effects of the GABA agonist, baclofen, on sleep and breathing.
PG  - 230-4
AB  - The gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)-B agonist, baclofen, is a centrally-acting,
      anti-spasmodic agent and muscle relaxant used in spinal cord lesions, multiple
      sclerosis and other neurological disorders. In a previous pilot study of
      quadriplegic patients, 75% of whom were treated with baclofen, we found a high
      prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing. Because of the depressant effects of
      GABA on the central nervous system, we hypothesized that baclofen might aggravate
      sleep-disordered breathing in susceptible individuals by depressing central
      ventilatory drive, increasing upper airway obstruction and/or increasing the
      arousal threshold to apnoea. We therefore conducted a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, cross-over study of baclofen 25 mg, administered before sleep
      in 10 snorers with mild sleep-disordered breathing (respiratory disturbance index
      < 30 events per sleep hour). Each subject underwent two standard polysomnographic
      assessments, one week apart. Total sleep time was significantly prolonged by
      baclofen (placebo 356 +/- 9.9 SEM min; baclofen 386 +/- 9.9 min). Both nonrapid
      eye movement(REM) and REM sleep duration were increased (nonREM: placebo 295 +/- 
      6.8 min; baclofen 311 +/- 8.9 min; REM: placebo 61 +/- 7.5 min; baclofen 76 +/-
      9.0 min). Time spent awake after sleep onset was reduced after baclofen (placebo 
      71 +/- 10.3 min; baclofen 51 +/- 9.7 min). There was a slight reduction in mean
      overnight oxygen saturation (placebo 95.2 +/- 0.5%; baclofen 94.4 +/- 0.7%). The 
      frequency of apnoeas plus hypopnoeas (respiratory disturbance index (RDI)) did
      not change significantly (placebo 9 +/- 1.8 events.h-1; baclofen 13 +/- 3.4
      events.h-1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Intrathecal baclofen therapy for adults with spinal spasticity: therapeutic
      efficacy and effect on hospital admissions.
PG  - 22-9
AB  - A prospective trial to demonstrate the efficacy of intrathecal baclofen therapy
      by implanted pump for adults with spasticity due to spinal cord injury or
      multiple sclerosis was initiated in our hospital. Of the 140 patients assessed, 7
      met the following criteria for inclusion in the study: a modified Ashworth score 
      > 3, a spasm frequency score > 2, and an inadequate response to oral
      anti-spasticity drugs, (i.e., baclofen, clonidine and cyproheptadine). All
      patients responded to intrathecal bolus injection of baclofen in the double
      blind, placebo-controlled screening phase (mean bolus dose = 42.8 micrograms).
      Programmable Medtronic pumps were implanted in 4 patients while 3 patients
      received non-programmable Infusaid pumps. Post-implantation, a marked decrease in
      spasticity occurred with a significant reduction of the Ashworth score (mean =
      1.8, p < .005), a reduced spasm score (mean = 0.8, p < .005), and an improved leg
      swing in the pendulum test. These effects were maintained during a follow-up of
      24-41 months (average infusion dose = 218.7 micrograms/day). The gross
      cost-savings due to reduced hospitalizations related to spasticity was calculated
      by comparing the cost for the two year period before pump implantation to the
      same period after treatment for 6 of the 7 patients. The cost of in-hospital
      implantation as well as the cost of the pumps were deducted from the gross
      savings. There was a net cost-saving of $153,120. Our findings agree with the
      reported efficacy and safety of intrathecal baclofen treatment, and illustrate
      the cost-effectiveness of this treatment.

TI  - General management of patients with ischaemic stroke: clinical features and
      epidemiology.
PG  - 30-7
AB  - The management of patients with acute ischaemic stroke includes treatment of
      stroke itself, the management of medical problems, and the early initiation of
      rehabilitation. Current research focuses more on specific stroke treatment, such 
      as reperfusion or prevention of extension of ischaemic brain damage, than on the 
      management of general conditions and the treatment of medical complications
      associated with acute stroke. At present, a better prognosis of stroke is more
      often the consequence of good general management than of a specific therapy.
      General management of stroke includes cardiac and pulmonary care, fluid and ion
      balance restoration, metabolic maintenance, blood pressure control and prevention
      of bed sores and phlebitis. Treatment of elevated intracranial pressure and
      temperature control must also be considered in some cases. Several points,
      however, remain controversial, such as the treatment of arterial hypertension and
      the management of cardiac arrhythmia.

TI  - Treatment of acquired muscle spasticity using phenol peripheral nerve blocks.
PG  - 151-9
AB  - The use of phenol motor nerve blocks is advantageous in the early period of
      acquired spasticity (ie, that occurring following traumatic brain injury or
      incomplete spinal cord injury), when increased muscle tone is often the most
      severe. Because acquired spasticity is dynamic and usually improves slowly, a
      temporary treatment method used to ameliorate increased muscle tone is desirable.
      Phenol nerve infiltration provides a temporary motor nerve block that lasts for
      weeks or months. It allows passive limb mobilization in a comprehensive
      rehabilitation program that attempts to prevent fixed soft tissue contractures.
      Permanent or irreversible methods such as operative tendon lengthening, muscle
      release or recession, or neurectomy are usually best delayed until the spasticity
      has become static, when the need for surgical correction becomes more firmly
      indicated, and outcomes of operative intervention are more predictable. Although 
      phenol nerve blocks were initially administered at the spinal cord level to
      control spasticity, the potential side effects have caused a loss of popularity
      of this method of administration. The safer and more common use of phenol
      infiltration at the peripheral nerve level is now more accepted for brain injury 
      and spinal cord injury patients. This report reviews the indications, current
      concepts, and development of the different methods used to administer phenol
      nerve blocks. Comparisons to other methods to control spasticity are discussed.

TI  - Gabapentin and lamotrigine: novel antiepileptic drugs.
PG  - 61-9
AB  - The pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and adverse effects of gabapentin and
      lamotrigine, two new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), are reviewed. Gabapentin and
      lamotrigine are promising advances in the treatment of epilepsy, which has not
      been satisfactorily controlled by available agents in 25-41% of patients.
      Gabapentin is chemically similar to gamma-aminobutyric acid, but it is able to
      pass into the central nervous system. It is effective for the treatment of
      partial-onset seizures that are refractory to other AEDs. It has no known
      drug-drug interactions and a relatively benign adverse effect profile, but its
      short half-life necessitates at least thrice-daily dosing. Lamotrigine is
      structurally unrelated to the other available AEDs. Its role is currently limited
      to add-on therapy in patients with partial seizures, with or without secondary
      generalization, that are resistant to current treatment. The efficacy of
      lamotrigine in patients with primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, absence
      seizures, and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome remains to be validated. The adverse effect
      profile also remains to be determined. A rash may appear in up to 5% of patients,
      possibly necessitating discontinuation of the drug. Although lamotrigine does not
      seem to affect the pharmacokinetics of the other AEDs, the other AEDs affect
      lamotrigine pharmacokinetics. Lamotrigine can be given once or twice daily.
      Gabapentin and lamotrigine may be useful in treating patients whose epilepsy is
      not controlled by other available AEDs; however, further research is needed to
      confirm their roles in epilepsy treatment.

AB  - This study was performed to compare the effects of continuous intrathecal
      baclofen infusion (CIBI) and selective posterior rhizotomy (SPR) on upper
      extremity (UE) spasticity and range of motion in children with cerebral palsy.
      Spasticity was assessed with the Ashworth scale of muscle tone and range of
      motion was evaluated. Thirty-eight patients who had been treated with CIBI for at
      least 6 months were paired, according to pretreatment UE muscle tone and
      functional status, with 38 patients who had undergone SPR. The CIBI dosage had
      been titrated to reduce over lower extremity spasticity and improve lower
      extremity function, rather than to improve UE tone. The pretreatment muscle tone 
      in the two groups was virtually identical. The UE tone of children treated with
      CIBI decreased from 2.07 prior to treatment to 1.66 after 1 year (p < 0.01). The 
      tone of children treated with SPR decreased from 2.03 to 1.70 after 1 year (p =
      0.005). In that group, the likelihood of a clinically significant reduction in
      muscle tone (one point or greater) was greater in children with a higher
      pretreatment UE muscle tone. There was no correlation between the percentage of
      posterior lumbar roots divided in SPR and the subsequent reduction in UE tone.
      There were no significant changes in the range of motion in any UE joint, at
      either 6 or 12 months, after either CIBI or SPR. We conclude that both CIBI and
      SPR significantly reduce UE spasticity, in addition to the previously documented 
      reduction in lower extremity spasticity.

TI  - Influence of baclofen upon the alpha-motoneuron in spasticity by means of F-wave 
      analysis.
PG  - 103-7
AB  - Intrathecal baclofen dramatically improves severe spastic syndromes. This
      improvement is likely related to reduced excitability of alpha-motoneurons. To
      investigate the influence of baclofen upon the alpha-motoneuron, we analyzed
      F-waves before and after intrathecal baclofen bolus injection (usually 50
      micrograms) as well as after administration of different, constantly delivered
      doses (60-200 micrograms/day). Intrathecal baclofen bolus decreased the maximum
      F-wave amplitude (Fp) from an initial value of 9% of the maximum M amplitude
      (Mmax) (= F/M-ratio) to 2.4% of the Mmax after 130-180 min, reduced the mean
      F-wave amplitude 60% within 150 min, and shortened the mean duration by 40-60%
      after 130-180 min. Constantly delivered baclofen of 100 micrograms/day reduced
      the F/M-ratio from 5% to 2%, the mean F-wave amplitude by 40-80%, and the F-wave 
      mean duration by 40-80%. The minimum F-wave latency did not change after bolus or
      during steady state administration. The findings indicate that the F-wave mean
      and maximum amplitude as well as the mean duration are altered in a quantifiable 
      manner following intrathecal baclofen application.

TI  - Out-patient cognitive-behavioural therapy with amitriptyline for chronic
      non-malignant pain: a comparative study with 6-month follow-up.
PG  - 49-54
AB  - A study was carried out in a multidisciplinary pain clinic with the purpose of
      comparing the effectiveness of outpatient cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT)
      with amitriptyline (AMI) to that of supportive therapy with AMI. The treatments
      were given weekly over 8 weeks. Global and continuous outcome measures were used.
      Analysis was by chi-square for global data and MANOVA with baseline scores as
      covariants for continuous variables. No significant differences could be
      demonstrated. The scores over a 6-month follow-up period suggested a delayed
      positive advantage for CBT but this only approached and did not achieve
      statistical significance. The findings are discussed.

TI  - Continuous midazolam infusion for the management of morphine-induced myoclonus.
PG  - 25-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe a patient with morphine-induced myoclonus treated with a
      continuous infusion of midazolam and continued morphine dose escalation. DESIGN: 
      Single case report. SETTING: Delivery, monitoring, and titration of morphine and 
      midazolam in the patient's home by a homecare agency. RESULTS: The use of high
      dosages of morphine (i.e., 500 mg/h) produced myoclonic spasms in this patient,
      which in turn resulted in increasing pain. To allow for continuation of effective
      analgesia and to control the myoclonic spasms, an infusion of midazolam was
      initiated and titrated. The midazolam infusion allowed for continuation of the
      morphine dosage and also permitted further dosage escalation. As morphine dosages
      were further escalated, it was also necessary to increase the midazolam infusion 
      to control additional myoclonic spasms. CONCLUSIONS: Use of a concomitant
      midazolam infusion with high doses of morphine appears to be safe and is an
      effective means of controlling morphine-induced myoclonus. If further dosage
      increase of morphine are necessary in this setting, increases in the midazolam
      infusion also may be required.

      function in various regions of the central and peripheral nervous system. In this
      review, we describe examples of functional evaluation of neurotransmission at the
      neuromuscular junction, in some spinal interneurons and intracortical circuits as
      well as evaluation of pharmacological modulation of some electrophysiological
      tests. These investigations are carried out to help our understanding of the
      pathophysiology of brain diseases. Finally, we discuss possible relationships
      between electrophysiological tests (evoked/event-related potentials and
      exteroceptive suppression of temporalis muscle activity) and neurotransmitter
      function in headache.

TI  - Cost analysis of continuous intrathecal baclofen versus selective functional
      posterior rhizotomy in the treatment of spastic quadriplegia associated with
      cerebral palsy.
PG  - 255-64; discussion 265
AB  - The purpose of the study was to analyze the relative cost of selective functional
      posterior rhizotomy (SFPR) and continuous intrathecal baclofen in the treatment
      of children with severe spastic quadriplegia related to cerebral palsy. No
      attempt was made to analyze the efficacy of the two types of treatment. Nine
      children with spastic quadriplegia secondary to cerebral palsy in whom continuous
      intrathecal baclofen was attempted were matched as closely as possible with a
      group of 10 patients with spastic quadriplegia out of a total of 100 children who
      had undergone SFPR in the same time period. Clinical care flow charts were
      created to identify the various points of contact with members of the health care
      team, so that cost points could be identified and costs calculated. The cost per 
      patient up to 1 year a after treatment CDN$ 64,163.10 for patients with implanted
      pumps for continuous intrathecal baclofen versus CDN$ 16,913.54 for SFPR. When
      adjustments were made to exclude costs and savings associated with research
      protocols, the average for the baclofen group decreased to approximately CDN$
      63,000, with minimal change for the SFPR group. The higher cost per patient on
      baclofen was related to the cost associated with screening patients who did not
      go on to have implantation of a continuous infusion pump, and to additional
      hospitalization for complications in the baclofen group. It is cautioned that
      this cost analysis was based on the experience at British Columbia's Children's
      Hospital, and the results may not be generalizable to other institutions or to
      other patient populations.

TI  - Gliomatosis cerebri presenting as intractable epilepsy during early childhood.
PG  - 37-45
AB  - We review 160 cases of gliomatosis cerebri from the literature and report an
      additional three infants and young children who presented with intractable
      epilepsy, corticospinal tract deficits, and developmental delay in whom a
      pathologic diagnosis was made. The progressive nature of the encephalopathy in
      our cases was documented by serial clinical examination, electroencephalograms,
      magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomographic scans. The natural 
      history of gliomatosis cerebri was determined by a retrospective review of the
      literature of 160 cases in 85 reports. The most common neurologic symptoms and
      signs included corticospinal tract deficits (58%), dementia/mental retardation
      (44%), headache (39%), seizures (38%), cranioneuropathies (37%), increased
      intracranial pressure (34%), and spinocerebellar deficits (33%). The most
      commonly involved central nervous system structures were the centrum semiovale
      and cerebrum (76%), mesencephalon (52%), pons (52%), thalamus (43%), basal
      ganglia (34%), and the cerebellum (29%). Fifty-two percent of patients were dead 
      within 12 months of onset. Different grades of glial neoplasm may also coexist
      within gliomatosis cerebri such as astrocytoma with anaplastic astrocytoma,
      atypical or anaplastic oligodendroglioma, and glioblastoma multiforme. Hypotheses
      regarding the pathogenesis of gliomatosis cerebri include blastomatous
      dysgenesis, diffuse infiltration, multicentric origin, in situ proliferation, and
      "field transformation." The biologic determinants of whether a transformed glial 
      cell behaves as a relatively localized tumor mass or truly loses anchorage
      dependence to become migratory as well as proliferative are not understood.

TI  - GABAB receptors.
PG  - 187-246
AB  - GABAB receptors are a distinct subclass of receptors for the major inhibitory
      transmitter 4-aminobutanoic acid (GABA) that mediate depression of synaptic
      transmission and contribute to the inhibition controlling neuronal excitability. 
      The development of specific agonists and antagonists for these receptors has led 
      to a better understanding of their physiology and pharmacology, highlighting
      their diverse coupling to different intracellular effectors through Gi/G(o)
      proteins. This review emphasises our current knowledge of the neurophysiology and
      neurochemistry of GABAB receptors, including their heterogeneity, as well as the 
      therapeutic potential of drugs acting at these sites.

TI  - High beta-adrenoceptor density on peripheral blood mononuclear cells in
      progressive multiple sclerosis: a manifestation of autonomic dysfunction?
PG  - 382-7
AB  - In multiple sclerosis (MS) up-regulation of beta-adrenoceptors on peripheral
      blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) has been attributed to either autonomic
      dysfunction, inflammation or a combination of the two. We have compared secondary
      progressive MS patients with normal subjects (NS) and two models of autonomic
      dysfunction; pure autonomic failure (PAF) and multiple system atrophy (MSA,
      Shy-Drager syndrome). There was up-regulation of beta-adrenoceptors on PBMCs in
      MS and PAF patients but not in MSA patients. Only in PAF patients
      beta-adrenoceptor up-regulation was correlated with low plasma levels of
      noradrenaline (NA) and adrenaline (Ad). In addition to studies in the basal
      state, measurements also were made after the centrally acting sympatholytic agent
      clonidine. These were combined with haemodynamic and neurohormonal measurements. 
      After clonidine, there was a fall in blood pressure in NS and MSA patients but
      not in MS and PAF patients; a rise in growth hormone (GH) in NS and PAF patients 
      but not in MS and MSA patients; and an up-regulation in PBMCs beta-adrenoceptors 
      in NS but not in MS, MSA and PAF patients. Up-regulation of beta-adrenoceptors on
      PBMCs in MS could be attributed to autonomic dysfunction but the disparity
      between MS and PAF patients when considering their plasma levels of NA and Ad
      argue against. Although the neurohormonal responses to clonidine and the
      physiological assessment of autonomic function in progressive MS patients,
      demonstrate central autonomic dysfunction resembling that of the MSA patients,
      the normal basal beta-adrenoceptor densities in the latter, suggests that the
      up-regulation of these receptors is independent of the central autonomic
      dysfunction in MS.

TI  - Enhancement of locomotor recovery following spinal cord injury.
PG  - 517-24
AB  - Recent advances have been made in new experimental approaches to enhance
      locomotor recovery in spinal cord-injured subjects. Research in adult animals
      whose spinal cords have been transected (spinal animals) has focused particularly
      on locomotor recovery and the use of pharmacological tools to trigger and
      modulate the locomotor pattern. This provides a rational basis for the
      rehabilitation and pharmacotherapy of locomotion in spinal cord-injured patients.
      Findings in the field of locomotor training, locomotor pharmacotherapy, and
      functional electrical stimulation are reviewed. It is argued that a combination
      of the various approaches will provide an optimal base for functional locomotor
      recovery.

TI  - The new anticonvulsant drugs. Implications for avoidance of adverse effects.
PG  - 422-31
AB  - Several new antiepileptic drugs offer a worthwhile alternative when standard
      antiepileptic drugs have failed. Suggestions have been made to improve the
      risk-benefit ratio of the new antiepileptic agents. More specifically,
      vigabatrin, which is a very useful and well tolerated new antiepileptic drug for 
      refractory partial epilepsy, should be started at a low dosage of 0.5 g/day with 
      increments of 0.5 g/day every week. Daily dosages exceeding 3 g/day should be
      restricted to patients with improvement. If necessary, the daily dosage of
      vigabatrin should be withdrawn slowly, i.e. by not more than 1 g/week.
      Lamotrigine is also a beneficial new drug for refractory partial and generalized 
      seizures. However, the drug is associated with rash. In patients also receiving
      valproic acid (sodium valproate) [which inhibits the metabolism of lamotrigine], 
      the incidence of rash can be reduced by slow titration of 25mg every other day
      for the first week and 25mg per day for the second week. Rare hypersensitivity
      reactions, e.g. Stevens-Johnson syndrome, remain a problem. The risk-benefit
      ratio of felbamate has recently been compromised by fatal aplastic anaemia and
      fatal liver disease in a number of patients. In general, patients should be
      withdrawn from felbamate, if possible, until further clarification of its
      definitive risk-benefit ratio. Finally, gabapentin is a very safe add-on
      medication. Its remarkably low potential to cause adverse effects makes it a
      welcome addition for the treatment of refractory partial epilepsy.

TI  - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: pharmacologic profiles and potential
      therapeutic distinctions.
PG  - 1359-69
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the respective pharmacologic profiles of the selective
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), with particular emphasis placed on
      clinically relevant distinctions. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search was conducted to
      identify English language literature published within the last five years on the 
      four SSRIs (fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, fluvoxamine). Previous review
      articles were scrutinized for additional citations, and manufacturers provided a 
      contemporary bibliography of more recent material. STUDY SELECTION/DATA
      EXTRACTION: Studies were selected for specific citation on the basis of
      comparative research merit and the contribution of this original literature to
      the pharmacologic profile(s) described. DATA SYNTHESIS: All SSRIs appear to be
      more efficacious than placebo for the acute treatment of major depressive
      disorder (MDD). Short-term (six-week) efficacy was comparable with that of
      tricyclic antidepressants for the amelioration of MDD regarded as moderate in
      severity. Further comparative trials are clearly indicated to demonstrate the
      therapeutic benefits of SSRIs in specific populations (e.g., geriatric, severely 
      ill) and to demonstrate sustained benefit with long-term prophylaxis. Other
      potential indications for SSRIs include obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic
      disorder, bulimia, and chronic pain syndromes. Pharmacokinetic profiles of the
      four SSRIs reveal similar parametric values, and most quantitative differences
      are of limited clinical significance. Adverse effects are common but ordinarily
      mild and transient, primarily restricted to the gastrointestinal tract and
      central nervous system. Important differences in the prevalence or severity of
      these adverse effects await the accumulation of further clinical experience and
      the completion of additional comparative trials. Similarly, the relative
      propensity of SSRIs to inhibit the metabolism of other medications is currently
      under investigation. CONCLUSIONS: The four SSRIs studied appear to be more
      similar than they are different. Slowly, important distinctions are beginning to 
      emerge with regard to adverse effect profiles and potential drug interactions.
      Given that the costs of these respective medications are comparable, such
      differences may ultimately serve to establish the preferential selection of
      individual agents in specific clinical situations.

PG  - 345-59; discussion 359-61
AB  - Acute and chronic stress as well as a number of psychiatric and neurological
      disorders are accompanied by profound disturbances of the HPA system. These
      neuroendocrine alterations act back on the central nervous tissue mainly via
      corticosteroids-affecting glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors. The
      major conclusions drawn from studies probing these receptors in clinical
      investigations are: (1) In many such conditions central corticosteroid receptors 
      are weakened in their capacity to curtail spontaneous and stress-elevated
      corticosteroid levels; (2) the combined DEX-CRH test is the best neuroendocrine
      tool currently available for identifying HPA abnormalities in psychiatric
      patients; (3) in depression the decreased corticosteroid receptor capacity in
      transient, and antidepressants act through reinstatement of GR and MR function
      probably resulting in reduced hypothalamic CRH and AVP production; (4) several
      neurological disorders such as MS and HIV infection are often accompanied by
      altered HPA function, which has therapeutic implications; and (5) various
      corticosteroids, their biosynthetic precursors and their metabolites have
      differentiable effects on the sleep EEG, which can be attributed to their mode of
      action; specifically, steroids such as pregnenolone and DHEA most likely are
      produced in glia cells and act in a paracrine fashion at neurons, thus modifying 
      the sleep EEG in humans in a manner that suggests their potential as memory
      enhancers.

TI  - Writing tremor after discrete cortical infarction.
PG  - 2280-2
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hand tremor is a rare manifestation of stroke, and writing tremor has
      not been reported to be produced by stroke. We describe a patient who developed a
      unilateral hand tremor mimicking primary writing tremor after discrete cerebral
      cortical infarction. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 67-year-old man developed mild right
      hemiparesis. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed a discrete cortical infarct 
      in the left frontal area. After recovery of motor power, the patient showed
      significant right hand tremor exclusively during writing or similar motor
      activities including tooth brushing or shaving. The tremor was temporarily
      alleviated by clonazepam but persisted until 7 months of follow-up. Medical
      history suggested that the patient had mild essential tremor, but he did not
      experience tremor on writing before the onset of stroke. CONCLUSIONS: This
      observation suggests that unilateral hand tremor mimicking primary writing tremor
      may be produced by cortical infarction. It remains unclear whether the patient's 
      previous essential tremor played an additional role in the development of this
      symptom.

TI  - Diagnosis and treatment of persistent pain after trauma to the head and neck.
PG  - 1138-47; discussion 1147-8
AB  - PURPOSE: A retrospective and prospective study on 22 cases of persistent pain
      after trauma to the head and neck is presented. According to the predominant
      symptoms and signs, pain patterns could be divided into musculoskeletal,
      vascular, and neuropathic, facilitating treatment decisions. Most cases were
      musculoskeletal in origin, with many demonstrating a combination of two or three 
      pain states. RESULTS: The variety of pain complaints and their underlying
      pathophysiology are discussed and treatments for specific pain states are
      examined. CONCLUSION: Amitriptyline was the most useful drug in that it provided 
      pain relief in musculoskeletal, vascular, and some neuropathic pain conditions.
      Multidrug therapy may be indicated in some recalcitrant cases, and drug
      alternatives are discussed.

TI  - The serotonin syndrome associated with paroxetine, an over-the-counter cold
      remedy, and vascular disease.
PG  - 642-4
AB  - There is a new, potentially fatal disorder that is infrequently reported. The
      apparent rareness may be because of a lack of recognition of the syndrome or its 
      predisposing factors. Fluoxetine (Prozac, Dista Products Co, Division of Eli
      Lilly Co, Indianapolis, IN), sertraline (Zoloft, Roerig Division, Pfizer Inc, New
      York, NY), and paroxetine (Paxil, SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals,
      Philadelphia, PA) belong to a new class of antidepressant medication: the
      serotonin reuptake-inhibitors (SRIs). The relative safety profile of the SRIs has
      led to their widespread use. However, a syndrome of excessive serotonergic
      activity, the "serotonin syndrome" (SS), has recently been recognized. It is
      characterized by changes in mental status, hypertension, restlessness, myoclonus,
      hyperreflexia, diaphoresis, shivering, and tremor. A high index of suspicion is
      required to make the diagnosis in these acutely ill patients. The most common
      agents implicated in SS are the monoamine oxidase inhibitors in combination with 
      L-tryptophan or fluoxetine. A case of a patient with significant peripheral
      vascular disease who developed SS while taking paroxetine and an over-the-counter
      cold medicine is reported. There have been no prior reports of this interaction. 
      Discontinuation of the offending agents, sedation, and supportive care are the
      mainstays of treatment. The interactions of serotonin with platelets and vascular
      endothelium are also discussed.

TI  - Chronic tension-type headache: amitriptyline reduces clinical headache-duration
      and experimental pain sensitivity but does not alter pericranial muscle activity 
      readings.
PG  - 241-9
AB  - In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, the effect of 75 mg of a
      slow-release formulation of amitriptyline on the clinical severity of chronic
      tension-type headache and on headache-associated neurophysiological parameters
      (EMG activity, exteroceptive suppression of temporal muscle activity, contingent 
      negative variation (CNV) and experimental pain sensitivity) was investigated. All
      of the patients treated had a history of headaches of many years' standing and
      many of them had failed attempts at treatment. In the amitriptyline group, a
      significant reduction in daily headache duration was already found in the 3rd
      week of treatment, while in the placebo group no significant changes in headache 
      duration were to be seen. In week 6 the amitriptyline group had a significantly
      shorter daily duration of headache than did the placebo group. Treatment did not 
      result in any significant effects on EMG recordings of pericranial muscle
      activity either during relaxation or contraction, on exteroceptive suppression of
      the temporal muscle and on CNV. The sensitivity to suprathreshold experimental
      pain, however, was significantly reduced. The data show a statistically relevant 
      reduction of daily headache duration. However, they also show that amitriptyline 
      can only partly alleviate chronic headaches but cannot cure them.

TI  - [Different opioids in patients at cardiovascular risk. Comparison of central and 
      peripheral hemodynamic adverse effects].
PG  - 743-9
AB  - Efficient analgesia may be the major objective in the cardiovascular risk patient
      following myocardial infarction, acute occlusion of peripheral vessels, or
      dissection/perforation of major abdominal vessels. It was the purpose of the
      study to investigate the haemodynamic and respiratory side effects of eight
      different opioids in 57 circulatory risk patients prior to major vascular
      surgery. METHODS. Patients were randomly allocated to eight groups, each
      receiving a different opioid within a clinical, equipotent dose range
      (buprenorphine, fentanyl, morphine, nalbuphine, pentazocine, pethidine, tramadol,
      alfentanil). A complete haemodynamic and blood gas status was obtained prior to
      as well as 5, 10, 15, and 20 min following opioid administration. Monitoring
      included a complete invasive haemodynamic and blood gas status. Statistical
      evaluation was performed by 1- and 2-factorial ANOVA (P < 0.05). RESULTS.
      Significant time effects (changes from baseline at the time of measurement) were 
      observed for heart rate and total peripheral resistance, while significant group 
      (group-specific differences in the course of values at the different times of
      measurements) and time effects were noted for mean pulmonary artery pressure,
      pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, stroke volume index, and PaO2. No major
      effects were observed following morphine, fentanyl, alfentanil, tramadol, and
      nalbuphine. Buprenorphine caused distinct respiratory depression accompanied by
      an increase in pulmonary vascular tone. Pentazocine and pethidine caused a
      significant increase in MPAP and peripheral vascular resistance while pethidine
      also produced marked respiratory depression. CONCLUSIONS. For interpretation of
      the results, factors such as respiratory depression, histamine release, secretion
      of endogenous catecholamines, and hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction have
      to be discussed. Tramadol, an opioid with moderate potency, seems to offer some
      advantages due to its minor cardiovascular and respiratory side effects.

TI  - Tonic "seizures" in a patient with brainstem demyelination: MRI study of brain
      and spinal cord.
PG  - 258-62
AB  - Tonic seizures are a poorly understood manifestation of demyelinating disease,
      first reported in 4 patients with multiple sclerosis. We describe a patient with 
      tonic extension of the left limbs caused by a right-sided brainstem lesion as the
      first manifestation of demyelinating disease. A 19-year-old man was referred with
      a 4-month history of spontaneous attacks of mild paresthesias of the left arm and
      leg, followed by 15-45 s of rigid extension of the left limbs, occurring up to 25
      times per day. Two months after onset, an MRI scan revealed areas of T2
      abnormality in the lateral right cerebral peduncle and deep frontal white matter.
      The EEG was normal, including during hyperventilation which induced a typical
      episode. All attacks were successfully suppressed by carbamazepine, phenytoin,
      and valproate monotherapy. Serologic testing for toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, 
      Epstein-Barr virus, Lyme disease, and HIV was negative. Cerebrospinal fluid
      oligoclonal bands were absent but cerebrospinal fluid immunoglobulin G was mildly
      elevated (4.2 mg/dl). Over the next 30 months, serial MRIs revealed a normal
      spinal cord and persistence of the midbrain lesion, with resolution of some of
      the white matter lesions but reappearance of others. At 46 months, the midbrain
      lesion resolved on MRI, and the spasms no longer occurred spontaneously, nor
      could they be elicited by hyperventilation. While two previous reports have shown
      internal capsule lesions to underlie the tonic spasms in demyelinating disease,
      this is the first report in which a brainstem lesion has been causative.

AB  - Neuropathic pain following spinal cord injury (SCI) can be difficult to manage
      using currently available pain management techniques. We describe a case of
      chronic pain following SCI which failed to respond to a variety of approaches
      including intrathecal administration of morphine. Use of clonidine in addition to
      the morphine resulted in a marked decrease in pain. The use of intrathecal
      clonidine with or without opioids may present an effective alternative in the
      management of intractable SCI pain and other forms of neuropathic pain.

TI  - A simplified high-performance liquid chromatographic method for direct

      patients.
PG  - 509-12
AB  - A simplified method for direct determination of warfarin enantiomers by
      high-pressure liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection has been
      developed. This method involves solid phase extraction of warfarin in plasma,
      precolumn derivatization to form diastereoisomeric esters, and post-column
      reaction to discriminate each enantiomer separately. Ultrafiltration was employed
      in the separation of unbound warfarin enantiomers. Twelve plasma samples from six
      stroke patients taking warfarin regularly were analyzed. The average
      concentration of total warfarin was 0.47 +/- 0.17 mg/L for the S-isomer and 0.69 
      +/- 0.18 mg/L for the R-isomer. The average protein binding was 99.67 +/- 0.33%
      for S-warfarin and 99.44 +/- 0.33% for R-warfarin. This methodology provides a
      quick and reliable technique for determining enantiomeric protein binding of
      warfarin in clinical settings.

TI  - Gabapentin: a new agent for the management of epilepsy.
PG  - 1188-96
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of 
      gabapentin, a new antiepileptic drug (AED). Gabapentin's potential role in the
      treatment of epilepsy also was assessed. DATA SOURCE: A MEDLINE search was
      performed to identify all published literature (manuscripts and abstracts).
      Abstracts presented at the American Epilepsy Society, International Epilepsy
      Congress, and American Academy of Neurology meetings from 1991 to 1993 also were 
      reviewed. A copy of the proceedings from the Food and Drug Administration
      Peripheral and Central Nervous System Advisory Committee meeting and package
      insert were obtained from Parke Davis. STUDY SELECTION: All pertinent literature 
      was reviewed. Emphasis was placed on published information, particularly
      placebo-controlled clinical trials. DATA SYNTHESIS: Gabapentin is effective as
      adjunctive treatment for patients with partial seizures with or without secondary
      generalization refractory to the standard AEDs. It has a unique pharmacokinetic
      profile for an AED, including no binding to plasma proteins, primary elimination 
      by the kidney, and dose-dependent oral absorption at high dosages. No drug
      interactions occur with the other AEDs. The most frequent adverse reactions noted
      in patients receiving gabapentin have been mild and transient central nervous
      system effects. No serious hypersensitivity or systemic reactions have been
      observed. CONCLUSIONS: Gabapentin appears to be a useful new AED. Further studies
      evaluating its use as monotherapy, in higher dosages, and in pediatric and
      elderly patients are required to better delineate its therapeutic role relative
      to that of other AEDs.

TI  - Ticlopidine and fatal aplastic anemia in an elderly woman.
PG  - 1169-71
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report a case of aplastic anemia that developed during ticlopidine 
      treatment. CASE SUMMARY: An 84-year-old woman was started on ticlopidine for
      secondary stroke prevention. Within six weeks of initiating ticlopidine therapy
      she developed aplastic anemia. She was hospitalized and received empiric
      antibiotics, antifungal agents, blood transfusions, platelets, and granulocyte
      colony-stimulating factor. The patient died on day 76 after beginning
      ticlopidine. DISCUSSION: Hematologic effects such as neutropenia,
      thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and
      pancytopenia have been described with the use of ticlopidine. Previous case
      reports have associated ticlopidine with the development of aplastic anemia.
      CONCLUSIONS: Ticlopidine can produce fatal hematologic adverse effects, and its
      use should be reserved as second-line therapy.

TI  - Inhibition of bronchial hyperresponsiveness by the GABA-agonist baclofen.
PG  - 758-61
AB  - gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a well-known inhibitory transmitter of the
      central nervous system. Recently, the presence of GABA and its receptors has been
      confirmed in peripheral tissues, including lung tissue. gamma-Aminobutyric acid
      and the GABA-agonist baclofen have been shown in animal studies to inhibit airway
      responsiveness to various bronchoconstricting agents. The results of these
      investigations suggest the possibility of a role for baclofen in the therapy of
      human airway hyperreactivity. We recently showed that subjects with cervical
      spinal cord injury (quadriplegia) uniformly exhibit hyperresponsiveness to
      methacholine. The interruption of sympathetic airway innervation and resultant
      unopposed cholinergic tone occurring after transection of the cervical spine are 
      thought to explain this phenomenon. We compared bronchial responsiveness with
      methacholine (PC20) in a control group of otherwise healthy quadriplegic
      nonsmokers (n = 8) with a similar group of subjects (n = 6) maintained on
      baclofen for the relief of muscle spasm. Mean PC20 (mg/ml) among the control
      group was 1.42 +/- 1.6(SD) vs 15.0 +/- 9.1 in the baclofen group (p = 0.001). The
      inhibition of bronchial hyperresponsiveness in subjects with cervical spinal cord
      injury maintained on chronic baclofen therapy suggests the drug's ability to
      block neuronal acetylcholine release within airways, as well as a possible direct
      effect on airway smooth muscle. This action of baclofen, along with its
      documented ability in animal lung to inhibit release of other inflammatory
      mediators, supports further investigation of this drug as a potential therapeutic
      agent for asthma treatment.

TI  - Ondansetron reduces the incidence and severity of poststrabismus repair vomiting 
      in children.
PG  - 486-9
AB  - This prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study evaluated 
      the antiemetic efficacy of ondansetron and metoclopramide in 90 ASA physical
      status I or II children, 2-17 yr of age, undergoing strabismus repair. After
      anesthetic induction and prior to eye muscle manipulation, subjects received
      normal saline 0.3 mL/kg (Group 1), metoclopramide 0.25 mg/kg (Group 2), or
      ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg (Group 3), intravenously. There were no differences
      between groups with respect to age, weight, gender, fluids received, number of
      eye muscles repaired, anesthetic technique, or time in the operating room. The
      incidence of vomiting in Groups 1, 2, and 3 was 50%, 27%, and 10% prior to
      discharge, and 67%, 53%, and 30% during the 24 h after surgery, respectively. The
      number of children vomiting prior to discharge and within 24 h of surgery was
      significantly reduced in Group 3 compared with Group 1 (P < 0.003 and P < 0.015, 
      respectively). The number of vomiting episodes per patient in Groups 1, 2, and 3 
      was 1.1, 0.5, and 0.1 prior to discharge, and 4.5, 2.6, and 1.2 during the 24 h
      after surgery (P < 0.0005 and P < 0.004, respectively). Ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg
      intravenously after the induction of anesthesia reduces the incidence and
      severity of vomiting after strabismus repair both prior to discharge from the
      hospital and during the 24 h after surgery.

TI  - Depression in the medically ill: choosing an antidepressant.
PG  - 90-7; discussion 98-100
AB  - Choosing an antidepressant for a medically ill patient is a common clinical
      problem. There is an increased prevalence of depression among patients with many 
      medical illnesses. The clinician must be familiar with the recent additions to
      the antidepressant armamentarium, including the synaptic pharmacology and
      pharmacokinetics of the available agents. The factors usually used to guide
      antidepressant selection must be augmented by a careful evaluation of the
      patient's medical illness and therapeutic regimen. Special attention must be paid
      to the potential for drug-illness and drug-drug interactions. The author has used
      the example of four illnesses commonly associated with depression--stroke,
      cancer, Parkinson's disease, and dementia--to illustrate how these considerations
      affect the choice of an antidepressant.

TI  - A comparative study of amitriptyline and fluvoxamine in migraine prophylaxis.
PG  - 476-8
AB  - Current treatment of migraine either abortive or prophylactic is often
      unsatisfactory. Prophylactic treatment of severe migraine may reduce attack
      frequency, and current therapy centers on beta-blockers, serotonin (5-HT)
      reuptake blockers and 5-HT2 receptor antagonists. The author compared the
      efficacy and safety of amitriptyline and fluvoxamine among migraine patients
      (24F, 8M vs. 23F, 9M) in a double blind study. The efficacy of amitriptyline has 
      already been established by earlier clinical studies. The other investigated
      drug, fluvoxamine, has a more selective 5-HT reuptake blocking property than
      amitriptyline. In this study, amitriptyline significantly reduced the number of
      headache attacks, but it caused severe drowsiness in many migraineurs. The
      fluvoxamine also favorably influenced on the number of headache attacks and
      caused only slight side effects. These findings suggest, that fluvoxamine may be 
      an alternative drug in migraine prophylaxis, however, further studies should be
      performed with more subjects.

TI  - Effects of tizanidine administration on exteroceptive suppression of the
      temporalis muscle in patients with chronic tension-type headache.
PG  - 455-7
AB  - The aim of this study was to clarify the changes of inhibitory interneuronal
      activity in patients with chronic tension-type headache with disorder of
      pericranial muscle after treatment, and the pharmacological mechanisms of
      tizanidine--an alpha 2 adrenergic agonist. The effects of tizanidine on
      exteroceptive suppression (ES) of the temporalis muscle were examined in eighteen
      patients with chronic tension-type headache with disorder of pericranial muscles,
      before and two weeks after the administration of tizanidine. The left mental
      nerve was stimulated, under the maximal voluntary contraction of the temporalis
      muscles. Two types of stimulation were used: weak stimulation with four times the
      sensory threshold, and strong stimulation with 10 times the sensory threshold.
      The rectified electromyographic activity was recorded from the right temporalis
      muscle. ES2 produced by four times the sensory threshold was lengthened after
      tizanidine administration. This fact suggests that tizanidine improves the
      inhibitory function in the central nervous system, and then relieves headache.
      However, ES produced by 10 times the sensory threshold did not change. This
      suggests that the effect of tizanidine may be relatively mild. The interneurones 
      mediating ES2 may be modified by the alpha 2 agonist.

TI  - Botulinum toxin A for trismus in cephalic tetanus.
PG  - 410-3
AB  - Cephalic tetanus is a localized form of tetanus. As in generalized forms, trismus
      is a prominent feature of the disease, leading to considerable difficulty in
      feeding, swallowing of the saliva and mouth hygiene. These difficulties often
      precede respiratory problems and aspiration bronchopneumonia is a frequent
      life-threatening complication. Muscle relaxants other than curare drugs may show 
      a limited benefit for relieving trismus. Tetanospasmin, the tetanic neurotoxin,
      and botulinum toxin share many similarities, having a closely related chemical
      structure, an origin from related microorganisms (Clostridium tetani and
      Clostridium botulinum, respectively), and presumably, the same mechanisms of
      action in the neuron. The difference between the two lies in their peculiar
      neurospecificity, acting in different neurons. Injection of minute doses of
      botulinum toxin in the muscles involved in focal dystonias or other localized
      spastic disorders have proved to be very effective in these conditions. We
      describe the use of botulinum toxin A in the successful treatment of trismus in a
      patient suffering from cephalic tetanus. We believe that this form of treatment
      may be of value in lowering the risk of pulmonary complications in tetanic
      patients.

TI  - Lansoprazole. A reappraisal of its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic
      properties, and its therapeutic efficacy in acid-related disorders.
PG  - 404-30
AB  - Lansoprazole is a benzimidazole derivative that effectively decreases gastric
      acid secretion, regardless of the primary stimulus, via inhibition of gastric
      H+,K(+)-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase). It provides effective symptom relief
      and healing of peptic ulcer and reflux oesophagitis after 4 to 8 weeks of therapy
      and appears to prevent recurrence of lesions when administered as maintenance
      therapy. When administered at therapeutic dosages, lansoprazole produced higher
      healing rates than ranitidine or famotidine in patients with duodenal and gastric
      ulcers. Lansoprazole heals duodenal ulcers more rapidly than ranitidine or
      famotidine. Relief of ulcer symptoms in lansoprazole recipients is at least
      equivalent to, and tends to be more rapid than, that in patients receiving
      histamine H2-receptor antagonists. In comparisons with omeprazole 20 mg/day,
      lansoprazole 30 mg/day produced duodenal ulcer healing more rapidly and reduced
      ulcer pain to a greater extent at 2 weeks, but overall healing rates were similar
      after 4 weeks of therapy. At therapeutic dosages, lansoprazole produces superior 
      healing and symptom relief of reflux oesophagitis in comparison with ranitidine, 
      and it tends to relieve heartburn more effectively than omeprazole, although both
      agents produce equivalent healing. Healing of peptic ulcers or reflux
      oesophagitis refractory to histamine H2-receptor antagonists occurs after 8 weeks
      in the majority of patients treated with lansoprazole, and lansoprazole and
      omeprazole demonstrate similar efficacy in patients with refractory peptic
      ulcers. In patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, lansoprazole effectively
      controls mean basal gastric acid output. Lansoprazole is generally well tolerated
      in clinical trials. The incidence of adverse effects is similar to that of
      omeprazole, ranitidine and famotidine in comparative studies. Combination therapy
      with lansoprazole and antibacterial agents such as amoxicillin, tinidazole,
      roxithromycin and/or metronidazole appears to eradicate Helicobacter pylori in 22
      to 80% of patients with this organism. Limited data also suggest that
      lansoprazole may have superior activity against H. pylori in comparison with
      omeprazole, although the clinical relevance of this preliminary finding requires 
      further confirmation. Thus, lansoprazole may be considered as alternative to
      existing antisecretory agents available for the treatment of acid-related
      disorders, particularly because it may provide more rapid healing and relief of
      symptoms.

TI  - Improving treatment of late life depression in primary care: a randomized
      clinical trial.
PG  - 839-46
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Facilitate primary care physicians' compliance with recommended
      standards of care for late life depression by reducing barriers to recognition
      and treatment. DESIGN: Randomized controlled clinical trial of physician-targeted
      interventions. SETTING: Academic primary care group practice caring for an urban,
      medically indigent patient population. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 60
      and older who exceeded the threshold on the Centers for Epidemiologic Studies
      Depression Scale (CES-D) and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) and
      their primary care physicians. INTERVENTION: Physicians of intervention patients 
      were provided with patient-specific treatment recommendations during 3 special
      visits scheduled specifically to address the patient's symptoms of depression. In
      general, physicians were encouraged to establish a diagnosis of depression and
      educate their patient about the diagnosis, discontinue medications that can cause
      or exacerbate depressive symptoms, initiate antidepressants when appropriate, and
      consider referral to psychiatry. Guidelines for prescribing antidepressants were 
      provided. Control physicians received no intervention, and control patients
      received usual care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency of recording a depression
      diagnosis, stopping medications associated with depression, initiating
      antidepressant medication, and psychiatry referral; mean changes in HAM-D and
      Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) scores. RESULTS: One hundred three physicians and
      175 patients were involved in the clinical trial. Physicians of intervention
      patients were more likely to diagnose depression and prescribe antidepressants (P
      < 0.01). There were no differences between the groups in the frequency of
      stopping medications associated with depression or referrals to psychiatry.
      Medications with the strongest cause and effect relationship to depression were
      infrequently used in this cohort of patients. Although both groups showed
      improvement in HAM-D and SIP scores, we were unable to demonstrate significant
      differences in HAM-D or SIP scores between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Intensive
      screening and feedback of patient-specific treatment recommendations increased
      the recognition and treatment of late life depression by primary care physicians.
      However, we were unable to demonstrate significant improvement in depression or
      disability severity among intervention patients despite the informational support
      provided to their physicians. Efforts to improve the functional status of these
      patients may require more integrated interventions and more aggressive attempts
      to target psychosocial stressors traditionally outside the purview of primary
      care.

TI  - [Ondansetron versus droperidol. Postoperative treatment against nausea and
      vomiting. Comparison of action, adverse effects and acceptance by gynecologic
      inpatients].
PG  - 504-9
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ondansetron is more effective than a placebo in treating
      postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), but it has not been proved to be
      superior to established antiemetics for prophylaxis or therapy. We compared
      ondansetron vs droperidol for the treatment of PONV. METHODS: Our prospective,
      randomized double-blind study was performed between 15 October 1992 and July
      1993; it included 271 gynaecological ASA I-III inpatients who had been operated
      on under general anaesthesia with intubation. Patients were excluded if: there
      was no informed consent; it was an ambulatory or emergency operation; the patient
      was pregnant or breast feeding; allergies were being treated with antihistamines;
      drug addiction was present or convulsions or Parkinson's disease; any pre- or
      intraoperative antiemetic medication had been administered. All patients wishing 
      an antiemetic and/or suffering from at least one emetic episode during the first 
      24 h postoperatively received either 8 mg ondansetron or 1.25 mg droperidol from 
      identical 4 ml ampoules intravenously. The verbal nausea score (1 = none, 2 =
      mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe) was recorded every 30 min for 4 h, then before
      and 2 h after each antiemetic dose. All emetic episodes and the interval between 
      administration and effect were also noted. Patients were interviewed 36-48 h
      postoperatively on subjective effects, side-effects and individual acceptance.
      After oral premedication with diazepam, anaesthesia was induced with thiopental, 
      in a few cases with etomidate or propofol. Relaxation was achieved with
      pancuronium or atracurium and, when indicated, with succinylcholine. Muscular
      relaxation was antagonized with neostigmine and glycopyrrolate. Gastric content
      was aspirated once after intubation. Anaesthesia was maintained with nitrous
      oxide/oxygen, enflurane, halothane or isoflurane and fentanyl up to 0.3 mg.
      Statistical evaluation was performed by the unpaired Student's t-test and the
      Mann-Whitney U test. Categoric variables were examined by the chi 2 test.
      Significance was defined as P < 0.05. RESULTS: Of 271 patients, 100 (37%)
      experienced PONV. The groups were statistically comparable with respect to
      demographic data, type and duration of operation, emesis record, perioperative
      uterotonic medication. Twenty patients in the ondansetron group and 27 in the
      droperidol group received the first antiemetic within 2 h, the other patients up 
      to 17 h after extubation. Nausea scores and emetic episodes were identical before
      antiemetic medication. The reduction of these parameters after medication was
      similar. Complete response over 6 h was 60% in the ondansetron and 68% in the
      droperidol group. In both groups the first medication failed in 4 cases during
      the initial 2 h. Twenty of the ondansetron and 16 of the droperidol patients
      needed a second dose; among these 2 and 4, respectively, a third ampoule. No
      rescue medication was necessary over 24 h and a mean of 1.4 ampoules was
      administered in both groups. Onset and quality of emetic action were identical in
      both groups. It was not possible to evaluate 25 interviews due to linguistic or
      amnestic problems. Multiple side-effects were noted frequently. Injection pain
      was reported significantly more often in the droperidol, pruritus in the
      ondansetron group. Ninety-three percent of the ondansetron and 85% of the
      droperidol patients opted for the same drug for future PONV treatment.
      CONCLUSIONS: Ondansetron (8 mg) and droperidol (1.25 mg) proved to be equally
      effective when used as a postoperative antiemetic. Both drugs showed similar
      side-effects. Due to differences in methods it was difficult to compare our
      results to those obtained in other studies.

TI  - Pharmacological management of back pain syndromes.
PG  - 189-98
AB  - The symptom of back pain may be the result of many different pathologies. As
      such, patients with back pain require careful assessment to determine whether the
      cause is from the spine or other systems. For acute mechanical back pain,
      treatment is often symptomatic. Symptomatic treatment may include analgesics,
      anti-inflammatories and/or muscle relaxants. Patients may also need hypnotics in 
      the short term to help them sleep at night. However, drug therapy should be
      reduced and stopped as soon as possible. Furthermore, too much bedrest may be
      counterproductive. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is the standard treatment for
      transient back pain. More severe pain may require the addition of an opioid, such
      as codeine or dextropropoxyphene. Morphine and pethidine (meperidine) may be
      necessary in patients with back pain due to neoplastic disease or osteoporotic
      fracture. However, the opioid analgesics are associated with dependence,
      tolerance and adverse effects. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have
      analgesic efficacy comparable with paracetamol. Individual patients respond
      differently to different NSAIDs, and several agents may have to be tried. Long
      term therapy with NSAIDs is necessary in diseases with an inflammatory component 
      such as ankylosing spondylitis. Calcitonin reduces bone resorption and bone blood
      flow, and has been suggested to have central analgesic effects. As such, it has
      been used successfully in patients with Paget's disease, osteolytic bone disease 
      and osteoporosis. Bisphosphonates also inhibit osteoclastic bone resorption and
      may be useful in Paget's disease, osteolytic metastases and osteoporotic
      fractures. Other drugs which may be useful in relieving back pain associated with
      specific circumstances include the tricyclic antidepressants, anxiolytics,
      antiepileptic agents, corticosteroids, colchicine and chymopapain.

TI  - New anticonvulsant drugs. Focus on flunarizine, fosphenytoin, midazolam and
      stiripentol.
PG  - 153-71
AB  - In the past decade, several new antiepileptic drugs have been tested. Most
      recently, 5 new antiepileptic drugs have been launched onto European and US
      markets. These include vigabatrin, oxcarbazepine and lamotrigine in Europe, and
      felbamate and gabapentin in the US. In addition to these, 3 additional drugs are 
      in the clinical investigational stage: flunarizine, fosphenytoin and stiripentol.
      A fourth agent is midazolam, which was originally introduced in 1986, but
      recently has shown effectiveness in the treatment of status epilepticus.
      Flunarizine is a selective calcium channel blocker that has shown anticonvulsant 
      properties in both animal and human studies. It is a long-acting anticonvulsant
      that clinical studies have shown to have effects similar to those of phenytoin
      and carbamazepine in the treatment of partial, complex partial and generalised
      seizures. Fosphenytoin was developed to eliminate the poor aqueous solubility and
      irritant properties of intravenous phenytoin. It is rapidly converted to
      phenytoin after intravenous or intramuscular administration. In clinical studies,
      this prodrug showed minimal evidence of adverse events and no serious
      cardiovascular or respiratory adverse reactions. It may have a clear advantage
      over the present parenteral formulation of phenytoin. Midazolam is a
      benzodiazepine that is more potent than diazepam as a sedative, muscle relaxant
      and in its influence on electroencephalographic measures. It has been shown to be
      an effective treatment for refractory seizures in status epilepticus. Stiripentol
      has anticonvulsant properties as well as the ability to inhibit the cytochrome
      P450 system. There are significant metabolic drug interactions between
      stiripentol and phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital (phenobarbitone).
      Stiripentol has been studied in patients with partial seizures, refractory
      epilepsy and refractory absence seizures with some efficacious results.

TI  - Cladribine in treatment of chronic progressive multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 9-13
AB  - Chronic progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) is a severely disabling demyelinating
      disease in which autoimmune processes seem to have a major role. The nucleoside
      drug cladribine is a potent lympholytic agent with few side-effects. We have
      studied its efficacy and safety in a randomised double-blind trial. 51 patients
      (48 entered as matched pairs) received four monthly courses of 0.7 mg/kg
      cladribine or placebo (saline) given through a surgically implanted central line.
      Neurologists with no knowledge of which medication the patient was receiving
      examined the patients monthly and noted two rating scale scores (Kurtzke and
      Scripps). Cerebrospinal fluid and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      examinations were done at 6 and 12 months. Average neurological scores,
      demyelinated volumes on MRI, and concentrations of oligoclonal bands in
      cerebrospinal fluid were stable or improved in the patients receiving cladrabine 
      but continued to deteriorate in patients on placebo. Mean paired (placebo minus
      matched cladribine) differences at 12 months relative to baseline were 1.0 (SE
      0.4) for the Kurtzke scores, -13.9 (2.3) for the Scripps scores, 4.57 (1.17) mL
      for demyelinated volumes, and 7.3 (3.3) arbitrary units for concentrations of
      oligoclonal bands. Cladribine was generally well tolerated and clinically
      significant toxicity occurred in only 1 patient, in whom severe marrow
      suppression developed with complete recovery after several months. 1 patient died
      of newly acquired hepatitis B, an event unlikely to be related to cladribine. We 
      conclude that the immunosuppressive drug cladribine influences favourably the
      course of chronic progressive MS.

TI  - Complications of spinal opioid therapy: myoclonus, spastic muscle tone and spinal
      jerking.
PG  - 249-52
AB  - This study was made in order to define risk factors for patients requiring spinal
      opioid therapy developing painful spastic muscle tone together with myoclonus and
      spinal jerking (MSJ). The case histories of 75 patients, all receiving morphine
      spinally, were retrospectively analysed and, of these, 10 suffered from the MSJ
      syndrome. The following were taken as evaluation criteria: age, sex, performance 
      status, duration and dosage of previous systemic and current spinal morphine
      therapy, concomitant analgesic and co-analgesic medication, pretreatment of the
      dorsal column and neurological dysfunction due to damage either of the nerval
      plexus or of the medulla spinalis. As a result, high spinal morphine doses in
      conjunction with pathological changes within the spine were shown to be risk
      factors for this syndrome. Changing from spinal to systemic morphine application 
      or reduction of spinal doses together with the addition of systemic morphine led 
      to complete recovery from MSJ. As underlying mechanism, an imbalance between the 
      activity of spinal and central opioid receptors and/or toxic morphine effects on 
      the medulla spinalis are discussed. In conclusion, great care should be taken
      when applying morphine to the spine in patients with neurological dysfunction due
      to an apparent pathology of the medulla spinalis, especially if large amounts of 
      morphine are likely to be required. Some systemic application of morphine might
      reduce the risk of patients developing MSJ syndrome.

AB  - A case of viral encephalitis is described. A 55-year-old female developed
      hyperthermia and status epilepticus. Herpes simplex virus was regarded as a
      factor since viral complex titres were elevated and decreased. In addition to
      acyclovir and anticonvulsive agents, dantrolene (150 mg/day) was administered
      orally through a nasogastric tube for heat stroke. Convulsions and hyperthermia
      gradually decreased and intravenous agents were replaced by oral agents.
      Dantrolene may be a useful adjuvant in hyperthermia and convulsions associated
      with encephalitis.

TI  - Pain prevalence, severity and impact in a clinic sample of multiple sclerosis
      patients.
PG  - 89-93
AB  - Previous studies have reported variable prevalence of pain in multiple sclerosis 
      (MS) and have not documented the impact of pain on daily living. In this
      consecutive series, we report on data collected from structured interviews with
      85 patients seen within a 16-month period at a regional referral clinic. The
      prevalence of pain for the month preceding assessment was 53%. There were no
      significant differences between patients who did and those who did not report
      pain on the basis of patient demographics (age, gender) and disease
      characteristics (disease subtype, duration and neurologic symptom severity).
      Disease duration and neurologic symptom severity were significantly correlated
      with the number of hours of pain per week but were not correlated with pain
      severity, the number of pain sites or pain-related distress. There was wide
      variability in the number of pain hours/week reported with 17.6% of the sample
      reporting continuous pain for the month preceding assessment. Sixty-five percent 
      of patients with pain reported taking medications for pain and 90% of these
      patients evaluated their medication(s) as 50% effective or better. Nevertheless, 
      patients with pain reported poorer mental health and more social-role handicap.
      Discussion focuses on the need for routine assessment of pain and the
      comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of pain interventions in the
      therapeutic management of patients with MS.

TI  - Somatomedin C (insulin-like growth factor 1) levels decrease during acute changes
      of stress related hormones. Relevance for fibromyalgia.
PG  - 1332-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of stress hormones on insulin-like growth
      factor 1 (IGF-1). METHODS: Insulin induced hypoglycemia (< 3 mmol/l) and
      clonidine induced depression of noradrenergic tone were used to assess the acute 
      effects of cortisol, human growth hormone (hGH), and norepinephrine (NE).
      RESULTS: Despite the increase of hGH during hypoglycemia, a statistically
      significant decrease of IGF-1 was observed along with the expected rise of
      cortisol and NE. To eliminate the role played by NE, NE tone was depressed by
      administering clonidine. A statistically significant decrease of IGF-1 was also
      observed. CONCLUSION: Acute cortisol release or a NE decrease induce low IGF-1
      levels.

TI  - High-pressure neurological syndrome (HPNS).
PG  - 45-50
AB  - High-pressure neurological syndrome (HPNS) is a condition encountered in diving
      beyond a depth of 100 m. Manifestations include headache, tremor, myoclonus,
      neuropsychiatric disturbances and EEG changes. Convulsions are seen only in
      experimental animals. Most of the changes are reversible on surfacing but some
      such as memory disturbances may linger on for long periods. Excessive atmospheric
      pressure is the most important factor in the pathogenesis of HPNS.
      Neurotransmitter changes occur of which serotonin appears to be a more likely
      mediator because of the resemblance of HPNS to serotonin syndrome. Anesthetics
      and anticonvulsants have been used in experimental animals but are unsuitable for
      use in human divers. Breathing gas mixtures such as heliox have enabled the
      extension of depth of diving without HPNS. Use of 5-HT1A receptor antagonists may
      provide an interesting approach to prevention of HPNS.

TI  - Diphenhydramine-induced acute dystonia.
PG  - 492-6
AB  - A 45-year-old woman was administered oral and intravenous diphenhydramine 25 mg
      for the treatment of an allergic reaction. Within 2 minutes she rapidly developed
      trismus, dysarthria, tremors of the upper extremities, left-sided weakness, and
      diminished consciousness. She was treated with intravenous diazepam and
      benztropine with good response. After approximately 12 hours the patient's
      condition was completely resolved except for minor subjective weakness of her
      left extremities. Her hospital stay was uneventful, and she was discharged after 
      4 days after refusing rechallenge with the drug. Several cases of acute dystonic 
      reactions secondary to antihistamines have been reported in the literature, four 
      of which involved diphenhydramine. Such reactions may occur after short- or
      long-term therapy. Most patients experienced rapidly developing trismus, facial
      dystonia, dysarthria, and occasionally, decreases in consciousness, motor
      incoordination, and weakness. Because of the widespread availability of
      diphenhydramine and other antihistamines to the general public, awareness of this
      effect is of great importance.

TI  - Newer antiepileptic drugs. Towards an improved risk-benefit ratio.
PG  - 37-67
AB  - Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders. Even though existing
      antiepileptic drugs can render 80% of newly diagnosed patients seizure free, a
      significant number of patients have chronic intractable epilepsy causing
      disability with considerable socioeconomic implications. There is, therefore, a
      need for more potent and effective antiepileptic drugs and drugs with fewer
      adverse effects, particularly CNS effects. Drugs for the treatment of partial
      seizures are particularly needed. With major advances in our understanding of the
      basic neuropathology, neuropharmacology and neurophysiology of epilepsy, numerous
      candidate novel antiepileptic drugs have been developed in recent years. This
      review comparatively evaluates the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and adverse effects
      of 12 new antiepileptic drugs namely vigabatrin, lamotrigine, gabapentin,
      oxcarbazepine, felbamate, tiagabine, eterobarb, zonisamide, remacemide,
      stiripentol, topiramate and levetiracetam (ucb-L059). Of the 12 drugs,
      vigabatrin, lamotrigine and gabapentin have recently been marketed in the UK.
      Five of these new drugs have known mechanisms of action (vigabatrin, lamotrigine,
      tiagabine, oxcarbazepine and eterobarb), which may provide for a more rational
      approach to the treatment of epilepsy. Oxcarbazepine, remacemide and eterobarb
      are prodrugs. Vigabatrin, gabapentin and topiramate are more promising on the
      basis of their pharmacokinetic characteristics in that they are excreted mainly
      unchanged in urine and not susceptible to significant pharmacokinetic
      interactions. In contrast, lamotrigine, felbamate and stiripentol exhibit
      significant drug interactions. Essentially, all the drugs are effective in
      partial or secondarily generalised seizures and are effective to varying degrees 
      in other seizure types. Particularly welcome is the possible effectiveness of
      zonisamide in myoclonus and felbamate in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. In relation to 
      adverse effects, CNS effects are observed with all drugs, however, gabapentin,
      remacemide and levetiracetam appear to exhibit least. There is also the
      possibility of rational duotherapy, using drugs with known mechanisms of action, 
      as an additional therapeutic approach. The efficacy of these 12 antiepileptic
      drug occurs despite the fact that candidate antiepileptic drugs are evaluated
      under highly unfavourable conditions, namely as add-on therapy in patients
      refractory to drug management and with high seizure frequency. Thus, whilst
      candidate drugs which do become licensed are an advance in that they are
      effective and/or are associated with less adverse effects than currently
      available antiepileptic drugs in these patients, it is possible that these drugs 
      may exhibit even more improved risk-benefit ratios when used in normal clinical
      practice.

TI  - Zinc salts for the treatment of olfactory and gustatory symptoms in psychiatric
      patients: a case series.
PG  - 309-11
AB  - BACKGROUND: Zinc salts have been used extensively in medical settings to treat
      disorders of gustatory and olfactory function. However, zinc supplements have not
      been tested in psychiatric patients with smell or taste symptoms. METHOD: The
      authors examined the effects of zinc supplements on five consecutive patients
      with symptoms of abnormal taste and smell perception in the context of acute
      psychiatric illness or treatment. RESULTS: All five patients had complete or
      partial amelioration of these olfactory and gustatory symptoms after treatment
      with zinc sulfate or zinc gluconate, apparently independent of the improvement in
      their underlying psychiatric disorder. CONCLUSION: We recommend treating unusual 
      olfactory and gustatory symptoms with zinc salts, independent of the treatment
      for the underlying psychiatric disorder.

TI  - Omeprazole. An update of its pharmacology and therapeutic use in acid-related
      disorders.
PG  - 91-132
AB  - Omeprazole, a gastric acid pump inhibitor, dose-dependently controls gastric acid
      secretion: the drug has greater antisecretory activity than histamine H2-receptor
      antagonists. Omeprazole 20 to 40 mg/day is more effective than histamine
      H2-receptor antagonists in the short term treatment of duodenal ulcer, gastric
      ulcer and reflux oesophagitis. Available data suggest that omeprazole 10 to 40
      mg/day is also more effective than ranitidine in the maintenance therapy of
      duodenal ulcer and reflux oesophagitis. The drug is also effective in patients
      with duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer or reflux oesophagitis poorly responsive to
      histamine H2-receptor antagonists. The efficacy of omeprazole 20 mg/day appears
      to be similar to that of lansoprazole 30 mg/day in the short term treatment of
      duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer and reflux oesophagitis. However, most available
      studies have been reported in abstract form only, and 2 of 3 studies in patients 
      with duodenal ulcer have shown greater healing rates at 2 (but not 4) weeks with 
      lansoprazole. Helicobacter pylori eradication decreases duodenal ulcer relapse
      rates and appears to be associated with improved duodenal ulcer healing rates.
      Evidence also suggests that H. pylori eradication is associated with reduced
      gastric ulcer relapse rates. Omeprazole monotherapy may suppress but does not
      eradicate H. pylori infection. Eradication rates with omeprazole 20 or 40 mg
      twice daily plus amoxicillin usually up to 2 g/day (3 g/day in a few studies) for
      2 weeks appear to be similar to those of standard triple therapy (bismuth salt
      plus metronidazole, plus tetracycline or amoxicillin) or omeprazole plus
      clarithromycin, although eradication rates vary widely. Omeprazole plus
      amoxicillin appears to be better tolerated than triple therapy and represents a
      first-line treatment alternative in patients with H. pylori-associated peptic
      ulcer disease. Omeprazole plus amoxicillin plus metronidazole appears to be more 
      effective than omeprazole plus amoxicillin in patients with
      metronidazole-sensitive H. pylori infection. Omeprazole remains a treatment of
      choice in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. The dosages should be
      adjusted according to individual response. However, relatively low dosages of 10 
      to 40 mg/day may be sufficient in some patients. The drug has also shown promise 
      in the treatment of children with severe reflux oesophagitis, in patients with
      reflux oesophagitis and coexisting systemic sclerosis, and in the prevention of
      aspiration pneumonia. Evidence suggests that omeprazole is more effective than
      ranitidine in patients with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced
      gastric damage who continue to take NSAIDs, especially in patients with large
      gastric ulcers; however, completion of ongoing studies is required to verify
      this.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

TI  - Symptomatic therapy of multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 229-33
AB  - Despite decades of aggressive research into the cause and cure of multiple
      sclerosis (MS), a direct management strategy remains lacking. As research
      continues, patients who strive for an improved quality of life may attain it
      through the improved management of symptoms. Symptoms occur in MS as a
      consequence of loss of myelin (primary symptoms), as the result of primary
      symptoms (secondary symptoms), and because of psychological dysfunction
      associated with MS (tertiary symptoms). This paper emphasizes the recent
      developments in the management of primary symptoms including visual loss,
      weakness, spasticity, urinary and sexual dysfunction, and fatigue. The adjective 
      multiple emphasizes the numerous potential symptoms of MS. It is through their
      management that people with MS may lead happier, more productive lives until a
      cause and cure are found.

TI  - Pain management for children following selective dorsal rhizotomy.
PG  - 492-6
AB  - Selective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR) is a neurosurgical procedure used for treating
      lower extremity spasticity in patients with cerebral palsy. The purpose of this
      paper is to present a review of our institution's first three years' experience
      with postoperative pain and spasticity management in patients who have undergone 
      SDR. The medical records of the 55 patients who had an SDR during the study
      period were reviewed. The basis of postoperative analgesia was morphine, with the
      majority of patients receiving continuous morphine infusions (20-40
      micrograms.kg-1.hr-1 (n = 49), 60 micrograms.kg-1.hr-1 (n = 1)). Four patients
      used a patient-controlled delivery system. One patient had successful analgesia
      with epidural morphine. Ketorolac (1 mg.kg-1 i.v. loading dose followed by 0.5
      mg.kg-1 i.v. every six hr for 48 hr) was used as an adjunct to morphine in six
      patients. For management of postoperative muscle spasm, an intravenous
      benzodiazepine was used (diazepam 0.1 mg.kg-1 (n = 2), or midazolam infusion
      10-30 micrograms.kg-1.hr-1 (n = 51)). All patients were cared for on a ward where
      nurses were familiar with the use of continuous opioid and benzodiazepine
      infusions. All patients received continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring as well 
      as frequent nursing assessment. There were no episodes of postoperative apnoea or
      excessive sedation. We have found the use of continuous infusions of morphine and
      midazolam, along with adjunct ketorolac, to be effective in treating
      postoperative pain and muscle spasms following SDR.

TI  - Total intravenous anesthesia using propofol and alfentanil for coronary artery
      bypass surgery.
PG  - 284-8
AB  - Total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) using alfentanil and propofol was used in 10 
      patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. In an attempt to diminish
      unwanted side effects, lower doses were chosen than if either drug had been used 
      alone. Anesthesia was induced with alfentanil, 75 micrograms/kg, followed by a
      sleep dose of propofol (mean dose 0.5 mg/kg). Maintenance in the
      precardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) period was achieved by infusions of propofol (6
      mg/kg/h) and alfentanil (100 micrograms/kg/h). These were decreased by two thirds
      on commencement of CPB, and increased to half the initial rate on rewarming to 32
      degrees C. Additional boluses of alfentanil were used to control breakthrough
      hypertension. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) and left ventricular stroke work
      index (LVSWI) fell significantly on induction. MAP but not LVSWI returned to
      baseline levels at skin incision. The cardiac index (CI) was maintained. A degree
      of myocardial depression was suggested by a fall in LVSWI despite maintaining
      preload, and by the failure of CI to increase in the presence of a reduced SVR.
      Anesthesia was satisfactory in all but one patient who developed breakthrough
      hypertension on sternotomy with transient ST segment depression, and awareness
      after CPB despite a plasma alfentanil concentration of 450 ng/mL. Mean time to
      wakening was 55 minutes. The study indicated that TIVA using propofol and
      alfentanil in the dosages described provides satisfactory basal anesthesia for
      coronary artery bypass surgery in patients with good left ventricular function,
      but requires additional pharmacologic manipulation, particularly with boluses of 
      alfentanil, to control breakthrough hypertension.

TI  - Neuroimmunotherapy: a practical approach to the treatment of immune-mediated
      neurologic diseases.
PG  - 97-105
AB  - Immunosuppressive drugs and immunomodulating procedures can improve the quality
      of life in patients with immune-related neurologic diseases, or even be life
      saving, if properly used to avoid deleterious or irreversible adverse effects.
      For the successful use of these drugs or procedures, the treating physician must 
      be familiar and comfortable with the drugs' mode of action and consider some
      important principles: 1. The diagnosis must be secure before starting therapy. 2.
      It is essential to have a basic understanding of the immunologic dysfunction that
      is amenable to immunotherapy. 3. The goals and the expectations of therapy must
      be defined, and the risk/benefit ratio of the drugs or procedures must be well
      understood. 4. Improvement must be based on objective measurements of muscle
      strength and a beneficial change in activities of daily living, and not solely on
      a change in the laboratory test values. 5. The limitations of therapy and the
      time suitable for starting or stopping a drug should be clear to both the
      therapist and the patient. 6. The selection of a drug or procedure should be
      guided on the basis of current knowledge, preferably established in controlled
      trials. 7. Every effort must be made to prevent the development of adverse
      effects and to determine the lowest dose of a medication that controls the
      disease. 8. Drug interactions that can cause adverse effects and conditions that 
      can worsen a disease must be avoided.

      uncomplicated falciparum malaria.
PG  - 47-53
AB  - The combination of mefloquine plus tetracycline was compared with quinine plus
      tetracycline in a randomised therapeutic trial in 102 patients with acute
      uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Thailand. Quinine plus tetracycline is
      considered the standard treatment for the highly drug-resistant strains of P.
      falciparum found in this area. Fifty patients received mefloquine (750 mg given
      immediately, followed by 500 mg 6 h later) with tetracycline and 52 patients
      received quinine (600 mg every 8 h for seven days) with tetracycline.
      Tetracycline was administered to both groups in doses of 250 mg four times daily.
      All patients were admitted to the hospital for 28 days to exclude re-infection.
      Ninety-three patients completed the study; nine patients left prior to completion
      of follow-up for reasons unrelated to their treatment. Cure rates for the two
      groups were 94% (44/47) for mefloquine plus tetracycline and 98% (45/46) for
      quinine plus tetracycline. Parasite and fever clearance times were shorter for
      the group treated with mefloquine but the differences were not statistically
      significant. Nearly all patients (94%) treated with quinine developed cinchonism 
      compared with only 12% treated with mefloquine; all other symptoms following
      treatment were similar. Thirteen patients (26%) treated with quinine also
      developed delayed primary attacks of P. vivax during the follow-up period; none
      developed in the patients treated with mefloquine. These results support the
      contention that the combination of mefloquine plus tetracycline is equally
      effective and less toxic than quinine plus tetracycline for treatment of acute
      uncomplicated falciparum malaria in areas requiring combination therapy for drug 
      resistance.

TI  - Tacrine: first drug approved for Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 744-51
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacology, biopharmaceutics/pharmacokinetics,
      clinical efficacy, adverse effects, and therapeutic considerations regarding the 
      use of tacrine in patients with Alzheimer's disease. DATA SOURCES: Data from the 
      scientific and professional literature were analyzed, interpreted, and
      summarized. Citations were obtained by performing a MEDLINE search using the
      following indexing terms: tacrine, tetrahydroaminoacridine, and Alzheimer's drug 
      therapy. Data also were obtained from a summary of the New Drug Application
      (Summary Basis of Approval of Cognex) and from the approved product labeling.
      STUDY SELECTION: Studies in Alzheimer's disease have been plagued by methodologic
      inconsistencies and deficiencies. Only efficacy studies subsequent to the Food
      and Drug Administration's (FDA) issuance of recommendations for studies in
      Alzheimer's disease (1991) were used. Therefore, only double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, parallel design studies of at least three-month's duration
      using the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale and the
      Clinical Interview-Based Impression of Change as efficacy parameters were
      included. DATA EXTRACTION: Trials were assessed according to the criteria listed 
      above. Results were evaluated on the basis of both completed patients and last
      observation carried forward models. DATA SYNTHESIS: Tacrine is a cholinesterase
      inhibitor that increases the availability of acetylcholine in muscarinic neurons.
      It has a mean bioavailability after oral administration of about 17 percent and
      an elimination half-life of approximately three hours. Although drug interactions
      are poorly studied, tacrine is metabolized by isoenzyme P-450IA2 and may interact
      with other drugs metabolized by this isoenzyme. Tacrine has been shown to have
      efficacy in mildly to moderately impaired Alzheimer's patients on both
      psychometric testing and a clinician's structured interview. Although
      efficacious, its effects are not dramatic, and it does not affect the ultimate
      course of the disease. Adverse effects are frequent, and significantly elevated
      hepatic transaminase concentrations may occur in approximately 25 percent of
      patients. CONCLUSIONS: Tacrine is the first drug approved by the FDA for
      treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Although it may improve psychometric test
      scores in mild to moderately impaired patients, it is not a panacea and does not 
      affect the course of the disease. Patients must be monitored closely for elevated
      transaminase, cholinergic adverse effects, and interactions with drugs
      metabolized through P-450IA2.

TI  - Imipramine in patients with chest pain despite normal coronary angiograms.
PG  - 1411-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ten to 30 percent of patients undergoing cardiac catheterization
      because of chest pain are found to have normal coronary angiograms. Because these
      patients may have a visceral pain syndrome unrelated to myocardial ischemia, we
      investigated whether drugs that are useful in chronic pain syndromes might also
      be beneficial in such patients. METHODS: Sixty consecutive patients underwent
      cardiac, esophageal, psychiatric, and pain-sensitivity testing and then
      participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled three-week trial
      of clonidine at a dose of 0.1 mg twice daily (20 patients), imipramine at a dose 
      of 50 mg nightly with a morning placebo (20 patients), or placebo twice daily (20
      patients); this treatment phase was compared with an identical period of
      twice-daily placebo for all patients (placebo phase). RESULTS: Thirteen (22
      percent) of the 60 patients had ischemic-appearing electrocardiographic responses
      to exercise, 22 of the 54 tested (41 percent) had abnormal esophageal motility,
      38 of 60 (63 percent) had one or more psychiatric disorders, and 52 of 60 (87
      percent) had their characteristic chest pain provoked by right ventricular
      electrical stimulation or intracoronary infusion of adenosine. During the
      treatment phase, the imipramine group had a mean (+/- SD) reduction of 52 +/- 25 
      percent in episodes of chest pain, the clonidine group had a reduction of 39 +/- 
      51 percent, and the placebo group a reduction of 1 +/- 86 percent, all as
      compared with the placebo phase of the trial. Only the improvement with
      imipramine was statistically significant (P = 0.03). Repeat assessment of
      sensitivity to cardiac pain while the patients were receiving treatment showed
      significant improvement only in the imipramine group (P = 0.01). The response to 
      imipramine did not depend on the results of cardiac, esophageal, or psychiatric
      testing at base line, or on the change in the psychiatric profile during the
      course of the study, which generally improved in all three study groups.
      CONCLUSIONS: Imipramine improved the symptoms of patients with chest pain and
      normal coronary angiograms, possibly through a visceral analgesic effect.

TI  - Muscle cramping in phase I clinical trials of tirapazamine (SR 4233) with and
      without radiation.
PG  - 379-82
AB  - PURPOSE: Tirapazamine (SR 4233) is a benzotriazine di-N-oxide which acts as a
      hypoxic cytotoxic agent and as a radiation enhancer when given shortly before or 
      after radiation. Three Phase I clinical trials were designed to determine the
      maximum tolerated dose, toxicities, pharmacokinetics, and effects on irradiated
      tumors and normal tissues. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Tirapazamine 9 mg/m2 to 21
      mg/m2 was given i.v. 1/2 to 1 h prior to irradiation on a multiple dose schedule 
      of 10 consecutive doses. This was later revised to a three times-per-week
      schedule for 12 doses. In a second clinical trial, tirapazamine was given in a
      single dose of 18 mg/m2 to 293 mg/m2 i.v. after irradiation. In a third trial,
      tirapazamine was administered without irradiation in single doses of 36 mg/m2 to 
      250 mg/m2, with an option for retreatment. RESULTS: Subjects reported muscle
      cramping of varying degrees of severity on all three dose schedules. One patient 
      experienced Grade 3 cramping and treatment was discontinued. The most frequent
      site of cramping were the lower extremities. Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values 
      were elevated in three patients with associated muscle soreness in one patient.
      MB (cardiac) isoenzymes were elevated in one patient with no evidence of cardiac 
      muscle damage, and returned to baseline at drug completion. No consistent
      abnormalities in clinical laboratory values were found. Stretching of the muscle 
      was most effective in relieving the cramping. CONCLUSION: Muscle cramping has
      been the most frequently reported toxicity in Phase I studies of tirapazamine,
      though it does not appear to be dose limiting. Dose escalation on the three
      clinical trials continues. In vitro studies to investigate the cramping are
      ongoing.

TI  - Delayed diagnosis of subdural hematoma following normal computed tomography scan.
PG  - 1127-31
AB  - We report the cases of three patients with subdural hematoma following minor
      closed-head trauma in whom the initial neurologic examinations and cranial
      computed tomography (CT) scans were normal. In each case, the patient was
      re-evaluated clinically several times (average of four times) due to persistence 
      of post-traumatic symptoms. The development of focal neurologic signs, which
      eventually led to a correct diagnosis, was significantly delayed in all three
      cases (average of 47 days). All three patients had large subdural hematomas
      requiring surgical drainage. The timely diagnosis of subdural hematoma may be
      difficult despite the appropriate use of CT scan in the immediate post-traumatic 
      period. Repeat CT scan may be indicated in patients suffering minor head trauma
      with persistent symptoms. These patients seem to recover without deficit
      following neurosurgical treatment despite a significant delay in diagnosis.

TI  - Chronic baclofen therapy improves the blunted growth hormone response to
      intravenous arginine in subjects with spinal cord injury.
PG  - 1135-8
AB  - Human GH (hGH) secretion is stimulated by vigorous physical activity, whereas
      immobilization reduces its release. In paralyzed subjects with spinal cord injury
      (SCI), it has recently been shown that the release of hGH to provocative
      stimulation and plasma insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels are reduced.
      The acute administration of baclofen, a gamma-aminobutyric acid derivative, has
      been shown to stimulate hGH release. The present study investigated the effect of
      chronic administration of baclofen on the provocative testing of hGH secretion
      and plasma IGF-I levels. Sixteen subjects with SCI were studied; eight subjects
      were treated (40-80 mg/day; > 6 months) with baclofen (Bac+), and eight were not 
      (Bac-). Additionally, 8 non-SCI subjects were studied as controls. The groups
      were matched for gender and age. The subjects were not receiving any medications 
      known to influence hGH secretion. After an overnight fast, arginine hydrochloride
      (30 g/subject) was infused iv over 30 min, with blood drawn for hormone
      determinations at baseline and 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. In the Bac- group
      compared with the Bac+ group, the arginine-stimulated mean plasma hGH levels at
      30 and 60 min (P < 0.05) and peak and sum plasma hGH levels (P < 0.01) were
      reduced. There were no significant differences in the plasma hGH response between
      the Bac+ group and the control group. Plasma IGF-I levels may reflect the
      integrated tissue response to hGH. A significant inverse relationship was present
      between age and plasma IGF-I levels for the control and Bac+ groups, but not for 
      the Bac- group. The mean plasma IGF-I level was significantly reduced in the Bac-
      compared with the Bac+ group. No significant differences in mean plasma IGF-I
      levels were noted between the Bac+ and control groups. SCI is associated with
      body composition changes and metabolic alterations that may be exacerbated by
      reduced activity of the hGH-IGF-I axis. Oral chronic baclofen therapy appears to 
      reverse the deleterious effects of paralysis and immobilization on hGH
      physiology.

TI  - Study of the sensitivity of the diabetes-induced pain model in rats to a range of
      analgesics.
PG  - 153-60
AB  - The streptozocin-induced diabetic rat has been put forward as a model of chronic 
      pain with signs of hyperalgesia and allodynia that may reflect signs observed in 
      diabetic humans. The aim of this work was to assess, in streptozocin-induced
      diabetic rats, the pharmacological activity to several analgesic drugs known to
      be effective (clomipramine, amitriptyline, desipramine, clonidine, lidocaine),
      ineffective (aspirin), or with a doubtful effectiveness (morphine) in human
      painful diabetic neuropathy. The animals were submitted to a mechanical pain test
      (paw pressure) and the ability of the drugs to reverse diabetes-induced
      hyperalgesia was tested. The tested antidepressants (0.125-8 mg/kg, i.v.) were
      slightly effective in diabetic rats; amitriptyline and clomipramine induced a
      weak effect, whereas desipramine was more active, suggesting noradrenergic
      specificity. This was confirmed by the effectiveness of clonidine (50, 100, 150
      micrograms/kg, s.c.). Lidocaine (1-9 mg/kg, i.v.) had prolonged efficacy on
      mechanical hyperalgesia. Aspirin (100 mg/kg, i.v.) was without effect and
      morphine (0.5-4 mg/kg, i.v.) induced a dose-dependent antinociceptive effect but 
      at doses twice as high as those used in normal rats. These results demonstrate
      the high pharmacological predictivity of this model of painful diabetes and
      suggest that in this pathological condition, among the drugs acting on
      monoaminergic transmission, noradrenergic drugs seem the most active.

TI  - Post-traumatic hyperthermia in acute brain injury rehabilitation.
PG  - 335-43
AB  - Fever frequently presents during recovery from traumatic brain injury (TBI).
      Elevated body temperature may result from ensuing infection, thrombophlebitis,
      drug reaction, or a defect in the central thermoregulatory system such as seen in
      post-traumatic hyperthermia (PTH). Typically, the diagnosis of PTH follows only
      after thorough investigation. Literature supports the theory that the febrile TBI
      patient, lacking a documented source, has central hyperthermia. The purpose of
      this study was to determine the incidence of PTH in the acute rehabilitation
      setting. We reviewed a consecutive series of 84 TBI patients participating in a
      rehabilitation programme. Four per cent of the patients in this study met our
      criteria for PTH. We describe a fever protocol that should aid the physician in
      diagnosis and treatment of the febrile TBI patient. Proposed mechanisms involved 
      in thermoregulation are discussed.

TI  - Pleural effusion associated with chronic dantrolene administration.
PG  - 587-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report a case of pleural effusion associated with chronic
      dantrolene administration. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: Private,
      university-affiliated, teaching hospital. RESULTS: Twelve years after the
      initiation of low-dose dantrolene therapy for chronic spasticity, a 35-year-old
      man developed a pleural effusion with pleural and peripheral eosinophilia. This
      reaction gradually resolved over several months after discontinuation of the
      dantrolene therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In patients treated with chronic dantrolene
      therapy, the presence of pleural effusions should raise the suspicion of
      dantrolene-induced disease. Withdrawal of dantrolene therapy has generally been
      associated with an alleviation of signs and symptoms within several months.

TI  - A risk-benefit assessment of vigabatrin in the treatment of neurological
      disorders.
PG  - 395-405
AB  - Vigabatrin was designed to increase the levels of the inhibitory neurotransmitter
      gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain. It does this by replacing GABA as a 
      substrate for the action of the catabolic enzyme GABA-transaminase. As a result
      of this inhibition, neuronal GABA levels are elevated, resulting in enhanced
      endogenous GABA transmission. A number of clinical trials assessing the effect of
      vigabatrin in epilepsy have been completed. Vigabatrin is of proven benefit in
      partial seizures and secondarily generalised tonic clonic seizures, and it is
      licensed for use as adjunctive therapy in these conditions in several European
      countries. It has been shown to be effective in some epilepsy syndromes in
      children including West's syndrome, infantile spasms and cryptogenic partial
      seizures. Its effect on primary generalised tonic clonic seizures is variable,
      while there is considerable evidence that it has a deleterious effect on
      myoclonic and absence seizures. There have been a few reports of the benefits of 
      vigabatrin in other neurological disorders including tardive dyskinesia,
      degenerative ataxias and GABA metabolism disorders. The adverse effects
      associated with vigabatrin are similar to those seen with other anticonvulsants, 
      with a predominance of CNS effects including somnolence, fatigue, irritability,
      dizziness and headache. Psychiatric symptoms including depression and psychosis
      are seen in a small number of patients and cause the most problems. These often
      necessitate discontinuation of vigabatrin, which usually results in resolution of
      symptoms.

AB  - In order to evaluate further the efficacy of local intramuscular injections of
      botulinum-A toxin (BAT-A) in the management of dynamic equinus deformity
      associated with cerebral palsy, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      study was undertaken. When evaluated using our Physician Rating Scale, 83% (five 
      of six) of patients receiving toxin showed improvement, versus 33% (two of six)
      receiving placebo. There were no major complications. BAT-A injections appear to 
      be safe and effective in children, and merit further prospective study.

TI  - Buspirone's efficacy in organic-induced aggression.
PG  - 126-30
AB  - The objectives of this study were to (1) identify and characterize hospitalized
      patients with an organic-related psychiatric diagnosis who had received buspirone
      therapy and (2) assess the effect of buspirone on aggressive behaviors. A
      retrospective medical records review was conducted on all patients who were
      admitted to our psychiatric/rehabilitation facility over a 36-month period and
      who had received buspirone therapy. Monthly behavioral therapy records were used 
      to determine the quality and quantity of aggressive-related behaviors. Study
      endpoint was reached in each subject when buspirone was discontinued or when
      records were unavailable. Twenty subjects, ranging in age from 15 to 55 years old
      (mu = 26.1 +/- 9.8), were identified for study. Nine (90%) of 10 subjects for
      whom data were available for at least 3 months showed an improvement in behavior 
      by study endpoint, and 6 (60%) showed at least a 50% reduction in behavioral
      symptoms by study endpoint. Results from this study suggest that buspirone is
      well tolerated and may be effective in the treatment of aggressive and other
      maladaptive behaviors in individuals with an organic component to their
      psychiatric illness, particularly traumatic brain injury. Prospective, controlled
      trials are needed to validate these findings.

TI  - Pathophysiology of pain.
PG  - 375-83
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the pain pathways in the central and peripheral nervous
      system and the actions of drugs used to treat pain. DESIGN: An overview of pain
      pathways is presented, beginning in the periphery and progressing centrally, and 
      the ascending and descending pathways are described in detail. RESULTS: The
      nociceptive pathway, consisting of the classic three-neuron chain, is now
      understood to be a dual system at each level, and the sensation of pain is
      thought to arrive in the central nervous system with the discriminative component
      of pain ("first pain") carried separately from the affective-motivational
      component of pain ("second pain"). In addition to spinal control mechanisms of
      nociceptive transmission, descending pathways that originate in three major
      areas--the cortex, thalamus, and brain stem--can modify functions at the spinal
      level. At every level of the nervous system, a close relationship prevails
      between somatic pain pathways and visceral pathways. This relationship likely
      accounts for the transmission of visceral pain and also for autonomic responses
      to somatic pain and somatic responses to visceral pain. CONCLUSION: By
      understanding the pathways of pain and the transmitters involved, prevention and 
      treatment of pain will be improved.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of amitriptylinoxide in the treatment of chronic
      tension-type headache: a multi-centre controlled study.
PG  - 149-55
AB  - Amitriptyline is the medication of first choice in the treatment of chronic
      tension-type headache. In 197 patients with chronic tension-type headache (87M
      and 110F with a mean age of 38 +/- 13 (18-68)) efficacy and tolerability of 60-90
      mg amitriptylinoxide (AO) were compared with 50-75 mg amitriptyline (AM) and
      placebo (PL) in a double-blind, parallel-group trial consisting of a four weeks' 
      baseline phase and 12 weeks of treatment. The primary study endpoint was a
      reduction of at least 50% of the product of headache duration and frequency and a
      reduction of at least 50% in headache intensity. Statistics used were Fisher's
      exact test and analysis of variance. No significant difference emerged between
      AO, AM and PL with respect to the primary study endpoint. Treatment response
      occurred in 30.3% of the AO, 22.4% of the AM and 21.9% of the PL group. A
      reduction in headache duration and frequency of at least 50% was found in 39.4%
      on AO, in 25.4% on AM and in 26.6% on PL (PAO-PL = .1384, PAM-PL = 1.000, PAO-AM 
      = .0973). A reduction in headache intensity of at least 50% was found in 31.8% on
      AO, in 26.9% on AM and in 26.6% on PL (PAO-PL = .5657, PAM-PL = 1.000, PAO-AM =
      .5715). Trend analysis with respect to a significant reduction of headache
      intensity (p < 0.05) and the product of headache duration and frequency revealed 
      a superior effect of AO.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Mechanisms of tizanidine action on spasticity.
PG  - 274-9
AB  - This investigation estimated the mechanisms of tizanidine action on spasticity
      using a battery of neurophysiological methods. Thirty patients with old
      post-stroke spastic hemiparesis took part in the investigation. They were treated
      with tizanidine-mean daily dose 15.8 +/- 5.6 mg for a mean of 23.3 +/- 4.8 days. 
      A questionnaire for assessment of subjective improvement after treatment used a
      5-point scale. For standardization of the neurological examination 5-point scales
      were used to assess muscle tone, muscle force and tendon reflexes. A battery of
      neurophysiological methods was used to analyze different mechanisms of
      spasticity: for alpha motoneuron excitability--the F wave parameters; for
      presynaptic inhibition--the ratio of H reflex amplitudes before and after
      vibration of the achilles tendon (Hvibr/Hmax); for common interneuron
      activity--the flexor reflex parameters. Our results revealed that tizanidine
      reduces spastically increased muscle tone, but has no influence on muscle force, 
      tendon reflexes, Babinski sign and ankle clonus. Tizanidine is supposed to act by
      increasing the presynaptic inhibition and decreasing of alpha motoneuron
      excitability. When spasticity has decreased presynaptic inhibition and increased 
      motoneuron excitability, it is better to treat with tizanidine.

TI  - Hyperbaric oxygen therapy: implications for spinal cord injury patients with

PG  - 281-4
AB  - A patient with a cervical spinal cord injury receiving intrathecal baclofen for
      spasticity control underwent a 7 week course of hyperbaric oxygen therapy to
      induce healing of an ischial decubitus ulcer. After completion of this treatment 
      and during a routine baclofen infusion pump refill, the actual pump reservoir
      volume exceeded computer measurements obtained with telemetry. Examination of the
      physiology of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in relation to infusion pump function
      revealed that the intraspinal pressures attained during hyperbaric oxygen therapy
      produced retrograde leakage of cerebrospinal fluid into the infusion pump
      reservoir.

TI  - Adverse effects and drug interactions of clinical importance with antiviral
      drugs.
PG  - 281-91
AB  - Most antiviral drugs are nucleoside analogues with potential teratogenic,
      embryotoxic, carcinogenic and antiproliferative activities. They must be
      administered with caution during pregnancy, because some are known teratogens
      (e.g. amantadine) and a similar propensity cannot be entirely excluded for others
      (e.g. aciclovir). Their adverse effects mostly involve bone marrow depression
      (e.g. granulocytopenia with ganciclovir, anaemia with zidovudine) or
      neurotoxicity (e.g. seizures with interferon-alpha, peripheral neuropathy with
      zalcitabine), although gastrointestinal effects are also seen. Idiosyncratic
      reactions include didanosine-induced acute pancreatitis. Only inosine pranobex is
      largely free from toxicity. Idoxuridine must be administered topically, given the
      severity of its systemic adverse effects. Drug interactions involving antiviral
      agents mostly reflect shared toxicity with other agents (e.g. neutropenia with
      ganciclovir and zidovudine, pancreatitis with didanosine and alcohol), although
      renal excretion or hepatic metabolism may be implicated. Given the possibility of
      severe adverse reactions and drug interactions, antiviral chemotherapy should
      only be used for potentially serious virus infections. Topical administration
      avoids systemic adverse effects but not mutagenic risks, and may result in
      exposure of individuals other than the patient (e.g. aerosolised ribavirin).

TI  - [Fluoxetin combined with cyclobenzaprine in the treatment of fibromyalgia].
PG  - 97-100
AB  - The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of fluoxetin associated
      with cyclobenzaprine vs cyclobenzaprine in the treatment of fibromyalgia.
      Twenty-one females with fibromyalgia were randomly assigned to 2 groups: group A 
      (11 patients) was treated over 12 weeks with fluoxetin (20 mg/die) and
      cyclobenzaprine (10 mg/die), group B with cyclobenzaprine (10 mg/die). Basally
      and after 12 weeks patient self-assessment of pain, number of painful tender
      points, tender points index and morning stiffness were evaluated. The study has
      shown a significant improvement of the examined parameters in both treatment
      groups; however the comparison between the two groups showed a greater
      effectiveness, statistically significant, of the treatment with Fluoxetin
      associated with cyclobenzaprine.

TI  - Fibromyalgia associated with female urethral syndrome.
PG  - 88-9
AB  - Thirty-eight out of 212 patients (18%) with fibromyalgia met the criteria for the
      definition of female urethral syndrome (FUS). None of the patients from the
      control group met these criteria. The treatment for FUS was the same as that for 
      fibromyalgia: cyclobenzaprine or diazepam and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs with a partial response in both pathologies. We should consider FUS in the 
      evaluation of every patient with fibromyalgia.

TI  - Lamotrigine in treatment of 120 children with epilepsy.
PG  - 359-67
AB  - One hundred twenty children aged 10 months to 16 years 9 months were included in 
      three studies with lamotrigine (LTG): a single-blind study (n = 60), a
      pharmacokinetic study (n = 23), and a compassionate group (n = 37). At 3 months, 
      11 patients had become seizure-free and 34 had > 50% decrease in seizure
      frequency. The best results involved absence epilepsy, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome
      (LGS), and other symptomatic generalized epilepsy. Forty-two patients were
      followed > 1 year, 22 for a mean of 2.2 years, and there was no significant
      increase in seizure frequency as compared with 3-month follow-up. Fourteen
      patients became seizure-free for > 6 months; all except 1 had generalized
      epilepsy. For 12 patients, treatment could be reduced to monotherapy, but for
      those with valproate (VPA) comedication LTG dosage had to be increased; 25% of
      patients with VPA monotherapy exhibited skin rash, appearing 3-18 days after
      starting LTG. For 4 patients, LTG could be reintroduced after VPA was withdrawn. 
      Ten patients had ataxia and/or drowsiness and 2 had vomiting. For all other
      patients, tolerance was excellent.

TI  - New findings and symptomatic treatment for neurolathyrism, a motor neuron disease
      occurring in north west Bangladesh.
PG  - 193-5
AB  - Neurolathyrism is a form of spastic paraparesis caused by the neuroexcitatory
      amino acid 3-N-oxalyl-L-2,3-diaminopropanoic acid (beta-ODAP) present in the
      seeds and foliage of Lathyrus sativus. The disease is irreversible and usually
      nonprogressive. Tolperisone HCl, a centrally acting muscle relaxant, has been
      shown to reduce significantly the spasticity in neurolathyrism patients. Sporadic
      occurrence of HTLV-1 infection (0.9%) and of osteolathyrism was found among the
      neurolathyrism patients. Osteolathyrism is linked to the consumption of the green
      shoots of Lathyrus sativus.

AB  - A 65-year-old man presented with progressive, severe lower back pain, obstructive

      laboratory studies included an elevated creatinine, erythrocyte sedimentation
      rate, and prostate specific antigen level. A chest radiograph displayed multiple 
      nodules and a renal ultrasound demonstrated unilateral hydronephrosis. Biopsies
      of both the prostate and the lung showed necrotizing granulomas consistent with
      Wegener's granulomatosis, and the patient had positive cytoplasmic antineutrophil
      cytoplasmic antibodies. He was treated with cyclophosphamide with resolution of
      all signs and symptoms, and clearing of his radiograph. Our case represents the
      rare occurrence of Wegener's granulomatosis presenting as prostatitis and
      ureteral obstruction.

TI  - Emergencies in palliative care.
PG  - 186-90
AB  - Five groups of events are here considered as emergencies in palliative care:
      haemorrhage, convulsions, fractures, spinal cord compression and acute confusion.
      Incidence, causes and management of these form the major part of this article.
      Emergencies in palliative care also include sudden severe exacerbation of
      symptoms. Therefore, onset of severe pain, exacerbation of breathlessness, and
      worsening of other symptoms are also discussed with their appropriate treatment. 
      A small armamentarium of appropriate medications is thus shown to cover treatment
      of the various emergencies that may arise. As palliative care deals with patients
      who are suffering from progressive fatal conditions, death is the expected end.
      Nevertheless, however well the family are prepared, death often appears for them 
      as an emergency. Comment is made regarding this family emergency in the care of
      terminally ill people. Attention in this article is focussed on medical
      treatment. In the care of the emergency event, however, and in all palliative
      care, management includes making the patient comfortable, thinking of the needs
      of other patients and relatives observing the event, explaining what is happening
      and is being done, involving other members of the team, and communicating
      reassurance to the patient and the relatives as well as to other observers.

TI  - Effects of osteopathic manipulative treatment in patients with cervicothoracic
      pain: pilot study using thermography.
PG  - 135-41
AB  - To provide information on how cervicothoracic pain responds to osteopathic
      manipulative treatment, five subjects with acute or chronic pain received
      appropriate medication and three osteopathic manipulative treatments by the
      principal investigator using thrust and nonthrust techniques. The mean number of 
      findings by both investigators on structural examination decreased considerably
      immediately after each of the three treatments. The number of findings increased 
      in week 2 and decreased in week 3. The principal investigator observed a further 
      decrease by the final session, but the coinvestigator reported an increase. The
      pain scale score improved an average of nearly 30%. Thermography showed cooling
      of the cervicothoracic region in all subjects and conversion to a normal pattern 
      in four. Osteopathic manipulative treatment should be considered for patients
      with acute or chronic cervicothoracic pain. The use of thermographic analysis in 
      clinical osteopathic research seems warranted.

TI  - Antimalarial agents and lupus.
PG  - 243-63
AB  - Antimalarials are under-utilized, disease-modifying agents that are useful in the
      management of lupus erythematosus. Antimalarials can promote a remission in
      non-organ-threatening lupus and decrease its risk of dissemination. They are
      especially useful for cutaneous and inflammatory joint disease and have modest
      actions in improving serositis, fatigue, and cognitive dysfunction. As agents
      that do not depress the bone marrow or promote opportunistic infections,
      antimalarials have potential applications in combination with other antilupus
      medications and with each other.

TI  - A case of narcotic bowel syndrome successfully treated with clonidine.
PG  - 138-40
AB  - Patients with chronic abdominal pain without an organic basis present a difficult
      management problem. Some of these patients may be prescribed opiates initially
      which may result in requiring progressively higher doses for pain relief. In this
      clinical setting, the suspicion of narcotic bowel syndrome should be borne in
      mind. With appropriate treatment and counselling, further invasive investigations
      including laparotomy may be avoided and resolution of symptoms can be achieved
      with clonidine. This case report demonstrates such a typical clinical scenario
      and discusses the possible aetiology and pathophysiology of narcotic bowel
      syndrome as well as the role of clonidine in controlling opiate withdrawal
      symptoms.

TI  - Epileptic seizures associated with intrathecal baclofen application.
PG  - 25-7
AB  - We report the clinical and EEG findings in three patients presenting with
      seizures associated with intrathecal baclofen application for treatment of
      spasticity. All patients had a history of traumatic brain injury, while one
      patient also suffered a spinal cord injury. Two patients experienced their first 
      seizure following intrathecal baclofen test bolus injection. Another patient had 
      convulsions on two occasions: following postoperative baclofen dose adjustment,
      and after sleep deprivation. Structural brain disease seems prerequisite for
      baclofen to exert epileptogenic activity, since seizures have not occurred in
      patients receiving intrathecal baclofen for spasticity of solely spinal origin.
      Antiepileptic medication permitted the continuation of intrathecal baclofen
      treatment in the three patients.

TI  - Headache, thrombolytic therapy, and chronic subdural hemorrhage--a case report.
PG  - 77-80
AB  - Subdural hematomas are well known but infrequent complications of thrombolytic
      therapy. Although these are usually associated with head trauma, the authors
      describe a case of a patient who received a particularly aggressive thrombolytic 
      regimen and presented six months later with complaints of nothing more than a
      headache resistant to medical therapy, without associated neurologic
      manifestations, which was finally diagnosed as a chronic subdural hematoma by
      computerized tomography. In the era of thrombolysis, physicians should maintain a
      heightened index of suspicion for subdural hematoma in patients complaining of
      headache.

TI  - Involuntary tonic spasms of a limb due to a brain stem lacunar infarction.
PG  - 217-9
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although repetitive involuntary movements are a
      well-recognized manifestation of carotid occlusive disease, similar movements
      have not been reported with a lacunar infarction outside of the basal ganglia or 
      subthalamic nucleus. We describe a man with tonic spasms associated with a
      lacunar infarction in the right ventral pons. CASE DESCRIPTION: Involuntary tonic
      spasms of a paretic limb developed acutely in a 69-year-old hypertensive man with
      a clinical presentation of pure motor hemiparesis. Magnetic resonance imaging
      demonstrated a lacunar infarction of the ventral pons. There was no evidence for 
      carotid occlusive disease. An electroencephalogram recorded during the movements 
      showed no abnormality. The abnormal movements responded well to treatment with
      oral diazepam. CONCLUSIONS: A brain stem lacunar infarction may be associated
      with involuntary tonic limb spasms clinically similar to those reported as
      paroxysmal symptoms of multiple sclerosis.

TI  - Idiopathic generalized myokymia.
PG  - 42-51
AB  - Idiopathic generalized myokymia (IGM) is a rare, heterogeneous, and poorly
      understood syndrome. We present analysis of 75 reported cases in the world
      literature. IGM affects men and women equally, with a mean age of onset 29 +/- 19
      years. Patients' common presenting complaints are stiffness (60%), cramps (12%), 
      weakness (12%), and muscle twitching (4%). Family history is positive in 30%. In 
      addition to generalized clinical myokymia (92%), abnormal neurologic findings
      include: hyporeflexia (70%), weakness (45%), grip myotonia (39%), and calf
      hypertrophy (16%). Electrical activity consisting of spontaneous continuous motor
      unit activity and/or electrical myokymia was documented in all patients. When
      electrical myokymia was observed (66%), the grouped discharges where irregular
      and had an interburst frequency of 2-300 Hz. Both phenytoin and carbamazepine are
      effective treatments. We conclude that IGM has a wide spectrum of symptoms and
      severity and should be considered in all patients that present with stiffness,
      cramps, or muscle twitching. EMG greatly aids in diagnosis.

      periodic symptomatology in the first 2 years of life, and who on later evaluation
      were determined to have juvenile migraine. The commonest early expression
      consisted of vomiting, accompanied by behavioral change. Seven of 13 showed some 
      indication of headache. Other symptoms such as sleep relief, pallor, and vertigo 
      or ataxia were relatively common. A family history of migraine, primarily
      maternal, was found in 11 of 12 patients in whom it could be evaluated.

      therapeutic considerations.
PG  - 22-30
AB  - Glutaric aciduria type I (GA-I) is an inborn error in the degradation of lysine, 
      hydroxylysine, and tryptophan due to a deficiency of glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase. 
      Glutaric, 3-OH-glutaric, and glutaconic acids are excreted in the urine,
      particularly during intercurrent illness. The enzyme may be assayed in
      leukocytes, cultured fibroblasts and chorionic villi. Twelve new cases, 9
      months-16 years of age, are reported, comprising all known cases of GA-I in
      Sweden and Norway. Ten had a severe dystonic-dyskinetic disorder, one had a mild 
      hyperkinetic disorder, and one was asymptomatic. Two children died in a state of 
      hyperthermia. Carnitine deficiency and malnutrition developed in patients with
      severe dystonia and dysphagia, which necessitated substitution and gastrostomy. A
      slowly progressive dyskinetic disorder developed in spite of adequate early
      dietary treatment in one subject. Macrocephaly was found in three. Computed
      tomography and magnetic resonance investigations in 10 showed deep bitemporal
      spaces in 7. Neuropsychological testing of 8 of 12 subjects demonstrated
      receptive language function to be superior to expressive language and motor
      function. Cognitive functions were obviously less affected than motor functions. 
      A review of 57 pooled cases showed that a severe dystonic syndrome developed in
      77%, a mild extrapyramidal syndrome in 10%, and 12% were asymptomatic. This
      disorder may pass undetected in the cerebral palsy and mentally retarded child
      and adult populations. Repeated urine examinations of organic acids in the urine 
      and enzyme assay may be necessary to confirm GA-I.

TI  - Intrathecal baclofen application in patients with supraspinal spasticity
      secondary to severe traumatic brain injury.
PG  - 29-34
AB  - Intrathecal application of baclofen is considered the treatment of choice in
      patients suffering from spinal spasticity insufficiently responding to
      conventional oral antispastic medication. This approach has also been used
      successfully in cases with spasticity of supraspinal origin. To achieve a good
      therapeutic response in the latter condition the amount of intrathecal baclofen
      has to be approximately twice the dosage required in spinal spasticity. We report
      on 8 patients suffering from supraspinal spasticity due to severe traumatic brain
      injury. Intrathecal baclofen reduced spasticity in all patients (mean Ashworth
      Score from 3.9 to 1.6; mean Reflex Score from 4.0 to 1.4). In some cases
      improvement of motor performance and in one case recovery of bladder function
      were noted. In two patients focal epileptic seizures with secondary
      generalization seemed to be associated with the application of baclofen. The
      local intrathecal application of baclofen has proven to be an effective therapy
      in otherwise intractable cases of severe supraspinal spasticity.

      antidiencephalon immune serum (Serolab, Lausanne, Switzerland), in 36 women, aged
      24-56 years, with primary fibromyalgia are presented. Treatment was ambulatory
      and consisted of either SER282 (20 mg/ml) or amitryptiline (AMI, 50 mg) or
      placebo (PL) over an 8-week treatment course. Clinical and sleep EEG polygraphic 
      data were obtained at baseline and after 4 and/or 8 weeks of therapy. Compared to
      an important PL response and moderate analgesia with AMI, pain and associated
      symptoms improved moderately with SER282. In contrast, polysomnographic
      recordings showed that SER282 tended to promote stage 4 sleep, while AMI and PL
      had few--if any--effect on sleep. These results are discussed together with the
      clinical characteristics of the patients and the relations between pain,
      associated symptoms, and sleep parameters in our patient population.

TI  - Neurotoxicity of NMDA receptor antagonists: an overview.
PG  - 533-40
AB  - The glutamate transmitter system provides several benevolent/malevolent
      paradoxes. Glutamate itself serves vitally important functions in the CNS but has
      enormous neurodestructive potential. NMDA glutamate receptor antagonists protect 
      many neurons against glutamate neurotoxicity, while injuring or destroying
      certain other neurons and inducing psychotic symptoms and memory impairment.
      Therefore, the challenge in developing protective therapies against glutamate's
      neurodestructive potential is to find benevolent agents that are not malevolent
      as well. There are two possible approaches. One is to develop neuroprotective
      agents that are free from neuropsychopathological side effects; the other is to
      use NMDA antagonists even though they have neuropsychopathological side effects, 
      but to use them in combination with other agents that block the side effects
      without producing side effects of their own.

TI  - Psychopharmacology of disorders in children.
PG  - 779-91
AB  - Several features of pediatric pharmacology applied to psychiatry were mentioned
      throughout this review. The use of medications in young children requires
      attention to nuances of informed consent because of limited data and many
      potentially beneficial, possibly safer medications that are not approved for
      children. Children more rapidly metabolize and eliminate medications. They differ
      in sensitivity to main effects and side effects of a variety of medications.
      Therefore, it is important to start low and aim for the lowest effective dose.
      Ultimate doses may be higher, split and frequent doses may be necessary, and both
      clinical and laboratory follow-up may need to be more frequent. Finally,
      childhood onset of psychiatric disorders, similar to pediatric experience with
      diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis, frequently confers devastating stress and
      chronicity. The child's physician shares the frustration of poor treatment
      response or responses that cannot be sustained in a developing, dependent
      organism with a more aggressive variant of a disorder and an inevitably longer
      course. Despite a heartening increase in pediatric psychopharmacology interest
      and knowledge, much remains to be learned.

      postoperative nausea and vomiting in gynaecological patients.
PG  - 1155-61
AB  - The effect of a single intravenous dose of ondansetron in preventing
      postoperative nausea and emesis (retching and vomiting) (PONV) was investigated
      in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, international
      study. Women of ASA class I-III, requiring gynaecological laparotomy, vaginal
      hysterectomy, or major vaginal surgery were selected for study. Two hundred and
      thirty-five received placebo, 231 received 1 mg ondansetron, 228 received 8 mg
      ondansetron and 229 received 16 mg ondansetron, as an infusion over five minutes 
      before the induction of anaesthesia. A standardized balanced anaesthetic
      technique was employed. This consisted of premedication with either diazepam or
      temazepam, thiopentone induction, maintenance with nitrous oxide in oxygen
      supplemented with enflurane or isoflurane, intraoperative analgesia with
      fentanyl, neuromuscular blockade with any choice of agent and reversal with
      neostigmine and atropine. Postoperative analgesia was achieved with morphine, and
      prochlorperazine or metoclopramide were given if a rescue antiemetic was
      required. A greater percentage of patients in the 8 mg and 16 mg ondansetron
      groups experienced no postoperative emesis (44% and 39% respectively) than in the
      placebo and 1 mg ondansetron groups (29% and 28% respectively) for the first 24
      hr postoperative period (8 mg vs placebo and 1 mg: P < or = 0.001; 16 mg vs
      placebo: P < 0.05; 16 mg vs 1 mg: P < 0.05). Similarly, the percentage of
      patients who did not experience postoperative nausea were 20%, 26%, 31% and 28%
      for the placebo, 1 mg, 8 mg and 16 mg ondansetron treatment groups, respectively 
      (8 mg and 16 mg vs placebo P < 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Epidural clonidine treatment for refractory reflex sympathetic dystrophy.
PG  - 1163-9; discussion 27A
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intraspinally administered alpha 2-adrenergic agonists may relieve
      pain in sympathetically maintained pain (SMP) syndromes, such as reflex
      sympathetically dystrophy (RSD), by spinal, peripheral, and central nervous
      system actions. This study examined analgesic efficacy and side effects of
      epidurally administered clonidine in patients with severe, refractory RSD.
      METHODS: Twenty-six patients with severe chronic pain consistent with RSD were
      studied in a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled design. Cervical or lumbar
      epidural catheters were inserted for patients with upper or lower extremity RSD, 
      respectively, and patients received, in random order on three consecutive days,
      epidural injection of clonidine, 300 or 700 micrograms, or placebo. Pain (by
      visual analog score (VAS) and McGill Pain Questionnaire), sedation, blood
      pressure, and heart rate were monitored at specified intervals for 6 h after
      injection. Patients who responded to clonidine, but not placebo, then entered a
      trial of open-label, continuous epidural infusion of clonidine (10-50
      micrograms/h). RESULTS: Clonidine, but not placebo, caused pain relief, sedation,
      and decreased blood pressure and heart rate after bolus epidural injection. The
      smaller clonidine dose (300 micrograms), produced pain relief and decreases in
      blood pressure and heart rate similar to those of the 700 micrograms dose, but
      with less sedation. Epidural clonidine was infused for a mean of 43 days in 19
      patients at a mean rate of 32 micrograms/h for sustained analgesia. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Transdermal clonidine has been demonstrated to produce analgesia in the area
      surrounding its application site in patients with SMP. The current study
      indicates that extensive analgesia may be obtained by epidural administration.
      Sedation and hypotension may limit bolus epidural clonidine administration for
      RSD. The role for chronic epidural infusion of clonidine has not yet been
      established.

TI  - Intractable hiccups and sleep apnea syndrome in multiple sclerosis: report of two
      cases.
PG  - 401-5
AB  - Two cases of multiple sclerosis associated with intractable hiccups (IH) and
      sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) are reported. Lesions were detected in the tegmentum
      of the medulla oblongata by magnetic resonance imaging. In one case, high dose
      methylprednisolone was remarkably effective for the IH. For the SAS,
      amitriptyline was effective in one case. The IH and SAS are thought to be
      important symptoms when a lesion occurs in the tegmentum of the medulla
      oblongata, including the paramedian and lateral reticular formations. If IH
      appears in conjunction with a lesion in the tegmentum of the medulla oblongata,
      one must be vigilant for the development of SAS.

PG  - 1057-60
AB  - There are increasing numbers of patients admitted to hospital as a result of
      ingesting amphetamine-like drugs. The most severe cases exhibit hyperthermia,
      rhabdomyolysis, coagulopathy and renal failure. We describe six such patients
      with varying severity of intoxication, and have reviewed the recent literature
      with particular reference to the use of dantrolene. One of our patients died but 
      the others all survived. There is little evidence that dantrolene influenced the 
      outcome in patients reported to date. We believe that a controlled trial should
      be carried out in amphetamine-related hyperthermia before the use of dantrolene
      becomes widespread.

TI  - Place of newer antiepileptic drugs in the treatment of epilepsy.
PG  - 1009-24
AB  - There are several new antiepileptic drugs undergoing extensive clinical
      investigation. Five new drugs--vigabatrin, lamotrigine, gabapentin, felbamate and
      oxcarbazepine--appear to be the most widely tested and promising agents.
      Vigabatrin is most effective in drug-resistant partial epilepsy. Vigabatrin is
      also effective in infantile spasms, but seems to have negative effects on
      myoclonic epilepsies and absence seizures. Lamotrigine and felbamate seem to be
      effective in partial epilepsy and in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. In addition,
      lamotrigine and felbamate seem to have efficacy in idiopathic generalised
      epilepsies. Oxcarbazepine appears to be equally as effective as carbamazepine,
      but less toxic. Gabapentin has few adverse effects and has efficacy in some
      patients with drug-resistant partial epilepsy. Some of the new antiepileptic
      drugs modify excitatory or inhibitory amino acid transmission, but some of them
      may employ new, still unknown mechanisms of action. Depending on the mechanism of
      action, the therapeutic effectiveness of the antiepileptic drugs may differ in
      specific epileptic syndromes. Future antiepileptic drugs may thus give us the
      possibility to design rational polypharmacy for individual patients by combining 
      agents with different spectra of effectiveness. Considering the goal of good
      tolerability in the development of the new antiepileptic drugs, polypharmacy with
      these agents is not expected to increase adverse effects significantly.

TI  - Reducing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Current perspectives and
      future possibilities.
PG  - 410-28
AB  - Nausea and vomiting are among the most distressing adverse effects of cancer
      chemotherapy. In the last 10 years considerable advances in the prevention of
      chemotherapy-induced emesis have been made. From an analysis of the results
      obtained in patients receiving moderately- to severely-emetogenic drugs the
      following guidelines in choosing the best antiemetic treatment can be given: 1.
      For the prevention of acute emesis induced by a high single dose of cisplatin (> 
      or = 50 mg/m2) or by low doses (20 to 40 mg/m2) repeated for 4 to 5 days, the
      combination of ondansetron plus dexamethasone is the most efficacious and least
      toxic antiemetic therapy. 2. For the prevention of delayed emesis the combination
      of oral dexamethasone plus metoclopramide seems to offer the best protection,
      although over 40% of patients still experience delayed nausea and vomiting. 3.
      For the prevention of acute emesis induced by moderately emetogenic drugs,
      corticosteroids (dexamethasone or methylprednisolone) are efficacious and safe
      antiemetic agents. Although equally efficacious, the serotonin (5-HT)3 receptor
      antagonists, due to their higher acquisition costs, are indicated only in
      patients refractory to corticosteroids or in those who cannot use them.
      Unresolved problems in antiemetic research include: (i) identification of the
      best antiemetic treatment for those areas of cancer chemotherapy where adequate
      data are lacking, such as high dose regimens for bone marrow transplantation;
      (ii) optimisation of treatment for the most widely used chemotherapy regimens;
      and (iii) identification of the best rescue treatment for patients who fail to
      respond to antiemetic prophylaxis. Although many new 5-HT3 antagonists are
      currently being studied, the possible improvement in efficacy and tolerability
      brought about by these agents will probably only be marginal.

TI  - Continuous spinal anesthesia for cancer and chronic pain.
PG  - 406-13
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The use of spinal opioids for intractable pain is
      limited by development of tolerance and opioid resistance of some types of pain. 
      METHODS: The literature regarding clinical experience with spinal mu opioid
      agonists for chronic and cancer pain was reviewed. Experimental use of
      intrathecal non-mu opioid agonists and non-opioid agonists and antagonists was
      also reviewed. RESULTS: Intrathecal mu agonists, particularly morphine, are
      effective for most patients with cancer pain, though in some patients rapid
      tolerance or marked resistance develop. Varied results are seen among chronic
      pain patients. Delta opioid agonists and a variety of non-opioid agonist
      analgesics are effective in standard analgesic testing paradigms, and some agents
      are effective in clinical trials. NMDA and NK-1 receptor antagonists are
      effective in models that produce sensitization of spinal dorsal horn neurons.
      CONCLUSIONS: A number of new agents appear to have promise as intrathecal drugs
      for patients with intractable chronic and cancer pain.

TI  - Case of Isaacs syndrome successfully treated with phenytoin.
PG  - 1010-2
AB  - We herein report on an 18-year-old Taiwanese man who developed acute onset of
      generalized continuous contractions of the muscles. The involuntary cramps caused
      a dystonic posture of the neck and limbs. Opisthotonos was noted when the cramps 
      were exacerbated. The cramps were painful and sensitive to movement, so the
      patient limited movement of his body. External stimulation, such as a pin prick
      or a loud noise, would aggravate them. The contractions of the muscles persisted 
      during sleep. No other neurologic abnormalities were noted. Electromyography
      showed spontaneous continuous muscle fiber activity. The symptoms did not respond
      to baclofen or diazepam; however, remarkable improvement was noted after giving
      phenytoin. The clinical presentation, electromyographic findings, and the
      patient's beneficial response to phenytoin fulfilled the diagnostic
      characteristics of Isaacs syndrome.

TI  - Headaches and women: treatment of the pregnant and lactating migraineur.
PG  - 533-40
AB  - Migraine is a hormonally sensitive episodic headache disorder which may worsen
      during the first trimester, but usually improves during later pregnancy. Its
      treatment can be difficult because of the risks of injury to the fetus and
      newborn. These risks include teratogenicity, embryo mortality, fetal growth
      abnormalities, and perinatal effect. This paper reviews the effects of drugs on
      the fetus and newborn, their FDA classification, and their use during both
      pregnancy and lactation. Specific recommendations are given.

TI  - Chronic pain in the spinal cord injured: statistical approach and pharmacological
      treatment.
PG  - 722-9
AB  - We include in this article the results of a postal inquiry into chronic pain in
      SCI patients in Valencia (Spain), and our experience with their management. A
      mailed questionnaire including lesion and chronic pain data was sent to all of
      the 380 SCI patients who live in the region of Valencia. We received 202 answers,
      with 145 questionnaires being accurately answered and these were analysed for
      this study. The results show that chronic pain (that is, lasting more than 6
      months) is very common (65.5%). The most frequent type was deafferentation pain
      (phantom pain), described as burning or a painful numbness. Since 1988 we have
      been treating a sample of 33 patients suffering from resistant pain according to 
      the following therapies: 1 amitriptyline + clonazepam+NSAID (nonsteroidal
      antiinflammatory drugs); 2 amitriptyline + clonazepam + 5-OH-tryptophane + TENS
      (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation); 3 amitriptyline + clonazepam + SCS
      (spinal cord stimulation); 4 morphine, by continuous intrathecal infusion. After 
      almost 4 years using these therapies we can affirm that the results regarding
      analgesia reached 80% in all cases, and that morphine used by intrathecal route
      is very safe and useful in selected patients.

TI  - The clinical pharmacology of the new antiepileptic drugs.
PG  - 89-106
AB  - Conventional anticonvulsants have important limitations in terms of efficacy and 
      tolerability, and there is a clear need for new agents to be developed. After a
      quiescent period which lasted for more than two decades, several promising new
      compounds have undergone clinical evaluation and a few of these (vigabatrin,
      lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, zonisamide) are now commercially available in some
      countries. Some of the new agents represent structural analogues of pre-existing 
      drugs in an attempt to improve the therapeutic index of the latter (e.g.,
      oxcarbazepine), while others were rationally designed to interfere selectively
      with inhibitory (vigabatrin) or excitatory (NMDA receptor antagonists)
      neurotransmission in the brain. Many other compounds were discovered more or less
      serependitiously and their mode of action is poorly understood. The present
      article provides a concise review of the clinical pharmacology of the new
      anticonvulsants which have undergone most extensive clinical testing in patients 
      with epilepsy. Topics discussed include clinical pharmacokinetics, drug
      interactions, efficacy data in selected epileptic syndromes or seizure types, and
      adverse effects profile. Although the precise role of these new agents in the
      overall management of epilepsy remains to be clearly defined, their availability 
      already provides a valuable tool which can be usefully exploited to improve
      prognosis, especially in patients with the more severe forms of the disease.

TI  - [The randomized double-blind study of postoperative tonsillectomy pain control by
      muscle relaxants].
PG  - 355-63
AB  - Tonsillectomy is accompanied by 7 to 14 days of pain. We entered 36 patients into
      a double blind placebo controlled study with dantrolene sodium, lioresal to
      evaluate modification of tonsillectomy pain and analgesic requirements after
      tonsillectomy. Patients were randomly assigned either dantrolene or lioresal or
      placebo orally four times a day for 5 days postoperatively. On a standardized
      questionnaire the patients recorded pain, activity level, analgesic requirements 
      and side effects. We conclude that there is no significant differences in
      subjective pain or analgesic requirements between 3 groups. The muscle spasm is
      not the only factor of tonsillectomy pain. There is the association of other
      factors: nerve endings, individual sensitivity, local products of inflammation.
      In conclusion to control tonsillectomy pain we must use drugs with different
      action.

TI  - Conceptual and practical issues in the pharmacological treatment of brain injury.
PG  - 227-37
AB  - It is only within the last ten years that research on treatment for central
      nervous system (CNS) recovery after injury has become more focused on the
      complexities involved in promoting recovery from brain injury when the CNS is
      viewed as an integrated and dynamic system. There have been major advances in
      research in recovery over the last decade, including new information on the
      mechanics and genetics of metabolism and chemical activity, the definition of
      excitotoxic effects and the discovery that the brain itself secretes complex
      proteins, peptides and hormones which are capable of directly stimulating the
      repair of damaged neurons or blocking some of the degenerative processes caused
      by the injury cascade. Many of these agents, plus other nontoxic naturally
      occurring substances, are being tested as treatment for brain injury. Further
      work is needed to determine appropriate combinations of treatments and optimum
      times of administration with respect to the time course of the CNS disorder. In
      order to understand the mechanisms that mediate traumatic brain injury and
      repair, there must be a merging of findings from neurochemical studies with data 
      from intensive behavioral testing.

      injury.
PG  - 175-92
AB  - Investigations in laboratory animals indicate that certain drugs that influence
      specific neurotransmitters can have profound effects on the recovery process.
      Even small doses of some drugs given after brain injury facilitate recovery while
      others are harmful. Preliminary clinical studies suggest that the same drugs that
      enhance recovery in laboratory animals (e.g., amphetamine) may have similar
      effects in humans after stroke. In addition, some of the drugs that impair
      recovery of function after focal brain injury in laboratory animals (e.g.
      haloperidol, benzodiazepines, clonidine, prazosin, phenytoin) are commonly given 
      to stroke patients for coincident medical problems and may interfere with
      functional recovery in humans. Until the impact of pharmacologic agents on the
      recovering brain is better understood, the available data suggest that care
      should be exercised in the selection of drugs used in the treatment of the
      recovering stroke patient. Pharmacologic enhancement of recovery after focal
      brain injury may be possible in humans.

PG  - 457-61
AB  - This study aimed to assess and compare the effects of urapidil and clonidine on
      right ventricular volumes and function in 20 physical status ASA III patients,
      with a borderline untreated essential hypertension and with or without chronic
      coronary artery disease. The patients were randomly assigned to two equal groups 
      to receive either urapidil (0.4 mg.kg-1) or clonidine (2.5 micrograms.kg-1).
      Neither patient had congestive heart failure, valvular heart disease, previous
      myocardial infarction, nor was any being treated with beta-blocking agents or
      with amiodarone. Usual anti-anginal medication (nifedipine and isosorbide) was
      maintained up to the time of the procedure. Monitoring was obtained from ECG,
      Swan-Ganz catheter fitted out with a fast response-thermistor, and radial artery 
      cannula. Blood samples were withdrawn for plasma atrial natriuretic factor
      determination. Thirty minutes after catheter insertion, baseline data were
      collected in supine and 45 degrees head-up tilt positions. Following urapidil or 
      clonidine i.v. injection, three series of measurements (3, 8 and 13 min) were
      made in supine and tilt positions according to a randomized sequence. The two
      groups were similar with regard to age, weight, height, coronary artery disease
      and treatment. Urapidil and clonidine elicited a similar decrease in mean
      arterial pressure of 14% in supine position and 20% in head-up tilt position,
      combined with an exclusive decrease in systolic index i.e. not associated with a 
      change in peripheral vascular resistances. Despite the decrease in arterial
      pressure, heart rate remained unchanged. Right ventricular ejection fraction was 
      maintained after both urapidil and clonidine, however end-diastolic and
      end-systolic volumes decreased, with no modification by tilting.(ABSTRACT

TI  - Advances in neuropathic pain: diagnosis, mechanisms, and treatment
      recommendations.
PG  - 1524-34
AB  - Chronic neuropathic pain, caused by lesions in the peripheral or central nervous 
      system, comes in many forms. We describe current approaches to the diagnosis and 
      assessment of neuropathic pain and discuss the results of recent research on its 
      pathophysiologic mechanisms. Randomized controlled clinical trials of gabapentin,
      the 5% lidocaine patch, opioid analgesics, tramadol hydrochloride, and tricyclic 
      antidepressants provide an evidence-based approach to the treatment of
      neuropathic pain, and specific recommendations are presented for use of these
      medications. Continued progress in basic and clinical research on the
      pathophysiologic mechanisms of neuropathic pain may make it possible to predict
      effective treatments for individual patients by application of a pain
      mechanism-based approach.

PG  - 1091-113, x
AB  - For many years, women have sought alternative therapies for menopausal symptoms
      and for general health overall. The highly publicized findings from the Women's
      Health Initiative have led to an increased pressure on the medical community to
      find safe and alternative medications for female health. This article reviews the
      challenges and problems with the use of alternative medicines, and the clinical
      trials that prove their efficacy, and discusses the safety issues that may occur 
      with these types of products.

AB  - Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is the fourth most common psychiatric
      disorder. Yet patients often avoid seeking help because they are ashamed.
      Diagnosis is difficult, but familiarity with the nature of OCD and its current
      management helps primary care physicians identify patients with OCD and make
      informed judgments about treatment and referral. We review common symptoms,
      causes, drug therapy, behavioral therapy, and quality of life issues in patients 
      with OCD.

TI  - Paroxetine: new indication. In generalised anxiety: uncertain efficacy.
PG  - 175-7
AB  - (1) Generalised anxiety is defined as overwhelming anxiety lasting at least 6
      months. (2) Psychological treatment should be tried first. When the patient fails
      to cope the first-line drug is a benzodiazepine such as diazepam, prescribed for 
      a short period. (3) In France, generalised anxiety has now been added to the
      licensed indications of paroxetine, a "selective" serotonin reuptake inhibitor
      antidepressant. Two placebo-controlled trials lasting 8 weeks showed a moderate
      improvement on the Hamilton anxiety score. Another trial showed no significant
      difference between the paroxetine and placebo groups. The clinical relevance of
      this improvement is unclear, however, and the trials suffered from methodological
      biases. Paroxetine has not been reliably compared with benzodiazepines,
      psychotherapy or buspirone in patients with generalised anxiety. (4) One trial
      showed 11% relapse in the paroxetine group and 40% in the placebo group during
      the 6 months following paroxetine withdrawal, among patients who had initially
      responded; once again, however, methodological flaws undermine these data. (5)
      The adverse effect profile of paroxetine in generalised anxiety is similar to its
      profile in other patients: in particular potentially serious drug interactions
      and withdrawal symptoms when treatment is stopped abruptly. (6) In practice, the 
      standard drug therapy for generalised anxiety is a benzodiazepine such as
      diazepam. Paroxetine, whose clinical efficacy remains to be established in this
      setting, offers no tangible therapeutic advance.

TI  - Pharmacological treatment of acute ischemic stroke.
PG  - 276-82
AB  - Ischemic stroke is devastating. It is the third leading cause of death in the
      United States. Each year, 480,000 people fall victim to ischemic stroke, which is
      estimated to cost 71.8 billion dollars (Hinkle JL, Bowman L. J Neurol Nurs.
      2003;35:1-8. New treatment is available. Acute ischemic stroke is no longer
      considered an accident resulting in damage that must simply be dealt with. Now
      termed a brain attack, like a heart attack it must be treated immediately.
      Education is key to improving outcomes. Health care professionals must be trained
      to recognize early signs and symptoms of stroke. The public must be educated to
      understand the urgency of early evaluation once symptoms of stroke occur Brown M.
      Clin Med. 2001; 1:60-65). Television commercials, billboards, and public health
      lectures can be advantageous in a campaign to educate about stroke and the need
      to seek help immediately when experiencing symptoms, to halt the ischemic damage

TI  - Low-dose methadone has an analgesic effect in neuropathic pain: a double-blind
      randomized controlled crossover trial.
PG  - 576-87
AB  - The analgesic effectiveness and adverse effect incidence of a daily dose of 10 or
      20 mg of oral methadone were evaluated in 18 patients with a diverse range of
      chronic neuropathic pain syndromes, who had all responded poorly to traditional
      analgesic regimens. Analgesia was seen after each dose of methadone. As compared 
      with placebo, the 20 mg daily dose (given as 10 mg bd) resulted in statistically 
      significant (P = 0.013-0.020) improvements in patient Visual Analogue Scale
      ratings of maximum pain intensity, average pain intensity and pain relief,
      recorded at the same time daily. The analgesic effects extended over 48 hours, as
      shown by statistically significant (P = 0.013-0.020) improvements in all three
      outcomes on the rest days instituted between each daily dose. Analgesic effects
      (lowered maximum pain intensity and increased pain relief, on the day of dosing
      only) were also seen when the lower daily dose of 10 mg methadone (given as 5 mg 
      bd) was used, but these failed to reach statistical significance (P = 0.064 and
      0.065, respectively). Interpatient analysis showed that the analgesic effects
      were not restricted to any particular type of neuropathic pain. Patient
      compliance was high throughout the trial. One patient withdrew during the 10 mg
      and six during the 20 mg methadone treatment periods. This is the first
      double-blind randomized controlled trial to demonstrate that methadone has an
      analgesic effect in neuropathic pain.

TI  - Effect of treatment of carotid artery stenosis on blood pressure: a comparison of
      hemodynamic disturbances after carotid endarterectomy and endovascular treatment.
PG  - 2576-81
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Carotid intervention by carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or
      endovascular treatment may cause hemodynamic change. The immediate and long-term 
      effects on blood pressure after these procedures were assessed. METHODS: Patients
      were randomized to CEA (n=49) or endovascular treatment (n=55) that comprised
      percutaneous transluminal angioplasty alone (n=31), balloon-expandable stent
      (n=13), or self-expandable stent (n=11). A baseline 24-hour ambulatory blood
      pressure recording was made before carotid intervention and repeated at 24 hours,
      1 month, and 6 months after the procedure. RESULTS: In the first 24 hours after
      the procedure, episodes of hypotension occurred in 75% of the CEA group and 76%
      of the endovascular group; hypertension occurred in 11% and 13%, respectively.
      There was a significant fall in blood pressure at 1 hour after the procedure in
      both groups (24 and 16 mm Hg fall in CEA and endovascular groups, respectively), 
      but this was only sustained in the endovascular group. The pattern of blood
      pressure response in the first 24 hours was significantly different (P<0.0001,
      ANCOVA). Systolic blood pressure was significantly lower at 1 and 6 months only
      in the surgical group (6 and 5 mm Hg fall, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Both CEA
      and endovascular treatment have an effect on blood pressure stability,
      particularly within the first 24 hours after the procedure.

TI  - Time course of the effect of a bolus dose of intrathecal baclofen on severe
      cerebral spasticity.
PG  - 1195-200
AB  - Continuous intrathecal administration of baclofen with implanted programmable
      pump systems is recommended in the treatment of severe spasticity of cerebral
      origin. Prior to pump implantation, a baclofen bolus test (BBT) is used to assess
      the effectiveness of intrathecal baclofen using clinical scales such as the
      Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS). In the literature, the time and period of maximum 
      effect of a bolus dose of intrathecally administered baclofen in patients with
      cerebral spasticity is variously reported. The aim of the study was, therefore,
      to reveal the time course of the effect of a BBT on severe cerebral spasticity by
      the use of a recently described spasticity measurement method. Spasticity in knee
      joints of 13 patients with severe cerebral spasticity was repeatedly assessed
      using the MAS and also continuously recorded by the measurement of force under
      circular fibreglass casts. Force was recorded as nettorque by multiplying the
      force by the distance between sensor and joint axis, thus allowing
      inter-individual comparison. Half-hour time integrals (TI) of net-torque were
      determined 9 hours before and 22 hours after intrathecal baclofen administration.
      Post-BBT half-hour time integrals (TI(+0), TI(+0.5), to TI(+22)) were compared
      with the mean of 17 pre-BBT half-hour time integrals. Significantly lower
      post-BBT half-hour time integrals compared with were found between TI(+2) and
      TI(+8) (Dunnett adjusted p < 0.05). The median lowest TI after BBT of the 13
      patients was TI(+4). The lowest mean MAS scores were found 4 hours after BBT. The
      findings suggest that the greatest effect of BBT on cerebral spasticity occurs
      between 2 and 8.5 hours, with a maximal effect at 4 hours after intrathecal
      baclofen injection. Clinical scales used to determine the effect of BBT should
      thus be carried out during this period-ideally at 4 hours after baclofen
      injection.

TI  - Spinal cord injury and use of botulinum toxin in reducing spasticity.
PG  - 901-10
AB  - Spasticity is commonly seen after spinal cord injury, and a large percentage of
      patients with spinal cord injury will need treatment to control it. Although oral
      medications do a fair job of controlling spasticity in most patients, some
      patients will need additional forms of treatment. In many cases, oral medications
      alone do not adequately control spasticity or the patient cannot tolerate the
      side effects. In these instances, botulinum toxin may help control the spasticity
      for approximately 3 months after injection. The amount of botulinum toxin and the
      injection sites can be tailored to meet individual patient needs. Botulinum
      toxins can reduce spasticity, improve function, and reduce the amount of needed
      assistance.

TI  - Intrathecal clonidine and severe hypotension after cardiopulmonary bypass.
PG  - 1251-3
AB  - The use of intrathecal clonidine as an adjunct for the management of chronic
      pain, intra- and postoperative analgesia is gaining an increase in popularity.
      However, antinociceptive doses of intrathecal clonidine may produce pronounced
      hemodynamic side effects, including hypotension and bradycardia. In this report, 
      we present a case of severe hypotension after cardiopulmonary bypass in a patient
      with intrathecal clonidine infusion. We postulate that the intrathecally
      administered alpha 2-agonist clonidine reduced our patient's ability to tolerate 
      the hemodynamic lability that is present during the separation from
      cardiopulmonary bypass by potentially inhibiting sympathetic nervous system
      activity, renin-angiotensin system, or vasopressin release. The authors report a 
      case of severe hypotension after cardiopulmonary bypass in a patient receiving
      intrathecal clonidine infusion for chronic neuropathic pain.

TI  - Attenuation of cerebellar tremor with implantation of an intrathecal baclofen
      pump: the role of gamma-aminobutyric acidergic pathways. Case report.
PG  - 768-71
AB  - The authors present the case of a 49-year-old woman with disabling bilateral
      upper-extremity cerebellar tremor that resolved unexpectedly after placement of
      an intrathecal baclofen pump for lower-extremity spasticity. The tremor amplitude
      decreased nearly linearly with increasing intrathecal baclofen dosage, and
      disappeared completely at a dose of 250 microg/day. In this report the authors
      demonstrate the role of the gamma-aminobutyric acidergic system in the
      pathogenesis of cerebellar tremor, and these findings may lead to a new treatment
      modality for patients disabled by this manifestation of their disease.

TI  - Substance abuse in adolescents: a complex conundrum for the clinician.
PG  - 1179-223
AB  - Substance abuse remains a complex and pervasive conundrum for society and for
      clinicians seeking to improve the lives of their pediatric patients. Substance
      abuse is linked to the human instinct for pleasure at any cost and is fueled by
      enticing encouragement of the media teaching society to seek drug-induced
      pleasure without fear of negative consequences. Other complications are the
      limited education about psychoactive substances provided to youth and the health 
      care profession pledged to serve them. Primary care clinicians must provide their
      adolescent patients with adequate screening and counseling about substance abuse.
      Treatment of the substance-abusing patient is often a combination of behavioral
      interventions (including family therapy), and, in limited situations,
      addiction-specific medications. Research suggests that female drug addicts have a
      better outcome in female-only drug treatment programs. In addition, new drugs are
      being developed that target specific brain mechanisms involved in drug addiction;
      these drugs will have less toxicity and less abuse potential than illicit drugs
      such as cocaine. Vaccines are being developed that will block the effects of such
      drugs as cocaine and PCP. Medications developed for the treatment of depression
      and epilepsy will be a source of medications for the treatment of drug addiction.
      The study of endorphins and the neurobiology of stress and substance abuse
      promise to develop potent anti-addiction chemicals, greatly aiding in the war on 
      drug abuse.

TI  - Anxiety disorders in the child and teen.
PG  - 1107-38
AB  - Several disorders have been reviewed (Table 1). Based upon review of the
      literature, an algorithm has been developed, supporting the initial use of
      cognitive behavioral therapy, followed by a psychopharmacology algorithm if
      treatment is not successful. In this algorithm, severely anxious patients
      initially may require psychopharmacologic treatment to be able to participate in 
      cognitive behavioral treatment. Nonspecific measures of parent education, general
      support, and illness education to parents and patients are overarching
      principles. In this algorithm, the SSRIs are perceived to be first-line
      interventions, with tricyclic antidepressants and venlafaxine as second-line
      agents. Buspirone is considered a second- or third-line agent, as are the
      benzodiazepines. Table 2 reviews psychopharmacologic agents shown to be useful in
      the management of anxiety disorders in youth. Although much research remains to
      be done, there is evidence of efficacy of several interventions for anxiety
      disorders in children and adolescents. There is a need for a holistic and
      comprehensive management plan. Particular attention must be given to specific
      psychopharmacologic and psychotherapy needs, family matters, abuse issues,
      freedom from substance abuse, the use of peer support groups, and the
      encouragement of healthier lifestyle choices such as exercise. A rising number of
      well-done, large, placebo-controlled studies are providing increased support for 
      medication and psychotherapy to inform evidence-based treatment. There is a need 
      for teamwork and effective communication among team members in addressing
      pediatric and adolescent anxiety disorders.

TI  - Echinocandin antifungal drugs.
PG  - 1142-51
AB  - The echinocandins are large lipopeptide molecules that are inhibitors of
      beta-(1,3)-glucan synthesis, an action that damages fungal cell walls. In vitro
      and in vivo, the echinocandins are rapidly fungicidal against most Candida spp
      and fungistatic against Aspergillus spp. They are not active at clinically
      relevant concentrations against Zygomycetes, Cryptococcus neoformans, or Fusarium
      spp. No drug target is present in mammalian cells. The first of the class to be
      licensed was caspofungin, for refractory invasive aspergillosis (about 40%
      response rate) and the second was micafungin. Adverse events are generally mild, 
      including (for caspofungin) local phlebitis, fever, abnormal liver function
      tests, and mild haemolysis. Poor absorption after oral administration limits use 
      to the intravenous route. Dosing is once daily and drug interactions are few. The
      echinocandins are widely distributed in the body, and are metabolised by the
      liver. Results of studies of caspofungin in candidaemia and invasive candidiasis 
      suggest equivalent efficacy to amphotericin B, with substantially fewer toxic
      effects. Absence of antagonism in combination with other antifungal drugs
      suggests that combination antifungal therapy could become a general feature of
      the echinocandins, particularly for invasive aspergillosis.

TI  - Levetiracetam: a new therapeutic option for refractory epilepsy.
PG  - 616-21
AB  - Levetiracetam (LEV) is the most recently licensed antiepileptic drug (AED) for
      adjunctive therapy of partial seizures. Its mechanism of action is uncertain but 
      it exhibits a unique profile of anticonvulsant activity in models of chronic
      epilepsy. Three randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials enrolling 904
      patients with refractory partial epilepsy have demonstrated the efficacy of LEV
      as adjunctive therapy, with a responder rate (> or = 50% reduction in seizure
      frequency) of 28-41%. Long-term efficacy studies suggest retention rates of 60%
      after one year, with 13% of patients seizure-free for six months of the study and
      8% seizure-free for one year. Adverse effects of LEV, including somnolence,
      lethargy and dizziness, were generally mild and the frequency of incidents was
      not significantly different between the active treatment and placebo groups in
      clinical trials. LEV has no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions
      (PKI) with other AEDs, or with commonly prescribed medications. Preliminary data 
      suggest that LEV has efficacy in primary generalised epilepsy and further
      randomised trials are under way. The combination of potent antiepileptic
      properties with a relatively mild adverse effect profile makes LEV an attractive 
      adjunctive therapy for partial seizures.

TI  - Oxcarbazepine: clinical experience with hospitalized psychiatric patients.
PG  - 370-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oxcarbazepine (10-keto-carbamazepine) appears to be better tolerated 
      and simpler to use than carbamazepine. It has antimanic effects but, as its
      potential clinical usefulness and tolerability in broad samples of psychiatric
      patients remain to be tested, we reviewed both the pharmacology of oxcarbazepine 
      and our early experience with this new agent among psychiatric inpatients.
      METHODS: We reviewed medical records of all inpatients given oxcarbazepine in the
      first 15 months of its use at McLean Hospital. Data analyzed included dosing,
      presenting illnesses, other medications, clinical changes, and adverse effects.
      RESULTS: Oxcarbazepine was given to 56 inpatients (1.3% of admissions; 31 women, 
      25 men) presenting with depression (n = 23), mania (n = 19), or psychosis (n =
      14). The discharge daily dose for the 43 patients (76%) taking oxcarbazepine was 
      831 mg/day, 34% higher in men than women, and fell by 9 mg/year-of-age.
      Oxcarbazepine was the only putative mood-stabilizing agent given at discharge in 
      19 of 43 cases (44%). It was discontinued in 20% of patients for apparent
      inefficacy, and 4% for adverse effects. Changes in CGI and GAF scores were
      similarly high across illnesses, and unrelated to days of use of oxcarbazepine or
      its dose. CONCLUSIONS: Oxcarbazepine was well tolerated and simpler to use
      clinically than its precursor carbamazepine. This agent should be studied in
      controlled trials to test its efficacy in specific types of major psychiatric
      disorders, and particularly for long-term maintenance treatment in bipolar
      disorder.

TI  - Current treatment options for restless legs syndrome.
PG  - 1727-38
AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common but often underdiagnosed neurological
      disorder characterised by an imperative desire to move the extremities associated
      with paraesthesias, motor restlessness, worsening of symptoms at rest in the
      evening or at night and, as a consequence, sleep disturbances particulary.
      Additionally, most patients with RLS have periodic limb movements during sleep
      and relaxed wakefulness. The aetiology of RLS remains unknown. Treatment of RLS
      is generally symptomatic, a causal therapy is possible only in the secondary
      forms. Dopaminergic agents including levodopa and dopamine agonists such as
      pergolide, pramipexole, cabergoline and ropinirole are regarded as the treatment 
      of choice for idiopathic RLS, however, the development of augmentation of
      symptoms, especially under levodopa therapy, may be a major problem. Except in
      special circumstances, opioids and anticonvulsants such as gabapentin or
      benzodiazepines, are regarded as second-line treatment. In secondary RLS, the
      underlying illness should first be treated, although dopaminergic drugs may also 
      be helpful.

TI  - Cannabinoids reduce symptoms of Tourette's syndrome.
PG  - 1717-25
AB  - Currently, the treatment of Tourette's syndrome (TS) is unsatisfactory.
      Therefore, there is expanding interest in new therapeutical strategies. Anecdotal
      reports suggested that the use of cannabis might improve not only tics, but also 
      behavioural problems in patients with TS. A single-dose, cross-over study in 12
      patients, as well as a 6-week, randomised trial in 24 patients, demonstrated that
      Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the most psychoactive ingredient of cannabis, 
      reduces tics in TS patients. No serious adverse effects occurred and no
      impairment on neuropsychological performance was observed. If well-established
      drugs either fail to improve tics or cause significant adverse effects, in adult 
      patients, therapy with Delta9-THC should be tried. At present, it remains unclear
      whether herbal cannabis, different natural or synthetic cannabinoid CB1-receptor 
      agonists or agents that interfere with the inactivation of endocannabinoids, may 
      have the best adverse effect profile in TS.

TI  - Current trends in fibromyalgia research.
PG  - 1687-95
AB  - The development of standardised criteria for the diagnosis of fibromyalgia in
      1990 has allowed careful study of this chronically painful syndrome.
      Epidemiological studies show increased symptoms and disability in patients with
      fibromyalgia, compared with other conditions associated with chronic, widespread 
      pain. In addition, prevalence and severity of fibromyalgia symptoms are increased
      in women. Current studies have identified strong evidence for central
      sensitisation in fibromyalgia. Data from these studies may expand effective
      treatment options for fibromyalgia.

TI  - Spinocerebellar degeneration.
PG  - 1637-41
AB  - The spinocerebellar degenerations/ataxias (SCAs) are a diverse group of rare,
      slowly progressive, neurological diseases, often inherited but of incompletely
      understood pathophysiology, which affect the cerebellum and its related pathways.
      They have few animal models and share no reliable biomarkers. They have, as yet, 
      no universally validated rating scale for use in clinical trials. In the past 25 
      years, there have been, at most, 18 controlled (Class 1) trials for ataxia, which
      have focused on neurotransmitter mechanisms. There is currently only one National
      Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke-sponsored drug trial for ataxia
      (Phase I study of idebenone in Friedreich's ataxia). There are, as yet, no
      FDA-approved drugs for SCA. Current treatment practices encompass rehabilitation 
      interventions and off-label use of symptomatic medications [1,2].

TI  - A self-report of quality of life of patients receiving intrathecal baclofen
      therapy.
PG  - 159-63
AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore through a department quality improvement
      tool a possible relation between quality of life (QOL), complication rates, and
      length of intrathecal baclofen (IB) treatment as reported by patients receiving
      IB therapy in a community-based rehabilitation center outpatient clinic. A second
      objective was to examine complication rates among the clinic's patients. No
      conclusions could be drawn as to the relation between QOL, various reported
      complications, and length of treatment. A rank order frequency of areas reported 
      by respondents to have the greatest impact on their QOL could be extrapolated
      from the data collected. In addition, complication rates among the patients who
      responded to the survey could be reported. Surveys from 49 patients about their
      experiences with IB therapy were analyzed. Respondents included 30 adult and 19
      pediatric patients. Thirty-six patients (73%) had used the IB pump for 1 year or 
      more. The survey included questions about QOL, complications, and length of IB
      treatment. Forty-three respondents (88%) stated they felt that their QOL had
      improved with IB therapy. Four patients (8%) responded that they were not sure
      that it had, and only 2 patients (4%) said that IB had not improved their QOL.
      The most frequently reported positive effects on QOL were reported in the
      following areas: spasticity control without the sedative effect of oral
      medication; ease of care for caregivers; easier positioning; less pain/increased 
      comfort; and improved patient transfers. High ratings of improvement in the
      patients' QOL were reported despite a reported overall complication rate of 39%. 
      The most common complications cited were infection and catheter breakage or
      disconnect. The overall infection rate for respondents was 10% (5 patients of the
      49 surveyed reported infection). The rate of catheter breakage or disconnect was 
      also 10%. Despite the complications reported, 46 patients stated they would
      recommend baclofen treatment to others. Three patients did not respond to the
      question. None of the patients said they would not recommend baclofen to others.

PG  - 1757-62
AB  - CONTEXT: 1',1'dimethylheptyl-Delta8-tetrahydrocannabinol-11-oic acid (CT-3), a
      potent analog of THC-11-oic acid, produces marked antiallodynic and analgesic
      effects in animals without evoking the typical effects described in models of
      cannabinoids. Therefore, CT-3 may be an effective analgesic for poorly controlled
      resistant neuropathic pain. OBJECTIVE: To examine the analgesic efficacy and
      safety of CT-3 in chronic neuropathic pain in humans. DESIGN AND SETTING:
      Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover trial conducted in Germany
      from May-September 2002. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-one patients (8 women and 13 men)
      aged 29 to 65 years (mean, 51 years) who had a clinical presentation and
      examination consistent with chronic neuropathic pain (for at least 6 months) with
      hyperalgesia (n = 21) and allodynia (n = 7). INTERVENTIONS: Patients were
      randomized to two 7-day treatment orders in a crossover design. Two daily doses
      of CT-3 (four 10-mg capsules per day) or identical placebo capsules were given
      during the first 4 days and 8 capsules per day were given in 2 daily doses in the
      following 3 days. After a washout and baseline period of 1 week each, patients
      crossed over to the second 7-day treatment period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual 
      analog scale (VAS) and verbal rating scale scores for pain; vital sign,
      hematologic and blood chemistry, and electrocardiogram measurements; scores on
      the Trail-Making Test and the Addiction Research Center Inventory-Marijuana
      scale; and adverse effects. RESULTS: The mean differences over time for the VAS
      values in the CT-3-placebo sequence measured 3 hours after intake of study drug
      differed significantly from those in the placebo-CT-3 sequence (mean [SD], -11.54
      [14.16] vs 9.86 [21.43]; P =.02). Eight hours after intake of the drug, the pain 
      scale differences between groups were less marked. No dose response was observed.
      Adverse effects, mainly transient dry mouth and tiredness, were reported
      significantly more often during CT-3 treatment (mean [SD] difference, -0.67
      [0.50] for CT-3-placebo sequence vs 0.10 [0.74] for placebo-CT-3 sequence; P
      =.02). There were no significant differences with respect to vital signs, blood
      tests, electrocardiogram, Trail-Making Test, and Addiction Research Center
      Inventory-Marijuana scale. No carryover or period effects were observed except on
      the Trail-Making Test. CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary study, CT-3 was effective
      in reducing chronic neuropathic pain compared with placebo. No major adverse
      effects were observed.

      in neurorehabilitation, but neurosurgical interventions for relief of spasticity 
      are not widely performed, at least in Asian countries including Japan. We have
      been performing various types of neurosurgical treatment for spasticity such as
      selective peripheral neurotomy, selective dorsal rhizotomy, microsurgical
      DREZotomy, and intrathecal baclofen administration. We deal with both children
      and adults. From our experience of tibial neurotomy, in particular, we describe
      functional microsurgical anatomy of the tibial nerve in the popliteal fossa. This
      is the first report on this regional functional anatomy.

TI  - Early use of intrathecal baclofen in brain injury in pediatric patients.
PG  - 81-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of
      intrathecal Baclofen for spasticity from traumatic brain injury in June of 1996
      based on a Phase III clinical trial that documented efficacy in patients one year
      post injury. The FDA approval is only for patients who are one year post injury
      based on the Phase III study. We have found use of ITB in the first few months
      after injury very effective in a subgroup of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) 
      pediatric patients with spasticity, dystonia and autonomic storming following
      brain injury. METHOD: The author's database of over 250 patients receiving
      intrathecal baclofen was reviewed. Retrospective chart review was undertaken of
      the 6 patients identified with brain injuries over a three year period that were 
      given ITB less than one year post injury. The patients' diagnosis included
      asphyxia, traumatic brain injury and stroke. The ages were one year to fourteen
      years of age. ITB was offered after all conventional therapy had been exhausted
      and the patient's spasticity remained intractable. These patients also all
      experienced autonomic dysfunction with severe autonomic storms. FINDINGS: All of 
      the patients had a decrease in their spasticity of at least 2 points on the
      Ashworth score. The autonomic storms ceased in all 6 patients when adequate
      dosages of ITB were reached. The patients could be weaned from all oral and
      intravenous medications for tone, storming and fever. Many of the patients became
      much more alert and interactive when the medications were stopped. Five of the
      six are still using their pump for their tone one to five years post implant, the
      sixth had the pump stopped at the parents' request for religious reasons.
      INTERPRETATION: Early use of ITB can play a significant role in the
      rehabilitation of brain injury in children.

      However, the Ministry of health, labour and welfare has not allowed the therapy
      in Japan. A clinical trial of intrathecal baclofen therapy is currently under
      way. In this paper the situation in Japan with regard to ITB therapy is described
      and information for physicians in Japan given from our experience. Team approach 
      is important for ITB therapy. Special attention should be paid to patient
      selection.

TI  - Clinical application of drug pump for spasticity, pain, and restorative
      neurosurgery: other clinical applications of intrathecal baclofen.
PG  - 37-8
AB  - Intrathecal baclofen has been successfully used for control of severe spasticity.
      Baclofen, an agonist of GABA-B receptor, has other potential effects on pain and 
      recovery from coma. Sporadic episodes of dramatic recovery from persistent
      vegetative state are reported after intrathecal administration of baclofen. There
      are also reports on the use of baclofen for neuropathic pain including
      post-stroke central pain syndrome. Baclofen is also used for control of dystonia 
      due to cerebral palsy or reflex sympathetic dystrophy. On the other hand,
      epidural spinal cord stimulation has been used for pain, spasticity, dystonia, or
      attempt to improve deteriorated consciousness, though the effects seem variable
      and modest. Similarity between baclofen and spinal cord stimulation is
      interesting in that both involves in spinal GABAergic system. The GABAergic
      system in the spinal cord plays a pivotal role in various clinical effects of
      these procedures.

AB  - A 77-y-old patient developed weakness of extremities, legs paralysis, dysarthria 
      and tremor 1 h after ingestion of 200 mg ketoconazole for the first time in his
      life. All complaints faded away within 24 h. Few days later, the patient used
      another 200 mg ketoconazole tablet, and within an hour experienced a similar
      clinical picture, which resolved again spontaneously within hours. Laboratory
      evaluations, including head CT scan, were normal. This case illustrates the need 
      for close vigilance in adverse drug reactions, particularly in the elderly.

TI  - Childhood malaria in East London.
PG  - 814-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the epidemiologic, clinical and laboratory features of
      children younger than 16 years with malaria in East London. METHODS:
      Retrospective case review of all children admitted to two East London hospitals
      with malaria identified between 1996 and 2001 with the use of notifications and
      hospital discharge data. RESULTS: A total of 211 children with a median age of 9 
      years (range, 11 to 179 months) were identified. Children living in the UK who
      acquired malaria while visiting a malaria-endemic country on holiday accounted
      for 82% of cases, whereas the rest were children visiting the UK from endemic
      areas. Three-fourths of children who had traveled to a malaria-endemic area were 
      born in the UK, and 93% were of Black African ethnicity. The peak seasonal
      incidence was late summer/early autumn. Plasmodium falciparum acquired in Africa 
      accounted for 91% of cases. Although 42% of children took antimalarial
      prophylaxis, only 15% of medications were taken according to recommended
      guidelines. Another family member, most often a sibling, was found to have
      concurrent malaria in 23% (49 of 211) of cases. On the basis of the WHO criteria,
      15 children (7.1%) 15 months to 15 years of age had severe malaria, including
      convulsions (n = 4), acute renal failure (n = 3), jaundice (n = 4), severe anemia
      (n = 3) and >2% parasitemia (n = 6). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of children with
      malaria in this study were UK-born, school age, of Black African ethnicity and
      were visiting family in Africa, often with other family members. Most children
      had low level parasitemia and uncomplicated malaria, and they responded rapidly
      to antimalarial treatment.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Case report. OBJECTIVE: To report treatment of spasticity in a
      spinal cord-injured person with intrathecal morphine after the person developed
      tolerance to intrathecal baclofen. METHOD: Spasticity in a 36-year-old man with
      T6 complete paraplegia was treated with increasing doses of intrathecal baclofen.
      When he developed tolerance to intrathecal baclofen, he was given continuous
      infusion of morphine intrathecally. SETTING: Regional Spinal Injuries Centre, UK.
      RESULTS: Spasticity was adequately controlled by intrathecal morphine.
      CONCLUSION: In spinal cord-injured patients with severe spasticity, who become
      tolerant to intrathecal baclofen, treatment with intrathecal morphine may be
      useful.

TI  - [Head retraction reflex-like movements with severe bulbar symptoms in a patient
      with stiff-person syndrome].
PG  - 322-6
AB  - A 57-year-old woman developed muscular stiffness and painful cramps, which were
      relieved by administration of dantrolene sodium. Her serum level of antibodies to
      glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) was markedly elevated and continuous muscular
      activities were observed on resting surface EMG. These features were compatible
      with those in stiff-person syndrome (SPS). She was found to have thymoma on CT
      scan. Immediately after thymomectomy, which was histologically diagnosed as a
      benign hyperplasia, she developed head retraction reflex-like movements evoked by
      sensory stimulation to the face, which were followed by severe bulbar symptoms
      with dysphagia and respiratory arrest. Postoperative myasthenia gravis was
      excluded clinically. While somatosensory evoked EMG on splenius muscle initially 
      showed biphasic responses with latency of 15 msec and 55 msec, respectively after
      oral angle non-painful electric stimulation, the late potential phase disappeared
      after the patient recovered from bulbar symptoms. This suggests that head
      retraction reflex-like movements of this patient reflected the attenuation of
      inhibitory potentials from the brainstem.

TI  - Medication for sleep-wake disorders.
PG  - 899-903
AB  - Medication is indicated for only a limited number of children's sleep disorders. 
      However, correctly chosen and supervised, pharmacological treatment may be
      justified and helpful. For a given sleep problem it is important to identify the 
      underlying cause (or sleep disorder) which often calls for treatment of a
      non-medication type. Where medication is appropriate, cautious use and careful
      review of the child's physical and psychological state is essential in view of
      the limited information available on effectiveness and possible short and long
      term effects. It follows that much further research is required to establish the 
      part medication can play in the care of children with sleep disorders, and also
      to define the possible effects on sleep and wakefulness of other drugs used in
      clinical practice.

TI  - [Incidence, pathoetiology and treatment of interferon-alpha induced
      neuro-psychiatric side effects].
PG  - 469-76
AB  - Interferon alpha (IFN-alpha), an immunomodulatory cytokine, is used for the
      treatment of several disorders including chronic hepatitis or malignant melanoma.
      During the therapy IFN-alpha may cause severe neuropsychiatric syndromes
      including depression with suicidal ideation, paranoid psychoses or confusional
      states. The reasons and management of these side effects are widely unknown. The 
      underlying pathogenetic mechanisms include various effects on neuroendocrine,
      cytokine and neurotransmitter systems. This review summarizes therapeutic
      strategies against IFN-alpha associated psychiatric syndromes. Zolpidem or
      Zopiclon can be used for the treatment of sleeping disturbances.
      Serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors including citalopram or paroxetine were shown to be
      effective for acute treatment of IFN-alpha associated depression. The efficacy of
      prophylactic treatment for prevention of IFN-alpha induced depression has to be
      proven in future trials. In an interdisciplinary setting, psychiatric disorders
      and drug addiction should not prevent patients from interferon-alpha treatment.
      Furthermore, interdisciplinary care should improve quality of life, adherence and
      therapeutic outcome of interferon-alpha treated patients.

TI  - Epilepsy in the elderly.
PG  - 241-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epilepsy is one of the most common neurologic diseases that affect
      the elderly population. Underlying etiologies as well as diagnostic and treatment
      issues vary from that of younger adults and deserve special consideration. REVIEW
      SUMMARY: The substantially increased risk of seizures and epilepsy in the elderly
      is associated with medical conditions that affect this group such as stroke,
      dementia, and metabolic disturbances. In addition, there is an increased
      incidence and associated mortality of status epilepticus among seniors.
      Distinguishing epilepsy from paroxysmal nonepileptic events can be a particular
      challenge. As in the general adult population, EEG and MRI are the cornerstones
      of diagnostic assessment; however, the clinician must be aware of nonspecific
      changes associated with aging that do not necessarily indicate an underlying
      predisposition for epilepsy. Finally, there are unique challenges to the
      treatment of epilepsy in this population, but fortunately there are multiple
      treatment options available, including nonpharmacological therapies. CONCLUSIONS:
      Knowledge of the unique challenges in identifying and treating the elderly
      patient with epilepsy is important for effective management as well as maximizing
      quality of life. However, further studies in this area are still needed to
      establish optimal treatment strategies.

TI  - Consent and anaesthetic risk.
PG  - 962-84
AB  - The incidences of mortality and morbidity associated with anaesthesia were
      reviewed. Most of the published incidences for common complications of
      anaesthesia vary considerably. Where possible, a realistic estimate of the
      incidence of each morbidity has been made, based on the best available data.
      Perception of risk and communication of anaesthetic risk to patients are
      discussed. The incidences of anaesthetic complications are compared with the
      relative risks of everyday events, using a community cluster logarithmic scale,
      in order to place the risks in perspective when compared with other complications
      and with the inherent risks of surgery. Documentation of these risks and
      discussion with patients should allow them to be better informed of the relative 
      risks of anaesthetic complications. Depending on specific comorbidities and the
      severity of operation, these risks associated with anaesthesia may increase for
      any one individual.

TI  - Risk factors for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy: a controlled prospective
      study based on coroners cases.
PG  - 456-64
AB  - We performed a controlled prospective study of pathologically verified sudden
      unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) in a coronial setting, to identify risk
      factors. We prospectively studied coronial deaths of people with epilepsy in
      Vic., Australia, during a 21-month period. Fifty SUDEP and 50 subjects with
      epilepsy who died of other causes (controls) were collected sequentially.
      Clinical data was obtained shortly after death from questionnaires completed by
      treating doctors, discussion with family members and coronial files, including
      police reports of death, autopsy and toxicology reports. Factors assessed were
      age, sex, duration of epilepsy, type of seizure(s), seizure frequency,
      symptomatic epilepsy, including post-traumatic epilepsy, presence of structural
      brain lesion, idiopathic epilepsy, mental retardation, psychiatric illness,
      including dementia, recent stressful life event, particular antiepileptic drugs
      (AEDs) and AED polytherapy, compliance with AED treatment, psychotropic drug
      prescription, alcohol and other substance abuse, place of death and evidence of
      terminal seizure. The SUDEP group was characterised by younger age and higher
      proportion found dead in bed and with evidence of terminal seizure compared to
      controls. The profile of patients at risk for SUDEP are young people with
      epilepsy. They are most likely to die in sleep and our data support the view that
      SUDEP is a seizure-related event. This, taken in conjunction with the finding
      that there was no increased risk associated with a particular AED in monotherapy 
      or multiple AEDs suggests that attempts to better treat patients' epilepsy with
      AEDs might decrease the risk of SUDEP. Although the literature suggests that
      SUDEP is more frequent in patients with severe epilepsy, we did not find a
      correlation with seizure frequency suggesting that other clinical indices may be 
      more important.

TI  - A pilot study examining topical amitriptyline, ketamine, and a combination of
      both in the treatment of neuropathic pain.
PG  - 323-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The involvement of ongoing peripheral activity in the generation of
      nociceptive input in neuropathic pain suggests that topical drug delivery may be 
      useful as a treatment strategy. This is a pilot study providing initial
      information regarding the use of novel topical preparations containing
      amitriptyline (AMI), ketamine (KET), and a combination of both in the treatment
      of neuropathic pain. METHODS: The study design included a 2 day randomized,
      double blind, placebo controlled, 4 way cross-over trial of all treatments,
      followed by an open label treatment phase using the combination cream for 7 days.
      Twenty volunteers with chronic neuropathic pain were randomly assigned to
      treatment order and applied 5 mls of each topical treatment (1% AMI, 0.5% KET,
      combination AMI 1%/KET 0.5%, and placebo) for 2 days. Measures of pain at the end
      of each block included the short form McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) and visual 
      analog scales (VAS) for present pain intensity and pain relief. Eleven subjects
      who judged subjective improvement from any treatment in the initial trial entered
      the open-label trial and used the combination cream for 7 days. Pain levels were 
      recorded daily using the same measures. Blood levels for amitriptyline and
      ketamine were performed at 7 days to determine whether systemic absorption had
      occurred. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference from placebo
      after 2 days for any treatment during the double blind component of the trial. In
      the 11 subjects who used the combination cream, there was a statistically
      significant effect, with subjects reporting significantly greater analgesia by
      days 3 to 7 according to measures of pain and pain relief. Blood levels revealed 
      that there was no significant systemic absorption of amitriptyline or ketamine.
      Only 2 subjects experienced side effects; these were minor and did not lead to
      discontinuation of the cream. CONCLUSION: This pilot study demonstrated a lack of
      effect for all treatments in the 2 day double blind placebo controlled trial,
      followed by analgesia in an open label trial in a subgroup of subjects who chose 
      to use the combination cream for 7 days. Blood analysis revealed no significant
      systemic absorption of either agent after 7 days of treatment, and creams were
      well tolerated. A larger scale randomized trial over a longer interval is
      warranted to examine further effects observed in the open label trial.

TI  - The diverse roles of anticonvulsants in bipolar disorders.
PG  - 95-108
AB  - Anticonvulsant drugs (ACs) have diverse antiseizure, psychotropic, and
      biochemical effects. Carbamazepine and valproate have mood-stabilizing actions,
      benzodiazepines and gabapentin have anxiolytic actions, lamotrigine is useful in 
      rapid cycling and acute treatment and prophylaxis of bipolar depression, and
      topiramate and zonisamide can yield weight loss. Limited controlled data suggest 
      the carbamazepine keto derivative oxcarbazepine has antimanic effects. A
      categorical approach to the diverse roles of ACs in bipolar disorders is
      proposed, using broad categories of ACs, on the basis of their predominant
      psychotropic profiles. Thus, some ACs have "sedating" profiles that may include
      sedation, cognitive difficulties, fatigue, weight gain, and possibly antimanic
      and/or anxiolytic effects. In contrast, some newer ACs have "activating" profiles
      that may include improved energy, weight loss, and possibly antidepressant and
      even anxiogenic effects. Still other newer ACs have novel "mixed" profiles,
      combining sedation and weight loss. A categorical-mechanistic extension of this
      approach is also presented, with hypotheses that "sedating" profiles might be
      related to prominent potentiation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibitory
      neurotransmission, "activating" profiles could be related to prominent
      attenuation of glutamate excitatory neurotransmission, and for "mixed" profiles, 
      sedation and weight loss might be related to concurrent GABAergic and
      antiglutamatergic actions, respectively. The categorical approach may have
      utility as an aid to clinicians in reinforcing the heterogeneity ACs, and
      recalling psychotropic profiles of individual ACs, but is limited as it fails to 
      address the etiology of the heterogeneity of AC psychotropic effects. The
      categorical-mechanistic extension strives to address this issue, but requires
      systematic clinical investigation of more precise relationships between
      psychotropic profiles and discrete mechanisms of action to assess its merits.

TI  - Drug delivery to the central nervous system: a review.
PG  - 252-73
AB  - The brain is a delicate organ, and evolution built very efficient ways to protect
      it. Unfortunately, the same mechanisms that protect it against intrusive
      chemicals can also frustrate therapeutic interventions. Many existing
      pharmaceuticals are rendered ineffective in the treatment of cerebral diseases
      due to our inability to effectively deliver and sustain them within the brain.
      General methods that can enhance drug delivery to the brain are, therefore, of
      great interest. Despite aggressive research, patients suffering from fatal and/or
      debilitating central nervous system (CNS) diseases, such as brain tumors, HIV
      encephalopathy, epilepsy, cerebrovascular diseases and neurodegenerative
      disorders, far outnumber those dying of all types of systemic cancer or heart
      disease. The clinical failure of much potentially effective therapeutics is often
      not due to a lack of drug potency but rather to shortcomings in the method by
      which the drug is delivered. Treating CNS diseases is particularly challenging
      because a variety of formidable obstacles often impede drug delivery to the brain
      and spinal cord. By localizing drugs at their desired site of action one can
      reduce toxicity and increase treatment efficiency. In response to the
      insufficiency in conventional delivery mechanisms, aggressive research efforts
      have recently focused on the development of new strategies to more effectively
      deliver drug molecules to the CNS. This review intends to detail the recent
      advances in the field of brain-targeting, rational drug design approach and drug 
      delivery to CNS. To illustrate the complexity of the problems that have to be
      overcome for successful brain targeting, a brief intercellular characterization
      of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is also included.

TI  - Does pain relief improve pain behavior and mood in chronic pain patients?
PG  - 791-7
AB  - Chronic pain is a subjective experience and has not only physical, but also
      psychological and social dimensions. In the present study, we sought to determine
      whether an effective pain reduction would improve mood, behavioral, and cognitive
      outcome measures in chronic pain patients. Four-hundred-seventy-seven patients
      entering pain therapy at our university pain center were prospectively studied
      during the first year of treatment. Patients received pharmacotherapy,
      acupuncture, transcutaneous nerve stimulation, physiotherapy, and invasive pain
      treatment. Intensity and quality of pain were assessed with the Visual Analog
      Scale and Multidimensional Pain Scale. Psychological and social aspects were
      evaluated using the Pain Behavior Questionnaire and the Profile of Mood States
      questionnaire. Significant reductions in pain intensity (Visual Analog Scale,
      7.35 at pretreatment and 1.03 after 12 mo; P = 0.01; Multidimensional Pain Scale,
      F = 6.185; P < 0.001) were accompanied by improvements in behavioral and
      cognitive dimensions (Pain Behavior Questionnaire, F = 9.483; P = 0.002).
      However, mood and psychological well-being did not improve (Profile of Mood
      States, F = 0.416; P = 0.551). The authors conclude that reducing pain intensity 
      improves behavioral and cognitive dimensions but not psychological well-being and
      cognitive assessment.

TI  - The current treatment of epilepsy: a challenge of choices.
PG  - 349-56
AB  - There are now several distinct choices for seizure and epilepsy treatment. These 
      include 16 antiepileptic medications, surgery, vagus nerve stimulation, and
      ketogenic diet. However, not every option is appropriate for all individuals with
      epilepsy. This article reviews the commonly employed treatments for chronic
      seizures, with the goal of trying to assess when certain treatments should be
      considered. An approach to seizure management is presented to help navigate the
      challenge of epilepsy treatment choices.

TI  - Pulsed radiofrequency treatment of the Gasserian ganglion in patients with
      idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia.
PG  - 449-52
AB  - Pulsed radiofrequency treatment has been described as a minimal invasive
      alternative to radiofrequency thermocoagulation for the management of chronic
      pain syndromes. We present here our first five high-risk patients with idiopathic
      trigeminal neuralgia who were treated with pulsed radiofrequency after
      multidisciplinary assessment; with a mean follow-up of 19.2 months (range 10-26).
      These patients were at high risk due to age, co-morbidities or previous
      interventional and surgical treatments. An excellent long-term effect was
      achieved in three of the five patients, a partial effect in one patient and a
      short-term effect in one patient. No neurological side effects or complications
      were reported.

TI  - Phenyramidol-associated liver toxicity.
PG  - 1244-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe a case of hepatotoxicity associated with phenyramidol use 
      that resolved after discontinuation of the drug. BACKGROUND: Phenyramidol is a
      moderately potent and relatively nontoxic analgesic with concomitant
      muscle-relaxant activity. A MEDLINE search in June 2003 revealed no reports
      associating hepatotoxicity with this agent. CASE SUMMARY: A 70-year-old man was
      investigated because of elevated liver function test values on routine
      biochemical screening. He had no clinical symptoms. Other etiologies of hepatitis
      were appropriately ruled out, and elevated enzymes were ascribed to phenyramidol 
      treatment. DISCUSSION: This is the first case published in the English language
      literature describing probable hepatotoxicity, according to the Naranjo
      probability scale, resulting from use of phenyramidol. The mechanism of
      phenyramidol-induced liver damage is unknown. Several features, such as the
      absence of predictable dose-dependent toxicity of phenyramidol in previous
      studies and the absence of hypersensitivity manifestations in our patient, are
      suggestive of a metabolic type of idiosyncratic toxicity. CONCLUSIONS:
      Phenyramidol should be considered as a drug that possibly causes hepatotoxicity.

TI  - Pharmacological management of postherpetic neuralgia.
PG  - 771-80
AB  - Postherpetic neuralgia, which occurs most typically in older persons, is one of
      the most common and serious complications of herpes zoster (or shingles). It is a
      chronic neuropathic pain syndrome and remains one of the most difficult pain
      disorders to treat. Known beneficial agents include antidepressants,
      antiepileptic drugs, opioid analgesics, local anaesthetics, capsaicin and other, 
      less applied, modalities. Although monotherapy is commonly applied, no single
      best treatment for postherpetic neuralgia has been identified; nevertheless,
      gabapentin (antiepileptic) and transdermal lidocaine (anaesthetic) are often used
      as the first-choice treatments. Recent research has shed light on possible pain
      mechanisms as well as new avenues of treatment, which are discussed in the
      article. For patients with pain that is not adequately controlled, individualised
      treatment plans must be pursued. It is critical to recognise that postherpetic
      neuralgia, while difficult to manage, can be a treatable neuropathic pain
      syndrome.

TI  - Anesthetic implications of neuromuscular disease.
PG  - 177-85
AB  - Neuromuscular disease covers a wide range of conditions, with anesthesia
      management being required either for problems relevant to the disorder or for
      comorbid conditions. The diseases often have specific problems that can usually
      be predicted from their pathophysiology. The anesthesiologist must ensure a
      thorough preoperative assessment, appropriate choice of anesthetic technique and 
      neuromuscular blocking drugs, and careful monitoring of both hemodynamic
      parameters and the degree of neuromuscular blockade. With these considerations,
      the patient with neuromuscular disease, although challenging, can be given
      anesthetic care in a safe fashion.

PG  - 166-8
AB  - Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and spastic cerebral palsy are both familiar
      complications of prematurity. Children who are otherwise candidates for
      intrathecal baclofen infusion occasionally have long, transverse, right
      midabdominal laparotomy incisions from past management of NEC, and these
      incisions may interfere with selection of a site for pump implantation.
      Successful pump implantation immediately beneath a laparotomy incision was
      accomplished using a modification of the popular subfascial technique.

TI  - Effects of gabapentin on anxiety induced by simulated public speaking.
PG  - 184-8
AB  - The effects of gabapentin, 400 mg and 800 mg, on anxiety induced by simulated
      public speaking (SPS) were investigated. Thirty-two normal male volunteers (aged 
      17-30 years) had their anxiety and mood evaluated by self-scales [Visual Analogue
      Mood Scale (VAMS) and Profile of Mood State (POMS)] during the SPS procedure.
      Physiological measures (heart rate and blood pressure) were taken. Treatment with
      gabapentin at 800 mg attenuated the anxiety of subjects that had a decrease on
      the VAMS item calm-excite. In addition, volunteers that received gabapentin at
      400 mg and 800 mg showed a decrease in the hostility score in POMS. Our results
      suggest, in agreement with other studies, an anxiolytic potential to gabapentin.

TI  - GABA-ergic drugs: exit stage left, enter stage right.
PG  - 174-8
AB  - Drugs that enhance gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) activity by interacting at
      post-synaptic GABA(A) receptors have long been used as hypnotics, sedatives,
      tranquillizers and anticonvulsants. In this category, benzodiazepines rapidly
      gained pride of place, replacing barbiturates and becoming the most commonly
      prescribed of all drugs in the Western world in the 1970s. However, problems such
      as dependence and withdrawal reactions became apparent in the 1980s, and it
      seemed that the usefulness of drugs with this mode of action was limited.
      Recently, focus has shifted to a new group of drugs with GABA-ergic actions
      mediated through various mechanisms not directly involving the GABA(A) receptor. 
      These drugs include gabapentin, vigabatrin, tiagabine, lamotrigine, pregabalin
      and others. Although originally developed as anticonvulsants for epilepsy, they
      appear to have wider applications for use in affective disorders, especially
      bipolar depression, anxiety disorders and pain conditions. The current
      information on the properties and therapeutic potential of this new generation of
      GABA-ergic drugs is reviewed. It remains to be seen whether long-term use leads
      to tolerance, dependence and withdrawal or discontinuation reactions.

TI  - Chronic pelvic pain.
PG  - 327-33
AB  - The topic of chronic pelvic pain (CPP) has long been a frustrating one for
      physicians and patients alike, with difficulties in diagnosis and management
      leading to delays in recovery. Recent insights into the neurobiology of chronic
      pain disorders and into mechanisms of visceral pain suggest that significant
      advances in treatment of CPP are likely to occur during coming years. These
      insights suggest that we consider directing our treatment efforts away from the
      visceral organ presumed to be primarily responsible for the CPP and toward
      treatment of the neurologic mechanisms that sustain chronic pain.

AB  - Headache is a frequent symptom in women of childbearing age and during pregnancy.
      Benign and pathologic headaches may change in response to changes in estrogen
      after conception. Expected patterns of change are described for headaches that
      occur commonly during pregnancy. In addition, although treatment options are
      limited during pregnancy, a variety of effective medication and nonmedication
      treatments are available and should be offered to women with benign headaches
      that persist into the second trimester of pregnancy.

PG  - 281-7
AB  - The relationship between sleep and sleep disorders and headache remains unclear. 
      Clinical experience and numerous studies document some sort of relationship, but 
      the exact nature remains understudied and complex. Changes in sleep duration and 
      sleep quality appear to be capable of affecting headaches of different types.
      Obstructive sleep apnea can cause or exacerbate headaches in a susceptible
      person. Obstructive sleep apnea also may cause a specific headache when
      awakening, which is different from migraine or tension headache and disappears
      after treatment of the sleep and breathing disturbance. Hypnic headache is
      another type of sleep-exclusive headache that has been proposed. Hypnic headaches
      are brief, moderately severe, and affect the elderly primarily.

TI  - Cancer pain and anxiety.
PG  - 249-61
AB  - Anxiety and pain can be understood with a multidimensional framework that
      accounts for somatic, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral aspects of these
      conditions. Patients who have cancer or treatment-related pain are more likely to
      be anxious than cancer patients without pain. Patients with cancer pain and
      anxiety cause difficult diagnostic dilemmas because some degree of anxiety is a
      normal response to having a severe medical illness. Furthermore, the somatic
      symptoms of anxiety often overlap with symptoms related to underlying disease
      processes or treatment effects. The degree of disruption in a patient's life
      often is the critical factor in distinguishing normal from maladaptive anxiety.
      Making an accurate diagnosis will help guide anxiety treatment and screening
      instruments can facilitate the recognition of those patients in need of further
      assessment. The relationship between pain and anxiety is complex and
      bidirectional, with interactions occurring on physiologic and psychologic levels.
      There are a variety of psychopharmacologic, psychotherapeutic, and
      complementary/alternative treatments available. A comprehensive approach to care 
      includes these approaches in an individualized way. Terminal sedation is examined
      as a compassionate option for relieving intractable distress at the end of life.

TI  - Risperidone in acute and continuation treatment of mania.
PG  - 227-35
AB  - In a prospective study, we examined the efficacy of risperidone added-on to mood 
      stabilizers in the acute and continuation treatment of mania over a 12-week
      period. Patients (n=108) with a DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar disorder, manic or
      mixed episode requiring treatment with an antipsychotic were recruited. All
      subjects were on one or two mood stabilizers at the time of initiation of
      risperidone (range 0.5-4 mg). No other antipsychotic medication or ongoing
      benzodiazepine therapy was allowed. There was a significant decrease in mean
      Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) scores from baseline (27.5+/-7.5) to week 1
      (-10.8, P<0.0001), week 3 (-17.7, P<0.0001) and to week 12(-22.6, P<0.0001). When
      response was defined as > or = 50% reduction in YMRS scores from baseline, 32%,
      68% and 90% of patients met criteria at week 1, week 3 and week 12, respectively.
      Significant decreases in mean 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores
      from baseline (12.2+/-7.7) to week 3 (-5.7, P<0.0001) and week 12 (-5.7,
      P<0.0001) were also observed. No significant changes in extrapyramidal symptoms
      were noted between baseline and endpoint. The mean daily dose of risperidone was 
      2 mg with a median of 1.8 mg. These findings support the results of the two
      previous double-blind, randomized trials and indicate that the addition of
      risperidone to mood stabilizers is a safe and effective treatment for acute and
      continuation treatment of mania. Risperidone add-on does not induce depressive
      symptoms and, furthermore, risperidone may have efficacy in treating comorbid
      depressive symptoms in bipolar patients.

TI  - Neurotrophic factors as novel therapeutics for neuropathic pain.
PG  - 460-72
AB  - Neuropathic pain is a chronic condition that is caused by injury to the nervous
      system. Unlike acute pain, which is protective, neuropathic pain persists and
      serves no useful purpose, and severely affects quality of life. However, present 
      therapies have modest efficacy in most patients, are palliative rather than
      curative, and their side effects represent significant limitations. Tremendous
      progress has been made over the past decade in our understanding of the biology
      of pain sensory neurons. The recent discovery that neurotrophic factors play an
      important role in neuropathic pain indicates that these pathways could serve as
      novel intervention points for therapy. Moreover, neurotrophic factors have the
      potential to address the underlying pathophysiology of neuropathic pain, thereby 
      halting or reversing the disease process.

TI  - Seizures in children with systemic cancer.
PG  - 190-3
AB  - Children with cancer are a population with specific risk factors for the
      development of seizures. They present distinct problems in assessment and
      management that sets them apart from the usual pediatric patients. We reviewed
      the information gathered on our pediatric neurooncology database regarding 47
      children with systemic cancer complicated by seizures. Leukemia was the most
      frequent underlying cancer (47%). In children with hematologic cancers,
      toxic-metabolic disturbances were the most frequent cause of seizures, whereas in
      patients with solid cancers, metastases were the single most common etiology.
      Children undergoing bone marrow transplant were particularly susceptible to
      seizures (34%), but only a minority progressed to develop a chronic seizure
      disorder (19.1%). Neuroimaging studies provided useful etiologic information in
      62%. The choice of the antiseizure medication should take into account the
      potential interaction with the chemotherapy or supportive drugs often
      administered to these patients.

TI  - [Intrathecal baclofen in the treatment of severe spastic tetraplegia and dystonia
      in children and adolescents].
PG  - 1755-9
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Continuous intrathecal baclofen has been used over the past years
      especially in adult patients with spasticity of spinal origin. Children and young
      adults with severe spasticity and dystonia of cerebral origin are difficult to
      treat in spite of optimal systemic antispasmotic therapy with baclofen,
      tizanidine, dantrolene and/or diazepam. Intrathecal baclofen has therefore been
      applied in a group of young patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eight children and
      young adults from East Denmark with spasticity and 12 with dystonia aged 3-18
      years (median 10.9 years) were tested, operated and treated with continuous
      intrathecal baclofen for a period of 2-64 months (median 22.2 months).
      Registration of efficacy, fillings, adjustments of baclofen and other therapies
      were performed in an out patient setting since 1995. RESULTS: Spasticity in lower
      extremities was reduced from Ashworth score 3.5-4.5 (median 4.2) to Ashworth
      score 2.5-4.0 (median 2.9; p < 0.001) during infusion with baclofen 5-33
      micrograms/kg/24 hours (median 19 micrograms/kg/24 hours). The infusion catheter 
      tip was placed at levels Th1-Th12 (median Th7.5). Peroral baclofen was reduced
      from an average of 5.0 to 0.44 mg/kg/24 hours, tizanidine from 0.4 to 0.1
      mg/kg/24 hours, and dantrolene from 4.0 to 0.4 mg/kg/24 hours. After initial
      adjustments successively increased dosages of average 0.46 microgram/kg/month
      were needed to maintain the same level of efficacy. In questionnaires parents or 
      guardians rated less spasticity in lower extremities in 15 out of 19 patients,
      and less pain in 13 out of 19 patients. CONCLUSION: Continuous intrathecal
      baclofen was effective in treating severe spasticity and dystonia of cerebral
      origin with major effect on muscles of the lower extremities, pelvis, and back
      and in particular opisthotonus was relieved. Efficacy on upper extremities was
      far less pronounced.

TI  - New daily persistent headache.
PG  - 218-23
AB  - New daily persistent headache was first described by Vanast in 1986 as a benign
      form of chronic daily headache that improved without therapy. In the headache
      specialist's office, new daily persistent headache is anything but benign and is 
      thought to be one of the most treatment refractory of all headache conditions.
      Little is known about this syndrome. It is unique in that the headache begins
      daily from onset, typically in a patient without a history of headache, and can
      continue for years without any sign of alleviation despite aggressive treatment. 
      This article discusses the epidemiology, diagnostic criteria, clinical
      characteristics, and treatment strategies for new daily persistent headache.

TI  - Pharmacotherapy for pain in rheumatologic conditions: the neuropathic component.
PG  - 197-205
AB  - Nociceptive and neuropathic types of pain occur in rheumatologic conditions. Most
      clinicians are familiar with the former, but many are not aware of the prevalence
      of the latter. The literature reports numerous examples of the occurrence of
      rheumatologic neuropathic pain, but little has been published on its management. 
      In this article, neuropathic and nociceptive pain in rheumatologic conditions are
      differentiated and treatment recommendations are discussed. Common rheumatologic 
      conditions and their pathophysiology in relation to pain mechanisms also are
      described. Pharmacotherapeutic recommendations for the treatment of both types of
      pain in the common rheumatologic conditions are presented.

TI  - Complex regional pain syndrome: a review of evidence-supported treatment options.
PG  - 188-96
AB  - Complex regional pain syndrome consists of pain and other symptoms that are
      unexpectedly severe or protracted after an injury. In type II complex regional
      pain syndrome, major nerve injury, often with motor involvement, is the cause; in
      complex regional pain syndrome I, the culprit is a more occult lesion, often a
      lesser injury that predominantly affects unmyelinated axons. In florid form,
      disturbances of vasoregulation (eg, edema) and abnormalities of other innervated 
      tissues (skin, muscle, bone) can appear. Because of these various symptoms and
      the difficulty in identifying causative lesions, complex regional pain syndrome
      is difficult to treat or cure. Complex regional pain syndrome has not been
      systematically investigated; there are few controlled treatment trials for
      established complex regional pain syndrome. This article reviews the existing
      studies (even if preliminary) to direct clinicians toward the best options.
      Treatments for other neuropathic pain syndromes that may be efficacious for
      complex regional pain syndrome also are discussed. Some common treatments (eg,
      local anesthetic blockade of sympathetic ganglia) are not supported by the
      aggregate of published studies and should be used less frequently. Other
      treatments with encouraging published results (eg, neural stimulators) are not
      used often enough. We hope to encourage clinicians to rely more on
      evidence-supported treatments for complex regional pain syndrome.

TI  - Pharmacotherapy of neuropathic low back pain.
PG  - 178-87
AB  - Neuropathic low back pain is examined from a structural standpoint,
      distinguishing processes that start from chronic inflammation and mechanical
      compromise and cross into the realm of neuropathy with primary neurogenic
      pathophysiology. The disease of chronic pain is discussed, examining peripheral
      and central changes in neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, and neuromolecular
      dynamics. The limitations of inadequate random controlled trials regarding
      long-term pharmacologic interventions are contrasted with excellent work in the
      basic science of chronic pain. Complex rational pharmacologic strategies for
      structural pathology, central pain processes, sites of medication action, and
      differing routes of administration are delineated.

TI  - Pharmacotherapy of painful diabetic neuropathy.
PG  - 169-77
AB  - The scope of this review is to describe the epidemiology, physiology,
      symptomatology, and treatment of diabetic painful neuropathy, which is a common
      complication of diabetes with significant morbidity. This article focuses on
      treatment options. Various clinical trials of several classes of medications (eg,
      antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and topical medications) and alternative
      treatments (eg, acupuncture, electrostimulation, magnets) are reviewed.
      Physicians have a large panel of medications that can be used effectively solely 
      or in combination at their disposal. However, a number of these treatments have
      significant side effects, which are noted, that limit their use. As the
      understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms of diabetic neuropathy improves,
      new medications are under investigation, which are reviewed in this article.
      There is great hope that the future may hold treatments that would prevent nerve 
      damage.

TI  - Quinine-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation: case report and review of
      the literature.
PG  - 1007-11
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical course of quinine-induced disseminated
      intravascular coagulation (DIC) and review all previous cases reported in the
      medical literature. DESIGN: Case report/literature review. SETTING: University
      teaching hospital medical ICU. PATIENTS: One patient in whom thrombocytopenia,
      coagulopathy, intravascular hemolysis, DIC, and acute renal failure temporally
      followed the ingestion of quinine. DATA SOURCES: We conducted a computerized
      free-text MEDLINE database search from 1969 to 2000 using the keywords quinine
      and thrombocytopenia, quinine and hemolytic-uremic syndrome, and quinine and
      disseminated intravascular coagulation. STUDY SELECTION: All reported cases and
      reviews of quinine-induced thrombocytopenia, hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), and
      DIC were reviewed. DIC was distinguished from quinine-induced thrombocytopenia or
      quinine-induced HUS based on the presence of abnormal clotting times, elevated
      fibrin degradation products, and/or elevated D-dimer levels. DATA SYNTHESIS:
      Fifteen previous patients were found to meet the criteria for DIC temporally
      related to the recent ingestion of quinine. The clinical course and laboratory
      abnormalities documented for each case are reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: Quinine-induced
      DIC is a distinct clinical entity, which may present as unexplained
      thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, or renal failure. In susceptible patients, the
      immune response to quinine may result in the production of not only anti-platelet
      antibodies but also antibodies against leukocytes, erythrocytes, and endothelial 
      cells. Furthermore, the varying patterns and specificities of antibody production
      in an individual patient may result in a spectrum of clinical disease from mild, 
      transient thrombocytopenia to overt intravascular hemolysis, renal failure,
      coagulopathy, and DIC. Early recognition of quinine-induced DIC is paramount, as 
      this diagnosis affords a better prognosis than other adult forms of HUS or DIC.

AB  - Psychiatric disturbances are a common feature of Parkinson's disease (PD), which 
      is a degenerative disorder defined by its characteristic movement abnormalities. 
      Its management is optimal when PD is viewed as a neuropsychiatric disorder,
      because this encourages consideration of the motor deficits along with its
      psychiatric and cognitive aspects. This review addresses the diagnosis and
      treatment of the most common psychiatric disorders in PD, and provides an update 
      of related clinical research, including studies on neurosurgical treatments.

AB  - Pain is a common complaint of older adults. Persistent pain has a significant
      negative impact on elderly individuals' sense of well being, physical function,
      and quality of life. Increasing age and cognitive impairment are risk factors for
      undertreatment of persistent pain. Safe and effective therapy is available for
      pain syndromes that commonly affect older adults. Recognition of failure of
      health providers to appropriately assess and manage persistent pain has led to
      the recent development and adoption of regulatory guidelines for the
      implementation of effective pain management programs.

TI  - An open-label study of levetiracetam at individualised doses between 1000 and
      3000 mg day(-1) in adult patients with refractory epilepsy.
PG  - 141-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The novel antiepileptic drug (AED) levetiracetam (LEV, Keppra) is
      indicated as adjunctive therapy for partial epilepsy. The primary aim of this
      study was to measure the safety and tolerability of LEV individualised dosing in 
      a heterogeneous refractory epilepsy population. METHODS: LEV was evaluated in a
      10- to 16-week open-label, multicentre study in adult patients with epilepsy
      refractory to previous treatment with at least two AEDs. Individualised LEV doses
      up to 3000 mg x day(-1) were determined in an initial up-titration phase, and
      optimal doses were administered as adjunctive treatment during an 8- to 10-week
      evaluation period. Concomitant AEDs and their doses could not be changed during
      the study. Safety and tolerability were monitored by expression of adverse events
      as well as by retention rate. The effect of LEV on concomitant AED concentration 
      was also studied. Efficacy was assessed using global clinical evaluation (GCE)
      scores, seizure frequency, and >or=50% responder rate. RESULTS: LEV therapy was
      initiated in 219 patients; 183 had localisation-related epilepsy and 37 had
      generalised epilepsy. In one patient, epileptic syndrome was defined as both
      localisation-related and generalised. About 81.7% (179/219) continued and
      completed treatment throughout the study, and 79% (172/219) chose to continue LEV
      in a follow-up study. The most common adverse events were asthenia, dizziness,
      and somnolence. Most adverse events occurred during up-titration. LEV treatment
      did not alter the concentration of concomitant AEDs. LEV improved GCE scores in
      79.5% (152/191) of patients. LEV reduced the median total seizure frequency of
      all patients from a median of 2.25 seizures per week at baseline (n=219) to 1.10 
      seizures per week during the evaluation period (n=191 patients with at least one 
      seizure count during evaluation). The >or=50% responder rate was 48.2% for all
      seizure types, 49.4% for partial-onset, and 51.4% for generalised-onset seizures.
      Throughout the evaluation period (i.e. from the start of the evaluation period
      until completion or early discontinuation), 26/191 (13.6%) had a 100% reduction
      in total seizure frequency, while in a follow-up study, 10.5% (18/172) were
      seizure-free for at least 6 months and 6.4% (11/172) were seizure-free for at
      least 1 year. CONCLUSION: LEV was well tolerated, as evidenced by limited adverse
      event reporting and the high retention rate, and appeared effective in both
      generalised and partial epilepsy.

TI  - Spasticity in multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 66-70
AB  - The objective of this article is to establish the prevalence of spasticity in a
      random selection of people with multiple sclerosis (MS) in the city of Newcastle 
      upon Tyne in the Northeast of England. A secondary aim was to assess the adequacy
      of current pharmacological intervention for spasticity and assess the
      relationship between spasticity and overall disability. The study design was a
      simple comparison that examined differences in functional independence in 2
      random groups of people with MS subdivided by the presence of clinically
      significant spasticity. A total of 68 adults with a diagnosis of clinically
      definite MS were included in the study. Their level of functional independence
      was assessed using the Newcastle Independence Assessment Form (NIAF), the
      Functional Independence Measure (FIM), and the Kurtzke Extended Disability Status
      Scale (EDSS). Spasticity was assessed using the Modified Ashworth Scale. A
      subjective analysis was made of the appropriateness of oral antispastic
      medication by a rehabilitation physician. Thirty-two people (47%) had clinically 
      significant spasticity (Modified Ashworth Score of 2, 3, or 4). Seventy-eight
      percent of the population were receiving some oral antispastic medication, but
      50% were deemed to require some drug adjustment or additional treatment.
      Individuals with spasticity were found to have significantly higher levels of
      disability than those who had no spasticity or clinically insignificant
      spasticity. This study has confirmed that spasticity is highly prevalent in the
      MS population and is significantly associated with a reduced level of functional 
      independence. Treatment of spasticity is suboptimal in a large proportion of the 
      population, and the need for further information and education to health
      professionals and to people with MS is highlighted.

TI  - Medical therapy for chronic pancreatitis pain.
PG  - 110-6
AB  - Chronic pancreatitis should be considered in all patients with unexplained
      abdominal pain. Management of abdominal pain in these patients continues to pose 
      a formidable challenge. The importance of small duct disease without radiographic
      abnormalities is now a well-established concept. It is meaningful to determine
      whether patients with chronic pancreatitis have small duct or large duct disease 
      because this distinction has therapeutic implications. Diagnostic evaluation
      should begin with simple noninvasive and inexpensive tests like serum trypsinogen
      and fecal elastase, to be followed where appropriate by more complicated measures
      such as the secretin hormone stimulation test, especially in patients with
      suspected small duct disease. No universal causal treatment is available.
      Non-enteric-coated enzyme preparations are useful for treatment of pain, whereas 
      enteric-coated enzyme preparations are preferred for steatorrhea. Octreotide is
      used increasingly for abdominal pain that is unresponsive to pancreatic enzyme
      therapy. When medical therapy for chronic pancreatitis pain has failed,
      endoscopic therapy, endoscopic ultrasound-guided celiac plexus block, and
      thoracoscopic splanchnicectomy, performed by experts, may be considered for a
      highly selected patient population. Surgical ductal decompression is appropriate 
      in patients with considerable pancreatic ductal dilation. The role and efficacy
      of cholecystokinin-receptor antagonists, antioxidants, and antidepressant drugs
      remain to be defined.

TI  - Psychopathologies in patients with nonepileptic seizures with and without
      comorbid epilepsy: how different are they?
PG  - 13-8
AB  - The underlying psychopathology in patients with nonepileptic seizures (NES) is
      diverse and poorly understood. The prevalence of epilepsy in NES patients is
      higher than in the general population, so epilepsy can be understood as a risk
      factor for NES. The question emerges if psychopathology differs in NES patients
      with and without epilepsy. Retrospective data concerning psychopathology and
      personality in both groups show two differences: (1) somatoform disorders are
      more prevalent in NES-only patients and (2) personality disorders are more
      typical in NES patients with epilepsy and resemble the pattern of psychopathology
      found in epilepsy-only patients. If true, then NES in epilepsy patients may be
      associated with an epilepsy condition. Consequently, in studies of
      psychopathology in epilepsy patients, patients with comorbid nonepileptic
      seizures have to be included.

TI  - Long-term intrathecal baclofen therapy for severe spasticity of cerebral origin.
PG  - 291-5
AB  - OBJECT: The goal of this study was to ascertain the long-term effectiveness and
      safety of intrathecal baclofen (ITB) in the treatment of spasticity of cerebral
      origin in children and young adults. METHODS: A prospective, multicenter study
      was conducted in 68 patients who had been enrolled in the initial evaluation of
      ITB therapy and were willing to participate in long-term surveillance.
      Seventy-three percent of the patients were younger than 16 years of age at the
      time of study entry. The patients were examined at least every 3 months and were 
      observed for an average of 70 months. At each follow-up visit, spasticity in the 
      upper and lower extremities was evaluated by applying Ashworth scores. All
      adverse events and complications were recorded on standardized data forms.
      Spasticity in both upper and lower extremities decreased significantly (p <
      0.005) and remained decreased up to 10 years. The dosage of ITB increased from a 
      mean of 157 microg/day 3 months after pump insertion to 300 microg/day at 2 years
      postimplantation, and remained relatively stable thereafter. There were no
      significant differences in ITB dosage in children of different ages. Adverse
      events potentially related to ITB therapy occurred in 50% of patients within 2
      months after pump insertion and in 50% of patients thereafter; hypotonia and
      lethargy were the two most common adverse events. The most common complications
      of surgery were catheter-related problems (31%), seromas (24%), and cerebrospinal
      fluid leaks (15%). CONCLUSIONS: Intrathecal baclofen provides effective long-term
      treatment of spasticity of cerebral origin and its effects do not appear to
      diminish with time. This therapy is frequently associated with adverse side
      effects that usually can be alleviated by adjustments in dosage.

TI  - Gabapentin effect on neuropathic pain compared among patients with spinal cord
      injury and different durations of symptoms.
PG  - 341-6; discussion 346-7
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: This study evaluated the effect of gabapentin on neuropathic pain
      in patients with spinal cord injury. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of
      gabapentin on neuropathic pain refractory to conventional analgesics in patients 
      with spinal cord injury and different durations of symptoms. SUMMARY OF
      BACKGROUND DATA: Neuropathic pain in patients with spinal cord injury severely
      compromises their quality of life. Gabapentin is a new antiepileptic drug that
      may additionally have a role in the treatment of neuropathic pain. So far, there 
      has been little prospective research investigating the effect of gabapentin on
      neuropathic pain in patients after spinal cord injury or comparing
      gabapentin-treated patients with varying durations of symptoms after spinal cord 
      injury. METHODS: The study included 31 patients who had experienced neuropathic
      pain associated with spinal cord injury or cauda equina syndrome. These subjects 
      were divided into two groups. Group 1 (n = 13) was composed of patients whose
      duration of pain was less than 6 months, and Group 2 (n = 18) comprised patients 
      whose symptoms of neuropathic pain had lasted more than 6 months. Although these 
      patients had been treated with conventional analgesics such as antidepressants,
      anticonvulsants, membrane stabilizer, and neuroleptics, they reported that their 
      condition did not improve after a medication trial of at least 2 weeks duration. 
      In this study, conventional analgesics were continued at a therapeutic level, and
      gabapentin was administrated for an 18-day titration period followed by a 5-week 
      maintenance period at a dosage of 1800 mg/day or the maximum tolerable dosage.
      The efficacy of gabapentin administration was gauged by a pain score and a sleep 
      interference score using a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS) every 2 weeks. The 
      scores of the two groups were compared every 2 weeks over the course of the
      8-week study. RESULTS: The mean pain score and the mean sleep interference score 
      for Group 1 decreased more than that of Group 2 during the interval between 2 to 
      8 weeks (P < 0.05). The mean pain score for Group 1 decreased from 7.3 +/- 0.5
      initially to 3 +/- 0.6 after 8 weeks of treatment, whereas the corresponding
      score for Group 2 decreased from 7.6 +/- 0.4 to 5.1 +/- 0.6 ( < 0.05). The mean
      sleep interference score for Group 1 decreased from 5.7 +/- 0.9 initially to 1.8 
      +/- 0.8 after 8 weeks of treatment, whereas the corresponding score for Group 2
      decreased from 5.9 +/- 0.8 to 4.2 +/- 0.7 (P < 0.05). As compared with the onset 
      of this study, a decrease in pain score of 2 or more was reported at the
      completion of this study for 11 patients (100%) in Group 1 and 10 (71%) of 14
      patients in Group 2. A decrease of 2 or more in sleep interference scores was
      reported for 8 (89%) of 9 patients with sleep interference in Group 1 and for 8
      (62%) of 13 patients with sleep interference in Group 2. Some adverse effects
      such as somnolence were noted, but they were mild or moderate in intensity.
      CONCLUSIONS: Gabapentin may be effective in decreasing neuropathic pain
      refractory to conventional analgesics in some patients with spinal cord injury
      whose duration of symptoms is less than 6 months, although those with duration of
      symptoms longer than 6 months showed a significant decrease as well. The drug is 
      unlikely to cause serious adverse effects that limit its use in patients with
      spinal cord injury.

TI  - Pharmacotherapeutics for osteoporosis prevention and treatment.
PG  - 39-52
AB  - Osteoporosis is a silent disease that affects 10 million Americans; 80% of those 
      affected are women. Although the disease is more common in postmenopausal
      Caucasian women, all ages and races are at risk. Osteoporosis can be a
      debilitating disease that can cause pain, fractures, depression, and social
      withdrawal. Signs of osteoporosis include kyphosis, loss of height, and
      protrusion of the abdomen. Because symptoms generally do not occur until after
      the disease has progressed, clinicians should include osteoporosis screening and 
      preventative education as part of the regular gynecologic care. Diagnosis is
      typically made by a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan. Treatment
      consists of dietary and lifestyle changes, along with pharmacologic intervention.
      Although hormone therapy has been shown to be effective in preventing
      osteoporosis, the risks of long-term treatment with HRT are discussed. The
      following effective treatment options for women who have been diagnosed with the 
      disease are discussed: bisphosphonates, calcitonin, and selective estrogen
      receptor modulators (SERMs). Because midwives regularly care for women of all
      ages, they are ideal candidates to provide women with preventative education,
      screening, counseling, and treatment.

TI  - The role of anticonvulsants in preventive migraine therapy.
PG  - 63-6
AB  - The mainstay of migraine treatment is pharmacotherapy. There have been numerous
      medications used to prevent migraine headaches, including b-blockers,
      calcium-channel blockers, anticonvulsants, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs. Sodium valproate is the only antiepileptic drug approved by the Food and
      Drug Administration for migraine prevention. Newer antiepileptics, including
      gabapentin and topiramate, are being evaluated for their role in preventive
      therapy. The mechanism of action of antiepileptics is not fully understood, but
      they all share a common role in enhancing gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated
      inhibition. This article reviews the role of anticonvulsants in preventive
      migraine therapy.

TI  - Toward estimating the impact of changes in immigrants' insurance eligibility on
      hospital expenditures for uncompensated care.
PG  - 1
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act
      (PRWORA) of 1996 gave states the option to withdraw Medicaid coverage of
      nonemergency care from most legal immigrants. Our goal was to assess the effect
      of PRWORA on hospital uncompensated care in the United States. METHODS: We
      collected the following state-level data for the period from 1994 through 1999:
      foreign-born, noncitizen population and health uninsurance rates (US Census
      Current Population Survey); percentage of teaching hospitals (American Hospital
      Association Annual Survey of Hospitals); and each state's decision whether to
      implement the PRWORA Medicaid bar for legal permanent residents or to continue
      offering nonemergency Medicaid coverage using state-only funds (Urban Institute).
      We modeled uncompensated care expenditures by state (also from the Annual Survey 
      of Hospitals) in both univariate and multivariable regression analyses. RESULTS: 
      When measured at the state level, there was no significant relationship between
      uncompensated care expenditures and states' percentage of noncitizen immigrants. 
      Uninsurance rates were the only significant factor in predicting uncompensated
      hospital care expenditures by state. CONCLUSIONS: Reducing the number of
      uninsured patients would most surely reduce hospital expenditures for
      uncompensated care. However, data limitations hampered our efforts to obtain a
      monetary estimate of hospitals' financial losses due specifically to the
      immigrant eligibility changes in PRWORA. Quantifying the impact of these
      provisions on hospitals will require better data sources.

TI  - Recent advances in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis research.
PG  - 70-7
AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common motor neuron disease in
      adults. Despite several genetic breakthroughs, the actual cause and mechanism of 
      neurodegeneration in ALS remains a mystery. Nevertheless, recent scientific and
      clinical advances have led to the development of new therapeutic strategies for
      this progressive, fatal disorder. We review the progress of the most recent
      clinical trials in ALS, taking into account some of the hurdles encountered by
      these studies. We also discuss the potential role of retroviral infection as a
      cause or contributor to ALS, which is one of the most recent hypotheses for the
      pathogenesis of the disease. The genetic background of ALS is summarized and
      special attention is given to the newly identified ALS gene ALS2, and to those
      that are currently being investigated. The last part of this review is dedicated 
      to the mutation in superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1). The hypothesized deleterious
      mechanisms of mutant SOD1 are discussed, as well as the possibilities that the
      mutant protein activates the apoptotic cell death process and that these
      molecular alterations can be exploited to devise experimental neuroprotective
      therapies.

TI  - Intensive care management of ischemic stroke.
PG  - 32-9
AB  - The practice of neurointensive care was initially developed to manage
      postoperative neurosurgical patients and expanded thereafter to the management of
      patients with primary head trauma, intracranial hemorrhage, vasospasm after
      subarachnoid hemorrhage, elevated intracranial pressure, and unstable pulmonary
      or cardiovascular medical conditions in neurologic patients. Can neurointensive
      care with its advanced medical and neurologic resources improve the outcome of
      the ischemic stroke patient? This review discusses selection of patients
      appropriate for admission to the neurologic intensive care unit (NICU) and
      current options for the intensive care management of severe ischemic stroke and
      its attendant complications. We propose that the NICU team is well suited to
      acute stroke management if they apply their advanced skills and technologic
      resources to manage the severe stroke patient from the time of presentation to
      the emergency ward. Study is needed to determine the effect that a critical care 
      level of service has on functional outcome.

TI  - Neuroprotective agents for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke.
PG  - 9-20
AB  - Neuroprotective treatments are therapies designed to interrupt the cellular,
      biochemical, and metabolic elaboration of injury during or following exposure to 
      ischemia; they encompass a rapidly expanding array of pharmacologic
      interventions. Various classes of neuroprotective agents have reached phase III
      efficacy trials in focal ischemic stroke, but none has proven effective, despite 
      successful preceding animal studies. This notwithstanding, recent favorable
      results of hypothermia in human cardiac arrest trials have validated the general 
      concept of neuroprotection. In addition, the promise of neuroprotective therapy
      for focal acute ischemic stroke has been renewed by innovations in strategies of 
      preclinical drug development and clinical trial design that rectify past defects,
      including trial testing of combination therapies rather than single agents and
      novel approaches to accelerating time to initiation of experimental treatment.

TI  - Gabapentin in late-onset poststroke seizures.
PG  - 1991-3
AB  - Stroke is a frequent cause of epileptic seizures (ES) in adults. The authors
      evaluated the long-term efficacy and tolerability of gabapentin (900 to 1,800
      mg/day) in 71 patients with a first poststroke late ES during a mean follow-up
      time of 30 months. ES recurred in 18.3% of the patients and side effects were
      noted in 27 cases (38%), but only two (2.8%) required discontinuation or early
      withdrawal. Gabapentin monotherapy was useful and safe for late poststroke ES.

TI  - Stroke and status epilepticus: stroke type, type of status epilepticus, and
      prognosis.
PG  - 23-7
AB  - Even though stroke is known to be a common cause of status epilepticus (SE), the 
      types of stroke or SE that may be associated are not yet clearly defined. The
      aims of this study were to assess the timing and type of SE in stroke patients
      and to observe the effects of stroke and the type of SE on the response to
      treatment and mortality. From May 1998 to May 2001 a total of 121 patients were
      admitted with SE. Among these, 30 cases (24.8%) of poststroke SE were identified 
      and evaluated. There were 20 early-onset, and 10 late-onset SE. All stroke types 
      were evenly distributed within the early-onset group, whereas only ischaemic
      stroke was found in the late-onset group. Posterior cerebral artery (PCA)
      infarcts were significantly more common within the latter (P: 0.0017).
      Nonconvulsive SE (NCS) was more frequent than convulsive SE (CS) in the
      early-onset group (P: 0.0352). There was a delay in the time-to-treatment for NCS
      compared to CS (P: 0.0007). Without, however any effect on the rate of response
      to first step treatment (intravenous diazepam and phenytoin; P: 0.6334). Thirteen
      patients died (43.3%) during hospitalisation. Disability was significantly
      associated with higher mortality in the early-onset group (P: 0.0201). As a
      conclusion, NCS seems to be an important issue in stroke, thus requiring a high
      degree of suspicion in an acute stroke setting to avoid further neuronal injury
      and morbidity.

TI  - Management strategies for the treatment of neuropathic pain in the elderly.
PG  - 929-45
AB  - Pain caused by dysfunction or damage to the peripheral or central nervous system 
      is typified by the symptoms described by patients with painful diabetic
      neuropathy, post-herpetic neuralgia and central poststroke pain. All these
      conditions are more common in the elderly. Neuropathic pain has long been
      recognised as one of the more difficult types of pain to treat; however, with the
      current emphasis on providing a multidisciplinary assessment and approach to
      management, more patients will be offered relief of their symptoms and an
      improved quality of life. Despite the use of combination drug therapy, adequate
      pain relief in the elderly is difficult to achieve without adverse effects. In an
      attempt to minimise these it is important to include non-drug treatment options
      in the management plan. Lifestyle changes and environmental modification,
      together with encouragement to adopt an appropriate exercise programme and an
      emphasis on maintaining mobility and independence should always be considered.
      Interventional therapy ranging from simple nerve blocks to intrathecal drug
      delivery can be of value. Drug treatment remains the mainstay of therapy.
      Tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline, while having significant adverse
      effects in the elderly, have a number needed to treat (NNT) of 3.5 for 50% pain
      relief in diabetic neuropathy and 2.1 for 50% pain relief in postherpetic
      neuralgia. The newer antiepileptic drugs, such as gabapentin, appear to have a
      better adverse effect profile and provide similar efficacy with the NNT for
      treating painful diabetic neuropathy being 3.7 and 3.2 for treating pain in
      postherpetic neuralgia. As our understanding of the complexities of the pain
      processes increases, we are becoming more able to appropriately combine
      treatments to achieve not only improved pain relief but also improved function.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of antiepileptic drugs in migraine prophylaxis.
PG  - 978-83
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the cost-effectiveness of antiepileptics in migraine
      prophylaxis. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using efficacy 
      data from three recent, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trials of
      antiepileptic drugs studied for migraine prevention and cost data. Two measures
      of cost-effectiveness were used: cost per headache prevented and the
      cost-equivalent number. RESULTS: In the double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      clinical trials evaluated, three antiepileptic drugs were shown to be effective
      in migraine prevention. All three antiepileptic drugs had high costs per migraine
      reduced. Gabapentin was the most costly at dollars 138.00 per migraine prevented,
      whereas the cost per migraine prevented with topiramate was US dollars 114.80 and
      with divalproex sodium was US dollars 48.00. For migraine prevention divalproex
      sodium became cost-effective with 10 migraines per month, whereas gabapentin and 
      topiramate required considerably more migraines per month to be cost-effective.
      CONCLUSIONS: Antiepileptic drugs have proven effectiveness in migraine
      prophylaxis. However, in patients responsive to their acute care medications, the
      antiepileptic drugs are only cost-effective for those patients with a high
      frequency of migraines and those with comorbid diseases. Future studies should be
      done with antiepileptic drugs in patients exhibiting a migraine frequency of 10
      or more headaches per month.

TI  - [Effectiveness and safety of gabapentin in the preventive treatment of migraine].
PG  - 603-6
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Migraine is a frequent and disabling pathological condition with
      important socioeconomic repercussions. Recent studies have explored the use of
      antiepileptic drugs in the prophylactic treatment of migraine. Preliminary
      studies have shown that gabapentin is a drug that is effective and well tolerated
      by patients. AIM. To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of gabapentin in the
      prophylactic treatment of migraine. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective, open,
      multicentre, random clinical study, carried out according to IHS criteria, which 
      compares the effectiveness and safety of gabapentin in 1,200 mg/day and 2,000
      mg/day doses as a preventive treatment for migraine over a 16 week period.
      RESULTS: Significant differences were found in patients treated with gabapentin, 
      as compared with their basal state, in the following: a lower number of attacks
      (reduction in weeks 4, 10 and 16: 2.4 2.8, 2.9 2.9 and 3.1 2.9 attacks/month on a
      basal rate of 5.3 3.5 attacks/month), lower intensity (on a scale of 0 3 of
      increasing pain intensity: basal rate: 2.7 0.4, week 4: 1.8 0.9, week 10: 1.7
      0.9, week 16: 1.4 1.0) and how long the pain lasts (basal rate 390 hours/month,
      week 4: 180 hours/month, week 10: 180 hours/month, week 16: 120 hours/month). No 
      statistically significant differences were found between doses of 1,200 or 2,000 
      mg/day. Mild adverse effects were seen in 62 patients (37.8%): drowsiness
      (22.6%), asthenia (7.9%), dizziness (4.9%), abdominal pain (3.7%) and dazedness
      (3.7%). No serious adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Gabapentin can be
      considered an effective and safe drug in the preventive treatment of migraine.

TI  - Atovaquone + proguanil: new preparation. Second-line antimalarial combination.
PG  - 131-6
AB  - (1) Quinine, halofantrine and mefloquine are effective treatments for most cases 
      of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. (2) The choice of drug for
      prevention of P. falciparum malaria in highly endemic regions depends on the risk
      of chloroquine resistance, and possibly mefloquine resistance. The reference
      treatments are the chloroquine + proguanil combination, and mefloquine. (3)
      Marketing authorisation has been granted in France for the atovaquone + proguanil
      combination, in curative and preventive treatment of P. falciparum malaria. (4)
      The efficacy of the atovaquone + proguanil combination in uncomplicated malaria
      is similar to that of other treatments. Some strains of malaria seem to have
      reduced sensitivity. (5) The atovaquone + proguanil combination is also effective
      as prophylaxis, but there are no clinical trials showing whether it is equivalent
      to or better than other preventive treatments in non immune travellers. (6)
      According to the French licensing terms, atovaquone + proguanil prophylaxis can
      be stopped 7 days after leaving an endemic area, rather than 3-4 weeks with other
      drugs. This recommendation is based on weak evidence: mainly on theoretical
      arguments and on the absence of clinical malaria in some patients with evidence
      of P. falciparum infection. (7) The atovaquone + proguanil combination is less
      effective against other Plasmodium species (P. malariae, P. ovale and P. vivax). 
      Chloroquine remains the reference treatment for these forms of malaria, which do 
      not carry a risk of serious complications. (8) There were few adverse events in
      people taking the atovaquone + proguanil combination during clinical trials.
      During curative treatment, this combination caused more nausea and vomiting than 
      reference treatments, while, in the prophylactic setting, it had slightly fewer
      adverse effects than the chloroquine + proguanil combination or mefloquine alone.
      But the drop out rate was not significantly different between treatment groups.
      (9) Atovaquone should be taken with food, to improve absorption. (10) The
      atovaquone + proguanil combination is expensive and is not refunded in France. In
      contrast, curative treatment with quinine is cheap, and is fully refunded. (11)
      Mefloquine and quinine remain the treatments of choice for uncomplicated malaria 
      where there is chloroquine resistance. The atovaquone + proguanil combination is 
      useful if mefloquine and quinine are contraindicated; unlike halofantrine, this
      combination does not carry the risk of serious drug interactions. In the
      prophylactic setting, the lack of experience with atovaquone means it should only
      be used as a second line option, after mefloquine, for short-term prophylaxis in 
      areas with a high prevalence of chloroquine resistance.

TI  - An open-label trial of divalproex in children and adolescents with bipolar
      disorder.
PG  - 1224-30
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the safety and effectiveness of divalproex sodium
      (Depakote ) in the treatment of youths with bipolar disorder. METHOD: Forty
      bipolar disorder patients aged 7 to 19 years, with a manic, hypomanic, or mixed
      episode, enrolled in an open-label study of divalproex (2-8 weeks), followed by a
      double-blind, placebo-controlled period (8 weeks). RESULTS: Twenty-two subjects
      (61%) showed > or =50% improvement in Mania Rating Scale (MRS) scores during the 
      open-label period. Significant ( <.001) improvements from baseline were seen for 
      mean scores of all efficacy measures, including the MRS, Manic Syndrome Scale,
      Behavior and Ideation Scale, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, Clinical Global
      Impressions Severity scale, and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Of the 23
      subjects who discontinued the study during the open-label period, 6 (15%)
      discontinued for ineffectiveness, 6 (15%) for intolerance, 6 (15%) for
      noncompliance, and 6 (15%) for other reasons. Adverse events were generally mild 
      or moderate in severity, with the most common being headache, nausea, vomiting,
      diarrhea, and somnolence. Laboratory data results were unremarkable. Too few
      subjects participated in the double-blind period for statistical analysis.
      CONCLUSION: This study provides preliminary support for the safety and
      effectiveness of divalproex in the treatment of bipolar disorder in youths.

TI  - The analgesic effect of gabapentin and mexiletine after breast surgery for
      cancer.
PG  - 985-91, table of contents
AB  - We investigated the analgesic efficacy of mexiletine and gabapentin on acute and 
      chronic pain associated with cancer breast surgery in 75 patients. They were
      randomized to receive, in a double-blinded manner, mexiletine 600 mg/d,
      gabapentin 1200 mg/d, or placebo for 10 days. Anesthesia was standardized, and
      all patients had access to routine postoperative analgesics on demand. The visual
      analog scale score assessed pain at rest and after movement. Three months later, 
      all patients were interviewed to identify intensity of chronic pain and analgesic
      requirements. Mexiletine and gabapentin reduced codeine consumed from the second 
      to tenth day by 50% (P = 0.029; P = 0.018 and P = 0.035 for mexiletine versus
      control and gabapentin versus control comparisons, respectively). Total
      paracetamol consumption was also reduced during the same time (P = 0.0085; P =
      0.007 and P = 0.011 for the mexiletine and gabapentin groups when compared with
      the control, respectively). Pain at rest and after movement was reduced by both
      drugs on the third postoperative day. Pain after movement also was reduced by
      gabapentin between the second and fifth postoperative day. Three months later,
      the incidence of chronic pain, its intensity, and need for analgesics were not
      affected by either treatment. However, burning pain was more frequent in the
      control group (P = 0.033). IMPLICATIONS: Patients undergoing breast surgery for
      cancer may develop chronic pain. We evaluated the effect of mexiletine and
      gabapentin on the acute and chronic pain after breast surgery for cancer. Both
      drugs reduced the postoperative analgesic requirements, and particularly,
      gabapentin reduced pain after movement. The overall incidence of chronic pain was
      unaffected except for burning pain.

TI  - Transnational industrial power, the medical profession and the regulatory state: 
      adverse drug reactions and the crisis over the safety of Halcion in the
      Netherlands and the UK.
PG  - 1671-90
AB  - Taking the controversy over the safety of the hypnotic, Halcion, in the
      Netherlands and the UK, as a case study, this article examines the problems for
      public health associated with responses to warnings about drug hazards by
      regulatory agencies, governmental expert advisers, the pharmaceutical industry
      and the medical profession. It is argued that regulators and the medical
      profession rely too heavily on manufacturers to investigate warnings from
      doctors' spontaneous reporting of adverse effects of drug products on the market.
      It is demonstrated that a pharmaceutical firm's commitment to search effectively 
      for evidence against the safety of its own product in order to confirm doctors'
      warnings can have severe limitations. Deficiencies in the socio-institutional
      responses to post-market 'early warning systems' about drug hazards imply that
      the regulatory policies of 'early licensing' and minimal pre-market checks for
      new drugs are misconceived and threaten public health. To improve public
      protection from drug injury, the regulators should abandon their conviction that 
      compelling evidence of drug hazards are required to confirm doctors' warning
      signals prior to regulatory intervention. Instead, they should adopt a policy of 
      measured regulatory intervention as an immediate response to warning signals,
      while investigators, independent of the manufacturers, assess the significance of
      the signal.

TI  - Severe renal bleeding caused by a ruptured renal sheath: case report of a rare
      complication of percutaneous nephrolithotomy.
PG  - 10
AB  - BACKGROUND: Percutaneous nephrolithotomy is a minimally invasive intervention for
      renal stone disease. Complications, which are rare and usually presented as case 
      reports, are diversified as the utilization of the procedure is expanded. The
      procedure causes less blood loss and less morbidity when compared to open
      surgical procedures. Yet, there are some reports involving severe bleeding and
      relevant morbidity during surgery. These are usually related with the surgical
      technique or experience of the surgeon. Renal sheaths are designed to cause
      minimal trauma inside the kidney and, to our knowledge, there are no reports
      presenting the rupture of a sheath causing severe bleeding during the procedure. 
      CASE REPORT: We present an adult patient who had severe bleeding during
      percutaneous nephrolithotomy due to parenchymal injury caused by a ruptured renal
      sheath. During retrieval, due probably to rough handling of the equipment, a
      piece of stone with serrated edges ruptured the tip of the sheath, and this tip
      caused damage inside the kidney. The operation was terminated and measures were
      taken to control bleeding. The patient was transfused with a total of 1600 ml of 
      blood, and the stones were cleared in a second look operation. CONCLUSION:
      Although considered to be a minimally invasive procedure, some unexpected
      complications may arise during percutaneous nephrolithotomy. After being
      fragmanted, stone pieces may damage surgical equipment, causing acute and severe 
      harm to the kidney. Surgeons must manipulate the equipment with fine and careful 
      movements in order to prevent this situation.

TI  - Gabapentin in the treatment of neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury: a
      prospective, randomized, double-blind, crossover trial.
PG  - 100-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuropathic pain is a common complaint after traumatic spinal cord
      injury (SCI). Gabapentin, a synthetic structural analogue of GABA, has been shown
      to have beneficial effects in the treatment of neuropathic pain in other
      diagnostic groups; however, no standardized clinical trial has been performed to 
      evaluate its efficacy after SCI. DESIGN: A 10-week, prospective, randomized,
      double-blind, crossover, and placebo-controlled clinical trial. OBJECTIVE: To
      determine the efficacy of gabapentin in the treatment of SCI-related neuropathic 
      pain. METHODS: Seven subjects with neuropathic pain, who were more than 30 days
      post-SCI, completed the study. Two groups received a 4-week course of gabapentin 
      and placebo in a randomized crossover design with a 2-week washout period. The
      Neuropathic Pain Scale was used to record daily pain levels. Data were analyzed
      using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULTS: Gabapentin has some beneficial
      effects on certain types of neuropathic pain. There was a significant decrease of
      "unpleasant feeling" and a trend toward a decrease in both the "pain intensity"
      and "burning sensation" at the fourth week of gabapentin treatment compared with 
      those on the placebo. No significant difference was found among other pain
      descriptors during the gabapentin and placebo treatment, although this may have
      been limited by the small sample size and low maximum dosage of gabapentin.
      CONCLUSIONS: Gabapentin reduces certain types of neuropathic pain in the SCI
      population. Future studies with larger sample sizes, higher dosages, and quicker 
      titration will help further determine the efficacy of gabapentin in the treatment
      of SCI-related neuropathic pain.

TI  - Gabapentin suppresses cutaneous hyperalgesia following heat-capsaicin
      sensitization.
PG  - 102-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The anticonvulsant gabapentin, proven effective for neuropathic pain 
      in two large, placebo-controlled clinical trials, is widely used for treatment of
      chronic pain. Preclinical studies have demonstrated analgesic and antiallodynic
      effects in models involving neuronal sensitization and nerve injury, without
      affecting acute pain transmission. The aim of the present study was to link data 
      from animal models and clinical trials for chronic pain by investigating the
      effect of gabapentin on acute nociception and experimentally induced cutaneous
      hyperalgesia in healthy volunteers. METHODS: The human experimental hyperalgesia 
      model, the heat-capsaicin sensitization model, was induced in 25 healthy male
      volunteers. Subjects received oral gabapentin (1,200 mg) or placebo after
      heat-capsaicin sensitization was established on the forearm. The primary outcome 
      measures were the sizes of the areas of secondary hyperalgesia to von Frey hair
      and brush stimulation on the forearm. Secondary outcome measures were as follows:
      (1) size of secondary hyperalgesia area in response to brief thermal
      sensitization procedure on the thigh; (2) heat pain detection thresholds in
      normal and sensitized skin; and (3) painfulness of 1 min of 45 degrees C
      stimulation in normal skin. RESULTS: Oral gabapentin profoundly suppressed
      established cutaneous sensitization on the forearm and prevented development of
      cutaneous sensitization on the thigh. Thermal nociception in normal skin was
      unchanged. Side effects were modest. CONCLUSION: The results link preclinical
      findings with results from clinical trials of neuropathic pain. The results
      further suggest that gabapentin may prove effective in acute pain disorders
      involving neuronal sensitization, such as postoperative pain and acute herpetic
      pain, and could prove effective in prevention of chronic pain.

TI  - Effectiveness of quinine in treating muscle cramps: a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre trial.
PG  - 243-6
AB  - To determine the efficacy and safety of quinine in treating nocturnal muscle
      cramps we performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group,
      multicentre trial in 17 general practice centres in Germany. Ninety-eight
      patients aged 18-70 years with more than six muscle cramps in two weeks were
      enrolled. A two-week run-in period without treatment was followed by two weeks of
      treatment with 400 mg quinine or placebo per day and a wash-out period of two
      weeks without treatment. The primary outcome measure was the reduction in the
      number of muscle cramps between the run-in and treatment periods. The intensity
      of cramps, number of nights with cramps, sleep disturbance and intensity of pain 
      were recorded as secondary outcome measures. At baseline the median number of
      cramps was 12 in two weeks in both groups. The median reduction between the
      run-in and therapy phases was eight (95% CI 7-10) versus six (95% CI 3-7) muscle 
      cramps during quinine and placebo treatment; 36 (80%) participants in the quinine
      group and 26 (53%) in the placebo group had a reduction of at least 50% in the
      number of muscle cramps. Frequency, intensity and pain at night showed a
      statistically significant difference in favour of quinine. The improvement was
      more evident according to physician assessment than patient assessment; this is
      corroborated by the high placebo response rate. No significant differences were
      found between the two groups with respect to side-effects. Short term treatment
      with 400 mg quinine per day can effectively prevent nocturnal leg cramps in
      adults without relevant side-effects.

TI  - Evaluation of electromagnetic fields in the treatment of pain in patients with
      lumbar radiculopathy or the whiplash syndrome.
PG  - 63-7
AB  - Back pain and the whiplash syndrome are very common diseases involving tremendous
      costs and extensive medical effort. A quick and effective reduction of symptoms, 
      especially pain, is required. In two prospective randomized studies, patients
      with either lumbar radiculopathy in the segments L5/S1 or the whiplash syndrome
      were investigated. Inclusion criteria were as follows: either clinically verified
      painful lumbar radiculopathy in the segments L5/S1 and a Lasegue's sign of 30
      degrees (or more), or typical signs of the whiplash syndrome such as painful
      restriction of rotation and flexion/extension. Exclusion criteria were prolapsed 
      intervertebral discs, systemic neurological diseases, epilepsy, and pregnancy. A 
      total of 100 patients with lumbar radiculopathy and 92 with the whiplash syndrome
      were selected and entered in the study following a 1:1 ratio. Both groups
      (magnetic field treatment and controls) received standard medication consisting
      of diclofenac and tizanidine, while the magnetic field was only applied in group 
      1, twice a day, for a period of two weeks. In patients suffering from
      radiculopathy, the average time until pain relief and painless walking was 8.2
      +/- 0.5 days in the magnetic field group, and 11.7 +/- 0.5 days in controls p <
      0.04). In patients with the whiplash syndrome, pain was measured on a ten-point
      scale. Pain in the head was on average 4.6 before and 2.1 after treatment in
      those receiving magnetic field treatment, and 4.2/3.5 in controls. Neck pain was 
      on average 6.3/1.9 as opposed to 5.3/4.6, and pain in the shoulder/arm was
      2.4/0.8 as opposed to 2.8/2.2 (p < 0.03 for all regions). Hence, magnetic fields 
      appear to have a considerable and statistically significant potential for
      reducing pain in cases of lumbar radiculopathy and the whiplash syndrome.

TI  - Gabapentin: new indication. Little impact on partial epilepsy in children between
      3 and 12.
PG  - 47-8
AB  - (1) The standard treatment for partial epilepsy in children is carbamazepine. The
      efficacy of other antiepileptics has also been documented, either alone
      (phenobarbital, oxcarbazepine, valproate sodium, phenytoin), or in drug
      combinations (lamotrigine, topiramate). (2) A licence extension has been granted 
      in France for gabapentin in partial epilepsy in children aged 3 to 12 years, in
      combination with other antiepileptics. (3) The clinical file contains no data
      from trials comparing gabapentin with other antiepileptics. (4) The main
      double-blind trial involved 247 children who were treated either with their usual
      treatment + gabapentin or usual treatment + placebo. Gabapentin was only
      moderately effective, and the overall number of responders did not differ
      significantly between the gabapentin and placebo groups. (5) In this trial the
      main adverse effects among the children on their usual treatment + gabapentin
      were behavioural disorders (hostility and mood swings). (6) In practice, the
      licensing of gabapentin for children with partial epilepsy aged between 3 and 12 
      years changes nothing in their practical management.

TI  - Gastric phytobezoar associated with impaired gastric motility in a patient with
      spinal cord injury.
PG  - 43-5
AB  - Impaired gastrointestinal motility as a result of interruption of sympathetic
      outflow is a common occurrence in the spinal cord injury (SCI) population. In
      addition, frequent use of medications with anticholinergic properties in this
      population results in further impairment of peristalsis resulting in
      gastrointestinal stasis. Since SCI patients often lack sensation below the level 
      of injury, they may present with vague symptoms, which complicates the diagnosis 
      of intestinal obstruction. We report the first case of gastric phytobezoar in a
      patient with T4 ASIA A paraplegia who presented with vague upper abdominal
      discomfort, anorexia, weight loss, and vomiting. Because mortality rates can be
      as high as 30% if phytobezoars remain untreated, gastrointestinal phytobezoars
      should be considered in the differential diagnosis of abdominal discomfort in SCI
      patients. Etiologic factors for phytobezoars are discussed for the general
      population and in particular, for patients with SCI.

TI  - Autonomic dysreflexia in multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 40-2
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although autonomic dysreflexia (AD) is well documented in the spinal 
      cord injury (SCI) population, its occurrence in persons with multiple sclerosis
      (MS) is not. A dense multiple sclerotic lesion in the spinal cord at or above the
      sixth thoracic level can cause interruption of descending inhibitory impulses and
      thus result in AD. A patient with MS presented to our facility with classic signs
      and symptoms of AD. We believe that lack of knowledge about the risks for this
      condition in MS led to a delay in diagnosis. METHODS: Case report illustrates AD 
      in a person with MS. A convenience survey was conducted among clinicians who
      provide care to people with MS. The survey looked at both awareness of, and
      experience with, AD in MS. RESULTS: Forty-five percent of the respondents
      indicated they were not aware of the potential risk for AD among MS patients.
      Only 10% indicated they were aware of MS patients in their practice who had
      experienced AD. CONCLUSION: Although AD is probably less common in MS than in
      SCI, this case does not appear to be unique. Knowledge of this potential
      life-threatening complication of MS seems to be limited.

TI  - A summary of spasticity management--a treatment algorithm.
PG  - 48-52; dicussion 53-61
AB  - The muscle overactivity seen in spasticity results in limb stiffness and muscle
      spasm, to which there is both a neurogenic and a biomechanical component.
      Spasticity does not always cause harm and can assist in the rehabilitation
      process enabling a patient to stand when their limb weakness would not otherwise 
      allow it. When it does cause harm, however, treatment is required. This aims to
      (i) prevent provocative factors (ii) treat muscle overactivity; and (iii) prevent
      complications. Untreated, limb contracture, pain and other complications occur
      and early management can be most effective. Treatment is essentially physical,
      but, when this is inadequate, pharmacological intervention may be required. A
      strategy has been devised which shows that the first choice pharmacological
      treatment of focal spasticity is botulinum toxin. Over the past decade, the
      choice of treatment has become more ambitious with the establishment of new
      technologies. Good management now depends on an understanding of their role and
      application in relation to the needs of individual patients. To this end, a
      treatment algorithm which covers the salient facts in patient assessment and
      gives the indications for the range of available treatments, is the best
      approach. The indications and limitations of the available treatments are
      discussed, along with their place in the overall management of the patients. The 
      evidence base for much of what is done is not strong and this summary examines
      the activities of proven value and of consensus view.

TI  - Reliability of race assessment based on the race of the ascendants: a
      cross-sectional study.
PG  - 1
AB  - BACKGROUND: Race is commonly described in epidemiological surveys based on
      phenotypic characteristics. Training of interviewers to identify race is
      time-consuming and self identification of race might be difficult to interpret.
      The aim of this study was to determine the agreement between race definition
      based on the number of ascendants with black skin colour, with the
      self-assessment and observer's assessment of the skin colour. METHODS: In a
      cross-sectional study of 50 women aged 14 years or older, from an outpatient
      clinic of an University affiliated hospital, race was assessed through
      observation and the self-assignment of the colour of skin and by the number of
      black ascendants including parents and grandparents. Reliability was measured
      through Kappa coefficient. RESULTS: Agreement beyond chance between self-assigned
      and observed skin colour was excellent for white (0.75 95% CI 0.72-0.78) and
      black women (0.89 95% CI 0.71-0.79), but only good for participants with mixed
      colour (0.61 95% CI 0.58-0.64), resulting in a global kappa of 0.75 (95% CI
      0.71-0.79). However, only a good agreement for mixed women was obtained. The
      presence of 3 or more black ascendants was highly associated with observed and
      self-assessed black skin colour. Most women self-assigned or observed as white
      had no black ascendants. CONCLUSIONS: The assessment of race based on the race of
      ascendants showed reasonable agreement with the ascertainment done by trained
      interviewers and with the self-report of race. This method may be considered for 
      evaluation of race in epidemiological surveys, since it is less time-consuming
      than the evaluation by interviewers.

TI  - Oxcarbazepine: new preparation. An alternative to carbamazepine in partial
      epilepsy.
PG  - 170-4
AB  - (1) The reference treatment for partial epilepsy in adults and children is
      carbamazepine. (2) Oxcarbazepine is available in the European Union for the
      treatment of partial epilepsy in adults and children aged over 6 years, alone or 
      in combination with other antiepileptic drugs. (3) The clinical file on
      oxcarbazepine monotherapy of recent-onset generalised or partial epilepsy mainly 
      contains data from one trial versus carbamazepine, two trials versus phenytoin,
      and one trial versus valproate sodium. In these trials, 52-60% of patients had no
      seizures on oxcarbazepine, a proportion not significantly different from that
      obtained with the comparators. Oxcarbazepine may, in fact, be slightly less
      effective than carbamazepine. (4) For refractory partial epilepsy (especially
      forms refractory to carbamazepine), oxcarbazepine is more effective than a
      placebo, when combined with the inadequately effective treatment, as shown in two
      trials. Two dose-finding studies show that 2 400 mg/day oxcarbazepine is more
      effective than 300 mg/day. (5) In trials comparing single-drug treatments there
      were fewer withdrawals for adverse events among patients on oxcarbazepine than
      among those on carbamazepine or phenytoin. Compared with carbamazepine, the risk 
      of cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions seems to be lower with oxcarbazepine,
      while the risk of hyponatraemia is higher. This risk of hyponatraemia
      necessitates laboratory monitoring. (6) The risk of clinically significant
      interactions appears to be lower on oxcarbazepine than on carbamazepine, and is
      limited mainly to combined contraceptives (contraceptive inefficacy) and
      phenytoin. (7) In practice, carbamazepine remains the reference treatment for
      partial epilepsy, but oxcarbazepine is one of several second-line options, either
      alone or in combination with other antiepileptics.

TI  - Open antero-lateral dislocation of the elbow. A case report.
PG  - 1
AB  - BACKGROUND: Open dislocations are infrequent, often associated with damage to the
      neuro vascular structures. We present an unusual case of an open antero-lateral
      dislocation of the elbow, which was not associated with any vascular or neural
      injury. CASE PRESENTATION: A 34 year female dance instructor sustained an open
      dislocation of her elbow. Surgical exploration was undertaken. No major
      neurovascular injury was present. There was almost complete disruption of all the
      muscular and ligamentous attachments to the distal humerus and the proximal
      radius and ulna, which were not formally repaired during surgery. The elbow was
      found to be very unstable, and was placed in a back slab. The functional recovery
      was complete in about six months, the patient regaining full range of elbow
      movement. Elbow dislocations without associate fractures are adequately treated
      by manipulation and reduction, in spite of the almost complete disruption of the 
      soft tissues around the joint.

TI  - Gabapentin for neuropathic pain: systematic review of controlled and uncontrolled
      literature.
PG  - 284-95
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy/effectiveness and side effects of gabapentin
      for the treatment of neuropathic pain. DESIGN: Systematic review of the
      literature. METHODS: Extensive search of several electronic databases located
      both controlled and uncontrolled studies. Efficacy was assessed through
      meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), whereas the effectiveness
      of gabapentin in uncontrolled studies was assessed via a novel system of
      dichotomous classification of "bad" versus "good" results. FINDINGS: Thirty-five 
      papers involving 727 patients with multiple neuropathic pain conditions met the
      inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis of the 2 high-quality, placebo-controlled
      RCTs showed positive effect of gabapentin in diabetic neuropathy and
      post-herpetic neuralgia. The addition of 2 low-quality, placebo-controlled RCTs
      did not alter the magnitude or direction of observed effect. The uncontrolled
      studies demonstrated positive effect on pain in different neuropathic syndromes, 
      as well as benefit on different types of neuropathic pain; highest dose
      administered and rate-of-dose escalation showed wide variability between
      prescribers. Fewer and less severe side effects were reported in the uncontrolled
      studies. CONCLUSIONS: Gabapentin seems to be effective in multiple painful
      neuropathic conditions. The variable prescribing patterns of the uncontrolled
      studies raise the suspicion that effectiveness may be reduced if one limits
      administration of the drug to very low doses, whereas rapid dose escalation may
      be associated with increased central nervous system side effects. Well-designed
      controlled trials may provide insight into differential symptom sensitivity to
      the drug.

TI  - Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the safety and efficacy of 
      vitamin B complex in the treatment of nocturnal leg cramps in elderly patients
      with hypertension.
PG  - 1151-4
AB  - Nocturnal leg cramps is a common and troublesome problem in elderly individuals, 
      and their etiology is unknown. Treatment with quinine is a common practice, but
      the effectiveness of the drug is doubtful and adverse drug effects are common.
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted to evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of vitamin B complex capsules (fursulthiamine 50 mg,
      hydroxocobalamin 250 micrograms, pyridoxal phosphate 30 mg, and riboflavin 5 mg) 
      in 28 elderly patients with hypertension who had severe nocturnal leg cramps that
      disturbed their sleep. Self-reported ratings of leg cramp frequency, duration,
      and intensity were used to evaluate severity of nocturnal leg cramps. Both the
      patients taking vitamin B capsules (n = 14) and those taking placebo (n = 14)
      received medications three times daily, and were examined regularly at 2-week
      intervals for 3 months. After 3 months, 86% of the patients taking vitamin B had 
      prominent remission of leg cramps, whereas those taking placebo had no
      significant difference from baseline. Treatment with vitamin B complex
      significantly reduced the frequency, intensity, and duration of nocturnal leg
      cramps. Because quinine is not without potential for side effects, and vitamin B 
      complex is a relatively safe and effective alternative, clinicians should
      reconsider the treatment of choice for nocturnal leg cramps.

TI  - Hypotension following the initiation of tizanidine in a patient treated with an
      angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor for chronic hypertension.
PG  - 818-9
AB  - Centrally acting alpha-2 adrenergic agonists are one of several pharmacologic
      agents used in the treatment of spasticity related to disorders of the central
      nervous system. In addition to their effects on spasticity, certain adverse
      cardiorespiratory effects have been reported. Adults chronically treated with
      angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may have a limited ability to respond to
      hypotension when the sympathetic response is simultaneously blocked. The authors 
      present a 10-year-old boy chronically treated with lisinopril, an angiotensin
      converting enzyme inhibitor, to control hypertension who developed hypotension
      following the addition of tizanidine, an alpha-2 agonist, for the treatment of
      spasticity. The possible interaction of tizanidine and other antihypertensive
      agents should be kept in mind when prescribing therapy to treat either
      hypertension or spasticity in such patients.

TI  - An integrated assessment of the clinical safety of artemether-lumefantrine: a new
      oral fixed-dose combination antimalarial drug.
PG  - 419-24
AB  - Artemether-lumefantrine (A-L), a new fixed-dose oral antimalarial drug, combines 
      the fast onset of action of artemether (an artemisinin derivative) in terms of
      parasite clearance with the high cure rate of lumefantrine in the treatment of
      acute uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. The extensive clinical trial
      database of A-L has allowed a comprehensive evaluation of its tolerability and
      safety in a total of 1869 patients (including 243 children aged 5-12 years and
      368 children aged < 5 years). The most commonly reported and possibly related
      adverse effects following A-L therapy involved the gastro-intestinal (abdominal
      pain, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea) and central nervous (headache,
      dizziness) systems. Pruritus and rash were reported by < 2% of patients. More
      than 90% of the reported adverse events, many of which overlapped considerably
      with the clinical symptomatology or evolution of acute malaria, were rated mild
      to moderate in intensity. Compared to A-L, significantly higher incidences of
      vomiting and pruritus were observed with chloroquine, dizziness, nausea and
      vomiting with mefloquine, somnolence with pyrimethamine + sulfadoxine, and
      vomiting and dizziness with quinine. There were no serious or persistent
      neurological side-effects related to A-L administration. A-L did not lead to any 
      clinically relevant alterations of the laboratory parameters. Serial
      electrocardiographic data were available for 713 patients. The frequency of QT
      interval prolongations was similar to or lower than that observed with
      chloroquine, mefloquine, or artesunate + mefloquine; these changes were
      considerably less frequent than with quinine or halofantrine. All patients with
      QT prolongation remained asymptomatic and no adverse clinical cardiac events were
      reported. Artemether-lumefantrine can thus be expected to show, both in children 
      and in adults, a favourable safety profile for the treatment of acute,
      uncomplicated, P. falciparum malaria; it could as well be a reserve treatment
      option for travellers to endemic countries.

TI  - Tizanidine in the management of spasticity and musculoskeletal complaints in the 
      palliative care population.
PG  - 50-8
AB  - Spasticity and other muscle symptoms in the palliative care patient can
      contribute to suffering, significantly detracting from overall quality of life.
      Current therapy primarily includes use of centrally acting muscle relaxants,
      which are beneficial in treating some symptoms, but frequently have extensive
      side effects, such as sedation and muscle weakness. Tizanidine, a central alpha 2
      adrenergic agonist, has been shown in clinical studies to be as effective as
      other commonly used antispastic agents, but without debilitating muscle weakness.
      Tizanidine can cause sedation, which is minimized by dose titration. When taken
      at night, patients report improvement in getting to sleep and little drowsiness
      or "hangover sensation" upon waking. Tizanidine is potentially helpful to many
      palliative care patients with chronic muscle pain and sleep disturbances.

TI  - Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of diazepam, nitroglycerin, or
      both for treatment of patients with potential cocaine-associated acute coronary
      syndromes.
PG  - 878-85
AB  - INTRODUCTION: To the authors' knowledge, treatment of patients with
      cocaine-associated acute coronary syndromes has not been rigorously investigated 
      in symptomatic patients. OBJECTIVE: To perform a randomized double-blind trial of
      diazepam, nitroglycerin, or both for treatment of patients with potential
      cocaine-associated acute coronary syndromes. METHODS: Patients with potential
      cocaine-associated acute coronary syndromes were randomized to treatment with
      either diazepam, nitroglycerin, or both every 5 minutes or until symptom
      resolution. Outcomes were chest pain resolution (measured by visual analog
      scale), and changes in blood pressure, pulse rate, cardiac output (L/min),
      cardiac index (L/min/m2), stroke volume (mL/beat), and stroke index (mL/beat/m2) 
      over the 15-minute treatment period. To adjust for seven outcomes using the
      Bonferroni correction, alpha was set at 0.007. RESULTS: Forty patients were
      enrolled (diazepam, 12; nitroglycerin, 13; both, 15). Patients had a mean age
      (+/-SD) of 35.4 (+/-7.5) years; 75% were male. They presented a mean of 5 hours
      and 37 minutes after cocaine use. Baseline demographics, cocaine use patterns,
      chest pain characteristics, and initial electrocardiograms were similar for all
      groups. Chest pain severity improved similarly in the three groups [-33.3 mm
      (+/-8.0); -30.7 mm (+/-7.1); -33.0 mm (+/-7.9); p = 0.6]. The stroke index
      decreased during the 15-minute treatment period for all groups (diazepam, -8.7
      (+/-3.3); nitroglycerin, -3.1 +/- 2.8; both, -1.8 (+/-3.1) mL/beat/m2; p = 0.03).
      After adjustment for differences between baseline hemodynamic and cardiac
      profiles and multiple comparisons, there was no difference in any response to
      therapy over time for the different treatments. CONCLUSIONS: For treatment of
      patients with potential cocaine-associated acute coronary syndromes, chest pain
      resolutions and changes in cardiac performance are not different in patients
      treated with diazepam or nitroglycerin. In this study, the use of both agents did
      not offer any advantage over either agent alone.

TI  - Placebo-controlled study of gabapentin treatment of panic disorder.
PG  - 467-71
AB  - A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study was
      conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of gabapentin in relieving the
      symptoms of panic disorder. One hundred three patients were randomly assigned to 
      receive double-blind treatment with either gabapentin (dosed flexibly between 600
      and 3,600 mg/day) or placebo for 8 weeks. No overall drug/placebo difference was 
      observed in scores on the Panic and Agoraphobia Scale (PAS) (p = 0.606). A post
      hoc analysis was used to evaluate the more severely ill patients as defined by
      the primary outcome measure (PAS score > or = 20). In this population, the
      gabapentin-treated patients showed significant improvement in the PAS change
      score (p = 0.04). In patients with a PAS score of 20 or greater, women showed a
      greater response than men regardless of treatment. Adverse events were consistent
      with the known side effect profile of gabapentin and included somnolence,
      headache, and dizziness. One patient experienced a serious adverse event during
      the study. No deaths were reported. The results of this study suggest that
      gabapentin may have anxiolytic effects in more severely ill patients with panic
      disorder.

TI  - Drugs used to treat spasticity.
PG  - 487-95
AB  - Spasticity is a common and disabling symptom for many patients with upper motor
      neuron dysfunction. It results from interruption of inhibitory descending spinal 
      motor pathways, and although the pathophysiology of spasticity is poorly
      understood, the final common pathway is overactivity of the alpha motor neuron.
      Therapy for spasticity is symptomatic with the aim of increasing functional
      capacity and relieving discomfort. Any approach to treatment should be
      multidisciplinary, including physical therapy, and possibly surgery, as well as
      pharmacotherapy. It is important that treatment be tailored to the individual
      patient, and that both patient and care giver have realistic expectations.
      Pharmacotherapy is generally initiated at low dosages and then gradually
      increased in an attempt to avoid adverse effects. Optimal therapy is the lowest
      effective dosage. Baclofen, diazepam, tizanidine and dantrolene are currently
      approved for use in patients with spasticity. In addition, clonidine (usually as 
      combination therapy), gabapentin and botulinum toxin have shown efficacy,
      however, more studies are required to confirm their place in therapy. Intrathecal
      baclofen, via a surgically implanted pump and reservoir, may provide relief in
      patients with refractory severe spasticity.

TI  - Baclofen in cluster headache.
PG  - 48-51
AB  - Cluster headache is a rare, severe, clinically well-characterized disorder that
      occurs in both episodic and chronic forms. The painful short-lived attacks occur 
      unilaterally and are associated with signs and symptoms of autonomic involvement.
      They are difficult to treat, and reported prophylactic therapies include
      ergotamine, steroids, methysergide, lithium carbonate, verapamil, valproate,
      capsaicin, leuprolide, clonidine, methylergonovine maleate, and melatonin.
      Baclofen, an antispastic agent, has been shown to have an antinociceptive action.
      Its efficacy in the treatment of neuralgias, central pain following spinal
      lesions or painful strokes, migraine, and medication misuse chronic daily
      headache suggested that it may prevent cluster headache attacks. Nine cluster
      headache patients received baclofen, 15 to 30 mg, in three divided doses. Within 
      a week, six of nine patients reported the cessation of attacks. One was
      substantially better and became attack free by the end of the following week. In 
      the remaining two patients, the attacks worsened and corticosteroids were
      prescribed. In this pilot study, baclofen seemed to be effective and well
      tolerated for the prevention of cluster headache.

TI  - Antidepressant treatment of fibromyalgia. A meta-analysis and review.
PG  - 104-13
AB  - Fibromyalgia is a common musculoskeletal pain disorder associated with mood
      disorders. Antidepressants, particularly tricyclics, are commonly recommended
      treatments. Randomized, controlled trials of antidepressants for treatment of
      fibromyalgia were reviewed by methodology, results, and potential predictors of
      response. Twenty-one controlled trials, 16 involving tricyclic agents, were
      identified; 9 of these 16 studies were suitable for meta-analysis. Effect sizes
      were calculated for measurements of physician and patient overall assessment,
      pain, stiffness, tenderness, fatigue, and sleep quality. Compared with placebo,
      tricyclic agents were associated with effect sizes that were substantially larger
      than zero for all measurements. The largest improvement was associated with
      measures of sleep quality; the most modest improvement was found in measures of
      stiffness and tenderness. Further studies are needed utilizing randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel designs with antidepressants
      administered at therapeutic dose ranges, using standardized criteria for
      fibromyalgia and systematically assessed for co-occurring psychiatric illness.

TI  - Intrathecal baclofen for intractable cerebral spasticity: a prospective
      placebo-controlled, double-blind study.
PG  - 603-9; discussion 609-12
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To conduct a placebo-controlled prospective study of the effectiveness
      of intrathecal bolus injections and continuous administration of baclofen on
      functional parameters in patients with severe spasticity of cerebral origin. To
      compare this functional evaluation with spasticity scores in different muscle
      groups. METHODS: In 11 patients with spasticity of cerebral origin (mainly
      cerebral palsy), double-blind scoring of spasticity (Ashworth scale score and
      visual analog score), spasms, pain, and functional abilities was performed during
      tests with bolus injections including a placebo control. Eight patients were
      considered good responders and received a subcutaneous device for intrathecal
      drug delivery. Six of these patients were followed up for 2 years, during which
      they underwent the same scoring procedures as after their bolus injections. These
      patients were subjected to a blinded dose reduction test. RESULTS: There was a
      noticeable placebo effect on spasticity scores during tests with bolus
      injections. Eight patients demonstrated a significant beneficial effect of
      intrathecal bolus injections compared with this placebo effect. Functional
      improvements were noted in most patients. During continuous infusion, Ashworth
      scale scores were less favorable but still significantly lower than at baseline. 
      Subjective evaluation (visual analog scores) remained positive, functional
      improvements were maintained, and patient comfort was invariably and
      significantly improved. CONCLUSION: Intrathecal administration of baclofen is a
      safe and effective treatment for spasticity of cerebral origin. Functional
      improvement was demonstrated. The presence of a placebo effect on the spasticity 
      scores suggests the need for double-blind screening in each patient.

TI  - Intrathecal baclofen for management of spastic cerebral palsy: multicenter trial.
PG  - 71-7
AB  - Intrathecal baclofen infusion has demonstrated effectiveness in decreasing
      spasticity of spinal origin. Oral antispasticity medication is minimally
      effective or not well tolerated in cerebral palsy. This study assessed the
      effectiveness of intrathecal baclofen in reducing spasticity in cerebral palsy.
      Candidates were screened by randomized, double-blind, intrathecal injections of
      baclofen and placebo. Responders were defined as those who experienced an average
      reduction of 1.0 in the lower extremities on the Ashworth Scale for spasticity.
      Responders received intrathecal baclofen via the SynchroMed System and were
      followed for up to 43 months. Fifty-one patients completed screening and 44
      entered open-label trials. Lower-extremity spasticity decreased from an average
      baseline score of 3.64 to 1.90 at 39 months. A decrease in upper extremity
      spasticity was evidenced over the same study period. Forty-two patients reported 
      adverse events. Most common reports were hypotonia, seizures (no new onset),
      somnolence, and nausea or vomiting. Fifty-nine percent of the patients
      experienced procedural or system-related events. Spasticity in patients with
      cerebral palsy can be treated effectively by continuous intrathecal baclofen.
      Adverse events, although common, were manageable.

TI  - Gabapentin treatment for muscle cramps: an open-label trial.
PG  - 45-9
AB  - To evaluate the efficacy and safety of gabapentin in the treatment of muscle
      cramps, we engaged an open-label trial with a group of 30 patients with frequent 
      (> 5 cramps/week), stable, long-lasting cramps, associated with different
      diseases. Gabapentin was effective in reducing the frequency and severity of
      muscle cramps and associated sleep disturbances (clinical outcome measures)
      within the first 2 weeks of medication at 600 mg/d. At the 1 month control (mean 
      dosage, 825 +/- 35 mg), almost every patient had responded to treatment and two
      thirds experienced a total remission of symptoms. After 3 months of therapy (mean
      dosage, 892 +/- 180 mg), cramps disappeared in 100% of patients and this benefit 
      persisted as long as 6 months. Additionally, we evaluated in 10 patients the
      Cramps Threshold Frequency (CTF) (neurophysiological outcome measure) before and 
      during gabapentin treatment. Gabapentin significantly increased the CTF,
      returning it to normal values. With the limitation of an open-label methodology, 
      our clinical and neurophysiologic experience suggests that a gabapentin dose of
      600-1200 mg/d would be helpful in the treatment of muscular cramps.

TI  - A review of the properties and limitations of the Ashworth and modified Ashworth 
      Scales as measures of spasticity.
PG  - 373-83
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Ashworth Scale and the modified Ashworth Scale are the primary
      clinical measures of spast city. A prerequisite for using any scale is a
      knowledge of its characteristics and limitations, as these will play a part in
      analysing and interpreting the data. Despite the current emphasis on treating
      spasticity, clinicians rarely measure it. OBJECTIVES: To determine the validity
      and the reliability of the Ashworth and modified Ashworth Scales. STUDY DESIGN: A
      theoretical analysis following a structured literature review (key words:
      Ashworth; Spasticity; Measurement) of 40 papers selected from the BIDS-EMBASE,
      First Search and Medline databases. CONCLUSIONS: The application of both scales
      would suggest that confusion exists on their characteristics and limitations as
      measures of spasticity. Resistance to passive movement is a complex measure that 
      will be influenced by many factors, only one of which could be spasticity. The
      Ashworth Scale (AS) can be used as an ordinal level measure of resistance to
      passive movement, but not spasticity. The modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) will need
      to be treated as a nominal level measure of resistance to passive movement until 
      the ambiguity between the '1' and '1+' grades is resolved. The reliability of the
      scales is better in the upper limb. The AS may be more reliable than the MAS.
      There is a need to standardize methods to apply these scales in clinical practice
      and research.

TI  - Should people with nocturnal leg cramps drink tonic water and bitter lemon?
PG  - 355-67
AB  - A literature search from 1993 to 1997 using MEDLINE and key-words beverages,
      muscle cramp, and quinine was performed. Three beverages containing quinine were 
      examined in grocery stores. Analysis indicate that leg cramps are a common
      phenomenon associated with many comorbid disorders especially peripheral vascular
      and neurologic disorders. Thus, evaluation of a patient's complaining of leg
      cramps appropriately includes vascular, neurologic, and musculoskeletal
      examinations. Laboratory investigation of the symptom of leg cramps warrants as a
      minimum, assessment of thyroid function and determination of platelet counts and 
      serum levels of electrolytes, calcium, and magnesium. A few small studies suggest
      that quinine is effective in decreasing the frequency of nocturnal leg cramps but
      not their severity or duration. Quinine consumed in commercial beverages has been
      reported to cause potentially fatal immunologically mediated hypersensitivity
      reactions. The concentration of quinine in commercial beverages varies greatly.
      Although commercial beverages containing quinine generally are labeled "Contains 
      quinine," they typically lack both nutritional information about the amount of
      quinine and warnings of the health risks. It appears that 325 milligrams of
      quinine taken by mouth at bedtime typically relieves nocturnal leg cramps, but
      lower starting doses are appropriate for senior citizens and individuals with
      impaired renal function. In general, quinine in any form should be avoided by
      pregnant women and people with hepatic failure. Quinine consumed for the
      treatment of leg cramps should be prescribed and monitored by physicians, and
      people who consume quinine in commercial beverages must be warned of the health
      risks.

      disorder.
PG  - 1279-86
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the usefulness of moclobemide and amitriptyline in the
      treatment of fibromyalgia (FM) in females without psychiatric disorder. METHODS: 
      In the present four centre, 12 week study, 130 female FM patients not suffering
      from psychiatric disorders were randomized to receive amitriptyline (AMI; 25 37.5
      mg), moclobemide (MOCLO; 450-600 mg) or identical placebo. RESULTS: Seventy-four,
      54 and 49 per cent of patients on AMI, MOCLO and placebo, respectively, were
      judged as responders. The patients on AMI also managed best regarding the
      respective improvements during the trial in general health, pain, sleep quality
      and quantity, and fatigue on visual analogue scales (VAS), the areas of the
      Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), as well as in the three Sheehan's functional
      disability scales. In the within-group comparisons, MOCLO also improved pain
      assessed both on VAS and on the NHP pain dimension, but the improvement was
      invalidated by the poor success of the drug with regard to sleep. The
      tolerabilities of all three drugs were comparable. CONCLUSION: The study
      indicates that MOCLO may not be helpful in FM patients free from clinically
      meaningful psychiatric problems.

TI  - Longitudinal involvement of the spinal cord in a patient with lupus related
      transverse myelitis.
PG  - 446-9
AB  - Transverse myelitis is a rare and serious complication of systemic lupus
      erythematosus (SLE). Magnetic resonance imaging is the investigation of choice
      for diagnosis and followup. This typically shows T1 and T2 signal prolongation,
      cord widening, and contrast enhancement over several spinal segments. We describe
      a 21-year-old woman with SLE who developed very extensive SLE related transverse 
      myelitis with longitudinal involvement of the spinal cord from C3 to T2 and from 
      T7 to the conus medullaris. Clinically, this was manifest as leg weakness,
      bladder dysfunction, severe low back pain, and patchy lower limb sensory loss.
      She responded to treatment with pulse cyclophosphamide and high dose
      corticosteroids with complete recovery in 3 months. To our knowledge, this is the
      first case report of such an extensive "longitudinal" myelitis.

TI  - Medication-induced headache: overview and systematic review of therapeutic
      approaches.
PG  - 61-72
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review medication-induced headache (MIH) through a systematic
      evaluation of the literature regarding the pharmacologic management of this
      condition. METHODOLOGY: To identify and evaluate all pharmacologic interventions 
      for MIH, we conducted a qualitative systematic review of the English-language
      literature from 1966 to June 1998 using MEDLINE. The following search terms were 
      used: chronic daily headache, transformed migraine, analgesic withdrawal
      headache, analgesic rebound headache, drug-associated headache,
      medication-induced headache, detoxification, and dihydroergotamine. In addition, 
      a review of the references from relevant literature was also conducted to collect
      reports not identified in the MEDLINE search. RESULTS: Numerous therapies for
      acute management of MIH have been evaluated, although no rigorously conducted
      clinical trials were identified. Therapies evaluated include abrupt withdrawal of
      analgesics, initiation of dihydroergotamine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory
      agents, methylergonovine, dihydroergotamine, sumatriptan, amitriptyline,
      dexamethasone, piracetam, prothipendyl, and valproate. Epidemiology, diagnosis,
      clinical features, pathophysiology, and long-term prognosis of therapy are
      discussed and therapeutic guidelines are offered. CONCLUSIONS: MIH is an
      underrecognized and difficult condition affecting headache-prone patients. The
      published literature concerning treatment of patients with MIH is scant and of
      poor quality, making it difficult for clinicians to decide on appropriate
      therapy. Recognition and treatment of MIH may lead to a long-term improvement in 
      headache relief for many patients. It appears that complete withdrawal of the
      medications being overused is required for favorable long-term results.

TI  - Quinine-induced hepatotoxicity.
PG  - 32-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report a case of quinine-induced hepatotoxicity presenting within
      24 hours following the ingestion of the first dose. DATA SOURCES: Case report
      information was obtained from the medical record, the patient, and the physicians
      involved in this patient's case. MEDLINE and Index Medicus were searched to
      obtain relevant published literature from January 1942 to May 1997 using the
      terms quinine, muscle cramps, liver disease, and hepatotoxicity. CASE SUMMARY: A 
      57-year-old Native American woman presented with symptoms of nausea, vomiting,
      generalized myalgia, headache, fever, chills, and rigor. The alkaline
      phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine
      aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase concentrations were
      dramatically elevated. Quinine was suspected as the cause after several days of
      hospitalization and continued therapy. With discontinuation of the quinine, the
      patient's symptoms resolved within 48 hours and the liver enzyme concentrations
      declined within 72 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Documented hepatotoxicity has occurred
      with quinidine, the optical isomer of quinine. Limited awareness of
      quinine-induced hepatotoxicity may result in an unrecognized adverse effect.

TI  - Trazodone and valproate in patients discontinuing long-term benzodiazepine
      therapy: effects on withdrawal symptoms and taper outcome.
PG  - 1-5
AB  - Recent uncontrolled research suggested that trazodone and sodium valproate may be
      helpful in benzodiazepine (BZ) discontinuation. We therefore undertook a
      double-blind study to assess whether trazodone and valproate, as compared to
      placebo, would attenuate withdrawal and facilitate discontinuation in
      BZ-dependent patients with a minimum of 1 year daily BZ use. Seventy-eight
      patients, taking a mean dose of 19+/-17 mg/day of diazepam (or its equivalent),
      were stabilized for several weeks on their BZ (16 diazepam, 25 lorazepam, 37
      alprazolam) and then for 1-2 weeks, pretreated with trazodone, sodium valproate
      or placebo before being tapered at 25% per week. All treatments were continued
      for 5 weeks post-taper. BZ-free status was assessed after 5 and 12 weeks
      post-taper. Neither trazodone nor valproate had any significant effect on
      withdrawal severity. Peak physician withdrawal checklist change from baseline to 
      peak severity was 16.4 for trazodone, 18.04 sodium valproate and 18.24 placebo (F
      = 0.10; NS). Taper success rates were significantly effected by both active
      agents at the 5-week, but not 12-week, assessment. At 5 weeks post-taper, 79% of 
      sodium valproate and 67% of trazodone, but only 31% of placebo patients were
      BZ-free (chi2 = 7.34; df 2; P<0.03). Major adverse events for trazodone were
      sedation and dry mouth, and for valproate, diarrhea, nausea and headaches.

TI  - Medical management of posttraumatic headaches: pharmacological and physical
      treatment.
PG  - 34-48
AB  - Posttraumatic headache can be a very difficult syndrome to manage, especially if 
      chronic. As with most other types of headache, medications are the primary
      treatment modality, although there is very limited evidence-based data to support
      any given approach. A number of physical interventions also are available to be
      used in conjunction with medication, particularly for headaches with a
      musculoskeletal component. This article will review the general principles of
      pharmacological treatment for headache and the physical approach to treatment of 
      headaches and head and facial pain. The major categories of medications commonly 
      used for treatment of many varieties of headache will be discussed. In addition, 
      the problems encountered in diagnosing and treating chronic daily headache and
      analgesic rebound headache are addressed. The approach to treatment of such
      syndromes as myofascial pain, cervico-zygapophyseal joint pain, neuritic pain,
      and craniocervical somatic pain are outlined.

TI  - Gabapentin add-on treatment: how many patients become seizure-free? An open-label
      multicenter study.
PG  - 1-7
AB  - The aim of the study was to find out the percentage of patients with
      localization-related epilepsy achieving complete seizure control with gabapentin 
      (GBP) add-on therapy. Patients under anti-epileptic drug monotherapy during 8
      weeks baseline (BSL) with 6 or more seizures were treated with GBP for 26 weeks
      up to 2400 mg/day. Patients obtaining complete seizure control of all seizures or
      any partial seizure type during the last 8 weeks were calculated. Seizure
      frequency was compared between BSL and last 8 weeks. In all, 110 patients were
      enrolled (92 completed, 18 discontinued): mean age of the completers: 37.6 years 
      (range 16-72), median seizure frequency per 28 days at BSL: 6.8 (2.5-24.5), mean 
      duration of epilepsy: 17.6 years (0.2-51.4), mean duration with GBP for
      completers: 182.8 days (144-187). Complete seizure control of all seizures was
      achieved in 8.7% of patients (simple partial seizures: 13.3%, complex partial
      seizures 24.3%, secondarily generalized seizures: 61.5%): 38% of the patients
      became seizure-free in at least 1 seizure-type; 40% experienced adverse events.
      Assessment for quality of life (QoL) and trough plasma levels of GBP did not
      correlate with the good effect of GBP.

TI  - Pharmacologic treatment for children and adolescents with anxiety disorders.
PG  - 1187-204
AB  - Pediatric anxiety disorders are common illnesses that, if left untreated, may
      induce academic, family, and interpersonal problems. Cognitive-behavioral
      techniques and other psychotherapeutic interventions may be adequate for the
      treatment of most anxiety disorders. For patients with severe symptoms or for
      whom psychotherapeutic approaches are not adequate, medications are indicated.
      Among the available medications, the SSRIs are currently the first choice;
      however, other medications, such as the benzodiazepines and the TCAs, may be used
      alone or sometimes in combination with the SSRIs. Caution with respect to
      medication interactions and side effects is indicated. In particular, long-term
      side effects in these medications have not been well studied.

TI  - Has botulinum toxin type A a place in the treatment of spasticity in spinal cord 
      injury patients?
PG  - 854-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To present and discuss treatment of severe spasms related to spinal
      cord injury with botulinum toxin type A. DESIGN: A 2-year follow-up study of an
      incomplete T12 paraplegic patient, who was reluctant to undergo intrathecal
      baclofen therapy, presenting severe painful spasms in his lower limbs treated
      with intramuscular injections of botulinum toxin type A. SETTING: Department of
      Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Hopital de Gravelone, Sion, Switzerland.
      SUBJECT: Single patient case report. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Spasticity, spasms and
      pain measured with the modified Ashworth scale, spasm frequency score and visual 
      analogue scale. RESULTS: Treatment of spasticity with selective intramuscular
      injections of botulinum toxin type A resulted in subjective and objective
      improvement. CONCLUSION: Botulinum toxin type A has its place in the treatment of
      spasticity in spinal cord injury patients. This treatment is expensive and its
      effect is reversible. It can complement intrathecal baclofen in treating upper
      limb spasticity in tetraplegic patients. Tolerance does occur to the toxin.
      Although high doses of the product are well tolerated, the quantity should be
      tailored to the patient's need. The minimal amount necessary to reach clinical
      effects should be adhered to and booster doses at short period intervals should
      be avoided.

TI  - A case of myokymia-cramp syndrome successfully treated with gabapentin.
PG  - 458-60
AB  - We report a case of "myokymia-cramp syndrome", a rare and benign disease
      consisting of muscular cramps in the upper and lower limbs associated with
      generalized myokymias. In our patient, cramps had been present since adolescence 
      and had increased in frequency and duration during the last 3 years, occurring
      about 8 or 9 times a day. Cramps were mainly nocturnal and also precipitated by
      walking; a previous treatment with carbamazepine did not improve the symptoms.
      Gabapentin therapy proved to be very satisfactory in relieving muscular cramps
      with a relatively low dosage (600 mg/day) and without any remarkable side
      effects. The possible interpretation of the mechanism involved in gabapentin
      induced relief of cramps is discussed. Gabapentin should be considered as a safe 
      alternative treatment for muscular cramps.

TI  - Headaches, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and pseudopapilledema.
PG  - 408-10
AB  - A young woman with frontal headaches of several months' evolution and monocular
      transient "tunnel" obscurations that developed after a generalized seizure is
      described. She had elevation of the optic discs (pseudopapilledema), greater on
      the side of her visual symptoms. No intracranial lesions were identified.
      Cerebrospinal fluid pressure was increased, diagnostic of idiopathic intracranial
      hypertension (IIH). Because both IIH and pseudopapilledema may cause transient
      visual obscurations (TVO), fortuitous discovery of pseudopapilledema in a patient
      with TVO does not preclude the necessity of performing a diagnostic lumbar
      puncture. Establishing the correct diagnosis has obvious therapeutic and
      prognostic implications.

TI  - Gabapentin for the symptomatic treatment of painful neuropathy in patients with
      diabetes mellitus: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 1831-6
AB  - CONTEXT: Pain is the most disturbing symptom of diabetic peripheral neuropathy.
      As many as 45% of patients with diabetes mellitus develop peripheral
      neuropathies. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of gabapentin monotherapy on pain
      associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, 8-week trial conducted between July 1996 and March 1997.
      SETTING: Outpatient clinics at 20 sites. PATIENTS: The 165 patients enrolled had 
      a 1- to 5-year history of pain attributed to diabetic neuropathy and a minimum
      40-mm pain score on the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire visual analogue
      scale. INTERVENTION: Gabapentin (titrated from 900 to 3600 mg/d or maximum
      tolerated dosage) or placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary efficacy measure
      was daily pain severity as measured on an 11-point Likert scale (0, no pain; 10, 
      worst possible pain). Secondary measures included sleep interference scores, the 
      Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire scores, Patient Global Impression of Change 
      and Clinical Global Impression of Change, the Short Form-36 Quality of Life
      Questionnaire scores, and the Profile of Mood States results. RESULTS:
      Eighty-four patients received gabapentin and 70 (83%) completed the study; 81
      received placebo and 65 (80%) completed the study. By intent-to-treat analysis,
      gabapentin-treated patients' mean daily pain score at the study end point
      (baseline, 6.4; end point, 3.9; n = 82) was significantly lower (P<.001) compared
      with the placebo-treated patients' end-point score (baseline, 6.5; end point,
      5.1; n = 80). All secondary outcome measures of pain were significantly better in
      the gabapentin group than in the placebo group. Additional statistically
      significant differences favoring gabapentin treatment were observed in measures
      of quality of life (Short Form-36 Quality of Life Questionnaire and Profile of
      Mood States). Adverse events experienced significantly more frequently in the
      gabapentin group were dizziness (20 [24%] in the gabapentin group vs 4 [4.9%] in 
      the control group; P<.001) and somnolence (19 [23%] in the gabapentin group vs 5 
      [6%] in the control group; P = .003). Confusion was also more frequent in the
      gabapentin group (7 [8%] vs 1 [1.2%]; P = .06). CONCLUSION: Gabapentin
      monotherapy appears to be efficacious for the treatment of pain and sleep
      interference associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy and exhibits positive
      effects on mood and quality of life.

TI  - Felbamate: clinical and molecular aspects of a unique antiepileptic drug.
PG  - 205-22
AB  - Felbamate was launched in 1993 in the U.S. as a "new generation" antiepileptic
      drug (AED) with a unique mechanism of action. It proved efficacious in patients
      refractory to other AEDs and was particularly beneficial in children suffering
      from Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, being the first drug shown to be effective at
      treating this condition in controlled trials. Following the occurrence of rare
      cases of aplastic anemia and of hepatic failure associated with the use of
      felbamate during early 1994, a "black-box" warning was added to the drug's
      package insert. Despite this, felbamate continues to be used in many patients,
      although not as a first-line treatment. Felbamate's dual mechanism of
      action--enhancing the GABA system while inhibiting excitatory amino acid
      responses--may explain its efficacy in a broad range of epileptic patients. A
      better understanding of this mechanism may lead to the development of
      felbamate-like drugs with a better side effect profile.

TI  - Vitamin B2 interference with TDx drugs-of-abuse assays.
PG  - 1225-7
AB  - Migraine is a headache condition found in significant frequency in the general
      population. One recent study has shown that riboflavin, Vitamin B2, is an
      effective prophylactic treatment for this headache condition. One subject in a
      recent study conducted by the Division of Forensic Toxicology, Armed Forces
      Institute of Pathology (AFIP) was taking 200 mg of riboflavin twice daily for the
      prevention of migraine headaches. When that subject's urine was tested using
      Abbott TDx drugs-of-abuse assays a number of tests resulted in a MX BKG error and
      all samples had BLK I values greater than those observed with normal urine
      specimens. The MX BKG error occurs when the BLK I value is greater than the upper
      limit determined by the manufacturer for a particular assay. High BLK I values
      may result if the specimen being analyzed contains a fluorophore that will
      compete with the fluorescein-labeled antibody used in the assay. This error
      serves as a notification that an interfering substance may be present and the
      assay is not performing according to manufacturer-specifications. Upon
      termination of riboflavin therapy the subject's BLK I values began to decrease
      within 60 h of the last 200 mg dose. A second subject began chronic riboflavin
      use to confirm this interferent effect. Elevated BLK I values resulted within 3 h
      of a single 200 mg dose and MX BKG errors occurred 1 h after a second 400 mg
      dose. No false negative results were noted with either subject (both subjects
      used butalbital and the first subject also used hydrocodone and diazepam during
      the study), suggesting that riboflavin is not an adulterant. Riboflavin use,
      however, does interfere with the TDx DAU assays and may result in quantitative
      values being determined which are of questionable validity in the face of an
      elevated BLK I value or may result in only an MX BKG error and no quantitative
      value reported. It is unclear if the interfering fluorophore is simply riboflavin
      itself or a combination of riboflavin and its metabolic products. Results
      obtained on urine samples collected from individuals using prophylactic
      riboflavin for migraine prevention and analyzed by TDx may be of questionable
      validity. Such samples may require analysis utilizing another immunoassay
      technique that does not employ a fluorescein-labeled antibody.

TI  - Poikilothermia syndrome.
PG  - 431-6
AB  - Poikilothermia syndrome is a rare cause of intrinsic thermoregulatory failure.
      Patients with this syndrome regulate body temperature poorly, if at all.
      Recently, a patient was referred to us who had clinical evidence of
      poikilothermia syndrome, as well as long-standing multiple sclerosis.
      Computerized tomography and magnetic resonance scanning failed to identify a
      hypothalamic lesion. The patient was gradually warmed to sweating, and then
      cooled to vasoconstriction and shivering. The core-temperature thresholds
      triggering each defence were calculated, after compensating for the changes in
      skin temperature. The calculated sweating threshold was 38.3 degrees C (normal:
      37.0 +/- 0.3 degrees C). The vasoconstriction threshold was 34.4 degrees C
      (normal: 36.4 +/- 0.3 degrees C). The sweating-to-vasoconstriction interthreshold
      range was thus approximately 4 degrees C, which is between 10 and 20 times the
      normal value. The shivering threshold was 31.8 degrees C (normal: 35.6 +/- 0.3
      degrees C). The vasoconstriction-to-shivering range was thus approximately 2.5
      degrees C which is more than twice the normal value. The pattern of
      thermoregulatory failure in this patient resembled that resulting from general
      anaesthesia.

TI  - A case of spinal cord injury-related pain with baseline rCBF brain SPECT imaging 
      and beneficial response to gabapentin.
PG  - 139-43
AB  - Central pain following spinal cord injury is poorly understood, and is often
      resistant to conventional pain therapy regimens. We describe an individual with
      paraplegia who for many years experienced rapidly fluctuating, severe, unilateral
      pain below the level of his lesion. Prior to the initiation of pharmacological
      treatment, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured during PAIN and
      NON-PAIN states using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). When
      experiencing pain, the subject had increased anterior cingulate gyrus blood flow,
      increased thalamic blood flow bilaterally and increased somatosensory cortex
      blood flow contralaterally but decreased caudate blood flow bilaterally. The
      subject's subsequent clinical course included a trial of gabapentin which
      produced a substantial reduction in frequency and average intensity of his
      episodic pain and which has been maintained for almost 2 years. This case
      demonstrates the correspondence between rCBF and pain associated with spinal cord
      injury and also suggests the potential utility of gabapentin for treatment of
      this central pain state.

TI  - Treating repetitive seizures with a rectal diazepam formulation: a randomized
      study. The North American Diastat Study Group.
PG  - 1274-82
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a single-dose treatment
      for acute repetitive seizure (ARS) episodes (e.g., clusters) administered in a
      nonmedical setting by caregivers. BACKGROUND: Patients with epilepsy may
      experience ARS episodes despite optimal anticonvulsant treatment. Such episodes
      require rapid treatment as medical emergencies. Typically, the patient is treated
      in an emergency medical setting with i.v. medication by trained medical
      personnel. METHODS: The authors undertook a multicenter, randomized, parallel,
      double-blind study of a single administration of Diastat (diazepam rectal gel)
      for treating episodes of ARS. ARS episodes and treatment criteria were defined
      for each patient at the start of the study. Caregivers were taught to determine
      ARS episode onset, administer a predetermined dose of study medication, monitor
      outcome, count respirations, and record seizures and adverse events. RESULTS: A
      total of 29 centers enrolled 158 patients, of whom 114 patients had a treated ARS
      episode (Diastat, n = 56; placebo, n = 58). Diastat treatment reduced median
      seizure frequency (p = 0.029). More Diastat patients were seizure free
      post-treatment (Diastat, 55%; placebo, 34%; p = 0.031). Kaplan-Meier analysis of 
      the time to the next seizure favored Diastat treatment (p < 0.007). The most
      common adverse event was somnolence. CONCLUSION: Administration of a single
      rectal dose of Diastat was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing 
      the number of seizures following an episode of ARS. Caregivers could administer
      treatment safely and effectively in a nonmedical setting.

AB  - Although new disease-altering treatments offer hope for those with multiple
      sclerosis, they are not appropriate for most. Management of symptoms, however,
      can help everyone with the disease. Several new therapies, including tizanidine, 
      intrathecal baclofen, botulinum toxin injections, gabapentin, ondansitron,
      thalamic stimulation, and lamotrigine, increase our treatment options. Better
      understanding of the sleep disorders that commonly occur in those with multiple
      sclerosis will help us treat another disabling symptom. This chapter reviews the 
      medical and surgical management of multiple sclerosis symptoms, including these
      new options.

      injured patients: a preliminary report.
PG  - 2137-8
AB  - PURPOSE: We assessed the urodynamic effect of various doses of intrathecal
      clonidine on refractory detrusor hyperreflexia in spinal cord injured patients.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Doses of 15, 30 or 45 microg. intrathecal clonidine or
      placebo were given to 5 chronic complete spinal cord injured patients with
      detrusor hyperreflexia. Two cystometries were performed before and 5, 30, 60, 90,
      120 and 180 minutes after each injection. RESULTS: A statistically significant
      dose dependent decrease in detrusor hyperreflexia was observed in each patient
      without significant side effect. CONCLUSIONS: Intrathecal clonidine may represent
      a conservative reversible treatment for detrusor hyperreflexia via a subcutaneous
      programmable pump, like that used for baclofen, for spasticity. The long-term
      efficacy needs to be evaluated.

PG  - 1076-82
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the last decade the use of spinal anaesthesia (SA) in paediatric
      anaesthesia has increased. In adults, pencil point spinal needles are supposed to
      be less traumatic and hence to be superior compared with cutting point needles in
      respect of postpuncture complaints. In children, the use of spinal needles with a
      special tip design have not been compared. The aim of this study was to study the
      clinical utility and postpuncture characteristics of four newly designed spinal
      needles in paediatric surgery. METHODS: In this open-randomised, parallel groups,
      prospective study we compared the puncture quality, success rate and postpuncture
      characteristics in 200 children aged 2 to 128 months. Two cutting point needles; 
      a 50-mm-long 25G Quincke and a 25-mm-long 26G Atraucan were compared with two
      pencil point needles; a 37-mm-long 27G Whitacre and a 35-mm-long 24G Sprotte. The
      children were premedicated with oral diazepam and those anxious or uncomfortable 
      after premedication were sedated with i.v. thiopentone or propofol. Bupivacaine 5
      mg ml-1 0.3-0.5 mg kg-1 was used for the SA. RESULTS: The spinal puncture was
      successful with one or two skin punctures in 96% of children. The cutting point
      needles were easier to insert through the skin and ligaments (P = 0.001) but the 
      pencil point needles gave a better (P = 0.001) indication of the dural passage.
      The success rate of the SA was 91% without differences between the needles. Five 
      patients were given general anaesthesia and 13 children a single dose of i.v.
      fentanyl/sedative. The spinal block was completed in less than 3 min in 96% of
      the cases without differences between the needles. Seventeen children developed a
      headache, 10 of which were classified as a postdural puncture headache (PDPH), 3 
      with the Sprotte, 3 with the Quincke and 4 with the Atraucan needles. The
      youngest child developing PDPH was a 12-month-old boy. Eight of the PDPH were
      mild and 2 moderate. Ten children developed a low back pain, 2-3 in each study
      group. Three children in the pencil point groups developed signs of transient
      radicular irritation. CONCLUSION: SA using bupivacaine and the study needles
      produced smooth and safe anaesthesia for paediatric surgery with a high success
      rate. PDPH after SA is as common in children (5%) as in adults although most
      often mild and short lasting. SA using bupivacaine can cause transient radicular 
      irritation.

TI  - Effects of drugs on walking after spinal cord injury.
PG  - 699-715
AB  - Clonidine, a noradrenergic agonist, and cyproheptadine, a serotonergic
      antagonist, have each been associated with improved walking in SCI subjects.
      Baclofen, a GABA agonist, is frequently prescribed for spasticity but its effects
      on walking have not been well quantified. The objective of this study was to
      compare the effects of clonidine, cyproheptadine and baclofen on walking in SCI
      subjects with incomplete injuries. A motorized treadmill was used and harness
      support provided when necessary. A repeated single-subject design was employed
      for the twelve subjects. The greatest effects were found in more severely
      disabled subjects. Cyproheptadine was associated with greatly reduced need for
      assistance, increases in maximum treadmill speed (MTS) and reduced clonus.
      Clonidine was associated with increases in MTS and a generally more upright
      posture. Baclofen was associated with minor changes in walking. In many cases of 
      drug effects, MTS increases and other changes were retained following washout of 
      drugs. The significance and implications of the drug effects and the retention of
      effects during washout periods are discussed. It is concluded that clonidine and 
      cyproheptadine have different effects but both appear useful for severely
      disabled SCI subjects. The effects of baclofen on walking after spinal cord
      injury remains unclear.

TI  - Gabapentin for relief of spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 451-4
AB  - The use of a recently released anticonvulsant, gabapentin, in the treatment of
      spasticity in two patients with multiple sclerosis is reported. Gabapentin was
      chosen because of its GABA-ergic effect and because previously reported studies
      have shown that it is well tolerated compared with other GABA-mimetic medication.
      Satisfactory release of spasticity with significant improvement of functional
      outcome was noted in both cases. Both patients were first treated with gabapentin
      for one month at 300 mg per day and then, with no reported side-effects, at 400
      mg per day. Before treatment, spasticity (graded with modified Ashworth Scale) in
      one patient was 3 for left lower and 2 for right lower limbs, and Expanded
      Disability Status Scale (EDSS) was 7; ambulation was limited to a few steps with 
      a standard walker. After two weeks of treatment, spasticity was 2 and 1 for the
      left and right lower limbs, respectively. At three-month intervals, spasticity
      was +1 for left and 1 for right lower limbs, and EDSS was 6; the patient could
      ambulate 75 to 100 m with a standard walker. In the second patient, spasticity
      before treatment was 2 for both lower and left upper limbs. EDSS was 5.5, and
      ambulation was confined to 100 m with a cane. Spasticity improved to +1 in lower 
      and 1 in left upper limbs after two weeks and to 1 and normal after three months.
      At three months, EDSS was 3 and the patient could ambulate for long distances
      without an assistive device. We suggest that gabapentin can be used effectively
      to decrease spasticity without significant side effects in patients with multiple
      sclerosis.

TI  - Quinine for cramps.
PG  - 922-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: The bark of the cinchona tree was used by the Incas of South America 
      to treat tropical fevers. It was brought back to Europe by the Jesuit priests and
      used in error to treat all types of fever. Because of its cost and lack of
      availability, apothecaries found an alternative antipyretic in willow bark.
      Subsequently salicylates were isolated from willow and quinine from cinchona
      bark. Quinine is used worldwide for the treatment of fever due to malaria, but in
      the Western environment has long been used for muscle cramps because of its neuro
      muscular junction blocking action. DISCUSSION: Quinine is a widely used
      medication which has been reported to cause thrombocytopenia on occasion. This
      potentially life threatening complication should be borne in mind when it is
      prescribed for minor symptoms such as muscle cramps.

TI  - Effects of the antimigraine compound zolmitriptan ('Zomig') on psychomotor
      performance alone and in combination with diazepam in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 468-75
AB  - Zolmitriptan (Zomig) is a 5HT1B/1D agonist which has the ability to cross the
      intact blood-brain barrier to access central as well as peripheral receptors.
      Because of the potential for central nervous system side effects, this
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6-period crossover study evaluated 
      the effects of 2.5 and 5 mg doses of zolmitriptan on psychomotor performance and 
      investigated any pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic interaction with diazepam.
      Twelve healthy volunteers received the following "treatments" as single doses:
      zolmitriptan 2.5 mg, zolmitriptan 5 mg, diazepam 10 mg, zolmitriptan 2.5 mg +
      diazepam 10 mg, zolmitriptan 5 mg + diazepam 10 mg and placebo. Pre-dose and at
      1, 4, 8, and 24 h post-dose, the following validated battery of psychomotor tests
      was performed: Bond-Lader visual analogue scales (calmness, contentedness, and
      alertness factors), critical flicker fusion test, choice reaction time
      (recognition, motor, and total reaction times), finger-tapping test, number
      cancellation test and digit symbol substitution test. Plasma concentrations of
      zolmitriptan, its active metabolite, and diazepam and its active metabolites were
      measured at the same timepoints. Zolmitriptan 2.5 and 5 mg had no effect on
      psychomotor function when given alone. In contrast, diazepam 10 mg had profound
      effects, consistent with its sedative properties, but there was no synergism on
      concomitant administration of either dose of zolmitriptan. Plasma concentrations 
      of zolmitriptan, diazepam, and their respective active metabolites were similar
      when the two drugs were given alone or in combination.

TI  - Complications after selective posterior rhizotomy for spasticity in children with
      cerebral palsy.
PG  - 300-13
AB  - Selective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR) has been shown to be an effective treatment for 
      the spasticity of cerebral palsy, but few studies have addressed specifically the
      side effects of the procedure. A retrospective study was performed to determine
      the frequency and nature of complications in 158 children who had undergone SDR
      at British Columbia's Children's Hospital from 1987 to 1996. Intraoperative,
      preoperative (immediate postoperative until discharge at approximately 7 days)
      and postdischarge complications occurred in 3.8, 43.6 and 30% of patients,
      respectively. The most common intraoperative complication was aspiration
      pneumonia, which was experienced by 2 patients (1.3%). Perioperatively, sensory
      changes were found in 8.9% of the children, and transient urinary retention in
      4.4%. Complications after discharge included back pain starting more than 6
      months after surgery in 10.8%, sensory changes in 13.9%, and neurogenic bladder
      or bowel problems in 12.7%. Persistent sensory changes occurred in 3.8%, were not
      important functionally, and tended to occur in patients with the largest amount
      of dorsal root tissue cut. In 8 patients (5.1%), bladder and/or bowel dysfunction
      attributed to the SDR was present at the latest follow-up, although in only 2
      patients (1.3%) this dysfunction was a definite complication of the rhizotomy.
      The use of pudendal monitoring and/or cutting less than 50% of the S2 roots may
      have been associated with a lower incidence of long-term sphincter dysfunction.
      Data about the nature and frequency of complications may result in further
      modifications to the SDR procedure, and is critical for counseling about SDR and 
      alternative options available for treatment of the child with spastic cerebral
      palsy.

AB  - We retrospectively reviewed the clinical course of 66 patients treated for
      generalized tonic-clonic status epilepticus at the Ege University neurological
      intensive care unit from 1988 to 1997. Seventy-two per cent of the study group
      had a pre-existing seizure disorder, and antiepileptic drug withdrawal was the
      most prominent cause of status epilepticus. The other causes included drug
      toxicity, central nervous system infection, cerebrovascular disease, tumour and
      trauma. Seventy-three per cent of all patients responded to the first-line
      therapy (diazepam and/or phenytoin), and the remainder were considered to have
      refractory status epilepticus and required pentobarbital anaesthesia. Overall
      case fatality was 21%, but death could be attributed directly to status
      epilepticus and/or treatment complication in 10% of the study group. Major
      determinants of fatal outcomes were: increasing age, longer duration of status
      epilepticus before initiation of therapy and central nervous system infection as 
      a causal factor.

TI  - Pain in central and peripheral demyelinating disorders.
PG  - 889-98
AB  - Moderate to severe pain is a common feature of central and peripheral
      demyelinating disorders. Pain in multiple sclerosis tends to occur when the
      disease is well-established and usually lingers infinitely. Pain in
      Guillain-Barre syndrome tends to be particularly severe at the time of initial
      presentation and usually resolves over 8 to 12 weeks. Pain in both conditions is 
      generally caused by either the direct effects of nerve injury or the result of
      paralysis and prolonged immobilization. Pain syndromes are well-defined in each
      disorder based on the underlying pathophysiology. Treatment involves a variety of
      pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches individualized for each specific
      pain syndrome.

PG  - 137-42
AB  - Sedative effects of single and repeated doses of 50 mg and 150 mg tolperisone
      hydrochloride (Mydocalm), a centrally active muscle-relaxing agent, were
      evaluated in a placebo-controlled double-blind clinical trial. A total of 72
      healthy young adults balanced by sex were randomized to receive 50 mg or 150 mg
      tolperisone hydrochloride or placebo t.i.d. for a period of 8 days. Control
      examinations were performed in the mornings of days 1 and 8 before intake of the 
      morning dose and at 1.5, 4 and 6 hours postdose. The psychomotoric test battery
      used in this trial revealed no sedative effects of tolperisone hydrochloride in
      the given doses at any control examination. Subjective mood ratings quantified by
      the Welzel Colored Scales were not impaired either. The lack of differences in
      sedative potentials of tolperisone hydrochloride and placebo was confirmed by
      tests on differences and by tests on equivalence using 95% CI. The present study 
      substantiates clinical experience and previous clinical trials demonstrating that
      tolperisone hydrochloride, though being a centrally active muscle relaxant, does 
      not cause any sedation and does not impair reaction times.

TI  - Evolving concepts of diagnosis, pathogenesis, and therapy of Sjogren's syndrome.
PG  - 446-56
AB  - Differences in diagnostic criteria for Sjogren's Syndrome (SS) have led to
      confusion in the research literature and in clinical practice. A particular
      challenge is the clinical diagnosis of the patients with sicca symptoms,
      fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, vague cognitive defects, and a low titer
      antinuclear antibody. Until recently, many of these patients would have been
      classified as primary SS using the European criteria. A suggested revision of the
      European criteria will require inclusion of anti SS-A antibody or characteristic 
      minor salivary gland biopsy, leading to greater agreement between European and
      San Diego criteria. Recent studies have emphasized that lacrimal and salivary
      gland flow involves an entire "functional" unit that includes the mucosal surface
      (the site of inflammation), efferent nerve signals sent to the midbrain
      (lacrimatory and salvatory nucleus), efferent neural signals from the brain, and 
      acinal/ductal structures in the gland. Thus, symptoms of dryness or pain can
      result from interferences with any part of this functional unit. The initiating
      antigens in SS remain unknown, but immune reactivity against SS-A, SS-B, fodrin, 
      alpha- amylase, and carbonic anhydrase have been demonstrated in patients with
      established disease. The inflammatory process in the gland releases
      metalloproteinases that alter the relationship of epithelial cells to their
      matrix, an interaction that is necessary for glandular function and survival.
      Therapies for SS remain inadequate. In SS patients with immune-mediated
      extraglandular manifestation (ie, lung, kidney, skin, nerve), the therapeutic
      approach is similar to systemic lupus erythematosus, although these therapies
      have relatively little effect on tear or saliva flow.

TI  - Psychotropic adjuvant analgesics for pain in cancer and AIDS.
PG  - 333-45
AB  - The 'WHO Analgesic Ladder' is a well validated approach for the selection of
      appropriate analgesic therapy for cancer pain as well as pain in AIDS. The
      mainstay of analgesic intervention for cancer and AIDS pain of moderate to severe
      intensity continues to be the appropriate use of opioid analgesics. There is,
      however, a growing appreciation for the role of adjuvant analgesics, such as
      antidepressants and other psychotropic medications, at each step of the WHO
      Analgesic Ladder, particularly in the treatment of neuropathic pain. Knowledge of
      the indications and usefulness of psychotropic analgesic drugs in cancer and AIDS
      pain populations will be most important to clinicians practicing in
      psycho-oncology/AIDS settings, particularly since these drugs are useful not only
      in the treatment of psychiatric complications of cancer and AIDS, but also as
      adjuvant analgesic agents in the management of pain. This paper reviews the
      literature on the use of antidepressants, psychostimulants, neuroleptics,
      anticonvulsants and other psychotropic analgesics in the management of cancer and
      AIDS pain. Mechanisms of analgesia, drug selection, and recommendations for
      clinical usage are discussed. The appropriate and timely use of psychotropic
      adjuvant analgesic drugs represents an opportunity for active psychiatric
      contribution to the multidisciplinary management of cancer and AIDS pain.

TI  - Developments in the treatment of alcoholism.
PG  - 857-63
AB  - The treatment of alcoholism has changed during the past 2 decades. Notable
      developments have occurred in pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and health-care
      delivery. A better understanding of the biologic basis for addiction has led to
      clinical trials of medications that target neuroreceptors. One such medication is
      the opiate antagonist naltrexone, which decreases the craving for alcohol.
      Psychosocial interventions continue to be the mainstay of alcohol treatment
      programs. The efficacy of three different therapies was demonstrated in a study
      called Project MATCH (Matching Alcoholism Treatments to Client Heterogeneity).
      This study, however, did not prove the patient-treatment "matching" hypothesis.
      In addition to therapies provided by addiction specialists, interest is growing
      in the use of brief motivational techniques in primary-care settings. As the
      field of addiction responds to an unfolding health-care delivery system, a
      broader range of treatment options in conjunction with a greater opportunity to
      individualize patient care is evolving.

TI  - Trigeminal neuralgia resulting from infarction of the root entry zone of the
      trigeminal nerve: case report.
PG  - 620-2; discussion 622-3
AB  - OBJECTIVE AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: We present a case of trigeminal neuralgia
      resulting from infarction of the root entry zone of the trigeminal nerve. This is
      the first reported case of an unusual cause of trigeminal neuralgia. CLINICAL
      PRESENTATION: A 71-year-old man presented with severe lancinating pain in the
      left V1 and V2 distributions. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain
      demonstrated a small wedge-shaped infarct at the root entry zone of the left
      trigeminal nerve in the pons. INTERVENTION: Medical management with carbamazepine
      was initially successful, but the patient later developed refractory pain and was
      unable to tolerate side effects of the medication. The patient underwent
      subsequent percutaneous glycerol rhizotomy, which resulted in complete resolution
      of his pain. CONCLUSION: Infarction of the root entry zone may produce typical
      symptoms of trigeminal neuralgia similar to a multiple sclerosis plaque at the
      root entry zone. Treatment of trigeminal neuralgia must consider the underlying
      cause. Glycerol rhizotomy may provide relief of pain for patients in whom there
      is no evidence of vascular compression.

TI  - Analgesic rebound headache in children and adolescents.
PG  - 443-7
AB  - For more than a decade, the frequent use of analgesics has been recognized to
      lead to daily headaches in adults. To date, no studies on the occurrence of
      analgesic rebound headache have been done on the pediatric population. We
      retrospectively reviewed all charts of patients with the diagnosis of headache
      seen in our pediatric headache clinic between January 1996 and May 1997. Among
      the 98 patients seen, 46 (47%) suffered from daily or near daily headaches; 30 of
      them were consuming daily analgesics. Twenty-four patients (mean age 12.1 years, 
      and mean follow-up 6.2 months) successfully discontinued their analgesics.
      Twenty-two patients were also placed on amitriptyline. A significant reduction in
      the frequency (80%), severity (47%), and number of school days missed (74%) were 
      seen. In conclusion, this data is comparable to previous observations reported in
      adults, and suggests that the daily use of analgesics might result in daily or
      near daily headaches in the pediatric population. Discontinuing daily analgesics,
      with the concomitant use of amitriptyline, is an effective treatment for
      analgesic rebound headache in this population.

TI  - Intrathecal, but not intravenous, clonidine reduces experimental thermal or
      capsaicin-induced pain and hyperalgesia in normal volunteers.
PG  - 591-6
AB  - Clonidine is approved for intraspinal administration in the treatment of
      neuropathic cancer pain. Some studies have suggested an analgesic effect after
      systemic clonidine administration. The purpose of this study was to compare the
      analgesic effects of intrathecal and IV clonidine with acute noxious stimulation 
      and with hyperalgesia from intradermal capsaicin injection in volunteers. Sixteen
      healthy volunteers received intradermal injections of capsaicin (100 microg)
      before and after the IV or intrathecal injection of clonidine 50 or 150 microg in
      a randomized, double-blind manner. Pain and areas of mechanical hyperalgesia and 
      allodynia were determined at specified intervals. In addition, pain to noxious
      heat stimulation was determined. The capsaicin injection produced pain, followed 
      by hyperalgesia and allodynia. The intrathecal, but not IV, injection of 150
      microg of clonidine reduced capsaicin-induced pain and area of hyperalgesia.
      Intrathecal clonidine (150 microg) reduced pain to heat stimulation, whereas IV
      clonidine did not. The groups did not differ in hemodynamic or sedative effects
      from clonidine. These data support the value of intraspinal administration of
      clonidine for the treatment of acute pain and of pain states associated with
      hyperalgesia. Similarly, they suggest that analgesia from the systemic
      administration of this alpha2-adrenergic agonist, if any, is weak in doses that
      produce sedation and reduce blood pressure. IMPLICATIONS: To the extent that the 
      experimental pain conditions used in this study reflect those in patients with
      acute and chronic pain, these data support the spinal rather than IV injection of
      clonidine for analgesia.

TI  - Safety and tolerance of zolpidem in the treatment of disturbed sleep: a
      post-marketing surveillance of 16944 cases.
PG  - 157-67
AB  - The subjective response to treatment with zolpidem, an imidazopyridine hypnotic, 
      was assessed in patients with insomnia under normal treatment conditions in an
      outpatients' practice in Germany. The uncontrolled clinical surveillance study
      included 16944 outpatients with subjective difficulties in initiating and/or
      maintaining sleep. Office-based neurologists, psychiatrists, internists and
      general practitioners were asked individually to adjust the dosage of zolpidem
      (age < or = 65 years, 10-20 mg; age > 65 years, 5-10 mg) over a recommended
      period of 3-4 weeks. In total, 82.8% of patients completed the survey (36% men,
      64% women, mean age 58.8 +/- 14.9 years; 58.6% without previous hypnotic
      medication; duration of sleep complaints > 6 months in 40.6%, 1-6 months in
      27.8%). Most patients (63.9%) took zolpidem on a daily basis. The average dose
      was 10 mg zolpidem per night in 74.8%, 5 mg in 19.8%, 20 mg in 2.4% and > 20 mg
      in 10 cases. Most physicians (87.6%) rated the efficacy of zolpidem as 'very
      good' or 'good'. One hundred and eighty-two (1.1%) of the 16 944 patients
      reported 268 adverse events (one adverse event in 113 cases, two adverse events
      in 53 cases and more than two adverse events in 16 cases). One hundred and
      eighteen (64.8%) of these patients (0.006% of all participating patients)
      discontinued treatment because of adverse events. Nausea (n = 36), dizziness (n =
      35), malaise (n = 23), nightmares (n = 20), agitation (n = 19), and headache (n =
      18) were the most common adverse events. There was one serious adverse reaction
      in a 48-year-old women who developed paranoid symptoms during the documentation
      phase. No life-threatening adverse event occurred. The adverse event profile
      reflected the pharmacological properties of zolpidem and underlined the
      cumulative good experience with the drug internationally.

TI  - Helping your patients with spasticity reach maximal function.
PG  - 123-6, 129-31, 135
AB  - Familiarity with spasticity and its treatment options and a rational approach to 
      care are necessary to achieve an optimal outcome in patients with this disorder. 
      Not all spasticity needs to be treated. Functional problems experienced by the
      patient and feedback from caretakers should guide decisions of whether and how to
      treat. Primary care physicians may benefit from maintaining close working
      relationships with physical medicine and rehabilitation physicians
      (physiatrists), who are experienced in assessment of spasticity, especially in
      relation to function, and can help differentiate true spasticity from rigidity
      and contracture. After underlying exacerbating factors are ruled out, a treatment
      plan starting with conservative methods and advancing to more aggressive measures
      should be followed. Consultation with physiatrists may be useful in regard to
      antispasticity medications, nerve blocks, intrathecal pumps, and postrhizotomy
      care.

TI  - Medical treatment of headache after suboccipital acoustic tumor removal.
PG  - 1111-4
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Suboccipital craniotomy is a frequently used surgical approach for
      removal of cerebellopontine angle (CPA) tumors. A frequently cited consequence,
      however, is the high incidence of postoperative headaches. Much has been written 
      regarding prevention of these headaches, but little has been written of their
      treatment. The authors review their extensive experience in suboccipital tumor
      removal and the medical management of postoperative headache, highlighting the
      recent use of a regimen of divalproex sodium and verapamil. STUDY DESIGN:
      Retrospective chart review. METHODS: The charts of a consecutive series of
      patients having suboccipital craniotomies for CPA tumors were reviewed. Presence,
      duration, and severity of headache were noted. Medical treatments and their
      effectiveness were also noted. RESULTS: Between 1980 and 1997, 228 patients
      underwent suboccipital craniotomy for removal of CPA tumors. Of these patients,
      124 (54.4%) complained of headache. For 62 (27.2%) the headaches persisted for
      more than a year after surgery. Twenty-nine patients (12.7%) received no relief
      from any medication. Ten of these patients received a regimen of divalproex
      sodium and verapamil, with all patients obtaining significant relief. CONCLUSION:
      Headache is a significant problem with the suboccipital approach for acoustic
      tumor removal. The majority of patients that complain of headache can be
      adequately treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). If pain is
      unrelieved by NSAIDs, treatment becomes problematic. The authors' early
      experience with divalproex sodium/verapamil is encouraging and deserves further
      investigation as a treatment for these refractory cases.

TI  - Prolonged severe withdrawal symptoms after acute-on-chronic baclofen overdose.
PG  - 359-63
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Baclofen is frequently used to treat muscle spasticity due to
      spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis. Baclofen overdose can lead to coma,
      respiratory depression, hyporeflexia, and flaccidity. An abrupt decrease in the
      dose of baclofen due to surgery or a rapid tapering program may result in severe 
      baclofen withdrawal syndrome manifesting hallucinations, delirium, seizures, and 
      high fever. Severe baclofen withdrawal syndrome secondary to intentional
      overdose, however, has not received mention. CASE REPORT: A 42-year-old male
      receiving chronic baclofen therapy, 20 mg/d, attempted suicide by ingesting at
      least 800 mg of baclofen. He was found in coma 2 hours postingestion with
      depressed respirations, areflexia, hypotonia, bradycardia, and hypotension.
      Treatment with intravenous fluids, atropine, dopamine, and hemodialysis was
      associated with restoration of consciousness within 2 days but disorientation,
      hallucinations, fever, delirium, hypotension, bradycardia, and coma developed
      during the following week. Baclofen withdrawal syndrome was not diagnosed until
      hospital day 9, when reinstitution of baclofen rapidly stabilized his condition. 
      Oral overdosage of baclofen causes severe neurological and cardiovascular
      manifestations due to its GABA and dominant cholinergic effects. Severe baclofen 
      withdrawal syndrome is manifest by neuropsychiatric manifestations and
      hemodynamic instability. Caution should be exercised after a baclofen overdose in
      patients receiving chronic baclofen therapy.

      painful tonic spasms (11), dysesthetic or paresthetic symptoms (3) and ocular
      ataxia (1). Complete resolution of symptoms or partial improvement was obtained, 
      respectively, in 14 and 4 of 18 patients who ended the study. Sustained
      improvement with minor side effects was obtained at dosages ranging from 600 to
      1200 mg/d. Our findings suggest that GBP may be effective for PS in MS and
      warrant a further study in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial.

TI  - Diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Effectiveness of electrotherapy and amitriptyline
      for symptomatic relief.
PG  - 1322-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of combining electrotherapy with
      amitriptyline for the management of chronic painful peripheral neuropathy in
      patients with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients (n = 26)
      with peripheral neuropathy were treated with amitriptyline. After 4 weeks, those 
      patients (n = 23) who failed to respond to amitriptyline or who only had partial 
      relief were randomized between a sham treatment group (control) or an
      electrotherapy group. Transcutaneous electrotherapy was given for 12 weeks by a
      portable unit (H-wave machine) that generated a biphasic exponentially decaying
      waveform (pulse width 4 ms, 25-35 V, > or = 2 Hz). The degree of pain and
      discomfort was graded on a scale of 0-5. An analog scale was used to record the
      overall change in symptoms. RESULTS: Amitriptyline produced some degree of
      symptomatic relief in 15 (60%) of the 26 patients by the 4th week; pain scores
      decreased from 3.8 +/- 0.1 to 2.9 +/- 0.2 (P < 0.1) and the overall reduction in 
      pain was 26 +/- 5% on an analog scale. In the amitriptyline plus sham treatment
      group (n = 9), pain scores declined from 2.8 +/- 0.3 to 1.9 +/- 0.5 (P < 0.03)
      and the overall reduction in pain was 55 +/- 12%, suggesting a procedure-related 
      placebo effect. In the group receiving combined electrotherapy and amitriptyline 
      (n = 14), symptomatic improvement occurred in 12 (85%) patients. Five (36%) of
      the patients in this group became asymptomatic. Pain scores declined from 3.2 +/-
      0.2 to 1.4 +/- 0.4 (P < 0.01) and the overall reduction in pain was 66 +/- 10%.
      The degree of reduction in pain scores and the incremental relief (above the
      amitriptyline effect) were significantly greater (P < 0.03) with electrotherapy
      as compared with sham treatment. The outcomes indicate a substantial beneficial
      effect of electrotherapy over and above any placebo influence. CONCLUSIONS: Our
      clinical observations suggest that transcutaneous electrotherapy is effective in 
      reducing the pain associated with peripheral neuropathy. This form of therapy may
      be a useful adjunctive modality when it is combined with a pharmacological agent,
      such as amitriptyline, to augment symptomatic relief.

TI  - Transient radicular irritation after spinal anesthesia induced with hyperbaric
      solutions of cerebrospinal fluid-diluted lidocaine 50 mg/ml or mepivacaine 40
      mg/ml or bupivacaine 5 mg/ml.
PG  - 765-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Transient radicular irritation (TRI) is common after spinal
      anesthesia induced with hyperbaric lidocaine 50 mg/ml. The purpose of this study 
      was to determine the incidence of TRI after spinal anesthesia with hyperbaric
      lidocaine 50 mg/ml diluted with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 1:1 and hyperbaric
      mepivacaine 40 mg/ml and hyperbaric bupivacaine 5 mg/ml. METHODS: Ninety ASA
      class I-IV patients undergoing mostly brief urological procedures under spinal
      anesthesia were randomly allocated to receive either hyperbaric lidocaine 50
      mg/ml diluted with CSF 1:1 (Group L), hyperbaric mepivacaine 40 mg/ml (Group M)
      or hyperbaric bupivacaine 5 mg/ml (Group B). Characteristics of the patients and 
      details of the surgical procedures and spinal anesthesias were similar in all
      groups except for the intensity of motor block. The patients were evaluated on
      the first postoperative day by an anesthesiologist who did not know which spinal 
      anesthetic agent had been used. RESULTS: Six patients (20%) in group L, 11
      patients (37%) in Group M and none (0%) in Group B experienced pain in the legs
      and/or back (TRI) after spinal anesthesia. CONCLUSION: TRI is frequent after
      spinal anesthesia induced with hyperbaric lidocaine 50 mg/ml diluted with CSF
      1:1. The incidence of TRI after hyperbaric mepivacaine 40 mg/ml is of the same
      magnitude. TRI could not be observed after bupivacaine spinal anesthesia.

TI  - Nimodipine-enhanced opiate analgesia in cancer patients requiring morphine dose
      escalation: a double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 17-26
AB  - The ability of nimodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, to reduce the
      daily dose of oral morphine in cancer patients who had developed dose escalation,
      was tested in 54 patients under randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      conditions. We selected patients that required at least two successive increments
      of morphine to maintain pain relief. A possible pharmacokinetic interaction
      between nimodipine and morphine was also studied in 14 patients by assaying
      steady-state serum levels of morphine and its 3- and 6-glucuronides. A total of
      30 patients completed the study, 14 and 16 in the nimodipine and placebo groups, 
      respectively. Nimodipine controlled the escalation of the morphine dose in 9
      patients (65%), and placebo in 4 (28%), the difference being statistically
      significant (P=0.03). The dose of morphine was reduced from 313+/-52 to 174+/-33 
      mg/day (P < 0.001) in the nimodipine group, and from 254+/-26 to 218+/-19 mg/day 
      (not significant) in the placebo group. The percentages of reduction in the daily
      dose of morphine also showed significant differences between both groups
      (P=0.02). One week after introducing nimodipine or placebo, while the dose of
      morphine remained similar to that of the pre-test week, the serum levels of
      morphine and its glucuronides were not modified significantly. We conclude that
      the introduction of nimodipine in patients chronically treated with morphine may 
      be a safe alternative to reduce the daily requirements of the opioid. It is
      suggested that interference with Ca2+-related events may attenuate the
      development and/or expression of tolerance to morphine in a clinically relevant
      way.

TI  - Buspirone is differentiated from diazepam in humans using a three-response drug
      discrimination procedure.
PG  - 16-26
AB  - The discriminative stimulus effects of buspirone and diazepam were examined in 12
      healthy volunteers using a three-response drug discrimination procedure and a
      within-subject design. During an initial sampling phase, the training drug
      conditions (placebo, 15 mg/70 kg buspirone, and 10 mg/70 kg diazepam) were
      identified to subjects by letter codes before oral drug administration. During a 
      subsequent training phase, subjects earned money for correct drug identifications
      made two hours after drug administration. Ten out of 12 subjects acquired the
      three-response discrimination. When lower doses of buspirone (3.75 and 7.5 mg/70 
      kg) and diazepam (2.5 and 5.0 mg/70 kg) were tested in a subsequent
      generalization testing phase, both buspirone and diazepam produced dose-related
      increases in appropriate drug identifications, without significant
      cross-generalization. Analyses of standardized and unstructured self report
      questionnaires revealed that buspirone and diazepam produced different profiles
      of effects, and that buspirone was associated with a number of "negative"
      subject-rated effects including tension, nausea, and dizziness. These results
      demonstrate a distinct profile of discriminative stimulus and subjective effects 
      for buspirone relative to diazepam which is consistent with its distinct
      pharmacological profile, and provide evidence for the sensitivity of the
      three-response drug discrimination procedure.

TI  - Effect of single-drug therapy on reduction of left atrial size in mild to
      moderate hypertension: comparison of six antihypertensive agents.
PG  - 140-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac effects of hypertension include increased left ventricular
      (LV) mass and LV hypertrophy, as well as increased left atrial size, a predictor 
      of stroke and atrial fibrillation. Although literature on reduction of LV mass
      with antihypertensive therapy is extensive, little information is available on
      effects of treatment on left atrial size. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with mild
      to moderate hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 95 to 109 mm Hg) were randomly
      allocated to treatment with atenolol, captopril, clonidine, diltiazem,
      hydrochlorothiazide, or prazosin in a double-masked trial. Two-dimensional
      targeted M-mode echocardiography was used to assess left atrial size and LV mass 
      at baseline, 8 weeks, and 1 and 2 years. Longitudinal analysis examined changes
      in left atrial size from the baseline study, statistically adjusting for age,
      race, pretreatment left atrial size and LV mass, and serial measurements of
      systolic blood pressure, body weight, urinary sodium excretion, and physical
      activity score. Without adjustment for covariates, only hydrochlorothiazide was
      associated with decreases in left atrial size from baseline at 8 weeks (-1.0 +/- 
      5.2 mm; P=0.052), 1 year (-2.0 +/- 5.1 mm; P=0.02), and 2 years (4.6+/-7.2 mm;
      P=0.002). After adjustment for effects of covariates, patients with normal left
      atrial size had greater reduction (-3.3 mm) in left atrial size at 2 years with
      hydrochlorothiazide than with any other drug. For patients with left atrial
      enlargement, left atrial size decreased significantly with hydrochlorothiazide,
      atenolol, clonidine, and diltiazem at 1 year and with all treatments at 2 years. 
      However, reduction at 2 years was greater with hydrochlorothiazide than with
      captopril or prazosin. CONCLUSIONS: Antihypertensive drugs differ in their
      effects on left atrial size. Hydrochlorothiazide was associated with greater
      overall reduction of left atrial size than other drugs effective for the
      treatment of hypertension. Reduction of left atrial size with therapy is in part 
      independent of factors known to influence left atrial size, including LV mass and
      reduction of LV mass with treatment. The clinical benefit of reducing left atrial
      size with antihypertensive treatment remains to be determined.

TI  - Painful and non-painful effects of low doses of morphine in migraine sufferers
      partly depend on excitatory amino acids and gamma-aminobutyric acid.
PG  - 79-85
AB  - Having a differential sensitivity to morphine can distinguish migraine suffers
      from healthy people who are headache-exempt. The aim of the present study was to 
      investigate whether such an abnormal response to morphine challenge is entirely
      dependent on opioid receptor activation. A role for excitatory amino acids and
      gamma-aminobutyric acid has been proposed on the basis of the effect of diazepam.
      As opposed to naloxone, this gamma-aminobutyric acid agonist was found to inhibit
      the adverse effects of low doses of morphine in migraine sufferers, while at the 
      same time being able to almost abolish morphine-induced miosis in subjects who
      underwent a short-lasting chronic pretreatment. The capacity of diazepam either
      to control the adverse effects of morphine or to induce well-being in subjects
      known to suffer from a central neurogenic pain such as migraine, is noteworthy
      even regarding the clinical treatment of other painful conditions, such as
      deafferentation pain, which is known to be not satisfactorily treated by using
      morphine.

TI  - Amitriptyline is effective in chronic but not in episodic tension-type headache: 
      pathogenetic implications.
PG  - 453-7
AB  - The tricyclic antidepressant, amitriptyline, is an effective drug for the
      treatment of chronic tension-type headache and for other chronic pain syndromes, 
      but it is also effective in the prophylaxis of an episodic type of headache such 
      as migraine. However, its efficacy in episodic tension-type headache has not yet 
      been clarified. We compared the efficacy of amitriptyline (25 mg/day) in 82
      nondepressed patients with either chronic or episodic tension-type headache in an
      open-label study. Amitriptyline significantly reduced (P < 0.05) frequency and
      duration of headache as well as analgesic consumption in chronic, but not in
      episodic, tension-type headache. Further placebo-controlled trials, possibly with
      higher doses of amitriptyline, might confirm if the different pattern of response
      to amitriptyline can be explained in terms of different involvement of central
      nociception and of peripheral myofascial factors in the chronic and in the
      episodic forms of tension-type headache.

TI  - Reversible ischemic neurologic deficit after ECT.
PG  - 42-8
AB  - We report the case of a 58-year-old woman with depression and hypertension in
      whom aphasia, right-sided hemiparesis, and a possible right visual field defect
      were identified during recovery from right unilateral electroconvulsive therapy
      (ECT). The neurologic deficits resolved over a 3-day period; the patient was
      diagnosed with a reversible ischemic neurologic deficit (RIND). Review of the
      patient literature suggests that such cerebrovascular events in the setting of
      ECT are extremely rare and possibly decreasing in frequency. Reasons for such a
      decrease may include improved screening for predisposing cardiovascular
      conditions and the widespread use of neuromuscular blockade, ventilatory support,
      and cardiovascular monitoring during the procedure. Prompt recognition of
      cerebrovascular events is important to prevent complications such as cerebral
      edema, seizures, and aspiration, as well as to use new treatments for stroke.

TI  - [Nasal ketamine compared with nasal midazolam in premedication in pediatrics].
PG  - 122-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and side effects of midazolam and ketamine
      administered nasally for pediatric premedication. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this
      double blind trial 60 children scheduled for elective surgery were randomly
      assigned to two groups to receive 0.25 mg.kg or 5 mg.kg nasal ketamine. We
      measured level of acceptance of medication, sedation, hemodynamic variables,
      reaction to separation from parents, side effects and time until recovery from
      anesthesia. RESULTS: The two groups were homogeneous. Acceptance of medication
      was good or adequate in all patients. The level of sedation was significant in
      both groups 10 min after premedication. Systolic arterial pressure was higher in 
      the ketamine group 20 min after administration of the drug and upon arrival in
      the operating theater. Reaction to separation from parents was good in all
      groups. Secretions were higher in the ketamine group and hallucinations were
      experienced by three patients in the ketamine group and by two in the midazolam
      group. We found no difference in time until spontaneous eye opening after
      surgery. No complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The nasal route is
      adequately accepted by children. Both drugs are effective by this route and
      sedation is rapid. Time until postanesthetic recovery is similar with both drugs.
      The doses used have wide safety margins.

TI  - A risk-benefit assessment of pharmacological treatments for panic disorder.
PG  - 419-30
AB  - Panic disorder, a psychiatric disorder characterised by frequent panic attacks,
      is the most common anxiety disorder, affecting 2 to 6% of the general population.
      No one line of treatment has been found to be superior, making a risk-benefit
      assessment of the treatments available useful for treating patients. Choice of
      treatment depends on a number of issues, including the adverse effect profile,
      efficacy and the presence of concomitant syndromes. Tricyclic antidepressants
      (TCAs) are beneficial in the treatment of panic disorder. They have a proven
      efficacy, are affordable and are conveniently administered. Adverse effects,
      including jitteriness syndrome, bodyweight gain, anticholinergic effects and
      orthostatic hypotension are commonly associated with TCAs, but can be managed
      successfully. Selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5HT) reuptake inhibitors 
      are also potential first line agents and are well tolerated and effective, with a
      favourable adverse effects profile. There is little risk in overdose or of
      anticholinergic effects. Adverse effects include sedation, dyspepsia and headache
      early in treatment, and sexual dysfunction and increased anxiety, but these can
      be effectively managed with proper dosage escalation and management.
      Benzodiazepines are an effective treatment, providing short-term relief of
      panic-related symptoms. Patients respond to treatment quickly, providing rapid
      relief of symptoms. Adverse effects include ataxia and drowsiness, and cognitive 
      and psycho-motor impairment. There are reservations over their first-line use
      because of concerns regarding abuse and dependence. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors,
      because of their adverse effects profile, potential drug interactions, dietary
      restrictions, gradual onset of effect and overdose risk, are not considered to be
      first-line agents. They are effective however, and should be considered for
      patients with refractory disease. Valproic acid (valproate sodium), while not
      intensively studied, shows potential for use in panic disorder. More studies are 
      needed in this area before the available data can be confirmed. As a supplement
      to drug therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy is effective. It is well
      tolerated, and may be beneficial in certain clinical situations. Its main
      drawback is the time commitment and effort needed to be made by the patient.

TI  - Advances in the treatment of fibromyalgia: current status and future directions.
PG  - 397-404
AB  - Despite significant efforts devoted to understanding the etiopathogenesis of
      fibromyalgia, its treatment still presents a challenge to practicing clinicians, 
      who must recognize the disorder and quantify the different symptoms in order to
      treat it. This article discusses recent research to identify sensitive and
      reliable measures for determining response to treatment among patients with FM,
      and the elements of therapeutic programs (pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic) for
      patients with FM along with the empirical or theoretical basis for their use.
      Future directions, including the need for systematic, controlled outcome studies 
      of therapies and evaluation of variables which may mediate the effects of
      treatment, as well as demonstration that the effects produced in outcome studies 
      generalize to settings beyond those in which the studies are initially conducted,
      are also discussed.

      muscle spasms using intrathecal baclofen via a fully implanted system, together
      with the homeopathic approach to symptom control. The homeopathy is seen to
      complement rather than to replace conventional prescribing and using both
      approaches together appears to have avoided the necessity for increasing drug
      doses and to have minimized side-effects. As well as encouraging us to take on
      experience from other disciplines, this case study also suggests that palliative 
      care could be a forum for evaluating the effectiveness of the homeopathic
      approach in symptom control in carefully designed studies.

TI  - Intrathecal baclofen infusion and subsequent orthopedic surgery in patients with 
      spastic cerebral palsy.
PG  - 1009-13
AB  - Intrathecal baclofen infusion (IBI) is an effective treatment for spasticity
      secondary to cerebral palsy (CP). OBJECT: To assess the need for orthopedic
      surgery of the lower extremities in such cases, the authors retrospectively
      reviewed the outcome in 48 patients with spastic CP who were treated with IBI.
      METHODS: Pumps were placed in 40 patients (84%) suffering from spastic
      quadriplegia and eight patients (16%) with spastic diplegia. The patients' ages
      ranged from 5 to 43 years (mean 15 years). The mean follow-up period was 53
      months (range 24-94 months). The mean baclofen dosage was 306 microg/day (range
      25-1350 microg/day). At the time of pump placement, subsequent orthopedic surgery
      was planned in 28 patients (58%); however, only 10 (21%) underwent surgery after 
      IBI therapy. In all 10 cases, the surgical procedure was planned at the time of
      initial evaluation for IBI therapy. In the remaining 18 patients, who did not
      subsequently undergo their planned orthopedic operation, it was believed that
      their lower-extremity spasticity had improved to the degree that intervention was
      no longer indicated. In addition, although six patients had undergone multiple
      orthopedic operations before their spasticity was treated, no patient required
      more than one operation after IBI treatment for spasticity. CONCLUSIONS: The
      authors conclude that IBI for treatment of spastic CP reduces the need for
      subsequent orthopedic surgery for the effects of lower-extremity spasticity. In
      patients with spastic CP and lower-extremity contractures, spasticity should be
      treated before orthopedic procedures are performed.

TI  - Quality of life: effect of reduced spasticity from intrathecal baclofen.
PG  - 47-54
AB  - Severe, uncontrolled spasticity resulting from spinal cord injury (SCI) and
      multiple sclerosis (MS) can have a profound effect on the patient's ability to
      function and thus, their quality of life. Spasticity can be dramatically reduced 
      by the continuous infusion of baclofen into the lumbar subarachnoid space using a
      drug delivery system. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of reduced 
      spasticity on quality of life using intrathecal baclofen therapy. Twenty-five
      patients with intractable spasticity treated with intrathecal baclofen
      participated in this prospective study. Spasticity was measured using the
      Ashworth and spasm scales. Quality of life was measured using the Ferrans and
      Powers Quality of Life Index (QLI) and the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP). The
      mean spasm score decreased significantly from 2.6 at baseline to 0.5 after one
      year (Friedman test; p = 0.000017). The mean Ashworth score decreased
      significantly from 3.78 at baseline to 1.48 after one year, (Friedman test; p =
      0.00000014). Though total QLI scores were not significantly different when
      comparing baseline with one year, the SIP revealed significant changes in the
      total score as well as the physical and psychosocial subscales. It is likely the 
      QLI did not demonstrate improvement in quality of life due to the emphasis of
      this tool on nonphysical domains. A qualitative analysis of two open-ended
      questions revealed positive statements about the change in quality of life when
      spasticity is well-controlled. Measuring changes in quality of life after
      specific interventions is a difficult task, requiring an accurate operational
      definition of the concept and valid instruments for measurement.

PG  - 32-5, 40-6
AB  - Controlled, continuous intrathecal infusion of baclofen injection relieves severe
      spasticity for a wide range of patients. This therapy has become a standard
      treatment option in spasticity management programs. Multidisciplinary teams,
      coordinated by an experienced neuroscience practitioner, provide treatment in
      five phases. Experience from clinical trials and commercial use of this treatment
      provides a guide for others who are initiating this therapy at their facility.
      Further prospective research is needed to accurately determine best clinical
      practice guidelines for cost effective use of this therapy.

TI  - A case of 'pure' dynamic mechano-allodynia due to a lesion of the spinal cord:
      pathophysiological considerations.
PG  - 399-404
AB  - We report the unusual observation of a patient who presented with the single
      symptom of a very intense, brush-induced allodynia (dynamic mechanical allodynia)
      which was strictly confined to the left C2 and C3 dermatomes. All investigations,
      including a cervical spinal MRI, were initially normal. The clinical picture
      remained stable for several months until the appearance of spontaneous pain and
      sensory deficits suggestive of a spinal lesion. A second MRI revealed an
      intraspinal lesion involving the C2-C5 segments. In accordance with other
      clinical and animal studies, such an observation of a 'pure' dynamic
      mechano-allodynia suggests that specific mechanisms underlie each component of
      neuropathic pain. Possible pathophysiological mechanisms are discussed in the
      light of recent experimental results obtained in animals.

TI  - Increased ocular pressure in two patients with narrow angle glaucoma treated with
      venlafaxine.
PG  - 130-1
AB  - Venlafaxine blocks the specific monoamine transporters and is devoid of
      significant action on muscarinic cholinergic receptors. To our knowledge, no
      cases of glaucoma have been reported so far. Because pain perception involves
      both serotonergic and noradrenergic mechanisms, venlafaxine also may be useful in
      neuropathic pain therapy. We report on two patients with narrow angle glaucoma
      affected by chronic pain. When venlafaxine treatment was begun, their ocular
      pressure was steadily around 17-18 mmHg. Venlafaxine was chosen (daily dose 75
      mg) because this drug is claimed not to bind on muscarinic cholinergic receptors.
      However, 4 days later the ocular pressure of the first patient increased to 22
      mmHg, which led to suspension of the drug. The ocular pressure of the second
      patient was 18.5 mmHg after a week, 21 mmHg after 2 weeks, and 23 mmHg after 16
      days. One week after suspension, ocular pressure of the patients was 17 and 18
      mmHg, respectively. Possible explanations of this ocular effect are offered:
      pharmacokinetic interference on the drugs used in glaucoma treatment, in vivo
      action on the muscarinic receptor, indirect effect via dopaminergic receptors, or
      direct effect on the ocular sympathetic postganglionic neurones. In any case,
      from a clinical viewpoint, caution should be used when giving venlafaxine to
      patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, and ocular pressure must be monitored.

TI  - Conversion to high dose gabapentin monotherapy in patients with medically
      refractory partial epilepsy.
PG  - 188-93
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of high dose gabapentin (GBP)
      monotherapy (3,000-4,800 mg/day) in patients with medically refractory partial
      epilepsy. METHODS: GBP monotherapy at daily doses up to 4,800 mg was attempted in
      patients participating in the open-label phase of a double-blind,
      dose-controlled, GBP monotherapy trial. For those who achieved monotherapy, the
      types and severity of adverse events were assessed and the average seizure
      frequency per 28 days while maintained on the highest daily GBP dose was compared
      to the seizure frequency during the baseline phase of the double blind trial.
      Correlation analysis between GBP serum level, total daily dose, and percentage of
      seizure change from baseline was performed. RESULTS: A total of 45 patients
      participated in the open-label phase of the trial and 23 (51%) were converted
      successfully to GBP monotherapy. In those patients, the average daily gabapentin 
      dose was 3,900 mg and the mean length of follow-up was 252 days. Compared to
      baseline, there was a mean reduction of 54%, 43%, and 14% for simple partial,
      complex partial and secondarily generalized seizures respectively, while
      maintained on high-dose GBP monotherapy. A significant linear correlation between
      daily GBP dosage (2,400-4,800 mg) and resultant mean serum levels was found (r = 
      0.51; p < 0.01). There was no significant correlation between seizure frequency
      and total daily GBP dose or with serum levels. High-dose GBP monotherapy was well
      tolerated; only one patient exited the trial because of adverse events. The most 
      common adverse event was tiredness/sleepiness and was not dose-related.
      CONCLUSIONS: GBP monotherapy is well tolerated in daily doses of up to 4,800 mg
      and is effective in a subgroup of patients with medically refractory partial
      epilepsy.

TI  - Teenagers: mental health and psychological issues.
PG  - 181-92
AB  - Adolescence is a developmental period marked by multiple challenges and demands
      which create a heightened vulnerability to the development of emotional
      disorders. Primary care physicians are in an ideal position to intervene in the
      early stages and prevent the tragic consequences which can occur with an
      untreated mental health disorder. This article reviews the assessment and
      treatment of adolescent mental health in the primary care medical setting.
      Knowledge of these disorders and their manifestations in the primary care
      environment will enable clinicians to provide higher quality medical care and
      will reduce the potential for continual life disruptions into the adult years.

TI  - Potential effects of common drugs on stroke recovery.
PG  - 454-6
AB  - Studies in laboratory animals clearly show that the rate and extent of functional
      recovery after focal brain injury can be modulated by drugs affecting certain
      neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. Preliminary clinical studies
      suggest that similar drug effects occur in humans recovering from stroke.
      Understanding these pharmacological effects is important because several of the
      classes of drugs that impair recovery in laboratory experiments are used to treat
      coincident medical problems in patients who have had a stroke.

TI  - Acute withdrawal syndrome related to the administration of analgesic and sedative
      medications in adult intensive care unit patients.
PG  - 676-84
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To estimate the frequency of acute withdrawal syndrome related to the
      administration of analgesic and sedative medications in mechanically ventilated
      adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients; to identify associated clinical
      factors. DESIGN: Retrospective review of medical records. SETTING: An adult
      trauma/surgical ICU in an urban Level I trauma center. PATIENTS: Twenty-eight
      mechanically ventilated adult trauma/ surgical ICU patients requiring >7 days of 
      ICU care. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Daily doses of all 
      opioid, sedative, hypnotic, and major tranquilizer drugs administered to each
      patient were measured, as was duration of ICU stay, duration of mechanical
      ventilation, and duration of the administration of analgesic, sedative, and
      neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) for each patient. All opioids and
      benzodiazepines were converted to their respective fentanyl and lorazepam
      equivalent units based on potency and bioavailability. Calculation of the weaning
      rate for each patient during tapering from opioid and benzodiazepine medications 
      was performed. The presence or absence of acute withdrawal syndrome was
      identified for each patient. Nine (32.1%) patients developed acute withdrawal
      syndrome potentially related to the administration of analgesic or sedative
      medications. Patients in the withdrawal group received significantly higher mean 
      daily (p = .049) and peak (p = .032) doses of fentanyl equivalents, as well as
      higher mean daily lorazepam equivalents (p = .049) compared with patients not
      experiencing withdrawal. Patients in the withdrawal group were also significantly
      more likely to have received neuromuscular blocking agents (p = .004) or propofol
      (p =.026) for >1 day during ICU admission compared with patients not experiencing
      withdrawal. Duration of mechanical ventilation (p = .049), benzodiazepine therapy
      (p = .048), and propofol therapy (p = .049) was also significantly longer in the 
      group experiencing withdrawal. Withdrawal patients received a significantly lower
      mean daily dose of haloperidol (p = .026). There was a significant association
      between the development of withdrawal syndrome and the presence of ARDS (p =
      .017). Finally, the slopes of the lines representing opioid and benzodiazepine
      drug weaning were more steep for the withdrawal group, although these results did
      not achieve statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that
      mechanically ventilated adult patients with extended ICU care (> or =7 days) who 
      receive large doses of analgesic and sedative medications are at risk for acute
      withdrawal syndromes during drug weaning. The association between ARDS and
      withdrawal syndrome, combined with the observation that withdrawal syndromes were
      also associated with the use of neuromuscular blocking agents and prolonged
      mechanical ventilation, suggests that patients with ARDS may be more likely to
      receive high doses of analgesic and sedative medications, and are therefore at
      increased risk for withdrawal syndrome.

TI  - Parasomnias including the restless legs syndrome.
PG  - 183-202
AB  - The three states of mammalian being, W, REM sleep, and NREM sleep, are not
      mutually exclusive, and may occur simultaneously, oscillate rapidly, or appear in
      dissociated or incomplete form to produce primary sleep parasomnias. In addition,
      dysfunctions of a wide variety of organ systems may take adwide variety of organ 
      systems may take advantage of the sleeping state to declare themselves, resulting
      in secondary sleep parasomnias. Contrary to popular opinion, the majority of the 
      often bizarre and frightening experiences are not the manifestation of underlying
      psychological or psychiatric conditions. There is an interesting interaction
      between sleep-disordered breathing and parasominas. Formal study in an
      experienced sleep disorders center will usually reveal a diagnosable and
      treatable condition that explains the spells. Continued study of unusual
      sleep-related events undoubtedly will reveal more fascinating conditions,
      expanding our knowledge of sleep physiology, and strengthening the bonds between 
      clinicians and basic-science sleep researchers.

TI  - New drugs for epilepsy.
PG  - 141-8
AB  - Seizure freedom with no side-effects is the aim of treatment, and new
      antiepileptic drugs have not lived up to expectations; only a few patients with
      chronic epilepsy have been rendered seizure-free. These treatments have
      side-effects but their safety profile may be better than older alternatives,
      although chronic effects have not yet been established. This article reviews
      newly marketed antiepileptic drugs. It concentrates on shortcomings of current
      antiepileptic treatment and on the way drugs are developed. A new approach to
      treatment is long overdue. The development of rational antiepileptic treatments
      should be strongly encouraged. More clinically relevant paradigms need to be
      developed and incorporated into clinical trial programmes as these are presently 
      biased in their designs towards regulatory issues.

PG  - 370-6
AB  - The effect of divalproex sodium (DVP) on gamma-aminobutyric acid-B (GABAB)
      receptor function in humans was assessed by measuring growth hormone (GH)
      responses to a challenge with a GABAB receptor agonist, baclofen, in 10 male
      healthy volunteers. Each subject received 20 mg of baclofen at 10:00 A.M., and
      blood samples were collected for measuring GH before and 30, 60, 90, 120, 150,
      180 min after baclofen administration. The baclofen challenge test was repeated
      after 1 week of treatment with DVP (1000 mg/day). The results showed that the
      plasma GH response to baclofen was significantly attenuated by the DVP treatment 
      and that the degree of attenuation was positively correlated with the blood
      levels of valproic acid. Our findings suggest that DVP downregulates hypothalamic
      GABAB receptor function in humans.

TI  - Medication use for low back pain in primary care.
PG  - 607-14
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A longitudinal observational study of primary care patients with
      low back pain. OBJECTIVES: 1) To describe medications prescribed for back pain,
      2) to identify patient characteristics associated with type of drug therapy, 3)
      to determine if the prescription of certain drugs is associated with better
      outcomes, and 4) to compare physician prescribing behavior with national
      guidelines. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Few previous studies have focused on
      medication prescribing patterns for back pain in primary care. METHODS:
      Two-hundred nineteen patients aged 20-69 years who were making a first visit for 
      an episode of back pain were studied. After the visit, patients completed
      questionnaires regarding sociodemographic characteristics, health status, back
      pain experience, and use of medications. Symptom severity and dysfunction were
      assessed by telephone 1 week after the visit. RESULTS: Sixty-nine percent of
      patients were prescribed nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 35% muscle
      relaxants, 12% narcotics, and 4% acetaminophen. Twenty percent received no
      medications. Patients were more likely to receive medications if they had a
      desire for medication, pain below the knee, less than 3 weeks of pain before
      visit, more severe symptoms, or greater dysfunction. Patients with more severe
      symptoms were more likely to receive narcotics or muscle relaxants. Patients with
      greater dysfunction were also more likely to receive narcotics. Type of drug
      therapy predicted symptom severity but not dysfunction after 1 week. Controlling 
      for other factors, those receiving medications had less severe symptoms after 1
      week than patients who received no medication. Patients receiving both muscle
      relaxants and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs had the best outcomes.
      Medication use for back pain in this health maintenance organization was
      generally concordant with national guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: Nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs, often augmented by muscle relaxants, are a standard
      medical treatment for back pain in primary care. In this observational study,
      patients prescribed medications, particularly muscle relaxants, reported less
      severe symptoms after 1 week than those receiving no medications. However,
      randomized trials are needed to determine which medication or combinations of
      medications are most effective.

TI  - Tiagabine. A review of its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties and
      therapeutic potential in the management of epilepsy.
PG  - 437-60
AB  - Tiagabine is a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) uptake inhibitor which is
      structurally related to nipecotic acid but has an improved ability to cross the
      blood-brain barrier. Clinical trials have shown that tiagabine is effective as
      add-on therapy in the management of patients with refractory partial epilepsy. In
      short term studies of this indication, tiagabine < or = 64 mg/day for 7 to 12
      weeks reduced the complex partial and simple partial seizure frequency by > or = 
      50% in 8 to 31 and 28.2 to 37% of patients, respectively. Tiagabine appeared to
      produce a sustained reduction in seizure frequency in studies of up to 12 months'
      duration. Data from preliminary studies are currently insufficient to confirm the
      usefulness of tiagabine when used as monotherapy or in the treatment of children 
      with epilepsy. Further studies are, therefore, necessary to more fully elucidate 
      the efficacy of the drug in these settings. Adverse events associated with
      tiagabine are primarily CNS-related and include dizziness, asthenia, nonspecific 
      nervousness and tremor. Skin rash or psychosis occurred with similar frequencies 
      among tiagabine- and placebo-treated patients. With long term administration (>
      or = 1 year for many patients), the profile and incidence of adverse events was
      similar to that for short term therapy. Tiagabine does not appear to affect the
      hepatic metabolism of other drugs such as carbamazepine and phenytoin. Possible
      disadvantages of tiagabine include its short plasma elimination half-life,
      necessitating 2 to 4 times daily administration, and its inducible hepatic
      metabolism. Thus, tiagabine is a new antiepileptic agent with a novel mechanism
      of action, which has demonstrated efficacy in the adjunctive treatment of
      patients with refractory partial epilepsy. Further investigation of the efficacy 
      of tiagabine is expected to provide a clearer definition of its place in the
      treatment of epilepsy and its relative merits in relation to other antiepileptic 
      drugs.

TI  - Scalp dysesthesia.
PG  - 327-30
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cutaneous dysesthesia syndrome is a disorder characterized by chronic
      cutaneous symptoms without objective findings. Patients complain of burning,
      stinging, or itching, which is often triggered or exacerbated by psychological or
      physical stress. These symptoms may be manifestations of an underlying
      psychiatric disorder or may represent a type of chronic pain syndrome.
      OBSERVATIONS: Eleven women presented with chronic severe pain and/or pruritus of 
      the scalp only without objective physical findings, a condition we term "scalp
      dysesthesia." Five women described pain, stinging, or burning only; 4 women
      complained of pain and pruritus; and 2 women reported pruritus only. The patients
      ranged in age from 36 to 70 years. The duration of symptoms ranged from 9 months 
      to 7 years. Five women had physician-diagnosed psychiatric disorders, including
      dysthymic disorder, generalized anxiety, and somatization. Seven women reported
      that stress triggers or exacerbates their symptoms. Eight women experienced
      improvement or complete resolution of symptoms with treatment with low-dose
      doxepin hydrochloride or amitriptyline hydrochloride. One patient responded
      completely to treatment with sertraline and hydroxyzine hydrochloride but then
      experienced a relapse. CONCLUSIONS: We describe 11 patients with a new syndrome
      that we term scalp dysesthesia. Of 11 patients, 9 benefited from treatment with
      low doses of antidepressants.

TI  - The neurochemistry of central pain: evidence from clinical studies, hypothesis
      and therapeutic implications.
PG  - 109-14
AB  - Recent evidence suggests that central pain, i.e., pain due to central nervous
      system damage, may be due to a deranged neurotransmission between the sensory
      thalamus and sensory cortical areas. Central pain can be controlled either by
      opposing glutamate neurotransmission or potentiating GABAergic transmission. It
      is speculated that a relative hypofunction of the GABAergic inhibition both at
      thalamic and cortical levels leads to a sectorial excitatory hypertonus in those 
      same areas. A blend of the two should mark each patient. A pharmacological
      dissection approach is provided that should optimize the treatment, up to now
      globally poor, of central pain.

TI  - Evaluation of electronic equipment for quantitative registration of tremor.
PG  - 36-40
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To test new electronic equipment, TREMOR, for quantitative
      registration of rest tremor and kinetic tremor of the extremities. PATIENTS AND
      METHODS: The tremor intensity of rest tremor and kinetic tremor was studied in 14
      multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Clonazepam was used in an open study in 11 MS
      patients to evaluate the sensitivity of TREMOR, compared to the clinical
      observations. RESULTS: We found no diurnal variations in tremor. Five patients
      discontinued the trial because of side effects due to clonazepam. Clonazepam
      significantly reduced clinically rest tremor in all 6 patients and clinically
      kinetic tremor in 5 patients. Tested by TREMOR all patients showed significant
      reduction in rest tremor and kinetic tremor. Correlation between electronic
      assessment of kinetic tremor, clinical score and Peg board test were good.
      CONCLUSION: TREMOR was found useful for assessment of the severity of tremor in
      patients with kinetic tremor and thereby avoid intra- and interobserver
      variation.

TI  - High dose gabapentin in refractory partial epilepsy: clinical observations in 50 
      patients.
PG  - 161-6
AB  - Fifty patients with refractory partial seizures took part in a prospective,
      observational study of adjuvant gabapentin (GBP) in increasing doses.
      Thirty-three were started on 400 mg GBP daily with further weekly increments of
      400 mg until seizures came under control for at least 6 months or to the limit of
      tolerability. A further 17 patients, not fully controlled on low dose GBP,
      followed the same regimen. All patients took the drug three times daily.
      Comparisons were made with seizure numbers during a 3-month baseline during which
      antiepileptic medication remained unchanged. Overall, 24 of the 50 patients
      documented a seizure reduction of 50% or more. Fifteen did so at or below 2400 mg
      GBP daily. Three of these patients became seizure-free. The remaining nine
      appeared to respond to higher daily doses of GBP (1:2800 mg; 3:3600 mg; 1:4000
      mg; 1:4800 mg; 3:6000 mg), with two becoming seizure-free. Side-effects most
      commonly reported included tiredness, dizziness, headache and diplopia. On GBP
      doses exceeding 3600 mg daily, three patients developed flatulence and diarrhoea 
      and two more had myoclonic jerks. Mean circulating GBP concentrations (mg/l) at
      each 1200 mg dose level were as follows: 1200 mg-4.1; 2400 mg-8.6; 3600 mg 13.2; 
      4800 mg 15.5; 6000 mg-17.2. In six patients, including three taking 6000 mg
      daily, GBP concentrations continued to rise linearly at each dosage increment.
      Although limited, our results do not support the suggestion that GBP absorption
      is saturable. High dose GBP may be effective in controlling seizures in patients 
      with refractory partial epilepsy.

AB  - Proton-pump inhibitors are the most effective drugs introduced to date for
      suppressing gastric acid production. Although they are used to treat the same
      conditions as histamine type-2 receptor antagonists, they differ from the latter 
      drugs in how they inhibit acid production, and in how they should be given.
      Initial concerns over potential ill effects of hypergastrinemia due to long-term 
      acid suppression with proton-pump inhibitors have been unfounded.

TI  - A parasomnia overlap disorder involving sleepwalking, sleep terrors, and REM
      sleep behavior disorder in 33 polysomnographically confirmed cases.
PG  - 972-81
AB  - A series of 33 patients with combined (injurious) sleepwalking, sleep terrors,
      and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (viz. "parasomnia overlap
      disorder") was gathered over an 8-year period. Patients underwent clinical and
      polysomnographic evaluations. Mean age was 34 +/- 14 (SD) years; mean age of
      parasomnia onset was 15 +/- 16 years (range 1-66); 70% (n = 23) were males. An
      idiopathic subgroup (n = 22) had a significantly earlier mean age of parasomnia
      onset (9 +/- 7 years) than a symptomatic subgroup (n = 11) (27 +/- 23 years, p = 
      0.002), whose parasomnia began with either of the following: neurologic
      disorders, n = 6 [congenital Mobius syndrome, narcolepsy, multiple sclerosis,
      brain tumor (and treatment), brain trauma, indeterminate disorder (exaggerated
      startle response/atypical cataplexy)]; nocturnal paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, 
      n = 1; posttraumatic stress disorder/major depression, n = 1; chronic
      ethanol/amphetamine abuse and withdrawal, n = 1; or mixed disorders
      (schizophrenia, brain trauma, substance abuse), n = 2. The rate of DSM-III-R
      (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 3rd edition, revised) Axis 1 psychiatric
      disorders was not elevated; group scores on various psychometric tests were not
      elevated. Forty-five percent (n = 15) had previously received psychologic or
      psychiatric therapy for their parasomnia, without benefit. Treatment outcome was 
      available for n = 20 patients; 90% (n = 18) had substantial parasomnia control
      with bedtime clonazepam (n = 13), alprazolam and/or carbamazepine (n = 4), or
      self-hypnosis (n = 1). Thus, "parasomnia overlap disorder" is a treatable
      condition that emerges in various clinical settings and can be understood within 
      the context of current knowledge on parasomnias and motor control/dyscontrol
      during sleep.

TI  - Delayed segmental axial dystonia of the trunk on standing after lumbar disk
      operation.
PG  - 193-7
AB  - We report four patients with various degrees of chronic, tonic, mildly painful,
      or non-painful, kyphoscolioses in orthostatism, which developed weeks, or months,
      after one or several laminectomies for lumbar disk hernia, in the absence of
      recurring radicular pain or acute lumbar pain. No family history or personal
      antecedent, of focal or generalized dystonia was found and the dystonia was not
      seen in any of the four patients pre-operatively, or during the immediate
      post-operative period. Only ill-defined lumbar 'discomfort', unlike their
      pre-operative lumbago, was reported by the patients, before and during the
      occurrence of the pathologic trunk posture on standing. Asymmetric lumbar muscle 
      tonic contraction and hypertrophy was found on physical examination. In all
      patients, the kyphoscoliosis was maximal when standing, partially disappeared
      when seated, and completely when lying down. One patient responded well to
      clonazepam, but the other three showed no improvement with either clonazepam or
      local injections of botulinum toxin; L-dopa was ineffective in all cases, and
      trihexiphenidyle in three.

TI  - Does prolonged oral treatment with sustained-release morphine tablets influence
      immune function?
PG  - 166-72
AB  - Opioids such as morphine are the mainstay of acute and chronic pain treatment.
      The purpose of this study was to investigate the immunosuppressive effects of
      morphine in patients with pain syndromes. We investigated 10 patients with
      chronic pain syndromes undergoing treatment with oral sustained-release morphine 
      (30-240 mg/d) before and after 1,4, and 12 wk of treatment compared with healthy 
      control subjects without morphine treatment. Immunological variables of the
      cellular and humoral immune axis showed that 1) total lymphocyte counts and the
      distribution of lymphocyte subpopulations, including helper T-cell/suppressor
      cytotoxic T-cell ratios (CD4/CD8 ratios), did not change compared with baseline
      or healthy control subjects; 2) proliferation of peripheral mononuclear cells
      (PMC) was not impaired by morphine treatment; 3) interleukin 2 production
      increased after 4 wk of treatment with morphine; and 4) immunoglobulin (Ig)
      production was reduced before initiation of therapy in pain patients and
      decreased further during morphine treatment, whereas Ig concentrations in the
      circulation remained at normal levels. These results indicate that treatment with
      oral, sustained-release morphine does not have a suppressive effect on overall
      PMC function. On the other hand, Ig production was impaired in patients with
      chronic pain and was further suppressed by morphine. Whether this suppression of 
      humoral immune function has a clinical impact on the immune system as a whole
      remains to be determined. Implications: Treatment of patients with chronic pain
      with oral, sustained-release morphine does not influence cellular immune
      function, but it suppresses the already attenuated production of immunoglobulins.

TI  - Management of spasticity.
PG  - 498-501
AB  - Recent open studies and two placebo-controlled studies confirm the potential role
      of Botulinum toxin A in the treatment of focal spasticity in adults and children.
      The effect of the toxin might not only be mediated by the paresis of extrafusal, 
      but also intrafusal muscle fibres, thereby altering the afferent discharge. To
      enhance its effectiveness, an additional electrical stimulation seems promising. 
      Most patients tolerate the neurolytic agent well. Two individuals, however,
      suffered from an intermittent tetraparesis after treatment. The repetitive
      magnetic stimulation and the use of gabapentin might be other new therapeutic
      options in the management of spasticity.

TI  - Spinal, epidural or propofol anaesthesia for out-patient knee arthroscopy?
PG  - 1341-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: We have compared three different methods of anaesthesia for
      out-patient knee arthroscopy in terms of perioperative conditions, postoperative 
      pain, time taken and economy. METHODS: 91 ASA I-II patients scheduled for
      elective knee arthroscopy were included. After premedication with diazepam 10 mg 
      and naproxene 500 mg orally, they were randomly assigned into one of three
      groups: Group S (n=32) received spinal anaesthesia with lidocaine 50 mg/ml 1.5-2 
      ml in 7.5% glucose through a 27-G Quincke needle, Group E (n=29) received
      epidural anaesthesia with mepivacaine 20 mg/ml and epinephrine 5 microg/ml, 15-20
      ml, and Group P (n=30) received propofol anaesthesia with a bolus induction of 2 
      mg/kg followed by infusion. RESULTS: The time from start of anaesthesia until
      start of operation was significantly less in Group P than in the two other
      Groups: 7.4+/-5.4 min as compared to 23.0+/-4.8 min in Group S and 31.0+/-9.1 min
      in Group E (mean+/-SD, P<0.05). After end of surgery, the duration of the
      postoperative regional block was 75+/-28 min in Group S and 125+/-79 min in Group
      E (P<0.05). In Group S and Group E the postoperative pain was significantly less 
      than in Group P at admission to the recovery unit and 60, 120 and 180 min later
      (P<0.05). The overall incidence of post-operative nausea or vomiting was less
      than 5% with no differences between the groups. One patient in Group E had block 
      failure and one patient in Group S had a post-spinal headache. The perioperative 
      costs of drugs and disposables were highest in Group P (30 USD) and lowest in
      Group S (6.5 USD). CONCLUSION: Propofol anaesthesia results in the shortest stay 
      in the operation theatre but a higher degree of postoperative pain and a higher
      cost of drugs and disposables.

TI  - Infusion of intrathecal baclofen for generalized dystonia in cerebral palsy.
PG  - 73-6
AB  - Generalized dystonia occurs in 15 to 25% of persons with cerebral palsy (CP) and 
      responds poorly to medical and surgical treatments. OBJECT: After the authors
      observed a woman whose dystonic CP was dramatically improved by continuous
      infusion of intrathecal baclofen, they designed this pilot study to evaluate the 
      effect of this treatment on a group of patients with dystonic CP. METHODS: The
      authors assessed the short-term response to intrathecal baclofen infusion in 12
      patients with dystonic CP. An intrathecal catheter was inserted percutaneously
      and connected to an external microinfusion pump. The infusion began at a rate of 
      100 microg/day and was increased by 50 microg every 12 hours until the dystonia
      abated, adverse effects occurred, or the dose reached 900 microg/day with no
      improvement. Two observers, one blinded and one not blinded to the patient's
      treatment status, viewed videotapes made before and after the infusions and
      graded the dystonia in eight body regions, using a 5-point scale. Overall and
      regional scores were compared by using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. CONCLUSIONS:
      Dystonia diminished in 10 of 12 patients whose average daily dose of intrathecal 
      baclofen was 575 microg. Overall dystonia scores and scores for the extremities, 
      trunk, and cervical regions were significantly better after infusion (p = 0.003).
      The two observers' scores were not significantly different. Programmable infusion
      pumps were subsequently implanted in eight patients for long-term therapy and
      improvement was sustained in six (p < 0.05). Intrathecal baclofen infusion is a
      promising treatment option for generalized dystonia associated with CP. The
      effects of intrathecal baclofen infusion on dystonia can be evaluated by using
      short-term continuous infusions.

TI  - The influence of established and new antiepileptic drugs on visual perception. 1.
      A placebo-controlled, double-blind, single-dose study in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 35-47
AB  - The influence of single oral dosages of carbamazepine (CBZ), valproic acid,
      vigabatrin (VGB), lamotrigine (LTG), gabapentin (GBP), and losigamone (LSG) on
      visual perception was investigated in ten healthy volunteers according to a
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study design. The test battery
      comprised visual acuity, the Lanthony-D-15-desature colour perception test,
      increment, postadaptation and transient tritanopia threshold measurements,
      perception threshold assessment for monochromatic and chromatic gaussian dots,
      monochromatic gratings and gratings of differing spatial frequency, and critical 
      flicker fusion tests with various stimuli. The only consistent and partly
      significant effects were seen after VGB and GBP. After VGB, increment,
      postadaptation and transient tritanopia thresholds and the critical flicker
      fusion increased, whereas GBP led to a somewhat converse profile. The other tests
      were not influenced consistently by any antiepileptic drug (AED). We conclude
      that: (i) gamma-amino-butyric acid-(GABA)-related properties as under the
      prototype drug VGB result in specific alterations of the transient tritanopia
      phenomenon which is consistent with the physiological hypothesis for this retinal
      paradigm based on extracellular recordings in primates. The possible mechanisms
      why VGB improved critical flicker fusion as the only AED in this trial are
      discussed. The profile of GBP indicates a unique mechanism of action. We have not
      observed specific influences on visual perception under AEDs which act mainly via
      alterations of ion membrane conductance. The transient tritanopia and flicker
      fusion paradigms we used appear to be promising to investigate antiepileptic
      drugs with hitherto unknown modes of actions in human noninvasively.

TI  - Management of impairment, disability, and handicap due to multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 1184-96
AB  - In this article, we update management measures for patients with multiple
      sclerosis (MS) that can improve or prevent impairment, disability, and handicap
      and include those factors that a primary-care physician can implement or
      facilitate. The medical literature since 1989 was reviewed. Although new drug
      trials hold promise to decrease impairment from MS, well-coordinated
      interdisciplinary care to minimize disability and handicap most profoundly affect
      the quality of life for patients with MS. MS is usually not severely disabling,
      and appropriately timed intervention can prevent secondary impairment and reduce 
      disability and handicap. Pharmacologic, physical, and psychosocial
      issues--ranging from spasticity, pain, weakness, and tremor to neurogenic bowel
      management and sexuality--are addressed. General wellness measures remain
      important. The influence of the Americans With Disabilities Act is discussed, and
      specific adaptive equipment and social resources are outlined. The ultimate goals
      of management of patients with MS are functional independence and efficient use
      of medical and community resources: a focus on "ability" rather than
      "disability." Although impairment can limit function, wellness and adjustment
      have no boundaries.

      study.
PG  - 559-60
AB  - Transdermal clonidine has recently been reported to be efficacious in the
      prophylaxis of cluster headache. A 2-week course of transdermal clonidine (5 mg
      the first week, 7.5 mg the second week) preceded by a 5-day run-in period, was
      administered to 16 patients with episodic cluster headache in an active cluster
      period. In 5 patients, the painful attacks disappeared after the seventh day of
      treatment. For the group as a whole, no significant variations in headache
      frequency, pain intensity, or attack duration were observed between the run-in
      period and the first and second weeks of treatment (ANOVA). Further studies are
      necessary to clarify the effectiveness of transdermal clonidine in the
      prophylaxis of episodic cluster headache.

TI  - Complex regional pain syndrome.
PG  - 2265-70, 2275-6
AB  - The term "complex regional pain syndrome" encompasses causalgia and reflex
      sympathetic dystrophy. Symptoms of burning pain with autonomic and tissue changes
      begin shortly after an injury, usually to a distal extremity. The diagnosis is
      based on the history and the clinical findings. No confirmatory tests are
      available, although plain radiographs or a three-phase bone scan may be helpful
      in diagnosing some cases. Aggressive treatment, which may include sympathetic
      blockade, medications, physical therapy and psychotherapy, is essential for a
      favorable outcome. Despite treatment, many patients are left with varying degrees
      of chronic pain and disability.

TI  - Benzodiazepine self-administration in humans and laboratory animals--implications
      for problems of long-term use and abuse.
PG  - 1-37
AB  - Drug reinforcement may represent the primary behavioral-pharmacological mechanism
      underlying two types of problematic use of benzodiazepines--recreational abuse by
      polydrug abusers and inappropriate chronic use by patients. High dose polydrug
      abuse for the purpose of getting high is readily recognized as a significant
      social problem. Inappropriate chronic benzodiazepine use is more subtle but
      relatively common: for anxiolytics, 36% of past-year users (3% of the adult
      population in the US) report using these drugs for 4 consecutive months or
      longer. The risks of such long-term use are much better documented than the
      benefits. This paper provides a current review of various problems that have been
      identified with the long-term use and the recreational abuse of benzodiazepines, 
      including memory impairment, risk of accidents, falls and hip fractures in the
      elderly, a withdrawal syndrome, brain damage, overuse in the elderly, overuse by 
      chronic pain patients, overuse by alcoholics and recreational abuse among
      alcoholics and polydrug abusers. A comprehensive review of the literature on
      benzodiazepine reinforcing effects in humans and laboratory animals is also
      provided. Drug self-administration studies in humans and laboratory animals
      provide models of both types of problematic benzodiazepine use. Recreational
      abuse of benzodiazepines has been modeled in human research with polydrug abusers
      and in laboratory animal studies, which show that the reinforcing effect of
      benzodiazepines is intermediate relative to other sedative compounds and is
      increased in subjects with histories of previous sedative drug
      self-administration. The problem of inappropriate long-term use of
      benzodiazepines by people without histories of drug abuse has been partially
      modeled in human studies showing that benzodiazepines function as reinforcers in 
      subjects with anxiety, insomnia, and histories of moderate alcohol consumption,
      and in preclinical studies showing stable, low-rate benzodiazepine self-injection
      with concurrent physical dependence under conditions of continuous availability. 
      Both human and animal research suggests that the drug history and current
      behavioral context may be important in the establishment of benzodiazepines as
      reinforcers. Limited human and animal research provides little support for the
      common belief that physical dependence enhances benzodiazepine reinforcement.

TI  - Baclofen toxicity in patients with severely impaired renal function.
PG  - 1315-20
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report the toxic effects of baclofen in patients with severely
      impaired renal function. DATA SOURCES: From 1991 to 1995, nine patients with
      severely impaired renal function (2 not receiving dialysis, 1 undergoing
      continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis [CAPD], and 6 receiving maintenance
      hemodialysis), who exhibited clinical toxicity after baclofen therapy at our
      hospital were included for analysis. Another seven cases from the literature
      obtained by computerized (MEDLINE) and manual (Index Medicus) search methods
      published between 1980 and 1995 were also reviewed. INTERVENTION: Among our nine 
      patients, the six undergoing chronic hemodialysis and one not undergoing dialysis
      received early (< 48 h) hemodialysis after toxic symptoms developed. The patient 
      undergoing CAPD received late hemodialysis (> 72 h), and the other patient who
      had not undergone dialysis received only supportive care. RESULTS: A review of
      these 16 cases revealed that most patients received only small doses and very
      short-term baclofen therapy. Altered consciousness was the major presenting
      feature. Severe acute complications, such as seizures and respiratory depression,
      were relatively uncommon among patients with severely impaired renal function.
      However, abdominal pain, which has previously rarely been reported, was noted in 
      five of our nine patients. Most patients showed clinical improvement after
      hemodialysis. An analysis of these nine patients revealed that those who received
      early hemodialysis had a shorter recovery time than the patient who received only
      supportive care (2.71 +/- 0.42, respectively, vs. 9 d; p < 0.01). A lag of
      several hours between the end of the hemodialysis session and an improvement in
      the level of consciousness was noted. DISCUSSION: As most patients with severely 
      impaired renal function developed toxic symptoms soon after initiating a low-dose
      baclofen regimen, the accumulated dosage was small and severe complications were 
      less common. Abdominal pain may have occurred as a result of the
      gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated cholinergic effect exerted by baclofen. The
      delay in conscious recovery after hemodialysis may be due to a delay in the
      clearance of baclofen from the central nervous system. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with
      severely impaired renal function generally develop baclofen intoxication soon
      after the initiation of low-dose therapy. Thus, the administration of baclofen,
      regardless of the dosage, in these patients is not appropriate. Abdominal pain,
      in addition to altered consciousness, is a common presenting feature in patients 
      with renal failure who have baclofen intoxication. Hemodialysis is effective in
      alleviating the clinical symptoms and shortening the recovery time for such
      patients.

TI  - Pregnancy and multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 977-89
AB  - In this review, we summarize the available information on the short- and
      long-term effects of pregnancy on the course of multiple sclerosis (MS).
      Published studies that used established criteria for the diagnosis of MS were
      given more weight than studies in which the criteria for diagnosis were unstated 
      or unclear. Population-based studies were emphasized more than clinic-based
      studies, unless the clinic base was well defined and thought to be reasonably
      representative of the MS population in the geographic area. For completeness,
      small studies were also included but weighted accordingly in our overall
      conclusions. Methodologic limitations and biases inherent in the study methods
      are discussed. We conclude that patients with relapsing MS have an increased risk
      of relapse during the initial 6-month postpartum period. This increased risk does
      not seem to have a detrimental effect on the rate of developing sustained
      disability. In fact, a full-term pregnancy may increase the time interval to
      reaching a common disability endpoint-walking with the aid of a cane or
      crutch--or to having a secondarily progressive course. Evidence indicates that
      pregnancy may alter T-lymphocyte functions and cause clinically relevant
      consequences. The specific biochemical mechanisms responsible for these
      observations, however, remain undefined. Because of limitations of current
      knowledge, our conclusions are tentative at best. The data are most applicable to
      patients with relapsing-remitting MS in its early stages. MS is an unpredictable 
      disease and is only one of many factors that patients must consider when a
      pregnancy is contemplated.

TI  - Diazepam usage in veterans with spinal cord injury.
PG  - 406-9
AB  - Diazepam is widely prescribed for persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) to treat 
      muscular spasticity. To assess the current usage of diazepam in those persons
      with SCI being followed by the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Centers
      (DVAMCs), a survey was mailed to all 23 DVAMCs that have specialized SCI
      Services. We discovered that no policy regarding the prescription of
      benzodiazepines existed at 65 percent of the SCI Services. At 70 percent of the
      SCI Services, diazepam or another benzodiazepine was routinely prescribed.
      One-third of patients were estimated to have taken diazepam for greater than 10
      years and an additional 37 percent for six to 10 years. Despite the potential for
      addiction, only 10 of the 23 SCI Services reported having a program to encourage 
      discontinuation of diazepam use; a 20 percent success rate was reported in
      withdrawing this medication. A need for greater understanding with regard to the 
      prescription of diazepam exists and strategies for its withdrawal should be
      considered. Appropriate guidelines for its use in patients with SCI and
      spasticity should be developed.

TI  - Epilepsy in patients with cerebral palsy.
PG  - 659-63
AB  - The incidence of epilepsy in 323 patients with cerebral palsy (CP) was 41.8%.
      Almost half of the patients with spastic tetraplegia and hemiplegia had epilepsy.
      The incidence was lower in patients with spastic diplegia. No sex differences
      were observed. Partial seizures were by far the most common form of epilepsy in
      spastic hemiplegia, while generalized tonic-clonic episodes predominated in all
      other forms of CP. A very high incidence of West syndrome was observed in
      patients with spastic tetraplegia. Most of the patients with spastic tetraplegia 
      had their first seizure in the first year of life. In patients with spastic
      hemiplegia the onset of epilepsy was often delayed for several years. A high rate
      of polytherapy was recorded, but two-thirds of the patients remained seizure-free
      for long periods. In just over one-fifth of the patients successful withdrawal of
      medication was achieved.

TI  - Buspirone vs amitriptyline in the treatment of chronic tension-type headache.
PG  - 247-51
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore the efficacy of buspirone (BSR),
      in comparison with amitriptyline (AML) in the prophylactic treatment of chronic
      tension-type headache (CTH), in an open and randomized clinical trial. MATERIAL
      AND METHODS: Twenty-six CTH patients (10 men and 16 women) were treated with BSR 
      (30 mg daily) for 12 weeks. A parallel group of 32 CTH patients (12 men and 20
      women) was treated with AML (50 mg daily). The major clinical parameters
      evaluated were the headache index (days with headache per month), the frequency
      of drug use for the acute management of headaches, the patients' opinion for the 
      treatment and the Hamilton anxiety and depression rating scales. RESULTS: During 
      the study 9 patients dropped out (4 from the BSR group and 5 from the AML group).
      Twelve (54.4%) patients from the BSR group responded to treatment (> 50%
      reduction in the headache index), compared to 17 (60.7%) from the AML group. In
      the BSR group, 14 (53.8%) patients reported various mild side effects (nausea
      most frequently), vs 21 (65.5%) of the AML group (mouth dryness more frequently).
      Patients treated with AML had better opinion and used less drugs for the acute
      treatment of headaches than the BSR treated patients. CONCLUSION: These results
      suggest that BSR may be effective in the prophylactic treatment of CTH, and that 
      further investigation in a placebo controlled study is needed.

TI  - Gabapentin for treatment of epilepsy in children.
PG  - 244-50
AB  - Gabapentin is a recently introduced antiepileptic drug for the treatment of
      partial seizures. Although studied extensively in adults, there have been few
      pediatric studies. It is a unique drug because it has no protein binding, is not 
      metabolized, and is excreted through the kidneys. There are no significant drug
      interactions with other antiepileptic drugs nor do other antiepileptic drugs
      alter the pharmacokinetics of gabapentin. The drug is effective in partial
      seizures, although most studies have used the drug as add-on therapy. It is
      approved for use of partial seizures with or without secondary generalization in 
      patients over the age of 12 years. The side effect profile of the drug is quite
      good. No significant idiosyncratic reactions have been reported. The most common 
      side effects have included dizziness, fatigue, and headache. Rarely, children
      will have adverse behavioral effects, such as hyperactivity and agitated
      behavior. Usually these children have pre-existing behavioral disturbances.
      Although the spectrum of efficacy of gabapentin remains to be determined, it is
      likely to have a major beneficial impact on the treatment of childhood epilepsy.

TI  - The impact of OBRA-87 on psychotropic drug prescribing in skilled nursing
      facilities.
PG  - 1289-96
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study examined the impact of regulations established by the
      Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA-87) on prescriptions for
      psychotropic drugs, and on research on their use in nursing homes. METHODS: Data 
      were collected on drugs prescribed for residents of 39 skilled nursing facilities
      over the four-year period from 1989 to 1992, bracketing the implementation of
      OBRA-87 in the fall of 1990. Changes in prescribing patterns were analyzed by
      drug class, specific target medications and doses, number of drugs prescribed,
      and multidrug combinations. To determine the effect of OBRA-87 on research,
      peer-reviewed journals were searched for the number and content of publications
      on psychotropic drug use in skilled nursing facilities between 1980 and 1996.
      RESULTS: The number of prescriptions for antipsychotics, sedative antihistamines,
      and sedative-hypnotics decreased significantly, while prescribing of anxiolytics 
      increased. Qualitative, but not quantitative, shifts occurred in prescriptions
      for antidepressant drugs, the most frequently used psychotropic medications in
      all years. Rates of psychotropic polypharmacy remained stable. The number of
      data-based publications on psychotropic drug use in nursing homes increased after
      implementation of OBRA-87, but few were related to the effectiveness of drug
      treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of OBRA-87's nursing home regulations was 
      associated with reductions in use of drugs specifically targeted by this
      legislation and was a potent stimulus to research, an unanticipated benefit of
      legislative action. Increased use of anxiolytics, persistent prescribing of
      anticholinergic antidepressants, enthusiastic adoption of new agents despite a
      limited research database involving frail patients, and the paucity of new
      studies reporting data on clinical effectiveness suggest a need for targeted
      research on treatment outcomes to improve the care of this population.

TI  - The atypical antipsychotic sertindole: a case series.
PG  - 410-6; quiz 417-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Psychotic disorders are often difficult to treat with traditional
      neuroleptics. Sertindole is a new atypical neuroleptic with a broader CNS
      receptor profile. METHOD: Ten patients diagnosed with either schizophrenia or
      schizoaffective disorder were treated with sertindole for 18 months and observed 
      for changes in Clinical Global Impression scale scores. RESULTS: Nine patients
      experienced a reduction of symptoms after 12 months of treatment. Eight patients 
      completed 18 months of treatment, all exhibiting overall improvement. Despite
      side effects of tiredness, weight gain, headache, nausea, and decreased
      ejaculatory volume, sertindole was generally well tolerated. CONCLUSION:
      Sertindole appears to be a useful treatment in psychotic disorders. It may
      present an advantage over traditional neuroleptics in the form of fewer
      extrapyramidal symptoms and improvement of negative symptoms.

TI  - The effect of gabapentin on neuropathic pain.
PG  - 251-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of gabapentin on pain scores and opiate use.
      DESIGN: Retrospective review of patients charts who received gabapentin for at
      least 30 days. Data were collected concerning patients' diagnosis, current drug
      use, concurrent drug use, gabapentin dose, pain scores, and patient-reported side
      effects. Patients were divided into three groups based on their pain diagnosis;
      low back, neuropathic, and myofascial pain. The neuropathic group was subdivided 
      into postherpetic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy, sympathetically maintained
      pain, and phantom pain. SETTING: Two tertiary referral teaching hospitals in
      southeastern Michigan. RESULTS: A total of 122 charts were reviewed and included 
      in this study. A significant decrease in pain scores with gabapentin was seen in 
      the neuropathic pain group (paired t-test, p < .0001) but not in the low back
      pain group. Of the neuropathic pain group, patients with postherpetic neuralgia
      had the greatest decrease in pain scores. Ten patients showed a > 75% decrease in
      pain scores, of these: nine had a direct nerve injury, and one had postherpetic
      neuralgia. Opiate use was unchanged in all groups. Patients who were taking
      opiates had significantly less benefit with gabapentin use in terms of pain
      score. Patient-reported side effects were similar to those reported in a
      nonchronic pain population. CONCLUSION: Gabapentin may be a useful adjunct for
      treating neuropathic pain with a minimum of side effects. Particular advantage
      may be gained with the use of this drug for postherpetic neuralgia and direct
      peripheral nerve injuries.

TI  - Motor neuron disease following generalized fasciculations and cramps.
PG  - 129-31
AB  - We report a case of motor neuron disease in which fasciculations and cramps
      progressed generally before the development of muscle wasting. After involvement 
      of the upper and lower motor neurons became clinically manifest, widespread
      fasciculations and cramps persisted and accompanied pseudotetany. The present
      case suggests that spinal cord pathology of motor neuron disease can cause the
      abnormal excitability of the motor neurons, resulting in the development of
      generalized fasciculations and cramps.

TI  - Prospective assessment of continuous intrathecal infusion of baclofen for
      spasticity caused by acquired brain injury: a preliminary report.
PG  - 415-9
AB  - Twelve consecutive patients with severe spasticity and hypertonia following
      acquired brain injury were treated with continuous intrathecal infusion of
      baclofen via an implanted, programmable infusion pump-catheter system for a
      minimum of 3 months. In every case intrathecal baclofen therapy resulted in a
      statistically significant reduction in upper- and lower-extremity tone, spasm
      frequency, and reflexes, contributing to improved functional abilities. There
      were no untoward side effects or complications associated with treatment. This
      preliminary assessment indicates that intrathecal administration of baclofen is
      effective in treating the disabling spasticity caused by acquired brain injury in
      selected patients.

TI  - Intrathecally administered baclofen for treatment of children with spasticity of 
      cerebral origin.
PG  - 409-14
AB  - Management of severe spasticity in children is often a difficult problem. Orally 
      administered medications generally offer limited benefits. This study examines
      the value of intrathecally administered baclofen in the treatment of 19 children 
      with severe spasticity of cerebral origin: eight of whom sustained brain injury
      associated with trauma, near drowning, or cardiac arrest; 10 with cerebral palsy 
      (spastic quadriplegia); and one child with Leigh's disease. At the time of entry 
      into the study, patients ranged from 4 to 19 years of age, and all were
      completely dependent on caretakers for activities of daily living. Children who
      responded positively to a trial dose of intrathecal baclofen underwent insertion 
      of a drug delivery system for continuous infusion. This was followed by a
      double-blind trial of baclofen or placebo and follow-up review at 3 and 6 months,
      and yearly thereafter. Seven children did not undergo pump implantation because
      of excess sedation or poor response. The 12 remaining children have been followed
      for a period of 1 to 5 years. Favorable responses were present in all 12 children
      as determined by the Ashworth Scale, with the greatest benefit being reduction of
      lower limb tone. Except in the case of one child who had reduction in lower limb 
      tone that resulted in difficulty with transfers, the caretakers all reported
      significant benefits from intrathecal baclofen, with improvement in muscle tone, 
      behavior, sitting, and general ease of care being most commonly noted. Central
      side effects were seen in some children who received continuous intrathecal
      baclofen infusion and included hypotension (two patients), bradycardia (two),
      apnea or respiratory depression (two), and sedation (one). During a total of 568 
      months of pump operation there were 10 mechanical complications, including two
      related to pump or side port failure and eight related to catheter kinks,
      extrusions, or dislodgment. Pump pocket effusion occurred in five children and a 
      cerebrospinal fluid fistula was seen in one child. Local infection occurred in
      three children and meningitis in two children. The results demonstrate the
      potential value of continuous intrathecal baclofen infusion for treatment of
      severe spasticity of cerebral origin. However, this treatment can result in
      significant complications and more experience is required before the long-term
      benefits can be determined.

TI  - Open label gabapentin treatment for pain in multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 250-3
AB  - Pain is a frequent and distressing complaint in patients with multiple sclerosis 
      (MS) and may present a difficult therapeutic problem. Conventional therapy is
      moderately effective and includes, among others, a variety of anticonvulsant
      medications. Gabapentin (Neurontin) is a new generation antiepileptic drug which 
      appears to be advantageous in treatment of intractable pain of reflex sympathetic
      dystrophy. This study investigates the benefits of open-label treatment with
      gabapentin for pain control in 25 patients with MS. Excellent to moderate pain
      relief was obtained in a substantial number of patients. Throbbing pains and
      needles, and cramping pains responded best, and dull aching pains responded least
      to the medication. There was no significant change in distribution and type of
      pain as a result of this treatment. Mild to moderate side effects were observed. 
      Cautious escalation of the dose of gabapentin is advisable in MS patients.
      Further clinical trials with larger patient groups are recommended.

TI  - Effect on ambulation of continuous intrathecal baclofen infusion.
PG  - 40-4
AB  - Intrathecal baclofen (ITB) infusion has been shown to be an effective treatment
      for spasticity secondary to both cerebral palsy and spinal cord injury. Its
      effect on the ambulatory status of individuals with cerebral spasticity, however,
      has not previously been addressed. We reviewed the effect of ITB on functional
      ambulation in 24 patients who were ambulatory to some extent, either with or
      without assistive devices. Twenty-one pumps were placed in patients with spastic 
      cerebral palsy and 3 in patients with spasticity secondary to traumatic brain
      injury (13 boys and 11 girls, mean age 18 years). The mean ITB dose was 200
      microg/day (range 22-550 microg/day) and the mean length of follow-up was 52
      months. Ambulation was retrospectively graded on four functional levels:
      community, household, non-functional, and non-ambulatory. The level of ambulation
      improved by one functional level in 9 patients, did not change for 12 patients,
      and was worse in 3 patients. Gait was considered to be improved in 20 of 24
      patients by the patients or their families. The overall functional improvement
      not directly related to ambulation was found to be improved in 20 patients,
      unchanged in 2 patients, and worse in 2 patients. ITB allows for improved
      ambulation in a certain subset of patients with lower extremity spasticity. It is
      not contraindicated in patients who rely upon their spasticity for support during
      ambulation. ITB infusion allows for baclofen dosage titration to balance between 
      extensor tone for support and suppression of hyperactive reflexes which may
      impede normal locomotion.

TI  - Hypothalamic-pituitary-insulin-like growth factor-I axis dysfunction in patients 
      with fibromyalgia.
PG  - 1384-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the serum levels of insulin-like growth factor-I
      (IGF-I) in patients with fibromyalgia (FM) compared to healthy controls and
      patients with other rheumatic diseases, and to explore possible etiologic
      mechanisms of low IGF-I levels in patients with FM. METHODS: Five hundred
      patients with FM and 152 controls (74 healthy blood donors, 26 myofascial pain
      patients and 52 patients with other rheumatic diseases) were studied. All had
      measurements of acid extracted serum IGF-I. A subset of 90 patients with FM were 
      evaluated for clinical features that might explain low IGF-I levels. Twenty-five 
      patients with FM underwent growth hormone (GH) provocation testing with l-dopa
      and clonidine. RESULTS: The mean serum IGF-I level in patients with FM was 138
      +/- 56 ng/ml and in controls 215 +/- 86 ng/ml (p = 0.00000000001). Low levels of 
      IGF-I were not due to depression, tricyclic medications, nonsteroidal
      antiinflammatory drugs, poor aerobic conditioning, obesity, or pain level.
      Patients with focal myofascial pain syndromes had normal IGF-I levels (236 +/-
      68), as did most patients with other rheumatic disorders, unless they had
      concomitant FM. Patients with FM with initially normal levels often had a rapid
      decline of IGF-I over 1 to 2 years. Most patients with FM with low IGF-I levels
      failed to secrete GH after stimulation with clonidine and l-dopa. CONCLUSION:
      Many, but not all, patients with FM have low levels of IGF-I that cannot be
      explained by clinical associations. These results suggest that low IGF-I levels
      in patients with FM are a secondary phenomenon due to hypothalamic-pituitary-GH
      axis dysfunction.

      following intrathecal administration of baclofen.
PG  - 751-64
AB  - This case report describes an 11-year-old boy with spastic diplegia whose reflex 
      status, range of motion (ROM), strength, and motor performance were measured
      before and after implantation of an indwelling system for delivery of
      intrathecally administered baclofen. Before baclofen use, the subject experienced
      clonus that interfered with walking, needed assistance with transfers, and was
      unable to independently put on underwear and socks. Measures of spasticity,
      kinematics and electromyographic activity during voluntary movements, ROM, Gross 
      Motor Function Measure (GMFM) scores, and self-reports of change were obtained at
      baseline, before and after bolus baclofen injection, during a double-blind
      placebo-controlled clinical trial of baclofen administration via an indwelling
      pump, and after 1 and 2 years of baclofen therapy. Spasticity, Babinski reflexes,
      clonus, strength, and coactivation of antagonist muscles during voluntary
      movement were decreased shortly after baclofen administration began. Hip and
      ankle ROM increased, upper-extremity movement speed increased, independence in
      dressing and transfers improved, and orthoses were discarded. After 1 and 2
      years, GMFM scores were 7.8% and 6.4% above baseline, respectively; the subject
      won a fitness award. After 2 years, ROM was worse than at baseline and concerns
      regarding hip subluxation arose. Single-joint movement control and independence
      improved and spasticity decreased during baclofen administration.

TI  - Inappropriate medication prescribing for the elderly by office-based physicians.
PG  - 823-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of inappropriate medications prescribed by 
      office-based physicians for patients 65 years or older. DESIGN: A nationwide
      cross-sectional survey of office visits by the elderly. SETTING: The National
      Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) 1992, a national probability sample survey
      of office visits by ambulatory patients within the continental US. SUBJECTS: A
      national probability sample of patients 65 years or older visiting office-based
      physicians. National estimates are based on the National Center for Health
      Statistics weighting procedure for the NAMCS sample. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
      Prevalence of 20 inappropriate medications that should be entirely avoided in the
      elderly, using criteria developed by a panel of national experts in geriatric
      medicine and geriatric pharmacology. RESULTS: In the US during 1992, an estimated
      8.47 million (95% CI 7.66 million to 9.28 million) office visits by the elderly
      indicated prescribing of at least 1 of the 20 inappropriate medications.
      Approximately 7.75 million (95% CI 6.98 million to 8.52 million) visits by the
      elderly involved 1 inappropriate medication and 0.72 million (95% CI 0.51 million
      to 0.93 million) visits included 2 inappropriate medications. According to the
      NAMCS, office-based physicians prescribed at least 1 inappropriate medication to 
      7.58% of the elderly who received prescriptions. The most frequently prescribed
      inappropriate medications were propoxyphene, amitriptyline, dipyridamole,
      diazepam, and chlorpropamide. Elderly patients rarely received prescriptions from
      office-based physicians for drugs such as secobarbital, isoxsuprine,
      trimethobenzamide, and carisoprodol. Furthermore, office-based physicians did not
      prescribe cyclandelate, pentobarbital, or phenylbutazone for the elderly.
      CONCLUSIONS: The prescribing of inappropriate medications by office-based
      physicians raises concerns regarding the quality of care for the elderly in
      ambulatory settings. The crux of improving patient care in ambulatory settings
      rests with collaborative efforts between physicians and pharmacists.

TI  - Psychomotor agitation following gabapentin use in brain injury.
PG  - 537-40
AB  - Gabapentin, an anticonvulsant structurally related to gamma-aminobutyric acid
      (GABA) was recently reported to be effective in pain associated with reflex
      sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) and in pain associated with neuropathy. Yet, to our
      knowledge, the use of gabapentin for neuropathic pain in the presence of
      cognitive impairment has not been reported. In this report, we describe two
      patients (one with a traumatic brain injury, one with a putative acquired brain
      injury) who presented to a neurorehabilitation unit complaining of pain that was 
      diagnosed as neurologically mediated. Within one week of receiving a daily 900 mg
      dose of gabapentin, both patients complained of heightened anxiety and
      restlessness. Correspondingly, each reported a diminution of psychological
      symptoms within 48 hours of gabapentin cessation. These two cases suggest that
      gabapentin may cause agitation in cognitive impaired patients. Physicians
      treating brain-injured patients and prescribing gabapentin for neuropathic pain
      may wish to closely monitor patients for similar signs of restlessness or
      anxiety.

TI  - Quinine-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome.
PG  - 397-400
AB  - Although quinine use is very common, hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) following
      exposure to quinine is only a recently reported phenomenon, with the first
      description published in 1991. Previous reports have concentrated on the nature
      of the hematological process and in particular characterization of the
      quinine-induced antibodies involved. We present a case of HUS with a clear
      temporal and immunological relationship to quinine which demonstrates the
      pathognomonic renal features of HUS. An indirect antiglobulin test with the
      patient's serum agglutinated red blood cells only in the presence of quinine.
      Renal biopsy features included glomerular and arteriolar endothelial swelling,
      capillary loop thrombi, mesangiolysis, segmental sclerosis and segmental
      ischemia. Early empiric treatment with plasma exchange and corticosteroids was
      instituted and this resulted in recovery of renal function to normal.

TI  - Alfentanil, but not amitriptyline, reduces pain, hyperalgesia, and allodynia from
      intradermal injection of capsaicin in humans.
PG  - 1279-87
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intradermal injection of capsaicin produces brief pain followed by
      hyperalgesia and allodynia in humans, and the latter effects are mediated by
      spinal N-methyl-D-aspartate mechanisms. Amitriptyline recently was shown to
      antagonize N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, and in this study, the authors sought 
      to determine the effect of amitriptyline alone and with the opioid alfentanil on 
      hyperalgesia and allodynia produced by intradermal injection of capsaicin.
      METHODS: Forty-six healthy volunteers in the general clinical research center
      received repeated intradermal injections of capsaicin (100 microg) alone or
      before and after systemic injection of 4 mg midazolam, 25 mg amitriptyline,
      alfentanil by computer-controlled infusion, or amitriptyline plus alfentanil.
      Acute pain and areas of mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia were determined at 
      specified intervals. Blood was obtained for alfentanil and amitriptyline assay.
      RESULTS: Capsaicin injection produced acute pain followed by hyperalgesia and
      allodynia. Alfentanil reduced these pain responses in a
      plasma-concentration-dependent manner, and reduction in hyperalgesia and
      allodynia correlated with reduction in acute pain. Amitriptyline alone had no
      effect and did not potentiate alfentanil. Alfentanil produced
      concentration-dependent nausea, an effect diminished by amitriptyline.
      DISCUSSION: These data correspond with previous studies in volunteers
      demonstrating reduction in hyperalgesia and allodynia after intradermal injection
      of capsaicin by systemically administered opioids, and they suggest that this
      reduction may be secondary to reduced nociceptive input by acute analgesia. These
      data do not support the use of acute systemic administration of amitriptyline for
      acute pain, hyperalgesia, and allodynia, although the roles of chronic treatment 
      and spinal administration are being investigated.

TI  - Atovaquone and proguanil for the treatment of malaria in Brazil.
PG  - 1544-7
AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare an experimental regimen of atovaquone
      plus proguanil with the standard regimen of quinine plus tetracycline for the
      treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria. The study was designed as an open,
      randomized study of men presenting with symptoms of uncomplicated malaria and
      thick-smear slide confirmation of parasitemia (1000-100,000 ring forms/microL).
      Subjects were hospitalized for 28 days to insure medication compliance and to
      rule out the possibility of reinfections. With 77 patients in each group, the
      cure rates were 98.7% and 100% for atovaquone plus proguanil and quinine plus
      tetracycline, respectively. The parasite clearance times (mean, 56 h) and fever
      clearance times (mean, 19 h) were significantly shorter in the atovaquone plus
      proguanil group, and there were significantly fewer side effects in the
      atovaquone plus proguanil group. Atovaquone plus proguanil is an efficacious,
      easily administered, safe regimen for the treatment of uncomplicated,
      multidrug-resistant falciparum malaria in Brazil.

TI  - Substance abuse, traumatic brain injury and neuropsychological outcome.
PG  - 391-402
AB  - The neuropsychological performance of 119 patients with severe closed traumatic
      brain injury (TBI) who had received toxicology screens at the time of trauma
      centre admission was examined. Three groups were created: normal screen, positive
      alcohol screen, or positive abused drugs screen (with or without the presence of 
      alcohol). The admitting Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was significantly lower in
      the positive alcohol screen group than the normal screen group, while the three
      groups did not differ in length of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) or years of
      education. Neuropsychological assessment was conducted during inpatient
      rehabilitation, following resolution of PTA. Normal screen patients obtained
      significantly better scores than the abused-drugs patients on the Full Scale IQ
      (FIQ) and Verbal IQ (VIQ) indices of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence
      Scale-Revised and the Verbal Memory, General Memory, Attention-Concentration, and
      Delayed Recall indices of the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised. Normal screen
      patients also scored significantly higher than positive alcohol screen patients
      on FIQ and VIQ indices and all five indices from the Wechsler Memory
      Scale-Revised. These data suggest the existence of an additive effect of
      substance abuse on neuropsychological outcome in TBI. Findings have potential
      implications for both acute management and rehabilitation of TBI.

      symptoms of tardive dyskinesia (TD) and parkinsonism of 8 elderly and 25 younger 
      chronic hospitalized mental patients were examined in a placebo-controlled,
      double-blind, counterbalanced two-period cross-over study with initial baselines 
      and intervening washout periods. All patients were maintained on their prestudy
      psychoactive and anti-Parkinson medications, without alteration, throughout the
      study. The elderly group received 1.5 g acetazolamide and thiamine per day in
      three divided doses for 3 weeks. The younger group received 1.5 g thiamine and
      2.0 g acetazolamide per day in divided doses for 2 months. Both groups showed a
      significant decrease in scores on the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (TD)
      and the Simpson-Angus Neurological Rating Scale (parkinsonism) while on A + T.
      The A + T effects were unrelated to age, gender, diagnosis, or maintenance
      medications.

TI  - Recent advances in the pharmacotherapy of epilepsy.
PG  - 369-82; discussion 367-8
AB  - The therapeutic options for the treatment of epilepsy have expanded during the
      1990s. Since 1993, four novel agents (felbamate, gabapentin, lamotrigine, and
      topiramate) have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, primarily 
      for adjunctive treatment of partial seizures. In addition, a water-soluble
      pro-drug of phenytoin, fosphenytoin, and a sustained-release preparation of
      carbamazepine have been introduced. The novel anticonvulsants represent a
      potential improvement for patients whose seizures are incompletely controlled or 
      who experience significant adverse effects with older anticonvulsants. Felbamate,
      lamotrigine, and topiramate appear to have a broad spectrum of action in seizure 
      control, but felbamate use is limited by the potential for serious adverse
      effects. Gabapentin, lamotrigine, and topiramate are all well tolerated.
      Gabapentin has no known drug interactions, whereas lamotrigine and topiramate
      have limited interactions compared with older agents. The sustained-release
      preparation of carbamazepine may decrease the incidence of adverse effects and
      increase patient compliance. Fosphenytoin offers a safer method for intravenous
      administration of phenytoin and the added flexibility of intramuscular
      administration. Taken together, these recent advances in treatment may bring
      about improved efficacy and decreased adverse effects for many patients with
      epilepsy.

TI  - Comparative study of bioavailability and clinical efficacy of carbamazepine in
      epileptic patients.
PG  - 548-52
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the bioavailability of three generic brands of
      carbamazepine tablets with that of a proprietary brand in adult patients with
      epilepsy. DESIGN: A double-blind, randomized, three-phase crossover study.
      SETTING: A psychiatric facility. PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen patients with epilepsy
      who had taken carbamazepine at least 5 months before entering the study. MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Ten blood specimens from each patient were collected at
      steady-state. Plasma concentration of carbamazepine was analyzed for
      pharmacokinetic parameters such as maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), mean time
      to reach maximum concentration (tmax), and mean AUC. RESULTS: There were no
      statistically significant differences in these parameters among four brands of
      carbamazepine. However, when comparing the 90% CI of AUC of three generic brands 
      with that of the proprietary brand, the AUC of two generic brands lay within a
      range of 80% to 120%. The effects of gender and each brand of carbamazepine on
      these pharmacokinetic parameters were also analyzed. Breakthrough seizures
      occurred even though the plasma concentration of carbamazepine was therapeutic.
      CONCLUSIONS: The bioavailability of two generic brands of carbamazepine tablets
      (Carmapine and Carzepine) and the proprietary brand (Tegretol) were equivalent in
      this sample of adult patients with epilepsy.

TI  - Transfusion-transmitted babesiosis in Washington State: first reported case
      caused by a WA1-type parasite.
PG  - 1259-62
AB  - Most cases of babesiosis reported in the United States have been tickborne and
      caused by Babesia microti, the etiologic agent of all previously described
      transfusion-transmitted cases. A 76-year-old man with the first recognized case
      of transfusion-transmitted infection with the recently identified WA1-type
      Babesia parasite is described. The subject received multiple blood transfusions
      in 1994. Indirect immunofluorescent antibody testing of serum from 57 blood
      donors implicated a 34-year-old man (WA1 titer, 1:65,536) whose donation had been
      used for packed red cells. Isolates of the organisms that infected the recipient 
      and the donor, both of whom were spleen-intact residents of Washington State,
      were obtained by hamster inoculation. The DNA sequence of a 536-bp region of the 
      nuclear small subunit-rRNA gene of both isolates was identical to that of WA1
      (isolated in 1991 from the index WA1 case-patient). Effective measures for
      preventing transmission of babesiosis by blood transfusion are needed.

      chronic pain.
PG  - 153-60
AB  - The novel anti-epileptic drugs lamotrigine, felbamate and gabapentin were
      compared in rat experimental models of acute (tail flick) and chronic pain: the
      chronic constriction injury and spinal nerve ligation models. Lamotrigine (10-100
      mg/kg, s.c.), felbamate (150-600 mg/kg, i.p.) and gabapentin (30-300 mg/kg, i.p.)
      each reversed cold allodynia (chronic constriction injury model) with ED50 values
      of 28, 241 and 103 mg/kg, respectively, 1 h post-dose. However, only gabapentin
      reversed tactile allodynia (spinal nerve ligation model) with an ED50 of 34 mg/kg
      (i.p.). The established anti-epileptic drugs, carbamazepine (1-30 mg/kg, i.p.)
      and phenytoin (1-100 mg/kg, s.c.), were ineffective in both models. The
      anti-allodynic effect of the newer anti-epileptic drugs was observed at doses
      that were either ineffective or produced only a negligible effect on acute
      nociceptive function and/or locomotor activity. In conclusion, the data suggest
      that the newer anti-epileptic drugs appear to have the potential to be effective 
      alternatives to either carbamazepine or phenytoin in the treatment of neuropathic
      pain. However, only gabapentin ameliorated both cold and touch hyperesthesias.

TI  - Symptomatic treatment of neurolathyrism with tolperisone HCL (Mydocalm): a
      randomized double blind and placebo controlled drug trial.
PG  - 77-91
AB  - The efficacy and safety of oral Tolperisone HCL was evaluated in double blind,
      placebo-controlled, randomized trial in 72 patients with neurolathyrism in stages
      I, II, and III of the disease at Kolla Duba Health Centre of Dembia District of
      North Gondar between January and April 1995. Taken orally daily for 12 weeks,
      tolperisone HCL (Mydocalm) in a dose of 150 milligrams (mgs) twice daily
      significantly improved subjective complaints such as muscle cramps, heaviness of 
      the legs, startle attacks, flexor spasms and repeated falls. An overall
      subjective improvement was observed in 75% of the patients on tolperisone HCL and
      39% of the placebo group (P = 0.002). When objectively assessed spastic muscle
      tone in the abductors, stiffness of Achilles and spontaneous ankle clonus were
      significantly reduced in tolperisone HCL group (P values = 0.001, 0.04, and
      0.0001, respectively). Walking ability and speed of walking was also
      significantly improved. The drug is most effective in relieving symptoms of stage
      I and stage II disease. Some adverse effects like muscle pain, generalized body
      weakness and dizziness were recorded in patients taking the drug but all were
      minor and self limited, none requiring discontinuation of treatment. It is
      concluded that tolperisone is a well tolerated and efficacious drug for
      symptomatic treatment of neurolathyrism.

TI  - Spinal anesthesia with clonidine and bupivacaine in young humans: interactions
      and effects on the cardiovascular system.
PG  - 119-25
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clonidine, an alpha 2 agonist, is known to prolong the action of
      local anesthetics, and to provide a satisfactory analgesia; hypotension and
      bradycardia have been observed after its intrathecal administration. The aim of
      our study was to determine whether intrathecal administration of clonidine can
      reduce the dose of local anesthetic, and the effects of clonidine on the
      cardiovascular system, and on arousal level. METHODS: In a prospective,
      randomized study we evaluated 56 patients scheduled for minor surgical procedure 
      (spermatic vein ligature) under unilateral spinal anesthesia with hyperbaric
      bupivacaine 1%. One half of patients received clonidine (105 micrograms) in
      addition to bupivacaine. Mean arterial pressure, heart rate were recorded
      baseline until 1 hour after surgery. Cardiac output, stroke volume, ejection
      fraction, systemic vascular resistance and left cardiac work were measured, by
      thoracic electric bioimpedance method, baseline until 1 hour after surgery.
      Sensory block, motor block and sedation level were measured at the beginning of
      anesthesia and for 6 hours after the end of surgery. RESULTS: In the clonidine
      treated group we did not observe variations of cardiovascular parameters; in the 
      same group we did observe sensory block and motor block significantly prolonged, 
      a higher sedation level and a significant postoperative analgesia. CONCLUSIONS:
      In summary, the addition of clonidine to hyperbaric bupivacaine seems to be
      particularly useful in unilateral spinal anesthesia, exerting minimal influence
      on haemodynamic parameters, and guaranting a satisfactory postoperative
      analgesia.

TI  - Medical and pharmacologic management of upper extremity neuropathic pain
      syndromes.
PG  - 96-109
AB  - Written from a neurologic and therapeutically conservative perspective, this
      review advocates fundamentally medical and pharmacologic management of upper
      extremity neuropathic pain syndromes, including chronic regional pain syndromes, 
      formerly classified reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) and causalgia. Mandatory
      steps include, first, a prompt serious attempt to localize the nerve lesion
      whenever possible using complete, sophisticated neurologic examinations, then
      thoughtfully selected conventional neurophysiologic and radiologic tests.
      Strongly discouraged are promiscuous use of "RSD" to describe all neuropathic
      pains, and diagnostic reliance upon thermography and uncontrolled sympathetic
      blocks. Conservative multidisciplinary diagnostic and treatment teams should
      often possess a nucleus of neurologist and hand therapist, plus additional
      consultants including psychiatric. Every physician and therapist managing
      neuropathic pain must consider psychologic and wellness issues within their
      responsibilities. Prompt referral to an experienced surgeon is crucial for
      decompression or repair of relevant, significant, objectively proven (ideally
      neurophysiologically) nerve and root lesions. Ambiguous professional
      colloquialisms, "central pain" and "central sensitization," unfortunately provide
      value-laden pretexts for premature invasive treatments, and animate the truly
      dreadful concept "central RSD". Various classes of conventional oral non-narcotic
      adjuvant analgesics are reviewed, and the inevitability of their empiric,
      non-formulaic administration. No patient-specific, rationally-identifiable
      molecular receptor/switch can be deduced clinically or tripped mechanistically to
      terminate chronic pain. Two promising new non-narcotic centrally-active
      medications, gabapentin and tramadol, are highlighted as harbingers of future
      progress. The neglected subtle art of prescription writing is stressed,
      particularly for medication-sensitive patients. Medical cost containment should
      promote critical, long overdue outcomes studies comparing conservative and
      invasive pain treatments.

TI  - Combining single patient (N-of-1) trials to estimate population treatment effects
      and to evaluate individual patient responses to treatment.
PG  - 401-10
AB  - When treating individual patients, physicians may face difficulties using the
      evidence from center-based randomized control trials (RCTs) due to limitations in
      these studies generalizability. Therefore, they often perform their own
      "informal" tests of treatment effectiveness. Single patient ("N-of-1") trials
      provide a structured design for more rigorous assessment of medical treatments of
      chronic diseases, but are applied only to the index patient. We present a
      hierarchical Bayesian random effects model to combine N-of-1 studies to obtain an
      estimate of treatment effectiveness for the population and to use this population
      information to aid in the evaluation of an individual patient's trial results.
      The model's treatment effect estimates are adjustments between the population
      estimate and the individual's observed results. This adjustment is based upon the
      within-patient and between-patient heterogeneity. We demonstrate this
      patient-focused method using published data from 23 N-of-1 trial results
      comparing amitriptyline and placebo for the treatment of fibromyalgia.

TI  - Clinical effects of buspirone in social phobia: a double-blind placebo-controlled
      study.
PG  - 164-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The results of open pilot studies suggest that the serotonin-1A
      (5-HT1A) receptor agonist buspirone might be effective in social phobia. METHOD: 
      In the present study, the efficacy of buspirone was investigated in patients with
      social phobia using a 12-week double-blind placebo-controlled design. Thirty
      social phobic patients (DSM-IV) were treated with either buspirone 30 mg daily or
      placebo. Efficacy of treatment was measured using the Social Phobia Scale
      (subscores anxiety and avoidance) and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety.
      RESULTS: Taking a reduction of 50% or more on the Social Phobia Scale as a
      criterion for clinically relevant improvement, only 1 patient on buspirone and 1 
      on placebo were classified as responder to treatment. A subjective and clinically
      relevant improvement was reported by 4 patients (27%) on buspirone and 2 patients
      (13%) on placebo. There were no statistically significant differences between
      buspirone and placebo on any of the outcome measures. Generally speaking,
      buspirone was well tolerated. CONCLUSION: The results of the study do not support
      the results of open studies, in which a reduction of social anxiety and social
      avoidance was reported in patients with social phobia treated with buspirone.

TI  - Migraine prophylactic drugs: proof of efficacy, utilization and cost.
PG  - 73-80
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In order to understand the pattern of utilization of migraine
      prophylactic drugs by US physicians, we reviewed the scientific rigor of
      published trials of anti-migraine medications, assessed their cost, and tested
      the correlation, if any, between utilization, scientific rigor and cost.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Scientific rigor of published reports. We identified all
      placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind trials of migraine prophylactic
      agents through Medline search, major Headache textbooks and proceedings of major 
      scientific meetings where headache-related topics are discussed. We excluded
      trials that did not include placebo treatment during the active phase of the
      study. The trials were reviewed and rated for scientific rigor using a 5-point
      scale (scientific score [ss]; 1 = low, 5 = good), blinded to the physicians'
      utilization data and cost of the drugs. Studies that did not show benefit of the 
      active drug over placebo were scored -1 to -5, thus allowing for the reverse
      logic of negative studies. US physicians utilization. Neurologists and primary
      care physicians (PCP) completed phone-mail-phone questionnaires which inquired
      about first and second choices of migraine prophylaxis. These choices were
      averaged to obtain a weighted average percent usage of each drug. Cost. The
      average wholesale price (AWP) of each drug was obtained from data published by
      Adelman and Von Seggern, and from the Amerisource (7/9/96) catalog. STATISTICAL
      ANALYSIS: Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to assess the relationship 
      between the average ss, physician use, and cost of each drug. RESULTS:
      Propranolol (ss = 1.44), amitriptyline (ss = 2.33) and verapamil (ss = 1.00) were
      the three preferred migraine prophylactic drugs by both neurologists and PCPs.
      Approximately 10% of neurologists said that divalproex (ss = 3.75) would be their
      first or second choice. The selective serotonin reuptake blockers were favored by
      13.21% of PCPs. All other prophylactic drugs were felt to be first or second line
      of treatment by less than 10% of either neurologists or PCPs. Except for one
      study (ss = 1) that showed that propranolol reduced the migraine frequency by 76%
      over placebo, trials of the three most preferred medications failed to
      demonstrate that the active drug is > 50% better than placebo, i.e. the
      difference in headache frequency when on placebo vs active drug is > 50%. Of the 
      drugs available in the United States, flurbiprofen and metoprolol achieved the
      best ss (5.00 and 4.33, respectively) but their efficacy over placebo (23% and
      14-33%, respectively) and cost ($67.2 and $65.6) were unfavorable. Neurologists
      and PCPs chose migraine prophylaxis on the basis of scientific merit (r = 0.644, 
      p = 0.018; r = 0.576, p = 0.05, respectively) but not cost (r = -0.254, p = 0.45;
      r = -0.255, p = 0.455). CONCLUSION: The three most commonly chosen migraine
      prophylactic agents have not been shown irrefutably to prevent migraine.
      Furthermore, their benefit, if any, does not exceed 50% over placebo. The
      well-conducted recent trials that demonstrated the efficacy of divalproex in
      migraine prevention are steps in the right direction of finding the "ideal
      migraine preventative agent". Until that drug is discovered, it is difficult to
      argue that one migraine prophylactic medication is superior to another and
      accordingly should be used as a first line of treatment.

TI  - Clinical epidemiology of nocturnal leg cramps in male veterans.
PG  - 210-4
AB  - This article describes patients with nocturnal leg cramps concerning their age,
      medical problems, and medications, and reviews any medical evaluation performed
      for the complaint of nocturnal leg cramps. Provided is a retrospective chart
      review of 50 patients who took quinine sulfate for nocturnal leg cramps. These
      patients were identified through computerized pharmacy records. A control group
      was chosen from age-matched patients who took medications other than quinine
      during the study period. In a university-affiliated Veterans Administration
      hospital, patients with nocturnal leg cramps had a significantly higher median
      number of medical problems than controls. Cardiovascular diseases and
      neurological diseases were significantly more common in patients with nocturnal
      leg cramps (cases) than in those without (controls) (82% versus 64% and 36%
      versus 18%, respectively). The most striking differences between patients with
      cramps and controls were peripheral vascular disease (34% versus 12%, P = 0.09)
      and peripheral neurological deficit (12% versus 0%, P = 0.012). Patients with
      nocturnal leg cramps were prescribed significantly more medications than were
      controls, but no specific medication or type of medication was prescribed more
      frequently to patients with cramps (other than quinine). Results suggested that
      men with nocturnal leg cramps have greater medical comorbidity and are prescribed
      more medications than age-matched control patients. Unlike in previous studies,
      no evidence was found that specific medications, such as diuretics, betaagonists,
      or calcium-channel antagonists are associated with nighttime cramps. The
      significantly increased frequency of peripheral vascular disease and peripheral
      neurologic deficits in patients with nocturnal leg cramps raised the possibility 
      that these problems contribute to the occurrence of cramps. Although the size of 
      the study and its methodologic limitations preclude definitive conclusions, areas
      for research to clarify the clinical epidemiology of nocturnal leg cramps are
      suggested.

TI  - A review of intrathecal baclofen in the management of spasticity.
PG  - 253-60, 262
AB  - Spasticity is associated with damage to the corticospinal tract and is a common
      complication of neurological disease. Patients with spasticity complain of
      stiffness, involuntary spasm and pain. The majority of patients are managed
      conservatively with physiotherapy and/or oral medication. However, 25-35% of
      patients will develop unacceptable side-effects or fail to respond to oral doses 
      of antispasmodics. Surgical procedures such as myelotomy, rhizotomy and neurotomy
      have not been universally successful. More recently, intrathecal baclofen has
      become established as an important adjunct in the management of spasticity. This 
      article describes the mechanism of action of baclofen, the delivery systems
      available and the criteria for patient selection. The screening phase, surgical
      procedure and specific postoperative observations are also described.

TI  - Hiccups associated with lateral medullary syndrome. A case report.
PG  - 144-6
AB  - We present a case of persistent hiccups (singultus) after a lateral medullary
      cerebrovascular accident. The patient presented with a two-day history of nausea 
      and vomiting. Clinically, the patient had a loss of pain and temperature on the
      left side of the face, a loss of pain and temperature on the right side of the
      trunk, a mild left hemiparesis, and a left-sided ataxia. Nystagmus, diplopia, and
      hiccups were also evident. A left lateral medullary syndrome in the vascular
      distribution of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery was diagnosed. Work-up
      included a magnetic resonance imaging angiogram, which revealed an occlusion v
      high-grade stenosis of the basilar artery. The patient reported that the most
      distressing symptom was the chronic hiccups (25/min), which interfered with
      nutrition, sleep, and activity. While in the acute care hospital, the patient was
      treated with prochlorperazine, promethazine, and chlorpromazine. Each of these
      medications was unsuccessful in stopping the hiccups. After a search of the
      European literature revealed that baclofen was recommended as the drug of choice 
      for stopping persistent hiccups, the patient was given 5 mg of baclofen by mouth 
      three times per day, and the hiccups abated within 48 hours. The baclofen was
      discontinued after one week of therapy, and the hiccups did not return. We
      recommend consideration of baclofen for the treatment of persistent hiccups after
      lateral medullary syndrome because of its desirable side effects and reported
      success rate compared with other drugs used to treat chronic hiccups.

TI  - Management of sickle pain.
PG  - 104-11
AB  - Sickle cell disease is characterized by recurrent episodes of acute pain. Some
      patients also suffer from chronic pain syndromes including avascular necrosis,
      leg ulcers, and intractable pain. Approaches to rational therapy of sickle pain
      include pharmacologic, nonpharmacologic, and preventive therapeutic
      interventions. Pharmacologic treatment of sickle pain entails the use of
      nonopioid analgesics, opioid analgesics, and adjuvants singly or in combination
      depending on the severity of pain. Meticulous evaluation and assessment of
      painful episodes should precede and accompany all approaches to management. The
      choice of the opioid analgesic, its route of administration, dose, and frequency 
      of administration should be individualized on a case-by-case basis. Meperidine
      should be avoided whenever possible. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
      meperidine, and morphine are contraindicated in the presence of renal failure.
      Administration of opioids on a fixed schedule or by patient-controlled analgesia 
      is ideal for effective therapy. Nonpharmacologic approaches to manage sickle pain
      are underutilized and more studies are needed to determine their role in sickle
      pain. Preventive therapy of sickle pain is best achieved with hydroxyurea, which 
      was found to decrease the frequency of crises significantly, decrease the
      incidence of acute chest syndrome, and decrease the need for blood transfusion.

TI  - The efficacy of antidepressants in post-stroke depression.
PG  - 25-6
AB  - The aim of the present study was to confirm the efficacy of antidepressants in
      post-stroke depression and to identify the factors related to outcome. Subjects
      consisted of 20 inpatients suffering from post-stroke in a rehabilitation
      hospital. The subjects were treated with various antidepressants, mainly
      imipramine, amitriptyline, and amoxapine. After 4 weeks of treatment, 13 showed
      some improvement; significant improvement in 5, moderate improvement in 5, mild
      improvement in 3 by a clinical global impression. Whereas all the patients aged
      less than 65 yr were responders, only 3 of the 10 patients over 65 yr were
      responders. All of the male patients, but only half of the female patients, were 
      responders. With regards to the presence of a spouse, 13 of the 16 patients with 
      a spouse, but none of 4 patients without, showed a response. No significant
      correlation was found between the occurrence of each depressive symptom and
      outcome. Thus, the responders were younger and had better social support in
      comparison with the non-responders. This result implies that antidepressants are 
      effective for post-stroke depression.

TI  - Antiemetic efficacy of granisetron in patients with gynecological malignancies.
PG  - 225-30
AB  - The efficacy and tolerability of granisetron in the management of acute and
      delayed emesis was compared with that of a multiple antiemetic drug combination
      regimen, including metoclopramide, dexamethasone, lorazepam and orphenadrine. The
      trial was a randomized, cross-over study involving 111 patients with
      gynecological cancers undergoing chemotherapy with cisplatin. Granisetron was
      significantly more effective than the combination regimen during the first 24 h
      after chemotherapy; complete response, rates were 67 and 48%, respectively (p =
      0.002). There was a significant reduction in the effectiveness of the combination
      during the second treatment cycle, compared with the first. In contrast, the
      efficacy of granisetron did not differ between the two cycles. The response rate 
      during the 6 days after chemotherapy was 40.8% in both groups. At the end of the 
      study, 55% of patients preferred granisetron and 23% preferred the combination (p
      < 0.001). Granisetron was well tolerated. The principal adverse event was
      headache, which was reported in 7% of patients. The results of this study confirm
      that granisetron is effective in the treatment of cisplatin-induced nausea and
      vomiting during the 24 h after chemotherapy.

TI  - The effects of therapy on spasticity utilizing a motorized exercise-cycle.
PG  - 176-8
AB  - F-wave amplitudes have been used to demonstrate changes of motor neuron
      excitability in patients receiving pharmacological antispastic therapy as well as
      in those having physiotherapy. In this study it is shown that F-wave amplitudes
      can also be used to document changes of motor neuron excitability as an effect of
      the therapy with a motorized exercise-cycle, which moves the legs of paraplegic
      patients in a way similar to cycling. Ten F-waves were recorded immediately
      before and after the therapy with a motorized exercise-cycle in 70 legs of 35
      patients with spastic paraparesis. Mean F-wave amplitude, mean F-wave/M-response 
      ratio and maximum F-wave/M-response ratio were significantly lower after therapy 
      than before. Conclusion: The antispastic effect of the therapy with a motorized
      exercise-cycle may be documented by a decrease of F-wave-amplitude parameters.

TI  - Tizanidine. A review of its pharmacology, clinical efficacy and tolerability in
      the management of spasticity associated with cerebral and spinal disorders.
PG  - 435-52
AB  - The central alpha 2 adrenoceptor agonist tizanidine is a myotonolytic agent used 
      in the treatment of spasticity in patients with cerebral or spinal injury. Wide
      interpatient variability in the effective plasma concentrations of tizanidine
      means that the optimal dosage must be titrated over 2 to 4 weeks for each patient
      (dosages of 2 to 36 mg/day have been used in clinical trials). Maximum effects
      occur within 2 hours of administration. Antispastic efficacy has been
      demonstrated for tizanidine in placebo-controlled trials, with reduction in mean 
      muscle tone scores of 21 to 37% versus 4 to 9% for patients receiving placebo.
      Improvement in muscle tone occurred in 60 to 82% of tizanidine recipients,
      compared with 60 to 65% of baclofen and 60 to 83% of diazepam recipients. Spasm
      frequency and clonus are also reduced by tizanidine. The most common adverse
      effects associated with tizanidine are dry mouth and somnolence/drowsiness.
      Muscle strength, as assessed by objective means, appears not to be adversely
      affected by tizanidine and subjective muscle weakness is reported less often by
      tizanidine recipients than by those receiving baclofen or diazepam. Global
      tolerability was assessed as good to excellent in 44 to 100% of patients
      receiving tizanidine, compared with 38 to 90% of baclofen and 20 to 54% of
      diazepam recipients. In conclusion, tizanidine is an antispastic agent with
      similar efficacy to that of baclofen and a more favourable tolerability profile. 
      While drowsiness is a frequently reported adverse effect with both agents,
      subjective muscle weakness appears to be less of a problem with tizanidine than
      with baclofen. Tizanidine, therefore, appears to be an attractive therapeutic
      alternative for patients with spasticity associated with cerebral or spinal
      damage.

TI  - Causes and outcome of mechanical ventilation in patients with hemispheric
      ischemic stroke.
PG  - 210-3
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To attempt to determine factors that influence outcome in mechanically
      ventilated patients with ischemic hemispheric stroke. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We
      reviewed data on 24 mechanically ventilated patients with an ischemic stroke in
      the territory of the middle cerebral artery, who had been admitted to a medical, 
      neurologic, or neurosurgical intensive-care unit during the period between 1976
      and 1994. RESULTS: The circumstances surrounding mechanical ventilation were
      generalized tonic-clonic seizures or status epilepticus (N = 6), progression to
      stupor and inability to protect the airway from brain swelling (N = 8), or--most 
      commonly--bilateral pulmonary edema from congestive heart failure (N = 10). Of
      the 24 patients, 17 patients died (12 of neurologic causes and 5 of cardiac
      arrest or cardiac arrhythmias). Of the seven surviving patients, however, four
      with seizures and one with pulmonary edema were functionally independent.
      CONCLUSION: Three clinical scenarios generally underlie mechanical ventilation in
      patients with ischemic hemispheric stroke (generalized tonic-clonic seizures,
      brain swelling, and bilateral pulmonary edema). The outcome in patients with an
      ischemic hemispheric stroke and a subsequent need for mechanical ventilation is
      poor; however, survival and independent function are possible if seizures or
      pulmonary edema prompt ventilatory support.

TI  - Comparison of tropisetron, droperidol, and saline in the prevention of
      postoperative nausea and vomiting after gynecologic surgery.
PG  - 662-7
AB  - This study was performed to compare the efficacy of tropisetron, droperidol, and 
      saline in the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and to
      compare the possible adverse effects of these drugs in gynecologic incontinence
      surgery. Using a randomized, double-blind study design, we studied 150 women
      undergoing gynecologic incontinence surgery with standardized general anesthesia.
      At the end of surgery, the patients received either tropisetron 5 mg, droperidol 
      1.25 mg, or 0.9% saline intravenously (i.v.). As a rescue antiemetic, the
      patients received metoclopramide 10 mg i.v.. The episodes of nausea, retching,
      and vomiting; the need for rescue treatment; and the type and severity of adverse
      events were recorded at four occasions during the 48-h observation period. Pain, 
      anxiety, drowsiness, and general satisfaction were also evaluated on a linear
      numerical scale of 0-10. Complete response (no PONV within the 48-h observation
      period) occurred similarly in the study groups (tropisetron 25%, droperidol 22%, 
      and placebo 18%). Tropisetron and droperidol had no effect on the incidence of
      nausea and retching. However, the incidence of vomiting was significantly less in
      the tropisetron group than in the placebo group (tropisetron 19%, droperidol 45%,
      and placebo 57%). The number of emetic episodes (retching and/or vomiting) per
      patient within 48 h was significantly decreased under tropisetron when compared
      with placebo (tropisetron 2.5 +/- 3.4, droperidol 4.2 +/- 6.1, placebo 5.9 +/-
      7.1). With regard to adverse events, the patients in the droperidol group had
      significantly more anxiety than the placebo group (2-6 h postoperatively), more
      drowsiness than the tropisetron and placebo groups (0-2 h postoperatively), and
      more dissatisfaction than the tropisetron (0-6 h postoperatively) and placebo
      groups (2-6 h postoperatively). We conclude that tropisetron given 5 mg i.v.
      during anesthesia in gynecologic incontinence surgery effectively prevents
      vomiting but not nausea and retching, while 1.25 mg i.v. droperidol fails to
      prevent any of these emetic symptoms and results in adverse events.

TI  - Continuous intrathecal baclofen infusion in severe spasticity after traumatic or 
      hypoxic brain injury.
PG  - 160-6
AB  - Severe spinal spasticity has been shown to be a good indication for continuous
      intrathecal baclofen infusion (CIBI), but there is only limited experience with
      this treatment in patients with supraspinal spasticity. Eighteen patients with
      severe spasticity from traumatic or hypoxic brain injury were treated with CIBI. 
      In all patients spasticity could be reduced significantly. The mean Ashworth
      score was reduced from 4.5 to 2.33 and the mean Spasm frequency score from 2.16
      to 0.94. This reduction of spasticity led to a marked pain reduction. Nursing,
      perineal care and mobilization became much easier. The complication rate was low.
      In this series we saw one infection in the pump pocket, one epileptic seizure
      after a bolus application of baclofen and one spinal catheter displacement. The
      results are similar to those reported from series of patients with spinal
      spasticity and correspond to the limited experience we have so far with
      supraspinal spasticity patients. To prevent limb contractures CIBI should be
      performed as soon as the patient is in a stable clinical condition after brain
      injury. Further prospective clinical trials will be necessary to obtain more
      experience with patients suffering from supraspinal spasticity.

PG  - 399-408
AB  - Myasthenia gravis is a disease of the neuromuscular junction in which normal
      transmission of the neuron-to-muscle impulse is impaired or prevented by
      acetylcholine receptor antibodies. Several classes of drugs have been associated 
      with clinical worsening of existing myasthenia gravis, and a small subset of
      drugs, most notably the antirheumatic agent penicillamine, have been implicated
      in the pathogenesis of a variant of the disease. Recent case reports and other
      documented evidence link a number of specific agents with clinical worsening of
      myasthenia gravis.

PG  - 69-73
AB  - Most leg cramps are benign and self-limited. Idiopathic nocturnal leg cramp is
      the most common from of cramps. Occasionally, leg cramps may signify a
      significant systemic disorder. Investigations are usually not necessary unless
      indicated by the history or physical examination. Symptomatic treatment consists 
      of stretching the affected calf muscle by forcible dorsiflexion of the foot.

TI  - Influence of common drugs and related factors on stroke outcome.
PG  - 52-7
AB  - Laboratory studies show that recovery after brain injury can be influenced by
      drugs that affect certain central neurotransmitters. The effects of these drugs
      may be either beneficial or harmful. Although issues related to drug dose, the
      timing of interventions relative to the deficit, and the nature of concomitant
      experience or training may be critical, preliminary clinical studies suggest that
      similar drug effects may occur in humans recovering from stroke. Recognition of
      these data is important because many of the drugs that may impair recovery are
      commonly prescribed to stroke patients for the treatment of coincident medical
      conditions and should be avoided if possible. Pharmacotherapy to enhance recovery
      may be possible in the future.

      benefits of anticonvulsant prophylaxis.
PG  - 59-62
AB  - If the primary goal in the treatment of traumatic brain injury is the
      minimization of post-injury morbidity, treatment strategies that effectively
      prevent the development of post-traumatic epilepsy and have a beneficial (or at
      least neutral) impact on functional recovery are necessary. Here, Theresa
      Hernandez discusses the degree to which the current post-injury practice of
      anticonvulsant prophylaxis satisfies each of these criteria.

TI  - Cerebral palsy.
PG  - 81-8
AB  - Cerebral palsy is caused by a static lesion to the cerebral motor cortex that is 
      acquired before, at, or within 5 years of birth. Multiple causes for the
      condition exist and include cerebral anoxia, cerebral hemorrhage, infection, and 
      genetic syndromes. Cerebral palsy is commonly classified according to the type of
      movement problem that is present (spastic or athetoid) or according to the body
      parts involved (hemiplegia, diplegia, or quadriplegia). To care for children with
      cerebral palsy, a team approach is most effective; the team should include the
      pediatrician and orthopedist, among others. In the nonambulatory patient, good
      sitting posture, the prevention of hip dislocation (spastic hip disease), and the
      maintenance of proper custodial care are prime concerns. Careful monitoring and
      treatment of spastic hip disease and the correction of scoliotic spinal deformity
      are also important. In the ambulatory patient, the main goal is to maximize
      function. Computerized gait analysis in patients with complex gait patterns helps
      to show whether orthotic or surgical treatment is indicated. In this paper, we
      also review both the proper indications for orthopedic intervention in patients
      with upper extremity involvement and recent methods to control spasticity, such
      as selective dorsal rhizotomy and administration of botulinum toxin or
      intrathecal baclofen.

TI  - A risk-benefit assessment of buspirone in the treatment of anxiety disorders.
PG  - 118-32
AB  - Anxiety disorders include generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder,
      obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and social phobia. Consideration of the
      chronicity of these disorders reveals that anxiety disorders first occur during
      early adolescence or young adulthood, and can wax and wane over periods of 5 to
      10 years. Thus, in considering treatment, the emphasis must be placed on long
      term, rather than short term, management. Comorbidity studies reveal that
      untreated patients with anxiety disorders are at risk of social and psychological
      consequences, as well as disability resulting from comorbid and secondary
      disorders. Comparisons between buspirone and the benzodiazepines in treating
      patients with generalised anxiety disorder reveal that long term use of
      benzodiazepines is associated with adverse effects, particularly in elderly
      patients. Buspirone appears to have an onset of action equivalent to that of the 
      benzodiazepines, to be well tolerated in the long term, to lack problems of
      habituation and withdrawal, and to be useful in patients with masked comorbid
      depression. In patients with panic disorder and social phobia, buspirone has not 
      been clearly shown to be effective in comparison with the reference standards; in
      those patients with OCD, there are only preliminary indications of efficacy,
      which merit a more adjunctive role.

AB  - Treatment of epilepsy extends far beyond the administration and monitoring of
      antiepileptic drug therapy. Persons with epilepsy have cognitive, vocational, and
      psychosocial needs that may exceed the scope of the primary care physician's
      clinical responsibilities. In such cases, the physician can assemble and manage a
      team of medical and social service professionals to address these needs. By
      establishing this support system and maintaining effective communication with the
      patient and the management team, the primary care physician offers patients with 
      epilepsy the opportunity to improve and maintain their quality of life and
      receive safe and effective pharmacologic treatment.

TI  - Possible serotonin syndrome associated with tramadol and sertraline
      coadministration.
PG  - 175-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report a possible case of serotonin syndrome associated with
      coadministration of tramadol hydrochloride and sertraline hydrochloride. CASE
      SUMMARY: A 42-year-old woman developed atypical chest pain, sinus tachycardia,
      confusion, psychosis, sundowning, agitation, diaphoresis, and tremor. She was
      taking multiple medications, including tramadol and sertraline. The tramadol
      dosage had recently been increased, resulting in what was believed to be
      serotonergic syndrome. DISCUSSION: Serotonin syndrome is a toxic
      hyperserotonergic state that develops soon after initiation or dosage increments 
      of the offending agent. Patients may differ in their susceptibility to the
      development of serotonin syndrome. The (+) enantiomer of tramadol inhibits
      serotonin uptake. Tramadol is metabolized to an active metabolite, M1, by the
      CYP2D6 enzyme. If this metabolite has less serotonergic activity than tramadol,
      inhibition of CYP2D6 by sertraline could have been a factor in the interaction.
      CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware of the potential for serotonin syndrome
      with concomitant administration of sertraline and tramadol.

TI  - Botulinum toxin treatment of muscle cramps: a clinical and neurophysiological
      study.
PG  - 181-6
AB  - Botulinum toxin is now widely used in the treatment of several hyperkinetic
      movement disorders. To evaluate its efficacy in treating muscle cramping
      syndromes, we studied clinical and neurophysiological variables before and after 
      botulinum toxin injections into calf muscles and small flexor muscles of the foot
      in patients with an inherited benign cramp-fasciculation syndrome. At each
      assessment the clinical severity of cramp was scored and the cramp threshold
      frequency was measured with repetitive electrical peripheral nerve stimulation.
      Botulinum toxin injection significantly lowered our patients' clinical cramp
      severity scores (mean +/- SD: before, 3.80 +/- 0.44; after, 1.40 +/- 0.54), left 
      muscle strength unchanged and significantly increased their cramp threshold
      frequencies (before, 4.22 +/- 2.26 Hz; after, 10.0 +/- 3.74 Hz). The clinical
      benefit induced by botulinum toxin lasted about 3 months. Botulinum toxin
      injections also significantly reduced fasciculation potentials in relaxed muscles
      (before, 0.86 +/- 0.19 fasciculations/sec; after, 0.45 +/- 0.11
      fasciculations/sec). These findings show that local intramuscular injections of
      botulinum toxin provide effective, safe, and long-lasting relief of cramps
      possibly by reducing presynaptic cholinergic stimulation of motor nerve terminals
      and by impairing the input/output function of intrafusal and extrafusal motor end
      plates.

TI  - [Rilmenidine in rosacea: a double-blind study versus placebo].
PG  - 687-91
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The usual treatments of rosacea (cyclines and metronidazole) are
      mainly effective on reducing the number of papules and pustules. Clonidine only
      was employed in order to treat flushes observed in rosacea. Rilmenidine is a
      central hypotensive drug which acts more specifically than clonidine on
      imidazoline receptors and which has no sedative side effects. The purpose of this
      study was to evaluate the efficacy of rilmenidine 1 mg/d in the treatment of
      rosacea. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 41 patients suffering from typical
      rosacea were selected in this randomised double blind study rilmenidine versus
      placebo. The study comprised an 1-month observation period without treatment
      followed by 3 months of treatment. The major assessment criteria was the
      proportion of responders at the end of the treatment period. Responders were
      defined as patients showing a decrease of more than 50 p. 100 in the count of
      papules and pustules. Minor criterias were the variation of the number of
      flushes, self-evaluated by the patient and the variation of the redness of the
      face, noted by the investigator on a scale from 0 to 5. RESULTS: Fifteen patients
      treated by rilmenidine (R) and 19 patients receiving the placebo (P) were
      evaluated. The proportion of responders was 69.2 p. 100 in group R and 57.1 p.
      100 in group P (p = 0.69). The variations of the number of papules and pustules
      and of the redness of the face were not significantly different in the two
      groups. The decrease in the number of flushes was higher in group R (around -13) 
      than in group P (around -5), but the difference was not really significant (p =
      0.076). Arterial pressure decreased in 3 patients in group R and in 2 patients in
      group P. Minor side effects were noted in a similar proportion of patients in the
      two groups. DISCUSSION: Rilmenidine is not efficient in reducing the number of
      papules and pustules but could decrease the number of flushes. Nevertheless, many
      patients were lost for follow-up and because of a major placebo effect, the
      conclusions of this study are not strong enough. Another study including more
      patients and using evaluation criteria based on the vascular components of
      rosacea could perhaps confirm this hypothesis.

TI  - Migraine treatment.
PG  - 325-33
AB  - Migraine is a primary headache disorder characterized by recurring attacks of
      pain and associated symptoms. Migraine sufferers require a continuum of clinical 
      care that depends on their disability and response to treatment. Treatment
      consists of: (1) prevention of attacks by avoidance of triggers; (2) the use of
      nonpharmacologic treatments; (3) treatment of the acute attack; and (4) long-term
      prophylactic therapy. Migraine is comorbid for affective disorders, epilepsy,
      stroke, and mitral valve prolapse. The therapy selected depends on the headache
      severity and frequency, the pattern of associated symptoms, comorbid illnesses,
      and the patient's treatment response profile. Acute treatment can be symptomatic 
      or specific, using drugs such as dihydroergotamine (DHE) or sumatriptan.
      Preventive treatment can be episodic, subacute, or chronic. The major drug groups
      include beta-adrenergic blockers, anti-depressants, calcium channel blockers,
      serotonin antagonists, anticonvulsants, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
      (NSAIDs). These can be divided into two major categories and second-line choices.

TI  - The use of newer antidepressants for panic disorder.
PG  - 54-8; discussion 59
AB  - Antidepressants are frequently prescribed to treat panic disorder. Although
      tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors both block panic
      attacks, they have many adverse effects such as orthostatic hypotension and
      weight gain. High potency benzodiazepines such as alprazolam are also efficacious
      but carry the risk of physical dependency. Data from research trials as well as
      clinical experience are accumulating to indicate that the serotonin selective
      reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)--fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and
      sertraline--and perhaps venlafaxine, which inhibits both serotonergic and
      noradrenergic reuptake, are useful antipanic medications. The possibility also
      exists that these newer antidepressants such as SSRIs and venlafaxine are
      superior in effectiveness to the previously available drugs and, when combined
      with cognitive-behavioral therapy, might provide the best treatment outcome for
      patients with panic disorder.

TI  - New developments in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder.
PG  - 39-45; discussion 46-7
AB  - The treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has changed dramatically in 
      the last 10 years. Currently, the serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) and the
      serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are considered the "first choice"
      agents for pharmacologic treatment of OCD, although few head-to-head comparisons 
      exist between any two specific agents. Strategies for nonresponders and partial
      responders to the SRI/SSRIs are reviewed. The only agents that have shown
      significant improvement as augmenting agents to an SRI/SSRI in systematic trials 
      have been clonazepam and haloperidol. Predictors of response to pharmacotherapy
      have been limited, but several reports have found that an early age at onset of
      OCD has been associated with a poorer response to medications. Long-term
      maintenance medication may be necessary for some, although behavioral therapy may
      improve the need for extended pharmacotherapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy,
      specifically exposure with response prevention, still remains an effective and
      important component of treatment for many. One of the newest developments is the 
      identification of a pediatric subtype of OCD characterized by prepubertal acute
      onset after group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis. Investigation
      trials with these children include immunomodulatory therapies and penicillin
      treatment and prophylaxis. If a unique subgroup of children with OCD can be
      identified, then novel treatments may prove effective and have a role in
      long-term prophylaxis.

      chronic daily headache associated with analgesic drugs abuse.
PG  - 97-100
AB  - The use of antagonists of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, or the
      administration of inhibitors of the synthesis or of the release of excitatory
      amino acids, enables the analgesic drug-dependence associated with chronic daily 
      migraine to be overcome without any physical abstinence sign. Follow-up period
      indicates that negative modulators of excitatory amino-acid function can induce a
      stable benefit. The persistent benefit is seemingly due to an inhibitory effect
      on the process underlying the hyperalgesia state which is a crucial feature of
      migraine. It can also be suggested that the antagonist activity at NMDA receptor 
      might play a role in very severe non-opioid analgesic drug dependence.

TI  - Effects of GABA-B agonist baclofen on bronchial hyperreactivity to inhaled
      histamine in subjects with cervical spinal cord injury.
PG  - 333-41
AB  - Bronchial provocation studies performed in our research center have consistently 
      demonstrated airway hyperresponsiveness to both inhaled methacholine and
      histamine in subjects with chronic cervical spinal cord injury (SCI). More
      recently, we reported that the airways of such subjects maintained on chronic
      baclofen (gamma-aminobutyric acid) therapy were not hyperreactive to inhaled
      methacholine. In this study we determined whether baclofen also blocks the
      effects of the bronchoprovocative agent histamine in subjects with cervical SCI. 
      Twenty-four male subjects with cervical SCI participated in this study; 14 were
      maintained on oral baclofen, and 10 served as age-matched controls. The subjects 
      were challenged with increasing concentrations of aerosolized histamine until
      either a 20% fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) from baseline
      (defined as PC20) was observed, or a maximum of 25 mg/ml histamine was
      administered. We found that 11 of the 14 baclofen subjects (78.5%) and 8 of the
      10 control subjects (80%) responded (PC20 < 8 mg/ml) to the histamine challenge. 
      Mean PC20 values among responders in the baclofen (PC20 = 2.91 +/- 2.3) and
      control (PC20 = 2.18 +/- 1.9) groups did not differ significantly. Because
      histamine acts directly on histamine receptors and indirectly on cholinergic
      pathways, our findings that baclofen blocks bronchoconstriction due to inhaled
      methacholine, but not that due to histamine, suggests that hyperresponsiveness in
      subjects with cervical SCI may be secondary to nonspecific airway
      hyperreactivity.

TI  - Pharmacological approaches other than opioids in chronic non-cancer pain
      management.
PG  - 187-90
AB  - Many pains are controlled by non-addictive procedures ranging from exercise to a 
      variety of analgesic medications. Some pains are controlled by analgesic drugs,
      but at the cost of intolerable side effects. This is true both for non-steroidal 
      anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids. The worst pains are most often controlled by
      opioids, but problems of tolerance and addiction limit these successes. This
      contribution provides a statement on non-addictive, non-opioid drugs which help
      to control pain. Just as these vary in their success, so they vary also in the
      strength of the scientific evidence which supports their use. The groups of drugs
      to be considered can be evaluated in three respects; evidence of analgesic effect
      in controlled trials; evidence of side-effects compared with control substances
      and with standard experience; evidence of usefulness in clinical practice. The
      latter which is the most important for practice often has the least scientific
      proof. Six main classes of drugs are recognized which provide analgesic effects, 
      other than opioids. 1) Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are widely accepted 
      as analgesics on the basis of animal studies, numerous controlled investigations 
      and clinical practice. Acetaminophene may not be anti-inflammatory, but is
      recognized as an effective analgesic which in many other respects resembles the
      above. 2) Muscle relaxants, e.g. cyclobenzaprine or baclofen have varied actions,
      but often provide some relief of pain. 3) Antidepressants may be analgesic if
      they relieve depression which is giving rise to pain. This applies to all
      anti-depressants. Some antidepressants have been shown to be analgesic in the
      absence of depression. The best accredited of these is amitriptyline.
      Antidepressants too have significant side effects. A serotoninergic hypothesis is
      insufficient to explain the actions of antidepressants in relieving pain in the
      absence of depression. 4) Phenothiazine neuroleptics (and possibly some others)
      may be analgesic. Drugs reported to be analgesic include chlorpromazine,
      fluphenazine, perphenazine, trifluoperazine, methotrimeprazine (levomepromazine) 
      among others. Haloperidol has also been utilized. Well controlled evidence exists
      with the use of methotrimeprazine (levomepromazine) used as an injection. The
      analgesic effect of oral neuroleptics is less well established and mostly depends
      upon clinical observation, withdrawal and re-challenge. 5) Anticonvulsants. 6)
      Other drugs. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and some muscle relaxants,
      e.g. cyclobenzaprine are best used in the short term. The gastrointestinal side
      effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been quite troublesome and 
      over 2% of patients followed over five years are at risk of developing peptic
      ulceration from such medication. Cyclobenzaprine is best used in short term
      treatment, but may be used intermittently for chronic pain. Antidepressants,
      neuroleptics, anticonvulsants and some other drugs can be used long term. Topical
      analgesic agents may also be used.

TI  - Assessment of functional limitation and disability in patients with fibromyalgia.
PG  - 4-13
AB  - Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is characterized by diffuse widespread
      musculoskeletal pain. The aims of this literature study were to review measures
      and instruments used to assess functional limitations and disability in patients 
      with FMS. A 10-year search was done on Medline, CATS, and CINAHL. Of the 73
      articles found, only standardized instruments and tests permitting quantification
      were included. Reviews, trials of medication therapy, epidemiological studies,
      and measures of the psychological and impairment level were excluded. The
      articles were divided into cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. No studies
      evaluating the reliability, validity or sensitivity of the functional tests
      applied to the FMS were found. Of the disability instruments reviewed, only the
      Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales and Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire were
      evaluated for reliability and validity for the FMS population. The Arthritis
      Self-Efficacy Scales and Quality of Life Scale proved their sensitivity,
      detecting change in a controlled longitudinal study.

AB  - In summary, it can be concluded that MVD has a long-term success rate equal or
      superior to percutaneous procedures without the higher rate of permanent
      neurologic sequelae. It is a safe operation with an almost negligible mortality
      and low morbidity in skilled hands. If the goal in the treatment of TGN remains
      obtaining a pain-free state without the need for medication and no permanent
      neurologic deficit, then MVD remains the definitive procedure of choice for
      typical TGN.

TI  - Effects of dantrolene on cooling times and cardiovascular parameters in an
      immature porcine model of heatstroke.
PG  - 135-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of dantrolene on cooling times and
      cardiovascular parameters in an immature porcine model of heatstroke. DESIGN:
      Prospective, randomized, controlled, multigroup study. SETTING: Research animal
      laboratory. SUBJECTS: Yorkshire piglets (n = 16), 4 to 5 wks of age, 3.5 to 4.5
      kg of body weight. INTERVENTIONS: Animals were slowly heated with a radiant heat 
      source to 43 degrees C and then maintained at this temperature for 30 mins. The
      animals were then removed from the heat source and randomized into one of four
      groups to receive either conventional cooling methods consisting of fluid
      resuscitation with 0.9% sodium chloride solution, sponging with room temperature 
      water, mechanical fanning, and gastric lavage with iced 0.9% sodium chloride
      solution (group 1), conventional cooling methods and dantrolene (group 2),
      conventional cooling methods and dantrolene's vehicle mannitol (group 3), or no
      treatment (group 4). Cooling times, defined as the time required to reach a core 
      body temperature of 38.5 degrees C, and cardiovascular parameters for each group 
      were then compared. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Animals in groups 1, 2, and 3 
      had significantly (p < .05) lower core body temperatures than animals that
      received no treatment at the conclusion of the experiment. Piglets in groups 2
      and 3 had faster cooling times than piglets in group 1 (p < .05). However, there 
      was no statistically significant difference in cooling times between the animals 
      in groups 2 and 3. There were no statistically significant differences in heart
      rate, mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, pulmonary artery occlusion
      pressure, or systemic vascular resistance index between animals in groups 1, 2,
      or 3. Group 3 piglets had higher cardiac indices and stroke indices than the
      piglets in the other groups (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic interventions
      with conventional cooling or conventional cooling and dantrolene provided
      significant improvement in cardiovascular function in an immature porcine
      heatstroke model. Dantrolene, given with conventional cooling methods, offered no
      significant improvement in cardiovascular parameters compared with conventional
      cooling methods alone. Dantrolene significantly shortened the cooling time
      compared with conventional cooling but did not significantly shorten the cooling 
      time compared with its vehicle, mannitol. Although dantrolene significantly
      shortened the cooling time, it did not appear to be superior compared with
      conventional cooling methods in treating heatstroke in this immature porcine
      heatstroke model.

TI  - Intrathecal ciliary neurotrophic factor delivery for treatment of amyotrophic
      lateral sclerosis (phase I trial).
PG  - 94-9; discussion 99-100
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This Phase I trial of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) delivered
      intrathecally for the treatment of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
      was designed to determine the safety of this new mode of administration as well
      as the pharmacokinetics and drug distribution. METHODS: CNTF was administered
      using a drug pump implanted into the lumbar subarachnoid space in each of four
      patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Escalating doses (0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 4, 
      and 8 micrograms/h) were infused for 48 hours per week in 2-week cycles until the
      highest tolerated dose was achieved. Patients were observed for side effects, and
      standardized muscle and respiratory function tests were performed. Cerebrospinal 
      fluid (CSF) levels of CNTF were determined using simultaneous lumbar and cervical
      taps. Plasma and CSF levels of antibodies, CSF cells and protein, and routine
      blood chemistries were monitored, as were weight and vital signs. RESULTS:
      Pharmacokinetic studies of four patients demonstrated that the distribution and
      clearance of recombinant human (rH)CNTF are similar to those of many small,
      water-soluble agents (morphine, baclofen, clonidine) and that the steady-state
      concentration of rHCNTF at the cervical level was 18 to 36% of that at the lumbar
      level. Lumbar CSF levels were in the range of 44 to 1230 ng/ml. Intrathecally
      administered rHCNTF had different adverse effects than the systemically delivered
      drug. With intrathecal administration, no asthenia, fever, chills, nausea, weight
      loss, increased cough, or sputum production was found. All patients who received 
      rHCNTF intrathecally experienced dose-related CSF pleocytosis (primarily
      lymphocytic) and rises in protein levels. No clinical signs of meningeal
      irritation, such as stiff neck, photophobias, or nausea, were seen. However, one 
      patient who had lumbar spinal stenosis developed severe burning and cramping leg 
      pain. A second patient developed a severe headache and leg and back cramping. No 
      abnormal clinical chemistry or hematological findings were encountered. Plasma
      levels of rHCNTF were below detection. Antibodies to rHCNTF were found in the
      systemic circulation of only one patient. The gradual decline in motor strength
      and performance of standard skills did not improve or worsen. CONCLUSIONS: In
      this first trial of a recombinant neurotrophic factor to be administered
      intrathecally by drug pump, the CNTF was well distributed along the spinal canal.
      Pain syndromes (headache, radicular pain) that were dose-related occurred in two 
      patients, but systemic side effects, which had been observed with subcutaneous
      rHCNTF, did not occur. Intrathecal drug pump delivery of neurotrophic factors may
      be the most appropriate way in which to test the efficacy of these high-molecular
      weight proteins, because high CSF levels can be achieved without significant
      systemic side effects.

      pain. Results of a multicenter randomized double-blind study].
PG  - 500-4
AB  - METHOD: The analgesic and muscle-relaxing properties of flupirtine maleate,
      chlormezanone and placebo were compared in a total of 184 patients. Of these
      patients, 164 met the criteria of the treatment plan (intention to treat), and
      the data of 140 patients were finally evaluated in accordance with the test
      protocol. A positive response was defined as a reduction in pain intensity and
      muscle tension by 2 categories on the 5-category verbal scale "very
      severe/severe/moderate/mild/ none" on the seventh day of treatment. RESULTS: In
      the per-protocol-analysis the responder rate was 60.9% for flupirtine, 47.8% for 
      chlormezanone, and 43.8% for placebo, the difference between drugs and placebo
      not being significant. The overall assessment of the physicians involved was very
      good/ good in 47.8% and satisfactory in 37.0% of the flupirtine group, very
      good/good in 45.6% and satisfactory in 17.4% of the chlormezanone group, the
      corresponding figures for the placebo group being 33.4% and 20.6%, respectively. 
      Flupirtine was thus superior to placebo (p = 0.007). The incidence of adverse
      drug reactions was 14.8% (8/54) for flupirtine, 19.3% (11/57) for chlormezanone, 
      and 7.3% (4/55) for placebo.

TI  - Drug therapy for back pain. Which drugs help which patients?
PG  - 2840-9; discussion 2849-50
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A brief review of current literature and issues on drug therapy for
      low back pain. OBJECTIVES: To identify current knowledge and future research
      needs related to drug therapy. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Drug therapy is one of
      many possible treatment choices for symptom relief in patients with low back
      pain. The variety of drugs used suggests that there is no uniquely successful
      form of drug therapy. One reason for uncertainty and slow progress in this area
      is the limited quality of many clinical trials for back pain, with inadequate
      description of patients and outcomes being common deficits. METHODS: A selective 
      review of randomized trials and systematic literature syntheses on drug therapy
      is given. RESULTS: Despite limitations, there is good evidence to support the
      efficacy of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for acute low back pain and fair
      evidence for the use of muscle relaxants. There is greater controversy about the 
      use of corticosteroids, which have been administered orally, intramuscularly, and
      epidurally. There is conflicting evidence regarding epidural injection of
      corticosteroids, but one meta-analysis suggests they may provide a small
      symptomatic improvement for patients with radiculopathy. Trials of systemic
      steroids and antidepressant drugs for managing chronic pain are inconclusive. The
      only randomized trial of local anesthetic injection into trigger points suggested
      that this treatment was equivalent to that of saline injection, needling without 
      injection, or vapo-coolant spray alone. CONCLUSION: It seems reasonable to
      recommend acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for patients with
      acute back pain, with efforts to minimize costs and complications. Muscle
      relaxants and narcotic analgesics may be appropriate for some patients, but
      selection criteria are unclear, and these drugs should be prescribed for fixed
      periods. Drug treatment for chronic low back pain is less clear, and a current
      controversy centers on the use of chronic narcotic analgesics for such patients. 
      Future research should include evaluating combinations of medications,
      combinations of medication and physical therapy, systemic corticosteroid therapy,
      trigger point injections, and narcotic use for patients with chronic pain. Spinal
      stenosis is common in the older population, and more drug trials are needed for
      this condition.

AB  - We reported a case of drug eruption induced by combined treatment with three
      different kinds of drugs, amoxapine, mexiletine hydrochloride and cefaclor. A
      63-year-old Japanese woman suffering from 11 years of standing reflex sympathetic
      dystrophy developed multiple erythematous papules on her trunk and extremities
      after taking 14 kinds of drugs. The provocation challenge produced positive
      reactions to amoxapine, mexiletine hydrochloride, and cefaclor, but was negative 
      to the other drugs. We discussed the mechanism of simultaneous sensitization to
      three different kinds of drugs in our case.

TI  - Antidepressant pharmacotherapy and the treatment of depression in patients with
      severe traumatic brain injury: a controlled, prospective study.
PG  - 582-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Untreated or poorly treated depression in patients who suffer from
      traumatic brain injury can result in greater functional disability and prolonged 
      or ineffective hospital and rehabilitation stays. Literature available on the
      pharmacologic treatment of depression after traumatic brain injury is scarce.
      This study investigated in a controlled and prospective manner the use of
      desipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, in a series of patients with severe
      traumatic brain injury. METHOD: Ten patients with severe traumatic brain injury
      and long-standing depression, as diagnosed by DSM-III-R criteria, were admitted
      to the study because of the intention to be treated with antidepressants. They
      were randomly assigned to blindly start on either desipramine treatment (N = 6)
      or placebo lead-in (N = 4). Patients starting with desipramine stayed on that
      drug; patients starting with placebo lead-in were blindly crossed over to
      desipramine after 1 month if there was no significant improvement demonstrated by
      DSM-III-R criteria. All rating clinicians, physicians, and patients were blind to
      actual treatment and any ratings data. DSM-III-R evaluations were done monthly.
      An affect/mood scale was done every 2 weeks. RESULTS: Of all patients evaluable
      using the DSM-III-R, 6 (86%) of 7 demonstrated resolution of depression and
      depressed mood during desipramine treatment. (Three received desipramine
      throughout the study; 3 others started taking placebo and crossed over to
      desipramine,) One patient refused evaluation on DSM-III-R throughout; 2 patients,
      both on desipramine, dropped out because of adverse effects (seizure, mania). In 
      addition, there was statistically significant (p = .001) improvement over time
      and different rates of improvement over time in the treated and untreated groups 
      for the affect/mood scale data. CONCLUSION: Results from this small study,
      utilizing a blinded, placebo lead-in design appear to (1) demonstrate the
      clinically significant effectiveness of desipramine in treating long-standing
      depression in a series of patients with severe traumatic brain injury, as rated
      with DSM-III-R criteria; (2) show statistically significant improvement on the
      affect/mood scale data, favoring the treated versus untreated (placebo lead-in)
      group.

TI  - Use of intrathecal baclofen in the treatment of patients with dystonia.
PG  - 1241-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Continuous infusion of intrathecal (IT) baclofen is a highly
      effective standard therapy for severe spasticity of spinal origin. By contrast,
      there is limited clinical experience regarding the use of IT baclofen in treating
      patients with dystonia, and little is known regarding the indications for
      treatment, efficacy, and safety of IT baclofen in this disorder. OBJECTIVE: To
      study retrospectively the effects of IT baclofen in treating 25 patients with
      severe segmental or generalized dystonia. SETTING: Neurological Institute,
      Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, New York, NY. PATIENTS: Twenty-five
      patients with severe segmental or generalized dystonia that was refractory to
      oral medications underwent IT baclofen test dosing. In addition to dystonia, 17
      patients had spasticity or painful spasms. Thirteen of 25 patients responded to
      the test doses of IT baclofen, according to unblinded neurological assessments
      that included the patient's subjective report; all 13 underwent implantation of a
      pump for continuous IT baclofen infusion. RESULTS: In contrast to reports of
      patients with spasticity of spinal origin, those with dystonia in the present
      series had a lower response rate to bolus IT baclofen doses and a smaller degree 
      of clinical improvement. For 10 of the 13 responders to the test doses of IT
      baclofen, dystonia rating scale scores of videotaped examinations by blinded
      observers detected no significant change (P < .07) in severity of dystonia.
      Retrospective data from 11 of 13 patients with implantable pumps, followed up for
      a mean interval of 21 months after pump insertion, showed continuing efficacy in 
      6 individuals (55%), based on a determination of patient satisfaction; however,
      only 3 patients (27%) reported a sustained improvement in functional capacity.
      Five (38%) of the 13 patients with implantable pumps experienced severe
      complications that required hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Despite recent reports 
      that have described the benefit in small numbers of patients with dystonia, we
      concluded that the role of IT baclofen in treating severe dystonia remains
      uncertain. Intrathecal baclofen may be more effective when dystonia is associated
      with spasticity or pain. In the present series, we detected no significant
      difference in the response to IT baclofen in patients with or without spasticity 
      or pain, perhaps owing to the small sample size.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship of the selective serotonin reuptake 
      inhibitors.
PG  - 444-69
AB  - The recently introduced antidepressants, the selective serotonin reuptake
      inhibitors (SSRIs) [citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine and
      sertraline], are known for their clinical efficacy, good tolerability and
      relative safety. They differ from each other in chemical structure, metabolism
      and pharmacokinetic properties. Therapeutic drug monitoring of these compounds is
      not widely used, as the plasma concentration ranges within which clinical
      response with minimal adverse effects appears to be optimal are not clearly
      defined. Almost all recent assays developed for the quantitative determination of
      SSRIs and their metabolites in blood are based either on the separation of SSRIs 
      by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or gas chromatography (GC).
      Citalopram and fluoxetine have been introduced as racemic compounds. There are
      some differences in the pharmacological profile, metabolism and pharmacokinetics 
      between the enantiomers of the parent compounds and their demethylated
      metabolites. Stereoselective chromatographic methods for their analysis in blood 
      are now available. With regard to the SSRIs presently available, no clearcut
      plasma concentration-clinical effectiveness relationship in patients with
      depression has been shown, nor any threshold which defines toxic concentrations. 
      This may be explained by their low toxicity and use at dosages where serious
      adverse effects do not appear. SSRIs vary widely in their qualitative and
      quantitative interaction with cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes in the liver. CYP2D6
      is inhibited by SSRIs, in order of decreasing potency paroxetine, norfluoxetine, 
      fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram and fluvoxamine. This may have clinical
      consequences with some but not all SSRIs, when they are taken with tricyclic
      antidepressants. Except for citalopram and paroxetine, little is known about the 
      enzymes which control the biotransformation of the SSRIs. There have been many
      reports on marked pharmacokinetic interactions between fluoxetine and tricyclic
      antidepressants. Fluoxetine has a stronger effect on their hydroxylation than on 
      their demethylation. Interactions observed between fluoxetine and alprazolam,
      midazolam and carbamazepine seem to occur on the level of CYP3A. Fluvoxamine
      strongly inhibits the N-demethylation of some tricyclic antidepressants of the
      tertiary amine type and of clozapine. This may lead to adverse effects but
      augmentation with fluvoxamine can also improve response in very rapid
      metabolisers, as it increases the bioavailability of the comedication.
      Fluvoxamine inhibits with decreasing potency, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP1A1,
      but it is also an inhibitor of CYP3A. Fluoxetine and fluvoxamine have shown to
      increase methadone plasma concentrations in dependent patients. Some authors warn
      about a combination of monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors with SSRIs, as this
      could lead to a serotonergic syndrome. Studies with healthy volunteers suggest,
      however, that a combination of moclobemide and SSRIs, such as fluvoxamine, should
      not present serious risks in promoting a serotonin syndrome. A combination of
      moclobemide and fluvoxamine has successfully been used in refractory depression, 
      but more studies are needed, including plasma-concentration monitoring, before
      this combined treatment can be recommended. Paroxetine is a substrate of CYP2D6, 
      but other enzyme(s) could also be involved. Its pharmacokinetics are linear in
      poor metabolisers of sparteine, and non-linear in extensive metabolisers. Due to 
      its potent CYP2D6 inhibiting properties, comedication with this SSRI can lead to 
      an increase of tricyclic antidepressants in plasma, as shown with amitriptyline
      and trimipramine. CYP3A has been claimed to be involved in the biotransformation 
      of sertraline to norsertraline. Clinical investigations (with desipramine)
      confirmed in vitro findings that CYP2D6 inhibition by sertraline is only
      moderate. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)

PG  - 1383-8
AB  - We designed a phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy of gabapentin in slowing
      the rate of decline in muscle strength of patients with amyotrophic lateral
      sclerosis (ALS) and to assess safety and tolerability. Gabapentin (800 mg) or
      placebo was administered t.i.d. in a randomized, double-blinded,
      placebo-controlled, trial for 6 months. We enrolled 152 patients at eight sites
      in the United States. The primary outcome measure was the slope of the arm
      megascore, the average maximum voluntary isometric strength from eight arm
      muscles standardized against a reference ALS population. A secondary outcome
      measure was forced vital capacity. Slopes of arm megascores for patients on
      gabapentin were compared with slopes of those taking placebo using a two-way
      ANOVA. We observed a nonstatistically significant trend (p = 0.057-0.08) toward
      slower decline of arm strength in patients taking gabapentin compared with those 
      taking placebo (mean difference 24%, median 37%). We observed no treatment effect
      on forced vital capacity. Gabapentin was well tolerated by patients with ALS.
      These results suggest that further studies of gabapentin in ALS are warranted.

TI  - Current pharmacologic treatment of multiple sclerosis symptoms.
PG  - 313-7
AB  - About 350,000 persons in the United States have multiple sclerosis, and primary
      care physicians are often called on to provide symptomatic therapy for these
      patients. We review our current pharmacologic approach to the management of
      multiple sclerosis exacerbations and the symptoms of spasticity, fatigue, bladder
      and bowel involvement, neurobehavioral complaints, pain syndromes, dystonic
      spasms, and tremor and ataxia.

TI  - Progress report on new antiepileptic drugs: a summary of the Third Eilat
      Conference.
PG  - 299-319
AB  - The Third Eilat Conference on New Antiepileptic Drugs was held at the Royal Beach
      Hotel from May 27 to May 30, 1996. Epileptologists and scientists from 20
      countries attended the conference, which was held to discuss critical issues in
      drug development, new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in development, progress reports
      and recent findings of newly marketed AEDs, the use of AEDs in special
      populations and their utilization in non-epileptic disorders. Over the last seven
      years, six new AEDs have been introduced worldwide and new information on their
      safety and efficacy has become available. These include felbamate, gabapentin,
      lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, topiramate and vigabatrin. Drugs in development
      include those at an advanced stage, such as remacemide and tiagabine, as well as 
      those just entering clinical trials, such as rufinamide (CGP 331010) and
      levetiracetam (ucb LO59). The following is a summary of the presentations for
      drugs in development and recent findings on newly marketed drugs.

TI  - SUNCT syndrome associated with cavernous angioma of the brain stem.
PG  - 503-6
AB  - A 62-year-old male patient with 2 years of SUNCT syndrome is described. The
      patient presented with long-lasting periods of frequent attacks of intense
      orbital pain with a duration of about 1 min, associated with ipsilateral
      conjunctival injection, lacrimation and rhinorrhea. Cranial MRI and cerebral
      angiography demonstrated an ipsilateral cavernous angioma of the pons, involving 
      the trigeminal roots. As the pain was refractory to most treatments, including
      carbamazepine, the patient asked for, and eventually underwent, direct surgical
      excision of the malformation. Following the operation, his neurological
      conditions rapidly deteriorated and he died of postoperative complications
      (haemorrhage).

TI  - Long-term outcome of patients with headache and drug abuse after inpatient
      withdrawal: five-year follow-up.
PG  - 481-5; discussion 461
AB  - Thirty-eight patients with "chronic daily" headache and ergotamine and/or
      analgesics abuse according to the criteria proposed by the International Headache
      Society were re-investigated 5 years after inpatient drug withdrawal. At the end 
      of the observation period, 19 patients (50.0%) had their headaches on only 8 days
      per month or less, 18 patients (47.4%) were free of symptoms or had only mild
      headaches. A close correlation was found between the frequency of headache and
      the duration of drug abuse, as well as between the intensity of headache and the 
      number of tablets taken per month. Frequency and intensity of headache had
      changed within the first 2 years after withdrawal, but remained stable
      afterwards. Fifteen patients (39.5%) reported on recurrent drug abuse. Patients
      with migraine showed a tendency towards a better prognosis compared to patients
      with tension-type headache or with combined migraine and tension-type headache.
      The results of this study highlight the long-term efficacy of inpatient drug
      withdrawal in patients with headache and ergotamine and/or analgesics abuse.

TI  - Clinical evaluation of gadodiamide injection in paediatric MR imaging.
PG  - 806-10
AB  - The safety and efficacy of intravenous gadodiamide injection, 0.1 mmol/kg body
      weight, have been evaluated in an open label, non-comparative as to drug, phase
      III clinical trial in 50 children from 6 months to 13 years of age, referred for 
      MRI requiring the injection of a contrast medium. The central nervous system and 
      other body areas were examined with T1 sequences before and after intravenous
      injection of the contrast medium. Overall safety was very good and no clinically 
      relevant changes were evident as regards heart rate and venous blood oxygen
      saturation after injection. No adverse event or discomfort was experienced by
      conscious patients that could with certainty be related to the contrast medium,
      but slight movements were observed in two sedated patients that could be related 
      to the injection. Comparing pre- and post-injection images, additional diagnostic
      information could be obtained from the latter in 41 patients (82%). In these
      images, the number of lesions detected increased and they were generally better
      delineated and their size more easily estimated. The results of this trial
      indicate that gadodiamide injection is safe and effective for MRI examinations in
      children.

TI  - Spasticity after stroke. Epidemiology and optimal treatment.
PG  - 332-40
AB  - Spasticity following stroke reflects a spectrum of clinical problems including
      increased muscle tone, abnormal limb posture, excessive contraction of antagonist
      muscles and hyperactive cutaneous and tendon reflexes. The prevalence of
      stroke-related disability in stroke survivors is high, and spasticity may be a
      significant component of this. Management strategies include a multidisciplinary 
      team approach utilising a variety of rehabilitation techniques. Although some
      interventions are well tolerated and fairly standardised, older adults may be
      particularly sensitive to drug treatment-related adverse effects. This article
      reviews some of the commonly employed interventions, such as oral medications,
      and some of the newer techniques, such as intrathecal baclofen infusion and
      botulinum toxin injections. The optimal management of spasticity following stroke
      in older adults requires careful goal setting and skilful combination of
      treatment modalities in order to produce the best outcome.

AB  - When caring for patients with disorders of the central nervous system such as
      migraine headaches, epilepsy, or MS, clinicians are faced with increasingly
      complex pharmacotherapeutic options. Pharmacotherapeutic strategies directed
      toward prevention, reversal, or cure of these diseases are hampered by an
      incomplete understanding of the underlying pathophysiology. In this decade of the
      brain, basic science research combined with difficult but necessary clinical
      trials may answer some seemingly overwhelming questions for these devastating
      illnesses.

TI  - A randomized, double-blind crossover trial of fluoxetine and amitriptyline in the
      treatment of fibromyalgia.
PG  - 1852-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of fluoxetine (FL) and amitriptyline (AM), alone
      and in combination, in patients with fibromyalgia (FM). METHODS: Nineteen
      patients with FM completed a randomized, double-blind crossover study, which
      consisted of 4 6-week trials of FL (20 mg), AM (25 mg), a combination of FL and
      AM, or placebo. Patients were evaluated on the first and last day of each trial
      period. Outcome measures included a tender point score, the Fibromyalgia Impact
      Questionnaire (FIQ), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scale, and visual analog
      scales (VAS) for global well-being (1 completed by the physician and 1 by the
      patient), pain, sleep trouble, fatigue, and feeling refreshed upon awakening.
      RESULTS: Both FL and AM were associated with significantly improved scores on the
      FIQ and on the VAS for pain, global well-being, and sleep disturbances. When
      combined, the 2 treatments worked better than either medication alone. Similar,
      but nonsignificant, improvement occurred in the BDI scale, the physician global
      VAS, and the VAS for fatigue and feeling refreshed upon awakening. Trends were
      less clear for the tender point score. CONCLUSION: Both FL and AM are effective
      treatments for FM, and they work better in combination than either medication
      alone.

TI  - Therapeutic trials in 200 patients with HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/ tropical

PG  - 345-55
AB  - We report here the results of therapeutic trials in 200 patients with
      HTLV-I-associated myelopathy (HAM)/tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP) conducted
      in our department between 1986 and 1993. Motor disability grades were improved by
      more than one grade in 69.5% (91/131) of patients by oral administration of
      prednisolone, 50% (3/6) by eperisone hydrochloride only, 43.8% (7/16) by blood
      purification (lymphocytapheresis and plasmapheresis), 40.0% (2/5) by intrathecal 
      injection of hydrocortisone, 30.0% (3/10) by intravenous injection of high-dose
      methylprednisolone, 23.3% (10/43) by interferon-alpha (intramuscular injection
      and inhalation), 22.2% (2/9) by azathioprine, 20.0% (4/20) by high-dose vitamin
      C, 16.0% (4/25) by erythromycin, 12.5% (3/24) by salazosulfapyridine, 11.8%
      (2/17) by mizoribine, 7.1% (1/14) by fosfomycin, and 6.3% (1/16) by thyrotropin
      releasing hormone. No critical side effects of these therapies were seen with the
      exceptions of one patient with adult respiratory distress syndrome due to
      cytomegalovirus infection and one patient with drug-induced hepatitis/hepatic
      failure. Selection of these treatments for patients with HAM/ TSP must be
      considered on the basis of age, sex, disease severity and complications to reduce
      adverse events and to improve quality of life. Although the results were a
      synopsis of different treatments given to 200 patients with HAM/ TSP as an open
      trial, we consider this the first report of a large-scale therapeutic trial in
      patients with HAM/TSP. The results of this study indicate that immunomodulatory
      therapies have some beneficial effects in HAM/TSP, and the functions of these
      agents are related to the pathophysiology of this disease.

TI  - The black widow: is she deadly to children?
PG  - 360-4
AB  - Pediatric cases of black widow spider envenomation (BWSE) were reviewed in order 
      to assess the morbidity and mortality in children with BWSE, and to make
      recommendations for optimal therapy. The methodology includes a retrospective
      chart review in an urban pediatric tertiary care hospital. Included were all
      pediatric patients admitted with the BWSE diagnosis in the last 10 years
      (1984-1994). The results are based on 12 children with ages ranging from 15
      months to 18 years. The BWSE syndrome is characterized by several common systemic
      effects. Our cases revealed abdominal pain (100%), hypertension (92%), muscle
      complaints (75%), a target lesion (75%), and irritability/agitation (66%) as the 
      most common symptoms. Treatments used included antivenin, calcium gluconate,
      benzodiazepines, and opioids. Eight of 12 patients recovered (had relief of
      symptoms) within 24 hours, often by 12 hours. Antivenin did appear to bring
      quicker relief of symptoms. Hypertension was severe but asymptomatic in all
      patients. There were no complications or deaths resulting from BWSE.

TI  - Treatment of peptic ulcer in the elderly. Proton pump inhibitors and histamine H2
      receptor antagonists.
PG  - 251-61
AB  - Some problems remain unresolved in the short and long term treatment of peptic
      ulcer in the elderly. These mainly concern the physiology and pathophysiology of 
      the aging stomach, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of
      antisecretory drugs, and the presence of different risk factors from those in
      patients under 60 years of age. The aim of this article is to provide a critical 
      review of the present-day clinical and pharmacological knowledge concerning the
      use of antisecretory drugs [histamine H2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) and proton 
      pump inhibitors] in the treatment of peptic ulcer in the elderly, taking into
      account the pathogenetic role of Helicobacter pylori. The available data from
      controlled trials show that the clinical efficacy and safety of short and long
      term antisecretory treatment for peptic ulcer are similar in elderly and younger 
      patients. In addition, there are no significant differences between H2RAs and
      proton pump inhibitors. In particular, in patients with nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced gastric or duodenal ulcer, H2RAs and
      omeprazole have proved useful even when NSAID therapy is continued. However, as
      in younger patients, significantly lower efficacy has been documented in short
      and long term prevention of gastroduodenal damage, limited to duodenal lesions
      for H2RAs and gastric lesions for omeprazole.

TI  - The musculoskeletal management of children with cerebral palsy.
PG  - 1135-50
AB  - Orthopedic management of children with cerebral palsy is best accomplished with a
      team approach, which generally is effective in the other neuromotor disabilities 
      of childhood, such as myelomeningocele and muscle disease. Because contracture
      development is inevitable in growing children with spastic musculature or muscle 
      imbalance and is a prime cause of musculoskeletal dysfunction, its control over
      time using therapy, bracing, and medication is essential. Problems such as severe
      contracture, joint deformity, and scoliosis interfere with the basic requirement 
      of comfortable seating in children with quadriplegic involvement and frequently
      require surgery. In ambulatory children, the use of three-dimensional gait
      analysis has allowed multilevel surgery to be appropriately planned, minimizing
      exposure to surgery and therapy.

TI  - Multiple sclerosis: clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment.
PG  - 1301-6, 1309-11
AB  - Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous
      system and is associated with periods of disability (relapse) alternating with
      periods of recovery (remission) and often results in progressive neurologic
      disability. Scientists believe that multiple sclerosis may be a T cell-mediated
      autoimmune disease. Treatment with high-dose pulses of intravenous
      methyl-prednisolone is usually associated with a good outcome in the short term. 
      A recent study suggests that interferon beta-1b may decrease the number of
      relapses in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis by 30 percent and also may
      decrease the development of new central nervous system lesions. Recently, another
      clinical trial of interferon beta-1a showed a 31 percent reduction in relapse
      rate and a significant reduction in the average number of active lesions. A third
      trial showed that 20 mg of copolymer-1, a random polymer of glutamic acid,
      lysine, alanine and tyrosine, reduced relapses by 21 percent without significant 
      side effects. Further investigation is needed, but these new treatments show
      great promise in alleviating this difficult clinical problem.

TI  - Lamotrigine: clinical experience in 200 patients with epilepsy with follow-up to 
      four years.
PG  - 209-14
AB  - This open, clinical study describes the use of lamotrigine in 200 adults and
      children with drug resistant epilepsy. Lamotrigine was used largely as add-on
      therapy and outcome was assessed by the patients, parents and carers and the
      physician in terms of reduction of seizure frequency, drug side-effects and
      improvement in quality of life. Of the 200 patients, 70 (35%) were rendered
      seizure free. Lamotrigine was especially helpful in resistant primary generalized
      epilepsy, complex partial seizures, mixed seizures subsequent to brain damage,
      Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and in complex partial seizures which secondarily
      generalized. Fifty-three patients ceased lamotrigine; 30 due to lack of effect,
      and 13 due to side-effects. Lamotrigine is a very useful antiepileptic medication
      of a "broad spectrum' nature being effective in primary generalized epilepsy and 
      partial seizures as add-on therapy. The side-effect profile is good with most
      side-effects being avoidable.

TI  - Tacrolimus (FK506)-induced cerebral blindness following bone marrow
      transplantation.
PG  - 569-72
AB  - Three patients who developed acute onset of cerebral blindness within 5-47 days
      of BMT using tacrolimus (FK506) as primary GVHD prophylaxis are described. This
      syndrome has been described with the use of cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506 in
      solid organ transplant recipients. CsA-induced cerebral blindness has also been
      noted in BMT recipients but to date there have been no reports of this
      complication in BMT patients receiving FK506. We have noted a striking similarity

TI  - Chronic intrathecal delivery of baclofen by a programmable pump for the treatment
      of severe spasticity.
PG  - 452-7
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy, safety, and
      cost-effectiveness of intrathecal baclofen delivered by a programmable pump for
      the chronic treatment of severe spasticity. Sixty-six patients with severe
      spasticity of spinal cord origin that was refractory to oral baclofen or who
      experienced intolerable side effects with this form of the drug were screened.
      The first nine participated in a double-blinded, randomized, placebo (normal
      saline)-controlled trial to determine response to a bolus dose of intrathecal
      baclofen. Subsequent patients were enrolled in an open-label treatment protocol
      without a placebo trial. All passed the screening, and the pump was implanted in 
      59 patients. Spasticity scores and medical costs before and after surgery were
      analyzed. In all patients, the mean Ashworth score for rigidity decreased from
      4.3 preoperatively to 1.4 (p < 0.0005) with use of intrathecal baclofen. The
      spasm frequency score decreased from a mean of 3.6 to 0.5 (p < 0.0005).
      Activities of daily living, sleep, and skin integrity improved, and pain was
      eradicated in some. Constipation occurred in six patients. A reduction in dosage 
      was necessitated by muscular hypotonia in three ambulatory patients, areflexic
      bladder and urinary retention in three others, and nausea, dizziness, and
      drowsiness in one. Catheter-related problems occurred 19 times in 15 patients.
      One pump was explanted because of infection in the pump pocket, and one was
      removed after it eroded through the skin. There were no pump failures. The use of
      intrathecal baclofen resulted in a decrease in the average length of subsequent
      hospitalizations. It is concluded that intrathecal baclofen delivered by an
      implanted programmable pump is a safe, effective, and cost-efficient method for
      treatment of severe intractable spinal spasticity.

TI  - Multiple sclerosis: symptomatic treatment.
PG  - 559-65
AB  - Reports of new therapeutic agents designed to suppress inflammatory processes in 
      multiple sclerosis have excited much interest but, thus far, have had little
      influence on symptoms, disability and handicap in patients. The clinical
      application of recent advances in physical, pharmacological and surgical
      approaches to management will, at least in the medium-term future, therefore
      offer significantly greater opportunities for improving the quality of life of
      patients with multiple sclerosis. Here, symptomatic treatment of the whole range 
      of difficulties encountered by patients with multiple sclerosis is reviewed in
      the context of the multidisciplinary strategy crucial to an optimal outcome.

TI  - Perioperative ischaemia in aortic surgery: combined epidural/general anaesthesia 
      and epidural analgesia vs general anaesthesia and i.v. analgesia.
PG  - 769-77
AB  - PURPOSE: The goal of this randomized study was to determine whether combined
      general and epidural anaesthesia with postoperative epidural analgesia, compared 
      with general anaesthesia and postoperative intravenous analgesia, reduced the
      incidence of perioperative myocardial ischaemia in patients undergoing elective
      aortic surgery. METHOD: Patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One
      group (EPI, n = 48) received combined general and epidural anaesthesia and
      postoperative epidural analgesia for 48 hrs. The other group (GA, n = 51)
      received general anaesthesia followed by postoperative intravenous analgesia.
      Anaesthetic goals were to maintain haemodynamic stability (+/- 20% of
      preoperative values), and a stroke volume > 1 ml.kg-1. A Holter monitor was
      attached to each patient the day before surgery. Leads 11, V2, and V5 were
      monitored. Myocardial ischaemia was defined as ST segment depression > 1 mm
      measured at 80 millisec beyond the J point or an elevation of 2 mm 60 millisec
      beyond the J point which lasted > 60 sec. An event that lasted > 60 sec but
      returned to the baseline for > 60 sec and then recurred, was counted as two
      separate events. The Holter tapes were reviewed by a cardiologist blind to the
      patient's group. RESULTS: There were no demographic differences between the two
      groups. Myocardial ischaemia was common; it occurred in 55% of patients. In
      hospital, preoperative ischaemia was uncommon (GA = 3, EPI = 8). Intraoperative
      ischaemia was common (GA = 18, EPI = 25). Mesenteric traction produced the
      largest number of ischaemic (GA = 11, EPI = 11) events. Postoperative ischaemia
      was most common on the day of surgery. Termination of epidural analgesia produced
      a burst of ischaemia (60 events in 9 patients). CONCLUSION: Combined general and 
      epidural anaesthesia and postoperative epidural analgesia do not reduce the
      incidence of myocardial ischaemia or morbidity compared with general anaesthesia 
      and postoperative intravenous analgesia.

TI  - Double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of topiramate (600 mg daily) for the
      treatment of refractory partial epilepsy.
PG  - 763-8
AB  - PURPOSE: We wished to evaluate adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures with
      topiramate (TPM) for efficacy and safety in a double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      randomized, parallel-group study. METHODS: Sixty outpatients with epilepsy (47
      men and 13 women, mean age 32.9 years) were studied. All had a documented history
      of partial-onset seizures with or without secondarily generalized seizures. After
      an 8-week baseline during which patients had at least one seizure per week, 30
      patients each were randomized to TPM 300 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) or placebo for
      12 weeks. RESULTS: TPM was significantly superior to placebo, as indicated by all
      efficacy assessments: greater median percent reduction from baseline in the
      average monthly seizure rate (46 vs. -12%, p = 0.004); greater number of
      treatment responders (patients with > or = 50% reduction in seizure rate) (47 vs.
      10%, p = 0.001), and better investigator (p = 0.002) and patient (p = 0.010)
      global assessments of treatment. Among TPM-treated patients, the most commonly
      reported adverse events (AE) were headache, somnolence, fatigue, dizziness, and
      abnormal thinking. Most AE were mild or moderate in severity. CONCLUSIONS: The
      results of the present trial indicate that TPM 600 mg/day is effective in the
      treatment of refractory partial-onset seizures with or without secondarily
      generalized seizures.

TI  - Chronic recurrent transverse myelitis or multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 209-14
AB  - The simultaneous occurrence of multiple sclerosis and transverse myelitis is
      known in the literature. Apart from the spinal symptoms, other neurological signs
      of brain involvement are usually found and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      reveals disseminated foci in the brain. The positive evoked responses, the
      immunological abnormalities of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and the
      oligoclonality together prove the presence of multiple sclerosis. In these cases 
      the symptoms of transverse myelitis can separately precede other signs of
      multiple sclerosis, or appear as a relapse. Recurrent transverse myelitis as an
      independent entity, with negative MRI and CSF immunology, is an exciting topic in
      terms of the etiological factors and therapeutic considerations. The view in the 
      literature is that the occurrence of transverse myelitis as an independent entity
      is rather rare. The present article reports the case of a female patient with
      recurrent spinal cord signs, and negative MRI and CSF immunology. During a
      ten-year follow-up observation period, symptoms of multiple sclerosis did not
      develop. Further studies of such cases are needed in order to clarify the
      etiological factors, the pathomechanism and the therapeutic considerations
      relating to this relatively new and probably independent clinical entity.

TI  - Choices in sedation: the balanced sedation technique.
PG  - 8-12; discussion 22-5
AB  - Patients undergoing surgery under regional anaesthesia may be anxious,
      uncomfortable or in pain. Therefore, effective sedation throughout the procedure 
      is an important aspect of patient management. The balanced sedation technique
      uses combinations of sedatives to meet the anxiolytic and analgesic needs of the 
      individual patient. For example, benzodiazepines are effective anxiolytics, while
      propofol can be used to provide a suitable level of sedation, especially in
      patients who have expressed a wish to remain asleep during the procedure.
      Analgesics should be considered only in those patients who are likely to
      experience pain during the procedure. Basic measures to increase the comfort of
      the patient and to facilitate the effect of pharmacological methods include
      supplementary non-pharmacological techniques, for example the use of a soft
      mattress to prevent back pain, infusion of warmed fluids and a warm operating
      atmosphere. This may extend to the opportunity for patients to listen to music if
      they have a fear of the sounds associated with the operating room, such as
      technical discussions by surgical staff or the sound of surgical instruments
      being used and discarded. The balanced sedation technique can, therefore, help to
      achieve the ideal goal of a comfortable patient who is free from anxiety and
      pain, and can sleep if desired.

TI  - Clinical course, early diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease in
      glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency.
PG  - 115-23
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (GDD) is a recessively
      inherited neurometabolic disorder associated with encephalopathic crises and
      severe extrapyramidal symptoms. Treatment regimens including glucose and
      electrolyte infusions during acute illnesses, oral carnitine supplementation
      and/or a low-protein or lysine-restricted diet have been recommended, but their
      efficacy has been documented only on an anecdotal basis. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We
      conducted a retrospective analysis of 57 patients with proven GDD-relating
      appearance and severity of neurological disease to age and clinical status at
      diagnosis, glutaric acid levels in body fluids, and different treatment regimens.
      RESULTS: Thirty-six patients were diagnosed after the onset of neurological
      disease (symptomatic group), twenty-one before (presymptomatic group). Carnitine 
      levels were found to be reduced in all patients at diagnosis. In the symptomatic 
      group, macrocephaly had been present around birth and was followed by rapid
      postnatal head growth in 70% of the children. The patients often showed symptoms 
      such as hypotonia, irritability, and jitteriness followed by an acute
      encephalopathic crisis occurring on average at 12 months of age. Common
      neuroimaging findings included frontotemporal atrophy, subependymal pseudocysts, 
      delayed myelination, basal ganglia atrophy, chronic subdural effusions and
      hematomas. In four patients the latter two findings were initially misinterpreted
      as resulting from child abuse. Other important misdiagnoses in older siblings who
      were affected and went undiagnosed include postencephalitic cerebral palsy,
      dystonic cerebral palsy and sudden infant death syndrome. Metabolic treatment did
      not convincingly improve the neurological disease, although it may have prevented
      further deterioration. Symptomatic treatment with baclofen or benzodiazepines was
      effective in reducing muscle spasms. Children in the presymptomatic group were
      diagnosed because of familiarity for the disease (n = 13), macrocephaly and/or
      additional minor neurological signs in infancy (n = 6), or acute encephalopathy, 
      which was fully reversible after prompt treatment (n = 2). After diagnosis, all
      children were treated with oral carnitine, fluid infusion during intercurrent
      illnesses and, in addition, a diet was started in 13 of the 21 children. All 21
      children except one (born prematurely at 31 weeks) have continued to develop
      normally up to now. Mean age at report is 6.3 years with a range from 6 months to
      14.8 years. In older patients, the neuroradiological changes, present in infancy 
      as in the symptomatic patients, became less prominent and in one girl
      disappeared. CONCLUSIONS: In presymptomatic children with GDD, the onset of
      neurological disease can be prevented by vigorous treatment of catabolic crises
      during illnesses together with carnitine supplementation. The importance of
      dietary therapy remains unclear and needs further evaluation. The potential
      treatability of GDD calls for increased attention to early presenting signs in
      order to recognize the disorder and to initiate treatment before the onset of
      irreversible neurological disease.

      injury: a case series.
PG  - 453-8
AB  - Spasticity may occurs as a result of different types of brain injury. The
      experience with six patients, aged 17-73 years, treated with clonidine for
      spasticity due to brain injuries of various causes is presented. These cases
      include a patient with traumatic brain injury, three patients with intracranial
      haemorrhage, a patient with a right basal ganglia stroke 3 years prior to a left 
      subdural haematoma associated with a fall, and a patient with cerebral palsy. To 
      varying degrees for each patient, clonidine was effective in reducing extremity
      hypertonicity. A possible mechanism of action is discussed. These case findings
      suggest clonidine may be useful in the management of spasticity associated with
      various forms of brain injury, and that formal studies of clonidine for this
      application appear warranted.

AB  - Anti-inflammatory agents and myorelaxants are the cornerstone of pharmacologic
      management of musculoskeletal disease. Combinations of these drugs are
      recommended for the treatment of muscle spasm and injury, whereas
      anti-inflammatory agents alone are used to treat inflammatory pain such as
      rheumatoid arthritis. Choosing the most effective regimen for patients with pain 
      can be difficult. This article reviews the pharmacology and clinical use of these
      agents to define how to use these medications better.

TI  - Update on tinnitus.
PG  - 455-65
AB  - The study of a disorder such as tinnitus is fraught with difficulties. Tinnitus, 
      like pain, is a subjective symptom. The problem is compounded because several
      different mechanisms must operate to cause the persistent sensation of tinnitus. 
      Therefore, it is difficult to measure objectively any improvements in the
      condition. For example, it has been reported previously that sectioning the
      eighth cranial nerve does not abolish tinnitus in a majority of patients;
      therefore, central mechanisms must act to preserve the tinnitus. Finally, we know
      that tinnitus can occur in a host of conditions other than ototoxicity, aging,
      and noise exposure. Other conditions that may produce tinnitus are migraine
      headache with auditory aura, temporal lobe seizures, and head injuries.
      Therefore, it is naive to conceptualize that tinnitus is a disorder with a
      unitary origin and a unitary "cure".

TI  - Amitriptyline. A review of its pharmacological properties and therapeutic use in 
      chronic pain states.
PG  - 459-76
AB  - Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant agent which also has analgesic
      properties. Whether its analgesic effects are linked to its mood-altering
      activity or attributable to a discrete pharmacological action (or a combination
      of both) is unknown. Clinical trials demonstrate that oral amitriptyline achieves
      at least a good or moderate response in up to two-thirds of patients with
      post-herpetic neuralgia and three-quarters of patients with painful diabetic
      neuropathy, neurogenic pain syndromes that are often unresponsive to narcotic
      analgesics. Amitriptyline has also demonstrated efficacy in heterogeneous groups 
      of patients with chronic non-malignant pain. Other possible areas of use for
      amitriptyline are in patients with fibromyalgia or as an adjuvant for
      uncontrolled cancer pain, although evidence for the latter application is
      limited. Adverse events resulting from the antimuscarinic activity of
      amitriptyline (primarily dry mouth and sedation) are commonly reported, even at
      the low dosages used for the control of pain. Low starting doses and careful
      dosage titration may help to minimise these effects. Orthostatic hypotension and 
      tachycardia, sometimes associated with tricyclic antidepressant agents, may also 
      pose a problem in the elderly. In summary, amitriptyline has a valuable place in 
      the treatment of chronic pain conditions that affect the elderly provided that
      the drug is used judiciously to minimise adverse effects. Importantly,
      amitriptyline remains the best studied of the antidepressant agents in
      post-herpetic neuralgia and diabetic neuropathy and is an important and effective
      treatment option in these syndromes.

TI  - A cost-effective approach to the diagnosis and treatment of fibromyalgia.
PG  - 323-49
AB  - The diagnosis of teh myalgic patient can prove to be challenging for even the
      most experienced of clinicians. The differential diagnosis includes many diseases
      that often present with weakness as well as pain. The diagnosis of fibromyalgia
      may now be made using the positive features of the patient's illness and
      classified according to well-defined criteria. The process is facilitated by the 
      demonstration of FTPs that are quite specific for the condition. The elicitation 
      of tenderness over these points is highly reliable and valid owing to high
      intrarater and interrater agreements observed in multiple studies. An algorithmic
      approach to differential diagnosis is presented. In addition, a stepwise approach
      to treatment based on published studies and geared to functional outcome measures
      in put forward in an attempt to encourage a cost-effective approach to care of
      these difficult patients.

TI  - Dose-related adverse effects of anticonvulsants.
PG  - 299-328
AB  - The serum concentration at which a given drug has full efficacy in delivering
      seizure control bears no predictable relationship to the concentration at which
      adverse effects will appear. In theory, the threshold for adverse effects should 
      be considerably higher than that for efficacy. For each agent this obviously
      happens most of the time, or the anticonvulsant would not be on the market, but
      there are also patients in whom this relationship is reversed. The adverse
      effects of this class of drugs are discussed from three points of view: the
      adverse effect type, the kinetic factors that so frequently determine the
      presence of adverse effects, and the specific characteristics of each drug. Some 
      less well recognized adverse effects syndromes that are not strictly dose related
      are considered. The importance of adverse effects in therapeutic monitoring is
      then addressed, and some strategies for maximising efficacy without the burden of
      long term functional impairment or distress are discussed. The usefulness of
      monotherapy is stressed with due attention to rational choice of second drugs,
      when necessary, based on mechanisms of antiepileptic action and adverse effects
      profiles. While most of these symptoms evolve gradually, there are times when
      acute, drastic, and even life threatening clinical overdose situations present
      themselves. Special attention is given to these scenarios, drawing on the drug
      profiles and clinical pharmacokinetics that define these events to propose
      methods of coping with the problems efficiently and effectively.

TI  - Amitriptyline and dexamethasone combined treatment in drug-induced headache.
PG  - 198-200
AB  - Frequent or regular intake of antimigraine drugs, including analgesics,
      constitutes a common cause of chronic daily headache. Discontinuation of
      symptomatic medication can produce an increase in head pain accompanied by
      withdrawal symptoms. We report the favourable outcome of treating a group of
      outpatients with the combination of amitriptyline, dexamethasone and sumatriptan.
      Dexamethasone (4 mg/day) was given intramuscularly for 2 weeks, amitriptyline
      orally at night (50 mg/day) for at least 6 months, and sumatriptan subcutaneously
      to treat acute headache attacks. Eighteen out of 20 patients abstained from drug 
      abuse. Eleven of these 18 patients showed a marked reduction in headache
      frequency (at least 75% in relation to the basal value), and were considered
      "very good responders". The other seven patients experienced at least 50%
      reduction in headache frequency compared to baseline. This preliminary report
      suggests that drug-induced headache can be treated effectively in outpatients
      using dexamethasone, amitriptyline and sumatriptan in combination with
      significant benefit in everyday life conditions.

AB  - Transdermal scopolamine patches have been extensively prescribed for nonspecific 
      dizziness and vestibular disorders. Patient response may be favorable and side
      effects are generally limited to xerostomia and blurred vision. However, subtle
      dependency and outright addiction may develop. Tapered reduction and drug
      elimination will suffice to eliminate the dependency. However, hospitalization
      may be necessary to treat severe cases of physiological chemical dependency.
      Long-term use of transdermal scopolamine patches carries a risk of chemical
      dependency. Prescribing physicians should review and heed the manufacturer's
      recommended use.

TI  - The pathogenesis and treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder.
PG  - 129-47
AB  - The outlook for patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) began to change
      in the early 1980s with the introduction of clomipramine (CMI), a serotonergic
      antidepressant. The observation that only drugs with a serotonergic profile are
      effective in OCD has been the basis for the serotonergic hypothesis of OCD. The
      serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitors are effective alternatives for CMI and
      can be used when the patient cannot use or tolerate CMI. In this review, we
      examine the pathophysiology of OCD, based on drug response profile, peripheral
      markers of serotonergic function, pharmacologic challenge studies, and
      neuroimaging. We also consider the medications found to be effective in OCD, the 
      length of treatment, with special regard for maintenance therapy, and such issues
      as the approach for the treatment-resistant patient, augmentation strategies, and
      nonpharmacological treatments.

TI  - Baclofen in the treatment of cerebral palsy.
PG  - 77-83
AB  - Baclofen, a gamma-aminobutyric acid agonist, acts at the spinal cord level to
      impede the release of excitatory neurotransmitters that cause spasticity. Oral
      baclofen improves cerebral spasticity mildly, but its activity is limited because
      of its poor lipid solubility. Cerebrospinal fluid baclofen levels after
      intrathecal administration are many times higher than those achieved after oral
      administration. Continuous intrathecal baclofen infusion has been used to treat
      cerebral spasticity in two patient groups: in older ambulatory children with
      inadequate underlying leg strength, and in patients with severe spasticity in
      both the upper and lower extremities. Responsiveness to intrathecal baclofen is
      confirmed by test injections before insertion of a programmable subcutaneous
      pump. Continuous intrathecal baclofen infusion dosages vary from 27 to 800
      micrograms/day. Continuous intrathecal baclofen infusion reduces spasticity in
      the upper and lower extremities, and improves upper extremity function and
      activities of daily living but has no effect on athetosis in the dosages used to 
      treat spasticity. Complications related to the intrathecal catheter occur in
      approximately 20% of patients, and infection requiring pump removal occurs in
      approximately 5%. Preliminary studies indicate that continuous intrathecal
      baclofen infusion alleviates some forms of generalized dystonia associated with
      cerebral palsy.

TI  - Combination vigabatrin and lamotrigine therapy for intractable epilepsy.
PG  - 51-6
AB  - Vigabatrin (GVG) and lamotrigine (LTG) are new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs)
      individually effective as add-on therapy for refractory seizures. The efficacy of
      GVG and LTG in combination was evaluated in a prospective audit of 42 patients
      with intractable epilepsy. There was a statistically significant median reduction
      of 62% (P < 0.025) from a median baseline monthly seizure frequency (MSF) of 29
      (mean 59, 95% CI 22, 96) to a median MSF of 11 (mean 23, 95% CI 8, 38) during a
      median treatment period of eight months, with a greater than 50% reduction in MSF
      in 29 patients (69%) treated with the add-on combination of GVG and LTG. The
      additional MSF reduction achieved by the combination amounted to 21% (18% when
      GVG was added to LTG and 24% when LTG was added to GVG). The median trough plasma
      lamotrigine concentration was 9.9 mg/l (range 3.4-19.6 mg/l). The average daily
      dose of LTG was 517 mg (range, 175-800 mg) and GVG 2400 mg (range, 1500-3500 mg).
      Adverse events requiring alteration of therapy occurred in 24 patients (57%) with
      a drop-out rate of 12%. The combination of GVG and LTG should be considered as a 
      therapeutic option in patients with intractable epilepsy. The results of the
      present study support the need to confirm additive efficacy of GVG and LTG by
      conducting controlled trials of this combination therapy.

TI  - Methsuximide therapy of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.
PG  - 47-50
AB  - Currently valproic acid is considered to be the drug of first choice for juvenile
      myoclonic epilepsy (JME) resulting in a 70-90% control rate for all seizure types
      associated with JME. In those situations where valproic acid fails to control
      seizure activity, results in unacceptable side-effects, or is declined due to
      potential side-effects, an alternative effective monotherapy would be desirable. 
      Five adolescent female patients were placed on methsuximide for JME. All five
      patients have been seizure free with the use of methsuximide and four out of five
      are now on methsuximide monotherapy with good success. C.L. has now had complete 
      seizure control on methsuximide monotherapy, a total of 1200 mg a day, for 7
      years with the exception of one seizure event occurring on an attempted
      discontinuation of methsuximide after being 5 years seizure free. Methsuximide
      monotherapy as demonstrated in these five patients is an effective treatment for 
      JME.

TI  - Drug therapy in multiple sclerosis: a study of Nova Scotia senior citizens.
PG  - 303-18; discussion 302
AB  - We conducted a study to determine the types and costs of drugs used by Nova
      Scotia senior citizens with multiple sclerosis (MS) compared with the types and
      costs of drugs used by all senior citizens in Nova Scotia. Administrative claims 
      databases from the Nova Scotia Seniors Pharmacare program for persons aged 65
      years or older were linked to the Dalhousie Multiple Sclerosis Research Unit
      (DMSRU) clinical database (1980-1994). Analyses compared persons with MS aged 65 
      years or older who attended the DMSRU at least once with the general population
      of senior citizens. Not all persons with MS attended the DMSRU. In aggregate,
      Pharmacare costs in 1993-1994 for patients with MS aged 65 years or older (N =
      52) were $975.00 Canadian per capita compared with $590.00 Canadian for all
      senior citizens in Nova Scotia (N = 108,646). Thus average drug costs for the
      senior citizens with MS were 65% greater than those for all senior citizens
      covered by Nova Scotia's comprehensive, publicly funded Pharmacare program.
      Compared with other senior citizens, those with MS more frequently received
      alpha-blockers, anticholinergics, cholinergics, tricyclic antidepressants,
      anticonvulsants, antifatigue agents, antispasticity agents, and antibiotics for
      bladder infections.

TI  - A double-blind randomised comparison of the effects of epidural clonidine,
      lignocaine and the combination of clonidine and lignocaine in patients with
      chronic pain.
PG  - 337-43
AB  - Twenty patients with chronic pain who previously had obtained analgesia from
      epidural clonidine and lignocaine agreed to participate in a double-blind
      crossover study of lumbar epidural clonidine (150 micrograms), lignocaine (40 mg)
      and the combination of clonidine (150 microgram) and lignocaine (40 mg), all
      drugs were given in a volume of 3 ml. There were 11 women and 9 men with a mean
      age 53 years (range: 23-78 years); 9 patients had low back and leg pain, 9 had
      neuropathic pain, 1 had pelvic pain and 1 Wegner's granulomatosis. Pain intensity
      and pain relief, as well as sensory and motor blockade, were assessed for 3 h
      following each injection. The combination was reported as the best pain relief by
      12 of the 17 patients who completed all three arms of the study; 4 patients
      reported that clonidine was the best, 1 patient reported that none of the
      injections provided any analgesia and no patient reported that lignocaine was the
      best. SPID analysis revealed a significant difference between the combination and
      lignocaine (P < 0.05) but no other significant difference. TOTPAR analysis
      revealed no significant difference between any of the injections. All 3
      injections produced evidence of neurological blockade; clonidine produced sensory
      blockade in 3 patients and motor blockade in 3 patients. Lignocaine produced
      sensory blockade in 6 patients and motor in 8 patients, while the combination
      produced evidence of neurological blockade in all 17 patients, sensory in 6 and
      motor in 11 patients. Overall there was no relationship between neurological
      blockade and analgesia. The reported side effects appeared to be related to
      clonidine. These data indicate that in these patients with chronic pain epidural 
      clonidine had a supra-additive effect and behaved more like a co-analgesic than a
      pure analgesic.

      distinguishing between treatment groups, and 3) to identify weakness in trial
      design. Our analysis of 24 clinical trials demonstrates the large diversity of
      outcome measures and measurement instruments that have been used to detect
      differences between treatment and placebo in the management of FMS. Whereas
      certain outcomes, such as self-reported pain and sleep quality, were frequently
      measured, other clinically important outcomes, such as functional and
      psychological status, were infrequently included in data collection. Finally, we 
      identified several significant potential sources of bias, including potential
      flaws in subject selection and group allocation, inadequate randomization,
      incomplete blinding, errors in outcome measurement, and inappropriate analysis of
      data.

AB  - We studied the effects of intrathecal baclofen upon voluntary movements. Eleven
      patients with spasticity of different etiology and one patient with idiopathic
      dystonia were studied. Six patients participated in a double-blind trial.
      Kinematic/dynamic and electromyographic (EMG) patterns were recorded during
      attempts at single-joint elbow or ankle voluntary movements and isometric
      contractions. Reflex responses were also recorded. Baclofen suppressed spastic
      signs in 10 patients: it eliminated clonus and decreased the co-contraction of
      antagonist and distant muscle groups. Baclofen could induce weakness,
      particularly in patients with cerebral palsy (CP). Patients with hemi-syndromes
      did not notice any effects of baclofen in their 'unaffected' limbs. Intrathecal
      baclofen could improve voluntary movements in some patients with spasticity
      resulting in better walking and usage of arms. We hypothesize that spasticity
      induces an adaptive reaction at a segmental level that includes an increase in
      the number and/or affinity of GABA-sensitive receptors.

TI  - Postoperative pain management in the neurosurgical patient.
PG  - 179-93
AB  - We hope to have inspired an interest in approaching the pain management issues in
      this challenging group of patients. Despite significant progress in understanding
      the pathophysiology of pain, the development of therapeutic options, and the
      publication and dissemination of guidelines, this progress does not seem to have 
      been adopted into clinical practice. Bonica has stated "for many years I have
      studied the reasons for inadequate management of postoperative pain, and they
      remain the same.... Inadequate or improper application of available information
      and therapies is certainly the most important reason". Let us accept the
      challenge to re-evaluate pain management in the postoperative neurosurgical
      patient. Future development may provide enhanced multimodal analgesia with the
      development of enantioselective NSAIDs and peripherally acting opioids that do
      not cross the blood-brain barrier. Targeted inhibition of the central
      neuroplasticity that underlies sensitization, rather than attempts to use
      pre-emptive analgesics, may be more fruitful. Inhibition of excitatory amino
      acids may prove beneficial for perioperative neuroprotection and pain management.
      In addition, longer-acting local anesthetics show significant promise. The
      importance of understanding the specific benefits available and matching these
      characteristics to the particular patient is emphasized. Evaluation of outcomes, 
      including morbidity and patient satisfaction, will determine if effective and
      rational provision of analgesia may indeed be safer than withholding analgesia.
      However, it is clear that re-evaluation and refinement of conventional therapy is
      necessary.

TI  - Metoclopramide increases the bioavailability of dantrolene in spinal cord injury.
PG  - 64-71
AB  - A study was conducted to determine the effect of metoclopramide on the
      disposition of dantrolene in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) and in
      neurologically intact, able-bodied volunteers. Fifteen serum samples each were
      collected from 6 able-bodied volunteers and 13 patients with SCI (7 paraplegics, 
      6 quadriplegics) in a prospective, open-label, pharmacokinetic study of a single 
      100-mg oral dose of dantrolene. After a washout period, a single 10-mg
      intravenous dose of metoclopramide was given along with dantrolene to the
      patients with SCI only, and the study was repeated in sequential, crossover
      fashion. Concentrations of dantrolene were measured by a high-performance liquid 
      chromatography (HPLC) assay. Numerical integration was used to calculate area
      under the curve (AUC) and mean residence time (MRT). Differences were studied
      using paired and two-sample, nonparametric tests, with 0.05 as the significance
      level. Without metoclopramide, the AUC of dantrolene was larger in able-bodied
      volunteers than in patients with SCI, and the MRT of dantrolene was similar both 
      groups. When patients with SCI received metoclopramide before treatment with
      dantrolene, the median increase in the AUC for dantrolene was 57%, with no change
      in MRT. This pharmacokinetic interaction is probably attributable to augmented
      absorption and could alter the pharmacologic action of dantrolene. Concurrent
      treatment of patients with SCI with metoclopramide and dantrolene should be
      accompanied by careful surveillance to avoid toxicity and preserve efficacy.

TI  - Clinical scales for multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 1-9
AB  - Many neurological rating scales have been suggested to assess the impact of
      multiple sclerosis on patients, but none has been universally accepted. The
      Kurtzke Extended Disability Status Scale has been the most widely used despite
      its imperfections. It combines disability and impairment, has moderate
      inter-rater reliability, and its overall score is heavily weighted toward
      ambulation. The Scripps Neurological Rating Scale attempts to quantify impairment
      as measured by the traditional neurological examination. However, this and other 
      impairment scales lack direct relevance to patients' functional health status.
      The Ambulation Index and some of the quantitative upper limb dysfunction
      assessment methods are sensitive and reproducible, but they only measure limited 
      aspects of the wide range of disabilities encountered in multiple sclerosis.
      Current scales of disability and activities of daily living, such as the
      Incapacity Status Scale and the Functional Independent Measure, are not sensitive
      to the type of change which occurs in multiple sclerosis. The relationship
      between abnormalities on magnetic resonance images of the brain and disability
      has been difficult to ascertain. Although recently developed imaging acquisition 
      methods may demonstrate abnormalities which are more closely correlated with
      disability, the demonstration of prevention, stabilization or recovery from
      disability using clinical scales will remain the final arbiter of success in
      clinical trials. We suggest guidelines for an improved disability scale.

TI  - Intrathecal octreotide for relief of intractable nonmalignant pain: 5-year
      experience with two cases.
PG  - 203-7
AB  - Somatostatin is distributed in the substantia gelatinosa in the dorsal horn of
      the spinal cord, and its application has been found to produce an inhibitory
      effect on nociceptive neurons. Although intraspinal administration of
      somatostatin-14 produces pain relief in patients with cancer and in postoperative
      patients, its short half-life limits its clinical usefulness. Octreotide, a
      synthetic analog of somatostatin, is more stable and not been associated with
      neurodegenerative changes when administered intrathecally in dogs. Intrathecal
      octreotide provides analgesia without adverse drug effects when administered
      chronically for cancer pain; however, treatment periods have been limited. This
      article describes the 5-year clinical course of two patients receiving
      intrathecal octreotide for severe, intractable nonmalignant pain. Included in
      this description are the results of blinded, randomized "N of 1" trials conducted
      in each of these patients.

TI  - Dystrophinopathies: clarification and complication.
PG  - 13-20
AB  - The purpose of this review is to analyze the clinical applications of a
      remarkable series of advances made in molecular genetics, primarily with regard
      to Becker muscular dystrophy. A new classification is required to clarify such
      syndromes as Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy. Dystrophinopathies can be
      seen in patients with early onset and a severe course (Duchenne muscular
      dystrophy), patients with later onset and milder weakness (Becker muscular
      dystrophy), patients with myalgia and cramp syndrome, and patients with dilated
      cardiomyopathies. Dystrophin testing in muscle is the most sensitive test for
      identification of dystrophinopathy patients, although gene deletion studies can
      make the diagnosis in most cases.

TI  - Pain associated with spinal cord injury.
PG  - 447-50
AB  - Management of pain after spinal cord injury remains a difficult clinical problem.
      In particular, neuropathic spinal cord injury pain, like other forms of
      deafferentation pain in which there is loss or modification of normal afferent
      sensory inputs, is notoriously resistant to currently available modes of
      treatment. Although there have been some advances in our understanding of spinal 
      cord injury pain, the mechanisms of neuropathic spinal cord injury pain remain
      largely unknown and treatment is often ineffective. This review presents findings
      from recent publications that deal with the mechanisms and management of spinal
      cord injury pain.

TI  - Eclampsia--are we doing enough?
PG  - 505-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This paper reviews the cases of eclampsia managed at the Kandang
      Kerbau Hospital with respect to incidence, management, maternal and perinatal
      outcome. METHOD: A retrospective analysis of eclampsia occurring over a 4-year
      period from January 1990 to December 1993. RESULTS: There were 27 cases of
      eclampsia among 59,599 deliveries during the study period, giving an overall
      incidence of 45.3 per 100,000 deliveries. Sixteen patients were nulliparous and
      the mean age was 29 years. Two-thirds of the cohort were booked patients and more
      than half of the cohort (55.6%) had their first seizure despite being in
      hospital. The majority (86.2%) of all seizures recorded occurred in the
      antepartum and intrapartum period. Eleven of the patients (40.7%) were
      asymptomatic prior to the first fit while headache was the commonest symptom of
      impending eclampsia in the remainder. Fifteen patients (55.6%) had significant
      proteinuria and this was associated with significant neonatal morbidity. The mean
      gestational age was 35.9 weeks and the mean birth weight was 2,328g. Major areas 
      of substandard management included failure to administer anticonvulsant
      prophylaxis and antihypertensive agents when indicated, failure to assess for
      proteinuria, and failure to closely monitor the hypertensive and proteinuric
      patient. Seven patients developed convulsions despite anticonvulsant prophylaxis.
      Twenty-four patients were delivered by Caesarean section. There were 26 live born
      infants (singletons) and one abortus. There was no perinatal mortality. Neonatal 
      morbidity was frequent and attributable to prematurity (51.9%) and birth asphyxia
      (29.6%). The majority of infants were well neurologically on long term follow-up.
      There was no maternal mortality but significant morbidity was present in 8
      patients (29.6%). High uric acid levels were associated with intrauterine death, 
      prematurity and intrauterine growth retardation. Seven patients remained
      hypertensive on follow-up. Residual neurological deficits persisted in 3
      patients. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of eclampsia at Kandang Kerbau Hospital
      shows an unsteady decline over the past 4 years. It carries significant foetal
      mortality (3.7%) as well as neonatal (74.1%) and maternal (29.6%) morbidity. The 
      observation that neither the occurrence of antenatal office visits nor
      hospitalisation prevents eclampsia, and that substandard management was
      identified in most of the cases (77.8%) shows that there is no room for
      complacency and that more needs to be done. Improvement in patient assessment,
      institution of appropriate preventive therapy, a high index of suspicion even in 
      apparently low-risk patients coupled with a disease notification system and
      regular audit may be the key strategies to reduce the incidence of this dreaded
      obstetric complication.

TI  - Intrathecal baclofen--a multicentre clinical comparison of the Medtronics
      Programmable, Cordis Secor and Constant Infusion Infusaid drug delivery systems.
PG  - 551-4
AB  - A retrospective review was carried out of 34 consecutive traumatic spinal cord
      damaged patients who have had the Medtronics Programmable, Cordis Secor or
      Constant Infusion Infusaid intrathecal baclofen drug delivery systems inserted
      between July 1987 and 1992. The results indicate that whilst this treatment has
      many benefits there is a significant risk of complications, some potentially
      fatal. It should only be provided by a skilled and experienced team. The
      Medtronics Programmable pump is an excellent pump. It is of particular benefit
      where the therapeutic window is small or fine-tuning required. The Constant
      Infusion Infusaid is adequate if less precise control and continuous infusion is 
      sufficient. It is of particular benefit in financially disadvantaged countries.
      The Cordis Secor device is helpful when unpredictable intermittent relief of
      spasticity is required but is otherwise limited by its complication rate.

TI  - Status epilepticus in acute ischemic stroke.
PG  - 453-7
AB  - Stroke is one of the most frequent causes of acute symptomatic status
      epilepticus. The aim of this study was to investigate the electroclinical
      features of status epilepticus in acute ischemic stroke. Nine consecutively
      admitted patients with status epilepticus during ischemic stroke were examined:
      five of them had convulsive unilateral or generalized status epilepticus for from
      24 hours to 9 days after a large hemispheric infarction, always associated with
      EEG epileptiform abnormalities; the remaining four had focal motor status
      epilepticus during the first 24 hours after a small cortical or subcortical
      infarction, and showed no clear EEG changes. Status epilepticus in acute ischemic
      stroke may have two distinct electroclinical patterns of different prognostic
      significance.

TI  - Is quinine effective and safe in leg cramps?
PG  - 588-93
AB  - Muscle cramp is a recurrent and painful condition and a common complaint among
      elderly subjects and patients treated with hemodialysis. It is commonly nocturnal
      and can disturb a good night's sleep. No specific cause can be identified;
      therefore, therapy is mostly symptomatic. Quinine sulfate, an antimalarial drug, 
      is widely used as an effective therapy for idiopathic leg cramps. Several
      double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies have questioned the
      effectiveness of quinine in leg cramps; whereas other studies have shown
      significantly more benefit with use of quinine in reducing the frequency and
      severity of cramps compared with placebo or vitamin E. The mechanism of this
      beneficial effect is obscure, however. Quinine appears to decrease the
      excitability of the motor end plate, thereby reducing the muscle contractility.
      Most patients consider quinine beneficial for their leg cramps, which is
      difficult to refute by scientific data. More important, cramp is a subjective
      symptom, therefore difficult to measure objectively. Consequently, scientific
      studies designed to prove or disprove the effectiveness of quinine can be subject
      to flaws. Further, a dosage of 200 to 300 mg of quinine every night has not been 
      shown to cause significant side effects. Nevertheless, quinine should be used in 
      a small dose and cautiously, especially in the elderly and patients with renal
      failure, and should be avoided in patients with liver disease.

TI  - Tourette's disorder and related problems: a review and update.
PG  - 121-32
AB  - Tourette's disorder is a complex, multifaceted condition of neurological origin
      with psychiatric symptomatology characterized by multiple motor and vocal tics.
      It begins during childhood and has a waxing and waning course. Coexisting
      obsessive-compulsive symptoms, attentional problems, and other behavioral
      features are common. Pathophysiology involves dysfunction in basal ganglia and
      related corticothalamic circuits. Many patients who present in clinical settings 
      have mild to moderate symptoms and require only education, monitoring, and
      long-term follow-up. Those with more-severe symptoms require treatment, typically
      including both pharmacotherapy and nonmedication approaches. In addition to
      traditional neuroleptic treatment, a variety of agents such as clonidine,
      serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, and tricyclic antidepressants can be used. Further
      investigation is needed in a variety of areas, including longitudinal follow-up
      studies of children, adolescents, and adults with Tourette's disorder; systematic
      investigation of psychiatric comorbidity and the heterogeneity of the disorder;
      clarification of the phenomenological similarities and differences between
      Tourette's disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder; and neuroimaging and
      neuropsychological studies of Tourette's disorder and related problems.
