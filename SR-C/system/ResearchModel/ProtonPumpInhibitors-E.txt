TI  - Management of gastroesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 309-18
AB  - Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a chronic condition requiring long-term
      treatment. Simple lifestyle modifications are the first methods employed by
      patients and, because of their low cost and simplicity, should be continued even 
      when more potent therapies are initiated. Potent acid-suppressive therapy is
      currently the most important and successful medical therapy. Whereas healing of
      the esophageal mucosa is achieved with a single dose of any proton pump inhibitor
      (PPI) in more than 80% of cases, symptoms are more difficult to control. Patients
      with persistent symptoms on therapy should be tested (preferably with combined
      multichannel intraluminal impedance and pH) for association of symptoms with
      acid, nonacid, or no GER. Long-term follow-up studies indicate that PPIs are
      efficacious, tolerable, and safe medication. So far, promotility agents have
      shown limited efficacy, and their side-effect profile outweighs their benefits.
      Antireflux surgery in carefully selected patients (ie, young, typical GERD
      symptoms, abnormal pH study, and good response to PPI) is as effective as PPI
      therapy and should be offered to these patients as an alternative to medication. 
      Still, patients should be informed about the risks of antireflux surgery (ie,
      risk of postoperative dysphagia; decreased ability to belch, possibly leading to 
      bloating; increased flatulence). Endoscopic antireflux procedures are recommended
      only in selected patients and given the relative short experience with these
      techniques, patients treated with endoscopic procedures should be enrolled in a
      rigorous follow-up program.

TI  - Extraesophageal manifestations of GERD.
PG  - 285-99
AB  - The association between gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and
      extraesophageal disease is often referred to as extraesophageal reflux (EER).
      This article reviews EER, discussing epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and
      treatment with a focus on the most studied and convincing EER disorders-asthma,
      cough, and laryngitis. Although EER comprises a heterogeneous group of disorders,
      some general characterizations can be made, as follows. First, although GERD's
      association with extraesophageal diseases is well-established, definitive
      evidence of causation has been more elusive, rendering epidemiological data
      scarce. Secondly, regarding the pathogenesis of EER, 2 basic models have been
      proposed: direct injury to extraesophageal tissue by acid and pepsin exposure or 
      injury mediated through an esophageal reflex mechanism. Third, because heartburn 
      and regurgitation are often absent in patients with EER, GERD may not be
      suspected. Even when GERD is suspected, the diagnosis may be difficult to
      confirm. Although endoscopy and barium esophagram remain important tools for
      detecting esophageal complications, they may fail to establish the presence of
      GERD. Even when GERD is diagnosed by endoscopy or barium esophagram, causation
      between GERD and extraesophageal symptoms cannot be determined. Esophageal pH is 
      the most sensitive tool for detecting GERD, and it plays an important role in
      EER. However, even pH testing cannot establish GERD's causative relationship to
      extraesophageal symptoms. In this regard, effective treatment of GERD resulting
      in significant improvement or remission of the extraesophageal symptoms provides 
      the best evidence for GERD's pathogenic role. Finally, EER generally requires
      more prolonged and aggressive antisecretory therapy than typical GERD requires.

TI  - Pharmacoeconomic modeling of prior-authorization intervention for COX-2 specific 
      inhibitors in a 3-tier copay plan.
PG  - 327-34
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine from a health plan perspective the cost-effectiveness of 
      cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) specific inhibitors, with and without a
      prior-authorization (PA) process. METHODS: A modeling exercise was employed,
      based on prescription drug claims for a managed care organization with 3.8
      million health maintenance organization (HMO) and preferred provider organization
      (PPO) members. Drug claims revealed 96154 members (2.9% of the 3.3 million
      members with a pharmacy benefit) who received either one or more prescriptions
      for a COX-2 drug or a nonspecific nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).
      These patients were stratified into 2 groups for further analysis, those having a
      concurrent proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and those without a concurrent PPI.
      Decision analysis was used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of COX-2 therapy.
      Actual health plan drug claims data were used to determine utilization and
      prescribing patterns of nonspecific NSAIDs, COX-2 specific inhibitors, and PPIs. 
      Results from the literature from 8 clinical trials were employed to determine the
      probability of a serious gastrointestinal (GI) event. Cost-effectiveness analysis
      (CEA) was used to determine the cost of each therapy, including the predicted
      cost to treat a serious GI event in a drug benefit design with PA versus a
      benefit design without PA. RESULTS: Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) showed that
      the cost per success no serious GI event) for Cox-2 specific inhibitors with PA
      was US dollars 278 versus US dollars 422 without PA. CONCLUSIONS: The one-year
      model predicted that costs associated with an increase in COX-2 utilization after
      removal of PA would exceed the costs to administer PA and treat NSAID-related
      serious GI events in the managed care population. Based upon this CEA, PA appears
      to be an effective tool to manage COX-2 pharmacy costs. Further examination of
      the medical claims would be useful to validate the assumed GI event rates with or
      without PA and to further demonstrate more definitively the value of a PA program
      for COX-2 drugs.

TI  - Effect of a single oral dose of rabeprazole on nocturnal acid breakthrough and
      nocturnal alkaline amplitude.
PG  - 2583-6
AB  - AIM: To study the effect of rabeprazole (RAB) on nocturnal acid breakthrough
      (NAB) and nocturnal alkaline amplitude (NAKA) and to compare it with omeprazole
      (OME) and pantoprazole (PAN). METHODS: By an open comparative study, forty
      patients with active peptic ulcer were randomly assigned to receive one of the
      three PPIs (proton pump inhibitor) with a single oral dose. They were divided
      into RAB group (10 mg), OME group (20 mg) and PAN group (40 mg). Twenty healthy
      volunteers were enrolled to the control group (without taking any drug).
      Intragastric pH monitoring was then performed 1 hour before and 24 hours after
      the dose was given. RESULTS: No clinically undesirable signs and symptoms
      possibly attributed to the administration of RAB or OME and PAN were recognizable
      throughout the study period. All subjects completed the study according to the
      protocol. All data were processed by a computer using the Student t test or t'
      test followed by an analysis of covariance. P<0.05 was considered to have
      statistical significance. The intragastric pH of NAB was significantly higher in 
      RAB group (1.84+/-0.55) than in either OME group (1.15+/-0.31) or PAN group
      (1.10+/-0.30) (both P<0.01). RAB produced a longer sustaining time (4.65+/-1.22
      h) on NAKA than OME (3.22+/-1.89 h) (P<0.05), PAN (3.15+/-1.92 h) (P<0.05), and
      the sustaining time of NAKA in RAB group was longer than that in the healthy
      control group (P<0.01) too. In addition, RAB produced a much higher pH on NAKA
      (6.41+/-0.45) in comparison with PAN (6.01+/-0.92) (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: A single
      oral dose of 10 mg RAB may increase the pH of NAB and shorten the sustaining time
      of NAB, and it may increase the pH of NAKA as well as prolong the sustaining time
      of NAKA.

AB  - Current evidence suggests that PPIs might be effective in maintaining patients in
      remission during continued NSAID use and that the combination of omeprazole plus 
      diclofenac is as effective as treatment with celecoxib in preventing recurrent
      bleeding. Larger outcome studies comparing the combination of a PPI with other
      nonselective NSAIDs and a selective COX-2 inhibitor (and the combination of a
      selective COX-2 inhibitor with a PPI or misoprostol) are required to determine
      whether or not any regimen will further decrease or eliminate the risk of ulcer
      complications in high-risk individuals.

TI  - Gastroesophageal reflux disease: clinical manifestations.
PG  - 195-200
AB  - Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is generally a lifelong illness that
      affects many people, but its significance is often underestimated. Chronic
      abnormal gastric reflux results in erosive esophagitis in up to 60% of patients
      with GERD. Esophageal stricture, Barrett's esophagus, and esophageal
      adenocarcinoma are the most serious complications of GERD. Although heartburn and
      acid regurgitation are the most common complaints, extraesophageal symptoms such 
      as noncardiac chest pain, laryngitis, coughing, and wheezing can be
      manifestations of GERD. Unfortunately, the severity of symptoms is not a reliable
      indicator of the severity of erosive esophagitis. Endoscopy is the preferred
      method to diagnose and grade erosive esophagitis, and various classification
      systems are used to grade disease severity. The Los Angeles Classification is a
      valid and widely accepted system to evaluate the severity of erosive esophagitis.
      The immediate goals of treatment are to provide effective symptomatic relief and 
      to achieve healing in patients with esophageal damage. The treatment regimen
      often begins by prescribing a therapy to reduce gastric acid secretion. A proton 
      pump inhibitor is the preferred agent for many patients. Because GERD is a
      chronic, relapsing disease, long-term maintenance therapy is usually necessary to
      relieve symptoms, prevent complications, and improve the quality of life in
      patients with GERD.

TI  - An overview of proton pump inhibitors.
PG  - 182-90
AB  - SUMMARY: Proton pump inhibitors are the standard of treatment for acid-related
      disorders. These disorders include gastroesophageal reflux disease and its
      complications (i.e., erosive esophagitis and Barrett's esophagus), peptic ulcer
      disease, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, and idiopathic hypersecretion. Proton pump
      inhibitors are also successfully used for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori
      infection and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. There are currently five proton
      pump inhibitors approved by the Food and Drug Administration and available in the
      United States. These are omeprazole (Prilosec), lansoprazole (Prevacid),
      rabeprazole (Aciphex), pantoprazole (Protonix), and esomeprazole (Nexium). This
      review discusses the history of proton pump inhibitors and compares and evaluates
      the pharmacology including mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics, administration, dosage, and drug interactions. Information
      regarding therapeutic indications, clinical efficacy, short- and long-term side
      effects, and cost is also presented. A case presentation offers an analysis of
      the use of proton pump inhibitors in individualized patient care.

      above protocols. Thirty-nine patients (31 male, eight female, mean age 62 yr)
      were included in group A and 38 (28 male, 10 female, mean age 61 yr) in group B. 
      RESULTS: The initial hemostasis rate, rebleeding rate, duration of hospital stay,
      volume of blood transfused, number of operations needed, and number of deaths
      were not significantly different between the two groups. The mean number of
      electrocoagulations and the subsequent mean duration of electrocoagulations were 
      significantly higher in group B patients (7.0 +/- 3.8 and 14.1 +/- 7.6 s,
      respectively) compared with those of group A (4.6 +/- 2.6 and 9.3 +/- 5.3 s,
      respectively) (p < 0.01). Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis
      revealed that among sex, age, location of bleeding, ulcer size, endoscopic
      severity of bleeding, and the size of the gold probes, lesser endoscopic severity
      of bleeding (chi(2) = 31.1, p < 0.01), large size of the gold probe (chi(2) =
      23.9, p < 0.01), and small ulcer size (chi(2) = 13.4, p < 0.01) were the only
      factors significantly associated with a smaller number of electrocoagulations.
      CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the use of large-size gold probes was significantly
      associated with a lower number of electrocoagulations, resulting in the reduction
      of electrocoagulation duration. However, the clinical relevance of these findings
      is questionable because the efficacy of both sizes of gold probe after adrenaline
      injection in the treatment of bleeding peptic ulcers was similar.

TI  - Eradication of Helicobacter pylori improves the healing rate and reduces the
      relapse rate of nonbleeding ulcers in patients with bleeding peptic ulcer.
PG  - 2149-56
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A causal relationship between Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and
      peptic ulcer complications remains obscure. The aim of this study was to
      determine the importance of H. pylori and other risk factors for healing rate,
      ulcer recurrence, and rebleeding in patients with bleeding peptic ulcer. METHOD: 
      A total of 223 patients with H. pylori positive bleeding peptic ulcer were
      randomly allocated to three treatment groups: 1) quadruple therapy (QT) (88
      patients); 2) dual therapy (DT) (88 patients); and 3) omeprazole and placebo
      therapy (OPl) (47 patients). Endoscopic assessment was performed initially and at
      8 and 52 wk. Ulcer healing and eradication rates were assessed; endpoints were
      ulcer relapse and ulcer rebleeding during 52 wk. RESULTS: Results after 8 and 52 
      wk were available for 211 and 179 patients, respectively. Eradication rate was
      100% (95% CI = 96-100%) in the QT, 84% (95% CI = 74-91%) in the DT, and 4% (95%
      CI = 1-15%) in the OPl group. Ulcer healing rate was 95% (95% CI = 91-98%) in H. 
      pylori negative and 8% (95% CI = 70-91%) in H. pylori positive patients. Ulcer
      relapses occurred in 2% (95% CI = 0.5-6%) of H. pylori negative and in 38% (95%
      CI = 24-54%) of H. pylori positive patients, and rebleeding occurred in five
      patients (three H. pylori positive and two negative). CONCLUSIONS: Eradication of
      H. pylori infection enhances healing of bleeding peptic ulcers after endoscopic
      therapy. H. pylori infection is an important independent risk factor for
      relapsing of nonbleeding ulcers in patients with bleeding peptic ulcer.

TI  - Belching: dyspepsia or gastroesophageal reflux disease?
PG  - 2139-45
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Eructation (belching) is a common symptom seen in clinical practice. 
      Because either belching or heartburn may result from transient lower esophageal
      sphincter relaxations, it has been proposed that belching may be a manifestation 
      of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). In this retrospective study we
      evaluated the prevalence of belching in dyspepsia and GERD and the relation of
      belching to acid reflux events documented by pH monitoring. METHODS: We examined 
      the prevalence, frequency, and severity of belching and other GERD symptoms by
      use of standardized questionnaires in 180 GERD patients (group A) and 78
      dyspeptic controls (group B) referred for evaluation at our institution. GERD was
      defined as either endoscopic esophagitis (or Barrett's esophagus) or positive
      DeMeester score (>14.2) on pH monitoring or both. Dyspeptic patients had normal
      endoscopy and pH studies. We also analyzed the relationship of belching to acid
      reflux events during the 24-h period of pH studies. RESULTS: Of 180 GERD
      patients, 132 (70%) reported belching during pH monitoring, versus 63 of 78
      dyspeptic patients (80%) (p = ns). Similarly, 163 of 180 GERD patients (90%)
      reported heartburn versus 64 of 78 of dyspeptic patients (82%) (p = ns). Review
      of symptom questionnaires revealed no significant difference in belching severity
      between groups. However, heartburn and acid regurgitation were significantly more
      severe among GERD patients. There was a significantly higher correlation of both 
      heartburn and belching with acid events in patients with GERD compared with
      patients with dyspepsia. In addition, although both belching and heartburn were
      significantly improved in patients with GERD, belching scores remained unchanged 
      after proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy in patients with dyspepsia.
      CONCLUSIONS: Belching is as common and as severe in patients with dyspepsia as it
      is in patients with GERD. Belching and heartburn in GERD patients are more likely
      correlated with episodes of pathological acid reflux. Because belching cannot be 
      clinically used as a discriminatory symptom, ambulatory pH monitoring should be
      considered to elucidate the relationship of belching to acid reflux in patients
      with dyspepsia or GERD.

TI  - Overuse of acid suppressive therapy in hospitalised patients with pulmonary
      diseases.
PG  - 1143-50
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Overuse of acid suppressive therapy (AST) has been reported in
      hospitalised patients, but the use in specific patient categories is unexplored. 
      We assessed the use of and indication for AST and upper endoscopic investigations
      in hospitalised patients on a pulmonary ward compared with patients on other
      wards. METHODS: 301 patients were enrolled in the study. 162 were hospitalised on
      a pulmonary ward with a control group consisting of 139 from both a surgical and 
      general internal medicine ward. Adequate indications for AST were those strongly 
      supported by medical literature. RESULTS: Among the 301 patients enrolled, 132
      (44%) used AST. 78 (59%) had no adequate indication for AST. On the pulmonary
      ward 79 (49%) patients used AST, compared to only 10 (20%) on the internal
      medicine ward (P < 0.05). On the pulmonary ward 68% of the patients had no
      adequate indication for AST, which was more common than inappropriate use of
      ASTon the control wards (P < 0.05). The most common inadequate indication for AST
      was peptic ulcer prophylaxis during corticoidsteroid therapy. CONCLUSION: In
      hospitalised patients a significant overuse of AST was observed, particularly
      among pulmonary patients. More adequate use of AST can contribute to substantial 
      savings for the health-care system.

TI  - [Omeprazole, amoxicillin and clarithromycin in the treatment of
      helicobacterpylori, in 7 and 10-day regimens].
PG  - 177-83
AB  - AIM: The most accepted treatment for infection by Helicobacter pylori is the
      proton pump inhibitor based therapy with two antibiotics. However, there is no
      consensus regarding the duration. The purpose here was to compare eradication
      percentages in the omeprazole+amoxicillin+clarithromycin regimen administered
      during 7 days versus 10 days and confront the results with a previous 14-day*
      experience in Peru. METHOD: Patients from the Central Military Hospital and
      Peruvian-Japanese Hospital evidencing chronic upper gastrointestinal tract
      symptoms were recruited. We excluded patients with peptic ulcer. Biopsies were
      taken for diagnosis, for urease and PCR tests, culture and coloring with silver. 
      Omeprazole+clarithromycin+amoxicillin was used during 7 days versus 10 days.
      Control endoscopy was performed one month after treatment had been completed and 
      molecular biology techniques were used to differentiate recurrences from new
      infections. Susceptibility to clarithromycin was assessed. RESULTS: 36 patients
      were included in each group. Eradication was the same in both groups: 86.1%
      (31/36). In several patients in whom the bacteria persisted, the same initial
      nucleus was found. In a previous study* using this same regimen during 14 days, a
      93% eradication was obtained. 91.18% of our samples were susceptible to
      clarithromycin. CONCLUSIONS: In Peru, the omeprazole+clarithromycin+amoxicillin
      combination gives results higher than 80% in the eradication of infection by
      Helicobacter pylori. The 7 and 10 days regimens eradicated the bacteria in 86% of
      our patients.

TI  - Current consensus on the diagnosis and treatment of H. pylori-associated
      gastroduodenal disease.
PG  - 163-73
AB  - Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a spiral shaped bacterium that resides in the 
      stomach mucosa. Isolation of H. pylori from the stomach mucosa changed the
      erstwhile widely held belief that the stomach contains no bacteria and is
      actually sterile. Once H. pylori is safely ensconced in the mucus, it is able to 
      neutralize the acid in the stomach by elaborating an enzyme called urease. Urease
      converts urea, of which there is an abundant supply in the stomach (derived from 
      saliva and the gastric juice), into bicarbonate and ammonia, which are strong
      bases. These bases form a cloud of acid-neutralizing chemicals in the vicinity of
      the organisms, protecting them from the acid in the stomach. This urea hydrolysis
      reaction is utilized for the diagnosis of H. pylori infection in the urea breath 
      test (UBT) and the rapid urease test (RUT). In Japan, both invasive tests, such
      as bacterial culture, histopathology and RUT, and non-invasive tests such as UBT 
      and serology are conducted for the diagnosis of H. pylori infection. For
      confirming the results of eradication therapy, UBT is considered to be the most
      sensitive and specific. In order to treat H. pylori infection, a new one-week
      triple therapy regimen (lansoprazole or omeprazole + amoxicillin +
      clarithromycin) has been approved for use in patients with peptic ulcer disease
      in Japan. As for H. pylori eradication in the case of other diseases in which the
      bacterium has been implicated (e.g., chronic atrophic gastritis, gastric MALT
      lymphoma, gastric cancer, non-ulcer dyspepsia, chronic urticaria, idiopathic
      thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)), further basic and clinical investigation is
      required.

TI  - Endoscopic therapy for GERD--baking, sewing, or stuffing: an evidence-based
      perspective.
PG  - 142-9
AB  - The concept of using endoscopic therapy for the treatment of symptomatic
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a relatively recent development.
      Currently, three basic techniques are approved for use in the United States. To
      date, clinical trials have examined either a thermal approach, endoscopic
      suturing, or injection intervention in the area of the lower esophageal
      sphincter. However, the trials for each type of endoscopically directed therapy
      have varied in methodologic design and data analysis. It is important to
      recognize these differences when attempting to compare the efficacy and outcomes 
      for each endoscopic therapy. Additionally, the risk/benefit profile must be
      carefully evaluated for each of these interventions before considering it a
      viable treatment strategy.

TI  - Step-down from multiple- to single-dose proton pump inhibitors (PPIs): a
      prospective study of patients with heartburn or acid regurgitation completely
      relieved with PPIs.
PG  - 1940-4
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Management costs for gastroesophageal reflux disease are high because
      of the expensive medications used for maintenance therapy. Previous studies have 
      illustrated the success of step-down from proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) to
      less-expensive therapy once symptoms have abated. This study was conducted to
      determine whether patients requiring greater than single-dose PPI for initial
      symptom resolution could be stepped-down to single-dose PPI and whether this
      intervention decreased costs or adversely affected quality of life. METHODS:
      Consecutive patients in whom greater than single-dose PPI had completely
      alleviated reflux-type symptoms (heartburn or acid regurgitation) were recruited 
      through the use of pharmacy records of PPI prescriptions. Eligible subjects
      completed baseline demographic information and quality-of-life surveys and were
      stepped-down to single-dose PPI (lansoprazole 30 mg or omeprazole 20 mg daily).
      Follow-up continued for 6 months or until subjects reported recurrence of
      reflux-type symptoms, at which point PPIs were reinstituted at the dose that had 
      originally alleviated the subjects' symptoms. The primary outcome was the
      proportion of subjects in whom step-down was successful, defined as no recurrence
      of reflux-type symptoms on single-dose PPI. RESULTS: A total of 117 subjects
      enrolled in the study; all were followed to the primary endpoint. 79.5% did not
      report recurrent symptoms of heartburn or acid regurgitation during the 6 months 
      after step-down to single-dose PPI. Logistic regression revealed that longer
      duration of PPI use before study enrollment was associated with greater
      likelihood of symptom recurrence with step-down. Although quality of life was not
      significantly altered, dyspepsia (excluding reflux-type symptoms) increased.
      Overall costs of management were reduced. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients
      rendered asymptomatic on greater than single-dose PPI might be subsequently
      stepped-down to single-dose therapy without recurrence of reflux-type symptoms.
      This intervention can decrease management costs without adversely affecting
      quality of life.

TI  - Endoscopic implantation of enteryx for treatment of GERD: 12-month results of a
      prospective, multicenter trial.
PG  - 1921-30
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of endoscopically 
      implanting a nonresorbable biocompatible polymer (Enteryx) in the distal
      esophagus and proximal gastric cardia for the treatment of gastroesophageal
      reflux disease (GERD). METHODS: In a prospective, multicenter, international
      trial, 85 well-controlled GERD patients who were receiving chronic proton pump
      inhibitor (PPI) therapy underwent Enteryx implantation under fluoroscopic
      visualization, without general anesthesia. After the procedure, patients were
      discharged within approximately 2-4 h. Patients were judged to be treatment
      responders if after implantation they reduced PPI dosage by >/=50%. Follow-up
      evaluations were conducted at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months and included medication
      usage, symptoms, quality of life, endoscopy, pH monitoring, manometry, and
      documentation of adverse events. RESULTS: At 12 months, 80.3% (95% CI =
      69.9%-88.3%) of 81 evaluable patients were treatment responders. Of the
      responders, 87.7% completely discontinued PPIs, and 12.3% reduced PPI dosage by
      >/=50%. Treatment response was more likely in patients with residual implant
      volume of >/=5 mL (p = 0.027). Other patient and treatment variables were not
      predictive. Both GERD heartburn and regurgitation symptom scores significantly
      improved at 12 months compared with baseline (p < 0.001). There were significant 
      reductions in median supine, upright, and total percent time of esophageal
      exposure to pH <4. Endoscopically assessed esophagitis grades were unchanged. No 
      serious adverse events were encountered. Transient retrosternal chest pain was
      experienced by 91.8% of patients. This pain was seldom severe and was typically
      successfully managed with prescription pain medication. CONCLUSIONS: Enteryx
      implantation allows most patients to discontinue PPI therapy, improves their
      symptoms, and reduces esophageal acid exposure. The effects of implantation are
      long-lasting, and morbidity is transient and minimal. The procedure requires
      basic endoscopic skills and seems to provide a useful option in the effective
      clinical management of GERD.

TI  - Pantoprazole: a new proton pump inhibitor in the management of upper
      gastrointestinal disease.
PG  - 773-808
AB  - Pantoprazole, the third proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to become available, has been
      extensively investigated. Pantoprazole inhibits acid more powerfully than
      histamine H(2) receptor antagonists (H(2)RAs) and omperazole 20 mg and raises
      median 24-h gastric pH from about 1.5 to 3-4 in healthy volunteers and in
      duodenal ulcer patients to above 5. Results from studies have confirmed that
      pantoprazole is superior to H(2)RAs in speed of healing and symptom relief in
      patients with peptic ulcer. In patients with duodenal ulcer pantoprazole was as
      effective as omperazole 20 mg and in patients with gastric ulcer pantoprazole was
      statistically superior to omeprazole 20 mg after 4 weeks. In triple combination
      therapy of peptic ulcer disease, the mean eradication rate of Helicobacter pylori
      in data pooled from 32 pantoprazole-based studies was 86% and compliance with
      treatment was about 90%. Results pooled from 5 large clinical trials of
      gastroesophageal reflux disease showed healing rates significantly superior to
      those achieved with H(2)RAs and similar to those of other PPIs at 4 and 8 weeks. 
      Symptom relief was more rapid with pantoprazole and maintenance treatment kept
      the majority of patients in remission; relapse rates at 1 year were 25-28% on 20 
      mg daily and 6-22% on 40 mg daily. Maintenance treatment with pantoprazole 40 mg 
      has been shown to keep most patients with aggressive or refractory ulcer and
      reflux disease in remission for up to 3 years. Pantoprazole was also effective in
      the management of patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. In volunteers given
      aspirin, pantoprazole 40 mg proved significantly superior to ranitidine and
      placebo in preventing the development of mucosal damage and was significantly
      better than placebo in preventing gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcer in arthritic
      patients on nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Clinical trials, postmarketing
      surveillance and long-term studies have confirmed that pantoprazole is effective 
      and safe for the short- and long-term management of peptic ulcer and reflux
      disease, with side effects similar in incidence and type to those of H(2)RAs.

PG  - 219-23
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of omeprazole in treating irritable infants
      with gastroesophageal reflux and/or esophagitis. STUDY DESIGN: Irritable infants 
      (n=30) 3 to 12 months of age met the entry criteria of esophageal acid exposure
      >5% (n=22) and/or abnormal esophageal histology (n=15). They completed a 4-week, 
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial of omeprazole.
      Cry/fuss diary (minutes/24 hours) and a visual analogue scale of infant
      irritability as judged by parental impression were obtained at baseline and the
      end of each 2-week treatment period. RESULTS: The reflux index fell significantly
      during omeprazole treatment compared with placebo (-8.9%+/-5.6%, -1.9%+/-2.0%,
      P<.001). Cry/fuss time decreased from baseline (267+/-119), regardless of
      treatment sequence (period 1, 203+/-99, P<.04; period 2, 188+/-121, P<.008).
      Visual analogue score decreased from baseline to period 2 (6.8+/-1.6, 4.8+/-2.9, 
      P=.008). There was no significant difference for both outcome measures while
      taking either omeprazole or placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with placebo,
      omeprazole significantly reduced esophageal acid exposure but not irritability.
      Irritability improved with time, regardless of treatment.

TI  - Effect of the GABA(B) agonist baclofen in patients with symptoms and
      duodeno-gastro-oesophageal reflux refractory to proton pump inhibitors.
PG  - 1397-402
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A subset of patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease 
      (GORD) with refractory symptoms during therapy with proton pump inhibitors
      (PPIs), have persistent non-acid duodeno-gastro-oesophageal reflux (duodenal
      reflux). The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of the
      GABA(B) receptor agonist baclofen, which was shown to inhibit the occurrence of
      transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations (TLOSRs) in patients with
      persistent non-acid duodenal reflux during PPI therapy. METHODS: Patients were
      eligible for the study if they had persistent reflux symptoms, normal pH
      monitoring, and pathological Bilitec monitoring during PPI treatment. Upper
      gastrointestinal endoscopy and reflux symptom score were performed at the
      beginning of the study. Baclofen 5 mg three times daily was associated with
      treatment, and was increased by 5 mg every fourth day until a maintenance dose of
      20 mg three times daily was reached. A reflux symptom questionnaire, ambulatory
      pH monitoring, and Bilitec monitoring were repeated four days later while PPI and
      baclofen were continued. All data are given as mean (SEM) or median
      (interquartile range) and were compared using the Student's t test or the
      Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Sixteen patients (11 women, mean age 46 (3) years) 
      with persistent heartburn or regurgitation for at least three months, in spite of
      PPI therapy, were included in the study. Erosive oesophagitis was present in
      seven patients (five with grade 1, two with grade 2). Under PPI therapy alone,
      all patients had normal acid exposure (0.3 (0.05; 2.2)% of the time) but
      pathological duodenal reflux exposure (13.8 (11.8; 15.5)% of the time). After
      addition of baclofen 20 mg three times daily, acid exposure was similar (0.4
      (0.15; 2.3)% of the time; NS) but duodenal reflux had significantly decreased
      (6.1 (0.8; 10.3)% of the time; p<0.05). The number of duodenal reflux episodes
      and the number of longlasting duodenal reflux episodes (>5 minutes) was
      decreased, respectively, from 23 (14.5; 34) to 12 (5; 21) (p = 0.06) and from 5
      (3; 8) to 2 (0.5;4.5) (p<0.05). The cumulative severity score for 14 reflux
      symptoms decreased from 10.3 (1.7) to 5.8 (1.3) (p<0.01). Four patients reported 
      mild side effects of nausea or drowsiness. CONCLUSIONS: The GABA(B) receptor
      agonist baclofen improves duodenal reflux and associated reflux symptoms that
      persist during PPI therapy.

TI  - Meta-analysis: comparative efficacy of different proton-pump inhibitors in triple
      therapy for Helicobacter pylori eradication.
PG  - 647-54
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is not known whether certain proton-pump inhibitors are more
      efficacious than others when used in triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori
      eradication. AIM: To compare the efficacy of different proton-pump inhibitors in 
      triple therapy by performing a meta-analysis. METHODS: A MEDLINE search was
      performed. Abstracts of the European Helicobacter pylori Study Group and the
      American Gastroenterological Association congresses from 1996 to 2002 were also
      examined. Randomized studies with at least two branches of triple therapy that
      differed only in terms of type of proton-pump inhibitor were included in a
      meta-analysis using Review Manager 4.1. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included. 
      Intention-to-treat cure rates were similar for omeprazole and lansoprazole: 74.7%
      vs. 76%, odds ratio (OR) 0.91 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69-1.21] in a total
      of 1085 patients; for omeprazole and rabeprazole: 77.9% vs. 81.2%, OR 0.81 (95%
      CI 0.58-1.15) in a total of 825 patients; for omeprazole and esomeprazole: 87.7% 
      vs. 89%, OR 0.89 (95% CI 0.58-1.35) in 833 patients; and for lansoprazole and
      rabeprazole: 81% vs. 85.7%, OR 0.77 (95% CI 0.48-1.22) in 550 patients.
      CONCLUSION: The efficacy of various proton-pump inhibitors seems to be similar
      when used for H. pylori eradication in standard triple therapy.

TI  - Sequential treatment for Helicobacter pylori eradication in duodenal ulcer
      patients: improving the cost of pharmacotherapy.
PG  - 641-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have shown that Helicobacter pylori eradication rates
      with standard 7-day triple therapy are unsatisfactory. A novel 10-day sequential 
      treatment regimen recently achieved a significantly higher eradication rate. To
      improve the pharmacotherapeutic cost, we evaluated whether an acceptable
      eradication rate could be achieved in peptic ulcer patients by halving the dose
      of clarithromycin. METHODS: In a prospective, open-label study, 152 duodenal
      ulcer patients with H. pylori infection, assessed by rapid urease test and
      histology, were enrolled. Patients were randomized to receive either a 10-day
      sequential treatment comprising rabeprazole 20 mg b.d. plus amoxicillin 1 g b.d. 
      for the first 5 days, followed by rabeprazole 20 mg b.d., clarithromycin 500 mg
      b.d. and tinidazole 500 mg b.d. for the remaining 5 days (high-dose therapy), or 
      a similar schedule with the clarithromycin doses halved to 250 mg b.d. (low-dose 
      therapy). No further antisecretory drugs were offered. Four to six weeks after
      therapy, H. pylori eradication and ulcer healing rates were assessed by
      endoscopy. RESULTS: Similar H. pylori eradication rates were observed following
      high- and low-dose regimens for both per protocol (97.3% vs. 95.9%; P = N.S.) and
      intention-to-treat (94.7% vs. 92.2%; P = N.S.) analyses. No major side-effects
      were reported. At repeat endoscopy, peptic ulcer healing was observed in 93% and 
      93% of patients following high- and low-dose therapy, respectively. CONCLUSION:
      The cheaper low-dose sequential regimen may be suggested for H. pylori
      eradication in duodenal ulcer patients, even without continued proton pump
      inhibitor therapy after eradication treatment.

TI  - Once-daily pantoprazole 40 mg and esomeprazole 40 mg have equivalent overall
      efficacy in relieving GERD-related symptoms.
PG  - 587-94
AB  - AIM: To compare the efficacy of pantoprazole and esomeprazole for the treatment
      of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease- (GERD-) related symptoms. METHODS: In this 
      multicentre, randomized, double-blind study 217 patients [intention-to-treat
      (ITT) population] diagnosed with endoscopically proven GERD grade B/C received
      pantoprazole (40 mg once daily (o.d.), n = 112] or esomeprazole (40 mg o.d/, n = 
      105) for 4 weeks. Patients recorded GERD-related symptoms (daytime and
      night-time) using diaries (daily), and/or by telephone interviews (every third
      day) and completed the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS)
      questionnaire. The area under the time curve (AUC) for the sum score of
      GERD-related symptoms (symptom load of each patient during the treatment) and the
      time to reach adequate relief from GERD-related symptoms were calculated.
      RESULTS: Patients reported first adequate relief from daytime GERD-related
      symptoms after a mean of 3.7 (pantoprazole) and 5.9 days (esomeprazole) (P =
      0.034); the values for the night-time were 1.7 and 3.5 days, respectively (P =
      0.012, ITT). The AUCs for the single symptoms and the sum scores were comparable.
      CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with pantoprazole resulted in significantly faster
      first-time relief from daytime and night-time GERD-related symptoms than
      esomeprazole. Pantoprazole and esomeprazole were similar with respect to
      reduction of load of GERD-related symptoms.

      similar to oral dosing.
PG  - 581-6
AB  - AIM: To determine if nasogastric tube administration of the enteric-coated
      pellets from an opened esomeprazole capsule provides bioavailability similar to
      oral dosing with the intact capsule. METHODS: A randomized, single-centre,
      open-label, two-period crossover pharmacokinetic study consisting of two 5-day
      dosing periods separated by a 7- to 14-day washout period was conducted. Healthy 
      subjects between the ages of 18 and 50 years received esomeprazole 40 mg once
      daily either orally as an intact capsule, or as a suspension of the
      enteric-coated pellets from an opened capsule in water through a nasogastric
      tube. RESULTS: In 47 evaluable subjects, the 90% confidence intervals were
      0.87-1.08 and 0.93-1.25 for the geometric mean of the ratio of nasogastric tube
      administration relative to administration of the intact capsule for the area
      under the plasma concentration-time curve and for maximum plasma concentration,
      respectively, on day 1, demonstrating bioequivalence. Oral and nasogastric
      administration also demonstrated similar bioavailabilities on day 5. Esomeprazole
      was well tolerated regardless of the mode of administration. CONCLUSIONS:
      Nasogastric tube administration of the enteric-coated pellets from an opened
      esomeprazole 40 mg capsule provides bioavailability similar to oral dosing.
      Administration of the contents of an opened esomeprazole 40 mg capsule in water
      through a nasogastric tube is a practical alternative for patients with feeding
      tubes who require effective gastric acid suppression, but cannot swallow an oral 
      preparation.

TI  - Direct comparative trials of the efficacy of proton pump inhibitors in the
      management of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and peptic ulcer disease.
PG  - 559-68
AB  - BACKGROUND: Five proton pump inhibitors are now available for use in North
      America. Claims of differences in the clinical efficacy of different strengths
      and/or agents have been made. AIM: To identify any consistent evidence of
      differences in outcomes between agents or doses within this class of drugs.
      METHODS: A search of the medical literature was performed in two electronic
      databases, and randomized controlled trials of higher quality were included in
      the assessment. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Thirty-two trials met our criteria. No
      convincing data were found to indicate that low doses of proton pump inhibitors
      are as effective as standard doses of proton pump inhibitors in the healing of
      erosive oesophagitis or in the relief of symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux
      disease; however, they may be as effective as maintenance therapy for
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and peptic ulcer disease. Differences were
      found between the standard doses of proton pump inhibitors with regard to the
      onset of symptom relief in gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (lansoprazole was
      faster than omeprazole, and esomeprazole was faster than both lansoprazole and
      omeprazole) and the healing of oesophagitis (esomeprazole was superior to both
      omeprazole and lansoprazole). Despite these differences, there are as yet
      insufficient data to establish the superiority of any one agent over all others
      across all disease states treated with these agents.

      disease].
PG  - 1632-6
AB  - Although proton pump inhibitors and H2-receptor antagonists are usually
      prescribed for continuous use by patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease,
      at least 50% of such patients do not take their medication daily and some take it
      only sporadically. On-demand treatment with proton pump inhibitors or H2-receptor
      antagonists is safe and cost-effective. Indications are: (a) incidental reflux
      episodes of short duration, (b) periodic reflux lasting several weeks or months, 
      (c) chronic reflux not requiring continuous treatment. On-demand treatment is
      unsuitable for patients with reflux disease who either require daily medication
      or in whom the maximal dosage is insufficient. There are three types of on-demand
      treatment. Type 1: use of medication only in case of incidental symptoms. Type 2:
      continuous medication for 2-4 weeks when symptoms appear. Type 3: continuous use 
      because of chronic symptoms, but the interval between doses is determined by the 
      patient on the basis of his symptoms. All antacids can in principle be used for
      on-demand treatment; for type 3 treatment, antacids with a rapid onset of action 
      are preferred. A favourable response to the two weeks of initial therapy is a
      good predictor for successful on-demand treatment.

TI  - The effect of endoscopic therapy in patients receiving omeprazole for bleeding
      ulcers with nonbleeding visible vessels or adherent clots: a randomized
      comparison.
PG  - 237-43
AB  - BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment of ulcers with nonbleeding visible vessels and 
      adherent clots is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To compare intravenous omeprazole infusion 
      plus endoscopic therapy with intravenous omeprazole infusion alone for prevention
      of recurrent bleeding from ulcers with nonbleeding visible vessels or adherent
      clots. DESIGN: Single-blind randomized study with blinded evaluation of study end
      points. SETTING: An endoscopy center in a university hospital in Hong Kong.
      PATIENTS: 156 persons with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and ulcers showing
      nonbleeding visible vessels or adherent clots. INTERVENTION: Combination of
      endoscopic therapy and omeprazole infusion versus sham endoscopic therapy and
      omeprazole infusion. MEASUREMENTS: Recurrent ulcer bleeding before discharge and 
      within 30 days. RESULTS: 78 patients were recruited in each group. Ulcer bleeding
      recurred before discharge in seven patients who received intravenous omeprazole
      alone (9%) and no patients who received combined therapy (difference, 9
      percentage points [95% CI, 1.7 to 17.6 percentage points]; P = 0.01). The
      probability of recurrent bleeding within 30 days was 11.6% (9 patients) in the
      omeprazole-alone group and 1.1% (1 patient) in the combined therapy group
      (difference, 10.5 percentage points [CI, 1.7 to 19.8 percentage points]; P =
      0.009). Patients in the combined therapy group required less transfusion
      (difference in median units of blood transfused, 1 unit [CI, 0 to 2 units]; P =
      0.02). One patient in the combined therapy group had surgery for ulcer
      perforation. Four patients receiving omeprazole alone (5.1%) and two patients
      receiving combined therapy (2.6%) died within 30 days. CONCLUSION: The
      combination of endoscopic therapy and omeprazole infusion is superior to
      omeprazole infusion alone for preventing recurrent bleeding from ulcers with
      nonbleeding visible vessels and adherent clots.

TI  - Comparison of four-day and seven-day pantoprazole-based quadruple therapy as a
      routine treatment for Helicobacter pylori infection.
PG  - 218-22
AB  - BACKGROUND: H. pylori eradication is usually performed with three or four drugs
      for at least seven days. Recently four reports have shown a cure rate of
      approximately 90% using a four-day quadruple therapy. The objectives of this
      prospective study were: 1) to evaluate the efficacy of pantoprazole-based
      quadruple therapy, and 2) to compare the efficacy and tolerability of four-day
      with seven-day quadruple therapy. METHODS: The study was performed in a single
      centre. The first 56 consecutive patients with nonulcer dyspepsia or peptic ulcer
      disease and proven H. pylori infection received seven days of quadruple therapy
      (pantoprazole, bismuth, tetracycline and metronidazole). At least six weeks after
      treatment, endoscopy was repeated with six biopsies of the antrum and corpus for 
      histology, urease test and culture. The next 59 consecutive patients followed the
      same protocol but received four-day quadruple therapy. RESULTS: Using an
      intention-to-treat analysis, the cure rate in the seven-day treatment group was
      54/56 (96.4%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 87.7-99.6%). In the per protocol
      analysis the cure rate was 53/55 (96.3%, 95% CI 87.5-99.6%). Primary
      metronidazole resistance was observed in seven patients. All were cured. Using an
      intention-to-treat analysis, the cure rate in the four-day treatment group was
      51/59 (86.4%, 95% CI 75.0-94.0%). In the per protocol analysis the cure rate was 
      50/58 (86.2%, 95% CI 74.6-93.8%). Primary metronidazole resistance was observed
      in seven patients, four of whom were cured. In three out of eight patients in
      whom four-day treatment failed, secondary metronidazole resistance was induced.
      Both treatment regimens were well tolerated. The difference between cure rates of
      both regimens did not reach statistical significance (p=0.0585). CONCLUSION:
      Routine use of both four-day and seven-day pantoprazole-based quadruple anti-H.
      pylori treatment is effective and well tolerated. The results of both regimens
      reach the required eradication standard, but results with the seven-day regimen
      were slightly but not significantly better. Seven-day treatment may be superior, 
      especially in case of metronidazole resistance, and should be preferred.

TI  - Omeprazole disposition in children following single-dose administration.
PG  - 840-8
AB  - Omeprazole is frequently used to treat gastroesophageal reflux in infants and
      children despite the lack of age-specific pharmacokinetic and dosing information 
      in the approved product labeling. To address this challenge, the authors examined
      the potential influence of development and cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19)
      genotype on omeprazole disposition by conducting two pharmacokinetic (PK) studies
      in children and adolescents (ages 2-16 years) after a single oral 10- or 20-mg
      dose of the drug. Plasma omeprazole concentrations were determined by HPLC-MS
      from seven plasma samples obtained over a 6-hour postdose period. Pharmacokinetic
      parameters were determined by noncompartmental methods. Subjects were genotyped
      for CYP2C19 by PCR-RFLP. Data were available from 37 patients (19 female), 10 of 
      whom were < or = 5 years of age. No drug-associated adverse events were observed.
      The numbers of functional CYP2C19 alleles per subject in the cohort were 2 (n =
      25), 1 (n = 11), and 0 (n = 1). Pharmacokinetic parameters (mean +/- SD, range)
      were as follows: tmax (2.1 +/- 1.2, 1-6 h), Cmax (331.1 +/- 333.6, 20.8-885.8
      ng/mL), AUC0-->infinity (809.5 +/- 893.8, 236.9-1330.9 ng/mL.h), t1/2 (0.98 +/-
      0.22, 0.7-1.4 h), and CL/F (1.8 +/- 1.4, 0.3-5.8 L/h/kg). Comparison of mean
      AUC0-->infinity values normalized for dose (i.e., per 1 mg/kg) between subjects
      with one versus two functional CYP2C19 alleles revealed no statistically
      significant difference. In addition, the CL/F and apparent elimination rate
      constant (lambda z) for omeprazole were not significantly different for subjects 
      with one versus two functional CYP2C19 alleles. No association between age and
      CL/F, t1/2, or lambda z was observed. The range of t1/2 values for omeprazole was
      similar to those reported in adults (1-1.5 h). CONCLUSIONS: (1) in children ages 
      2 to 16 years receiving 10 or 20 mg of omeprazole as a single oral dose, the PK
      are quite comparable to values reported for adults, and (2) in pediatric patients
      who are CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers, there was no association between genotype
      and the pharmacokinetics of omeprazole.

TI  - Improvement of gastroesophageal reflux symptoms after radiofrequency energy: a
      randomized, sham-controlled trial.
PG  - 668-76
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Gastroesophageal reflux disease is a prevalent disorder that
      often requires long-term medical therapy or surgery. The United States Food and
      Drug Administration recently cleared new endoluminal gastroesophageal reflux
      disease treatments; however, no controlled trials exist. METHODS: We randomly
      assigned 64 gastroesophageal reflux disease patients to radiofrequency energy
      delivery to the gastroesophageal junction (35 patients) or to a sham procedure
      (29 patients). Principal outcomes were reflux symptoms and quality of life.
      Secondary outcomes were medication use and esophageal acid exposure. After 6
      months, interested sham patients crossed over to active treatment. RESULTS: At 6 
      months, active treatment significantly and substantially improved patients'
      heartburn symptoms and quality of life. More active vs. sham patients were
      without daily heartburn symptoms (n = 19 [61%] vs. n = 7 [33%]; P = 0.05), and
      more had a >50% improvement in their gastroesophageal reflux disease quality of
      life score (n = 19 [61%] vs. n = 6 [30%]; P = 0.03). Symptom improvements
      persisted at 12 months after treatment. At 6 months, there were no differences in
      daily medication use after a medication withdrawal protocol (n = 17 [55%] vs. n =
      14 [61%]; P = 0.67) or in esophageal acid exposure times. There were no
      perforations or deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Radiofrequency energy delivery significantly
      improved gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms and quality of life compared
      with a sham procedure, but it did not decrease esophageal acid exposure or
      medication use at 6 months. This procedure represents a new option for selected
      symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease patients who are intolerant of, or
      desire an alternative to, traditional medical therapies.

TI  - A review of the clinical and economic impact of using esomeprazole or
      lansoprazole for the treatment of erosive esophagitis.
PG  - 2088-101
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for the treatment of erosive
      esophagitis has had a major impact on the prescribing budgets of primary care
      organizations in the United Kingdom. Assessments of the clinical and economic
      effectiveness of PPIs would provide useful tools for decision-making. OBJECTIVE: 
      The goal of this study was to review the available preclinical and clinical
      studies comparing esomeprazole with lansoprazole in the healing and maintenance
      of erosive esophagitis, and to compare the budgeting impact of the 2 strategies. 
      Comparative tolerability was also reviewed. METHODS: MEDLINE (1966-September
      2002) and EMBASE (1980-September 2002) were searched for abstracts and articles
      reporting comparative studies of esomeprazole and lansoprazole. The search terms 
      used were gastroesophageal reflux disease, reflux esophagitis, and proton pump
      inhibitor; all comparisons of esomeprazole and lansoprazole at any dose were
      considered. The database search was supplemented based on the authors'
      familiarity with the literature. RESULTS: The comparative studies that were
      identified fell into 4 categories: (1) intragastric acid suppression studies; (2)
      randomized controlled trials in the healing of erosive esophagitis; (3)
      randomized controlled trials in the maintenance of erosive esophagitis; and (4)
      health economic analyses. Based on these studies, when healing doses
      (esomeprazole 40 mg once daily, lansoprazole 30 mg once daily) and low doses (20 
      and 15 mg once daily, respectively) were compared, esomeprazole was more
      efficacious than lansoprazole in suppressing acid in the intragastric compartment
      (both comparisons, P < 0.05). More patients with erosive esophagitis experienced 
      healing at 4 and 8 weeks with esomeprazole 40 mg once daily than with
      lansoprazole 30 mg once daily (P < 0.001 at 4 and 8 weeks). At 6 months,
      remission was maintained in more patients receiving esomeprazole 20 mg once daily
      than in those receiving lansoprazole 15 mg once daily (P < 0.001). No significant
      differences in tolerability were noted in clinical trials that directly compared 
      the 2 PPIs. When the cost-effectiveness of esomeprazole treatment was compared
      with that of lansoprazole treatment in the healing and maintenance of erosive
      esophagitis, the greater efficacy of esomeprazole translated into potential cost 
      savings and better outcomes. CONCLUSION: The currently available comparative data
      for esomeprazole and lansoprazole indicate clinical and cost-effectiveness
      advantages for esomeprazole in the healing and maintenance of erosive esophagitis
      compared with lansoprazole.

TI  - Recurrent duodenal ulcer haemorrhage: a pharmacoeconomic comparison of various
      management strategies.
PG  - 1593-603
AB  - BACKGROUND: Duodenal ulcer (DU) bleeding has a 7 - 13% mortality rate and
      bleeding often recurs. Prevention of recurrence is, therefore, an important goal.
      Eradication of Helicobacter pylori or maintenance treatment with a proton pump
      inhibitor (PPI) may reduce recurrent DU bleeding. Economic comparison of these
      options is sparse. METHODS: After the control of index bleeding with endotherapy 
      and drugs, three strategies were evaluated: empirical treatment for possible H.
      pylori infection followed by a PPI for 2 months; test for H. pylori, eradication 
      if positive, maintenance PPI if negative; maintenance PPI alone. Probability and 
      direct cost data were obtained from a Medline search and Indian hospitals,
      respectively. Cost-minimisation, cost-utility, one- and two-way sensitivity
      analyses and threshold values were evaluated. RESULTS: Treatment of H. pylori,
      particularly empirical, was the preferred strategy and dominated maintenance
      treatment with PPI. The test-and-treat strategy was better than the empirical
      treatment strategy only when the probabilities of H. pylori eradication, ulcer
      healing following eradication and of frequency of H. pylori infection in bleeding
      DU were less than 58, 73 and 58%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Eradication of H.
      pylori is preferred in preventing recurrent bleeding from DU.

TI  - Effects of rebamipide, a gastro-protective drug on the Helicobacter pylori status
      and inflammation in the gastric mucosa of patients with gastric ulcer: a
      randomized double-blind placebo-controlled multicentre trial.
PG  - 146-52
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the effects of rebamipide on the Helicobacter pylori
      eradication rate with amoxicillin and omeprazole. The trial also examined its
      histological effects on gastro-mucosal inflammation after eradication. METHODS:
      Two hundred and six H. pylori-positive patients with active gastric ulcer
      underwent 8-week based therapy (OA) consisting of 2-week amoxicillin with
      omeprazole and subsequent 6-week omeprazole. They randomly received either
      rebamipide (OA-R) or placebo (OA-P) for 16 weeks: combined with the OA based
      therapy, and subsequently for another 8 weeks. Besides eradication rate,
      inflammatory findings of gastric mucosa after eradication were evaluated
      histologically. RESULTS: Per Protocol Set analysis showed no significant
      difference in eradication rate between OA-R (64.6%; 95% confidence interval,
      54.3-75.0%) and OA-P (67.9%; 95% CI, 57.6-78.3%). Histological findings in the
      gastric mucosa of the ulcer region, however, indicated a significant improvement 
      (P = 0.017) in inflammation scores in OA-R (1.84 +/- 0.41) compared with that in 
      OA-P (2.02 +/- 0.39) after 16-weeks of treatment. This suppressive effect on
      inflammation was observed even in the OA-R patients unsuccessfully eradicated.
      CONCLUSION: Rebamipide demonstrated a suppressive effect on the persistent and
      possibly chronic inflammation in the gastric mucosa of the ulcer region after
      eradication, but the drug did not improve the eradication rate.

TI  - The pathogenesis of Barrett's esophagus.
PG  - 233-55
AB  - Significant progress has been made in clinicians' understanding of the molecular 
      pathogenesis of BE, and the laboratory findings are beginning to lead to
      hypothesis-driven clinical studies; however, the following questions remain
      unanswered: (1) how can clinicians identify the persons most at risk for the
      development of esophageal adenocarcinoma, (2) what are the environmental gene
      interactions in esophageal carcinogenesis, and (3) can clinicians prevent the
      development of esophageal adenocarcinoma in the population at risk? As esophageal
      adenocarcinoma starts to reach epidemic proportions, further research in these
      areas is urgently required. With the advent of the genomic era and an explosion
      in studies in BE, significant progress can be made.

TI  - Treatment and prevention of aspirin-induced gastroduodenal ulcers and
      gastrointestinal bleeding.
PG  - 245-52
AB  - Aspirin use is associated with gastroduodenal mucosal damage and increased risk
      of upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Many aspirin users should receive
      prophylactic treatment since they often have several risk factors for upper GI
      complications. The best therapeutic approach for reducing GI toxicity in low-dose
      aspirin users is still ill-defined as only a few studies have focused on this
      problem. Omeprazole appears to be very effective in reducing both acute
      gastroduodenal mucosal damage and upper GI bleeding in the high-risk patient
      taking low-dose aspirin, but data with other anti-ulcer agents are lacking
      (misoprostol) or inconsistent (ranitidine) at present. The role of Helicobacter
      pylori is controversial in NSAID users, but there is now wide agreement that H.
      pylori infection increases mucosal damage and the risk of upper GI bleeding in
      low-dose aspirin users.

TI  - Assessment of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) damage in the human
      gastrointestinal tract.
PG  - 146-55
AB  - Aspirin is widely prescribed and confers considerable benefit to patients by
      reducing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality. Nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are effective analgesics, antipyretics and
      reduce the inflammatory component in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis.
      However, both agents are associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal
      symptoms and the potentially serious consequences of gastroduodenal ulceration,
      bleeding and perforation. The introduction of highly selective cyclo-oxygenase
      (COX)-2 inhibitors or the coprescription gastroprotective agents with
      nonselective NSAIDs have offered strategies to reduce the incidence of such
      events. This review article analyzes the quantitative techniques that can be
      employed by clinical pharmacologists and the clinical studies performed to assess
      NSAID damage in the gastrointestinal tract.

TI  - The effects of cognitive impairment on mortality among hospitalized patients with
      heart failure.
PG  - 97-103
AB  - PURPOSE: Cognitive impairment is a common, potentially reversible condition among
      older patients with heart failure. Because cerebral metabolic abnormalities have 
      been associated with reduced survival in younger patients with advanced heart
      failure, we assessed the effect of cognitive impairment on the survival of older 
      patients with heart failure. METHODS: The association between cognitive
      dysfunction and in-hospital mortality was assessed in 1113 patients (mean [+/-
      SD] age, 78 +/- 9 years) who had been admitted for heart failure to 81 hospitals 
      throughout Italy. One-year mortality was assessed in 968 patients with heart
      failure (age, 76 +/- 10 years) participating in the same study. Cognitive
      impairment was defined as a Hodkinson Abbreviated Mental Test score <7. RESULTS: 
      In-hospital death occurred in 65 (18%) of the 357 participants with cognitive
      impairment and in 26 (3%) of the 756 patients with normal cognition (P <0.0001). 
      Out-of-hospital mortality was 27% (51/191) among patients with cognitive
      impairment and 15% (115/777) among other participants (P <0.0001). In
      multivariate Cox regression models, decreasing levels of cognitive functioning
      were associated with increasing in-hospital mortality; cognitive impairment was
      associated with an almost fivefold increase in mortality (relative risk = 4.9;
      95% confidence interval: 2.9 to 8.3) after adjusting for several potential
      confounders. CONCLUSION: Cognitive impairment is an independent prognostic marker
      in older patients with heart failure. Assessment of cognitive functioning, even
      by simple screening tests, should be part of the routine assessment of elderly
      patients with heart failure.

TI  - Low frequency of upper gastrointestinal complications in a cohort of high-risk
      patients taking low-dose aspirin or NSAIDS and omeprazole.
PG  - 693-700
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is very little information available on the incidence of
      complications and on the best prevention therapy in high-risk patients taking
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or aspirin.
      Randomized-controlled trials in such patients are rare for ethical reasons. We
      studied the incidence of gastrointestinal complications in high-risk patients
      taking long-term low-dose aspirin or non-aspirin-NSAIDs combined with omeprazole 
      in a real-life clinical setting. METHODS: This was a multicentre, prospective and
      observational study including 247 consecutive high-risk patients who had a
      clinical indication for long-term treatment with either low-dose aspirin or
      non-aspirin NSAIDs and omeprazole therapy. The occurrence of gastrointestinal
      complications was measured. RESULTS: In addition to a recent history of peptic
      ulcer bleeding, all patients had at least 1 other risk factor and 112 (45.3%) had
      3 or more risk factors; 78.9% were taking low-dose aspirin and the remainder
      non-aspirin NSAIDs. Mean follow-up was 14.6 +/- 10.38 months. Three patients
      taking low-dose aspirin developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding (1.2%; 95% CI
      0.3-3.5; 1.0 event/100 patients/year). This was similar to the rate observed in
      studies involving non-high-risk patients taking low-dose aspirin and higher than 
      that observed in patients not taking low-dose aspirin. Two additional patients
      developed a lower gastrointestinal bleeding event (0.81% (0.04%-3.12%); 0.67
      events/100 patients/year), which was within the range expected in NSAID users.
      CONCLUSIONS: The use of omeprazole in the high-risk patient taking low-dose
      aspirin or NSAIDs seems to be a safe therapeutic approach in this population and 
      is associated with a low frequency of upper gastrointestinal complications.

TI  - [Treatment strategies for gastroesophageal reflux disease].
PG  - 617-24; discussion 624-5
AB  - Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a very common disorder. Therapeutic
      options include lifestyle modifications, medical therapy, laparoscopic antireflux
      surgery, and three more recent options-injection therapy to the lower esophageal 
      sphincter, endoscopic sewing procedures, and radio frequency ablation therapy.
      Medical therapy is effective in most patients but not always successful with
      advanced disease. Up to 70% of subjects do not have adequate nocturnal control of
      gastric acid secretion with 20 mg of omeprazole given twice per day. Patients who
      do not tolerate medical therapy, who respond inadequately, or who want to avoid
      life-long drug therapy are candidates for alternate treatments. Studies on
      endoscopic procedures such as polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) injection, the
      Stretta procedure,and endoscopic suturing techniques all suffer from having small
      study groups for each procedure,unknown durability, short follow-up, and the
      absence of randomized, controlled procedures. Limitations on endoscopic
      techniques are esophageal motility disorders, severe esophagitis, and larger
      hiatal hernias. Laparoscopic antireflux surgery remains a well-established,
      durable alternative to long-term medical therapy. It has the benefits of
      convenience, safety, minimal complications, improved quality of life, and low
      cost. Alternative methods will have to earn their place against this gold
      standard.

TI  - 13C-urea breath test, referral patterns, and results in children.
PG  - 142-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: The family is the core unit for Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection.
      In most instances, Hp colonization occurs in early childhood, and correlates with
      socioeconomic parameters. Helicobacter pylori infection is highly prevalent in
      many countries, and may cause chronic gastritis and peptic ulcer in adults and in
      children. Gastritis induced by Hp may be associated with recurrent abdominal pain
      in children, and eradication of the bacterium may improve the clinical symptoms. 
      AIM The primary aim of this study is to characterize the group of pediatric
      patients according to the referral patterns and results of 13C-urea breath test
      (13C -UBT) in our laboratory. The secondary aim is to investigate the result of
      different treatment combinations for Hp eradication. METHODS: The 13C-UBT was
      performed with 75 mg urea labeled with 13C in 200 mL orange juice. Breath samples
      were collected at 0 and 30 minutes, and the results expressed as the change in
      the 13C/12C ratio at T30' minus T0' The cutoff for Hp eradication was 3.5. The
      physicians who ordered the test completed a questionnaire covering demographic
      data (age, gender, and origin), indication for the test was use of a proton pump 
      inhibitor (PPI), and type of combination eradication therapy. RESULTS: The study 
      sample consisted of 1655 children, aged 1 to 18 years, 992 (59.9%) boys and 663
      (40.1%) girls, from all parts of the country. The 13C-UBT was positive in 763
      (46.1%). The prevalence of positive results was directly correlated with age.
      History of peptic disease was the main indication for the test, in 1346 (81.4%)
      cases. Details on eradication therapy were available for 435 children of whom
      42.5% had a positive 13C-UBT, indicating a successful eradication rate of 57.5%. 
      Compared with Israeli and American-European origin, children of Asian-African
      origin had a higher rate of referrals for reason of validation of successful Hp
      eradication, greater long-term PPI use, and a higher rate of 13C-UBT positivity. 
      No significant difference was demonstrated between the triple therapy regimens
      used. CONCLUSION: 13C-UBT may be performed in children of all age groups. The
      main indication is a history of peptic ulcer disease. The prevalence of Hp
      infection increased with age and the only factor associated with increased Hp
      infection was Asian-African origin. The most frequent eradication therapy used in
      children is a combination of omeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin.

TI  - Pantoprazole rapidly improves health-related quality of life in patients with
      heartburn: a prospective, randomized, double blind comparative study with
      nizatidine.
PG  - 132-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is impaired in untreated
      patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). In the absence of an
      objective marker such as erosions, assessment of treatment efficacy can be based 
      on symptoms and HRQoL. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate changes in HRQoL during treatment
      with pantoprazole or nizatidine in patients with GERD. METHODS: This was a
      prospective, randomized, double blind Canadian multicenter study. Patients with
      GERD, characterized by heartburn that had occurred 4 or more times per week for
      at least 6 months, were treated for 28 days with either pantoprazole 40 mg once
      daily or nizatidine 150 mg twice daily. HRQoL assessment was performed before
      endoscopy (baseline) and on days 7 and 28 after treatment. HRQoL was assessed
      using 4 domains of the SF-36, the SF-12 summary scales and the gastrointestinal
      system rating scale (GSRS). RESULTS: A total of 208 patients (n = 106
      pantoprazole treatment group, n = 102 nizatidine treatment group) was available
      for intention-to-treat analysis. Baseline HRQoL scores were comparable between
      the 2 treatment groups. After 7 days, treatment with pantoprazole led to a
      statistically significant greater improvement in HRQoL in 2 SF-36 domains: bodily
      pain (pantoprazole versus nizatidine, P = 0.0088) and vitality (pantoprazole
      versus nizatidine, P = 0.0137), and in the GSRS reflux score (pantoprazole versus
      nizatidine, P = 0.0078). After 28 days of treatment, the changes in scores
      relative to baseline were still greater with pantoprazole than with nizatidine.
      The improvement in the 4 SF-36 domains and the GSRS reflux score achieved by
      pantoprazole after 7 days were also significantly greater than those achieved by 
      nizatidine after 28 days. CONCLUSIONS: HRQoL improves more rapidly and to a
      greater degree following treatment with pantoprazole than nizatidine. Control of 
      heartburn strongly predicts HRQoL improvement during the acute treatment of GERD.
      Our data support the approach to use pantoprazole instead of nizatidine as the
      initial therapy for patients with heartburn in a primary care practice setting.

TI  - Economic analysis of celecoxib versus diclofenac plus omeprazole for the
      treatment of arthritis in patients at risk of ulcer disease.
PG  - 217-22
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the economic impact of celecoxib therapy vs. diclofenac plus
      omeprazole therapy for the treatment of arthritis in Chinese patients with a high
      risk of bleeding, from the perspective of a public health organization in Hong
      Kong. METHODS: The medical records of 287 Chinese arthritic patients with a
      history of bleeding ulcers who had previously participated in a randomised study 
      of celecoxib 200 mg twice daily and extended-release diclofenac 75 mg twice daily
      plus 20 mg of omeprazole daily for 6 months were reviewed. RESULTS: Compared to
      the diclofenac plus omeprazole group, the average total direct cost per patient
      in the celecoxib group showed a significant reduction of 11%, from HK 10,915
      (range HK dollars 10,915-57,899) to HK dollars 9714 (range HK dollars
      9714-89,770) (P<0.0001) (1 US dollars=7.8 HK dollars). The median direct medical 
      cost for routine management in the celecoxib group was significantly lower (11%) 
      than that for the diclofenac plus omeprazole group [HK dollars 10,915 (range
      10,915-28,048) vs. HK dollars 9714 (range HK dollars 6946-26,179) (P<0.0001)]. In
      patients who experienced recurrent bleeding, the celecoxib group showed a
      significantly higher median cost of management of recurrent bleeding than the
      diclofenac plus omeprazole group [HK dollars 8466 (range 572-29,851) vs. HK
      dollars 23,210 (range HK dollars 12,318-65,823)] (P=0.036). CONCLUSIONS:
      Celecoxib therapy appears to cost less compared with diclofenac plus omeprazole
      for treatment of arthritis in Chinese patients with a high risk of bleeding.

TI  - Approach to treatment of dyspepsia in primary care: a randomized trial comparing 
      "test-and-treat" with prompt endoscopy.
PG  - 1606-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: The value of the "test-and-treat" strategy in the approach to
      dyspepsia has been evaluated only in a few secondary care studies. Most patients 
      with dyspepsia, however, are treated by their primary care physician. This study 
      evaluated the test-and-treat strategy in primary care. METHODS: Patients
      consulting their general practitioners for dyspepsia were randomized to either
      direct open-access endoscopy with Helicobacter pylori testing or a test-and-treat
      strategy by H pylori serology. In the 12-month follow-up period, any additional
      treatment or referral for investigations was left at the discretion of the
      general practitioner. At the end of the study, data were collected concerning the
      number of endoscopies, changes in symptom severity and quality of life, patient
      satisfaction, and the use of medical resources. RESULTS: Two hundred seventy
      patients were enrolled (129 who received endoscopy and 141 in the test-and-treat 
      group). The prevalence of H pylori infection was 38.3% and 37.2% in the
      test-and-treat and endoscopy groups, respectively. In the test-and-treat group,
      46 patients (33%) were referred for endoscopy during follow-up. Improvement in
      symptom severity, quality of life, and patient satisfaction was comparable in
      both groups. Patients in the test-and-treat group paid more dyspepsia-related
      visits to their general practitioner (P =.005). Patients in the endoscopy group
      were more often prescribed proton pump inhibitors (P =.007), whereas patients in 
      the test-and-treat group were more often prescribed prokinetic drugs (P =.005).
      CONCLUSIONS: The test-and-treat strategy proved to be as effective and safe as
      prompt endoscopy. Only a minority of patients were referred for endoscopy after
      the test-and-treat approach.

TI  - The impact of treatment for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease on health-related
      quality of life: a literature review.
PG  - 769-90
AB  - Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is common in the general population and 
      is diagnosed based on patient-reported symptoms and clinical tests. Although
      clinical tests are available, significant percentages of patients report symptoms
      of heartburn and reflux despite negative endoscopies, and 24-hour pH tests are
      not often used by primary-care physicians in diagnosis. Consequently,
      patient-reported symptoms and health-related QOL (HR-QOL) are important in
      assessing treatment outcome. HR-QOL is significantly impaired in patients with
      GORD, and HR-QOL is associated with symptom severity and changes in GORD-related 
      symptoms. The objective of this literature review is to examine the impact of
      pharmacological treatment on HR-QOL in patients with GORD. Generic and
      disease-specific HR-QOL measures have been used in clinical trials to evaluate
      the impact of GORD on patient functioning and well-being. The Psychological
      General Well-Being (PGWB) Index and the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) 
      have been used in several clinical trials of treatment for GORD and have
      consistently shown that HR-QOL improves with successful therapy. These trials
      have been conducted primarily with two pharmacological agents, omeprazole and
      ranitidine. On the Heartburn-specific Quality of Life questionnaire, patients
      treated with ranitidine reported better HR-QOL after treatment compared with
      placebo therapy. In two clinical trials where omeprazole and ranitidine were
      compared, patients treated with omeprazole reported significantly better HR-QOL
      (based on the PGWB Index) than those treated with ranitidine; however, 2 other
      trials did not detect significant differences between the treatments. Results
      from clinical trials using disease-specific measures (Gastrointestinal Quality of
      Life Index [GIQLI] and Heartburn-specific Quality of Life questionnaire)
      demonstrate similar findings, supporting the association between
      treatment-related symptom resolution and improvements in HR-QOL. The GIQLI was
      used in a trial comparing pantoprazole and ranitidine, where results favoured
      pantoprazole therapy. Several studies have demonstrated that resolution of GORD
      symptoms is associated with improvement in HR-QOL. Although there is evidence
      that treatment for GORD does improve symptoms and HR-QOL outcomes, further
      research is needed to more completely understand the value of medical therapy for
      GORD.

TI  - [Four different treatment protocols for Helicobacter pylori infection--a clinical
      pilot study].
PG  - 151-6
AB  - A pilot clinical trial specially designed to test four different treatment
      regimens of Helicobacter pylori infection was performed among hospitalized and
      outpatient based patients in Clinical Centre University of Sarajevo,
      Gastroenterohepatology Clinics. Another objective was to assess Helicobacter
      pylori total cradication rates, partial cradication rates and after treatment
      persistent Helicobacter pylori infection rates among patients with clinically
      proven peptic ulcer disease (PUS). All patients randomly assigned into four
      groups had endoscopically and Helicourcasa test (HUT Astra) proven peptic ulcers.
      Each group was treated with one of the following four triple regimens: ranitidine
      + amoxicillin + metronidazole (RAM); ranitidine + clarithromycin + metronidazole 
      (RCM); omeprazole + amoxicillin + metronidazole (OAM) and omeprazole +
      clarithromycin + m etronidazole (OCM). All triple regimens were given twice-a-day
      for one week following either ranitidine or omeprazole for two weeks depending of
      basic regimens. The highest Helicobacter pylori eradication was produced with OCM
      regimens (91.7%). Using same regimens we found the lowest partial eradication
      rate of all regimens (8.3%) and no persistency of H. pylori after the treatment. 
      The lowest total eradication rate was found using RCM regimens (67.7%), while
      there was no difference in the cure rate between OAM (76.9%) and RAM (77.3%)
      regimens. If it is applicable, recommended treatment regimen as a first choice
      for proven H. pylori infection is OCM.

TI  - Functional dyspepsia: evaluation and treatment.
PG  - 577-99
AB  - Functional dyspepsia is one of the most common disorders seen in general practice
      and by gastroenterologists. New concepts regarding the pathophysiology and its
      role for the symptom pattern have emerged during the last few years. This is of
      importance for development of new treatment alternatives in the near future. At
      the moment, however, empirical treatment with acid-suppressive agents and
      prokinetics is the recommended therapeutic approach in the management of these
      patients, despite limited efficacy. Identification and treatment of H pylori
      infection has been recommended for uninvestigated dyspepsia, because it may cure 
      underlying peptic ulcer disease, but is unlikely to provide symptomatic benefit
      to patients with functional dyspepsia. Refractory patients may respond to
      antidepressants or to psychologic treatments, but proof of efficacy is limited.
      New and more effective approaches are badly needed for functional dyspepsia.

TI  - Noncardiac chest pain: evaluation and treatment.
PG  - 531-52
AB  - Noncardiac chest pain is a heterogeneous condition for which diagnosis and
      treatment are challenging. Research is needed to streamline evaluation to
      minimize unnecessary invasive testing and costs. Chest pain clinics to assess
      chest pain patients are popular in the United States and may be of value in
      reassuring patients and reducing presentation to hospital; however, recently this
      has been contended [111]. Options for the effective treatment of NCCP are
      dependent on the risk of an adverse outcome and the cost-effectiveness of the
      management algorithm that is followed. Most (64%) of those presenting to the
      emergency department with chest pain are classified as having NCCP [112,113].
      GERD is probably the most important cause and application of a test of acid
      suppression with a high-dose PPI for 1 to 2 weeks seems to be a useful diagnostic
      tool. In those patients with GERD-related NCCP, short-term and potentially
      long-term therapy with a PPI (commonly higher than standard dose) is required to 
      alleviate symptoms. Esophageal dysmotility is relatively uncommon in patients
      with NCCP and evaluation by esophageal manometry might be limited to rule out
      achalasia. Chest wall syndromes are common but probably often missed. Many
      patients with NCCP have psychologic or psychiatric abnormalities, as either the
      cause or an effect of the chest pain, but diagnosis here depends on techniques
      not applied easily in the acute situation. Pain modulators seem to offer
      significant improvement in chest pain symptoms for non-GERD-related NCCP.
      Finally, trials of management strategies to deal with this problem are required
      urgently, because the earlier discharge of patients with NCCP may exacerbate the 
      problem. Fig. 2 provides a flow chart for diagnosis and treatment of NCCP.

TI  - Density of Helicobacter pylori may affect the efficacy of eradication therapy and
      ulcer healing in patients with active duodenal ulcers.
PG  - 1537-40
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the association of pre-treatment Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)
      density with bacterial eradication and ulcer healing rates in patients with
      active duodenal ulcer. METHODS: One hundred and four consecutive duodenal ulcer
      outpatients with H. pylori infection ascertained by gastric histopathology and
      (13)C-urea breath test (UBT) were enrolled in this study. H. pylori density was
      graded histologically according to the Sydney system (normal, mild, moderate, and
      marked). In each patient, lansoprazole (30 mg b.i.d.), clarithromycin (500 mg
      b.i.d.) and amoxicillin (1 g b.i.d.) were used for 1 week, then 30 mg
      lansoprazole once daily was continued for an additional 3 weeks. Follow-up
      endoscopy was performed at 4 weeks after completion of the therapy, and UBT was
      done at 4 and 8 weeks after completion of the therapy. RESULTS: The H. pylori
      eradication rates were 88.9 %/100.0 %, 94.3 %/100.0 %, and 69.7 %/85.2 %; and the
      ulcer healing rates were 88.9 %/100.0 %, 94.3 %/100.0 %, and 63.6 %/77.8 %
      (intention-to-treat/per protocol analysis) in the mild, moderate, and marked H.
      pylori density groups, respectively. The association of pretreatment H. pylori
      density with the eradication rate and ulcer healing rate was both statistically
      significant (P=0.013/0.006 and 0.002/<0.001, respectively; using results of
      intention-to-treat/per protocol analysis). CONCLUSION: Intragastric bacterial
      load may affect both the outcome of eradication treatment and ulcer healing in
      patients with active duodenal ulcer disease.

TI  - GERD 2003 -- a consensus on the way ahead.
PG  - 111-7
AB  - Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) has in recent times become an important
      public health issue owing to the considerable health care resources utilized in
      its management, its deleterious effect on quality of life and the increasing
      prevalence of a relatively rare complication of reflux disease - esophageal
      adenocarcinoma. We review here the major current challenges in the field of
      reflux disease and its complications, and provide some approaches that may be
      useful in management. The issues to be faced include the very limited
      comprehension of the reasons behind the increasing prevalence of the disease,
      difficulties in correlating symptoms with objective data of pathological
      gastroesophageal reflux and the relatively unsophisticated tools we are employing
      to investigate the underlying pathophysiology. It is certain that the lack of
      well-defined and characterized methodologies to compare the effects of therapy
      require the development of more effective questionnaire-type analytic tools. In
      regard to treatment, there is little doubt that the widely prescribed proton pump
      inhibitors have dose-equivalent efficacy and are the most highly effective agents
      capable of suppressing acid, controlling many of the symptoms of GERD and healing
      erosions. Nevertheless, many patients continue to experience symptoms on
      withdrawal or at night. Pharmacological agents that can effectively increase
      lower esophageal sphincter pressure or promote motility are as yet unavailable.
      Although the introduction of laparoscopic techniques has resulted in a modest
      revival in surgical intervention using a variety of 'wrap-type' operations, the
      indications are few and the procedure is associated with a significant morbidity 
      and even mortality especially if the expertise of the surgeon is an issue.
      Endoscopic techniques of regulating reflux are at this time experimental and not 
      applicable to the general population. Intestinal metaplasia in the lower
      esophagus is probably very common. Whether and how to, first, screen for, and
      then, perform surveillance in Barrett's esophagus remains highly problematic and 
      contentious.

TI  - Evaluation and management of patients with recurrent peptic ulcer disease after
      acid-reducing operations: a systematic review.
PG  - 606-26
AB  - This systematic review examines the evidence for commonly employed strategies of 
      managing patients with recurrent ulcer disease after acid-reducing operations.
      Particular attention is given to recent evidence relating Helicobacter pylori (H.
      pylori ) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to ulcer recurrence
      after operative therapy. MEDLINE word searches of the literature from 1966 to
      2001 identified 895 articles that cross-reference the terms "peptic ulcer disease
      (PUD)," "surgery," and "recurrence." Articles were selected for systematic review
      of evidence relating incomplete vagotomy, NSAIDs, and H. pylori to postoperative 
      ulcer recurrence and evidence supporting common medical and surgical strategies. 
      The relationship between incomplete vagotomy and recurrent ulcer disease is
      suggested by randomized controlled trials and well-designed prospective case
      series. The evidence that NSAID use is an important pathogenic factor in
      recurrent ulcer disease includes the relationship between NSAIDs and primary PUD,
      the occurrence of NSAID-induced ulcers in patients taking proton pump inhibitors,
      and case series demonstrating virulent ulcer disease in patients taking aspirin
      despite prior acid-reducing operations. The relationship between H. pylori
      infection and postoperative ulcer recurrence remains uncertain despite multiple
      controlled trials and well-designed case series that have documented high rates
      of H. pylori infection in postoperative patients. The initial management of
      patients with recurrent ulcer disease after acid-reducing operations consists of 
      a protein pump inhibitor or a histamine-2 receptor antagonist and antibiotics
      directed at H. pylori, if present. Evidence for this regimen includes prospective
      randomized trials demonstrating the efficacy of cimetidine in healing ulcers
      after acid-reducing operations and prospective, randomized studies documenting
      the efficacy of histamine-2 receptor antagonists and protein pump inhibitors in
      the management of patients with primary PUD. The critical role that H. pylori
      infection plays in primary PUD and the minimal risks associated with H. pylori
      eradication strongly support the initiation of antibiotic therapy when H. pylori 
      is present. The principal indication for operative management of recurrent PUD is
      the occurrence of ulcer complications that cannot be managed by medical or
      endoscopic means. The operative management of patients with failed acid-reducing 
      operations is based on ulcer recurrence rates and morbidity and mortality rates
      in randomized and nonrandomized prospective trials of patients with primary PUD
      and retrospective case series of patients undergoing remedial operative
      procedures after various failed acid-reducing operations.

TI  - Is it possible to predict treatment response to a proton pump inhibitor in
      functional dyspepsia?
PG  - 117-24
AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of proton pump inhibitors in functional dyspepsia is
      modest and the prognostic factors are almost unknown. METHODS: Data were pooled
      on patients (n = 826) with a diagnosis of functional dyspepsia from two
      placebo-controlled trials who were treated with omeprazole, 10 or 20 mg once
      daily, for 4 weeks. Self-administered questionnaires for the assessment of
      symptoms and health-related quality of life were completed before entry, and
      epigastric pain/discomfort was recorded on diary cards. Treatment success was
      defined as the complete absence of epigastric pain/discomfort on each of the last
      3 days of week 4. Prognostic factors were identified by multiple logistic
      regression analysis. RESULTS: The most discriminating predictor of treatment
      success (P < 0.0001) was the number of days with epigastric pain/discomfort
      during the first week of treatment. Fewer days with symptoms during the first
      week led to higher response rates at 4 weeks. In addition, age > 40 years,
      bothersome heartburn, low scores for bloating, epigastric pain and diarrhoea,
      history of symptoms for < 3 months and low impairment of vitality at baseline
      were identified as positive predictors of outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Early response to
      treatment with a proton pump inhibitor, during the first week, seems to predict
      the outcome after 4 weeks in patients with functional dyspepsia.

TI  - Proton-pump inhibitor therapy for acetylsalicylic acid associated upper
      gastrointestinal symptoms: a randomized placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 109-15
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Patients using acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) have an increased risk
      of upper gastrointestinal discomfort. The aim of this study was to assess whether
      gastric acid suppression improves upper gastrointestinal symptoms in patients
      using low-dose aspirin for cardiovascular disease. METHODS: In a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled randomised trial, 150 patients using low-dose (80 mg)
      acetylsalicylic acid with upper gastrointestinal symptoms who had been admitted
      at the Coronary Care Unit of the University Medical Center Nijmegen were assigned
      to treatment with rabeprazole (20 mg once daily) or placebo for 4 weeks.
      Treatment success, defined as complete upper gastrointestinal symptom relief,
      could be evaluated in 143 patients. RESULTS: At 4 weeks after randomization, 34
      of the 73 patients assigned to rabeprazole therapy (47%) as compared with 30 of
      the 70 patients given placebo (43%) reported complete upper gastrointestinal
      symptom relief (P = 0.54). Rabeprazole therapy did lead to a 52% improvement of
      heartburn symptoms [25% vs. 16%; odds ratio (OR) 0.48, 95% confidence interval
      (CI): 0.24-0.97]. Epigastric pain, regurgitation, bloating and nausea symptoms
      did not statistically change after treatment. Patients with a history of
      dyspepsia more often reported treatment success in comparison to those without
      (75% vs. 40%; OR 0.25, 95% CI: 0.09-0.70). CONCLUSIONS: Proton-pump inhibitor
      therapy significantly reduced heartburn, but not other acetylsalicylic acid
      associated symptoms.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori eradication and peptic ulcer healing: the impact of deleting 
      the proton pump inhibitor and using a once-daily treatment.
PG  - 93-100
AB  - AIM: To compare cheaper and simpler once-daily regimens, with and without a
      proton pump inhibitor, with standard, twice-daily, triple therapy. METHODS: A
      randomized, placebo-controlled, treatment trial in Vietnam allocated 296
      Helicobacter pylori-infected patients with peptic ulcer of >or= 5 mm to one of
      three regimens: (i) twice-daily: lansoprazole 30 mg, clarithromycin 250 mg and
      tinidazole 500 mg; (ii) once-daily: lansoprazole 60 mg, clarithromycin 500 mg and
      tinidazole 1000 mg; (iii) once-daily: placebo, clarithromycin 500 mg and
      tinidazole 1000 mg. H. pylori status was assessed by culture and immunoblot,
      ulcer healing by endoscopy and side-effects by structured questionnaires.
      RESULTS: Per protocol eradication (N = 256) was higher with standard therapy
      (87%) than with once-daily therapy (72%), and both were better than once-daily
      therapy without proton pump inhibitor (39%). Per protocol ulcer healing after
      standard therapy (83%) was not significantly better than that after once-daily
      therapy (73%), but better than that after therapy without proton pump inhibitor
      (65%). Side-effects were reported at similar rates in all groups. CONCLUSIONS:
      Proton pump inhibitor was needed for optimal eradication and ulcer healing.
      Twice-daily administration showed improved success rates when compared with
      once-daily therapies. Peptic ulcer healing was achieved even in patients treated 
      with antibiotics only, confirming the central role of H. pylori in the
      pathophysiology of peptic ulcer disease.

TI  - Quadruple therapy for initial eradication of Helicobacter pylori in peptic ulcer:
      comparison with triple therapy.
PG  - 85-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Quadruple therapy appears to be more effective than standard triple
      therapy in the management of patients with Helicobacter pylori infection who
      harbor drug-resistant organisms. No data are available on the relative efficacies
      of triple and quadruple drug regimens from India. METHODS: Consecutive patients
      with peptic ulcer and H. pylori infection were randomized to receive lansoprazole
      30 mg twice daily along with either amoxycillin (500 mg four times daily) and
      clarithromycin (500 mg twice a day) (Group A), or tri-potassium dicitrato
      bismuthate (120 mg four times daily), metronidazole (400 mg thrice daily) and
      tetracycline (500 mg 4 times daily) (Group B) for 10 days. Presence of H. pylori 
      infection was looked for using an in-house urease test and histology before
      starting treatment, and 30 days after completion of treatment. RESULTS:
      Twenty-nine of 35 patients in Group A and 24 of 33 in Group B had eradication of 
      infection (82.8% and 72.7% by intention-to-treat analysis, and 87.9% and 85.7% by
      per protocol analysis, respectively; p = ns). Side-effects occurred in 4 (12%)
      and 5 (18%) patients in Groups A and B, respectively (p = ns); discontinuation of
      drugs was required in two patients in group B. CONCLUSIONS: Quadruple therapy for
      initial treatment of H. pylori infection does not offer any advantage over
      standard triple therapy in Indian patients.

TI  - Pharmacotherapy for chronic gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and Barrett's
      oesophagus.
PG  - 1049-61
AB  - Over the last two decades there have been major advances in the medical treatment
      of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) and Barrett's oesophagus. Motility
      agents, H(2)-receptor antagonists and proton-pump inhibitors (PPI) have all been 
      evaluated in short- and long-term studies. Symptomatic response needs to be
      differentiated from healing of oesophagitis and maintenance of remission.
      Clinical trials have convincingly demonstrated the superiority of PPIs to
      motility agents and H(2)-receptor antagonists for all clinical aspects of GORD.
      Barrett's oesophagus requires lifelong acid suppression. Treatment with standard 
      doses of PPIs is often insufficient and higher doses are frequently required.
      Medical treatment does not appear to result in clinically significant regression 
      of Barrett's oesophagus.

TI  - Pharmacotherapy of chronic cough in adults.
PG  - 1039-48
AB  - Chronic cough is a debilitating symptom for which patients commonly seek medical 
      attention. Among adult non-smokers who are not taking an angiotensin-converting
      enzyme inhibitor and have a normal or near normal chest radiograph, postnasal
      drip syndrome caused by a variety of rhinosinus conditions, asthma and
      non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease
      singly or in combination, are the most common diagnoses underlying chronic cough.
      Pharmacotherapy for chronic cough can be either specific or non-specific.
      Specific therapy is preferable and the most effective as it is directed at the
      aetiologies and pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for cough. In contrast,
      non-specific therapy is used only in limited clinical settings, as it is directed
      at the symptom rather than underlying aetiologies and aims only to control,
      rather than eliminate cough.

TI  - Effect of short-term treatment with regular or high doses of omeprazole on the
      detection of Helicobacter pylori in bleeding peptic ulcer patients.
PG  - 588-93
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is unknown whether short-term regular or high-dose omeprazole has 
      any influence on the colonization of Helicobacter pylori in the stomach. We
      therefore studied the effect of 3-day treatment of 2 different doses of
      omeprazole. METHODS: H. pylori-positive patients with peptic ulcer bleeding (n = 
      101) were randomized to receive either a regular dose (20 mg/day for 3 days) (n =
      51) or a high dose of omeprazole (80 mg bolus + 8 mg/h infusion/day for 3 days)
      (n = 50). H. pylori status was assessed by histology and urease testing of
      gastric biopsies pre-entry and after 3-day therapy. RESULTS: With the high dose
      of omeprazole, tests for the diagnosis of H. pylori became negative significantly
      more often than with the regular dose (60% versus 27.5%, P=0.001 (any test),
      67.6% versus 31.7%, P=0.003 (histology) and 82.2% versus 43.6%, P=0.001 (urease
      test)). CONCLUSION: Conversion of the H. pylori tests negative after 3-day
      treatment of omeprazole is dose-dependent. The diagnosis of H. pylori infection
      depends on the timing of biopsies in relation to the beginning of proton-pump
      inhibitor treatment. If samples to find H. pylori are not taken before the
      treatment, the presence of the bacteria may be overlooked.

TI  - Rofecoxib in rheumatoid arthritis: new indication. No better that other NSAIDS.
PG  - 89-90
AB  - (1) For symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (pain, joint stiffness), the reference
      treatment is a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) such as diclofenac or
      ibuprofen. Celecoxib, a coxib NSAID, has no proven advantages over these other
      NSAIDs. (2) Rofecoxib is the second coxib to be approved in this indication. The 
      clinical evaluation file shows that the optimal daily dose is 25 mg. (3) A
      comparative trial in more than 8 000 patients, showed that rofecoxib was no more 
      effective than 1 g/day of naproxen. There are no trials comparing rofecoxib with 
      celecoxib, diclofenac or ibuprofen. (4) In clinical trials the overall
      frequencies of adverse effects and treatment withdrawals for adverse effects were
      the same for rofecoxib as for other NSAIDs. In one trial, rofecoxib caused fewer 
      gastrointestinal disturbances, particularly serious ones, than naproxen. But
      rofecoxib caused more gastrointestinal disturbances than placebo. During
      postmarketing follow up in the United States, a number of deaths due to
      gastrointestinal complications on rofecoxib were reported. Rofecoxib carries the 
      same renal risk as other NSAIDs. An excess risk of cardiovascular events cannot
      be ruled out. (5) In practice, the advent of rofecoxib in no way influences the
      choice of NSAID for symptomatic treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

TI  - Prevalence of extra-oesophageal manifestations in gastro-oesophageal reflux
      disease: an analysis based on the ProGERD Study.
PG  - 1515-20
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) can be associated
      with a variety of extra-oesophageal disorders (EED) such as chronic cough,
      asthma, laryngeal disorder or chest pain. The aim of the study was to estimate
      and compare the prevalence of EED in a population with symptomatic GERD
      presenting as either erosive reflux disease (ERD) or non-erosive reflux disease
      (NERD). METHODS: Baseline data were collected from a prospective, multicentre,
      open cohort study (ProGERD) in which patients will be followed for 5 years after 
      initial treatment with esomeprazole. Within the framework of this trial, all
      patients underwent gastroscopy and filled out a questionnaire designed to assess 
      EED. The influence of potential prognostic factors on the prevalence of EED was
      analysed by multivariate (stepwise logistic regression) analysis. RESULTS: 6215
      patients (3303 male, 2912 female; mean age 54 years) presenting with heartburn
      were included. EED was detected in 32.8% of all patients. The proportion was
      significantly higher (P = 0.0002) in ERD patients (34.9%) than in NERD patients
      (30.5%). As judged from the multivariate analysis, female gender, age,
      oesophagitis of LA grade C/D, duration of GERD disease greater than 1 years and
      smoking were significantly associated with EED. ERD patients with oesophagitis of
      LA grade A or B did not have a significantly higher risk of EED than patients
      with NERD. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with GERD have a high probability of
      experiencing EED, which may be associated with a number of prognostic factors
      such as duration and severity of GERD. Extra-oesophageal disorders are slightly, 
      but statistically, more prevalent in ERD than in NERD patients.

TI  - Effects of 6-12 months of esomeprazole treatment on the gastric mucosa.
PG  - 1257-65
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of 6-12 months of
      treatment with esomeprazole on the histopathology of the gastric mucosa. METHODS:
      Two identically designed, randomized, placebo-controlled trials of esomeprazole
      40, 20, or 10 mg daily for up to 6 months, as well as a noncomparative,
      multicenter trial of esomeprazole 40 mg daily for up to 12 months, were conducted
      in 1326 patients with healed erosive esophagitis (1294 negative for Helicobacter 
      pylori [H. pylori]). Gastric biopsy samples were obtained before treatment and on
      completion of (or discontinuation from) the trials. Samples were evaluated for
      the presence of H. pylori, characteristics of acute gastritis or atrophic
      gastritis, and enterochromaffin-like cell pathology. RESULTS: During treatment
      with esomeprazole, the number of patients with an improvement in gastric
      histological scores was typically greater than or equal to the number who
      worsened. Gastric histological scores worsened for each corporal or antral
      characteristic of gastritis in <6.2% of patients. Histological scores with
      esomeprazole and placebo were similar throughout the 6-month trials. Only one
      among 1326 patients treated with esomeprazole (H. pylori negative) had evidence
      of treatment-emergent atrophic gastritis. On final biopsy, 5-12% of patients had 
      abnormal enterochromaffin-like cell scores (simple, linear, or micronodular
      hyperplasia). There were no instances of enterochromaffin-like cell dysplasia,
      carcinoids, or neoplasia. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with healed erosive esophagitis
      receiving esomeprazole for up to 12 months had minor fluctuations in gastric
      histological scores, similar to those experienced in untreated populations. Use
      of esomeprazole did not raise any safety concerns with respect to the development
      of atrophic gastritis, or cause clinically significant changes in
      enterochromaffin-like cells.

TI  - A randomized trial of an acid-peptic disease management program in a managed care
      environment.
PG  - 425-33
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the effectiveness of a disease management program for
      patients with acid-related disorders. STUDY DESIGN: A cluster-randomized clinical
      trial of 406 patients comparing a disease management program with "usual
      practice." PATIENTS AND METHODS: Enrolled patients included those presenting with
      new dyspepsia and chronic users of antisecretory drugs in 8 geographically
      separate physician offices associated with the Orlando Health Care Group. There
      were 35 providers in the intervention group and 48 in the control group. The
      disease management program included evidence-based practice guidelines
      implemented by using physician champions, academic detailing, and
      multidisciplinary teams. Processes of care, patient symptoms, quality of life,
      costs, and work days lost were measured 6 months after patient enrollment.
      RESULTS: Compared with usual practice, disease management was associated with
      improvements in Helicobacter pylori testing (61% vs 9%; P = .001), use of
      recommended H pylori treatment regimens (96% vs 10%; P = .001), and
      discontinuation rates of proton pump therapy after treatment (70% vs 36%; P =
      .04). There were few differences in patient quality of life or symptoms between
      the 2 study groups. Disease management resulted in fewer days of antisecretory
      therapy (71.7 vs 88.1 days; P = .02) but no difference in total costs.
      CONCLUSION: This disease management program for patients with acid-related
      disorders led to improved processes of care. The effectiveness of such a program 
      in other settings requires further study.

      esomeprazole: a crossover study in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux
      disease.
PG  - 791-9
AB  - AIM: To compare the effect of pantoprazole and esomeprazole on intra-oesophageal 
      pH and investigate their pharmacokinetics in patients with symptomatic
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). METHODS: Double-blind, randomized,
      two-period crossover study. Caucasian men with symptomatic GORD (n=48) were
      selected on the basis of clinical records of typical GORD symptoms, confirmed by 
      a pathological reflux time (oesophageal pH<4 for > or =6% of the time). They
      received oral pantoprazole 40 mg once daily (od) or esomeprazole 40 mg od for
      seven days. Continuous 24 h oesophageal pH-metry was performed at baseline and
      day 7. Evaluations included: pre- and post-treatment differences in the
      percentage of time with pH<4.0 and <3.0 between baseline and day 7; area under
      the curve (AUC), Cmax, and T(1/2); point estimates and 90% confidence intervals
      (CI) on days 1 and 7, calculated for ratios of the AUC and Cmax. RESULTS: Both
      drugs decreased the mean total number of reflux episodes and reduced the
      percentage of reflux time within 24 h to <3%. No pathological reflux was
      detectable after repeated administration of either drug. The 90% CI were within
      the predefined range at all time points; thus, equivalence of pantoprazole and
      esomeprazole was concluded. For pantoprazole, Cmax and AUC were unchanged on day 
      7 vs day 1, confirming its high and constant bioavailability. For esomeprazole,
      Cmax and AUC were increased on day 7 vs day 1 by 80% and 50%, respectively,
      indicating low initial bioavailability. No clinically relevant side effects were 
      seen for either drug. CONCLUSION: Pantoprazole and esomeprazole have equivalent
      effect on oesophageal pH, since no pathological reflux was detected after
      treatment with either drug. For esomeprazole, the Cmax and AUC increased after
      multiple dosing; for pantoprazole the pharmacokinetics were predictable and
      independent of the number of administered doses.

TI  - Etoricoxib in the treatment of chronic pain.
PG  - 315-8
AB  - For the many patients who suffer chronic pain, we seek the most effective
      anti-inflammatory drug with the least side-effect profile and the greatest
      long-term safety. Etoricoxib, a selective COX2 inhibitor, has been shown to be as
      effective as non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the
      management of chronic pain in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, for
      periods of up to one year. Data on etoricoxib efficacy in chronic low back pain
      is beginning to emerge. The side-effect profile of etoricoxib suggests it is well
      tolerated with similar adverse effects to non-selective NSAIDs. Larger studies
      are awaited, to see whether superior gastrointestinal tolerability can be proven.
      Further work will be required to show that etoricoxib is safe in patients with
      pre-existing cardiovascular or gastrointestinal comorbidity, and the potentially 
      confounding role of aspirin still needs to be elucidated. However, etoricoxib
      shows promise as a new and effective COX2 inhibitor in clinical practice.

TI  - [Impact of 24-hour intraesophageal pH monitoring with 2 channels in the diagnosis
      of reflux-induced otolaryngologic disorders].
PG  - 347-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) may suffer from 
      a large variety of symptoms in the upper aerodigestive tract such as globus
      sensation, chronic cough, hoarseness and many others. Diagnosis and causal
      therapy may sometimes be difficult with gastroenterologic evaluation sometimes
      revealing no pathologic result. The objective of this study was to determine the 
      impact of 24-hour intraesophageal pH monitoring with 2 channels (gastric and
      laryngeal) in the diagnosis of reflux-induced otolaryngologic disorders. METHODS:
      This study included 22 patients presenting to the Department of Otolaryngology
      with symptoms like chronic cough (n = 3), globus sensation and dysphagia (n =
      11), heartburn (n = 2), hoarseness and dysphonia (n = 2) or burning sensation of 
      the tongue (n = 1). Three patients had a pathologic formation in the glottic area
      (leukoplakia, granuloma, polyp). All patients underwent a otolaryngological
      examination, a gastroenterological investigation and a 24-hour intraesophageal pH
      monitoring with 2 channels. RESULTS: All 22 patients showed laryngeal mucosal
      lesions (posterior laryngitis). The gastroenterological evaluation with
      esophagogastroduodenoscopy was normal in 4 cases. 13 patients showed a hiatal
      hernia, 4 patients were suffering from a reflux-esophagitis grade I and 2
      patients from grade II. One patient had an erythema and 5 patients showed
      erosions of the gastric mucosa. Seven patients had more than one of the above
      mentioned diagnoses. Intraesophageal pH-monitoring with 2 channels over 24 hours 
      revealed a gastroesophageal reflux of all 22 patients and a high reflux to the
      laryngeal level of 21 patients, probably causing laryngopharyngeal symptoms.
      Therapy of the patients consisted of medical antireflux treatment with proton
      pump inhibitor esomeprazol (Nexium, 40 mg, 1-0-0). Within 4 weeks 15 of 22
      patients had no more laryngopharyngeal symptoms or at least a significant
      reduction. CONCLUSION: Patients with laryngopharyngeal symptoms such as
      hoarseness, globus sensation or dysphagia can suffer from GERD, even if typical
      symptoms such as heartburn or retrosternal pain do not exist and gastroesophageal
      intervention reveals a normal result. The best diagnostic instrument for the
      diagnosis of reflux-induced otolaryngologic disorders is a 24-hour
      intraesophageal pH-monitoring with 2 channels (measure-points at the distal
      esophagus and laryngeal level). Medical antireflux treatment should consist of
      proton pump inhibitors (e. g. Nexium) in a dose of 40 mg per day over at least 4 
      weeks.

TI  - Endoscopic implantation of enteryx for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux
      disease: technique, pre-clinical and clinical experience.
PG  - 191-200
AB  - The implantation of Enteryx polymer in the LES is a fast, minimally invasive
      procedure with anticipated low procedural risks and limited costs. Preliminary
      clinical data after 6 months of follow-up show good results in more than 80% of
      the patients, with objective improvement of acid reflux time. Enteryx is
      effective in the management of GERD, as evidenced by the ability of GERD patients
      with a history of use of PPIs and other GERD medications to eliminate or
      significantly reduce use of these medications. Mechanisms of action of Enteryx
      implantation suggest a change in distensibility of the LES, allowing a greater
      competency of the cardia. LES pressure and length might be increased after
      polymer implantation, and further studies are needed to study the effect of
      Enteryx on transient relaxations of the LES, which is the prevalent mechanism of 
      reflux in patients with mild GERD. Challenges with this procedure include
      refining technique to deliver adequate volume in each patient and determining if 
      the ring-shaped implant is needed. In addition to acid reflux, another indication
      for use of this treatment might be biliary reflux in gastrectomized patients;
      preliminary data suggest that Enteryx may reduce symptoms and improve bile reflux
      (J. Deviere, unpublished observations, 2002). Further studies are needed to
      definitively establish the safety of the procedure. This is a major point because
      gastroenterologists are not dealing with ill patients but primarily with
      individuals who have a good quality of life while taking PPIs. The other area to 
      investigate is the efficacy of the treatment through a sham-controlled study.
      Finally, this endoscopic technique will have to be evaluated in terms of
      cost-effectiveness against medical and surgical therapies.

TI  - Gatekeeper Reflux Repair System: technique, pre-clinical, and clinical
      experience.
PG  - 179-89
AB  - The Gatekeeper Reflux Repair System is a new, promising endoscopic anti-reflux
      therapy. It has now been shown that it is possible to implant hydrogel prosthesis
      in the submucosa of the esophagus of humans. The pilot study in humans showed
      that it is a safe technique and no prostheses migrated into the mediastinum. With
      the help of endoscopic ultrasonography, each prosthesis was followed during the
      6-month pilot study. After finishing this pilot study, new multi-center studies
      have been initiated with implantation of more prostheses to increase efficacy.
      One of the definite advantages over the other endoscopic treatments currently
      being developed is its reversibility. Regarding endoscopic anti-reflux therapy in
      general, it is important to stress that at this time no data are available in the
      literature about the comparison to medical therapy. At the same time long-term
      results are also unknown. For these reasons these endoscopic procedures must be
      considered experimental and they should be performed in a clinical research
      setting. Within a few years the role of the Gatekeeper Reflux Repair System will 
      be better understood for those PPI-dependent GERD-patients who wish to stop their
      medication.

TI  - An overview of the success and failure of surgical therapy: standards against
      which the outcome of endoscopic therapy is measured.
PG  - 69-73, viii
AB  - Medical therapy for reflux disease has evolved from frequent antacid use to once 
      daily proton pump inhibitor therapy. Despite the efficacy of these agents in
      healing erosive esophagitis, there are several short-comings with medical therapy
      including incomplete symptom relief, the need for continuous maintenance therapy,
      and cost. Endoscopic and laparoscopic treatments for reflux disease are appealing
      because they could reduce or eliminate the need for chronic maintenance therapy
      with medications. While there is evidence of high quality on the efficacy of
      medical therapy from randomized controlled trials, data on endoscopic procedures 
      and surgery is more limited. This article summarizes the needed studies and the
      standards against which these procedures should be measured.

TI  - Overview of medical therapy for gastroesophageal disease.
PG  - 57-68
AB  - The last twenty years have seen an evolution of much improved strategies in the
      medical treatment of GERD. Current therapy is targeted at acid suppression, to
      deal with consequences of mucosal injury and afford resolution of symptoms. Given
      their modest efficacy, there is no longer much support for initial treatment with
      H2RAs. PPIs have been shown to provide the highest levels of symptom relief and
      esophageal healing, in addition to preventing relapse and complications. With
      this class of agents, the clinician is able to prescribe a drug that is as highly
      effective as surgery for the purpose intended, without worrying about long term
      sequelae of acid suppression. It appears that patients with extraesophageal GERD 
      must be treated with higher doses of pharmacologic therapy, principally with the 
      PPIs, for longer periods of time to achieve complete relief of symptoms when
      compared to patients with heartburn and erosive esophagitis. There is still no
      clear consensus as to whether aggressive acid suppression alters the natural
      history of Barrett's esophagus. Based on their initial success, it appears that
      the next generation of evolving medical therapies will continue to play an
      important role in the management of GERD. The outcome from medical therapy is the
      standard against which the results of the novel endoscopy anti-reflux treatments 
      will be measured.

TI  - Do Japanese and Swedish peptic ulcer patients respond differently to Helicobacter
      pylori eradication therapies and what are their histological features?
PG  - 482-90
AB  - BACKGROUND: As a consequence of gastric histological differences, Japanese and
      Swedish peptic ulcer (PU) patients may respond differently to Helicobacter pylori
      eradication therapies. METHODS: The study was single-blind and compared four
      eradication therapies in Japanese and Swedish patients with healed gastric (GU)
      or duodenal (DU) ulcer. Swedish patients received either (a)
      omeprazole+clarithromycin (OC, where O = 20 mg, C = 500 mg) for 2 weeks, or
      triple therapy with (b) omeprazole + amoxicillin + clarithromycin (OAC-L where O 
      = 20mg, A = 1 g, C = 250 mg); (c) OAC-H (where O = 20 mg, A-1 g, C-500 mg); or
      (d) omeprazole + metronidazole + clarithromycin (OMC, where O = 20 mg, M = 400
      mg, C = 250 mg) for 1 week. Antibiotic doses were weight-adjusted downwards in
      Japanese patients. H. pylori was assessed using the urea breath test (UBT),
      histology and culture pre-entry, with UBT being repeated 4 and 8 weeks after
      stopping treatment. Histology and culture were repeated if the UBT was positive
      post-therapy. RESULTS: Recruitment included 120 patients from Japan (43 GU, 61
      DU, 16 GU+DU) and 120 from Sweden (119 DU, 1 GU+DU). There were 26 exclusions
      from a FAS analysis due to H. pylori negativity (14), no drug administration (7) 
      or no data after visit 1 (5). Eradication rates (FAS) from Japan were (a) 63%,
      (b) 93%, (c) 96% or (d) 96%, and for Sweden (a) 92%, (b) 86%, (c) 93% or (d) 96%.
      Dual therapy was less effective in patients with gastric atrophy associated with 
      GU disease. Tolerability was good in all treatment groups, with no serious
      adverse events. CONCLUSION: Triple therapies were safe and effective for H.
      pylori eradication in Japanese and Swedish peptic ulcer patients. Dual therapy
      was significantly less effective in the Japanese patients, half of whom had a
      history of GU and more abnormal histology than in the Swedish patients, all of
      whom had DU.

TI  - Effect of pantoprazole on the course of reflux-associated laryngitis: a
      placebo-controlled double-blind crossover study.
PG  - 462-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The optimal management of patients with reflux-associated laryngitis 
      is unclear. We performed a placebo-controlled crossover trial in patients with
      proven reflux disease and associated laryngitis to determine the effect of
      pantoprazole and to gain information on the natural course of the disease.
      METHODS: Sixty-two consecutive non-smoking patients with hoarseness and proven
      laryngitis were examined. Scores with respect to the larynx and for subjective
      complaints were determined and 24-h pH-metry to assess acid reflux in the lower
      oesophagus and pharynx was performed. Patients with pathologic reflux were given 
      the chance to enter a double-blinded randomized crossover trial with pantoprazole
      40 mg b.i.d. and placebo for a duration of 3 months each, separated by a 2-week
      washout period. RESULTS: Twenty-four of 62 patients showed pathological reflux;
      21 patients were included in the study and 14 concluded all parts of the study.
      Both pantoprazole and placebo resulted in a marked improvement in laryngitis
      scores (decrease of 8.0 +/- 1.4 versus 5.6 +/- 2.6; no significant difference
      between the 2 treatments) and symptoms after the first 3 months (decrease of
      oesophageal symptom score of 2.2 +/- 1.4 versus 5.4 +/- 2.8; decrease of
      laryngeal scores of 8.3 +/- 3.6 versus 10.3 +/- 3.9; also no significant
      difference between the 2 treatments). A second pH-metry 2 weeks thereafter proved
      the persistence of reflux in most of these patients. Switching to pantoprazole
      led to a further improvement of scores. In the group switched to placebo there
      was recurrence only in a minority of patients. CONCLUSIONs: The self-limited
      nature of reflux-associated laryngitis in non-smokers is largely underestimated. 
      Laryngitis improves despite the persistence of reflux. Pantoprazole may be
      helpful especially in relieving acute symptoms, but the advantage of long-term
      treatment over placebo has been greatly overestimated.

TI  - The cost effectiveness of rofecoxib and celecoxib in patients with osteoarthritis
      or rheumatoid arthritis.
PG  - 283-92
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of the cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2)
      selective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) rofecoxib compared with
      naproxen and the COX-2 NSAID celecoxib compared with ibuprofen and diclofenac.
      METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis based on a 5-year Markov model. Probability 
      estimates were derived from detailed data of 2 randomized trials and a systematic
      search of the medical literature. Utility estimates were obtained from 60
      randomly selected members of the general public. Cost estimates were obtained
      from Canadian provincial databases. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were
      calculated for patients at average risk of upper gastrointestinal (UGI) events
      and for high-risk patients with a prior history of a UGI event. Subjects were
      patients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) where a decision has
      been made to treat with NSAIDs but who do not require low-dose aspirin. Main
      outcome measures were proportion of patients with clinical or complicated UGI
      events, quality-adjusted life expectancy, and life expectancy. RESULTS:
      Evaluation of rofecoxib versus naproxen in patients with RA at average risk
      resulted in costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of $Can271,188.
      Celecoxib was dominated by diclofenac in average-risk patients. Both rofecoxib
      and celecoxib are cost-effective in high-risk patients. Analyses by age groups
      and assuming a threshold of Can$50,000 per QALY gained, suggest that rofecoxib or
      celecoxib would be cost-effective in patients aged over 76 and 81, respectively, 
      without additional risk factors. CONCLUSION: Both rofecoxib and celecoxib are
      economically attractive in high risk and elderly patients. They are not
      economically attractive in patients at average risk. Coprescription of
      proton-pump inhibitors with COX-2 NSAIDs is not economically attractive for
      patients at high risk.

TI  - A validated symptoms questionnaire (Chinese GERDQ) for the diagnosis of
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in the Chinese population.
PG  - 1407-13
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To develop a validated gastro-oesophageal disease (GERD)
      symptom questionnaire for the Chinese population. METHODS: One hundred Chinese
      patients with GERD and 101 healthy Chinese controls were presented with a 20-item
      GERD questionnaire in the Chinese language (Chinese GERDQ). Quality of life in
      GERD patients was assessed by SF-36. A standard dose of proton pump inhibitors
      for 4 weeks was prescribed to 35 patients with newly diagnosed GERD. The Chinese 
      GERDQ was performed before, 4 weeks and 8 weeks after treatment. Concept,
      content, construct, discriminant validity and reliability of the questionnaire
      were assessed. RESULTS: Seven items were selected by logistic regression to
      account for most of the differences between controls and GERD patients with a
      good reproducibility and internal consistency. A cut-off score of equal or
      greater than 12 was determined to discriminate between controls and GERD patients
      with a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 84%. The Chinese GERDQ correlated 
      negatively with five domains of the SF-36 and discriminated between GERD patients
      who reported symptomatic improvement during proton pump inhibitor treatment and
      symptoms deterioration upon withdrawal of proton pump inhibitor treatment.
      CONCLUSIONS: The Chinese GERDQ could be used in epidemiological studies to assess
      the frequency and severity of GERD in patient populations and in interventional
      studies of GERD.

TI  - Short- and long-term therapy for reflux oesophagitis in the elderly: a
      multi-centre, placebo-controlled study with pantoprazole.
PG  - 1399-406
AB  - BACKGROUND: No placebo-controlled clinical trials have yet been published on the 
      efficacy of therapy in older subjects with oesophagitis. AIM: To evaluate the
      efficacy of pantoprazole in preventing the recurrence of oesophagitis in elderly 
      subjects. METHODS: One hundred and sixty-four patients aged 65 years and over
      with acute oesophagitis were treated openly with pantoprazole, 40 mg daily, for 8
      weeks. Patients with documented healing of erosive oesophagitis were then treated
      with pantoprazole, 20 mg daily, for 6 months. Thereafter, cured patients were
      randomized to receive pantoprazole, 20 mg daily, or placebo for the following 6
      months. Clinical evaluations were performed every 2 months, and endoscopy was
      repeated after 8 weeks and after 6 and 12 months and/or whenever symptoms
      suggested a relapse of oesophagitis. RESULTS: After 8 weeks, the healing rates of
      oesophagitis were 81.1% (75.1-87.1%) and 93.7% (89.7-97.7%) by intention-to-treat
      and per protocol analyses, respectively. After 6 months, the corresponding values
      were 82% (75.4-88.5%) and 92.4% (87.6-97.2%), respectively. After 12 months, the 
      per protocol and intention-to-treat healing rates of oesophagitis were 95.1%
      (88.5-100%) and 79.6% (68.3-90.9%), respectively, in the treatment group vs.
      32.7% (19.9-45.4%) and 30.4% (18.3-42.4%), respectively, in the placebo group (P 
      = 0.0001). Heartburn, acid regurgitation and chest pain were significantly
      associated with the relapse of oesophagitis (P = 0.0001), whereas hiatus hernia, 
      Helicobacter pylori infection, concomitant diseases and treatments were not.
      CONCLUSION: In the elderly, pantoprazole was highly effective in healing and
      reducing the relapse of oesophagitis; discontinuing active treatment after 6
      months was associated with a significant increase in the relapse rate.

TI  - One-week triple therapy with esomeprazole, clarithromycin and metronidazole
      provides effective eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection.
PG  - 1381-7
AB  - AIM: To compare the eradication rates of treatment with esomeprazole,
      metronidazole and clarithromycin (EMC) vs. omeprazole, metronidazole and
      clarithromycin (OMC), given for 7 days. OMC treatment was followed by 3 weeks of 
      treatment with 20 mg omeprazole alone; the EMC group received placebo. METHODS: A
      randomized, double-blind, controlled study was conducted in 36 Canadian centres. 
      Patients had a minimum 3-month history of dyspepsia, with or without a previous
      history of peptic ulcer disease, and were Helicobacter pylori positive by urea
      breath test. The eradication of H. pylori was determined by two negative breath
      tests performed at least 4 and 8 weeks following the completion of treatment.
      RESULTS: The intention-to-treat and per protocol populations consisted of 379 and
      339 patients, respectively. The success rates of EMC/placebo were 76% (144/190)
      by intention-to-treat and 80% (138/172) by per protocol analysis; for
      OMC/omeprazole, the rates were 72% (137/189) and 75% (125/167), respectively. The
      difference between the two treatment groups was not significant. Treatment was
      well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: A 7-day regimen of esomeprazole, metronidazole and
      clarithromycin is effective and well tolerated for the eradication of H. pylori
      infection.

TI  - Review article: management of mild and severe gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 52-6
AB  - Treatment of endosocopy-negative gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (s-GERD)
      should be directed towards rapid relief of symptoms and then maintenance of
      relief using minimum yet effective therapy. Responses to proton pump inhibitors
      are somewhat lower in s-GERD patients compared to GERD with overt erosive damage 
      (e-GERD). The reasons for a lower response rate are not clear but may relate to
      the inclusion of patients who do not have reflux disease or patients with a lower
      oesophageal sensory threshold. Also poorly understood is the lower yield of
      complete heartburn relief when the number of associated dyspeptic symptoms is
      high. Some form of long-term therapy is needed in the majority of patients. 'On
      demand' proton pump inhibitor therapy to control reflux symptoms is a new and
      attractive option. Time to study discontinuation due to insufficient control of
      heartburn, or any other reason resulting in unwillingness to continue with
      on-demand therapy, is a pragmatic outcome that is well suited to definition of
      the efficacy of on-demand therapy. The goals of treatment of e-GERD should be to 
      relieve symptoms and to heal lesions. Symptom severity and much less endoscopic
      abnormalities drives the therapeutic choices. When symptoms are mild or
      intermittent and when oesophagitis is of limited degree, standard dose proton
      pump inhibitor is usually instituted. Fewer and fewer clinicians would still opt 
      for an H2-receptor antagonist. If there is moderate or severe oesophagitis or if 
      symptoms are particularly troublesome, then the patient should start with
      standard-dose proton pump inhibitor therapy once a day, but not uncommonly a b.d.
      dosage maybe necessary. Once the dose of the acid suppressant that relieves
      symptoms is found, this dose should be maintained for a period of 3 months. After
      this time, an attempt should be made to reduce the dose. If symptoms recur, then 
      the patients should go back to the full-dose proton pump inhibitor and a plan
      should be formulated for long-term treatment. The long-term treatment options
      vary between ongoing acid and suppressant therapy, with occasional attempts to
      reduce the dose, or to go for 'on demand' therapy and (rarely) includes
      consideration for surgery or endoscopic anti-reflux therapy.

TI  - Gastroesophageal reflux, quality of life, and satisfaction in patients with
      achalasia treated with open cardiomyotomy and partial fundoplication.
PG  - 560-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiomyotomy, often associated with an antireflux technique, is
      effective in the management of achalasia, although gastroesophageal reflux (GER) 
      may occur after the procedure. Patient-centered measures, ie, health-related
      quality of life (HRQoL) and satisfaction, should be included in the evaluation of
      the patients. METHODS: A study was made of the incidence of GER (symptoms, upper 
      endoscopy and 24-hour pH monitoring), HRQoL (Short Form-36 Health Survey), and
      satisfaction after open-access cardiomyotomy and 180-degree anterior
      fundoplication in 28 consecutive patients, with a minimum postoperative follow-up
      of 12 months. RESULTS: Mean age was 45 years (range 15 to 80) and 68% were
      female. In 8 subjects (all with heartburn) GER morbidity was present (4 with
      esophagitis and 4 with positive pH study), and 6 patients required proton pump
      inhibitors. Short Form-36 scores after surgery were similar to those found in the
      general population. Patient satisfaction was high and was more related to the
      absence of dysphagia than to the presence of GER symptoms. CONCLUSIONS:
      Gastroesophageal reflux is relatively frequent after cardiomyotomy and partial
      fundoplication, although the efficacy of proton pump inhibitor treatment
      minimizes its clinical significance.

TI  - Optimizing medical therapy for gastroesophageal reflux disease: state of the art.
PG  - 59-69
AB  - Potential interventions for gastroesophageal reflux disease include lifestyle
      modifications, antacids, mucosal protectants, prokinetic (promotility) agents, H2
      receptor antagonists (H2RAs) and, the agents of choice in 2003, proton pump
      inhibitors (PPIs). This article reviews the current state of the art in use of
      these agents. Lifestyle changes, though sound in their intent and in many cases
      based on solid laboratory research, can today be considered only adjuncts to
      pharmacologic therapy. The mainstay of pharmacologic therapy in 2003 is
      antisecretory therapy. Both H2RAs and PPIs inhibit acid secretion and raise
      intragastric pH. H2RAs only block one receptor, have limited effect on acid

TI  - Motion--Cyclo-oxygenase-2 selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are as
      safe as placebo for the stomach: arguments against the motion.
PG  - 335-8
AB  - Cyclo-oxygenase (COX) exists in two isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2, that direct the
      synthesis of prostaglandins, prostacyclin and thromboxane. Traditional
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit both isoenzymes, resulting 
      in damage to the mucosa of the stomach and duodenum, but also in
      cardioprotection. Selective COX-2 inhibitors are less likely to damage the upper 
      gastrointestinal tract, as has been shown by large, randomized, controlled
      trials. Specifically, the newer agents are superior to ibuprofen and naproxen in 
      this regard, but celecoxib and diclofenac were not significantly different in
      patients who were not also taking low-dose acetylsalicylic acid. These studies
      did not include a placebo arm, however, and controlled comparisons of COX-2
      inhibitors with placebo have not enlisted enough subjects to demonstrate
      conclusively that they are equally safe. Selectivity for the COX-2 isoform
      affords protection against upper gastrointestinal toxicity possibly at the
      expense of the cardioprotective effect of traditional NSAIDs. This might explain 
      the higher rate of nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients who are given
      rofecoxib compared with naproxen. A traditional NSAID, combined with either
      misoprostol or a proton pump inhibitor, is still a suitable alternative to
      selective COX-2 inhibitors for the treatment of arthritis.

TI  - Validation of the GSFQ, a self-administered symptom frequency questionnaire for
      patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 307-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is
      based primarily on symptoms experienced by a patient, relatively little attention
      has been paid to the development and validation of self-administered
      questionnaires specific to GERD symptoms. The present article presents the
      validation of the short, self-administered GERD Symptom Frequency Questionnaire
      (GSFQ). METHODS: Patients with GERD participating in a randomized clinical trial 
      comparing pantoprazole and nizatidine were asked to complete the GSFQ together
      with validated instruments for measurement of health-related quality of life
      (Medical Outcome Study Short Form 12) and gastrointestinal symptoms
      (Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale). Completion of the GSFQ, Medical Outcome 
      Study Short Form 12 and Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale took place upon
      entry into the trial (baseline) and during the trial (days 7 and 28). Endoscopy
      was performed at baseline and after 28 days. Cronbach alpha was used to assess
      the internal consistency of the questionnaire. The test-retest reliability of the
      GSFQ was examined by the intraclass correlation coefficient among the 36 patients
      with stable GERD symptoms between day 7 and day 28. Construct validity was
      assessed by comparing the GSFQ with previously validated instruments. Known group
      validity was determined by comparing GSFQ scores across groups of patients known 
      to differ clinically. Responsiveness to change was assessed by the Guyatt's
      statistic. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-one patients formed the study baseline
      group. The analysis demonstrated that the GSFQ questionnaire had excellent
      psychometric properties shown by the high internal consistency (Cronbach alpha
      0.84); that the test-retest reliability was satisfactory (intraclass correlation 
      coefficient 0.64); that there was good evidence that the GSFQ indeed measured
      what it was intended to measure (validity); and that the GSFQ was highly
      responsive to change (Guyatt's statistic 1.48). DISCUSSION: The GSFQ is a short, 
      self-administered, easy to use, GERD-specific questionnaire which should be
      considered as a useful assessment tool in the evaluation of patients with GERD
      and in the assessment of treatment outcomes.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial of test-and-treat strategy for Helicobacter pylori:
      clinical outcomes and health care costs in a managed care population receiving
      long-term acid suppression therapy for physician-diagnosed peptic ulcer disease.
PG  - 1165-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Guidelines recommend Helicobacter pylori (HP) testing and treatment
      for patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease (PUD), assuming that PUD has 
      been documented and that successful HP eradication would eliminate the need for
      further therapy and medical utilization. METHODS: An open-label, randomized
      controlled trial in a managed care setting evaluated the clinical outcome and
      costs of an HP test-and-treat (T & T) strategy in 650 patients receiving
      long-term acid suppression therapy for physician-diagnosed PUD. Patients were
      randomized to T & T for HP (n = 321) or to usual care (n = 329). Outcome measures
      included presence and severity of PUD symptoms, use of acid-reducing medication, 
      and acid-peptic-related health care costs during 12-month follow-up. RESULTS:
      Only 17% of study participants had PUD confirmed by radiography or endoscopy;
      only 38% of the T & T group tested positive for HP. At 12 months, patients in the
      T & T group were less likely to report ulcerlike dyspepsia or use of
      acid-reducing medication; however, 75% of the T & T group used acid-reducing
      medication during the second half of the 12-month follow-up. In the 12 months
      after randomization, the T & T group had higher total acid-peptic-related costs
      than the usual care group. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients receiving long-term acid
      suppression therapy for physician-diagnosed PUD in community practice settings
      are likely to have HP-negative, uninvestigated dyspepsia. Routine testing and
      treating for HP will not reduce acid-peptic-related costs and have only a modest 
      (though statistically significant) effect in reducing clinical symptoms and use
      of acid-reducing medications.

TI  - Empirical prescribing for dyspepsia: randomised controlled trial of test and
      treat versus omeprazole treatment.
PG  - 1118
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of a "Helicobacter pylori test and treat"
      strategy with that of an empirical trial of omeprazole in the non-endoscopic
      management by empirical prescribing of young patients with dyspepsia. DESIGN:
      Randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Hospital gastroenterology unit.
      PARTICIPANTS: 219 patients under 45 years old presenting with dyspepsia without
      alarm symptoms. INTERVENTION: Patients received treatment with omeprazole 20 mg
      (group A) or with a urea breath test followed by an eradication treatment in case
      of H pylori infection or omeprazole alone in non-infected patients (group B).
      Lack of improvement or recurrence of symptoms prompted endoscopy. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURES: Improvement in symptoms assessed by a dyspepsia severity score every
      two months; use of medical resources (endoscopic workload and medical
      consultation); clinical outcome. RESULTS: 96/109 (88%) patients in group A and
      61/110 (55%) in group B (P < 0.0001) had endoscopy: in 19 patients in group A and
      32 in group B (20/67 infected and 12/43 non-infected) because of no improvement; 
      in 77 further patients in group A and 29 in group B (7 infected and 22
      non-infected) because of recurrence of symptoms during follow up. Endoscopy
      showed peptic ulcers only in group A; oesophagitis occurred significantly more
      often in group B than in group A. About 80% of examinations were normal in both
      groups, but nine duodenal scars occurred in group A. CONCLUSIONS: Eradication
      treatment allows resolution of symptoms in a large number of patients with
      dyspepsia and reduces the endoscopic workload. After a trial of omeprazole,
      symptoms recur in nearly every patient. Such treatment is also likely to mask an 
      appreciable number of peptic ulcers and cases of oesophagitis.

TI  - Does eradication of Helicobacter pylori reduce hypergastrinaemia during long term
      therapy with proton pump inhibitors?
PG  - 150-3
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of Helicobacter pylori (Hp) eradication
      therapy on blood gastrin levels in long-term PPI users, since proton pump
      inhibitors (PPIs) and Helicobacter pylori (Hp) are major causes of
      hypergastrinaemia. DESIGN: A prospective study. SUBJECTS: Twenty seven Hp (+)
      patients enrolled in the study. Twenty were given eradication treatment (ET
      group), and the rest were given symptomatic treatment (ST group). Those who
      remained Hp (+) after eradication therapy were also added into the ST group.
      Lansoprazol 30 mg/day was given to both groups for three months thereafter.
      RESULTS: Fasting and non-fasting blood gastrin levels (FGL and NFGL) were
      measured initially and one month and four months after treatment. At the end of
      fourth month, FGL was significantly higher than both initial and first month
      level (p < 0.01) in the ST group. NFGL in this group did not change significantly
      (p > 0.05) after eradication therapy. In the ET group, FGL was significantly
      higher in the fourth month than the first month (p < 0.001) and than the initial 
      level (p < 0.05). NFGL was higher, but not statistically in the fourth month than
      in the first month (p > 0.05) and significantly lower than the initial level (p <
      0.05) in this group. CONCLUSION: We suggest that testing for Hp positivity and
      treating it if detected would be an appropriate approach to avoid
      hypergastrinaemia, especially in candidate patients for long term PPI treatment.

TI  - Validation of the 13c-urea breath test for the initial diagnosis of helicobacter 
      pylori infection and to confirm eradication after treatment.
PG  - 121-6, 115-20
AB  - OBJECTIVES: the breath test with 13C-urea (UBT) is a method widely used in Spain,
      but its diagnostic accuracy has not been evaluated in a clinical trial until now.
      Our objective was to validate the UBT (TAU-KIT) both as an initial diagnostic
      method for the detection of H. pylori infection and as a method to confirm
      eradication. METHODS: a multi-centre study in 7 Spanish hospitals was performed. 
      A group of dyspeptic patients who had not previously received eradication
      treatment was included, and a second group of patients with gastric ulcer or
      upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to peptic ulcer was also included
      (eradication of H. pylori was confirmed 6 to 8 weeks after treatment completion
      with omeprazole, clarithromycin and amoxycillin). In both groups an endoscopy was
      performed with biopsies for histology and rapid urease test. Patients were
      considered infected if both tests yielded positive results, and not infected when
      both tests were negative. The UBT 13C-urea (TAU-KIT, Isomed S.L., Madrid, Spain) 
      was performed with citric acid and 100 mg of 13C-urea. The pathologist and
      persons responsible for endoscopy, urease test and UBT were all unaware of the
      results from the other diagnostic methods. RESULTS: in the pre-treatment group
      (36 patients) the prevalence of H. pylori was 72%, the area under the ROC curve
      for the diagnosis of infection with the UBT was 0.99, and the best cut-off point 
      was 5 units, with the following results: sensitivity= 96% (95% CI = 81-99%),
      specificity= 100% (69-100%), positive predictive value (PPV) = 100% (87-100%),
      negative predictive value (NPV) = 92% (59-100%), likelihood ratio (LR) + =
      infinity, and LR- = 0.04. In the post-treatment group (85 patients) the
      prevalence of H. pylori was 16%, the area under the ROC curve was 0.99, and the
      best cut point was 4.6, with the following results: sensitivity= 100% (77-100%), 
      specificity = 97% (90-99%), PPV = 88% (62-98%), NPV = 100% (95-100%), LR+ = 35,
      and LR- = 0. CONCLUSION: UBT provides excellent accuracy both for the initial
      diagnosis of H. pylori infection and to confirm eradication after treatment.

TI  - Seven-day proton pump inhibitor, amoxicillin and clarithromycin triple therapy.
      factors that influence Helicobacter pylori eradications success.
PG  - 206-9, 202-5
AB  - AIM: To evaluate which factors influence eradication success with standard triple
      therapy for Helicobacter pylori. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective study was
      made of 891 patients infected by H. pylori and diagnosed with duodenal ulcer
      (n=422), gastric ulcer (n=221), or functional dyspepsia (n=248). Initially, an
      endoscopy with biopsies of antrum and body (haematoxylin-eosin stain), and a
      13C-urea breath test were performed. All patients were treated for seven days
      with either omeprazole 20 mg twice daily in 442 patients (OCA) or pantoprazole 40
      mg twice daily in 449 patients (PCA), associated to clarithromycin (500 mg twice 
      a day) and amoxicillin (1 g twice a day). Two months after completing therapy
      urea breath test was repeated to confirm eradication. RESULTS: Mean age +/- SD
      was 51.6 +/- 15 years, 61% were male. Overall eradication rate was 73.7% (95% CI 
      69-77%) and 80.8% (77-84%) with OCA and PCA therapy, respectively, showing
      significant difference between treatment regimens (chi 2 =6.3; p= 0.01). As
      refers to underlying diseases, H. pylori eradication was achieved in 77.4%
      (74-80%) of peptic ulcers and 77% (71-82%) of functional dyspepsia (p=n.s.). With
      our two treatment regimens (OCA/PCA) eradication success was 74/81% in peptic
      ulcer (p=0.03), and 72/80% in functional dyspepsia (p=0.1). In the multivariate
      analysis, type of therapy was the only variable that correlated with eradication 
      success (odds ratio 1.5; 95% CI: 1.1-2.1) (chi2 model: 6,4; p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS:
      Standard triple therapy containing a proton pump inhibitor, clarithromycin and
      amoxicillin for seven days achieves in our community a moderate eradication
      success; this result could improve by using pantoprazole instead of omeprazole.
      This therapy is equally effective in patients with peptic ulcer and functional
      dyspepsia.

TI  - Meta-analysis: comparing the efficacy of proton pump inhibitors in short-term
      use.
PG  - 1237-45
AB  - BACKGROUND: Proton pump inhibitors have a prominent role in the management of
      acid-related diseases. Controlling expenses on proton pump inhibitors would yield
      great economic benefits for Dutch health care. AIM: To investigate whether
      clinical differences in proton pump inhibitors exist. METHODS: We searched
      Medline, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library. We identified papers in English,
      German, French or Dutch in which two or more proton pump inhibitors were compared
      under the same clinical conditions in gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, peptic
      ulcer disease or Helicobacter pylori eradication. The pooled relative risks were 
      calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel method. RESULTS: Two significant differences
      were found in the proton pump inhibitors compared. In gastro-oesophageal reflux
      disease, esomeprazole 40 mg was superior to omeprazole 20 mg (relative risk,
      1.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.14-1.23). In peptic ulcer disease, pantoprazole 
      40 mg was superior to omeprazole 20 mg (relative risk, 1.07; 95% confidence
      interval, 1.02-1.13). In Helicobacter pylori eradication, no significant
      differences were found. CONCLUSIONS: Both significant differences found were in
      favour of the highest dose of proton pump inhibitor on a milligram basis. This
      indicates that the difference may be dose dependent and not proton pump inhibitor
      specific. Therefore, when prescribing proton pump inhibitors, arguments other
      than clinical efficacy, such as those related to pharmaco-economics, may be
      considered.

TI  - Meta-analysis: proton pump inhibitor or H2-receptor antagonist for Helicobacter
      pylori eradication.
PG  - 1229-36
AB  - AIM: To compare H2-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors as adjuvants
      to triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori eradication. METHODS: H.
      pylori-infected patients with peptic ulcer were randomized to receive either 300 
      mg nizatidine or 30 mg lansoprazole plus 1 g amoxicillin and 500 mg
      clarithromycin taken b.d. for 7 days. H. pylori eradication was assessed 4 weeks 
      after therapy. Using meta-analytical techniques, we combined the results of this 
      study with other randomized controlled comparisons of H2-receptor antagonists and
      proton pump inhibitors as adjuvants to triple therapy. RESULTS: One hundred and
      one patients were randomized. H. pylori eradication was 94% (47/50) [95%
      confidence interval (CI), 83-99%] (intention-to-treat) in the H2-receptor
      antagonist group vs. 86% (44/51) (95% CI, 74-94%) in the proton pump inhibitor
      group (P = 0.3). There has been a total of 12 similar studies (1415 patients).
      The overall efficacy was similar in intention-to-treat analysis: 78% (549/701)
      with H2-receptor antagonists vs. 81% (575/714) with proton pump inhibitors (odds 
      ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.66-1.12). A non-significant trend favouring H2-receptor
      antagonist (79% vs. 69%; odds ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.76-1.71; P = 0.5) was seen
      in the comparison of clarithromycin-containing regimens. In contrast, in
      non-clarithromycin-containing trials, there was a slight, but significant,
      advantage with proton pump inhibitors (85% vs. 78%; odds ratio, 0.64; 95% CI,
      0.45-0.92; P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Overall, proton pump inhibitor and H2-receptor 
      antagonist antisecretory agents appear to be similarly effective as adjuvants for
      H. pylori triple therapy. It is unlikely that the direct anti-H. pylori effect of
      proton pump inhibitors is responsible for their ability to enhance anti-H. pylori
      therapy.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori infection and perforated peptic ulcer prevalence of the
      infection and role of antimicrobial treatment.
PG  - 159-67
AB  - Although the role of Helicobacter pylori infection on noncomplicated peptic ulcer
      disease has been definitively established, the precise relationship between the
      organism and complicated ulcer has hardly been studied. The mean prevalence of H.
      pylori infection in patients with perforated peptic ulcer is of only about
      65-70%, which contrasts with the almost 90-100% figure reported in noncomplicated
      ulcer disease. However, H. pylori infection rates in various studies range
      markedly from 0% to 100%, suggesting that differences in variables as number and 
      type of diagnostic methods used to diagnose H. pylori infection, or frequency of 
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug intake, may be responsible for the low
      prevalence reported in some studies. Recurrent ulcer disease after peptic ulcer
      perforation mainly occurs in patients with H. pylori infection, which suggests
      that the microorganism plays an important role in this complication. All patients
      with perforated peptic ulcer should be treated by simple closure of the
      perforation and with therapy aimed at healing of the ulcer and eradicating the H.
      pylori infection, as disappearance of the organism prevents, or at least
      decreases, ulcer recurrence and ulcer perforation in patients with H.
      pylori-associated perforated ulcers after simple closure. Therefore, H. pylori
      eradicating treatment should be started during the immediate postoperative
      period. The patients with intractable recurrent symptoms of peptic ulcer despite 
      adequate medical treatment, but without H. pylori infection (e.g. a patient using
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), is probably the only remaining indication 
      for elective definitive surgical treatment of peptic ulcer disease.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori eradication and gastric ulcer healing--comparison of three
      pantoprazole-based triple therapies.
PG  - 1125-35
AB  - AIM: To study the efficacy of three pantoprazole-based triple therapy regimens
      for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection and gastric ulcer healing.
      METHODS: In an open, multi-centre, randomized study, 519 H. pylori-positive
      patients with active gastric ulcer were randomized to receive pantoprazole (40
      mg) (P) and two of three antibiotics: clarithromycin (500 mg) (C), metronidazole 
      (500 mg) (M) or amoxicillin (1000 mg) (A). Triple therapy (PAC, PCM, PAM) was
      administered twice daily for 7 days, followed by pantoprazole until the ulcer had
      healed. Antrum and corpus biopsies were taken to determine the pattern of
      gastritis, to assess the H. pylori status and to determine the strain
      susceptibility to antibiotics, and from the ulcer margins and base to exclude
      malignancy. Scores based on the Sydney system were used to categorize the
      gastritis phenotypically. RESULTS: The H. pylori eradication rates for the per
      protocol (intention-to-treat) analysis were 89% (67%) for PAC, 83% (68%) for PCM 
      and 76% (60%) for PAM, with a significant difference between PAC and PAM. Healing
      rates after 4 weeks were 91% for PAM, 90% for PCM and 88% for PAC (per protocol
      analysis). The eradication rates were lower in patients in whom strains resistant
      to any antibiotic used in the triple therapies were detected. Successful
      eradication [odds ratio, 5.2 (3.3; 8.3)] and the ulcer size (< 15 mm) were
      significant predictors for healing after 4 weeks. The regimens showed a
      comparable safety profile and compliance. CONCLUSIONS: Pantoprazole-based triple 
      therapies are effective in the eradication of H. pylori infection in gastric
      ulcer patients, as reported in previous similar sized studies in duodenal ulcer
      patients. Successful eradication and an ulcer size of < 15 mm are the best
      predictors of gastric ulcer healing after 4 weeks.

TI  - Globus sensation and gastroesophageal reflux.
PG  - 273-6
AB  - Recent studies suggest that gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) may be a major
      cause of globus sensation. However, the incidence and severity of GERD in
      patients with globus sensation without reflux symptoms are unknown. In order to
      establish the relationship between globus sensation in the jugular fossa and
      GERD, 20 patients attending our ear, nose and throat (ENT) outpatient clinic with
      globus sensation were investigated with 24-h pH monitoring. A four-channel pH
      catheter was used with the pH electrodes spaced 5 cm apart in order to detect
      reflux along the whole length of the esophagus. Fifteen patients complained about
      globus sensation only; five patients complained additionally about classical
      reflux symptoms. Thirteen patients showed pathologic reflux measurements. Most of
      the patients had reflux limited to the distal one-third of the esophagus.
      Patients with pathologic pH measurements were treated with proton pump
      inhibitors. Ten out of 13 patients improved with treatment. This study suggests
      that globus may be associated with reflux, and acidity does not have to reach the
      pharynx to produce globus sensation.

TI  - A pharmacoeconomic comparison of the efficacy and costs of pantoprazole and
      omeprazole for the treatment of peptic ulcer or gastroesophageal reflux disease
      in The Netherlands.
PG  - 635-46
AB  - BACKGROUND: The focus of treatment of patients with peptic ulcer or
      gastroesuphageal reflux disease has changed during the last 15 years, with a
      shift from histamine2-receptor antagonists to proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs). From
      1993 to 2000, expenditures for omeprazole (90% of total market share of PPIs)
      increased in The Netherlands from 68 million euros to 230 million euros. In 1999,
      expenditures for pantoprazole accounted for the majority of the rest of the
      market share for PPIs. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the 
      efficacy and costs of treatment with pantoprazole and omeprazole in The
      Netherlands. METHODS: First, we reviewed clinical studies that compared the
      efficacy of different dosages of omeprazole and pantoprazole. Second, we analyzed
      data from a nationwide database of drug prescriptions to determine the dosages
      used in daily practice in 1999. The data were based on a representative sample of
      approximately 40% of the Dutch community pharmacies. Third, we modeled the
      outcome of potential substitution of pantoprazole for omeprazole and the
      corresponding scenarios for nationwide cost savings using the prescription
      information from the nationwide database. Potential savings within the Dutch
      health care system were estimated. RESULTS: The 1999 prescription data indicated 
      that pantoprazole treatment cost a mean 1.59 euros/d, compared with 2.12 euros/d 
      for omeprazole (1.00 euro = 1.0487 US dollars). The mean cost per defined daily
      dose of omeprazole was 1.65 euros, compared with 1.59 euros for pantoprazole.
      Following the summary of product characteristics, treatment with pantoprazole
      appeared to be less costly for all indications. The projected annual cost savings
      for substituting pantoprazole for omeprazole on 90% of treatment days were
      estimated at 40.8 million euros. However, these projected savings may be offset
      by the costs of switching and the costs of upward dose adjustments that some
      patients may require. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the available documentation about
      effectiveness and costs of omeprazole and pantoprazole, pantoprazole may provide 
      a more favorable pharmacoeconomic profile than omeprazole. However, this is only 
      true if the substitution of omeprazole by pantoprazole can be achieved without
      loss of efficacy or tolerability.

TI  - Lansoprazole overutilization: methods for step-down therapy.
PG  - 353-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the documented indications for long-term therapy with
      lansoprazole 30 mg twice daily at the Veterans Affairs Pittsburgh Healthcare
      System, assess compliance with appropriate use criteria, evaluate patients
      eligible for step-down therapy, and recommend appropriate step-down therapy in
      order to improve patient care, decrease overprescribing, and reduce medication
      costs. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective intervention. METHODS: The records of all
      patients with prescriptions for lansoprazole 30 mg twice daily as of June 2000
      were reviewed. Patients were interviewed to assess medication compliance and
      symptom control and to provide education on lifestyle modifications.
      Interventions with the providers were completed to encourage step-down therapy in
      appropriate patients. RESULTS: Two hundred forty-eight patients with active
      prescriptions for twice-daily lansoprazole were reviewed. Of these patients, 66% 
      (n = 163) did not have an indication compliant with the medical center's
      guidelines for use of lansoprazole 30 mg twice daily. Of these, 88% (n = 143) had
      no documented attempt at step-down therapy and 49% (n = 80) had no documented
      gastrointestinal workup. Interventions for step-down therapy were recommended for
      48% (n = 120) of the 248 patients. Forty-six percent (n = 60) of recommendations 
      were accepted, resulting in a cost savings of dollars 85000 per year.
      CONCLUSIONS: A high rate of clinician noncompliance with the guidelines for
      appropriate use of lansoprazole 30 mg twice daily was found. These prescribing
      patterns resulted in significant cost concerns. Our review and interventions led 
      to step-down therapy for almost half of the patients receiving twice-daily
      lansoprazole. This review of patient records and intervention with primary care
      providers resulted in cost reduction and offered an opportunity to educate
      patients on beneficial lifestyle modifications.

PG  - 6-13
AB  - AIM: To compare the efficacy and tolerability of pantoprazole 40 mg and
      omeprazole MUPS 40 mg in patients with moderate to severe gastroesophageal reflux
      disease (GERD). METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, parallel-group,
      multicenter study conducted in Austria, Germany, Portugal, Switzerland and The
      Netherlands, patients with endoscopically confirmed moderate to severe GERD
      (Savary/Miller esophagitis grade II/III) were enrolled. They received a
      once-daily dose of either 40 mg pantoprazole or 40 mg omeprazole MUPS. Healing
      was determined by endoscopy after 4 weeks of treatment. If patients were not
      healed, treatment was extended for another 4 weeks. An additional endoscopy was
      performed in these cases after 8 weeks of treatment. Healing was determined by
      endoscopy after 4 and 8 weeks. In addition, treatment effect on symptoms was
      evaluated by the investigator using a questionnaire assessing heartburn, reflux
      regurgitation and pain on swallowing at each visit, as well as by a
      self-administered questionnaire comprising further 24 gastrointestinal symptoms. 
      Analyses were performed for the intention-to-treat (ITT) and the per-protocol
      (PP) population. In addition, patients with high compliance (HC: 90% </=110%)
      were considered in a separate group. Adverse events and the influence of the
      Helicobacter pylori status were investigated. RESULTS: A total of 669 outpatients
      were enrolled in the study, with 337 patients receiving pantoprazole and 332
      omeprazole MUPS. The PP population consisted of 552 patients, 282 treated with
      pantoprazole and 270 with omeprazole MUPS. The healing rates in both treatment
      groups were shown to be equivalent and were higher in patients who adhered
      closely to the administration protocol (HC). According to ITT (ITT(HC)) analyses,
      healing rates were 65.3% (77.4%) in the pantoprazole and 66.3% (74.7%) in the
      omeprazole group after 4 weeks. Furthermore, patients infected with H. pylori had
      slightly but not significantly higher healing rates than those with a negative
      test result. The safety profile of both treatments was comparable. CONCLUSION:
      Pantoprazole 40 mg and omeprazole MUPS 40 mg were equivalent with respect to
      healing after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment in patients with reflux esophagitis
      grade II/III. Overall, HC patients had higher healing rates than the regular
      compliant patients. Both drugs were well tolerated and safe.

TI  - Lansoprazole fast disintegrating tablet: a new formulation for an established
      proton pump inhibitor.
PG  - 1-5
AB  - Lansoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) which is an effective and
      well-tolerated treatment option in the management of acid-related disorders.
      Lansoprazole fast disintegrating tablet (LFDT)--a new, patient-friendly and more 
      convenient formulation of lansoprazole which can be taken with or without
      water--is the first PPI to be made available as an orally disintegrating tablet. 
      It represents an innovative drug delivery system, comprising enteric-coated
      microgranules of lansoprazole compressed with an inactive, rapidly dispersing
      matrix to form a tablet. When the tablet is placed on the tongue and sucked
      gently it disintegrates rapidly in the mouth, releasing the enteric-coated
      microgranules which are swallowed with the patient's saliva without water.
      Alternatively, the tablet can be swallowed with a drink of water. Studies have
      shown that the bioavailability of LFDT is comparable to lansoprazole capsules, at
      both 15 and 30 mg doses; the indications and recommended dosages for LFDT are
      therefore identical to lansoprazole capsules. The new formulation may be of
      particular benefit to those with active life-styles who do not always have water 
      available, patients who have difficulty in swallowing, and elderly patients.

TI  - Elemental diet is an effective treatment for eosinophilic esophagitis in children
      and adolescents.
PG  - 777-82
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), a disorder characterized by
      eosinophilic infiltration of the esophageal mucosa, has been defined in large
      part through published case reports and series leading to ambiguity in both
      diagnostic and treatment options. Corticosteroids, cromolyn, and elemental diet
      have all been reported as successful treatments for EoE. In this study, we sought
      to accurately define a population of patients with EoE and then assess their
      response to elemental diet. METHODS: A series of patients with chronic symptoms
      of gastroesophageal reflux disease and an isolated esophageal eosinophilia on
      esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) were identified. Therapy with a proton pump
      inhibitor was instituted for 3 months, followed by repeat EGD when symptoms
      persisted. A 24-h pH probe study was performed, and those with significantly
      abnormal studies were excluded. The remaining patients were diagnosed with EoE
      and placed on an elemental diet for 1 month, followed by a repeat EGD. RESULTS:
      Of 346 patients with chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms and
      eosinophils on esophageal biopsy, 51 (14.7%) were ultimately diagnosed with EoE. 
      There was significant improvement in vomiting, abdominal pain, and dysphagia
      after the elemental diet. The median number of esophageal eosinophils per
      high-powered field (HPF) decreased from 33.7 before the diet to 1.0 after the
      diet (p <0.01). The average time to clinical improvement was 8.5 days.
      CONCLUSIONS: Elemental diet resulted in striking improvement in both symptoms and
      histologic evidence of disease in children and adolescents with EoE, as
      identified by strict diagnostic criteria.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Limitations of catheter-based esophageal pH monitoring are discomfort,
      inconvenience, and interference with normal activity. An alternative to
      conventional pH monitoring is the wireless Medtronic Bravo pH System. The aim of 
      this study was to evaluate the safety, performance, and tolerability of this
      system. METHODS: A total of 44 healthy subjects and 41 patients with
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) were studied for a 2-day period. The pH
      telemetry capsule was positioned transorally 6 cm above the squamocolumnar
      junction using endoscopic measurement. The signal transmitted from the capsule
      was received and recorded by a small, pager-sized receiver, and pH data were
      subsequently uploaded to a computer for analysis. RESULTS: Successful 24-h pH
      studies were completed in 82 subjects (96%). During the 24-h study period the
      median percentage of the time that pH was <4 was 2.3% (95th percentile, 5.9%) in 
      controls and 6.5% (range, 0.8-27.6) in GERD patients. In 76 subjects (89%), 36-48
      h recordings were obtained. For the extended period the median percentage of the 
      time that pH was <40 was 2.0% (95% percentile, 5.3%) in controls and 6.6% (range,
      1.0-26.7) in GERD patients. Capsules required endoscopic removal in three
      subjects (4%). Optimal sensitivity in distinguishing controls from reflux
      patients was achieved when analyzed from the perspective of the worst of the 2
      days. CONCLUSIONS: The wireless Bravo pH System successfully recorded esophageal 
      acid exposure in 96% of the patients during a 24-h period and in 89% of subjects 
      for >36 h. The 95th percentile for the 2-day recordings in control subjects was
      5.3%, slightly higher than observed with conventional systems.

TI  - Paradigm shift in the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 638-47; discussion 648-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the short-term results of the radiofrequency treatment of
      the gastroesophageal junction known as the Stretta procedure versus laparoscopic 
      fundoplication (LF) in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
      SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The Stretta procedure has been shown to be safe, well
      tolerated, and highly effective in the treatment of GERD. METHODS: All patients
      presenting to Vanderbilt University Medical Center for surgical evaluation of
      GERD between August 2000 and March 2002 were prospectively evaluated under an
      IRB-approved protocol. All patients underwent esophageal motility testing and
      endoscopy that documented GERD preoperatively, either by a positive 24-hour pH
      study or biopsy-proven esophagitis. Patients were offered the Stretta procedure
      if they had documented GERD and did not have a hiatal hernia larger than 2 cm,
      LES pressure less than 8 mmHg, or Barrett's esophagus. Patients with larger
      hiatal hernias, LES pressure less than 8 mmHg, or Barrett's were offered LF. All 
      patients were studied pre- and postoperatively with validated GERD-specific
      quality-of-life questionnaires (QOLRAD) and short-form health surveys (SF-12).
      Current medication use and satisfaction with the procedure was also obtained.
      RESULTS: Results are reported as mean +/- SEM. Seventy-five patients (age 49 +/- 
      14 years, 44% male, 56% female) underwent LF and 65 patients (age 46 +/- 12
      years, 42%, 58% female) underwent the Stretta procedure. Preoperative esophageal 
      acid exposure time was higher in the LF group. Preoperative LES pressure was
      higher in the Stretta group. In the LF group, 41% had large hiatal hernias (>2
      cm), 8 patients required Collis gastroplasty, 6 had Barrett's esophagus, and 10
      had undergone previous fundoplication. At 6 months, the QOLRAD and SF-12 scores
      were significantly improved within both groups. There was an equal magnitude of
      improvement between pre- and postoperative QOLRAD and SF-12 scores between
      Stretta and LF patients. Fifty-eight percent of Stretta patients were off proton 
      pump inhibitors, and an additional 31% had reduced their dose significantly; 97% 
      of LF patients were off PPIs. Twenty-two Stretta patients returned for 24-hour pH
      testing at a mean of 7.2 +/- 0.5 months, and there was a significant reduction in
      esophageal acid exposure time. Both groups were highly satisfied with their
      procedure. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of a less invasive, endoscopic treatment for
      GERD to the surgical algorithm has allowed the authors to stratify the management
      of GERD patients to treatment with either Stretta or LF according to size of
      hiatal hernia, LES pressure, Barrett's esophagus, and significant pulmonary
      symptoms. Patients undergoing Stretta are highly satisfied and have improved GERD
      symptoms and quality of life comparable to LF. The Stretta procedure is an
      effective alternative to LF in well-selected patients.

TI  - Effects of antireflux treatment on bronchial hyper-responsiveness and lung
      function in asthmatic patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 1123-5
AB  - AIM: To investigate the effects of antireflux treatment on bronchial
      hyper-responsiveness and lung function in asthmatic patients with
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). METHODS: Thirty asthmatic patients with
      GERD were randomly divided into two groups (group A and group B). Patients in
      group A (n=15) only received asthma medication including inhaled salbutamol 200
      microg four times a day and budesonide 400 microg twice a day for 6 weeks.
      Patients in Group B (n=15) received the same medication as group A, and also
      antireflux therapy including oral omeprazole 20 mg once a day and domperidone 10 
      mg three times a day for 6 weeks. Pulmonary function tests and histamine
      bronchoprovocation test were performed before and after the study. RESULTS: There
      was no significant difference in the baseline values of pulmonary function and
      histamine PC(20-FEV1) between the two groups. At the end of the study, the mean
      values for VC, VC%, FVC, FVC%, FEV(1), FEV(1)%, PEF, PEF%, PC(20-FEV1) were all
      significantly improved in group B, compared with group A. CONCLUSION: Antireflux 
      therapy may improve pulmonary function and inhibit bronchial hyper-responsiveness
      in asthmatic patients with GERD.

TI  - A cost-effectiveness analysis of stress ulcer prophylaxis.
PG  - 631-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and cost of using cimetidine,
      famotidine, and lansoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) at our
      institution and determine which agent was most cost-effective. METHODS: An
      observational study of adults admitted to the medical, surgical, or
      cardiovascular intensive care unit was conducted to compare the cost and
      effectiveness of cimetidine, famotidine, and lansoprazole for SUP. Patients were 
      identified for inclusion during three 2-week periods in 2000. Medical record
      reviews were conducted to gather data regarding the costs associated with the
      administration of SUP drugs and the treatment of any adverse events or
      therapeutic failures. Decision analysis was used to determine the average cost
      per patient for each treatment arm. A cost-effectiveness analysis was then
      conducted to determine which of the SUP agents was associated with the least cost
      without adversely affecting patient outcomes. A sensitivity analysis was applied 
      to determine the robustness of the data. RESULTS: Eighty-eight patients were
      included in the analysis. Five of the patients started on cimetidine experienced 
      therapeutic failure, whereas no patients receiving lansoprazole experienced
      therapeutic failure. For these reasons, and because lansoprazole is an oral
      agent, the average costs associated with lansoprazole use were lower than with
      the use of cimetidine. Lansoprazole was found to be the most cost-effective
      therapy. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that lansoprazole is a cost-effective
      agent for the use of SUP at our institution. However, due to the higher cost of
      intravenous pantoprazole, the model demonstrates that, assuming equal
      effectiveness, intravenous pantoprazole would not be cost-effective when compared
      with cimetidine.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori infection does not affect the early rebleeding rate in
      patients with peptic ulcer bleeding after successful endoscopic hemostasis: a
      prospective single-center trial.
PG  - 393-6
AB  - BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection can
      reduce the rebleeding rate of peptic ulcer bleeding in the long term. There are
      few data on the influence of H. pylori on the rebleeding rate in the acute phase 
      of bleeding however. We therefore prospectively investigated the influence of H. 
      pylori infection on the early rebleeding rate in patients who had undergone
      successful endoscopic hemostasis treatment for peptic ulcer bleeding. PATIENTS
      AND METHODS: Between January 1996 and November 2000 all patients with peptic
      ulcer bleeding were evaluated consecutively. The diagnosis of H. pylori infection
      was made at index endoscopy, using histology and the rapid urease test. Bleeding 
      activity was assessed using the Forrest classification. After successful
      endoscopic hemostasis all patients received omeprazole 40 mg or pantoprazole 40
      mg, intravenously, twice a day for 3 days. Rebleeding episodes were recorded over
      21 days following primary hemostasis. RESULTS: 344 patients were enrolled into
      the study. The prevalence of H. pylori infection was 62.9 %. A total of 51
      patients showed rebleeding (14.8 %), of whom 31 were H. pylori-positive (60 %).
      There was no statistically significant difference between the H. pylori-positive 
      and -negative patients, however. The rebleeding rate did not differ between
      patients with H. pylori infection alone and patients also using nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs. When stratifying patients according to activity of
      bleeding at index endoscopy, we were also unable to find any significant
      influence of H. pylori infection on the outcome of Forrest class I and IIa
      bleedings. CONCLUSION: Based on our data, it can be concluded that H. pylori
      infection does not affect the early rebleeding rate in patients with peptic ulcer
      bleeding after successful endoscopic hemostasis.

TI  - Outcome trials of COX-2 selective inhibitors: global safety evaluation does not
      promise benefits.
PG  - 169-75
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal toxicity is the most frequent adverse effect
      associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use. The most clinically
      relevant side effects of this toxicity are ulcer complications, including
      perforation, obstruction, or bleeding. Selective cyclooxygenase (COX-2)
      inhibitors (coxibs) have been proposed as a safer alternative to traditional,
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and they are currently widely used in
      clinical practice. The aim of this review was to analyze the available evidence
      and then critically evaluate the outcome trials supporting the use of coxibs in
      terms of their clinical gastrointestinal benefits and global safety. METHODS: All
      published clinical trials on selective COX-2 inhibitors were identified by
      searching Medline, the World Wide Web (WWW), and abstracts in Congress
      proceedings. From these, we selected randomized trials that clinically evaluated 
      relevant safety outcome measures. Papers only describing endoscopic evaluation
      were excluded. RESULTS: Our search yielded three outcome trials and two pooled
      safety analyses. The outcome studies supporting the gastrointestinal and global
      safety of coxibs were found to be biased in their design, analysis, and
      dissemination, and interpretation of a clinical benefit. Cost considerations
      would make the use of coxibs acceptable only in patients at high gastrointestinal
      risk. CONCLUSIONS: The association of the reduced gastroerosive potential of
      coxibs with improved meaningful outcomes is debatable. Bias in the design of the 
      trials, selection of outcome measures, post-hoc changes in analysis and the
      variables used, as well as flaws in the publication and reporting of trial
      results cast serious doubts on the gastrointestinal and global safety profile of 
      coxibs. In addition, their high cost and the lack of clear identification of
      patients that would benefit most from treatment means the effectiveness of these 
      drugs is uncertain at the moment.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of 7-day rabeprazole- and omeprazole-based triple therapy
      regimens for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori in patients with documented
      peptic ulcer disease.
PG  - 1065-74
AB  - AIM: A double-blind, randomized study was designed to determine whether
      rabeprazole- and omeprazole-based triple therapy regimens are therapeutically
      equivalent in the eradication of Helicobacter pylori. METHODS: Three hundred and 
      forty-five patients with current or previously active peptic ulcer and a positive
      H. pylori urease test were randomly assigned to receive RCA, OCA, RCM or OCM
      twice daily for 7 days (R, rabeprazole 20 mg; O, omeprazole 20 mg; C,
      clarithromycin 500 mg; A, amoxicillin 1000 mg; M, metronidazole 400 mg). H.
      pylori eradication was documented by negative 13C-urea breath tests at 4 and 12
      weeks, and was evaluated using a 2 x 2 factorial design with proton pump
      inhibitor and antibiotic as factors. RESULTS: Overall eradication rates (per
      protocol/intention-to-treat) were 87%/77% and 85%/75% with rabeprazole and
      omeprazole, respectively (not significant). However, a statistical interaction
      between proton pump inhibitor and antibiotic was identified. RCA produced a
      somewhat higher eradication rate than OCA (94% vs. 84%; difference, 9.8%; 95%
      confidence interval, - 0.7% to + 20.4%), whereas RCM produced a lower eradication
      rate than OCM (79% vs. 86%; difference, 8.1%; 95% confidence interval, - 21.4% to
      + 5.1%). Ulcer healing rates were > 90% with H. pylori eradication. Each regimen 
      was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Rabeprazole- and omeprazole-based triple therapy
      regimens are therapeutically equivalent in the eradication of H. pylori and well 
      tolerated. The statistical interaction observed between the proton pump inhibitor
      and supplementary antibiotic may be due to chance.

TI  - Reflux symptoms in general practice: diagnostic evaluation of the Carlsson-Dent
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease questionnaire.
PG  - 1049-55
AB  - BACKGROUND: Amongst primary care patients with dyspeptic symptoms, those with
      reflux-like symptoms or gastro-oesophageal reflux disease are expected to benefit
      most from empirical proton pump inhibitor therapy. Recognition of this patient
      group, however, is difficult. The Carlsson-Dent gastro-oesophageal reflux disease
      questionnaire was developed to justify the selection of primary care patients for
      empirical proton pump inhibitor treatment. AIM: To evaluate the diagnostic test
      characteristics of the Carlsson-Dent questionnaire in a primary care population. 
      METHODS: A prospective, open-label, multi-centre diagnostic prevalence study was 
      conducted amongst primary care adults with reflux symptoms. All patients
      completed the questionnaire and underwent gastroscopy. If no abnormalities were
      found, the patients were prescribed 2 weeks of treatment with omeprazole (20 mg
      daily). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to determine
      the overall discriminative value of the questionnaire. Diagnostic test
      characteristics of both the cut-off score (total diagnostic score) in the
      questionnaire and the physician's provisional classification were measured using 
      oesophagitis and omeprazole treatment success as the reference tests. RESULTS: Of
      the 536 patients included, 515 underwent endoscopy. No abnormalities were found
      in 286 (55%). Omeprazole treatment success occurred more frequently in patients
      with a total diagnostic score of > 7 and oesophagitis II-IV in patients with a
      total diagnostic score of > 9. The diagnostic test characteristics of the
      questionnaire were comparable with those of the physician's provisional
      classification. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve did
      not exceed 0.65. Kappa values for observer agreement with the gold standard were 
      far below 0.4. CONCLUSION: The diagnostic performance of this version of the
      Carlsson-Dent questionnaire was poor. It equalled the physician's clinical
      judgement and therefore its value for clinical use is limited.

TI  - Evidence-based analysis: postoperative gastric bleeding: etiology and prevention.
PG  - 9-19
AB  - Although the incidence of stomach hemorrhage is declining, stress-related gastric
      bleeding remains an important source of morbidity and mortality in cancer
      patients undergoing major surgical procedures to remove tumor. Prevention of
      stress-related bleeding is desirable; however, the optimal use of drugs to
      prevent gastric bleeding is unclear. Prophylaxis is recommended for surgical
      patients who require prolonged mechanical ventilation or have a coaguloathy.
      Histamine-2 receptor antagonists and sucralfate will reduce the likelihood of
      clinically important gastric-bleeding. Sucralfate appears to be less effective
      than H-2 blockers, but it is associated with fewer side effects such as
      nosocomial pneumonia. Preliminary studies show that proton pump inhibitors are
      most effective, have few side effects, but are most expensive. Intravenous proton
      pump inhibitors may be the drugs of choice for stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) in 
      high-risk patients.

TI  - Pharmacogenetics of the proton pump inhibitors: a systematic review.
PG  - 460-71
AB  - Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 mediates the major metabolic transformations of the
      proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) omeprazole, pantoprazole, lansoprazole,
      esomeprazole, and rabeprazole. Genetic polymorphism of CYP2C19 can lead to
      significant phenotypic variation in the activity of this isoenzyme and thus in
      the metabolism of PPIs. We systematically reviewed the pharmacogenetic studies of
      PPIs with respect to the effects of CYP2C19 polymorphism on the clinical outcomes
      of PPI therapy. We searched MEDLINE (January 1966-August 2002) and EMBASE
      (January 1988-August 2002) for English-language articles on the pharmacogenetics 
      of PPIs; the search was supplemented by a bibliographic review of all relevant
      articles. Seventeen pertinent citations were identified, and the quality (level) 
      of evidence for each was categorized according to the rating scale of the United 
      States Preventive Services Task Force. We found that the relationship between
      CYP2C19 genetic polymorphism and clinical outcomes after PPI therapy has not yet 
      been clearly delineated. Virtually all pharmacogenetic studies of PPIs have been 
      performed in Japanese men; thus, the clinical relevance of CYP2C19 genetic
      polymorphism in non-Asian patients and women is unknown. Differences among dual- 
      and triple-therapy drug regimens make it difficult to compare H. pylori
      eradication studies and assess their applicability to current practice patterns. 
      Drug adherence, a pivotal factor in the success of eradication therapy, was
      addressed in only four trials. Future directions for research include performing 
      more studies with larger sample sizes, particularly in non-Asian populations and 
      women; measuring plasma PPI concentrations to directly correlate H. pylori
      infection and ulcer cure rates with plasma drug availability; expanding the study
      population to patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease; and exploring the
      influence of CYP3A4 in the success or failure of PPI therapy. Although CYP2C19
      genotyping is currently only a research instrument, it may be a valuable clinical
      tool in select patients to ensure optimal PPI therapy.

TI  - Endoluminal therapies for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 1119-21
AB  - CONTEXT: Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is a common chronic disorder
      that has severe impact on quality of life and often requires continuous
      acid-suppression therapy. Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are extremely effective
      but expensive, and do not restore the normal antireflux barrier at the
      gastro-oesophageal junction. Antireflux surgery, even with the laparoscopic
      approach, has not proven more cost-effective than maintenance therapy with PPIs. 
      Postoperative morbidity is substantial, especially when procedures are done
      outside expert centres. In the past few years several endoscopic techniques have 
      been developed to treat chronic GORD on an outpatient basis. These techniques
      include radiofrequency-energy delivery and endoscopic suturing, although other
      approaches are now under development. STARING POINT: Two prospective open-label
      studies have recently reported 1-year follow-up of GORD patients treated either
      by radiofrequency-energy delivery (G Triadafilopoulos and colleagues Gastrointest
      Endosc 2002; 55:149-56) or endoscopic suturing (Z Mahmood and colleagues Gut
      2003; 52:34-39). In a US multicentre trial, Triadafilopoulos and colleagues
      delivered radiofrequency energy to the cardia and distal oesophagus in patients
      with chronic heartburn, regurgitation or both (the Stretta procedure). All
      patients were on continuous acid-suppression therapy, but none had severe
      oesophagitis or hiatus hernia of more than 2 cm. At 12 months, 94 patients
      available for follow-up showed significant improvement in GORD symptoms, quality 
      of life, and oesophageal acid-exposure. The need for PPI therapy fell from 98% to
      30% of patients. In the Mahmood study, 26 similar patients had endoscopic
      suturing in a single centre. After 1 year, symptoms and quality of life improved 
      and the need for PPIs was reduced to 36% from 100%. In both studies, only minor
      complications occurred, none of which required specific therapeutic intervention.
      WHERE NEXT? An effective outpatient procedure to treat chronic GORD would
      represent a major step forward. However, further studies are needed before an
      endoscopic approach can be adopted, as none of the published trials are
      well-controlled studies. Longer follow-up is needed to ensure that relapses do
      not occur rapidly, complications do not occur more frequently with less skilled
      operators, or that endoscopic-induced changes do not complicate or compromise
      subsequent antireflux surgery. Comparative studies of the cost-effectiveness of
      endoscopic therapy should also include medical strategies such as intermittent or
      on-demand PPI therapy.

TI  - Empiric esomeprazole in the treatment of laryngopharyngeal reflux.
PG  - 598-601
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Objectives were to determine the efficacy of empiric treatment with
      esomeprazole for patients diagnosed with laryngopharyngeal reflux and to
      determine a treatment paradigm for this patient population. STUDY DESIGN:
      Prospective study. METHODS: Patients were treated with a once-daily dose of 40 mg
      esomeprazole for 8 weeks. All patients completed a subjective symptom scale
      (rating laryngeal symptoms and esophageal symptoms) and scoring of flexible
      fiberoptic examination before treatment and at 4 and 8 weeks of treatment.
      Nonresponders (<50% reduction in symptom score) were recommended to undergo
      24-hour dual-probe pH study while on a regimen of 40 mg esomeprazole once a day, 
      to evaluate for the adequacy of acid suppression. RESULTS: Thirty patients
      completed the course of therapy. After 4 weeks of treatment, only 8 of 30
      patients had significant improvement of their overall symptoms (8 of 30 improved 
      on laryngeal score, and 11 of 18 improved on esophageal score). At 8 weeks of
      treatment, 19 of 30 patients had significant improvement on their overall
      symptoms (18 of 30 on laryngeal score, and 13 of 18 on their esophageal score).
      Five of seven nonresponders who agreed to be tested had positive findings on pH
      studies (on medication regimen) at 1 cm above the upper esophageal sphincter.
      Four of 10 nonresponders improved further after increasing their dosage to 40 mg 
      twice a day. Laryngeal examination scores were statistically improved in
      responders after 8 weeks of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Laryngopharyngeal reflux
      symptoms require at least 8 weeks of treatment for significant improvement in the
      majority of patients. Esophageal symptoms improve sooner. Nonresponders at a
      daily dose of 40 mg should be treated with a dosage of 40 mg twice daily, and pH 
      study on medication reserved for nonresponders at this higher dose. Laryngeal
      examination scores showed mild but statistically significant improvement at 8
      weeks of therapy in responders.

TI  - Lafutidine, a novel histamine H2-receptor antagonist, vs lansoprazole in
      combination with amoxicillin and clarithromycin for eradication of Helicobacter
      pylori.
PG  - 111-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: In contrast to the growing amount of data concerning proton pump
      inhibitor-based triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection, it is still
      controversial whether proton pump inhibitor can be replaced by H2 receptor
      antagonist without compromising efficacy. Lafutidine is a novel potent H2
      receptor antagonist with gastroprotective activities such as enhancement of
      gastric mucosal blood flow. METHODS: 122 outpatients with positive cultures and
      subsequent successful cultivation of H. pylori for antimicrobial susceptibility
      tests were randomized to receive a 7-day course of either lafutidine (20 mg twice
      daily) or lansoprazole (30 mg twice daily), plus clarithromycin (200 mg twice
      daily) and amoxicillin (750 mg twice daily). Eradication was considered
      successful if the rapid urease test, culture, histology and [13]C-urea breath
      test were all negative at least 4 weeks after cessation of therapy. Cytochrome
      p450 2C19 genotype status using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment
      length polymorphism was also studied. RESULTS: On intention-to-treat basis, H.
      pylori cure was achieved in 52 of 61 (85.2%) patients and 49 of 61 (80.3%)
      patients for the lafutidine- and lansoprazole-based therapies, respectively. The 
      predicted 95% confidential intervals for the 4.9% of the difference were
      -1.8-11.6%. Using per protocol analysis, the eradication rates were 88.2% (52/59)
      and 84.5% (49/58), respectively. The predicted 95% confidential intervals for the
      3.7% of the difference were -2.6-10.0%. Adverse events were observed in five and 
      six patients, from the lafutidine and lansoprazole groups, respectively, but they
      were generally mild. Genetic predisposition of cytochrome p450 2C19 had no
      significant influence on treatment outcome in both regimens. CONCLUSIONS: The
      lafutidine-clarithromycin-amoxicillin therapy yielded satisfactory results for
      eradicating H. pylori, which was comparable with those of the lansoprazole-based 
      regimen with the same drug combination.

TI  - 'Rescue' therapy with rifabutin after multiple Helicobacter pylori treatment
      failures.
PG  - 90-4
AB  - AIM: Eradication therapy with proton pump inhibitor, clarithromycin and
      amoxicillin is extensively used, although it fails in a considerable number of
      cases. A 'rescue' therapy with a quadruple combination of omeprazole, bismuth,
      tetracycline and metronidazole (or ranitidine bismuth citrate with these same
      antibiotics) has been recommended, but it still fails in approximately 20% of
      cases. Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a rifabutin-based
      regimen in patients with two consecutive H. pylori eradication failures. PATIENTS
      AND METHODS: Design: Prospective multicenter study. Patients: Consecutive
      patients in whom a first eradication trial with omeprazole, clarithromycin and
      amoxicillin and a second trial with omeprazole, bismuth, tetracycline and
      metronidazole (three patients) or ranitidine bismuth citrate with these same
      antibiotics (11 patients) had failed were included. Intervention: A third
      eradication regimen with rifabutin (150 mg bid), amoxicillin (1 g bid) and
      omeprazole (20 mg bid) was prescribed for 14 days. All drugs were administered
      together after breakfast and dinner. Compliance with therapy was determined from 
      the interrogatory and the recovery of empty envelopes of medications. Outcome: H.
      pylori eradication was defined as a negative 13C-urea breath test 8 weeks after
      completing therapy. RESULTS: Fourteen patients have been included. Mean age +/-
      SD was 42 +/- 11 years, 41% males, peptic ulcer (57%), functional dyspepsia
      (43%). All patients took all the medications and completed the study protocol.
      Per-protocol and intention-to-treat eradication was achieved in 11/14 patients
      (79%; 95% confidence interval = 49-95%). Adverse effects were reported in five
      patients (36%), and included: abdominal pain (three patients), nausea and
      vomiting (one patient), and oral candidiasis (one patient); no patient abandoned 
      the treatment due to adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Rifabutin-based rescue therapy 
      constitutes an encouraging strategy after multiple previous eradication failures 
      with key antibiotics such as amoxicillin, clarithromycin, metronidazole and
      tetracycline.

TI  - Determination of the reduction in gastric acidity necessary to prevent
      pathological oesophageal reflux in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux
      disease treated with a proton pump inhibitor.
PG  - 955-64
AB  - BACKGROUND: In subjects with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease treated with a
      gastric antisecretory agent, the extent to which gastric acidity needs to be
      reduced to prevent pathological oesophageal acid exposure is not known. METHODS: 
      Gastric and oesophageal pH were measured in 26 healthy subjects and in 59
      subjects with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. In 27 of the subjects with
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, pH was also recorded on days 1, 2 and 8 of
      treatment with 20 mg omeprazole and 20 mg rabeprazole in a randomized, two-way,
      cross-over fashion. RESULTS: Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used 
      to determine values for the integrated oesophageal acidity and time oesophageal
      pH<or=4 that gave optimal cut-off points for distinguishing between normal and
      pathological oesophageal reflux. Using these cut-off points, we found that the
      probability of no pathological oesophageal reflux (Y) could be best fitted by an 
      exponential equation, Y = a(e-bX) + c, where a, b and c are constants and X is
      the value of the integrated gastric acidity. There was close agreement between
      the predicted and observed percentages of subjects with pathological oesophageal 
      reflux during different days of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In subjects with
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease treated with a proton pump inhibitor, the value
      of the integrated gastric acidity can predict the likelihood of pathological
      oesophageal reflux.

TI  - Meal-stimulated gastric acid secretion and integrated gastric acidity in
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 945-53
AB  - BACKGROUND: No current methods exist to determine meal-stimulated gastric acid
      secretion in humans under conditions that approximate those of daily living with 
      the ingestion of breakfast, lunch and dinner. METHODS: Gastric and oesophageal pH
      were measured in 26 healthy subjects and in 59 subjects with gastro-oesophageal
      reflux disease. Meal-stimulated gastric acid secretion was calculated from the
      buffer capacity of the meals determined in vitro and from the time required for
      the gastric pH to decrease to pH 2 in vivo following ingestion of the meal.
      RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between gastric secretion with each 
      meal and the corresponding post-prandial integrated gastric acidity. There was
      also a significant correlation between meal-stimulated gastric secretion and
      integrated gastric acidity from 09.00 to 22.00 h in both subjects with
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and controls. In subjects with
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, gastric secretion and integrated gastric
      acidity from 09.00 to 22.00 h were significantly higher than those in controls.
      There was a significant correlation between oesophageal acidity and integrated
      gastric acidity from 09.00 to 22.00 h in subjects with gastro-oesophageal reflux 
      disease. CONCLUSIONS: As post-prandial gastric acidity is increased in subjects
      with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, it seems likely that increased gastric
      acidity is an important aetiological factor in this disease.

      metronidazole, and tetracycline given with omeprazole versus omeprazole,
      amoxicillin, and clarithromycin for eradication of Helicobacter pylori in
      duodenal ulcer patients: a prospective, randomized, multicenter, North American
      trial.
PG  - 562-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This multicenter, randomized, active-controlled trial assessed
      efficacy of bismuth-based quadruple therapy with omeprazole, bismuth
      biskalcitrate, metronidazole, and tetracycline (OBMT) using a single-triple
      capsule of BMT compared with triple therapy with omeprazole, amoxicillin, and
      clarithromycin (OAC) in treatment of patients with Helicobacter pylori infection 
      and duodenal ulcers. METHODS: Patients with active duodenal ulcer or diagnosed
      within the past 5 yr and with infection documented by (13)C-urea breath test plus
      histology or culture were randomly assigned to 10-day course of OBMT using a
      single-triple capsule containing bismuth biskalcitrate 140 mg, metronidazole 125 
      mg, and tetracycline 125 mg given as three capsules q.i.d. with omeprazole 20 mg 
      b.i.d., or a 10-day course of OAC, omeprazole 20 mg plus amoxicillin 1 g plus
      clarithromycin 500 mg, all b.i.d. Eradication was confirmed by two negative urea 
      breath tests at >1 month and >2 months after therapy. RESULTS: One hundred
      thirty-eight patients received OBMT and 137 OAC. Modified intent-to-treat
      eradication rates were 87.7% for OBMT and 83.2% for OAC (95% CI = -3.9%-12.8%; p 
      = 0.29). OBMT eradicated 91.7% metronidazole-sensitive and 80.4%
      metronidazole-resistant strains (p = 0.06). OAC eradicated 92.1% clarithromycin
      sensitive and 21.4% clarithromycin-resistant strains (p < 0.001). Adverse events 
      occurred in 58.5% of OBMT patients and 59.0% of OAC patients. CONCLUSIONS: OBMT
      regimen using the single-triple capsule is as efficacious and well-tolerated as
      the widely used OAC regimen for H. pylori eradication. This OBMT therapy largely 
      overcomes H. pylori metronidazole resistance, present in 40% of patients in this 
      study.

TI  - High eradication rates of Helicobacter pylori with a new sequential treatment.
PG  - 719-26
AB  - BACKGROUND: Eradication rates of Helicobacter pylori with standard triple therapy
      are disappointing, and studies from several countries confirm this poor
      performance. AIM: To assess the eradication rate of a new sequential treatment
      regimen compared with conventional triple therapy for the eradication of H.
      pylori infection. METHODS: One thousand and forty-nine dyspeptic patients were
      studied prospectively. H. pylori-infected patients were randomized to receive
      10-day sequential therapy [rabeprazole (40 mg daily) plus amoxicillin (1 g twice 
      daily) for the first 5 days, followed by rabeprazole (20 mg), clarithromycin (500
      mg) and tinidazole (500 mg) twice daily for the remaining 5 days] or standard
      7-day therapy [corrected] [rabeprazole (20 mg), clarithromycin (500 mg) and
      amoxicillin (1 g) twice daily]. H. pylori status was assessed by histology, rapid
      urease test and 13C-urea breath test at baseline and 6 weeks or more after
      completion of treatment. RESULTS: Higher eradication rates were found with the
      sequential regimen compared to the standard regimen (intention-to-treat: 92% vs. 
      74%, P < 0.0001; per protocol: 95% vs. 77%, P < 0.0001). Higher eradication rates
      were also seen in patients with peptic ulcer disease and non-ulcer dyspepsia. In 
      both treatments, compliance was similar (> 90%), as was the rate of side-effects,
      which were mild. CONCLUSIONS: This 10-day sequential treatment regimen achieves
      high eradication rates in peptic ulcer disease and non-ulcer dyspepsia.

      ulcers in patients receiving long-term NSAIDs: a double-blind, placebo-controlled
      trial.
PG  - 799-805
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is controversy as to whether Helicobacter pylori and
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs interact to cause peptic ulcers. AIM: To
      study whether the eradication of H. pylori in patients on long-term non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drug therapy prevents the development of ulcers. METHODS:
      Patients infected with H. pylori whilst receiving long-term non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drug therapy, but with no ulcers at baseline endoscopy, were
      randomized to receive either triple antibiotic therapy (metronidazole 300 mg,
      clarithromycin 250 mg and amoxicillin 500 mg, given four times daily; n = 70) or 
      placebo (n = 70) for 2 weeks. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were
      continued throughout the study period. Endoscopy was repeated 12 weeks after the 
      end of treatment. The development of ulcers was compared between the two groups. 
      RESULTS: Endoscopy at 12 weeks revealed peptic ulcer development in five [7%; 95%
      confidence interval (CI), 2-16] of the patients who received triple therapy and
      in six (9%; 95% CI, 3-18) of those who received placebo (P = 1.00). No
      significant difference in the development of ulcers was found between patients
      with persistent H. pylori infection (7/80; 9%; 95% CI, 4-17) and those with the
      eradication of H. pylori (4/52; 8%; 95% CI, 2-19) (P = 1.00). CONCLUSIONS: The
      eradication of H. pylori in patients receiving long-term treatment with
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs did not prevent ulcer development. However,
      because the rate of ulcer development was low, a study with a larger sample size 
      is required to confirm this finding.

TI  - Low-dose or standard-dose proton pump inhibitors for maintenance therapy of
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease: a cost-effectiveness analysis.
PG  - 785-92
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies on the use of low-dose proton pump inhibitor for the
      maintenance therapy of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease have shown that it might
      be comparable with standard-dose proton pump inhibitor treatment and superior to 
      standard-dose histamine-2 receptor antagonist therapy. AIM: To compare the impact
      of standard-dose histamine-2 receptor antagonist, low-dose proton pump inhibitor 
      and standard-dose proton pump inhibitor treatment for the maintenance therapy of 
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease on symptom control and health care resource
      utilization from the perspective of a public health organization in Hong Kong.
      METHODS: A Markov model was designed to simulate, over 12 months, the economic
      and clinical outcomes of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease patients treated with 
      standard-dose histamine-2 receptor antagonist, low-dose proton pump inhibitor and
      standard-dose proton pump inhibitor. The transition probabilities were derived
      from the literature. Resource utilization was retrieved from a group of
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease patients in Hong Kong. Sensitivity analysis was
      conducted to examine the robustness of the model. RESULTS: The standard-dose
      proton pump inhibitor strategy was associated with the highest numbers of
      symptom-free patient-years (0.954 years) and quality-adjusted life-years gained
      (0.999 years), followed by low-dose proton pump inhibitor and standard-dose
      histamine-2 receptor antagonist. The direct medical cost per patient in the
      standard-dose proton pump inhibitor group (904 US dollars) was lower than those
      of the low-dose proton pump inhibitor and standard-dose histamine-2 receptor
      antagonist groups. CONCLUSIONS: The standard-dose proton pump inhibitor strategy 
      appears to be the most effective and least costly for the maintenance management 
      of patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in Hong Kong.

TI  - Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: overall risks and management.
      Complementary roles for COX-2 inhibitors and proton pump inhibitors.
PG  - 600-8
AB  - Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are well recognised as causing
      peptic ulceration and ulcer complications. However, several critical issues,
      including the amount of both gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal disease
      affected by NSAIDs, their interaction with ancillary risk factors, and how to
      optimise management in subgroups, remain poorly understood. In this article,
      strategies for subgroups that take account of non-specific gastrointestinal
      risks, minimisation of residual risk, and the importance of non-gastrointestinal 
      toxicity are suggested, and areas for research identified.

TI  - Delivery of radiofrequency energy to the lower oesophageal sphincter and gastric 
      cardia inhibits transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations and
      gastro-oesophageal reflux in patients with reflux disease.
PG  - 479-85
AB  - Background and aims: Radiofrequency energy (RFe) treatment to the lower
      oesophageal sphincter (LOS) and gastric cardia is a new luminally delivered
      therapy proposed as an alternative treatment for gastro-oesophageal reflux
      disease (GORD). However, it is unclear how RFe achieves its antireflux effect.
      This study investigated the effects of RFe on mechanisms of spontaneous reflux in
      patients with GORD. METHODS: Twenty patients with GORD underwent endoscopy,
      symptom evaluation, and combined postprandial oesophageal manometry and pH
      monitoring before and six months after RFe, and 24 hour ambulatory pH monitoring 
      before and at six and 12 months after treatment. RESULTS: RFe reduced the rate of
      postprandial transient LOS relaxations from 6.8 (5.7-8.1) (median (interquartile 
      range) per hour to 5.2 (4.2-5.8) per hour (p<0.01), and increased mean basal LOS 
      pressure from 5.2 (SEM 0.3) mm Hg to 8.0 (SEM 0.4) mm Hg (p<0.01). The number of 
      reflux events was reduced from 10 (2-15.3)/3 hours to 5 (3.5-8.5)/3 hours
      (p<0.05) and there was an associated significant reduction in acid exposure time 
      from 5.4% (0.4-14.7) to 3.9% (0.4-6.6) (p<0.05). RFe significantly reduced
      ambulatory oesophageal acid exposure from 10.6% (7.8-13.0) to 6.8% (3.1-9.1)
      (p<0.01) at six months and 6.3% (4.7-10.9) (p<0.05) at 12 months. All patients
      required acid suppressant medication for symptom control before RFe. Six months
      after treatment, 15 patients (75%) were in symptomatic remission and 13 (65%) at 
      12 months. CONCLUSIONS: RFe has significant effects on LOS function that are
      associated with improvement in the antireflux barrier. Uncontrolled clinical data
      also suggest a beneficial effect in the control of reflux symptoms in these
      patients.

TI  - Effect of anti-Helicobacter pylori IgG antibody titer following eradication of
      Helicobacter pylori infection.
PG  - 293-6
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: We measured the levels of IgG antibody in patients treated for
      H. pylori infection using four commercially available ELISA (enzyme linked
      immunosorbent assay) kits. METHODOLOGY: A total of 37 patients with peptic ulcers
      (21 patients had gastric ulcers and 16 patients had duodenal ulcers) were treated
      and monitored. These patients were treated for 14 days with either a dual therapy
      regime consisting of amoxicillin at 1,500 mg per day and omeprazole at 20 mg per 
      day or a triple therapy regime consisting of the same medications as above plus
      metronidazole at 1,000 mg per day. Of these 37 patients, 24 patients (64.9%) had 
      successful eradication of the H. pylori infection. The other 13 patients (35.5%) 
      remained infected. Infection by H. pylori was confirmed prior to treatment using 
      conventional microbiological (rapid urease test) and histological tests on biopsy
      specimens obtained by endoscopy. Four commercially available ELIZA kits (GAP-IgG,
      Hel-P, Helico-G and HM-CAP) were used to measure the serum levels of IgG antibody
      against H. pylori before treatment and at 3, 6 and 9 months after treatment. A
      significant decrease in the IgG titer was observed with the successful
      eradication of the H. pylori infection. RESULTS: In patients whom the H. pylori
      infection was not eradicated, the IgG titer remained the same throughout the
      testing period. All the kits showed a significant decrease in the IgG levels
      (approximately 50% at 3 months) with patients that were successfully treated. The
      HM-CAP kit had the lowest sensitivity at detection the decrease in antibody
      levels (approximately 42% decrease at 3 months). The GAP-IgG kit was able to
      detect whether or not H. pylori was eradicated in shortest time period (100%
      uniformity ratio at 3 months). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest
      that monitoring serum IgG levels after treatment may provide an early indicator
      of the efficacy of therapy in eradicating H. pylori infection. Additionally, the 
      serum IgG level can provide evidence of infection in chronic gastritis patients
      even when the biopsy specimens are negative by microbiological and/or
      histological tests.

      therapy vs. quadruple therapy as second-line treatment for Helicobacter pylori
      infection.
PG  - 553-60
AB  - AIM: To test the efficacy of rabeprazole, levofloxacin and rifabutin triple
      therapy vs. quadruple therapy for the second-line treatment of Helicobacter
      pylori infection. METHODS: One hundred and nine patients who had failed previous 
      H. pylori eradication were randomized to receive: (i) rabeprazole, 20 mg b.d.,
      rifabutin, 300 mg once daily, and levofloxacin, 500 mg once daily, for 7 days
      (triple therapy); or (ii) rabeprazole, 20 mg b.d., metronidazole, 400 mg t.d.s., 
      bismuth subcitrate, 120 mg q.d.s., and tetracycline, 500 mg q.d.s., for 7 days
      (quadruple therapy). Endoscopy and culture were performed before treatment.
      RESULTS: The clarithromycin (79% vs. 21%, P < 0.001) and metronidazole (89% vs.
      40%, P < 0.001) resistance rates were significantly higher in patients with
      previous exposure than in those with no previous exposure. The intention-to-treat
      and per protocol eradication rates were 91%/91% for the triple therapy group and 
      91%/92% for the quadruple therapy group. For patients with double resistance to
      metronidazole and clarithromycin, the eradication rates were 85% (17/20) in the
      triple therapy group and 87% (13/15) in the quadruple therapy group. Compliance
      was greater than 95% for both regimens. CONCLUSION: Rabeprazole, levofloxacin and
      rifabutin-based triple therapy and quadruple therapy were equally effective as
      second-line treatments for H. pylori infection.

TI  - Review article: Esomeprazole--enhanced bio-availability, specificity for the
      proton pump and inhibition of acid secretion.
PG  - 481-8
AB  - Esomeprazole, the S-isomer of omeprazole, is the first proton pump inhibitor
      available for clinical use as a single isomer. It demonstrates pharmacological
      and clinical benefits beyond those seen with the racemic omeprazole. Esomeprazole
      has higher and more consistent bio-availability than omeprazole, which results in
      a greater area under the plasma concentration-time curve. It is the area under
      the plasma concentration-time curve of omeprazole and esomeprazole that
      determines how much of each reaches the parietal cell, and thus the control of
      gastric acid secretion that is achieved. Esomeprazole, like other proton pump
      inhibitors, has a high specificity for the acidic environment of the parietal
      cell, where it is accumulated, activated and covalently inhibits the proton pump.
      Proton pumps elsewhere in the body do not achieve the level of acidity needed for
      accumulation and activation. Esomeprazole, 40 mg once daily, provides more
      effective control of gastric acid secretion than omeprazole, 20 or 40 mg once
      daily, and all other proton pump inhibitors given at their standard doses. This
      translates into greater clinical effect compared with omeprazole, 20 mg once
      daily, and lansoprazole, 30 mg once daily, in the management of reflux disease.
      Esomeprazole therapy is well tolerated, with a low adverse events profile,
      similar to that seen with omeprazole.

TI  - Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 240-7
AB  - Heartburn on 2 or more days a week warrants medical attention, as patients are
      likely to suffer from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Chronic GERD can
      lead to the development of complications including erosive esophagitis, stricture
      formation, and Barrett's esophagus, which increases the risk of esophageal
      adenocarcinoma. A trial with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is the quickest and
      most cost-effective way to diagnose GERD, and is at least as sensitive as 24-hour
      intra-esophageal pH monitoring. As PPIs only bind to actively secreting proton
      pumps, they should be dosed 30 to 60 minutes before a meal. Despite these
      recommendations, a recent survey of over 1000 US primary care physicians found
      that 36% instructed their patients to take a PPI with or after a meal or did not 
      specify the timing of dosing. The patients who will have the best response to
      surgical therapy for GERD are those who had clearly documented acid reflux with
      typical symptoms, and who have responded to PPI treatment. Unfortunately, the
      same survey found that most physicians recommend antireflux surgery for patients 
      in whom medical therapy has failed.

TI  - Long-term results of a randomized prospective study comparing medical and
      surgical treatment of Barrett's esophagus.
PG  - 291-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the results of medical treatment and antireflux surgery in 
      patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE). SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The treatment of
      choice in BE is still controversial. Some clinical studies suggest that surgery
      could be more effective than medical treatment in preventing BE from progressing 
      to dysplasia and adenocarcinoma. However, data from prospective comparative
      studies are necessary to answer this question. METHODS: One hundred one patients 
      were included in a randomized prospective study, 43 with medical treatment and 58
      with antireflux surgery. All patients underwent clinical, endoscopic, and
      histologic assessment. Functional studies were performed in all the operated
      patients and in a subgroup of patients receiving medical treatment. The median
      follow-up was 5 years (range 1-18) in the medical treatment group and 6 years
      (range 1-18) in the surgical treatment group. RESULTS: Satisfactory clinical
      results (excellent to good) were achieved in 39 of the 43 patients (91%)
      undergoing medical treatment and in 53 of the 58 patients (91%) following
      antireflux surgery. The persistence of added inflammatory lesions was
      significantly higher in the medical treatment group. The metaplastic segment did 
      not disappear in any case. Postoperative functional studies showed a significant 
      decrease in the median percentage of total time with pH below 4, although 9 of
      the 58 patients (15%) showed pathologic rates of acid reflux. High-grade
      dysplasia appeared in 2 of the 43 patients (5%) in the medical treatment group
      and in 2 of the 58 patients (3%) in the surgical treatment group. In the latter, 
      both patients presented with clinical and pH-metric recurrence. There was no case
      of malignancy after successful antireflux surgery. CONCLUSIONS: These results
      show that there are no differences between the two types of treatment with
      respect to preventing BE from progressing to dysplasia and adenocarcinoma.
      However, successful antireflux surgery proved to be more efficient than medical
      treatment in this sense, perhaps because it completely controls acid and
      biliopancreatic reflux to the esophagus.

TI  - Endoscopic, deep mural implantation of Enteryx for the treatment of GERD: 6-month
      follow-up of a multicenter trial.
PG  - 250-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This prospective, multicenter, single-arm study evaluated the safety 
      and efficacy of the endoscopic implantation of Enteryx, a biocompatible,
      non-biodegradable liquid polymer for the treatment of GERD. METHODS: Eighty-five 
      patients with heartburn symptoms responsive to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use
      were enrolled. Inclusion requirements were HRQL score < or = 11 on PPI and > or =
      20 off PPI, and 24-hour PH probe with > or = 5% total time at PH < or = 4.
      Patients with a hiatus hernia > 3 cm, grade 3 or 4 esophagitis, or esophageal
      motility disorder were excluded. Using a 4-mm needle tipped catheter during
      standard endoscopy, implants were made in 3-4 quadrants deep into the wall of the
      cardia. Use of PPI medications, pH-metry, manometry, GERD symptoms, and patient
      quality of life were assessed over a 6-month follow-up period. RESULTS: At 6
      months, PPI use was eliminated in 74% and reduced by > 50% in 10% of patients.
      The median HRQL score improved from 24.0 pre-implant (baseline off PPIs) to 4.0
      at 6 months (p < 0.001). Mean total esophageal acid exposure time was 9.5%
      pretherapy and 6.7% at 6 months (p < 0.001). Mean LES length increased from 2.0
      cm at baseline to 3.0 cm posttherapy (p = 0.003). There were no clinically
      serious adverse events. Transient mild-to-moderate chest pain commonly occurred
      after implantation. CONCLUSIONS: The endoscopic implantation of Enteryx is a safe
      and effective therapy for eliminating or decreasing the need for PPI medications,
      improving GERD symptoms and patient quality of life, and decreasing esophageal
      acid exposure among patients suffering from GERD.

TI  - A randomized, double-blind trial of the efficacy and safety of 10 or 20 mg
      rabeprazole compared with 20 mg omeprazole in the maintenance of
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease over 5 years.
PG  - 343-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease has a chronic course, and often
      requires long-term treatment. Proton pump inhibitors are the treatment of choice 
      for both acute and maintenance treatment, but little is known from randomized
      controlled trials of their effects beyond 1 year. AIM: To compare the efficacy
      and safety of two doses of rabeprazole with 20 mg omeprazole in the maintenance
      treatment of erosive gastro-oesophageal reflux disease over 5 years. METHODS: Two
      hundred and forty-three patients who had previously responded to acute treatment 
      for erosive gastro-oesophageal reflux disease were prospectively randomized to
      receive 5 years of treatment with rabeprazole (10 or 20 mg daily) or omeprazole
      (20 mg daily). The primary outcome measure was endoscopically confirmed relapse
      of erosive gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. RESULTS: One hundred and
      twenty-three patients (51%) completed all 5 years of the study, with similar
      completion rates in the three groups. Relapses occurred in nine of 78 (11.5%),
      eight of 82 (9.8%) and 11 of 83 (13.3%) patients in the rabeprazole 20 mg,
      rabeprazole 10 mg and omeprazole 20 mg groups, respectively. Gastric biopsy
      showed no evidence of any harmful effects. All treatments were well tolerated.
      CONCLUSIONS: Rabeprazole 10 mg, rabeprazole 20 mg and omeprazole 20 mg all had
      similar efficacy in the maintenance treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux
      disease. All three were safe and well tolerated during 5 years of treatment.

      oesophagitis: Metropole study results.
PG  - 333-41
AB  - AIM: To compare the efficacy of esomeprazole, 20 mg once daily, vs. lansoprazole,
      15 mg once daily, for the maintenance treatment of patients with healed reflux
      oesophagitis. METHODS: During the initial open healing phase, 1391 patients with 
      endoscopically verified reflux oesophagitis and a history of heartburn, with or
      without acid regurgitation, received esomeprazole 40 mg for 4-8 weeks. Patients
      who were healed (identified by endoscopy at 4 or 8 weeks) and symptom free were
      then randomized to receive 6 months of treatment with esomeprazole, 20 mg once
      daily, or lansoprazole, 15 mg once daily. RESULTS: Esomeprazole, 20 mg once
      daily, maintained a significantly higher proportion of patients in remission than
      lansoprazole, 15 mg once daily, over 6 months [83% (95% CI, 80-86%) of
      esomeprazole recipients compared with 74% (95% CI, 70-78%) of lansoprazole
      recipients; P < 0.0001; life table estimates]. When data were analysed according 
      to baseline Los Angeles grade classification, esomeprazole, 20 mg once daily,
      achieved consistently higher remission rates across all grades of disease
      severity, whereas the efficacy of lansoprazole decreased to a greater extent with
      increasing severity of reflux oesophagitis. CONCLUSION: Esomeprazole, 20 mg once 
      daily, is more effective than lansoprazole, 15 mg once daily, in maintaining
      remission in patients with healed reflux oesophagitis.

TI  - Review of esomeprazole in the treatment of acid disorders.
PG  - 253-64
AB  - Esomeprazole (Nexium, AstraZeneca) is the (S)-isomer of omeprazole and the first 
      proton pump inhibitor to be developed as an optical isomer. Esomeprazole has an
      improved pharmacokinetic profile, resulting in increased systemic exposure and
      less interindividual variability compared with omeprazole, and more effective
      suppression of gastric acid production compared with other proton pump
      inhibitors. In several large, double-blind, randomised trials, significantly
      higher rates of endoscopically-confirmed healing of erosive oesophagitis and
      resolution of heartburn have been achieved in patients with gastro-oesophageal
      reflux disease receiving 8 weeks of esomeprazole 40 mg o.d. compared with those
      receiving omeprazole 20 mg o.d. or lansoprazole 30 mg o.d. In the maintenance of 
      healed erosive oesophagitis, esomeprazole 10, 20 or 40 mg o.d. was significantly 
      more effective than placebo in two 6-month, randomised, double-blind trials.
      Additionally, esomeprazole 20 mg o.d. was more effective than lansoprazole 15 mg 
      in the maintenance of healed erosive oesophagitis in another 6-month, randomised,
      double-blind trial. Healing of oesophagitis was also effectively maintained by
      esomeprazole 40 mg o.d. in a 12-month non-comparative trial. Esomeprazole 20 or
      40 mg o.d. effectively relieved heartburn in patients with gastro-oesophageal
      reflux disease without oesophagitis in two 4-week, placebo-controlled trials.
      Clinical trials have shown that triple therapy with esomeprazole 40 mg o.d. in
      combination with amoxicillin and clarithromycin produced Helicobacter pylori
      eradication rates similar to those obtained using triple therapy involving
      twice-daily dosing with other proton pump inhibitors. Esomeprazole is
      well-tolerated, with a spectrum and incidence of adverse events similar to those 
      associated with omeprazole.

TI  - Reflux disease and Barrett's esophagus.
PG  - 112-7
AB  - Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is one of the most prevalent
      gastrointestinal disorders. The key feature of GERD is reflux of gastric contents
      into the esophagus. Medical treatment with proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) is well 
      established and is considered the standard treatment. Given the high prevalence
      of the condition and the excellent response to medical therapy, antireflux
      surgery is an option for patients with volume reflux that is not properly
      controlled by medical therapy. Adenocarcinoma is a rare but life-threatening
      complication of GERD. The only known precursor lesion for esophageal
      adenocarcinoma is Barrett's esophagus. In recent years, a clearer understanding
      of the development of Barrett's and of its progression toward invasive cancer has
      developed. Genetic factors almost certainly determine the individual risk. The
      length of the Barrett's esophagus segment and the size of a hiatal hernia are
      associated with the risk of developing high-grade dysplasia and esophageal
      adenocarcinoma.With regard to the clinical management of GERD patients with
      Barrett's, endoscopic surveillance at 3-year intervals is now considered
      appropriate in the absence of dysplasia. In patients with high-grade dyspepsia,
      the situation is more difficult. While a considerable proportion of these
      patients may already have invasive cancers, there is also the possibility that
      there is only focal dysplasia. For this reason, it is justifiable to carry out
      curative endoscopic resection. Mucosal ablation procedures may also be
      appropriate, but these still need to be properly investigated in clinical trials.

TI  - Motion--genetic testing is useful in the diagnosis of nonhereditary pancreatic
      conditions: arguments against the motion.
PG  - 53-5
AB  - Mutations of two genes, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
      gene (CFTR) and the pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor gene (PSTI), are
      associated with an increase in the risk of idiopathic chronic pancreatitis.
      Persons who have mutations of both CFTR alleles (one severely and one mildly
      affected) are especially susceptible to this disease. Because these compound
      heterozygotes have sufficient residual CFTR function, they do not develop cystic 
      fibrosis lung disease. One PSTI mutation, N34S, independently increases the risk 
      of pancreatitis. Thus, the risk of pancreatitis is greatest among individuals who
      are CFTR compound heterozygotes and who also have the PSTI mutation. Nonetheless,
      most people with CFTR and PSTI mutations do not develop pancreatitis. This fact
      indicates that environmental influences and gene-gene interactions also affect
      pancreatitis risk. Although CFTR and PSTI genetic testing can identify persons at
      an increased risk of pancreatitis, there are several reasons why the routine
      screening of individuals with nonhereditary pancreatitis is not recommended at
      this time: most disease-associated mutations are not detected by readily
      available techniques, genetic counselling guidelines do not exist, most patients 
      with mutations do not develop pancreatitis and the results of testing do not
      affect the clinical management of pancreatitis.

TI  - Impact of clarithromycin resistance and CYP2C19 genetic polymorphism on treatment
      efficacy of Helicobacter pylori infection with lansoprazole- or rabeprazole-based
      triple therapy in Japan.
PG  - 27-33
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Helicobacter pylori treatment failure is thought to be due mainly to
      polymorphic cytochrome P450 2C19 (CPY2C19) genetic polymorphism, associated with 
      proton pump inhibitor metabolism, and antimicrobial susceptibility. This report
      has ascertained which was more important, CPY2C19 polymorphism or antimicrobial
      susceptibility, when using 1-week lansoprazole-based or rabeprazole-based triple 
      therapy in Japan. DESIGN: An open, randomized, parallel group study. SETTING: One
      hundred and forty-five subjects with H. pylori-positive gastritis or peptic
      ulcers were randomly assigned to receive 30 mg lansoprazole twice daily (LAC
      group), 10 mg rabeprazole twice daily (RAC20 group), or 20 mg rabeprazole twice
      daily (RAC40 group), with 1000 mg amoxicillin twice daily and 400 mg
      clarithromycin twice daily for 1 week. Antimicrobial resistance testing was
      performed by E-test. More than 4 weeks after completion of treatment, H. pylori
      status was assessed by 13C-urea breath test, histology, and culture. RESULTS:
      Cure rates expressed as intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses,
      respectively, were 79.6 and 83.0% with LAC, 85.4 and 89.1% with RAC20, and 83.3
      and 88.9% with RAC40. In the case of clarithromycin-sensitive strains, the cure
      rates were more than 97%, regardless of CPY2C19 polymorphism. However, treatment 
      succeeded in only one out of 16 clarithromycin-resistant strains. CONCLUSIONS:
      The key to successful eradication of H. pylori, using lansoprazole or rabeprazole
      with clarithromycin and amoxicillin, is clarithromycin susceptibility, not
      CPY2C19 polymorphism.

TI  - Effect of different proton pump inhibitors, differences in CYP2C19 genotype and
      antibiotic resistance on the eradication rate of Helicobacter pylori infection by
      a 1-week regimen of proton pump inhibitor, amoxicillin and clarithromycin.
PG  - 259-64
AB  - AIM: To investigate the effect of different proton pump inhibitors, S-mephenytoin
      4'-hydroxylase (CYP2C19) genotype and antibiotic susceptibility on the
      eradication rate of Helicobacter pylori. METHODS: One hundred and eighty-seven H.
      pylori-infected peptic ulcer patients were randomly treated with either
      rabeprazole (10 mg b.d.) or lansoprazole (30 mg b.d.) plus amoxicillin (750 mg
      b.d.) and clarithromycin (400 mg b.d.) for 1 week. The antibiotic susceptibility 
      and CYP2C19 genotype (extensive or poor metabolizer) were investigated. RESULTS: 
      The eradication rates in the rabeprazole-amoxicillin-clarithromycin (RAC) and
      lansoprazole-amoxicillin-clarithromycin (LAC) groups were 75% and 69%,
      respectively, on an intention-to-treat basis, and 80% and 75%, respectively, on a
      per protocol basis. The eradication rate for clarithromycin-resistant strains was
      significantly lower than that for clarithromycin-sensitive strains (24% vs. 86%, 
      P < 0.05). For clarithromycin-sensitive strains in the LAC group, there was a
      tendency for a lower eradication rate in extensive than poor metabolizers. The
      eradication rate in extensive metabolizers in the RAC group tended to be higher
      than that in extensive metabolizers in the LAC group (89% vs. 78%, P = 0.079726).
      CONCLUSIONS: The success of the 1-week proton pump
      inhibitor-amoxicillin-clarithromycin regimen depends on the susceptibility of H. 
      pylori to clarithromycin. Moreover, differences in CYP2C19 genotype influence the
      eradication rates of lansoprazole-based therapy, and the rabeprazole-based
      regimen has an advantage especially in extensive metabolizers.

TI  - Baclofen decreases acid and non-acid post-prandial gastro-oesophageal reflux
      measured by combined multichannel intraluminal impedance and pH.
PG  - 243-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: Omeprazole controls acid but not non-acid reflux. The GABA B agonist 
      baclofen decreases acid reflux through the inhibition of transient lower
      oesophageal sphincter relaxations (TLESRs) and should similarly decrease non-acid
      reflux. Using combined multichannel intraluminal impedance and pH (MII/pH), we
      compared acid and non-acid reflux after placebo and baclofen. METHODS: Nine
      healthy volunteers and nine heartburn patients underwent two 2-h studies of
      combined MII/pH in right lateral decubitus after a refluxogenic meal in random
      order: on placebo and after baclofen 40 mg p.o. Tracings were analysed for acid
      and non-acid reflux episodes, re-reflux and symptoms in the heartburn patients.
      RESULTS: In normal subjects baclofen significantly reduced the median number of
      episodes of acid (7 vs. 1, P = 0.02), non-acid (2 vs. 0, P = 0.005), and all
      reflux combined (10 vs. 2, P = 0.006); re-reflux was not reduced (0 vs. 0, P =
      N.S.). In heartburn patients, baclofen significantly decreased the median number 
      of episodes of acid (15 vs. 6, P = 0.004), non-acid (4 vs. 2, P = 0.003),
      re-reflux (2 vs. 0, P = 0.02), and all reflux combined (23 vs. 8, P = 0.004); it 
      also reduced the median number of acid-related (9 vs. 1, P = 0.008) and
      non-acid-related (1 vs. 0, P = 0.04) symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Baclofen reduces
      post-prandial acid and non-acid reflux and their associated symptoms. GABA B
      agonists may have a role in treating GERD.

TI  - Effect of oral omeprazole in reducing re-bleeding in bleeding peptic ulcers: a
      prospective, double-blind, randomized, clinical trial.
PG  - 211-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Endoscopic therapies and continuous intravenous omeprazole can
      decrease the morbidity and duration of hospital stay of patients with high-risk
      peptic ulcer. AIM: To evaluate the role of oral omeprazole in high-risk bleeders.
      METHODS: After injection therapy of 160 patients with high-risk peptic ulcer, 80 
      received oral omeprazole and 80 received placebo, and all were followed up.
      RESULTS: One hundred and forty-nine patients (71 omeprazole and 78 placebo)
      completed the study. Eleven patients were excluded from the study. Thirty-seven
      (25%) patients had gastric ulcer and 112 (75%) had duodenal ulcer. Fifty-seven
      (38%) ulcers showed visible vessels, 80 (54%) showed oozing of blood and 12 (8%) 
      showed a spurting artery. Only one patient died (placebo group). The mean
      hospital stays were 62.8 +/- 28.6 h and 75 +/- 39 h in the omeprazole and placebo
      groups, respectively (P = 0.032). The mean amounts of blood transfused were 1.13 
      +/- 1.36 and 1.68 +/- 1.68 bags in the omeprazole and placebo groups,
      respectively (P = 0.029). The re-bleeding rate was lower in the omeprazole group 
      than in the placebo group (12 vs. 26, respectively; P = 0.022). CONCLUSION: Oral 
      omeprazole is effective in decreasing the hospital stay, re-bleeding rate and the
      need for blood transfusion in high-risk ulcer bleeders treated with endoscopic
      injection therapy.

TI  - Minimizing recurrent peptic ulcer hemorrhage after endoscopic hemostasis: the
      cost-effectiveness of competing strategies.
PG  - 86-97
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Controversy exists regarding the optimal strategy to minimize
      recurrent ulcer hemorrhage after successful endoscopic hemostasis. Our objective 
      was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of competing strategies for the
      posthemostasis management of patients with high risk ulcer stigmata. METHODS:
      Through decision analysis, we calculated the cost-effectiveness of four
      strategies: 1) follow patients clinically after hemostasis and repeat endoscopy
      only in patients with evidence of rebleeding (usual care); 2) administer
      intravenous proton pump inhibitors (i.v. PPIs) after hemostasis and repeat
      endoscopy only in patients with clinical signs of rebleeding; 3) perform second
      look endoscopy at 24 h in all patients with successful endoscopic hemostasis; and
      4) perform selective second look endoscopy at 24 h only in patients at high risk 
      for rebleeding as identified by the prospectively validated Baylor Bleeding
      Score. Probability estimates were derived from a systematic review of the medical
      literature. Cost estimates were based on Medicare reimbursement. Effectiveness
      was defined as the proportion of patients with rebleeding, surgery, or death
      prevented. RESULTS: The selective second look endoscopy strategy was the most
      effective and least expensive of the four competing strategies, and therefore
      dominated the analysis. The i.v. PPI strategy required 50% fewer endoscopies than
      the competing strategies, and became the dominant strategy when the rebleed rate 
      with i.v. PPIs fell below 9% and when the cost of i.v. PPIs fell below 10
      dollars/day. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the usual practice of "watchful waiting,"
      performing selective second look endoscopy in high risk patients may prevent more
      cases of rebleeding, surgery, or death at a lower overall cost. However, i.v.
      PPIs are likely to reduce the need for second look endoscopy and may be preferred
      overall if the rebleed rate and cost of i.v. PPIs remains low.

TI  - Lansoprazole: in the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease in children.
PG  - 57-61; discussion 62
AB  - Lansoprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, inactivates the H(+)/K(+)-ATPase pump in
      parietal cells, thereby suppressing basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion
      and increasing intragastric pH. After 8-12 weeks' treatment with lansoprazole,
      all children (n = 27) with esophagitis at baseline were healed (confirmed by
      endoscopy) and 76% of 62 evaluable children experienced improvements in overall
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms. In this noncomparative trial, 66
      children (aged 1-11 years) with GERD with or without esophagitis received oral
      lansoprazole 15 or 30 mg once daily dependent on their weight. The drug is
      generally well tolerated in children with GERD. In the largest study, the most
      common treatment-related adverse events occurring during therapy were
      constipation and headache.

TI  - Celecoxib versus diclofenac and omeprazole in reducing the risk of recurrent
      ulcer bleeding in patients with arthritis.
PG  - 2104-10
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommend that patients at risk for ulcer disease 
      who require treatment for arthritis receive nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs
      (NSAIDs) that are selective for cyclooxygenase-2 or the combination of a
      nonselective NSAID with a proton-pump inhibitor. We assessed whether celecoxib
      would be similar to diclofenac plus omeprazole in reducing the risk of recurrent 
      ulcer bleeding in patients at high risk for bleeding. METHODS: We studied
      patients who used NSAIDs for arthritis and who presented with ulcer bleeding.
      After their ulcers had healed, we randomly assigned patients who were negative
      for Helicobacter pylori to receive either 200 mg of celecoxib twice daily plus
      daily placebo or 75 mg of diclofenac twice daily plus 20 mg of omeprazole daily
      for six months. The end point was recurrent ulcer bleeding. RESULTS: In the
      intention-to-treat analysis, which included 287 patients (144 receiving celecoxib
      and 143 receiving diclofenac plus omeprazole), recurrent ulcer bleeding occurred 
      in 7 patients receiving celecoxib and 9 receiving diclofenac plus omeprazole. The
      probability of recurrent bleeding during the six-month period was 4.9 percent (95
      percent confidence interval, 3.1 to 6.7) for patients who received celecoxib and 
      6.4 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 4.3 to 8.4) for patients who
      received diclofenac plus omeprazole (difference, -1.5 percentage points; 95
      percent confidence interval for the difference, -6.8 to 3.8). Renal adverse
      events, including hypertension, peripheral edema, and renal failure, occurred in 
      24.3 percent of the patients receiving celecoxib and 30.8 percent of those
      receiving diclofenac plus omeprazole. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with a recent
      history of ulcer bleeding, treatment with celecoxib was as effective as treatment
      with diclofenac plus omeprazole, with respect to the prevention of recurrent
      bleeding. Renal toxic effects are common in high-risk patients receiving
      celecoxib or diclofenac plus omeprazole.

TI  - Occurrence of ventilator-associated pneumonia in mechanically ventilated
      pediatric intensive care patients during stress ulcer prophylaxis with
      sucralfate, ranitidine, and omeprazole.
PG  - 240-5
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effects of sucralfate,
      ranitidine, and omeprazole use on incidence of ventilatory-associated pneumonia
      (VAP) and mortality in ventilated pediatric critical care patients. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: This prospective study was conducted at the pediatric intensive care
      unit (PICU) between August 2000 and February 2002. A total of 160 patients who
      needed mechanical ventilation were randomized into 4 groups according to the
      computer-generated random number table: group (S), (n = 38) received sucralfate
      suspension 60 mg/kg/d in 4 doses via the nasogastric tube that was flushed with
      10 mL of sterile water; group (R), (n = 42) received ranitidine 2 mg/kg/d
      intravenously in 4 doses; group (O), (n = 38) received omeprazole 1 mg/kg/d
      intravenously in 2 doses; and group (P), (n = 42) did not receive any medication 
      for stress ulcer prophylaxis. Treatment was begun within 6 hours of PICU
      admission. RESULTS: Seventy patients (44%) developed VAP. VAP rate was 42% (16 of
      38) in the sucralfate group, 48% (20 of 42) in the ranitidine group, 45% (17 of
      38) in the omeprazole group, and 41% (17 of 42) in the nontreated group. Overall 
      mortality rate was 22% (35 of 160); it was 21% (8 of 38) in the sucralfate group,
      23% (10 of 42) in the ranitidine group, 21% (8 of 38) in the omeprazole group,
      and 21% (9 of 42) in the nontreated group. Our results did not show any
      difference in the incidence of VAP and mortality in mechanically ventilated PICU 
      patients treated with ranitidine, omeprazole, or sucralfate, or nontreated
      subjects (P =.963, confidence interval [CI] = 0.958-0.968; P =.988, CI =
      0.985-0.991, respectively). Nine patients (5.6%) had macroscopic bleeding. There 
      was no statistically significant difference in macroscopic bleeding between
      groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results did not show any difference in the incidence of 
      VAP, macroscopic stress ulcer bleeding, and mortality in the mechanically
      ventilated PICU patients treated with ranitidine, omeprazole, or sucralfate, or
      nontreated subjects. None of the treatment regimens increased VAP compared with
      the nontreated group. Because there is insufficient data about stress ulcer
      prophylaxis and VAP in the pediatric age group, more studies with larger numbers 
      of patients are needed.

TI  - Effect of Helicobacter pylori eradication on development of erosive esophagitis
      and gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms: a post hoc analysis of eight double
      blind prospective studies.
PG  - 2992-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the development of erosive
      esophagitis, the development of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms
      in patients without prior symptomatic or endoscopic GERD, and the worsening of
      GERD symptoms in patients with prior symptomatic GERD in a post hoc analysis of
      eight double-blind prospective trials of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) therapy 
      in 1165 patients. METHODS: Patients with active or past duodenal ulcer and
      without baseline erosive esophagitis had end of study endoscopies 4-30 wk after
      completion of therapy. A total of 533 patients had heartburn and regurgitation
      scores assessed at baseline and 4 wk after end of therapy, and were divided into 
      two groups: 1) no prior GERD symptoms (N = 127) and 2) prior GERD symptoms (N =
      406). H. pylori was assessed at baseline and > or = 4 wk after therapy by rapid
      urease test, histology, and culture. RESULTS: Erosive esophagitis developed in 24
      (4%) of 621 patients with cure versus 14 (3%) of 544 with persistent H. pylori
      (OR = 1.52, 95% CI = 0.78-2.97). In the longest study (28-30-wk follow-up),
      esophagitis developed in two (7%) of 28 patients with cure versus five (7%) of 76
      with persistent infection. New GERD symptoms developed in 13 (14%) of 92 patients
      with cure versus seven (20%) of 35 with persistent infection (OR = 0.66,95% CI = 
      0.24-1.82). GERD worsened in 20 (7%) of 269 with cure vs 20 (15%) of 137 with
      persistent H. pylori (OR = 0.47, 95% CI = 0.24-0.91; p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      results do not support the hypothesis that H. pylori eradication in patients with
      duodenal ulcer disease leads to the development of erosive esophagitis, the
      development of new symptomatic GERD, or worsening of symptoms in patients with
      pre-existing GERD.

TI  - Management of peptic ulcer disease not related to Helicobacter pylori or NSAIDs.
PG  - 2950-61
AB  - Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is widely accepted as the most
      important factor in the pathogenesis of duodenal ulcer. However, in parallel with
      more effective eradication of H. pylori, the prevalence of H. pylori is changing,
      and H. pylori-negative peptic ulcer disease appears to be increasing. When making
      a diagnosis of H. pylori-negative peptic ulcer disease, it is essential to avoid 
      misclassification because of inaccurate diagnosis. In addition, secondary causes 
      may need to be excluded with appropriate investigations. In the absence of H.
      pylori, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug usage is the most common cause of
      peptic ulcer; surreptitious nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug usage is a cause 
      of unexplained ulcer disease in up to 60% of patients. Hypersecretory syndromes
      such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, although rare, need to be excluded. Once all 
      known etiological factors are excluded, there remains a group of patients with
      so-called "idiopathic ulcers." The interplay of etiological factors in the
      pathogenesis of idiopathic peptic ulcer disease is poorly defined but may include
      a genetic predisposition, altered acid secretion, rapid gastric emptying,
      defective mucosal defense mechanisms, psychological stress, and smoking. The
      management of idiopathic peptic ulcers is not defined; they appear to be more
      resistant to standard therapy, can be associated with more frequent
      complications, and those that relapse may require long-term maintenance therapy.

TI  - Pantoprazole: an update of its pharmacological properties and therapeutic use in 
      the management of acid-related disorders.
PG  - 101-33
AB  - Pantoprazole (Protonix) is an irreversible proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that
      reduces gastric acid secretion. In combination with two antimicrobial agents
      (most commonly metronidazole, clarithromycin or amoxicillin) for 6-14 days,
      pantoprazole 40 mg twice daily produced Helicobacter pylori eradication rates of 
      71-93.8% (intent-to-treat [ITT] or modified ITT analysis) in patients without
      known antibacterial resistance. Pantoprazole-containing triple therapy was at
      least as effective as omeprazole- and similar in efficacy to
      lansoprazole-containing triple therapy in large trials. In the treatment of
      moderate to severe gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), oral pantoprazole 40
      mg/day was as effective as other PPIs (omeprazole, omeprazole multiple unit
      pellet system, lansoprazole and esomeprazole) and significantly more effective
      than histamine H(2)-antagonists. Pantoprazole 20 mg/day provided effective
      mucosal healing in patients with GORD and mild oesophagitis. Intravenous
      pantoprazole 40 mg/day can be used in patients who are unable to take oral
      medication. Oral pantoprazole 20-40 mg/day for up to 24 months prevented relapse 
      in most patients with healed GORD. According to preliminary data, oral
      pantoprazole 20 or 40 mg/day was effective at healing and preventing
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-related ulcers, and intravenous
      pantoprazole was at least as effective as intravenous ranitidine in preventing
      ulcer rebleeding after endoscopic haemostasis. Oral or intravenous pantoprazole
      up to 240 mg/day maintained target acid output levels in most patients with
      hypersecretory conditions, including Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Oral and
      intravenous pantoprazole appear to be well tolerated in patients with
      acid-related disorders in short- and long-term trials. Tolerability with oral
      pantoprazole was similar to that with other PPIs or histamine H(2)-antagonists in
      short-term trials. Formal drug interaction studies have not revealed any
      clinically significant interactions between pantoprazole and other agents. In
      conclusion, pantoprazole is an effective agent in the management of acid-related 
      disorders. As a component of triple therapy for H. pylori eradication and as
      monotherapy for the healing of oesophagitis and maintenance of GORD, pantoprazole
      has shown similar efficacy to other PPIs and greater efficacy than histamine
      H(2)-antagonists. Limited data suggest that it is also effective in
      Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and in preventing ulcer rebleeding. Pantoprazole is
      well tolerated with minimal potential for drug interactions. The availability of 
      pantoprazole as both oral and intravenous formulations provides flexibility when 
      the oral route of administration is not appropriate. Thus, pantoprazole is a
      valuable alternative to other PPIs in the treatment of acid-related disorders.

TI  - The effects of nocturnal acid breakthrough on Helicobacter pylori eradication.
PG  - 331-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effects of nocturnal gastric acid breakthrough (NAB) on
      Helicobacter pylori eradication are still unknown in peptic ulcer patients. The
      purposes of this study were to compare the effect of lansoprazole 30 mg twice a
      day (bid) to lansoprazole 60 mg once a day (qd) on the prevalence of NAB, and to 
      determine whether NAB affects the eradication of H. pylori in peptic ulcer
      patients. METHODS: Experiments were carried out in 67 patients with H.
      pylori-positive peptic ulcers. They were randomized into two groups, one treated 
      with a combination of lansoprazole 60 mg, clarithromycin 1.0 g, and amoxycillin
      2.0 g once a day before breakfast (qd group), and the other, divided doses of the
      drugs were given before breakfast and dinner (bid group) for 2 weeks. RESULTS:
      NAB occurred in 31 patients, 55.2% in qd group, and 39.5% in bid group (p =.226).
      H. pylori eradication was achieved in 61.3% in NAB positive group and 83.3% in
      NAB negative group (p =.055). The mean duration of NAB for H. pylori eradication 
      group was 99.3 +/- 22.7 min, and 293.2 +/- 49.8 min for H. pylori persistence
      group (p <.05). The median intragastric pH of the H. pylori eradication and
      persistence group was 5.7 +/- 0.2 and 4.2 +/- 0.4, respectively (p <.05).
      CONCLUSIONS: Neither the morning dose and the divided dose regimen of
      lansoprazole affected the intragastric acidity and occurrence of the NAB. NAB did
      not influence H. pylori eradication in peptic ulcer patients, but the duration of
      NAB and total intragastric median pH were found to influence the H. pylori
      eradication.

TI  - Esomeprazole: update and clinical review.
PG  - 189-99
AB  - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee 
      and Gastroenterological Drugs Advisory Committee recommended approval of
      omeprazole as an over-the-counter treatment of heartburn in patients who have at 
      least two episodes of heartburn each week. The consumer studies that have been
      conducted indicate that the majority of patients understand the proposed labeling
      and could use the proposed label to determine if the omeprazole therapy was
      appropriate for them. Esomeprazole is an effective agent in the treatment of
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and erosive esophagitis. Newer studies
      continue to support its efficacy and safety in the treatment of these conditions.
      Several of the most recent studies have included comparisons with other proton
      pump inhibitors. The results of these studies indicate that all the proton pump
      inhibitors are effective in treating GERD and erosive esophagitis and that some
      patients would benefit from esomeprazole therapy.

TI  - Long-term follow-up and factors predictive of recurrence in Barrett's esophagus
      treated by argon plasma coagulation and acid suppression.
PG  - 950-5
AB  - BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: In several series, argon plasma coagulation (APC)
      combined with acid suppression has led to short- or medium-term eradication of
      Barrett's esophagus. The present study was designed to assess the long-term
      outcome after this treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 39 patients with Barrett's
      esophagus, seven of them with low-grade dysplasia, underwent APC and received 40 
      mg omeprazole daily for eradication of the metaplastic epithelium. After the
      treatment period, patients were randomly assigned to receive 20 or 40 mg
      omeprazole daily for long-term acid suppression. Histological and endoscopic
      changes were evaluated annually. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used
      to test the following 10 variables as predictors of sustained reversal of
      Barrett's esophagus at the end of follow-up: age, gender, length of diseased
      segment, presence of hiatal hernia, circumferential nature of lesion, presence of
      low-grade dysplasia at initial biopsy, number of coagulation sessions, result of 
      pH monitoring under protein pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment, omeprazole dosage,
      and initial response to therapy (after 1 month). RESULTS: The median follow-up
      period was 36 months (range 12 - 48). The endoscopic and histological relapse
      rates at 1, 12, and 24 months, and end of follow-up were, respectively, 30 % and 
      44 % (12/39 and 17/39), 57 % and 54 % (16/28 and 15/28), 60 % and 57 % (17/28 and
      16/28), and 62 % for both rates (23/37). According to multivariate analysis,
      shorter length of diseased segment and normalization of pH with PPI treatment
      were the only independent predictors of sustained long-term re-epithelialization.
      Among the seven patients with low-grade dysplasia, four experienced relapse after
      1 month, and during the long-term follow-up, one was lost to follow-up and all
      the others experienced relapse, but only one developed low-grade dysplasia again.
      Cancer was found in two cases after 12 and 18 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Persistence of acid reflux and greater length of diseased segment are the major
      factors associated with a high relapse rate after successful initial reversal.
      APC for ablation of Barrett's esophagus cannot be recommended.

TI  - Levofloxacin based regimens for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori.
PG  - 1309-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: A 7 day treatment scheme based on
      rabeprazole/levofloxacin/amoxycillin or tinidazole achieved an eradication rate
      over 90%. However, the combination of drugs and duration of treatment for the
      correct use of levofloxacin in the eradication of are still unclear. OBJECTIVE:
      To compare the efficacy and tolerability of rabeprazole/levofloxacin based dual
      therapies given for 5, 7 or 10 days with rabeprazole/levofloxacin/amoxycillin
      triple therapy for 7 days. METHODS: One hundred and sixty patients with infection
      documented by the C-urea breath test and histology were included in this
      prospective, open label study. Subjects were randomized in four groups: (1)
      levofloxacin (500 mg o.d.), amoxycillin (1 g b.d.) and rabeprazole (20 mg o.d.)
      for 7 days; (2) levofloxacin (500 mg o.d.) and rabeprazole (20 mg o.d.) for 5
      days; (3) levofloxacin (500 mg o.d.) and rabeprazole (20 mg o.d.) for 7 days; and
      (4) levofloxacin (500 mg o.d.) and rabeprazole (20 mg o.d.) for 10 days. Six
      weeks after the end of therapy status was checked by using the C-urea breath
      test. RESULTS: All patients completed the therapeutic regimens. The eradication
      rate was not significantly modified by treatment duration in the dual therapy
      schemes (5 days: 20/40, 50%; 7 days: 28/40, 70%; 10 days: 26/40, 65%). The
      eradication rate of the 1 week levofloxacin based triple therapy was
      significantly higher than that observed using any dual therapies (36/40). No
      major adverse effects were observed. CONCLUSIONS: A rabeprazole/levofloxacin dual
      eradication regimen is simple and well tolerated but does not achieve an
      acceptable eradication rate when compared to a 1 week
      rabeprazole/levofloxacin/amoxycillin triple therapy. The eradication rate did not
      increase with a longer regimen.

TI  - Gastro-oesophageal reflux in obese subjects: influence of overweight, weight loss
      and chronic gastric balloon distension.
PG  - 1246-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gastro-oesophageal reflux is an obesity-related health risk assumed
      to improve after weight loss. Prolonged intragastric balloon distension might
      oppose this. The purpose of the study was to investigate the prevalence of
      gastro-oesophageal reflux in untreated obese subjects and to study the
      consequences of weight loss with or without intragastric balloon treatment.
      METHODS: Patients participating in a randomized double-blind, sham-controlled
      trial received balloon or sham treatment for the first 13 weeks. Thereafter, all 
      subjects received a balloon for the remaining year. Twenty-four-hour pH
      recordings were made at the start, after 13 weeks of balloon or sham treatment,
      after 26 and 52 weeks of balloon treatment and 13 weeks after balloon removal.
      RESULTS: Group-wise, pH data of 42 untreated patients (BMI 43.4 kg/m2) were
      highly abnormal. On an individual level, 22 subjects (52%) had some evidence of
      reflux, 17 patients (40%) showed pathological total reflux times and 8 (19%) had 
      combined total, upright and supine reflux with grade B reflux oesophagitis in
      only one patient. Albeit poorly, oesophageal acid exposure was related to body
      weight and visceral fat distribution. A reduction in acid reflux was observed in 
      sham-treated weight-losing subjects, whereas in balloon-treated subjects supine
      reflux and duration of the longest reflux increased. In the second 13-week
      period, the initially improved pH values worsened by balloon placement in
      sham-treated subjects. Values in balloon-balloon-treated subjects stabilized.
      After 52 weeks, acid reflux levelled off at pretreatment values and further
      improved after balloon removal. At these times, decreased visceral fat masses
      correlated significantly with diminished oesophageal exposure to acid.
      CONCLUSIONS: Obesity predisposed to gastro-oesophageal reflux. Body weight loss
      and, strikingly, visceral fat loss resulted in improved reflux parameters.
      Adverse effects on acid reflux by gastric balloon distension wore off over time.

TI  - Proton-pump inhibitors for stress ulcer prophylaxis in critically ill patients.
PG  - 1929-37
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) for stress ulcer 
      prophylaxis in critically ill adults. DATA SOURCES: Computerized biomedical
      literature search of MEDLINE (1966-June 2002) was conducted using the MeSH
      headings proton-pump inhibitor, ulcer, critical care, and acid. References of
      selected articles were reviewed. A manual search of critical care, surgery,
      trauma, gastrointestinal, and pharmacy journals was conducted to identify
      relevant abstracts. DATA SYNTHESIS: Traditional medications used for stress ulcer
      prophylaxis include antacids, histamine(2) receptor antagonists (H(2)RAs), and
      sucralfate. Few studies have evaluated PPIs for stress ulcer prophylaxis. The
      majority of studies have demonstrated that enteral or intravenous administration 
      of PPIs to critically ill patients elevates intragastric pH and consistently
      maintains pH > or =4.0. PPIs are safe and seem to be as efficacious as H(2)RAs or
      sucralfate for prevention of bleeding from stress-related mucosal damage (SRMD)
      and they may provide cost minimization. The small patient populations limit the
      results of comparative studies. CONCLUSIONS: Available data indicate that PPIs
      are safe and efficacious for elevating intragastric pH in critically ill
      patients. PPIs should be used only as an alternative to H(2)RAs or sucralfate
      since the superiority of PPIs over these agents for preventing SRMD-associated
      gastrointestinal bleeding has not been established. Additional comparative
      studies with adequate patient numbers and pharmacoeconomic analyses are needed
      before PPIs are considered the agents of choice for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

TI  - An open non-comparative clinical study for the evaluation of safety and efficacy 
      of esomeprazole in patients of reflux oesophagitis in Indian population.
PG  - 624-6
AB  - The proton pump inhibitors have consistently been shown to be far more effective 
      than the others are in gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) as proton pump
      inhibitors (PPIs) block the final and rate-limiting step of parietal acid
      production. The primary objective of the study was to assess the efficacy and
      tolerability of esomeprazole 40 mg given once a day for 4 weeks in patients with 
      reflux oesophagitis. An open, non-comparative study was done with 103 patients in
      4 centres with endoscopic erosive oesophagitis. Symptoms of reflux oesophagitis
      such as heartburn/retrosternal pain and regurgitation recorded on a 4-point
      scale, dysphagia being marked as present or absent. Oesophagitis was graded as
      5-point scale. There was a significant decrease in mean score of heartburn (60.8%
      and 86%), retrosternal pain (60.84% and 86.75%), mean score of regurgitation (65%
      and 90%) at second and fourth week respectively. Global assessment of overall
      symptoms by patients showed complete resolution of symptoms in 86.4% patients at 
      week 4. At the end of treatment 93 out of 103 patients showed complete healing,
      13.6% of total cases had side effects. Esomeprazole was found effective and safe 
      in the treatment of GERD.

TI  - Omeprazole triple therapy versus omeprazole quadruple therapy for healing
      duodenal ulcer and eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection: a 24-month
      follow-up study.
PG  - 1237-43
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of omeprazole triple therapy versus
      omeprazole quadruple therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection. DESIGN:
      Prospective, randomized, single-centre, investigator-blind study. SETTINGS:
      Departments of Gastroenterology and Histopathology, Evangelismos Hospital,
      Athens, Greece. METHODS: One hundred and forty-nine consecutive patients with
      active duodenal ulcer were randomized to receive omeprazole (20 mg b.d.),
      amoxicillin (1 g b.d.) and clarithromycin (0.5 g b.d.) (OAC, n = 78), or
      omeprazole (20 mg b.d.), colloidal bismuth subcitrate (120 mg q.i.d.),
      metronidazole (0.5 g t.i.d.) and tetracycline hydrochloride (0.5 g q.i.d.) (OBMT,
      n = 71) for 10 days. Patients' symptoms were scored, and compliance and
      treatment-related side effects were assessed. Endoscopy was performed before
      treatment and at 10-12 weeks and 12 months after treatment. H. pylori infection
      and its successful eradication were sought by histology, immunohistochemistry and
      campylobacter-like organisms (CLO) tests on multiple biopsies taken from the
      gastric antrum, corpus and fundus. Patients were re-evaluated clinically and
      underwent a C-urea breath test (UBT) at 21-24 months. Those with dyspepsia and/or
      recrudescence of H. pylori were re-endoscoped. RESULTS: Patient groups were
      comparable for age, sex, smoking, occasional use of nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and current or past bleeding episodes. Six and 
      seven patients in the OAC and OBMT treatment groups, respectively, were lost to
      follow-up. Eight patients were non-compliant. Two ulcers in the OAC group and one
      in the OBMT group did not heal. By intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP)
      analyses, ulcer healing rates were 86% (67/78) and 97% (67/69), respectively, for
      the OAC group, and 82% (58/71) and 98% (58/59), respectively, for the OBMT group.
      H. pylori eradication at 10-12 weeks after treatment was 78% (61/78) and 88%
      (61/69) for OAC, and 65% (46/71) and 78% (46/59) for OBMT, by ITT and PP
      analyses, respectively (P > 0.1). Side effects were more common with OBMT.
      Relapse rates of H. pylori were 3% and 2% for the first and second years,
      respectively. Four H. pylori-negative patients developed reflux symptoms, but
      only two developed erosive oesophagitis between 12 and 24 months. CONCLUSIONS:
      OAC and OBMT were equally effective in healing active duodenal ulcers and
      eradicating H. pylori, but OAC should be used as a first-line treatment because
      of its better tolerance.

TI  - [Gastrointestinal side effects in the therapy of rheumatologic diseases].
PG  - 937-43
AB  - Antirheumatic drugs may lead to a number of relevant gastrointestinal
      complications. Symptomatical treatments with glucocorticoids and non steroidal
      antirheumatic drugs (NSAD) are known to induce gastric or duodenal ulcers, above 
      all under combination therapies. Side effects of DMARD's (methotrexate,
      leflunomide, hydroxy/chloroquine, sulfasalazine) include unspecifical
      gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea, vomiting and diarrhea as well as induction
      of ulcerative mucosal lesions (methotrexate) and occurrence of a hepatopathy. The
      latter may appear as an asymptomatical elevation of liver transaminases or
      cholestase parameters, but can also lead, in some cases of a monothera-py
      (hydroxy-/chloroqine, sulfasalazine) or combination therapy (methotrexate +
      leflunomide) to a fulminant hepatitis. TNF-alpha-inhibiting drugs (etanercept,
      infliximab) as a new generation of anti-inflammatory therapeutics don't have
      relevant gastrointestinal side effects according recently published data.

TI  - "Floppy" Nissen vs. Toupet laparoscopic fundoplication: quality of life
      assessment in a 5-year follow-up (part 2).
PG  - 917-22
AB  - BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Quality of life as an outcome variable has become an
      important measure in clinical research. This study is the second part of a
      prospective assessment of the quality of life outcome, in a 5-year follow-up of
      patients who underwent laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication or Toupet
      fundoplication. Data from a 1-year follow-up have been previously published (part
      I). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index
      (GIQLI), the quality of life data of 169 consecutive patients who had undergone a
      laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF; n = 104) or a laparoscopic Toupet
      fundoplication (LTF; n = 65), were evaluated 3 years and 5 years postoperatively.
      Six patients out of the initial study group (n = 175), including three from each 
      group, were excluded from the main analysis because they had undergone
      laparoscopic re-fundoplication during the 1-year follow-up. Data from patients
      with repeat surgery have been analysed separately. In addition to administering
      the GIQLI, we evaluated patient satisfaction with surgery, possible surgical side
      effects or recurrent disease-related symptoms, the use of antireflux medication, 
      and also surgical interventions in relation to initial antireflux surgery. In
      those patients, who were willing (n = 111) we also performed esophageal manometry
      and 24-hour pH monitoring 5 years postoperatively. RESULTS: At 3 years and 5
      years postoperatively, the analysis of quality of life data showed that the GIQLI
      score remained stable in comparison with the 1-year follow-up data, with mean
      scores of 121 +/- 8.7 points in the LNF-group and 119.8 +/- 9 points in the
      LTF-group, at 5 years after surgery. Laparoscopic re-fundoplication was necessary
      in four patients due to a "slipping" Nissen (LNF group n = 1) or recurrent
      symptoms (LTF group, n = 3). In two patients in the LTF group herniation of a
      trocar incision was found. No patient suffered from severe surgical side effects.
      Patient satisfaction with surgery was rated as "excellent" or "good" in 97.9 % of
      patients. There were no significant differences between the groups concerning
      these data. The results of esophageal manometry and 24-hour pH monitoring also
      remained stable and showed normal values in all but two patients (in the LTF
      group), who suffered from mild and infrequent symptoms of recurrent heartburn
      without endoscopic signs of esophagitis. The outcome in patients who underwent
      laparoscopic re-fundoplication is comparable to the outcomes for those with a
      successful primary intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Both Nissen and Toupet laparoscopic
      fundoplication can significantly improve patients' quality of life during the 5
      years following surgical intervention. Quality of life scores for both surgical
      groups were almost equal and postoperative outcomes were comparable to values in 
      healthy controls. Patient satisfaction with surgical treatment was very high,
      even though repeat laparoscopic surgery was necessary in some cases. Patients who
      had a repeat procedure experienced nearly identical outcomes.

TI  - The clinical importance of proton pump inhibitor pharmacokinetics.
PG  - 67-78
AB  - Achieving the optimal clinical response for patients with upper gastrointestinal 
      peptic disease is important. This response depends on the pathology treated as
      well as on the choice of proton pump inhibitor. Here, we identify factors in
      specific disease therapy and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic characteristics that help us achieve this goal. These include
      differences in PPI bioavailability and acid-suppressive effects. Available data
      indicate that PPIs appear to have similar potency on a milligram basis, and that 
      omeprazole and lansoprazole are more frequently double dosed than pantoprazole.
      The lower propensity for double dosing with pantoprazole may also result in lower
      medication acquisition costs and a reduction in physician visits due to
      ineffective therapy with the standard dosing of these other agents.

TI  - Gastroesophageal reflux and cow milk allergy: is there a link?
PG  - 972-84
AB  - Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) and cow milk allergy (CMA) occur frequently in
      infants younger than 1 year. In recent years, the relation between these 2
      entities has been investigated and some important conclusions have been reached: 
      in up to half of the cases of GER in infants younger than 1 year, there may be an
      association with CMA. In a high proportion of cases, GER is not only CMA
      associated but also CMA induced. The frequency of this association should induce 
      pediatricians to screen for possible concomitant CMA in all infants who have GER 
      and are younger than 1 year. With the exception of some patients with mild
      typical CMA manifestations (diarrhea, dermatitis, or rhinitis), the symptoms of
      GER associated with CMA are the same as those observed in primary GER.
      Immunologic tests and esophageal pH monitoring (with a typical pH pattern
      characterized by a progressive, slow decrease in esophageal pH between feedings) 
      may be helpful if an association between GER and CMA is suspected, although the
      clinical response to an elimination diet and challenge is the only clue to the
      diagnosis. This article reviews the main features of GER and CMA, focusing on the
      aspects in common and the discrepancies between both conditions.

TI  - Motion--Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication is more cost effective than oral PPI
      administration: arguments for the motion.
PG  - 621-3
AB  - Gastroesophageal reflux disease is a mechanical disorder of the foregut. While
      medications can only provide symptom relief, surgery can correct the
      pathophysiological abnormality of the lower esophageal sphincter. The costs of
      medical and surgical therapy are much greater than the costs of medication or
      hospitalization alone. In the case of medical therapy, one must consider the
      costs of serial monitoring and of failed treatment. The effectiveness of
      treatment also depends on patient-related factors, including weight,
      socioeconomic factors, smoking, alcohol use, dietary habits and the use of
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Surgical results depend on the experience
      and skill of the surgeon, as well as the attributes of the institution in which
      the procedure is undertaken. Therefore, studies that come from specialized
      centres may not be applicable to the community. Data from the author's facility
      indicate that laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication is the most cost effective
      option when it is undertaken by experienced surgeons on otherwise healthy
      patients who have documented gastroesophageal reflux disease.

TI  - Short-term therapeutic trial of proton pump inhibitors in suspected
      extraesophageal reflux.
PG  - 425-32
AB  - Pharyngoesophageal gastric acid reflux is thought to initiate chronic posterior
      laryngitis. The gold standard for measuring gastric reflux is dual-channel
      24-hour pH monitoring. This is a time-consuming, inconvenient, expensive method
      that is not available in all areas. New therapeutic regimes that make use of
      proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have proven to be therapeutically efficient for
      control of acid reflux. Twenty-four consecutive patients with chronic voice
      disorders and signs of posterior laryngitis were selected for therapy.
      Twenty-four hour pH monitoring was performed independently before the therapy.
      The trial therapy consisted of all patients receiving pantoprazole, 40 mg once
      daily for 6 weeks. Immediately following the therapy a statistically significant 
      (p < 0.05) improvement was observed in all patients. This improvement was
      analyzed retrospectively by comparison with the results of 24-hour pH monitoring.
      In 71% of the patients the 24-hour pH-monitoring gave a positive result showing a
      high number of patients with extraesophageal reflux in our study group. Patients 
      with positive results of pH-monitoring responded in a statistically significant
      manner (p < 0.05) to the pantoprazole therapy, whereas those patients without
      detected reflux did not. A 3-month follow-up of the patients with a positive
      result of the pH-monitoring confirmed the improvement. No patients reported
      adverse effects. A 6-week treatment with pantoprazole can be clinically
      justified. It helps to save time and reduce costs, allows for selection of
      reflux-negative patients for alternative therapy, and may prevent inadequate
      treatment of patients with false-negative pH monitoring. Twenty-four hour pH
      monitoring is still recommended for patients unresponsive to this trial therapy.

TI  - [Differential diagnosis and therapy of acute pancreatitis].
PG  - 1595-602
AB  - Acute pancreatitis is classified in an interstitial edematous pancreatitis and a 
      hemorrhagic necrotizing pancreatitis comprising 80% and 20% respectively of all
      cases. 80% of acute pancreatitis are attributed to biliary and alcoholic origin
      whereas in more than 10% no etiology can be established comprising the idiopathic
      forms of acute pancreatitis. Clinical symptoms are rather unspecific resulting in
      a large number of abdominal and extraabdominal diseases that have to be
      considered regarding the differential diagnosis. Diagnosis is based on clinical
      examination, laboratory findings and ultrasound. However it has to be taken into 
      account that a lack of abdominal symptoms and unaltered amylase and lipase levels
      may be present in spite of overt pancreatitis. As severe pancreatitis is
      associated with a steep increase in mortality the early identification of severe 
      pancreatitis is crucial. Several prognostic scores like the Ranson-, Glasgow- and
      APACHE-II score were developed to achieve a higher sensitivity detecting
      transition to severe pancreatitis. In addition new prognostic serum parameters
      are applicable. A prophylactic antibiotic therapy is recommended in patients with
      sterile necrosis whereas an infected necrosis requires organ preserving
      necrosectomy and retroperitoneal lavage which can be done surgically or referring
      to new concepts endoscopically. Apart from renal and respiratory failure,
      necrosis, pseudocysts and pancreatic abscess are the main complications. In the
      presence of detected stones in the common bile tract ERCP in combination with
      stone extraction and papillotomy reduces morbidity and mortality in patients with
      biliary pancreatitis. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy should be performed as soon as
      the patient has recovered and preferably during the same hospital admission.

TI  - Does Helicobacter pylori eradication affect symptoms in nonulcer dyspepsia: a
      5-year follow-up study.
PG  - 317-21
AB  - The role of Helicobacter pylori infection in nonulcer dyspepsia remains
      controversial. To date studies exploring the effect of H. pylori eradication on
      symptoms have reported conflicting results. Randomised control trials employing
      validated outcome measures have also been difficult to interpret because of
      several important issues such as the large placebo response seen in patients with
      nonulcer dyspepsia and both the natural variability in symptoms and symptom
      severity with time. The association of symptom improvement with resolution of
      gastritis has meant that the length of follow up employed in most studies has
      been insufficient. We report the findings of a randomised placebo controlled
      trial (n = 100), using a validated symptom questionnaire and 5 year follow up to 
      determine the effect of H. pylori eradication on symptoms in nonulcer dyspepsia. 
      In all 64 that were reviewed at 5 years there was a significant difference
      between patients who were H. pylori negative and those who remained positive with
      regard to complete symptom resolution, consumption of relevant medications and
      peptic ulcer disease development, in favour of active treatment. There was a
      trend for gradual symptom improvement over time irrespective of H. pylori status,
      which may reflect the natural history of this condition. For those who remained
      symptomatic at 5 years, there was no difference in symptom severity based on H.
      pylori status. The findings of this study support the use of H. pylori
      eradication in symptomatic patients with nonulcer dyspepsia both to induce
      symptom resolution and to prevent disease progression.

TI  - Eradication rates of clarithromycin-resistant Helicobacter pylori using either
      rabeprazole or lansoprazole plus amoxicillin and clarithromycin.
PG  - 1933-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The resistance of Helicobacter pylori to clarithromycin has become
      one of the primary reasons for eradication failure. AIM: To compare the
      eradication rates of triple therapy using amoxicillin (A), clarithromycin (C) and
      rabeprazole (R) or lansoprazole (L) against clarithromycin-sensitive and
      clarithromycin-resistant strains. METHODS: Two hundred and ninety-five patients
      were randomly divided into four groups and treated for 1 week: 147 cases were
      treated with RAC, i.e. 49 cases with R20C400 (10 mg R + 750 mg A + 200 mg C,
      twice daily), 48 cases with R40C400 (20 mg R + 750 mg A + 200 mg C, twice daily) 
      and 50 cases with R40C800 (20 mg R + 750 mg A + 400 mg C, twice daily); 148 cases
      with treated with LAC (30 mg L + 750 mg A + 200 mg C, twice daily). RESULTS:
      According to intention-to-treat and per protocol analyses, the eradication rates 
      were 88% and 91% with RAC and 78% and 81% with LAC; the eradication rates with
      R20C400, R40C400 and R40C800 were 94%, 81% and 86%, respectively, in the
      intention-to-treat analysis. In addition, the eradication rates for
      clarithromycin-sensitive strains with RAC and LAC were 98% and 89%, respectively,
      and for clarithromycin-resistant strains with RAC and LAC were 8.1% and 0%,
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The eradication rate was significantly higher with RAC
      than LAC. The eradication rate for clarithromycin-resistant strains was low in
      both groups, and an improved eradication rate could not be achieved by changing
      the dose of clarithromycin or proton pump inhibitor.

TI  - Randomised controlled trial of pantoprazole versus ranitidine for the treatment
      of uninvestigated heartburn in primary care.
PG  - 423-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether pantoprazole (20 mg/d) produces significantly 
      greater symptom control than ranitidine (300 mg/d) in patients with
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). DESIGN: Multicentre, randomised,
      double-blind, parallel-group comparison. SETTING: 76 general practices in
      north-west Sydney and Newcastle, New South Wales (Australia), from 19 January
      1999 to 22 September 2000. PATIENTS: 307 patients aged 18 years or over
      presenting with symptomatic GORD. INTERVENTIONS: Pantoprazole (20 mg once daily) 
      or ranitidine (150 mg twice daily). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient-assessed
      frequency and severity of heartburn using the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating
      Scale (GSRS) and a patient heartburn diary. RESULTS: Pantoprazole was associated 
      with significantly higher rates of complete control of GORD symptoms than
      ranitidine at four weeks (40% v 19%; P < 0.001), eight weeks (55% v 33%; P <
      0.001), six months (71% v 56%; P = 0.007) and 12 months (77% v 59%; P = 0.001).
      CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose pantoprazole is an effective alternative to standard-dose
      ranitidine for initial and maintenance treatment of patients with symptomatic
      GORD.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori: when is treatment now indicated?
PG  - 465-9
AB  - The prevalence of Helicobacter pylori in Western societies has rapidly declined, 
      as reflected by the consistent decline in peptic ulcer disease. Nevertheless,
      there remains a cohort of the elderly population with a high prevalence of H.
      pylori infection. While the benefits of H. pylori eradication for H.
      pylori-associated duodenal ulcer disease is beyond dispute, a number of
      contentious areas remains. The aim of the present paper is to review the benefits
      of H. pylori eradication in clinical situations that may confront the
      non-gastroenterologist.

TI  - Azithromycin in a triple therapy for H.pylori eradication in active duodenal
      ulcer.
PG  - 879-82
AB  - AIM: To assess and compare the efficacy and safety of two triple regimes: A)
      metronidazole, amoxicillin and omeprazole, which is still widely used in Russia, 
      and B) azithromycin, amoxicillin and omeprazole in healing active duodenal ulcer 
      and H.pylori eradication. METHODS: 100 patients with active duodenal ulcer were
      included in the open, multicentre, randomized study with comparative groups.
      Patients were randomly assigned to one of the following one-week triple regimes: 
      A) metronidazole 500 mg bid, amoxicillin 1 g bid and omeprazole 20 mg bid (OAM,
      n=50) and B) azithromycin 1 g od for the first 3 days (total dose 3 g),
      amoxicillin 1 g bid and omeprazole 20 mg bid (OAA, n=50). Omeprazole 20 mg od was
      given after the eradication course as a monotherapy for three weeks. The control 
      endoscopy was performed 8 weeks after the entry. H.pylori infection was
      determined in the entry of the study and four weeks after the cessation of
      treatment by means of histology and CLO-test. RESULTS: 97 patients completed the 
      study according to the protocol (1 patient of the OAM group did not come to the
      control endoscopy, 2 patients of the OAA group stopped the treatment because of
      mild allergic urticaria). Duodenal ulcers were healed in 48 patients of the OAM
      group (96 %; CI 90.5-100 %) and in 46 patients of the OAA group (92 %; CI
      89.5-94.5 %) (p=ns). H.pylori infection was eradicated in 15 out of 50 patients
      with OAM (30 %; CI 17-43 %) and in 36 out of 50 patients treated with OAA (72 %; 
      CI 59-85 %) (P<0.001)- ITT analysis. CONCLUSION: The triple therapy with
      omeprazole, amoxicillin and metronidazole failed to eradicate H.pylori in the
      majority of patients, which is an essential argument to withdraw this regimen out
      of the national recommendations. Macrolide with amoxicillin are preferable to
      achieve higher eradication rates. Azithromycin (1 g od for the first 3 days) can 
      be considered as a successful component of the triple PPI-based regimen.

TI  - Tolerability of once-weekly alendronate in patients with osteoporosis: a
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 1044-52
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract tolerability of
      once-weekly oral alendronate, 70 mg, and placebo. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was 
      a 12-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The
      first patient initiated treatment on June 5, 2000, and the last patient completed
      treatment on March 1, 2001. The study enrolled 450 postmenopausal women and men
      with osteoporosis (224 took alendronate, 226 took placebo) who were ambulatory
      and community dwelling at 48 outpatient study centers in the United States. By
      design, approximately half of the patients were naive to bisphosphonates. The
      primary end point was upper GI tract tolerability based on the incidence of any
      upper GI tract adverse events. Secondary end points included the number of
      discontinuations due to drug-related upper GI tract adverse events and the change
      from baseline in bone resorption, assessed by the urinary
      N-telopeptide-creatinine ratio at 12 weeks. A subgroup analysis of the primary
      and secondary end points was performed on the patients stratified by prior
      bisphosphonate use. The safety and tolerability of the weekly alendronate and
      placebo regimens were captured as clinical and laboratory adverse events.
      RESULTS: A total of 11% of the alendronate patients and 13% of the placebo
      patients reported an upper GI tract adverse event. Discontinuations due to
      drug-related upper GI tract adverse events occurred in 3% of alendronate patients
      and 1% of placebo patients. The differences between the treatment groups for the 
      primary and secondary end points were not significant. For the primary end point,
      the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval of the difference was well within 
      the prespecified 14% comparability bound (-2.2%; 95% confidence interval, -8.3%
      to 3.9%). The overall incidence of upper GI tract adverse events was lower in the
      subgroup of patients with prior bisphosphonate exposure (8%) than in those who
      were bisphosphonate naive (16%). However, regardless of prior bisphosphonate
      exposure, the incidence of upper GI tract adverse events was similar between the 
      alendronate and placebo patients. The urinary N-telopeptide-creatinine ratio
      showed a significant decrease in the alendronate patients (72% of baseline,
      P<.001) compared with a slight increase in the placebo patients (106% of
      baseline) at week 12. CONCLUSION: In this 3-month study, the incidence of upper
      GI tract adverse events in patients treated with once-weekly alendronate, 70 mg, 
      was comparable to that with placebo.

TI  - Detecting Helicobacter pylori infection in hospitalized frail older patients: the
      challenge.
PG  - 1674-80
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Helicobacter pylori infection has not been well studied in older
      people, especially in hospitalized, frail patients. The aim of our study was to
      evaluate the prevalence of the infection in this population using five H. pylori 
      diagnostic tests. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Geriatric
      acute care unit of the Department of Geriatrics (Hopital Xavier Arnozan, Pessac, 
      France). PARTICIPANTS: One hundred seven consecutively hospitalized patients with
      a diagnostic indication for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. MEASUREMENTS:
      Geriatric assessment, information on drug intake, indication/results of gastric
      endoscopy, and results of H. pylori infection diagnostic tests (culture and
      histological analysis on biopsy specimens, serology, 13carbon-urea breath test
      (13C-UBT), detection of H. pylori stool antigens (HpSA)) were assessed for each
      included patient. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients (47.7%) were H. pylori positive
      with at least one test. 13C-UBT was more frequently positive than the other four 
      tests, with a significant difference from culture, histological analysis, and
      HpSA (P <.05). Positive 13C-UBT results were significantly associated with H.
      pylori presence using histological analysis and neutrophil activity of the antrum
      and corpus. Antibiotic treatments significantly decreased the positivity rate of 
      all of the tests performed, and severe corpus atrophy decreased the positivity
      rate of culture, histological analysis, and HpSA. CONCLUSIONS: Almost one-third
      of the H. pylori-positive patients would have remained undetected without
      performing the 13C-UBT. The low prevalence of H. pylori detection in these
      hospitalized, frail patients may be explained by the high frequency of current
      and previous antibiotic treatments.

TI  - Etiology of dyspepsia: implications for empirical therapy.
PG  - 635-41
AB  - Dyspepsia describes a symptom complex thought to arise in the upper
      gastrointestinal tract and includes, in addition to epigastric pain or
      discomfort, symptoms such as heartburn, acid regurgitation, excessive burping or 
      belching, a feeling of slow digestion, early satiety, nausea and bloating. Based 
      on the evidence that heartburn cannot be reliably distinguished from other
      dyspeptic symptoms, the Rome definition appears to be too narrow and restrictive.
      It is particularly ill suited to the management of uninvestigated dyspepsia at
      the level of primary care. In patients presenting with uninvestigated dyspepsia, 
      a symptom benefit is associated with a 'test and treat' approach for Helicobacter
      pylori infection. A substantial proportion of those who do not benefit prove to
      have esophagitis on endoscopy. In those with functional dyspepsia, the benefits
      of H pylori eradication, if any, appear to be modest. Hence, a 'symptom and
      treat' acid-suppression trial with proton pump inhibitors, and a 'test and treat'
      strategy for H pylori are two acceptable empirical therapies for patients with
      univestigated dyspepsia.

TI  - Motion--Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication is more cost effective than oral PPI
      administration: arguments against the motion.
PG  - 627-31
AB  - Discussion of the cost effectiveness of medical and surgical treatments of
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is plagued by a number of logical
      fallacies. Several of these defects in reasoning are reviewed. For example, it is
      inappropriate to compare the costs of therapies unless they are equally
      effective. The relative cost effectiveness of various treatment options is
      difficult to determine because monetary expenditures and gains in health status
      cannot easily be measured in commensurate units. Not everything can be translated
      into incremental cost effectiveness ratios. Two decision analyses from European
      investigators seemed to show that Nissen fundoplication was more cost effective
      than long term acid-suppression therapy, but they failed to consider the costs of
      surgical complications and failures. The most comprehensive decision analysis,
      employing a Markov chain model, found that the two treatment options were roughly
      equivalent, at least during the first seven years of follow-up. Decision analyses
      often do not reflect actual practice patterns and cannot provide solutions to
      problems that cannot be solved by appropriate medical reasoning. Moreover,
      results that are reported by specialized surgical centres probably cannot be
      duplicated by less experienced surgeons. The increasing incidence of esophageal
      adenocarcinoma has been erroneously attributed to the use of potent
      acid-suppressant medications, but the actual cause has been shown to be the
      decreased prevalence of Helicobacter pylori. There are no significant differences
      in the incidence of this tumour after medical or surgical therapy of GERD. It is 
      unlikely, however, that arguments will convince proponents of one treatment or
      another to change their opinions.

TI  - Motion--Helicobacter pylori causes or worsens GERD: arguments against the motion.
PG  - 615-7
AB  - Data from large epidemiological studies show that Helicobacter pylori is less
      prevalent in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) than in control
      subjects. The more virulent cagA-positive strains of the organism are also less
      commonly seen in patients with erosive esophagitis and in those with Barrett's
      esophagus than in those with less severe forms of GERD. Although the relationship
      between H pylori and gastric physiology is complex, the organism has little
      effect on acid secretion in most North American or Western European subjects, and
      has a net suppressive effect, especially in elderly subjects, in other parts of
      the world. Thus, the organism has a potential protective effect against GERD,
      which is exacerbated by gastric acidity. H pylori has no proven effect on other
      gastric factors that might provoke reflux, including delayed gastric emptying or 
      inappropriate relaxation of the gastric fundus. Two well-designed interventional 
      studies have found that eradication of H pylori either provoked GERD or had no
      effect. A third smaller study, which seemed to demonstrate that persistent
      infection was associated with GERD, was flawed, in that the two treatment groups 
      were not comparable. The evidence thus does not support the idea that H pylori
      infection provokes or aggravates GERD.

TI  - Motion--Helicobacter pylori worsens GERD: arguments for the motion.
PG  - 611-4
AB  - There are several reasons for eradicating Helicobacter pylori in patients with
      chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Perhaps the most compelling is
      the evidence that chronic acid suppression therapy can lead to the development of
      atrophic gastritis, a premalignant condition, in patients with H pylori
      infection. Epidemiological data that suggest that H pylori is less prevalent in
      GERD patients than in control subjects may be susceptible to publication bias,
      and confounding social and environmental factors may also be involved. Although
      it has been thought that eradication of the organism might lead to increased
      esophageal acid exposure, this has not been demonstrated in practice. Studies
      that appeared to show that GERD could be provoked by antimicrobial therapy of
      duodenal ulcers also have methodological weaknesses. Underlying GERD symptoms
      might be unmasked after withdrawal of acid-suppression therapy, for reasons that 
      are unrelated to H pylori. In fact, eradication of the organism has been shown to
      decrease heartburn in patients with peptic ulcer disease. When H pylori is
      successfully eradicated in patients with GERD, relapse rates are not increased,
      and the disease-free interval seems to be prolonged. Eradication of the organism 
      is a wise policy in patients who face long term acid-suppression therapy for
      GERD.

AB  - AIM: Comparison of two treatment regimens of eradication treatment of duodenal
      ulcer (DU) associated with Helicobacter pylori based on fromilid
      (clarithromycin). MATERIAL AND METHODS: 20 DU patients associated with HP were
      divided into two groups. 10 patients of group 1 received omeprazol, fromilid and 
      metronidazol and 10 patients of group 2 were given omeprazol, fromilid and
      furasolidon for 7 days followed by 2-week omeprazol alone. The patients were
      examined clinically and endoscopically; HP were detected with a fast urease test 
      and polymerase chain reaction before and after the treatment. Control
      examinations were performed 6 weeks after the medication. RESULTS: In group 1
      duodenal healing was observed in all the 10 patients, HP eradication occurred in 
      9 of 10 patients by urease test and in 4 patients by PCR, in group 2 in 8 of 10, 
      10 of 10 and 10 of 10, respectively. CONCLUSION: Fromilid (clarithromycin) is
      effective in eradication treatment in combination with fromilid and metronidazol 
      or furazolidon.

TI  - Effect of H. pylori status on gastric ulcer healing in patients continuing
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory therapy and receiving treatment with lansoprazole 
      or ranitidine.
PG  - 2208-14
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this research was to determine the impact of
      pretreatment Helicobacter pylori infection on gastric ulcer healing rates in
      patients receiving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and
      antisecretory medications. METHODS: This was a pooled, prospective analysis of
      two identical double blind, multicenter, parallel group studies. Six hundred
      ninety-two patients receiving NSAIDs and with endoscopy-documented gastric ulcers
      were enrolled from 90 North American sites in primary care and referral centers. 
      Patients were randomized to receive ranitidine (150 mg b.i.d.) or lansoprazole
      (15 mg or 30 mg once daily) for 8 wk. Ulcer healing was assessed by endoscopy at 
      4 and 8 wk in an intent-to-treat population. H. pylori status was determined at
      baseline by histology. RESULTS: Across all three treatment groups, gastric ulcers
      were more likely to heal and heal faster if the individual was infected with H.
      pylori. Healing rates at 8 wk were statistically significantly greater among H.
      pylori positive patients (n = 181) than among negative patients (n = 497) (70% vs
      61%, respectively; p < 0.05), especially among those with large ulcers (> 10 mm) 
      and in younger patients (< 60 yr old). Simple healing rates (regardless of H.
      pylori status) were significantly better in the 15- and 30-mg lansoprazole groups
      than in the ranitidine group after 4 wk (46%, 54%, and 32%, respectively; p < or 
      = 0.01) and 8 wk (66%, 74%, and 50%, respectively; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In
      patients receiving NSAIDs, gastric ulcer healing with an antisecretory agent is
      significantly enhanced in the presence of H. pylori infection.

PG  - 933-41
AB  - The discovery of Helicobacter pylori has greatly changed our approach to peptic
      ulcer disease. Bacterial, host, and environmental factors all have a role in
      peptic-ulcer disease. Although the prevalence of uncomplicated peptic ulcers is
      falling, hospital admissions for ulcer complications associated with
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are rising. Evidence suggests that
      prescription of NSAIDs along with potent antiulcer agents and the use of highly
      selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors reduce gastroduodenal ulceration. Whether 
      these therapeutic advances will translate into clinical benefits remains to be
      seen. The interaction between H pylori and NSAIDs is one of the most
      controversial issues in peptic ulcer disease. With the fall in rates of H pylori 
      infection, the proportion of ulcers not related to this organism and NSAIDs has
      risen, which will affect the management of peptic ulcer.

TI  - Short course of omeprazole: a better first diagnostic approach to noncardiac
      chest pain than endoscopy, manometry, or 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring.
PG  - 307-14
AB  - Noncardiac chest pain (NCCP) presents as a frequent diagnostic challenge, with
      patients tending to use a disproportionate level of health care resources.
      Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is the most frequent cause of NCCP. GOALS:
      To test the efficacy of a potent acid-suppressing agent as a diagnostic test in
      the evaluation of NCCP and to compare it with three commonly used tests. STUDY:
      Eighteen men and 24 women, aged 22 to 77 years, who presented with recurrent
      chest pain complaints of a noncardiac etiology, as determined by rest/stress
      perfusion imaging with technetium Tc99m sestamibi (MIBI), were enrolled in a
      prospective, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover trial using high-dose 
      omeprazole. Thirty-seven patients completed both arms of the trial. Findings were
      compared with those of endoscopy, manometry, and ambulatory 24-hour two-channel
      esophageal pH monitoring. All patients underwent initial diagnostic upper
      endoscopy, esophageal manometry, and 24-hour pH monitoring. Patients were then
      randomly assigned to either placebo or omeprazole (40 mg/d orally twice daily)
      for 14 days, washed out for 21 days, and then crossed over. Patient's symptoms
      were determined using a Visual Analogue Scale to measure the severity of chest
      pain before and after each period. RESULTS: Seventy-one percent of patients in
      the omeprazole arm reported improved chest pain, whereas only 18% in the placebo 
      arm did. Abnormal results on manometry (20%), 24-hour pH monitoring (42%), or
      endoscopy with visual evidence of esophagitis (26%) were found less frequently.
      Combination of the three tests did not significantly increase their usefulness.
      In NCCP patients with GERD, as defined by positive results on a 24-hour pH test
      or presence of esophagitis on endoscopy, omeprazole treatment led to a response
      in 95% of patients, whereas 90% of GERD-positive patients treated with placebo
      did not respond. Of NCCP patients determined to be GERD negative, 39% responded
      to omeprazole. CONCLUSIONS: Omeprazole as a first diagnostic tool in the
      evaluation of MIBI-negative NCCP is sensitive and specific for determining the
      cause of NCCP. Endoscopy, manometry, and 24-hour pH monitoring were not only less
      sensitive in diagnosing NCCP, but they were significantly more expensive.

TI  - Gastroesophageal reflux in children: pathogenesis, prevalence, diagnosis, and
      role of proton pump inhibitors in treatment.
PG  - 673-85
AB  - A substantial percentage of infants, children and adolescents experience
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and its accompanying symptoms, as well as 
      disease complications. The diagnosis of GERD in children is made based upon the
      child's history, and data derived primarily from pH monitoring tests and
      endoscopy. In those children with confirmed reflux disease, the options for
      management parallel those recommended in adult patients, with the first step
      consisting of lifestyle changes. Surgical procedures may also be performed;
      however, these are rarely recommended prior to an adequate course of
      pharmacologic therapy, and appropriate case selection is important. Among the
      current pharmacotherapeutic options available in the US, the prokinetic agents
      and the acid-inhibitory agents (histamine-2 receptor antagonists, proton pump
      inhibitors) are the most widely used. The clinical utility of the prokinetic
      agents has been limited by the recent withdrawal of cisapride from the US
      marketplace and the potential for irreversible central nervous system
      complications with metoclopramide. Numerous clinical studies performed in adults,
      and several studies involving children, have demonstrated that the proton pump
      inhibitors are more effective than the histamine-2 receptor antagonists in the
      relief of GERD symptoms and healing of erosive esophagitis. In children,
      omeprazole and lansoprazole may be administered as the intact oral capsule, or in
      those who are unable or unwilling to swallow, the granule contents of the capsule
      may be mixed with soft foods (e.g. apple sauce) or fruit drinks/liquid dietary
      supplements prior to oral administration with no detrimental effects on
      pharmacokinetics, bioavailability, or pharmacodynamics. Studies performed with
      omeprazole and lansoprazole in children have shown pharmacokinetic parameters
      that closely resemble those observed in adults. In over a decade of use in
      adults, the proton pump inhibitor class of agents has been found to have a good
      safety profile. Studies involving children have also shown these agents to be
      well tolerated. In numerous drug-drug interaction studies performed with these
      two proton pump inhibitors, relatively few clinically significant interactions
      have been observed.

TI  - Risk assessment and prediction of rebleeding in bleeding gastroduodenal ulcer.
PG  - 778-86
AB  - BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: The aims of this study were to identify risk factors
      for recurrence of hemorrhage in bleeding gastroduodenal ulcers after endoscopic
      injection therapy, and to develop a simple and relevant prognostic score which
      could be used to assess the early risk of recurrence and the residual risk of
      rebleeding. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective study was conducted from January 
      1995 to December 1998, in 738 patients who were admitted to our department for
      acute bleeding peptic ulcer and who underwent endoscopic examination. Ulcers with
      active bleeding or signs of recent bleeding were treated with injection therapy
      using epinephrine (1/10,000) and 1% polidocanol. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis
      revealed that liver cirrhosis, recent surgery, systolic blood pressure below 100 
      mmHg, hematemesis, Forrest classification, and ulcer size and site were
      significantly predictive variables for the recurrence of hemorrhage. Among these,
      Forrest classification was the most important. The overall accuracy of the
      predictive model was 71% (95% CI = 63 - 79%). The model showed a better
      sensitivity of 90% for early rebleeding (< 48 hours) than for late rebleeding (> 
      or = 48 hours) where the sensitivity was 65 %. A prognostic score was obtained
      and patients were classified into four risk classes: very low (VL), low (L), high
      (H), and very high (VH). The rebleeding rates for the four classes were 0%, 7.9%,
      31.8% and 67.9%, and the mortality rates were 5.9%, 8.6%, 13.9% and 35.7%,
      respectively. The residual risk of rebleeding after 48 hours was 0%, 3.3%, 10.4%,
      and 14.3% in the VL, L, H and VH classes, respectively. After 5 days the residual
      risk was under 4% in all classes. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the
      proposed prognostic score, which is easily obtained after emergency endoscopy, is
      useful in clinical practice because it can identify patients with different
      levels of rebleeding risk. It can be helpful in patient management and decision
      making for discharge.

AB  - Laparoscopic antireflux surgery has been performed in neurologically impaired and
      scoliotic children. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of laparoscopic
      fundoplication in mentally normal children with gastroesophageal reflux disease
      that failed to respond to medical therapy. Data were prospectively collected
      (symptoms, medical therapy, endoscopies' findings) on 12 children (nine boys,
      three girls) aged 9-15 years with gastroesophageal reflux disease. Pre- and
      postoperative ambulatory 24-h pH and DeMeester and Johnson scores were also
      recorded. Effectiveness of surgery was assessed by comparison of pre- and
      postoperative total acid exposure time, Visick grade, need for antireflux
      medication and symptom scores. In total, 11 children underwent a laparoscopic
      Nissen fundoplication and one underwent a Toupet procedure. Median length of stay
      was 2 (2-3) nights. The median preoperative pH acid exposure time (AET) was 4.7
      (0.8-16.4) percent compared with postoperative AET of 0.4 (0-3) percent. Early
      postoperative dysphagia occurred in four out of 12 patients, requiring a total of
      six dilatations. Postoperative Visick scores were: grade I=7 and grade II=5.
      Laparoscopic fundoplication can be safely performed and is effective in children 
      with GERD who have failed to respond to medical therapy.

TI  - Photodynamic therapy for Barrett's esophagus: a review.
PG  - 137-44
AB  - Barrett's esophagus is the major risk factor for the development of esophageal
      adenocarcinoma, which is increasing in incidence faster than any other cancer in 
      the Western world. Barrett's esophagus has previously been considered an
      irreversible lesion that required life-long surveillance to detect malignant
      transformation. However, endoscopic ablative techniques to destroy the abnormal
      mucosa and allow squamous regeneration have now been developed. Photodynamic
      therapy (PDT) is a non-thermal technique where the interaction of a
      photosensitizer in the tissues and light of a known wavelength results in tissue 
      destruction. It appears to be an effective tool for ablating dysplasia and
      superficial cancers in Barrett's esophagus. The status of PDT for this disease is
      reviewed.

TI  - Dietary antioxidants and DNA damage in patients on long-term acid-suppression
      therapy: a randomized controlled study.
PG  - 265-71
AB  - Free radicals and reactive species produced in vivo can trigger cell damage and
      DNA modifications resulting in carcinogenesis. Dietary antioxidants trap these
      species limiting their damage. The present study evaluated the role of vitamins C
      and E in the prevention of potentially premalignant modifications to DNA in the
      human stomach by supplementing patients who, because of hypochlorhydria and
      possible depletion of gastric antioxidants, could be at increased risk of gastric
      cancer. Patients undergoing surveillance for Barrett's oesophagus (n 100), on
      long-term proton pump inhibitors were randomized into two groups: vitamin C (500 
      mg twice/d) and vitamin E (100 mg twice/d) for 12 weeks (the supplemented group) 
      or placebo. Those attending for subsequent endoscopy had gastric juice, plasma
      and mucosal measurements of vitamin levels and markers of DNA damage. Seventy-two
      patients completed the study. Plasma ascorbic acid, total vitamin C and vitamin E
      were elevated in the supplemented group consistent with compliance. Gastric juice
      ascorbic acid and total vitamin C levels were raised significantly in the
      supplemented group (P=0.01) but supplementation had no effect on the mucosal
      level of this vitamin. However, gastric juice ascorbic acid and total vitamin C
      were within normal ranges in the unsupplemented group. Mucosal malondialdehyde,
      chemiluminescence and DNA damage levels in the comet assay were unaffected by
      vitamin supplementation. In conclusion, supplementation does not affect DNA
      damage in this group of patients. This is probably because long-term inhibition
      of the gastric proton pump alone does not affect gastric juice ascorbate and
      therefore does not increase the theoretical risk of gastric cancer because of
      antioxidant depletion.

TI  - Short-term omeprazole treatment does not influence biochemical parameters of bone
      turnover in children.
PG  - 129-32
AB  - Gastric proton pump inhibitors are widely used in the treatment of dyspeptic
      problems and for the eradication of H. pylori infection. Data are not available
      on whether omeprazole, a representative of proton pump inhibitors, influences the
      function of osteoclastic H+-pump in children. We studied the impact of short-term
      omeprazole administration on the biochemical parameters of bone turnover in
      pediatric patients. Urinary calcium excretion, serum total alkaline phosphatase
      activity, collagen type 1 crosslinked C-telopeptide, and osteocalcin levels were 
      determined in 34 children [20 girls (9 prepubertal) and 14 boys (6 prepubertal)] 
      before and after 2 weeks of omeprazole treatment at a dose of 20 mg/day. The
      measured parameters were within the healthy reference range in each patient. None
      of them altered during the study in any age or in any gender. We conclude that
      omeprazole, at a dose of 20 mg/day, does not significantly influence the
      investigated biochemical parameters of osteoclast and osteoblast function in
      pediatric patients.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori infection in geriatrics.
PG  - 56-62
AB  - The prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection increases with age worldwide.
      However, the percentage of H. pylori-positive elderly patients who are tested and
      treated for their infection remains very low. We now have data that demonstrate
      the benefit of curing H. pylori infection in elderly patients with H.
      pylori-associated peptic ulcer disease and severe chronic gastritis. Furthermore,
      the cure of H. pylori may prevent progression of intestinal metaplasia and
      gastric atrophy. Studies are needed to clarify the role of eradication for
      elderly patients who have nonulcer dyspepsia, gastroesophageal reflux disease and
      who use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. H. pylori infection may be easily
      diagnosed by histological evaluation, rapid urease test or culture performed on
      gastric biopsies taken during endoscopy. However, the biopsy site must be
      carefully selected in elderly patients. For noninvasive monitoring of H. pylori
      infection after treatment, the 13C-urea breath test has significantly higher
      accuracy than serology in the elderly. The role of the H. pylori stool antigen
      test in old age still needs to be clarified. One-week PPI-based triple therapy
      regimens including clarithromycin, amoxycillin and/or nitroimidazoles are highly 
      effective and well tolerated in elderly patients. Low doses of both PPIs and
      clarithromycin (in combination with standard doses of amoxycillin or
      nitroimidazoles) are sufficient. Antibiotic resistance and low compliance are the
      main factors related to treatment failure at any age.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori: the challenge in therapy.
PG  - 43-9
AB  - For the therapeutic management of Helicobacter pylori infection, the Maastricht
      2-2000 Consensus Report have introduced the concept of the 'treatment package'
      that considers first- and second-line eradication therapies together. According
      to this consensus statement, the first-line therapy for H. pylori eradication is 
      a combination of the proton pump inhibitors (PPI) or ranitidine bismuth citrate
      (RBC) and claritromycin plus either amoxicillin or metronidazole. The second-line
      treatment is suggested to be PPI-quadruple therapy for a minimum of 7 days. If
      bismuth compounds are not available, PPI-based triple therapy will have to be
      used as a second-line treatment only after susceptibility testing. Since no
      considerable progress has been made during the past year in treatment regimens,
      there is still a need for new compounds that are specific for H. pylori, which
      could constitute future therapies.

PG  - 553-61
AB  - Scleroderma is a relatively rare disorder in children. Among its subsets,
      localized scleroderma is more common in children than the systemic variety. No
      exciting new finding was reported in 2001 specifically applicable to childhood
      scleroderma. However, many new advances in our understanding of the growth
      factors, cytokines, and chemokines were reported. These studies should help us to
      understand the pathogenesis of early lesions of scleroderma, vascular changes,
      and fibrosis and perhaps lead us toward more rational therapy.

AB  - After discovery of H. pylori, management of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is getting
      much easier. However, four thousands a year still died caused by this disease in 
      Japan. Ten to twenty percent of the non-NSAIDs ulcer could be expected to remain 
      after complete eradication of H. pylori; The number could be still
      100,000-200,000 a year in Japan. Furthermore, NSAIDs ulcer would not decrease in 
      number in the post-H. pylori era. Recurrence of ulcer is related to the quality
      of ulcer healing. Deficiency of prostaglandins(PG) in the mucosa is another main 
      reason than H. pylori infection of poor quality of ulcer healing. Therefore, a PG
      analogue may be a most reasonable tool for treatment of H. pylori-negative PUD
      including NSAIDs ulcer, but is often poorly tolerated because of diarrhea and
      abdominal pain. The mucosal damage caused by NSAIDs is also gastric
      acid-dependent and so, an H2-receptor antagonist is to some extent effective
      although the efficacy is far behind of that with a PG-analogue. Recently, a
      proton-pump inhibitor has been reported to exert the same effect as a PG-analogue
      in healing of gastroduodenal mucosal damage caused by NSAIDs and the superior
      effect in preventing recurrence of the damage with better tolerance. This results
      suggest that strong acid inhibition is highly effective for such damage. Whether 
      such strong acid inhibition causes disturbance of absorption of NSAIDs is not
      clear, which might result in poor antiinflammatory effect. Elderly patients often
      have tendency of constipation and less possibility of pregnancy. Therefore, a
      PG-analogue may be not only safe but also more favorable for such patients.

TI  - Treatment modalities and outcome of the renal victims of the Marmara earthquake.
PG  - 64-71
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Treatment of renal problems during natural catastrophes is
      highly complicated both for medical and logistic reasons. The therapeutic
      interventions applied to and the outcome of 639 victims with acute renal problems
      during the catastrophic Marmara earthquake have been the subject of this study.
      METHODS: Questionnaires regarding information about 63 clinical and laboratory
      variables were sent to 35 reference hospitals that treated the victims.
      Information considering therapeutic interventions and outcome obtained through
      these questionnaires was submitted to analysis. RESULTS: At least one form of
      renal replacement therapy was administered to 477 (74.6%) of the 639 victims. Of 
      these, 437, 11, and 4 were treated solely by intermittent hemodialysis,
      continuous renal replacement therapy, and peritoneal dialysis, respectively; 25
      victims needed more than one dialysis modality. In total, 5,137 hemodialysis
      sessions were performed. Also, 2,981, 2,837 and 2,594 units of blood, fresh
      frozen plasma, and human albumin were administered, respectively. Transfusion of 
      these products was usually associated with higher rates of dialysis needs and
      mortality. Ninety-seven patients (15.2%) died. The mortality rate of dialyzed
      victims was higher as compared to nondialyzed ones (17.2 vs. 9.3%, p = 0.015).
      CONCLUSIONS: Massive amounts of dialysis treatment as well as blood and blood
      product transfusions can be necessary in the treatment of catastrophic earthquake
      victims with nephrological problems. Despite the potential risk of a high
      mortality, in the case of appropriate and energetic medical interventions,
      reasonable final outcomes can be achieved.

TI  - Posterior laryngitis: effects of treatment with omeprazole alone.
PG  - 123-30
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of omeprazole treatment on the symptoms and
      lesions of patients with posterior laryngitis (PL). PATIENTS AND METHOD:
      Twenty-one patients with a clinical and laryngoscopic diagnosis of PL were
      studied. Results for each laryngeal symptom (dysphonia, hoarseness, cough,
      foreign body sensation, and burning) and laryngoscopic finding (mucus stasis,
      erythema, oedema, hypertrophy, ulceration, and granulation) at baseline, 12 weeks
      after treatment with omeprazole, 20 mg twice daily, and 12 weeks after treatment 
      discontinuation were compared. No changes in their hygienic-dietary or postural
      habits were recommended. RESULTS: A reduction in symptom severity and frequency
      was observed (p < 0.05), as well as in the severity of laryngoscopic findings (p 
      < 0.05)--except for granulation--immediately after treatment discontinuation. A
      relapse of laryngoscopic findings was seen at 12 weeks after treatment
      discontinuation (p < 0.01). The trend towards symptom recurrence was not
      significant. CONCLUSION: Treatment with omeprazole alone modifies clinical
      manifestations and endoscopic findings in patients with PL. Controlled clinical
      trials with a high number of patients and longer-term follow-up are needed to
      define the best therapeutic regimen for these patients.

TI  - [Evaluation of efficacy, safety and tolerability rabeprazole in treatment of
      acid-peptic diseases ].
PG  - 60-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rabeprazole, a substituted benzimidazole, represents a new generation
      of proton pump inhibitors that has recently been approved by the FDA and European
      Union for treatment of acid-related diseases. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy 
      and tolerability of rabeprazole 20 mg in actual conditions of use in everyday
      clinical practice on subjects with diagnosis of erosive gastroesophageal reflux
      disease and/or gastric and/or duodenal ulcer. PATIENTS/METHODS: A total of 171
      outpatients (55% men, 45% women) with a mean age of 42.5 years were enrolled in
      this trial. The majority of subjects (81.0%) were Caucasians. Patients with
      endoscopically confirmed erosive/ulcerative gastroesophageal reflux disease
      (Savary-Miller classification), duodenal ulcer and/or benign gastric ulcer were
      eligible to receive rabeprazole 20 mg once daily for 4 to 8 weeks, depending on
      the diagnosis and at investigators' discretion. Patients were requested to record
      their symptoms in a diary card in a daily basis. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty
      two patients completed the study in accordance with the protocol. Reflux
      esophagitis was diagnosed in 78 (48.1%) patients, duodenal ulcer in 39 (24.1%)
      and gastric ulcer in 24 (14.8%). Eleven (6.8%) patients presented reflux
      esophagitis associated with duodenal ulcer and 7 (4.3%) associated with gastric
      ulcer. Finally, 3 (1.9%) presented both gastric and duodenal ulcer. Fifty-three
      percentage of patients were free of symptoms on the first day of treatment and
      89.5% after a week. The healing rate was 84.4% for patients with reflux
      esophagitis, 90.6% for duodenal ulcer and 90.9% for gastric ulcer. The adverse
      effects were minimal and transitory. CONCLUSIONS: Rabeprazole is highly effective
      and well tolerated in acute healing of reflux esophagitis and peptic ulcers. In
      addition, it provides fast symptoms relief.

TI  - Efficacy of quadruple therapy with pantoprazole, bismuth, tetracycline and
      metronidazole as rescue treatment for Helicobacter pylori infection.
PG  - 1457-60
AB  - AIM: To study the efficacy of a 7-day quadruple regimen combining pantoprazole,
      bismuth, tetracycline and metronidazole as rescue treatment for Helicobacter
      pylori infection after failure of standard triple therapy. METHODS: A prospective
      study was made of 140 patients infected with H. pylori and diagnosed with peptic 
      ulcer or non-ulcer dyspepsia in whom triple therapy with proton pump inhibitor,
      clarithromycin and amoxicillin had failed. The patients were treated with
      quadruple therapy including pantoprazole, 40 mg twice daily, colloidal bismuth
      subcitrate, 120 mg four times daily, tetracycline, 500 mg four times daily, and
      metronidazole, 500 mg three times daily, for 7 days. Two months after completion 
      of therapy, a 13C-urea breath test was performed to confirm eradication. RESULTS:
      With quadruple therapy, the H. pylori eradication rates were 82% (95% confidence 
      interval (CI), 75-88%) by 'intention-to-treat' and 85% (95% CI, 79-91%) by 'per
      protocol'. No major side-effects were observed. No differences in eradication
      success were observed in relation to underlying disease (peptic ulcer: 85% (95%
      CI, 76-91%) vs. non-ulcer dyspepsia: 83% (95% CI, 68-93%)) or smoking habits
      (smokers: 86% (95% CI, 75-93%) vs. non-smokers: 83% (95% CI, 71-91%)).
      CONCLUSION: Quadruple therapy with pantoprazole, bismuth, tetracycline and
      metronidazole for 7 days is an effective H. pylori eradication treatment for
      patients in whom standard triple therapy has failed.

TI  - Impact of Helicobacter pylori eradication on heartburn in patients with gastric
      or duodenal ulcer disease -- results from a randomized trial programme.
PG  - 1431-42
AB  - BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori infection has been proposed as a protective
      factor against the development of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. AIM: To
      study heartburn and endoscopic findings before and after H. pylori eradication
      therapy in patients with peptic ulcer disease. METHODS: In a multicentre trial
      programme, patients (n = 1497) were randomized to the omeprazole triple therapy
      group or to the control group, and were followed for 1-6 months after treatment. 
      Patients in whom the infection was eradicated were compared with those in whom
      infection persisted. The severity of heartburn was measured at baseline and at
      each return visit. Endoscopy was performed 6 months after therapy in two of the
      five studies. RESULTS: In patients with duodenal ulcer, there was a significantly
      lower prevalence of heartburn after successful eradication of H. pylori relative 
      to that after failed eradication (estimated odds ratio, 0.48). The reduction in
      the prevalence of heartburn in patients with gastric ulcer was independent of the
      post-treatment H. pylori status. In studies in which ulcer relapse was included
      in the model, this factor emerged as a significant factor for heartburn. The
      observed incidence of oesophagitis at the last visit was not influenced by H.
      pylori status. CONCLUSIONS: Eradication of H. pylori in patients with peptic
      ulcer disease was associated with a reduced prevalence of heartburn. Prevention
      of ulcer relapse could be the true cause of this reduction.

TI  - Early relief of upper gastrointestinal dyspeptic symptoms: a survey of empirical 
      therapy with pantoprazole in Canadian clinical practice.
PG  - 439-50
AB  - BACKGROUND: Upper gastrointestinal symptoms attributable to gastroesophageal
      reflux disease or peptic ulcer are common, but the outcome of proton pump
      inhibitor therapy in clinical practice is not well documented. Aim: To assess the
      range of upper gastrointestinal acid-related symptoms in clinical practice and
      the rapidity of their response to pantoprazole (40 mg daily), after seven days of
      therapy. METHODS: A total of 726 Canadian physicians (65.3% family physicians)
      recorded a working diagnosis and alarm features in eligible patients, who then
      recorded the severity of eight upper gastrointestinal symptoms in a daily symptom
      diary during the first week of therapy. RESULTS: Complete data were obtained from
      2273 (37.3% male) of 3261 patients; physicians diagnosed reflux esophagitis alone
      (66.9%), peptic ulcer (9.7%), other upper gastrointestinal disorders (12.3%) and 
      reflux esophagitis with another diagnosis (11.1%). Alarm features were common
      (29.6%), but a history of gastrointestinal blood loss was rare (less than 1%).
      Mean daytime heartburn scores decreased from 2.59 to 1.40, and epigastric pain
      scores decreased from 2.54 to 1.56 over the first week (P<0.00001); the
      proportions of patients who became symptom-free were 68.1% and 55.4%,
      respectively. Decreased mean symptom scores were also observed for acid
      regurgitation (2.21 to 1.35), bloating (2.47 to 1.57), nausea (2.03 to 1.36),
      slow digestion (2.51 to 1.56) and burping (2.56 to 1.69). The percentage of
      patients with severe or very severe symptoms decreased from 53.5% to 13.8% at day
      7. The physician's initial diagnosis was not predictive of outcome. CONCLUSIONS: 
      In a predominantly primary care population with upper gastrointestinal
      acid-related symptoms, proton pump inhibitor therapy produces prompt symptomatic 
      relief in most patients. Potential alarm symptoms are common, and further
      research is required to determine the absolute risk of alarm symptoms and their
      implications for empirical therapy.

TI  - Arterial chemotherapy of 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin C in the treatment of liver
      metastases of colorectal cancer.
PG  - 663-7
AB  - AIM: Regional chemotherapy using hepatic artery catheters is a good method of
      treating patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases. We investigated the
      survival of patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer using
      5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and mitomycin C Cthrough implantable hepatic arterial
      infusion port. METHODS: Seventy-five patients with inoperable liver metastases
      from colorectal cancer were included between March, 1992 and November, 2001. We
      placed implantable hepatic arterial catheter (HAC) port by laparotomy. 5-FU, 1
      000 mg/ m(2)/d continuous infusion for five days every four weeks, was delivered 
      in the hepatic arterial catheter through the port. Mitomycin C, 30 mg/m(2)/d
      infusion in the first day every cycle through the port. Response to the treatment
      was evaluated by serial determinations of plasma CEA and imaging techniques
      consisting of computerized tomography and sonography of liver. RESULTS:
      Sixty-eight were performed hepatic artery chemotherapy and fifty-six were
      followed up among seventy-five HAC patients. Twenty-six patients(46.4 %) have
      responded and 4 complete remission were achieved. Eight patients (14.3 %) had
      stable liver metastases. Twenty-two patients (39.3 %) were progressed with
      increased tumor size and number. Twenty-nine patients(51.8%) had a decreased
      serum CEA level, while 10 patients (17.9 %) were stable and 17 patients (30.4 %) 
      had an increased serum CEA level. There were no operative death in this series.
      Complications, which occurred in 18 patients (32.1 %), were as followed: hepatic 
      artery thrombosis in 11, Upper gastric and intestinal bleeding in 3, liver
      abscess in 1, pocket infection in 1, cholangitis in 1, and hepatic artery
      pseudo-aneurysm in one patient. CONCLUSION: Combined infusion of 5-FU and
      mitomycin C by hepatic artery catheter port is an effective treatment for liver
      metastases from colorectal cancer. The high response and lower complication rates
      prove the adjuvant treatment of colorectal cancer with this treatment.

TI  - Esomeprazole 40 mg and 20 mg is efficacious in the long-term management of
      patients with endoscopy-negative gastro-oesophageal reflux disease: a
      placebo-controlled trial of on-demand therapy for 6 months.
PG  - 857-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: On-demand therapy may offer an effective approach to the long-term
      management of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) without oesophagitis. AIM:
      To examine the efficacy of the novel proton pump inhibitor esomeprazole as
      on-demand therapy in endoscopy-negative GORD. PATIENTS AND METHODS:
      Endoscopy-negative GORD patients who achieved complete resolution of heartburn
      after short-term esomeprazole or omeprazole treatment (n = 721) were randomized
      to esomeprazole 20 mg (n = 282), 40 mg (n = 293) or placebo (n = 146) on demand
      (maximum one dose/day) for 6 months. The primary and secondary efficacy endpoints
      were time to study discontinuation due to (i) unwillingness to continue and (ii) 
      inadequate control of heartburn, respectively. RESULTS: Both doses of
      esomeprazole were more effective than placebo. During the 6-month period, 42% of 
      placebo recipients discontinued treatment due to unwillingness to continue,
      compared with 8% and 11% of esomeprazole 20 mg and 40 mg recipients,
      respectively. Overall, more patients treated with esomeprazole were free from
      gastrointestinal symptoms after 6 months of on-demand therapy. CONCLUSIONS:
      Esomeprazole 20 mg was superior to placebo for on-demand treatment of GORD; a
      higher dose did not confer additional clinical benefit. Over 90% of patients were
      willing to continue on-demand treatment with esomeprazole 20 mg over a 6-month
      period.

TI  - Influence of sex and Helicobacter pylori on development and healing of
      gastroduodenal lesions in non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug users.
PG  - 344-50
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Factors predisposing to endoscopic ulcer formation or
      healing with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have not been well
      defined. METHODS: We used multivariate analysis of data from three large similar 
      trials to identify factors associated with endoscopic lesions and healing. We
      compared the effectiveness of omeprazole 20 mg and 40 mg daily, misoprostol 200
      micro g four times daily, and ranitidine 150 mg twice daily in healing ulcers and
      erosions at different sites and in patients who were Helicobacter pylori positive
      and negative. RESULTS: Older age, past ulcer history, rheumatoid arthritis, and H
      pylori infection were significantly associated with ulcers. Duodenal ulcer was
      significantly more likely than gastric ulcer with a past ulcer history (odds
      ratio 1.59, 1.16-2.17), H pylori infection (1.4, 1.04-1.92), and male sex (2.35, 
      1.75-3.16) while female sex, older age (> or = 60 years: 1.39, 1.03-1.88), and
      higher NSAID dose (>1 defined daily dose: 1.57, 1.16-2.14) were associated with
      gastric ulceration. Sex differences were seen in both H pylori positive and
      negative patients. Gastric and duodenal ulcer healing was significantly faster
      with omeprazole 20 mg than with misoprostol 200 micro g four times daily or
      ranitidine 150 mg twice daily although misoprostol was more effective at healing 
      erosions. Gastric ulcer healing was slower with large ulcers (0.37, 0.25-0.54 for
      >10 mm v 5-10 mm) or a past ulcer history (0.51, 0.34-0.76), and faster with H
      pylori infection (1.55, 1.06-2.29), especially with acid suppression (72% v 37%
      at four weeks with ranitidine). CONCLUSIONS: Among NSAID users, H pylori and male
      sex independently increase the likelihood of duodenal ulceration. H pylori
      infection does not affect duodenal ulcer healing and enhances gastric ulcer
      healing by ranitidine and possibly other acid suppressing treatments.

TI  - Relative contribution of mucosal injury and Helicobacter pylori in the
      development of gastroduodenal lesions in patients taking non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs.
PG  - 336-43
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A past history of peptic ulceration increases the risk of an
      ulcer developing during non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use. Whether
      this is due to Helicobacter pylori infection or to reactivation of the original
      lesion is unclear. METHODS: We used multivariate regression analyses of three
      large similar trials to identify factors that placed patients at high risk of
      ulcer development or relapse. We compared the efficacy of omeprazole 20 mg daily,
      misoprostol 200 micro g twice daily, and ranitidine 150 mg twice daily in
      preventing ulcers and erosions at different sites and in patients who were H
      pylori positive and negative. RESULTS: Patients with endoscopic lesions (which
      healed) initially were significantly more likely than those without to develop
      further erosions or ulcers during treatment (rate ratio 2.12, 1.07-4.17). Risk
      mounted further with ulcers versus erosions, particularly those that had been
      slow to heal. There was a highly significant tendency for the relapse lesion to
      replicate the site and type of the original lesion (mean odds ratios ranging from
      3 to 14). Treatment failure was significantly less likely with omeprazole than
      with placebo, misoprostol, or ranitidine. This advantage was especially evident
      in H pylori positive patients receiving acid suppression (5.7% v 16.6% for
      gastric ulcer with omeprazole). CONCLUSIONS: Relapse of lesions in patients
      taking NSAIDs was highly site and type specific and not adversely affected by H
      pylori status. This strongly implies that local mucosal factors predispose to
      ulcer development in patients taking NSAIDs. Identification of the responsible
      mucosal changes would aid understanding and could promote better treatment.

TI  - Primary prevention of diclofenac associated ulcers and dyspepsia by omeprazole or
      triple therapy in Helicobacter pylori positive patients: a randomised, double
      blind, placebo controlled, clinical trial.
PG  - 329-35
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is much controversy as to whether or not treatment of
      Helicobacter pylori reduces the occurrence of peptic ulcers during therapy with a
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). AIM: To assess the efficacy of
      triple therapy or omeprazole on the occurrence of diclofenac associated ulcers in
      H pylori positive patients. METHODS: This was a randomised, double blind, placebo
      controlled, multicentre trial in H pylori positive patients requiring NSAID
      therapy who had no past or current peptic ulcer. They received diclofenac 50 mg
      twice daily for five weeks in combination with one of the four randomly assigned 
      treatments: anti-H pylori treatment for one week (omeprazole 20 mg+clarithromycin
      500 mg+amoxicillin 1 g, all twice daily) followed by placebo for four weeks
      (OAC-P); anti-H pylori treatment for one week followed by antisecretory treatment
      with omeprazole 20 mg once daily for four weeks (OAC-O); omeprazole 20 mg once
      daily for five weeks (O-O); or placebo for five weeks (P-P). Patients were
      endoscoped before and after treatment. RESULTS: Data from 660 patients were
      included in an intention to treat analysis. The occurrence of peptic ulcers in
      the four treatment groups during the study period was: 1.2% for OAC-P, 1.2% for
      OAC-O, 0% for O-O, and 5.8% for P-P (p<0.05 between placebo and all active
      treatment groups). Patients who received active treatment developed therapy
      requiring dyspeptic symptoms less frequently than those who received placebo
      (p<0.05 between placebo and all active treatment groups). CONCLUSIONS: In H
      pylori infected patients, all three active therapies reduced the occurrence of
      NSAID associated peptic ulcer and dyspeptic symptoms requiring therapy.

TI  - Jejunal feeding tubes via gastrostomy in children.
PG  - 539-42
AB  - BACKGROUND: The implantation of a jejunal feeding tube, via percutaneous
      endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), is a possible method for the treatment of
      inadequate oral feeding in patients who are affected by gastroesophageal reflux. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study involves a retrospective analysis of all the
      patients up to 18 years of age, who were treated by means of jejunal feeding
      tubes at the Universitatsklinikum Benjamin Franklin, Berlin, between 15 September
      1995 and 1 August 2000. RESULTS: In all, 76 patients received a PEG, and 12 of
      them were also given jejunal feeding tubes. One of these patients has experienced
      no complications. In the other 11 children, 52 changes of jejunal tube have been 
      required. The most important reason for these changes was displacement of the
      tube into the gastrointestinal tract, resulting from technical problems with the 
      connecting section. CONCLUSIONS: Jejunal feeding tubes in patients with
      gastrostomy are an alternative to fundoplication and drugs. However, a high rate 
      of changes is to be expected.

TI  - Assessment of the afferent vagal nerve in patients with gastroesophageal reflux.
PG  - 1042-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to assess the integrity of the vagal 
      nerve afferent pathways in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). 
      METHODS: Seven GERD patients (4 males and 3 females, mean age 39 +/- 8 years)
      were studied. Twelve healthy volunteers (11 males and 1 female, mean age 32 +/- 8
      years) were used as the control group. Cortical evoked potentials were measured. 
      Electrical stimulation of the esophageal mucosa was performed through a
      custom-built device. Latencies and N2/P2 amplitude were measured. RESULTS:
      Reproducible cortical evoked potentials were obtained from all subjects. The
      stimulation threshold for GERD patients to electrical esophageal stimulation was 
      5.1 +/- 1.5 mA compared to 7.8 +/- 2.0 mA in healthy volunteers (p <0.05). There 
      was no difference in peak latencies or N2/P2 amplitude between GERD patients and 
      controls. CONCLUSIONS: GERD patients have a normal vagal nerve function, but they
      exhibit a decreased threshold for esophageal perception. The mechanism
      responsible for increased esophageal sensitivity observed in GERD patients is
      still undetermined and warrants further study.

TI  - Preoperative symptom evaluation and esophageal acid infusion predict response to 
      laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication in gastroesophageal reflux patients who
      present with cough.
PG  - 1037-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most patients with cough and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
      improve on medical treatment with proton pump inhibitors (PPI). Nonresponders may
      be considered for antireflux surgery, but the selection of patients is difficult.
      METHODS: We have performed laparoscopic Nissen fundoplications (LNF) in 677
      patients. Of these patients, 81% have undergone 6-month follow-up assessment with
      24-h pH testing, esophageal manometry, symptom scores, and quality-of-life
      scores. RESULTS: LNF controlled heartburn in 93% and improved cough in 81%.
      Stepwise multiple regression showed that the preoperative cough score (r = 0.620,
      p <0.0001) and change in cough on and off PPI (r = 0.296, p = 0.0002) predicted
      improvement after surgery. A positive result on a randomized acid infusion test
      was associated with a greater improvement in cough after surgery (p = 0.0243).
      CONCLUSION: An acid infusion test and assessment of cough on and off PPI may be
      useful preoperative tools for the selection of patients with cough for LNF.

TI  - Impact of Helicobacter pylori and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on gastric
      ulcerogenesis in experimental animals and in humans.
PG  - 1-15
AB  - Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) 
      are the most common pathogens in the gastroduodenal mucosa in animals and humans,
      but their relationship in ulcerogenesis has been little studied. According to
      some authors, H. pylori infection in humans does not act synergistically with
      NSAID on ulcer healing, therefore, there is no need to eradicate the germ. This
      notion is supported by the finding that the eradication of H. pylori does not
      affect NSAID-induced gastropathy treated with omeprazole and that H. pylori
      infection induces a strong cyclooxygenase-2 expression resulting in excessive
      biosynthesis of gastroprotective prostaglandins, which should in turn counteract 
      NSAID-induced gastropathy and heal the existing ulcer. Other investigators claim 
      that H. pylori infection acts synergistically with NSAID on ulcer development,
      therefore, H. pylori should be eradicated, particularly at the start of long-term
      NSAID therapy. Maastricht 2-2000 consensus also recommends eradication prior to
      NSAID treatment, but this eradication does not appear to accelerate ulcer healing
      or to prevent the recurrent ulcers in NSAID users. Our studies in almost 6,000
      dyspeptic patients undergoing upper endoscopy and [(13)C]-urea breath test (UBT) 
      revealed that about 70% of these patients are H. pylori (+) and about 30.6% of
      these develop gastroduodenal ulcers. Of these ulcers, over 70% were H. pylori (+)
      positive, 12% NSAID (+), 8% were both H. pylori (+) and NSAID (+), while 22%
      ulcers were H. pylori (-) and NSAID (-) or "idiopathic" ulcers. Basically, our
      results support Hawkey's concept and this also agrees with our findings in the
      rat model showing that: (1) there is no synergistic interaction between H. pylori
      infection and NSAID on gastric ulcer development, (2) H. pylori and NSAID are
      independent risk factors for peptic ulceration, and (3) NSAID therapy in H.
      pylori positive patients attenuates the ulcer development possibly due to direct 
      inhibitory action of these drugs on H. pylori.

TI  - Proton pump inhibitors: an update.
PG  - 273-80
AB  - Since their introduction in the late 1980s, proton pump inhibitors have
      demonstrated gastric acid suppression superior to that of histamine H2-receptor
      blockers. Proton pump inhibitors have enabled improved treatment of various
      acid-peptic disorders, including gastroesophageal reflux disease, peptic ulcer
      disease, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug-induced gastropathy. Proton pump 
      inhibitors have minimal side effects and few significant drug interactions, and
      they are generally considered safe for long-term treatment. The proton pump
      inhibitors omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, and the recently approved
      esomeprazole appear to have similar efficacy.

TI  - New strategies for the prevention and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection.
PG  - 1127-38
AB  - Helicobacter pylori infects the stomach of > 50% of the human population
      worldwide, with higher prevalence in the developing countries. A strict
      correlation between H. pylori infection and gastroduodenal diseases has been
      demonstrated, including gastritis, peptic ulcer and gastric cancer. Current
      therapies against H. pylori consist of an antisecretory plus antibiotics. These
      therapies are effective in 80 - 90% of the cases; presently, no alternative
      therapies have been shown to give comparable or better results. There are two
      main reasons for therapy failure: poor compliance, which results in cure
      discontinuation, and antibiotic resistance. To overcome the drawbacks inherent to
      any antibiotic therapy, a prophylactic vaccine seems to be the most reasonable
      approach. Vaccines have been developed based on data obtained in animal models, a
      number of which are currently in Phase I clinical trials, in some cases giving
      encouraging data for safety and immunogenicity. In the absence of any
      immunological correlate of protection against H. pylori, it will be possible to
      evaluate the efficacy of these vaccines only in large Phase III clinical trials.

TI  - Validity and reliability of the reflux symptom index (RSI).
PG  - 274-7
AB  - Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) is present in up to 50% of patients with voice
      disorders. Currently, there is no validated instrument that documents symptom
      severity in LPR. We developed the reflux symptom index (RSI), a self-administered
      nine-item outcomes instrument for LPR. The purpose of this investigation was to
      evaluate the psychometric properties of the RSI. For validity assessment, 25
      patients with LPR were evaluated prospectively before and six months after b.i.d.
      treatment with proton pump inhibitors (PPI). Each patient completed the RSI as
      well as the 30-item voice handicap index (VHI). For reliability assessment, the
      study patients were given the RSI on two separate occasions before the initiation
      of treatment. Normative RSI data were derived from 25 age-matched and
      gender-matched controls taken from an existing database of asymptomatic
      individuals without any evidence of LPR. The mean RSI (+/- standard deviation) of
      patients with LPR improved from 21.2 (+/- 10.7) to 12.8 (+/- 10.0), and the mean 
      VHI improved from 52.2 (+/- 24.7) to 41.5 (+/- 25.0) after 6 months of therapy (p
      = 0.001 and 0.065, respectively). Of the three VHI subscales (emotional,
      physical, functional), only the functional subscale improved significantly (p =
      0.037). Patients who experienced a five point or better improvement in RSI were
      11 times more likely to experience a five-point improvement in VHI (95%
      confidence interval = 1.7, 76.8). For reliability assessment, the first and
      second pretreatment RSIs were 19.9 (+/- 11.1) and 20.9 (+/- 9.6), respectively
      (correlation coefficient = 0.81, p < 0.001). The single-item correlation
      coefficients ranged from 0.41 to 0.91 (p < 0.05 for all items). The mean
      pretreatment RSI in patients with LPR was significantly higher than controls
      (21.2 versus 11.6; p < 0.001). The mean RSI of patients with LPR after 6 months
      of PPI therapy approached that of asymptomatic controls (p > 0.05). The RSI is
      easily administered, highly reproducible, and exhibits excellent construct and
      criterion-based validity.

TI  - Barrett's esophagus in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease. Medical
      therapy or antireflux surgery?
PG  - 397-402
AB  - Barrett's esophagus is the most serious form of gastroesophageal reflux disease. 
      It may develop due to uncontrolled chronic duodenogastroesophageal reflux and
      represents a premalignant abnormality. The question of the development of
      Barrett's esophagus and the progression to adenocarcinoma of the esophagus is
      addressed by comparison of the data available in the literature. A retrospective 
      review of the literature on the outcome of GERD patients after surgical and
      medical therapy, is made. Surgical therapy is able to eliminate reflux of gastric
      and duodenal contents and therefore seems to be superior over medical therapy in 
      the prevention of Barrett's esophagus and its progression to invasive cancer.
      Surgery should be considered in all Barrett's patients especially in young
      patients, patients with large hiatal hernia, increasing drug doses or
      noncompliance to medical therapy.

      and serum gastrin in healthy subjects.
PG  - 1301-7
AB  - AIM: To compare the antisecretory effects of rabeprazole and esomeprazole in an
      open, randomized, two-way crossover, clinical pharmacology study. METHODS:
      Twenty-four healthy subjects (14 men, 10 women; mean age 26.8 years) received
      rabeprazole 20 mg or esomeprazole 20 mg daily on days 1-5, with a 14-day
      'wash-out'. Intragastric pH was recorded continuously, and serum gastrin
      measured, on days 0, 1 and 5. RESULTS: On day 0, mean intragastric pH AUC was
      significantly higher before the esomeprazole than before the rabeprazole
      treatment in four of the five time intervals analysed. On days 1 and 5, mean
      intragastric pH AUC was higher after rabeprazole than esomeprazole during 5-11,
      14-24 and 0-24 h after dosing. Mean pH AUC in the first 5 h after dosing on day 5
      was higher after esomeprazole than rabeprazole (P=0.012). On day 1, mean per cent
      times pH > 3 and > 4 were significantly greater after rabeprazole than
      esomeprazole during 0-14, 14-24 and 0-24 h. On day 5, mean serum gastrin AUC0-4
      was higher (P = 0.017) after rabeprazole than esomeprazole (335 vs. 316 pg/mL.h).
      CONCLUSION: In this clinical pharmacology study, rabeprazole 20 mg daily was more
      effective than esomeprazole 20 mg daily in increasing intragastric pH and
      maintaining pH > 3 and > 4. On day 5, mean pH AUC was higher after esomeprazole
      than rabeprazole.

TI  - Furazolidone-based triple 'rescue therapy' vs. quadruple 'rescue therapy' for the
      eradication of Helicobacter pylori resistant to metronidazole.
PG  - 1277-82
AB  - BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment of patients with Helicobacter pylori resistant 
      to metronidazole has not been established. AIM: To compare the efficacy of
      quadruple and furazolidone-based triple therapy in the eradication of H. pylori
      resistant to metronidazole. METHODS: Duodenal ulcer patients (n = 70) in whom
      initial eradication therapy failed and who harboured H. pylori strains resistant 
      to metronidazole were randomized to receive one of the following 7-day regimens: 
      colloidal bismuth subcitrate, 240 mg, tetracycline, 750 mg, and furazolidone, 200
      mg, each given twice daily (BTF), or omeprazole, 20 mg b.d., colloidal bismuth
      subcitrate, 240 mg b.d., tetracycline, 500 mg q.d.s., and metronidazole, 500 mg
      b.d. (OBTM). H.pylori status was assessed by culture, histology and rapid urease 
      test before treatment and 4-6 weeks after therapy. Susceptibility to
      metronidazole was assessed by the agar dilution method. RESULTS: H. pylori
      eradication rates with intention-to-treat/per protocol analyses were: BTF,
      85.7%/90.9%; OBTM, 74.2%/89.6%. Duodenal ulcers were healed in nine of 10 (90%)
      patients in the BTF group and in all patients (12/12) (100%) in the OBTM group (P
      = N.S.). A significantly lower rate of adverse events was observed in the BTF
      group than in the OBTM group (31.4% vs. 60%, P = 0.03), but there was no
      difference in terms of discontinuation of treatment (2/35 vs. 6/35, P = N.S.).
      CONCLUSIONS: The 1-week BTF regimen was as effective as the OBTM regimen, and
      produced less adverse events. Thus, it may be used in patients in whom resistance
      of H. pylori to metronidazole is suspected.

TI  - One-week triple vs. quadruple therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection - a
      randomized trial.
PG  - 1261-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Seven-day triple therapy including omeprazole, clarithromycin and
      amoxicillin has become the treatment of choice for Helicobacter pylori infection.
      However, 7 days of classical quadruple therapy combining omeprazole,
      tetracycline, metronidazole and bismuth may be an alternative to triple therapy. 
      AIM: To compare triple vs. quadruple therapy for H.pylori eradication. METHODS:
      Three hundred and thirty-nine patients with peptic ulcer and H. pylori infection 
      were included in the study. Patients were randomized to receive omeprazole, 20
      mg, amoxicillin, 1 g, and clarithromycin, 500 mg, all b.d., or omeprazole, 20 mg 
      b.d., tetracycline chloride, 500 mg, metronidazole, 500 mg, and bismuth
      subcitrate, 120 mg, all t.d.s. Cure was defined as a negative urea breath test at
      least 2 months after treatment. RESULTS: Per protocol and intention-to-treat cure
      rates were 86%[95% confidence interval (CI), 80-91%] and 77% (95% CI, 70-83%) for
      triple therapy, and 89% (95% CI, 82-93%) and 83% (95% CI, 76-88%) for quadruple
      therapy. No significant differences between the groups were found in the cure
      rates, compliance or side-effects. CONCLUSION: One-week triple and quadruple
      therapy show similar results when used as first-line eradication treatment.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of ranitidine bismuth citrate plus amoxycillin and
      clarithromycin as first- or second-line therapy to cure Helicobacter pylori
      infection.
PG  - 1006-9
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Ranitidine bismuth citrate has recently been introduced for the 
      treatment of H. pylori infection and obtains good eradication rates; however,
      eradication failures still appear in a considerable proportion of cases. The aim 
      of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of ranitidine bismuth 
      citrate plus amoxycillin and clarithromycin as first- or second-line therapy to
      cure H. pylori infection. METHODOLOGY: We studied 423 consecutive H.
      pylori-positive patients. In 210 consecutive patients H. pylori infection was
      diagnosed for the first time (group A), while 213 consecutive patients were
      enrolled after failure of a first attempt to eradicate H. pylori (group B). All
      patients received ranitidine bismuth citrate 400 mg b.d. plus clarithromycin 500 
      mg b.d. and amoxycillin 1 g b.d. for seven days. H. pylori-status was evaluated
      by means of histology and rapid urease test at entry and by 13C-urea breath test 
      in all patients one month after treatment. RESULTS: 410/423 patients completed
      the study (202/210 in group A and 208/213 in group B). Two patients of group A
      and 1 patient of group B were withdrawn from the study due to poor compliance, 6 
      group A patients and 4 group B patients were lost to follow-up. In group A, after
      the end of treatment, 181/202 patients were H. pylori-negative (per-protocol
      analysis: 89.60% [C.I. 95%: 82-95%]; on intention-to-treat analysis: 86.19% [C.I.
      95%; 76-92%]), side-effects occurred in 29 patients (13.80%); they were severe in
      2 patients and the patients were withdrawn from the study. In group B, after the 
      end of treatment, 200/208 patients were H. pylori-negative (per-protocol
      analysis: 95.15% [C.I. 95%; 92-100%], on intention-to-treat analysis: 93.89%
      [C.I. 95%; 89-98%), side-effects occurred in 11 patients (5.13%); they were
      slight or mild and did not require discontinuation of the treatment. The results 
      of group B were statistically better than group A, both in eradication rate (P < 
      0.01) as well as both side-effects provoked (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Ranitidine
      bismuth citrate-clarithromycin-amoxycillin is more effective when used as
      second-line therapy rather than when used as first-line therapy; second,
      ranitidine bismuth citrate-clarithromycin-amoxycillin shows lower and slighter
      side-effects when used as second-line therapy rather than when used as first-line
      therapy; finally, the excellent tolerability of ranitidine bismuth citrate +
      clarithromycin + amoxycillin influences positively the patients' compliance, both
      as first- and second-line therapy.

TI  - On-demand and intermittent therapy for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease:
      economic considerations.
PG  - 565-76
AB  - Since gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is a prevalent condition
      characterised by frequent relapses, long-term costs of management for this
      disease are high. Thus, strategies to decrease resource expenditures without
      impairing patient quality of life are desirable. On-demand therapy (one-dose when
      symptoms occur) and intermittent therapy (short course of medication when
      symptoms occur) are attractive since pharmaceutical expenditures may be
      decreased, and many patients self-employ this strategy. The purpose of this paper
      was to examine the economic implications of on-demand or intermittent therapy for
      GORD. A review of selected studies evaluating medication suitable for on-demand
      or intermittent administration was performed. A complete search for published
      studies on the cost effectiveness of on-demand or intermittent therapy for GORD
      was conducted, and the results discussed in detail. Antacids, alginates,
      topically active agents, histamine(2)-receptor antagonists, and proton pump
      inhibitors have all demonstrable efficacy compared with placebo when administered
      on-demand. Proton pump inhibitors constitute the most effective pharmacological
      means to treat GORD. Although step-up strategies initially using less potent
      medication may decrease resource use, cost-effectiveness analysis illustrates
      that on-demand or intermittent therapy with proton pump inhibitors may be
      reasonable options. Further work that defines quality of life and patient
      preferences associated with GORD may allow for proper allocation of resources for
      the management of this condition.

TI  - [Helicobacter pylori eradication in patients with peptic ulcer after two
      treatment failures: a prospective culture-guided study].
PG  - 438-42
AB  - AIM: To determine the effectiveness of a third, culture-guided, treatment of H.
      pylori infection after two unsuccessful attempts. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-two
      consecutive patients with a diagnosis of peptic ulcer were included in an open
      prospective and multicenter study. After two unsuccessful attempts at eradication
      (demonstrated by positive urea breath test), all patients underwent endoscopy and
      H. pylori infection was confirmed by urease test, histology and culture
      (Pylori-Agar, Bio Merieux, France). Antibiotic susceptibility to metronidazole,
      amoxicillin, tetracycline and clarithromycin was defined by E-test. Thirty-nine
      patients received a two-week quadruple culture-guided therapy defined by the
      protocol, which considered sensitivity data and previous allergies to antibiotics
      (one culture was contaminated, one patient refused treatment and one was allergic
      to tetracycline and amoxicillin and was resistant to metronidazole and
      clarithromycin). Compliance was monitored by pill counting and eradication was
      defined as a negative urea breath test six weeks after the end of treatment.
      RESULTS: Sensitivity data were obtained in 41 patients. Intention-to-treat
      analysis revealed that overall eradication was achieved in 60% (24/40). Eighteen 
      strains (43.9%) were resistant to metronidazole, 21 (51.2%) were resistant to
      clarithromycin and 8 (19.5%) were resistant to both drugs. None of the strains
      were resistant to amoxicillin or tetracycline. We used mainly two kinds of
      quadruple therapy in the 39 patients. Despite good compliance with treatment
      based on omeprazole (20 mg/12 h), bismuth subcitrate (120 mg/6 h), tetracycline
      (500 mg/4 h) and clarithromycin (500 mg/ 12 h) (OBTC) eradication was achieved in
      only 9 of 19 patients (47.4%; CI: 24.4-71.1) (one patient failed to attend the
      urea breath test). Nineteen clarithromycin-resistant patients received
      amoxicillin (1,000 mg/12 h) instead of clarithromycin (OBTA) and this treatment
      was effective in 14 (73.7%; CI: 48.8-90.9). Eradication was achieved in one
      patient who was allergic to amoxicillin and resistant to clarithromycin and
      metronidazole and who received ciprofloxacin (500 mg/8 h) instead of
      clarithromycin (OBTCipro). No clinical factors associated with eradication
      failure were found. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the use of two-week, high-dose,
      quadruple and culture-guided combinations of drugs, a third treatment was
      frequently unsuccessful. The lowest eradication rate was obtained in patients
      with H. pylori strains sensitive to all antibiotics; therefore, we believe that
      other factors could influence eradication rates. New prospective and randomized
      studies are needed in this subgroup of patients to find effective treatments.

TI  - Development and validation of a scoring system predicting failure of endoscopic
      epinephrine injection therapy in Taiwanese patients with bleeding peptic ulcers.
PG  - 144-50
AB  - BACKGROUND: Endoscopic epinephrine injection therapy (EIT) is always the first
      choice of treatment for bleeding peptic ulcers, although it fails in 15% to 30%
      of patients. The aim of this study was to develop a new scoring system to predict
      the failure in EIT, and to validate this scoring model prospectively. METHODS:
      This study enrolled 125 patients who presented with the stigmata of hemorrhage of
      peptic ulcers and underwent EIT. Patients with coagulopathy were excluded from
      the study. Univariate analysis of the clinical and endoscopic parameters to
      predict failure in EIT was performed first. A multiple logistic regression was
      used to develop a scoring system. This scoring equation was further applied to 50
      prospective patients with bleeding peptic ulcers to validate its predictive
      value. RESULTS: EIT failed to arrest bleeding in 32 (25.6%) patients. Shock,
      blood transfusion of at least 500 ml, active bleeding, and ulcer size were
      effective in predicting failure in EIT as calculated by univariate analysis,
      while multivariate analysis showed shock, active bleeding and ulcer size to be
      the independent predictors. The scoring equation, defined as -3.14 + 1.29 (shock)
      + 0.99 (active bleeding) + 0.13 (ulcer size in mm), had a sensitivity of 81.8%
      and a specificity of 76.9% in predicting failure of EIT in the prospective cohort
      of 50 bleeding patients. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of shock, active bleeding
      (spurting or oozing hemorrhage) and ulcer size are risk factors of failure of EIT
      in Taiwanese patients with bleeding peptic ulcers. The scoring system based on
      these three parameters can predict failure in EIT, while alternative treatment
      should be considered in case patients fail EIT.

TI  - Comparison of oral omeprazole and endoscopic ethanol injection therapy for
      prevention of recurrent bleeding from peptic ulcers with nonbleeding visible
      vessels or fresh adherent clots.
PG  - 1736-40
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Omeprazole is a potent inhibitor of gastric acid secretion. Recently 
      it was reported that p.o. omeprazole therapy reduced the rebleeding rate in
      patients with nonbleeding visible vessels or adherent clots. The aim of this
      study was to ascertain whether p.o. administration of omeprazole can be an
      effective alternative to endoscopic injection therapy in peptic ulcers with
      stigmata of recent hemorrhage. METHODS: A total of 101 patients who had peptic
      ulcer bleeding based on endoscopic findings of nonbleeding visible vessels or
      fresh adherent clots were randomly assigned to receive omeprazole (40 mg p.o.
      every 12 h) or endoscopic ethanol injection therapy. RESULTS: Rebleeding rates
      were 22.9% (11 of 48) in the omeprazole group and 20.8% (11 of 53) in the
      endoscopic injection therapy group. The rebleeding rates of clinical significance
      were 14.6% and 13.2%, respectively. There was no significance difference in the
      rebleeding rate, requirement for surgery, total units of blood transfused, or
      mortality between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Oral omeprazole administration is 
      comparable to endoscopic ethanol injection therapy for prevention of rebleeding
      in patients with nonbleeding visible vessels or adherent clots.

TI  - Genotyping of Helicobacter pylori in paraffin-embedded gastric biopsy specimens: 
      relation to histological parameters and effects on therapy.
PG  - 1687-95
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Colonization with Helicobacterpylori can lead to GI disease.
      Bacterial genotypes and host factors, such as acid production, can influence the 
      progress of disease. We investigated H. pylori genotypes and histological
      parameters in the same paraffin-embedded gastric biopsy specimens. METHODS:
      Paraffin-embedded antrum and corpus biopsy samples from 75 gastroesophageal
      reflux disease patients were histologically examined and tested for H. pylori
      vacA (s and m regions), cagA, and iceA genotypes. Patients were investigated at
      baseline (58 H. pylori positive and 17 H. pylori negative) and after treatment
      with omeprazole with or without additional antibiotic therapy. RESULTS:
      Genotyping at baseline was complete in 52 (90%) of the 58 H. pylori positive
      patients. Multiple genotypes were detected in eight (14%) of these. Genotypes
      were highly consistent between antrum and corpus biopsy specimens at baseline and
      in follow-up samples. Genotypes from paraffin sections matched those from
      corresponding cultured strains in 10 selected cases. In the antrum, the degree of
      inflammation was associated with vacA s1 and cagA+ genotypes, and the degree of
      neutrophil activity was associated with the cagA+ genotype. In the corpus, the
      degree of inflammation was significantly associated with vacA s1, cagA+, and
      iceA1 genotypes and the degree of atrophy was associated with vacA s1, m1, and
      cagA+ genotypes, whereas the degree of neutrophil activity was associated with
      vacA s1 and cagA+ genotypes. vacA s2 and cagA-strains appeared more resistant to 
      antibiotic therapy, irrespective of resistance to clarithromycin. CONCLUSIONS:
      Our findings confirm the relevance of the H. pylori genotypes for the severity of
      gastric disease and the efficacy of antibiotic therapy.

TI  - Esomeprazole: a clinical review.
PG  - 1333-9
AB  - The pharmacology, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and
      adverse effects of esomeprazole are reviewed. Esomeprazole, a proton-pump
      inhibitor (PPI), is the S-isomer of omeprazole. Esomeprazole has FDA-approved
      labeling for use in the treatment of symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease 
      (GERD), including healing and maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis and
      as part of a triple-drug regimen for Helicobocter pylori infection. Esomeprazole 
      is structurally similar to other PPIs but is the first PPI to include only the
      active isomer, which may lead to improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
      characteristics. Esomeprazole maintains intragastric pH at a higher level and
      above 4 for a longer period than other PPIs. Clinical studies have shown that
      esomeprazole is at least equivalent in safety and efficacy to other drugs in the 
      class. Esomeprazole has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of erosive
      esophagitis, the maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis, and the treatment
      of signs and symptoms of GERD. Effective dosages are 20 or 40 mg orally every day
      or as needed. Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily in combination with
      amoxicillin and clarithromycin is effective in eradicating H. pylori infection.
      The potential for interacting with other drugs is limited and is similar to that 
      of omeprazole. The most common adverse effects are headache, respiratory
      infection, and abdominal symptoms. Esomeprazole has pharmacokinetic properties
      that may make it more effective than omeprazole in some patients.

TI  - On-demand treatment in patients with oesophagitis and reflux symptoms: comparison
      of lansoprazole and omeprazole.
PG  - 642-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are few data on how patients on maintenance treatment of reflux
      oesophagitis take their medication. This study was designed to investigate the
      dosing patterns of patients on on-demand treatment and to compare lansoprazole
      with omeprazole in this regard. METHODS: Patients with reflux oesophagitis,
      initially treated until absence of symptoms, took capsules of either lansoprazole
      (30 mg) or omeprazole (20 mg) for 6 months; they were instructed to take the
      medication only when reflux symptoms occurred. In order to document dosing
      patterns, the medication was dispensed in bottles supplied with a Medication
      Event Monitoring System recording date and time the bottles were opened. There
      were regular follow-up visits with assessment of symptoms. RESULTS: Three-hundred
      patients were eligible for analysis according to 'all patients treated'. A dosing
      pattern was found of an increased intake mornings and evenings and constant
      intervals between intakes. Although there was no correlation between oesophagitis
      grade or initial symptoms and the amount of medication consumed, the patients had
      significantly fewer reflux symptoms the more medication they consumed. There was 
      no difference in the number of capsules consumed between the lansoprazole (0.73
      capsules/day) and omeprazole groups (0.71 capsules/day). Nor was there any
      difference between the groups in reflux symptoms during the course of the study. 
      CONCLUSION: Despite rigorous instructions to take medication on demand, the
      results suggest that it is patient habits more so than symptoms that determine
      the frequency and interval of medication intake. Symptoms are not therefore
      decisive for the amount of medication consumed.

TI  - The natural course of gastroesophageal reflux disease in children.
PG  - 638-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: The consequences of chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
      starting in childhood have not been widely studied. Our aim was to evaluate the
      usefulness of endoscopy in the primary diagnosis of GERD and to investigate the
      long-term course of this disease in children. METHODS: Between 1989 and 1999, 136
      children had been endoscoped because of persisting symptoms of GER. After
      exclusions (neurological impairment, infant GER), 96 subjects were included, and 
      files from 76 were available for the final evaluation. Twenty-four hour
      pH-monitoring had been performed primarily on 67 children and at follow-up on 28,
      and endoscopy to 69 subjects and at follow-up to 33, respectively. Medical
      therapy as well as symptoms prior to the therapy were registered. Clinical
      outcome was assessed at the end of the follow-up period. RESULTS: Presenting
      symptoms were recurrent abdominal pain, heartburn, regurgitation and vomiting.
      Twenty-two patients had respiratory symptoms in addition to the gastrointestinal 
      complaints. PH-recording was normal in 17/67 subjects, slightly pathological in
      33 and severe reflux was diagnosed in 13 patients. Histologically, minimal
      changes associated with GER were diagnosed in 22 and mild esophagitis in 7.
      Thirty-six patients had been treated with prokinetic drugs. H2-blockers had been 
      used in 24 children and proton-pump inhibitors in 4. After a mean follow-up
      period of 28 months, only 24% of patients had become symptom-free. Control
      endoscopy showed no progression of the esophageal inflammation in any of the
      subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Pathological reflux in children is associated with no or
      mild esophageal inflammation, which is unlikely to deteriorate. Therefore
      endoscopic control could be limited to cases with severe esophagitis.

TI  - Gastroesophageal reflux disease: new treatments.
PG  - 66-74
AB  - The primary therapeutic endpoint for patients with gastroesophageal reflux
      disease is complete relief of symptoms and improvement in quality of life. The
      withdrawal of cisapride has created a vacuum in the prokinetic market, with few
      promising drugs in the pipeline. Reflux inhibitors are being considered for
      clinical trials, but as of yet are unavailable. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)
      continue to be the backbone of therapy for acid suppression, providing excellent 
      relief of symptoms and healing of erosive esophagitis. Isomeric technology with
      esomeprazole as the prototype represents an advance in PPI pharmacology.
      Antireflux surgery is now more patient-friendly, with shorter hospitalization and
      less major morbidity compared to open fundoplication, but surgery is at best
      equal to medical therapy when optimal doses of antisecretory therapy are used.
      Two endoscopic procedures were recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration for treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease: radiofrequency
      energy delivery to the gastroesophageal junction, and transoral flexible
      endoscopic suturing. These techniques should be used selectively until we have
      more data and until results are compared to the safe and highly effective medical
      therapies.

TI  - Ethical perspectives on pharmacogenomic profiling in the drug development
      process.
PG  - 300-8
AB  - Pharmacogenomics, which is a field that encompasses the study of genetic
      polymorphisms that underlie individual differences in drug response, is rapidly
      advancing. The potential for the widespread use of pharmacogenomics in the drug
      development process merits an examination of its fundamental impact on
      clinical-trial design and practice. This article provides a critical analysis of 
      some of the issues that pertain to pharmacogenomics in the drug development
      process. In particular, four areas will be discussed: clinical-trial design;
      subject stratification; some new social risks; and economic concerns.
      Recommendations are offered for addressing the issues that are discussed and
      anticipating the regulatory needs for pharmacogenomics-based trials.

TI  - Are proton pump inhibitors the first choice for acute treatment of gastric
      ulcers? A meta analysis of randomized clinical trials.
PG  - 17
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gastric ulcers are a frequent problem in the United States. Proton
      pump inhibitors have been shown to increase healing rates and improve clinical
      symptoms. The objective of this study is to compare gastric ulcer healing rates
      for patients treated with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) (omeprazole, rabeprazole,
      pantoprazole, or lansoprazole), an histamine 2- receptor antagonist (ranitidine) 
      or placebo. METHODS: A literature search was conducted to identify randomized,
      controlled clinical trials that included a PPI in at least one treatment arm and 
      assessed the gastric ulcer healing rates endoscopically. The healing rates were
      estimated for each treatment at specific time points, and Rate Ratios (RR) and
      95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated for each trial. RESULTS: Sixteen
      trials met the inclusion criteria: four compared a PPI versus placebo, nine
      compared a PPI versus ranitidine (no trials of rabeprazole versus ranitidine met 
      the inclusion criteria), and three compared a newer PPI (lansoprazole,
      pantoprazole or rabeprazole) versus omeprazole. In relation to ranitidine, the
      pooled RR of PPIs (lansoprazole, omeprazole and pantoprazole) was 1.33 (95% CI
      1.24 to 1.42) at four weeks. In each trial, greater improvement in the studied
      clinical symptoms was found with the newer PPIs (rabeprazole, pantoprazole and
      lansoprazole) when compared to omeprazole. CONCLUSION: In this study treatment
      with PPIs resulted in higher healing rates than ranitidine or placebo. This
      evidence suggests that the first choice for gastric ulcer treatment for the
      greater relief of symptoms is one of the newer PPIs.

TI  - Role of nitric oxide in gastric motor and sensory functions in healthy subjects.
PG  - 212-8
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Impaired accommodation and hypersensitivity to distension of
      the proximal stomach are considered to be important factors in the pathogenesis
      of dyspeptic complaints. As fundus relaxing agents may be effective in the
      treatment of these symptoms, insight into the mediators involved in fundic
      accommodation and associated perceptual responses is important. Therefore, we
      studied the effect of nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibition by
      N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) on fundic tone, postprandial sensations, and 
      gastric perception in healthy volunteers. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Eighteen healthy 
      volunteers participated in a double blind, placebo controlled, randomised study. 
      They underwent a gastric barostat study to evaluate the effect of L-NMMA on meal 
      and distension induced sensations and on fundic relaxation in response to oral
      meal intake, intraduodenal lipid, and glucagon administration. RESULTS: Compared 
      with placebo, L-NMMA decreased fundic volume after oral meal intake (438 (55) v
      304 (67) ml; n=8; p<0.05) and during intraduodenal lipid infusion (384 (37) v 257
      (43) ml; n=10; p<0.05) but not after glucagon injection (570 (62) v 540 (52) ml; 
      n=4; p=0.4). In addition, basal fundic volume was significantly reduced by
      L-NMMA. Scores for nausea and satiation were decreased by L-NMMA after oral meal 
      intake but not during intraduodenal lipid infusion. Perception scores to gastric 
      distension were not altered by L-NMMA. CONCLUSIONS: NO is involved in maintaining
      basal fundic tone and in meal induced fundic relaxation in humans, but not in
      visceral perception.

TI  - Distribution and partial characterisation of IgG Fc binding protein in various
      mucin producing cells and body fluids.
PG  - 169-76
AB  - Background and aims: Mucus released from goblet cells is important in intestinal 
      mucosal defence, and mucin glycoproteins are thought to be major components of
      mucus. Recently, we identified and cloned another component of human colonic
      mucus, IgG Fc binding protein (Fc gamma BP). Fc gamma BP is immunologically
      distinct from known Fc gamma receptors and its structure contains repeated
      cysteine rich unit sequences resembling those present in mucins. In this work, we
      assessed the tissue distribution of Fc gamma BP, its binding activity in various 
      body fluids, and its ability to inhibit complement mediated haemolysis. METHODS: 
      Immunohistochemical localisation of Fc gamma BP, using monoclonal antibodies
      against Fc gamma BP (K9 or K17) and labelled IgG, was conducted in various mucin 
      producing tissues: colon, small intestine, stomach, gall bladder, cystic duct,
      choledochus, bronchus, submandibular gland, conjunctiva, and cervix uteri. The
      binding activity of Fc gamma BP in mucus extracted from colon, gastric juice,
      bile, nasal discharges, saliva, sputum, and tears was also examined by
      immunodotblot and immunoprecipitation using these monoclonal antibodies.
      Inhibition of complement mediated haemolysis by Fc gamma BP was investigated
      using sheep red blood cells (SRBC) and anti-SRBC IgG. RESULTS: The
      immunohistochemical study revealed that mucin secreting cells in the colon, small
      intestine, gall bladder, cystic duct, choledochus, bronchus, submandibular gland,
      and cervix uteri contained Fc gamma BP, and immunodotblot and immunoprecipitation
      analysis using IgG and monoclonal antibodies demonstrated that the fluids
      secreted by these cells were capable of binding IgG. Mucin producing cells of the
      conjunctiva did not express Fc gamma BP molecules or bind to IgG. The surface
      mucus cells in the stomach were variably positive for Fc gamma BP. Perhaps
      because of proteolytic degradation, Fc gamma BP in gut lavage fluid did not have 
      IgG binding activity, although this activity was present in the mucus covering
      the colon. Fc gamma BP suppressed complement mediated haemolysis of SRBC.
      CONCLUSIONS: Fc gamma BP is widely expressed on mucosal surfaces and in external 
      secretions. It is functionally intact in several fluids. These findings lend
      support to the concept that Fc gamma BP is an important component of mucosal
      immunological defences.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori: consensus and controversy.
PG  - 298-304
AB  - Helicobacter pylori is uniquely adapted to colonize the human stomach. Infection 
      leads to a range of subclinical and clinical outcomes that depend on properties
      of the infecting strain, the host, and the environment. Eradication therapy is
      indicated for infected persons who develop peptic ulcer disease or gastric
      lymphoma or who are beginning long-term treatment with nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs. However, treatment may worsen gastroesophageal reflux
      disease and increase the risk of esophageal cancer. H. pylori infections can be
      diagnosed noninvasively and can be eradicated with approximately 85% success by a
      variety of multidrug, 7-14-day regimens. Unfortunately, antibiotic resistance is 
      affecting treatment effectiveness in the United States and abroad. A more
      complete understanding of the variation in H. pylori pathogenesis should lead to 
      clearer recommendations about treatment for infected persons who have neither
      peptic ulcer disease nor gastric lymphoma.

TI  - Indications for Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy and first-line therapy
      regimen in Japan: recommendation by the Japanese Society for Helicobacter
      Research.
PG  - 34-8
AB  - In November 2000, eradication therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection was
      approved under the present Japanese system of health insurance. Before the
      approval, the Japanese guideline of "Diagnosis and Treatment of H. pylori
      infection" was made by the guideline committee of the Japanese Society for
      Helicobacter Research. Indications for H. pylori eradication therapy were
      classified into three groups: (A) recommended: gastric and duodenal ulcers; (B)
      recommended and managed at a specialized institution: low-grade gastric
      mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma; (C) current studies of the
      significance of the therapy: following endoscopic mucosal resection of early
      gastric cancer and gastric surgery for gastric cancers, hyperplastic gastric
      polyp, atrophic gastritis, and nonulcer dyspepsia. The first-line therapy regimen
      recommended is 1 week of triple therapy with a proton pump inhibitor standard
      dose twice a day, amoxicillin 750 mg bid, and clarithromycin 200 or 400 mg bid.
      The reasons for preferring this regimen are to avoid extensive use of
      metronidazole, which is allowed for treatment of Trichomonas infection in Japan, 
      and the low rate of emergence of clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori with
      amoxicillin co-therapy. For second-line therapy patients should be referred to
      specialists, who can examine the susceptibility of H. pylori isolates against
      antibiotics and have much experience with this therapy.

TI  - Rabeprazole in nonerosive gastroesophageal reflux disease: a randomized
      placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 1332-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Clinical results to date suggest that antisecretory therapy may be
      less effective in providing symptom relief for patients with nonerosive
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) than for patients with erosive disease.
      This study was carried out to assess the efficacy and rapidity of once-daily
      rabeprazole (10 mg or 20 mg) in relieving symptoms in endoscopically negative
      patients with moderately severe GERD symptoms and to evaluate the safety of these
      doses over 4 wk. METHODS: This placebo-controlled, double blind study enrolled
      203 men and women with moderately severe symptoms of GERD. After a 2-wk,
      single-blind placebo run-in phase, patients were randomized to receive 10 mg or
      20 mg of rabeprazole or placebo once daily for 4 wk. RESULTS: Rabeprazole rapidly
      and effectively relieved heartburn, with significant improvements on day 1 of
      dosing. It also improved most other GERD-related symptoms, including
      regurgitation, belching, bloating, early satiety, and nausea. Both rabeprazole
      doses were significantly superior to the placebo with respect to time to the
      first 24-h heartburn-free interval (2.5 and 4.5 days for 10 mg and 20 mg of
      rabeprazole, respectively, vs 21.5 days for the placebo) and first daytime or
      nighttime heartburn-free interval (1.5-3 days for rabeprazole groups vs 12.5-15
      days for the placebo), as well as to percentage of time patients were
      heartburn-free and free of antacid use. Both rabeprazole doses were well
      tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these findings and prior studies, rabeprazole
      reliably relieves GI symptoms equally well in both nonerosive GERD and erosive
      GERD.

TI  - Esomeprazole: a review of its use in the management of acid-related disorders.
PG  - 1503-38
AB  - Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole), the first single optical isomer proton
      pump inhibitor, generally provides better acid control than current racemic
      proton pump inhibitors and has a favourable pharmacokinetic profile relative to
      omeprazole. In a large well designed 8-week trial in patients (n >5000) with
      erosive oesophagitis, esomeprazole recipients achieved significantly higher rates
      of endoscopically confirmed healed oesophagitis than those receiving
      lansoprazole. Respective healed oesophagitis rates with once-daily esomeprazole
      40mg or lansoprazole 30mg were 92.6 and 88.8%. Overall, esomeprazole was also
      better than omeprazole, although these differences were not always statistically 
      significance. Ninety-two to 94% of esomeprazole recipients (40mg once daily)
      achieved healed oesophagitis versus 84 to 90% of omeprazole recipients (20mg once
      daily). Esomeprazole was effective across all baseline grades of oesophagitis;
      notably, relative to lansoprazole, as baseline severity of disease increased, the
      difference in rates of healed oesophagitis also increased in favour of
      esomeprazole. Resolution of heartburn was also significantly better with
      esomeprazole 40mg than with these racemic proton pump inhibitors. Long-term (up
      to 12 months) therapy with esomeprazole effectively maintained healing in these
      patients. Once-daily esomeprazole 20 or 40mg for 4 weeks resolved symptoms in
      patients with symptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) without
      oesophagitis. Symptoms were effectively managed in the long-term with
      symptom-driven on-demand esomeprazole (20 or 40mg once daily). Eradicating
      Helicobacter pylori infection is considered pivotal to successfully managing
      duodenal ulcer disease. Seven days' treatment (twice-daily esomeprazole 20mg plus
      amoxicillin 1g and clarithromycin 500mg) eradicated H. pylori in >/=86% of
      patients (intention-to-treat), a rate that was similar to equivalent
      omeprazole-based regimens. Esomeprazole is generally well tolerated, both as
      monotherapy and in combination with antimicrobial agents, with a tolerability
      profile similar to that of other proton pump inhibitors. Few patients
      discontinued therapy because of treatment-emergent adverse events (<3% of
      patients), with very few (<1%) drug-related serious adverse events reported.
      CONCLUSIONS: Esomeprazole is an effective, well tolerated treatment for managing 
      GORD and for eradicating H. pylori infection in patients with duodenal ulcer
      disease. In 8-week double-blind trials, esomeprazole healed oesophagitis and
      resolved symptoms in patients with endoscopically confirmed erosive oesophagitis 
      and overall, provided better efficacy than omeprazole. Notably, in a large (n
      >5000 patients) double-blind trial, esomeprazole 40mg provided significantly
      better efficacy than lansoprazole in terms of healing rates and resolution of
      symptoms. Long-term therapy with esomeprazole maintained healed oesophagitis in
      these patients. Esomeprazole also proved beneficial in patients with symptomatic 
      GORD without oesophagitis. Thus, esomeprazole has emerged as an option for
      first-line therapy in the management of acid-related disorders.

TI  - Lansoprazole for the prevention of recurrences of ulcer complications from
      long-term low-dose aspirin use.
PG  - 2033-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of gastric acid suppression in preventing the recurrence of 
      ulcer complications after the eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection in
      patients taking long-term low-dose aspirin is uncertain. METHODS: We enrolled 123
      patients who had ulcer complications after using low-dose aspirin continuously
      for more than one month and who had H. pylori infection. After the ulcers had
      healed and the H. pylori infection was eradicated, the patients were randomly
      assigned to treatment with 30 mg of lansoprazole daily or placebo, in addition to
      100 mg of aspirin daily, for 12 months. The primary end point was the recurrence 
      of ulcer complications. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 12 months, 9 of the
      61 patients in the placebo group (14.8 percent), as compared with 1 of the 62
      patients in the lansoprazole group (1.6 percent), had a recurrence of ulcer
      complications (adjusted hazard ratio, 9.6; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.2 to
      76.1). Of these 10 patients, 4 had evidence of a recurrence of H. pylori
      infection and 2 had taken nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs before the onset of
      complications. Patients in the lansoprazole group were significantly less likely 
      to have a recurrence of ulcer complications than patients in the placebo group
      (P=0.008). There was no significant difference in mortality between the two
      groups. CONCLUSIONS: In patients who had ulcer complications related to the
      long-term use of low-dose aspirin, treatment with lansoprazole in addition to the
      eradication of H. pylori infection significantly reduced the rate of recurrence
      of ulcer complications.

TI  - Recurrent bleeding from peptic ulcer associated with adherent clot: a randomized 
      study comparing endoscopic treatment with medical therapy.
PG  - 1-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Endoscopic therapy reduces the recurrence of bleeding from actively
      bleeding peptic ulcers and those with visible vessels. However, the use of
      endoscopic therapy for ulcers with adherent clots remains controversial. The
      purpose of this study was to determine whether removal of clot from an ulcer and 
      endoscopic therapy reduces the frequency of recurrent bleeding. METHODS: Patients
      with acute upper GI bleeding from peptic ulcers with adherent clots and no active
      bleeding were enrolled in a multicenter study. At each center patients were
      stratified for age, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and ulcer
      location, and were randomized to endoscopic or medical management. Endoscopic
      therapy consisted of injection of the base of the adherent clot with a solution
      of epinephrine and mechanical removal of the clot. The base of the ulcer and any 
      stigmata of bleeding were then coagulated until cavitation and adequate
      coagulation were obtained. Patients in both groups received standard medical
      therapy for peptic ulcer. Patients were evaluated for recurrence of bleeding for 
      1 month. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients were enrolled. Rates of recurrent bleeding
      were 34.3% (12/35) in the medical treatment arm versus 4.8% (1/21) in the
      endoscopic treatment arm (p < 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with GI bleeding
      caused by gastric or duodenal ulcers with an adherent clot found on endoscopy,
      endoscopic therapy with injection of the base of the clot, clot removal, and heat
      probe coagulation significantly reduces the rate of recurrent bleeding compared
      with medical therapy alone.

TI  - A double-blind, randomized comparison of omeprazole Multiple Unit Pellet System
      (MUPS) 20 mg, lansoprazole 30 mg and pantoprazole 40 mg in symptomatic reflux
      oesophagitis followed by 3 months of omeprazole MUPS maintenance treatment: a
      Dutch multicentre trial.
PG  - 649-56
AB  - BACKGROUND: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have proved to be effective in treating
      reflux oesophagitis. Until now, no study had compared the PPIs omeprazole
      Multiple Unit Pellet System (MUPS), lansoprazole and pantoprazole in patients
      with reflux oesophagitis. AIM: To compare omeprazole MUPS 20 mg, lansoprazole 30 
      mg and pantoprazole 40 mg for treatment effect in symptomatic reflux
      oesophagitis. METHOD: Patients with grade I-IV symptomatic reflux oesophagitis
      were randomized to double-blind omeprazole 20 mg once morning, lansoprazole 30 mg
      o.m. or pantoprazole 40 mg o.m. Patient satisfaction and symptoms were evaluated 
      after 4 and 8 weeks. Patients not satisfied after 8 weeks were treated for
      another 4 weeks with omeprazole 40 mg MUPS (open). Successful treatment was
      followed by 3 months' maintenance treatment with omeprazole MUPS 20 mg (patients 
      satisfied after 4 or 8 weeks) or omeprazole MUPS 40 mg (patients satisfied after 
      12 weeks). RESULTS: On intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis (n = 461) at 4 and 8
      weeks, respectively, 84% and 87% (omeprazole MUPS), 78% and 81% (lansoprazole),
      and 84% and 89% (pantoprazole) were free of heartburn. Equivalence was found
      between omeprazole MUPS and pantoprazole (heartburn relief), but not with
      lansoprazole. Patient satisfaction after 4 and 8 weeks, respectively, was 79% and
      89% (omeprazole MUPS), 76% and 86% (lansoprazole), and 79% and 91%
      (pantoprazole). Patient satisfaction was similar in all treatment groups. During 
      maintenance, 87% in the omeprazole MUPS 20 mg group and 81% in the omeprazole
      MUPS 40 mg group were satisfied after 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: Omeprazole MUPS 20
      mg and pantoprazole 40 mg have equivalent efficacy in the treatment of reflux
      oesophagitis. Based on patient satisfaction, omeprazole MUPS 20 mg, lansoprazole 
      30 mg and pantoprazole 40 mg are equally effective.

TI  - [Diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux].
PG  - 779-90
AB  - Around 10-20% of the population suffer from the hallmark symptoms of heartburn,
      regurgitation, sour burping and retrosternal pain. Based on their characteristic 
      medical history alone, such patients can usually be presumed to have
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). In around 30-50% of them, the endoscopic 
      examination will reveal the typical erosions and ulcerations in the esophagus. In
      addition to the clinical symptoms, endoscopy plays a central role in diagnosing
      GERD. An endoscopy is always indicated whenever these warnings symptoms are
      present. In patients with persistent reflux problems, endoscopy is indicated to
      diagnose erosive reflux esophagitis. This procedure should include a routine
      biopsy taken distal to the Z-line to enable histological detection of the
      metaplasia associated with Barrett's esophagus. Although the majority of patients
      exhibit the classical symptoms and respond to acid suppression therapy, endoscopy
      may not find erosions (non-erosive reflux disease NERD). In these cases, further 
      diagnostic steps must be taken to verify the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux
      disease. There are patients, moreover, who exhibit unclear, uncharacteristic
      reflux symptoms, such as respiratory diseases with bronchial asthma, chronic
      bronchitis, chronic cough or ENT problems like posterior laryngitis and globus
      sensation (a lump in the throat). In these uncertain cases and in patients with
      NERD, 24-hour pH monitoring can verify and objectify and acid gastroesophageal
      reflux. An association can then be made between acid reflux and symptomatology.
      As an alternative, trial therapy with a proton pump inhibitor can help identify
      patients who have acid-related problems and symptoms. Other functional tests such
      as radiographic examination, manometry or scintigraphy are less well suited, if
      at all, for primary diagnostics of gastroesophageal reflux disease.

TI  - Effect of pantoprazole versus other proton pump inhibitors on 24-hour
      intragastric pH and basal acid output in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.
PG  - 355-9
AB  - AIM: In this open prospective study, the efficacy of pantoprazole in reducing
      gastric acid secretion in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome patients was compared to
      that obtained previously with other proton pump inhibitors. METHODS: Eleven male 
      patients previously treated with omeprazole (n=7, mean dosage: 63 mg/day; range: 
      20-100 mg/day) or lansoprazole (n=4, mean dosage: 75 mg/day; range: 30-120
      mg/day) were included. These patients underwent a 24-hour intragastric pH-metry, 
      measurement of basal acid output and of serum gastrin first while receiving their
      usual therapy and second after 7 to 10 days of pantoprazole treatment at a mean
      dosage of 116 mg/day (range: 40-200 mg/day). Basal acid output was evaluated
      after each intragastric pH-metry, one hour before the next intake of proton pump 
      inhibitor and a serum gastrin curve was determined according to 9 fixed time
      points. RESULTS: One patient dropped out before the second intragastric pH-metry 
      due to an adverse event (varicella) unrelated to pantoprazole and was
      reinvestigated thereafter. The median 24-h intragastric pH with pantoprazole was 
      not significantly different than that with the other proton pump inhibitors (5.3 
      versus 4.6, respectively; P=0.90). Neither the median basal acid output values
      nor the median serum gastrin levels were significantly different between
      pantoprazole and the other proton pump inhibitors. CONCLUSION: In these patients 
      with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, pantoprazole was well tolerated and equally 
      effective to the other proton pump inhibitors in terms of antisecretory potency.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of pantoprazole versus ranitidine in the treatment of
      reflux esophagitis and the influence of Helicobacter pylori infection on healing 
      rate.
PG  - 50-6
AB  - Patients with reflux esophagitis (grade II or III, Savary-Miller,
      intention-to-treat, n=256, age range 19-82 years) were randomly assigned to a
      double-blind, double-dummy treatment with either pantoprazole 40 mg once daily or
      ranitidine 150 mg twice daily. After 4 weeks, each patient was clinically and
      endoscopically assessed. Failure to heal required a further 4 weeks of treatment 
      and a new evaluation thereafter. After 4 weeks, healing of lesions was confirmed 
      in 63% (69 out of 109) of patients receiving pantoprazole and in 22% (25 out of
      113) receiving ranitidine (P < 0.001, per protocol population). After 8 weeks,
      the cumulative healing rates were 88% and 46%, respectively (P < 0.001). Complete
      freedom from esophagitis-related symptoms (acid eructation, heartburn, pain while
      swallowing) was greater in the pantoprazole than in ranitidine group after 2 and 
      4 weeks (74% vs. 47%; 87% vs. 52%, respectively, P < 0.001). After 4 weeks, the
      healing rate was 76% in Helicobacter pylori (Hp)-positive vs. 45% in Hp-negative 
      patients treated with pantoprazole (P < 0.01). The Hp status did not influence
      healing rates in patients treated with ranitidine. The most frequent adverse
      events in the pantoprazole group were diarrhea and somnolence (2-3% of patients),
      and in the ranitidine group, headache, diarrhea, dizziness, increase of liver
      enzymes and pruritus (2-4% of patients). In conclusion, pantoprazole was more
      effective than ranitidine in the healing rate and relief from reflux
      esophagitis-associated symptoms, and Hp infection was associated with higher
      healing rate during therapy with pantoprazole but not with ranitidine.

TI  - Ablation of Barrett's epithelium: the promise and the problems.
PG  - 30-8
AB  - The incidence of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus has increased dramatically over 
      recent years. Because Barrett's epithelium is recognized as a risk factor for
      adenocarcinoma there is an interest in reversing this metaplasia. A number of
      endoscopic methods of destruction of esophageal columnar epithelium have been
      described. The purpose of this article is to review the currently available
      methods of managing Barrett's epithelium with particular reference to the role of
      ablative therapy in reducing the risk of adenocarcinoma.

TI  - Mucosal ablation in Barrett's esophagus.
PG  - 22-9
AB  - Barrett's esophagus is a prevalent, premalignant condition affecting the
      gastroesophageal junction and distal esophagus. Ablation plus antireflux therapy 
      has recently been advocated to prevent the development of adenocarcinoma or to
      treat those unfit or unwilling to undergo esophagectomy. The present article,
      based on a search of Medline/ISI databases and cross-referencing of relevant
      articles, reviews the literature on this subject. A number of techniques have
      been used to remove the affected mucosa, including laser, electrocoagulation,
      argon plasma coagulation and photodynamic therapy but, as yet, none has been
      shown to be superior. Depending on the method used, ablation results in complete 
      removal of Barrett's esophagus in approximately one third of patients and a
      partial response in nearly two-thirds. The resultant squamous mucosa is
      apparently 'normal' but may regress. To promote and maintain regeneration,
      antireflux therapy must be sufficient to reduce repetitive injury to the
      esophageal mucosa. Whether ablation reduces the cancer risk or delays its
      occurrence is unknown, though recent data suggests benefit. Complications are
      infrequent and usually mild. Regular follow-up endoscopy and deep biopsies
      continue to be necessary. Careful data from much larger populations with
      long-term follow-up is required before ablation reaches the stage of broad
      clinical application.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori eradication for peptic ulceration: an observational study in 
      a Scottish primary care setting.
PG  - 28-33
AB  - Despite being established for the treatment of peptic ulcer (PU) disease, few
      studies have assessed the long-term effectiveness and economic benefits of
      Helicobacter pylori (Hp) eradication in primary care. Our aim was to investigate 
      the effect of community based Hp eradication for patients with chronic peptic
      ulcer disease requiring maintenance acid suppression. The endpoints used were the
      patients dyspeptic symptoms and the requirement for the prescription of
      maintenance acid suppression therapy. The study area covered seven general
      practices in the Glasgow area. Patients with previously diagnosed peptic ulcer
      disease receiving prescribed acid suppression therapy were invited to a dyspepsia
      clinic. Hp status was assessed by Helisal rapid blood test (HRBT). Positive
      patients received Hp eradication therapy and were reviewed six weeks later. At
      six months a review of practice records was carried out, and two years after
      eradication a postal questionnaire was sent to participating patients. A total of
      243 patients attended the initial clinic of which 81.9% were HRBT positive. 156
      of 196 patients offered Hp eradication re-attended at six weeks. The per protocol
      eradication rate was 91.7%. After six months patients who had received
      eradication therapy were less likely to require maintenance acid suppression
      therapy compared with those to whom eradication was not given. Two years after
      treatment 76.5% of patients felt their symptoms were improved, but 42.2% were
      still receiving maintenance therapy. The estimated cost of treatment per month
      per patient had fallen from 20.23 Pounds to 9.39 Pounds after eradication. In
      conclusion we felt that community based Hp eradication for patients with chronic 
      PU disease is effective, however it does not completely alleviate dyspepsia.
      Predictors of symptomatic response or of no longer requiring acid suppression
      therapy after two years were younger age of onset of PU disease and absence of
      pre-documented gastro-oesophageal reflux disease or hiatus hernia. Hp eradication
      improves patients symptoms, reduces the requirement for maintenance acid
      suppression and is cost-effective after two years follow-up in this targeted
      group.

TI  - Eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection with proton pump inhibitor-based
      triple therapy. A randomised study.
PG  - 145-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection plays an important role in 
      the pathogenesis of duodenal ulcer (DU) disease. Low DU recurrences and
      reinfection rates were universally described, when treatment was effective. It
      has been suggested that short-term triple therapy, comprising a proton pump
      inhibitor plus 2 antibiotics (clarithromycin, amoxycillin or a nitroimidazole),
      should be used as first choice in treating H. pylori infection. Nevertheless,
      conflicting results have been reported on using these treatment regimens in
      different countries. Our aim was to compare cure rates of H. pylori infection,
      with a 1-week triple therapy versus 10 and 15 day triple schedules, in patients
      with DU. METHODS: A total of 172 patients (91 males, mean age 56.2+/- 3.2 years) 
      were randomly treated with a triple therapy including a standard dose of proton
      pump inhibitor, amoxicillin at a dose of 1 g twice daily and clarithromycin 500
      mg twice a day. Sixty-six patients received a 1-week triple therapy (group I), 42
      subjects were treated with a 10-day triple therapy (group II) and 64 others with 
      a 14-day triple therapy (group III). H. pylori infection at entry and after
      eradication, at least 4 weeks after therapy had ended, were assessed by 13C urea 
      breath test and histology on biopsies from the antrum and the corpus. RESULTS: At
      the end of the course of treatment, the overall H. pylori eradication rate was
      68.2% (45/66) in group I, 76.2% (32/42) in group II and 71.9% (46/64) in group
      III, without any statistically significant difference between the 3 differing
      period regimens, although a trend for better results with the 10-day triple
      therapy was observed. Compliance was good and side effects infrequent and mild.
      CONCLUSIONS: None of the 3 periods of triple therapy achieved 80% eradication
      rate recommended by the Maastricht Consen-sus Conference. The 10-day triple
      therapy, although not significantly, provided a satisfactory treatment against H.
      pylori infection.

      in primary care].
PG  - 486-94
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate management of dyspepsia, gastroduodenal ulcer and
      Helicobacter pylori infection in the setting of family practice. DESIGN: An
      observational transversal study was performed. An anonymous questionnaire was
      send by mail between January and October 2000. SETTING: Primary care.
      PARTICIPANTS: Physicians of 17 Primary Care centers. RESULTS: Sixty-four per cent
      of the physicians returned the answered questionnaire (107/165). Primary care
      doctors reported they had indicated eradication therapy at least once during last
      year in 94.3%; 89.7% usually indicate H. pylori eradication for duodenal ulcer
      and 70.1% for gastric ulcer. The main method for the study of dyspepsia was
      endoscopy associated with antral histology or rapid urease test for determination
      of H. pylori status. Omeprazole, clarithromycin and amoxicillin twice daily for
      seven days was the preferred eradication therapy (77.6%). Forty-five percent of
      physicians systematically tested patients to confirm cure of the infection; 36.4%
      tested patients only if symptoms relapsed. Breath test (72.7%) was the preferred 
      method to confirm eradication. Physicians with postgraduate specialty in Family
      Care and Community Medicine (MFyC) demand less often gastroenterologist
      evaluation, indicate less frequently upper tract radiology, use more often C13
      urea breath test for diagnosis and indicate more often eradication treatment for 
      erosive duodenitis than unspecialised family doctors. CONCLUSIONS: Management of 
      dyspepsia and H. pylori infection in Primary Care in our area is reasonably
      adapted to current consensus recommendations. Many differences in management were
      observed between MFyC and non-specialised primary care physicians.

TI  - Duodenal ulcer healing with 1-week eradication triple therapy followed, or not,
      by anti-secretory treatment: a multicentre double-blind placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 1157-62
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the management of Helicobacter pylori induced duodenal ulcer, it
      is still controversial whether anti-secretory treatment needs to be continued
      following a 1-week course of eradication therapy. METHODS: 150 patients with H.
      pylori active duodenal ulcer (diameter > or = 5 mm) were included. After a 1-week
      eradication treatment combining omeprazole 20 mg b.d., amoxicillin 1000 mg b.d.
      and clarithromycin 500 mg b.d. (OAC), patients were randomized to omeprazole 20
      mg or placebo for 3 additional weeks. The primary variable was ulcer healing
      assessed at 4 weeks. Eradication was verified 4 weeks after cessation of study
      drugs by 13C-urea breath test. Intention-to-treat analysis (ITT) included 131
      patients with positive histopathology at inclusion. RESULTS: Healing rates were
      not statistically different, at 89% and 87%, respectively, in the OAC-omeprazole 
      and OAC-placebo groups (95% CI: -8.7; 13.7). Numerically, healing rates in
      patients with successful eradication was higher [94/104 (90%)] than in patients
      with failed eradication [21/27 (78%)]. However, the difference was not
      statistically significant (P < 0.1). CONCLUSIONS: One-week OAC eradication triple
      therapy achieves excellent healing rates in patients with uncomplicated duodenal 
      ulcer disease. Although the confidence interval of the difference in healing
      suggests little or no benefit of continued omeprazole treatment after 1 week,
      larger studies are needed to address this issue definitively.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori eradication does not worsen quality of life related to reflux
      symptoms: a prospective trial.
PG  - 1143-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Concern has been raised that Helicobacter pylori therapy may lead to 
      the development of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. This prospective study was 
      designed to assess reflux-related quality of life and the symptoms of
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in patients undergoing H. pylori therapy.
      METHODS: Patients with a primary complaint of dyspepsia (upper abdominal pain or 
      discomfort) and endoscopic biopsy positive for H. pylori received triple therapy 
      for 2 weeks. A validated reflux-related quality of life questionnaire sensitive
      to change was given at baseline, 1 month and 6 months after therapy; symptoms
      were also recorded. A urea breath test was performed 1 month after the end of
      therapy; patients and investigators were blind to the results. RESULTS: H. pylori
      was eradicated in 48 of 61 patients. The mean scores in cured patients for each
      of the five domains were comparable at baseline and 6 months after therapy:
      differences were - 0.23 to 0.13 (P > 0.20) on a scale of 1-7. The proportion of
      cured patients with a large decrease in quality of life (10-17% in the five
      domains) was similar to the proportion with a large increase (15-21%). Heartburn 
      was present at baseline in 22 cured patients; at 6 months, it persisted in 13 and
      resolved in nine, whilst nine patients developed new heartburn. CONCLUSIONS: A
      population of patients presenting with dyspepsia should have no overall increase 
      or decrease in quality of life due to symptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux
      disease in the 6 months after H. pylori therapy.

TI  - Meta-analysis: the efficacy of intravenous H2-receptor antagonists in bleeding
      peptic ulcer.
PG  - 1137-42
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although a previous meta-analysis found that intravenous H2-receptor 
      antagonists were only weakly beneficial in bleeding gastric ulcer and of no
      benefit in bleeding duodenal ulcer, patients with ulcer bleeding continue to
      receive such treatment. AIM: To re-evaluate the efficacy of intravenous
      H2-receptor antagonists in ulcer re-bleeding, surgery and mortality by updating
      the previous meta-analysis. METHODS: After two independent literature searches,
      randomized, placebo-controlled trials of intravenous H2-receptor antagonists in
      bleeding ulcer published between 1984 and 2000 were added to those from the
      initial meta-analysis. Pooled rates of re-bleeding, surgery and death were
      re-calculated, together with the relative risk reduction, absolute risk
      reduction, number needed to treat and Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio. RESULTS:
      Intravenous H2-receptor antagonists did not significantly reduce re-bleeding,
      surgery or death in bleeding duodenal ulcer. There were small but significant
      reductions in re-bleeding, surgery and death in bleeding gastric ulcer; the
      absolute risk reductions were 7.2%, 6.7% and 3.2%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:
      Intravenous H2-receptor antagonists are of no value in bleeding duodenal ulcer,
      although they may be mildly beneficial in bleeding gastric ulcer. Because proton 
      pump inhibitors have a greater inhibitory effect on gastric acid secretion than
      H2-receptor antagonists, they may be more effective in ulcer bleeding and should 
      be further evaluated for that indication.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic study of esomeprazole in patients with hepatic impairment.
PG  - 491-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of esomeprazole (Nexium), 
      the S-isomer of omeprazole, after repeated oral dosing in patients with hepatic
      impairment. DESIGN: Single-centre, open-label one-way study. METHODS: Twelve
      patients (aged 40-60 years) with mild to severe hepatic impairment received
      once-daily oral esomeprazole 40 mg for 5 days. Serial blood samples were drawn up
      to 24 h post-dose on day 5 to determine plasma levels of esomeprazole and its
      metabolites. Pharmacokinetic parameters were compared with an historical control 
      group of 36 gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) patients (aged 29-58 years) 
      with normal hepatic function. RESULTS: Esomeprazole was absorbed rapidly (mean
      maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) 6.1 micromol/l, mean time to Cmax (tmax) 1.9 
      h) and eliminated rapidly (mean plasma elimination half-life (t1/2) 2.1 h).
      Elimination of its pharmacologically inactive sulphone and hydroxy metabolites
      was more gradual. Patients with mild hepatic impairment had area under the plasma
      concentration-time curve during the dosage interval (AUCtau) and t1/2 values
      largely within the range of the control group. In patients with moderate hepatic 
      impairment, t1/2 values were similar and AUCtau was slightly higher than in
      controls, whereas both parameters were increased in patients with severe hepatic 
      impairment. The mean ratios of esomeprazole AUCtau, Cmax and t1/2 values in
      patients with and without hepatic impairment were 1.8, 1.3 and 1.3, respectively.
      CONCLUSIONS: The steady-state pharmacokinetics of esomeprazole were not altered
      substantially by mild or moderate hepatic impairment; however, plasma levels of
      esomeprazole were elevated in severe cases. Thus, dose adjustment appears
      unwarranted in mild or moderate hepatic impairment, but may be required in some
      severely impaired patients. Esomeprazole was tolerated well across the spectrum
      of hepatic impairment.

TI  - Combination drug therapy for gastroesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 912-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of combination therapy with proton-pump
      inhibitors (PPIs) and histamine(2) receptor antagonists in gastroesophageal
      reflux disease (GERD). DATA SOURCES: Clinical literature identified through
      MEDLINE (January 1966-August 2001). Key search terms included gastroesophageal
      reflux, benzimidazoles; omeprazole; lansoprazole; pantoprazole; rabeprazole;
      receptor antagonists, histamine(2); therapy, combination drug; therapy, combined 
      modality; and combinations, drug. DATA SYNTHESIS: Approximately 80-90% of
      patients show healing of reflux esophagitis after 8 weeks of once-daily PPI
      therapy. Patients taking PPI therapy twice daily still have nocturnal acid
      breakthrough (periods of gastric pH <4 lasting for > or =60 min during the night)
      as much as 70% of the time. The clinical application of this finding has not been
      shown. One trial has shown that omeprazole in the morning plus ranitidine at
      bedtime is not as effective as omeprazole twice daily given before the morning
      and evening meals at controlling nocturnal acid breakthrough. Further, 1 small
      trial in healthy subjects without GERD showed that the addition of a 1-time dose 
      of ranitidine at bedtime to a twice-daily regimen of omeprazole may decrease the 
      occurrence of nocturnal acid breakthrough. However, the clinical significance of 
      this finding is not clear. CONCLUSIONS: No studies in patients with GERD
      demonstrate that the addition of histamine(2) receptor antagonists to twice-daily
      PPI therapy provides any further benefit above that derived from PPIs alone. The 
      parameter used to measure the efficacy of combination regimens for GERD thus
      far--nocturnal acid breakthrough--has not been proven to correlate with
      improvement of GERD symptoms in any controlled or prospective clinical trials.
      Further investigation is needed to determine optimal therapy in patients
      refractory to standard doses of PPIs.

TI  - Hiatal hernia is the key factor determining the lansoprazole dosage required for 
      effective intra-oesophageal acid suppression.
PG  - 881-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Effective intra-oesophageal acid suppression can be achieved with
      lansoprazole. The daily dosage could be influenced by the presence of hiatal
      hernia. AIM: To assess the lansoprazole daily dosage required to normalize
      oesophageal acid exposure in patients with and without hiatal hernia. METHODS:
      Fifty patients with complications or atypical manifestations of
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease were given lansoprazole, 30 mg once daily.
      Three to four weeks after the start of treatment, patients underwent oesophageal 
      pH monitoring while on therapy. If the results were still abnormal, the
      lansoprazole dosage was doubled and 24-h pH-metry was repeated 20-30 days
      thereafter. RESULTS: A 30-mg daily dosage of lansoprazole normalized oesophageal 
      acid exposure in 70% of cases, whilst a 60-mg daily dosage was necessary in the
      remainder: the two groups differed only in the presence of hiatal hernia (28% vs.
      100%, respectively; P=0.000). Effective intra-oesophageal acid suppression was
      obtained in all 25 patients without hiatal hernia with the 30-mg daily dosage of 
      lansoprazole. CONCLUSIONS: Hiatal hernia is the key factor determining the
      lansoprazole dosage required for effective intra-oesophageal acid suppression in 
      complicated and atypical gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. High efficacy of a
      30-mg daily dosage of lansoprazole can be predicted in the absence of hiatal
      hernia.

TI  - Efficacy of trimebutine therapy in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease 
      and irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 193-7
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) occurs in 25-51% of IBS
      (irritable bowel syndrome) patients. Trimebutine has been effective in some IBS
      patients by modulating colonic motility. Furthermore, it increases gastric
      emptying rates, and controls esophageal motility. The aim of this study was to
      investigate the efficacy of trimebutine therapy in GERD patients with IBS.
      METHODOLOGY: Sixty-nine patients with GERD and IBS underwent upper
      gastrointestinal endoscopic, histologic and clinical evaluation prior to and 3
      months post-treatment. H. pylori presence was determined by histology and
      CLOtest. Forty patients (Group A) were treated with omeprazole plus trimebutine
      for 3 months: in 32 H. pylori-positive patients (subgroup A1), a standard triple 
      eradication regimen was introduced. Twenty-nine patients (Group B) were treated
      with omeprazole for 3 months: in 24 H. pylori-positive patients (subgroup B1),
      the same eradication therapy was employed. RESULTS: Specialized intestinal
      metaplasia of the gastroesophageal junction was observed in 20% and in 17.2% of
      the patients in Groups A and B, respectively. Eradication rates were similar in
      subgroups A1 (84%) and B1 (83%). In Group A there was a significant improvement
      in GERD (P = 0.003) and IBS symptoms (P < 0.0001) as well as esophagitis (P =
      0.029), when compared with Group B. CONCLUSIONS: Trimebutine appears to be
      effective in patients with GERD and IBS.

TI  - Dual versus triple therapy in eradication of Helicobacter pylori.
PG  - 172-5
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Duodenal ulcers should be treated by eradication of Helicobacter
      pylori. This study compared the efficacy of a proton pump inhibitor together with
      one or two antibiotics in eradication therapy. METHODOLOGY: 177 patients who were
      H. pylori positive were randomized to receive 14 days of either: lansoprazole 30 
      mg bd and amoxicillin 1 g bd (LA), omeprazole 20 mg bd and amoxicillin 1 g bd
      (OA) or lansoprazole 30 mg bd, amoxicillin 1 g bd and clarithromycin 500 mg bd
      (LAC). The efficacy was assessed at four weeks and at six months after the end of
      treatment. Biopsies were taken for culture and bacterial sensitivity testing at
      inclusion and at four weeks after the end of treatment. RESULTS: 149 patients
      were evaluated for efficacy. The eradication rate was significantly higher in LAC
      (96%) compared to LA (51%) and OA (64%) treatments (P < 0.001). At baseline 17%, 
      21% and 19% of the patients in the LA, OA and LAC groups, respectively, were
      resistant to metronidazole and only one patient was resistant to clarithromycin. 
      Post-treatment, four patients had acquired metronidazole resistance. CONCLUSIONS:
      LAC is more effective than LA and OA for eradication of H. pylori in duodenal
      ulcer disease.

TI  - Esomeprazole (40 mg) compared with lansoprazole (30 mg) in the treatment of
      erosive esophagitis.
PG  - 575-83
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Esomeprazole, the S isomer of omeprazole, has been shown to have
      higher healing rates of erosive esophagitis than omeprazole. This study compared 
      esomeprazole with lansoprazole for the healing of erosive esophagitis and
      resolution of heartburn. METHODS: This United States multicenter, randomized,
      double blind, parallel group trial was performed in 5241 adult patients
      (intent-to-treat population) with endoscopically documented erosive esophagitis, 
      which was graded by severity at baseline (Los Angeles classification). Patients
      received 40 mg of esomeprazole (n = 2624) or 30 mg of lansoprazole (n = 2617)
      once daily before breakfast for up to 8 wk. The primary efficacy endpoint was
      healing of erosive esophagitis at week 8. Secondary assessments included
      proportion of patients healed at week 4, resolution of investigator-recorded
      heartburn, time to first and time to sustained resolution of patient
      diary-recorded heartburn, and proportion of heartburn-free days and nights.
      RESULTS: Esomeprazole (40 mg) demonstrated significantly higher healing rates
      (92.6%, 95% CI = 91.5-93.6%) than lansoprazole (30 mg) (88.8%, 95% CI =
      87.5-90.0%) at week 8 (p = 0.0001, life-table estimates, intent-to-treat
      analysis). A significant difference in healing rates favoring esomeprazole was
      also observed at week 4. The difference in healing rates between esomeprazole and
      lansoprazole increased as baseline severity of erosive esophagitis increased.
      Sustained resolution of heartburn occurred faster and in more patients treated
      with esomeprazole. Sustained resolution of nocturnal heartburn also occurred
      faster with esomeprazole. Both treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS:
      Esomeprazole (40 mg) is more effective than lansoprazole (30 mg) in healing
      erosive esophagitis and resolving heartburn. Healing rates are consistently high 
      with esomeprazole, irrespective of baseline disease severity.

TI  - Increased primary resistance to recommended antibiotics negatively affects
      Helicobacter pylori eradication.
PG  - 53-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of two commonly employed treatments for
      Helicobacter pylori infection and the impact of bacterial resistance to
      antibiotics on eradication rate. METHODS: Ninety-two consecutive H.
      pylori-positive patients with active peptic ulcer disease were randomly enrolled 
      to receive a 7-day treatment with either lansoprazole 30 mg plus amoxicillin 1 g 
      and clarithromycin 500 mg [all twice a day (b.i.d.), Group A, n = 46]; or bismuth
      subcitrate 125 mg four times a day (q.i.d.) plus tetracycline 500 mg q.i.d and
      furazolidone 200 mg b.i.d. (Group B, n = 46) H. pylori status was reassessed 30
      days after completion of the therapy and bacterial resistance to the antibiotics 
      was investigated using an in vitro assay. RESULTS: Five patients from each study 
      group were lost to follow up. Both treatments resulted in similar H. pylori
      eradication rate: 66-60% (per protocol), 59-52% (intention-to-treat) in Groups A 
      and B, respectively (non significant). However, eradication improved to 79% in
      the absence of H. pylori resistance to clarithromycin or amoxicillin. CONCLUSION:
      Primary resistance to clarithromycin or amoxicillin may underscore a potentially 
      serious problem for the eradication of H. pylori infection. Testing for bacterial
      resistance may become necessary to improve therapeutic efficacy.

TI  - The cost-effectiveness of population Helicobacter pylori screening and treatment:
      a Markov model using economic data from a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 559-68
AB  - BACKGROUND: Economic models have suggested that population Helicobacter pylori
      screening and treatment may be a cost-effective method of reducing mortality from
      gastric cancer. These models are conservative as they do not consider that the
      programme may reduce health service peptic ulcer and other dyspepsia costs. We
      have evaluated the economic impact of population H. pylori screening and
      treatment over 2 years in a randomized controlled trial and have incorporated the
      results into an economic model exploring the impact of H. pylori eradication on
      peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. METHODS: Subjects between the ages of 40
      and 49 years were randomly invited to attend their local primary care centre. H. 
      pylori status was evaluated by (13)C-urea breath test and infected individuals
      were randomized to receive omeprazole, 20 mg b.d., clarithromycin, 250 mg b.d.,
      and tinidazole, 500 mg b.d., for 7 days or identical placebos. Economic data on
      health service costs for dyspepsia were obtained from a primary care note review 
      for the 2 years following randomization. These data were incorporated into a
      Markov model comparing population H. pylori screening and treatment with no
      intervention. RESULTS: A total of 2329 of 8407 subjects were H. pylori positive: 
      1161 were randomized to receive eradication therapy and 1163 to receive placebo. 
      The cost difference favoured the intervention group 2 years after randomization, 
      but this did not reach statistical significance (11.42 ponds sterling per subject
      cost saving; 95% confidence interval, 30.04 ponds sterling to -7.19 pounds
      sterling; P=0.23). Analysis by gender suggested a statistically significant
      dyspepsia cost saving in men (27.17 ponds sterling per subject; 95% confidence
      interval, 50.01 pounds sterling to 4.32 pounds sterling; P=0.02), with no benefit
      in women (-4.46 per subject; 95% confidence interval, -33.85 pounds sterling to
      24.93 pounds sterling). Modelling of these data suggested that population H.
      pylori screening and treatment for 1,000,000 45-year-olds would save over
      6,000,000 pounds sterling and 1300 years of life. The programme would cost 14,
      200 pounds sterling per life year saved if the health service dyspepsia cost
      savings were the lower limit of the 95% confidence intervals and H. pylori
      eradication had only a 10% efficacy in reducing mortality from distal gastric
      cancer and peptic ulcer disease. CONCLUSIONS: Modelling suggests that population 
      H. pylori screening and treatment are likely to be cost-effective and could be
      the first cost-neutral screening programme. This provides a further mandate for
      clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of population H. pylori screening and
      treatment in preventing mortality from gastric cancer and peptic ulcer disease.

TI  - Onset of symptom relief with rabeprazole: a community-based, open-label
      assessment of patients with erosive oesophagitis.
PG  - 445-54
AB  - BACKGROUND: In numerous clinical trials, proton pump inhibitors have demonstrated
      potent acid suppression and healing of erosive oesophagitis, as well as
      successful symptom relief for the entire spectrum of gastro-oesophageal reflux
      disease. AIM: The 'Future of Acid Suppression Therapy' (FAST) trial evaluated, in
      actual clinical practice, the timing of symptom relief, changes in symptom
      severity, health-related quality of life and safety in endoscopically confirmed
      erosive gastro-oesophageal reflux disease treated with rabeprazole. METHODS: This
      open-label, multicentre study enrolled 2579 patients to receive rabeprazole
      treatment using 20 mg once daily for 8 weeks. Between two clinical visits (at
      enrollment and week 8), patients used an interactive voice response system to
      rate gastro-oesophageal reflux disease symptoms. Subgroup analyses of efficacy
      were conducted for gender, age, Hetzel-Dent grade, presence of Barrett's
      oesophagus and for patients reporting previously ineffective symptom relief with 
      omeprazole or lansoprazole. RESULTS: On day 1, rabeprazole significantly
      decreased daytime and night-time heartburn severity, regurgitation and belching. 
      Complete relief of daytime and night-time heartburn was achieved in 64.0% and
      69.2% of symptomatic patients, respectively, on day 1, and in 81.1% and 85.7% of 
      patients, respectively, on day 7. Patients with moderate or severe heartburn
      symptoms at baseline achieved an even greater degree of satisfactory symptom
      relief (none or mild) from day 1 onwards. The median time to satisfactory
      heartburn relief was 2 days. Subgroup analyses showed no consistent differences
      in efficacy compared to the overall population treated. Health-related quality of
      life in patients was significantly lower than that of the US general population
      and improved significantly after 8 weeks of rabeprazole therapy. Rabeprazole was 
      well tolerated, with headache as the most common adverse event, reported by less 
      than 2% of the study population. CONCLUSIONS: In this large, open-label trial,
      rabeprazole rapidly and effectively relieved gastro-oesophageal reflux disease
      symptoms in most patients with erosive oesophagitis. Substantial symptom relief
      was noted on day 1; improvement continued over the first week and at week 4. By
      week 8, the health-related quality of life had also improved vs. baseline.

TI  - Long-term effect of H2RA therapy on nocturnal gastric acid breakthrough.
PG  - 625-32
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Adding histamine 2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) to proton pump
      inhibitor (PPI) therapy is a common practice to block nocturnal acid breakthrough
      (NAB). Controversy exists over its efficacy because of H2RA intolerance. No
      prospective study has addressed this issue. METHODS: Twenty-three healthy
      volunteers and 20 gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) patients were studied.
      Ambulatory pH monitoring was performed with one electrode in the gastric fundus
      and the other 5 cm above the lower esophageal sphincter. Baseline pH testing was 
      performed and repeated after 2 weeks on PPI twice daily before meals (omeprazole 
      20 mg). All subjects then received 28 days of PPI plus H2RA Qhs (ranitidine 300
      mg) with repeat pH testing on days 1, 7, and 28. RESULTS: Eighteen controls and
      16 GERD patients completed all 5 studies. Compared with baseline, all 4
      medication regimens decreased supine % time pH < 4 (P = 0.001). The
      administration of PPI + 1 day of H2RA was the only therapy that significantly
      decreased % time gastric pH < 4 for the supine period compared with PPI twice
      daily alone (P < 0.001). There was no difference in % time supine gastric pH < 4 
      between 2 weeks of PPI twice daily alone and either 1 week or 1 month of PPI +
      bedtime H2RA. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of H2RA and PPI therapy reduced NAB
      only with the introduction of therapy. Because of H2RA tolerance, there is no
      difference in acid suppression between PPI twice daily and PPI twice daily + H2RA
      after 1 week of combination therapy.

TI  - Epinephrine versus epinephrine plus fibrin glue injection in peptic ulcer
      bleeding: a prospective randomized trial.
PG  - 348-53
AB  - BACKGROUND: Peptic ulcer bleeding remains a disease with considerable morbidity
      and mortality. Epinephrine is the most widely used endoscopic injection agent,
      but bleeding recurs in 20% of high-risk cases. Fibrin glue might be an ideal
      injection agent, based on its physiologic properties, despite its demanding
      injection technique and high cost. The aim of this study was to determine whether
      the injection of fibrin glue in combination with epinephrine improves outcome for
      patients at high risk of recurrent bleeding. METHODS: Patients were prospectively
      randomized to injection of epinephrine alone (n = 70) or epinephrine plus fibrin 
      glue (n = 65). Endoscopy was repeated daily until the ulcer base was clean. All
      patients were treated with high-dose omeprazole. RESULTS: Initial hemostasis was 
      100% in both groups. There was no significant overall difference in rates of
      recurrent bleeding (24.3% and 21.5%, respectively, for epinephrine and
      epinephrine plus fibrin). When patients were stratified according to Forrest
      criteria, no significant difference could be found, although there was a trend
      toward less recurrent bleeding after fibrin injection of actively bleeding
      ulcers. There was no significant difference in the proportions of patients who
      required surgery (10% and 6%, respectively, for epinephrine and epinephrine plus 
      fibrin). Mortality was the same (3%) in each group. CONCLUSIONS: Adding fibrin
      glue to epinephrine for injection treatment of bleeding peptic ulcers does not
      improve outcome. Fibrin glue might be of some value in selected cases.

TI  - Brazilian consensus on gastroesophageal reflux disease: proposals for assessment,
      classification, and management.
PG  - 241-8
AB  - The Brazilian Consensus on Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease considers
      gastroesophageal reflux disease to be a chronic disorder related to the
      retrograde flow of gastroduodenal contents into the esophagus and/or adjacent
      organs, resulting in a variable spectrum of symptoms, with or without tissue
      damage. Considering the limitations of classifications currently in use, a new
      classification is proposed that combines three criteria-clinical, endoscopic, and
      pH-metric-providing a comprehensive and more complete characterization of the
      disease. The diagnosis begins with the presence of heartburn, acid regurgitation,
      and alarm manifestations (dysphagia, odynophagia, weight loss, GI bleeding,
      nausea and/or vomiting, and family history of cancer). Also, atypical esophageal,
      pulmonary, otorhinolaryngological, and oral symptoms may occur. Endoscopy is the 
      first approach, particularly in patients over 40 yr of age and in those with
      alarm symptoms. Other exams are considered in particular cases, such as contrast 
      radiological examination, scyntigraphy, manometry, and prolonged pH measurement. 
      The clinical treatment encompasses behavioral modifications in lifestyle and
      pharmacological measures. Proton pump inhibitors in manufacturers' recommended
      doses are indicated, with doubling of the dose in more severe cases of
      esophagitis. The minimum time of administration is 6 wk. Patients who do not
      respond to medical treatment, including those with atypical manifestations,
      should be considered for surgical treatment. Of the complications of
      gastroesophageal reflux disease, Barrett's esophagus presents a potential
      development of adenocarcinoma; biopsies should be performed, independent of
      Barrett's esophagus extent or location. In this regard the designation "short
      Barrett's" is not important in terms of management and prognosis.

TI  - Clinical outcome and influencing factors of a new short-term quadruple therapy
      for Helicobacter pylori eradication: a randomized controlled trial (MACLOR
      study).
PG  - 153-60
AB  - BACKGROUND: Short-term therapies for eradicating Helicobacter pylori in selected 
      patients might offer advantages in terms of costs, compliance, and adverse
      effects in contrast to standard 1-week triple therapy. METHODS: To determine
      eradication success and influencing factors in a new short-term quadruple
      therapy, a total of 243 patients positive for H pylori were randomly assigned to 
      1 of 3 regimens according to age, smoking status, and diagnosis: a 5-day
      treatment with 3 antibiotics (amoxicillin, 1 g twice daily [bid]; clarithromycin,
      250 mg bid; and metronidazole, 400 mg bid) and lansoprazole (30 mg bid [L5;
      reference treatment]) or ranitidine hydrochloride (300 mg bid [R5]), or the same 
      3-day antibiotic-lansoprazole combination (L3) with a 2-day pretreatment with
      lansoprazole. RESULTS: A total of 234 patients completed the study. On an
      intention-to-treat basis, overall eradication of H pylori was confirmed in 86.4%:
      89.2% in the L5 group vs 81.2% in the L3 group vs 88.8% in the R5 group;
      differences were not significant. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed
      that younger age (<55 years; P =.03), history of peptic ulcer disease (P =.04),
      smoking (P =.03), metronidazole resistance (P =.003), low ranitidine trough serum
      concentrations (P =.005), cytotoxin-associated gene A-negative strains in peptic 
      ulcer disease (P =.04), and outer inflammatory protein A-positive strains (P
      =.02) were associated with eradication failure. CONCLUSIONS: This new quadruple H
      pylori eradication regimen is efficacious, safe, well tolerated, and cost saving,
      and may be a treatment option for patients older than 55 years with no history of
      peptic ulcer disease. Furthermore, strains that are sensitive to all antibiotics,
      cytotoxin-associated gene A-positive, and outer inflammatory protein A-negative
      could be suitable for short-term quadruple therapy. Patients with an unfavorable 
      combination of characteristics should be treated for a minimum of 7 days.

TI  - Lansoprazole: pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and clinical uses.
PG  - 1663-70
AB  - Lansoprazole (Prevacid, TAP Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) is a substituted benzimidazole
      that inhibits gastric acid secretion. This agent is approved for the short-term
      treatment of erosive reflux oesophagitis, active gastric ulcer, active duodenal
      ulcer and the treatment of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced
      gastric and duodenal ulcers. It is also approved for the long-term treatment of
      healed reflux oesophagitis, healed duodenal ulcer, the treatment of
      hypersecretory conditions such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and the eradication 
      of Helicobacter pylori as a component of triple therapy with lansoprazole,
      clarithromycin and amoxicillin, or dual therapy with lansoprazole and
      amoxicillin. Its mechanism of action is to selectively inhibit the membrane
      enzyme H+/K+ ATPase in gastric parietal cells. In clinical trials, lansoprazole
      is more effective than placebo or histamine (H2)-receptor antagonists in the
      treatment of reflux oesophagitis. Lansoprazole administered at a dose of 30 mg
      daily produced faster relief of symptoms and superior healing rates in patients
      with gastric or duodenal ulcers or reflux oesophagitis than H2-receptor
      antagonists. A daily dose of 30 mg lansoprazole reduced epigastric pain faster
      than omeprazole 20 mg daily in patients with peptic ulcer disease but healing
      rates at 4 and 8 weeks were similar with both agents at these dosages.
      Lansoprazole was more effective than H2-receptor antagonists in patients with
      Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and produced similar treatment outcome to omeprazole. 
      Lansoprazole in combination with clarithromycin and amoxicillin produced similar 
      rates of eradication of H. pylori. In clinical trials, lansoprazole is
      well-tolerated and has a low frequency of side effects similar to that of
      H2-receptor antagonists or omeprazole.

TI  - Ulcer and gastritis.
PG  - 104-10
AB  - The literature on peptic ulcer and gastritis in 2000 again focused on the topics 
      of Helicobacter pylori, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and
      gastric cancer. New diagnostic tests for H. pylori infection have been evaluated,
      and rescue therapies for failed H. pylori eradication have been tested. The
      causal relationship between H. pylori infection and nonulcer dyspepsia, gastric
      cancer, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and NSAID-related ulcers remained heated
      topics of debate. In 2000, landmark clinical trials and meta-analyses were
      published addressing these issues. The role of endoscopy in managing nonulcer
      dyspepsia was better defined. The role of H. pylori eradication in NSAID/aspirin 
      users was reexamined in high-risk patients. Clinical benefit was finally
      confirmed for specific inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). The millennium
      year turned out to be a very important one in the advancement of knowledge in
      this field.

TI  - Barrett's metaplasia: clinical implications.
PG  - 563-5
AB  - The incidence of Barrett's metaplasia (BM) as well as Barrett's adenocarcinoma
      (BA) has been increasing in western populations. The prognosis of BA is worse
      because individuals present at a late stage. Attempts have been made to intervene
      at early stage using surveillance programmes, although proof of efficacy of
      endoscopic surveillance is lacking, particularly outside the specialist centres. 
      The management of BM needs to be evidence-based as there is a lack clarity about 
      how best to treat this condition. The role of proton pump inhibitors and
      antireflux surgery to control reflux symptoms is justified. Whether adequate
      control of gastroesophageal reflux early in the disease alters the natural
      history of Barrett's change once it has developed, and/or prevents it in patients
      with gastroesophageal reflux disease but with no Barrett's change, remains
      unanswered. There is much to be learned about BM. Thus there is great need for
      carefully designed large randomised controlled trials to address these issues in 
      order to determine how best to manage patients with BM.

TI  - Eradication of Helicobacter pylori and risk of peptic ulcers in patients starting
      long-term treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: a randomised
      trial.
PG  - 9-13
AB  - BACKGROUND: Whether Helicobacter pylori increases the risk of ulcers in patients 
      taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is controversial. We
      hypothesised that eradication of H pylori infection would reduce the risk of
      ulcers for patients starting long-term NSAID treatment. METHODS: Patients were
      enrolled if they were NSAID naive, had a positive urea breath test, had dyspepsia
      or an ulcer history, and required long-term NSAID treatment. They were randomly
      assigned omeprazole triple therapy (eradication group) or omeprazole with placebo
      antibiotics (placebo group) for 1 week. All patients were given diclofenac slow
      release 100 mg daily for 6 months from randomisation. Endoscopy was done at 6
      months or if severe dyspepsia or gastrointestinal bleeding occurred. The primary 
      endpoint was the probability of ulcers within 6 months. Analyses were by
      intention to treat. FINDINGS: Of 210 arthritis patients screened, 128 (61%) were 
      positive for H pylori. 102 patients were enrolled, and 100 were included in the
      intention-to-treat analysis. H pylori was eradicated in 90% of the eradication
      group and 6% of the placebo group. Five of 51 eradication-group patients and 15
      of 49 placebo-group patients had ulcers. The 6-month probability of ulcers was
      12.1% (95% CI 3.1-21.1) in the eradication group and 34.4% (21.1-47.7) in the
      placebo group (p=0.0085). The corresponding 6-month probabilities of complicated 
      ulcers were 4.2% (1.3-9.7) and 27.1% (14.7-39.5; p=0.0026). INTERPRETATION:
      Screening and treatment for H pylori infection significantly reduces the risk of 
      ulcers for patients starting long-term NSAID treatment.

TI  - Reliability, validity, and responsiveness of severity of dyspepsia assessment
      (SODA) in a randomized clinical trial of a COX-2-specific inhibitor and
      traditional NSAID therapy.
PG  - 32-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess the Severity of Dyspepsia Assessment (SODA) scales
      as measures of change in dyspepsia-related health in a blinded, randomized,
      controlled trial in arthritis patients treated with nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs. METHODS: Three thousand nine hundred seven arthritis
      patients completed SODA at baseline and weeks 4, 13, 26, and 52 and/or at early
      termination. Using baseline and 4-wk data, reliability was evaluated with
      Cronbach's a and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Dyspepsia adverse 
      events were defined based on a combined set of World Health Organization Adverse 
      Reaction Terminology terms. The ability of SODA to measure change in
      dyspepsia-related health was evaluated by comparing SODA change scores by
      dyspepsia adverse event severity level and withdrawal status. Responsiveness was 
      further evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC) from receiver operating
      characteristic curves using withdrawal due to dyspepsia as the criterion.
      RESULTS: The SODA scales--Pain Intensity (alpha = 0.93), Non Pain Symptoms (alpha
      = 0.82), and Satisfaction (alpha = 0.89)--demonstrated excellent internal
      consistency reliability using baseline data. Reproducibility was fair to good:
      Pain Intensity ICC = 0.49, Non Pain Symptoms ICC = 0.61, and Satisfaction ICC =
      0.45. SODA change scores (4-wk score - baseline score) increased, or worsened,
      with increasing dyspepsia severity and differentiated between adjacent levels of 
      dyspepsia severity for eight of nine adjacent comparisons (p < 0.05). SODA change
      scores also differentiated between those who did and did not withdraw (p <
      0.001). Responsiveness was highest with the Pain Intensity scale (AUC = 0.78),
      followed by the Non Pain Symptoms (AUC = 0.74) and Satisfaction (AUC = 0.75)
      scales. CONCLUSIONS: SODA is a reliable, valid instrument for use as a measure of
      dyspepsia tolerability in future clinical trials involving
      cyclo-oxygenase-2-specific and/or traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs.

TI  - Amoxycillin, clarithromycin and either sucralfate or pantoprazole for eradication
      of Helicobacter pylori in duodenal ulcer (a randomized controlled trial).
PG  - 939-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sucralfate enhances the anti-Helicobacter pylori activity of
      antimicrobials and has an inhibitory effect on H. pylori. AIM: To evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of one-week sucralfate-based eradication therapy for H.
      pylori infection in patients with duodenal ulcers, compared with treatment based 
      on pantoprazole, in a randomized controlled multicenter study. METHODS: One
      hundred and twenty patients with active duodenal ulcers and H. pylori infection
      were treated with amoxycillin 1 g b.d. plus clarithromycin 500 mg b.d. for the
      first 7 days. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either sucralfate 1 g
      t.d.s. for 4 weeks (SAC group; n = 60) or pantoprazole (PAC group; n = 60) 40 mg 
      b.d. for the first 7 days and 40 mg o.d. for the next 3 weeks. The patient's H.
      pylori status was determined by a urease test and histological investigation
      before the treatment, and again 4 weeks after cessation of all medication.
      RESULTS: One hundred and eleven patients completed the study. H. pylori infection
      was eradicated in 76.4% (42/55) of patients in the SAC group (ITT analysis: 70%, 
      95% CI: 58-80%) vs. 85.7% (48/56) of patients in the PAC group (ITT analysis:
      80%, 95% CI: 70-89) (N.S.). All ulcers had healed. There were no significant
      differences between the two regimens regarding the occurrence of adverse effects.
      CONCLUSION: Our study shows that one-week triple therapy with amoxycillin,
      clarithromycin and either pantoprazole or sucralfate are effective regimens to
      cure H. pylori infection in patients with duodenal ulcer.

TI  - Evaluation of omeprazole in the treatment of reflux laryngitis: a prospective,
      placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study.
PG  - 2147-51
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Proton-pump inhibitors are often recommended in the treatment of
      laryngitis secondary to gastric reflux. Despite prospective treatment studies
      reporting high efficacy, only one previous report has been placebo-controlled and
      blinded. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of omeprazole 
      in treating proven reflux laryngitis. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective,
      placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind clinical trial. METHODS: Fifty-three
      patients with one or more reflux laryngitis symptoms were recruited to undergo
      24-hour dual-channel pH probe testing. Thirty patients with more than four
      episodes of laryngopharyngeal reflux were enrolled. By random assignment, 15
      patients received 40 mg omeprazole twice a day and the other 15 received placebo 
      for a period of 2 months. Symptoms (hoarseness, throat pain, lump in throat
      sensation, throat clearing, cough, excessive phlegm, dysphagia, odynophagia, and 
      heartburn) and endoscopic laryngeal signs (erythema, edema, and mucus
      accumulation) were recorded initially, at 1 month, and 2 months. RESULTS: In
      general, most symptom scores improved over time for both the omeprazole and
      placebo groups. Hoarseness, when patients begin with low hoarseness symptom
      scores, and throat clearing improved significantly more in patients on omeprazole
      than in those on placebo during the 2-month study. Throat pain, lump in throat
      sensation, excessive phlegm, difficulty swallowing, pain with swallowing, and
      heartburn showed improvement in both treatment arms, signifying the possibility
      of a placebo effect. Endoscopic laryngeal signs did not change significantly over
      the course of the study for either treatment group. CONCLUSIONS: A placebo effect
      appears to exist in the treatment of reflux laryngitis. However, hoarseness, when
      initially scored low, and throat clearing resulting from reflux laryngitis are
      effectively treated by omeprazole.

PG  - 2144-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the extent to which gastroesophageal reflux
      (GER)-initiated laryngeal chemoreflexes contribute to obstructive sleep apnea
      (OSA). METHODS: Prospective, nonrandomized clinical trial of an antireflux
      treatment protocol as a means of reducing the severity of OSA. Population
      consisted of 10 males aged 20 to 64 years with confirmed OSA (by overnight
      polysomnography) and GER (by ambulatory pH probe monitoring). Patients were
      treated with omeprazole and standard antireflux protocol for 30 days and pre- and
      posttreatment polysomnography variables were compared. RESULTS: Mean apnea index 
      declined 31% (45-31, P = .04); mean respiratory disturbance index declined 25%
      (62-46, P = .06). Three patients (30%) are "treatment responders" as defined by
      traditional OSA treatment definitions. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a
      potential relationship between OSA and GER, the treatment of which may be an
      effective adjunctive in those with both disorders. Treatment of GER may
      significantly impact OSA in select individuals.

TI  - Omeprazole versus ranitidine in the medical treatment of acute upper
      gastrointestinal bleeding: assessment by early repeat endoscopy.
PG  - 661-4
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of acid suppression in
      patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding using early repeat endoscopy.
      Ninety-two patients with the diagnosis of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding
      (endoscopically verified), entered a single-blind, randomised study comparing two
      treatment groups: omeprazole (40 mg orally daily) to ranitidine (50 mg
      intravenously four times daily). The lesions considered were gastric ulcers,
      duodenal ulcers and erosive gastritis. All patients were candidates for medical
      treatment. The parameters assessed included: 1) stabilisation of the lesion by
      repeat endoscopy at 7.0 +/- 3.0 days, 2) bleeding recurrence, 3) duration of stay
      in the intermediate medical care unit. For erosive gastritis only parameters 2
      and 3 were considered. The study was limited to the hospitalisation period.
      Endoscopic stabilisation rate at 7.0 +/- 3.0 days for duodenal lesions was higher
      in the omeprazole group (71% vs 37%, p=0.03), but there was no significant
      difference for gastric lesions (50% vs 54%, NS). The overall bleeding recurrence 
      rate (0% vs 17%, p=0.013) and the duration of stay (3.9 vs 6.4 days, p<0.01) were
      significantly lower in the omeprazole group. Our study suggests that omeprazole
      is more effective than ranitidine in the pharmacological treatment of acute upper
      gastrointestinal bleeding.

TI  - Clinical efficacy of proton pump inhibitor therapy in neurologically impaired
      children with gastroesophageal reflux: prospective study.
PG  - 356-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of proton pump inhibitors in reducing vomiting,
      gastrointestinal bleeding, and chest infections in institutionalised
      neurologically impaired children with gastroesophageal reflux. DESIGN:
      Prospective study. SETTING: A regional hospital, Hong Kong. PATIENTS:
      Neurologically impaired children with refractory gastroesophageal reflux. MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Episodes of vomiting, gastrointestinal bleeding, and pneumonia 
      in the baseline and proton pump inhibitor treatment periods. RESULTS: Nine
      children received proton pump inhibitor therapy for a median duration of 81 days.
      Mean reflux index was 9.3% (standard deviation, 5%). Dosage of omeprazole used
      was 1.0-2.3 mg/kg/d. Vomiting was reduced significantly with proton pump
      inhibitor treatment (median vomiting index [baseline]=0.4, median vomiting index 
      [proton pump inhibitors]=0.2; P<0.05). No significant decrease in
      gastrointestinal bleeding or chest infection was observed. CONCLUSION: Proton
      pump inhibitors significantly reduced vomiting episodes in neurologically
      impaired children with gastroesophageal reflux.

TI  - A novel therapeutic approach for Helicobacter pylori infection: the bismuth-based
      triple therapy monocapsule.
PG  - 1559-66
AB  - Helicobacter pylori infection causes peptic ulcer disease and must be regarded as
      a serious infectious disease. Over the past two decades treatment of the
      infection has been a controversial issue. Treatment is purely empirical and based
      on combinations of two, three or four existing drugs. Antimicrobial resistance is
      important and an observed increase in the prevalence of resistance may change the
      relative importance of certain antibiotics. Bismuth-based triple therapy with
      bismuth, tetracycline and metronidazole is a well investigated, cheap and FDA
      approved regimen to cure the infection. Adding a proton pump inhibitor (PPI)
      increases efficacy. A novel monocapsule ("Helicide") that contains bismuth,
      tetracycline and metronidazole simplifies the regimen. This new and
      patient-friendly drug has been investigated in clinical studies and is expected
      to be released in North America in 2002.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori: strategies for treatment.
PG  - 1231-41
AB  - Helicobacter pylori (Hp) is a Gram-negative bacteria able to live in the human
      stomach, a very surprising fact considering the acid environment of gastric
      mucosa. Identified by Marshall and Warren in 1982 [1,2], this bacterium seems
      aetiologically related to many gastric diseases, previously known as 'acid
      related diseases'. Compelling evidence demonstrates that Hp is the most important
      aetiological agent of gastritis [3], the principal causal factor in peptic ulcer 
      [4], contributes to the genesis of gastric cancer [5] and has a critical role in 
      the development of many mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas [6].
      Although experimental data have recently provided hard evidence to support the
      role of Hp in the genesis of gastritis, ulcer and carcinoma [7], a critical
      argument for Hp generating peptic ulcer disease has been, in fact, the change in 
      the natural history of peptic ulcer that follows the cure of the infection.

TI  - Rabeprazole: an update of its use in acid-related disorders.
PG  - 2327-56
AB  - Rabeprazole is an inhibitor of the gastric proton pump. It causes dose-dependent 
      inhibition of acid secretion. In 8-week studies, among patients with
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), rabeprazole 20 mg/day or 10mg twice
      daily was as effective as omeprazole and superior to ranitidine in the healing of
      GORD. Symptom relief with rabeprazole was superior to that provided by placebo
      and ranitidine and similar to omeprazole. In long-term trials rabeprazole 10
      mg/day was similar to omeprazole 20 mg/day in a 2-year study and superior to
      placebo in 1-year studies, in both the maintenance of healing and prevention of
      symptoms in patients with healed GORD. In nonerosive GORD, 4-week studies have
      shown rabeprazole to be more effective than placebo in relieving heartburn and
      various other gastrointestinal symptoms. Data among patients with Barrett's
      oesophagus suggest rabeprazole 20 mg/day may be more effective than placebo in
      maintaining healing of associated oesophagitis after 1 year of treatment.
      One-week triple Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy with rabeprazole plus
      clarithromycin and amoxicillin achieved eradication rates of > or =85%.
      Rabeprazole is as effective as omeprazole and lansoprazole when included as part 
      of a triple-therapy regimen for the eradication of H. pylori. Eradication rates
      of >90% were achieved when rabeprazole 20 to 40 mg/day was included as part of a 
      quadruple eradication regimen. As monotherapy for peptic ulcer healing and
      symptom relief, 4- to 8-week studies have shown rabeprazole 10 to 40 mg/day to be
      superior to placebo and ranitidine and have similar efficacy to omeprazole.
      Preliminary 1-year data among 16 patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome suggest
      rabeprazole 60 to 120 mg/day can resolve and prevent the recurrence of symptoms
      and endoscopic lesions associated with this condition. In clinical trials of up
      to 2 years' duration the tolerability of rabeprazole is similar to that of
      placebo, ranitidine and omeprazole. Common adverse events assigned to rabeprazole
      have been diarrhoea, headache, rhinitis, nausea, pharyngitis and abdominal pain. 
      Histological changes and increases in serum gastrin levels were unremarkable and 
      typical of proton pump inhibitors. No dosage adjustment is necessary in renal and
      mild to moderate hepatic impairment. CONCLUSION: Rabeprazole is a well tolerated 
      proton pump inhibitor. It has proven efficacy in healing, symptom relief and
      prevention of relapse of peptic ulcers and GORD and can form part of effective H.
      pylori eradication regimens. It is an important alternative to H(2) antagonists
      and an additional treatment option to other proton pump inhibitors in the
      management of acid-related disorders.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
PG  - 937-52
AB  - The complex interaction between H. pylori and NSAIDs implies that it is over
      simplistic to conclude that their relationship is independent, synergistic, or
      antagonistic without considering the influence of other factors. Factors such as 
      previous exposure to NSAIDs, a history of ulcer complication, concurrent use of
      acid-suppressant therapy, and the difference between NSAIDs and low-dose aspirin 
      all affect the outcome. Several recommendations can be made with regard to the
      indications of H. pylori eradication for patients requiring NSAIDs. First,
      patients taking NSAIDs who have ulcers or previous ulcer disease should be tested
      for the bacterium, and it should be eradicated if present because it is
      impossible to determine whether the ulcers are caused by H. pylori or NSAIDs or
      both. Antiulcer drugs should be prescribed to prevent ulcer recurrence for
      patients who continue to require NSAIDs. Although the efficacy of omeprazole is
      enhanced by H. pylori infection, it is not justified to leave a pathogen in the
      stomach in exchange for a modest therapeutic gain. Second, for patients who take 
      low-dose aspirin, eradication of H. pylori substantially reduces the risk of
      ulcer bleeding. It is advisable that patients taking low-dose aspirin who are at 
      risk of ulcer bleeding should be tested for H. pylori and treated for it if the
      infection is found. Third, for patients who are about to start NSAIDs,
      screen-and-treat H. pylori has the potential of reducing the ulcer risk at an
      affordable incremental cost. It might be argued that any interaction between H.
      pylori and NSAIDs would become irrelevant in the era of COX-2-selective NSAIDs.
      Even among patients who are receiving a COX-2-selective NSAID, however, a
      large-scale study showed that the ulcer risk is significantly higher in H.
      pylori-positive patients than in uninfected patients. This finding suggests that 
      the relative importance of H. pylori in ulcer development might increase with a
      reduced toxicity of COX-2-selective NSAIDs. With an increasing use of low-dose
      aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis, the problem of aspirin-related ulcer
      disease is expected to rise. Given the significant role of H. pylori in the
      latter condition, screen-and-treat H. pylori might be a useful strategy for the
      prevention of ulcer complications in high-risk patients receiving low-dose
      aspirin in the future.

TI  - Regular-dose versus high-dose omeprazole in peptic ulcer bleeding: a prospective 
      randomized double-blind study.
PG  - 1332-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that profound acid inhibition along with
      endoscopic therapy might prevent rebleeding and reduce mortality in patients with
      peptic ulcer bleeding. The aim of the study was to test the possible equivalence 
      of a high dose and the regular dose of omeprazole in peptic ulcer bleeding.
      METHODS: We performed a prospective randomized double-blind study involving 142
      patients with acute peptic ulcer bleeding (Forrest classification I-II: spurting 
      or oozing bleeding, non-bleeding visible vessel, clot and black base).
      One-hundred-and-two (71.8%) patients received endoscopic treatment (adrenaline
      injection and/or heater probe) in pre-entry. Patients were randomly assigned to
      receive the regular dose of omeprazole intravenously (20 mg once a day for 3
      days, i.e. 60 mg/72 h) or a high dose of omeprazole (80 mg bolus + 8 mg/h for 3
      days, i.e. 652 mg/72 h). Rebleeding, surgery and death were the outcome measures.
      RESULTS: Six (8.2%) of the 73 patients receiving the regular dose of omeprazole
      and 8 (11.6%) of the 69 patients receiving the high dose of omeprazole rebled (P 
      = 0.002 for equivalence, equivalence limit 0.15). Three (4.1%) of the former
      patients and 5 (7.2%) of the latter group underwent surgery. Four (5.5%) patients
      in the regular-dose and 2 (2.9%) in the high-dose group died within 30 days.
      CONCLUSION: Under the defined tolerance limits, the regular dose of omeprazole is
      as successful as a high dose in preventing peptic ulcer rebleeding.

TI  - Comparison of diagnostic methods for Helicobacter pylori infection in patients
      with upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
PG  - 1254-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accuracy of the most frequently used tests for diagnosing
      Helicobacter pylori infection in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding of
      peptic origin is determined. METHODS: Seventy-eight patients with
      endoscopically-proven upper gastrointestinal bleeding of peptic origin were
      included. The presence of H. pylori was considered when observed from the
      histology or, if negative, when serology and breath test were both positive.
      Accuracy of the rapid urease test was estimated in accordance with results
      obtained with other diagnostic methods. RESULTS: Lesions causing gastrointestinal
      bleeding were 56 duodenal ulcers, 13 gastric ulcers, 7 pyloric channel ulcers, 13
      acute lesions of the gastric mucosa and 16 erosive duodenitis. H. pylori
      infection was present in 68 patients (87.2%). Forty-four patients had received
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The sensitivity/specificity (%) of the
      diagnostic methods was 48.5/100 for the rapid urease test, 91/77.8 for the breath
      test, 89.5/80 for serology and 86.3/100 for histology. The prior consumption of
      proton-pump inhibitors and antibiotics induced false-negative results in the
      rapid urease test and breath test, with no effect on serology and histology.
      CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of H. pylori infection in patients with upper
      gastrointestinal bleeding from peptic lesions is high. Sensitivity of the rapid
      urease test for diagnosing H. pylori is low in this setting. Cases with negative 
      rapid urease test need the combination of two or more additional tests if
      diagnosis is to be achieved. Cases with positive rapid urease test do not need
      further investigation for diagnosis.

TI  - One week of treatment with esomeprazole-based triple therapy eradicates
      Helicobacter pylori and heals patients with duodenal ulcer disease.
PG  - 1457-65
AB  - BACKGROUND: Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) monotherapy is commonly continued for 3
      weeks after Helicobacter pylori eradication with PPI-based triple therapy
      regimens to ensure duodenal ulcer (DU) healing. This randomized, double-blind,
      multicentre study evaluated whether only 1 week of triple therapy with the new
      PPI esomeprazole was sufficient to ensure high rates of ulcer healing and H.
      pylori eradication. METHODS: A total of 446 H. pylori-positive patients with
      active DU received twice daily treatment with esomeprazole 20 mg (n = 222) or
      omeprazole 20 mg (n = 224) in combination with amoxicillin 1 g and clarithromycin
      500 mg for 1 week (EAC and OAC, respectively). Patients in the OAC group then
      received 3 weeks' monotherapy with omeprazole 20 mg once daily; those treated
      with EAC received placebo. Ulcer healing was assessed by endoscopy on completion 
      of therapy and H. pylori status was assessed by (13)C-urea breath testing and
      histology 4-6 weeks later. RESULTS: Ulcer healing rates (95% CI) for
      intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations were: EAC + placebo 91% (87-95%) 
      and 94% (90-97%); OAC + omeprazole 92% (88-95%) and 96% (92-98%). Corresponding
      H. pylori eradication rates were: EAC + placebo 86% (81-90%) and 89% (84-93%);
      OAC + omeprazole 88% (83-92%) and 90% (85-93%). Both eradication regimens were
      well tolerated, and patient compliance was high. CONCLUSIONS: A 1-week regimen of
      esomeprazole-based triple therapy is sufficient for DU healing and H. pylori
      eradication in patients with DU disease.

TI  - Pseudomembranous esophagitis.
PG  - 730-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known of pseudomembranous esophagitis, a condition of
      striking endoscopic appearance. Presented here is a description of its nature and
      outcome. METHOD: Information on all patients with upper GI disease seen in our
      unit are held in a computerized database that includes presentation, diagnosis
      (including pseudomembranous esophagitis), treatment, and outcome. RESULTS:
      Forty-eight patients (mean age 70 years) with pseudomembranous esophagitis were
      seen over 15 years; 42 were in-patients with various illnesses. At endoscopy, a
      thin, concentric membrane and/or thick slough covered the distal half and
      occasionally the entire esophagus. This layer, yellow or blackened, could be
      peeled away to reveal underlying friable esophageal submucosa. The membrane was
      composed of fibrinous exudate and inflammatory cells; there was no basement
      membrane, hence the term pseudomembrane. Patients were treated with histamine H2 
      receptor antagonists or proton pump inhibitors for about 3 months and followed by
      endoscopy or clinical observation. All became asymptomatic; the pseudomembrane
      had disappeared in 32 who underwent follow-up endoscopy. It recurred in 3 of 38
      being followed (mean 3.2 years), again associated with another illness requiring 
      hospitalization. The long-term outcome was poor, determined by age and general
      condition and independent of pseudomembranous esophagitis. Seven patients died
      within 3 months and 17 during follow-up (mean 42 months, range 5-140 months).
      CONCLUSION: Pseudomembranous esophagitis is an unusual condition of unknown
      cause, probably under-reported and associated with systemic illness. It heals
      rapidly and recurrence is uncommon.

TI  - Comparing lansoprazole and omeprazole in onset of heartburn relief: results of a 
      randomized, controlled trial in erosive esophagitis patients.
PG  - 3089-98
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This randomized, double-blind, multicenter study was conducted to
      confirm a previous finding that lansoprazole relieves heartburn faster than
      omeprazole in patients with erosive esophagitis. METHODS: A total of 3510
      patients with erosive esophagitis and at least one episode of moderate to very
      severe daytime and/or nighttime heartburn during the 3 days immediately before
      the screening visit were randomized to lansoprazole 30 mg once daily or
      omeprazole 20 mg once daily for 8 wk. Patients recorded the presence and severity
      of daytime and nighttime heartburn in daily diaries. On treatment days 1-4,
      patients were telephoned to confirm the completion of their daily diary. The
      primary efficacy parameters were the percentage of heartburn-free days and
      heartburn-free nights, as well as the average severity of daytime and nighttime
      heartburn. RESULTS: During treatment day I and all evaluation time points
      including the entire 8-wk treatment period, significantly (p < 0.05) higher
      percentages of patients treated with lansoprazole than those treated with
      omeprazole did not experience a single episode of heartburn. Onset of heartburn
      relief was more rapid in lansoprazole-treated versus omeprazole-treated patients:
      on day 1, 33% versus 25% of lansoprazole- versus omeprazole-treated patients were
      heartburn-free. The percentages of heartburn-free days and heartburn-free nights 
      were also significantly (p < 0.01) greater for patients treated with lansoprazole
      at all evaluation time points. Heartburn severity was significantly less among
      those treated with lansoprazole compared with omeprazole. Both treatments were
      safe and well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Over 8 wk, lansoprazole 30 mg once daily
      relieved heartburn symptoms faster and more effectively than omeprazole 20 mg
      once daily in patients with erosive esophagitis.

PG  - 545-51
AB  - Reliable data regarding the efficacy of different schemes of triple therapy for
      the eradication of Helicobacter pylori in our country, are not available.
      Patients with Helicobacter pylori infection and non-ulcer dyspepsia or active
      peptic ulcer disease were randomized in three different groups for therapy with, 
      omeprazole 20 mg, clarithromycin 500 mg and amoxicillin 1000 mg, twice daily for 
      one week (OCA 1, 40 patients) and the same treatment but for two weeks in a
      second group (OCA 2, 40 patients). The third group received omeprazole 20 mg,
      clarithromycin 500 mg and metronidazole 500 mg twice daily during one week (OCM, 
      40 patients). The primary efficacy end point was the eradication of Helicobacter 
      pylori as confirmed by negative urea breath test, 4 weeks after the completion of
      treatment. Of 120 patients enrolled in the study, 113 met the entry criteria. Of 
      them, 103 completed the treatment. When analyzed by intention to treat, after 4
      weeks of finishing the treatment, Helicobacter pylori was eradicated in 92.3% of 
      patients in OCA 1, 89.7% in OCA 2, and 82.8% in OCM. There was no significant
      difference between the three groups, regarding the eradication efficacy. Side
      effects were observed more frequently in OCA 2 and OCM groups. Primary resistance
      to amoxicillin and clarithromycin was not demonstrated, while 20% of cultured
      strains were resistant to metronidazole. In patients with peptic ulcer disease or
      non-ulcer dysplasia, triple therapy with omeprazole and two antibiotics is highly
      effective in the eradication of Helicobacter pylori. One week of OCA therapy is
      as effective as two weeks of OCA or one week of OCM, with less side effects.

TI  - Quantitative assessment of gastric corpus atrophy in subjects using omeprazole: a
      randomized follow-up study.
PG  - 2882-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Atrophy of the gastric mucosa most frequently results from chronic
      Helicobacter pylori infection and is a risk factor for the development of gastric
      cancer. Profound acid suppression has been suggested to accelerate the onset of
      gastric mucosal atrophy. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects
      of H. pylori eradication and acid inhibition by omeprazole on gastric atrophy by 
      means of quantitative analysis of tissue morphology. METHODS: Corpus biopsy
      specimens were obtained during endoscopy in 71 gastroesophageal reflux disease
      (GERD) patients at baseline and after 3 and 12 months. A total of 48 subjects
      were H. pylori positive and 23 were H. pylori negative. All subjects received
      omeprazole 40 mg once daily after the first endoscopy for 12 months. After
      randomization, 27 of the 48 H. pylori-positive patients also received eradication
      therapy. In hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides the volume percentages of glands
      (VPGL), volume percentages of stroma (VPS), and volume percentages of infiltrate 
      (VPI) were measured in the glandular zone of the mucosa. The results were
      evaluated by computerized morphometric analysis. RESULTS: In the eradication
      group, the mean VPGL increased from 63.0% to 67.7% and 71.5% after 3 and 12
      months (p < 0.001), respectively. The mean VPS and VPI decreased from 33.1% and
      4.0% to 29.3% and 3.0% and to 26.4% and 2.1% (p < 0.001 and p = 0.04),
      respectively. Patients with the lowest VPGL at baseline showed the largest
      increases of VPGL after eradication treatment as compared to patients with high a
      VPGL at baseline. In the H. pylori-persistent group the VPI showed a significant 
      increase (p = 0.01), and in the H. pylori-negative group VPGL increased
      significantly from 71.9% to 75.2% (p = 0.03) after 12 months. CONCLUSIONS:
      Eradication of H. pylori leads to restitution of the volume percentage of
      glandular epithelium to normal levels, even during treatment with proton pump
      inhibitors. Whether this effect can also be seen in patients with marked atrophy 
      needs further investigation.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy is more effective in peptic ulcer than in
      non-ulcer dyspepsia.
PG  - 1303-7
AB  - AIM: To evaluate whether eradication therapy is more effective in peptic ulcer
      disease (PUD) than in non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD). METHODS: We retrospectively
      studied 481 patients with NUD (183 patients) or PUD (298 patients) infected with 
      Helicobacter pylori included in several prospective clinical trials. Three
      eradication regimens were given: (1) proton pump inhibitor (PPI) plus
      clarithromycin, plus either amoxycillin or metronidazole for 7 days (297
      patients); (2) ranitidine bismuth citrate (RBC) plus clarithromycin plus
      amoxycillin for 7 days (79 patients); and (3) RBC plus clarithromycin plus
      amoxycillin plus metronidazole for 5 days (105 patients). H. pylori eradication
      was defined as a negative 13C-urea breath test 4 weeks after completing
      treatment. RESULTS: H. pylori eradication rates were 82% (95% CI 78-87%) with PPI
      plus two antibiotics for 7 days, 85% (95% CI 75-91%) with RBC plus two
      antibiotics for 7 days, and 91% (95% CI 86-97%) with RBC plus three antibiotics
      for 5 days (P < 0.05 compared with the first regimen). Overall, the H. pylori
      eradication rate in patients with NUD was 78% (95% CI 71-84%), while in patients 
      with PUD it was 89% (95% CI 86-93%) (P < 0.001). Both the combination of PPI plus
      two antibiotics for 7 days and the combination of RBC plus three antibiotics for 
      5 days were more effective in PUD than in NUD patients. However, RBC plus
      clarithromycin plus amoxycillin for 7 days was equally effective in both
      diseases. RBC plus two antibiotics for 7 days achieved better results than the
      same therapy with PPI only in NUD patients (84% v. 59%, P < 0.01), but both
      regimens were similar when prescribed in PUD patients (86% v. 88%). In the
      multivariate analysis, the type of therapy, the diagnosis (NUD v. PUD), and the
      product variable of therapy (with RBC plus 2 antibiotics for 7 days) and
      diagnosis (interaction variable) were the only variables that influenced H.
      pylori eradication. The odds ratio (OR) for the effect of RBC versus PPI plus two
      antibiotics for 7 days in patients with NUD was 4 (95% CI 1.7-9.7; P < 0.01),
      whereas in patients with PUD no statistical significance was achieved (OR 0.79;
      95% CI 0.2-3.9). CONCLUSION: Overall, H. pylori eradication therapy is more
      effective in PUD than in NUD patients. This advantage of eradication therapies in
      PUD patients seems to be observed with 7-day PPI-based triple regimens, and with 
      5-day RBC-based quadruple therapy, while the 7-day RBC-based triple regimen seems
      to be equally effective in both diseases.

TI  - Three-day lansoprazole quadruple therapy for Helicobacter pylori-positive
      duodenal ulcers: a randomized controlled study.
PG  - 843-9
AB  - AIM: To compare the efficacy and tolerability of a 3-day quadruple therapy with a
      standard 7-day triple therapy in eradicating Helicobacter pylori infection and
      healing duodenal ulcers. METHODS: Patients with H. pylori-positive duodenal
      ulcers were randomized to receive either lansoprazole 30 mg, clarithromycin 500
      mg, and metronidazole 400 mg twice daily for 7 days (LCM-7) or lansoprazole 30
      mg, clarithromycin 500 mg, metronidazole 400 mg, and bismuth subcitrate 240 mg
      twice daily for 3 days (LCMB-3). No pre- or post-treatment acid suppression was
      used. Follow-up endoscopy was performed at week 6. RESULTS: A total of 118
      patients were recruited. Sixty patients in the LCM-7 group and 53 patients in the
      LCMB-3 group returned for endoscopy. Intention-to-treat eradication rates were
      87% and 86% (P=0.94) and per protocol eradication rates were 87% and 94% (P=0.29)
      in the LCM-7 and LCMB-3 groups, respectively. Per protocol and intention-to-treat
      ulcer healing rates were 98% and 98% in LCM-7 and 100% and 91% in LCMB-3,
      respectively. There were no significant differences in efficacy in relation to
      the initial metronidazole and clarithromycin susceptibility. Significant
      reduction in the duration of side-effects was found in the LCMB-3 group.
      CONCLUSION: The 3-day quadruple therapy is highly effective, better tolerated and
      can be considered as a first-line therapy in duodenal ulcer management.

TI  - A multicenter, double-blind study on triple therapy with lansoprazole,
      amoxicillin and clarithromycin for eradication of Helicobacter pylori in Japanese
      peptic ulcer patients.
PG  - 254-61
AB  - BACKGROUND: Two triple therapies with lansoprazole (LPZ)/amoxicillin
      (AMPC)/clarithromycin (CAM) for eradication of Helicobacter pylori were studied
      in multicenter, double-blind fashion to evaluate the eradication rate of H.
      pylori and safety of eradiation treatment in Japanese patients with H.
      pylori-positive active gastric ulcers or duodenal ulcers. METHODS: Patients were 
      randomly chosen for the control treatment of LPZ 30 mg twice a day (b.i.d.; Group
      A-LPZ-only) or the test treatments of LPZ 30 mg plus AMPC 750 mg and CAM 200 mg
      b.i.d. (Group B-LAC200) and LPZ 30 mg, AMPC 750 mg and CAM 400 mg b.i.d. (Group
      C-LAC400). All eradication treatments lasted for a period of 7 days. Successful
      eradication was assessed by culture and gastric histology 1 month after
      completion of the ulcer treatment. RESULTS: The eradication rates of H. pylori in
      the full analysis set were 0% in Group A-LPZ-only, 87.5% in Group B-LAC200 and
      89.2% in Group C-LAC400 for gastric ulcer and, 4.4% in Group A-LPZ-only, 91.1% in
      Group B-LAC200 and 83.7% in Group C-LAC400 for duodenal ulcer. The eradication
      rates of Group B-LAC200 and Group C-LAC400 were 89.2% (95% CI: 84.8-93.7%) and
      86.4% (95%CI: 81.5-91.3%) in total in the full analysis set, 89% (95% CI:
      84.3-93.7%) and 85.3% (95%CI: 80.1-90.5%) in the per protocol set. The
      eradication rates in Groups B-LAC200 and group C-LAC400 were statistically
      significantly higher than the rate in Group A-LPZ-only for both gastric ulcer and
      duodenal ulcer patients (p <.0001 for both). CONCLUSION: A satisfactorily high H.
      pylori eradication rate was obtained in Japanese ulcer patients with the triple
      therapy regimen consisting of LPZ 30 mg, AMPC 750 mg, and CAM 200 mg b.i.d.

TI  - A pilot study to determine the effectiveness of garlic oil capsules in the
      treatment of dyspeptic patients with Helicobacter pylori.
PG  - 249-53
AB  - BACKGROUND: Resistance of Helicobacter pylori to clarithromycin and metronidazole
      is now found worldwide. Steam-distilled garlic oil has in vitro activity against 
      H. pylori and may be a useful alternative treatment strategy. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: In this pilot study dyspeptic patients with positive serology for H.
      pylori confirmed by 13C urea breath test (UBT), at 0 and 2 weeks, were enrolled. 
      Treatment consisted of one 4 mg garlic oil capsule with a meal four times per day
      for 14 days. H. pylori eradication was defined as a negative UBT at both
      follow-up appointments. Suppression was defined as a 50% fall in 13C excess
      between baseline and follow-up 1. RESULTS: Five patients completed the study.
      There was no evidence of either eradication or suppression of H. pylori or
      symptom improvement whilst taking garlic oil. CONCLUSION: These negative results 
      show that, within the gastric milieu, garlic oil at this dose does not inhibit H.
      pylori. A higher dose administered for a longer time-period may be effective.
      Antibiotics are usually combined with a proton-pump inhibitor or bismuth salt, as
      the only antibiotic with any in vivo activity against H. pylori in monotherapy is
      clarithromycin. A proton pump inhibitor raises gastric pH and, by increasing
      bacterial division, may increase the in vivo activity of garlic oil. This may be 
      worth pursuing in a future trial.

TI  - Long-term lansoprazole treatment for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease: clinical 
      efficacy and influence on gastric mucosa.
PG  - 1819-26
AB  - BACKGROUND: Long-term acid suppression is believed to accelerate atrophic
      gastritis in Helicobacter pylori-positive patients. The influence of long-term
      therapy with lansoprazole has not been examined. AIM: To study the clinical and
      endoscopic efficacy and histological evolution of gastric mucosa during 5 years
      of maintenance treatment with lansoprazole, 30 mg. METHODS: Seventy-eight
      patients with endoscopically proven oesophagitis were followed for 5 years.
      Biopsies taken at the start of the study, during follow-up and after 5 years were
      available for 73 patients. RESULTS: The total endoscopic relapse rate was 14.1%. 
      At the start of the study, 34 patients were Helicobacter pylori negative and 39
      were Helicobacter pylori positive (two atrophy, 25 antral gastritis, 12
      pangastritis). At 5 years, no histological changes had occurred in Helicobacter
      pylori-negative patients. In the Helicobacter pylori-positive group, 20 patients 
      developed pangastritis, six had normal histology and one had antral gastritis.
      Ten of the 12 patients with pangastritis had reduced antral activity. There was
      no increase in intestinal metaplasia, but there was a tendency towards regression
      of atrophy in the antrum and towards increased atrophy in the body of the
      stomach. CONCLUSIONS: Maintenance treatment with lansoprazole, 30 mg, is
      efficacious. The development of glandular atrophy and intestinal metaplasia was
      not accelerated in Helicobacter pylori-positive patients. Helicobacter pylori
      eradication must be considered only because of the higher cancer risk associated 
      with chronic Helicobacter pylori-related gastritis.

TI  - Systematic review of proton pump inhibitors for the acute treatment of reflux
      oesophagitis.
PG  - 1729-36
AB  - BACKGROUND: Esomeprazole is a new proton pump inhibitor, which has been compared 
      to omeprazole for the treatment of reflux oesophagitis in clinical trials. AIM:
      To compare the effectiveness of esomeprazole with the recommended dose of proton 
      pump inhibitors in the healing of reflux oesophagitis, using omeprazole as a
      common comparator. METHODS: Systematic review of randomized controlled trials.
      Extraction and re-analysis of data to provide 'intention-to-treat' results.
      Meta-analysis using a Fixed Effects model. RESULTS: A meta-analysis of healing
      rates of esomeprazole 40 mg compared to omeprazole 20 mg gave the following
      results: at 4 weeks (relative risk 1.14; 95% CI: 1.10, 1.18) and 8 weeks (RR
      1.08; 95%CI: 1.05, 1.10). Other proton pump inhibitors compared to omeprazole 20 
      mg are as follows: lansoprazole 30 mg at 4 weeks (RR 1.02; 95%CI: 0.97, 1.08) and
      8 weeks (RR 1.01; 95%CI: 0.97, 1.06); pantoprazole 40 mg at 4 weeks (RR 0.99;
      95%CI: 0.91, 1.07) and 8 weeks (RR 0.98; 95%CI: 0.93, 1.04); rabeprazole 20 mg at
      4 weeks (RR 1.00; 95%CI: 0.87, 1.14) and 8 weeks (RR 0.98; 95%CI: 0.91, 1.05).
      CONCLUSIONS: Esomeprazole has demonstrated higher healing rates than omeprazole
      at 4 and 8 weeks. Other proton pump inhibitors (lansoprazole, pantoprazole and
      rabeprazole) have not shown higher healing rates when compared with omeprazole.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori eradication does not exacerbate reflux symptoms in
      gastroesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 1120-6
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Observational studies have suggested that Helicobacter pylori 
      may protect against gastrointestinal reflux disease (GERD), but these results
      could be due to bias or confounding factors. We addressed this in a prospective, 
      double blind, randomized, controlled trial. METHODS: H. pylori-positive patients 
      with at least a 1-year history of heartburn with a normal endoscopy or grade A
      esophagitis were recruited. Patients were randomized to 20 mg omeprazole, 250 mg 
      clarithromycin, and 500 mg tinidazole twice a day for 1 week or 20 mg omeprazole 
      twice a day and identical placebos. A second concurrently recruited control group
      of H. pylori-negative patients were given open label 20 mg omeprazole twice a day
      for 1 week. All patients received 20 mg omeprazole twice a day for the following 
      3 weeks and 20 mg omeprazole once daily for a further 4 weeks. Omeprazole was
      discontinued at 8 weeks and patients were followed up for a further 10 months. A 
      relapse was defined as moderate or severe reflux symptoms. H. pylori eradication 
      was determined by 13C-urea breath test. RESULTS: The H. pylori-positive cases
      were randomized to antibiotics (n = 93) or placebo (n = 97). Relapse of GERD
      occurred in 83% of each of the antibiotic, placebo, and H. pylori-negative groups
      during the 12-month study period. Life tables revealed no statistical difference 
      between the 2 H. pylori-positive groups (log rank test, P = 0.84) or between the 
      3 groups (log rank test, P = 0.94) in the time to first relapse. Two patients in 
      each group developed grade B esophagitis at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: H. pylori
      eradication therapy does not seem to influence relapse rates in GERD patients.

TI  - Randomized trial of a quadruple-drug regimen and a triple-drug regimen for
      eradication of Helicobacter pylori: long-term follow-up study.
PG  - 191-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: In developing countries, H. pylori eradication rates are suboptimal. 
      A quadruple-drug regimen may improve on the eradication rate achieved with
      triple-drug regimen. METHODS: 64 consecutive patients with active duodenal ulcer 
      associated with H. pylori infection were randomized to receive either a one-week 
      triple-drug regimen (lansoprazole, clarithromycin, secnidazole) or a one-week
      quadruple-drug regimen (lansoprazole, amoxycillin, colloidal bismuth subcitrate, 
      secnidazole). H. pylori eradication and ulcer healing were assessed 4 weeks after
      completion of therapy. Patients were followed up at 24 weeks and 52 weeks for H. 
      pylori recurrence. RESULTS: Both the regimens eradicated H. pylori in 75% (95% CI
      0.6-0.9) of patients. The ulcer-healing rate with the triple-drug regimen was 97%
      (95% CI 0.91-1.0) and 91% (95% CI 0.91-1.0) with the quadruple-drug regimen. No
      ulcer or H. pylori recurrence occurred in patients eradicated with the
      triple-drug regimen, whereas 8.3% of patients eradicated with the quadruple-drug 
      regimen had ulcer as well as H. pylori recurrence during the 52-week follow up.
      CONCLUSION: Triple-drug regimen achieves similar eradication rates as
      quadruple-drug regimen in H. pylori infection.

TI  - Gastroesophageal reflux in the patients with asthma.
PG  - 123-8
AB  - Thirty one patients with asthma (mean age was 44.4 10.7; range 18-63) were
      investigated for gastroesophageal reflux (GER). The patients were separated into 
      two groups according to presence of reflux and/or nocturnal symptoms. 13 patients
      had one of the reflux and/or nocturnal asthma symptoms (Group 1), whereas 18
      patients had none of them (Group 2). To assess GER patients underwent to
      scintigraphy with Tc99m. GER was determined 4 of 13 patients in group 1 (30,7 %) 
      and 1 of 18 patients in group 2 (5,5 %). There was significant difference between
      the group 1 and group 2 in that respect (p < 0,001). The patients with
      established GER (5 patients) were given Omeprazole (a proton pomp inhibitor) 40
      mg daily for 4 weeks following a 2 week placebo period. The patients recorded
      their daily and nocturnal symptoms of asthma, additional salbutamol use, morning 
      and evening peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR) measurements in a daily chart
      during placebo and omeprazole treatment without changing their antiasthma
      treatment. Their PEFR, FEV1 values, daily and nocturnal symptoms and additional
      beta agonist use did not changed after omeprazole treatment except one. But their
      reflux symptoms (heartburn and regurgitation) were improved. As a consequence, we
      suggested that asthmatics which have some complaints of reflux should be searched
      for GER. Not the respiratory functions but GER symptoms can be improved w

TI  - Efficacy of a nitroimidazole containing tripletherapy regime in Singapore.
PG  - 317-21
AB  - BACKGROUND: There has been a gradual increase in the proportion of Singapore
      patients with metronidazole resistant strains of Helicobacter pylori. We studied 
      the efficacy of a nitroimidazole containing regime in eradicating H. pylori.
      METHODS: Consecutive treatment naive patients with peptic ulcer disease and
      culture proven H. pylori were recruited. From each patient, two antral biopsies
      were taken for rapid urease test and two for histology. Two biopsies each from
      the gastric antrum and corpus were taken for H. pylori culture. Antibiotic
      sensitivity to amoxycillin, metronidazole, clarithromycin and tetracycline were
      tested using the disc diffusion method. Patients were treated with lansoprazole
      30 mg bd, tinidazole 500 mg bd and clarithromycin 500 mg bd for seven days.
      Successful eradication was defined as either negative urea breath tests 4 and 12 
      weeks after treatment, or negative histology and culture at least four weeks
      after the end of treatment. RESULTS: A total of 64 patients were culture positive
      (51 males, 13 females). Forty-two patients had duodenal ulcers (DU), 17 gastric
      ulcers (GU), and 5 DU and GU. Metronidazole resistance was detected in 16
      patients (25%). Three of the 16 patients (19%) had a mixed population of
      resistant and sensitive strains of H. pylori. None of the H. pylori isolates were
      resistant to amoxycillin, tetracycline or clarithromycin. Overall, eradication
      was achieved in 51/64 patients (80%). Eradication rate was 88% (42/48) among
      those with metronidazole sensitive strains, and 56% (9/16) among those with
      metronidazole resistant strains (p < 0.02). CONCLUSION: A high proportion of our 
      patients with metronidazole resistant strains of H. pylori failed eradication
      therapy when a nitroimidazole containing regime was used. It may not be
      appropriate to use a nitroimidazole containing without prior knowledge of the
      antibiotic sensitivity pattern of the H. pylori isolate.

TI  - Cost effectiveness in Canada of a multidrug prepackaged regimen (Hp-PAC)+ for
      Helicobacter pylori eradication.
PG  - 831-43
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness of a multidrug prepackaged regimen
      for Helicobacter pylori, the Hp-PAC (lansoprazole 30mg, clarithromycin 500 mg,
      amoxicillin 1 g, all twice daily), relative to alternative pharmacological
      strategies in the management of confirmed duodenal ulcer over a 1-year period
      from 2 perspectives: (i) a strict healthcare payer perspective (Ontario Ministry 
      of Health) excluding the patient copayment; and (ii) a healthcare payer
      perspective including the patient copayment. DESIGN: A decision-analytical model 
      was developed to estimate expected per patient costs [1998 Canadian dollars ($
      Can)], weeks without ulcer and symptomatic ulcer recurrences for the Hp-PAC
      compared with: proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-clarithromycin-amoxicillin (PPI-CA),
      PPI-clarithromycin-metronidazole (PPI-CM), PPI-amoxicillin-metronidazole (PPI-AM)
      and ranitidine-bismuthmetronidazole-tetracycline (RAN-BMT). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
      AND RESULTS: All PPI-based regimens had higher expected costs but better outcomes
      relative to RAN-BMT. From a strict healthcare payer perspective, PPI-CM ($Can
      209) yielded lower expected costs than PPI-CA ($Can 221) and slightly lower costs
      than Hp-PAC ($Can 211). However, these 3 regimens all shared identical outcomes
      (51.2 weeks without ulcer). When the current Ontario, Canada, $Can 2 patient
      copayment was added to the dispensing fee, Hp-PAC yielded lower costs ($Can 214) 
      than PPI-CM ($Can 216). CONCLUSION: From a strict healthcare payer perspective,
      Hp-PAC is weakly dominated by PPI-CM with an incremental cost effectiveness
      (relative to RAN-BMT) of $Can 5.77 per ulcer week averted. When the patient
      copayment is added to this perspective, Hp-PAC weakly dominates PPI-CM ($Can 5
      per ulcer week averted). Regardless of perspective, Hp-PAC and PPI-CM differed by
      only $Can 2 per patient over 1 year and the expected time without ulcer was 51.2 
      weeks for both. More data on the clinical and statistical differences in H.
      pylori eradication with Hp-PAC and PPI-CM would be useful. This analysis does not
      in clude the possible advantage of Hp-PAC in terms of compliance and
      antibacterial resistance.

TI  - Serum chromogranin A as a screening test for gastric enterochromaffin-like cell
      hyperplasia during acid-suppressive therapy.
PG  - 802-11
AB  - BACKGROUND: Serum chromogranin A (CgA), a marker of neuroendocrine neoplasia,
      increases during profound gastric acid inhibition, possibly reflecting the
      trophic effect of gastrin on the enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells. AIMS: This
      study investigated the clinical value of serum CgA as a screening test for
      gastric fundic enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell hyperplasia during
      acid-suppressive therapy. METHOD: A consecutive series of 230 dyspeptic patients 
      referred for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was investigated in a
      cross-sectional design. They were 154 patients on continuous medium-term (6 weeks
      to one year) or long-term (longer than one year) acid inhibition with either
      proton pump inhibitors (PPIs, n = 117) or histamine2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs,
      n = 37) for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, and 76 nontreated subjects, with
      normal endoscopic findings (control group). Fasting blood samples were analysed
      for gastrin and CgA. Gastric biopsy specimens (oxyntic mucosa) were examined for 
      histological evaluation of gastritis (Sydney classification) and of ECL cell
      hyperplasia (Solcia classification). RESULTS: Serum CgA levels correlated
      positively with serum gastrin, following a quadratic function (r = 0.78, P <
      0.0001). Elevated serum CgA values during long-term acid inhibition correlated
      with the presence and severity of fundic ECL cell hyperplasia. Multivariate
      analysis identified hypergastrinaemia (P < 0.0001), duration of acid inhibition
      (P < 0.0001), H. pylori infection (P = 0.008), ECL cell hyperplasia (P = 0.012), 
      and body gland atrophy (P = 0.043) as independent predictors of elevated serum
      CgA. In subjects on long-term acid inhibition (n = 123), serum CgA was equally
      sensitive but more specific than serum gastrin for the detection of ECL cell
      hyperplasia (sensitivity, 91.3% for both; specificity, 73% vs. 43%, P < 0.0001). 
      CONCLUSIONS: During long-term gastric acid inhibition, serum CgA levels reflect
      the presence and severity of fundic ECL cell hyperplasia. Serum CgA is therefore 
      a useful screening test for gastric ECL cell proliferative changes within this
      context.

      well defined. GOALS: To examine demographic and clinical variables predictive of 
      BE before endoscopy. STUDY: A validated GERD questionnaire was administered to
      107 patients with biopsy-proven BE and to 104 patients with GERD but no BE shown 
      by endoscopy. Frequent symptoms were defined as symptoms that occurred at least
      once or more each week. Severity of symptoms was rated on a scale from 1 to 4
      (mild to very severe). Univariate analysis and multivariable logistic regression 
      were performed to determine whether demographic characteristics and the duration,
      severity, and frequency of GERD symptoms were associated with the identification 
      of BE. RESULTS: Eighty-five percent of the GERD patients and 82% of the BE
      patients completed the questionnaire. There was no difference between the groups 
      in terms of race, gender, or proton pump inhibitor use. The BE patients were
      older (median age, 64 vs. 57 years, p = 0.04). In multivariable logistic
      regression, an age of more than 40 years ( p = 0.008), the presence of heartburn 
      or acid regurgitation ( p = 0.03), and heartburn more than once a week ( p =
      0.007) were all independent predictors of the presence of BE. Interestingly,
      patients with BE were less likely to report severe GERD symptoms ( p = 0.0008)
      and nocturnal symptoms ( p = 0.03). Duration of symptoms, race, alcohol, and
      smoking history were not associated with BE. CONCLUSIONS: Upper endoscopy should 
      be performed in GERD patients more than 40 years of age who report heartburn once
      or more per week. The severity of symptoms and the presence of nocturnal symptoms
      are not reliable indicators of the presence of BE.

PG  - 262-6
AB  - Over the past decade, medical and surgical approaches to the patient with
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) have improved dramatically. Proton pump
      inhibitors have become the dominant medical therapy because of their high
      efficacy and safety. Laparoscopic surgical approaches have improved concomitantly
      with the advances in medical therapy, resulting in the perception that either
      continuous medical therapy or surgery are appropriate options for long-term
      maintenance of this chronic disorder. Recent approval of new endoscopic
      treatments for GERD has generated considerable interest, but acceptance of these 
      techniques should be limited by the small number of patients studied to date, the
      lack of placebo controls, and the short duration of follow-up.

TI  - Intravenous omeprazole in critically ill patients: a randomized, crossover study 
      comparing 40 with 80 mg plus 8 mg/hour on intragastric pH.
PG  - 1931-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare intravenous omeprazole 40-mg single dose with 8 mg/hr after
      an 80-mg bolus injection on 24-hr intragastric pH in intensive care unit (ICU)
      ventilated patients. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized crossover study. SETTING: A 
      42-bed medicosurgical ICU in a university hospital PATIENTS: Medicosurgical
      ventilated patients at risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. INTERVENTIONS: After
      baseline determination of intragastric pH, patients were randomly allocated to
      have a 40-mg iv omeprazole bolus injection (arm I) or 80 mg bolus, followed by 8 
      mg/hr continuous infusion for 24 hrs (arm II). After a 24-hr washout period, the 
      opposite regimen was given in a crossover design. Intragastric pH was determined 
      at regular intervals during the treatment period. RESULTS: In ten patients
      completing the protocol, the intragastric pH was similar for the two regimens for
      the first 12 hrs. The area under the pH curve was 5.51 +/- 0.48 for arm I
      compared with 6.02 +/- 0.33 for arm II (NS). Time to reach a pH of 4 or 6 was not
      significantly different for the two regimens. Time spent with a pH greater than 4
      and 6 for the first 12 hrs was 10.11 +/- 1.14 and 8.31 +/- 1.16 hrs vs. 10.11 +/-
      0.75 and 7.43 +/- 1.19 hrs for arm I and arm II, respectively (NS). When the
      first 24 hrs are considered, the area under the pH curve was 5.17 +/- 0.49 for
      arm I vs. 6.36 +/- 0.25 for arm II (p <.05). Time spent with a pH greater than 4 
      and 6 was 17.2 +/- 2.4 hrs and 12.63 +/- 2.22 vs. 23 +/- 0.41 and 19.48 +/- 1.63 
      in arm I and arm II, respectively (p <.05 and.01). An intragastric pH above 6 for
      all determinations was only observed in arm II. CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill
      patients, intravenous omeprazole 40 mg single dose is as effective as 8 mg/hr
      after an 80-mg bolus injection on mean intragastric pH, time spent with a pH
      greater than 4 and 6, but only for the first 12 hrs. If an intragastric pH
      greater than 6 has to be maintained for 24 hrs in all patients, an 80-mg bolus
      followed by 8 mg/hr iv omeprazole is to be given. Our data suggest that in
      several critically ill patients, a single 40-mg iv omeprazole bolus injection may
      be able to achieve stress ulcer prophylaxis and that 40 mg twice daily should be 
      compared with 8 mg/hr after an 80-mg bolus injection in bleeding ulcers.

TI  - [Changes in ultra rapid urease test and histopathological examination for
      Helicobacter pylori by antisecretory drugs].
PG  - 3-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the major problems when evaluating dyspeptic patients at
      public hospitals is the large interval between the consultation and the
      endoscopy, leading to the prescription of antisecretory drugs, what can be
      responsible for false results on examinations. AIM: To evaluate changes in
      ultrarapid urease test and histopathological examination for Helicobacter pylori 
      by antisecretory drugs. METHODS: In a prospective double-blind study, 50 patients
      with dyspeptic complaints and endoscopic diagnosis of peptic ulcer, erosive
      gastritis, esophagitis or duodenitis with a positive urease test, were randomized
      to a 7-day course of treatment with either omeprazole 20 mg or ranitidine 300 mg 
      a day. Before and after treatment, two biopsy specimens each were obtained from
      the antrum and corpus and an ultrarapid urease test and a histopathological
      examination for Helicobacter pylori were performed. RESULTS: There were no
      significant changes in the results of ultrarapid urease test and
      histopathological examination for Helicobacter pylori after treatment with
      ranitidine. With omeprazole, we observed a decrease in positive results in
      ultrarapid urease test and histopathological examination for Helicobacter pylori 
      in the antrum, but not in the corpus. CONCLUSION: Omeprazole, used for 7 days can
      lead to negative results in ultrarapid urease test and histopathological
      examination for Helicobacter pylori in the antrum, and should not be employed in 
      patients before the endoscopy is performed.

TI  - Pharmacoeconomic issues of the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 1099-108
AB  - Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is one of the most common diagnoses in a
      gastroenterologist's practice. Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) describes the
      retrograde movement of gastric contents through the lower oesophageal sphincter
      (LES) to the oesophagus. GER can occur physiologically and may be accompanied by 
      symptoms. The introduction of endoscopes and ambulatory devices for continuous
      monitoring of oesophageal pH (24 h pH monitoring) has led to great improvement in
      the ability to diagnose reflux disease and reflux-associated complications. The
      development of pathological reflux and GERD can be attributed to many factors.
      Pathophysiology of GERD includes transient lower oesophageal sphincter
      relaxations (TLESRs), incompetent LES because of a decreased lower oesophageal
      sphincter pressure (LESP) and deficient or delayed oesophageal acid clearance.
      Uncomplicated GERD may be treated by modification of lifestyle and eating habits 
      in an early stage of GERD. The various agents currently used for treatment of
      GERD include mucoprotective substances, antacids, H2-blockers, prokinetics and
      proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Although these drugs are effective, they do not
      necessarily influence the underlying causes of the disease by improving the
      oesophageal clearance, increasing the LESP or reducing the frequency of TLESRs.
      The following article gives an overview regarding current concepts of the
      pathophysiology and pharmacological treatment of GERD stressing on
      pharmacoeconomic issues of the treatment and discusses the advantages and
      disadvantages for step-up and step-down therapy.

TI  - Bismuth-based quadruple therapy with bismuth subcitrate, metronidazole,
      tetracycline and omeprazole in the eradication of Helicobacter pylori.
PG  - 581-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: A previous study showed that 14 days of qid bismuth-based triple
      therapy with tetracycline 500 mg, metronidazole 250 mg and colloidal bismuth
      subcitrate 120 mg resulted in excellent Helicobacter pylori eradication rates
      (89.5%). The present study looked at a shorter treatment period by adding
      omeprazole and by reducing the dose of tetracycline. METHODS: One hundred
      sixty-one patients with H pylori confirmed by histology and (13)carbon urea
      breath test were included in the study. They were treated for seven days with
      bismuth subcitrate 120 mg plus metronidazole 250 mg plus tetracycline 250 mg qid 
      plus omeprazole 20 mg bid (OBMT). Patients were 18 to 75 years of age and had
      dyspepsia with or without a history of peptic ulcer. Patients with irritable
      bowel syndrome, active ulcer or previous attempt at eradication, or those who had
      used antibiotics or antiulcer drugs in the previous 30 days were excluded.
      Eradication was determined by two (13)carbon urea breath tests done one and three
      months, respectively, after treatment. Strains with minimal inhibitory
      concentrations of 8 microg/mL or higher were considered to be resistant to
      metronidazole. RESULTS: The overall per protocol eradication rate was 84%-89.5%
      in metronidazole-sensitive and 70.8% in metronidazole-resistant strains. Modified
      intent-to-treat analysis resulted in a 80% eradication rate--82.5% in
      metronidazole-sensitive and 66.7% in metronidazole-resistant strains. Only one
      patient discontinued treatment because of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: The OBMT
      regimen used in this study is safe and effective against metronidazole-sensitive 
      H pylori strains.

TI  - Omeprazole as adjuvant therapy to endoscopic combination injection sclerotherapy 
      for treating bleeding peptic ulcer.
PG  - 280-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Therapeutic endoscopy has provided a new means of treating bleeding
      peptic ulcers. Additional medical therapy may enhance the therapeutic benefit.
      Hemostasis is highly pH dependent and is severely impaired at low pH. Proton pump
      inhibitors, by achieving a significantly higher inhibition of gastric acidity,
      may improve the therapeutic outcomes after endoscopic treatment of ulcers.
      PATIENT AND METHODS: We enrolled 166 patients with hemorrhage from duodenal,
      gastric, or stomal ulcers and signs of recent hemorrhage, as confirmed by
      endoscopy. Twenty-six patients had ulcers with an arterial spurt, 41 patients had
      active ooze, 37 had a visible vessel, and 62 patients had an adherent clot. All
      patients received endoscopic injection sclerotherapy using 1:10,000 adrenaline
      and 1% polidocanol and were randomly assigned to receive omeprazole (40 mg
      orally) every 12 hours for 5 days or an identical-looking placebo. The outcome
      measures used were recurrent bleeding, surgery, blood transfusion, and hospital
      stay. RESULTS: Six (7%) of 82 patients in the omeprazole group had recurrent
      bleeding, as compared with 18 (21%) in the placebo group (P = 0.02). Two patients
      in the omeprazole group and 7 patients in the placebo group needed surgery to
      control their bleeding (P = 0.17). One patient in the omeprazole group and 2
      patients in the placebo group died (P = 0.98). Twenty-nine patients (35%) in the 
      omeprazole group and 61 patients (73%) in the placebo group received blood
      transfusions (P <0.001). The average hospital stay was 4.6 +/- 1.1 days in the
      omeprazole group and 6.0 +/- 0.7 days in the placebo group (P <0.001).
      CONCLUSION: The addition of oral omeprazole to combination injection
      sclerotherapy decreases the rate of recurrent bleeding, reduces the need for
      surgery and transfusion, and shortens the hospital stay for patients with
      stigmata of recent hemorrhage.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of esomeprazole, the S-isomer of
      omeprazole.
PG  - 1563-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Esomeprazole, the S-isomer of omeprazole, is the first proton pump
      inhibitor developed as a single isomer for the treatment of acid-related
      diseases. AIM: To examine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of
      esomeprazole. METHODS: In a crossover study, 12 healthy males received 5, 10 or
      20 mg of esomeprazole, or 20 mg of omeprazole, once daily over 5 days. The
      pharmacokinetics and effects on pentagastrin-stimulated peak acid output of
      esomeprazole and omeprazole were studied on days 1 and 5. RESULTS: The area under
      the curve (AUC) of both esomeprazole and omeprazole increased from day 1 to day
      5. The correlation between acid inhibition and AUC for esomeprazole could be well
      described with a sigmoid Emax model. The mean inhibition values of the
      pentagastrin-stimulated peak acid output on day 1 for 5, 10 and 20 mg of
      esomeprazole were 15%, 29% and 46%, respectively; the corresponding day 5 values 
      were 28%, 62% and 90%. The mean inhibition values of the pentagastrin-stimulated 
      peak acid output for omeprazole were 35% (day 1) to 79% (day 5). CONCLUSIONS: The
      pharmacokinetics of esomeprazole are time and dose dependent. There was a good
      correlation between AUC and effect for esomeprazole. These data suggest an
      increased acid inhibitory effect of esomeprazole compared to omeprazole.

TI  - The cost of long term therapy for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease: a randomised
      trial comparing omeprazole and open antireflux surgery.
PG  - 488-94
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: To comprehensively assess the relative merits of medical and 
      surgical therapy for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), health economic
      aspects have to be incorporated. We have studied the direct and indirect costs of
      medical and surgical therapy within the framework of a prospective randomised
      multicentre trial. METHODS: After initial treatment of reflux oesophagitis with
      omeprazole to control symptoms and to heal oesophagitis, 154 patients were
      randomised to continue treatment with omeprazole (20 or 40 mg daily) and 144
      patients to have an open antireflux operation (ARS). In case of GORD relapse,
      patients allocated to omeprazole were offered ARS and those initially operated on
      had either a reoperation or were treated with omeprazole. The costs were assessed
      over five years from randomisation. RESULTS: Differences in cumulative direct
      medical costs per patient between the two therapeutic strategies diminished with 
      time. However, five year direct medical costs per patient when given omeprazole
      were still significantly lower than for those having ARS in Denmark, Norway, and 
      Sweden (differences were DKK 8703 (US$1475), NOK 32 992 (US$ 5155), and SEK 13
      036 (US$ 1946), respectively). However, in Finland the reverse was true (the
      difference in favour of ARS amounted to FMK 7354 (US$ 1599)). When indirect costs
      (loss of production due to GORD related sick leave) were also included, the cost 
      of surgical treatment increased substantially and exceeded the cost of medical
      treatment in all countries. CONCLUSIONS: The total costs of medical therapy for
      chronic GORD were lower than those of open ARS when prospectively assessed over a
      five year period, although significant differences in cost estimates were
      revealed between countries.

TI  - Intragastric distribution of Helicobacter pylori during short-term omeprazole
      therapy: study using Carnoy's fixation and immunohistochemistry for detection of 
      bacteria.
PG  - 1485-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is controversy about the effect of acid-suppressive therapy on 
      Helicobacter pylori density and the severity of histological gastritis in the
      corpus. AIM: To evaluate the precise distribution of H. pylori, both on the
      surface mucus cells and in the surface mucus gel layer, by using Carnoy's
      fixation and immunostaining for the detection of bacteria. METHODS: A total of 19
      peptic ulcer patients with H. pylori infection were studied. All patients
      received a 6-week course of treatment with omeprazole (20 mg/day). Before and
      after the therapy, H. pylori density in Carnoy-fixed tissue sections was examined
      immunohistochemically. The effect of omeprazole therapy on the severity of
      gastritis was also evaluated. RESULTS: H. pylori density and the grade of
      gastritis significantly decreased in the antrum after omeprazole therapy. In the 
      corpus, however, there were no significant changes in H. pylori density or the
      severity of gastritis after omeprazole therapy. CONCLUSION: Carnoy's fixation and
      immunostaining was found to be useful for the detection of H. pylori in the
      surface mucus gel layer as well as on the surface mucus cells in biopsy tissue
      sections. By using this method, H. pylori density decreased in the antrum, but
      remained unchanged in the corpus after a 6-week course of omeprazole therapy.

TI  - Efficacy of triple therapy with rabeprazole for Helicobacter pylori infection and
      CYP2C19 genetic polymorphism.
PG  - 1479-84
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rabeprazole is a new, potent, proton pump inhibitor. The metabolism
      of rabeprazole is less dependent on CYP2C19 genetic polymorphism. METHODS: A
      total of 102 Helicobacter pylori-positive patients with gastric ulcer were
      randomly allocated to three groups: rabeprazole 10 mg (RAC10), rabeprazole 20 mg 
      (RAC20) or rabeprazole 40 mg (RAC40) plus amoxicillin 750 mg and clarithromycin
      200 mg twice daily for 7 days. CYP2C19 genotype was determined by the polymerase 
      chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. RESULTS:
      All-patients-treated-based eradication rates in patients treated with RAC10,
      RAC20 and RAC40 were 83%, 77% and 90%, respectively, and per protocol-based
      eradication rates were 83%, 80% and 90%, respectively. The eradication rates in
      the three groups were not significantly different. There was also no significant 
      difference between the all-patients-treated-based eradication rate in CYP2C19
      extensive metabolizers and that in poor metabolizers (86% vs. 77%). Adverse
      events were 12% in extensive metabolizers and 23% in poor metabolizers, and the
      difference in these incidence rates was also not statistically significant.
      CONCLUSIONS: Triple therapy with 10 mg of rabeprazole combined with
      amoxicillin/clarithromycin is effective for Japanese patients with H. pylori
      infection, and the H. pylori eradication rate is not affected by CYP2C19 genetic 
      polymorphism.

PG  - 1397-402
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data on the proton pump inhibitor lansoprazole in paediatric patients
      are limited. AIM: To investigate the pharmacokinetics, optimal dosage and
      efficacy of lansoprazole in paediatric patients. METHODS: A 24-h gastric pH
      recording and a pharmacokinetic study were performed after 7 days of
      lansoprazole, 17 mg/m2, in 23 patients with reflux oesophagitis (median age, 3.5 
      years). Response was defined as pH > 3 for > 65% of the recording. The dosage was
      doubled in non-responders. Patients with no response on day 14 were excluded.
      Responders underwent endoscopy after 4 weeks on the response-inducing dosage;
      abnormal findings led to a repeat endoscopy after four additional weeks. RESULTS:
      Nine patients responded to 17 mg/m2 and six to 30.3 mg/m2. On day 7, time with pH
      > 3 was significantly correlated with the area under the plasma
      concentration-time curve (P=0.003). The area under the plasma concentration-time 
      curve was significantly greater in the nine responders to 17 mg/m2 than in the 14
      other patients. Pharmacokinetic parameters were similar in responders and
      non-responders to the higher dose. After 4 weeks, oesophagitis was healed in 80% 
      of responders. Adverse events occurred in three patients and required treatment
      discontinuation in one. CONCLUSIONS: Lansoprazole is effective and safe in
      children. The optimal starting dosage is 30 mg/m2 or 1.4 mg/kg.

TI  - Influence of pantoprazole on oesophageal motility, and bile and acid reflux in
      patients with oesophagitis.
PG  - 1375-84
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reflux of duodeno-gastric juice into the oesophagus appears to be
      involved in the pathogenesis of both reflux oesophagitis and oesophageal
      adenocarcinoma. Although proton pump inhibitors have been shown to decrease acid 
      reflux and heal oesophagitis, their effect on biliary reflux and motility is less
      clear. AIM: To investigate whether pantoprazole also reduces bile reflux and
      whether this is paralleled by a change in oesophageal motility. METHODS: Combined
      24-h measurements of intraoesophageal bilirubin concentration, pH and pressure
      were performed in 18 symptomatic patients with endoscopically proven reflux
      oesophagitis before and on day 28 of treatment with pantoprazole, 40 mg/day,
      under standardized conditions. A reflux symptom score was determined initially
      and every 2 weeks thereafter. After 56 days on medication, a control endoscopy
      was performed. RESULTS: The symptom score and the acid and bile reflux improved
      significantly, whereas the motility parameters did not change during the study
      period. Helicobacter pylori-positive patients had a significantly higher bile
      reflux time (32.1 +/- 4.3%) than H. pylori-negative patients (16.3 +/- 3.1%)
      (P=0.009). The endoscopic healing rate was 89%. The cough symptoms disappeared in
      three of four patients. CONCLUSIONS: The proton pump inhibitor pantoprazole
      decreases both acid and bile reflux. The decrease of bile reflux cannot be
      explained by increased oesophageal clearance as oesophageal motility did not
      improve with therapy. Interestingly, H. pylori infection of the stomach was
      associated with higher levels of oesophageal bile reflux.

TI  - Bedtime H2 blockers improve nocturnal gastric acid control in GERD patients on
      proton pump inhibitors.
PG  - 1351-6
AB  - AIM: Proton pump inhibitors taken twice daily before meals (proton pump inhibitor
      b.d. AC) effectively controls daytime gastric pH; however, nocturnal gastric acid
      breakthrough (NAB) occurs in more than 75% of patients. Adding an H2-blocker at
      bedtime decreases NAB in normal subjects. The efficacy of this regimen has not
      been evaluated in GERD patients. The aim of this study was to assess the effects 
      of proton pump inhibitor b.d., both with and without bedtime H2-blocker on
      intragastric pH and the occurrence of NAB in GERD patients. METHODS: Prolonged
      ambulatory pH studies in GERD patients were reviewed. Group A: 60 patients (mean 
      age 53 years, male 30) taking either omeprazole 20 mg or lansoprazole 30 mg b.d. 
      Group B: 45 patients (mean age 49 years, male 23) on proton pump inhibitor b.d.
      (omeprazole 20 mg or lansoprazole 30 mg) plus an H2-blocker at bedtime
      (ranitidine 300 mg, famotidine 40 mg or nizatidine 300 mg). Eleven patients were 
      evaluated during treatment with both regimens (group C). The percentage time of
      nocturnal and daytime intragastric pH > 4 and per cent of patients with gastric
      NAB were analysed. In the patients with NAB, its duration and associated
      oesophageal acid exposure also were analysed. RESULTS: Median percentage time
      intragastric pH > 4 overnight was 51% in group A, compared to 96% in group B (P <
      0.0001). Median percentage daytime pH > 4 was 73% in group A and 79.8% in group B
      (P=0.14). Median percentage time intragastric pH >p 4 overnight increased from
      54.6% without H2RA to 96.5% after adding bedtime H2RA (P=0.0013) in group C
      patients. NAB occurred in 82% patients in group A and 40% in group B (P <
      0.0001). The mean duration of oesophageal acid exposure during NAB was
      significantly shorter in group B (18 +/- 6 min) than in group A (42 +/- 9 min,
      P=0.04). SUMMARY: Adding a bedtime H2-blocker to the treatment enhanced nocturnal
      gastric pH control and decreased NAB compared to the proton pump inhibitor b.d.
      regimen. A bedtime H2-blocker also decreased oesophageal acid exposure during
      NAB. CONCLUSION: Adding a bedtime H2-blocker to a proton pump inhibitor b.d.
      regimen should be considered in patients who require continued nocturnal gastric 
      acid control whilst taking proton pump inhibitor b.d.

TI  - Decreasing oesophageal acid exposure in patients with GERD: a comparison of
      rabeprazole and omeprazole.
PG  - 1343-50
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rabeprazole has been shown to be more potent and faster than other
      proton pump inhibitors in in vitro studies and highly effective in decreasing
      oesophageal acid exposure in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease
      (GERD). AIM: This study was a multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      randomized, parallel-group comparison of three active treatment regimens
      utilizing two different proton pump inhibitors, or placebo, administered over 7
      days in patients with GERD. METHODS: Eighty-two patients with symptomatic GERD
      were given placebo, rabeprazole 10 mg b.d., rabeprazole 20 mg o.m., or omeprazole
      20 mg o.m. for 7 days. Twenty-four hour oesophageal pH monitoring was performed
      at baseline and repeated at the conclusion of the treatment period. RESULTS: At
      the end of study, the percentage time (mean +/- s.d.) with pH < 4 over a 24-h
      period was significantly decreased by the three active regimens but without
      significant difference between them (9.27 +/- 4.77; 2.53 +/- 4.27; 2.02 +/- 1.71 
      and 2.91 +/- 4.06 for placebo, rabeprazole 10 mg b.d., rabeprazole 20 mg o.m. and
      omeprazole 20 mg o.m., respectively). Acid exposure was normalized in 90% of
      patients treated with rabeprazole 10 mg b.d., 95% treated with rabeprazole 20 mg 
      o.m., 78% treated with omeprazole 20 mg o.m., and only 9.5% of patients treated
      with placebo. Both rabeprazole and omeprazole were well-tolerated. CONCLUSIONS:
      Although rabeprazole 20 mg o.m. showed greater activity numerically, this study
      demonstrates that rabeprazole 10 mg b.d. and 20 mg o.m. are equivalent to
      omeprazole 20 mg o.m. in decreasing oesophageal acid exposure.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori: a debated factor in gastroesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 127-33
AB  - The prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection is steadily decreasing in
      developing countries, and this has been paralleled by an increasing incidence of 
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and
      of the esophagogastric junction. The prevalence of H. pylori infection, which is 
      on the decline in Europe and in the United States, is probably related to
      improvements in sanitary conditions and socioeconomic status. These
      epidemiological data do not support a role for H. pylori in the pathogenesis of
      GERD, but at the same time suggest a negative association with the rising
      incidence in esophageal diseases. While H. pylori infection clearly does not
      cause GERD, it may protect certain susceptible individuals from the development
      of GERD and its complications. There are conflicting reports that GERD can
      develop after H. pylori eradication and that proton pump inhibitors are less
      effective in suppressing intragastric acidity in H. pylori negative
      patients--reasons not to eradicate H. pylori in GERD patients. On the contrary,
      other data suggest an increase in the development of atrophic gastritis in GERD
      patients (H. pylori positive) on long-term proton pump inhibitor therapy - a
      reason to eradicate H. pylori. Preexisting lower esophageal sphincter
      dysfunction, susceptibility to GERD, unmasking of latent GERD, and patterns and
      severity of gastritis may be important factors contributing to the development of
      GERD rather than just the presence or absence of infection with H. pylori.

TI  - Barrett's-related esophageal adenocarcinoma: is chemoprevention a potential
      option?
PG  - 2302-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Review the rationale behind secondary prevention of Barrett's related 
      esophageal adenocarcinoma and critically appraise the emerging literature
      regarding prevention of neoplasia in Barrett's esophagus with antisecretory
      and/or cyclo-oxygenase inhibition therapy. METHODS: The existing English language
      literature regarding secondary cancer prevention in patients with Barrett's
      esophagus is reviewed and its potential clinical implications discussed. RESULTS:
      There is biologic plausibility to pursue "chemoprevention" trials with
      antisecretory and/or cyclo-oxygenase inhibition therapy in patients with
      Barrett's esophagus. CONCLUSION: Chemoprevention trials using potent
      antisecretory therapy coupled with cyclo-oxygenase 2 inhibition are warranted and
      may provide a means of decreasing the occurrence of cancer and cancer-related
      mortality in this disease.

TI  - Drug interaction studies with esomeprazole, the (S)-isomer of omeprazole.
PG  - 523-37
AB  - Esomeprazole, the (S)-isomer of omeprazole, is the first proton pump inhibitor
      (PPI) developed as a single isomer for the treatment of patients with acid
      related diseases. Because of the extensive use of PPIs, the documentation of the 
      potential for drug interactions with esomeprazole is of great importance. Altered
      absorption or metabolism are 2 of the major mechanisms for drug-drug
      interactions. Since intragastric pH will increase with esomeprazole treatment, it
      can be hypothesised that the absorption of drugs with pH-sensitive absorption
      (e.g. digoxin and ketoconazole) may be affected. Esomeprazole does not seem to
      have any potential to interact with drugs that are metabolised by cytochrome P450
      (CYP) 1 A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6 or 2E1. In drug interaction studies with diazepam,
      phenytoin and (R)-warfarin, it was shown that esomeprazole has the potential to
      interact with CYP2C19. The slightly altered metabolism of cisapride was also
      suggested to be the result of inhibition of a minor metabolic pathway for
      cisapride mediated by CYP2C19. Esomeprazole did not interact with the CYP3A4
      substrates clarithromycin (2 studies) or quinidine. Since the slightly increased 
      area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of cisapride could be explained as 
      an inhibition of CYP2C19, the data on these 3 CYP3A4 substrates indicate that
      esomeprazole does not have the potential to inhibit this enzyme. The minor
      effects reported for diazepam, phenytoin, (R)-warfarin, and cisapride are
      unlikely to be of clinical relevance. Clarithromycin interacts with the
      metabolism of esomeprazole resulting in a doubling of the AUC of esomeprazole.
      The increased plasma concentrations of esomeprazole are unlikely to have any
      safety implications. It can be concluded that the potential for drug-drug
      interactions with esomeprazole is low, and similar to that reported for
      omeprazole.

TI  - A randomised controlled trial of four management strategies for dyspepsia:
      relationships between symptom subgroups and strategy outcome.
PG  - 619-24
AB  - BACKGROUND: The first step in the management of uncomplicated dyspepsia in
      primary care often consists of prescribing empirical therapy, but in certain
      cases prompt endoscopy might be preferred. Any decision is usually based on the
      patient's symptoms and the presumed underlying pathology that causes these
      symptoms. AIM: To assess the relationship between symptom subgroups and the
      effect of management strategies on primary care patients with dyspepsia. DESIGN
      OF STUDY: Randomised controlled trial. SETTING: All patients presenting
      successively with a new episode of dyspepsia between January 1995 and November
      1997. METHOD: The results of four management strategies in dyspeptic primary care
      patients were compared and the value of subgrouping within this trial was
      estimated. Patients were allocated to one of either (a) empirical treatment in
      which therapy was based on the presented symptoms, or empirical treatment with
      (b) omeprazole or (c) cisapride regardless of the presented symptoms, or (d)
      prompt endoscopy followed by the appropriate treatment. Patients were
      retrospectively classified into the subgroups for each strategy using baseline
      data. The yield of each strategy was measured by counting the number of strategy 
      failures in the first year. RESULTS: Of the 349 included patients, 326 were
      analysed. No statistically significant difference could be demonstrated between
      the strategies or between the symptom subgroups. However, patients in the
      reflux-like subgroup showed a trend towards a better outcome in all empirical
      strategies. Ulcer-like dyspepsia seemed to benefit from omeprazole. The
      non-specific subgroup seemed to benefit from cisapride but also had the highest
      proportion of strategy failure. Prompt endoscopy did not appear especially useful
      in any subgroup. CONCLUSION: Although this study has relatively low power, we
      conclude that the use of symptom subgroups seems to be a sensible approach when
      choosing empirical therapy in dyspepsia. Patients with reflux-like symptoms seem 
      to have the best prognosis in the first year in every strategy.

TI  - Famotidine versus omeprazole, in combination with amoxycillin and tinidazole, for
      eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection.
PG  - 921-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Eradication regimens combining two antibiotics with a proton pump
      inhibitor have been studied intensively. In contrast, only a few studies have
      focused on the possible role of H2-receptor antagonists in eradication therapy.
      The mechanism involved in the synergy between antibiotics and proton pump
      inhibitors is still controversial. OBJECTIVES: To compare the results of two
      triple-therapy regimens, different only in the antisecretory drugs used, in
      patients with Helicobacter pylori infection, and to assess the impact of primary 
      resistance to metronidazole on treatment outcome. METHODS: A total of 120
      patients with peptic ulcer and non-ulcer dyspepsia were randomly assigned to a
      2-week course of either: famotidine 40 mg twice a day, amoxycillin 1 g twice a
      day and tinidazole 500 mg twice a day (FAT group; n = 60); or omeprazole 20 mg
      twice a day, amoxycillin 1 g twice a day and tinidazole 500 mg twice a day (OAT
      group; n = 60). Upper endoscopy was performed prior to treatment and at least 4
      weeks after completion of treatment and discontinuation of the antisecretory
      therapy. H. pylori status was assessed by a biopsy urease test, histology and
      culture. RESULTS: In the intention-to-treat analysis, eradication of H. pylori
      was achieved in 48 of the 60 patients (80%; 95% confidence interval: 70-90%) in
      the FAT group, compared to 50 of the 60 patients (83.3%; 95% confidence interval:
      74-93%) in the OAT group. In the per protocol analysis, eradication therapy was
      achieved in 48 out of 53 patients (90.6%; 95% confidence interval: 83-98%)
      treated with FAT and 50 out of 57 patients (87.7%; 95% confidence interval:
      79-96%) treated with OAT (not significant). The primary metronidazole resistance 
      was present in 28.8% of strains. Overall, per protocol eradication rates in
      strains resistant and susceptible to metronidazole were 83.3% and 91.3%
      respectively (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Two-week courses of either high-dose
      famotidine or omeprazole, both combined with amoxycillin and tinidazole, are
      equally effective for eradication of H. pylori infection. In a 2-week triple
      therapy, metronidazole resistance has no significant impact on eradication rates.

TI  - No clinical benefit of adding cisapride to pantoprazole for treatment of
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 909-14
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and a prokinetic drug are often
      combined for the medical treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD),
      there are few well-conducted clinical studies on the efficacy and tolerability of
      this therapy. This study investigates whether pantoprazole plus cisapride leads
      to an additional benefit in comparison to pantoprazole alone. DESIGN AND SETTING:
      Randomized double-blind prospective multicentre study conducted in patients of 33
      hospitals in Ireland, South Africa and the UK. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 350
      intention-to-treat (ITT) patients aged 18 years or older with GORD of grade II
      and III were included in the study. The per-protocol (PP) population comprised
      152 patients in the pantoprazole group and 136 in the pantoprazole plus cisapride
      group. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received either pantoprazole 40 mg once daily or
      pantoprazole 40 mg once daily plus cisapride 20 mg twice daily. Treatment outcome
      was assessed after 4 and 8 weeks. The primary criterion was endoscopically
      confirmed healing after 4 weeks. Additionally, relief of leading symptoms was
      studied. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The prior null hypothesis was no difference in
      healing rates between both treatment groups. RESULTS: After 4 weeks of treatment 
      81% and 82%, and after 8 weeks 89% and 90%, of PP patients treated with
      pantoprazole or pantoprazole plus cisapride were healed, respectively. Thus,
      equivalence of the two treatment strategies could be proven. Additionally,
      improvement of symptom relief showed no significant difference between the two
      regimens. In contrast to disease grade at baseline, Helicobacter pylori status
      did not influence the healing rates in our study. Both study medications were
      tolerated well. CONCLUSION: Addition of cisapride to pantoprazole provides no
      further benefit in the treatment of GORD.

TI  - Does short-term treatment with proton pump inhibitors cause rebound aggravation
      of symptoms?
PG  - 206-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rebound acid hypersecretion might occur after treatment with proton
      pump inhibitors. This study looks for a rebound aggravation of symptoms after
      short-term treatment with lansoprazole. STUDY: Sixty-two patients (19 men and 43 
      women; mean age, 54 years; range, 32-77 years) with heartburn and regurgitation
      and normal upper endoscopy findings were studied in a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial with a crossover design. There were two 5-day treatment 
      periods with lansoprazole 60 mg once daily or placebo in random order, separated 
      by a 9-day washout period. Reflux, total, and antacid scores were calculated for 
      each of the treatment periods. Higher scores during the placebo period in the
      group given lansoprazole first than in the group given placebo first indicated a 
      rebound aggravation of symptoms. RESULTS: The mean symptom scores during the
      placebo period in the groups given lansoprazole first and placebo first were as
      follows: reflux score, 21.5 and 17.6, respectively (not significant); total
      score, 11.2 and 10.3, respectively (not significant); and antacid score, 8.2 and 
      7.2, respectively (not significant). CONCLUSIONS: There is no indication of a
      rebound aggravation of symptoms 12 to 14 days after a 5-day treatment with
      lansoprazole 60 mg once daily in patients with reflux symptoms.

TI  - High-dose proton-pump inhibitors as a diagnostic test of gastro-oesophageal
      reflux disease in endoscopic-negative patients.
PG  - 806-10
AB  - BACKGROUND: To evaluate a high dose of a proton-pump inhibitor as a diagnostic
      test in endoscopy-negative patients presenting with symptoms indicating
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. METHODS: 64 patients were studied in a
      prospective, randomized, double-blind study, using a cross-over design. After a
      run-in period with the diary registration of basic GORD symptoms and recording of
      the consumption of antacid tablets, the patients were given either 60 mg of
      lansoprazole once daily or placebo in randomized order. Symptoms were recorded,
      as well as antacid tablets taken in order to relieve pain. GORD was determined by
      24-h oesophageal pH monitoring. The test was considered positive when consumption
      of antacid tablets was reduced > or = 75% compared to pretreatment. RESULTS: In
      the GORD group, 29 (85%) tested positive during active treatment compared to 3
      (9%) when on placebo. Corresponding figures for the non-GORD patients were 50%
      and 27%, giving a test sensitivity and specificity of 85% and 73%, respectively. 
      During active treatment, VAS scores for acid regurgitation, heartburn and over
      all were significantly lowered in GORD patients, compared to heartburn only in
      the non-GORD group. CONCLUSIONS: 60 mg lansoprazole once daily for 5 days is an
      easy to use method for diagnosing GORD in endoscopy-negative patients. Using 24-h
      oesophageal pH monitoring as the reference method, the sensitivity was relatively
      high, while the specificity was lower. Further studies are needed to determine
      how a PPI could be used as a diagnostic test in GORD.

TI  - Review Article: is Helicobacter pylori relevant in the management of reflux
      disease?
PG  - 16-21
AB  - Data on the interaction of reflux disease and Helicobacter pylori infection are
      limited in scope and rigour, controversial and difficult to interpret. Despite
      this, a framework of understanding is emerging, which is consistent with known
      effects on gastric acid secretion. In patients with moderate to severe H.
      pylori-induced corpus gastritis, eradication can increase substantially impaired 
      gastric acid secretion sufficiently to precipitate reflux disease in people with 
      pre-existing sub-clinical defective gastro-oesophageal competence. By contrast,
      reflux disease in duodenal ulcer patients probably benefits from eradication of
      H. pylori. There appears to be no significant impact on reflux disease from
      eradication in healthy subjects or individuals whose primary problem is reflux
      disease. Helicobacter pylori-infected reflux disease patients respond slightly
      better to proton pump inhibitors. These agents cause a topographic alteration of 
      gastritis from antrum to corpus, the clinical significance of which is
      controversial. Many practitioners misjudge the risks and benefits of the effects 
      of H. pylori eradication on reflux disease. Regardless of patient diagnosis, the 
      balance is in favour of H. pylori eradication. For those in whom reflux
      oesophagitis development is a defined possibility, oesophagitis is mild, easily
      treated and most unlikely to be associated with any major risk for development of
      oesophageal adenocarcinoma.

TI  - Criteria used by general practitioners in prescribing prokinetic or antisecretory
      drugs in patients with functional dyspepsia.
PG  - 281-92
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical factors considered by general practitioners
      for the prescription of prokinetic or antisecretory drugs in patients with
      functional dyspepsia (FD), and to assess therapeutic outcomes and factors
      predicting effectiveness. DESIGN: Multicentric, prospective and observational
      study. PATIENTS: 1,021 patients with FD were included. One hundred and thirty-two
      (132) were excluded from the analysis because they were taking ASA or NSAID.
      Patients were classified according to their predominant symptoms as reflux,
      ulcer, dysmotility or non-specific. At the physician discretion, treatment with
      alkali drugs was prescribed to 38 patients, prokinetic drugs to 574,
      antisecretory drugs to 123 and a combined therapy to 154. One month later,
      patient self-perception of symptomatic improvement was evaluated in patients
      treated with prokinetic drugs and antisecretory drugs. RESULTS: 85% of the
      patients reported symptomatic improvement after one month of treatment. Patients 
      with non-specific FD had lower improvement rates regardless of the drug used
      (prokinetic or antisecretory) (77%) compared to all the other types (p = 0.03).
      Prescription of prokinetics was associated to female gender (OR: 0.43; 95% CI:
      0.28-0.66) and early satiety (OR: 2.5; 95% CI: 1.6-4.1). A longer symptomatic
      evolution (OR 0.92: 95% CI: 0.88-0.97) was the only independent predictive factor
      of a poor response to prokinetic drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with FD
      attended by general practitioners, female gender and early satiety symptom were
      associated to the prescription of prokinetic drugs. Early symptomatic
      effectiveness rates for prokinetic or antisecretory drugs alike were high (85%). 
      Patients with non-specific dyspepsia or long symptomatic evolution showed less
      favorable symptomatic response to prokinetic drugs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of long term treatment with
      esomeprazole in patients with healed erosive oesophagitis, and to describe its
      efficacy in the maintenance of healing. DESIGN AND SETTING: US multicentre,
      noncomparative, nonblind study. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: 807 patients with
      endoscopically confirmed healed erosive oesophagitis. METHODS: Patients received 
      esomeprazole 40 mg once daily for up to 12 months. Adverse events and clinical
      laboratory tests were assessed over the study period. Endoscopy was performed at 
      the final visit of the antecedent healing trials and at months 6 and 12 of the
      current safety trial; gastric biopsies were obtained at the initial visit of the 
      healing trials and at the end of the safety trial. RESULTS: 80.9% of patients
      completed 6 months of treatment; 76.6% completed 12 months of treatment. There
      were no serious drug-related adverse events. Diarrhoea, abdominal pain,
      flatulence, and headache were the only treatment-related adverse events reported 
      by >3% of patients. Mean changes in laboratory measures were generally small and 
      not clinically meaningful. Plasma gastrin levels increased, as expected, and
      reached a plateau after 3 months. No changes in gastric histological scores were 
      noted in the majority of patients. Evaluation of gastric biopsies revealed an
      overall decline in chronic inflammation and atrophy. Intestinal metaplasia
      findings remained essentially unchanged. Life table estimates of maintenance of
      healing were 93.7% [95% confidence interval (CI) 92.0 to 95.5%] at 6 months and
      89.4% (95% CI 87.0 to 91.7%) at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Daily treatment with
      esomeprazole 40 mg for up to 1 year in patients with healed erosive oesophagitis 
      was generally well tolerated and effective. No safety concerns arose.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic studies with esomeprazole, the (S)-isomer of omeprazole.
PG  - 411-26
AB  - This article reviews the pharmacokinetics of esomeprazole, the (S)-isomer of the 
      proton pump inhibitor (PPI) omeprazole. Esomeprazole is the first single isomer
      PPI developed for the treatment of patients with acid-related diseases. In vitro 
      experiments in human liver microsomes demonstrated that the formation of the
      hydroxy and 5-O-desmethyl metabolites of esomeprazole is via cytochrome P450
      (CYP) 2C19, whereas that of the sulphone metabolite is via CYP3A4. The formation 
      rate of the hydroxy metabolite from esomeprazole is lower than for
      (R)-omeprazole, but that of the 2 other metabolites is higher, demonstrating
      stereoselective metabolism. The sum of the intrinsic clearances of all 3 metabo- 
      lites for esomeprazole was one-third of that for (R)-omeprazole, suggesting lower
      clearance of esomeprazole in vivo. In vivo investigations demonstrated that
      esomeprazole is chirally stable after administration. Esomeprazole is 97% bound
      to plasma proteins. In normal (extensive) metabolisers with regard to CYP2C19,
      esomeprazole is metabolised more slowly than omeprazole, resulting in a higher
      area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) after administration of the same
      dose. This is more pronounced after repeated administration rather than after a
      single dose. In poor metabolisers, the AUC is lower for esomeprazole than for
      omeprazole, contributing to less overall interindividual variability for
      esomeprazole than for omeprazole. In general, esomeprazole and omeprazole are
      subject to the same metabolic transformations. Almost complete recoveries were
      reported and the ratio between urinary and faecal excretion is about 4:1 for both
      compounds. The dose-dependent increase in AUC of esomeprazole with repeated
      administration results from a combination of decreased first-pass elimination and
      decreased systemic clearance. Patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease
      exhibit a pharmacokinetic pattern similar to that in healthy individuals, whereas
      elderly individuals exhibited a slightly lower metabolism rate. Patients with a
      severe deficit in their liver function had a lower rate of metabolism, as would
      be expected, whereas those with mild to moderate liver disease did not exhibit
      any alteration in the pharmacokinetics. The pharmacokinetics of esomeprazole in
      individuals with impaired renal function is unlikely to differ from that in
      healthy individuals. A slight sex difference in the pharmacokinetics of
      esomeprazole was demonstrated in that the AUC and peak plasma drug concentration 
      were slightly, but not statistically significantly, higher in females than in
      males.

TI  - A randomized comparison of triple therapy Helicobacter pylori eradication
      regimens in children with peptic ulcers.
PG  - 147-53
AB  - An open, randomized trial was performed to compare the efficacy of three
      Helicobacter pylori eradication regimens in children with peptic ulcer disease. A
      total of 106 children (5 - 15 years) were treated for 1 week with metronidazole, 
      30 - 40 mg/kg per day depending on age, amoxycillin, 750 mg/day, and one of three
      anti-secretory agents: proprietary omeprazole, 20 - 40 mg/day depending on age;
      generic omeprazole, 20 - 40 mg/day; or ranitidine, 150 mg twice daily. The H.
      pylori eradication rate was significantly higher in patients receiving
      proprietary omeprazole (88.9%) than in those receiving generic omeprazole (80.0%)
      or ranitidine (74.3%), and this was associated with a trend towards faster ulcer 
      healing. It is concluded that triple therapy consisting of an anti-secretory
      agent and two antimicrobials produces effective eradication of H. pylori and
      ulcer healing in children with peptic ulcer disease, and that proprietary
      omeprazole is more effective than both ranitidine and the generic formulation
      used in this study.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of proton-pump inhibitors for maintenance therapy of erosive
      reflux esophagitis.
PG  - 1338-46
AB  - The relative cost-effectiveness of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) in the
      maintenance therapy of erosive reflux esophagitis was studied. Decision analysis 
      was used to model the cost-effectiveness of PPIs on the basis of clinical trial
      results. Management decisions in the model were based on published U.S.
      guidelines and recommendations. Probability estimates were derived from a
      systematic review of the literature. The model's base-case scenario compared
      rabeprazole, lansoprazole, and omeprazole for the prevention of symptom
      recurrence over one year. Meta-analyzed estimates of efficacy were derived from
      trials by using a generalized logistic regression model with random effects.
      Medical costs for hospitalization, procedures, and office visits reflected 2000
      Medicare payment; drug costs were based on 2000 average wholesale prices. Average
      costs per patient were comparable among the PPIs (rabeprazole, $1414;
      lansoprazole, $1671; and omeprazole, $1599). Rabeprazole prevented symptom
      recurrence in 86% of rabeprazole recipients, versus 68% for lansoprazole and 81% 
      for omeprazole, and yielded the lowest average cost-effectiveness ratio
      (rabeprazole, $1637 per recurrence prevented; lansoprazole, $2439; and
      omeprazole, $1968). The model was robust to changes in key variables. When
      evaluated by decision analysis over a wide range of assumptions, rabeprazole was 
      comparable to other PPIs in terms of cost and offered improved effectiveness for 
      maintenance therapy of erosive reflux esophagitis.

TI  - Quality of life in patients with endoscopy-negative heartburn: reliability and
      sensitivity of disease-specific instruments.
PG  - 1998-2004
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Endoscopy-negative gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) lacks
      objective markers of disease severity. Evaluation of therapies for GERD must
      therefore rely on subjective measures, including patient self-report
      questionnaires, to measure the clinical effectiveness of therapeutic
      interventions. We aimed to evaluate the previously validated Gastrointestinal
      Symptoms Rating Scale (GSRS) and the Quality of Life in Reflux and Dyspepsia
      (QOLRAD) questionnaires for reliability and responsiveness to change over time.
      METHODS: Patients (n = 1143) with heartburn, but no esophagitis included in a
      randomized clinical trial assessing the effectiveness of active treatment with
      proton pump inhibitors over 4 wk were evaluated. RESULTS: The test-retest
      reliability of both questionnaires over time was good to excellent (GSRS
      0.53-0.69; QOLRAD 0.65-0.76), as was the responsiveness estimated by standardized
      response means (GSRS reflux dimension, -1.43; QOLRAD 0.81-1.43) and effect sizes 
      (GRSR reflux dimension, -1.74; QOLRAD 0.82-1.56). The relationship between
      improvement in the GSRS reflux dimension score and the amount of clinical benefit
      as estimated by the patients themselves (based on the Overall Treatment
      Evaluation) suggested a minimally clinical relevant change is 0.5 on the seven
      graded scales applied. The importance rating indicated that an important change
      in the GSRS reflux dimension and the QOLRAD dimensions is equivalent to 1.0, and 
      a very important change to 1.5. CONCLUSIONS: The GSRS and QOLRAD are valid
      questionnaires that are reliable and sensitive to change. Both questionnaires
      should be suitable for use in clinical trials of therapeutic interventions for
      patients with heartburn.

TI  - Evaluation of an office-based urine test for detecting Helicobacter pylori: a
      Prospective Pilot Study.
PG  - 614-7
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: To ascertain the reliability of a newly developed office-based
      urine test, the RAPIRUN test, used for detection of H. pylori infection.
      METHODOLOGY: Urine specimens from 142 consecutive patients undergoing
      gastroendoscopy (77 men, 65 women; mean 52.0 years) were tested with RAPIRUN at
      the same time. The total reaction time for the urine test is 20 min. None of the 
      patients had received any H. pylori eradicating treatment. The H. pylori status
      was evaluated based on 5 different tests: culture, histology, biopsy urease test,
      13C-urea breath test, and the RAPIRUN test. A commercial office-based kit using
      an immunochromatographic technique was used to examine urine samples for H.
      pylori antibody. H. pylori status was defined as positive when the culture was
      positive or if 2 of the other 3 tests (histology, biopsy urease test, and
      13C-urea breath test were positive. RESULTS: Of 93 patients with H. pylori
      infection, 88 were tested as positive by RAPIRUN (sensitivity 94.6%). Of 48
      patients without infection, 43 were found to be negative by RAPIRUN (specificity 
      89.6%). One case with an invalid urine test was excluded. CONCLUSIONS: This urine
      test is a rapid, inexpensive, reliable and easy-to-use tool for the diagnosis of 
      H. pylori infection in untreated patients. It can be used for mass screening of
      patients' H. pylori status, particularly in children, postgastrectomy patients,
      uncooperative patients, and patients undergoing bismuth or proton pump inhibitor 
      treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pharyngeal pH monitoring is a diagnostic tool used to identify
      Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) as an etiology of respiratory symptoms. We
      performed pharyngeal pH monitoring on 14 patients with respiratory symptoms
      thought to be induced by GERD. METHODS: Symptoms and pH monitoring (esophageal
      and pharyngeal) were assessed prior to and 3 months after the initiation of
      double-dose proton pump inhibitor therapy. RESULTS: Symptoms included cough,
      hoarseness, and throat clearing. Ten patients had at least one episode of
      pharyngeal reflux (PR+) and 4 patients had no pharyngeal reflux (PR-). Pharyngeal
      reflux episodes in PR+ patients decreased from 3.5 to 0.9 (P <0.05) per day with 
      8 of 10 (80%) patients having elimination or reduction of such episodes. Eight of
      9 PR+ patients (89%) with suppressed pharyngeal reflux on medical therapy had
      resolution of respiratory symptoms. Three of 4 PR- patients (75%) had persistent 
      symptoms on medical therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Proton pump inhibitor therapy improves 
      clinical symptoms and decreases pharyngeal reflux episodes in patients with
      respiratory symptoms related to GERD. Direct measurement of pharyngeal pH is
      helpful in the identification of patients likely to respond to antireflux
      therapy.

TI  - The AMOR study: a randomized, double-blinded trial of omeprazole versus
      ranitidine together with amoxycillin and metronidazole for eradication of
      Helicobacter pylori.
PG  - 685-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: Besides antibiotics, additionally effective acid inhibition is
      necessary for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori. OBJECTIVE: To assess the
      significance of acid suppression and, in particular, treatment with proton pump
      inhibitors (PPIs) compared with H2 receptor antagonists (H2 RAs). The primary
      target parameter for the study was H. pylori eradication. In addition, the ulcer 
      healing rate, speed of pain reduction, score for gastritis in the antrum and
      gastric body, and rate of side effects were recorded. DESIGN: Randomized,
      double-blinded, multicentre study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 456 patients between 
      the ages of 18 and 80 years with H. pylori-positive duodenal ulcers were included
      in the study. METHODS: Using a randomization list, patients were assigned either 
      to a treatment group receiving omeprazole 40 mg once daily, amoxycillin 750 mg
      three times a day, and metronidazole 500 mg three times a day (OAM), or to a
      group receiving ranitidine 300 mg once daily, amoxycillin 750 mg three times a
      day, and metronidazole 500 mg three times a day (RAM). The treatment period was 7
      days in both groups. Long-term acid-suppressant treatment was not given. RESULTS:
      The eradication rate was 87.1% (169/194, intention to treat [ITT]) in the OAM
      group and 77% (137/ 178, ITT) in the RAM group. The difference of 10.1% (95% CI
      2.5-18%) is statistically significant (P= 0.0104). The ulcer healing rate was
      93.3% in the OAM group (181/194, ITT) and 92.1% in the RAM group (164/178, ITT,
      NS). With regard to the speed and intensity of pain reduction, the OAM group was 
      superior to the RAM group. In patients in whom H. pylori eradication was
      successful, the reduction in the antral and gastric body gastritis score was
      significantly greater than in patients without eradication. In the OAM group,
      39.1% of the patients (n = 90) reported one or more side effects, compared with
      44.7% (n = 101) in the RAM group (P= 1.5449, NS). CONCLUSION: Omeprazole (40 mg
      once daily in the morning) is significantly more effective than ranitidine (300
      mg once daily in the morning) with respect to H. pylori eradication when used
      together with amoxycillin (750 mg three times a day) and metronidazole (500 mg
      three times a day) for a 7-day treatment period.

TI  - Acid peptic disease in the elderly.
PG  - 363-76
AB  - GERD and peptic ulcer disease are important diseases in the elderly. GERD
      presents similarly in the elderly and the young, although elderly patients may
      have less severe symptoms yet more severe mucosal disease and a higher prevalence
      of BE. Although the prevalence of H. pylori is falling, the elderly remain at
      risk for peptic ulcer because of the widespread use of NSAIDS. The presentation
      of peptic ulcer disease in the elderly can be subtle and atypical when compared
      with younger patients, leading to a delay in diagnosis. Because of comorbidity in
      the aged, peptic ulcer disease and its complications result in increased
      morbidity and mortality rates.

TI  - Ranitidine bismuth citrate.
PG  - 389-98
AB  - Recognition of the relationship between Helicobacter pylori infection and the
      development of gastroduodenal disease has increased greatly in recent years. To
      avoid complications of H pylori infection, such as the development of recurrent
      duodenal and gastric ulcers, effective therapies are required for eradication of 
      the infection. This article reviews ranitidine bismuth citrate (RBC), a novel
      complex of ranitidine, bismuth and citrate, which was developed specifically for 
      the purpose of eradicating H pylori. Dual therapy with RBC in combination with
      clarithromycin for 14 days yields eradication rates of 76%. Triple therapy bid
      for one week with a proton pump inhibitor, clarithromycin and either amoxicillin 
      or a nitroimidazole (tinidazole or metronidazole) is advocated as the treatment
      of choice for H pylori eradication. Analogous regimens with RBC in place of
      proton pump inhibitors show effective eradication rates in comparative studies
      and with pooled data. RBC, used alone or in combination with other antibiotics,
      appears to be a safe and effective drug for the treatment of H pylori infection. 
      Bismuth levels do not appear to rise to toxic levels.

TI  - Quadruple therapy for symptomatic spontaneous duodenal ulcer disease.
PG  - 447-50
AB  - AIM: To investigate Helicobacter pylori eradication in duodenal ulcer patients
      with a new regimen, lansoprazole 30 mg daily for one or four weeks plus twice
      daily tetracycline 500 mg, clarithromycin 250 mg, and metronidazole 400 mg.
      BACKGROUND: Spontaneous duodenal ulcer is regularly associated with H pylori, and
      permanent cure follows eradication of this bacterium. Numerous treatments have
      been proposed and none is ideal, possibly because of primary or acquired
      antibiotic resistance. Quadruple regimens with proton pump inhibitor therapy and 
      three antibiotics offer promise as the most effective therapy. METHODS: From
      November 1995 all patients with spontaneous duodenal ulcer were offered quadruple
      therapy. A month after completion a carbon 14 urea breath test (UBT) was
      performed. Sensitivity of H pylori to the antibiotics used was tested in 1992-3, 
      1996, and 1999. RESULTS: A total of 331 patients were treated; 313 attended for a
      UBT, of which 299 were negative (95.5%). Of those patients who had an endoscopy
      with positive urease test immediately before treatment, 95/101 (94.0%) on
      lansoprazole for one week and 116/121 (95.8%) on lansoprazole for four weeks had 
      a negative UBT. H pylori antibiotic sensitivity did not change. CONCLUSION: This 
      regimen produced some of the best results yet seen and may be generally
      recommended as first line therapy.

TI  - Is eradication of Helicobacter pylori with colloidal bismuth subcitrate quadruple
      therapy safe?
PG  - 151-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: When standard triple therapy fails to eradicate Helicobacter pylori, 
      quadruple 'rescue' therapy is often used which, in Europe, generally comprises
      colloidal bismuth subcitrate (CBS) based triple therapy and a proton pump
      inhibitor. Since hypochlorhydria could greatly increase absorption of the toxic
      bismuth ion from CBS, we investigated the bismuth status of patients receiving
      anti-H. pylori quadruple therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a prospective open
      label study 34 patients with nonulcer dyspepsia or peptic ulcer disease, who had 
      failed to eradicate H. pylori with standard triple therapy, were subsequently
      treated with CBS, omeprazole, amoxycillin and metronidazole (BOAM). A further 35 
      patients received triple therapy for the eradication of H. pylori: CBS,
      amoxycillin and metronidazole (BAM) (n = 18); placebo bismuth, amoxycillin and
      metronidazole (AM) (n = 9); or omeprazole, amoxycillin and metronidazole (OAM) (n
      = 8). Whole blood bismuth levels were determined before and within 24 hours of
      completing treatment. Analysis of bismuth was by inductively coupled plasma mass 
      spectrometry, and concentrations were compared between groups and with the
      Hillemand 'alarm level' for blood bismuth (50-100 microg/l). RESULTS: BOAM gave
      higher blood bismuth levels than BAM (difference in means 13.1, CI 6.0-20.2, p
      <.001); three (8.8%) patients taking BOAM had concentrations within the Hillemand
      alarm level at 54.2, 64.7 and 91.8 microg/l. OAM and AM did not alter baseline
      blood bismuth levels. CONCLUSIONS: Caution should be observed in prescribing CBS 
      with gastric acid suppression, and alternative bismuth preparations should be
      considered.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori and early duodenal ulcer status post-treatment: a review.
PG  - 84-92
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data submitted to the FDA were reviewed to analyze the relationship
      between Helicobacter pylori infection and the incidence of early duodenal ulcers,
      within 6 weeks, following treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective
      analyzes were performed on data from three H. pylori development programs
      submitted to the FDA: ranitidine-bismuth-citrate (RBC), lansoprazole (L) and
      omeprazole (O). Efficacy assessments for the RBC, L and O programs were made at
      end of a 4-week treatment period, 4-6 weeks following the end of a 14-day
      treatment period, and 4 weeks following the end of a 4-week treatment period,
      respectively. RESULTS: Overall, there was a 15%, 21% and 23% decrease in the
      number of patients in the RBC, L and O programs, respectively, with ulcers among 
      H. pylori cleared/eradicated patients post-treatment compared with patients with 
      persistent infection. Among patients who did not have cleared/eradicated H.
      pylori in the RBC and O programs, where antisecretory agents were continued
      beyond the antimicrobial treatment period, the number of ulcers was lower in the 
      antisecretory plus antimicrobial subgroups compared with the antimicrobial alone 
      subgroups (37% vs. 46% for RBC and 33% vs. 42% for O). Among patients with
      cleared/eradicated H. pylori, the number of patients with ulcers in the
      antimicrobial alone subgroups and antisecretory plus antimicrobial subgroups were
      similar within each program. Antimicrobials alone had significantly lower rates
      of ulcers among patients with cleared/eradicated H. pylori as compared with
      patients without clearance/eradication. CONCLUSIONS: The early incidence of
      duodenal ulcers is significantly decreased in patients with H. pylori
      clearance/eradication.

TI  - What is the optimal length of proton pump inhibitor-based triple therapies for H.
      pylori? A cost-effectiveness analysis.
PG  - 1067-76
AB  - BACKGROUND: Triple therapy with a proton pump inhibitor, clarithromycin and
      amoxicillin is widely used for H. pylori infection. The appropriate length of
      treatment remains controversial. AIM: To determine whether length of treatment
      has an impact on the cost-effectiveness of triple therapy. METHODS: The study
      took the form of a cost-effectiveness analysis spanning 2 years. The perspective 
      was societal and the setting, ambulatory care. Subjects were Helicobacter
      pylori-positive patients with a duodenal ulcer. The triple therapy trials spanned
      7, 10 or 14 days and the main outcome measures were cost per patient and marginal
      cost for additional cured patient calculated for a low cost-of-care setting
      (Spain), for a high-cost setting (USA), and for two follow-up strategies: (i)
      systematic 13C-urea breath test after eradication; (ii) clinical follow-up,
      breath-test if symptoms recurred. RESULTS: Base-case analysis showed that for
      both the 13C-UBT and the clinical follow-up branches, lowest costs were obtained 
      with 7-day schedules both in Spain and the USA. Sensitivity analysis showed that 
      in Spain, 10-day therapies would have to increase 7-day cure rates by 10-12% to
      become cost-effective. In contrast, in the USA only a 3-5% increase was needed.
      The corresponding figures for 14-day therapy were 25-35% and 8-11%, respectively.
      CONCLUSIONS: Seven-day therapies seem the most cost-effective strategy. However, 
      in high-cost areas the differences were less evident.

TI  - Modified seven-day, quadruple therapy as a first line Helicobacter pylori
      treatment.
PG  - 1061-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cure rates of 7-day triple therapy seem to be decreasing. Quadruple
      therapies may be an alternative, although their complex administration makes
      patient acceptance difficult. OBJECTIVE: To test the usefulness of a thrice a
      day, quadruple therapy to cure Helicobacter pylori infection. PATIENTS AND
      METHODS: A total of 122 consecutive patients with peptic ulcer and Helicobacter
      pylori infection were treated with omeprazole 20 mg b.d., tetracycline
      chlorhydrate 500 mg t.d.s., metronidazole 500 mg t.d.s., and bismuth subcitrate
      120 mg t.d.s. administered with meals for 7 days. Cure was tested by either
      endoscopy or breath test after 2 months, and by urea breath test 6 months after
      therapy. RESULTS: Seven patients were lost to follow-up. Of the remaining 115,
      110 were cured at the first control, giving an intention-to-treat cure rate of
      90.2% (95% CI: 83-95%) and a per protocol cure rate of 95.7% (95% CI: 90-98%).
      One hundred three patients returned for a 6-month breath test; all but one were
      cured. Side-effects were minimal or minor in 47 patients (40.8%) and moderate in 
      four (3.4%). Compliance was good, 95% of patients taking more than 90% of the
      pills. Six (5%) patients stopped treatment after 1, 2, 4 (two patients) and 6
      (two patients) days. CONCLUSION: Thrice a day quadruple therapy shows excellent
      cure rates, far above 90%, is well-tolerated and compliance is easy. Head-to-head
      comparison with triple therapies as first line Helicobacter pylori treatment
      seems warranted.

TI  - Is a one-week course of triple anti-Helicobacter pylori therapy sufficient to
      control active duodenal ulcer?
PG  - 1037-45
AB  - BACKGROUND: Triple therapy currently forms the cornerstone of the treatment of
      patients with Helicobacter pylori-positive duodenal ulcer. AIM: To establish
      whether prolonged antisecretory therapy is necessary in patients with active
      duodenal ulcer. METHODS: A total of 77 patients with H. pylori-positive duodenal 
      ulcer were included in a prospective, controlled, double-blind study. All
      patients received a 7-day treatment with omeprazole 20 mg b.d., clarithromycin
      500 mg b.d. and amoxicillin 1000 mg b.d. Patients in the omeprazole group
      underwent an additional 14-day therapy with omeprazole 20 mg; patients in placebo
      group received placebo. Endoscopy was performed upon inclusion in the study and
      after 3 and 8 weeks. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients were eligible for a per
      protocol analysis after 3 weeks, and 65 after 8 weeks. After 3 weeks, the healing
      rate was 89% in the omeprazole group and 81% in the placebo group (P=0.51). After
      8 weeks, the ulcer healed in 97% of the patients in the total group (95% CI:
      92.7-100%). H. pylori was eradicated in 88% of patients in the omeprazole group
      and in 91% in the placebo group (P=1.0). No statistically significant differences
      between the groups were found in ulcer-related symptoms or in ulcer healing.
      CONCLUSION: In patients with H. pylori-positive duodenal ulcer, a 7-day triple
      therapy alone is sufficient to control the disease.

TI  - Cure of Helicobacter pylori infection in elderly patients: comparison of low
      versus high doses of clarithromycin in combination with amoxicillin and
      pantoprazole.
PG  - 1031-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Advancing age may influence clarithromycin's pharmacokinetics. No
      studies have yet compared the effects of different dosages of clarithromycin in
      combination with a proton pump inhibitor and amoxicillin in elderly patients.
      AIM: To compare the efficacy and tolerability of clarithromycin 250 mg vs.
      clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily (b.d.) in combination with pantoprazole and
      amoxicillin in elderly patients. METHODS: One hundred and fifty-four elderly
      patients with H. pylori-associated ulcer disease or chronic gastritis were
      consecutively randomized to receive pantoprazole 40 mg daily plus amoxicillin 1
      g, and either clarithromycin 250 mg b.d. (PAC 250) or clarithromycin 500 mg b.d. 
      (PAC 500). Two months after therapy, endoscopy and gastric biopsies were
      repeated. RESULTS: The cure rates of H. pylori infection in the PAC 250 and PAC
      500 groups were, respectively, 83% and 79% (ITT analysis) and 94% and 88% (PP
      analysis) (P=N.S.). Significant decreases in chronic gastritis activity both in
      the body (P < 0.00001) and the antrum (P < 0.0001) of the stomach were found in
      H. pylori-cured patients, independently of clarithromycin dosage. Four patients
      in PAC 250 (5%) and seven in PAC 500 (9%) reported adverse events (P=N.S.). One
      patient in PAC 250 (25%) and three in PAC 500 (43%) discontinued the study
      because of these drug-related side-effects (P=N.S.). CONCLUSIONS: In elderly
      patients, 1-week triple therapy with a proton pump inhibitor, amoxicillin and
      clarithromycin is a highly effective and well tolerated anti-H. pylori treatment.
      With this combination, clarithromycin at the lower dose of 250 mg b.d. achieved
      excel- lent cure rates and minimized adverse events and costs.

TI  - Economic analysis of four triple regimens for the treatment of Helicobacter
      pylori-related peptic ulcer disease in in-patient and out-patient settings in
      Hong Kong.
PG  - 1009-15
AB  - BACKGROUND: One-week triple regimens have been shown to be effective for the
      treatment of Helicobacter pylori-related peptic ulcer disease. AIM: To conduct an
      economic analysis of four triple regimens for the treatment of H. pylori-related 
      peptic ulcer disease from the perspective of a public health organization in Hong
      Kong. METHODS: Records of 200 patients with H. pylori-related peptic ulcer
      disease, who had previously participated in a randomized comparison of ranitidine
      bismuth citrate (RBC) with amoxicillin and clarithromycin (RAC), omeprazole with 
      amoxicillin and clarithromycin (OAC), RBC with metronidazole and tetracycline
      (RMT), or, colloidal bismuth subcitrate with metronidazole and tetracycline (BMT)
      in either in-patient or out-patient setting were reviewed. RESULTS: Fifty
      patients were excluded because of incomplete documentation or lack of peptic
      ulcer. In the out-patient group (n=72), the median direct costs of the RAC group 
      (HK $ 5094) were lower those of the BMT (HK $ 5400), RMT (HK $ 5394), or OAC (HK 
      $ 5440) groups, but the difference was significant only between the RAC and BMT
      groups (P < 0.05). In the in-patient group (n=78), the median direct costs of the
      RMT group (HK $ 8524) were significantly lower than those of the OAC (HK $ 13
      871) and RAC (HK $ 12 092) groups (P < 0.05), but were similar to those of the
      BMT group (HK $ 8758). CONCLUSIONS: RAC and RMT are the least costly regimens for
      out-patient and in-patient treatment, respectively, of H. pylori-related peptic
      ulcer disease in Hong Kong.

TI  - The new proton pump inhibitor esomeprazole is effective as a maintenance therapy 
      in GERD patients with healed erosive oesophagitis: a 6-month, randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study of efficacy and safety.
PG  - 927-35
AB  - BACKGROUND: Esomeprazole, the S-isomer of omeprazole, is the first proton pump
      inhibitor to be developed as an optical isomer. In patients with erosive
      oesophagitis, esomeprazole has produced significantly greater healing rates and
      improved symptom resolution vs. omeprazole. AIM: This study assesses the efficacy
      of esomeprazole for preventing relapse in patients with healed oesophagitis.
      METHODS: In this 6-month US multicentre randomized double-blind
      placebo-controlled trial, 375 Helicobacter pylori-negative patients with
      endoscopically healed oesophagitis received esomeprazole 40 mg, 20 mg, 10 mg, or 
      placebo once daily. The primary efficacy end-point was maintenance of healing at 
      6 months. Secondary end-points assessed changes in symptoms, and long-term safety
      and tolerability. RESULTS: Significantly (P < 0.001) more patients remained
      healed with esomeprazole 40 mg (87.9%), 20 mg (78.7%), or 10 mg (54.2%), than
      with placebo (29.1%). Relapse, when it occurred, was later with esomeprazole.
      Sustained resolution of heartburn was observed in the 40 mg and 20 mg groups;
      there was a high correlation between absence of heartburn and maintenance of
      healing. Adverse effects were mild, infrequent and not significantly different
      between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Esomeprazole is effective and well-tolerated in the 
      maintenance of healing of erosive oesophagitis. Esomeprazole 40 mg and 20 mg
      offer significant clinical benefit to patients.

TI  - Pantoprazole therapy in the long-term management of severe acid peptic disease:
      clinical efficacy, safety, serum gastrin, gastric histology, and endocrine cell
      studies.
PG  - 1767-76
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pantoprazole is the third proton pump inhibitor to become available.
      When this study was started, there were few data on its long-term use. Our aim
      was to investigate this aspect and, because powerful inhibitors of acid secretion
      can cause hypergastrinemia and, in experimental animals, enterochromaffin-like
      cell hyperplasia, we also monitored serum gastrin and endocrine cell histology.
      METHODS: One hundred fifty patients refractory to H2-receptor antagonists,
      running an aggressive course or with complications, were entered into a 5-yr
      treatment program. We performed serial endoscopy, checked for adverse events, and
      laboratory values. We also monitored serum gastrin, gastric endocrine cell
      histology, and antral and corpus gastritis. RESULTS: This report presents results
      from up to 3 yr of treatment. Cumulative healing on 40-80 mg of pantoprazole was 
      82% at 4 wk and 92% by 12 wk. Most patients became asymptomatic within 4 wk.
      Remission on maintenance treatment with 40 mg (n = 111) was 85% at 12 months and 
      78% at 24 months. Treatment was safe; only four patients had adverse events
      definitely related to pantoprazole. Elevations in gastrin were modest and there
      were no significant changes in gastric endocrine cells. The number of
      enterochromaffin-like cells tended to decrease. CONCLUSION: Pantoprazole is
      effective, safe, and does not seem to be associated with large increases in serum
      gastrin or alterations in gastric endocrine cells.

TI  - Management of heartburn in a large, randomized, community-based study: comparison
      of four therapeutic strategies.
PG  - 1704-10
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to compare four management strategies for heartburn:
      therapy with an H2-receptor antagonist (ranitidine), therapy with a proton pump
      inhibitor (lansoprazole), crossover from ranitidine to lansoprazole ("step-up"
      therapy), and crossover from lansoprazole to ranitidine ("step-down" therapy).
      METHODS: This was a controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial comprising 593
      adults with heartburn, randomized to one of four groups for 20 wk. Subjects
      received either ranitidine 150 mg b.i.d. for 20 wk, or lansoprazole 30 mg once
      daily for 20 wk, or ranitidine 150 mg b.i.d. for 8 wk [corrected] followed by
      lansoprazole 30 mg once daily for 12 wk ("step-up"), or lansoprazole 30 mg once
      daily for 8 wk followed by ranitidine 150 mg b.i.d. for 12 wk ("step-down").
      Outcome measures were based on self-reports in daily diaries of 24-h heartburn
      severity, measured by maximum daytime and nighttime severity, and percentage of
      24-h heartburn-free days measured by absence of both daytime and nighttime
      heartburn. RESULTS: Median heartburn severity was significantly lower (p < 0.05) 
      for lansoprazole (0.25) than the other groups (0.46 ranitidine, 0.44 "step-up,"
      0.35 "step-down"). The lansoprazole group had a significantly higher percentage
      of 24-h heartburn-free days (median 81.4%, p < 0.01) than other groups (66.6,
      66.9, and 73.6%, respectively). In the "step-up" and "step-down" groups,
      heartburn was less severe, and percentages of 24-h heartburn-free days were
      higher during lansoprazole treatment regardless of treatment sequence.
      CONCLUSION: Proton pump inhibitor treatment provides more consistent heartburn
      relief than an H2-receptor antagonist, or "step-up" or "step-down" therapy.

TI  - Proton-pump inhibitors for acute peptic ulcer bleeding.
PG  - 730-40
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the use of proton-pump inhibitors for acute peptic ulcer
      bleeding. DATA SOURCES: Articles were obtained through computerized searches of
      MEDLINE (1966-September 2000). Additionally, several textbooks containing
      information on the diagnosis and management of acute peptic ulcer bleeding were
      reviewed. The bibliographies of retrieved publications and textbooks were
      reviewed for additional references. STUDY SELECTION: All randomized studies and
      pharmacoeconomic evaluations that used proton-pump inhibitor therapy for acute
      peptic ulcer bleeding were included. Randomized controlled trials and
      meta-analyses involving other therapies for treating peptic ulcer bleeding were
      also reviewed for possible inclusion. DATA EXTRACTION: The primary outcomes
      extracted from the literature were persistent or recurrent bleeding, transfusion 
      requirements, need for endoscopic intervention or surgery, length of stay, and
      mortality. DATA SYNTHESIS: Data from double-blind, placebo-controlled trials
      involving more than 1000 patients demonstrate that short-term, high-dose
      omeprazole therapy is effective for reducing bleeding and transfusion
      requirements in patients with acute peptic ulcer bleeding. The patients most
      likely to benefit from this therapy are hospitalized patients at high risk for
      rebleeding and patients in whom endoscopic evaluation must be delayed or is
      unavailable. CONCLUSIONS: Omeprazole (and likely other proton-pump inhibitors) is
      useful in reducing bleeding and transfusion requirements in patients with acute
      peptic ulcer bleeding, although better delineation of appropriate candidates is
      needed.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori and symptomatic relapse of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease:
      a randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 1738-42
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is little information on the effects of Helicobacter pylori
      eradication in patients with a primary diagnosis of gastro-oesophageal reflux
      disease (GORD). Our aim was to investigate the effect of H pylori eradication in 
      this group of patients. METHODS: We did a double-blind, randomised,
      placebo-controlled study in 70 patients with GORD. We assigned individuals to
      three groups. All patients received lansoprazole 30 mg twice daily for 10 days,
      followed by 30 mg once daily for 8 weeks. Patients infected with H pylori
      received either antibiotics (clarithromycin 500 mg and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice 
      daily) or placebo for the first 10 days. Controls were patients not infected with
      H pylori. Patients were followed up for 6 months at 2-week intervals for GORD
      symptoms. At the end of the study we repeated endoscopy and oesophageal and
      gastric 24 h-pH monitoring. FINDINGS: 58 of 70 patients completed our study. At
      the end of the study 16 of these patients were H pylori-positive (14 placebo and 
      two eradication failures), 13 were negative because of successful H pylori
      eradication, and 29 were controls. H pylori-positive patients relapsed earlier
      (54 days) than did those in whom H pylori was eradicated (100 days) (p=0.046).
      The H pylori-negative control group relapsed after the longest period (110 days).
      However, time to relapse was also affected by oesophagitis grade (no oesophagitis
      127 days, grade III or IV oesophagitis 18 days). When results were corrected for 
      the affect of oesophagitis grade, H pylori-positive patients relapsed earlier
      (p=0.086) than H pylori-eradiated patients and controls (p=0.001).
      INTERPRETATION: H pylori infection positively affects the relapse rate of GORD.
      Eradication of H pylori could, therefore, help to prolong disease-free interval
      in patients with GORD.

TI  - Pantoprazole.
PG  - 999-1008
AB  - The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, and
      dosage and administration of pantoprazole are reviewed. Pantoprazole is a gastric
      hydrogen-potassium adenosine triphosphatase (H+/K(+)-ATPase) inhibitor. It shares
      the same core structure as other currently available proton-pump inhibitors
      (PPIs). The FDA-labeled indication is the short-term treatment of erosive
      esophagitis. PPIs act by selectively inhibiting H+/K(+)-ATPase in the secretory
      canaliculus of the stimulated parietal cell. Understanding the pharmacodynamics
      of PPIs is more relevant than knowing their pharmacokinetics, since the duration 
      of action depends on the rate of de novo proton-pump regeneration, not the
      duration of drug circulation in the body. Pantoprazole is well absorbed,
      undergoes little first-pass metabolism, and has an absolute bioavailability of
      approximately 77%. Pantoprazole has been evaluated in more than 100 clinical
      trials involving more than 11,000 patients. It is effective in treating erosive
      esophagitis and duodenal and gastric ulcers. It is also effective as adjunctive
      treatment with antimicrobials in patients infected with Helicobacter pylori.
      Pantoprazole has been shown to control acid production in Zollinger-Ellison
      syndrome. Pantoprazole is well tolerated. The most commonly reported adverse
      effects are headache, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. The recommended oral dosage
      for erosive esophagitis is 40 mg once a day for up to eight weeks. The
      recommended i.v. dose is 40 mg given over 15 minutes once a day in patients with 
      gastroesophageal reflux disease who are unable to take oral medication.
      Pantoprazole appears to be as safe and effective as other PPIs in acid-related
      disorders.

TI  - Lansoprazole-based triple therapy versus ranitidine bismuth citrate-based dual
      therapy in the eradication of Helicobacter pylori in patients with duodenal
      ulcer: a multicenter, randomized, double-dummy study.
PG  - 761-70
AB  - BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment regimen for eradication of Helicobacter pylori 
      in patients with duodenal ulcer has yet to be determined. Based on a search of
      MEDLINE, no studies have been performed comparing a proton pump inhibitor-based
      triple therapy regimen with a ranitidine bismuth citrate (RBC)-based dual therapy
      regimen, both containing clarithromycin. OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to 
      compare the efficacy of lansoprazole (LAN)-based triple therapy with that of
      RBC-based dual therapy in H pylori-infected patients with duodenal ulcer.
      METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive either 1 week of triple therapy with
      LAN 30 mg BID, clarithromycin 500 mg BID, and tinidazole 500 mg BID, followed by 
      3 weeks of LAN 30 mg BID, or 2 weeks of dual therapy with RBC 400 mg BID plus
      clarithromycin 500 mg BID, followed by 2 weeks of RBC 400 mg BID. Eradication of 
      H pylori was defined as negative results on both the urease quick test and
      histologic examination > or =4 weeks after the end of treatment. Duodenal healing
      and recurrence rates were assessed endoscopically at 8 weeks and 6 months. A
      per-protocol (PP) analysis was conducted for each efficacy end point. Also
      conducted were an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis in which patients with missing
      data were considered failures, and an observed analysis (OBS), which included
      patients with an evaluable result after treatment, regardless of compliance.
      RESULTS: One hundred eighty-five patients (126 men, 59 women; age range, 18-76
      years; mean age, 43 years) were enrolled and randomized to treatment. In the LAN 
      and RBC groups, respectively, H. pylori eradication rates were 92.6%, 93.1%, and 
      72.8% versus 78.6%, 77.9%, and 64.5% in the PP (P = 0.02), OBS (P = 0.01), and
      ITT analyses. The corresponding duodenal ulcer healing rates were 98.6%, 98.7%,
      and 83.7% versus 90.8%, 91.5%, and 81.7%; these differences were not
      statistically significant. Side effects were mild, occurring in 20.7% of LAN
      patients and 17.2% of RBC patients. Ulcer recurred in 2 RBC patients. No
      difference was observed between treatments in terms of the occurrence of
      gastritis or improvement of symptoms. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of the PP 
      and OBS analyses, LAN-based triple therapy was superior to RBC-based dual therapy
      for the eradication of H. pylori in patients with duodenal ulcer.

TI  - A review of omeprazole use in the treatment of acid-related disorders in
      children.
PG  - 660-79; discussion 645
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acid peptic disease is a common problem, with a similar prevalence of
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in adults and children. The presentation
      of GERD in infants and children varies from crying, irritability, or sleep
      disturbance to feeding difficulties, vomiting, or rumination. Helicobacter pylori
      (HP)-related diseases and gastric and duodenal ulcers are much more common in
      adults than in children, who are more likely to have gastritis or duodenitis.
      However, because HP infection is most likely acquired in childhood, treatment of 
      children with endoscopically documented active HP disease may minimize the
      potential risk for peptic ulcer or gastric cancer in adulthood, although this is 
      yet to be proved. OBJECTIVE: Omeprazole has been shown to be effective in the
      treatment of acid-related diseases. This paper reviews the literature on the use 
      and administration of omeprazole for the treatment of GERD, peptic ulcer disease,
      HP infection, and other acid-related conditions in children. METHODS: Studies
      were identified through searches of MEDLINE and Science Citation Index for the
      period 1986 to November 2000, and from the reference lists of identified
      articles. The search terms used included omeprazole, proton pump inhibitor (PPI),
      children, pediatrics, routes of administration, GERD, HP infection, esophagitis, 
      and administration. In addition, the manufacturer of omeprazole was asked for
      relevant unpublished information. RESULTS: Marketed and extemporaneous
      formulations of omeprazole have been administered to children aged 2 months to 18
      years for the treatment of erosive esophagitis, gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, HP
      infection, and related conditions at dosages of 5 to 80 mg/d (0.2-3.5 mg/kg/d)
      for periods ranging from 14 days to 36 months with a low incidence of adverse
      effects. The initial dose most consistently reported to heal esophagitis and
      provide relief of symptoms of GERD appears to be 1 mg/kg per day. CONCLUSIONS: In
      uncontrolled clinical trials and case reports to date, omeprazole has been
      effective and well tolerated for the acute and chronic treatment of esophageal
      and peptic ulcer disease in children, particularly those who had failed to
      respond to previous treatment with histamine2-receptor antagonists. Should future
      long-term, controlled clinical trials in children demonstrate safety and
      efficacy, this PPI is likely to find a place in the armamentarium of pediatric
      pharmacotherapy.

TI  - Asthma and gastro-oesophageal reflux: can the response to anti-reflux therapy be 
      predicted?
PG  - 387-92
AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate which features predict favourable
      response to omeprazole therapy in asthmatics with gastro-oesophageal reflux
      (GER). The study population consisted of 52 outpatient asthmatics with GER who
      had completed an intervention where they were randomized to receive omeprazole 40
      mg once a day or placebo for 8 weeks. After a 2-week washout period the patients 
      were crossed over. Asthma symptoms were found to be relieved > or = 20% in 18
      (35%) patients who were thus regarded as responders. A logistic regression
      analysis was performed in order to identify which features separate the
      responders from the non-responders. More responders were found among the patients
      whose body mass index (BMI) was higher (P = 0.02) or whose distal esophageal
      reflux was more severe [total time (%) pH < 4 (P = 0.01) or time (%) pH < 4 in
      upright position (P = 0.04)]. Adding other predictors to the total time (%) pH < 
      4, which was the most significant predictor for response in multi-variate
      analysis, did not further increase the prediction for favourable outcome. It is
      concluded that severe distal oesophageal reflux and obesity predict amelioration 
      in asthma symptoms after 8-week omeprazole treatment in asthmatics with GER.
      Adding more than one predictor does not seem to further increase prediction for
      favourable asthma response.

TI  - [The effect of cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption on efficacy of
      Helicobacter pylori eradication].
PG  - 569-74
AB  - None of the drug regimens used to treat H. pylori infection ensures 100% of
      efficacy. One may think therefore that among factors modifying H. pylori
      eradication there are also cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption. The aim of 
      the study was to determine the influence of cigarette smoking and alcohol
      consumption on efficacy of H. pylori eradication. The study was conducted on 142 
      H. pylori positive peptic ulcer patients treated with either OAT-omeprazole (2 x 
      20 mg), amoxycillin (2 x 1000 mg), tinidazole (2 x 500 mg) (69 patients) or
      OAC-omeprazole (2 x 20 mg), amoxycillin (2 x 1000 mg), clarithromycin (2 x 250
      mg) (73 patients). Detailed information on smoking and drinking habits was
      obtained from a questionnaire fulfilled by all subjects. Patients were defined as
      smokers if smoked 5 or more cigarettes per day and as drinkers if drank 25 g or
      more alcohol per week. To enter the study patients had to have confirmed H.
      pylori infection by two tests (CLO-test and histology). Eradication was
      considered successful if both tests gave negative results 4-6 weeks after the
      cessation of treatment. The efficacy of H. pylori eradication was similar in both
      groups (OAT--69.6%, OAC--78.1%). Patients who smoked cigarettes had lower rate of
      H. pylori eradication in OAC group (smokers 65.8%, non-smokers 91.4%, p < 0.01), 
      while patients who drank alcohol had higher eradication rate in OAT group
      (drinkers 85.2%, non-drinkers 59.5%, p < 0.05). When two factors (smoking,
      drinking) were analyzed together, it was found that in drinkers treated with OAT,
      smoking did not change the efficacy of H. pylori eradication, while in
      non-drinkers decreased by two times (75.0% vs 38.9%, p < 0.02). In drinkers
      treated with OAC, smoking did not change the efficacy of H. pylori eradication
      (but this was likely related to the limited number of patients), while decreased 
      it in non-drinkers from 90.0% to 65.2% (p < 0.05). When two groups were analyzed 
      together (OAT + OAC), the lowest efficacy of H. pylori eradication exhibited
      smokers who do not drink (53.7%) followed by smokers who drink (75.8%),
      non-smokers who do not drink (83.3%) and non-smokers who drink (92.9%); in each
      case the efficacy of eradication was higher than in smokers who do not drink (p <
      0.05, p < 0.01, p < 0.01, respectively). Both cigarette smoking and alcohol
      consumption can affect the efficacy of H. pylori eradication. Smoking and
      drinking habits should be taken into account, when the set of drugs for H. pylori
      eradication is chosen.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori: diagnostics and management in peptic ulcer disease: a
      review.
PG  - 152-8
AB  - The management of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) has progressed markedly over the
      past century. Thanks to the discovery of Helicobacter pylori, our treatment focus
      has shifted from antacids and H2 antagonists to proton pump inhibitors and
      antimicrobial agents. Despite these advances, many treatment issues remain
      ambiguous. Some of the most controversial issues include management of the
      infection at a general practice level, particularly whom to treat, which regimens
      are most effective, and which diagnostic criteria (if any) should be used. This
      article will provide a brief description of available diagnostic modalities and
      summarize recent research findings on optimal testing techniques and treatment in
      primary care.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori-negative duodenal ulcers: prevalence, clinical
      characteristics, and prognosis--results from a randomized trial with 2-year
      follow-up.
PG  - 1409-16
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The proportion of Helicobacter pylori-negative duodenal ulcer disease 
      appears to be increasing. Data on clinical outcome and prognosis in this subgroup
      are lacking. METHODS: Two hundred seventy-six duodenal ulcer patients randomized,
      irrespective of H. pylori status, to either eradication therapy or maintenance
      omeprazole (double-blind, double-dummy design) for 1 yr were studied. Patients
      were followed up for a total of 2 yr, with visits performed every 2 months the
      first year and every 6 months the following year. Endoscopies for assessment of
      ulcer relapse were done at 6 and 12 months or in the event of symptomatic
      relapse. H. pylori status was assessed by culture, immunohistochemistry, and urea
      breath test at entry, at 6, 12, and 24 months or at failure. The primary endpoint
      was discontinuation, irrespective of reason. Patients were considered H. pylori
      negative if all three tests were negative. Patients were considered H.
      pylori-positive if any of the three diagnostic tests were positive. Study staff
      were blinded to H. pylori results. RESULTS: Thirty-two (12%) patients were H.
      pylori negative at entry. There were no differences according to H. pylori status
      for a number of clinical and demographic characteristics. However, H.
      pylori-negative patients had a shorter history of ulcer symptoms and were more
      likely to be NSAID users (19% vs 1%, p < 0.001). Only 28% of the H.
      pylori-negative patients completed the study, as compared with 40% of H.
      pylori-positive patients (p = 0.0005). The main reasons for the poorer prognosis 
      in H. pylori-negative patients were relapse of ulcer/ulcer not healed (35% vs
      26%) and relapse of severe dyspepsia symptoms without ulcer relapse (16% vs 7%). 
      H. pylori-negative patients randomized to eradication therapy left the study
      early compared with H. pylori-negative patients randomized to long-term
      omeprazole therapy. Outcome in omeprazole-treated patients did not differ
      according to H. pylori status (p = 0.3). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical characteristics in
      H. pylori-negative and positive duodenal ulcer patients differ little. Clinical
      outcome over 2 yr is significantly poorer in H. pylori-negative patients,
      especially if treated empirically with eradication therapy. These results suggest
      that H. pylori infection should be assessed in all duodenal ulcer patients before
      treatment is decided.

TI  - Medical therapy versus antireflux surgery in Barrett's esophagus: what is the
      best therapeutic approach?
PG  - 224-31
AB  - We conducted a review of the literature comparing medical treatment with
      antireflux surgery in patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE). In particular, we
      wanted to assess the efficacy of medical and surgical therapies in preventing the
      progression of Barrett's epithelium to dysplasia or adenocarcinoma of the
      esophagus. In general, few BE patients show complete regression of BE epithelium 
      following medical or surgical therapy. The incidence of developing dysplasia or
      cancer following surgical therapy appears to be less than with medical therapy;
      however, there is an insufficient number of current, randomized controlled
      studies to confirm this. Surveillance of BE is required regardless of treatment. 
      This review suggests that there may be a trend in support of surgery being
      somewhat better than medical therapy in the prevention of BE progression and
      adenocarcinoma. We suggest that patients with BE should be considered for
      antireflux surgery - in particular, certain subgroups of BE patients.

TI  - What is the optimal medical therapy for Barrett's esophagus?
PG  - 217-23
AB  - The development of Barrett's esophagus (BE) in patients with gastroesophageal
      reflux disease (GERD) is troubling because of its known association with
      esophageal cancer. When evaluated clinically, patients with BE have the severest 
      form of GERD and require aggressive therapy to control esophageal acid exposure. 
      Both hypotension of the lower esophageal sphincter and the extent of esophageal
      acid exposure are major contributors to severe GERD and its complications. It is 
      hypothesized that better control of acid will improve outcomes for BE patients.
      While it is clear that therapy (medical or surgical) for reflux rarely if ever
      results in total regression of BE, there are some limited data to support
      improvement in BE with control of reflux. Current medical choices include
      prokinetic agents, histamine type-2 receptor antagonists, and proton pump
      inhibitors. In the future, genetic markers may be used in identifying BE patients
      at the greatest risk for histologic progression, and chemoprevention with
      cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors may be a therapeutic option. This paper will review
      the rationale for and results of medical antireflux therapy in patients with BE.

TI  - Reduction of acid exposure and regression of Barrett's esophagus.
PG  - 203-7
AB  - The goals of treatment of Barrett's esophagus (BE) include relieving reflux
      symptoms, healing inflammatory lesions, and preventing esophageal adenocarcinoma.
      Reduction of acid reflux is believed to prevent progression of BE. A critical
      question is whether or not regression of BE occurs in response to therapy with
      proton pump inhibitors. The natural history of BE is altered both by the use of
      medications (over-the-counter or prescribed) and by endoscopic surveillance with 
      periodic biopsies. Regression occurs when the length and surface area of BE
      decreases, along with the emergence of islands of squamous epithelium in the BE
      segment. However, the extent of regression is difficult to assess because
      intestinal metaplasia may underlie the islands of squamous epithelial regrowth.
      Sampling by endoscopic biopsy is useful in ruling out progression of BE to
      dysplasia or adenocarcinoma; however, complete regression of the lesion cannot be
      definitively proven by this technique. To date, published clinical trials of
      proton pump inhibitor therapy in patients with BE provide evidence of increases
      in squamous islands in the BE segment, but do not provide convincing data in
      support of complete regression of BE. In a review of prospective studies of the
      treatment of BE with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) (with or without surgery),
      only 3 of 123 patients had apparent complete reversal of BE. This article reviews
      the current understanding of regression in BE following treatment with PPIs.

TI  - Comparison of pantoprazole 20 mg to ranitidine 150 mg b.i.d. in the treatment of 
      mild gastroesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 163-70
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite a high prevalence of mild gastroesophageal reflux disease
      (GERD), few studies investigated efficacy and safety of proton pump inhibitors in
      this indication. This randomized double-blind study compares pantoprazole to
      ranitidine in GERD 0 and I, i.e. reflux without esophagitis or with confined
      lesions only. METHODS: Patients received either pantoprazole 20 mg o.a.d. or
      ranitidine 150 mg b.i.d. Outcome was assessed after 2 and 4 weeks. Primary
      criterion was relief of leading symptoms, i.e. heartburn, acid eructation and
      pain on swallowing, after 4 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: According to the
      per-protocol (PP) analysis, 69% (100/144) and 80% (115/144) of patients in the
      pantoprazole group were relieved of leading symptoms after 2 and 4 weeks,
      respectively. The rates in the ranitidine group were 47% (62/133) and 65%
      (86/133). Thus, superiority of pantoprazole could be proven. Quality-of-life
      parameters improved more in the pantoprazole group and patients' assessment of
      treatment was more favorable. Analysis for Helicobacter pylori status showed
      infection to lead to higher symptom relief rates. Both study medications were
      well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Pantoprazole 20 mg demonstrated superior efficacy
      with faster relief of reflux symptoms and similar tolerability compared to
      ranitidine 150 mg in the treatment of mild GERD.

TI  - Low incidence of Helicobacter pylori infection in patients with duodenal ulcer
      and chronic liver disease.
PG  - 479-84
AB  - BACKGROUND: Duodenal ulcer (DU) is a common problem in patients with chronic
      liver disease (CLD) and with inadequate response to H2 receptor antagonists.
      Omeprazole might be more effective. In DU-CLD patients, Helicobacter pylori
      prevalence is low. Nitric oxide is increased in gastric mucosa in cirrhosis.
      Oxygen-free radicals have a role in gastric inflammation and are abnormal in CLD.
      Nitrotyrosine is a marker of nitric oxide and oxygen-free radical toxic mucosal
      reaction. METHODS: Sixty-nine patients were divided into 2 groups: control (26
      patients with DU) and CLD groups (43 patients, DU-CLD). Omeprazole was given (40 
      mg/day) for 2 or 4 weeks. Symptoms and endoscopy findings were recorded before
      and after treatment. Antral biopsy specimens were stained for H. pylori and
      nitrotyrosine. RESULTS: Clinical features of DU are similar in patients with and 
      without CLD. The main presentation was epigastric pain (70%) and bleeding (23%). 
      Healing rate with omeprazole was higher in DU-CLD patients (90.7%) than in
      controls (80.8%). H. pylori was much lower in DU-CLD patients (51.2%) than
      controls (96.2%). Nitrotyrosine staining was negative in normal controls (0%) and
      positive in control-DU (100%), CLD-H. pylori positive (81%), and CLD-H. pylori
      negative (91%) cases. CONCLUSIONS: DU in patients with CLD is not different
      clinically from those without CLD. Omeprazole effectively and safely treats DU in
      CLD. Nitric oxide and free oxygen radicals may result in gastric mucosal changes 
      in CLD similar to that caused by H. pylori.

TI  - Long-term outcome of medical and surgical therapies for gastroesophageal reflux
      disease: follow-up of a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 2331-8
AB  - CONTEXT: Severe gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a lifelong problem that
      can be complicated by peptic esophageal stricture and adenocarcinoma of the
      esophagus. OBJECTIVE: To determine the long-term outcome of medical and surgical 
      therapies for GERD. DESIGN AND SETTING: Follow-up study conducted from October
      1997 through October 1999 of a prospective randomized trial of medical and
      surgical antireflux treatments in patients with complicated GERD. Mean (median)
      duration of follow-up was 10.6 years (7.3 years) for medical patients and 9.1
      years (6.3 years) for surgical patients. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred thirty-nine
      (97%) of the original 247 study patients were found (79 were confirmed dead).
      Among the 160 survivors (157 men and 3 women; mean [SD] age, 67 [12] years), 129 
      (91 in the medical treatment group and 38 in the surgical treatment group)
      participated in the follow-up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Use of antireflux
      medication, Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Activity Index (GRACI) scores, grade 
      of esophagitis, frequency of treatment of esophageal stricture, frequency of
      subsequent antireflux operations, 36-item Short Form health survey (SF-36)
      scores, satisfaction with antireflux therapy, survival, and incidence of
      esophageal adenocarcinoma, compared between the medical antireflux therapy group 
      and the fundoplication surgery group. Information on cause of death was obtained 
      from autopsy results, hospital records, and death certificates. RESULTS:
      Eighty-three (92%) of 90 medical patients and 23 (62%) of 37 surgical patients
      reported that they used antireflux medications regularly (P<.001). During a
      1-week period after discontinuation of medication, mean (SD) GRACI symptom scores
      were significantly lower in the surgical treatment group (82.6 [17.5] vs 96.7
      [21.4] in the medical treatment group; P =.003). However, no significant
      differences between the groups were found in grade of esophagitis, frequency of
      treatment of esophageal stricture and subsequent antireflux operations, SF-36
      standardized physical and mental component scale scores, and overall satisfaction
      with antireflux therapy. Survival during a period of 140 months was decreased
      significantly in the surgical vs the medical treatment group (relative risk of
      death in the medical group, 1.57; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-2.46; P =.047),
      largely because of excess deaths from heart disease. Patients with Barrett
      esophagus at baseline developed esophageal adenocarcinomas at an annual rate of
      0.4%, whereas these cancers developed in patients without Barrett esophagus at an
      annual rate of only 0.07%. There was no significant difference between groups in 
      incidence of esophageal cancer. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that antireflux
      surgery should not be advised with the expectation that patients with GERD will
      no longer need to take antisecretory medications or that the procedure will
      prevent esophageal cancer among those with GERD and Barrett esophagus.

TI  - The association between antiulcer medication and initiation of cobalamin
      replacement in older persons.
PG  - 531-4
AB  - As chronic use of antiulcer medications might predispose older persons to
      cobalamin deficiency, we studied participants (> 65 years) in the clinical
      examination of the Canadian Study of Health and Aging to test the association
      between the use of an antiulcer medication (histamine-2 blocker or proton pump
      inhibitor) at baseline with initiation of cobalamin replacement during the 5 year
      follow-up period. Of 1054 eligible subjects, 125 (11.7%) were taking an antiulcer
      medication at baseline. At follow-up, 49 (4.6%) had started cobalamin
      replacement. Antiulcer medication use at baseline was significantly associated
      with the initiation of cobalamin therapy (odds ratio 2.56, 95% confidence
      interval 1.30-5.05), even after adjusting for age, gender and institutional
      residence (odds ratio 2.61, 95% confidence interval 1.31-5.23). There is an
      independent association between the use of antiulcer medication and initiation of
      cobalamin therapy. While the relationship is not unambiguously causal, this
      finding underscores the need for judicious prescribing of antiulcer medications
      for older persons.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori infection--current treatment practice.
PG  - 253-66
AB  - Helicobacter pylori infection, which is present in 30 - 60% of the population in 
      developed countries and in more than 60% in developing countries, is established 
      to be a major cause of gastritis, peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer.
      Eradication therapy has been incorporated into clinical practice over the past 15
      years. Treatment regimens include a 2 week bismuth-based triple therapy (a
      bismuth compound plus metronidazole, tetracycline or amoxycillin), a 1 week
      proton-pump inhibitor (PPI)-based triple therapy and a 1 week ranitidine bismuth 
      citrate (RBC)-based triple therapy (a PPI or RBC plus any two of the three
      antibiotics, metronidazole, amoxycillin and clarithromycin). These regimens
      achieve eradication rates of >> 80%. H. pylori resistance to metronidazole and
      clarithromycin decreases the clinical efficacy of most regimens, despite the high
      eradication rates for resistant strains achieved by the RBC-triple therapy in
      some recent trials. The dose of antibiotics (especially clarithromycin) and the
      duration of treatment may also influence the eradication rate. Doctors' beliefs
      impact on clinical practice and, thus, influence the clinical application of
      eradication therapy. Whereas peptic ulcer disease and primary gastric low-grade
      B-cell mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (MALToma) have become
      established as definite indications for eradication therapy, there remain
      controversies surrounding non-ulcer dyspepsia, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease,
      atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs (NSAIDs) and H. pylori-related extradigestive diseases.

TI  - COX-2 inhibitors vs. NSAIDs in gastrointestinal damage and prevention.
PG  - 31-40
AB  - Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit production of protective
      gastric mucosal prostaglandins and also have a direct topical irritant effect. In
      some patients this results in dyspepsia and development of gastroduodenal
      erosions and ulceration. The risk of ulcer complications, such as bleeding,
      perforation and death is increased approximately 4-fold in NSAID users. Patients 
      at high risk of ulcer complications include the elderly, those taking
      anticoagulants, steroids and aspirin, those with a previous history of peptic
      ulceration and patients with concomitant serious medical problems. The
      interaction of NSAIDs with Helicobacter pylori (the major cause of peptic
      ulceration in non-NSAID users) is controversial and some studies suggest that H. 
      pylori infection may even protect against NSAID-induced ulceration. Selective
      inhibitors of the inducible cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme spare COX-1 in the
      gastric mucosa and, hence, do not inhibit production of mucosal prostaglandins.
      COX-2-selective inhibitors are associated with a significant reduction in
      gastroduodenal damage compared with traditional NSAIDs. Proton pump inhibitors
      (PPI) are probably the best agents for healing and prevention of NSAID-induced
      ulcers. Preliminary studies suggest that COX-2 selective inhibitors, like
      traditional NSAIDs, may prevent lower gastrointestinal cancer. Further studies
      are needed but they may be useful in individuals at high risk of certain types of
      lower gastrointestinal malignancy with increased gastrointestinal tolerability
      and safety.

TI  - Update in the pharmacological management of peptic ulcer haemorrhage.
PG  - 337-42
AB  - The management of peptic ulcer haemorrhage still poses questions and
      controversies and this applies to the pharmacological mode. This review suggests 
      that high-dose acid suppression is beneficial in reducing rebleeding and surgery 
      rates. The choice of acid suppressant is far from conclusive, but emerging
      evidence suggests that proton pump inhibitors may be more effective than
      H2-antagonists. The only other drug which may be useful in selected patients is
      octreotide, but its universal use cannot be recommended.

TI  - Control of intragastric pH with omeprazole 20 mg, omeprazole 40 mg and
      lansoprazole 30 mg.
PG  - 647-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: Single daily doses of proton pump inhibitors, omeprazole and
      lansoprazole provide effective acid suppression and equal healing and symptom
      relief in patients with GERD. Despite this, controversy exists as to the efficacy
      of available proton pump inhibitors in the control of gastric acidity. AIM: To
      assess the efficacy of omeprazole 20 mg vs. lansoprazole 30 mg and omeprazole 40 
      mg vs. lansoprazole 30 mg in intragastric pH control. METHODS: Study I: 12
      Helicobacter pylori-negative volunteers (mean age 33 years) were treated with
      omeprazole 20 mg and lansoprazole 30 mg in random order before breakfast for 7
      days. Study II: 24 subjects (mean age 36 years) were similarly treated with
      omeprazole 40 mg and lansoprazole 30 mg for 7 days after a baseline pH study. One
      week washout was allowed between studies. Subjects had the same meal on each
      study day. On day seven, a 24-h intragastric pH study was performed. The
      percentage time for which gastric pH > 4 was analysed (Gastrosoft, Synectics
      Medical Inc.) and expressed as mean +/- s.d. RESULTS: (1) Omeprazole 20 mg and
      lansoprazole 30 mg showed no significant difference in the percentage time for
      which gastric pH > 4 in the daytime and night-time periods. (2) The percentage
      time for which pH > 4 with omeprazole 40 mg was significantly greater than
      lansoprazole 30 mg in both daytime (61 +/- 19% vs. 48 +/- 14%, P < 0.001), and
      night-time periods (34 +/- 21% vs. 26 +/- 14%, P < 0.05). (3) A large
      inter-subject variation existed in both studies. (4) In 10 subjects who
      participated in both studies, omeprazole 40 mg showed a significantly higher
      percentage time for which pH > 4 in the daytime (69 +/- 18% vs. 51 +/- 15%,
      P=0.015) than omeprazole 20 mg. CONCLUSION: These pH data support the therapeutic
      equivalency of FDA approved doses of omeprazole and lansoprazole.

TI  - A systematic comparison of triple therapies for treatment of Helicobacter pylori 
      infection with proton pump inhibitor/ ranitidine bismuth citrate plus
      clarithromycin and either amoxicillin or a nitroimidazole.
PG  - 613-24
AB  - BACKGROUND: Triple therapies with proton pump inhibitor/ranitidine bismuth
      citrate (RBC), clarithromycin (C) and either amoxicillin (A) or a nitroimidazole 
      (I) are widely accepted as treatment for Helicobacter pylori infection. However, 
      it is not clear which of these antibiotic combinations should be preferred. AIM: 
      To evaluate whether there is a difference in efficacy between triple therapies
      with proton pump inhibitor/RBC, clarithromycin and either amoxicillin or a
      nitroimidazole. METHODS: The literature was examined for randomized trials
      comparing proton pump inhibitor/RBC-C-A and proton pump inhibitor/RBC-C-I.
      Studies were grouped according to the type of acid inhibitor used (proton pump
      inhibitor or RBC) and differences between pooled cure rates were calculated.
      RESULTS: Forty-seven studies were identified: seven using RBC, 39 using proton
      pump inhibitor, one using both. RBC-C-I was somewhat superior to RBC-C-A,
      although this difference only reached statistical significance in
      intention-to-treat analysis. Overall, proton pump inhibitor-C-I and proton pump
      inhibitor-C-A were equally effective, but in nitroimidazole-susceptible strains, 
      proton pump inhibitor-C-I performed better, in nitroimidazole-resistant strains, 
      proton pump inhibitor-C-A performed better. No serious side-effects were reported
      and pooled drop-out rates were equal. CONCLUSIONS: In general, proton pump
      inhibitor-C-I and proton pump inhibitor-C-A are equally effective and therefore
      other factors such as local prevalence of resistant strains, cost of therapy and 
      options for second-line treatment should determine which regimen should be
      preferred. When using RBC, the RBC-C-I combination is somewhat superior to
      RBC-C-A.

TI  - Lansoprazole treatment of patients with chronic idiopathic laryngitis: a
      placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 979-83
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Previous uncontrolled studies suggested a therapeutic benefit for
      treating gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) among patients with laryngitis.
      The present study is the first randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study
      of gastric acid suppression among patients with laryngitis in the United States. 
      METHODS: Patients diagnosed with idiopathic chronic laryngitis were randomized to
      receive either lansoprazole 30 mg p.o. b.i.d. or a matching placebo for 3 months.
      Before randomization, all patients underwent upper endoscopy, dual probe
      ambulatory 24-h esophageal pH-metry, and laryngoscopy, as well as completing a
      symptom questionnaire for GERD and laryngitis. The primary outcome of treatment
      was the complete resolution of laryngeal symptoms. RESULTS: A total of 22
      patients with symptoms and signs of chronic laryngitis were enrolled, 20 of whom 
      completed the study. At baseline, there were no significant differences between
      the two groups with regards to GERD symptoms, erosive esophagitis, proximal and
      distal esophageal pH-metry, or laryngeal signs and symptoms. In an
      intention-to-treat analysis, six patients in the lansoprazole group (50%) and
      only one patient (10%) in the placebo group achieved a complete symptomatic
      response, p = 0.04. Apart from receiving lansoprazole, there were no significant 
      differences between responders and nonresponders in any of baseline esophageal or
      laryngeal signs and symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Empirical treatment with lansoprazole 
      is efficacious in relieving symptoms of laryngitis compared to placebo. Such
      treatment can be considered as a first-line option in managing patients with
      idiopathic chronic laryngitis.

AB  - In summary, a variety of gastrointestinal processes may occur in the chronically 
      critically ill patient population, usually as consequence of the primary systemic
      process. The clinical presentation is frequently nonclassic and there often is a

TI  - GI complications in patients receiving mechanical ventilation.
PG  - 1222-41
AB  - Mechanical ventilation (MV) can be lifesaving by maintaining gas exchange until
      the underlying disorders are corrected, but it is associated with numerous
      organ-system complications, which can significantly affect the outcome of
      critically ill patients. Like other organ systems, GI complications may be
      directly attributable to MV, but most are a reflection of the severity of the
      underlying disease that required intensive care. The interactions of the
      underlying critical illness and MV with the GI tract are complex and can manifest
      in a variety of clinical pictures. Incorporated in this review are discussions of
      the most prevalent GI complications associated with MV, and current diagnosis and
      management of these problems.

TI  - Increased prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux symptoms in patients with COPD.
PG  - 1043-8
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux (GER)
      symptoms in patients with COPD and the association of GER symptoms with the
      severity of airways obstruction as assessed by pulmonary function tests (PFTs).
      DESIGN: Prospective questionnaire-based, cross-sectional analytic survey.
      SETTING: Outpatient pulmonary and general medicine clinics at a Veterans
      Administration hospital. PATIENTS: Patients with mild-to-severe COPD (n = 100)
      were defined based on American Thoracic Society criteria. The control group (n = 
      51) consisted of patients in the general medicine clinic without respiratory
      complaints or prior diagnosis of asthma or COPD. INTERVENTION: Both groups
      completed a modified version of the Mayo Clinic GER questionnaire. RESULTS:
      Compared to control subjects, a greater proportion of COPD patients had
      significant GER symptoms defined as heartburn and/or regurgitation once or more
      per week (19% vs 0%, respectively; p < 0.001), chronic cough (32% vs 16%; p =
      0.03), and dysphagia (17% vs 4%; p = 0.02). Among patients with COPD and
      significant GER symptoms, 26% reported respiratory symptoms associated with
      reflux events, whereas control subjects denied an association. Significant GER
      symptoms were more prevalent in COPD patients with FEV(1) < or %, as compared
      with patients with FEV(1) > 50% of predicted (23% vs 9%, respectively; p = 0.08).
      In contrast, PFT results were similar among COPD patients with and without GER
      symptoms. An increased number of patients with COPD utilized antireflux
      medications, compared to control subjects (50% vs 27%, respectively; p = 0.008). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The questionnaire demonstrated a higher prevalence of weekly GER
      symptoms in patients with COPD, as compared to control subjects. There was a
      trend toward higher prevalence of GER symptoms in patients with severe COPD;
      however, this difference did not reach statistical significance. We speculate
      that although GER may not worsen pulmonary function, greater expiratory airflow
      limitation may worsen GER symptoms in patients with COPD.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic study of esomeprazole in the elderly.
PG  - 145-50
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Esomeprazole is the first proton pump inhibitor to be developed as an 
      optical isomer for the treatment of patients with acid-related diseases. The aim 
      of this study was to examine the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of
      esomeprazole in the elderly, relative to middle-aged patients with
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). DESIGN: Nonblinded single-centre
      pharmacokinetic study with historical control group. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS:
      14 healthy elderly volunteers [mean age 74 (range 71 to 80) years]. METHODS:
      Participants received treatment with esomeprazole 40 mg once daily for 5 days,
      with 24-hour blood sampling on days 1 and 5. The total area under the plasma
      concentration-time curve (AUCinfinity), maximum plasma drug concentration (Cmax),
      terminal elimination half-life (t(1/2z)) and time to Cmax (tmax) were determined 
      for the parent drug and its hydroxy and sulphone metabolites. AUCinfinity and
      Cmax data were compared with those in an historical group of 36 middle-aged
      patients [mean age 45 (range 29 to 58) years] with GORD, treated with an
      identical dosage of esomeprazole for 5 days. RESULTS: A total of 13 volunteers
      completed the study. On day 5, the mean plasma AUCinfinity of esomeprazole was
      16.0 micromol x h/L, Cmax was 5.6 micromol/L, tmax was 1.5 hours and t(1/2z) was 
      1.7 hours. The AUCinfinity and Cmax values for the parent drug were 2- and
      1.5-fold higher on day 5 compared with day 1. AUCinfinity and Cmax values for the
      sulphone metabolite increased to a slightly greater extent, and values for the
      hydroxy metabolite were unchanged. Ratios of the AUCinfinity and Cmax values
      between elderly volunteers and patients with GORD were 1.25 [95% confidence
      interval (CI) 0.94, 1.67] and 1.18 (0.91, 1.52), respectively. Esomeprazole was
      well tolerated and there were no safety concerns. CONCLUSIONS: The AUCinfinity
      and Cmax values in the elderly were not significantly different from those
      obtained in a group of middle-aged patients. The difference for AUCinfinity was
      25% (95% CI -6% to +67%). Esomeprazole has a wide therapeutic window and our
      results do not indicate that dosage adjustment should be necessary in the
      elderly.

TI  - Heller's myotomy: thoracoscopic or laparoscopic?
PG  - 279-81
AB  - Cardiomyotomy is now usually performed using a minimally invasive approach. A
      consecutive series of 18 patients with an intention to treat thoracoscopically
      were followed by the same number of patients treated laparoscopically. Both
      groups have been followed prospectively for a minimum of 2 years. The groups were
      well matched for age, symptom duration, preoperative lower esophageal sphincter
      pressure, and number having undergone balloon dilatation. There was one
      conversion from a thoracoscopic to a laparoscopic approach so that, for the
      purpose of analysis, there are 17 in the thoracoscopic group and 19 in the
      laparoscopic group. There was no difference in the average operating time, rate
      of conversion to open operation, mucosal breaches, or length of hospitalization. 
      Nor was there any difference in dysphagia symptoms, with 14/17 having a
      satisfactory result after thoracoscopic myotomy and 18/19 after laparoscopic
      myotomy. Frequency of reflux symptoms was similar and, although mild reflux was
      common, only two patients required treatment with a proton pump blocker. In the
      treatment of achalasia, thoracoscopic and laparoscopic myotomy without
      fundoplication are equally effective in relieving dysphagia and have a similar
      safety profile.

      questionnaire for gastroesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 265-70
AB  - The purpose of this study was to establish the reproducibility, validity, and
      responsiveness of a symptom questionnaire to assess patients with
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). A total of 300 patients with GERD
      completed questionnaires before and 6 months after laparoscopic Nissen
      fundoplication. Forty-six GERD patients who continued on omeprazole served as
      controls. Lower esophageal sphincter pressure, 24-h pH, and quality of life
      (SF36) were measured at baseline and follow-up. Reproducibility was calculated as
      an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) from a repeated-measures analysis of 
      variance on symptom scores (SS) on two consecutive days. Validity was established
      by correlating SS with 24-h pH and SF36 scores. Responsiveness was calculated as 
      the the ratio of the mean paired difference in score in the surgical group to the
      within-subject variability in control subjects. Reproducibility was very high, as
      revealed by an ICC of 0.92. Strong correlations between SS and SF36 scores at
      baseline and after surgery demonstrated high cross-sectional validity.
      Correlation between change in SS and change in pH, SF36 pain, general health, and
      physical health scores demonstrated longitudinal validity. The mean (95%
      confidence interval) paired differences in SS were 25.6 (23.7, 27.5) in the study
      and 2.0 (-3.2, 7.3) in the control groups, and the responsive index was 1.0. The 
      estimated minimally important clinical difference was 7. We conclude that the
      symptom score is a reproducible, valid, and responsive instrument for assessing
      symptoms caused by GERD.

TI  - Nitrofurantoin quadruple therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection: effect of
      metronidazole resistance.
PG  - 513-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistance has increasingly been recognized as the major
      cause of treatment failure for Helicobacter pylori infection. New therapies for
      patients with metronidazole- or clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori are needed.
      AIM: To investigate the role of nitrofurantoin quadruple therapy for the
      treatment of H. pylori. METHODS: Patients with confirmed H. pylori infection
      received nitrofurantoin (100 mg t.d.s.), omeprazole (20 mg b.d.), Pepto-Bismol
      (two tablets t.d.s.), and tetracycline (500 mg t.d.s.) for 14 days. Four or more 
      weeks after the end of therapy, outcome was assessed by repeat endoscopy with
      histology and culture or urea breath testing. RESULTS: Thirty patients were
      entered, including 25 men and five women; the mean age was 54.9 years. The most
      common diagnoses were duodenal ulcer (23%) and GERD (18%). The intention-to-treat
      cure rate was 70% (95% CI: 50.6-85%). Nitrofurantoin quadruple therapy was more
      effective with metronidazole-sensitive strains (88%; 15 out of 17) than with
      metronidazole-resistant strains (33%; three out of nine; P=0.008). Two of the
      treatment failures had pre-treatment isolates susceptible to metronidazole, which
      were resistant after therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Because nitrofurantoin quadruple
      therapy performed inadequately in the presence of metronidazole resistance, we
      conclude that nitrofurantoin is unlikely to find clinical utility for the
      eradication of H. pylori.

TI  - A randomised trial of amoxycillin versus clarithromycin in combination with
      omeprazole for eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection in Singapore.
PG  - 482-4
AB  - Dual therapy has been reported to produce H.pylori eradication rate of 75-80%.
      This study is designed to determine the efficacy of omeprazole 20 mg bd in
      combination with amoxycillin 500 mg tid (Group A), amoxycillin 750 mg tds (Group 
      B) and clarithromycin 500 mg tid (Group C) in Singapore. One hundred and
      forty-eight patients with H. pylori positive duodenal ulcers between ages of 22
      and 69 were enrolled from two centres. There were 48 patients in Group A, 50
      patients in Group B and 50 patients in Group C. The medication was given for 14
      days. The patients were re-evaluated with an upper GI endoscope 4 weeks after
      cessation of treatment Successful eradication was defined as H.pylori negative on
      histology and culture. Based on intention to treat analysis, the eradication rate
      was 47.8% in Group A, 68% in Group B and 66% in Group C. The difference between
      GroupA and B were statistically significant (p = 0.04). Based on all patient
      treated analysis, the eradication rate was 57.5% in Group A, 70.7% in Group B and
      75% in Group C. The difference in eradication rates was not statistically
      significant. Adverse events were reported in 21% of all patients with no
      difference in the adverse event rate between all groups. The eradication rate
      achieved with dual therapy in this study was similar to that attained in Western 
      population. Higher dose amoxycillin regime gives a significantly higher
      eradication than a lower dose amoxycillin.

TI  - Economic evaluation of celecoxib, a new cyclo-oxygenase 2 specific inhibitor, in 
      Switzerland.
PG  - 59-75
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to predict the cost effectiveness of
      celecoxib, a cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2) specific inhibitor, in the treatment of
      arthritis patients in Switzerland. METHODS: We applied a decision analytical
      model to compare the effects of 6 months' treatment with the following: (i)
      celecoxib; (ii) nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) alone; NSAID
      protected with (iii) proton pump inhibitor (PPI), (iv) histamine H2 receptor
      antagonist (H2RA), or (v) misoprostol; and (vi) diclofenac/misoprostol. Treatment
      costs included drug acquisition and the management of gastrointestinal (GI)
      adverse effects, classified as GI discomfort, symptomatic ulcer, anaemia and
      serious GI events (requiring hospitalisation). Probabilities were derived from
      celecoxib clinical trials and the literature. Drug utilisation patterns and
      treatment costs reflecting Swiss practice were obtained from local sources.
      Analysis was from the public health insurers' perspective. A range of sensitivity
      analyses was performed. RESULTS: For the base case of patients at typical risk
      (0.56% per 6 months) of serious GI events, the total expected costs of 6 months' 
      treatment were as follows: celecoxib 435 Swiss francs (SwF); NSAID alone SwF510; 
      diclofenac/misoprostol SwF522; and other protected NSAID regimens between SwF1034
      and SwF1415. Celecoxib remained the lowest costing treatment over all categories 
      of GI risk. Celecoxib generated 115 expected adverse events per 1000 patients per
      6 months, followed by NSAID + PPI (119), NSAID + H2RA (154), NSAID + misoprostol 
      (202), diclofenac/misoprostol (203), and NSAID alone (220), again for the base
      case. The cost per adverse event averted for celecoxib compared with NSAIDs alone
      was estimated in a stochastic version of the model using Monte Carlo simulation. 
      In 95% of 500 iterations, celecoxib was predicted to save both costs and adverse 
      events, thus dominating NSAIDs alone; the maximum cost per adverse event averted 
      was SwF440. CONCLUSIONS: Celecoxib is predicted to be the most cost effective of 
      the treatments considered for managing arthritis patients in Switzerland. A
      policy of switching patients from NSAIDs to celecoxib is predicted to be cost
      saving for public health insurers, while reducing the burden of iatrogenic GI
      side effects. Greater cost savings would be realised when patients are switched
      from NSAIDs used with gastroprotective agents. Models such as this can provide a 
      useful but simplified view of treatment outcomes and predicted results require
      prospective validation in clinical practice.

AB  - Nonvariceal, upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a very common source of
      morbidity and mortality. The concept of ulcer clot dissolution being facilitated 
      by a low gastric pH has allowed us to better understand the pathophysiology of
      nonvariceal upper GI bleeding. Placebo-controlled trials have shown the benefit
      of oral proton pump inhibitor administration in contrast to H(2) receptor
      antagonists. Furthermore, our recent experience with intravenous proton pump
      inhibitors has reinforced these observations.

TI  - Endoscopic implantation of Plexiglas (PMMA) microspheres for the treatment of
      GERD.
PG  - 423-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: A gelatinous implant containing polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) beads
      is successfully used to augment the diminished thickness of the chorium in
      patients with skin defects and wrinkles. The aim of the present study was to
      determine whether submucosal injection of PMMA microspheres into the lower
      esophageal folds decreases the severity of symptoms and acid reflux in patients
      with GERD. METHODS: Endoscopic submucosal implantation of PMMA was carried out in
      10 patients with GERD who were either refractory to or dependent on proton pump
      inhibitors. Symptom severity score, 24-hour pH monitoring, upper GI endoscopy,
      and EUS were performed to evaluate the efficacy of implantation. RESULTS: A
      significant decrease in the symptom severity score and mean total time with
      esophageal pH less than 4 was noted after the implantation of PMMA (p < 0.05).
      Seven of 10 patients were taking no medication after PMMA implantation. There
      were no serious procedure-related complications. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic
      implantation of PMMA into the submucosa of the lower esophageal folds may be a
      new method for treating GERD. Further studies are required to determine the
      long-term efficacy of the procedure.

TI  - Radiofrequency energy delivery to the gastroesophageal junction for the treatment
      of GERD.
PG  - 407-15
AB  - BACKGROUND: In this multi-center study, the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of 
      radiofrequency (RF) energy delivery to the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) for
      the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) were investigated.
      METHODS: Forty-seven patients with classic symptoms of GERD (heartburn and/or
      regurgitation), a daily anti-secretory medication requirement, and at least
      partial symptom response to drugs were enrolled. All patients had pathologic
      esophageal acid exposure by 24-hour pH study, a 2 cm or smaller hiatal hernia,
      grade 2 or less esophagitis, and no significant dysmotility or dysphagia. RF
      energy was delivered with a catheter and thermocouple-controlled generator to
      create submucosal thermal lesions in the muscle of the GEJ. GERD symptoms and
      quality of life were assessed at 0, 1, 4, and 6 months with the short-form health
      survey (SF-36). Anti-secretory medications were withdrawn 7 days before each
      assessment of symptoms and pH/motility study. Medication use, endoscopic
      findings, esophageal acid exposure, and motility were assessed at 0 and 6 months.
      RESULTS: Thirty-two men and 15 women underwent treatment. At 6 months there were 
      improvements in the median heartburn score (4 to 1, p < or = 0.0001), GERD score 
      (26 to 7, p < or = 0.0001), satisfaction (1 to 4, p < or = 0.0001), mental SF-36 
      (46.2 to 55.5, p = 0.01), physical SF-36 (41.1 to 51.9, p < or = 0.0001), and
      esophageal acid exposure (11.7% to 4.8%, p < or = 0.0001). Esophagitis was
      present in 25 patients before treatment (15 grade 1 and 10 grade 2) and 8 had
      esophagitis at 6 months (4 grade 1 and 4 grade 2, p = 0.005). At 6 months, 87% no
      longer required proton pump inhibitor medication. There was no significant change
      in median lower esophageal sphincter pressure (14.0 to 12.0 mm Hg, p = 0.19),
      peristaltic amplitude (64 to 66 mm Hg, p = 0.71), or lower esophageal sphincter
      length (3.0 to 3.0, p = 0.28). There were 3 self-limited complications (fever for
      24 hours, odynophagia lasting for 5 days, and a linear mucosal injury that was
      healed after 3 weeks). CONCLUSION: RF energy delivery significantly improved GERD
      symptoms, quality of life, and esophageal acid exposure while eliminating the
      need for anti-secretory medication in the majority of patients with a
      heterogeneous spectrum of clinical disease severity but with minimal active
      esophagitis or hiatal hernia.

TI  - Gastroesophageal reflux disease and Barrett's esophagus.
PG  - 109-18
AB  - Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common clinical problem.
      Circumstantial evidence continues to suggest that infection with Helicobacter
      pylori may protect some patients from developing GERD and its complications. An
      empirical trial of a proton-pump inhibitor may now be a reasonable alternative to
      endoscopy or 24-hour pH testing for the diagnosis of GERD. Long-term follow-up
      data covering more than over a decade indicate that proton-pump inhibitors are
      effective and safe agents for the treatment of GERD. Furthermore, a strategy of
      proton-pump inhibitors first may be the most cost-effective approach to GERD. It 
      remains unclear why some patients with GERD develop Barrett's esophagus, whereas 
      others do not. Recent studies demonstrate the importance of pulses of acid or
      bile in increasing cell proliferation and cyclooxygenase-2 expression in
      Barrett's epithelium cell cultures. Short-segment Barrett's esophagus is now
      clearly associated with an increased risk of dysplasia or cancer compared to
      intestinal metaplasia of the cardia, and the cancer risk in this condition is
      similar to that with long-segment Barrett's esophagus. However, the overall
      cancer risk in patients with Barrett's esophagus is lower than previously
      estimated, at approximately 0.5% annually. Ablation techniques continue to show
      promise, but are not yet ready for routine clinical use. Endoscopic mucosal
      resection is a new treatment option for selected patients with high-grade
      dysplasia or superficial esophageal adenocarcinoma.

TI  - Pharmacodynamic modeling of lansoprazole using an indirect irreversible response 
      model.
PG  - 251-8
AB  - A mechanism-based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model was used to assess
      lansoprazole effects on gastric pH. The irreversible inactivation of the
      H+/K+-ATPase enzyme by lansoprazole controls the secretion rate of H+ ions and
      gastric pH values. The basal circadian rhythm of gastric acid production was
      taken into account as well as the effects of food intake. A model was applied to 
      multiple-dose data from a crossover study of four dosage regimens of lansoprazole
      in two groups of normal male subjects. Model parameters were estimated by
      nonlinear regression and were compared to historical values reported in the
      literature. The predicted mean gastric ion concentration was 23.2 mM (pH 1.6)
      with the peak time at 12.6 hours (8:30 p.m.), and the half-time for H+ removal
      from the stomach averaged 1.7 hours. The estimated half-life of gastric food
      removal was 0.8 hours. The rate constant for normal H+/K+-ATPase degradation was 
      0.045 h(-1). The pharmacodynamic parameter describing lansoprazole action on
      gastric acid secretion was the second-order enzyme inactivation constant, which
      averaged 0.16 microg(-1) x L x h(-1). The parameters obtained for both the
      baseline and drug treatment data were consistent with the literature and
      physiologically relevant with the exception of effective food volume, which was
      large presumably due to buffer effects. The model successfully incorporated the
      physiological regulation of gastric acid production, the effects of food on
      gastric acid, and the effects of multiple-dosing regimens of lansoprazole on
      gastric acid production to give reasonable profiles of gastric pH.

TI  - Surgical management of peptic ulcer disease in the Helicobacter era--management
      of bleeding peptic ulcer.
PG  - 2-8
AB  - Bleeding continues to be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality for
      patients with peptic ulcer disease. Recent advances have changed the management
      of this disease. Upper endoscopy with or without endoscopic therapy is the
      preferred procedure during the initial evaluation of upper gastrointestinal
      bleeding. With its excellent success rates, many patients are being cured with
      endoscopic therapy followed by eradication of Helicobacter pylori. H. pylori is
      now thought to have an important role in the pathogenesis of a majority of
      gastric and duodenal ulcers. This finding has led to the recommendation that
      patients with peptic ulcer disease be treated with regimens effective against
      this organism. Currently, patients who are older and who have more severe
      underlying medical conditions present a challenge. This review will address the
      options for treatment of peptic ulcer bleeding. In addition, knowledge gained
      regarding H. pylori infection and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
      will be discussed.

TI  - Omeprazole therapy and salivary flow rate in duodenal ulcer patients.
PG  - 276-81
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous reports have shown that in some reflux-oesophagitis patients
      omeprazole therapy alters salivary secretion. The aim of the study was to examine
      this effect in duodenal ulcer patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty nine
      Helicobacter pylori positive subjects of both sexes, predominantly men, were
      recruited for the study. They were taking for two weeks only omeprazole (n = 17),
      or omeprazole in combination with either amoxycillin or amoxycillin and
      tinidazole (n = 22). Salivary secretion was assessed before and at the end of the
      treatment, both in basal conditions and during a gastric secretory test. Gastric 
      secretion was monitored concurrently with salivary flow rate. Additionally
      gastritis score and serum gastrin levels were assessed. RESULTS: Basal salivary
      secretions remained unchanged in patients on omeprazole monotherapy, but
      decreased in five of eight saliva collection periods in patients on eradication
      regimens. During the gastric secretory test, salivary secretions fell in both
      groups, but only after pentagastrin stimulation (in one collection period in
      patients on omeprazole, and in three collection periods in patients on
      eradication therapy). The observed changes in salivary secretion were inversely
      related to the pre-treatment gastric pH values. CONCLUSION: The influence of
      omeprazole and omeprazole-based eradication therapies on salivary flow rate is
      presumably secondary to changes in gastric pH values and is likely to be related 
      to oesophago-salivary reflex generation.

TI  - Clarithromycin for Helicobacter pylori infection.
PG  - 507-14
AB  - Helicobacter pylori, a Gram-negative organism that survives in the deep mucus
      layer and attaches to the gastric surface cells, is estimated to be present in up
      to one-half of the US population. Chronic H. pylori infection causes chronic
      gastritis, peptic ulcer diseases and even gastric cancer. Cure of the infection
      leads to healing of gastric inflammation, prevention of development of peptic
      ulcer, as well as accelerated healing of peptic ulcers, and prevention of ulcer
      recurrence. Treatment of H. pylori has undergone substantial evolution over the
      past decade. Despite the in vitro susceptibility, results from single or even
      dual drug therapy is typically unsatisfactory and the best therapy is yet to be
      defined. The best current therapies for H. pylori infection consist of a proton
      pump inhibitor (PPI) or ranitidine bismuth citrate and two antibiotics (triple
      therapies), or bismuth, tetracycline, metronidazole and a PPI (quadruple
      therapy). Clarithromycin is one of the most useful antimicrobials against H.
      pylori. It is an acid-stable macrolide with a broad spectrum of antibacterial
      activity, well absorbed with a wide tissue distribution and with mild side
      effects. Clarithromycin has a low minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC50) for H.
      pylori and its effect is potentiated by acid inhibition. When combined with a PPI
      or ranitidine bismuth citrate and amoxicillin or metronidazole, eradication rates
      of more than 95% can be achieved with susceptible organisms. However, the
      prevalence of primary and acquired clarithromycin resistance, which is due to
      mutations within a conserved loop of 23S rRNA of H. pylori, is increasing. In
      practice, the presence of clarithromycin resistance usually implies reduced
      success when clarithromycin-containing regimes are used. There is a need for
      improved therapies for H. pylori where antibiotic resistance is less of a
      problem.

TI  - Proton pump inhibitors in the treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 1171-94
AB  - Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is the most common peptic acid disease
      in the western world and is the commonest indication for acid suppression
      therapy. Major advances have been made over the past 30 years in the
      understanding of lower oesophageal sphincter function and the mechanism of acid
      secretion. Developments in surgical and pharmacological therapy have paralleled
      these advances. Pharmacotherapy for GERD has evolved from antacids to H2-receptor
      antagonists (H2RAs) to prokinetics to proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). The H2RAs,
      while modestly effective in symptom relief and healing of GERD, are limited by
      pharmacological tolerance. The prokinetics (metoclopramide and cisapride) are
      limited by low efficacy, pharmacological tolerance and toxicity. The PPIs have
      emerged as the most effective therapy for symptom relief, healing and long-term
      maintenance. They have also proved to be remarkably safe and cost-effective in
      long-term therapy. This review evaluates the pharmacology, efficacy,
      tolerability, safety and cost-effectiveness of the four currently available PPIs,
      lansoprazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole and rabeprazole, in the treatment of GERD.

TI  - A randomized, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic, cross-over study of duodenal
      or jejunal administration compared to nasogastric administration of omeprazole
      suspension in patients at risk for stress ulcers.
PG  - 367-72
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to characterize absorption and pH control
      of simplified omeprazole suspension (SOS), 2 mg/ml in 8.4% sodium bicarbonate,
      administered via the nasogastric versus jejunal or duodenal route. METHODS: Nine 
      critically ill surgical patients, NPO and mechanically ventilated, were enrolled 
      in this randomized cross-over study. Patients received a single 40 mg dose of SOS
      by the nasogastric and either the jejunal or duodenal route. Twenty-four-hour
      continuous intragastric pH monitoring was performed during the study period.
      Sequential blood samples were collected over 24 h to characterize SOS absorption 
      and pharmacokinetic parameters. RESULTS: Nasogastric administration of SOS
      resulted in lower maximum mean +/- SD serum concentrations compared to
      jejunal/duodenal dosing (0.970 +/- 0.436 vs 1.833 +/- 0.416 microg/ml, p =
      0.006). SOS absorption was significantly slower when administered via nasogastric
      tube (108.3 +/- 42.0 vs 12.1 +/- 7.9 min, p < 0.001). However, all routes of
      administration resulted in similar SOS area under the serum concentration-time
      curves (AUC(0-infinity)) (415.1 +/- 291.8 vs 396.7 +/- 388.1 microg x min/ml, p =
      0.91) [corrected]. Mean intragastric pH values remained >4 at 1 h after SOS
      administration and remained >4 for the entire 24-h study (6.32 +/- 1.04, 5.57 +/-
      1.15, nasogastric vs jejunal/duodenal, p = 0.015), regardless of administration
      route. CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill surgical patients, pharmacokinetic
      parameters and subsequent pH control after the administration of SOS are similar 
      by the jejunal, nasogastric, or duodenal route. SOS suspension offers an
      alternative acid control measure when patients are unable to take oral
      medications, yet have an enteral tube in place.

TI  - Do some patients with Helicobacter pylori infection benefit from an extension to 
      2 weeks of a proton pump inhibitor-based triple eradication therapy?
PG  - 359-66
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Seven-day proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-based triple therapies are the 
      first-line anti-Helicobacter pylori regimens; to date, however, there is still no
      agreement concerning all the predictors of H. pylori cure under these regimens.
      The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate whether patients with certain
      pretreatment characteristics may benefit from an extension from 1 to 2 wk of
      treatment with lansoprazole, amoxycillin, and clarithromycin. METHODS: A total of
      142 patients with H. pylori infection ascertained by means of gastric
      histopathology and 13C urea breath test (UBT) participated in this study. In all 
      patients H. pylori density was determined at histology both on antral and corpus 
      biopsies, and H. pylori culture with antibiotic susceptibility testing; IgG
      anti-H. pylori titers were also determined before therapy. Patients were
      randomized to receive 1-wk versus 2-wk of treatment with lansoprazole (30 mg
      b.i.d.), clarithromycin (500 mg b.i.d.), and amoxycillin (1 g b.i.d.). The
      association between eradication and potential predictors was analyzed by means of
      unconditional logistic regression models and stratified according to the duration
      of treatment. A stepwise regression analysis was performed to identify variables 
      discriminated between subjects, using eradication status as the dependent
      variable. RESULTS: The overall eradication rates for 1- and 2-wk treatments were 
      74.6% and 85.9% (intention-to-treat analysis) and 81.5% and 89.1% (per-protocol
      analysis), respectively (p = NS). Multivariate discriminant analysis selected as 
      the variables independently related to eradication cigarette smoking (OR = 3.98),
      delta of 13C-UBT higher than 35 (OR = 9.21) and IgG anti-H. pylori titer > or =
      93 (OR = 0.24) for the whole series of subjects. Stratified analysis according to
      the duration of therapy selected H. pylori density as the only predictor of
      eradication in the group treated for 1 wk (OR = 8.11). In contrast, no
      significant predictors were found in the group treated for 2 wk. CONCLUSIONS:
      Patients with a high intragastric bacterial load, as detected by histology (grade
      3) or 13C-UBT (delta > 35) may benefit from an extension to 2 wk of triple
      therapy with lansoprazole, amoxycillin, and clarithromycin.

TI  - Comparison of the efficacy and safety of different formulations of
      omeprazole-based triple therapies in the treatment of Helicobacter
      pylori-positive peptic ulcer.
PG  - 96-102
AB  - Little is known about the efficacy and safety of different formulations of
      omeprazole-based triple therapy regimens for the treatment of Helicobacter
      pylori-positive peptic ulcer. We compared the efficacy and safety of two
      formulations of omeprazole used in triple therapies in patients with H.
      pylori-positive active peptic ulcer. Seventy-four patients with endoscopically
      proven H. pylori-positive active peptic ulcer were randomized to two groups, each
      with 37 patients, to receive either OAC-I (6 weeks of "A" formulation of
      omeprazole [20 mg twice daily] plus 2 weeks of amoxicillin [1.0 g twice daily]
      and clarithromycin [500 mg twice daily] or OAC-II (6 weeks of "B" formulation of 
      omeprazole [20 mg twice daily] plus 2 weeks of the same antibiotics. The H.
      pylori and ulcer healing status were assessed at the baseline and at the 6-week
      endpoint of therapy. Gastrointestinal symptoms, documentation of adverse events, 
      and standard laboratory examinations were assessed at each visit. Eradication of 
      H. pylori (intention to treat [n = 74]/per protocol [n = 66]) and healing of the 
      ulcer were successful in 83.8%/96.9% and 93.8%, respectively, of the OAC-I group 
      patients, and in 91.9%/100% and 97.1%, respectively, of the OAC-II group patients
      (P = 0.477; P = 0.608). The OAC-I group experienced rapid resolution of symptoms,
      but no significant differences were found between the two groups for number of
      days taken for resolution of gastrointestinal symptoms, adverse events, and
      laboratory findings. The two different formulations of omeprazole used in triple 
      therapy regimens produced similar efficacy and safety results after 6 weeks of
      treatment in patients with H. pylori-positive active peptic ulcer.

TI  - Continued (5-year) followup of a randomized clinical study comparing antireflux
      surgery and omeprazole in gastroesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 172-9; discussion 179-81
AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of antireflux surgery (ARS) and proton pump inhibitor
      therapy in the control of gastroesophageal reflux disease is well established. A 
      direct comparison between these therapies is warranted to assess the benefits of 
      respective therapies. STUDY DESIGN: There were 310 patients with erosive
      esophagitis enrolled in the trial. There were 155 patients randomized to
      continuous omeprazole therapy and 155 to open antireflux surgery, of whom 144
      later had an operation. Because of various withdrawals during the study course,
      122 patients originally having an antireflux operation completed the 5-year
      followup; the corresponding figure in the omeprazole group was 133. Symptoms,
      endoscopy, and quality-of-life questionnaires were used to document clinical
      outcomes. Treatment failure was defined to occur if at least one of the following
      criteria were fulfilled: Moderate or severe heartburn or acid regurgitation
      during the last 7 days before the respective visit; Esophagitis of at least grade
      2; Moderate or severe dysphagia or odynophagia symptoms reported in combination
      with mild heartburn or regurgitation; If randomized to surgery and subsequently
      required omeprazole for more than 8 weeks to control symptoms, or having a
      reoperation; If randomized to omeprazole and considered by the responsible
      physician to require antireflux surgery to control symptoms; If randomized to
      omeprazole and the patient, for any reason, preferred antireflux surgery during
      the course of the study. Treatment failure was the primary outcomes variable.
      RESULTS: When the time to treatment failure was analyzed by use of the intention 
      to treat approach, applying the life table analysis technique, a highly
      significant difference between the two strategies was revealed (p < 0.001), with 
      more treatment failures in patients who originally were randomized to omeprazole 
      treatment. The protocol also allowed dose adjustment in patients allocated to
      omeprazole therapy to either 40 or 60 mg daily in case of symptom recurrence. The
      curves subsequently describing the failure rates still remained separated in
      favor of surgery, although the difference did not reach statistical significance 
      (p = 0.088). Quality of life assessment revealed values within normal ranges in
      both therapy arms during the 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized multicenter
      trial with a 5-year followup, we found antireflux surgery to be more effective
      than omeprazole in controlling gastroesophageal reflux disease as measured by the
      treatment failure rates. But if the dose of omeprazole was adjusted in case of
      relapse, the two therapeutic strategies reached levels of efficacy that were not 
      statistically different.

TI  - Management of GERD: medical versus surgical.
PG  - 3-15
AB  - Both laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication and proton pump inhibitors are effective 
      modern therapies for reflux disease that have yet to be directly compared in a
      well-designed clinical trial. In terms of a risk/benefit analysis, the risk of an
      undesirable outcome or death from laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication exceeds that
      of maintenance treatment with proton pump inhibitors making the later the
      preferable therapy. Neither therapy increases or reduces the risk of death from
      cancer and there are no compelling economic arguments favoring surgical
      management. Instances in which laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication should be
      considered include: 1) Individuals who are intolerant of proton pump inhibitor
      therapy because of side effects, 2) When patients are inadequately responsive to 
      proton pump inhibitor therapy even after dosage and dose interval have been
      optimized, and 3) When a patient desires a permanent solution to their reflux
      problem that frees them of the need to chronically consume pharmaceuticals.
      However, regardless of the motivation for pursuing surgical management, patients 
      must be advised of potential suboptimal results and the irreversibility of the
      procedure.

TI  - GERD and H. pylori: is there a link?
PG  - 16-25
AB  - The incidence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and esophageal
      adenocarcinoma have increased in recent years as the incidence of peptic ulcer
      disease and distal gastric cancer have declined. Given the simultaneous decline
      in Helicobacter pylori infection, it is tempting to propose a relationship
      between H. pylori infection and these opposing time trends. Although H. pylori
      infection clearly does not cause GERD, it may protect certain susceptible
      individuals from developing GERD and its complications. The most likely mechanism
      in which H. pylori infection protects against GERD is by decreasing the potency
      of the gastric refluxate in patients with corpus predominant gastritis. A variety
      of implications of H. pylori infection on GERD treatment have also arisen in
      recent years. These focus on the risk of gastric atrophy while on proton pump
      inhibitor therapy and the efficacy of proton pump inhibitors before and after
      eradication of H. pylori. This article puts into perspective our current
      understanding of the complex, incompletely understood relationship between H.
      pylori infection and GERD.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of esomeprazole after oral and intravenous administration of
      single and repeated doses to healthy subjects.
PG  - 665-70
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the pharmacokinetics of esomeprazole, one of the optical
      isomers of omeprazole, after 20 mg or 40 mg single and repeated oral and
      intravenous administration to healthy subjects. The main metabolites of
      esomeprazole were also assessed after the 40-mg oral dose. METHODS: In two
      separate studies, 16 healthy male subjects and 16 healthy male and female
      subjects received intravenous doses of 20 mg and 40 mg esomeprazole,
      respectively, on the first investigation day. After a washout period of 5-14
      days, the same doses (20 mg as a solution and 40 mg as a capsule) were given
      orally for 5 days and then again intravenously on day 6. Blood samples for
      determination of esomeprazole and its metabolites were collected 12 h or 24 h
      post-dose and were analysed using normal-phase liquid chromatography with
      ultraviolet (UV) detection. Pharmacokinetic parameters of esomeprazole and its
      metabolites were estimated using non-compartmental analysis. Geometric means and 
      ratios of the geometric means together with 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the 
      pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using analysis of variance (ANOVA).
      RESULTS: Plasma clearance (CL) of esomeprazole decreased from 22 l/h to 16 l/h
      and from 17 l/h to 9 l/h following repeated dosing of 20 mg and 40 mg,
      respectively. Total area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC)
      increased (from 1.34 micromol x h/l to 2.55 micromol x h/l) with absolute
      bioavailability (F) being 50% on day 1 and 68% on day 5 after the 20-mg oral
      dose. AUC increased (from 4.32 micromol x h/l to 11.21 micromol x h/l) with F
      being 64% on day 1 and 89% on day 5 after the 40-mg oral dose. The plasma levels 
      for esomeprazole sulphone were substantially higher on day 5 than on day 1, while
      those for 5-hydroxy esomeprazole were marginally higher on day 5 than on day 1
      following repeated oral dosing of 40 mg esomeprazole. No side effects
      attributable to esomeprazole were noticed. CONCLUSION: The increased AUC of
      esomeprazole with repeated dosing is probably due to a combination of a decreased
      first-pass elimination and a decreased systemic clearance.

TI  - Primary esophageal motility disorders.
PG  - 195-200
AB  - Esophageal motility disorders often manifest with chest pain and dysphagia.
      Achalasia is a disorder of the lower esophageal sphincter and the smooth
      musculature of the esophageal body. In achalasia the lower esophageal sphincter
      typically fails to relax with swallowing, and the esophageal body fails to
      undergo peristalsis. In contrast to spastic disorders of the esophagus, achalasia
      can be progressive and cause pronounced morbidity. Pseudoachalasia mimics
      achalasia in terms of symptoms but can be caused by infectious disorders or
      malignancy. Treatment for achalasia is nonstandardized and includes medical,
      endoscopic, and surgical options. Spastic disorders of the esophagus, such as
      diffuse esophageal spasm and nutcracker esophagus, and nonspecific esophageal
      motility disorder are benign and nonprogressive, with similar findings on
      esophageal manometry. Although the exact cause remains unknown, these disorders
      may represent a manifestation of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Treatment of
      spastic disorders includes medical and surgical approaches and is aimed at
      symptomatic relief.

TI  - Indirect cost of ischemic heart disease to employers.
PG  - 27-34
AB  - BACKGROUND: The management of healthcare programs by employers requires accurate 
      information about the indirect and direct costs of important chronic diseases.
      OBJECTIVE: To determine the indirect costs of ischemic heart disease from the
      perspective of the employer in private industry in the United States. DESIGN:
      Indirect cost of illness analysis using the human capital approach, taking the
      perspective of the employer rather than that of society. METHODS: Ischemic heart 
      disease was identified in a proprietary claims database of 3.1 million insured
      persons using an algorithm based on administrative codes. Economic data were
      derived from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Employment Management
      Association, and published sources. Work-loss data were taken from the National
      Center for Health Statistics' Health Interview Survey. The indirect cost was
      calculated as the sum of the costs due to morbidity and mortality. From the
      perspective of the employer, morbidity costs come from lost productivity, idle
      assets, and nonwage factors resulting from absenteeism and mortality costs are
      expenditures for replacing and retraining workers. This differs from calculations
      from the societal perspective, in which indirect costs are the value of an
      individual's lost income--both current and potential. RESULTS: The total indirect
      cost of ischemic heart disease to employers in private industry was $182.74 per
      enrollee. Ninety-five percent of the indirect cost was the consequence of work
      loss due to morbidity rather than of mortality costs. CONCLUSION: From the
      perspective of the employer, the indirect cost of ischemic heart disease is
      overwhelmingly due to morbidity costs.

TI  - Ulcer and gastritis.
PG  - 8-15
AB  - Recent progress in the area of ulcer and gastritis is still dominated by findings
      and reports on Helicobacter pylori and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
      which in turn are the two major causes of peptic ulcers. Although the prevalence 
      of H. pylori is declining in most developed countries, it is still contributing
      to a significant proportion of peptic ulcers globally. The interrelationship of
      H. pylori gastritis in patients with gastroesophageal reflux has become more
      apparent. H. pylori-induced gastric body gastritis is associated with reduced
      acid production, and thus with reduced reflux and esophagitis. The controversies 
      regarding the interactions between H. pylori and NSAIDs have still not been
      settled. With the availability of the new COX-2-specific inhibitors, the current 
      scenario of NSAID-related gastroduodenal complications will certainly change.
      Short-term usage of these agents has significantly reduced the incidence of
      endoscopic ulcers, but the benefits in terms of clinical outcomes, such as
      bleeding or perforation, remain to be determined. This review summarizes the
      recent literature on peptic ulcer and gastritis.

TI  - Does Helicobacter pylori affect gastric mucin expression? Relationship between
      gastric antral mucin expression and H. pylori colonization.
PG  - 19-23
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Helicobacter pylori colonizes the gastric mucous gel layer,
      the surface epithelium and glands. It has been shown that H. pylori infection
      causes aberrant expression of gastric mucins MUC 5 and MUC 6. This study aimed to
      determine the distribution of MUC 5 and MUC 6 in the gastric antrum of dyspeptic 
      patients, and to investigate changes in this pattern in the presence of H. pylori
      and after successful eradication. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gastric antrum biopsy
      specimens were examined by immunohistochemistry for mucin gene (MUC 5 and MUC 6) 
      expression. Polyclonal antibodies were used to detect amino acid tandem repeats
      of each protein. A scoring system (0-3) was used to assess staining intensity at 
      three sites: foveola, mucous neck cells and glands. H. pylori status was
      determined by histology and rapid urease test, and considered positive or
      negative when both tests were positive or negative, respectively. The study
      included 49 patients positive for H. pylori, in 36 of whom successful eradication
      was performed, and 11 H. pylori-negative patients. RESULTS: There was a gradient 
      of MUC 5 expression, higher to lower, from the surface to the glands, which was
      more pronounced before eradication. Increased MUC 5 synthesis in the mucous neck 
      cells and in the glands was found after H. pylori eradication (P = 0.016). MUC 6 
      was synthesized in the glands more than in the mucous neck cells or foveola. MUC 
      6 was also secreted into the lumen and probably comprised the superficial part of
      the unstirred mucous layer. CONCLUSION: The change in MUC 5 synthesis may reflect
      H. pylori colonization.

TI  - Effect of elimination of acid reflux on epithelial cell proliferative activity of
      Barrett esophagus.
PG  - 1238-44
AB  - BACKGROUND: Barrett esophagus (BE) is a premalignant condition resulting from
      chronic acid gastroesophageal reflux and is associated with increased epithelial 
      cell proliferation. Elimination of acid reflux might decrease cancer risk by
      affecting cell proliferation in BE. The effect of elimination of acid reflux on
      epithelial cell proliferation in BE was studied. METHODS: Forty-five patients
      with long segment Barrett esophagus were treated in a randomized 2-year follow-up
      study with either omeprazole 40 mg b.i.d. (OME) or ranitidine 150 mg b.i.d. (RAN)
      and were compared for the effect on epithelial cell proliferation. Biopsies were 
      taken 3 cm above the GE junction and just below the Z-line, at 0, 3, 9, and 24
      months. Epithelial cell proliferation was determined by in vitro labeling with
      5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine and immunohistochemistry. Labeling indices (LI) were
      established for luminal and crypt epithelium separately. Ambulatory 24-h
      esophageal pH-metry was performed at 0 and 3 months. Comparisons were made for
      the timeframes 0-3 months, 3-24 months, and 0-24 months. RESULTS: OME reduced
      mean acid reflux to 0.1 %/24 h, RAN to 9.4%. In the distal and the proximal
      biopsies, change in LI after 3 months was n.s. at either level for both
      treatments. In the distal biopsies (OME 22, RAN 23 patients) luminal LI increased
      significantly for RAN from 3 to 24 months (+12.64% month, mean area under the
      curve (AUC)), while that for OME remained stable, RAN versus OME P < 0.05. Crypt 
      LI increased in both groups, only in RAN significantly so (+30.75% month), RAN
      versus OME n.s. In the proximal biopsies luminal LI at 24 months (OME 20, RAN 21 
      patients) had increased slightly but not significantly in RAN (+8.86% month), RAN
      versus OME n.s., whereas in the crypts LI in OME it had increased significantly
      (+28.80% month), OME versus RAN n.s. CONCLUSION: Elimination of acid reflux
      resulted in a stabilization of luminal cell proliferative activity of Barrett
      epithelium in the distal esophagus, whereas this activity increased during
      continued acid reflux. Whether this finding has any implication for the cancer
      risk in Barrett esophagus remains to be seen.

TI  - Esomeprazole, a new proton pump inhibitor: pharmacological characteristics and
      clinical efficacy.
PG  - 537-41
AB  - Esomeprazole, the S-isomer of omeprazole, is the first proton pump inhibitor
      synthesised as an optical isomer to become available for clinical use.
      Esomeprazole is optically stable in humans with negligible inversion to the
      R-isomer. Esomeprazole has significantly higher oral bioavailability than
      omeprazole, resulting in greater acid suppression. In clinical studies, 4 weeks' 
      treatment with 40 mg esomeprazole demonstrated greater healing of all grades of
      erosive oesophagitis, compared with 20 mg omeprazole (76-82% versus 69-71%) and
      higher rates of symptom resolution (65-68% versus 58-61%) Furthermore,
      esomeprazole maintained healing rates of up to 90% over 6 months in erosive
      oesophagitis. Comparisons with other proton pump inhibitors in oesophagitis are, 
      as yet, unavailable. In patients with endoscopy-negative gastro-oesophageal
      reflux disease (GERD), on-demand therapy with esomeprazole 20 mg has been shown
      to be very efficacious compared with placebo, and is well tolerated; however,
      comparisons with other proton pump inhibitors have not been performed. Long-term 
      use of esomeprazole for up to 12 months in patients with GERD have not raised any
      significant safety concerns with respect to the development of atrophic gastritis
      or clinically relevant changes in enterochromaffin-like cells.

TI  - Randomized study of two "rescue" therapies for Helicobacter pylori-infected
      patients after failure of standard triple therapies.
PG  - 58-62
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A novel rifabutin-based therapy is able to cure Helicobacter pylori
      infection in most patients who have failed eradication after standard proton pump
      inhibitor (PPI)-based triple therapy. We compared this regimen with the quadruple
      therapy. METHODS: A total of 135 patients were randomized into three groups who
      were treated for 10 days with pantoprazole 40 mg b.i.d., amoxycillin 1 g b.i.d., 
      and rifabutin 150 mg o.d. (RAP50150 group), or 300 mg o.d. (RAP300 group), and
      pantoprazole 40 mg b.i.d., metronidazole 250 mg t.i.d., bismuth citrate 240 mg
      b.i.d., and tetracycline 500 mg q.i.d. (QT group). Before therapy, patients
      underwent endoscopy with biopsies for histology, culture and antibiotic
      susceptibility tests. H. pylori eradication was assessed by the 13C-urea breath
      test. RESULTS: On intention-to-treat analysis, eradication rates (with 95%
      confidence intervals [CI]) were 66.6% (53-80%) in the RAP150 and QT groups,
      respectively, and 86.6% (76-96%) in RAP300 group (p < 0.025). Most patients
      harboring metronidazole- and clarithromycin-resistant strains were eradicated at 
      an equal rate by each of the three regimens. Side effects were observed in 9% and
      11% of rifabutin-treated patients, and in 47% of those on quadruple therapy (p < 
      0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: In patients who failed standard eradicating treatments, a
      10-day course of rifabutin with pantoprazole and amoxycillin is more effective
      and well tolerated than the quadruple therapy.

TI  - Effect of age on differences in upper esophageal sphincter and pharynx pressures 
      between patients with dysphagia and control subjects.
PG  - 35-40
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore the effect of age and food
      consistency on manometric data of the swallow sequence in patients with
      dysphagia. METHODS: Manometric data from 41 patients (age range, 32-88 yr) and 41
      age-matched control subjects was examined for differences between subgroups < 60 
      yr and > or = 60 yr of age, as well as for changes with food consistency.
      RESULTS: Only pharynx peak pressure showed an age-dependent decrease (144.1 +/-
      21.4 mm Hg vs 95.8 +/- 15.1 mm Hg, p < 0.05) in patients. Significant higher
      upper esophageal sphincter residual pressure and delayed onset of upper
      esophageal sphincter relaxation were noted in patients aged <60 yr compared to
      age-matched controls, whereas only pharynx peak pressure was significantly lower 
      in patients compared to controls aged > or = 60 yr. Food consistency did not have
      a consistent effect on manometric results in patients with dysphagia.
      CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to systematically explore the influence of
      age and food consistency on manometric parameters in dysphagia patients. These
      results may provide useful insights when identifying actual manometric
      abnormalities in patients with dysphagia. They also suggest possible different
      underlying mechanisms of dysphagia in younger versus older patients.

TI  - Esomeprazole once daily for 6 months is effective therapy for maintaining healed 
      erosive esophagitis and for controlling gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms:
      a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of efficacy and safety.
PG  - 27-34
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Esomeprazole, the S-isomer of omeprazole, achieves a significantly
      greater healing rate and symptom resolution of erosive esophagitis than that
      achieved by omeprazole. The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of 
      the new proton pump inhibitor esomeprazole in preventing relapse over a prolonged
      period in patients with healed erosive esophagitis. METHODS: A total of 318
      gastroesophageal reflux patients whose erosive esophagitis was healed in a
      comparative study of esomeprazole 40 mg, 20 mg, or omeprazole 20 mg, were
      randomized to maintenance therapy with once daily esomeprazole 40 mg, 20 mg, or
      10 mg, or placebo in a U.S., double-blind multicenter trial. RESULTS: After 6
      months, healing was maintained (cumulative life table rates) in 93.6% (95% CI
      87.4-99.7) of patients treated with esomeprazole 40 mg, 93.2% (95% CI 87.4-99.0) 
      treated with esomeprazole 20 mg, and 57.1% (95% CI 45.2-69) treated with
      esomeprazole 10 mg; p < 0.001 vs placebo (29.1%; 95% CI 17.7-40.3). Of patients
      relapsing, mean time to first recurrence of esophagitis increased with dose, from
      34 days (placebo) to 78 days (10 mg), 115 days (20 mg), and 163 days (40 mg).
      Patients treated with esomeprazole had less frequent and less severe heartburn
      than those treated with placebo. At month 6, more than 70% of patients being
      treated with esomeprazole remained symptom-free. CONCLUSIONS: Esomeprazole is
      effective and well tolerated in the maintenance of a healing erosive esophagitis.
      Esomeprazole 40 mg and 20 mg maintain healing in over 90% of patients while
      providing effective control of heartburn symptoms.

TI  - The evaluation and treatment of adults with gastroesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 57-8, 61-3
AB  - Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is defined as symptoms or tissue damage
      that results from the abnormal reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus. A
      systematic review of population-based studies estimates that heartburn or
      regurgitation symptoms occur in 21% to 59% of the population during a given year.
      The frequency of GERD in specific populations is provided in Table 1. Although
      only 1 in 5 patients with upper intestinal symptoms that occur at least weekly
      seeks medical attention, nearly 1% of all visits to a family physician's office
      are for GERD or related conditions. GERD significantly affects the quality of
      patients' lives. In a survey of patients presenting for upper endoscopy with
      symptoms of at least 3 months' duration, those with a diagnosis of GERD reported 
      low scores at baseline for general well-being. Fortunately, follow-up data
      reported 4 weeks after treatment note improvement in gastrointestinal symptoms,
      general well-being, general health, vitality, and depression.

PG  - 1315-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the usefulness of a twice-a-day, simplified quadruple therapy 
      to cure Helicobacter pylori infection. DESIGN: Helicobacter pylori-positive ulcer
      patients were treated with omeprazole 20 mg twice a day (b.d.), amoxicillin 1 g
      b.d., tinidazole 500 mg b.d. and bismuth subcitrate 240 mg b.d. for 7 days in an 
      experimental, noncomparative pilot study. SETTING: The gastroenterology unit of a
      county hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-four consecutive patients with peptic ulcer 
      disease and H. pylori infection. MEASUREMENTS: Cure was tested by either
      endoscopy or breath test after 2 months, and by urea breath test 6 months after
      therapy. RESULTS: One patient was lost to follow-up. Of the remaining 43, 37 were
      cured at the first control, giving an intention-to-treat cure rate of 84.1% (95% 
      CI 69-93%) and a per protocol cure rate of 86% (95% CI 71-94%). Thirty-three
      cured patients agreed to return for a six-month breath test. All but one were
      cured (long-term per protocol cure rate 82.1%; 95% CI 66-92%). CONCLUSIONS: This 
      particular quadruple therapy is well tolerated and easy to comply with. However, 
      cure rates did not reach 90%.

TI  - The role of economic evaluation in the diagnosis and treatment of Helicobacter
      pylori infection.
PG  - 837-51
AB  - The unfolding of the H. pylori story coupled with the high prevalence and
      economic burden associated with upper gastrointestinal symptoms makes H.
      pylori-associated disorders an ideal candidate for economic evaluation. As a
      result of the high quality and quantity of data emerging, H. pylori eradication
      is cost-effective in individuals with either newly diagnosed or past PUD. The
      role of eradication in other areas, for example, patients with nonulcer dyspepsia
      and screening to prevent gastric cancer, may never be worked out to some
      clinicians' satisfaction. Conflicting reports and the lack of definitive clinical
      trials have frustrated clinicians. H. pylori diagnosis and treatment have not
      been integrated into everyday clinical practice. As a result, the enormous
      potential benefits associated with H. pylori eradication have not been achieved. 
      Economic evaluation is not a panacea to the problems confronting medical services
      delivery. Assessments of medical practice are methodologically challenging,
      time-consuming, and expensive. Once the answers are in, it remains difficult to
      alter an individual provider's patterns of care and integrate the research
      findings into everyday practice. Further research into physician decision making 
      is necessary to complement the advances being made in determining the value of
      medical interventions. The fruits of these efforts will be the more efficient
      delivery of health care services, which, it is hoped, ultimately will improve the
      health of patients. There is no reason to believe, however, that more attention
      to effectiveness research would lead to a reduction in health care expenditures. 
      Increasing demands for accountability of medical interventions will propel
      effectiveness movements. Economic analyses, performed in concert with carefully
      designed clinical studies, will spur more critical review of health care resource
      allocation decisions. Despite the limitations, the findings generated from
      effectiveness research will have a major impact on physician practices, guideline
      development, and reimbursement decisions. The tendency of clinicians not to pay
      attention to economic evaluations may lead to missed clinical benefits and
      unnecessary expenditures. Physicians who have been reluctant to appreciate the
      information provided by economic evaluation must understand what other
      stakeholders in health care delivery already have accepted: that the rational
      basis for cost-effectiveness analysis is the overall improvement in the quality
      of health care services--not simply a tool to reduce health care costs.

TI  - Cost effectiveness of rabeprazole versus generic ranitidine for symptom
      resolution in patients with erosive esophagitis.
PG  - 905-16
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost effectiveness of rabeprazole (RAB) and ranitidine 
      (RAN) in acute and maintenance therapy for erosive esophagitis using symptom
      response, rather than endoscopic healing, as the clinical outcome. STUDY DESIGN: 
      Decision analysis was used to model the cost effectiveness of competing therapies
      based on the results of clinical trials of RAB versus RAN and estimates from the 
      medical literature. METHODS: The model's base case scenario compared brand-name
      RAB (estimated average wholesale price) with generic RAN (25% of the average
      wholesale price of brand-name RAN). Medical costs for hospitalizations,
      procedures, and office visits reflected 1998 Medicare payments. The 1-year
      maintenance model accounted for drug-class switching and symptomatic, rather than
      endoscopic, recurrences. Effectiveness was reported as the percentage of patients
      in whom a symptomatic recurrence was prevented. The cost per symptomatic
      recurrence prevented was reported as an average and an incremental
      cost-effectiveness ratio. RESULTS: The per-patient cost of RAB therapy was higher
      than that of RAN therapy ($2020 vs $1917); RAB therapy, however, was more
      effective than RAN therapy in preventing symptomatic recurrences (74% vs 41%).
      The average cost-effectiveness ratio was lower for RAB therapy than for RAN
      therapy ($2748 per symptomatic recurrence prevented vs $4719 per symptomatic
      recurrence prevented). The cost of preventing one additional symptomatic
      recurrence with RAB rather than RAN was $313 (incremental cost-effectiveness
      ratio). Sensitivity analysis conducted on key clinical and cost variables
      supported the robustness of the decision model. CONCLUSION: This analysis
      demonstrates that management of esophagitis with RAB is more effective, and may
      be more cost effective, than management with generic RAN, despite RAB's higher
      per-unit cost.

TI  - Clarithromycin vs. furazolidone in quadruple therapy regimens for the treatment
      of Helicobacter pylori in a population with a high metronidazole resistance rate.
PG  - 411-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: The eradication of Helicobacter pylori plays a pivotal role in the
      treatment of peptic ulcer disease. Metronidazole resistance, common in Iran, is
      claimed to be a major reason for the failure of metronidazole-containing
      regimens. Both clarithromycin and furazolidone are potential alternatives for
      metronidazole. AIM: To assess and compare the effectiveness of clarithromycin-
      and furazolidone-based regimens in eradicating H. pylori in a population with a
      high metronidazole resistance rate. METHODS: Patients with proven duodenal ulcer 
      and H. pylori infection were randomly assigned to one of two groups. The patients
      received 2 weeks of omeprazole 20 mg b.d., amoxicillin 1000 mg b.d, bismuth
      subcitrate 240 mg b.d. and either clarithromycin 500 mg b.d. (the OABC group) or 
      furazolidone 200 mg b.d. (the OABF group). RESULTS: A total of 118 patients were 
      randomized, 55 in the OABC group and 63 in the OABF group. The intention-to-treat
      eradication rate was 84% and 85% for the OABF and OABC groups, respectively. The 
      per protocol eradication rates were 90% for both groups. CONCLUSIONS: OABC and
      OABF are both effective in eradicating H. pylori in areas where metronidazole
      resistance is a problem. OABF is a good alternative in the face of growing
      resistance to clarithromycin in developed countries, and is attractive for
      developing countries where clarithromycin is not readily available.

TI  - Non-Helicobacter pylori bacterial flora during acid-suppressive therapy:
      differential findings in gastric juice and gastric mucosa.
PG  - 379-88
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intragastric growth of non-Helicobacter pylori bacteria commonly
      occurs during acid-suppressive therapy. The long-term clinical consequences are
      still unclear. AIM: To investigate the luminal and mucosal bacterial growth
      during gastric acid inhibition, in relation to the type and duration of
      acid-inhibitory treatment, as well as to concomitant H. pylori infection.
      METHODS: A total of 145 patients on continuous acid inhibition with either proton
      pump inhibitors (n=109) or histamine2-receptor antagonists (H(2)RAs, n=36) for
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, and 75 dyspeptic patients without acid
      inhibition (control group) were included. At endoscopy, fasting gastric juice was
      obtained for pH measurement and bacteriological culture. Gastric biopsy specimens
      were examined for detection of H. pylori (immunohistochemistry) and of non-H.
      pylori bacteria (modified Giemsa stain-positive and immunohistochemistry-negative
      at the same location). RESULTS: Non-H. pylori flora was detected in the gastric
      juice of 92 (41.8%) patients and in the gastric mucosa of 109 (49.6%) patients.
      In gastric juice, prevalence rate for non-H. pylori bacteria was higher in
      patients taking proton pump inhibitors than controls and those taking H(2)RAs
      (58.7% vs. 22.6% and vs. 30.6%, P < 0.0001 and P < 0.003, respectively), but did 
      not differ statistically between H(2)RAs and controls. In gastric mucosa,
      prevalence rates for non-H. pylori bacteria were higher in patients taking proton
      pump inhibitors and H(2)RAs than in the controls (antrum: 46.9% and 48.6% vs.
      25%, P < 0.05 for both; corpus: 52.2% and 56.8% vs. 23.7%, P < 0.001 for both),
      but did not differ between proton pump inhibitors and H(2)RAs. Both luminal and
      mucosal growth of non-H. pylori bacteria were significantly greater in H.
      pylori-positive than -negative patients taking proton pump inhibitors (P < 0.05
      for both). Luminal growth of non-H. pylori flora increased with the intragastric 
      pH level, whilst mucosal bacterial growth increased with the duration of acid
      inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: Non-H. pylori flora not only contaminates the gastric
      juice but also colonizes the gastric mucosa of a large proportion of patients
      treated long-term with acid inhibition. The relationship between H. pylori and
      non-H. pylori bacteria in the pathogenesis of atrophic gastritis and gastric
      cancer needs further elucidation.

TI  - Esomeprazole 20 mg maintains symptom control in endoscopy-negative
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease: a controlled trial of 'on-demand' therapy for 
      6 months.
PG  - 347-54
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD),
      regardless of endoscopic status, suffer symptomatic relapse within 6 months of
      stopping acid suppressant therapy. AIM: To assess the efficacy of 'on-demand'
      treatment of GERD with esomeprazole, the first proton pump inhibitor developed as
      an optical isomer. METHODS: In this multicentre, double-blind study, 342
      endoscopy-negative GERD patients demonstrating complete resolution of heartburn
      during the final week of a 4-week treatment period with esomeprazole 20 mg or
      omeprazole 20 mg once daily were randomized to receive esomeprazole 20 mg or
      placebo on demand (maximum of one dose per day) for a further 6 months. Use of
      rescue antacids was permitted. RESULTS: All 342 patients (191 males), aged 19-79 
      (mean 49) years, were evaluable in the intention-to-treat analysis. The
      proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to insufficient control of 
      heartburn was significantly higher among placebo compared to esomeprazole
      recipients (51% vs. 14%; P < 0.0001). Patients randomized to esomeprazole
      on-demand therapy remained in the study longer than those in the placebo group
      (mean 165 vs. 119 days). Over 50% took the study medication for periods of 1--3
      consecutive days (esomeprazole) or 4--13 consecutive days (placebo). Use of
      antacids was > 2-fold higher among placebo recipients. The frequency of adverse
      events was similar in the two groups, when adjusted for time spent in the study, 
      as were the clinical laboratory profiles. CONCLUSIONS: On-demand therapy with
      esomeprazole 20 mg is effective and well tolerated in maintaining symptom control
      in endoscopy-negative GERD.

TI  - Review article: Barrett's oesophagus, dysplasia and pharmacologic acid
      suppression.
PG  - 269-76
AB  - Barrett's oesophagus, a significant complication of gastro-oesophageal reflux
      disease (GERD), is the single most important risk factor for oesophageal
      adenocarcinoma. The strong association between Barrett's oesophagus and chronic
      GERD suggests that abnormal oesophageal acid exposure plays an important role in 
      this condition. The progression of Barrett's oesophagus from specialized
      intestinal metaplasia to dysplasia and finally invasive carcinoma is incompletely
      understood, but increased and disordered proliferation is a key cellular event.
      In ex vivo organ culture experiments, cell proliferation is increased after
      exposure to short pulses of acid, whilst proliferation is reduced in Barrett's
      oesophagus specimens taken from patients with oesophageal acid exposure
      normalized by antisecretory therapy. In long-term clinical studies, consistent
      and profound intra-oesophageal acid suppression with proton pump inhibitors
      decreases cell proliferation and increases differentiation in Barrett's
      oesophagus, but the clinical importance of such favourable effects on these
      surrogate markers is not clear. In clinical practice, proton pump inhibitors
      relieve symptoms and induce partial regression to squamous epithelium, but
      abnormal oesophageal acid exposure and the risk for dysplasia or adenocarcinoma
      persist in many patients. The ability of proton pump inhibitors to suppress acid 
      profoundly and consistently may be critical in the long-term management of
      Barrett's oesophagus.

TI  - Medical treatment for reflux oesophagitis does not consistently improve asthma
      control: a systematic review.
PG  - 198-204
AB  - BACKGROUND: A systematic literature review was conducted to assess the effect of 
      treating reflux oesophagitis on asthma outcomes. METHODS: Randomised controlled
      trials of reflux oesophagitis treatment in adults or children that reported
      asthma health outcomes were included and assessed in accordance with the standard
      Cochrane systematic review process. Patients were typically adults with asthma
      and concurrent symptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux who received interventions
      that included pharmacological therapy, conservative management, and surgery. The 
      following outcome measures were assessed: lung function, peak expiratory flow,
      asthma symptoms, asthma medications, and nocturnal asthma. RESULTS: From 22
      potentially relevant published and unpublished randomised controlled trials, 12
      were included. Treatment duration ranged from 1 week to 6 months. Eight trials
      reported that treatment improved at least one asthma outcome, but these outcomes 
      differed between trials. Overall, treatment of reflux oesophagitis did not
      consistently improve forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)), peak
      expiratory flow rate, asthma symptoms, nocturnal asthma symptoms, or use of
      asthma medications in asthmatic subjects. Significant improvement in wheeze was
      reported in two studies. CONCLUSIONS: The published literature does not
      consistently support treatment of reflux oesophagitis as a means of controlling
      asthma. Further large randomised controlled trials in subjects with a
      demonstrated temporal relationship between gastro-oesophageal reflux and asthma
      are needed. These trials should be conducted over at least 6 months to allow
      adequate time to observe a treatment effect.

TI  - Ranitidine bismuth citrate can help to overcome Helicobacter pylori resistance to
      clarithromycin in vivo.
PG  - 222-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori eradication usually fails when clarithromycin is 
      used against resistant strains. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to
      test whether the apparent synergy found in vitro between ranitidine bismuth
      citrate (RBC) and clarithromycin also exists in vivo against resistant strains.
      METHODS: H. pylori was cultured and clarithromycin susceptibility was determined 
      before and after treatment, from duodenal ulcer patients receiving RBC and
      clarithromycin or omeprazole and clarithromycin for 2 weeks in a multicenter
      randomized clinical trial. RESULTS: The overall eradication rate was 88.7% in the
      RBC group (71 patients) and 52.7% in the omeprazole group (74 patients). The
      demographic characteristics of the two groups were not different.
      Clarithromycin-resistant strains were isolated in 22 cases (15.1%). A difference 
      between the eradication rates of susceptible and resistant strains was found in
      the omeprazole group but not in the RBC group. After treatment, resistance to
      clarithromycin developed in three of the seven strains (42.3%) cultured from the 
      patients of the RBC group, compared with 11 of the 26 strains (42%) of the
      omeprazole group. That is, clarithromycin-resistant strains were found in 6% and 
      27% in the RBC group and the omeprazole group, respectively, on considering the
      global results. CONCLUSION: A synergy between RBC and clarithromycin may exist in
      vivo and, while clarithromycin resistance is increasing, it is an argument for
      using RBC in triple therapies.

TI  - Changing patterns of Helicobacter pylori gastritis in long-standing acid
      suppression.
PG  - 206-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori colonization and associated inflammation are
      influenced by local acid output. Infected subjects with acid-related diseases,
      such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are likely to have an
      antral-predominant gastritis. We hypothesized that long-term acid suppression
      would result in relatively greater bacterial colonization in the corpus leading
      to diffuse or corpus-predominant gastritis and that this would be prevented by
      prior H. pylori eradication. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To investigate this, we
      conducted a prospective, double-blind trial of the effect on gastric histology of
      12-month maintenance treatment with omeprazole in H. pylori-positive GERD
      patients randomly assigned to either an eradication or omeprazole-alone regime. A
      control group of 20 H. pylori-negative GERD patients also received omeprazole
      throughout the study period. Biopsies taken at baseline and at 12 months were
      graded "blind" by a single observer according to the updated Sydney System. The
      41 H. pylori-positive subjects with grade B or C esophagitis were randomly
      assigned (20 to omeprazole alone, 21 to eradication) and 33 subjects completed
      the 12-month study. RESULTS: There was a significant decline in antral chronic
      inflammation in initially positive patients between baseline and end in both the 
      eradication group (p =.035) and the omeprazole-alone group (p =.008). However,
      corpus chronic inflammation increased in the omeprazole-alone group (p =.0156)
      but decreased in the eradication group. The change toward corpus predominance
      between baseline and end for the omeprazole-alone group is highly significant (p 
      =.0078). Furthermore, 5 of 11 in the omeprazole-alone group developed mild corpus
      atrophy, compared to 0 of 8 who had undergone H. pylori eradication. The change
      in frequency of corpus atrophy between the two groups is significant (p =.02).
      CONCLUSION: In H. pylori-positive subjects with GERD, long-term acid suppression 
      leads to a shift from antral- to corpus-predominant gastritis that can be
      prevented by prior eradication. The shift is accompanied by an increase in corpus
      atrophy. H. pylori infection should be eradicated prior to long-term acid
      suppression with proton pump inhibitors.

TI  - Curing Helicobacter pylori infection in patients with duodenal ulcer does not
      provoke gastroesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 202-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that the incidence of gastroesophageal reflux
      disease (GERD) increases after successful eradication of Helicobacter pylori
      infection. We present data on development of GERD from a controlled study of H.
      pylori eradication in 165 duodenal ulcer patients. METHODS: Patients (mean age,
      55 years; 102 men; current smokers; n = 74) were randomly assigned 2: 1 to
      receive omeprazole, 40 mg twice daily, in combination with either amoxicillin,
      750 mg twice daily, or placebo. Endoscopy and dyspeptic symptoms, including
      heartburn, were assessed at inclusion and at 6, 12, and 24 months after
      treatment. In addition, symptoms were assessed at 18 months. Patients with
      erosive esophagitis or reflux symptoms requiring treatment at inclusion were not 
      included in the study. RESULTS: Fifty-one of 145 (35%) evaluable patients
      developed heartburn, and 13 of 145 (9%) developed esophagitis during follow-up.
      The life-table analysis of the cumulated risk of developing heartburn showed that
      patients whose H. pylori infection was eradicated had a significantly lower risk 
      for developing heartburn than those with persistent H. pylori infection. The
      groups did not show any difference in cumulative risk of developing esophagitis. 
      CONCLUSION: Our data show that successful eradication of H. pylori infection does
      not increase the incidence of GERD in duodenal ulcer patients.

TI  - The HOMER Study: the effect of increasing the dose of metronidazole when given
      with omeprazole and amoxicillin to cure Helicobacter pylori infection.
PG  - 196-201
AB  - BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori eradication with omeprazole, amoxycillin, and
      metronidazole is both effective and inexpensive. However, eradication rates with 
      different dosages and dosing vary, and data on the impact of resistance are
      sparse. In this study, three different dosages of omeprazole, amoxycillin, and
      metronidazole were compared, and the influence of metronidazole resistance on
      eradication was assessed. METHODS: Patients (n = 394) with a positive H. pylori
      screening test result and endoscopy-proven duodenal ulcer in the past were
      enrolled into a multicenter study performed in four European countries and
      Canada. After baseline endoscopy, patients were randomly assigned to treatment
      for 1 week with either omeprazole, 20 mg twice daily, plus amoxycillin, 1,000 mg 
      twice daily, plus metronidazole, 400 mg twice daily (low M); or omeprazole, 40 mg
      once daily, plus amoxycillin, 500 mg three times daily, plus metronidazole, 400
      mg three times daily (medium M); or omeprazole, 20 mg twice daily, plus
      amoxycillin, 1,000 mg twice daily, plus metronidazole, 800 mg twice daily (high
      M). H. pylori status at entry was assessed by a 13C urea breath test and a
      culture. Eradication was defined as two negative 13C-urea breath test results 4
      and 8 weeks after therapy. Susceptibility testing using the agar dilution method 
      was performed at entry and in patients with persistent infection after therapy.
      RESULTS: The eradication rates, in terms of intention to treat (ITT) (population 
      n = 379) (and 95% confidence interval [CI]) were as follows: low M 76% (68%,
      84%), medium M 76% (68%, 84%), and high M 83% (75%, 89%). By per-protocol
      analysis (population n = 348), the corresponding eradication rates were: low M
      81%, medium M 80%, and high M 85%. No H. pylori strains were found to be
      resistant to amoxycillin. Prestudy resistance of H. pylori strains to
      metronidazole was found in 72 of 348 (21%) of the cultures at entry (range,
      10%-39% in the five countries). The overall eradication rate in prestudy
      metronidazole-susceptible strains was 232 of 266 (87%) and, for resistant
      strains, it was 41 of 70 (57%; p <.001). Within each group, the results were as
      follows (susceptible/resistant): low M, 85%/54%; medium M, 86%/50%; and high M,
      90%/75%. There were no statistically significant differences among the treatment 
      groups. 23 strains susceptible to metronidazole before treatment were recultured 
      after therapy failed; 20 of these had now developed resistance. CONCLUSIONS: H.
      pylori eradication rates were similar (approximately 80%) with all three
      regimens. Metronidazole resistance reduced efficacy; increasing the dose of
      metronidazole appeared not to overcome the problem or significantly improve the
      outcome. Treatment failure was generally associated with either prestudy or
      acquired metronidazole resistance. These findings are of importance when
      attempting H. pylori eradication in communities with high levels of metronidazole
      resistance.

TI  - Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): current agents and future perspective.
PG  - 1-18
AB  - The objectives of medical treatment of patients with gastroesophageal reflux
      disease (GERD) are relief of symptoms and healing of esophagitis, which can be
      achieved, at least in part, by drugs which suppress acid secretion. In patients
      with GERD symptoms and/or mild esophagitis, the best and most cost-effective
      therapeutic strategy is to start with a proton pump inhibitor with subsequent
      trial of step down of the intensity of therapy (e.g. H2-receptor antagonists). In
      patients with moderate or severe esophagitis, proton pump inhibitors are the
      mainstay of treatment and the most effective in preventing symptoms and
      esophagitis. In patients with mild disease, the recurrence of symptoms is less
      frequent and many patients may not need continuous maintenance therapy or may
      require treatment with either low dose proton pump inhibitors, H2-receptor
      antagonists or cisapride only. H. pylori eradication might be needed in GERD
      patients on long-term treatment with proton pump inhibitors, but the benefit of
      this strategy has not yet been adequately demonstrated. Antireflux surgery is a
      maintenance option for the young patient on long-term medical therapy. Improved
      medical therapy for GERD might depend on future agents with different therapeutic
      targets, including GABA inhibitors and nitric oxide modulating drugs in the
      control of the lower sphincter esophagus and in motility disorders, free radical 
      scavengers in the prevention of mucosal damage and COX-2 specific inhibitors in
      the prevention of the progression of Barret's esophagus to adenocarcinoma.
      Finally, the modulation of some growth factors might have a potential role in
      delayed esophageal ulcer healing, refractory esophagitis and in Barrett's
      esophagus.

TI  - Diagnosis and treatment of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-associated upper
      gastrointestinal toxicity.
PG  - 97-124, vi
AB  - Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely prescribed in the United
      States to treat pain and reduce inflammation from chronic inflammatory disorders 
      such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Approximately 40% of older
      Americans take NSAIDs. Chronic NSAID use carries a risk of peptic ulcer and other
      gastrointestinal disturbances. This article reviews the diagnosis of
      medication-induced ulcers based on clinical presentation, laboratory tests, and
      endoscopic findings to assist the clinician in early diagnosis and appropriate
      therapy. Risk factors for NSAID-induced ulcers include old age, poor medical
      status, prior ulcer, alcoholism, smoking, high NSAID dosage, prolonged NSAID use,
      and concomitant use of other drugs that are gastric irritants, such as
      alendronate, a bone resorption inhibitor prescribed for osteoporosis. Appropriate
      treatment options for patients with medication-induced ulcers include dosage
      reduction, medication substitution, medication withdrawal, antiulcer therapy, and
      discontinuation of other gastrotoxic drugs.

TI  - Switching between intravenous and oral pantoprazole.
PG  - 27-32
AB  - Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the most effective antisecretory drugs
      available for controlling gastric acid acidity and volume. They are the drugs of 
      choice in the treatment of moderate-to-severe gastroesophageal reflux disease,
      hypersecretory disorders, and peptic ulcers. Currently in the United States, they
      are only available in an oral formulation. However, pantoprazole will soon be
      available in an intravenous formulation and will extend the power of PPIs to
      inpatient hospital settings. Intravenous pantoprazole has been shown to be
      effective and safe in clinical trials. Intravenous pantoprazole is indicated for 
      the treatment of patients who require PPI therapy but who are unable to take oral
      medication. Intravenous pantoprazole has been shown to maintain acid suppression 
      in patients switched from oral PPIs, so no change in dosage is required when
      switching from one formulation to the other. Potential hospital-based uses for
      intravenous PPI therapy include perioperative use as prophylaxis for acid
      aspiration syndrome during induction of anesthesia, prophylaxis for
      stress-related mucosal disease, and management of gastrointestinal bleeding from 
      stress or acid peptic disease.

TI  - Esomeprazole-based Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy and the effect of
      antibiotic resistance: results of three US multicenter, double-blind trials.
PG  - 3393-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy of once-daily esomeprazole plus antibiotics
      for eradication of Helicobacter pylori, to assess the effect of antibiotic
      resistance on eradication rate, and to define the rate of emergent resistance.
      METHODS: Three separate randomized trials were performed in H. pylori-positive
      patients with a duodenal ulcer or history of documented duodenal ulcer within 5
      yrs: 1) esomeprazole (40 mg once daily), amoxicillin (1 g b.i.d.), and
      clarithromycin (500 mg b.i.d.; this combination will be referred to as EAC)
      versus esomeprazole (40 mg once daily) plus clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily;
      this combination will be referred to as EC); 2) EAC versus esomeprazole (40 mg
      once daily; E); and 3) EC versus E. Therapy was given for 10 days. Endoscopy and 
      biopsies for CLOtest, histology, and culture with susceptibility testing were
      done at baseline and 4 wk after completion of therapy. RESULTS: Per-protocol and 
      intent-to-treat eradication rates, respectively, were as follows. For EAC versus 
      EC in study 1 (N = 448), 84 versus 55% and 77 versus 52% (p < 0.001); for EAC
      versus E in study 2 (N = 98), 85 versus 5% and 78 versus 4% (p < 0.001); for EC
      versus E in study 3 (N = 66), 50% versus 0 and 46% versus 0 (p < 0.05). The 15%
      of patients in the combined studies with baseline clarithromycin resistance had
      significantly lower rates of eradication than those with susceptible strains
      (EAC: 45 vs. 89%; EC: 13 vs. 61%). Emergent resistance was less common after
      treatment with EAC [2/6 (33%)] than with EC (23/27 [85%]). CONCLUSIONS: Ten-day
      triple therapy with once-daily esomeprazole plus twice-daily amoxicillin and
      clarithromycin achieves an eradication rate virtually identical to that of the
      twice-daily proton pump inhibitor-based triple therapies. Baseline clarithromycin
      resistance, present in 15% of patients, predicts a markedly decreased rate. Use
      of an amoxicillin-containing regimen may decrease emergence of clarithromycin
      resistance.

TI  - One-week once-daily triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori--a pilot study.
PG  - 1624-6
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Proton-pump inhibitor-based triple therapy given over one to two
      weeks is currently one of the recommended regimens for eradication of
      Helicobacter pylori. Most of these regimens require twice daily intake of
      medication. The present study explored the possibility of using a one-week
      once-daily triple therapy in the eradication of H. pylori. METHODOLOGY:
      Thirty-two consecutive patients with acid-peptic disease associated with H.
      pylori infection (duodenal ulcer 18 patients; gastric ulcer 8 patients;
      duodenitis 1 patient; gastritis 5 patients) were prospectively recruited. They
      were given a 1-week course of lansoprazole 30 mg, clarithromycin modified-release
      500 mg, and metronidazole 800 mg, all taken once daily. RESULTS: The age of these
      32 patients ranged from 17-89 years with a mean of 57.5 years. Side effects
      occurred in 5 patients (15.6%; 95% CI: 5.3-32.8%). All patients finished the
      treatment and underwent a second endoscopy. Positive endoscopic finding was found
      in one patient (3.1%; 95% CI: 0.07-16.2%). On intent-to-treat and per protocol
      analysis, the eradication rate was 87.5% (95% CI: 71.0-96.5%). CONCLUSIONS: A
      one-week once-daily course of lansoprazole, clarithromycin modified release and
      metronidazole is a safe, well-tolerated, easy to comply with, and efficacious
      treatment for H. pylori infection. In view of the small sample size, further
      studies should be performed to validate its effectiveness.

TI  - Eradication of Helicobacter pylori prevents ulcer development in patients with
      ulcer-like functional dyspepsia.
PG  - 195-201
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection benefits
      patients with gastric or duodenal ulcers, the value of eradicating the infection 
      in the patients with functional dyspepsia (FD) remains controversial. AIMS: To
      determine whether eradicating H. pylori can prevent the subsequent development of
      ulcers or relieve the symptoms of functional dyspepsia patients. METHODS: In a
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 161 patients infected with H. pylori who 
      had functional dyspepsia were randomly assigned to 7 days of treatment with a
      lansoprazole-based triple therapy or placebo and then followed for 1 year. The
      main outcome measures were the development of peptic ulcers and the resolution of
      symptoms. RESULTS: H. pylori was eradicated in 63 out of 81 patients (78%) in the
      treatment group and none of the 80 patients (0%) in the placebo group. During the
      follow-up period, two patients in the treatment group and six patients in the
      placebo group developed peptic ulcers at repeat endoscopy (2.5% vs. 7.5%; 95% CI:
      -12 to 2). The reduction in ulcer rates was statistically significant in the
      'ulcer-like' sub-group (0% vs. 16.7%; 95% CI: -32 to -2), but not in the
      'dysmotility-like' and 'unclassifiable' sub-groups. Regarding symptom response,
      the resolution rates of symptoms were similar between the treatment and placebo
      groups (58.0% vs. 55.0%, 95% CI: -12 to 18). Additionally, no significant
      differences existed in the symptom responses between the treatment and control
      arms in each of the dyspepsia sub-groups. CONCLUSIONS: Eradicating H. pylori can 
      prevent the subsequent development of peptic ulcers in the patients with
      'ulcer-like' functional dyspepsia. However, this approach does not significantly 
      reduce the symptoms of functional dyspepsia patients.

TI  - Management in peptic ulcer hemorrhage: a Dutch national inquiry.
PG  - 935-42
AB  - BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: There is no consensus as to what endoscopic hemostatic
      therapy and pharmacotherapy should be used in peptic ulcer hemorrhage (PUH). We
      conducted a mail survey to investigate current management of ulcer hemorrhage in 
      the Netherlands. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to gastroenterologists or, if 
      not present, to internists, performing endoscopies, in every hospital in the
      Netherlands (n = 123). Endoscopic hemostatic therapy, pharmacotherapy, endoscopic
      reintervention, and management of Helicobacter pylori were evaluated. RESULTS:
      90/123 (73%) questionnaires were returned. Endoscopic hemostatic therapy is given
      in ulcers classified as Forrest Ia, Ib, IIa, IIb, and IIc by, respectively, 89%, 
      93%, 83%, 47%, and 19% of respondents. Gastroenterologists perform endoscopic
      therapy more often in Forrest Ib (P=0.03), IIa (P=0.002), and IIb (P=0.001)
      ulcers when compared with internists. Endoscopic injection therapy is used by 93%
      of respondents as first modality. Epinephrine combined with polidocanol is most
      commonly used (60%). Pharmacotherapy is given by 97%. A total of 71% use proton
      pump inhibitors (PPIs), and 26% use H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs), both mainly 
      initially given intravenously. In case of suspected rebleeding, endoscopic
      reintervention is performed by 76%, including a significantly greater percentage 
      of gastroenterologists (89% of gastroenterologists vs. 60% of internists,
      P=0.005), whereas the others refer the patient directly for surgery. Almost all
      respondents investigate for H. pylori. Eradication is confirmed by only 64% (80% 
      of gastroenterologists vs. 50% of internists, P=0.004). CONCLUSIONS: There are
      important differences in management of peptic ulcer hemorrhage between
      gastroenterologists and internists in the Netherlands. Management is only partly 
      in accordance with evidence-based medicine.

TI  - Effects of long-term treatment with proton pump inhibitors in gastro-oesophageal 
      reflux disease on the histological findings in the lower oesophagus.
PG  - 1125-30
AB  - BACKGROUND: The application of hyperplasia of the basal cell layer and elongation
      of the papillae in the squamous epithelium of the distal oesophagus, as
      histological criteria for the diagnosis of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease
      (GORD), continues to be controversial. An unanswered question is whether these
      changes may regress under long-term treatment with proton pump inhibitors (PPI). 
      This fact prompted us to investigate the effect of PPI treatment on the
      histological changes observed in the lower oesophagus. METHODS: 295 patients with
      endoscopically confirmed erosive GORD were investigated by endoscopy/biopsy prior
      to and during the course of a 12-month PPI treatment regimen (8 weeks acute
      treatment with 30 mg lansoprazole/day followed by long-term treatment with 15 or 
      30 mg lansoprazole or 20 mg omeprazole/day). The parameters studied were the
      frequency of ulcers and erosions and the hyperplasia of the basal cell layer and 
      elongation of the papillae prior to treatment and on day 56 (D56), after 6 months
      (M6) and after 12 months (M12) of treatment. RESULTS: In the various treatment
      groups, the results showed no statistically significant differences. Ulcers and
      erosions (prior to treatment 21% and 31%, respectively) were detected
      statistically significantly less frequently under PPI treatment (ulcers, D56: 1%,
      M6 and M12, 0%; erosions, D56: 2%, M6: 4%, M12, 3%). While high-grade hyperplasia
      of the basal cell layer and elongation of the papillae was found in 51% of the
      cases prior to treatment, the corresponding figures were only 3% (D56, M6) and 2%
      (M12). In contrast, the percentage of cases with normal oesophageal epithelium
      increased from 8% before treatment to 55% (D56), 66% (M6) and 63% (M12).
      CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows not only that erosions and ulcers heal under PPI
      treatment, but also that hyperplasia of the basal cell layer and elongation of
      papillae in the squamous epithelium of the oesophageal mucosa may normalize, and 
      are thus presumably not 'normal physiological variants'.

      gastric hypersecretion (basal acid output gt; 15 mmol/h) with either
      hypergastrinemia (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome) or normal gastrin
      (non-Zollinger-Ellison syndrome) before and during long-term treatment with
      lansoprazole. METHODS: Lansoprazole was individually titrated to reduce basal
      acid output to < 5 mmol/h (< 1 mmol/h in post-surgical Zollinger-Ellison
      syndrome). Gastric corpus biopsies were obtained every 6 months before treatment 
      and up to 8 years later. RESULTS: H. pylori was present in corpus biopsies in
      approximately 50%, causing active gastritis which resolved rapidly in 15 subjects
      after elimination of H. pylori. Patchy mild/moderate corpus atrophy was present
      at entry in two and at the end in four out of 60 patients, one being H.
      pylori-positive. Intestinal metaplasia (< 10%) was seen in six isolated biopsies 
      (1% of total). H. pylori did not affect serum gastrin, enterochromaffin-like cell
      density or hyperplasia. Enterochromaffin-like cell density was twice as high in
      Zollinger-Ellison syndrome as in non-Zollinger-Ellison syndrome patients (241 vs.
      126 cells/mm2, P < 0.001). Enterochromaffin-like cells remained normal in the
      non-Zollinger-Ellison syndrome hypersecretors regardless of H. pylori status.
      CONCLUSION: Corpus enterochromaffin-like cell increases were related to serum
      gastrin elevation, but neither H. pylori nor long-term treatment with
      lansoprazole alone or together had any effect on enterochromaffin-like cell
      density or hyperplasia. Corpus acute gastritis resulted from H. pylori infection,
      but did not result in mucosal atrophy despite long-term proton pump inhibitor
      treatment and promptly resolved with loss of H. pylori.

TI  - A multicentre study on eradication of Helicobacter pylori using four 1-week
      triple therapies in China.
PG  - 81-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Short-term proton pump inhibitor-based triple therapies for the
      eradication of Helicobacter pylori are used widely. The eradication rates vary
      greatly from country to country and from region to region. AIM: To assess the
      efficacy at eradicating H. pylori of 1-week regimens containing three
      medications: omeprazole (O) or colloidal bismuth subcitrate (B), furazolidone (F)
      or metronidazole (M), and amoxicillin (A) or clarithromycin (C). METHODS: A
      multicentre study involving 20 hospitals in different regions of China. A total
      of 892 patients with H. pylori-positive non-ulcer dyspepsia or healed duodenal
      ulcer confirmed by endoscopy were recruited to receive, randomly, one of four
      regimens: OMC, OFC, OFA, and BFC, b.d. for 7 days. 13C-urea breath test was
      performed 4-8 weeks after completion of treatment. RESULTS: The eradication rates
      with per protocol/intention-to-treat analyses were: OMC (n=217/219) 66%/65%; OFC 
      (n=227/229) 69%/69%; OFA (n=223/225) 87%/86%; and BFC (n=214/219) 80%/78%. The
      eradication rate (per protocol analysis) in duodenal ulcer (79%) was higher than 
      that in non-ulcer dyspepsia (73%, P=0.033). Patient compliance was good. The
      adverse events of the four regimens were mild, and mainly gastrointestinal.
      CONCLUSIONS: The omeprazole, furazolidine and amoxicillin regimen achieves a high
      H. pylori eradication rate in different geographical regions of China.

TI  - Cost effectiveness of initial endoscopy for dyspepsia in patients over age 50
      years: a randomised controlled trial in primary care.
PG  - 1965-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dyspepsia can be managed by initial endoscopy and treatment based on 
      endoscopic findings, or by empirical prescribing. We aimed to determine the cost 
      effectiveness of initial endoscopy compared with usual management in patients
      with dyspepsia over age 50 years presenting to their primary care physician.
      METHODS: 422 patients were recruited and randomly assigned to initial endoscopy
      or usual management. Primary outcomes were effect of treatment on dyspepsia
      symptoms and cost effectiveness. Secondary outcomes were quality of life and
      patient satisfaction. Total costs were calculated from individual patient's use
      of resources with unit costs applied from national data. Statistical analysis of 
      uncertainty on incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was done along with a 
      sensitivity analysis on unit costs with cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. 
      FINDINGS: In the 12 months following recruitment, 213 (84%) patients had an
      endoscopy compared with 75 (41%) controls. Initial endoscopy resulted in a
      significant improvement in symptom score (p=0.03), and quality of life pain
      dimension (p=0.03), and a 48% reduction in the use of proton pump inhibitors
      (p=0.005). The ICER was Pound Sterling1728 (UK Pound Sterling) per patient
      symptom-free at 12 months. The ICER was very sensitive to the cost of endoscopy, 
      and could be reduced to Pound Sterling165 if the unit cost of this procedure fell
      from Pound Sterling246 to Pound Sterling100. INTERPRETATION: Initial endoscopy in
      dyspeptic patients over age 50 might be a cost-effective intervention.

TI  - Apoptosis and osteoporosis.
PG  - 153-64
AB  - During normal bone remodeling, the rate of supply of new osteoblasts and
      osteoclasts and the timing of the death of osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and
      osteocytes by apoptosis are critical determinants of the initiation of new BMUs
      and the extension or reduction of the lifetime of existing ones. Disruption of
      the fine balance among these processes may be an important mechanism behind the
      deranged bone turnover found in most metabolic disorders of the adult skeleton.
      Like most armies, the amount 5 of work done by bone cells is far more dependent
      on numbers than vigor. Therapeutic agents that alter the prevalence of apoptosis 
      of osteoblasts and osteoclasts can correct the imbalance in cell numbers that is 
      the basis of the diminished bone mass and increased risk of fractures in
      osteoporosis.

TI  - Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug gastropathy at the new millennium: mechanisms
      and prevention.
PG  - 167-79
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced gastrointestinal 
      (GI) toxicity remains the most frequent adverse drug event in the United States. 
      The objective of this review is to update clinicians in recent advances in basic 
      and clinical investigation regarding the pathogenesis and management of NSAID
      gastropathy. METHODS: Based upon an extensive review of the published literature 
      and abstracts of key work within the past decade, the framework for new
      approaches to the prevention and treatment of NSAID-associated ulceration is
      summarized. RESULTS: The pathophysiology of NSAID-induced injury to the GI tract 
      is multifaceted and includes both prostaglandin-dependent and independent
      components. The pharmaceutical industry has capitalized on the identification of 
      two different isoforms of cyclooxygenase, enabling the development of specific
      inhibitors of one isoform that minimizes prostaglandin-dependent mechanisms that 
      contribute to NSAID-induced injury. Clinical trials support the efficacy and
      reduced toxicity of these agents. Because acid exacerbates the injury initiated
      by NSAIDs, potent acid suppressive therapy, typically with proton pump
      inhibitors, is another common approach to the treatment of NSAID-related
      dyspepsia as well as NSAID-induced ulcer disease. CONCLUSIONS: Recent
      improvements in the understanding of NSAID-induced damage and new drug
      development have provided the opportunity for effective anti-inflammatory therapy
      with reduced GI toxicity. This illustrates the importance of identifying patients
      at risk for potential complications and the appropriate use of strategies to
      prevent and treat NSAID-induced complications.

TI  - Omeprazole 40 mg once a day is equally effective as lansoprazole 30 mg twice a
      day in symptom control of patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) 
      who are resistant to conventional-dose lansoprazole therapy-a prospective,
      randomized, multi-centre study.
PG  - 1595-603
AB  - BACKGROUND: Comparative studies of omeprazole and lansoprazole are scarce and
      even scarcer are comparisons of higher doses. Most of the comparative studies
      have assessed the effect of the two proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) on gastric acid
      secretion or gastric pH. Few studies have compared clinical end-points such as
      oesophageal healing and symptom control. AIM: To determine the clinical efficacy 
      of omeprazole 40 mg daily as compared to lansoprazole 30 mg twice a day in
      symptom control of patients with severe symptomatic GERD. METHODS: Ninety-six
      patients who failed a standard dose of lansoprazole (30 mg once daily), were
      enrolled in a prospective fashion from three VA medical centres and were
      randomized to receive 6 weeks of either omeprazole 40 mg daily or lansoprazole 30
      mg twice daily. Patients reported daily on symptom severity and frequency,
      antacid consumption and side-effects. RESULTS: Forty-six patients received
      omeprazole and 44 lansoprazole. Although not statistically significant, there was
      a consistent trend of better symptom control in the omeprazole group for daytime 
      and night-time heartburn and acid regurgitation. There was no statistical
      difference between the two groups in mean antacid consumption overall and at the 
      end of each of the 6 weeks of the study. In addition, there was no significant
      difference in the overall frequency of side-effects between the two groups nor
      for each individual side-effect. CONCLUSION: Omeprazole 40 mg once daily is
      equally effective and tolerated as lansoprazole 30 mg twice daily in symptom
      control of patients with GERD.

TI  - Investigation and therapy in patients with different types of dyspepsia: a 3 year
      follow-up study from general practice.
PG  - 514-21
AB  - BACKGROUND: Decisions by GPs on investigation and treatment are based on the
      symptoms presented by the patient. The relevance of dyspepsia subgroups has been 
      questioned, but their value in general practice has not been tested. OBJECTIVE:
      The aim of this study was to investigate how dividing dyspepsia into different
      subgroups (ulcer-like, reflux-like, dysmotility-like, uncharacteristic and
      relapsing dyspepsia) affected the approach of GPs to patients with dyspeptic
      complaints. METHODS: A random sample of GPs' patients consulting for different
      dyspepsia subtypes were studied by postal questionnaires 3 years after the
      initial consultation, obtaining information from the GPs' records on
      investigations, prescriptions of dyspepsia medication and gastrointestinal
      morbidity. RESULTS: In the 3 years studied, 48% of the patients were prescribed
      dyspepsia medication, 14% were endoscoped and 3% were referred to a specialist.
      The dyspepsia subtype was significantly related to the type of drug prescribed,
      but not to investigations or referrals. Ulcer-like and reflux-like dyspepsia were
      treated in the same way. DISCUSSION: Dyspepsia subtypes significantly influenced 
      the treatment. Danish GPs treat all acid-related dyspepsia in the same way, and
      differently from other types of dyspepsia.

TI  - Pantoprazole: a new proton pump inhibitor.
PG  - 1268-93
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This paper reviews the pharmacology, clinical efficacy, and
      tolerability of pantoprazole in comparison with those of other available proton
      pump inhibitors (PPIs). METHODS: Relevant English-language research and review
      articles were identified by database searches of MEDLINE, International
      Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and UnCover, and by examining the reference lists of
      the articles so identified. In selecting data for inclusion, the author gave
      preference to full-length articles published in peer-reviewed journals. RESULTS: 
      Like other PPIs, pantoprazole exerts its pharmacodynamic actions by binding to
      the proton pump (H+,K+ -adenosine triphosphatase) in the parietal cells, but,
      compared with other PPIs, its binding may be more specific for the proton pump.
      Pantoprazole is well absorbed when administered as an enteric-coated,
      delayed-release tablet, with an oral bioavailability of approximately 77%. It is 
      hepatically metabolized via cytochrome P2C19 to hydroxypantoprazole, an inactive 
      metabolite that subsequently undergoes sulfate conjugation. The elimination
      half-life ranges from 0.9 to 1.9 hours and is independent of dose. Pantoprazole
      has similar efficacy to other PPIs in the healing of gastric and duodenal ulcers,
      as well as erosive esophagitis, and as part of triple-drug regimens for the
      eradication of Helicobacter pylori from the gastric mucosa. It is well tolerated,
      with the most common adverse effects being headache, diarrhea, flatulence, and
      abdominal pain. In clinical studies, it has been shown to have no interactions
      with various other agents, including carbamazepine, cisapride, cyclosporine,
      digoxin, phenytoin, theophylline, and warfarin. CONCLUSIONS: Pantoprazole appears
      to be as effective as other PPIs. Its low potential for drug interactions may
      give it an advantage in patients taking other drugs.

TI  - Epidermal growth factor reduces multiorgan failure induced by thioacetamide.
PG  - 34-40
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiorgan failure is a severe life threatening state where present
      therapeutic approaches are suboptimal. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a potent 
      stimulant of repair in in vitro and in vivo models. We therefore examined its
      potential beneficial effect in reducing mortality and injury induced by the
      noxious agent thioacetamide (TAA). METHODS: Mice (20 per group) were fasted
      overnight and received a single intraperitoneal dose of human recombinant EGF at 
      10 or 30 microg/kg or saline (control). Either 30 minutes before or after EGF,
      all animals also received TAA (40 mg/kg intraperitoneally). Twenty four hours
      later, surviving animals were killed, tissues collected, and degree of organ
      injury assessed. RESULTS: Fifty per cent (10/20) of control animals died within
      the first 24 hour period. Mortality was almost completely prevented by the higher
      dose of EGF whether given before or after TAA (p<0.01) and was reduced by about
      50% with the lower dose of EGF. In control animals, the entire length of the
      jejunum and ileum had necrosis with or without mucosal denudation. In contrast,
      necrosis affected only about 10-20% of the total length in EGF treated groups
      (both p<0.01 v control). Control animals showed marked glomerular tuft collapse, 
      interstitial haemorrhage, and increased plasma creatinine levels. These effects
      were significantly reduced in animals given EGF (30 microg/kg; p<0.01). All
      groups showed similar changes in liver histology (centrilobular necrosis) and
      alanine transaminase levels (10-fold increase). CONCLUSIONS: Although EGF did not
      prevent the hepatotoxicity associated with TAA, it reduced mortality, renal
      injury, and gastrointestinal damage. These studies provide preliminary evidence
      that EGF may be a novel approach for the prevention and/or treatment of
      multiorgan failure.

TI  - Omeprazole for treatment of chronic erosive esophagitis in children: a
      multicenter study of efficacy, safety, tolerability and dose requirements.
      International Pediatric Omeprazole Study Group.
PG  - 800-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of omeprazole in 
      children and to determine the doses required to heal chronic, severe esophagitis.
      STUDY DESIGN: Open multicenter study in children aged 1 to 16 years with erosive 
      reflux esophagitis. The healing dose of omeprazole used was that with which the
      duration of acid reflux was <6% of a 24-hour intraesophageal pH study. Follow-up 
      endoscopy was performed after 3 months of treatment with the healing dose.
      RESULTS: At entry, two thirds of 57 patients who completed the study had
      esophagitis grade 3 or 4 (scale 0-4); some 50% had neurologic impairment or
      repaired esophageal atresia. Of the 57 patients, 54 healed; 3 did not heal and
      left the study, and 3 healed with a second course. Doses required for healing
      were 0.7 to 3.5 mg/kg/d: 0.7 mg/kg/d in 44% of patients and 1.4 mg/kg/d in
      another 28%. Healing dose correlated with grade of esophagitis but not with age
      or underlying disease. Reflux symptoms improved dramatically in almost all of the
      57 patients, including the unhealed patients. CONCLUSIONS: Omeprazole is well
      tolerated, highly effective, and safe for treatment of erosive esophagitis and
      symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux in children, including children in whom
      antireflux surgery or other medical therapy has failed. On a per-kilogram basis, 
      the doses of omeprazole required to heal erosive esophagitis are much greater
      than those required for adults.

TI  - An epidemiological study of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding in Crete,
      Greece.
PG  - 1215-20
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Information about the epidemiology of acute upper gastrointestinal
      bleeding (UGIB) in southern Europe is very limited and especially in Greece
      non-existent. Our study sought to determine the current epidemiology of acute
      UGIB (incidence, mortality and case fatality) in the prefecture of
      Heraklion-Crete. DESIGN/METHODS: From February 1998 to February 1999, we
      prospectively obtained data on all patients with acute UGIB in the prefecture of 
      Heraklion-Crete. All patients who were permanent residents of the prefecture of
      Heraklion, aged 16 years and over with acute UGIB were included in the study.
      RESULTS: During this period, 353 cases of acute UGIB were included in the study. 
      The overall incidence of acute UGIB is 160/100,000 adults per year with a
      male-to-female ratio of 1.7 and a mean age 66.2 +/- 17.1 years. The incidence
      rises from 30 in those aged under 30 years to 609 in those aged over 75 years.
      The overall population mortality was 9/100,000 adults per year. Overall case
      fatality during hospitalization was 5.6%. All deaths occurred in patients older
      than 60 years. One or more comorbid illnesses were noted in 61% of cases. Recent 
      intake of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was reported in 49% of
      the cases. The most common recorded diagnoses were erosive disease in 108 (30.5%)
      patients, duodenal ulcer in 97 (27.4%) and gastric ulcer in 75 (21.2%).
      Rebleeding occurred in 41 patients (12%). Twelve patients (3.3%) had surgery
      during hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: The overall annual incidence of acute UGIB
      in the prefecture of Heraklion-Crete is one of the highest reported in Europe and
      increases appreciably with age. Both population mortality and case fatality are
      slightly lower compared to those reported in most previous studies.

TI  - Implications of antibiotic resistance in the management of Helicobacter pylori
      infection: Canadian Helicobacter Study Group.
PG  - 862-8
AB  - Eradication of Helicobacter pylori from the gastric and duodenal mucosa is an
      important clinical goal in the treatment of infected patients with peptic ulcer
      disease and other H pylori-associated conditions. Although several oral drug
      combination regimens are associated with eradication rates of approximately 85%
      in controlled trials, the success rate in patients infected with a resistant
      strain of H pylori is closer to 75%. Resistance to metronidazole and
      clarithromycin, which are common components of combination treatment regimens, is
      of greatest concern. Reported rates of H pylori resistance to various antibiotics
      vary considerably. In Canada, the data documenting H pylori susceptibility are
      limited but suggest that resistance to these antibiotics varies geographically
      and within specific treatment groups. Although susceptibility testing is not a
      prerequisite for initial treatment of individual patients infected with H pylori,
      formal efforts to identify and monitor both the causes and prevalence of
      antibiotic resistance across Canada are a much needed step in the ongoing
      management of this important infection. Recommended treatment regimens may be
      useful, even for treating apparently resistant H pylori strains. However, it is
      important to understand the mechanisms of the development of resistant strains to
      manage patients with treatment failure better.

TI  - Clinical experience with pantoprazole in gastroesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 1169-85; discussion 1149-50
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pantoprazole is a new proton pump inhibitor indicated for the
      treatment of erosive esophagitis associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease 
      (GERD) and is available in both oral and intravenous (IV) formulations.
      OBJECTIVE: This paper reviews the pharmacologic properties of pantoprazole and
      summarizes the findings from clinical studies of this drug. METHODS: This review 
      was compiled from the published literature, abstracts from clinical trials, and
      data on file with the manufacturer of pantoprazole. RESULTS: Pantoprazole
      selectively accumulates in the acidic environment of gastric parietal cells and
      acts at the final step of acid secretion by binding 2 key cysteine residues of
      the proton pump involved in gastric acid production. The bioavailability of
      pantoprazole is not altered by concomitant administration of food or antacids or 
      with repeated dosing. Both oral and IV formulations of pantoprazole exhibit
      linear pharmacokinetics. Several clinical trials have proved pantoprazole
      superior to histamine-2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) in reducing acid secretion
      and elevating gastric pH levels. Pantoprazole has been shown to be more effective
      than ranitidine (P < 0.05), famotidine (P < 0.001), and nizatidine (P < 0.05),
      and at least as effective as omeprazole, in healing erosive esophagitis and
      relieving associated symptoms of GERD, including regurgitation. Pantoprazole is
      also more effective than the H2RA nizatidine for the treatment of nighttime
      heartburn (P < 0.05). Studies have shown pantoprazole to be well tolerated;
      adverse events, including headache, diarrhea, flatulence, abdominal pain,
      eructation, nausea, and rash, occurred in < or = 6% of patients. The oral and IV 
      formulations of pantoprazole are equally potent in inhibiting gastric acid
      secretion; thus, switching between formulations requires no dosage adjustments.
      Special patient populations, including the elderly and patients with renal or
      mild to moderate hepatic impairment, can take pantoprazole without an adjustment 
      in dosage. CONCLUSIONS: Because of its unique pharmacokinetic properties,
      mechanism of action, and reduced potential for producing cytochrome P-450-based
      drug interactions, pantoprazole in both oral and IV formulations is effective
      over a full 24 hours and is well tolerated in a variety of patient types.

TI  - Chronic cough and gastro-oesophageal reflux: a double-blind placebo-controlled
      study with omeprazole.
PG  - 633-8
AB  - Gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) is an important cause of chronic cough. There has
      been a lack of placebo-controlled trials treating GOR related chronic cough with 
      antireflux therapy. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of
      omeprazole on GOR related chronic cough. After excluding other common causes of
      cough, oesophageal pH monitoring was performed on 48 patients with chronic cough.
      Twenty-nine patients found to have GOR were randomized in a double-blind fashion 
      to receive omeprazole 40 mg o.d. or placebo for 8 weeks. After a 2-week washout
      period, patients were crossed over to the other treatment. Symptoms were recorded
      daily in a diary. Twenty-one patients completed both treatment periods. Cough
      (p=0.02) and gastric symptoms (p=0.003) improved significantly during the
      omeprazole treatment in twelve patients who received placebo during the first and
      omeprazole during the second 8-week period. In nine patients who received
      omeprazole during the first 8-week period, amelioration in cough reached
      statistical significance only after cessation of omeprazole. Gastric symptoms
      also remained minor during placebo in these nine patients. Omeprazole 40 mg o.d. 
      seems to improve chronic cough in patients with gastrooesophageal reflux and the 
      effect of omeprazole in ameliorating both cough and reflux symptoms continues
      after treatment ceases.

TI  - Endoscopic injection therapy vs. multipolar electrocoagulation vs. laser vs.
      injection + octreotide vs. injection + omeprazole in the treatment of bleeding
      peptic ulcers. A prospective randomized study.
PG  - 1332-6
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: A prospective randomized study was performed to assess the
      effectiveness and safety of 5 different methods of hemostasis in selected
      patients with high-risk bleeding peptic ulcers. METHODOLOGY: Two hundred and
      eight patients (n = 208; mean age: 61.6 yrs) with endoscopic stigmata of active
      hemorrhage, non-bleeding vessel or adherent fresh clot were randomized during
      emergency endoscopy to receive one of the following modalities of endoscopic
      therapy (with or without pharmacological therapy): I) injection of absolute
      alcohol (n = 44); II) multipolar electrocoagulation (BICAP; n = 42); III) Nd-YAG 
      laser (n = 40); IV) injection of absolute ethanol + octreotide (n = 42); V)
      injection of absolute ethanol + omeprazole (n = 40). RESULTS: The 5 treatment
      groups were clinically and endoscopically comparable. The initial hemostatic
      success was > 90% in every group. No significant differences between groups were 
      found in any of the following parameters assessed during hospitalization:
      incidence of rebleeding (I = 14.8% vs. II = 19.0% vs. III = 16.6% vs. IV = 18.1% 
      vs. V = 20.0%; P > 0.05 mean = 17.7%); incidence of definitive hemostasis (I =
      89.3% vs. II = 85.7% vs. III = 86.6% vs. IV = 84.0% vs. V = 86.6%; P > 0.05; mean
      = 86.5%); incidence of emergency surgery (I = 8.5% vs. II = 11.9% vs. III = 10.0%
      vs. IV = 6.8% vs. V = 11.1%; P > 0.05; mean = 9.6%); mortality rate (I = 4.2% vs.
      II = 4.7% vs. III = 3.3% vs. IV = 13.6% vs. V = 4.4%; P > 0.05; mean = 6.2%).
      Mean age of deceased patients was significantly higher than living patients (71.2
      +/- 13.4 vs. 60.9 +/- 14.4; P < 0.05). Approximately 2/3 of the fatal cases were 
      strongly weakened by coexistent medical diseases. The duration of hospital stay
      was similar for all groups. The BICAP group required less units of blood
      transfusion (1.9 +/- 1.8 vs. I = 3.0 +/- 2.6; III = 3.5 +/- 3.6; IV = 2.8 +/-
      2.3; V = 3.1 +/- 2.5; P < 0.05), perhaps due to the higher mean value of
      hemoglobin of these patients at hospital admission, compared to all other groups.
      No significant complications were reported. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides good
      evidence that injection of absolute ethanol, multipolar electrocoagulation
      (BICAP) and Nd-YAG laser are equally safe and effective in the endoscopic therapy
      of acute bleeding peptic ulcers. In contrast, no additional hemostatic benefits
      arose from the association of pharmacological agents (octreotide or omeprazole)
      to sclerosis injection.

TI  - Eradication of Helicobacter pylori compared with long-term acid suppression in
      duodenal ulcer disease. A randomized trial with 2-year follow-up. The Danish
      Ulcer Study Group.
PG  - 1023-32
AB  - BACKGROUND: Trials evaluating long-term management of duodenal ulcer disease have
      mainly been focused on recurrence of ulcers, disregarding effects on dyspeptic
      and reflux symptoms. Profound acid inhibition with a proton pump inhibitor is the
      gold standard therapy in acid-related diseases. We aimed to compare the
      symptomatic effects of eradication therapy with those of long-term omeprazole
      treatment in a design with periods both with and without acid inhibition.
      METHODS: Patients with active duodenal ulcer were randomized either to
      omeprazole, 20 mg twice daily until healing, followed by omeprazole, 20 mg/ day
      for 1 year, or to eradication therapy (metronidazole, amoxicillin, and omeprazole
      for 2 weeks) followed by placebo for 1 year. All patients were followed up
      passively for an additional year. Clinical controls were performed every 2 months
      the 1st year (maintenance phase) and every 6 months during the passive follow-up 
      phase. The study was multicentric and double-blind. The primary end-point was
      discontinuation of treatment, irrespective of reason. RESULTS: Two hundred and
      seventy-six patients were randomized (139 in the eradication treatment group). In
      the maintenance phase there were no differences in the reporting of dyspeptic
      symptoms or in premature withdrawal. In the passive follow-up phase only five
      patients in the eradication therapy group discontinued owing to relapse of
      dyspeptic symptoms or ulcer, compared with 51 patients initially randomized to
      long-term omeprazole. There were no differences in reflux symptoms or in the
      development of reflux oesophagitis. CONCLUSIONS: Eradication therapy and
      long-term omeprazole are equally effective in controlling dyspeptic symptoms and 
      reflux in duodenal ulcer patients with healed ulcers. One-quarter of the duodenal
      ulcer patients who start eradication therapy continue to be symptomatic or fail
      therapy for other reasons over a 2-year period. Eradication therapy does not
      increase the risk of reflux in ulcer patients.

      Pediatric Omeprazole Pharmacokinetic Group.
PG  - 3101-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine the pharmacokinetics of orally
      administered omeprazole in children. METHODS: Plasma concentrations of omeprazole
      were measured at steady state over a 6-h period after administration of the drug.
      Patients were a subset of those in a multicenter study to determine the dose,
      safety, efficacy, and tolerability of omeprazole in the treatment of erosive
      reflux esophagitis in children. Children were 1-16 yr of age, with erosive
      esophagitis and pathological acid reflux on 24 h-intraesophageal pH study. The
      "healing dose" of omeprazole was that at which subsequent intraesophageal pH
      study normalized. Children remained on this dose for 3 months, and during this
      period the pharmacokinetics were measured. RESULTS: A total of 57 children were
      enrolled in the overall healing phase of the study. Pharmacokinetic study was
      optional for subjects and was performed in 25 of the 57 enrolled. The doses of
      omeprazole required were substantially higher doses per kilogram of body weight
      than in adults. Values of the pharmacokinetic parameters of omeprazole were
      generally within the ranges previously reported in adults. However, the plasma
      levels, area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), plasma
      half-life (t(1/2)), and maximal plasma concentration (Cmax), were lower in the
      younger age group, when the AUC and Cmax were normalized to a dose of 1 mg/kg.
      Furthermore, within the group as a whole, these values showed a gradation from
      lowest in the children 1-6 yr of age to higher in the older age groups.
      CONCLUSIONS: The pharmacokinetics of omeprazole in children showed a trend toward
      higher metabolic capacity with decreasing age, being highest at 1-6 yr of age.
      This may explain the need for higher doses of omeprazole on a per kilogram basis,
      not only in children overall compared with adults but, in many cases,
      particularly in younger children.

TI  - Optimizing endoscopic biopsy detection of early cancers in Barrett's high-grade
      dysplasia.
PG  - 3089-96
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The of high-grade dysplasia management (HGD) in Barrett's esophagus
      remains controversial, in part, because of uncertainty about the ability of
      endoscopic biopsies to consistently detect early, curable cancers. METHODS: Here 
      we report cancers we have diagnosed in 45 patients with Barrett's HGD using a
      protocol involving serial endoscopies with four-quadrant biopsies taken at 1-cm
      intervals. We compare these results to a modeled endoscopic biopsy protocol in
      which four-quadrant biopsies are taken every 2 cm in the Barrett's segment.
      RESULTS: Thirteen cancers were detected at the baseline endoscopy and 32 in
      surveillance. In 82% of patients, cancer was detected at a single 1-cm level of
      the esophagus, and in 69% the cancer was detected in a single endoscopic biopsy
      specimen. A 2-cm protocol missed 50% of cancers that were detected by a 1-cm
      protocol in Barrett's segments 2 cm or more without visible lesions. The maximum 
      depth of cancer invasion was intramucosal in 96% of patients. Only 39% of
      patients who had endoscopic biopsy cancer diagnoses had cancer detected in the
      esophagectomy specimen. Adverse outcomes included the development of regional
      metastatic disease during surveillance (1 of 32), operative mortality (3 of 36), 
      including two patients who had their primary surgeries at other institutions, and
      death from metastatic disease after endoscopic ablation performed at another
      institution (1 of 3). CONCLUSIONS: A four-quadrant, 1-cm endoscopic biopsy
      protocol performed at closely timed intervals consistently detects early cancers 
      arising in HGD in Barrett's esophagus and should be used in patients with HGD who
      do not undergo surgical resection.

TI  - Rabeprazole for the prevention of pathologic and symptomatic relapse of erosive
      or ulcerative gastroesophageal reflux disease. Rebeprazole Study Group.
PG  - 3081-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effectiveness and safety profile of 10 and 20 mg of
      rabeprazole, a new proton pump inhibitor, once daily versus placebo in preventing
      endoscopic and symptomatic relapse for up to 1 yr among patients with healed
      erosive or ulcerative gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). METHODS: The 52-wk 
      trial used a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group design in
      which 209 men and women were assigned to 10 or 20 mg of rabeprazole once daily in
      the morning or placebo. RESULTS: Both rabeprazole doses were significantly
      superior to placebo in preventing endoscopic relapse (p < 0.001), and 20 mg was
      significantly more effective than 10 mg (p < 0.04). Both doses were also
      significantly superior to placebo in reducing the frequency and severity of
      heartburn relapse (p < 0.001). When adjusted for differences in exposure to study
      medication, no significant differences were found in the incidence of adverse
      events. No clinically significant changes were found regarding clinical
      laboratory parameters, vital signs, electrocardiograms, ophthalmological
      evaluations, body weight, serum gastrin, and enterochromaffin-like cell
      histology. CONCLUSIONS: Once-daily therapy with 10 or 20 mg of rabeprazole
      effectively prevents pathological and symptomatic GERD relapse. The 20-mg dose is
      significantly more effective than the 10-mg dose in preventing endoscopic
      recurrence. Treatment was well tolerated, and no clinically significant safety
      findings emerged. Our findings support rabeprazole's efficacy in preventing GERD 
      recurrence with excellent tolerability and a short-term favorable safety profile.

TI  - Oral pantoprazole for erosive esophagitis: a placebo-controlled, randomized
      clinical trial. Pantoprazole US GERD Study Group.
PG  - 3071-80
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this dose-response study was to compare the effectiveness 
      of 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg of pantoprazole with that of placebo tablets in the
      healing and symptom relief of gastroesophageal reflux disease associated with
      erosive esophagitis, and to determine the optimal dose. METHODS: A total of 603
      patients with endoscopically confirmed (Hetzel-Dent scale) erosive esophagitis of
      grade 2 (64.5%) or grades 3 or 4 (35.3%) were enrolled in a double-blind,
      multicenter study and randomly assigned to receive pantoprazole (10 mg, 20 mg, or
      40 mg) or placebo, administered once daily in the morning, for 4 or 8 wk
      depending on healing. RESULTS: The healing rates after 4 wk for placebo and
      pantoprazole 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg/day were 14%, 42%, 55%, and 72%,
      respectively (p < 0.001 for all doses of pantoprazole vs placebo). Cumulative
      healing rates after 8 wk for placebo and pantoprazole 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg/day
      were 33%, 59%, 78%, and 88%, respectively (p < 0.001 for all doses of
      pantoprazole vs placebo). The 40-mg pantoprazole dose produced greater rates of
      healing and earlier healing of esophagitis than either the 10- or 20-mg dose,
      regardless of severity. Pantoprazole, at any dose, was significantly more
      effective than placebo in relieving reflux symptoms. Patients on pantoprazole 40 
      mg experienced relief of symptoms on day 1 of treatment. No serious
      treatment-related adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Pantoprazole was safe and
      effective for healing erosive esophagitis and provided rapid symptomatic relief. 
      These results indicate that pantoprazole offers a new option for treatment of
      erosive esophagitis. Among the three doses studied, the 40-mg dose was the most
      effective.

TI  - Peptic ulcer recurrence during maintenance therapy with H2-receptor antagonist
      following first-line therapy with proton pump inhibitor.
PG  - 824-31
AB  - We investigated the peptic ulcer recurrence rates during maintenance therapy with
      H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) following first-line therapy with a proton pump
      inhibitor (PPI). Patients with gastric ulcer (GU) or duodenal ulcer (DU) were
      enrolled in this study; 583 eligible patients (GU, 325; DU, 258) were
      administered lansoprazole (30 mg/day for 8 weeks for GU, and the same dosage for 
      6 weeks for DU) as first-line therapy, and a half dose of H2RA as maintenance
      therapy for 12 months. Endoscopic photographs were taken before administration
      and after 8 (GU) and 6 (DU) weeks of lansoprazole administration. Ulcer stage was
      evaluated using the classification of Sakita and Miwa. Endoscopic examinations
      were performed 6 months or 12 months after the start of maintenance therapy or
      when a recurrence was suspected because of the appearance of subjective symptoms.
      The healing rates for GU and DU patients after completion of lansoprazole therapy
      were 79% in both groups, while the S2-stage healing rates were 18% and 31%,
      respectively. At 1 year after the start of maintenance therapy, the recurrence
      rates were 25% for GU and 39% for DU patients. In DU patients, the recurrence
      rates from S1-stage and S2-stage were 49% and 20%, respectively (P = 0.004), but 
      no significant difference was found between these rates in GU patients. The
      recurrence rates in H. pylori-positive patients before lansoprazole
      administration were 27% for GU and 43% for DU patients. We concluded that the
      maintenance therapy with a half-dose of H2RA following PPI therapy was
      insufficient to prevent recurrences of GU and DU.

TI  - Are the orally administered proton pump inhibitors equivalent? A comparison of
      lansoprazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole, and rabeprazole.
PG  - 482-93
AB  - Four proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are currently marketed in various parts of the
      world, and all of these (lansoprazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole, and rabeprazole)
      are available for prescription use in the United States. As a therapeutic group, 
      the PPIs are highly useful for the relief of symptoms and healing of
      gastroesophageal reflux disease, gastric and duodenal ulcer disease, eradication 
      of Helicobacter pylori infection, prevention and treatment of nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-associated damage, management of hypersecretory
      states such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, and care of patients with non-variceal
      upper gastrointestinal bleeding, or non-ulcer dyspepsia. The pathophysiologic
      basis of these management benefits lies in the potent gastric acid inhibitory
      effects of the PPIs. There are differences between the PPIs in their
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, influence by food and antacids, clinical
      efficacy, and potential for drug interactions. It is not always clear whether
      these often subtle variations are necessarily of clinical importance. The
      physician's choice of one PPI over another must rest with her/his interpretation 
      of the clinical importance of the generally small differences between PPIs, their
      approval for treatment of specific clinical indications within the physician's
      practice jurisdiction, and the strength of the evidence based on the quantity and
      quality of the supporting clinical trials.

TI  - Triple therapy with clarithromycin, omeprazole, and amoxicillin for eradication
      of Helicobacter pylori in duodenal ulcer patients in Asia and Africa.
PG  - 1529-35
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies assessing the efficacy of triple therapy containing
      clarithromycin and amoxicillin for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori
      infection and healing of duodenal ulcers in Asian and African countries are
      limited. AIM: To determine the efficacy and safety of 1-week triple therapy with 
      omeprazole, amoxicillin and clarithromycin for eradicating H. pylori infection in
      patients with active duodenal ulcer living in Asian and African regions. METHODS:
      This was an open-label, multicentre study in 11 centres in Asia and Africa.
      Patients with endoscopy-proven duodenal ulcer and who were H. pylori-positive
      were treated with clarithromycin 500 mg, omeprazole 20 mg, and amoxicillin 1000
      mg, all given twice daily for 7 days. Upper endoscopy was repeated at week 6 to
      check for ulcer healing and H. pylori status. RESULTS: A total of 117 patients
      were recruited. H. pylori eradication rates were 85% by per protocol analysis and
      80% by intention-to-treat analysis. Ulcer healing was found in 94% of subjects
      (per protocol analysis). Clinical success, measured by change of pre-treatment
      ulcer symptoms, was strongly supported by complete resolution or improvement in
      100% of the evaluable patients (per protocol analysis). Since treatment-related
      adverse events, when present, were largely mild or moderate, the triple therapy
      regimen was considered safe. CONCLUSION: Seven-day triple therapy with
      omeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin was efficacious for treating Asian
      and African patients with duodenal ulcer disease associated with H. pylori
      infection, and the treatment regimen was well-tolerated.

TI  - Identifying responders to acid suppression in dyspepsia using a random starting
      day trial.
PG  - 1485-94
AB  - BACKGROUND: Functional dyspepsia is a heterogeneous condition and a uniform
      response to drug treatment is not likely. This may be the reason for the general 
      failure of acid suppression in clinical trials in these patients. It may be more 
      rewarding to identify true responders to drug treatment by a single subject
      trial. AIM: To develop and to test a novel single subject trial design (random
      starting day trial) in dyspeptic patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 301
      dyspeptic patients entered a 16-day trial. All patients received placebo for the 
      first 4 days and switched to omeprazole at a randomized and blinded day between
      day 5 and day 14. Response was defined as a sustained >/= 50% decrease in symptom
      score occurring in relation to drug shifting. RESULTS: Spontaneous response
      varied between 0.3% and 10.6% per day, uniformly distributed over time. Overall, 
      53-61% of patients with organic dyspepsia had a symptom response in relation to
      shifting to active treatment, compared to only 23% of patients with functional
      dyspepsia. The only predictor of response was symptoms suggesting
      gastro-oesophageal reflux. CONCLUSIONS: A random starting day trial may be a
      valuable tool to identify response to acid suppression in dyspeptic patients.

      amoxicillin and lansoprazole for Helicobacter pylori-associated gastric ulcer?
PG  - 761-6
AB  - PURPOSE: To clarify whether the depth of ulceration evaluated by endoscopic
      ultrasonography (EUS) influences a modified dual therapy with amoxicillin and
      lansoprazole for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori-positive patients with
      gastric ulcer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-two consecutive cases of gastric
      ulcer (nine superficial ulcers and 13 deep ulcers) in H pylori-positive patients 
      were studied. Ten of 22 patients received a two-week eradication therapy with
      amoxicillin 1500 mg/day, lansoprazole 30 mg/day and a new antiulcer agent with
      features in common with sucralfate, ecabet sodium, 2.0 g/day. They continued to
      receive the same doses of lansoprazole and ecabet sodium for the next six weeks. 
      The other 12 patients received the same therapy except for those who underwent
      the four-week amoxicillin treatment. All patients underwent EUS both at the start
      of the study and eight weeks later. They then received ecabet sodium alone for
      the next six months as a maintenance therapy, followed by a six-month interval
      with no treatment. The final endoscopy was done one year after H pylori
      eradication therapy was completed to evaluate H pylori status and ulcer
      recurrence. RESULTS: The rates of endoscopic healing and H pylori eradication in 
      the nine patients with superficial ulcer were 100%, irrespective of the period of
      amoxicillin treatment. In contrast, the rates of endoscopic evidence of healing
      and H pylori eradication in the 13 patients with deep ulcer were different for
      each period of amoxicillin treatment; that is, the rates of reduction in ulcer
      determined by echo and H pylori eradication in the four patients treated with the
      two-week amoxicillin course were significantly lower (P=0.03) than those in the
      nine patients treated with the four-week course. CONCLUSION: Ulcer depth is
      likely to influence the success of amoxicillin treatment for H pylori-positive
      patients with gastric ulcer.

TI  - In vitro susceptibility of Helicobacter pylori to, and in vivo suppression by,
      antimicrobials used in selective decontamination of the digestive tract.
PG  - 803-5
AB  - The incidence of bleeding related to stress ulcers is reduced in critically ill
      patients in whom gut decontamination has been performed; this may be a result of 
      suppression of Helicobacter pylori infection. We determined the susceptibility of
      H. pylori to the applied antibiotics. In nine of 10 critically ill patients
      (using intravenous cefotaxime and topical polymyxin, tobramycin and amphotericin 
      B (PTA) given by nasogastric tube) and all six volunteers (using PTA alone), H.
      pylori was suppressed as long as the topical antibiotics were ingested. The in
      vitro studies revealed that all strains were susceptible to cefotaxime and
      tobramycin. The strains were not susceptible to polymyxin or amphotericin B.

TI  - Influence of Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy on 13C aminopyrine breath
      test: comparison among omeprazole-, lansoprazole-, or pantoprazole-containing
      regimens.
PG  - 2762-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Proton pump inhibitors and antimicrobial agents are widely used to
      eradicate Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. In the general population
      the prevalence of infection and of polypharmacy increases the possibility of
      drug-drug interactions during H. pylori eradication therapy. The purpose of the
      present study was to assess the prevalence, degree, and clinical relevance of
      metabolic interference with the cytochrome P450 enzymatic system occurring during
      1 wk of administration of omeprazole, lansoprazole, or pantoprazole followed by
      the association of clarithromycin and metronidazole for another week. The 13C
      aminopyrine breath test (ABT) was chosen to screen for possible interactions.
      METHODS: We studied 30 patients referred to our Unit for H. pylori eradication
      therapy. They were randomized to receive either omeprazole (20 mg b.i.d.),
      lansoprazole (30 mg b.i.d.), or pantoprazole (40 mg b.i.d.) for 2 wk. During the 
      second week clarithromycin (250 mg b.i.d.) and metronidazole (500 mg b.i.d.) were
      added. ABT was performed before, and at the end of the first and second week of
      therapy. Percentage of the administered dose of 13C recovered per hour at the
      peak (percent 13C dose/h at the peak) and cumulative percentage of administered
      dose of 13C recovered over time at 120 min (percent 13C dose cum120) were the ABT
      evaluated parameters. RESULTS: At baseline all patients showed a normal liver
      function. In individual patients during treatment we observed various liver
      metabolic interactions both as inhibition and induction, as well as after the
      first and the second week of therapy. However, mean modifications of the ABT
      parameters during the 2 weeks of therapy were not statistically significant
      compared to baseline values. None of the patients who had ABT variations
      complained of side effects. CONCLUSIONS: H. pylori eradication therapy interferes
      with cytochrome P450-dependent liver metabolic activity. However, the clinical
      relevance of these metabolic interactions is not yet apparent, and further
      investigation is needed. H. pylori eradication therapy appears safe, but these
      interactions should be considered in the choice of proton pump inhibitor and
      antimicrobial agents.

TI  - Photodynamic therapy for dysplastic Barrett's oesophagus: a prospective, double
      blind, randomised, placebo controlled trial.
PG  - 612-7
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a treatment in which cell
      damage is achieved by the action of light on a photosensitizing agent. We have
      assessed the potential use of PDT in the ablation of Barrett's oesophagus.
      METHODS: Thirty six patients with dysplastic Barrett's oesophagus receiving acid 
      suppression medication with omeprazole were randomised to receive oral
      5-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) 30 mg/kg or placebo, followed four hours later by
      laser endoscopy. Follow up endoscopy was performed at one, six, 12, and 24
      months. RESULTS: Of 18 patients in the ALA group, a response was seen in 16
      (median decrease in area in the treated region 30%; range 0-60%). In the placebo 
      group, a decrease in area of 10% was observed in two patients with no change in
      16 (median 0%; range 0-10%; treatment v placebo, p<0.001). No dysplasia was seen 
      in the columnar epithelium within the treatment area of any patient in the PDT
      group. However, in the placebo group, persistent low grade dysplasia was found in
      12 patients (p<0.001). There were no short or long term major side effects. The
      effects of treatment were maintained for up to 24 months. CONCLUSIONS: This is
      the first randomised controlled trial of PDT for Barrett's oesophagus. It
      demonstrates that ALA induced PDT can provide safe and effective ablation of low 
      grade dysplastic epithelium.

TI  - Medical or surgical treatment for chronic gastrooesophageal reflux? A systematic 
      review of published evidence of effectiveness.
PG  - 713-21
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of medical (antacids, histamine
      antagonists and proton pump inhibitors) and surgical (fundoplication) treatment
      of chronic GORD. SUBJECTS: Patients with objective (endoscopic or pH) evidence of
      chronic reflux reported in 6 randomised trials and 3 cohort studies, 1966-1999.
      METHODS: Systematic review of comparative studies identified from electronic
      searches, citations, manual searches of journals, and correspondence with authors
      and experts. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Improvements in prevalence or severity of
      symptoms, oesophagitis, pH reflux duration, lower oesophageal sphincter pressure,
      patients' satisfaction, and side-effects. RESULTS: Improved outcomes were more
      common after surgical than medical treatment with significant differences in
      objective outcomes in 5/6 randomised trials and in 2/3 cohort studies. Subjective
      outcomes (symptoms and patients' satisfaction) were also more common among
      surgical patients in all but one study that assessed them. Odds ratios for
      improvement with surgical rather than medical treatment ranged from 1.2 to 200,
      and numbers needed to treat ranged from 1.2 to 58, where these could be
      calculated. Studies were too heterogeneous for meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In
      trials of chronic severe GORD, surgery is consistently more effective than
      medical treatment in relieving symptoms and objective oesophagitis, although
      omeprazole can give similar symptom relief with adjustment of the dose.

TI  - Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
PG  - 1329-44
AB  - NSAID-associated dyspeptic symptoms are common and can be managed empirically
      with an H2-receptor antagonist or a proton-pump inhibitor. Treatment of
      established gastroduodenal ulcers is accomplished best by withholding the
      offending drugs. Proton-pump inhibitors appear to heal ulcers at the same rate
      whether or not NSAID therapy is continued. After the ulcer is healed and if NSAID
      therapy must be continued, prophylaxis is accomplished best by the concomitant
      use of proton-pump inhibitors, misoprostol (at least 200 micrograms 3 times a
      day), or a NSAID that preferentially inhibits COX-2. The future development of
      newer, safer NSAID preparations, including highly selective COX-2 inhibitors and 
      nitric oxide-releasing NSAIDs, should provide better treatment options for the
      increasing number of individuals requiring anti-inflammatory agents.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori infection and eradication in paediatric patients.
PG  - 357-65
AB  - Helicobacter pylori is now recognised to be typically acquired during childhood. 
      Studies also indicate that the infection is frequently lost in childhood;
      however, it is still unclear whether this is related to the use of
      antibacterials, the natural history of the infection, or both. H. pylori
      colonises gastric mucosa and is causally related to chronic gastritis and peptic 
      ulcer disease in both children and adults. Successful eradication of H. pylori
      has resulted in the healing of duodenal ulcers and the lowering of the ulcer
      relapse rate in children. Therapy to cure the infection should be started in all 
      children with peptic (duodenal or gastric) ulcer who are still infected. The
      ideal anti-H. pylori regimen should be safe, cheap, easy to comply with, well
      tolerated by children and able to achieve a high cure rate. Although US data are 
      lacking, it is anticipated that the treatment regimen for children should be
      similar to that in adults (a triple therapy regimen that combines a proton pump
      inhibitor with 2 antimicrobial agents for 14 days). It is inappropriate to
      prescribe anti-H. pylori therapy without a firm diagnosis. The use of multiple
      antibacterials in a paediatric patient with an ulcer but without H. pylori
      infection cannot provide any benefit to the patient or the community. Such an
      approach only provides the possibility for adverse effects, for example
      development of antibacterial resistance among bystander bacteria. It is very
      important to confirm the diagnosis of H. pylori infection. The [13C]urea breath
      test is the noninvasive method of choice to determine H. pylori status in
      children and the ideal test for post-therapy testing. There is a need for
      post-therapy confirmation because of the likelihood of poor outcome for some
      treatment regimens, which is why post-therapy testing should be the standard of
      care. There is weak and inconsistent evidence of an association between H. pylori
      infection and recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) in children, in part because of the 
      unclear definition of RAP in the literature. Therefore, there is still
      considerable debate regarding the treatment of infected children with RAP.

TI  - High dose proton pump inhibitor response as an initial strategy for a clinical
      diagnosis of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Swedish multi-centre group
      in primary health care.
PG  - 401-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in primary 
      care rests primarily on symptoms. Oesophageal acid exposure is the most important
      pathogenic factor and it is likely that symptom response to acid inhibition also 
      identifies patients with GERD. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate
      the outcome of a symptom-based strategy in the management of GERD patients in
      primary care. METHODS: Patients in general practice with main symptoms of at
      least moderate heartburn or regurgitation were given omeprazole 20 mg b.i.d.
      openly for 7 days (first phase). Responders with later relapse were randomized to
      double-blind treatment with omeprazole 20 mg o.m. or placebo for 2 weeks (second 
      phase). A response in both phases was defined as a decrease by at least three
      grades on a seven-grade Likert scale and no more than mild intensity of the main 
      symptom. RESULTS: Of the 362/371 recruited patients who were evaluated in the
      first phase, 73% were responders. A total of 174/179 patients with a relapse were
      assessed in the second phase, and 74 and 28% in the omeprazole and placebo group,
      respectively, were defined as responders (P: < 0.001, 95% confidence interval
      33-59). CONCLUSIONS: GERD patients are highly responsive to omeprazole 20 mg
      b.i.d. They are equally responsive to omeprazole 20 mg o.m. at symptomatic
      relapse, but have a low response rate to placebo. Omeprazole is a valuable
      therapeutic instrument to detect and treat patients with GERD in general
      practice.

TI  - Treatment of the gastric stump ulcer: an open study with five drugs.
PG  - 1195-8
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Despite a great progress in the treatment of peptic ulcer
      disease, the management of gastric stump ulcers still remains to be established. 
      METHODOLOGY: Eighty-one patients with peptic ulcer developed postoperatively in
      the gastric remnant were treated in an open trial with 5 antiulcer drugs
      (cimetidine, omeprazole, sucralfate, colloidal bismuth and misoprostol)
      characterized by different mechanisms of action. The ulcer healing rate was
      evaluated endoscopically after 2, 4 and 6 weeks. RESULTS: It was found that after
      2 weeks the most rapid ulcer healing was in the omeprazole and cimetidine treated
      groups, 67 and 43% of healing, respectively. Also after 4 weeks the antisecretors
      were more effective than gastroprotective drugs; ulcer healing rate for
      omeprazole was 87% and cimetidine 68%, while for sucralfate, colloidal bismuth
      and misoprostol 50%, 52%, and 33%, respectively. After 6 weeks all drugs
      represented very close ulcer healing rates. CONCLUSIONS: Both antisecretory and
      gastroprotective drugs may be useful in the management of stump ulcers, however, 
      to initiate and accelerate the stump ulcer healing omeprazole appears to be the
      drug of choice.

TI  - Changes in Helicobacter pylori-induced gastritis in the antrum and corpus during 
      long-term acid-suppressive treatment in Japan.
PG  - 1345-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have shown that acid-suppressive therapy aggravates
      corpus gastritis in patients with Helicobacter pylori infection, promoting the
      development of atrophic gastritis. AIM: To study the effects of long-term use of 
      antisecretory agents on the H. pylori-positive gastric mucosa in Japan, a country
      with a high incidence of gastric cancer. METHODS: A total of 141 H.
      pylori-positive patients who had peptic ulcers or reflux oesophagitis were
      treated for 3 years with either omeprazole (20 mg/day) alone (n=7) or with
      omeprazole for primary therapy (8 weeks), followed by famotidine (40 mg/day) for 
      maintenance therapy (n=134). Endoscopy was performed before, during, and after
      treatment. Biopsy specimens were taken from the greater curvature of the antrum
      and corpus and were examined histologically. RESULTS: The long-term use of
      famotidine after 8 weeks of treatment with omeprazole distinctly decreased H.
      pylori density and neutrophil infiltration in the antrum, but did not change H.
      pylori density in the corpus. The gastritis score increased in patients who had
      no, or only mild corpus gastritis before treatment (n=74), and significantly
      decreased in those who had moderate or severe gastritis before treatment (n=60). 
      In four of the seven patients who received long-term treatment with omeprazole
      alone, neutrophil infiltration and H. pylori density decreased not only in the
      antrum but also in the corpus. There was no increase in intestinal metaplasia or 
      mucosal atrophy as assessed endoscopically during follow-up. CONCLUSION: Changes 
      in corpus gastritis in response to acid-suppressive therapy depend on the
      severity of gastritis before treatment. Long-term use of acid-suppressive therapy
      apparently does not accelerate the development of atrophy or intestinal
      metaplasia in Japanese patients.

TI  - Third line treatment for Helicobacter pylori: a prospective, culture-guided study
      in peptic ulcer patients.
PG  - 1335-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: A third line treatment is needed in roughly 5% of patients infected
      with Helicobacter pylori. Few data have been reported on efficacy of treatment
      regimens in these patients. METHODS: A prospective trial was designed to study
      the effectiveness of third line treatment of H. pylori infection in ulcer
      patients. Two-week quadruple, culture-guided, combinations were used in 31
      consecutive patients. Susceptibility to metronidazole and clarithromycin were
      studied by E-test, and thereafter a predetermined treatment regimen was used.
      Compliance was evaluated by pill count, and eradication defined by negative urea 
      breath test at 6 weeks. RESULTS: Two main quadruple regimens were used in 29
      patients. In spite of good compliance, the combination of omeprazole,
      tetracycline, bismuth and clarithromycin (OTBC) showed an eradication rate (per
      protocol analysis) of 36% (five out of 14; CI: 12.8-64.9), and if amoxycillin was
      used (OTBA) the rate was 67% (eight out of 12; CI: 34.9-90.1). The difference was
      not significant. No clinical factor was found to be associated with failure to
      eradicate. CONCLUSIONS: Third line treatment often fails to eradicate H. pylori
      infection. New strategies need to be developed and tested for this common
      clinical situation.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori-positive duodenal ulcer: three-day antibiotic eradication
      regimen.
PG  - 1329-34
AB  - BACKGROUND: The most widely used treatments for ulcer healing and Helicobacter
      pylori eradication consist of a 1-2 week regimen of a proton pump inhibitor plus 
      two or three antimicrobials. AIMS: To evaluate the efficacy, safety, cost, and
      tolerance of a three-day regimen with three antibiotics vs. a 10-day treatment
      with a proton pump inhibitor or vs. a ranitidine bismuth citrate triple therapy. 
      METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-one patients with endoscopically-proven H.
      pylori-positive duodenal ulcers were recruited to the study. Recruited patients
      were assigned to one of the following four regimens: (I) omeprazole 40 mg o.m.
      plus amoxycillin 1 g b.d. and clarithromycin 500 mg b.d. for 10 days (OAC: 55
      patients); (ii) omeprazole 40 mg o.m. on days 1-5, plus amoxycillin 1 g b.d.,
      clarithromycin 500 mg b.d. and metronidazole 500 mg b.d. on days 3-5 (OACM: 56
      patients); (iii) ranitidine bismuth citrate 400 mg b.d. plus amoxycillin 1 g b.d.
      and clarithromycin 500 mg b.d. for 10 days (RAC: 54 patients); (iv) ranitidine
      bismuth citrate 400 mg b.d. on days 1-5, plus amoxycillin 1 g b.d.,
      clarithromycin 500 mg b.d. and metronidazole 500 mg b.d. on days 3-5 (RACM: 56
      patients). Fisher's exact test was used to compare data regarding healing and
      eradication in the four groups. RESULTS: The intention-to-treat eradication and
      ulcer healing rates for the RACM regimen were 95% and 98%, respectively.
      Statistically significant differences were observed, relating to the eradication 
      and healing of ulcers, between RACM and either the RAC or OAC regimens.
      CONCLUSION: The three-day antibiotic therapy with amoxycillin, clarithromycin and
      metronidazole in addition to ranitidine bismuth citrate is a very effective
      anti-H. pylori regimen.

      studies in a global OR (Peto method) both on an intention-to-treat (ITT) and on a
      per protocol (PP) basis. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies fulfilled the inclusion
      criteria. Eighteen studies reported ITT and 20 PP analysis. Mean H. pylori
      eradication rates were 81% (95% CI: 79-83%) ITT, and 84% (82-86%) PP with PCA,
      and 81% (78-83%) ITT and 84% (82-86%) PP with PCN; the odds ratio for the effect 
      of PCA vs. PCN was 1 (0.83-1.22) on an ITT, and 0.98 (0.8-1.2) on a PP basis.
      Subanalysis showed that mean H. pylori eradication efficacy with PC(250 b.d.)A
      was 81% (78-85%) ITT, vs. 86% (83-89%) with PC(250 b.d.)N. The odds ratio for
      this comparison was 0.68 (0.48-0.98). Finally, when comparing PC(500 b.d. )A
      against PC(250 b.d.)N ITT cure rates were 77% (74-80%), and 75% (72-78%) with an 
      odds ratio of 1.18 (0.93-1.5). CONCLUSION: Overall, one-week combination regimens
      of PCA and PCN present similar H. pylori eradication efficacy. Nevertheless, the 
      PCN regimen obtains significantly better results when using low doses of C (250
      mg b.d.).

TI  - Proton pump inhibitors: better acid suppression when taken before a meal than
      without a meal.
PG  - 1267-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: Proton pump inhibitors including omeprazole and lansoprazole inhibit 
      gastric acid secretion by selectively and non-competitively inactivating the H+, 
      K+ ATPase molecules of the parietal cell, but possibly only those that are
      actively secreting acid. This might imply that stimulation of acid secretion by a
      meal is necessary for optimal inhibition of gastric secretion. AIM: To quantify
      and compare the effect on daytime gastric acidity of omeprazole 20 mg or
      lansoprazole 30 mg daily taken 15 min before breakfast, with that of the same
      drug taken without a meal. METHODS: Twenty-one healthy volunteers were randomized
      to receive either omeprazole or lansoprazole. They were given the drug for two
      separate periods of 7 days in randomized order and at least 7 days apart. During 
      one period the study medication was taken before breakfast; during the other it
      was taken at the same hour, but with no meal until 12:00 hours. Lunch was
      standardized. On day 7, intragastric pH-metry was performed, starting at 08:00
      hours. Tracings were analysed for the 8-h period from 08:00 hours until 16:00
      hours with regard to percentage time for which gastric pH was below 4.0 and 3.0, 
      and median gastric pH. Tracings were also analysed after removing the 1 h
      breakfast period, to exclude the buffering effect of the meal. RESULTS: When
      taking the drug with breakfast, the median percentage time for which gastric pH <
      4.0 was 17.2 (interquartile range 4.6-45.5), compared with 42.0 (interquartile
      range 31.4-48.8) when taken without food (P=0.01). Fifteen subjects had better
      control of gastric acidity when the medication was taken with breakfast. A pH
      threshold of 3 and median pH showed similar differences. When the breakfast
      period was removed, the differences were no longer statistically significant.
      CONCLUSIONS: When therapy with omeprazole or lansoprazole is indicated,
      medication should be taken before a meal for optimal control of daytime gastric
      acidity.

TI  - [Triple therapy of short-term with azithromycin, amoxycillin and omeprazole for
      the eradication of Helicobacter pylori].
PG  - 509-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: The high cost and complexity of therapeutic schemes for the
      eradication of Helicobacter pylori has stimulated the search of simpler and
      cheaper treatment options. AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of 3 days of
      azithromycin 500 mg od, 7 days of amoxycillin 750 mg tid and omeprazole, 20
      (Group A) or 40 mg (Group B) on randomization, as a treatment for Helicobacter
      pylori infection in patients with endoscopically diagnosed peptic ulcer. METHODS:
      H. pylori status of peptic ulcer patients was pathologically confirmed by the
      examination of five gastric biopsies using the Giemsa stain and by rapid urease
      testing in two gastric biopsies. H. pylori status was reassessed not less than 28
      days after completing treatment. Adverse events and compliance were evaluated.
      RESULTS: Fifty four patients (29 men, 25 women, mean age 48 years) were enrolled,
      28 in Group A and 27 in Group B. Per protocol the infection was cured in 58.8% of
      patients (30/51; 95% CI: 45-73%). On an intention to treat basis, H pylori
      infection was cured in 55%. Minor side effects including diarrhea and nausea were
      reported by 32% of patients. Ninety-five per cent of patients consumed more than 
      95% of prescribed medications. H. pylori was successfully eradicated in 61% of
      group A and 57% of group B patients (p = NS). CONCLUSION: Short term therapy with
      azithromycin was poorly effective in curing H. pylori infection. The compliance
      was excellent. Increasing Omeprazole from 20 to 40 mg/day did not improve
      treatment effectiveness.

PG  - 1865-70
AB  - 97 patients in 49 hospitals with erosive esophagitis unhealed after at least 8
      weeks treatment with H2-RA were given primary treatment with 30 mg lansoprazol
      once daily. After 8 weeks of treatment with lansoprazol, 75(77%) patients were
      endoscopically healed. Healed patients were then given maintenance treatment with
      either 30 mg lansoprazol once daily, 15 mg lansoprazol once daily or 20 mg
      famotidine twice daily for 24 weeks. 86% of patients randomized to 30 mg
      lansoprazol, 70% of patients randomized to 15 mg lansoprazol were maintained in
      endoscopic healing throughout 24 weeks as compared with only 12% of patients
      randomized to famotidine in endoscopic healing. After 24 weeks of lansoprazol
      treatment basal gastrin levels were moderately increased. However no significant 
      histopathologic lesion was found in the oxyntic gland mucosa. PPI(lansoprazol)
      was far superior to H2-RA(famotidine) in preventing recurrence of healed erosive 
      esophagitis. A goal achieved without adverse events and significant abnormalities
      in the oxyntic mucosal exocrine or endocrine cell but a moderate increase in
      basal gastrine levels.

TI  - Diagnosis of reflux disease.
PG  - 759-74
AB  - There are numerous tests for which a diagnostic value in the context of
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease has been claimed. Some of these tests (e.g. the
      acid perfusion test) have become obsolete after the advent of 24-hour oesophageal
      pH monitoring. With the latter test not only can excessive reflux be identified, 
      but also, and more importantly, a temporal relationship can be demonstrated
      between a patient's symptoms and reflux episodes. Radiographical examination of
      the oesophagus has largely been replaced by endoscopy, although the use of the
      former test is still indicated in certain circumstances (e.g. in the
      differentiation of sliding from para-oesophageal hiatus hernia). In clinical
      practice, the so-called proton pump inhibitor test has gained considerable
      popularity. Despite several studies on the specificity and sensitivity of this
      test, its value has not yet been established with sufficient accuracy.
      Conventional manometric evaluation of lower oesophageal sphincter pressure has
      been over-emphasized as a diagnostic test in gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.

TI  - Pathogenesis and current management of gastrooesophageal-reflux-related asthma.
PG  - 596-601
AB  - In the past decade the use of proton pump inhibitors on the one hand, and an
      aggressive surgical approach on the other hand have revolutionised the treatment 
      of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). Many studies have suggested that the
      successful management of GORD results in improvement of the symptoms of asthma
      which coexist in many of these patients. In this paper we review the pathogenesis
      and the medical and surgical treatment of GOR-related asthma. Both anti-reflux
      operations and anti-acid medications improve GORD and GOR-related asthma.
      Although anti-reflux surgery is superior to H2 blockers, there are not sufficient
      data to evaluate proton pump inhibitors compared with operation in controlling
      the symptoms of asthma.

TI  - Five-day triple therapy in Helicobacter pylori-positive duodenal ulcer: an
      eighteen-month follow-up.
PG  - 130-6
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of two different 5-day proton
      pump inhibitor (PPI)-based triple therapies for Helicobacter pylori (Hp)-positive
      duodenal ulcers (DUs). Eighty-four patients received pantoprazole (Pan) 80 mg
      O.D. (once daily) for 1 week; 88 patients received omeprazole (Ome) 40 mg O.D.
      for 1 week. Patients of both groups received clarithromycin (Cla) 500 mg B.I.D.
      (twice daily) and amoxicillin (Amo) 1 g B.I.D. for 5 days. All of them were
      clinically and endoscopically investigated before enrollment (T0) and at 1 (T1), 
      6 (T2), 12 (T3), and 18 months (T4) after the end of the therapy. Hp status was
      determined by rapid urease test and by histology. At T1, we observed ulcer
      healing in 87.5% of the patients and Hp eradication in 83.7% of the Pan group
      (per protocol [PP]). In the Ome group, ulcer healing was noticed in 95.1% and Hp 
      eradication in 95.1% (PP). We found no statistical differences between the groups
      (PP). At the end of the follow-up, we found a healing rate of 100% both in the
      Pan group and in the Ome group; an eradication rate of 98.4% and 100% was
      observed in the Pan group and in the Ome group, respectively. We found no
      statistical differences between the groups (PP). Hp eradication was associated
      with an improvement in the grade of gastritis at T1, remaining unchanged until
      T4. In conclusion, the efficacy of the Pan treatment was similar to the Ome
      treatment.

PG  - 2203-14
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the effectiveness of common interventions for the prevention
      of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) induced upper gastrointestinal (GI)
      toxicity. METHODS: Randomized controlled clinical trials (RCT) of prostaglandin
      analogs, H2-receptor antagonists (H2RA), or proton pump inhibitors (PPI) for the 
      prevention of chronic NSAID induced upper GI toxicity were identified through
      electronic databases, the Cochrane control trials register, conference
      proceedings, and by contacting content experts and companies. Outcome measures
      investigated were endoscopic ulcers, ulcer complications, symptoms, overall
      dropouts, dropouts due to symptoms, and study quality. RESULTS: Thirty-four RCT
      met the inclusion criteria. All doses of misoprostol significantly reduced the
      risk of endoscopic ulcers. Misoprostol 800 microg/day was superior to 400
      microg/day for the prevention of endoscopic gastric ulcers (RR 0.18, RR 0.38,
      respectively; p = 0.0055). A dose-response relationship was not seen with
      duodenal ulcers. Misoprostol caused diarrhea at all doses, although significantly
      more at 800 than 400 microg/day (p = 0.0012). Misoprostol was the only
      prophylactic agent documented to reduce ulcer complications. Standard doses of
      H2RA were effective at reducing the risk of endoscopic duodenal (RR 0.24, 95% CI 
      0.10-0.57) but not gastric ulcers (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.50-1.09). Both double dose
      H2RA and PPI were effective at reducing the risk of endoscopic duodenal and
      gastric ulcers (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.26-0.74 and RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.27-0.51,
      respectively, for gastric ulcer) and were better tolerated than misoprostol.
      CONCLUSION: Misoprostol, PPI, and double dose H2RA are effective in preventing
      chronic NSAID related endoscopic gastric and duodenal ulcers. Lower doses of
      misoprostol are less effective and are still associated with diarrhea. Only
      misoprostol 800 microg/day has been directly shown to reduce the risk of ulcer
      complications.

TI  - New treatment for Barrett's oesophagus.
PG  - 362-7
AB  - Barrett's esophagus is characterised by the presence of specialised intestinal
      metaplasia in the lower esophagus. Its importance is related primarily to its
      link with adenocarcinoma of the lower esophagus, often preceded by dysplastic
      changes. The incidence of this carcinoma has increased dramatically over the last
      few decades. Although modern treatments, particularly acid suppression with
      proton pump inhibitors, have been most useful in controlling the reflux symptoms 
      associated with Barrett's esophagus, they have not reduced the incidence of
      adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. The same can be said about anti-reflux surgery. 
      Surgical excision of Barrett's esophagus has been advocated when high-grade
      dysplasia is detected; this carries considerable morbidity and mortality, so
      alternative treatments are being developed. This update summarises recent
      information concerning newer treatments aimed at eradicating Barrett's esophagus.
      These vary from thermal coagulation (using electrocoagulation and heater probes) 
      to lasers, photodynamic therapy and mechanical methods. Of these, photodynamic
      therapy using a porphyrin precursor (5-amino-laevulinic acid) seems to give the
      most consistent satisfactory results with a minimum of complications. However,
      persistence of some metaplastic cells beneath the neo-squamous layer remains a
      problem. Ongoing effective acid control (by medical or surgical therapy) is also 
      essential to prevent recurrence of Barrett's esophagus. Future research is aimed 
      at perfecting these methods. Ultimately, it may be possible to understand the
      molecular biology which could help to predict which patients are at greatest risk
      of developing dysplastic and carcinomatous changes.

TI  - Intravenous eradication therapy for bleeding gastroduodenal ulcer associated with
      Helicobacter pylori infection.
PG  - 386-91
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of an ultrashort intravenous triple therapy
      against Helicobacter pylori infection in patients with bleeding peptic ulcer.
      METHODS: Thirty patients with bleeding peptic ulcer were studied prospectively.
      At endoscopy, two corpus and antrum biopsies were obtained for urease testing and
      culture. If H. pylori infection was found (positive urease test), the patient was
      treated with omeprazole 40 mg bid, metronidazole 500 mg tid and ampicillin 2000
      mg fid for three days and then with ranitidine 150 mg bid for 2 months until
      eradication. In all patients a [13C]urea breath test was done at 2-month
      intervals, and in patients with gastric ulcer an endoscopy was also done and
      biopsies for culture and urease testing were obtained. RESULTS: Eradication
      efficacy (intention-to-treat) was 86.6% (26 out of 30). All schedules were
      administered in full and no patient had any adverse reactions. No patients had
      rebleeding. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrashort three-day triple therapy can achieve an
      eradication rate greater than 80%, with good acceptance and compliance, and
      without adverse events.

TI  - Esomeprazole.
PG  - 321-9; discussion 330-1
AB  - Esomeprazole, a new proton pump inhibitor, is the S-isomer of omeprazole and is
      the first such inhibitor to be developed as a single isomer. Esomeprazole
      provided better control of intragastric pH than omeprazole, lansoprazole and
      pantoprazole in trials conducted in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux
      disease (GORD) or healthy volunteers (n = 20 to 115). In 2 large randomised,
      double-blind multicentre trials esomeprazole 20 and/or 40mg for 8 weeks produced 
      higher healing rates of erosive oesophagitis and better symptom control than
      omeprazole 20 mg in patients with GORD. Esomeprazole 10, 20 or 40mg once daily
      for 6 months maintained healing versus placebo (p < 0.001) in patients with
      endoscopically confirmed healed erosive oesophagitis in 2 large randomised,
      double-blind multicentre trials. Similarly, symptom-driven on-demand use of
      esomeprazole effectively controlled symptoms of GORD (heartburn) for 6 months in 
      2 large placebo-controlled trials. Esomeprazole-based triple therapy for 7 days
      was as effective for eradication of Helicobacter pylori as longer
      omeprazole-based therapy in 2 randomised double-blind trials including about 450 
      patients each. Endoscopically confirmed ulcer healing 4 weeks after treatment
      initiation was reported in about 90% of patients with active duodenal ulcer in
      both treatment groups. Esomeprazole-based triple therapy for 10 days was more
      effective than esomeprazole plus clarithromycin for eradication of H. pylori in
      233 patients.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori test-and-eradicate versus prompt endoscopy for management of 
      dyspeptic patients: a randomised trial.
PG  - 455-60
AB  - BACKGROUND: Strategies based on screening for Helicobacter pylori to manage
      dyspeptic patients in primary care have been proposed, but the clinical
      consequences are unclear. We did a randomised trial to assess the efficacy and
      safety of a test-and-eradicate strategy compared with prompt endoscopy in the
      management of patients with dyspepsia. METHODS: 500 patients presenting in
      primary care with dyspepsia (> or = 2 weeks of epigastric pain, no alarm
      symptoms) were assigned H. pylori testing plus eradication therapy or endoscopy. 
      Symptoms, quality of life, patients' satisfaction, and use of resources were
      recorded during 1 year of follow-up. FINDINGS: 250 patients were assigned
      test-and-eradicate, and 250 prompt endoscopy. The median age was 45 years and 28%
      were H. pylori infected. 1 year follow-up was completed by 447 patients. We found
      no differences in symptoms between the two groups (median registered days without
      dyspeptic symptoms=0.63 [IQR 0.27-0.81] in the test-and-eradicate group vs 0.67
      [0.36-0.86] in the prompt endoscopy group; mean difference 0.04 [95% CI
      -0.01-0.10], p=0.12). Nor did we find any difference in quality of life or
      numbers of sick-leave days, visits to general practitioners, or hospital
      admissions. In the test-and-eradicate group, 27 (12%) of the patients were
      dissatisfied with management, compared with eight (4%) in the endoscopy group
      (p=0.013). After 1 year, the use of endoscopies in the test-and-eradicate group
      was 0.40 times (95% CI 0.31-0.51) the use in the endoscopy group, the use of H.
      pylori tests increased by a factor of 8.1 (5.7-13.1), the use of eradication
      treatments increased by a factor of 1.5 (0.9-2.7), and the use of proton-pump
      inhibitors was 0.89 (0.59-1.33) times the use in the endoscopy group. 43 (91%
      [80-98%]) of 47 peptic-ulcer patients would have been identified by endoscopy or 
      treated by eradication therapy. INTERPRETATION: A H. pylori test-and-eradicate
      strategy is as efficient and safe as prompt endoscopy for management of dyspeptic
      patients in primary care, although fewer patients are satisfied with their
      treatment.

      tetracycline in the eradication of Helicobacter pylori: a randomized, placebo
      controlled, double-blind study.
PG  - 599-602
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the rate of Helicobacter pylori eradication following
      bismuth-based triple therapy with colloidal bismuth subcitrate, tetracycline
      hydrochloride and metronidazole. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and eleven
      patients were randomly assigned, in a two to one ratio, to colloidal bismuth
      subcitrate 120 mg qid plus metronidazole 250 mg qid plus tetracycline 500 mg qid 
      (Gastrostat), or matching placebo tablets and capsules for 14 days. Presence or
      absence of H pylori was documented by histology at entry and at least 28 days
      after treatment. Patients had dyspeptic symptoms with or without a history of
      peptic ulcer. Patients with any previous attempt(s) at eradication of H pylori,
      who used bismuth, antibiotics, H2 receptor antagonists or proton pump inhibitors 
      in the previous four weeks were excluded. RESULTS: Fifty-three of 59 (90%)
      patients on bismuth-based treatment and only one of 35 (3%) on placebo achieved
      eradication by per protocol analysis. Fifty-three of 65 (82%) patients on
      bismuth-based treatment achieved eradication, while only two of 34 (5%) achieved 
      eradication on placebo by intention to treat analysis. Eradication rates for
      bismuth-based treatment across sites ranged from 83% to 100%. Only two patients
      in the bismuth-based treatment group (4%) and one in the placebo group (3%)
      discontinued treatment because of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Colloidal bismuth 
      subcitrate plus metronidazole plus tetracycline, given in the doses studied for
      14 days, is safe and highly effective against H pylori infection and would be
      appropriate as a first-line therapy for eradication.

TI  - Antibiotic-resistant H. pylori infection and its treatment.
PG  - 1537-44
AB  - Helicobacter pylori infection causes progressive damage to gastric mucosa and
      results in serious disease such as peptic ulcer disease, MALT lymphoma, or
      gastric adenocarcinoma in 20% to 30% of patients. The current approach is to make
      a firm diagnosis, give combination antibiotic and antisecretory therapy, and
      confirm that the infection has been cured 4 to 6 weeks later. Antimicrobial
      resistance is largely responsible for treatment failures. Resistance to
      metronidazole can frequently be overcome by increasing the dose and duration of
      treatment with acid suppression. Clarithromycin is the most effective antibiotic 
      against H. pylori but, unfortunately, resistance to it is increasing and can not 
      be overcome by increasing the dose or duration of therapy with clarithromycin.
      The choice of therapy should be based on local susceptibility patterns.
      Re-treatment regimens for treatment failure should exclude antibiotics where
      acquired resistance is expected (i.e., clarithromycin and possibly
      metronidazole). Where available, treatment failure should prompt endoscopy and
      culture and susceptibility testing. Overall, higher doses and longer durations of
      treatment result in the best cure rates. When multiple treatment regimens fail,
      salvage therapy regimens such as bismuth or furazolidone quadruple therapy (a
      bismuth and tetracycline HCl 4 times a day along with a proton pump inhibitor
      twice a day, and either metronidazole 400 or 500 mg three times daily or
      furazolidone 100 mg three times daily for 14 days) can be used. Newer agents are 
      needed to cope with the increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance among H.
      pylori.

TI  - Strategy for treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in adults. I. Updated
      indications for test and eradication therapy suggested in 2000.
PG  - 1503-14
AB  - Since the report of culture of Helicobacter pylori in 1983, there has been
      increasing agreement that H. pylori infection is etiologically associated with a 
      number of important diseases including chronic active gastritis, peptic ulcer
      disease, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, gastric polyps,
      gastric cancer, as well as suggestions that it may be involved in diseases
      outside the upper gastrointestinal tract. There have been a number of national
      and international consensus meetings to propose guidelines to treat H. pylori
      infection. The recommendations of these conferences are reviewed here and updated
      to include new indications and concepts regarding H. pylori eradication therapy. 
      Eradication therapy is considered the standard of care for active or inactive
      peptic ulcer patients including those who use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs (NSAIDs). Other strong indications include MALT lymphoma, hyperplastic
      polyps, hyperplastic gastropathy, post-endoscopic resection for gastric
      malignancy, and acute H. pylori gastritis. Other considerations include plan to
      use chronic NSAID therapy, plan for chronic anti-secretory therapy, and some
      extra-gastroduodenal diseases such as chronic ureterica. Non-investigated
      dyspepsia is an indication for diagnostic evaluation and eradication therapy for 
      those with H. pylori infection, whereas non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD) in which peptic
      ulcer disease has been excluded is not an indication for evaluation per se.
      Intervention studies are now in progress to test the hypothesis that prevention
      of gastric malignancy is an outcome of H. pylori eradication. Because the
      prevalence of H. pylori infection and the associated diseases such as peptic
      ulcer or gastric cancer differ among countries as well as different approvals for
      treatment are required by governments or insurance agencies, the acceptable
      indications of eradication therapy will, by necessity, vary among countries.

TI  - Eradication of Helicobacter pylori with pantoprazole and two antibiotics: a
      comparison of two short-term regimens.
PG  - 1151-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: High rates of Helicobacter pylori eradication can be achieved by
      combining proton pump inhibitors with two antibiotics. However, in the search for
      an optimal therapy a direct comparison of different regimens is necessary.
      METHODS: For this open study, 331 patients with duodenal ulcer were screened and 
      randomly allocated to either pantoprazole 40 mg b.d., clarithromycin 500 mg b.d.,
      and metronidazole 500 mg b.d. (PCM) or pantoprazole 40 mg b.d., amoxycillin 1000 
      mg b.d., and clarithromycin 500 mg b.d. (PAC) for 7 days. Both combinations were 
      followed by a 7-day therapy with pantoprazole 40 mg o.d. alone. Eradication of H.
      pylori was assessed by use of a 13C-urea breath test 4 weeks after the intake of 
      the last medication. RESULTS: Eradication rates were 90% in intention-to-treat
      patients from the PCM (132 out of 147; 95% CI: 84-94%) and the PAC group (135 out
      of 150; 95% CI: 84-94%). H. pylori was eradicated in 112 out of 117 per protocol 
      patients of the PCM group (96%; 95% CI: 90-99%) and in 119 out of 126 patients of
      the PAC group (94%; 95% CI: 89-98%). Rapid relief from ulcer pain and a decrease 
      in the mean intensity of other gastrointestinal symptoms was observed. Sixty-nine
      patients reported adverse events, none of which were related to the intake of
      pantoprazole. Four serious adverse events, none related to the trial medication, 
      were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Both pantoprazole-based short-term triple therapies
      are highly effective and well-tolerated treatment regimens in the eradication of 
      H. pylori.

TI  - Acid suppression in peptic ulcer haemorrhage: a 'meta-analysis'.
PG  - 1119-26
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of acid-decreasing agents in the management of peptic ulcer
      haemorrhage continues to be controversial. Most clinical trials examining the
      efficacy of these drugs contain small numbers of patients, making it difficult to
      draw conclusions about their efficacy. METHODS: We report a meta-analysis that
      examined the effect of these drugs in the management of peptic ulcer haemorrhage.
      Included studies were located using a search of the Medline database between 1980
      and 1999. Studies were published in English, randomized and controlled by a
      placebo group. Mantel-Haenszel and blinded random models were used in conducting 
      the statistical processing of this meta-analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-one randomized 
      placebo-controlled trials were included. The total number of patients was 3566
      and the mean study size was 170 (range 20-1005). Seventeen of the papers assessed
      the efficacy of H2-antagonists, three assessed proton pump inhibitors and one was
      concerned with antacid therapy. The meta-analysis showed a significant reduction 
      in re-bleeding rates (odds ratio, OR 0.727, 0.618-0.855, P < 0.001) and surgery
      rates (OR 0.707, 0.582-0.859, P < 0.001) when acid decreasing agents are used for
      acute peptic ulcer haemorrhage. Mortality rates appear to be unaffected (OR
      1.140, 0.818-1.588, P=0. 49). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis demonstrates a
      significant beneficial effect of acid-decreasing agents in lowering re-bleeding
      and surgery rates, but demonstrated no effect upon mortality.

TI  - Management of Helicobacter pylori infection--a Working Party Report of the
      Malaysian Society of Gastroenterology and Hepatology.
PG  - 302-10
AB  - The Working Party Report on the Management of Helicobacter pylori serves as a
      clinical practice guideline for Malaysian doctors. H. pylori is not uncommon in
      the Malaysian population. Marked racial differences and the consistently low
      prevalence rates amongst Malays are noted. The working party recommends that if
      endoscopy is to be performed, a rapid urease test should be used for diagnosis.
      Where suspicion of the infection is strong and the urease test is negative,
      histology should be performed on gastric biopsies. Culture should be used to
      monitor resistance patterns to antibiotics and regional laboratories should
      assume this responsibility. The urea breath tests are highly accurate tests for
      diagnosis of H. pylori but is as yet not widely available in Malaysia. The
      working party strongly recommends that all peptic ulcer patients infected with H.
      pylori whether active, in remission and complicated ulcers should be treated for 
      the infection. Patients with low-grade gastric mucosal lymphoid tissue lymphoma
      should also be treated for H. pylori infection. It is considered advisable that
      patients on long term nonsteroidal antinflammatory drug (NSAID) treatment with a 
      history of peptic ulcers or dyspepsia and patients following resection of early
      gastric cancer or those with a family history of gastric cancer should also be
      tested and treated for H. pylori. The working party recommends, as first line
      treatment a 7-day combination therapy of a proton pump inhibitor, clarithromycin 
      and metronidazole or amoxicillin. High metronidazole resistance rates locally may
      adversely affect regimens containing the antibiotic. It should also be noted that
      regimens that yield lower eradication rates may result in higher long term
      expenditure.

TI  - Quality of life and severity of symptoms in gastro-oesophageal reflux disease: a 
      clinical review.
PG  - 516-25
AB  - My purpose is to review the quality of life (QoL) instruments used in the
      assessment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) and assess the effects of 
      GORD on quality of life. Many instruments have been used in the assessment of
      quality of life in patients with GORD, and these have varied both in quality and 
      purpose. In general, the choice of instrument depends on its purpose. Several
      investigators, using generic quality of life instruments, have shown that GORD
      significantly reduces QoL, and its effects are comparable with those of
      congestive heart failure. However, these generic instruments do not seem to be
      sensitive enough to measure the effects of treatments on GORD. For this,
      disease-specific instruments are more appropriate. Both medical and surgical
      treatment has been shown to improve QoL. The choice of instrument is entirely
      dependent on the investigator's reason for measuring QoL in GORD patients.

TI  - The proton-pump inhibitors: similarities and differences.
PG  - 266-80; discussion 265
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This paper examines the clinical pharmacology of the proton-pump
      inhibitors (PPIs) and briefly reviews some comparative studies of these agents.
      BACKGROUND: PPIs have emerged as the treatment of choice for acid-related
      diseases, including gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and peptic ulcer
      disease. Although these drugs-omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, and
      rabeprazole-share a common structure (all are substituted benzimidazoles) and
      mode of action (inhibition of H+,K+-adenosine triphosphatase [ATPase]), each
      differs somewhat in its clinical pharmacology. RESULTS: In comparative clinical
      trials found in MEDLINE, PPIs administered once daily produced endoscopic
      evidence of healing in >90% of patients with duodenal ulcer after 4 weeks of
      treatment, in >90% of those with gastric ulcer after 6 weeks of treatment, and in
      >90% of those with ulcerative or erosive GERD after 8 weeks of treatment.
      Maintenance therapy with daily doses of a PPI has been shown to be an effective
      means of preventing GERD relapse. PPIs also inhibit the growth of Helicobacter
      pylori, now recognized as an important factor in peptic ulcer disease, and, when 
      administered in combination with antibiotics, provide the best treatment for
      eradication of the bacterium. Rabeprazole has a more rapid onset of H+,K+-ATPase 
      inhibition than the other PPIs and, compared with omeprazole, a greater effect on
      intragastric pH after the first dose. Omeprazole and lansoprazole have a greater 
      potential for drug-drug interactions than do pantoprazole and rabeprazole.
      CONCLUSION: Although the individual PPIs have similar efficacy in many cases,
      differences between them should be considered when choosing a treatment regimen.

TI  - Rabeprazole for the prevention of recurrent erosive or ulcerative
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Rabeprazole Study Group.
PG  - 889-97
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of rabeprazole 10 mg and 20
      mg versus placebo for the prevention of endoscopically demonstrable relapse in
      patients previously diagnosed with erosive or ulcerative gastro-oesophageal
      reflux disease (GORD) who had no oesophageal erosions or ulcerations at study
      entry. The study also assessed the effectiveness of rabeprazole in preventing
      GORD symptom recurrence and reductions in quality of life. DESIGN/METHODS: The
      trial used a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group design and
      enrolled 288 male and female outpatients of > or =18 years of age. Patients were 
      assigned to treatment with either rabeprazole 10 mg or 20 mg once daily in the
      morning (QAM) or placebo and followed for 52 weeks. RESULTS: Both rabeprazole
      doses were significantly more effective than placebo in preventing endoscopically
      demonstrable GORD relapse (P<0.001 versus placebo). The cumulative relapse rate
      for rabeprazole 10 mg at week 52 was 23%; for rabeprazole 20 mg, 14%; and for
      placebo, 71%. Both rabeprazole doses were also significantly superior to placebo 
      in preventing relapse of heartburn frequency (P<0.001 for all comparisons between
      rabeprazole and placebo), with no significant differences between the two doses. 
      Rabeprazole was also significantly more effective than placebo in preventing
      relapse of day-and night-time heartburn severity, maintaining overall patient
      well-being, and reducing antacid use. Both rabeprazole doses were well tolerated;
      most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild or moderate. There were no
      clinically significant changes in clinical laboratory values, thyroid function
      tests, vital signs, or electrocardiograms. CONCLUSION: Once-daily treatment with 
      rabeprazole 10 mg or 20 mg is effective and well tolerated in preventing relapse 
      of erosive or ulcerative GORD and associated symptoms and maintaining quality of 
      life.

TI  - Long-term management of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease with omeprazole or open
      antireflux surgery: results of a prospective, randomized clinical trial. The
      Nordic GORD Study Group.
PG  - 879-87
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: The efficacy of antireflux surgery (ARS) and omeprazole
      treatment in the control of gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GORD) are well
      established. We have compared these two therapeutic options in a randomized,
      clinical trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three hundred and ten patients with erosive
      oesophagitis were enrolled into the trial. After a run-in period when all
      patients had < or = 40 mg of omeprazole daily to heal the oesophagitis and
      relieve symptoms, 155 patients were randomized to continuous omeprazole therapy
      and 155 to open antireflux surgery, of whom 144 later had an operation. One
      hundred and thirty-nine and 129 in the omeprazole and antireflux surgery groups, 
      respectively, completed the 3-year follow-up. Symptoms, 24-h pH monitoring and
      endoscopy were used to document the outcome. Quality of life was evaluated by the
      psychological general well-being (PGWB) index and the gastrointestinal symptom
      rating scale (GSRS). RESULTS: Analysis of time to treatment failure (defined as
      moderate to severe GORD symptoms for > or = 3 days during the last 7 days,
      oesophagitis or changed therapy) revealed a significant difference in favour of
      antireflux surgery (P = 0.0016). Seventeen patients originally submitted to
      antireflux surgery experienced symptom relapse alone, 14 had oesophagitis at
      endoscopy and another six had omeprazole for different reasons, leaving 97
      patients in clinical remission after 3 years. The corresponding figures in the
      omeprazole arm were 50 relapses, 18 with oesophagitis, two had surgery, leaving
      77 patients in remission. Allowing a dose adjustment in the case of relapse in
      those on omeprazole therapy to either 40 or 60 mg, the curves describing the
      failure rates were not significantly different from each other. Quality of life
      assessment showed a comparable outcome in the two study groups. CONCLUSION: In
      this randomized multicentre trial we found antireflux surgery to be very
      efficacious in controlling GORD, a level of control which could also be achieved 
      by omeprazole provided that advantage was taken of the opportunity of adjusting
      the dose.

TI  - [Cost-effectiveness analysis of 2 strategies of Helicobacter pylori eradication: 
      results of a prospective and randomized study in primary care].
PG  - 1-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: To analyze cost-effectiveness of two different strategies to treat H.
      pylori infection in peptic ulcer in the primary care setting. PATIENTS AND
      METHODS: Consecutive patients with endoscopic diagnosis of peptic ulcer were
      randomized to one of two strategies: a) treatment during 7 days with omeprazole, 
      tetracycline, metronidazole and bismuth subcitrate ("quadruple" therapy) and if
      failure second-line treatment with omeprazole, amoxycillin and clarithromycin
      during 7 days (OCA7), and b) initial treatment with OCA7 and if failure treatment
      with "quadruple therapy". End point was eradication 8 weeks after last treatment 
      dose. Direct and indirect costs were estimated (euros, 1997) and a
      cost-effectiveness analysis using a decision-tree model was undertaken after real
      clinical data. 95% confidence intervals are given. RESULTS: After screening 255
      patients, 97 were finally included. 48 patients were given strategy a and 49
      strategy b. Eradication was obtained (intention-to-treat) in 72.9% (CI 95%:
      58.2-84.7) in group a versus 91.8% (CI 95%: 80.4-97.7) (p < 0.05) in group b.
      Mean cost per case treated was lower in group a (237 versus 268 euros) but cost
      per case eradicated was lower in group b (320 versus 296 euros). The cost was
      primarily determined by efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with OCA7 followed by
      rescue with "quadruple" therapy if failure is more efficient in our area that the
      inverse strategy. Efficiency is mostly determined by efficacy.

TI  - Aims in the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease: a gastroenterologist's
      viewpoint.
PG  - 1-6
AB  - Relieving heartburn and healing esophagitis may appear to be primary aims in the 
      management of gastroesophageal reflux disease, but systematic consideration of
      the issues demonstrates that there are discrepancies between the fundamental aims
      of medical management and the aims selected for study in trials of drug efficacy.
      The initial aims of management are those concerned with diagnosis, patient
      assessment and the provision of explanation and advice. The therapeutic
      objectives are alleviating symptoms, preventing complications and, if possible,
      avoiding recurrence, and should ideally be judged in terms of health gain,
      including quality of life improvement. Obtaining value for money, by maximizing
      the health gain in relation to the cost of the overall medical intervention must 
      also be acknowledged as a desirable aim of management, with the proviso that
      physicians must always treat each patient as an individual and individualize
      clinical management appropriately.

TI  - Treatment of neuroendocrine GEP tumours with somatostatin analogues: a review.
PG  - 84-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: Somatostatin and its long-acting analogues are effective in symptom
      control in patients with functionally active neuroendocrine GEP tumours. Several 
      in vitro and in vivo reports suggest that they are also able to control tumour
      growth. METHODS: Critical review of published data on the effect of long-acting
      somatostatin analogues on symptom and growth control in patients with metastatic 
      neuroendocrine GEP tumours. RESULTS: With the exception of insulinoma and
      gastrinoma, octreotide acetate and other long-acting somatostatin formulations
      are currently the therapeutic principle of first choice to control
      hormone-mediated symptoms. The consequences of gastric acid hypersecretion in
      patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome are best controlled by proton pump
      inhibitors. Available data on growth control indicate that stabilization of
      tumour growth seems to be the most beneficial antiproliferative effect occurring 
      in up to 50% of patients. This effect is limited. However, it is unknown which
      tumour entity responds best to long- acting somatostatin analogues. CONCLUSION:
      Additional studies in patients with known spontaneous tumour growth and avoiding 
      a mix-up of different entities of neuroendocrine malignancies are necessary to
      identify subpopulations of neuroendocrine tumours which respond to long-acting
      somatostatin analogues in terms of longer lasting growth inhibition.

TI  - Pantoprazole versus one-week Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy for the
      prevention of acute NSAID-related gastroduodenal damage in elderly subjects.
PG  - 1077-82
AB  - AIM: To compare the efficacy of pantoprazole vs. a one-week Helicobacter pylori
      eradication therapy for the prevention of NSAID-related gastroduodenal damage.
      METHODS: Patients over 60 years old with symptoms and/or a history of ulcer who
      needed NSAID treatment were evaluated by endoscopy. H. pylori positive subjects
      who had no severe gastroduodenal lesions were randomized to take, concomitantly
      with NSAID therapy, either: (i) pantoprazole 40 mg daily plus amoxycillin 1 g
      b.d. and clarithromycin 250 mg b.d. for 1 week (35 subjects, Group PAC) or (ii)
      pantoprazole 40 mg daily for 1 month (34 subjects, Group P). Endoscopy was
      repeated after 1 month. RESULTS: A significantly higher incidence of severe
      gastroduodenal damage was found in Group PAC than in Group P (29% vs. 9%,
      P<0.05). The percentages of patients worsened, unchanged and improved after 1
      month were, respectively: Group PAC: 46%, 46%, and 9% and Group P: 7%, 65%, and
      29% (P<0.0008). The percentage of H. pylori-negative subjects was 89% in Group
      PAC and 52% in Group P (P=0.0009). The incidence of gastroduodenal damage was
      higher in Group PAC treatment failures than in cured patients (50% vs. 25.8%,
      P=ns). CONCLUSION: One month of pantoprazole was more effective than a proton
      pump inhibitor-based triple therapy in the prevention of gastroduodenal damage in
      elderly H. pylori-positive NSAID users.

TI  - Equally high efficacy of 4, 7 and 10-day triple therapies to eradicate
      Helicobacter pylori infection in patients with ulcer disease.
PG  - 1065-70
AB  - BACKGROUND: In patients with ulcer disease the optimal dose and duration of
      Helicobacter pylori treatment containing omeprazole (O), metronidazole (M) and
      clarithromycin (C) has yet to be established. The efficacy might be influenced by
      metronidazole- and clarithromycin-resistance. AIM: To study the effect of
      duration of OMC treatment on its efficacy and influence of
      metronidazole-resistance and clarithromycin-resistance on the optimal duration.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ulcer patients (n=76) were randomized to three
      double-blind treatments of 10 days: OMC 4 consisted of 4 days b.d. 20 mg
      omeprazole, 400 mg metronidazole and 250 mg clarithromycin switched over to 6
      days b.d. 20 mg omeprazole and placebo antibiotics (n=27); OMC 7 consisted of 7
      days b.d. omeprazole 20 mg, metronidazole 400 mg and clarithromycin 250 mg and 3 
      days b.d. omeprazole 20 mg and placebo antibiotics (n=25); OMC 10 consisted of 10
      days b.d. omeprazole 20 mg, metronidazole 400 mg and clarithromycin 250 mg
      (n=24). H. pylori was assessed by biopsies for culture and histology pre- and 4-6
      weeks after OMC therapy. Metronidazole-resistance and clarithromycin-resistance
      were assessed by the E-test. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat-eradication rates were: 
      OMC 4, 96%; OMC 7, 92%; and OMC 10, 96% (N.S.). All of the three per protocol
      eradication rates were 100% (95% CI: 85.2-100). Of 75 isolates, 16 were
      metronidazole-resistant and one was clarithromycin-resistant. CONCLUSION: In H.
      pylori-positive ulcer patients, OMC 4 is highly efficacious and as effective as
      OMC 7 and OMC 10. No influence of metronidazole-resistance or
      clarithromycin-resistance was observed.

TI  - The benefit/risk profile of rabeprazole, a new proton-pump inhibitor.
PG  - 799-806
AB  - Acid-related diseases such as gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) and peptic
      ulcer are a common cause of morbidity and if inadequately treated can lead to
      serious complications. The proton-pump inhibitor rabeprazole has been extensively
      evaluated in well-controlled trials in North America and Europe for the acute
      treatment of erosive or ulcerative GORD and gastric and duodenal ulcers and for
      the long-term maintenance of GORD healing. The results show that rabeprazole has 
      a favourable benefit/risk profile for each indication. Rabeprazole 10 and 20 mg
      given once daily in the morning was highly effective in producing and maintaining
      healing, providing symptom relief, and improving overall well-being. Healing
      rates for rabeprazole were equivalent to omeprazole in all indications, and
      superior (GORD healing and duodenal ulcer healing) or equivalent (gastric ulcer
      healing) to the histamine 2-receptor antagonist ranitidine. Symptom relief
      provided by rabeprazole was equivalent or superior to comparator drugs.
      Rabeprazole was well tolerated in both short- and long-term studies. The
      incidence of treatment-emergent signs and symptoms related to rabeprazole was
      low, and these were generally mild or moderate in severity. The overall rate of
      discontinuations due to adverse events was approximately 3%. There were no deaths
      related to rabeprazole therapy. These findings indicate a favourable benefit/risk
      profile for each intended use.

TI  - Effect of intravenous omeprazole on recurrent bleeding after endoscopic treatment
      of bleeding peptic ulcers.
PG  - 310-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: After endoscopic treatment of bleeding peptic ulcers, bleeding recurs
      in 15 to 20 percent of patients. METHODS: We assessed whether the use of a high
      dose of a proton-pump inhibitor would reduce the frequency of recurrent bleeding 
      after endoscopic treatment of bleeding peptic ulcers. Patients with actively
      bleeding ulcers or ulcers with nonbleeding visible vessels were treated with an
      epinephrine injection followed by thermocoagulation. After hemostasis had been
      achieved, they were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to receive
      omeprazole (given as a bolus intravenous injection of 80 mg followed by an
      infusion of 8 mg per hour for 72 hours) or placebo. After the infusion, all
      patients were given 20 mg of omeprazole orally per day for eight weeks. The
      primary end point was recurrent bleeding within 30 days after endoscopy. RESULTS:
      We enrolled 240 patients, 120 in each group. Bleeding recurred within 30 days in 
      8 patients (6.7 percent) in the omeprazole group, as compared with 27 (22.5
      percent) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 3.9; 95 percent confidence interval,
      1.7 to 9.0). Most episodes of recurrent bleeding occurred during the first three 
      days, which made up the infusion period (5 in the omeprazole group and 24 in the 
      placebo group, P<0.001). Three patients in the omeprazole group and nine in the
      placebo group underwent surgery (P=0.14). Five patients (4.2 percent) in the
      omeprazole group and 12 (10 percent) in the placebo group died within 30 days
      after endoscopy (P=0.13). CONCLUSIONS: After endoscopic treatment of bleeding
      peptic ulcers, a high-dose infusion of omeprazole substantially reduces the risk 
      of recurrent bleeding.

TI  - Distribution of atrophy in Helicobacter pylori-infected subjects taking proton
      pump inhibitors.
PG  - 578-82
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gastric atrophy is associated with Helicobacter pylori infection.
      Conflicting results have been obtained as to whether acid suppressant therapy
      hastens the development or changes the distribution of atrophy in the stomach.
      The aim of this study was to investigate whether concomitant proton pump
      inhibitor (PPI) therapy in H. pylori-infected individuals resulted in an increase
      or an alteration in atrophy distribution and whether this was reflected by the
      plasma gastrin. METHODS: Multiple gastric biopsy specimens were taken from the
      antrum and corpus from 46 H. pylori-infected subjects, 18 of whom were taking
      PPIs, and assessed histologically by the updated Sydney System. The control group
      was age- and sex-matched to the index group. Fasting gastrin levels were
      measured. RESULTS: In the control group there was no significant tendency for
      either antral or corpus atrophy to predominate (P = 0.44). In the treatment group
      there was a significant tendency for corpus as opposed to antral atrophy to
      develop (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the overall atrophy
      score between the treated and untreated groups (P = 0.76). Fasting gastrin levels
      were significantly higher in the treated group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS:
      Treatment with PPIs in H. pylori-infected subjects does not lead to an overall
      increase in gastric atrophy. It does, however, result in an increased prevalence 
      of corpus as opposed to antral atrophy. This is associated with a significantly
      higher gastrin level.

TI  - Effectiveness and costs of omeprazole vs ranitidine for treatment of symptomatic 
      gastroesophageal reflux disease in primary care clinics in West Virginia.
PG  - 624-30
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare clinical, health-related quality of life (HRQL), and
      medical cost outcomes in patients with symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux
      disease (GERD) receiving omeprazole sodium or ranitidine hydrochloride treatment.
      METHODS: A multicenter, randomized, open-label, medical effectiveness trial
      conducted in 5 university-based family medicine clinics. Two hundred sixty-eight 
      patients with GERD were recruited and randomly assigned to omeprazole sodium, 20 
      mg once daily, or ranitidine hydrochloride, 150 mg twice daily, for up to 6
      months. Main outcome assessments included the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating
      Scale (GSRS) Reflux score, Psychological General Well-Being Index, and
      Short-Form-36 Health Survey administered at baseline and 2, 4, 12, and 24 weeks. 
      Medical resource use and cost data were collected. RESULTS: More
      omeprazole-treated patients reported improved heartburn resolution at 2 weeks
      (49.0% vs 33.3%; P=.007) and 4 weeks (58.6% vs 35.0%; P<.001) compared with
      ranitidine-treated patients. The GSRS Reflux scores across 3 months showed
      overall differences between omeprazole (mean, 2.67) and ranitidine (mean, 2.95)
      groups (P=.04). Mean total 6-month medical costs were $915 lower ($8371 vs $9286;
      P=.64), and no difference in mean outpatient medical costs ($1198 vs $1158;
      P=.76) were observed in the omeprazole group compared with the ranitidine group. 
      A post hoc secondary analysis showed that, at 12 and 24 weeks, patients treated
      with omeprazole for 8 weeks or more reported greater heartburn resolution (ie, 24
      [43%] of 56 patients at both intervals) than patients treated with ranitidine for
      8 weeks or more (12 [24%] and 13 [26%] of 50 patients, respectively; P=.001).
      CONCLUSIONS: Ranitidine and omeprazole were both effective at improving heartburn
      symptoms; however, omeprazole provided greater resolution of heartburn symptoms
      at 2 and 4 weeks. Despite omeprazole's higher acquisition cost, there were no
      significant differences in total or outpatient costs between groups.

TI  - Effect of population screening and treatment for Helicobacter pylori on dyspepsia
      and quality of life in the community: a randomised controlled trial. Leeds HELP
      Study Group.
PG  - 1665-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infection with Helicobacter pylori is the main cause of peptic-ulcer 
      disease. Treatment of this infection might lower the prevalence of dyspepsia in
      the community and improve quality of life. We investigated this possibility in a 
      double-blind randomised controlled trial. METHODS: Individuals aged 40-49 years
      were randomly selected from the lists of 36 primary-care centres. A researcher
      interviewed participants with a validated dyspepsia questionnaire and the
      psychological general wellbeing index (PGWB). H. pylori status was assessed by
      the carbon-13-labelled urea breath test. Infected participants were randomly
      assigned active treatment (omeprazole 20 mg, clarithromycin 250 mg, and
      tinidazole 500 mg, each twice daily for 7 days) or identical placebo.
      Participants were followed up at 6 months and 2 years. FINDINGS: Of 32,929
      individuals invited, 8455 attended and were eligible; 2324 were positive for H.
      pylori and were assigned active treatment (1161) or placebo (1163). 1773 (76%)
      returned at 2 years. Dyspepsia or symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux were
      reported in 247 (28%) of 880 in the treatment group and 291 (33%) of 871 in the
      placebo group (absolute-risk reduction 5% [95% CI 1-10]). H. pylori treatment had
      no significant effect on quality of life (mean difference in PGWB score between
      groups 0.86 [-0.33 to 2.05]). INTERPRETATION: Community screening and treatment
      for H. pylori produced only a 5% reduction in dyspepsia. This small benefit had
      no impact on quality of life.

TI  - Esomeprazole provides improved acid control vs. omeprazole In patients with
      symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 861-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Esomeprazole (Nexium) is a new proton pump inhibitor for the
      treatment of acid-related diseases. METHODS: In this double-blind crossover
      study, 38 patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms were
      randomized to esomeprazole 40 and 20 mg and omeprazole 20 mg once daily for 5
      days. On day 5 of each dosing period, 24-h intragastric pH and pharmacokinetic
      variables were measured. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients aged 29-58 (mean 45) years 
      completed the study. Esomeprazole 40 and 20 mg maintained intragastric pH > 4 for
      (mean) 16.8 and 12.7 h, respectively, vs. 10.5 h for omeprazole 20 mg (P < 0.001 
      and P < 0. 01). Twenty-four-hour median intragastric pH was significantly higher 
      with esomeprazole 40 mg (4.9) and 20 mg (4.1) than with omeprazole 20 mg (3.6) (P
      < 0.001 and P < 0.01). Area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was
      80% higher for esomeprazole 20 mg vs. omeprazole, while that for esomeprazole 40 
      mg was more than five times higher (each P < 0.0001). Interpatient variability in
      intragastric pH and AUC was less with esomeprazole than with omeprazole.
      Esomeprazole was well tolerated and there were no safety concerns. CONCLUSIONS:
      Esomeprazole provides more effective acid control than omeprazole, with reduced
      interpatient variability, thereby offering the potential for improved efficacy in
      acid-related diseases.

TI  - Noninvasive tests as a substitute for histology in the diagnosis of Helicobacter 
      pylori infection.
PG  - 20-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rapid urease tests for Helicobacter pylori have a sensitivity of 80% 
      to 90%. Therefore histologic examination of gastric biopsies is recommended as a 
      "backup" diagnostic test in rapid urease test-negative patients. However,
      noninvasive tests (urea breath test, serology, whole blood antibody tests) may
      provide a more rapid diagnosis and be less expensive but offer similar accuracy. 
      METHODS: Sixty-seven patients (no prior treatment for H pylori, no proton pump
      inhibitors, antibiotics, or bismuth within 4 weeks) undergoing endoscopy for
      evaluation of dyspepsia symptoms and testing rapid urease test-negative by antral
      biopsy were enrolled. All had the following tests: gastric biopsies (2 antral, 1 
      fundus; H&E and Alcian Yellow stain) examined for gastritis and H pylori;
      (13)C-UBT; capillary blood for whole blood rapid antibody tests: FlexSure HP,
      QuickVue, AccuStat, and Stat-Simple Pylori; serum for FlexSure HP; HM-CAP
      enzyme-linked immunoassay. H pylori infection was diagnosed (reference standard) 
      if chronic gastritis was present on histology and at least 2 of the 3 following
      tests were positive: urea breath test, H pylori organisms unequivocally
      demonstrated in biopsies on special stain, and/or enzyme-linked immunoassay. The 
      test and treatment costs per patient were calculated. RESULTS: Of 67 patients
      with a negative rapid urease test, 4 were positive for H pylori. None had active 
      peptic ulcer disease. Histology only identified 1 patient with organisms visible 
      on special stain. Using chronic active gastritis (neutrophilic and mononuclear
      infiltrate) as a diagnostic criterion for H pylori, 6 patients would have been
      judged positive. However, only 2 of these were truly positive by the reference
      standard (positive predictive value 33%). Negative predictive value for presence 
      of organisms and chronic active gastritis was 95% and 97%, respectively. All of
      the noninvasive tests identified all 4 truly positive patients correctly. Urea
      breath test and FlexSure whole blood assay yielded a substantial number of
      false-positive results (positive predictive value 31% and 36%, respectively);
      positive predictive value for the other tests ranged from 50% to 80%. All tests
      except histology had a negative predictive value of 100%. Histology was the most 
      costly test (p < 0. 001 compared with all other tests), followed by urea breath
      test and HM-CAP serology (p < 0.001 compared with all rapid antibody tests).
      CONCLUSIONS: Whole blood or serum antibody testing is a rapid, accurate, and
      cost-effective means for establishing H pylori status in rapid urease
      test-negative patients. Whole blood or serology rapid antibody testing should
      substitute for histology when the patient has not been previously treated for H
      pylori.

TI  - Value of quantitative serology for confirmation of Helicobacter pylori
      eradication: an 18-month follow-up study.
PG  - 976-80
AB  - In this study several therapies were administered to 124 H. pylori-positive
      patients and IgG antibody titers were measured by ELISA at months 0, 2, 3, 6, 12,
      and 18 months. Serum titers of IgG antibody progressively decreased after H.
      pylori eradication; at 3 months, the area under the receiver operating
      characteristic curve for the decrease of IgG antibody titers for confirming H.
      pylori eradication was 0.99, with 100% sensitivity and 99% specificity (when the 
      cutoff point was set at 3 U/mL). We conclude that a decrease in serum titers of
      IgG antibody to H. pylori relatively early after completion of therapy (1 month
      after ranitidine or bismuth therapy is completed and 2.5 months after antibiotic 
      therapy is completed) can be used as a noninvasive, simple, and inexpensive
      method to confirm H. pylori eradication.

TI  - Parietal cell protrusions and fundic gland cysts during omeprazole maintenance
      treatment.
PG  - 684-90
AB  - Parietal cell protrusion (PCP), swelling and bulging of parietal cells, has been 
      observed in the oxyntic mucosa of patients receiving omeprazole. The frequency of
      this event and the underlying mechanisms remain to be clarified. As such, it is
      unknown whether there is a relation with either serum gastrin or Helicobacter
      pylori infection, and whether PCP predisposes to the development of fundic gland 
      cysts (FGC). We therefore investigated the development of PCP and FGC in
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) patients treated with omeprazole and
      correlated findings to duration of therapy, gastrin, and H pylori infection. In a
      randomized, double-blinded study, GERD patients were evaluated by endoscopy with 
      biopsy sampling for histology and culture at baseline, and after 3 and 12 months'
      therapy with omeprazole 40 mg daily. H pylori-positive patients were randomized
      to additional eradication therapy or placebo antibiotics at baseline. All
      histological slides were scored blinded for time and outcome of culture for the
      presence of PCP and FGC. Fasting serum samples from all visits were used for
      gastrin measurements. The prevalence of PCP increased during omeprazole therapy
      from 18% at baseline to 79% and 86% at 3 and 12 months (P < .001, baseline v both
      3 and 12 months). The prevalence of FGC increased from 8% to 17% and 35% (P <
      .05, baseline v 12 months). The prevalence of PCP and FGC did not differ among
      the H pylori-positive and H pylori-negative patients at baseline (PCP 16% v 20%
      and FGC 7% v 8%, respectively). Whereas H pylori eradication did not
      significantly affect development of PCP (P = .7), FGC developed significantly
      more often in the H pylori-eradicated patients when compared with persistent H
      pylori-positive patients (P < .05). PCP development was related to serum gastrin 
      rise during therapy. In conclusion, PCP occurs in most patients within the first 
      months of omeprazole treatment and is related to increased gastrin levels. FGC
      develops more gradually and is enhanced by H pylori eradication.

TI  - Efficacy of omeprazole for the treatment of symptomatic acid reflux disease
      without esophagitis.
PG  - 1810-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Up to three quarters of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease
      (GERD) have symptoms, such as heartburn, but no macroscopic evidence of erosive
      esophagitis, making symptomatic GERD a common clinical problem in the primary
      care setting. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of omeprazole, 20 mg 
      once daily; omeprazole, 10 mg once daily; and placebo in the treatment of
      symptomatic GERD without erosive esophagitis. METHODS: Patients with a history of
      heartburn (> or =12 months) and episodes of moderate to severe heartburn on 4 or 
      more of the 7 days before endoscopy were eligible to participate in this 4-week, 
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The absence of erosive
      esophagitis was established through endoscopy. Eligible patients were randomized 
      to 1 of 3 treatment groups: omeprazole, 20 mg once daily; omeprazole, 10 mg once 
      daily; or placebo. Patients were assessed at weeks 2 and 4. The efficacy of
      omeprazole for the treatment of heartburn was determined mainly through the
      following diary card data: daily resolution of heartburn and complete resolution 
      of heartburn every day during 1 week of treatment. The efficacy of omeprazole for
      the treatment of acid regurgitation, dysphagia, epigastric pain, and nausea was
      also assessed. RESULTS: Of 359 randomized patients, 355 were included in the
      statistical analysis (intention-to-treat population). Daily proportions of
      patients with no heartburn were consistently greater in the 20-mg omeprazole
      group (62%, day 7; 74%, day 27) than in the 10-mg omeprazole group (41%, day 7;
      49%, day 27) or the placebo group (14%, day 7; 23%; day 27). Complete resolution 
      of heartburn every day during the last treatment week was significantly (P< or
      =.002) higher in the 20-mg omeprazole group (48%) than in the 10-mg omeprazole
      (27%) or placebo (5%) group. Omeprazole was significantly (P< or =.003) more
      effective than placebo for the treatment of acid regurgitation, dysphagia,
      epigastric pain, and nausea. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with symptomatic GERD require 
      profound acid suppression to achieve symptomatic relief. Omeprazole, 20 mg once
      daily, was superior to omeprazole, 10 mg once daily, and to placebo in providing 
      early and sustained resolution of heartburn, as well as treatment of other
      troublesome GERD symptoms.

TI  - Lansoprazole compared with ranitidine for the treatment of nonerosive
      gastroesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 1803-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Traditionally, proton pump inhibitors are used primarily for patients
      with esophagitis. However, patients with nonerosive reflux disease may also
      benefit from these powerful medications. OBJECTIVE: To compare the safety and
      symptom relief efficacy of lansoprazole with ranitidine therapy and with placebo.
      METHODS: In 2 randomized, double-blind, multicenter trials of 901 patients with
      symptomatic reflux disease, which was confirmed by endoscopy to be nonerosive,
      received lansoprazole, 15 or 30 mg once daily; ranitidine, 150 mg twice daily; or
      placebo for 8 weeks. RESULTS: Analysis of daily diary data during the first 4
      weeks and for the entire 8 weeks of treatment revealed that patients who were
      treated with either dosage of lansoprazole reported significantly (P<.05) lower
      percentages of days and nights with heartburn, less pain severity of both day and
      night heartburn, fewer days of antacid use, and smaller amounts of antacid use
      compared with patients who were treated with ranitidine or placebo. The incidence
      of possible or probable treatment-related adverse reactions was comparable among 
      the treatment groups; abdominal pain and diarrhea were the most commonly reported
      adverse events. No statistically significant differences were noted between
      treatment groups in laboratory analyses. CONCLUSION: Lansoprazole therapy is more
      effective than standard dosages of ranitidine or placebo in relieving symptoms in
      patients with endoscopically confirmed non-erosive reflux esophagitis.

TI  - Simple closure or vagotomy and pyloroplasty for the treatment of a perforated
      duodenal ulcer: comparison of results.
PG  - 225-8
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Treatment of the perforated duodenal ulcer continues to be a
      controversial subject. The purpose of our study was to compare the results of
      simple closure of perforated duodenal ulcer versus treatment by truncal vagotomy 
      and pyloroplasty. METHODS: We present a prospective and randomized study of 207
      patients who underwent surgical treatment due to perforated duodenal ulcer. In
      117 patients the surgical treatment was simple closure and postsurgery medical
      treatment with proton pump inhibitors for 1 month, and in 90 patients vagotomy
      and pyloroplasty with no additional medical treatment. RESULTS: We applied the
      Visick scale in order to compare postsurgery results. The postoperative morbidity
      and mortality rates were the same with both techniques. Statistically, in both
      cases, no significant differences were found in postsurgery symptomatology. The
      different rates of recurrent ulcers and the reinterventions due to recurrent
      ulcers presented no significant statistical values. CONCLUSION: We conclude that 
      simple closure remains the selected treatment in the majority of patients who
      present with a perforated duodenal ulcer. The operation is a simple and safe
      procedure.

TI  - Role of urokinase and its receptor in basal and stimulated colonic epithelial
      cell migration in vitro.
PG  - 105-11
AB  - BACKGROUND: Migration of colonic epithelial cells is important for mucosal repair
      following injury. The urokinase (u-PA) system regulates migration in other cell
      types. AIM: To examine the role of u-PA and its receptor (u-PAR) in colonic
      epithelial cell migration. METHODS: Migration was assessed over 24 hours in
      circular wounds made in confluent monolayers of LIM1215 and Caco-2 human colon
      cancer cells. The function of u-PA and u-PAR was ablated with antisense
      oligonucleotides to block expression, with synthetic u-PA peptides to block
      interaction, and with aprotinin to block u-PA mediated proteolysis. RESULTS:
      Migration was stimulated two to threefold by exogenous u-PA, an effect dependent 
      on u-PAR binding but independent of u-PA mediated mitogenesis and proteolysis.
      Expression of u-PA and u-PAR was inhibited by 80% by the appropriate antisense
      oligonucleotide. Basal migration and the motogenic effects of butyrate, epidermal
      growth factor, and phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate were suppressed by the u-PAR
      antisense oligonucleotide (40-60%) but were at best minimally affected following 
      inhibition of u-PA expression and binding. CONCLUSIONS: In an in vitro model of
      wounded colonic epithelium, u-PAR promotes cell migration through mechanisms that
      are not exclusively dependent on u-PA binding. Therefore, u-PA and u-PAR may
      contribute to colonic mucosal repair in vivo.

TI  - Differential expression of matrix metalloproteinases and their tissue inhibitors 
      in colon mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 63-73
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Alterations in synthesis and breakdown of extracellular matrix
      components are known to play a crucial role in tissue remodelling during
      inflammation and wound healing. Degradation of collagens is highly regulated by a
      cascade of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The current study was therefore
      designed to determine gene expression patterns of MMPs and their tissue
      inhibitors (TIMPs) in single endoscopic biopsies of patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD). PATIENTS/METHODS: mRNA expression was measured by
      quantitative competitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in biopsies from
      patients with ulcerative colitis (n=21) and Crohn's disease (n=21). Protein
      expression was analysed by western blotting and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS:
      MMP-2, MMP-14, and TIMP-1 mRNAs were marginally increased in inflamed, but
      9-12-fold increased in ulcerated colonic mucosa in IBD whereas TIMP-2 mRNA
      expression remained unchanged. MMP-1 and MMP-3 mRNA expression correlated well
      with the histological degree of acute inflammation, resulting in more than
      15-fold increased MMP-1 and MMP-3 mRNA levels in inflamed versus normal colon
      samples from patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. CONCLUSION:
      Profound overexpression of MMP-1 and MMP-3 mRNA transcripts suggests an important
      role for these enzymes in the process of tissue remodelling and destruction in
      inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Randomized trial of omeprazole and metronidazole with amoxycillin or
      clarithromycin for Helicobacter pylori eradication, in a region of high primary
      metronidazole resistance: the HERO study.
PG  - 751-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of omeprazole-based eradication therapies has been
      determined mostly in populations with low to moderate prevalence of metronidazole
      resistant Helicobacter pylori, yet resistance is high in many regions. AIM AND
      METHODS: The H. pylori eradication and duodenal ulcer healing rates after 1 week 
      of either omeprazole 40 mg mane, amoxycillin 500 mg t.d.s. and metronidazole 400 
      mg t.d.s. (OAM) or omeprazole 20 mg b.d., metronidazole 400 mg b. d. and
      clarithromycin 250 mg b.d. (OMC) were compared in a randomized trial in Australia
      and New Zealand. Patients had a further 1 week of omeprazole 20 mg. Outcome was
      assessed at 6 weeks with stringent criteria (endoscopy, biopsies and 13C-urea
      breath test). RESULTS: Of 220 subjects randomized, the H. pylori eradication
      rates (all patients treated/per protocol) were 82%/85% for OMC and 58%/63% for
      OAM (P= 0.001). Pre-treatment metronidazole resistance was present in 56% and
      clarithromycin resistance in 6%. The eradication rate for primary metronidazole
      resistance isolates treated with OMC was 80% (CI: 65-90%) compared with 45% (CI: 
      29-62%) for OAM, whereas for sensitive organisms, the eradication rates were 94% 
      (CI: 79-99%) and 79% (CI: 62-91%), respectively. Duodenal ulcer healing was 96%
      for OMC and 87% for OAM. Compliance was excellent and both treatments were
      well-tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: OMC is a well-tolerated, effective therapy for H.
      pylori eradication and duodenal ulcer healing in this region despite the high
      metronidazole resistance rate. OAM is less effective, largely due to the impact
      of metronidazole resistance.

TI  - Randomized study comparing omeprazole with ranitidine as anti-secretory agents
      combined in quadruple second-line Helicobacter pylori eradication regimens.
PG  - 737-44
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few data are available on the efficacy of second-line H. pylori
      eradication regimens. AIM: To compare the efficacy of either omeprazole or
      ranitidine in a second-line quadruple regimen in patients with duodenal ulcer or 
      erosive duodenitis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 37 patients with erosive
      duodenitis and 119 with duodenal ulcer who have failed eradication of H. pylori
      with double or triple regimens, without metronidazole, were randomly assigned to 
      receive tripotassium dicitrato bismuthate 600 mg t.d.s. + metronidazole 500 mg
      t.d.s. + tetracycline hydrochloride 500 mg t.d. s. combined with either
      omeprazole 20 mg b.d. (group O, 78 patients) or ranitidine 300 mg b.d. (group R, 
      78 patients) for 14 days. H. pylori eradication was verified by histology, rapid 
      urease test and 13C-urea breath test. STATISTICS: t-test, chi2-test. RESULTS: A
      total of 143 patients had a post-treatment endoscopy. Eradication rates were:
      intention-to-treat: group O 77% (67-87), group R 76% (66-85), P=0.85; per
      protocol analysis: group O 86% (77-95), group R 82 (71-93), P=0.58. Side-effects 
      were frequent but mild. CONCLUSIONS: Omeprazole 20 mg b.d. and ranitidine 300 mg 
      b.d. were equally effective as antisecretory agents combined in a second-line
      quadruple eradication regimen.

TI  - A new highly effective short-term therapy schedule for Helicobacter pylori
      eradication.
PG  - 715-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although triple therapy regimens suggested in the Current European
      guidelines give fairly good results, several studies have reported an
      unsatisfactory Helicobacter pylori eradication rate (< 80%). AIM: To evaluate the
      efficacy of a new short-term treatment sequence on H. pylori eradication.
      METHODS: A total of 52 patients with H. pylori infection and either non-ulcer
      dyspepsia (34 patients) or peptic ulcer (18 patients) were enrolled to receive a 
      10-day therapy: omeprazole 20 mg b.d. plus amoxycillin 1 g b.d. for the first 5
      days, followed by omeprazole 20 mg b.d., clarithromycin 500 mg b.d. and
      tinidazole 500 mg b.d. for the remaining 5 days. H. pylori infection at entry was
      assessed by rapid urease test and histology on biopsies from the antrum and the
      corpus. Bacterial eradication was assessed by endoscopy (peptic ulcer patients)
      or 13C urea breath test (non-ulcer dyspepsia patients) 4-6 weeks after therapy
      had ended. RESULTS: All patients completed the study. H. pylori eradication was
      achieved in all but one patient, with an eradication rate of 98% (95% CI:
      94.3-100) with intention-to-treat analysis. Patient compliance was good
      (consumption of prescribed drugs > 95%) for all but one patient, who took the
      triple therapy regimen for 4 days instead of 5 days. No major side-effects were
      reported but three (6%) patients complained of mild side-effects. CONCLUSIONS:
      The use of this 'five plus five' therapy schedule as an initial treatment for H. 
      pylori deserves further investigation.

TI  - Gastric acidity and acid breakthrough with twice-daily omeprazole or
      lansoprazole.
PG  - 709-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: In patients with severe gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD),
      proton pump inhibitors are being used increasingly in twice-daily regimens to
      improve control of gastric acidity. Few data exist to compare the ability of the 
      most-often used proton pump inhibitors, omeprazole and lansoprazole, to control
      gastric acid at twice-daily dosage regimens. Nocturnal acid breakthrough, defined
      as gastric pH < 4.0 continuously for > 60 min, may compromise treatment goals in 
      patients with GERD. AIM: To compare the effects of omeprazole 20 mg b.d. or
      lansoprazole 30 mg b.d. on gastric acidity and the relative ability of each
      dosage regimen to prevent acid breakthrough. METHODS: In a crossover
      pharmacodynamic study, 20 healthy volunteers (10 male, 10 female, mean age 38
      years) were given omeprazole 20 mg b.d. or lansoprazole 30 mg b.d. for 7 days
      each, in a randomized manner. Each dosage regimen was separated by a minimum
      7-day period where no medication was administered. On day 7 of each regimen, 24-h
      intragastric pH-metry was performed. The percentage of time for which gastric pH 
      was below 4.0 and 3.0, the occurrence of daytime and nocturnal acid breakthrough,
      and the duration of action of each regimen were compared. Non-parametric
      statistics for paired data were used. RESULTS: The percentage time for which
      gastric pH was below 4.0 was significantly lower with omeprazole 20 mg b.d.
      (median 14.8%) than with lansoprazole 30 mg b. d. (median 24.2; P=0.0372).
      Fourteen subjects showed more effective acid control when taking omeprazole;
      these were significantly more often H. pylori-negative patients compared with
      those for whom acid control was better on lansoprazole (P < 0.001). Nocturnal
      acid breakthrough occurred in seven patients (35%) on omeprazole and in 10 (50%) 
      on lansoprazole (N.S.). CONCLUSION: In healthy volunteers, twice-daily dosing of 
      omeprazole 20 mg b.d. appears to be significantly more effective than
      lansoprazole 30 mg b.d. in controlling gastric acidity. The clinical importance
      of such a difference remains to be defined in GERD patients.

TI  - A placebo-controlled study to assess the effects of 7-day dosing with 10, 20 and 
      40 mg rabeprazole on 24-h intragastric acidity and plasma gastrin in healthy male
      subjects.
PG  - 691-9
AB  - AIM: To compare the effects of rabeprazole 10, 20 and 40 mg o.d. on 24-h
      intragastric acidity and plasma gastrin concentration in a randomized,
      double-blind placebo-controlled trial. METHODS: Twenty-four healthy male
      volunteers were studied on the 7th day of morning dosing with either placebo or
      rabeprazole 10, 20 or 40 mg in a crossover fashion. On day 7, hourly intragastric
      acidity was measured for 24 h from 08.00 hours by gastric aspiration. Plasma
      gastrin concentrations were also measured hourly from 08.00 to 24.00 hours, and
      2-hourly thereafter. RESULTS: Compared with placebo, rabeprazole 10, 20 and 40 mg
      produced significant dose-related decreases in intragastric acidity (median 24-h 
      integrated acidity=697, 186, 129 and 82 mmol h/L, respectively). This was
      associated with significant elevation of plasma gastrin concentration (median
      24-h integrated gastrin=141, 1184, 1484 and 1763 pmol.h/L, respectively).
      Rabeprazole 40 mg resulted in significantly decreased acidity compared with both 
      10 and 20 mg, and in longer times for which intragastric pH was maintained at > 3
      (19. 2 h vs. 17.3 h and 17.5 h) and > 4 (17 h vs. 14.2 h and 15.2 h), but was
      accompanied by significantly increased plasma gastrin. There was a consistent
      trend for greater antisecretory activity for 20 mg compared with 10 mg, but these
      differences did not reach statistical significance. The interindividual
      variability in antisecretory response was greatest with 10 mg. CONCLUSIONS:
      Rabeprazole 10, 20 and 40 mg produce significant, profound dose-related
      inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Taking into account reciprocal increases in
      plasma gastrin and the interindividual variation in antisecretory response, 20 mg
      appears to be the preferred dose for routine clinical use.

TI  - Review article: potential gastrointestinal effects of long-term acid suppression 
      with proton pump inhibitors.
PG  - 651-68
AB  - This review examines the evidence for the development of adverse effects due to
      prolonged gastric acid suppression with proton pump inhibitors. Potential areas
      of concern regarding long-term proton pump inhibitor use have included: carcinoid
      formation; development of gastric adenocarcinoma (especially in patients with
      Helicobacter pylori infection); bacterial overgrowth; enteric infections; and
      malabsorption of fat, minerals, and vitamins. Prolonged proton pump inhibitor use
      may lead to enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia, but has not been demonstrated
      to increase the risk of carcinoid formation. Long-term proton pump inhibitor
      treatment has not been documented to hasten the development or the progression of
      atrophic gastritis to intestinal metaplasia and gastric cancer, although
      long-term studies are required to allow definitive conclusions. At present, we do
      not recommend that patients be tested routinely for H. pylori infection when
      using proton pump inhibitors for prolonged periods. Gastric bacterial overgrowth 
      does increase with acid suppression, but important clinical sequelae, such a
      higher rate of gastric adenocarcinoma, have not been seen. The risk of enteric
      infection may increase with acid suppression, although this does not seem to be a
      common clinical problem with prolonged proton pump inhibitor use. The absorption 
      of fats and minerals does not appear to be significantly impaired with chronic
      acid suppression. However, vitamin B12 concentration may be decreased when
      gastric acid is markedly suppressed for prolonged periods (e.g.
      Zolllinger-Ellison syndrome), and vitamin B12 levels should probably be assessed 
      in patients taking high-dose proton pump inhibitors for many years. Thus, current
      evidence suggests that prolonged gastric acid suppression with proton pump
      inhibitors rarely, if ever, produces adverse events. Nevertheless, continued
      follow-up of patients taking proton pump inhibitors for extended periods will
      provide greater experience regarding the potential gastrointestinal adverse
      effects of long-term acid suppression.

TI  - [Effectiveness of omeprazole, clarithromycin and amoxycillin therapy to eradicate
      Helicobacter pylori in patients with active peptic ulcer. Preliminary results of 
      GENPY study].
PG  - 441-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: To compare the effectiveness of two length of the same therapy to
      eradicate Helicobacter pylori in patients with non complicated active peptic
      ulcer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 223 patients visited at primary health centres. A
      randomised controlled trial was carried out to compare the results of 6 or 7 days
      of treatment with clarithromycin 500 mg, amoxicillin 1 g and omeprazole 20 mg,
      b.i.d. All patients received omeprazole for other 14 days. RESULTS: 108 patients 
      were randomised to the 6 days group and 115 to the 7 days one. Both groups were
      comparable with respect to basic characteristics except for sex: the proportion
      of men was higher in the 6 days group (p = 0.04). 91.4% of the patients received 
      all the treatment correctly. By intention to treat analysis, eradication rates
      were 76.9% in the 6 days group and 77.4% in the seven days group (IC 95% of the
      difference from -10.5 to 11.6). There were not statistically significant
      differences in eradication rates in relation to age, sex, ulcer location,
      recurrence or tobacco consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Although eradication rates are
      lower than expected, in this study there are no differences between 6 or 7 days
      of therapy.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori eradication with lansoprazole, amoxycillin and
      clarithromycin: testing an ideal regimen in a multicultural south east Asian
      population and examining factors potentially influencing eradication.
PG  - 231-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: From European and North American data, it is recommended in the Asia 
      Pacific consensus statement, that one week therapy with a proton pump inhibitor, 
      amoxycillin and clarithromycin be used for Helicobacter pylori eradication, in
      areas of high metronidazole resistance. The efficacy of this regimen is unknown
      in Singapore. AIM: To assess the efficacy, safety and compliance of an H. pylori 
      eradication regimen and examine clinical factors that potentially determine
      eradication. METHODS: Consecutive outpatients from a multicultural, south east
      Asian, population with H. pylori infection, with or without peptic ulcer, were
      treated with lansoprazole 30 mg, amoxycillin 1 gm, clarithromycin 500 mg, twice a
      day for seven days. Eradication was assessed by either rapid urease, histology or
      urea breath test. Compliance and side effects were recorded. The eradication rate
      and effect of ethnicity, age, sex, usage of alcohol, smoking and non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs, history of ulcer and endoscopic diagnosis on eradication
      were examined by univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Of 113 patients, 
      the eradication rate by intention to treat was 98/113 (87%) (95% confidence
      interval [CI] 80-93%) and per protocol was 98/106 (92%) (95% CI 87-97%). Using
      Fisher's exact test, eradication was more successful in Chinese (intention to
      treat and per protocol respectively p=0.02 and p<0.001) compared to non-Chinese. 
      By logistic regression analysis ethnicity was an independent factor associated
      with eradication success (p=0.0025). Side effects occurred in five (4.4%),
      resulting in cessation of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This one week eradication
      regimen is safe and effective in south east Asians. Chinese ethnicity may be
      associated with a higher likelihood of eradication success.

TI  - One-week therapy with pantoprazole versus ranitidine bismuth citrate plus two
      antibiotics for Helicobacter pylori eradication.
PG  - 489-95
AB  - AIM: A combination of omeprazole plus amoxycillin (Amo) and clarithromycin (CIa) 
      for 7 days has been studied extensively. However, the role of other proton pump
      inhibitors, such as pantoprazole (Pan), in this therapy is not well known. On the
      other hand, ranitidine bismuth citrate (RBC) also seems to be effective when
      combined with Amo and CIa. Our aim was to evaluate and to compare these two novel
      short-term triple therapies (Pan+Amo+Cla and RBC+Amo+Cla) for treatment of
      Helicobacter pylori. METHODS: In a randomized clinical trial 150 consecutive
      patients (38 with duodenal ulcer, 112 with non-ulcer dyspepsia) infected by H.
      pylori were studied prospectively. Exclusion criteria were: previous H. pylori
      eradication therapy, gastroerosive drug use, gastric surgery, and associated
      diseases. One of two regimens was given for 7 days: Pan (40 mg b.i.d.), Amo (1 g 
      b.i.d.), Cla (500 mg b.i.d.) (group Pan+Amo+Cla, n = 75); or RBC (400 mg b.i.d.),
      Amo (1 g b.i.d.), Cla (500 mg b.i.d.) (group RBC+Amo+Cla, n = 75). All drugs were
      administered together after meals. Compliance was evaluated by return tablet
      count. Data were analysed by univariate (chi2) and multivariate (multiple
      logistic regression) analysis. Eradication was defined as a negative 13C-urea
      breath test 1 month after completing therapy. RESULTS: The distribution of
      studied variables (age, gender, smoking, duodenal ulcer/non-ulcer dyspepsia) was 
      similar in both therapy groups. Per-protocol eradication was achieved in 48/71
      (68%) in group Pan+Amo+Cla, and in 61/70 (87%) in group RBC+Amo+Cla (P= 0.01).
      Intention-to-treat (ITT) eradication was achieved in, respectively, 48/ 75 (64%) 
      and in 61/75 (81%) (P= 0.03). The RBC+ Amo+Cla regimen was more effective than
      Pan+Amo+Cla in non-ulcer dyspepsia patients (ITT, 84% vs 58%; P = 0.005), but
      statistically significant differences were not demonstrated in duodenal ulcer
      patients (72% vs 80%). In the multivariate analysis the odds ratio for the effect
      of the type of therapy on H. pylori eradication in patients with non-ulcer
      dyspepsia was 3.8 (95% Cl, 1.6-9.3; P = 0.003). No relevant adverse effects were 
      reported with any regimen. CONCLUSION: A RBC+Amo+Cla regimen for only 1 week is a
      promising therapy for H. pylori infection, due to its high efficacy, simple
      posology, and excellent tolerability. Combination of Pan with Amo and Cla,
      although effective in duodenal ulcer patients, but in non-ulcer dyspepsia has not
      achieved the favourable results previously reported with other proton pump
      inhibitors.

TI  - Eradication of Helicobacter pylori with lansoprazole based triple therapy in
      peptic ulcer disease.
PG  - 230-5
AB  - Lansoprazole 30 mg, amoxicillin 1000 mg, and tinidazole 500 mg were given twice
      daily to 39 peptic ulcer patients (26 duodenal and 13 gastric ulcer, mean age
      52.4 +/- 15.01) who had H. pylori infection for two weeks. Additional
      lansoprazole 30 mg daily was given to duodenal and gastric ulcer patients for
      another two and six weeks respectively. Follow-up gastroduodenoscope was
      performed at fourth and eighth week and eighth and twelfth week for all duodenal 
      and gastric ulcer patients, respectively. H. pylori status was evaluated by rapid
      urease test (CLO test) and histology at first and last endoscope. The ulcers were
      healed at the last endoscopy in 11 (85%) gastric ulcer patients and 24 (92%)
      duodenal ulcers patients. H. pylori infection was eradicated in 31 patients
      (79%). Mild side effects were observed in 15 per cent. In conclusion, 2 week
      regimen of lansoprazole, amoxicillin, and tinidazole triple therapy resulted in a
      relatively high healing rate of peptic ulcer (90%) and an acceptable eradication 
      rate of H. pylori infection (79%).

TI  - A meta-analysis of short versus long therapy with a proton pump inhibitor,
      clarithromycin and either metronidazole or amoxycillin for treating Helicobacter 
      pylori infection.
PG  - 603-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although triple therapies with a proton pump inhibitor,
      clarithromycin and either amoxycillin or metronidazole are the most widely
      accepted treatment for Helicobacter pylori infection, there is no consensus on
      how long treatment should be maintained for. AIM: To evaluate whether increasing 
      the length of triple therapies beyond 7 days improves treatment efficacy.
      METHODS: An extensive search of the literature was performed. Reports of
      randomized trials comparing different lengths of therapy were selected. Short
      (7-day) vs. long (10/14-day) therapies were compared, and three-way comparison of
      7-day vs. 10-day, 10-day vs. 14-day and 7-day vs. 14-day therapies was performed.
      Meta-analysis was conducted using conventional shareware (Review Manager 4.0).
      The Peto Odds Ratio using a fixed model analysis was calculated for each
      comparison. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were identified. Pooled 10- to 14-day
      therapies achieved better results than 7-day schedules. In head-to-head
      comparisons, only 14-day therapies were significantly better than 7-day
      treatments. Improvement in cure rates ranged from 7 to 9%. Comparisons of 7-day
      vs. 10-day and 10-day vs. 14-day also showed a non-significant trend towards
      better cure rates with longer therapies. CONCLUSIONS: Fourteen-day, proton pump
      inhibitor-based triple therapy achieves better results than 7-day schedules.
      Additional data are necessary to evaluate 10-day therapies.

TI  - The effects of omeprazole on healing and appearance of small gastric and duodenal
      lesions during dosing with diclofenac in healthy subjects.
PG  - 535-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are associated with
      gastrointestinal mucosal damage. Omeprazole prevents the formation, and
      accelerates the healing, of NSAID-induced ulcers. AIM: To test whether omeprazole
      accelerates healing of standardized gastroduodenal lesions in the presence of
      diclofenac. METHODS: In a double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled,
      crossover study, 12 healthy volunteers received consecutive, 2-week courses of
      omeprazole (40 mg o.d.) and placebo, in random order, with an intervening, 4-week
      washout period; diclofenac (50 mg t.d.s.), was given for the second week of each 
      course. Five endoscopies were performed, one at the outset and the others before 
      and after each course of diclofenac. Biopsies were taken from the endoscopically 
      normal mucosa of the corpus, antrum and duodenum and also from any new mucosal
      lesion that developed after diclofenac. The sites of biopsies taken before each
      course of diclofenac were evaluated endoscopically after each course to assess
      the extent of healing according to a predetermined healing score scale. RESULTS: 
      The healing scores observed after administration of placebo/diclofenac (median=0;
      range 0-6) and after omeprazole/diclofenac (median=0; range 0-6; P=0.17) did not 
      differ. Small gastroduodenal lesions developed de novo in six subjects during
      placebo/diclofenac and in seven during omeprazole/diclofenac. Focal chemical
      gastropathy was observed only in close proximity to macroscopic lesions.
      CONCLUSIONS: In healthy subjects, omeprazole does not accelerate the healing of
      pre-existing mucosal lesions or prevent the development of small
      diclofenac-induced mucosal lesions.

TI  - Pantoprazole 20 mg is an effective maintenance therapy for patients with
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 425-32
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy of 20 mg with 40 mg pantoprazole in
      maintaining symptomatic and endoscopic remission in patients with
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). STUDY DESIGN: Patients (18-84 years
      old; n = 433) with healed GORD II or III were included in this prospective
      multi-centre, randomized, parallel, double-blind study. Pantoprazole was
      administered once daily for up to 1 year as either a 20 mg or 40 mg
      enteric-coated tablet to 221 and 212 patients, respectively. Symptoms of GORD
      were assessed every 3 months. Endoscopy was performed at entry, after 6 and 12
      months, or when symptoms of GORD were perceived on at least three consecutive
      days. The primary efficacy parameter was the time until endoscopically proven
      relapse of GORD occurred (stage I or greater); the secondary parameters included 
      tolerability, safety, and time until symptomatic relapse occurred. RESULTS: In
      the 20 mg treatment group, 87% and 75% of patients were in endoscopic remission
      after 6 and 12 months, respectively; the corresponding rates in the 40 mg
      treatment group were 91% and 78%. In both treatment groups, GORD stage I
      accounted for about 50% of endoscopic relapses. The symptomatic remission rates
      in the 20 mg group were estimated as 85% and 77% after 6 and 12 months,
      respectively; the corresponding values in the 40 mg group were 87% and 76%. No
      correlation was seen either between the endoscopically proven relapse and
      perception of symptoms, or between the severity of the pre-treatment stage of
      GORD and the maintenance dose of pantoprazole. Both doses were well tolerated.
      CONCLUSIONS: Both the 20 mg and 40 mg doses of pantoprazole are safe and
      effective in maintaining patients with healed reflux oesophagitis in remission.
      Moreover, for the majority of patients, the 20 mg dose provides adequate
      long-term therapeutic efficacy at a minimal drug exposure and lower costs.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori-negative peptic ulcers: frequency and implications for
      management.
PG  - 29-32
AB  - Most patients with peptic ulcers are infected with Helicobacter pylori, but the
      infection may not be responsible for the ulcer. It is increasingly recognized
      that different causes of ulcers coexist in a given patient, confounding
      determination of the exact cause of the ulcer. For example, in infected patients 
      with ulcers who also are using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), it 
      is not possible to establish the ulcer's cause. Moreover, recent studies in the
      United States in infected patients with duodenal ulcers who were treated with
      various regimens to prove their efficacy in eradicating H. pylori and preventing 
      ulcer recurrence found that approximately 20% of patients suffered an ulcer
      recurrence despite successful H. pylori eradication. The infection clearly did
      not cause their ulcers but was originally thought to have done so. Thus, as many 
      as one-fifth of patients with ulcers may have the cause falsely attributed to H. 
      pylori infection. When this number is added to that of ulcer patients who are H. 
      pylori-negative upon original presentation--at least 20% in other recent U.S.
      studies--it is evident that the proportion of non-H. pylori ulcer patients is
      larger than originally believed. This proportion is likely to increase with the
      declining incidence of H. pylori infection. Other causes of ulcers include the
      use of aspirin and NSAIDs (which may be surreptitious), hypersecretory states,
      Crohn's disease, and patients with "idiopathic" ulcers. Patients with
      "idiopathic" ulcers are characterized by postprandial hypersecretion of acid and 
      hypergastrinemia with accelerated gastric emptying. H. pylori ulcers may be
      difficult to manage because antisecretory drugs are less effective in inhibiting 
      gastric acidity in the absence of H. pylori infection.

TI  - Prescription of proton pump inhibitors before endoscopy. A potential cause of
      missed diagnosis of early gastric cancers.
PG  - 385-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Early gastric cancer is frequently seen with nonspecific dyspeptic
      symptoms and subtle endoscopic features. Treatment at this stage of the disease
      produces a high chance of cure. If the diagnosis is missed at this early stage,
      then the prognosis may be much poorer depending on the subsequent delay in
      reaching a diagnosis. OBJECTIVES: To report the healing effect of proton pump
      inhibitors on early gastric cancer. METHODS: This article reports a case series
      of 7 patients with ulcerated early gastric cancers indistinguishable as malignant
      gastric ulcers at endoscopy who were inadvertently prescribed a short course of a
      proton pump inhibitor prior to a second confirmatory endoscopy. The cases studied
      were patients with dyspeptic symptoms referred from primary care physicians for
      upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. RESULTS: In each case the patient became
      asymptomatic, the endoscopic signs seen at the first endoscopy had resolved, and 
      the lesions could not be recognized even by an experienced endoscopist. If the
      proton pump inhibitors had been prescribed by the referring physician before the 
      first endoscopy, the diagnosis probably would have been missed. These cases
      demonstrate the potentially serious masking effect of prescribing a short course 
      of these drugs before making an endoscopic diagnosis. Even though the patient has
      been referred for endoscopy, the endoscopist may fail to identify the lesion and 
      thus miss the diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Primary care physicians must resist the
      pressures to prescribe proton pump inhibitors before endoscopy, particularly in
      patients older than 45 years, if the diagnostic yield of gastric cancer in the
      early curable stages is to be maximized.

TI  - Patients with dyspepsia benefit from eradication of Helicobacter pylori if other 
      organic causes for dyspepsia were carefully ruled out.
PG  - 211-9
AB  - AIM: In order to investigate the potential of Helicobacter pylori (HP) to induce 
      dyspepsia, we performed a randomized prospective study on the long-term effect of
      HP-eradication on symptoms of HP-positive dyspeptic patients in whom other
      organic causes for dyspepsia were carefully ruled out. PATIENTS: 201 patients
      referred to our endoscopy unit with dyspeptic symptoms for at least six months
      entered the study. Patients with previous peptic ulcer were excluded. METHODS:
      After endoscopy of the upper alimentary tract and 13C-urea breath test, patients 
      with active peptic ulcer, hiatal hernia, macroscopic evidence for esophagitis and
      negative HP-status were excluded. The remaining patients underwent abdominal
      sonography, H2-exhalation test with lactose, and 24-h pH monitoring in order to
      exclude other organic causes for dyspepsia. In 20 patients, dyspepsia was assumed
      to be due to HP-gastritis. Patients received eradication therapy and were
      controlled as assessed by the 13C-urea breath test six weeks and six months after
      completion of the therapy. Dyspeptic symptoms were monitored by means of a
      validated symptom score. RESULTS: Out of 20 patients with HP-gastritis the first 
      eradication treatment was successful in 13, while seven patients remained
      HP-positive after antibiotic treatment. Six months after completion of therapy
      the symptoms of HP-eradicated patients improved considerably (score values 17.4
      +/- 1.5 and 10.2 +/- 0.8, respectively, p < 0.01) whereas symptoms of patients
      with persistent infection remained unchanged (21.1 +/- 1.7 and 20.4 +/- 1.5,
      n.s.) and only improved after successful retherapy (20.4 +/- 1.5 and 11.7 +/-
      2.1, p < 0.05). In total, 17 of 20 patients (85%) improved after successful
      eradication. Also, neutrophil infiltration in the gastric mucosa correlated to
      both dyspeptic symptoms before therapy (r = 0.85) and the decrease in symptom
      score after HP-eradication (r = 0.61). In contrast, the symptoms of eight
      patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease were not improved after eradication
      (20.0 +/- 1.1 and 18.2 +/- 1.0, n.s.) CONCLUSIONS: HP-infection per se
      contributes to dyspepsia. 17 of 20 (85%) HP-positive dyspeptic patients improved 
      after HP-eradication, when other potential organic causes for dyspepsia had been 
      ruled out. However, many patients did not completely recover but the symptoms
      only partly decreased which parallels the persistence of part of the inflammatory
      infiltration in the gastric mucosa. This emphasizes the importance of
      HP-gastritis as an organic disease causing dyspeptic symptoms.

TI  - Efficacy of different Helicobacter pylori eradication regimens in patients
      affected by insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 260-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) are often
      affected by chronic infections; antibiotic absorption, however, may be influenced
      by the disease. H. pylori eradication appears to be reduced in IDDM patients. The
      aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of the most common H. pylori
      eradication regimens in a population of IDDM-infected patients. METHODS: One
      hundred and seventy-two IDDM patients were evaluated. H. pylori infection was
      assessed through the 13C-urea breath test. Infected patients were randomly
      assigned to three different standard 7-day eradication regimens: 1) amoxicillin, 
      clarithromycin, pantoprazole; 2) tinidazole, clarithromycin, ranitidine bismuth
      citrate; or 3) tinidazole, clarithromycin, pantoprazole. Patients in whom
      eradication was not successful in the first cycle were subsequently submitted to 
      a 7-day therapy with tinidazole, tetracycline, bismuth, and pantoprazole.
      RESULTS: Thirty-seven per cent of IDDM patients were infected. None of the triple
      therapies used provided an eradication higher than 62%. Conversely, the quadruple
      regimen was successful in 88% of the patients. Ten per cent of the subjects
      undergoing the triple therapies showed minor side effects, without significant
      differences among groups, whereas side effects occurred in 25% of the patients
      treated with the quadruple therapy (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: IDDM patients show a 
      low H. pylori eradication rate with a standard triple therapy regardless of the
      regimen utilized, the dosage and/or the duration of the therapy used appearing
      not to be sufficient to eradicate the infection efficiently. The use of a
      quadruple regimen leads to the cure of a large percentage of the infected
      patients in whom the eradication was unsuccessful in the first therapy, although 
      it is accompanied by a greater incidence of minor side effects.

TI  - Effect of Helicobacter pylori eradication on chronic gastritis during omeprazole 
      therapy.
PG  - 615-21
AB  - BACKGROUND: We have previously observed that profound acid suppressive therapy in
      Helicobacter pylori positive patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease is
      associated with increased corpus inflammation and accelerated development of
      atrophic gastritis. AIM: To investigate if H pylori eradication at the start of
      acid suppressive therapy prevents the development of these histological changes. 
      PATIENTS/METHODS: In a prospective randomised case control study, patients with
      reflux oesophagitis were treated with omeprazole 40 mg once daily for 12 months. 
      H pylori positive patients were randomised to additional double blind treatment
      with omeprazole 20 mg, amoxicillin 1000 mg and clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily 
      or placebo for one week. Biopsy sampling for histology, scored according to the
      updated Sydney classification, and culture were performed at baseline, and at
      three and 12 months. RESULTS: In the persistently H pylori positive group (n=24),
      active inflammation increased in the corpus and decreased in the antrum during
      therapy (p=0.032 and p=0.002, respectively). In contrast, in the H pylori
      positive group that became H pylori negative as a result of treatment (n=33),
      active and chronic inflammation in both the corpus and antrum decreased (p<or
      =0.0001). The decrease in active and chronic inflammation in the corpus differed 
      significantly compared with the persistently H pylori positive group (both
      p=0.001). For atrophy scores, no significant differences were observed between H 
      pylori eradicated and persistently H pylori positive patients within one year of 
      follow up. No changes were observed in the H pylori negative control group
      (n=26). CONCLUSIONS: H pylori eradication prevents the increase in corpus
      gastritis associated with profound acid suppressive therapy. Longer follow up is 
      needed to determine if H pylori eradication prevents the development of atrophic 
      gastritis.

PG  - 413-20
AB  - AIM: To define the characteristics of patients consulting with active dyspeptic
      symptoms in urban general practice, and to consider the implications of applying 
      the British Society of Gastroenterology Dyspepsia management guidelines. DESIGN: 
      Prospective observational study over a period of 12 months. SETTING: Two
      multipartner, two-centre general practices in the City of Leeds (UK) with a
      combined target population of 11 011 registered patients. SUBJECTS: A total of
      340 patients consulting with active dyspeptic symptoms (52% male; mean age 53
      years, range 16-89 years). RESULTS: Of the practice population, 3% consulted with
      dyspepsia (first-time consulter: 19%; previous consulter not yet investigated:
      30%; previously investigated: 51%). Of 168 undiagnosed patients, 43% had upper
      abdominal pain (dysmotility-like symptoms in 42%), 35% had reflux symptoms, 22%
      had mixed symptoms, 12% had 'alarm' symptoms and 18% had a history of NSAID use. 
      Patients < 45 years old with simple dyspepsia accounted for 32% of undiagnosed
      cases. A fifth of the workload was in dealing with undiagnosed dyspeptics over 45
      years old. One per cent of the population would require endoscopy if all
      undiagnosed cases either > 45 years or with complicated dyspepsia were
      investigated. Of 172 previously investigated patients, 29% had negative tests,
      25% had 'minor' findings, and 45% had evidence of acid-peptic disease. Patients
      with duodenal ulcer disease accounted for 12% of the total workload. CONCLUSIONS:
      A knowledge of the characteristics of patients consulting with dyspepsia in
      primary care should allow the adaptation of guidelines, to ensure advice is
      relevant to local case mix and compatible with local resources.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic interaction between proton pump inhibitors and roxithromycin in
      volunteers.
PG  - 407-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: Triple therapy including two antibiotics and a proton pump inhibitor 
      is a rational approach to the treatment of Helicobacter pylori induced peptic
      ulcer disease. The interaction of antimicrobial therapy and acid suppression is
      not yet well elucidated. AIMS: To investigate the effects of proton pump
      inhibitors on roxithromycin levels in plasma and gastric tissue under
      steady-state conditions in volunteers. METHODS: In two crossover studies
      omeprazole 20 mg b.d., lansoprazole 30 mg b.d., roxithromycin 300 mg b.d., and
      the combination of roxithromycin with either omeprazole or lansoprazole were
      administered to 12 healthy volunteers over 6 days. Blood plasma levels of the
      drugs were measured. In addition, roxithromycin concentrations were also
      determined in gastric juice and gastric tissue obtained during endoscopy.
      RESULTS: The proton pump inhibitors and roxithromycin did not alter the blood
      plasma pharmacokinetics of each other. When compared to roxithromycin
      administered alone, its combination with a proton pump inhibitor significantly
      increased the roxithromycin concentrations in gastric juice (3.0-5.0 microg/mL
      vs. 0.3-0.4 microg/mL) and gastric tissue (antrum: 3.8-4.0 vs. 2.8 microg/g,
      fundus: 5.9-7.4 vs. 4.2-4.4 microg/g). CONCLUSIONS: Proton pump inhibitors and
      roxithromycin do not alter the systemic bioavailability of each other. However,
      proton pump inhibitors increase the local concentration of roxithromycin in the
      stomach which may contribute to the clinically proven synergic beneficial action 
      in eradication therapy of H. pylori.

TI  - The omeprazole test is as sensitive as 24-h oesophageal pH monitoring in
      diagnosing gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in symptomatic patients with erosive
      oesophagitis.
PG  - 389-96
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ambulatory 24-h oesophageal pH monitoring and a short course of high 
      dose omeprazole can be used as diagnostic modalities for GERD. However,
      comparative studies of the diagnostic accuracy and reliability of both strategies
      have not been performed. AIM: To compare the omeprazole test to ambulatory 24-h
      oesophageal pH monitoring in diagnosing GERD in symptomatic patients using
      endoscopically proven erosive oesophagitis as a gold standard. METHODS: Patients 
      with heartburn underwent an upper endoscopy. Only those with erosive oesophagitis
      were included in the study. Subsequently, patients underwent ambulatory 24-h
      oesophageal pH monitoring and an 'omeprazole test.' Daily symptoms were recorded 
      during the first week (baseline) and repeated during the second week on therapy
      (omeprazole 40 mg in the morning and 20 mg in the evening). RESULTS: Thirty-five 
      patients were included in the study. The omeprazole test was significantly more
      sensitive in diagnosing GERD than total acid contact time on 24-h oesophageal pH 
      monitoring (83% vs. 60%; P < 0.03). However, the sensitivity of the pH test
      increased to 80% after adding patients with a positive symptom index, and
      patients with abnormal acid exposure in the supine or erect positions despite
      normal total acid contact time. Patients with a normal pH test were significantly
      younger (49 +/- 2.6 years) than those with abnormal test (59 +/- 1.8; P=0.002).
      CONCLUSIONS: In this study an omeprazole test was at least as sensitive as
      ambulatory 24-h oesophageal pH monitoring in diagnosing GERD in patients with
      erosive oesophagitis.

TI  - From bench to bedside to bug: an update of clinically relevant advances in the
      care of persons with Helicobacter pylori- associated diseases.
PG  - 188-98
AB  - In-depth meetings of the XIth International Workshop on Gastroduodenal Pathology 
      and Helicobacter pylori led to the presentation and discussion of extensive new
      data on H. pylori and its diseases. The mode of transmission of H. pylori remains
      unclear, and it remains unknown why only a small proportion of infected
      individuals develop duodenal or gastric ulcer disease and even fewer develop
      gastric cancer. The role of H. pylori eradication in persons with uninvestigated 
      dyspepsia remains controversial. New clinical trials of H. pylori treatment show 
      symptom relief and improvement in the quality of life of persons with functional 
      dyspepsia, especially in those with ulcer-like or reflux-like dyspepsia. Clearly 
      the move is toward symptom-based management of persons with dyspepsia, with fewer
      endoscopies being needed in the otherwise healthy young dyspeptic patients. It
      remains controversial whether eradicating H. pylori in duodenal ulcer or
      functional dyspepsia increases the risk of subsequent development of
      gastroesophageal reflux disease. The one-week proton pump inhibitor-based triple 
      regimens remain the gold standard of H. pylori therapy, but some of the
      ranitidine bismuth citrate plus two antibiotic regimens also achieve an 80% H.
      pylori eradication rate on an intention-to-treat basis. While the urea breath
      test remains the noninvasive test of choice, interesting new data are available
      on the use of stool antigen testing to diagnose H. pylori infection. The number
      of H pylori-associated gastroduodenal diseases grows to include possible liver,
      vascular, immune and skin conditions.

TI  - Costs and benefits of a test-and-treat strategy in Helicobacter pylori-infected
      subjects: a prospective intervention study in general practice.
PG  - 319-25
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify health outcomes and costs/savings of a Helicobacter pylori
      test-and-treat strategy in patients using acid suppressants chronically. DESIGN: 
      Prospective intervention study. Patients were tested for H. pylori infection and 
      treated with 14 days of ranitidine bismuth citrate (RBC) 400 mg (b.i.d.) and
      clarithromycin 500 mg if infected. Cure was determined after six months. SETTING:
      General practice. PARTICIPANTS: Patients using acid suppressants chronically were
      identified by a computer search; 184 patients gave written consent and were
      included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Serology, symptom questionnaire, medication
      history, quality of life determination, costs/savings. RESULTS: Out of 184
      patients, 85 (46%) had positive serology. A cure rate of 61/80 (76%) was
      achieved. The intervention group showed significant symptom relief. Benefits were
      evident in patients with ulcer disease but also in patients with uninvestigated
      dyspepsia. Quality of life improved for cured patients in the intervention group.
      No improvements for dyspeptic symptoms or quality of life occurred in the H.
      pylori-negative group. After six months, significant savings for medication use
      had occurred in treated patients diagnosed as ulcer disease or non-ulcer
      dyspepsia. Savings on drug use and doctor visits equalize with costs for tests
      and antibiotics after nine months. Although less, costs for drugs also decreased 
      significantly in the H. pylori-negative group. Therefore, for the study
      population, costs and savings are even after 6.5 months. CONCLUSIONS: A
      test-and-treat strategy for H. pylori, systematically applied at the population
      level in patients using acid suppressants chronically, results in significant
      health benefits and economic savings within 1 year of follow-up.

TI  - Is 1-week treatment for peptic ulcer healing sufficient and safe?
PG  - 5-12
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To confirm whether 1-week anti-Helicobacter therapy to achieve ulcer
      healing is sufficient and safe. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients
      with peptic ulcer who were infected with Helicobacter pylori and treated with 3
      different 7-day regimens, according to predefined protocols in 3 different
      centers in the same geographical area (Aragon, Spain). Three combinations
      commonly described in the literature were used: a) omeprazole (40 mg/24 h),
      tetracycline hydrochloride (2 g/24 h), colloidal bismuth subcitrate (480 mg/24 h)
      and metronidazole (750 mg/24 h) (OBTM, n = 105); b) omeprazole (40 mg/24 h),
      clarithromycin (1.5 g/24 h) and amoxicillin (3 g/24 h) (O40C1.5A3, n = 13); and
      c) omeprazole (40 mg/24 h), clarithromycin (1 g/24 h) and amoxicillin (2 g/24 h) 
      (O40C1A2, n = 4). In all patients the diagnosis of peptic ulcer disease was
      confirmed endoscopically, and H. pylori infection was verified with urease
      testing and histological analysis. After treatment ended, no other antacids were 
      allowed until after endoscopic examination to check eradication and ulcer
      healing. RESULTS: 122 patients were included (107 with duodenal ulcer, 12 with
      gastric ulcer and 3 with both). Compliance was good and side effects infrequent
      and mild. Eradication rates were 88.5% (93/105) in the OBTM group, 100% (13/13)
      with O40C1.5A3, and 75% (3/4) with O40C1A2. Healing was achieved in 98.16%
      (107/109) of the patients in whom the bacterial infection was eradicated, and in 
      23.07% (3/13) of those in whom it was not (p < 0.0001). No patient had any
      complications during the period without treatment. CONCLUSIONS: 1-week
      eradication therapy with previously described combinations commonly used in
      clinical practice achieves high ulcer healing rates with no complications in the 
      period without antacid treatment. We consider that it is not necessary, at least 
      in most patients, to prolong antacid therapy.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic considerations in the eradication of Helicobacter pylori.
PG  - 243-70
AB  - As Helicobacter pylori plays an important role in the aetiopathogenesis of peptic
      ulcer, therapeutic strategies aimed at maintaining long term remission have
      shifted from the control of intragastric pH to targeting H. pylori. According to 
      recent international guidelines the clinical goals--rapid ulcer healing and
      prevention of relapse--can be best accomplished by combination therapy consisting
      of an antisecretory drug (proton pump inhibitor or ranitidine) and 2
      antimicrobial agents (preferable amoxicillin, clarithromycin or metronidazole).
      When applying such multidrug regimens, possible synergy between the agents
      suggests that pharmacokinetic considerations might help to improve H. pylori
      eradication rates, which should be above 85 to 90% on an intention-to-treat
      basis. The present review summarises the pharmacokinetic properties and
      interaction potential of all drugs presently used in the various H. pylori
      eradication regimens, with emphasis on particular patient populations such as the
      elderly and those with renal impairment. The drugs considered are omeprazole,
      lansoprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole, ranitidine and ranitidine bismutrex,
      bismuth salts, amoxicillin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, roxithromycin,
      metronidazole, tinidazole and tetracycline. When addressing the clinically
      important questions of the efficacy, safety and costs of the recommended
      regimens, the impact of drug disposition on H. pylori eradication should not be
      neglected.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of 20 mg pantoprazole versus 300 mg ranitidine in
      patients with mild reflux-oesophagitis: a randomized, double-blind, parallel, and
      multicentre study.
PG  - 197-202
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and
      tolerability of low dose pantoprazole (20 mg) (a gastric proton pump inhibitor)
      with standard dose ranitidine (300 mg) (a histamine-receptor antagonist), in
      their ability to relieve symptoms and heal oesophageal lesions associated with
      gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GORD). METHODS: Patients with endoscopically
      established mild GORD (stage I, modified Savary-Miller classification) were
      enrolled into a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group comparison 
      study (intention-to-treat population, n = 201; age range, 18-82 years). Patients 
      took either oral pantoprazole 20 mg in the morning (n = 101) or ranitidine 300 mg
      in the evening (n = 100) once daily for 4 weeks or, if the healing was not
      complete, 8 weeks. Relief from key symptoms (heartburn, acid regurgitation, pain 
      on swallowing) was assessed after 2, 4, and if applicable, 8 weeks. Healing of
      lesions was confirmed endoscopically after 4 and, if applicable, 8 weeks.
      RESULTS: Complete relief from key symptoms was noted after 2 weeks in 70/88 (80%)
      patients treated with pantoprazole vs 45/89 (51%) patients treated with
      ranitidine ('per-protocol and key-point available' populations, P < 0.001); the
      corresponding results after 4 weeks were 77/88 (88%) vs 51/88 (58%) (P < 0.001). 
      Complete healing of lesions after 4 weeks of treatment was seen in 74/88 (84%) vs
      49/89 (55%) in the pantoprazole and ranitidine group, respectively (P < 0.001,
      per-protocol); by week 8 the cumulative healing rates were 84/88 (95%) vs 69/89
      (78%) in the pantoprazole and ranitidine group, respectively (P < 0.001). For the
      intention-to-treat populations, the corresponding values for healing after 4 and 
      8 weeks were 73% vs 49% (P < 0.001) and 83% vs 69% (P < 0.05), respectively. Both
      study medications were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Compared to ranitidine 300 mg,
      the regimen with pantoprazole 20 mg provides faster relief from symptoms and is
      significantly more effective in healing of oesophageal lesions in patients with
      mild reflux-oesophagitis. Thus, the low dose of pantoprazole offers a treatment
      approach which minimizes drug exposure and costs while retaining high efficacy.

TI  - Should noncardiac chest pain be treated empirically? A cost-effectiveness
      analysis.
PG  - 844-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chest pain is a common clinical problem, but up to 30% of patients
      who present with chest pain lack coronary disease. Subsequent investigation often
      reveals an esophageal source for the pain, with gastroesophageal reflux disease
      identified most frequently. Controversy exists regarding whether to establish the
      cause or to empirically treat as reflux. OBJECTIVE: To assess the
      cost-effectiveness of empirical treatment in patients with noncardiac chest pain.
      METHODS: Decision analysis was used to compare a strategy of empirical treatment 
      as reflux using an H-blocker or proton pump inhibitor with initial investigation 
      for gastrointestinal causes over a period of up to 16 weeks and over a period of 
      more than a year. The prototype patient was an outpatient with chest pain and a
      normal coronary angiogram. Gastrointestinal investigations included an upper
      gastrointestinal tract series, endoscopy, manometry, 24-hour pH monitoring, and
      provocation tests. The main outcome measure was direct medical costs per case
      treated from a third-party payer perspective. RESULTS: Total medical costs were
      $2,187 per case treated for the initial investigation arm and $849 for the
      empirical treatment arm in the 8- to 16-week model. One-way sensitivity analyses 
      revealed that the model was robust; the treatment arm was less expensive in all
      cases. At just over a year empirical treatment remained dominant. CONCLUSIONS: An
      initial therapeutic trial with antisecretory agents for patients with noncardiac 
      chest pain is cost-effective compared with investigation for gastrointestinal
      causes in the short term of weeks, with cost savings persisting beyond a year.

      pantoprazole and theophylline at steady state. METHODS: Theophylline 200 mg
      extended-release formulation was administered twice daily on days 1-11 to 30
      healthy, non-smoking males. On days 5-11, 15 subjects received concomitant
      lansoprazole 30 mg once daily (o.d.) and 15 subjects received concomitant
      pantoprazole 40 mg o.d. RESULTS: No significant changes in the steady-state
      theophylline maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), time to Cmax (Tmax), minimum
      plasma concentration (Cmin), area under the plasma concentration-time curve over 
      the 12-h dosing interval (AUC0-12), or apparent total oral clearance (CL/F) were 
      observed within the two treatment groups when theophylline was administered alone
      or in combination with lansoprazole or pantoprazole. In addition, no significant 
      differences in the changes of steady-state theophylline pharmacokinetics from day
      4 to day 11 were noted between the two treatment groups. Treatment with
      theophylline in combination with either lansoprazole or pantoprazole was well
      tolerated. All adverse events were transient and rated mild to moderate in
      severity. CONCLUSION: Co-administration of either lansoprazole or pantoprazole in
      healthy subjects does not significantly affect the steady-state pharmacokinetics 
      of theophylline at the therapeutic doses tested.

TI  - Seven-day triple therapy with ranitidine bismuth citrate or omeprazole and two
      antibiotics for eradication of Helicobacter pylori in duodenal ulcer: a
      multicentre, randomized, single-blind study.
PG  - 325-30
AB  - AIM: To investigate the efficacy of a 1-week triple therapy with amoxycillin,
      clarithromycin, and omeprazole or ranitidine bismuth citrate (RBC) in curing
      Helicobacter pylori infection and healing duodenal ulcers. METHODS: One hundred
      and ninety-two consecutive out-patients with duodenal ulcer, in whom H. pylori
      infection was confirmed by histology and a urease biopsy test, were randomly
      assigned to a 1-week treatment with either 400 mg b.d. ranitidine bismuth citrate
      (RAC group) or 20 mg omeprazole b.d. (OAC group) in combination with 1 g
      amoxycillin b.d. and 500 mg clarithromycin b.d. RESULTS: Eradication of H. pylori
      was successful in 77% (per protocol) and 61% (intention-to-treat) of the patients
      in the RAC group and in 79% (per protocol) and 70% (intention-to-treat) of those 
      in the OAC group. The difference was not significant. Per protocol analysis
      showed ulcers were healed in 97% of patients in the RAC group and 96% in the OAC 
      group. Adverse effects were seen in four patients in each group: they caused
      discontinuation of the therapy in one patient of the OAC group. CONCLUSIONS:
      Eradication rates obtained in this study were lower than those expected on the
      basis of previously reported studies. The two 1-week treatment regimens were
      equally effective in healing H. pylori associated duodenal ulcer disease.

TI  - Effect of ornidazole and clarithromycin resistance on eradication of Helicobacter
      pylori in peptic ulcer disease.
PG  - 305-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clarithromycin and nitroimidazoles such as metronidazole and
      ornidazole are among the most frequently used antibiotics for curing Helicobacter
      pylori infection. However, controversial data exist on whether their in vitro
      resistance has a negative impact on treatment outcome. METHODS: Patients with H. 
      pylori positive active peptic ulcer disease were randomly assigned to receive
      lansoprazole 30 mg o.d., amoxycillin 1 g b.d. and ornidazole 500 mg b.d. (LAO) or
      lansoprazole 30 mg o.d., amoxycillin 1 g b.d. and clarithromycin 500 mg b.d.
      (LAC) for 2 weeks. Pre-treatment resistance to ornidazole and clarithromycin was 
      assessed by Epsilometer (E-) test. Four weeks after completion of treatment,
      patients underwent a 13C urea breath test to assess H. pylori status. RESULTS:
      Data from 80 patients with active peptic ulcer disease and positive H. pylori
      status were analysed. The prevalence of primary drug resistance was 25% for
      metronidazole and 7.5% for clarithromycin. In patients treated with LAO,
      effective treatment was achieved in 87% of metronidazole-susceptible, but only
      30% of metronidazole-resistant strains (P < 0.01). In the LAC group, therapy was 
      successful in 81% of clarithromycin-susceptible strains, whereas treatment failed
      in all patients with primary clarithromycin resistance (n = 3). CONCLUSION:
      Resistance against nitroimidazoles significantly affects treatment outcome in H. 
      pylori eradication therapy.

TI  - Intravenous pantoprazole rapidly controls gastric acid hypersecretion in patients
      with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.
PG  - 696-704
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Parenteral control of gastric acid hypersecretion in
      conditions such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) or idiopathic gastric acid
      hypersecretion is necessary perioperatively or when oral medications cannot be
      taken for other reasons (e.g., during chemotherapy, acute upper gastrointestinal 
      bleeding, or in intensive care unit settings). METHODS: We evaluated the efficacy
      and safety of 15-minute infusions of the proton pump inhibitor pantoprazole
      (80-120 mg every 8-12 hours) in controlling acid output for up to 7 days.
      Effective control was defined as acid output >10 milliequivalents per hour
      (mEq/h) (<5 mEq/h in patients with prior acid-reducing surgery) for 24 hours.
      RESULTS: The 21 patients enrolled had a mean age of 51.9 years (range, 29-75) and
      a mean disease duration of 8.1 years (range, <0.5-21); 13 were male, 7 had
      multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type I, 4 had undergone acid-reducing
      surgery, 2 had received chemotherapy, and 13 had undergone gastrinoma resections 
      without cure. Basal acid output (mean +/- SD) was 40.2 +/- 27.9 mEq/h (range,
      11.2-117.9). In all patients, acid output was controlled within the first hour
      (mean onset of effective control, 41 minutes) after an initial 80-mg intravenous 
      pantoprazole dose. Pantoprazole, 80 mg every 12 hours, was effective in 17 of 21 
      patients (81%) for up to 7 days. Four patients required upward dose titration, 2 
      required 120 mg pantoprazole every 12 hours, and 2 required 80 mg every 8 hours. 
      At study end, acid output remained controlled for 6 hours beyond the next
      expected dose in 71% of patients (n = 15); mean acid output increased to 4.0
      mEq/h (range, 0-9.7). No serious or unexpected adverse events were observed.
      CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous pantoprazole, 160-240 mg/day administered in divided
      doses by 15-minute infusion, rapidly and effectively controlled acid output
      within 1 hour and maintained control for up to 7 days in all ZES patients.

TI  - Long-term omeprazole treatment in resistant gastroesophageal reflux disease:
      efficacy, safety, and influence on gastric mucosa.
PG  - 661-9
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The efficacy and safety of long-term acid suppression remains 
      a subject for debate. We report data from patients with refractory reflux
      esophagitis who were undergoing maintenance therapy with >/=20 mg omeprazole
      daily for a mean period of 6.5 years (range, 1.4-11.2 years). METHODS: Patients
      with severe reflux esophagitis resistant to long-term therapy with H(2)-receptor 
      antagonists and who were not eligible for surgery were evaluated at least
      annually for endoscopic relapse and histological changes in the gastric corpus.
      RESULTS: In 230 patients (mean age, 63 years at entry; 36% were >/=70 years),
      there were 158 relapses of esophagitis during 1490 treatment years (1 per 9.4
      years), with no significant difference in relapse rates between Helicobacter
      pylori-positive and -negative patients. All patients rehealed during continued
      therapy with omeprazole at the same or higher dose. The annual incidence of
      gastric corpus mucosal atrophy was 4.7% and 0.7% in H. pylori-positive and
      -negative patients, respectively, which was mainly observed in elderly patients
      who had moderate/severe gastritis at entry. In patients with baseline
      moderate/severe gastritis, the incidences were similar: 7.9% and 8.4%,
      respectively. Corpus intestinal metaplasia was rare, and no dysplasia or
      neoplasms were observed. The adverse event profile was as might be expected from 
      this elderly group of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term omeprazole therapy (up to 
      11 years) is highly effective and safe for control of reflux esophagitis.

PG  - 20-6
AB  - The assortment of diagnostic tests that are currently available for detecting
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are invasive, costly and not readily
      available to community-based physicians. In contrast, a short course of high-dose
      proton pump inhibitor (PPI) as an empirical trial is an attractive alternative.
      This simple diagnostic test has been demonstrated to be accurate and
      cost-effective in patients with symptoms suggestive of GERD and those with
      noncardiac chest pain. Early studies in patients with extraesophageal
      manifestations of GERD have yielded promising results. Cost assessment of the PPI
      empirical trial revealed significant cost savings, mainly due to a marked
      decrease in utilization of invasive diagnostic tests. Thus the PPI empirical
      trial should be considered as the initial diagnostic step in patients with the
      disease spectrum of GERD.

TI  - Economic evaluation of long-term management strategies for erosive oesophagitis.
PG  - 679-97
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the expected costs and outcomes of alternative strategies
      for the management of patients with erosive oesophagitis. DESIGN: There were 3
      components to the overall analytic approach. First, a decision model was
      constructed to compare expected costs and outcomes of 6 management strategies.
      Second, principles of quantitative literature review and meta-analysis were used 
      to determine probabilities of clinical events (i.e. oesophagitis healing and
      recurrence). Finally, principles of cost-effectiveness analysis were used to
      compare treatment alternatives in terms of dominance and incremental cost
      effectiveness. The viewpoint for the study was that of a provincial government
      payer for healthcare over a 1-year period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS:
      Healing rates were significantly higher for proton pump inhibitors (PPI) [p <
      0.001]. Recurrence rates were significantly higher for intermittent therapy
      (placebo) and lower for regular dose PPI (p < 0.001). Maintenance prokinetic
      agent (PA) is dominated (i.e. more costly and less effective) and step-down
      maintenance PPI is dominated through principles of extended dominance. The
      'efficient frontier' is represented by: maintenance H2-receptor antagonist
      (H2RA), intermittent PPI, step-down maintenance H2RA and maintenance PPI.
      CONCLUSIONS: The price of H2RA is a key factor influencing whether step-down
      maintenance PPI forms part of, or is contained within, the 'efficient frontier'
      of long term management for erosive oesophagitis.

TI  - Oral and intravenous dosage forms of pantoprazole are equivalent in their ability
      to suppress gastric acid secretion in patients with gastroesophageal reflux
      disease.
PG  - 626-33
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the ability of pantoprazole to
      maintain gastric acid suppression in patients with gastroesophageal reflux
      disease who are switched from an oral (p.o.) to an intravenous (i.v.) dosage
      form. METHODS: A total of 65 patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease were
      administered either 40 or 20 mg of p.o. pantoprazole daily for 10 days, then were
      switched to either a matching dose of i.v. pantoprazole or to placebo for 7 days.
      Acid output (basal and maximal) was measured at the end of the p.o. treatment
      period and on the first and last days of i.v. therapy. In the primary efficacy
      analysis, the acid output values at the end of the p.o. pantoprazole treatment
      were compared with those at the end of the i.v. treatment. Safety was monitored
      by periodic vital sign measurements, clinical laboratory evaluations, ophthalmic 
      examinations, electrocardiograms, and reports of adverse events. The data were
      tested by an analysis of covariance and by Wilcoxon signed rank and t tests.
      RESULTS: Maximal acid output (mean +/- SD) in the 40 mg and 20 mg pantoprazole
      group after p.o. treatment was 6.5 +/- 5.6 mEq/h and 14.5 +/- 15.5 mEq/h,
      respectively; whereas, at the end of the i.v. treatment period, the values were
      6.6 +/- 6.3 mEq/h and 11.1 +/- 10.2 mEq/h, respectively. In patients given i.v.
      placebo, acid output was significantly (p < 0.05) increased to 29.2 +/- 13.0
      mEq/h by day 7. Both p.o. and i.v. pantoprazole dosage forms had similar
      favorable safety and tolerability profiles. CONCLUSIONS: The p.o. and i.v.
      formulations of pantoprazole (40 and 20 mg) are equivalent in their ability to
      suppress gastric acid output. The i.v. form of pantoprazole offers an alternative
      for gastroesophageal reflux disease patients who are unable to take the p.o.
      formulation.

TI  - One week triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori associated duodenal ulcer
      disease.
PG  - 738-41
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Eradication of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) cures and prevents
      the relapse of duodenal ulceration. Different treatment regimes for the
      eradication of H. pylori have been used and the most successful eradication
      regimens have been one week treatments with a proton pump inhibitor and two
      antibiotics. AIM OF STUDY: To examine the eradication rate of H. pylori with a
      one week regimen consisting of OCT (Omeprazole 20 mg BD, Clarithromycin 250 mg
      BD, Tinidazole 500 mg BD). This treatment regimen has been used for H. pylori
      eradication in our department since the end of 1996. METHODS: Patients diagnosed 
      to have duodenal ulcer in 1997 were retrospectively reviewed. Infection with H.
      pylori must be documented either by gastric biopsy or by a positive CLO test.
      Eradication of H. pylori was confirmed by negative 14C urea breath test or by
      histology at least four weeks after cessation of therapy. RESULTS: The review was
      performed on 251 patients. There were 177 males, 74 females. The median age was
      51 (18-77) years. H. pylori infection was confirmed by CLO test in 170 patients
      and by histology in 72 patients. Thirty patients did not undergo further
      investigation after therapy to confirm the eradication. Of the remaining 221
      patients, H. pylori was successfully eradicated in 198 patients (89.6%) as
      confirmed by 14C urea breath test (190 patients) or repeat gastroscopy and
      gastric biopsy (31 patients). There were no serious adverse events documented.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our retrospective study showed that the one week regimen used in our
      department is effective for the eradication of H. pylon in nearly 90% of infected
      cases.

TI  - Lack of interaction between lansoprazole and propranolol, a pharmacokinetic and
      safety assessment.
PG  - 301-8
AB  - Due to the prevalence of both gastrointestinal and cardiovascular diseases, it is
      likely that patients may be coprescribed gastric parietal cell proton pump
      inhibitors and beta-adrenergic antagonists. Therefore, the objectives of this
      phase I study were to assess the potential effects of the coadministration of
      lansoprazole on the pharmacokinetics of propranolol and to evaluate the safety of
      propranolol with concomitant lansoprazole dosing. In a double-blind fashion, 18
      healthy male nonsmokers were initially randomized to receive either 60 mg oral
      lansoprazole, each morning for 7 days, or an identical placebo (period 1). On day
      7, all subjects were concomitantly administered oral propranolol, 80 mg. After a 
      minimum of 1 week following the last dose of either lansoprazole or placebo,
      subjects were crossed over to the opposite treatment for another 7 days (period
      2). Subjects were again administered oral propranolol on day 7. During both
      treatment periods, blood samples for the determination of plasma propranolol and 
      4-hydroxy-propranolol were obtained just before the dose and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 
      6, 8 12, 16, 20, and 24 hours postdose. Plasma propranolol and
      4-hydroxy-propranolol concentrations were determined by using HPLC with
      fluorescence detection. The Cmax, tmax, AUC0-infinity, and t1/2 values for
      propranolol, as well as the AUC0-infinity for 4-hydroxy-propranolol, were
      calculated and compared between the lansoprazole and placebo regimens. The mean
      age of the 15 subjects who successfully completed the study was 31 years (range: 
      24-38 years), and their average weight was 174.8 pounds (range: 145-203 pounds). 
      There were no statistically significant differences between the lansoprazole and 
      placebo regimens for the propranolol Cmax, tmax, AUC0-infinity, and t1/2 values. 
      Also, there were no statistically significant differences between regimens for
      the 4-OH-propranolol AUC0-infinity. Safety evaluations, which included adverse
      events, vital signs, clinical laboratory determinations, ECG, and physical
      examinations, revealed no unexpected clinically significant findings and did not 
      suggest a drug-drug interaction. In conclusion, lansoprazole does not
      significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of propranolol, suggesting that it does 
      not interact with the CYP2D6- or CYP2C19-mediated metabolism of propranolol.
      Modification of a propranolol dosage regimen in the presence of lansoprazole is
      not indicated, based on the pharmacokinetic analysis and the lack of a clinically
      significant alteration in the pharmacodynamic response.

PG  - 79-82
AB  - Pantoprazole is a new proton pump inhibitor with a potent antisecretory activity,
      well defined pharmacokinetics and safety profile. The aim of this single blind,
      randomized clinical trial was to compare the efficacy of pantoprazole (PAN) 40
      mg/day and omeprazole (OME) 20 mg/day in patients with grade I and II GERD
      (Savary-Miller classification). A total of 120 patients were included (PAN = 60
      and OME = 60). In the per protocol/analysis, healing rates at 4 weeks were 76.3% 
      PAN and 71.2% OME (ns), and at 8 weeks 94.7% PAN and 92.9% OME (ns). In the
      intention to treat analysis, healing rates at 4 weeks were 75% PAN and 70% OME
      (ns), and at 8 weeks 90% PAN and 86.6% OME (ns). Both pantoprazole and omeprazole
      were well tolerated with no serious drug related adverse events. Pantoprazole 40 
      mg/day was found to be safe and effective therapy comparable to omeprazole 20
      mg/day in the short-term treatment for reflux esophagitis (grade I and II).

AB  - Once again this year, developments in the field of ulcers and gastritis have been
      entirely dominated by findings relating to Helicobacter pylori. However, interest
      in H. pylori can be expected to decline, since the prevalence of the infection is
      rapidly decreasing in the developing world - to the point that many
      gastroduodenal ulcers are now unrelated to H. pylori A further reason for
      declining interest is disappointment regarding the role of H. pylori in
      dyspepsia. The expected reduction in the endoscopic workload produced by
      screening for H. pylori or cagA positivity has so far not occurred. The exact
      role of the damage caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in H.
      pylori-infected stomachs remains controversial. Equally controversial is the
      magnitude of the increased reflux symptomatology and reflux disease observed
      after H. pylori infection has been cured in patients with ulcer disease.
      Eradication therapy is largely dominated by proton-pump inhibitor triple
      therapies, although the efficacy of these is declining. Bismuth triple therapy
      and quadruple therapy continue to be valid alternatives.

TI  - Reflux disease and Barrett's esophagus.
PG  - 101-7
AB  - Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is still an important clinical problem.
      Continuing efforts are being made to establish a classification of the condition 
      that would allow improved communications for both clinical and research purposes.
      In medical treatment, the trends are toward proton-pump inhibitor therapy at all 
      stages of GERD, calling into question the role of endoscopy for tailoring
      individual therapy. Arguments against the use of H. pylori eradication therapy in
      GERD have gained importance. Surgeons are continuing to report excellent results 
      with fundoplication, but careful studies are needed to prove whether antireflux
      surgery is really capable of saving costs, as its proponents claim. Barrett's
      esophagus is still a topic of lively interest. Since there is no method of
      primary prevention, endoscopy has a crucial role in detecting affected patients
      and guiding them toward one of the various surveillance strategies--which are not
      yet clearly established. The debate over short-segment Barrett's esophagus, and
      especially over "microscopic" Barrett's esophagus (at the squamocolumnar
      junction), has not yet been resolved. However, there is now less doubt that GERD 
      is a condition associated with a substantially higher risk for the development of
      esophageal adenocarcinoma. Given this risk of malignant transformation, there is 
      continuing competition between different ablation techniques; however, careful
      data from much larger populations will be needed before ablation reaches the
      stage of broad clinical application. Until specific guidelines become available, 
      patients with Barrett's esophagus should receive endoscopic follow-up until it
      can be ascertained which individuals are at risk for cancer and require ablation 
      of Barrett's mucosa.

PG  - 893-904, vii
AB  - Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is one of the mos common disorders of the 
      gastrointestinal tract. Patients with GERD symptoms may exhibit a spectrum of
      endoscopic findings ranging from normal endoscopy (EGD negative) to severe
      ulcerative esophagitis. Recent evidence indicates that a large proportion of
      patients with GERD have normal endoscopy. The use of 24-hour ambulatory pH
      testing in the evaluation of symptomatic patients with EGD negative GERD allows
      further classification of these subjects into groups. Patients who have abnormal 
      acid exposure and a positive symptom index constitute one group and patients who 
      have normal acid contact time but record a convincing relationship between their 
      symptoms and acid reflux on the pH analysis--positive symptom index--form another
      group. The latter group has been suggested to have a hypersensitive esophagus or 
      "functional heartburn." This article reviews the prevalence, clinical features,
      origin of patient's symptoms, natural history, and treatment of patients with EGD
      negative GERD.

TI  - Peptic strictures of the esophagus.
PG  - 875-91, vi
AB  - Peptic esophageal strictures occur in the context of inadequately treated
      gastroesophageal reflux, especially in elderly patients. Studies show more
      pronounced abnormalities of esophageal function resulting in an increased number 
      of prolonged reflux episodes. The diagnosis is best made by a combination of
      barium esophagram and endoscopy. Patients usually require esophageal dilation to 
      relieve dysphagia followed by adequate medical therapy. Proton pump inhibitors
      are effective for preventing the recurrence of strictures after dilation. In
      young patients and patients with strictures that are difficult to dilate or need 
      frequent dilations, surgery may be required; however, results can be
      disappointing.

TI  - Does the eradication of Helicobacter pylori cure duodenal ulcer disease in
      communities with a high prevalence rate? Comparison with long-term acid
      suppression.
PG  - 505-8
AB  - The long-term effect of Helicobacter pylori eradication on the natural history of
      duodenal ulcer has been investigated and compared with long-term acid suppression
      treatment in an endemic community for infection. Seventy-three patients with
      endoscopically verified H. pylori positive active duodenal ulcer disease were
      included in this prospective study. Patients were divided into two groups. Group 
      A patients (n = 39) were given an omeprazole-based triple eradication regimen,
      while group B patients (n = 34) were given omeprazole alone followed by long-term
      famotidine 20 mg daily as maintenance treatment. A control endoscopy was
      performed at the third month of treatment. The bacterium was eradicated in 32
      (82%) of group A patients. All patients were followed up for two years and an
      endoscopy performed at the end of each year. H. pylori recurred in 13 patients
      and the reinfection rate was 44.8% over two years. Duodenal ulcer recurred in
      seven of these patients at two years (24.1%). There was a close association
      between H. pylori reinfection and ulcer relapse. Group B patients remained H.
      pylori positive during the study and the ulcer recurred in five of these patients
      (6.6%) despite continuous famotidine treatment. There was no statistically
      significant difference in ulcer relapse rate between the groups. These results
      suggested that H. pylori eradication is not an absolute solution for duodenal
      ulcer disease in high endemic regions and continuous maintenance treatment with
      H2-receptor antagonists is still an alternative approach in some chronic
      recurrent cases.

TI  - Introduction of proton pump inhibitors--consequences for surgical treatment of
      peptic ulcer.
PG  - 285-90
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: This retrospective study analyzes the influence of different
      factors on morbidity and mortality after surgical treatment of peptic ulcer.
      METHODOLOGY: At the Municipal Hospital of Offenbach, Germany, from 1985-1996, 485
      patients underwent surgery. RESULTS: Of the 485 patients, 70.7% (343) were
      diagnosed to have duodenal ulcer and 29.2% (142) had suffered from gastric ulcer.
      During this period, 79.2% (384) of the operations were performed under emergency 
      conditions because of acute complications (56% of these with perforation, 20%
      with penetration, 24% with ulcer bleeding), whereas the rest was done electively.
      Two hundred and ninety-one (60%) patients were male, the average age was 59 years
      and 71.7% (348) of the patients had certain concomitant diseases. We observed
      complications in 48% of the cases with a total postoperative mortality of 21%.
      CONCLUSIONS: Between 1985 and 1996 the total number of ulcer surgeries performed 
      at the Municipal Hospital Offenbach per year has stayed almost constant. However,
      a definite increase of acute operations in addition to a decrease of elective
      interventions was noticed. The dissatisfying results of surgical treatment of
      peptic ulcer after the introduction of proton pump inhibitors seems to be the
      consequence of the negative selection of patients mentioned above. A connection
      could be proved between the age and condition of the patient, the type of the
      surgical intervention (acute or elective) and the morbidity and mortality after
      the surgery.

      adenocarcinoma.
PG  - 387-94
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to prospectively determine the prevalence of
      gastric H. pylori infection in Barrett's esophagus and Barrett's complicated by
      dysplasia or adenocarcinoma. METHODS: The prevalence of H. pylori was determined 
      in Barrett's esophagus patients compared to a control population of patients with
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) only. All patients had a minimum of 10
      gastric surveillance biopsies obtained. H. pylori colonization was determined
      upon the basis of hematoxylin and eosin and use of a modified Giemsa and or
      Steiner's silver stain of all gastric biopsy specimens. RESULTS: Two hundred and 
      eighty-nine Barrett's patients and 217 GERD control patients were included in the
      study. H. pylori was found in 95/289 (32.9%) of the Barrett's patients, compared 
      with 96/217 (44.2%) of the GERD controls (NS). Forty-seven of the Barrett's
      patients had low-grade dysplasia/indefinite dysplasia, 14 high-grade dysplasia,
      and 20 Barrett's adenocarcinoma. When Barrett's was subgrouped according to
      absence of dysplasia, and presence of low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia, 
      or adenocarcinoma, H. pylori prevalence was found to be significantly less for
      patients with Barrett's high-grade dysplasia (14.3%) and adenocarcinoma (15.0%)
      versus patients with GERD alone (44.2%), Barrett's alone (35.1%), or Barrett's
      with low-grade dysplasia (36.2%) (p = 0.016). This difference could not be
      explained by differences between Barrett's esophagus patients infected with H.
      pylori and those who were not with respect to gender, smoking history, alcohol
      consumption, use of proton pump inhibitor, or length of Barrett's mucosa.
      CONCLUSIONS: Barrett's high-grade dysplasia and adenocarcinoma are significantly 
      more prevalent in patients who are not infected with H. pylori. H. pylori appears
      to have a protective effect against the development of Barrett's adenocarcinoma.

TI  - Ultrasonographic evaluation of lansoprazole-induced improvement of submucosal

PG  - 381-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Endoscopic ultrasonographic (EUS) changes in gastroesophageal reflux
      disease (GERD) after treatment with proton pump inhibitor have been poorly
      evaluated. We conducted a randomized, double-blind 12-wk clinical trial to
      compare the EUS effects of lansoprazole to histamine H2-receptor antagonist
      therapy in GERD. METHODS: Seventeen patients with reflux-related symptoms
      received 40 mg of famotidine for 6 wk or 30 mg of lansoprazole for 6 wk followed 
      by 40 mg of famotidine or 30 mg of lansoprazole for another 6 wk, respectively.
      Patients underwent EUS before and at 6 and 12 wk after treatment. RESULTS: Before
      treatment, a variable degree of wall thickening was noted on EUS in the lower
      esophagus, compared with 20 normal subjects. After 6 wk of therapy, esophageal
      wall was significantly thicker in the famotidine group compared with the
      lansoprazole group (p<0.01). Surprisingly, thickening of esophageal wall and
      abnormal architecture were also detected in endoscopically negative reflux
      disease. Lansoprazole was superior to famotidine in reducing the thickness of
      esophageal wall. CONCLUSIONS: EUS was very useful for evaluation of submucosal
      injury in patients with GERD. EUS showed that a 6-wk course of lansoprazole
      therapy reduced thickening of esophageal wall, which was resistant to histamine
      H2-receptor antagonist therapy. Our results also suggest that inflammatory damage
      to the submucosal and muscle layers of the lower esophagus is the underlying
      mechanism of heartburn and associated symptoms in patients with endoscopically
      negative reflux disease.

TI  - Selection of patients for successful maintenance treatment of esophagitis with
      low-dose omeprazole: use of 24-hour gastric pH monitoring.
PG  - 374-80
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Treating patients with erosive esophagitis and maintaining remission
      in a cost-effective fashion is a desirable goal in clinical practice. There are
      no established criteria to identify patients with healed esophagitis who will
      subsequently remain in remission with low-dose omeprazole therapy. We
      investigated whether 24-h esophageal-gastric pH monitoring could provide criteria
      to select patients for low-dose omeprazole maintenance therapy. METHODS: Seventy 
      consecutive symptomatic outpatients with grade 2-3 reflux esophagitis were
      prospectively investigated. They were treated with 20 mg/day omeprazole for 2
      months. Those with healed esophagitis were given alternate-evening 20-mg
      omeprazole maintenance therapy for 6 months. Clinical evaluation, endoscopy, and 
      24-h esophageal-gastric pH were done at the end of each treatment period. Results
      of pH studies of patients in remission were compared with those with
      endoscopically documented relapse of esophagitis. RESULTS: In 63/70 patient
      (intention-to-treat, 90%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 83-97%) esophagitis was
      healed at 2 months. During the 6-month maintenance period esophagitis remain
      healed in 28 (G1) (40%; 95% CI, 29-52%), but recurred in 32 patients (G2). During
      healing with omeprazole 20 mg/day the 24-h gastric pH was below 4 for <10% of the
      time in 96% of the patients, who subsequently remained in long-term remission
      with low-dose maintenance therapy (G1), but not in any patient with recurrence of
      esophagitis (G2). The 10% threshold value has a specificity of 1.00 and
      sensitivity of 0.96. CONCLUSIONS: The 24-h intragastric pH monitoring during 20
      mg/day omeprazole therapy provides criteria by which to preselect patients with
      reflux esophagitis who will remain in remission with low-dose omeprazole therapy.

TI  - Treatments of peptic ulcer.
PG  - 63-7
AB  - From the late 19th century, Mount Sinai gastroenterologists declared their
      scepticism of the efficacy of all recommended treatments of peptic ulcer, and
      looked forward to trials which could distinguish between sequence and
      consequence, between association and causation. The rationale of all the early
      studies was to reduce gastric acidity, but it soon became clear that any
      neutralization by single doses of antacids was brief and ineffective. Winkelstein
      s demonstration that patients with duodenal ulcer had higher acidities not only
      before and after meals but also through the night hours led him to introduce a
      new treatment, the alkalinized intragastric milk drip together with atropine. One
      of the earliest controlled clinical trials at Mount Sinai compared different
      antacid regimes and showed that pH values above 3.5 were achieved in only about
      half of the patients on the various drips. When the new anticholinergic drugs
      were developed in the 1950s, they were found to produce sustained hypoacidity and
      were tried as maintenance treatment, as an alternative to acid-lowering
      operations. The third Mount Sinai approach was to attack the machinery of the
      acid-producing cell itself by an inhibitor of the enzyme producing hydrogen ions.
      In 1939, this enzyme had been thought to be carbonic anhydrase, but when Janowitz
      and Hollander tested its inhibitor, acetazolamide, and showed marked but very
      brief acid inhibition, they concluded that its action was too brief to be
      therapeutically useful. The problem was to be solved decades later by H2 receptor
      blockers from Britain and H+K+ATPase inhibitors from Sweden.

TI  - Effect of laparoscopic fundoplication on gastroesophageal reflux disease-induced 
      respiratory symptoms.
PG  - 143-9
AB  - Laparoscopic fundoplication controls heartburn and regurgitation, but the effects
      on the respiratory symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are
      unclear. Confusion stems from difficulty preoperatively in determining whether
      cough or wheezing is actually caused by reflux when reflux is found on pH
      monitoring. To date, there is no proven way to pinpoint a cause-and-effect
      relationship. The goals of this study were to assess the following: (1) the value
      of pH monitoring in establishing a correlation between respiratory symptoms and
      reflux; (2) the predictive value of pH monitoring on the results of surgical
      treatment; and (3) the outcome of laparoscopic fundoplication on GERD-induced
      respiratory symptoms. Between October 1992 and October 1998, a total of 340
      patients underwent laparoscopic fundoplication for GERD. From the clinical
      findings alone, respiratory symptoms were thought possibly to be caused by GERD
      in 39 patients (11%). These 39 patients had been symptomatic for an average of
      134 months. They were all taking H2-blocking agents (21%) or proton pump
      inhibitors (79%). Seven patients (18%) were also being treated with
      bronchodilators, alone (3 patients) or in combination with prednisone (4
      patients). Median length of postoperative follow-up was 28 months. In 23 patients
      (59%) a temporal correlation was found during 24-hour pH monitoring between
      respiratory symptoms and episodes of reflux. Postoperatively heartburn resolved
      in 91% of patients, regurgitation in 90% of patients, wheezing in 64% of
      patients, and cough in 74% of patients. Cough resolved in 19 (83%) of 23 patients
      in whom a correlation between cough and reflux was found during pH monitoring,
      but in only 8 (57%) of 14 of patients when this correlation was absent. Cough
      persisted postoperatively in the two patients who did not cough during the study.
      These data show that pH monitoring helped to establish a correlation between
      respiratory symptoms and reflux, and it helped to identify the patients most
      likely to benefit from antireflux surgery. Following laparoscopic surgery,
      respiratory symptoms resolved in 83% of patients when a temporal correlation
      between cough and reflux was found on pH monitoring; heartburn and regurgitation 
      resolved in 90%.

TI  - Gastroesophageal reflux disease in asthma: effects of medical and surgical
      antireflux therapy on asthma control.
PG  - 161-72
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To critique the English-language reports describing the effects of
      medical and surgical antireflux therapy on respiratory symptoms and function in
      patients with asthma. METHODS: The Medline computerized database (1959-1999) was 
      searched, and all publications relating to both asthma and gastroesophageal
      reflux disease were retrieved. RESULTS: Seven of nine trials of
      histamine-receptor antagonists showed a treatment-related improvement in asthma
      symptoms, with half of the patients benefiting. Only one study identified a
      beneficial effect on objective measures of pulmonary function. Three of six
      trials of proton pump inhibitors documented improvement in asthma symptoms with
      treatment; benefit was seen in 25% of patients. Half of the studies reported
      improvement in pulmonary function, but the effect occurred in fewer than 15% of
      patients. In the one study that used optimal antisecretory therapy, asthma
      symptoms were improved in 67% of patients and pulmonary function was improved in 
      20%. Combined data from 5 pediatric and 14 adult studies of anti-reflux surgery
      indicated that almost 90% of children and 70% of adults had improvement in
      respiratory symptoms, with approximately one third experiencing improvements in
      objective measures of pulmonary function. CONCLUSIONS: Fundoplication has been
      consistently shown to ameliorate reflux-induced asthma; results are superior to
      the published results of antisecretory therapy. Optimal medical therapy may offer
      similar results, but large studies providing support for this assertion are
      lacking.

TI  - Eradication of Helicobacter pylori prevents recurrence of ulcer after simple
      closure of duodenal ulcer perforation: randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 153-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this randomized trial, the authors sought to determine whether
      eradication of Helicobacter pylori could reduce the risk of ulcer recurrence
      after simple closure of perforated duodenal ulcer. BACKGROUND DATA: Immediate
      acid-reduction surgery has been strongly advocated for perforated duodenal ulcers
      because of the high incidence of ulcer relapse after simple patch repair.
      Although H. pylori eradication is now the standard treatment of uncomplicated and
      bleeding peptic ulcers, its role in perforation remains controversial. Recently a
      high prevalence of H. pylori infection has been reported in patients with
      perforations of duodenal ulcer. It is unclear whether eradication of the
      bacterium confers prolonged ulcer remission after simple repair and hence
      obviates the need for an immediate definitive operation. METHODS: Of 129 patients
      with perforated duodenal ulcers, 104 (81%) were shown to be infected by H.
      pylori. Ninety-nine H. pylori-positive patients were randomized to receive either
      a course of quadruple anti-helicobacter therapy or a 4-week course of omeprazole 
      alone. Follow-up endoscopy was performed 8 weeks, 16 weeks (if the ulcer did not 
      heal at 8 weeks), and 1 year after hospital discharge for surveillance of ulcer
      healing and determination of H. pylori status. The endpoints were initial ulcer
      healing and ulcer relapse rate after 1 year. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients were
      assigned to the anti-Helicobacter therapy and 48 to omeprazole alone. Nine
      patients did not undergo the first follow-up endoscopy. Of the 90 patients who
      did undergo follow-up endoscopy, 43 of the 44 patients in the anti-Helicobacter
      group and 8 of the 46 in the omeprazole alone group had H. pylori eradicated;
      initial ulcer healing rates were similar in the two groups (82% vs. 87%). After 1
      year, ulcer relapse was significantly less common in patients treated with
      anti-Helicobacter therapy than in those who received omeprazole alone (4.8% vs.
      38.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Eradication of H. pylori prevents ulcer recurrence in
      patients with H. pylori-associated perforated duodenal ulcers. Immediate
      acid-reduction surgery in the presence of generalized peritonitis is unnecessary.

TI  - Importance of Helicobacter pylori cagA and vacA status for the efficacy of
      antibiotic treatment.
PG  - 321-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Virulence factors of Helicobacter pylori are associated with peptic
      ulcer disease and may be also associated with the efficacy of treatment. AIMS: To
      determine the relation between the vacA and the cagA status of H pylori, clinical
      disease, and treatment outcome. PATIENTS: 121 patients with H pylori infection
      and peptic ulcer disease or functional dyspepsia were treated by quadruple
      antibiotic therapy in two groups for one and two days, respectively. METHODS: DNA
      was isolated from gastric antral biopsy specimens, taken before and after
      treatment, and the vacA and cagA status was determined by polymerase chain
      reaction and reverse hybridisation. RESULTS: Peptic ulcer disease was
      significantly associated with the vacA s1 type, and cagA positivity, but not with
      the vacA m type. Treatment efficacy was significantly higher in patients with
      peptic ulcer disease, or infected with cagA+/vacA s1 strains. CONCLUSIONS: The
      strong association between the cagA and vacA status and peptic ulcer disease was 
      confirmed. Cure rates seem to be higher for patients with cagA+/vacA s1 H pylori 
      strains, which is consistent with the higher cure rate observed among ulcer
      patients compared with functional dyspepsia patients. Therefore, treatment
      studies may require stratification for presence of ulcers as well as H pylori
      genotypes.

TI  - Four-day, twice daily, quadruple therapy with amoxicillin, clarithromycin,
      tinidazole and omeprazole to cure Helicobacter pylori infection: a pilot study.
PG  - 52-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: The best regimen for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection
      has yet to be defined. Four-day quadruple therapy with tetracycline,
      metronidazole, bismuth, and a proton pump inhibitor has been shown to obtain a
      very high cure rate. However, the fact that it must be taken four times daily may
      interfere with compliance. The objective of the study was to test the efficacy
      and tolerability of a new 4-day therapy with 4 drugs taken every 12 hours to cure
      H. pylori infection. Patients and Methods. Fifty-six consecutive patients with
      peptic ulcer disease and H. pylori infection were treated with an oral 4-day
      course with omeprazole (20 mg/12 hours), clarithromycin (500 mg/12 hours),
      amoxicillin (1 g/12 hours) and tinidazole (500 mg/12 hours). Efficacy of the
      treatment was determined at least 2 months after therapy either by biopsy (in the
      case of gastric ulcer) or by 13C-urea breath test. A second breath test was
      performed at least 6 months after therapy. RESULTS: Two patients were lost to
      follow-up. Forty-nine of the remaining 54 patients were cured at the first
      control [intention-to-treat cure rate: 87.5% (CI 95% 75-94%); per protocol cure
      rate: 90.7% (CI 95% 81-98%)]. Forty-three of these 49 cured patients returned for
      a second 13C urea breath-test at 6-12 months. Two of them were not cured, giving 
      a long-term cure rate of 85.5% per protocol and 73.2% by intention-to-treat.
      Compliance was good, although 25 patients had mild side effects. CONCLUSION: This
      particular four-day therapy is well tolerated, easy to follow, and achieves an
      acceptably high cure rate.

TI  - Eradication of H. pylori with pantoprazole, clarithromycin, and metronidazole in 
      duodenal ulcer patients: a head-to-head comparison between two regimens of
      different duration.
PG  - 41-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: The study was conducted to compare the efficacy and tolerability of
      two pantoprazole-based triple therapies of different length in the eradication of
      H. pylori. METHODS: In this double-blind, multicenter parallel group comparison, 
      H. pylori-positive patients were randomly assigned to either the PCM-7 group (7
      days of pantoprazole 40 mg bid, clarithromycin 500 mg bid, metronidazole 500 mg
      bid) or the PCM-14 m group (modified 14 day therapy of the same regimen with
      metronidazole only given for 10 days due to labeling reasons). H. pylori status
      was determined by urease test, histology, culture, and 13C-urea breath test.
      Treatment outcome was assessed 6 weeks after intake of the last study medication.
      RESULTS: The following eradication rates were achieved: for PCM-7 in the MITT
      population 83% (89/107), in the PP population 84% (81/97); for PCM-14 m in MITT
      87% (92/106), in PP 88% (91/104). Ulcer healing rates were: for PCM-7 in MITT
      population 99% (106/107), in the PP population 99% (96/97); for PCM-14 m in MITT 
      99% (105/106), in PP 99% (103/104). Gastrointestinal symptoms and gastritis
      scores decreased in both treatment groups. Equivalence of treatment regimens
      could be proven for all populations. In total, 64 patients reported adverse
      events. Five serious adverse events occurred, all unrelated to the study
      medication. CONCLUSION: The two pantoprazole-based triple therapies tested in
      this study are equally effective in H. pylori eradication, ulcer healing and
      relief from ulcer pain. It is concluded that 7 days of triple therapy are
      generally sufficient.

TI  - Effect of Helicobacter pylori eradication on peptic ulcer disease complicated
      with outlet obstruction.
PG  - 38-40
AB  - BACKGROUND: At present, the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) in
      complicated peptic ulcer and the effect of H. pylori eradication on complicated
      peptic ulcer have not been fully established. In this study, we report the
      prevalence of H. pylori in peptic ulcer patients complicated with gastric outlet 
      obstruction, effectiveness of oral eradication therapy on these patients, and
      their long-term follow up. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten consecutive patients
      presenting with clinically and endoscopically significant obstructed peptic
      ulcers were included in this study. During each endoscopy, seven gastric biopsy
      specimens were obtained and analyzed for H. pylori colonization. RESULTS: The
      antral mucosal biopsy specimens were positive for H. pylori in nine patients. H. 
      pylori infection was eradicated and complete ulcer healing was observed in all
      patients. The mean follow-up period was 14 (7-24) months. One patient had
      duodenal perforation and underwent surgical intervention following medical
      treatment, despite the eradication of H. pylori. Ulcer recurrence was noted in
      two (22.2%) of nine patients, and in one of them the recurrent ulcer was
      complicated with obstruction (11. 1%). The mean time to ulcer recurrence was 17
      months (range, 10-24 months). The biopsies and CLOtests were H. pylori negative
      at the time of ulcer or erosion recurrence in two patients. CONCLUSION: We
      suggest that H. pylori eradication may improve the resolution in obstructive
      ulcer cases with colonization.

TI  - Evaluation of omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, and rabeprazole in the
      treatment of acid-related diseases.
PG  - 52-62; quiz 121-3
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the comparative efficacy and safety of the proton pump
      inhibitors (PPIs)--omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, and rabeprazole--in
      the management of acid-related diseases. DATA SOURCES: English-language journal
      articles retrieved from a MEDLINE search from 1990 to the present using these
      index terms: proton pump inhibitors, omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole,
      rebeprazole, and each of the acid-related diseases. STUDY SELECTION: Clinical
      trials and pertinent review articles that discussed the pharmacology,
      pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of PPIs in the management of acid-related 
      disease. DATA EXTRACTION: By the authors. DATA SYNTHESIS: PPIs are substituted
      benzimidazoles that inhibit gastric acid secretion by covalently binding to the
      proton pump (H+/K+ ATPase). All undergo extensive hepatic metabolism and
      conjugation. The four agents differ in their metabolism by and effects on
      specific hepatic enzymes and thus in their ability to interact with other
      medications. PPIs are important agents used for eradicating Helicobacter pylori, 
      in treating peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease,
      Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and for
      preventing acid aspiration. Short-term side effects of the four agents are
      similar. The long-term safety of pantoprazole and rabeprazole appears similar to 
      that of omeprazole and lansoprazole. Pantoprazole, which is in the final stages
      of approval for marketing in the United States, will be available in both an oral
      and injectable formulation. CONCLUSION: Based on superior efficacy profiles, PPIs
      are the drugs of choice in managing patients with peptic ulcer disease,
      gastroesophageal reflux disease, and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. The decision to 
      select one PPI versus another is most likely to be based on the agents'
      acquisition costs, formulations, FDA-labeled indications, and overall safety
      profiles. Intravenous or parenteral pantoprazole may become the preferred
      antisecretory agent for patients unable to take oral medications (e.g.,
      critically ill patients and those with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome).

TI  - Cost effectiveness of omeprazole and ranitidine in intermittent treatment of
      symptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 483-97
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This 1-year study compared the cost effectiveness of omeprazole and
      ranitidine when used as initial therapy in an intermittent treatment strategy for
      the management of patients with symptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux disease
      with or without erosive oesophagitis. DESIGN AND SETTING: A prospective health
      economic analysis was conducted alongside an international multicentre
      randomised, double-blind clinical study. The economic analysis was performed from
      a societal perspective. PATIENTS: A total of 704 patients in the UK, the Republic
      of Ireland, Germany, France, Italy and Spain were randomised to 1 of the 3
      treatment groups. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomised to receive either
      omeprazole 20 mg once daily, omeprazole 10 mg once daily or ranitidine 150 mg
      twice daily. Initial treatment failure resulted in dose titration and drug
      switching from ranitidine to omeprazole, and subsequently open maintenance
      treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS: The estimated mean direct medical
      costs (medication and number of visits and endoscopies) were found to be lower
      for both dosages of omeprazole than for ranitidine in all countries except
      Germany. However, none of the differences were statistically significant. The
      differences between omeprazole 10 mg and omeprazole 20 mg were small and
      nonsignificant. With regard to numbers of symptom-free days, both omeprazole 20
      mg and omeprazole 10 mg were found to be more effective than ranitidine. However,
      none of the differences were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Following a 
      pragmatic interpretation, incorporating intermediate short term results, the
      results in this study give no support to the notion that a step-up approach,
      either as dose titration from omeprazole 10 mg to omeprazole 20 mg or as drug
      switching from ranitidine to omeprazole, will result in cost savings and thereby 
      be cost effective.

PG  - 463-7
AB  - PURPOSE: Anticancer drugs may induce acute mucosal injury to stomach and
      duodenum. This study was planned to evaluate the efficacy of omeprazole or
      ranitidine in preventing such an injury. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred
      twenty-eight cancer patients with normal stomach and duodenum or with less than
      three erosions, who were selected to be treated with cyclophosphamide,
      methotrexate, and fluorouracil (90 breast carcinoma patients) or fluorouracil
      alone (138 colon carcinoma patients), were randomly assigned to treatment with
      omeprazole 20 mg, ranitidine 300 mg, or one placebo tablet a day. Seven days
      after the second course of chemotherapy (CT), the patients underwent a further
      esophagogastroduodenoscopy to evaluate the mucosal injury. Endoscopic findings
      were quantified on the basis of an arbitrary score, and the occurrence of
      epigastric pain or heartburn was assessed weekly. RESULTS: A significant
      difference was found among the three groups (P =.0032), as well as between pre-
      and postCT endoscopic findings (P =.00001). Endoscopic scores after CT were
      significantly higher than pretreatment scores in the placebo (P =.003) and
      ranitidine (P =.003) groups but not in the omeprazole group (P =.354). Acute
      ulcers were significantly less frequent in patients receiving omeprazole or
      ranitidine than in those receiving placebo (P =.0001 and P =.0315, respectively).
      Epigastric pain and/or heartburn were significantly less frequent in patients
      receiving omeprazole (P =.00124) or ranitidine (P =.038) than in those receiving 
      placebo. CONCLUSION: Omeprazole is effective in preventing chemotherapy-induced
      gastroduodenal injury. Ranitidine is effective in reducing the frequency of
      ulcers and upper gastrointestinal symptoms but is not effective in preventing the
      global endoscopic worsening caused by chemotherapy. The different efficacy of
      omeprazole and ranitidine can be explained by their different pharmacodynamics.

TI  - Triple therapy in the eradication of Helicobacter pylori in patients with
      duodenal ulcer disease: results of a multicentre study in South-East Asia.
      South-East Asia Multicenter Study Group.
PG  - 225-31
AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of proton pump inhibitor based triple therapy in
      patients from South-East Asia, where metronidazole resistance is reportedly high,
      has not been formally assessed in randomized, multicentre trials. AIM: To compare
      the eradication rates of Helicobacter pylori, ulcer healing rates and
      side-effects of three regimens of omeprazole triple therapy in patients with
      duodenal ulcer from South-East Asia and to study the impact of metronidazole
      resistance. METHODS: A single blind, randomized parallel group, comparative
      multicentre study. A total of 246 patients from 15 centres in four South-East
      Asian countries were randomized to receive OAC (omeprazole 20 mg b.d.,
      amoxycillin 1 g b. d., clarithromycin 500 mg b.d.), OAM (omeprazole 20 mg b.d.,
      amoxycillin 1 g b.d., metronidazole 400 mg b.d.) or OMC (omeprazole 20 mg b.d.,
      metronidazole 400 mg b.d., clarithromycin 500 mg b.d.) for 7 days. After triple
      therapy, the patients were further randomized to receive either omeprazole or
      placebo for 7 days. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed before
      treatment and 4 weeks after treatment. Biopsies for culture and for
      histopathological examination for H. pylori were taken from corpus and antrum
      before treatment and 4 weeks after treatment. RESULTS: The eradication rates were
      intention-to-treat/per protocol (95% CI): OAC 87% (79-94%)/94% (89-100%); OAM 80%
      (70-89%)/91% (83-98%); OMC 85% (77-93%)/94% (88-100%). The difference in
      eradication rates between the three groups was not statistically significant
      (P=0.419). Pre-treatment metronidazole resistance, was found in 34% of isolates
      and was a significant prognostic factor in patients receiving OAM (odds ratio
      5.26) but not in patients receiving OAC or OMC. CONCLUSIONS: All three treatment 
      regimens were safe, well tolerated and highly effective for eradication of H.
      pylori and ulcer healing. Pre-treatment metronidazole resistance reduced the
      efficacy of OAM but did not affect the efficacy of OMC.

TI  - Comparison of lansoprazole-based triple and dual therapy for treatment of
      Helicobacter pylori-related duodenal ulcer: an Asian multicentre double-blind
      randomized placebo controlled study.
PG  - 217-24
AB  - BACKGROUND: [corrected] In Asian countries with limited resources,
      clarithromycin-based triple therapy may not be readily available. There are also 
      few direct comparisons of different regimens in Asia. AIM: To compare two
      lansoprazole-based non-clarithromycin triple therapies and one dual therapy in a 
      prospective double-blind placebo-controlled study of Helicobacter pylori
      eradication and duodenal ulcer healing. METHODS: Fourteen centres in Asia
      participated in this study. Patients with acute duodenal ulcer who were H.
      pylori-positive were recruited. They were randomized to receive: (a) lansoprazole
      30 mg b.d., amoxycillin 1 g b.d. and metronidazole 500 mg b.d. for 2 weeks (LAM-2
      W), or (b) LAM for 1 week and placebo (LAM-1 W), or (c) lansoprazole 30 mg b.d., 
      amoxycillin 1 g b.d. and placebo for 2 weeks (LA-2 W). Upper endoscopy was
      repeated at week 6 to check for duodenal ulcer healing. Symptoms and side-effects
      were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 228 patients were recruited, and two patients 
      took less than 50% of the drugs. H. pylori eradication rates (intention-to-treat)
      were 68 out of 82 (83%) with LAM-2 W, 55 out of 71 (78%) with LAM-1 W and 43 out 
      of 75 (57%) with LA-2 W. There were significant differences (P=0. 001) in
      eradication rates when comparing either LAM-2 W or LAM-1 W with LA-2 W. The
      eradication rate in patients with metronidazole resistant H. pylori strains were 
      significantly lower than those with metronidazole sensitive strains (P=0.0001).
      The duodenal ulcer healing rates at week 6 were 85%, 85% and 72% in LAM-2 W,
      LAM-1 W and LA-2 W, respectively (P=0.065). Side-effects occurred in 13%, 11% and
      9% in LAM-2 W, LAM-1 W and LA-2 W, respectively. H. pylori eradication and
      initial ulcer size were factors affecting duodenal ulcer healing. CONCLUSIONS:
      This Asian multicentre study showed that 1-week lansoprazole-based triple therapy
      without clarithromycin has similar efficacy in H. pylori eradication and ulcer
      healing compared with a 2-week regimen. Both triple therapies were significantly 
      better than dual therapy in H. pylori eradication. Therefore, 1-week
      lansoprazole-based triple therapy is as safe and effective as 2-week therapy in
      eradication of H. pylori infection and healing of duodenal ulcer in these Asian
      centres.

TI  - The efficacy of proton-pump inhibitors in acute ulcer bleeding: a qualitative
      review.
PG  - 7-13
AB  - Despite remarkable progress in the treatment of chronic peptic ulcer disease,
      acute gastroduodenal ulcer hemorrhage remains a therapeutic challenge. Numerous
      trials of H-2 receptor antagonists have not consistently shown a significant
      benefit in such patients. Proton-pump inhibitors, which more profoundly suppress 
      gastric acid, are being increasingly evaluated. We have performed a qualitative
      systematic review to analyze the results of these trials to determine if a
      reasonable consensus can be reached. We searched for all published, randomized,
      controlled studies that evaluated proton-pump inhibitors in patients with acute
      peptic ulcer hemorrhage. The primary outcomes evaluated were: (A) persistent or
      recurrent bleeding; (B) need for surgery; and (C) mortality. Sixteen trials were 
      evaluated, enrolling 3154 patients. Four of the sixteen studies showed a
      statistically significant decrease in overall rebleeding rate, and two described 
      specific benefit in patients with Type IIa and IIb endoscopic stigmata. Four
      studies also showed a significantly decreased surgery rate, but none demonstrated
      a significant mortality reduction. Proton-pump inhibitors may improve outcome in 
      acute peptic ulcer bleeding, but the available clinical data remain inconsistent.
      Further study is necessary to define the optimal dosage, route of administration,
      duration of therapy, and subsets of patients most likely to benefit.

TI  - A retrospective study of the usefulness of acid secretory testing.
PG  - 103-11
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gastric analysis is useful for diagnosing and monitoring the control 
      of hypersecretory conditions and to distinguish appropriate from inappropriate
      causes of hypergastrinaemia. Pentagastrin, used to measure maximal acid output
      (MAO), is no longer available in the USA. METHODS: We examined the University of 
      Pennsylvania Health System gastric analysis database, which includes demographic 
      data, study indications, gastric analysis, and serum gastrin and secretin testing
      results according to referral indications, paying specific attention to
      discordant basal acid output (BAO) and MAO measurements. RESULTS: One hundred and
      twenty-four gastric analyses were performed in 103 patients (42 males, mean age
      47.5 years, 14 with prior acid-decreasing surgery). Recurrent ulceration or pain 
      unresponsive to antisecretory therapy was the indication in 42 patients. Twelve
      were hypersecretory, including three each with isolated elevations of BAO or MAO.
      Hypergastrinaemia was the indication in 35 patients. Five were hypersecretory
      (four with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome), three had isolated MAO elevations and 16 
      were hypo- or achlorhydric, indicating appropriate hypergastrinaemia. Of the
      seven patients with isolated MAO elevations, two had clear benefit from the
      stimulated portion of the study (four additional patients had equivocal benefit).
      CONCLUSIONS: Gastrin concentrations cannot be interpreted without knowledge of
      acid secretory capacity. MAO measurement has a small but significant benefit over
      measuring BAO alone.

TI  - Omeprazole or ranitidine bismuth citrate triple therapy to treat Helicobacter
      pylori infection: a randomized, controlled trial in Vietnamese patients with
      duodenal ulcer.
PG  - 97-101
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of triple therapy containing either omeprazole
      or ranitidine bismuth citrate (RBC) to treat H. pylori infection in Vietnamese
      duodenal ulcer patients. METHODS: Patients infected with H. pylori were
      randomized to receive either omeprazole (20 mg b.d.), clarithromycin (500 mg
      b.d.) and amoxycillin (1 g b.d.) for 10 days (OAC), or RBC (400 mg b.d.),
      clarithromycin (500 mg b.d.) and amoxycillin (1 g b.d.) for 10 days (RAC). H.
      pylori eradication and ulcer healing was established by a follow-up
      oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) at least 4 weeks after therapy. Side-effects
      and compliance were assessed. RESULTS: One hundred and four out of 108 (96%)
      patients with a duodenal ulcer were infected with H. pylori. Eighty per cent of
      infected patients had detectable CagA IgG antibodies. Fifty-seven patients
      received OAC and 47 received RAC. OAC eradicated H. pylori in 91 and 86% of
      patients by per protocol (PP) and intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis,
      respectively. PP and ITT eradication rates for RAC were 96 and 91%. Ulcer healing
      at the follow-up EGD was 89% with OAC and 100% with RAC. Side-effects were minor.
      No patient failed to complete the protocol due to side-effects. CONCLUSION:
      Triple therapy with either omeprazole or RBC is highly effective in eradicating
      H. pylori and healing duodenal ulcer in Vietnamese patients.

TI  - Salvage therapies after failure of Helicobacter pylori eradication with
      ranitidine bismuth citrate-based therapies.
PG  - 91-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Salvage therapies after initial Helicobacter pylori eradication
      failure of ranitidine bismuth citrate (RBC)-based regimens remain undefined. AIM:
      To test the efficacy of 1-week omeprazole, amoxycillin and clarithromycin as a
      second-line treatment and 1-week quadruple therapy after repeated failures of
      RBC- and proton pump inhibitor-based regimens. METHOD: Patients were recruited
      from a recently published prospective randomized study if confirmed to have
      failed H. pylori eradication with RBC-based regimens. They were given omeprazole 
      20 mg, amoxycillin 1 g and clarithromycin 500 mg (OAC) b.d. for 1 week. 13C-urea 
      breath test was performed 4 weeks after the conclusion of medication. Those who
      failed to respond to OAC were given 1-week quadruple therapy (bismuth subcitrate 
      120 mg, tetracycline 500 mg and metronidazole 400 mg q.d.s. plus omeprazole 20 mg
      b.d.). RESULTS: Among 398 patients receiving RBC-based therapies, 40 (10%) had
      failed eradication (RAC=7, RC-2=12, RMC=7, and RMT=14). OAC was prescribed to 31 
      patients (RAC=4, RC-2=9, RMC=6, and RMT=12) and 68% had successful eradication.
      Nine out of 10 patients with failed second treatment received quadruple therapy; 
      successful eradication occurred in 83% (5 out of 6) after repeated failures of
      clarithromycin-based regimens. CONCLUSION: One-week OAC is not an optimal
      second-line therapy when RBC-clarithromycin combinations fail. Quadruple therapy 
      appears to be effective despite repeated failures of clarithromycin-based RBC or 
      proton pump inhibitor therapies.

TI  - Bismuth-based quadruple therapy for Helicobacter pylori - a single triple capsule
      plus lansoprazole.
PG  - 85-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently a new 'all in one' single capsule with the three components 
      of bismuth-based triple therapy became available in trials for treating
      Helicobacter pylori. AIM: To investigate the efficacy and tolerability of this
      new capsule when combined with lansoprazole. METHODS: A total of 66 consecutive
      infected patients from a single centre received two single triple capsules four
      times daily and lansoprazole 30 mg b.d. for 7 days. Each capsule contained 60 mg 
      of bismuth subcitrate, 125 mg of tetracycline and 125 mg of metronidazole.
      Endoscopy with biopsies for CLO-test, histology and culture from antrum and
      corpus was performed before and at least 5 weeks after treatment. RESULTS: The
      per protocol cure rate was 56/64 (88%, 95% CI: 79-95%); by intention-to-treat
      56/65 (86%, 95% CI: 78-95%). The per protocol cure rate in metronidazole
      sensitive strains was 40/43 (93%, 95% CI: 85-100%); in resistant strains 5/9
      (56%, 95% CI: 23-88%). There was one drop-out due to adverse events. CONCLUSIONS:
      It is possible to combine the components of bismuth-based triple therapy into a
      single capsule. Based on the results it can be assumed that the capsule releases 
      its content in the stomach. When combined with lansoprazole it reaches high cure 
      rates, especially in metronidazole sensitive strains. This new approach
      simplifies bismuth-based anti-Helicobacter therapy.

TI  - Pantoprazole, amoxycillin and either azithromycin or clarithromycin for
      eradication of Helicobacter pylori in duodenal ulcer.
PG  - 69-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that 1-week triple therapy consisting of a proton 
      pump inhibitor, amoxycillin and clarithromycin may cure Helicobacter pylori
      infection in the majority of patients. AIM: To establish whether pantoprazole
      plus amoxycillin in association with either azithromycin or clarithromycin is
      useful in curing H. pylori infection in patients with a duodenal ulcer. METHODS: 
      One hundred and ten patients with active duodenal ulcers and H. pylori infection 
      were treated with pantoprazole (days 1-7, 40 mg b.d.; days 8-28 40 mg o.d.) plus 
      amoxycillin 1 g b.d. for the first 7 days. Patients were randomly assigned to
      receive either azithromycin 500 mg o.d. for the first 6 days (PAAz group; n=55)
      or clarithromycin 500 mg b.d. for the first 7 days of treatment (PAC group;
      n=55). H. pylori status was determined by urease test and histology before the
      treatment, and again 4 weeks after cessation of any medication. RESULTS: One
      hundred and three patients completed the study. H. pylori infection was
      eradicated in 78% (39/50) of patients in the PAAz group (ITT analysis: 71%, 95%
      CI: 61-83%) vs. 81% (43/53) of patients in the PAC group (ITT analysis: 78%, 95% 
      CI: 69-90%) (N.S.). All ulcers had healed. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that
      1-week triple therapy with pantoprazole, amoxycillin and either azithromycin or
      clarithromycin is not satisfactory (<80% ITT H. pylori eradication rate).

TI  - Does eradication of Helicobacter pylori alone heal duodenal ulcers?
PG  - 53-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection prevents duodenal ulcer 
      (DU) relapse, but it remains uncertain whether eradication of H. pylori alone
      heals duodenal ulceration. AIM: To test the hypothesis that eradication of H.
      pylori infection is accompanied by healing of duodenal ulcer. METHODS: A total of
      115 consecutive patients with endoscopically confirmed H. pylori-infected
      duodenal ulcer were randomly assigned to one of two groups. Group BTC patients
      received a 1-week course of colloidal bismuth subcitrate 220 mg b.d., tinidazole 
      500 mg b.d., clarithromycin 250 mg b.d. Group OBTC patients received omeprazole
      20 mg daily for 4 weeks with the BTC regimen during the first week. Endoscopy
      with antral biopsies and 13C-urea breath test (UBT) were performed before and 4
      weeks after completion of the 7-day triple or quadruple therapy. RESULTS: Eight
      patients dropped out (four in BTC and four in OBTC). Duodenal ulcer healing rates
      on an intention-to-treat basis in BTC and OBTC were 86% (95% CI: 77-95%) and 90% 
      (95% CI: 82-98%), respectively. The eradication rates of H. pylori on an
      intention-to-treat basis in BTC and OBTC were 88% (95% CI: 79-96%) and 91% (95%
      CI: 84-99%), respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in
      ulcer healing rates and eradication rates between these two groups (P > 0.05).
      Epigastric pain resolved more rapidly in patients assigned to OBTC compared with 
      those assigned to BTC. Both of the two regimens were well tolerated with only
      minor side-effects (3% of the 115 patients) and the compliance was good.
      CONCLUSIONS: BTC is a very effective H. pylori eradication regimen. Almost all
      duodenal ulcers heal spontaneously after cure of H. pylori infection using a
      1-week low-dose bismuth-based triple therapy. Treating duodenal ulcer with
      simultaneous administration of omeprazole achieves ulcer pain relief more
      rapidly.

TI  - Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and gastro-intestinal toxicity:
      current issues.
PG  - 242-5
AB  - Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among the most widely used
      drugs and their widespread use is associated with increased gastro-intestinal
      toxic effects such as ulceration, haemorrhage, perforation and death. They result
      in these complications mainly by reducing cytoprotective prostaglandins (PGE2 and
      PGI2) in the stomach, through the inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase (COX) enzyme. The
      increased morbidity and mortality, in addition to enormous cost, associated with 
      NSAID-associated side effects, necessitates a need for safer GI-friendly NSAID.
      Various approaches have been used to counteract NSAID associated side effects
      with varying degrees of success and acceptance. These include the use of
      alternative analgesia, anti-acid secretory agents like proton pump inhibitors,
      sucralfate and prostaglandin analogues. In addition, new types of NSAIDs are
      being developed, based on new understanding of their mechanism of action and the 
      pathogenesis of inflammation. These include a new class of NSAIDs called
      "selective Cox-2 inhibitors". These agents preserve the COX-1 that is responsible
      for the production of cytoprotective prostaglandins in the stomach and
      selectively inhibit COX-2 induced at the sites of inflammation. Selective COX-2
      inhibitors exert the same analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects as the existing
      NSAIDs but may be less toxic to the stomach. In this review the background
      development and well-structured clinical trials on this new generation NSAIDs are
      discussed.

TI  - Decision analysis of histamine H2-receptor antagonist maintenance therapy versus 
      Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy: a randomised controlled trial in
      patients with continuing pain after duodenal ulcer.
PG  - 355-65
AB  - BACKGROUND: Much has been published on the efficacy and cost effectiveness of
      Helicobacter pylori eradication treatment as an alternative to histamine
      H2-receptor antagonist maintenance treatment in peptic ulcer disease. However,
      most studies have analysed and emphasised H. pylori eradication rates rather than
      management/control of symptoms and the associated cost savings. Although H.
      pylori eradication therapy is very successful in clearing the infection,
      dyspeptic symptoms may persist and management of these can be expensive.
      OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the cost implications in
      controlling symptoms using either H2-receptor antagonist maintenance therapy or
      H. pylori eradication therapy in patients with duodenal ulcer disease. DESIGN:
      This was a non-blind, prospective, randomised, parallel-group study comparing
      maintenance H2-receptor antagonist treatment using ranitidine with H. pylori
      eradication therapy, with a 1-year follow-up. SETTING: This was a study of
      outpatients from general practices in Dundee, Scotland, or the Ninewells
      Hospital, Dundee, gastroenterology clinic. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: 119
      patients with confirmed duodenal ulcer, free from active ulceration at study
      entry but positive for H. pylori infection, who were receiving maintenance
      H2-receptor antagonist therapy. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomised to
      receive either continuing maintenance therapy with ranitidine (initially 150 mg
      daily; 58 patients) or H. pylori eradication therapy using an
      omeprazole/amoxicillin/metronidazole regimen (or omeprazole/clarithromycin if
      allergic to penicillin). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS: Overall, H. pylori
      eradication rates were 100% per protocol and 95.1% intention-to-treat. At
      completion of 1 year of follow-up, 12 of the 61 (19.7%) patients successfully
      eradicated of H. pylori were still dependent on acid suppression for symptom
      relief. H. pylori eradication treatment was the least-cost strategy in
      managing/controlling symptoms at 1 year (168 Pounds vs 210 Pounds per patient;
      1996 values). However, over time, post-eradication treatment costs were greater
      than H2-receptor antagonist therapy costs. Any potential savings were directly
      related to the proportion of patients needing further treatment post-eradication,
      the cost of endoscopy and the urea breath test. CONCLUSIONS: If dyspepsia
      persists long term, H. pylori eradication treatment may not be the least-cost
      option for patients with duodenal ulcer.

      clarithromycin in peptic ulcer patients with Helicobacter pylori infection:
      results of a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 76-9
AB  - This study was a comparison of 1-week and 2-week triple therapies with
      omeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin (OAC) in patients with peptic ulcer
      disease and Helicobacter pylori infection. A total of 147 peptic ulcer patients
      with H. pylori infection assessed by histology and culture were randomly treated 
      with omeprazole 20mg bid + amoxicillin 1000mg bid + clarithromycin 400mg bid for 
      either 1 week (OAC1w) or 2 weeks (OAC2w). Both groups then received omeprazole
      20mg daily for 2 weeks followed by ranitidine 300mg daily for 4 weeks.
      Eradication of H. pylori was assessed by histology, culture, and the 13C-urea
      breath test (13C-UBT) at least 6 weeks after cessation of antimicrobial therapy. 
      Intention-to-treat eradication rates were 78.2% (95%CI 69%-87%) with OAC1w and
      88.4% (95%CI 81%-96%) with OAC2w. Per-protocol eradication rates were 86.0%
      (95%CI 78%-94%) with OAC1w, 97.0% (95%CI 93%-100%) with OAC2w. There was no
      significant difference in the eradication rates between OAC1w and OAC2w. Side
      effects were mild and self-limiting in both groups. In conclusion, both 1- and
      2-week triple therapy with OAC are well tolerated and provide good eradication
      rates in peptic ulcer patients in Japan. The eradication rate of the 2-week
      regimen was higher than that of the 1-week regimen, but the difference was not
      statistically significant. Further studies including long-term economic
      considerations are required to determine the optimal duration of treatment.

PG  - 72-5
AB  - A new triple therapy using a proton pump inhibitor and two antibiotics shows high
      efficiency against Helicobacter pylori infection. The aim of this study was to
      determine the optimal dose and duration of lansoprazole (LA) administration in
      combination with amoxicillin (AMPC) and metronidazole (MNZ). A total of 91
      patients were enrolled in this study. They were divided into four groups: group
      A, 2 weeks of 30mg LA once daily, 500mg AMPC tid, and 250mg MNZ tid; group B, 2
      weeks of 30mg LA bid, 500mg AMPC tid, and 250mg MNZ tid; group C, 1 week of 30mg 
      LA once daily, 500mg AMPC tid, and 250mg MNZ tid; group D, 1 week of 30mg LA bid,
      500mg AMPC tid, and 250mg MNZ tid. H. pylori status was determined by the rapid
      urease test, culture, histology, and 13C-urea breath test before and at least 4
      weeks after the end of therapy. The cure rates in a per-protocol analysis and the
      incidence of adverse events in the evaluated patients were, respectively, 89.5%
      and 21.1% in group A, 100% and 20.0% in group B, 96.8% and 12.9% in group C, and 
      92.3% and 26.9% in group D. Most of the adverse events were tolerated. All four
      regimens in this study showed the same cure rates, and they were effective and
      well tolerated. One week of triple therapy using once-daily administration of
      30mg LA is a good alternative.

TI  - Prevention of the gastrointestinal adverse effects of nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs: the role of proton pump inhibitors.
PG  - 503-12
AB  - The associations between nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and the
      presence and complications of gastroduodenal erosions and ulcers are well
      established. Evidence that acid aggravates NSAID-induced injury provides a
      rationale for minimising such damage by acid suppression. Other strategies
      discussed include avoidance of NSAIDs or minimising their dosage, selecting
      NSAIDs known to cause less damage, and co-prescription of various agents.
      Cytoprotection with misoprostol, a prostaglandin analogue, has been shown to be
      effective in reducing NSAID-related peptic ulcers and their complications.
      Unfortunately, adverse effects may limit compliance in some patients. Histamine
      H2 antagonists have only limited efficacy in the prevention of NSAID-induced
      ulcers in humans, particularly in the stomach, except at higher than standard
      dosages. This may relate to their relatively modest effect in elevating gastric
      pH, especially in comparison with proton pump inhibitors. Several studies now
      confirm the efficacy of proton pump inhibitors in the short and longer term
      prevention of NSAID-induced upper gastrointestinal injury. Placebo-controlled
      studies suggest reductions of over 70% in gastric and duodenal ulcer rates over 3
      to 6 months. The recent ASTRONAUT (Acid Suppression Trial: Ranitidine versus
      Omeprazole for NSAID-Associated Ulcer Treatment) study documented the greater
      prophylactic efficacy of omeprazole over ranitidine at standard dosages for 6
      months. The OMNIUM (Omeprazole versus Misoprostol for NSAID-Induced Ulcer
      Management) study showed omeprazole to be slightly more effective overall than
      misoprostol in preventing the upper gastrointestinal adverse effects of NSAIDs,
      with both substantially more effective than placebo, although misoprostol was
      somewhat less well tolerated. Although substantial reductions in NSAID ulceration
      are now achievable when co-therapy with a proton pump inhibitor is given, a few
      patients will still develop ulcers and their complications. Hence the judicious
      use of NSAIDs in the first instance cannot be overemphasised.

TI  - Increased prevalence of precancerous changes in relatives of gastric cancer
      patients: critical role of H. pylori.
PG  - 22-30
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Helicobacter pylori is believed to predispose to gastric
      cancer by inducing gastric atrophy and hypochlorhydria. First-degree relatives of
      patients with gastric cancer have an increased risk of developing gastric cancer.
      The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of atrophy and
      hypochlorhydria and their association with H. pylori infection in first-degree
      relatives of patients with gastric cancer. METHODS: H. pylori status, gastric
      secretory function, and gastric histology were studied in 100 first-degree
      relatives of patients with noncardia gastric cancer and compared with those of
      controls with no family history of this cancer. RESULTS: Compared with healthy
      controls, relatives of patients with gastric cancer had a higher prevalence of
      hypochlorhydria (27% vs. 3%) but a similar prevalence of H. pylori infection (63%
      vs. 64%). Relatives of cancer patients also had a higher prevalence of atrophy
      (34%) than patients with nonulcer dyspepsia (5%) matched for H. pylori
      prevalence. Among the relatives of cancer patients, the prevalence of atrophy and
      hypochlorhydria was increased only in those with evidence of H. pylori infection,
      was greater in relatives of patients with familial cancer than in relatives of
      sporadic cancer index patients, and increased with age. Eradication of H. pylori 
      infection produced resolution of the gastric inflammation in each subject and
      resolution of hypochlorhydria and atrophy in 50% of the subjects. CONCLUSIONS:
      Relatives of patients with gastric cancer have an increased prevalence of
      precancerous gastric abnormalities, but this increase is confined to those with
      H. pylori infection. Consequently, prophylactic eradication of the infection
      should be offered to such subjects.

TI  - The effect of Helicobacter pylori eradication on duodenal gastric metaplasia.
PG  - 159-66
AB  - We investigated the incidence of duodenal gastric metaplasia and its response to 
      Helicobacter pylori eradication in patients with duodenal ulcer or erosive
      duodenitis. Gastric and duodenal biopsies were taken from patients with
      endoscopically detected H. pylori positive duodenal ulcer or erosive duodenitis, 
      and the presence and extent of duodenal gastric metaplasia was recorded. Patients
      were given omeprazole 20 mg twice daily for 2 weeks, and amoxicillin 1 g and
      clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily for 10 days, and then ranitidine for a further 
      8 weeks. Biopsies were repeated 6 months after the start of treatment. Duodenal
      gastric metaplasia was initially present in 22 patients (52%) and was more
      frequent in ulcer patients than in duodenitis patients, but not significantly so 
      (69% versus 45%). After treatment, H. pylori was eradicated in 68% of duodenal
      gastric metaplasia patients and the duodenum was normal endoscopically in 85% of 
      these patients. Duodenal gastric metaplasia was improved or eliminated in 12/15
      H. pylori eradicators (80%) and in 5/7 H. pylori non-eradicators (71%), a
      non-significant difference. The improvement in duodenal gastric metaplasia
      appeared to be independent of H. pylori eradication.

TI  - Pantoprazole suppresses Helicobacter pylori without affecting cure.
PG  - 266-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Short-term, low-dose triple regimens composed of proton-pump
      inhibitors (PPI) and two antibiotics are the current gold standard therapy for
      cure of Helicobacter pylori infection. To date, the effect of PPI pretreatment on
      eradication outcome is not known. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
      influence of pretreatment with pantoprazole on the efficacy of an ensuing triple 
      therapy. METHODS: In this open, randomized, monocenter, parallel group
      comparison, 107 patients with duodenal ulcer or functional dyspepsia were
      assigned to receive one of the following treatment regimens: a 7-day triple
      therapy with pantoprazole, 40 mg bid; clarithromycin, 250 mg bid; and
      metronidazole, 400 mg bid, which was either preceded or followed by a 7-day
      therapy with pantoprazole, 40 mg (P-PCM or PCM-P). Assessment of H. pylori status
      was performed by a biopsy urease test and 13C urea breath test at the initial
      visit and 13C urea breath test at all follow-up visits. RESULTS: The 7-day
      pantoprazole pretreatment resulted in a significant decline of the delta values
      of the 13C urea breath test. H. pylori infection was cured in 47 of 52
      intention-to-treat patients of the P-PCM group (90%; 95% confidence interval,
      79-97%) and in 46 of 53 of the PCM-P group (87%; 95% confidence interval,
      75-95%). CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment with pantoprazole suppresses H. pylori but
      does not impair the efficacy of a consecutive short-term, low-dose triple
      therapy.

TI  - Quadruple therapy is effective for eradicating Helicobacter pylori after failure 
      of triple proton-pump inhibitor-based therapy: a detailed, prospective analysis
      of 21 consecutive cases.
PG  - 222-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data regarding the effectiveness of second-line treatment of
      Helicobacter pylori infection are limited, especially if microbiological studies 
      are considered. METHODS AND PATIENTS: We conducted a prospective, uncontrolled
      study of a consecutive series of 21 peptic ulcer patients with failure of 1-week 
      lansoprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin. H. pylori status was evaluated by 
      urease test, histology, culture, and urea breath test. Susceptibility to
      amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and metronidazole was studied by E-test. Cure of
      infection was defined as negative results from endoscopy-based tests 1 month
      after treatment and negative results from a urea breath test at 2 months.
      Treatment consisted of a 1-week combination of lansoprazole (30 mg bid),
      tetracycline (500 mg qid), metronidazole (500 mg tid), and bismuth subcitrate
      (120 mg qid). RESULTS: H. pylori was resistant to metronidazole in three cases,
      to clarithromycin in three cases, and to both clarithromycin and metroinidazole
      in an additional three patients. No resistance to amoxicillin was found.
      Eradication was obtained in 20 cases (95.2% confidence interval [CI], 76.2-99.9).
      The only patient in whom infection was not eradicated harbored a
      metronidazole-resistant (minimum inhibitory concentration > 32 micrograms/ml)
      strain. No significant side effects were reported. CONCLUSION: Quadruple therapy 
      obtains a high eradication rate even in patients with clarithromycin- and
      metronidazole-resistant strains. Further randomized and controlled studies are
      warranted and are urgently needed.

TI  - Omeprazole, clarithromycin and furazolidone for the eradication of Helicobacter
      pylori in patients with duodenal ulcer.
PG  - 1647-52
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of omeprazole plus clarithromycin and furazolidone 
      in Helicobacter pylori eradication and duodenal ulcer healing in Brazilian
      patients. METHODS: Forty H. pylori-positive patients with duodenal ulcer were
      randomized to receive 20 mg omeprazole o.m. or b.d. for 1 month plus 500 mg
      clarithromycin (b.d. ) and 200 mg furazolidone (b.d.) for 1 week. RESULTS: Three 
      months after the end of the treatment the eradication rates were 90% by
      intention-to-treat analysis, and 97% by per protocol analysis. Mild side-effects 
      were observed in 25 patients, none of whom abandoned the protocol. No difference 
      was observed between the 20 mg and 40 mg omeprazole daily doses. Cure or
      significant improvement of the symptoms and of the histological alterations were 
      observed after H. pylori eradication. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that
      clarithromycin and furazolidone in combination with omeprazole are a good
      alternative for H. pylori eradication in Brazilian patients with duodenal ulcer.

TI  - Complete resolution of heartburn symptoms and health-related quality of life in
      patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 1621-30
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medical treatments for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) vary 
      in their ability to completely resolve heartburn and other symptoms. Although
      GERD reduces health-related quality of life (HRQL) little is known about the
      relationship between resolution of heartburn symptoms with medical therapy and
      HRQL. We evaluated the association between complete resolution of heartburn
      symptoms and functioning and well-being in three samples of patients with GERD.
      METHODS: We analysed baseline and follow-up assessments of heartburn symptoms and
      HRQL scores from three clinical trials (total n=1351) comparing omeprazole and
      ranitidine for acute symptomatic treatment of GERD. Heartburn symptoms were
      measured using patient diaries and/or patient self-report. HRQL was assessed
      using the Psychological General Well-Being Index (PGWB) in all three clinical
      trials and the SF-36 Health Survey in two clinical trials. Resolution of
      heartburn symptoms was defined as no heartburn reported during the assessment
      period. RESULTS: We observed statistically significant differences favouring
      patients with no heartburn symptoms on the PGWB total score (P=0.018 to P <
      0.0001) and anxiety (P=0.002 to P < 0.0001), general health (P=0.05 to P < 0.
      0001), positive well-being (P=0.028 to P < 0.0001) and vitality (P=0. 05 to P <
      0.0001) sub-scale scores at 4-14 weeks. Patients with no heartburn reported
      better SF-36 pain (P=0.005 to P < 0.0001) and general health perceptions (P=0.032
      to P < 0.0001) compared with patients still experiencing heartburn symptoms at
      4-24 weeks. SF-36 physical component summary scores were significantly better in 
      patients with no heartburn symptoms compared with patients with heartburn
      symptoms at 4-24 weeks (P=0.013 to P=0.009), while mental component summary
      scores were only significantly different at 24 weeks (P=0.0005) in one of the two
      studies where the SF-36 was utilized. CONCLUSIONS: Complete resolution of
      heartburn symptoms was consistently associated with improvement in HRQL; the
      greatest impact was observed on measures of psychological well-being and physical
      functioning and well-being. Effective treatment of GERD that completely resolves 
      heartburn results in clinically significant improvement in patient HRQL.

TI  - Eradication of Helicobacter pylori does not decrease the long-term use of
      acid-suppressive medication.
PG  - 1519-22
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many patients are not symptom-free after eradication therapy for
      Helicobacter pylori and continue to use proton pump inhibitors or H2-receptor
      antagonists (H2-RAs). AIM: To ascertain whether a cohort of patients treated for 
      H. pylori were still taking either proton pump inhibitors or H2-RAs more than 4
      years after H. pylori eradication therapy. METHODS: In 1993-94, a cohort of 167
      patients were given eradication therapy for their H. pylori infection. By means
      of questionnaires to the patient, general practitioner and pharmacist we were
      able to retrieve data from 151 patients. The use (at the time of questionnaire)
      of proton pump inhibitors or H2-RAs was noted. RESULTS: Indications for
      eradication therapy were peptic ulcer disease: 28 patients (19%) or functional
      dyspepsia: 123 patients (82%). Mean time of follow-up was 1466 +/- 21 days. In
      this group, 77 patients (51%) still used acid-suppressive medication (proton pump
      inhibitors 44% and H2-RAs 7%) at the time of the survey (mean follow-up more than
      4 years after eradication). In the group treated for peptic ulcer disease (n=28),
      only nine patients still used proton pump inhibitors or H2-RAs. In contrast, 68
      patients who were treated for functional dyspepsia (total number 123) still used 
      proton pump inhibitors or H2-RAs (55%) (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Even after
      successful H. pylori eradication, < 50% of patients stop acid-suppressive
      therapy. This contributes significantly to economic cost and raises doubts about 
      the practice of routinely eradicating H. pylori in patients with functional
      dyspepsia. In contrast, the majority of peptic ulcer patients are able to stop
      acid-suppressive medication.

TI  - Maintenance therapy with pantoprazole 20 mg prevents relapse of reflux
      oesophagitis.
PG  - 1481-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: Proton pump inhibitors can be effective as maintenance therapy in
      reducing the relapse rate of reflux oesophagitis at a dose lower than that used
      for acute healing. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (n=396, 18-88 years old) with
      healed reflux oesophagitis (grade II or III before healing) were included in this
      multinational, prospective, parallel-group, randomized double-blind study. They
      took oral pantoprazole 20 mg (n=203) or 40 mg (n=193), once daily for up to 12
      months. Scheduled endoscopies were performed at entry, after 6 and 12 months, or 
      when symptoms of at least moderate intensity were perceived on 3 consecutive
      days; symptoms were assessed every 3 months. The primary efficacy parameter was
      the time until endoscopically proven relapse of reflux oesophagitis occurred; the
      secondary parameters included tolerability, safety and time until symptomatic
      relapse occurred. RESULTS: Analysis was performed using the
      'all-patients-treated' approach. Endoscopic relapse rates in the 20 mg group
      after 6 and 12 months were 16 and 29%, respectively; in the 40 mg group, they
      were 7 and 19%, respectively. Symptomatic relapse rates after 6 and 12 months
      were 14 and 21% in the 20 mg group and 10 and 17% in the 40 mg group,
      respectively. Pantoprazole 20 mg and 40 mg were well tolerated throughout the
      study; the type and frequency of adverse events reported were similar for both
      treatment groups. CONCLUSION: The 20 mg dose was proven to be 'at least
      equivalent' to the 40 mg dose with respect to endoscopic and symptomatic relapse.
      The 20 mg once daily dose represents an effective and safe maintenance regimen
      for the majority of patients with healed reflux oesophagitis.

TI  - Oesophageal motility defects associated with nocturnal gastro-oesophageal reflux 
      on proton pump inhibitors.
PG  - 1467-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies from our laboratory reveal that 70% of patients with
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) on proton pump inhibitors twice daily
      (b.d.) have nocturnal gastric acid breakthrough (gastric pH < 4 > 1 h) which is
      often accompanied by oesophageal acid exposure. The pathogenesis of GER during
      gastric acid breakthrough is not clear. AIM: To determine the prevalence of
      oesophageal motility abnormalities in patients with nocturnal GER associated with
      nocturnal acid breakthrough on proton pump inhibitor b.d. METHODS: We reviewed
      the pH-metry and manometric studies of 100 consecutive patients with GERD who
      were on proton pump inhibitor b.d. pH tracings were analysed for the nocturnal
      period (10.00 hours until 06.00 hours). Nocturnal GER was defined as> 0.5% time
      distal oesophageal pH < 4. Manometric tracings were reviewed for lower
      oesophageal sphincter (LES) pressure and oesophageal body motility. Chi-squared
      and Fischer's test were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Of the 100
      patients, 74 (74%) had nocturnal gastric acid breakthrough. Thirty-one (42%) had 
      concurrent abnormal nocturnal GER (refluxers) and 43 out of 74 (58%) had no GER
      (non-refluxers). The prevalence of ineffective oesophageal motility, and low LES 
      pressure was significantly higher in refluxers than in non-refluxers (P < 0. 05, 
      P < 0.001, respectively). Ineffective-oesophageal motility has a high specificity
      (91%), but low sensitivity (45%) as a diagnostic predictor for patients who are
      more likely to develop nocturnal GER on proton pump inhibitor b.d. CONCLUSION:
      Ineffective oesophageal motility is a risk factor for proton pump inhibitor
      refractory GER.

TI  - A prospective evaluation of esophageal testing and a double-blind, randomized
      study of omeprazole in a diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm for chronic cough.
PG  - 3131-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recent studies suggest an association between chronic cough and
      gastroesophageal reflux. Our study aims were 1) to define the prevalence of acid 
      reflux induced cough in the general community, 2) to examine the ability of
      esophageal testing to identify gastroesophageal reflux related cough, and 3) to
      assess the utility of omeprazole in a chronic cough algorithm. METHODS: Patients 
      with chronic cough of unknown etiology, who were mostly from the community, were 
      evaluated. Subjects underwent a chest x-ray, methacholine challenge test, and
      empiric trial of postnasal drip therapy, and completed daily cough symptom
      diaries subjectively evaluating cough frequency and severity on a graded scale of
      0-4 (combined maximum 8). After excluding other causes of cough, the remaining
      patients underwent esophageal and pH testing. Those testing positive were
      randomized to omeprazole 40 mg b.i.d. or placebo for 12 weeks. Follow-up was 1
      yr. RESULTS: A total of 71 patients were screened; 48 were excluded. Twenty-three
      patients were evaluated for gastroesophageal reflux disease; six (26%) were
      eventually determined to have an acid-related cough. Of these patients, 17 had a 
      positive pH test, six (35%) of whom showed a striking improvement or resolution
      of their cough during omeprazole treatment which was sustained for up to 1 yr.
      Six had a negative pH test, none of whom responded to omeprazole therapy. No
      significant differences were seen between responders (n = 6) and nonresponders (n
      = 11) for demographic factors, baseline symptom frequency and duration, or
      physiological parameters (motility/pH). CONCLUSIONS: Acid-related chronic cough
      was present in 26% (six of 23) of patients evaluated for gastroesophageal reflux 
      disease. Esophageal testing does not reliably identify patients with acid induced
      chronic cough responsive to proton pump inhibitor therapy. We suggest that the
      best diagnostic and therapeutic approach, after excluding asthma and postnasal
      drip syndrome, is empiric treatment for 2 wk with a high dose proton pump
      inhibitor.

TI  - Pantoprazole versus omeprazole: influence on meal-stimulated gastric acid
      secretion.
PG  - 1277-82
AB  - AIMS: To determine the influence of recommended therapeutic doses of pantoprazole
      and omeprazole on meal-stimulated acid secretion. METHODS: In this double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled, three-period crossover study, 12 healthy male volunteers
      received 40 mg pantoprazole od, 20 mg omeprazole od or placebo at 08:00 h for 5
      days in a randomized order. Meal-stimulated acid secretion was determined by
      means of a homogenized test meal, and intragastric titration on day 1, 4-6 h,
      8-10 h, 16-18 h, and 24-26 h, and on days 3 and 5, 4-6 h after oral drug
      administration. RESULTS: On day 1 (4-6 h after oral drug administration),
      meal-stimulated acid secretion was decreased by 36% and 24% after administration 
      of 40 mg pantoprazole or 20 mg omeprazole, respectively. After 3 and 5 days of
      dosing, the decreases were 88% and 85% with 40 mg pantoprazole, and 70% and 74%
      with 20 mg omeprazole. At all measuring points during the 5-day dosing periods,
      40 mg pantoprazole proved superior to 20 mg omeprazole in inhibiting
      meal-stimulated gastric acid secretion. The differences were statistically
      significant for pantoprazole on day 1, 24-26 h after oral drug administration and
      on day 3 (P = 0.0425 and P = 0.0244, respectively). On day 1, only pantoprazole
      was significantly better than placebo (P = 0.0210, 4-6 h after dosing; P =
      0.0093, 8-10 h after dosing and P = 0.0068, 16-18 h after dosing). CONCLUSION:
      Pantoprazole 40 mg is significantly more effective than omeprazole 20 mg in
      inhibiting meal-stimulated acid secretion. In addition, pantoprazole exhibits a
      more rapid onset of action.

TI  - The outcome of a 2-week treatment of Helicobacter pylori-positive duodenal ulcer 
      with omeprazole-based antibiotic regimen in a region with high metronidazole
      resistance rate.
PG  - 1259-63
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Metronidazole resistance is a major problem in many
      developing countries. Our main objective was to study the outcome of a
      non-metronidazole and omeprazole-based antibiotic regimen in eradicating
      Helicobacter pylori in patients with duodenal ulcer. DESIGN: A prospective study 
      of 50 consecutive patients with proven peptic ulcer (mean age 36.6 +/- 10.5
      years, range 17-60, male:female = 2), referred from the primary health centres.
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome of the study was H. pylori eradication,
      at least 4 weeks after stopping antibiotic treatment. METHODS: Patients were
      considered eligible for the study if they had endoscopic evidence or a past
      medical history of peptic ulcer and had not received any antibiotics for at least
      4 weeks prior to admission into the study. H. pylori infection was confirmed by
      serology, histology, a rapid urease test (RUT) and culture. After an initial
      oesophago-gastroduodenoscopy (OGD), each patient received a 2-week course of
      omeprazole (20 mg twice daily), and each of amoxycillin capsules (500 mg) and
      clarithromycin tablets (250 mg) thrice daily after food. The follow-up OGDs were 
      performed after a mean period of 10.04 weeks (range 4-48) and at 10.4 +/- 2.5
      months (range 6-14 months) after stopping treatment. RESULTS: All 50 patients
      completed the study. The sensitivity values for serology, RUT and histopathology 
      were 98, 96 and 100%, respectively. H. pylori culture was positive in only 15 of 
      50 patients (30% sensitivity). H. pylori was eradicated in 47 (94%) patients.
      There was no evidence of H. pylori infection in the 27 of 35 (77%) patients, who 
      returned for a third OGD. At the time of the second OGD, there was a significant 
      reduction of pain-days (from 5.47 to 1.16), and antral (from 1.95 to 0.78) and
      corpus (from 1.8 to 0.6) mucosal cellular infiltrate scores, when compared with
      the first OGD (P < 0.001 in each case). CONCLUSION: Exclusion of metronidazole
      from the treatment regimen of patients with H. pylori-positive duodenal ulcer in 
      a region with metronidazole resistance yielded an excellent H. pylori eradication
      rate of 94%, when omeprazole, amoxicillin and clarithromycin were used.

TI  - Gastroesophageal reflux in asthmatics: A double-blind, placebo-controlled
      crossover study with omeprazole.
PG  - 1257-64
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) 
      among patients with asthma and to determine the effect of omeprazole on the
      outcome of asthma in patients with GER. DESIGN: A double-blind,
      placebo-controlled crossover study. SETTING: Asthmatic patients who attended the 
      pulmonary outpatient clinic of Turku University Central Hospital, Finland.
      PATIENTS: One hundred seven asthmatic patients. INTERVENTIONS: The patients who
      were found to have GER in ambulatory esophageal pH monitoring were randomized to 
      receive either omeprazole, 40 mg qd, or placebo for 8 weeks. After a 2-week
      washout period, the patients were crossed over to the other treatment. Spirometry
      was performed at baseline and immediately after both treatment periods. Peak
      expiratory values, use of sympathomimetics, and pulmonary and gastric symptoms
      were recorded daily in a diary. RESULTS: Pathologic GER was found in 53% of the
      asthmatic patients. One third of these patients had no typical reflux symptoms.
      Daytime pulmonary symptoms did not improve significantly (p = 0.14), but a
      reduction in nighttime asthma symptoms (p = 0.04) was found during omeprazole
      treatment. In the patients with intrinsic asthma, there was a decline in
      [corrected] FEV(1) values (p = 0.049). Based on symptom scores, 35% of the
      patients were regarded as responders to 8-week omeprazole treatment. The reflux
      (time [percent] of pH < 4) was found to be more severe (p = 0. 002) in the
      responders. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high prevalence of GER in the asthmatic
      population. This reflux is often clinically "silent." After an 8-week omeprazole 
      treatment, there was a reduction in nocturnal asthma symptoms, whereas daytime
      asthma outcome did not improve. There seems to be a subgroup of asthma patients
      who benefit from excessive antireflux therapy.

TI  - Cost effectiveness of Helicobacter pylori eradication therapies in patients with 
      duodenal ulcer. An analysis of triple therapy versus two dual therapy
      alternatives.
PG  - 297-306
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recent research has focused on eradication therapy as the principal
      treatment of patients with duodenal ulcers and Helicobacter pylori infection. The
      aim of this study was to analyse the cost effectiveness of triple therapy versus 
      2 dual therapies. DESIGN: A health economic evaluation of triple therapy with
      lansoprazole, amoxicillin and clarithromycin versus 2 dual therapies
      (lansoprazole or omeprazole, each with amoxicillin) in the eradication of
      Helicobacter pylori in patients with duodenal ulcers was performed in parallel
      with a randomised clinical trial. Direct and indirect costs were estimated for 1 
      year using data elicited from patient questionnaires and from the clinical trial.
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS: Despite the initial drug cost for triple
      therapy being 650 Swedish kronor (SEK; 1996 values) higher, the average total
      direct cost in this group was only SEK150 to SEK200 higher than in the dual
      therapy groups. This was a result of fewer outpatient visits and lower drug use
      after treatment failure in the triple therapy group. Triple therapy had a more
      favourable cost-effectiveness ratio than the dual therapies. CONCLUSION: In spite
      of higher initial antimicrobial costs, triple therapy with lansoprazole,
      amoxicillin and clarithromycin is more cost effective than dual therapy because
      of a higher eradication rate and greater symptom relief.

TI  - Review article: rabeprazole's profile in patients with gastrointestinal diseases.
PG  - 25-32
AB  - The selection of agents to treat patients with acid-related gastrointestinal
      diseases requires knowledge of their efficacy, tolerability, and ease of dosing
      among individuals with differing disease severities and other baseline
      characteristics. The efficacy and favourable benefit-risk profile of rabeprazole,
      a new proton pump inhibitor, has been demonstrated in controlled clinical trials 
      of patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD), duodenal ulcers, and
      gastric ulcers. In comparative trials, rabeprazole is at least as effective as
      omeprazole for the treatment of GERD, duodenal ulcers, and gastric ulcers, and it
      is superior to histamine2-receptor antagonists for the treatment of GERD and
      duodenal ulcers. Its once-daily dosing regimen and low potential for interaction 
      with drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system make it a particularly
      attractive option for the treatment of acid-related diseases among older
      individuals. Rabeprazole is likely to be a valuable new addition to its class in

TI  - Review article: rabeprazole's tolerability profile in clinical trials.
PG  - 17-23
AB  - Rabeprazole is a new member of a class of substituted benzimidazole drugs known
      as proton pump inhibitors. Comparative trials have demonstrated that it is at
      least as effective as omeprazole for the treatment of gastrooesophageal reflux
      disease (GERD), duodenal ulcers, or gastric ulcers. It is significantly more
      effective than histamine2-receptor antagonists for acid suppression, GERD healing
      and pain relief, and duodenal ulcer healing and pain relief. Adverse events
      reported during clinical trials provide an important indication of a medication's
      tolerability. We demonstrate that rabeprazole has a favourable adverse events
      profile. It is well tolerated in placebo-controlled studies and comparative
      trials with omeprazole and H2-receptor antagonists. Moreover, no dose adjustments
      are required for special populations, such as the elderly or patients with renal 
      or mild-to-moderate hepatic disease. Adverse events data from clinical trials
      support the use of rabeprazole as a treatment for acid-related diseases.

TI  - Rabeprazole: a review of its use in acid-related gastrointestinal disorders.
PG  - 725-42
AB  - Rabeprazole is an inhibitor of the gastric proton pump. It causes dose-dependent 
      inhibition of acid secretion and has a more rapid onset of action than
      omeprazole. Duodenal ulcers healed faster after treatment with rabeprazole 20 or 
      40 mg/day than placebo or ranitidine 150 mg 4 times daily and at a generally
      similar rate to omeprazole 20 mg/day in patients with duodenal ulcers;
      rabeprazole was similar or superior to these agents in relieving symptoms.
      Rabeprazole 20 and 40 mg/day healed gastric ulcers faster than placebo, and
      rabeprazole 20 mg/day healed ulcers at a similar healing rate, to omeprazole 20
      mg/day in well controlled 6-week studies. Gastric ulcer symptom relief with
      rabeprazole was similar or superior to that provided by omeprazole or placebo. In
      8-week studies in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD),
      rabeprazole 10, 20 and 40 mg/day were more effective than placebo, rabeprazole 20
      mg/day was more effective than ranitidine 150 mg twice daily, and rabeprazole 20 
      mg/day was similar in efficacy to omeprazole 20 mg/day. Symptom relief with
      rabeprazole in 8-week trials in patients with GERD was superior to that provided 
      by placebo, and similar to ranitidine or omeprazole. Rabeprazole was similar to
      omeprazole and superior to placebo in both maintenance of healing and prevention 
      of symptoms in patients with healed GERD in 1-year studies. One-week triple
      therapy with rabeprazole 20 mg twice daily plus 2 antibacterial agents achieved >
      or = 90% Helicobacter pylori eradication, but, as would be expected, a regimen of
      rabeprazole 20 mg twice daily plus 1 antibacterial agent was less successful. The
      drug was as effective as omeprazole and lansoprazole as part of triple therapy
      for H. pylori eradication. Rabeprazole successfully reduced acid output to target
      levels and prevented further pathological changes in 10 patients with
      Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Usual dosages of rabeprazole are 20 mg/day for 4
      weeks to treat duodenal ulcers, 6 weeks for gastric ulcers and 8 weeks for GERD, 
      although some patients with duodenal ulcer may respond to a 10 mg/day dosage. For
      long term maintenance of GERD healing, 10 or 20 mg daily doses are adequate.
      Patients with hypersecretory states may need individualised dosages starting at
      60 mg/day. The drug was well tolerated in clinical trials, with headache, rash,
      infection, diarrhoea and flu syndrome as the most common adverse events. In
      conclusion, rabeprazole appears to be a well tolerated proton pump inhibitor with
      a rapid onset of action and a low potential for drug interactions. The drug may
      be used to achieve healing and the relief of symptoms of duodenal ulcer, gastric 
      ulcer and GERD, maintain GERD healing, and can form part of effective regimens to
      eradicate H. pylori.

TI  - Testing for Helicobacter pylori infection: validation and diagnostic yield of a
      near patient test in primary care.
PG  - 1236-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of a near patient test for Helicobacter
      pylori infection in primary care. DESIGN: Validation study performed within a
      randomised trial of four management strategies for dyspepsia. SETTING: 43 general
      practices around Nottingham. SUBJECTS: 394 patients aged 18-70 years presenting
      with recent onset dyspepsia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Results of the FlexSure test 
      compared with an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; HM-CAP) with an
      identical antigen profile and with results of an earlier validation study in
      secondary care. Diagnostic yield of patients undergoing endoscopy on the basis of
      their FlexSure result compared with those of patients referred directly for
      endoscopy. RESULTS: When used in primary care FlexSure test had a sensitivity and
      specificity of 67% (95% confidence interval 59% to 75%) and 98% (95% to 99%)
      compared with a sensitivity and specificity of 92% (87% to 97%) and 90% (83% to
      97%) when used previously in secondary care. Of the H pylori test and refer group
      14% (28/199) were found to have conditions for which H pylori eradication was
      appropriate compared with 23% (39/170) of the group referred directly for
      endoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: When used in primary care the sensitivity of the FlexSure
      test was significantly poorer than in secondary care. About a third of patients
      who would have benefited from H pylori eradication were not detected. Near
      patient tests need to be validated in primary care before they are incorporated
      into management policies for dyspepsia.

TI  - Lack of effect of treatment for Helicobacter pylori on symptoms of nonulcer
      dyspepsia.
PG  - 2283-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prior studies have yielded conflicting results on whether or not
      Helicobacter pylori causes nonulcer dyspepsia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled 
      100 consecutive patients with nonulcer dyspepsia into a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial. Patients with peptic ulcer disease, esophagitis,
      hepatobiliary disease, irritable bowel disease, or predominantly reflux-related
      symptoms were excluded by history and upper endoscopy. Helicobacter pylori
      infection was determined by biopsy and histologic examination. Serum H. pylori
      IgG antibodies and CagA status were determined by Western blot. Enrolled patients
      were randomized to a 14-day regimen of omeprazole (20 mg twice daily) and
      clarithromycin (500 mg three times daily) or placebo. Dyspeptic symptoms were
      assessed by use of a visual analog scale at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, and 12
      months after treatment. Follow-up upper endoscopy with biopsy was performed 4
      weeks after treatment. Compliance was measured by tablet counts. RESULTS: At 1
      year, the change in dyspeptic symptoms was -24.0 (95% confidence interval, -69.0 
      to 21.0) in the omeprazole and clarithromycin group and -24.2 in the placebo
      group (95% confidence interval, -70.0 to 21.6). Furthermore, patients with
      persistent H. pylori infection demonstrated a greater, but not significant,
      improvement in symptoms (-40 +/- 144 [mean +/- SD], -65 +/- 142, -45 +/- 138, and
      -39 +/- 163) than those with successful eradication (-26 +/- 126, -26 +/- 148,
      -12 +/- 126, and -25 +/- 151) at months 1, 3, 6, and 12, respectively.
      CONCLUSION: Patients with nonulcer dyspepsia should not routinely be treated for 
      H. pylori, since it is not a cause of this condition in most patients.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori treatment instead of maintenance therapy for peptic ulcer
      disease: the effectiveness of case-finding in general practice.
PG  - 1317-21
AB  - BACKGROUND: Maintenance therapy with acid-inhibiting medication is common in
      general practice. Since the eradication of Helicobacter pylori has become the
      treatment of choice for peptic ulcer disease, H. pylori treatment could replace
      maintenance therapy in patients with an ulcer history. AIM: To determine the
      effectiveness of a full peptic ulcer disease history case-finding strategy,
      together with subsequent H. pylori testing and treatment, in discontinuing
      maintenance therapy. METHOD: Patients were included from seven general practices,
      who had been using acid-inhibiting medication for more than 3 months in the
      period May 1996-May 1997. Patients with a history of proven peptic ulcer disease 
      were tested, and treated with proton pump inhibitor-triple therapy if positive.
      Maintenance therapy was discontinued and restart within 12 months was monitored. 
      RESULTS: Long-term acid suppression was used by 2.8% of the practice-populations.
      A peptic ulcer disease history was found in 18% of the patients, 73% of whom were
      offered the 'H. pylori test and treat' alternative. The majority responded: 92%
      of the H. pylori-infected patients were treated, 78% of whom successfully
      discontinued long-term medication. CONCLUSION: Implementing an 'H. pylori test
      and treat' strategy enabled one-third of the patients with a peptic ulcer disease
      history to stop maintenance therapy successfully. The strategy contributes to
      reduction of long-term drug use, but compliance needs improvement.

TI  - Review article: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-associated gastrointestinal
      complications--guidelines for prevention and treatment.
PG  - 1273-85
AB  - Chronic ingestion of NSAIDs increases the risk for gastrointestinal
      complications, which range from dyspepsia to gastrointestinal bleeding,
      obstruction, and perforation. Among patients using NSAIDs, 0.1 to 2.0% per year
      suffer serious gastrointestinal complications. Patients who require analgesic
      therapy should be carefully assessed for the lowest possible dosage and shortest 
      duration of NSAID use and for the potential of treatment with a non-NSAID pain
      reliever. These patients should also be assessed for factors that increase their 
      risk of gastrointestinal complications, including increased age, concomitant
      anticoagulant or corticosteroid use, and past history of NSAID-associated
      gastrointestinal complications. The exact association between Helicobacter pylori
      infection and NSAID-related ulcer disease is unclear, and the routine testing and
      treatment of all NSAID using patients for H. pylori infection is not recommended 
      at this time. NSAID-using patients who suffer from dyspepsia should have NSAIDs
      discontinued, the dosage changed, or be changed to a different class of NSAID. If
      NSAIDs cannot be discontinued, then an antisecretory agent should be initiated.
      Misoprostol prevents NSAID-associated gastrointestinal complications. Proton pump
      inhibitors are the most effective at healing NSAID-associated ulcers among
      patients who cannot discontinue NSAID therapy.

TI  - Helicobacter treatment with quadruple therapy in primary health care for patients
      with a history of ulcer disease.
PG  - 483-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few patients with a history of peptic ulcer are treated by their GP
      for H. pylori infection, even though theoretical evidence supports such an
      approach. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine the validity of this recommendation
      and to test the feasibility of quadruple therapy in primary health care. METHODS:
      In this prospective, non-randomized intervention study, 51 unselected patients
      with a history of proven ulcer disease received a 7-day quadruple therapy
      (lansoprazole, colloidal bismuth subcitrate, tetracycline and metronidazole) from
      their GP. Main outcome measures were: (i) endoscopically confirmed cure of the
      infection; (ii) results of serology at entry and at 6 months follow-up; (iii)
      quality of life at entry, at 6 weeks and at 6 months follow-up; (iv) gastric
      symptoms at entry, at 6 weeks and at 6 months follow-up; and (v) medication at
      entry and at 6 months follow-up. RESULTS: Quadruple therapy was well tolerated
      and there were no drop-outs with this regimen. Intention to treat cure rate was
      48/51 (94%, 95% CI 87-100%), per protocol cure rate was 48/49 (98%, 95% CI
      94-100%). 45/50 (90%) had positive serology at entry. IgG antibody titres
      decreased > 40% in 95.2% of patients. Quality of life improved significantly
      after treatment, gastric symptoms decreased and medication use decreased.
      CONCLUSIONS: GPs should be encouraged to identify patients with a history of
      ulcer disease and chronic use of acid suppressants and offer them treatment for
      H. pylori infection. This approach will cure the infection in almost all
      patients, it will improve the quality of life and decrease costs. Quadruple
      therapy does not lose efficacy when employed in primary care. Pre-treatment
      serological testing is potentially useful for narrowing down the treatment group 
      to those with actual infection, and serology is promising as an easy and cheap
      follow-up instrument in primary health care.

TI  - Clinical and economic assessment of the omeprazole test in patients with symptoms
      suggestive of gastroesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 2161-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a trial of a high-dose proton
      pump inhibitor (the omeprazole test) in detecting gastroesophageal reflux disease
      (GERD) in patients with heartburn symptoms. DESIGN: A randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, crossover trial. PATIENTS AND SETTING: Forty-three
      consecutive patients with symptoms suggestive of GERD were enrolled at a Veterans
      Affairs medical center. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Symptom response to the omeprazole
      test vs placebo in GERD-positive and GERD-negative patients; sensitivity,
      specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the omeprazole test; 
      and cost per correct diagnosis achieved with the omeprazole test compared with
      traditional diagnostic strategies. RESULTS: Of 42 patients (98%) who completed
      the study, 35 (83%) were classified as GERD positive and 7 (17%) as GERD
      negative. Twenty-eight GERD-positive and 3 GERD-negative patients responded to
      the omeprazole test, providing a sensitivity of 80.0% (95% confidence interval,
      66.7%-93.3%) and a specificity of 57.1% (95% confidence interval, 20.5%-93.8%).
      Economic analysis revealed that the omeprazole test saves $348 per average
      patient evaluated, and results in a 64% reduction in the number of upper
      endoscopies performed and a 53% reduction in the use of pH testing. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The omeprazole test is sensitive and fairly specific for diagnosing GERD in
      patients with typical GERD symptoms. This strategy could result in significant
      cost savings and decreased use of invasive diagnostic tests.

TI  - The efficacy of the third pump inhibitor--pantoprazole--in the short-term
      treatment of Chinese patients with duodenal ulcer.
PG  - 2372-8
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: To study the efficacy and tolerability of pantoprazole 40 mg
      once daily before breakfast compared with ranitidine 300 mg once daily at bedtime
      in Chinese patients with duodenal ulcer, and to evaluate the relationship between
      Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) clearance and ulcer healing rate. METHODOLOGY: A 
      total of 160 patients (80 in each group) with endoscopically diagnosed, active
      duodenal ulcers were studied in this randomized double-blind trial. Endoscopy was
      performed after 2 weeks of treatment. If unhealed, then the patients were
      re-endoscoped after an additional 2 weeks of similar treatment. RESULTS: The
      healing rates after 2 and 4 weeks were 61.3% and 97.3%, respectively in the
      pantoprazole group, and 50.7% and 76.9% in the ranitidine group. The difference
      between the two groups was significant at 4 weeks (p < 0.01, per protocol
      analysis). The rate of pain free ulcer was higher in the pantoprazole group than 
      in the ranitidine group at 2 weeks (84.2% vs. 59.6%, p < 0.01). Higher clearance 
      of H. pylori was also observed in the pantoprazole group compared with the
      ranitidine group at 4 weeks (20% vs. 0%, p = 0.05). The healing rate tended to be
      higher in patients who were H. pylori-cleared at 2 weeks (p = 0.07) in the
      pantoprazole group. Both medications were well tolerated without any serious
      adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: Pantoprazole 40 mg daily is superior to ranitidine 
      300 mg daily in the short-term treatment of acute duodenal ulcer in Chinese
      patients, in terms of ulcer healing and pain relief, and appears to be
      well-tolerated.

TI  - A three-day course of intravenous omeprazole plus antibiotics for H.
      pylori-positive bleeding duodenal ulcer.
PG  - 2363-71
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: This prospective trial aimed to test the efficacy of 3-day
      intravenous omeprazole plus antibiotics for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)
      eradication rate, and to see whether individualized response to omeprazole in
      intragastric pH elevation will alter the success of eradication. METHODOLOGY: One
      hundred and thirty-eight cases with H. pylori-positive duodenal ulcer bleeding
      were randomized into four therapy groups: Group 1 (n = 32) received a 3-day
      course of intravenous omeprazole (80 mg loading then 40 mg q 9 am & 9 pm) plus
      ampicillin/salbactum (1.5 gm i.v. loading then 750 mg q 9 am, 3 pm, & 9 pm);
      Group 2 (n = 35) followed protocol as for Group 1 except the antibiotics were
      metronidazole and erythromycin (both 500 mg i.v. q 9 am, 3 pm, & 9 pm). Group 3
      (n = 31) followed protocol as for Group 1 and further added with erythromycin
      (both 500 mg i.v. q 9 am, 3 pm, & 9 pm). Group 4 served as a control group (n =
      40) receiving oral dual therapy after leaving the emergency room (omeprazole 20
      mg and amoxycillin 1 g bid x 2 weeks). In each case, three gastric biopsies were 
      done for total histologic density of H. pylori (THPD) (range: 0-15) before, 1 day
      and 6 weeks after completion of therapy. Except for the control group, the
      24-hour ambulatory intragastric pH meter (MIC Inc, Gastrograph Spark III, Swiss) 
      was inserted as possible on the 2nd day of therapy. RESULTS: The 3-day
      intravenous regimens achieved high clearance rates of H. pylori (Group 1: 93.8%; 
      Group 2: 93.9%; Group 3: 100%). The eradication rates of H. pylori in Groups 1-4 
      were 43.8%, 57.1%, 58.1%, and 72.8%, respectively. In Groups 1-3, the H.
      pylori-eradicated cases had lower pre-treatment THPD than non-eradicated cases
      (6.01 vs. 9.24, p < 0.001). Among 72 cases with pH meter insertion, the
      percentage of intragastric pH > 5.3 during 24-hour was not different among 35 H. 
      pylori non-eradicated and 37 eradicated cases (78.7 vs. 76.7%, p > 0.05).
      CONCLUSIONS: The 3-day intravenous regimens may achieve clearance of H. pylori
      quickly. However, they were not so effective for eradication, especially in cases
      with higher bacterial loads. The interindividual response to omeprazole in
      intragastric pH elevation under the study dosage had insignificant variations to 
      alter the success of eradication.

TI  - Effect of omeprazole and amoxicillin plus metronidazole on the eradication of
      Helicobacter pylori and the healing of duodenal ulcer: comparison with a
      historical control.
PG  - 2358-62
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: To test the hypothesis of equivalence of an omeprazole 7-day
      triple therapy without subsequent acid suppression and a historical ranitidine
      12-day triple therapy (recruiting phase 1989-91) with subsequent acid suppression
      in their effect on the eradication of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and the
      healing of duodenal ulcer. METHODOLOGY: Seventy-seven patients with H.
      pylori-positive duodenal ulcers received a 7-day treatment with amoxicillin 750
      mg tid and metronidazole 500 mg tid. Additional omeprazole 20 mg or 40 mg once
      daily was given to 39 and 38 of the patients, respectively. Endoscopy was
      performed before treatment and four weeks after cessation of therapy. RESULTS:
      The cumulative intention-to-treat (ITT) H. pylori-eradication rate was 66%
      (51/77) as compared to 89% (46/52) for the historical control (p < 0.05). The
      corresponding ulcer healing rates were 90% (69/77) and 92% (48/52). Primary
      metronidazole resistance (PMR) had escalated from 10% to 27% within 6 years
      resulting in eradication rates of 84% for sensitive and 19% for resistant strains
      (p < 0.001). PMR could be demonstrated in 45% of all female, but only in 17% of
      the male patients (p < 0.05). In the patients with H. pylori eradication, the
      ulcers healed in 98% (50/51) as compared to 73% (19/26) in those with persistent 
      infection (p < 0.005). Analysis based on the presence of PMR showed ulcer healing
      rates of 95% (53/56) for sensitive and 76% (16/21) for resistant strains (p <
      0.05). Improvement of pain also showed a significant correlation with successful 
      eradication. H. pylori-eradication, healing and symptom relief were similar in
      the omeprazole 20 mg and 40 mg groups. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of amoxicillin
      plus metronidazole plus antisecretory agent on the eradication of H. pylori has
      decreased markedly during the past 6 years due to the escalation of PMR. Doubling
      of the omeprazole dose does not affect outcome. Cure of the infection as well as 
      metronidazole susceptibility enhance duodenal ulcer healing and symptom relief.
      Acid suppression following a successful 1-week anti-HP therapy is not required
      for duodenal ulcer treatment.

TI  - The influence of intravenous omeprazole on intragastric pH and outcomes in
      patients with peptic ulcer bleeding after successful endoscopic therapy--a
      prospective randomized comparative trial.
PG  - 2183-8
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The role of omeprazole in preventing rebleeding in patients with
      peptic ulcer bleeding after successful endoscopic therapy has been controversial.
      In this study, we used 3 different formulas of intravenous omeprazole in the
      above patients. We wished to compare the intragastric pH and outcomes among them.
      METHODOLOGY: Between July 1996 and May 1997, after having obtained initial
      hemostasis with endoscopic therapy, a total of 20 patients with peptic ulcer
      bleeding (spurting/oozing/non-bleeding visible vessel: 6/4/10) received
      intravenous bolus of omeprazole 20 mg every 3 hours; 20 patients (3/5/12)
      received intravenous bolus of omeprazole 40 mg every 6 hours; and, 20 patients
      (5/4/11) received intravenous bolus of omeprazole 80 mg every 12 hours for 3
      days. One intragastric pH meter (Gastrograph Mark III, Medical Instruments Corp. 
      Switzerland) was used to record 24-hour intragastic pH. RESULTS: The intragastric
      pH in the patients receiving omeprazole 20 mg every 3 hours was 6.1, 6.0-6.2
      (mean: 95% CI); in patients receiving omeprazole 40 mg every 6 hours it was 6.4, 
      6.2-6.5; and, in patients receiving omeprazole 80 mg every 12 hours it was 5.8,
      5.7-5.9. The duration of intragastric pH > 6.0 in omeprazole 20 mg every 3 hours 
      was 70.9%, 57.3%-84.4% (mean: 95% CI); in omeprazole 40 mg every 6 hours it was
      83.1%, 73.1%-93.1%; and, in omeprazole 80 mg every 12 hours it was 66%,
      51.5%-80.4%. Patients with peptic ulcers receiving omeprazole 40 mg intravenous
      bolus every 6 hours had the highest intragastric pH as compared with the other 2 
      groups (p < 0.0001). There were no significant differences concerning rebleeding 
      rates, volume of blood transfusion, hospital stay, numbers of operation and
      mortality among the 3 groups. CONCLUSIONS: After initial hemostasis had been
      obtained, patients with peptic ulcer bleeding receiving 40 mg intravenous bolus
      every 6 hours had the highest intragastric pH. However, they had similar outcomes
      with the other 2 groups.

TI  - Use of omeprazole in the management of giant duodenal ulcer: results of a
      prospective study.
PG  - 643-8; discussion 648-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Giant duodenal ulcer (GDU) is generally thought to require surgical
      intervention. Proton pump inhibitors have beneficial effects in peptic ulcer
      disease, but their role in GDU disease is unknown. We examined the use of
      omeprazole in GDU management. METHODS: Twenty-eight patients were diagnosed with 
      GDU. One patient required immediate operative intervention. The remaining 27 were
      placed on omeprazole (40 mg daily). When ulcer healing was documented by
      endoscopy, the patients were placed on oral histamine-2 receptor antagonist
      therapy. RESULTS: Of the 28 study patients, 20 (71.4%) did not require operative 
      intervention, and 8 (28.6%) required operation for ulcer complications. Of the 15
      patients with adherent clot or a visible vessel at initial endoscopy, 7 (46.7%)
      required operative intervention, as compared with 1 (7.7%) of the 13 patients
      without a visible vessel or adherent clot. This difference was statistically
      significant (P < .05). Twenty-three patients underwent antral biopsy and/or
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for Helicobacter pylori, and 9 (39.1%) had a
      positive result. CONCLUSIONS: Omeprazole is effective in the treatment of GDU
      disease. An adherent clot or a visible vessel at endoscopy indicates a higher
      likelihood of complications requiring operation. The relatively low H pylori
      infection rate, as compared with other peptic ulcer disease, may indicate a
      different pathophysiology in GDU.

TI  - Lack of drug interaction between omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole and
      theophylline.
PG  - 438-44
AB  - AIMS: Theophylline is a model substrate of cytochrome P4501A2. The ability of the
      proton pump inhibitors (PPI) omeprazole, lansoprazole and pantoprazole to induce 
      cytochrome P4501A2 has not yet been unequivocally resolved. The aim of this
      comprehensive study was to compare directly the effect of the three PPI on the
      absorption and disposition of theophylline. METHODS: Twenty healthy, nonsmoking, 
      male and female volunteers (extensive metabolisers of cytochrome P4502C19 and
      Helicobacter pylori negative) participated in a randomized, double-blind,
      four-period, placebo-controlled crossover study. In each of the four periods they
      received either omeprazole (40 mg), lansoprazole (60 mg), pantoprazole (80 mg) or
      placebo once daily for 10 days. Sustained release theophylline (350 mg twice
      daily) was coadministered from day 8-10. Pharmacokinetics of theophylline as well
      as of all three PPI were determined at steady-state (day 10). RESULTS: In all
      periods, point estimates and 90% confidence intervals of the area under the
      concentration-time curves (AUC), maximum steady-state concentrations and
      peak-trough fluctuations of theophylline were not altered by PPI pretreatment and
      met the required limits for bioequivalence. Point estimates (90% confidence
      intervals) of the AUC ratios of theophylline plus PPI to theophylline alone were 
      0.92 (0.87-0.97), 0.90 (0.85-0.95) and 1.00 (0.95-1.06) for omeprazole,
      lansoprazole and pantoprazole, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant intake of
      omeprazole, lansoprazole or pantoprazole at high therapeutic doses does not
      affect the absorption and disposition of theophylline.

TI  - Prevalence of resistance to clarithromycin and its clinical impact on the
      efficacy of Helicobacter pylori eradication.
PG  - 750-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Triple therapy with a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) in combination with
      metronidazole and clarithromycin is the method of choice for eradication of
      Helicobacter pylori. Failures have been primarily blamed on the development of
      resistance to clarithromycin. The present study investigated the prevalence and
      clinical significance of resistance to clarithromycin and metronidazole in
      determining therapeutic success of both triple therapy as a primary eradication
      method and high-dose dual therapy in non-responders. METHODS: On the basis of
      prior therapy, H. pylori-positive patients were assigned to one of two groups in 
      the present prospective study. Group A (n = 93) included patients who had not
      undergone any prior eradication treatment, whereas group B (n = 15) consisted of 
      patients who had received clarithromycin but in whom eradication had been
      unsuccessful. All patients underwent endoscopy with biopsy for bacterial culture 
      and resistance studies. Patients in group A were treated with a 7-day regimen of 
      pantoprazole (40 mg twice daily), metronidazole (500 mg twice daily), and
      clarithromycin (250 mg twice daily), whereas those in group B received omeprazole
      (40 mg three times a day) and amoxycillin (1000 mg three times a day ) for 14
      days. Success of the eradication treatment was ascertained by means of the 13C
      urea breath test. RESULTS: In group A resistance to clarithromycin and
      metronidazole was identified in 3 patients (4.9%) and in 14 patients (22.9%),
      respectively. Eradication proved successful in 78 of 84 patients (92.6%) followed
      up. Two of the 3 patients with primary clarithromycin resistance and 1 of the 14 
      patients with metronidazole resistance did not respond to treatment. In group B
      isolated or combined resistance to clarithromycin was found in seven patients,
      whereas another four showed isolated resistance to metronidazole. Eradication
      proved successful in 10 of 13 controlled patients (76.9%) followed up, and only 2
      patients reported severe side effects. CONCLUSION: Determination of antibiotic
      resistance before initiating therapy is not necessary, since primary resistance
      to clarithromycin is rare. The Italian triple therapy remains a highly effective 
      primary therapeutic method. Further, routine determination of resistance in
      non-responders also seems to be superfluous because high-dose dual therapy is an 
      effective and well-tolerated second-line therapy regardless of the patients'
      resistance status.

TI  - 24-h recording of intragastric pH: technical aspects and clinical relevance.
PG  - 9-16
AB  - BACKGROUND: Information about gastric acid secretion and gastric acidity can be
      obtained using several techniques but, presently, continuous intragastric pH
      recording is probably the one applied most frequently. This paper aims to review 
      the technical aspects and some important applications of intragastric pH
      monitoring in research and clinical practice. METHODS: Literature review.
      RESULTS: Most studies on intragastric pH are performed with either glass or
      antimony electrodes. Optimal measurement of 24-h intragastric pH requires
      accurate calibration of the pH measuring system, exact positioning of the pH
      electrodes, and a sufficient sample rate. Depending on the aim of the study the
      results of intragastric pH monitoring are expressed either as median H+ activity 
      or as median pH values. Gastric acidity shows a circadian rhythm, modified by
      buffering meals and nocturnal duodenogastric reflux. In health, age, gender and
      smoking habits are known to influence gastric acidity. In duodenal ulcer disease 
      an increased gastric acidity is found and in patients with gastric ulcer gastric 
      acidity is decreased. In GERD, no relation between reflux oesophagitis and
      gastric acidity is found. Helicobacter pylori affects intragastric pH most
      pronounced during acid inhibitory therapy, both in DU patients and in healthy
      subjects. In the absence of H. pylori the effect of proton-pump inhibitors on
      intragastric pH is much less than in the presence of the microorganism, whereas
      the effect of ranitidine on intragastric pH is barely affected by the H. pylori
      status. CONCLUSIONS: Despite some limitations, intragastric pH monitoring
      provides important information about gastric acidity.

TI  - Local treatment of early cancer in short Barrett's esophagus by means of argon
      plasma coagulation: initial experience.
PG  - 497-500
AB  - In recent years endoscopically controlled local therapeutic methods, such as
      photodynamic therapy, mucosectomy, or laser therapy, have been used with a
      curative aim for the destruction of early esophageal or gastric cancers. We
      report on our experience of treating histologically proven mucosal cancer in
      Barrett's esophagus with argon plasma coagulation (APC), in three patients. All
      the mucosal esophageal cancers, with a mean diameter of 4 mm, were successfully
      destroyed after one or two treatment sessions. Additionally, in two of the three 
      patients the specialized columnar epithelium was replaced by normal squamous cell
      epithelium when APC treatment was combined with omeprazole. In the third patient 
      with Barrett's esophagus, a partial squamous cell re-epithelialization was
      induced. No method-related mortality and morbidity were observed. During the mean
      follow-up of 24.3 +/- 1.1 months (range 23-25 months) one tumor recurrence
      developed which was successfully treated with photodynamic therapy. In patients
      with small early Barrett's carcinoma APC might offer an effective, minimally
      invasive alternative to mucosectomy or photodynamic therapy, as the treatment
      procedure is less cumbersome and the equipment less expensive.

TI  - The cost-effectiveness of the omeprazole test in patients with noncardiac chest
      pain.
PG  - 219-27
AB  - PURPOSE: Recent evidence suggests that an empiric trial of omeprazole (the
      "omeprazole test") is sensitive and specific for diagnosing gastroesophageal
      reflux disease (GERD) as the cause of noncardiac chest pain. Our objective was to
      examine the clinical, economic, and policy implications of alternative diagnostic
      strategies for patients with noncardiac chest pain. METHODS: Decision analysis
      was used to evaluate the clinical and economic outcomes of two diagnostic
      strategies that begin with the omeprazole test (60 mg daily for 7 days) followed 
      sequentially by invasive testing utilizing endoscopy, ambulatory 24-hour
      esophageal pH monitoring, and esophageal manometry as necessary, compared with
      two traditional strategies involving sequential invasive diagnostic tests. Cost
      estimates were based on Medicare reimbursement and the Red Book of average
      wholesale drug prices. Probability estimates were derived from a systematic
      review of the medical literature. RESULTS: The average cost per patient for the
      four diagnostic strategies varied from $1,859 to $2,313. Strategies utilizing the
      initial omeprazole test resulted in 84% of patients being symptom free at 1 year,
      compared with 73% to 74% for the strategies that began with invasive tests. The
      strategy of the omeprazole test, followed if necessary by ambulatory pH
      monitoring, then manometry, and then endoscopy, was both most effective and least
      expensive. It led to an 11% improvement in diagnostic accuracy and a 43%
      reduction in the use of invasive diagnostic tests, thus yielding an average cost 
      savings of $454 per patient, compared with the strategy of beginning with
      endoscopy, then pH monitoring, and then manometry. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients
      with noncardiac chest pain, diagnostic strategies that begin with the omeprazole 
      test result in reduced costs, improved diagnostic certainty, and a greater
      proportion of symptom-free patients at 1 year than do traditional strategies that
      begin with invasive diagnostic tests.

TI  - Review article: drug interactions with agents used to treat acid-related
      diseases.
PG  - 18-26
AB  - Patients with acid-related diseases often need to take multiple medications.
      Treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection often includes either a histamine type
      2 (H2)-receptor antagonist or a proton pump (H+,K(+)-ATPase) inhibitor (proton
      pump inhibitor), administered in conjunction with one or more antimicrobials.
      Also, treatment for acid-related diseases often requires extended therapy during 
      which many concomitant medications may be administered for concurrent disease
      states. Polypharmacy may be the result, particularly in elderly patients, who are
      at increased risk for both acid-related and many other diseases. Thus, it is
      important to understand the potential for clinically significant drug-drug
      interactions in this setting. H2-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors 
      can influence the pharmacokinetic profiles of other commonly administered
      medications by elevating intragastric pH, which can alter drug absorption, and by
      interacting with the cytochrome P (CYP) 450 enzyme system, which can affect drug 
      metabolism and clearance. Such interactions are particularly important when they 
      affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs with narrow therapeutic ranges (e.g.
      warfarin, digoxin). In these cases, drug-drug interactions can result in
      significant toxicity and even death. There are marked differences among
      H2-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors in their potential for such
      interactions. The oldest drugs in each class, cimetidine and omeprazole,
      respectively, have the greatest potential to alter CYP activity and change the
      pharmacokinetics of other drugs. The most recently developed H2-receptor
      antagonist, famotidine, and the newer proton pump inhibitors, rabeprazole and
      pantoprazole, are much less likely to induce or inhibit CYP and thereby change
      the metabolism of other medications. These differences are important when
      choosing medications for the safe treatment of patients with acid-related
      diseases.

TI  - Morphometric estimation of acid output in duodenal ulcer associated with
      Helicobacter pylori infection.
PG  - 549-58
AB  - OBJECTIVE: to determine the changes in acid output before and after eradication
      therapy in patients with duodenal ulcer associated with Helicobacter pylori
      infection. METHOD: the subjects of this prospective study were 16 patients with
      acute duodenal ulcer at endoscopy and H. pylori infection determined by rapid
      urease test and histology. They were randomly assigned to receive treatment with 
      pantoprazole 40 mg b.i.d., clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d. and amoxicillin 1 g
      b.i.d. during 7 or 14 days. Endoscopic examination and biopsy were repeated 4
      weeks after treatment ended. The changes in acid output before and after
      treatment were calculated by the morphometric quantification of parietal cell
      canaliculi from the gastric corpus. To this end 20 parietal cells from the medial
      glandular zone were selected and canalicular index was calculated, before and
      after eradication therapy, with a morphometric method based on automatic analysis
      of histological images. RESULTS: canalicular index was 26.4 +/- 1.4 (mean +/-
      standard error of the mean) before treatment, and 20.5 +/- 1 (p < 0.01) after
      therapy. CONCLUSIONS: morphometric analysis showed a decrease in acid output in
      patients with duodenal ulcer associated with H. pylori infection 4 weeks after
      eradication therapy with clarithromycin, amoxicillin and pantoprazole.

TI  - Endoscopic regression of Barrett's oesophagus during omeprazole treatment; a
      randomised double blind study.
PG  - 489-94
AB  - BACKGROUND: Barrett's oesophagus, columnar metaplasia of the epithelium, is a
      premalignant condition with a 50-100-fold increased risk of cancer. The condition
      is caused by chronic gastro-oesophageal reflux. Regression of metaplasia may
      decrease the cancer risk. AIMS: To determine whether elimination of acid
      gastro-oesophageal reflux induces a regression of metaplastic epithelium.
      METHODS: Sixty eight patients with acid reflux and proven Barrett's oesophagus
      were included in a prospective, randomised, double blind study with parallel
      groups, and were treated with profound acid secretion suppression with omeprazole
      40 mg twice daily, or with mild acid secretion suppression with ranitidine 150 mg
      twice daily, for 24 months. Endoscopy was performed at 0, 3, 9, 15, and 24 months
      with measurement of length and surface area of Barrett's oesophagus; pH-metry was
      performed at 0 and 3 months. Per protocol analysis was performed on 26 patients
      treated with omeprazole, and 27 patients treated with ranitidine. RESULTS:
      Omeprazole reduced reflux to 0.1%, ranitidine to 9.4% per 24 hours. Symptoms were
      ameliorated in both groups. There was a small, but statistically significant
      regression of Barrett's oesophagus in the omeprazole group, both in length and in
      area. No change was observed in the ranitidine group. The difference between the 
      regression in the omeprazole and ranitidine group was statistically significant
      for the area of Barrett's oesophagus (p=0. 02), and showed a trend in the same
      direction for the length of Barrett's oesophagus (p=0.06). CONCLUSIONS: Profound 
      suppression of acid secretion, leading to elimination of acid reflux, induces
      partial regression of Barrett's oesophagus.

TI  - Lack of pharmacokinetic interaction between oral pantoprazole and cisapride in
      healthy adults.
PG  - 945-50
AB  - Pantoprazole, an irreversible proton pump inhibitor, may be administered with
      cisapride, a prokinetic agent. As increased cisapride concentrations may result
      in longer electrocardiogram (ECG) QTc intervals, a crossover study was conducted 
      in healthy subjects to evaluate the oral pharmacokinetic interaction between
      cisapride (20 mg) and pantoprazole (40 mg). After dosing, serial blood samples
      and 12-lead ECGs were collected, and cisapride plasma concentrations were
      quantitated. For cisapride alone, mean parameter values were the following: peak 
      concentration (Cmax), 56 ng/mL; time to Cmax (tmax), 1.7 hours; area under the
      concentration-time curve (AUC), 426 ng x h/mL; and terminal half-life (t1/2), 5.8
      hours. Pantoprazole coadministration did not alter cisapride AUC or other
      pharmacokinetic parameters except for a slight 17% decrease in Cmax' resulting in
      90% confidence limits of 79% to 88%, which were marginally outside strict
      bioequivalence limits. In addition, cisapride did not affect ECG QTc intervals,
      with or without pantoprazole. Therefore, no dosage adjustment is needed when
      pantoprazole and cisapride are coadministered.

TI  - Rabeprazole: pharmacokinetics and tolerability in patients with stable, end-stage
      renal failure.
PG  - 927-33
AB  - The authors compare the pharmacokinetic profiles, safety, and tolerability of
      rabeprazole, a new proton pump inhibitor (PPI), in healthy volunteers and in
      subjects with stable, end-stage renal failure. This single-center, open-label
      trial included two groups of subjects: 10 healthy males with 24-hour creatinine
      clearance > or = 90 mL/min/m2 and 10 males with renal failure (24-hour creatinine
      clearance < or = 5 mL/min/m2) receiving hemodialytic therapy. Normal subjects
      received a single, oral 20 mg rabeprazole dose. Those with renal failure received
      a 20 mg dose of rabeprazole on the day after hemodialysis and a second dose after
      a 2-week washout period during dialysis. Blood samples were drawn before and up
      to 24 hours after rabeprazole administration for determination of plasma
      rabeprazole concentrations by high-performance liquid chromatography. Safety and 
      tolerability of rabeprazole were determined by reporting adverse events and
      comparing vital signs, ECG, physical examinations, and clinical laboratory tests 
      before and during treatment. Comparison of pharmacokinetic results from healthy
      volunteers with those from subjects with renal failure indicated no clinically
      significant differences between groups. In addition, there were no statistically 
      significant differences between any pharmacokinetic parameters recorded during or
      after hemodialysis. Rabeprazole was well tolerated by both groups. Only two
      drug-related adverse events were reported, and there were no significant
      treatment-emergent changes in vital signs or ECG. Treatment-emergent changes in
      hematologic and clinical chemistry parameters were observed for a few subjects in
      each group and generally represented only slight deviations from the normal
      range. These results indicate that no dosage adjustment of rabeprazole is
      required in patients with renal dysfunction. These findings and the
      well-documented clinical efficacy of this new PPI in patients with gastric
      ulcers, duodenal ulcers, or gastroesophageal reflux disease support rabeprazole's
      use in the treatment of patients with acid peptic disorders.

TI  - Post-prandial ranitidine is superior to post-prandial omeprazole in control of
      gastric acidity in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 1211-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Episodic heartburn is a common problem, affecting over 40 million
      Americans. Although omeprazole provides excellent acid suppression when used
      daily, the use of omeprazole as on-demand therapy for episodic symptoms has not
      been extensively studied. AIM: To compare the onset and duration of post-prandial
      gastric acid suppression by omeprazole (10 and 20 mg) or ranitidine (75 and 150
      mg) taken as single doses in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Twenty-four healthy
      volunteers (14 male, 10 female, mean age 33.4 years, range 18-56 years) were
      given ranitidine (RAN) 75 mg or 150 mg vs. omeprazole (OME) 10 mg or 20 mg when
      pH returned to below 2 after breakfast, in a randomized open label crossover
      design, with a washout of at least 2 days between medications. Intragastric pH
      was monitored for 6 h. The time between drug ingestion and rise of gastric pH > 3
      and 4, and total time pH remained > 3 and 4 during the 6 h post drug, was
      compared between groups using two way ANOVA and Wilcoxon matched pairs test.
      RESULTS: The median time needed to pH > 4 was 204.5 min for RAN 75 mg, 186 min
      for RAN 150 mg and > 360 min for both OME 10 and 20 mg (P < 0.001 between the
      four groups). The median time that pH remained > 4 was 93 min for RAN 75 mg,
      143.5 min for RAN 150 mg and 0 min for both OME 10 and 20 mg (P < 0.001 between
      the four groups). Both doses of RAN were significantly superior to both doses of 
      OME, although no significant difference was found between the high and the low
      doses of either drugs. Similar results were found for pH > 3. CONCLUSION:
      Ranitidine 75 or 150 mg provides more rapid increase in gastric pH to > 3 and > 4
      compared to omeprazole 10 or 20 mg when taken at the end of the post-prandial
      period. These data suggest that ranitidine may be more effective for episodic
      post-prandial heartburn than omeprazole.

TI  - The effects of oral rabeprazole on endocrine and gastric secretory function in
      healthy volunteers.
PG  - 1195-203
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the short-term effects of rabeprazole 20 mg on endocrine
      parameters, in particular serum testosterone and cortisol, and on 24 h
      intragastric pH, H+ activity and nocturnal gastric acid secretion. METHODS: In
      this double-blind, two-period crossover study, 12 healthy young male volunteers
      were randomly given oral rabeprazole 20 mg o.m. or placebo for 14 days. There was
      a washout period of at least 1 week between the two studies. The effects of
      rabeprazole and placebo on cortisol and testosterone (primary criteria), and on
      tri-iodothyronine, thyroxine, 17beta-oestradiol, thyroid-stimulating hormone,
      thyroxine-binding protein, parathyroid hormone, insulin, glucagon, rennin,
      aldosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteotrophic hormone, prolactin,
      somatotrophic hormone, dehydroepiandrosterone, cortisol-binding globulin and
      urinary 6-beta hydroxycortisol were compared. Intragastric 24 h pH, 24 h H+
      activity and nocturnal gastric acid secretion were determined by pH probe and
      gastric aspiration. RESULTS: Rabeprazole produced no clinically relevant effects 
      on endocrine function as assessed by measurement of serum testosterone, circadian
      serum cortisol levels, ACTH-stimulated serum cortisol levels and 17 other
      endocrine function tests. Rabeprazole significantly increased the 24 h median pH 
      values compared to placebo (on Days 7 and 14 median values ranged from 3.92 to
      6.88 with rabeprazole and from 1.48 and 4.22 with placebo, P < 0.001) and
      significantly decreased the integrated 24 h H+ activity (AUC08--08) from 343
      mmol/L/h with placebo to 44 mmol/L/h with rabeprazole (P < 0.001). Following
      cessation of dosing, intragastric pH levels decreased and H+ activity increased, 
      but acid secretion did not recover completely during the next 72 h. The mean
      value for nocturnal gastric acid secretion on Days 7 and 8 was 36 mmol/6 h with
      placebo and 5.6 mmol/6 h with rabeprazole (P < 0.001). Rabeprazole was well
      tolerated. CONCLUSION: Rabeprazole did not influence endocrine function in
      healthy young male volunteers during short-term dosing. Rabeprazole substantially
      increased intragastric pH over a 24 h period and significantly decreased
      intragastric acidity and nocturnal gastric acid secretion.

TI  - One-week ranitidine bismuth citrate in combinations with metronidazole,
      amoxycillin and clarithromycin in the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection:
      the RBC-MACH study.
PG  - 1079-84
AB  - BACKGROUND: We have previously shown that ranitidine bismuth citrate (RBC)-based 
      triple therapy is comparable to proton pump inhibitor-based triple therapy in
      eradicating Helicobacter pylori infection. AIM: To test the efficacy of different
      combinations of antimicrobials with RBC in the treatment of H. pylori infection. 
      METHODS: Dyspeptic patients with H. pylori infection were prospectively
      randomized to receive one of the following regimens: (i) RBC 400 mg, amoxycillin 
      1 g, clarithromycin 500 mg [RAC]; (ii) RBC 400 mg, metronidazole 400 mg,
      clarithromycin 500 mg [RMC]; (iii) RBC 400 mg, metronidazole 400 mg, tetracycline
      1 g [RMT] (all given twice daily for 1 week); or (iv) RBC 400 mg plus
      clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily for 2 weeks [RC-2]. Endoscopy (rapid urease
      test and culture) and 13C-urea breath test (UBT) were performed before
      randomization. Four weeks after finishing medication, the 13C-UBT was repeated in
      all cases and endoscopy was offered to patients with peptic ulcers. RESULTS: Four
      hundred patients were randomized but in two (one in the RAC group and one in the 
      RMC group) H. pylori infection was not confirmed. Successful eradication of H.
      pylori (intention-to-treat analysis and 95% CI) of RAC (86% [79-93%]), RMC (90%
      [84-96%]), RMT (79% [71-87%]) and RC-2 (82% [75-90%]) were comparable, with a
      trend favouring clarithromycin-containing triple therapy regimens. Among 276
      isolates tested for antibiotic sensitivity, primary resistance to metronidazole, 
      clarithromycin and amoxycillin was found in 56%, 2% and 0.4%, respectively. When 
      given RMC or RMT, patients infected by metronidazole-resistant H. pylori had
      success in eradicating H. pylori similar to patients infected by
      metronidazole-sensitive H. pylori. CONCLUSION: One-week RBC triple therapy is
      effective in curing H. pylori infection.

TI  - Comparison of ranitidine bismuth citrate plus clarithromycin with omeprazole plus
      clarithromycin for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori.
PG  - 1071-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many dual and triple therapy treatment regimens have been proposed
      for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori. However, assessing the relative
      efficacy of these regimens is complicated by differences in study design, and few
      well-controlled comparative studies have been reported. METHODS: This
      multicentre, randomized, double-blind study involved 530 duodenal ulcer patients,
      of whom 520 had confirmed H. pylori infection. Patients received 14 days b.d.
      dual therapy of either ranitidine bismuth citrate (RBC) 400 mg or omeprazole 20
      mg, both with clarithromycin 500 mg to eradicate H. pylori, followed by a further
      14 days of treatment with RBC 400 mg b. d. or omeprazole 20 mg o.d. to facilitate
      ulcer healing. H. pylori eradication and ulcer healing were assessed at least 26 
      days after the end of treatment. Adverse events were recorded throughout the
      study. RESULTS: H. pylori was eradicated in 90% of patients who received RBC with
      clarithromycin and in 66% of patients who received omeprazole with clarithromycin
      (per protocol; P<0.001). intention-to-treat eradication rates were 77% and 60%,
      respectively (P<0.001). Ulcer healing rates were 97% in the RBC treatment group
      and 95% in the omeprazole treatment group. Only 3% and 1% of patients in the RBC 
      and omeprazole treatment groups, respectively, were withdrawn due to adverse
      events. CONCLUSIONS: RBC with clarithromycin is a simple and highly effective
      dual therapy regimen for the eradication of H. pylori, and is significantly more 
      effective than omeprazole with clarithromycin. Both treatment regimens are well
      tolerated and effectively heal duodenal ulcers.

TI  - Famotidine versus omeprazole in combination with clarithromycin and metronidazole
      for eradication of Helicobacter pylori--a randomized, controlled trial.
PG  - 1063-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: One-week low-dose triple therapy is currently considered the gold
      standard regimen for treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection. However, the
      mechanisms involved in the synergy between antibiotics and proton pump inhibitors
      are controversial. AIMS: To test the hypothesis that acid suppression represents 
      the crucial mechanism by which the antibacterial activity of antibiotics can be
      enhanced, and to assess the impact of primary resistance on treatment outcome.
      METHODS: One hundred and twenty patients with H. pylori infection and duodenal
      ulcer, gastric ulcer or non-ulcer dyspepsia were randomly assigned to a 1 week
      course of either famotidine 80 mg b.d., clarithromycin 250 mg b.d. and
      metronidazole 500 mg b.d. (FCM group; n = 60) or omeprazole 20 mg o.d.,
      clarithromycin 250 mg b.d. and metronidazole 500 mg b.d. (OCM group; n = 60).
      Gastroscopy was performed at baseline and 5 weeks after completion of treatment. 
      H. pylori status was assessed by biopsy urease test, histology and culture.
      RESULTS: In the intention-to-treat analysis, eradication of H. pylori was
      achieved in 47 of 60 patients (78%; 95% CI: 66-88%) in the FCM group, compared to
      44 of 60 patients (73%; 95% CI: 60-84%) in the OCM group (N.S.). Using per
      protocol analysis, eradication therapy was successful in 47 of 52 patients (90%; 
      95% CI: 79-97%) treated with FCM and 44 of 57 patients (77%; 95% CI: 64-87%)
      treated with OCM (N.S.). Primary metronidazole resistance was present in 27% and 
      primary clarithromycin resistance in 8% of strains. Overall per protocol
      eradication rates in strains susceptible to both antibiotics and strains with
      isolated metronidazole resistance were 93% and 84%, respectively. No patient with
      clarithromycin resistance responded to treatment. CONCLUSIONS: High-dose
      famotidine and omeprazole, combined with clarithromycin and metronidazole, are
      equally effective for eradication of H. pylori. In 1-week low-dose triple
      therapy, metronidazole resistance has no major impact on eradication rates
      whereas clarithromycin resistance is associated with a poor treatment outcome.

TI  - Omeprazole therapy decreases the need for dilatation of peptic oesophageal
      strictures.
PG  - 1041-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Better control of gastric acid secretion with omeprazole appeared to 
      decrease the need for dilatation of oesophageal strictures complicating
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in our hospital-based endoscopy service. AIM:
      To investigate whether the perceived decrease in the need for oesophageal
      dilatation could be documented from endoscopy records, and, if confirmed, whether
      this could be related to the treatment used. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective 
      study of the records of 69 patients who had peptic oesophageal strictures
      dilated, followed by treatment with acid inhibition for at least 6 months. Mean
      duration of follow-up was 3.9 years during treatment with H2-receptor antagonists
      and 2.1 years while on omeprazole (258 and 78 patient-years, respectively).
      Re-dilatation rates were compared between those treated with H2-receptor
      antagonists or omeprazole. RESULTS: There has been a significant decrease in
      dilatations performed for gastro-oesophageal reflux induced strictures (P<0.001),
      while dilatation rates for other indications remained constant. Treatment with
      omeprazole not only decreased the need for further dilatations, but also
      prolonged the mean time between any further dilatations to 26.3 months compared
      to 9.3 months for those on an H2-receptor antagonist (P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS:
      Following dilatation of peptic oesophageal strictures, treatment with omeprazole 
      in place of an H2-blocker significantly decreases the need for repeat dilatation.

TI  - On demand therapy of reflux oesophagitis--a prospective study of symptoms,
      patient satisfaction and quality of life.
PG  - 1035-40
AB  - BACKGROUND: In patients with low-grade reflux oesophagitis adequate symptom
      control is the aim of treatment. Effervescent tablets alleviate heartburn more
      rapidly than ordinary tablets. AIM: To investigate symptom control, patient
      satisfaction, health-related quality of life and disease progress when ranitidine
      150 mg effervescent tablets were offered as on demand treatment. We also wanted
      to investigate whether any biological or psycho-social factor could predict
      patient satisfaction. METHOD: Consecutive patients with endoscopically verified
      reflux oesophagitis grade I-II were followed up for 12 months. 24 h pH-metry,
      disease history, symptoms and several psycho-social factors were registered at
      baseline and 12 months follow-up. RESULTS: Eighty-one patients were included.
      Mean age was 50.7 years (range 21-82), 63% were men. Mean tablet consumption was 
      1.21 per day (range 7-1016 tablets/year). At the 1-year follow-up discomfort
      resulting from reflux symptoms was significantly reduced (P<0.001), and the
      patients' social and vocational life improved. Eighty-four percentage of the
      patients were satisfied with the treatment. 24 h pH-metry or number of reflux
      episodes did not change. We did not find any factors able to predict patient
      satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: On demand therapy with ranitidine effervescent tablets
      was well accepted by the majority of patients with reflux oesophagitis grade I.
      Even though the number of reflux episodes did not change, the patients
      experienced less discomfort due to reflux symptoms, and their social and
      vocational life was better. There was no significant progression of the disorder 
      during the 1-year follow-up. No predictive factor for patient satisfaction was
      found.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of pantoprazole 40 mg daily as relapse prophylaxis in
      patients with healed reflux oesophagitis-a 2-year follow-up.
PG  - 1023-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pantoprazole is a benzimidazole derivative which selectively inhibits
      the proton pump H+, K+-ATPase, necessary for the final step in gastric acid
      secretion. AIM: To assess safety and efficacy of oral pantoprazole (40 mg o.d.)
      used as a prophylaxis against relapse in patients with healed reflux oesophagitis
      during an open-label, 2-year study. METHODS: Outpatients (n=157) with healed
      stage II or III reflux oesophagitis (Savary-Miller classification) were enrolled 
      into a long-term, multicentre maintenance study. Endoscopy was performed at entry
      into the study, after 12 and 24 months, or when disease-specific symptoms
      occurred on more than three consecutive days. Symptoms were assessed at 3-monthly
      intervals. Endoscopically confirmed relapses (at least stage I) were evaluated as
      treatment failures. RESULTS: Of the 178 adverse events, experienced by 88 (56%)
      patients (intention-to-treat population), 12 (7%) were assessed by the
      investigators as possibly related to the study medication. Median serum gastrin
      levels increased from a baseline of 46 ng/L to 90 ng/L, reaching a plateau after 
      9 months. For the intention-to-treat population the endoscopic remission rates
      after 12 and 24 months were 87% and 76%, respectively (Life-Table survival
      analysis, Kaplan-Meier). CONCLUSION: Pantoprazole 40 mg proved to be safe and
      efficacious during a 2-year prophylaxis treatment in patients with healed reflux 
      oesophagitis.

TI  - The effect of omeprazole on gastro-oesophageal reflux and symptoms during
      strenuous exercise.
PG  - 1015-22
AB  - BACKGROUND: Strenuous exercise exacerbates gastro-oesophageal reflux and symptoms
      and this may be diminished by antisecretory medication with omeprazole. METHODS: 
      Fourteen well-trained athletes (13 men, one woman), who indicated suffering from 
      either heartburn, regurgitation or chest pain during competition running,
      performed two experimental trials at 2-week intervals using a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design. During the 6 days preceding
      the trial and on the trial day itself either 20 mg of omeprazole or a placebo was
      administered. Two hours after a low-fat breakfast and 1 h after the last study
      dose, the trial started with five successive 50-min periods: rest, three running 
      periods on a treadmill, and recovery. Reflux (percentage time and number of
      periods oesophageal pH <4) was measured with an ambulant pH system during these
      periods. RESULTS: Compared to rest, reflux lasted significantly longer and
      occurred more frequently during the first running period, irrespective of the
      intervention, whereas during the second running period this effect was only
      observed with the placebo. Reflux occurred for longer and more frequently with
      the placebo than with omeprazole, but this was significant during the first two
      running periods only. Seven subjects reported heartburn, regurgitation and/or
      chest pain during exercise, irrespective of the intervention. Only a minority of 
      the symptom periods was actually associated with acid reflux and in all cases
      this concerned periods with heartburn. CONCLUSIONS: Running-induced acid reflux, 
      but not symptoms, were decreased by omeprazole, probably because most symptoms
      were not related to acid reflux.

TI  - Is a proton pump inhibitor necessary for the treatment of lower-grade reflux
      esophagitis?
PG  - 435-40
AB  - The efficacy of histamine H2 receptor antagonist (H2RA) and proton pump inhibitor
      (PPI) therapies in healing reflux esophagitis was compared in a prospective
      randomized case-control comparative study. A total of 71 patients with grade A to
      D esophagitis (Los Angeles classification) were given either famotidine 20 mg
      twice a day (Fam; n = 35) or omeprazole 20 mg once daily (Ome; n = 36) for 8
      weeks. Endoscopy was performed to assess healing in 57 patients. Healed patients 
      were followed-up without H2RA or PPI therapy for 3 months. At the end of
      follow-up, endoscopy was able to be performed in 33 patients. Healing rates for
      patients in the Fam and Ome groups were 58.6% (17/OFF and 97.4% (27/28),
      respectively (P < 0.001), and when limited to grade A to B, healing rates were
      60.9% (14/23) and 100% (25/25), respectively (P < 0.001). Concerning Helicobacter
      pylori infection, healing rates for the Fam and Ome groups in H. pylori (+)
      patients were 90.0% (9/10) and 90.9% (10/11), respectively (P = 1.00). Remission 
      rates in the Fam and Ome groups were 45.0% (91/2)) and 33.3% (6/18), respectively
      (P > 0.4). In regard to alcohol drinking, remission rates of daily and social
      drinkers were 7.7% and 42.4%, respectively (P < 0.03). Thus, PPI should be the
      drug of choice even for healing lower-grade reflux esophagitis, especially in H. 
      pylori (-) patients. Treatment with H2RA may be an alternative choice in H.
      pylori (+) patients. After healing, most patients cannot sustain remission
      without maintenance therapy.

TI  - Relative efficacies of gastric proton pump inhibitors: their clinical and
      pharmacological basis.
PG  - 57-77
AB  - The present review will verify by intra-study rank orders, and their comparison
      between studies, that the different gastric proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) display
      similar dose-response relationships with similar potencies and efficacies on a
      milligram basis, i.e., at the same milligram doses. This is in line with their
      basic pharmacology which suggests that, primarily, the serum AUCs of the free
      pro-drugs and their chemical activation half lives at pH 1 relative to their
      serum elimination half lives determine the efficacies of PPIs. According to the
      literature, these drug characteristics are similar for all PPIs. Although PPIs
      have been introduced into the therapy of acute peptic ulcer disease at different 
      daily, oral doses of 20 mg (omeprazole and rabeprazole), 30 mg (lansoprazole) and
      40 mg (pantoprazole), the data suggest that the optimal dose of lansoprazole,
      omeprazole and pantoprazole, with respect to the acute treatment of peptic ulcers
      and moderate to severe gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), is about 30-40 mg 
      daily. The data base of rabeprazole appears to be too small at present to make
      any definite statement. Lower daily doses of the PPIs of about 15-20 mg are
      sufficient in less severe cases of GERD and in maintenance therapy. It appears
      that different dose recommendations were based on different strategies to balance
      optimal drug dosage and safety, rather than on real differences in
      milligram-related efficacies.

TI  - Antimicrobial treatment for peptic stenosis: a prospective study.
PG  - 731-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Peptic stenosis, a complication of peptic ulcer disease, is treated by
      endoscopic balloon dilation or surgery. However, recent reports showed that
      Helicobacter pylori eradication may resolve peptic stenosis. Thus, we carried out
      a prospective study on a cohort of patients with peptic stenosis and H. pylori
      infection to evaluate the efficacy of anti- H. pylori therapy in the treatment of
      peptic stenosis. DESIGN/METHODS: From May 1995 to May 1998 we studied 22
      consecutive patients with benign peptic stenosis (16 with duodenal stenosis and
      six with pyloric stenosis) and H. pylori infection. Searches for H. pylori were
      made at first diagnosis of peptic stenosis and at every endoscopic control. All
      patients were treated with an anti- H. pylori treatment (13 with
      omeprazole/clarithromycin/ metronidazole and nine with omeprazole/amoxycillin/
      clarithromycin), followed by 8 weeks' therapy with a proton-pump inhibitor.
      Endoscopic controls were performed after the end of H. pylori-eradication
      therapy, at 2 and 6 months, and then every 6 months. RESULTS: H. pylori
      eradication was achieved in all patients. Peptic stenosis disappeared completely 
      in 20/22 cases (17/20 after 2 months and 3/20 after 6 months), and in all these
      patients the symptoms disappeared within 2 months. At the median follow-up of
      12.4 months (range 2-24), the patients remained asymptomatic, without recurrence 
      of the stenosis, and needed no medication. In one patient the stenosis
      disappeared partially and symptoms improved, and it was successfully treated with
      cisapride. In one patient the stenosis did not disappear despite H. pylori
      eradication and continuous proton-pump inhibitor treatment. The patient was
      treated with a liquid diet due to old age, but he died 4 months after H. pylori
      eradication due to stroke. CONCLUSIONS: H. pylori eradication is a safe and
      effective therapy for peptic stenosis. Endoscopic balloon dilation or surgery
      should be used only after failure of this conservative treatment.

TI  - Patients with functional dyspepsia responding to omeprazole have a characteristic
      gastro-oesophageal reflux pattern.
PG  - 575-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of acid secretion inhibitors in patients with functional
      dyspepsia (FD) is equivocal. One previous trial showed an effect in patients with
      a characteristic gastro-oesophageal reflux pattern. This double-blind trial
      compares the number of reflux episodes in responders and non-responders to
      omeprazole. METHODS: Twenty-four patients (men/women, 11:13; mean age, 49 years) 
      with FD were included; those with reflux as the main symptom were excluded. An
      upper endoscopy and a 24-h oesophageal pH measurement were performed before
      randomization to treatment with 10-20 mg omeprazole or placebo for 4 weeks.
      Patients who at questioning considered themselves to have achieved sufficient
      relief of dyspeptic symptoms after 4 weeks were characterized as responders.
      RESULTS: The number of responders in the omeprazole and placebo groups was 8 of
      14 (57%) and 2 of 10 (20%), respectively (P = 0.07). The mean number of reflux
      episodes at the 24-h oesophageal pH measurement in responders and non-responders 
      to omeprazole was 57 and 25, respectively (P < 0.003). In the omeprazole group
      the number of responders was 0 of 5 (0%) in those with < 32 reflux episodes and 8
      of 9 (89%) in those with > 32 reflux episodes (P < 0.003). CONCLUSION: Patients
      with FD responding to omeprazole were characterized by many reflux episodes.

TI  - Effect of 7-day therapy with different doses of the proton pump inhibitor
      lansoprazole on the intragastric pH in healthy human subjects.
PG  - 551-61
AB  - BACKGROUND: Systematic, randomized, and controlled studies on the effect of low
      to high doses of the proton pump inhibitor lansoprazole on intragastric acidity
      and plasma gastrin levels have not previously been performed. METHODS: We
      investigated the effect of 7-day therapy with different doses of lansoprazole (15
      mg once or twice daily, 30 mg once or twice daily, and 15 mg three times daily)
      on intragastric acidity and meal-stimulated daytime plasma gastrin levels in 12
      healthy Helicobacter pylori-negative human subjects in a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6-way crossover study. On days 1, 2, and 7 of
      the study 24-h intragastric pH-metry and 12-h integrated daytime plasma gastrin
      determinations were done. RESULTS: Lansoprazole in a dose regimen of 1 x 30
      mg/day, 3 x 15 mg/daily, and 2 x 30 mg/day significantly (P < 0.05) increased the
      intragastric 24-h median pH on days 1, 2, and 7 of therapy as compared with
      placebo. Lansoprazole in doses of 1 x 15 mg/day and 2 x 15 mg/day significantly
      increased the intragastric 24-h median pH on days 2 and 7 but not on day 1 of
      therapy. Doses of 3 x 15 mg and 2 x 30 mg lansoprazole daily significantly
      increased the intragastric 24-h median pH on days 2 and 7 of treatment as
      compared with 1 x 30 mg lansoprazole daily. Except for 1 x 15 mg lansoprazole on 
      day 1 of therapy, all given dose regimens of lansoprazole (15-60 mg/day)
      significantly (P < 0.05) stimulated the 12-h integrated meal-stimulated daytime
      plasma gastrin response (pM x min) on days 1, 2, and 7 of therapy as compared
      with placebo. CONCLUSION: A dose of 1 x 30 mg/day is nearly as potent as higher
      dose regimens of lansoprazole. Thus it most likely is the optimum dose for
      therapy of gastric and duodenal peptic lesions. A dose of 1 x 15 mg lansoprazole 
      daily is a potent inhibitor of gastric acid output and could be a therapeutic
      dose for prevention of peptic lesions (that is, reflux oesophagitis or ulcers).

      Study Group.
PG  - 1809-15
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: To investigate the efficacy and safety of an intravenous-oral
      regimen using the gastric proton pump inhibitor pantoprazole. METHODOLOGY:
      Outpatients, with endoscopically diagnosed moderate or severe gastro-esophageal
      reflux disease (GERD stage II and III, respectively, Savary-Miller
      classification), were recruited from ten hospitals or private practice centers
      and enrolled into an open-labeled study (intention-to-treat population n=110, age
      20-88 years; per-protocol population n=98). Patients were treated once daily with
      40 mg pantoprazole which was administered as an intravenous injection for the
      initial 5-7 consecutive days, then as a tablet, for up to 8 weeks. The efficacy
      parameters were complete healing of lesions evaluated endoscopically after week 4
      and 8, and relief from symptoms assessed after week 2 and 4. RESULTS: Complete
      healing was achieved in 85/98 (87%) and 93/98 (95%) per-protocol patients, after 
      4 and 8 weeks, respectively. The corresponding results for the intention-to-treat
      population were 85/110 (77%) and 93/110 (85%), respectively. After 2 weeks of
      treatment, heartburn, acid regurgitation, and pain on swallowing resolved in 97%,
      98%, and 100% of the per-protocol patients, respectively. Faster healing was
      observed in non-smokers, those infected with Helicobacter pylori, and those with 
      initial GERD stage II. The intravenous and oral administration phases were well
      tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Pantoprazole (40 mg), applied as an intravenous-oral
      regimen to patients with GERD led to fast resolution of symptoms and high healing
      rates. For patients, temporarily unable to take oral medications, this regimen
      offers safe and reliable gastric acid suppression and allows the possibility of
      changing between the oral and intravenous administration without the need for
      dose adjustment.

TI  - Is the esophageal squamous epithelial barrier function impaired in patients with 
      gastroesophageal reflux disease?
PG  - 454-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: A disturbed epithelial barrier function has been promoted as one
      factor in the pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). We
      therefore studied the effect of acid perfusion on the transmural potential
      difference (PD) of the distal esophagus in relation to onset of reflux symptoms. 
      METHODS: PD was assessed during perfusion with saline and with 0.1 M HCl in
      healthy controls (n = 17) and in GERD patients without (n = 15) or with
      esophagitis (n = 6) and in remission after a fundoplication (n = 10). Heartburn
      and other upper GI symptoms were recorded concomitantly. Endoscopy-negative
      patients were studied before and after omeprazole treatment. RESULTS: HCl
      perfusion induced more lumennegative peak PD values in patients with active GERD,
      regardless of the presence or absence of esophagitis, than in healthy controls.
      After successful therapy, the PD response to acid perfusion equalled that of
      healthy subjects. Acid perfusion was associated with the onset of heartburn in
      most patients with active GERD but in none of the healthy subjects, and less
      frequently after medical and surgical therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The epithelial
      permeability to hydrogen ions differs between healthy subjects and patients with 
      active GERD. Effective treatment, such as omeprazole or fundoplication, might
      improve the barrier function.

TI  - Lack of effect of acid suppression therapy on gastric atrophy. Nordic Gerd Study 
      Group.
PG  - 319-26
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: A hypothesis suggesting that profound acid inhibition therapy 
      facilitates and hastens the development of gastric glandular atrophy in patients 
      infected with Helicobacter pylori was investigated in this randomized study
      comparing omeprazole therapy with antireflux surgery (ARS) for chronic
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). METHODS: Patients with esophagitis and/or
      chronic GERD were enrolled; 155 patients were randomized to ARS and 155 to
      long-term omeprazole therapy. Baseline data were obtained and repeated after 3
      years in 131 ARS patients and in 139 omeprazole-treated patients. Histopathologic
      status of the oxyntic mucosa was assessed according to the Sydney system.
      RESULTS: Forty omeprazole-treated patients were infected with H. pylori compared 
      with 53 in the ARS group. Basal gastrin levels were significantly higher in H.
      pylori-infected patients, particularly in the omeprazole group. No further
      increases in serum gastrin levels were observed during 3 years. Despite 3 years
      of therapy, only slight changes were found in the prevalence of inflammation in
      the corpus mucosa of H. pylori-infected subjects. A slow progression of gastric
      glandular atrophy was observed in these patients irrespective of therapy with no 
      obvious difference between treatment regimens. Intestinal metaplasia (all of type
      I) was only exceptionally observed with no difference between the treatment arms.
      CONCLUSIONS: Acid-suppressive therapy in the form of omeprazole maintained for 3 
      years facilitates neither the development of gastric glandular atrophy of the
      corpus mucosa nor the occurrence of intestinal metaplasia in H. pylori-infected
      GERD patients.

TI  - Quality of life in patients with heartburn but without esophagitis: effects of
      treatment with omeprazole.
PG  - 1782-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Because improvement in quality of life (QoL) is an important
      therapeutic goal in patients with heartburn but without esophagitis, the aim of
      the present study was to compare the impact of omeprazole 20 mg or 10 mg daily
      with that of placebo on QoL in patients with heartburn as the predominant
      symptom. METHODS: QoL was measured at baseline and after 4 wk using two validated
      questionnaires, the Psychological General Well-Being (PGWB) index and the
      Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale. RESULTS: The two questionnaires were
      completed by 163 patients in the omeprazole 20 mg group, 163 in the omeprazole 10
      mg group, and 82 in the placebo group. The reflux dimension of the
      Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale showed a significant improvement in terms
      of reflux symptoms on omeprazole 20 mg versus omeprazole 10 mg and placebo, and
      on omeprazole 10 mg compared with placebo. The total score of the PGWB index
      improved significantly more on both doses of omeprazole than on placebo. The mean
      scores rose from 96.8 to 103.9 on omeprazole 20 mg, from 98.4 to 106.0 on
      omeprazole 10 mg, and from 98.0 to 100.6 on placebo. All dimensions of the PGWB
      index improved on treatment with omeprazole, but the improvements were most
      pronounced in the dimensions depicting anxiety, depressed mood, and self-control.
      CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that treatment with omeprazole 20 mg and omeprazole 
      10 mg restores QoL to a level comparable with that observed in a healthy
      population.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic interaction between acetaminophen and lansoprazole.
PG  - 56-8
AB  - Because of its minimal gastric toxicity, acetaminophen is the analgesic of choice
      for patients with gastric acid-related disorders. Because proton pump inhibitors 
      are widely used, concomitant prescription of acetaminophen and lansoprazole would
      be prevalent. This crossover study was conducted to investigate an
      acetaminophen-lansoprazole interaction. On one occasion, each of six healthy,
      fasted, male volunteers ingested 1.0 g acetaminophen dissolved in 200 mL water.
      On another occasion, at least 1 week apart, 30 mg lansoprazole was administered
      orally, simultaneously with acetaminophen, after pretreatment with the same dose 
      of lansoprazole once daily for 2 days. Plasma acetaminophen concentrations were
      measured at 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8 hours after dosing. The peak
      plasma concentration of acetaminophen and the time to its occurrence were
      significantly higher and shorter, respectively, during the lansoprazole session
      than during the control session. Neither the elimination half-life nor the area
      under the curve was significantly different between the two sessions.
      Lansoprazole hastens the absorption of acetaminophen solution, but little
      modifies its elimination rate and bioavailability.

TI  - Endoscopic assessment of oesophagitis: clinical and functional correlates and
      further validation of the Los Angeles classification.
PG  - 172-80
AB  - BACKGROUND: Endoscopic oesophageal changes are diagnostically helpful and
      identify patients exposed to the risk of disease chronicity. However, there is a 
      serious lack of agreement about how to describe and classify the appearance of
      reflux oesophagitis AIMS: To examine the reliability of criteria that describe
      the circumferential extent of mucosal breaks and to evaluate the functional and
      clinical correlates of patients with reflux disease whose oesophagitis was graded
      according to the Los Angeles system. METHODS: Forty six endoscopists from
      different countries used a detailed worksheet to evaluate endoscopic video
      recordings from 22 patients with the full range of severity of reflux
      oesophagitis. In separate studies, Los Angeles system gradings were correlated
      with 24 hour oesophageal pH monitoring (178 patients), and with clinical trials
      of omeprazole treatment (277 patients). RESULTS: Evaluation of circumferential
      extent of oesophagitis by the criterion of whether mucosal breaks extended
      between the tops of mucosal folds, gave acceptable agreement (mean kappa value
      0.4) among observers. This approach is used in the Los Angeles system. An
      alternative approach of grouping the circumferential extent of mucosal breaks as 
      occupying 0-25%, 26-50%, 51-75%, 76-99%, or 100% of the oesophageal
      circumference, gave unacceptably high interobserver variation (mean kappa values 
      0-0.15) for all but the lowest category of extent (mean kappa value 0.4).
      Severity of oesophageal acid exposure was significantly (p<0.001) related to the 
      severity grade of oesophagitis. Preteatment oesophagitis grades A-C were related 
      to heartburn severity (p<0.01), outcomes of omeprazole (10 mg daily) treatment
      (p<0.01), and the risk for symptom relapse off therapy over six months (p<0.05). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Results add further support to previous studies for the clinical
      utility of the Los Angeles system for endoscopic grading of oesophagitis.

TI  - Barrett's esophagus: update on screening, surveillance, and treatment.
PG  - 1411-6
AB  - The last 2 decades have seen dramatic advances in Barrett's esophagus. The
      definition has evolved; the rising incidence of adenocarcinoma has been
      recognized; and effective therapy to control gastroesophageal reflux disease has 
      been developed. Both proton pump inhibitor therapy and laparoscopic
      fundoplication represent major developments. Studies of patients with dysplasia
      have helped to clarify appropriate surveillance intervals and treatment
      strategies for these patients, although controversy still exists. The possibility
      of reversing Barrett's esophagus in selected high-risk patients offers major hope
      for the future prevention of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.

TI  - Peptic-ulcer disease in the elderly.
PG  - 457-71
AB  - Peptic-ulcer disease causes significant morbidity and mortality in the elderly.
      It frequently presents in an atypical manner and is associated with a high
      incidence of complications. The prevalence of Helicobacter pylori increases with 
      age and can have an important role in the development of ulcers. Nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs also contribute to the increased incidence of ulcers and 
      the development of complications in the elderly. Although management of ulcer
      disease in the elderly is similar to that in the younger population,
      consideration must be given to the potential for increased incidence of side
      effects and medication interactions. When endoscopy and surgery are performed
      there should be an appreciation for the risks associated with concurrent
      illnesses that can accompany advanced age.

TI  - Prophylaxis and treatment of NSAID-induced gastroduodenal disorders.
PG  - 527-43
AB  - A significant percentage of patients taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
      (NSAIDs) experience some type of adverse gastrointestinal symptoms, lesions of
      the gastroduodenal tract being clinically the most relevant. NSAIDs cause
      gastrointestinal damage by 2 independent mechanisms: a topical effect, which is
      pH and pKa related, and a systemic effect mediated by cyclooxygenase (COX)
      inhibition with a reduction in prostaglandin synthesis. Using endoscopy,
      gastroduodenal lesions identified include subepithelial haemorrhages, erosions
      and ulcers. The prevalence of ulceration in NSAID users has been reported as
      being between 14 and 31% with a 2-fold higher frequency of gastric ulcers
      compared with duodenal ulcers. Among the strategies used to decrease the risk of 
      ulcer development are: (i) the use of analgesics other than NSAIDs; (ii) use of
      the lowest possible dosage of NSAID; (iii) the use of a COX-2 selective NSAID;
      (iv) the use of low doses of corticosteroids instead of NSAIDs; (v) avoidance of 
      concomitant use of NSAIDs and corticosteroids; and (vi) use of preventive
      therapy. In an attempt to reduce the incidence of NSAID-induced gastrointestinal 
      lesions, the following approaches have been proposed: (i) use of the
      prostaglandin analogue misoprostol, which is an antiulcer drug which has been
      proven to be as effective in the prevention of NSAID-induced gastric and duodenal
      ulcers as in the reduction of serious upper gastrointestinal complications; (ii) 
      histamine H2 receptor antagonists (H2 antagonists), e.g. ranitidine, cimetidine
      and famotidine, which are useful in the prevention of NSAID-induced duodenal
      ulcers during long term treatment, but not in the prevention of NSAID-induced
      gastric ulcers; (iii) proton pump inhibitors, e.g omeprazole, and pantoprazole,
      whose efficacy in preventing NSAID-associated ulcers has been recently
      demonstrated; and (iv) barrier agents, e.g. sucralfate, which cannot be
      recommended as prophylactic agents to prevent NSAID-induced gastropathy. The
      first step in the treatment of NSAID-associated ulcers lies in a reduction in the
      dosage of the NSAID or discontinuation of the drug. If NSAID treatment cannot be 
      withdrawn, a proton pump inhibitor appears to be the most effective treatment in 
      healing ulcers, accelerating the slow healing observed with H2 antagonists.

TI  - Randomized placebo-controlled trial of a 42-Day tapering course of dexamethasone 
      to reduce the duration of ventilator dependency in very low birth weight infants.
PG  - 22-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect on duration of ventilator dependency of a 42-day 
      tapering course of dexamethasone in very low birth weight neonates. METHODS:
      Infants (N = 118) were assigned randomly, within birth weight/gender strata, to
      treatment with either a 42-day tapering course of dexamethasone or an equal
      volume of saline as placebo. Entry criteria were 1) birth weight <1501 g; 2) age 
      between 15 and 25 days; 3) <10% decrease in ventilator settings for 24 hours and 
      FIO2 >/=0.3; 4) absence of patent ductus arteriosus, sepsis, major congenital
      malformation, congenital heart disease; and 5) no evidence of maternal HIV or
      hepatitis B infection. The dosage schedule was 0.25 mg/kg bid for 3 days, then
      0.15 mg/kg bid for 3 days, then a 10% reduction in the dose every 3 days until a 
      dose of 0.1 mg/kg had been given for 3 days, from which time a dose of 0.1 mg/kg 
      qod was continued until 42 days after entry. The primary endpoint was the number 
      of days on assisted ventilation after study entry. Secondary outcomes of interest
      included days on supplemental oxygen, days of hospitalization, and potential
      adverse effects, such as infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, left ventricular
      hypertrophy, and severe retinopathy of prematurity. RESULTS: Infants in the
      dexamethasone- and placebo-treated groups were similar in terms of baseline
      attributes, including birth weight, gestational age, gender, race, and ventilator
      settings at entry. Infants treated with dexamethasone were on assisted
      ventilation and supplemental oxygen for fewer days after study entry (median days
      on ventilator, 5th and 95th percentiles, 13 [1-64] vs 25 [6-104]; days on oxygen,
      59 [6-247] vs 100 [11-346]). No differences were found in risk of death,
      infection, or severe retinopathy. In subgroup analyses, the association of
      dexamethasone with more rapid weaning from the ventilator was weaker among
      infants enrolled before the 16th day of life, infants with chest radiographs
      showing cystic changes and/or hyperinflation, and infants requiring an FIO2
      >/=0.7 or a peak inspiratory pressure >/=19 at study entry. CONCLUSIONS: A 42-day
      tapering course of dexamethasone decreases the duration of ventilator and oxygen 
      dependency in very low birth weight infants and is not associated with an
      increased risk of short-term adverse effects.

TI  - The importance of clarithromycin dose in the management of Helicobacter pylori
      infection: a meta-analysis of triple therapies with a proton pump inhibitor,
      clarithromycin and amoxycillin or metronidazole.
PG  - 719-29
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is not clear which dose of clarithromycin (500 mg b.d. or 250 mg
      b.d.) is more effective for Helicobacter pylori eradication in proton pump
      inhibitor-based triple therapies. METHODS: We undertook a meta-analysis of the
      effect of 7-day triple therapies consisting of a proton pump inhibitor (P), and
      clarithromycin (C) and amoxycillin (A) or metronidazole (M). A meta-analysis of
      all clinical trials performed in an adult population and published in English up 
      to March 1998 was undertaken. Studies with doses of clarithromycin 500 mg b.d. or
      250 mg b.d. only were included. RESULTS: A total of 82 studies (31 papers and 51 
      abstracts) involving 110 treatment arms and 6123 patients were analysed that met 
      the predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. In the PAC combination, the
      pooled eradication rate in patients treated with clarithromycin 500 mg b.d. was
      89.5% (95% CI: 86.9-92. 0%) by per protocol analysis and 86.6% (95% CI:
      81.0-89.3%) by intention-to-treat analysis. These rates are significantly higher 
      than those achieved with clarithromycin 250 mg b.d. (83.3% by per protocol and
      78.2% by intention-to-treat analysis, both P < 0.0001). This difference was
      confirmed in head-to-head comparative studies. In the PMC regimen, clarithromycin
      500 mg b.d. eradicated 90.8% (95% CI: 87.0-94.5%) of the infections compared to
      88.5% (95% CI: 85.5-91. 5%) in patients treated with clarithromycin 250 mg b.d.
      by per protocol analysis (P = 0.082). The corresponding rates by
      intention-to-treat analysis for clarithromycin 500 mg b.d. and 250 mg b.d. was
      88.3% and 86.7%, respectively (P = 0.259). CONCLUSIONS: Seven-day triple
      therapies with a proton pump inhibitor, clarithromycin and amoxycillin or
      metronidazole are highly effective treatments for the eradication of H. pylori.
      Clarithromycin 500 mg b. d. should be used in these combinations to achieve the
      best first treatment results, which can minimize the subsequent development of
      bacterial resistance to clarithromycin and metronidazole.

TI  - Effects of very low dose daily, long-term aspirin therapy on gastric, duodenal,
      and rectal prostaglandin levels and on mucosal injury in healthy humans.
PG  - 17-25
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The safety of low-dose daily aspirin therapy in the
      gastrointestinal tract is uncertain. Our objectives were to evaluate the
      long-term effects of very low daily aspirin doses in the gastrointestinal tract
      and effects on platelet-derived serum thromboxane levels in volunteers. METHODS: 
      Subjects were randomized to receive 10 mg (n = 8), 81 mg (n = 11), or 325 mg (n =
      10) aspirin daily for 3 months. Before administration of aspirin, all subjects
      underwent gastroduodenoscopy, and most underwent proctoscopy for assessment of
      mucosal injury and prostaglandin content. After 1.5 and 3 months, subjects again 
      underwent gastroduodenoscopy and, at 3 months, another proctoscopy. RESULTS: Each
      aspirin dose (even 10 mg) significantly reduced gastric mucosal prostaglandin
      levels, to approximately 40% of the baseline value. All three doses also induced 
      significant gastric injury, and 325 mg caused duodenal injury. Three subjects
      developed gastric ulcers, 1 while taking 10 mg/day of aspirin. Furthermore,
      aspirin at 81 mg/day and 325 mg/day (but not 10 mg/day) significantly reduced
      duodenal mucosal prostaglandin levels to approximately 40% of the baseline value.
      Only 325 mg of aspirin per day significantly reduced rectal mucosal prostaglandin
      levels to approximately 60% of the baseline value. Serum thromboxane levels were 
      inhibited 62%, 90%, and 98% with 10, 81, and 325 mg of aspirin. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      findings explain aspirin's predominant gastric toxicity and question the safety
      of even 10 mg of aspirin daily.

TI  - The influence of Helicobacter pylori on oesophageal acid exposure in GERD during 
      acid suppressive therapy.
PG  - 921-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori exaggerates the effect of acid suppressive drugs 
      on intragastric pH. It is unknown whether this is relevant for the treatment of
      GERD. AIM: To compare oesophageal acid exposure and symptoms in H.
      pylori-negative and H. pylori-positive GERD patients during low and profound acid
      suppression. METHODS: Barrett's oesophagus patients with gastro- oesophageal acid
      reflux were studied by 24-h oesophageal pH-metry at baseline and during
      randomized treatment with omeprazole 40 mg b.d. or ranitidine 150 mg b.d. H.
      pylori status was determined by a serum IgG ELISA. Symptoms were scored on a
      four-graded scale. RESULTS: Of 58 patients, 26 (14 H. pylori-negative, 12 H.
      pylori-positive) were randomized to omeprazole, 32 (16 H. pylori-negative, 16 H. 
      pylori-positive) to ranitidine. At baseline, oesophageal acid exposure and
      symptoms did not differ between H. pylori-negative and H. pylori-positive: mean
      time proportion pH < 4 per 24 h was 16.1% (95% CI 11.5-23.2) in H.
      pylori-negative, and 15.8% (11.3-21.4) in H. pylori-positive patients. Omeprazole
      treatment resulted in a decrease of acid reflux per 24 h from 23.4% (7.9-39.3) to
      0.0% (0.0-2.9) in H. pylori-negative, and from 17.3% (8.9-38.8) to 0.1% (0.0-1.7)
      in H. pylori-positive patients; ranitidine resulted in a decrease from 14.4%
      (10.5-18.5) to 9.3% (5.6-12.8) in H. pylori-negative, and from 15.1% (9.8-21.0)
      to 9.0% (3.1-20.1) in H. pylori-positive patients, the difference between H.
      pylori-negative and H. pylori-positive patients being N.S. There was no
      significant difference between H. pylori-negative and H. pylori-positive patients
      with respect to erect and supine acid reflux, or symptom scores in both treatment
      groups. CONCLUSIONS: H. pylori infection does not influence oesophageal acid
      reflux and symptoms in patients with Barrett's oesophagus, either at baseline or 
      during low as well as profound acid suppressive therapy. We conclude that the
      dose of acid suppression does not have to be titrated upon H. pylori status in
      GERD.

TI  - On demand therapy with omeprazole for the long-term management of patients with
      heartburn without oesophagitis--a placebo-controlled randomized trial.
PG  - 907-14
AB  - AIM: To observe the natural course of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in
      patients without oesophagitis following effective symptom relief, and to
      determine the place of acid pump inhibitor therapy in the long-term management of
      these patients. METHODS: We investigated the efficacy of on-demand therapy with
      omeprazole 20 mg or 10 mg, or placebo in a double-blind, randomized multicentre
      trial. It involved 424 patients with troublesome heartburn without endoscopic
      evidence of oesophagitis in whom heartburn had been resolved with short-term
      treatment. Patients were told to take study medication on demand once daily on
      recurrence of symptoms until symptoms resolved over a 6-month period. They also
      had access to antacids. The primary efficacy variable was time to discontinuation
      of treatment, due to unwillingness to continue. RESULTS: According to life-table 
      analysis, after 6 months the remission rates were 83% (95% CI: 77-89%) with
      omeprazole 20 mg, 69% (61-77%) with omeprazole 10 mg, and 56% (46-64%) with
      placebo (P < 0.01 for all intergroup differences). The mean (s.d.) number of
      study medications used per day in these groups was 0.43 (0.27), 0.41 (0.27) and
      0.47 (0.27), respectively. The use of antacids was highest in the placebo group
      and lowest in the omeprazole 20 mg group. Treatment failure was associated with
      more than a doubling of antacid use, and a deterioration in patient quality of
      life. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 50% of patients with heartburn who do not have
      oesophagitis need acid inhibitory therapy in addition to antacid medication to
      maintain a normal quality of life. On-demand therapy with omeprazole 20 mg, is an
      effective treatment strategy in these patients.

TI  - Randomized trial of omeprazole and clarithromycin combined with either
      metronidazole or amoxycillin in patients with metronidazole-resistant or
      -susceptible Helicobacter pylori strains.
PG  - 883-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The impact of metronidazole resistance on the efficacy of proton pump
      inhibitor based triple therapies remains unclear. AIM: To study whether
      metronidazole resistance affects Helicobacter pylori eradication rates in
      patients treated for 1 week with either omeprazole 20 mg b.d., metronidazole 400 
      mg b.d. and clarithromycin 250 mg b.d. (OMC), or omeprazole 20 mg b.d.,
      amoxycillin 1000 mg b.d. and clarithromycin 500 mg b.d. (OAC). METHODS: A
      randomized, single blind, single centre study with parallel groups was conducted.
      H. pylori positive patients were enrolled in a metronidazole-resistant (MR; MIC >
      8 microgram/mL) or a metronidazole-susceptible group (MS; MIC < 4 microgram/mL), 
      as determined by E-test. Within the strata patients were randomized to either OAC
      or OMC. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-two patients were included. The per
      protocol cure rate for OAC was 52 out of 57 (91%) (MS 23 out of 26 (89%); MR 29
      out of 31 (94%)) and for OMC 46 out of 55 (84%) (MS 19 out of 22 (86%); MR 27 out
      of 33 (82%)). CONCLUSIONS: One-week OAC and OMC are effective therapies. OAC and 
      OMC were equally effective in patients with metronidazole-susceptible strains of 
      H. pylori. Using the OMC regimen, neither equality nor significant differences in
      treatment outcome could be shown between patients with metronidazole-resistant or
      -susceptible strains of H. pylori.

TI  - Comparison of two 3-day Helicobacter pylori eradication regimens with a standard 
      1-week regimen.
PG  - 869-73
AB  - BACKGROUND: The duration of Helicobacter pylori eradication regimens has
      decreased to 1 week with cure rates of over 90%. This can be attributed to the
      use of triple drug regimens including potent inhibitors of gastric acid secretion
      and clarithromycin. There is no theoretical reason why shorter regimens should
      not be possible. AIM: To compare two 3-day, low-dose, twice daily regimens with 1
      week of omeprazole 20 mg b.d., clarithromycin 250 mg b.d., and metronidazole 400 
      mg b.d. (OCM) METHODS: Outpatients referred for gastroscopy were screened by
      biopsy urease test. H. pylori-positive patients were randomized to receive either
      lansoprazole 30 mg b.d., tri-potassium dicitrato bismuthate one tablet b.d.,
      clarithromycin 250 mg b.d., and amoxycillin 1 g b.d. for 3 days (LTdbCA), or
      ranitidine bismuth citrate 400 mg b.d., clarithromycin 250 mg b.d. and
      amoxycillin 1 g b.d. for 3 days (RbcCA) or omeprazole 20 mg b.d., clarithromycin 
      250 mg b.d. and metronidazole 400 mg b.d. for 1 week (OCM). They were not
      pre-treated with a gastric acid inhibitor. After 8 weeks, H. pylori status was
      assessed by 13C urea breath test. RESULTS: 974 out of 1114 patients referred for 
      gastroscopy were screened by biopsy urease test. 140 patients were not screened
      either because they were anticoagulated or for technical reasons. 334 patients
      were H. pylori-positive: 154 were excluded mostly because of allergy to
      penicillin and personal reasons but 180 were randomized to treatment All regimens
      were well tolerated. For LTdbCA (n=60), RbcCA (n=59), and OCM (n=61) the H.
      pylori cure rates (95% CI) were 23% (12-34), 14% (5-23) and 87% (79-95),
      respectively, using intention-to-treat analysis and 25% (14-36), 15% (6-24) and
      88% (80-96), respectively, if analysed per protocol. OCM was significantly
      superior to LTdbCA and RbcCA (P < 0.001) but there was no significant difference 
      between regimens LTdbCA and RbcCA. CONCLUSIONS: OCM is an extremely effective H. 
      pylori eradication regimen. The 3-day regimens tested both have poor cure rates. 
      Pre-treatment with a proton pump inhibitor, higher doses or more frequent dosing 
      may be necessary to increase the cure rate of short duration regimens. However,
      this could make them less acceptable than the H. pylori eradication regimens
      currently available.

TI  - Short-term triple therapy with lansoprazole 30 mg or 60 mg, amoxycillin and
      clarithromycin to eradicate Helicobacter pylori.
PG  - 865-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated the efficacy of 30 vs. 60 mg lansoprazole daily in a 
      1-week triple therapy for eradication of Helicobacter pylori in a prospective
      randomized study. METHODS: Two hundred and fifteen consecutive out-patients with 
      peptic ulcer disease or non-ulcer dyspepsia, in whom H. pylori infection was
      confirmed by histology and/or a urease biopsy test, were randomly assigned to a
      1-week treatment with either 15 mg lansoprazole b.d. (LAC15 group) or 30 mg
      lansoprazole b.d. (LAC30 group) in combination with 1 g amoxycillin b.d. and 500 
      mg clarithromycin b.d. RESULTS: Eradication of H. pylori was successful in 87%
      (per protocol) and 82% (intention-to-treat) of the patients with LAC15 and in 94%
      (per protocol) and 87% (intention-to-treat) of the patients with LAC30. The
      difference was not significant. In both treatment groups, all peptic ulcers were 
      healed at the check-up. Adverse effects were seen in 11 patients of the LAC15
      group and 10 patients of the LAC30 group: they caused discontinuation of the
      therapy in four of the LAC15 group and two patients of the LAC 30 group.
      CONCLUSIONS: A 7-day triple therapy using lansoprazole (LAC15) is an efficient
      and economical regimen for the eradication of H. pylori.

TI  - Efficacy of omeprazole versus ranitidine for symptomatic treatment of poorly
      responsive acid reflux disease-a prospective, controlled trial.
PG  - 819-26
AB  - BACKGROUND: H2-receptor antagonists are widely used in patients with
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and are frequently continued when
      symptoms persist. Aim: To compare the efficacy of omeprazole 20 mg once daily
      with that of ranitidine 150 mg twice daily in relieving GERD symptoms, in
      patients who remained symptomatic following a 6-week course of ranitidine
      therapy. METHODS: Patients with heartburn on at least 4 days/week but who did not
      have endoscopy to assess oesophageal mucosa could participate. This two-phase,
      prospective trial included a 6-week open-label phase (phase I), followed by an
      8-week double-blind phase (phase II). Patients still symptomatic following
      treatment with ranitidine 150 mg twice daily (phase I) were randomized to
      double-blind treatment (phase II) with either omeprazole 20 mg once daily or
      ranitidine 150 mg twice daily. The primary efficacy variable was the proportion
      of patients with heartburn resolution during weeks 4 and 8 of phase II. RESULTS: 
      Of the 533 patients with GERD who received ranitidine in phase I, 348 patients
      (65%) were still symptomatic. A total of 317 patients (59%) were randomized to
      double-blind treatment (phase II). At week 8, a significantly (P < 0.0004)
      greater proportion of omeprazole-treated patients (70%) experienced no more than 
      mild heartburn compared with ranitidine-treated patients (49%). Complete
      resolution of heartburn also occurred in a significantly (P < 0. 00001) greater
      proportion of omeprazole-treated patients (46% vs. 16% of the ranitidine group at
      week 8). CONCLUSIONS: After 6 weeks of ranitidine treatment, the majority of
      patients with GERD were still experiencing moderate to severe heartburn.
      Omeprazole was significantly more effective than ranitidine in resolving
      heartburn in this group of patients.

      oesophagitis.
PG  - 795-804
AB  - BACKGROUND: This randomized, double-blind, multicentre study compared
      lansoprazole with placebo for symptomatic relief of patients with non-erosive
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD). METHODS: 214 patients with symptomatic,
      non-erosive GERD (moderate to severe daytime and/or night-time heartburn greater 
      than half the days over the past 6 months and during the 7- to 10-day
      pre-treatment period) were randomized to either lansoprazole 15 mg or
      lansoprazole 30 mg, or placebo o.d. for 8 weeks. RESULTS: Daily diary data
      indicated that on the first treatment day a statistically significantly smaller
      percentage of lansoprazole patients reported daytime and night-time heartburn and
      antacid usage, compared with placebo patients. Lansoprazole patients also
      reported statistically significant less severe daytime and night-time heartburn
      on the first treatment day. During 0-4, 4-8, and 0-8 weeks of therapy, a
      statistically significant smaller percentage of days and nights with heartburn,
      less severe daytime and night-time heartburn, and less antacid usage were
      observed in the lansoprazole group compared to the placebo group. The percentages
      of patients with adverse reactions were similar in the lansoprazole and placebo
      groups. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate that lansoprazole is
      an appropriate therapy for patients with symptomatic non-erosive GERD.

TI  - Impact of clarithromycin resistance on the effectiveness of a regimen for
      Helicobacter pylori: a prospective study of 1-week lansoprazole, amoxycillin and 
      clarithromycin in active peptic ulcer.
PG  - 775-80
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clarithromycin is a key antimicrobial in the combinations used to
      cure Helicobacter pylori infections, so there is a need to define the impact of
      in vitro resistance on in vivo results. METHODS: A prospective trial was designed
      to study the effectiveness of the 1-week combination of lansoprazole,
      clarithromycin and amoxycillin in 102 consecutive patients with active peptic
      ulcer. The pre-treatment and post-treatment sensitivity to amoxycillin,
      metronidazole and clarithromycin were studied by E-test, and H. pylori status was
      defined by histology, culture and urease test at diagnosis and one month after
      treatment, and by urea-breath test 2 months after treatment. RESULTS: The
      eradication rate (intention-to-treat analysis) was 77% (95% CI: 69-86). No
      clinical factor was found to be different between eradicated and non-eradicated
      patients. Clarithromycin-resistant strains were found in 10 (10%; CI: 5-17)
      patients. The eradication rate was 20% (CI: 3-56) in these patients vs. 83% (CI: 
      75-91) in patients harbouring clarithromycin-sensitive strains (P < 0.001). A
      logistic-regression analysis confirmed clarithromycin resistance as the only
      factor associated with treatment failure. CONCLUSIONS: Clarithromycin resistance 
      significatively impairs the effectiveness of the combination of lansoprazole,
      amoxycillin, and clarithromycin. The 80% efficacy goal will be difficult to reach
      in areas with high (>10%) primary clarithromyicin resistance, if currently
      recommended proton pump inhibitor-triple therapies are used.

TI  - A new quadruple therapy for Helicobacter pylori: influence of resistant strains
      on treatment outcome.
PG  - 769-74
AB  - BACKGROUND: There have been no reports concerning the efficacy and safety of a
      1-week quadruple therapy regimen of omeprazole, amoxycillin, roxithromycin and
      metronidazole for Helicobacter pylori infections and the impact of primary
      resistance on the eradication rate. METHODS: One hundred and sixty-nine
      consecutive patients with peptic ulcer disease as well as gastritis with
      biopsy-proven H. pylori infection were entered into an open study of omeprazole
      20 mg o.m., amoxycillin 500 mg t.d.s., roxithromycin 150 mg b.d., and
      metronidazole 250 mg t.d.s. Helicobacter pylori status was determined by urease
      test, histology and culture. Susceptibility to amoxycillin, metronidazole and
      roxithromycin was determined by the E-test. RESULTS: H. pylori was eradicated in 
      155 out of 169 (92%; 95% CI 88-96%) by intention-to-treat analysis, and in 155
      out of 163 (95%; 95% CI 92-98%) by per protocol analysis. The prevalence of
      primary resistance against amoxycillin, roxithromycin and metronidazole was 2 out
      of 166 (1%), 16 out of 166 (10%) and 27 out of 166 (16%), respectively. H. pylori
      was eradicated in 25 out of 27 (93%) patients with metronidazole-resistant
      strains compared with 130 out of 136 (96%) in patients with
      metronidazole-sensitive strains of H. pylori. It was eradicated in 15 out of 16
      (94%) patients with roxithromycin-resistant strains while in 140 out of 147 (95%)
      patients with roxithromycin-sensitive strains of H. pylori, and in two out of two
      (100%) patients with amoxycillin-resistant stains compared with 153 out of 161
      (95%) in patients with amoxycillin-sensitive strains. H. pylori was eradicated in
      three out of four (75%) patients with double resistance against metronidazole and
      roxithromycin compared with 152 out of 159 (96%) patients with sensitive strains 
      to metronidazole and or roxithromycin. None of these differences were
      statistically significant. Severe side-effects were found in only one out of 169 
      patients-anaphylaxis due to penicillin. CONCLUSIONS: The 1-week quadruple therapy
      with omeprazole, amoxycillin, metronidazole and roxithromycin was found to
      eradicate H. pylori in over 90% of all patients. This regimen was also found to
      be beneficial for patients with pre-treatment resistant strains to metronidazole,
      roxithromycin or amoxycillin, and was observed to be safe and well-tolerated.

TI  - Impact of rabeprazole, a new proton pump inhibitor, in triple therapy for
      Helicobacter pylori infection-comparison with omeprazole and lansoprazole.
PG  - 741-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: A recent trend in curative therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection 
      is the so-called triple therapy, which consists of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) 
      and two different antimicrobials. Various regimens employing this triple therapy 
      have been reported. However, little is known about the effectiveness of
      rabeprazole, a recently developed proton pump inhibitor, when used in the triple 
      therapy. AIM: To validate its usefulness by comparing rabeprazole with omeprazole
      and lansoprazole, in combination with amoxycillin and clarithromycin. PATIENTS
      AND METHODS: 221 H. pylori-positive patients with peptic ulcer disease were
      randomized to receive one of three different proton pump
      inhibitor/amoxycillin-clarithromycin (PPI/AC) regimens for 7 days. (i) OAC
      regimen (n = 75): omeprazole 20 mg b.d., amoxycillin (AMOX) 500 mg t.d.s. and
      clarithromycin (CAM) 200 mg b.d.; (ii) LAC regimen (n = 74): lansoprazole 30 mg
      b.d. , AMOX 500 mg t.d.s. and CAM 200 mg b.d.; and (iii) RAC regimen (n = 72):
      rabeprazole 20 mg b.d., AMOX 500 mg t.d.s. and CAM 200 mg b.d. Cure of the
      infection was determined by the 13C urea breath test 1 month after completion of 
      the treatment. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat based cure rates for OAC, LAC and RAC 
      regimens were 85% (95% CI, 75-92), 84% (95%, CI 73-91) and 88% (95% CI, 78-94),
      respectively, and per protocol based cure rates of these regimens were 88% (95%
      CI, 78-94), 91% (95%, CI 82-99) and 93% (95% CI, 84-98), respectively. Adverse
      effects in the entire study population, which included diarrhoea, glossitis or
      skin rash, were reported by 15% of the patients, and complete compliance was
      achieved in 95% of these patients. CONCLUSION: 1-week proton pump inhibitor/AC
      regimens for H. pylori infection were effective in the Japanese population.
      Rabeprazole can be considered as equivalent to omeprazole and lansoprazole in the
      PPI/AC triple therapy.

TI  - The GU-MACH study: the effect of 1-week omeprazole triple therapy on Helicobacter
      pylori infection in patients with gastric ulcer.
PG  - 703-12
AB  - AIMS: To study the efficacy of omeprazole triple therapy in the eradication of
      Helicobacter pylori in patients with active gastric ulcer, and to assess healing 
      and relapse of gastric ulcer. METHODS: A double-blind, randomized study was
      carried out in 18 centres in Germany, Hungary and Poland. Patients (n = 160) with
      gastric ulcer and a positive H. pylori screening test were randomized to a 7-day 
      twice daily treatment with omeprazole 20 mg, clarithromycin 500 mg and
      amoxycillin 1000 mg (OAC) or omeprazole 20 mg, clarithromycin 250 mg and
      metronidazole 400 mg (OMC), or with omeprazole 20 mg once daily (O). After
      completion of this 1-week treatment, patients were treated with omeprazole until 
      healing (maximum 12 weeks), and followed for 6 months. H. pylori was assessed by 
      urea breath test (UBT) and histology. RESULTS: Eradication rates ITT were OAC 79%
      (95% CI: 65-90%), OMC 86% (95% CI: 73-94%) and O 4% (95% CI: 0-14%). Eradication 
      rates PP were OAC 83% (95% CI: 68-93%), OMC 93% (95% CI: 80-98%) and O 3% (95%
      CI: 0-13%). Gastric ulcer relapses occurred in 5, 0 and 11 patients in the
      groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results from the study demonstrate that
      OMC and OAC 1-week regimens are safe and effective for eradication of H. pylori
      in gastric ulcer patients, and that ulcer relapse is infrequent after successful 
      eradication.

TI  - Colloidal bismuth pectin: an alternative to bismuth subcitrate for the treatment 
      of Helicobacter pylori--positive duodenal ulcer.
PG  - 128-34
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bismuth triple therapy provides consistently good results in
      Helicobacter pylori eradication worldwide, whereas quadruple therapy using a
      combination of omeprazole and bismuth triple regimen has produced cure rates in
      excess of 90%. The prevalence of metronidazole-resistant strains was 26.8% in our
      area. Colloidal bismuth pectin (CBP) is a new, lower-priced bismuth salt made in 
      China. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of
      CBP triple and quadruple regimens in the treatment of H. pylori-positive duodenal
      ulcer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective trial, 205 patients with H.
      pylori-positive duodenal ulcer were allocated randomly to receive one of four
      regimens: metronidazole, 200 mg; amoxicillin, 250 mg; and colloidal bismuth
      subcitrate (CBS), 120 mg (group 1), or CBP, 100 mg qid (group 2) for 2 weeks,
      then continued CBS, 240 mg, or CBP, 200 mg bid for a further 2 weeks. A quadruple
      regimen using a combination of omeprazole, 20 mg bid, and CBS triple therapy
      (group 3) or CBP triple therapy (group 4), respectively, was given to patients
      for 1 week, followed by omeprazole, 20 mg once daily for a further 3 weeks.
      Further endoscopy was performed at least 4 weeks after cessation of the
      treatment. H. pylori status was determined by histology, a 14C urea breath test, 
      and a urease test. RESULTS: The per-protocol H. pylori cure rates were 85% (22 of
      26 patients), 90% (35 of 39), 96% (46 of 48), and 95% (75 of 79) for groups 1
      through 4. In the intention-to-treat analysis, cure rates were 79% (22 of 28),
      83% (35 of 42), 90% (46 of 51), and 89% (75 of 84), respectively. The cure rates 
      of quadruple therapy were higher than those of triple therapy; an 8.2% difference
      was not statistically significant (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.3-18.7%). The 
      ulcer-healing rates were 88%, 87%, 98%, and 97%, respectively, for groups 1
      through 4. The ulcer pain was relieved more rapidly in quadruple- than in
      triple-therapy regimens. Two patients discontinued treatment prematurely owing to
      drug-related side effects. CONCLUSION: One-week quadruple therapy is highly
      effective and safe in H. pylori eradication in Chinese patients. CBP is as
      effective as CBS.

TI  - Gastric Helicobacter pylori infection accelerates healing of reflux esophagitis
      during treatment with the proton pump inhibitor pantoprazole.
PG  - 11-6
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: In previous studies an exaggerated effect of proton pump
      inhibitors (PPIs) on intragastric pH in Helicobacter pylori-infected patients was
      observed. Because healing and improvement of symptoms in patients with
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is directly associated with an increase of
      intragastric pH during treatment, we hypothesized that the response to treatment 
      with a PPI in patients with reflux esophagitis would be better in H.
      pylori-infected patients than in patients without H. pylori infection. METHODS:
      We recruited 971 patients with endoscopically verified reflux esophagitis grades 
      II and III (Savary/Miller). At study entry, H. pylori status was assessed by a
      13C-urea breath test and baseline characteristics were recorded. Physicians and
      patients were not notified about the results of the breath test until completion 
      of the study. All patients underwent treatment with pantoprazole, 40 mg orally
      once daily for 4 weeks. Healing was verified by endoscopy after 4 or 8 weeks of
      treatment. If the esophagitis had not completely healed at this time, treatment
      was continued for a further 4-week period. Healing rates and symptom relief were 
      compared for patients with and without H. pylori infection. RESULTS: The
      prevalence of H. pylori was 39.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 36.9-42.9), and 
      neither gender, smoking, nor alcohol consumption were associated with the H.
      pylori infection (P > 0.4). The trial was completed by 846 patients without
      protocol violation. Overall healing rates of reflux esophagitis were 80.4% (95%
      CI, 77.7-83.1) and 93.6% (95% CI, 91.8-95.2) after 4 and 8 weeks, respectively.
      In H. pylori-positive patients, healing rates were significantly higher after 4
      (86.6% vs. 76.3%; P = 0.0005) and 8 weeks (96.4% vs. 91.8%; P < 0.004). Relief of
      symptoms after 4 weeks was also significantly (P < 0.05) better in H.
      pylori-infected patients than in uninfected patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with 
      reflux esophagitis and H. pylori infection respond significantly better than H.
      pylori-negative patients to the PPI pantoprazole.

TI  - "Reappearance" of Helicobacter pylori after eradication: implications on duodenal
      ulcer recurrence: a prospective 6 year study.
PG  - 345-7
AB  - We estimated the rate of Helicobacter pylori "reappearance" and of duodenal ulcer
      relapse up to 6 years after eradication of H. pylori. Of 220 patients in whom H. 
      pylori was eradicated, 165 were eligible at 12 months to follow-up. Endoscopy was
      scheduled every 12 months or whenever symptoms appeared. Baseline H. pylori
      eradication was confirmed by CLO test, histology (hematoxylin-eosin and Giemsa
      stain), and culture. H. pylori was tested for by the three methods at 12 months
      and subsequently by 2 methods (CLO, histology) on biopsies obtained from the
      gastric antrum and body. We reviewed 90 patients after 1 year, 32 after 2 years, 
      13 after 3 years, 12 after 4 years, 2 after 5 years, and 16 after 6 years (range,
      12 to 72 months; average, 25.23 months; patient-years, 347). At 12 months after
      eradication, 16 of 165 patients (9.7%) were H. pylori positive and 5 had ulcer
      relapse. Of 75 patients evaluated at 24 months, 7 (9.3%) were H. pylori positive 
      and 1 (1.3%) had ulcer relapse. At 36 months, 43 patients were seen and 1 (2.3%) 
      was H. pylori positive and had ulcer relapse (2.3%). Thirty, 18, and 16 patients 
      were seen at 48, 60, and 72 months, respectively. None was H. pylori positive and
      none had ulcer relapse. Overall, 24 H. pylori-positive patients were found, two
      thirds of them in the first year after eradication. In 7 of 24 (29%, 6 smokers), 
      ulcer recurred. None of the H. pylori-negative patients had ulcer relapse. The H.
      pylori reappearance rate was 7% and the ulcer relapse rate was 2% per
      patient-year. If the 16 H. pylori-positive patients who were found the first year
      are considered as recrudescence, then the reinfection rate will be 2.3% per
      patient-year.

TI  - The efficacy of extended-interval dosing of omeprazole in keeping
      gastroesophageal reflux disease patients symptom free.
PG  - 638-41
AB  - The potential economic advantage of alternate-day therapy for GERD maintenance
      must be weighed against the potential cost of failure before it can be widely
      instituted. The studies presented have helped develop a clinical picture of the
      patients who may benefit from alternate-day therapy without risk of complications
      or potential increases in management costs. Bank et al., reporting on a group of 
      patients, found that patients with Grade II-IV disease had a 61% success rate at 
      two to eight years. Bank defined success as both maintenance of endoscopic
      healing and symptom control. Ladas et al. found a 66.7% success rate defined as
      clinical and endoscopic remission in Grades II-III disease. Kurucar et al.
      monitored symptom control and esophageal complications in his patients and found 
      the regimen to have a 26% success rate in Grades III-IV disease. Lind et al.
      found that 83% of patients could remain symptom free with on-demand therapy if
      they were endoscopy-negative at baseline. The results of the Mantides et al.
      study are important because they imply that alternate-day omeprazole therapy may 
      be more effective than alternatives for step-down treatment, such as ranitidine
      or cisapride. Furthermore, patients can be educated to increase their frequency
      of use if symptoms should arise. Not only does this give the patient a sense of
      self-empowerment over his or her disease state, but it avoids the cost of
      switching to a PPI due to failure with an H2RA or a motility agent. Alternate-day
      use of omeprazole should be attempted only during the maintenance phase of GERD
      therapy. Patients requiring >20 mg/d to achieve healing appeared to be poor
      candidates for alternate-day omeprazole maintenance therapy. Based on available
      studies, it would seem that patients with Grades 0-II GERD would benefit most
      from alternate-day therapy. A role for alternate-day therapy in Grades III-IV is 
      apparent from the results presented but requires greater caution in view of the
      differing success rates (26-61%) in various studies. With Grades II-III
      esophagitis, a mean 24-hour gastric pH >6 and a gastric pH <4 less than 10% of
      the time during the initial healing phase with omeprazole 20 mg/d appeared to be 
      associated with success on alternate-day therapy. Evidence that all marketed PPIs
      have similar success is not available and should not be extrapolated from the
      data presented. Evidence that downward dosage adjustments of PPIs versus
      extending dosage intervals are effective in the maintenance of GERD should be
      recognized. Lansoprazole has been approved for treating erosive esophagitis at 30
      mg/d, with the maintenance dose established at 15 mg/d. Studies showing that
      lansoprazole 15 mg/d is more effective than alternate-day therapy with
      lansoprazole 30 mg exist, although similar studies with omeprazole have not been 
      performed. The abstracts describing the use of alternate-day omeprazole accounted
      for all enrollees and included endoscopic grading or pH monitoring to document
      disease severity at baseline. Most also included these same objective measures as
      end points in combination with symptom control. This strengthens the data since
      the positive predictive value of typical symptoms is variable. However, there are
      also several significant limitations. Abstracts provide only limited information 
      on methods. All studies other than Lind et al. lacked randomization. This study
      was also the only one that blinded patients to their treatment. Sample sizes for 
      the majority of the trials were quite small. Statistical analyses were not
      performed on any of the trial results with the exception of the trial by Lind et 
      al. In light of the lack of evidence of statistical significance as well as study
      design flaws, conclusions should be drawn cautiously. Larger well-designed trials
      looking at both the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of alternate day omeprazole
      are required before a definitive recommendation can be made.

TI  - Rabeprazole: pharmacokinetics in patients with stable, compensated cirrhosis.
PG  - 691-701
AB  - This single-center, open-label study was undertaken to compare the tolerability
      and pharmacokinetic profiles of rabeprazole, a new proton-pump inhibitor (PPI),
      in healthy volunteers and in subjects with chronic cirrhosis. Thirteen healthy
      men and 10 men with stable, compensated cirrhosis documented by biopsy or
      liver/spleen scan received a single 20-mg rabeprazole dose. Blood samples were
      drawn before and up to 24 hours after drug administration for the determination
      of plasma rabeprazole concentrations using high-performance liquid
      chromatography. Adverse events, vital signs, electrocardiograms, physical
      findings, and clinical laboratory test results were monitored before and during
      treatment to determine how rabeprazole was tolerated. Chronic liver disease
      substantially altered the pharmacokinetic profile of rabeprazole. The maximum
      rabeprazole concentration (+/- SD) in subjects with cirrhosis (635+/-199 ng/mL)
      was approximately 50% higher than that in the healthy volunteers (401+/-246
      ng/mL), and both area under the curve and elimination half-life were increased by
      approximately 100%. Oral clearance in subjects with cirrhosis was 38% of that in 
      the healthy volunteers. Rabeprazole was well tolerated by both groups. Three
      subjects reported a total of 5 clinical adverse events that were judged as
      definitely or possibly related to rabeprazole treatment. Some minor changes in
      laboratory values were judged to be clinically insignificant. In patients with
      mild-to-moderate liver dysfunction, clearance of this PPI, as with other members 
      of the class, was markedly reduced and plasma levels were increased. Although
      caution is always warranted in patients with severe liver disease, drug
      accumulation is unlikely with rabeprazole 20 mg once daily, and dose adjustment
      does not appear to be indicated in patients with mild-to-moderate liver
      dysfunction.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori infection and persistent hyperemesis gravidarum.
PG  - 85-8
AB  - Hyperemesis gravidarum is the most severe spectrum of gastrointestinal complaints
      in pregnant women. Our purpose is to describe an association of Helicobacter
      pylori with hyperemesis gravidarum. Three pregnant women are described with the
      working diagnoses of hyperemesis gravidarum unresponsive to standard therapy. The
      medical management used to treat Helicobacter pylori in these women are
      elaborated. The persistence of the symptomatology and/or hematemesis resulted in 
      Helicobacter pylori testing of these women. A 2-week course of antibiotics and a 
      proton pump inhibitor or H2 receptor antagonist resulted in resolution of the
      hyperemesis. A discussion of the incidence, diagnosis, and management of
      Helicobacter pylori in pregnancy is described. When the symptoms of hyperemesis
      gravidarum are persistent into the second trimester, active peptic ulcer disease 
      from Helicobacter pylori should be included in the differential diagnoses.

TI  - High dose omeprazole plus amoxicillin and azithromycin in eradication of
      Helicobacter pylori in duodenal ulcers.
PG  - 54-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of our study was to establish whether one-week triple therapy
      regimen (omeprazole, amoxicillin, azithromycin) with low dose (2 x 20 mg/day) or 
      high dose omeprazole (2 x 40 mg/day) is more effective in curing H. pylori
      infection in patients with active duodenal ulcer disease. METHODS: One hundred
      and twenty patients with duodenal ulcer and H. pylori infection were treated with
      amoxicillin 2 x 1000 mg/day for the first 7 days plus azithromycin 500 mg/day for
      the first 6 days. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either omeprazole 2 
      x 20 mg/day for the first 7 days (group A; n = 60) or omeprazole 2 x 40 mg/day
      for the first 7 days (group B; n = 60). After 7 days all patients in both groups 
      continued treatment with omeprazole (40 mg/day (days 8-14) and 20 mg/day (days
      15-28)). H. pylori status was determined by urease test and histology before the 
      treatment and 4 weeks after cessation of any medication. RESULTS: One hundred and
      thirteen patients completed the study. H. pylori infection was eradicated in
      73.2% [41/56] of patients in group A (intention-to-treat [ITT] analysis: 68.3%;
      95% CI: 58.6-80.4%) vs. 82.5% [47/57] of patients in group B (ITT analysis:
      78.3%; 95% CI: 67.8-87.9%; NS). All ulcers had healed after 4 weeks of omeprazole
      treatment. Side effects, usually minor, were recorded in 12.5% (group A) and in
      14% (group B) of patients (NS), but therapy was discontinued for only one patient
      in group B (NS). CONCLUSION: There was no statistically significant difference
      between one-week triple therapy regimen (omeprazole, amoxicillin, azithromycin)
      with high dose omeprazole (2 x 40 mg/day) and regimen with low dose omeprazole (2
      x 20 mg/day) in curing H. pylori infection in patients with active duodenal ulcer
      disease.

      diseases.
PG  - 298-304
AB  - This study was designed to determine the efficacy and safety of 1-week triple
      therapy regime consisting of pantoprazole, amoxicillin and clarithromycin in the 
      cure of Helicobacter pylori infection leading to duodenal ulcer disease and/or
      gastritis. Sixty-one patients (47 males, 14 females with a mean age of 34 years) 
      belonging to different ethnic groups suffering from H. pylori-associated duodenal
      ulcer and/or gastritis for an average of 2.46 years were recruited. Having
      satisfied primary selection criteria, patients received pantoprazole 40 mg
      b.i.d., clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d. and amoxicillin 1,000 mg b.i.d. for 7 days. 
      All medications were stopped there after H. pylori eradication was determined 4-6
      weeks after treatment by a repeat endoscopy, a rapid urease test, H. pylori
      culture and histology assessment as indicators of cure. All three tests must be
      negative to consider the infection to have been successfully eradicated.
      Fifty-seven patients completed the efficacy analysis per protocol. Dramatic
      symptomatic improvement was noted in most patients immediately after stopping
      treatment and it was sustained at 6 weeks. At the end of the study, the healing
      rate of duodenal ulcers (complete re-epithelialization) following 1-week
      treatment only, as indicated above, and without any maintenance therapy was
      66.7%, that of gastritis was 55.7%, and that of erosions was 64.3%. The overall
      eradication rate for H. pylori, however, was 93% (95% CI 83.0-98.1%).
      Furthermore, histologic evaluation revealed a remarkable resolution in the
      activity of gastritis in all the patients who had successful eradication of the
      infection.

TI  - Antibiotic therapy of Helicobacter pylori infection reduces healthcare
      expenditures related to duodenal ulcer.
PG  - 53-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test whether eradication of Helicobacter pylori saves costs in the 
      treatment of duodenal ulcer disease, compared with conventional antisecretory
      therapy. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, double-blind clinical trial was conducted
      at 132 sites in the United States. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adult patients with
      active duodenal ulcer and confirmed H pylori infection were randomized to receive
      treatment with clarithromycin plus omeprazole, omeprazole alone, or ranitidine
      alone. Utilization of ulcer-related healthcare resources was documented during 1 
      year following therapy. Costs were calculated by multiplying the number of health
      resources utilized by the cost of each resource. Resource costs were obtained
      from a database containing actual average costs spent by managed care
      organizations on outpatient and inpatient treatment. RESULTS: Of the 819 patients
      enrolled, 727 completed the study: 243 received clarithromycin plus omeprazole,
      248 omeprazole alone, and 236 ranitidine alone. Ulcer-related health resource
      utilization and total ulcer-related healthcare costs were decreased after
      treatment with clarithromycin plus omeprazole, compared to treatment with
      omeprazole or ranitidine alone. In multivariate linear regression analyses, type 
      of treatment was found to be a significant predictor of total costs. Specific
      costs associated with endoscopic examinations, clinic visits, and medications
      were also significantly reduced by treatment with clarithromycin plus omeprazole 
      as compared to other treatment forms. CONCLUSIONS: In a managed care environment,
      therapy with clarithromycin and omeprazole to eradicate H pylori in patients with
      duodenal ulcer disease would result in significant cost savings secondary to a
      reduction in the utilization of healthcare resources.

TI  - Three-day antibiotic therapy with azithromycin and tinidazole plus lansoprazole
      or pantoprazole to cure Helicobacter pylori infection: a pilot study.
PG  - 247-50
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to investigate and compare the
      effects of two proton-pump inhibitors, lansoprazole (Limpidex 30 mg, Sigmatau) vs
      pantoprazole (Peptazol 40 mg, Boehringer Mannheim), included in a three-day
      antibiotic therapy regimen with azithromycin (Zitromax 500 mg, Pfizer) and
      tinidazole (Fasigin 500 mg, Pfizer). DESIGN: Seventy consecutive, H.
      pylori-positive patients were randomly pre-treated with lansoprazole 30 mg o.d.
      (once daily) or pantoprazole 40 mg o.d. for two days, and subsequently
      respectively assigned to one of the two following treatment regimens, given for
      only three days: regimen A (LAT) comprising lansoprazole 30 mg o.d. plus
      azithromycin 500 mg o.d. and tinidazole 500 mg b.i.d. (bis in die), or regimen B 
      (PAT) comprising pantoprazole 40 mg o.d. plus azithromycin 500 mg o.d. and
      tinidazole 500 mg b.i.d. H. pylori status was evaluated by means of histology and
      rapid urease test at entry, and by 13C-urea breath test alone 8 weeks after
      treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sixty-nine of the enrolled patients completed
      the study: 34 in the LAT group and 35 in the PAT group. One patient in the LAT
      group was lost to follow-up. In the LAT group, after the end of treatment, 28/34 
      patients were H. pylori-negative (per protocol: 82%; intention-to-treat: 80%). In
      the PAT group, after treatment, 29/35 patients were H. pylori-negative (per
      protocol and intention-to-treat: 83%). Mild or slight side-effects occurred in
      only one patient in the LAT group and in one in the PAT group. CONCLUSIONS: From 
      this study there is no evidence that either of the two proton-pump inhibitors
      used is preferable in a three-day antibiotic regimen with azithromycin and
      tinidazole. The excellent side-effect and tolerability profiles, associated with 
      acceptable eradication rates, make the two treatment regimens we tested
      particularly useful when patient compliance is difficult to achieve.

TI  - Canadian Helicobacter pylori Consensus Conference update: infections in adults.
      Canadian Helicobacter Study Group.
PG  - 213-7
AB  - The first Canadian Helicobacter pylori Consensus Conference took place in April
      1997. The initial recommendations of the conference were published in early 1998.
      An update meeting was held in June 1998, and the present paper updates and
      complements the earlier recommendations. Key changes included the following: the 
      recommendation for testing and treating H pylori infection in patients with known
      peptic ulcer disease was extended to testing and treating patients with
      ulcer-like dyspepsia; it was decided that the urea breath test (not serology)
      should be used for routine diagnosis of H pylori infection unless endoscopy is
      indicated for another reason; and recommended therapies were a twice daily,
      seven-day regimen of a proton pump inhibitor (omeprazole 20 mg, lansoprazole 30
      mg, pantoprazole 40 mg) or ranitidine bismuth citrate 400 mg, plus clarithromycin
      500 mg and amoxicillin 1000 mg, or plus clarithromycin 500 or 250 mg and
      metronidazole 500 mg. The need was reiterated to have funding for readily
      accessible, accurate testing for H pylori infection with the urea breath test. It
      was strongly recommended that regional centres be established to monitor the
      prevalence of antibiotic-resistant H pylori infections. The initial consensus
      document referred to pediatric issues that were not addressed in this update but 
      were the subject of a subsequent Canadian Helicobacter Study Group meeting, and
      will be published later in 1999.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori as a possible bacterial focus of chronic urticaria.
PG  - 130-2
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic urticaria is one of the most frequent skin diseases. Its
      cause, however, remains unsolved in a large number of cases. Recent
      investigations pointed to a potential role of Helicobacter pylori infection of
      the upper gastrointestinal tract as a possible causative agent in chronic
      urticaria. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the effect of a 14-day
      eradication therapy on chronic urticaria. METHODS: Thirty patients with chronic
      urticaria and confirmed H. pylori infection were treated with amoxicillin and
      omeprazole. Follow-up was conducted over a period of 6 months concerning
      eradication of H. pylori and remission of urticaria. RESULTS: Only 8 out of 30
      patients (26.7%) showed clinical improvement or disappearance of their urticarial
      symptoms. CONCLUSION: Though our results do not support the preliminary data of
      previous studies, the role of H. pylori as a possible bacterial focus of chronic 
      urticaria has to be further investigated.

TI  - Randomized controlled comparison of nitroimidazoles for the eradication of
      Helicobacter pylori and relief of ulcer-associated and non-ulcer dyspepsia.
PG  - 637-42
AB  - BACKGROUND: A combination of omeprazole, clarithromycin and either metronidazole 
      or tinidazole is commonly used for Helicobacter pylori eradication. Metronidazole
      is considerably cheaper than tinidazole but the two have not previously been
      compared in a randomized trial. METHODS: One hundred and twenty dyspeptic H.
      pylori-positive patients with endoscopically defined peptic ulcer [DU (n = 65),
      GU (n = 12)] or non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD, n = 43) were randomized to receive a
      1-week course of twice daily omeprazole 20 mg, clarithromycin 250 mg and either
      metronidazole 400 mg (OCM) or tinidazole 500 mg (OCT) in a double-blind fashion. 
      Eradication of H. pylori, safety and side-effects of treatment, dyspeptic symptom
      score and consumption of antisecretory drugs were assessed at 6 weeks and 1 year 
      after treatment. RESULTS: H. pylori eradication was successfully achieved in
      57/60 (95%, ITT analysis) of patients receiving OCT and 58/60 (97%, ITT analysis)
      receiving OCM. Both regimens had similar side-effect profiles, which accounted
      for only one patient withdrawal. All patients remained uninfected (as assessed by
      14C-urea breath test) at 1-year follow-up, but major symptom improvements and
      decreased antisecretory drug use were only seen in patients with DU (P<0.0001).
      CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with OCM is as effective as the more expensive OCT at
      eradicating H. pylori. H. pylori eradication results in long-term relief of
      dyspeptic symptoms and reduced antisecretory consumption only in patients with
      DU, and not in those with NUD.

TI  - Rapid improvement of symptomatology with pantoprazole, amoxycillin and
      metronidazole in Helicobacter pylori-positive duodenal ulcer patients.
PG  - 245-51
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a new 1-week triple
      therapy regimen consisting of pantoprazole, amoxycillin and metronidazole.
      METHODOLOGY: The study involved 51 Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) positive
      patients (M:30, F:21, mean age: 52.5 years, range: 24-75) affected with duodenal 
      ulcer in active phase. At baseline and 6 weeks after the completion of treatment,
      clinical assessment, endoscopy with gastric biopsies, rapid urease test, 13C urea
      breath test, and serum laboratory analyses were performed. All patients were
      treated with pantoprazole 40 mg once daily, plus amoxycillin 1 gram tid and
      metronidazole 250 mg tid for 1 week, and pantoprazole 40 mg once daily for a
      second week. A clinical diary for daily assessment of symptoms and side effects
      was completed by patients during the treatment period. RESULTS: Three patients
      were discontinued from the study. Six weeks after therapy, the ulcer was healed
      in 47 of 48 patients (97.9%, 95% CI = 93.9-100). The cure rates of H. pylori
      infection, expressed using both the intention-to-treat and per protocol analyses,
      were 80.4% (95% CI = 69.5-91.3) and 85.4% (95% CI = 75.4-95.4), respectively. The
      therapy led to a significant, rapid disappearance or reduction in daytime
      epigastric pain, from 68.8% on day 1 to 82.2% on day 3 (p < 0.001) and in
      nocturnal epigastric pain, from 80.6% on day 1 to 93.3% on day 3 (p < 0.001).
      After 2 weeks of treatment, the percentage of patients completely free of pain
      was 82.2% for daytime pain and 90.3% for nocturnal pain. A rapid improvement in
      acid regurgitation, heartburn, nausea and vomiting was also observed with a
      median value of symptom disappearance of 2 days. The percentages of patients
      completely symptom-free were 37.5% after 1 day, 54.1% after 3 days, 75% after 2
      weeks, and 83.3% after 2 months. H. pylori-cured patients showed a significant
      decrease in the histological activity of both antral (p = 0.0001) and body (p <
      0.008) gastritis. Mild to moderate adverse events were reported by 15 patients.
      CONCLUSIONS: One week triple therapy with pantoprazole in combination with
      amoxycillin and metronidazole, followed by a second week of pantoprazole, was
      well tolerated and highly effective for the 1) rapid improvement or resolution of
      symptoms; 2) healing of the DU; 3) eradication of H. pylori infection; and, 4)
      reduction of histological signs of chronic gastritis activity.

TI  - Discontinuation rates of Helicobacter pylori treatment regimens: a meta-analysis.
PG  - 324-32
AB  - We conducted a meta-analysis to determine what factors in treatment regimens for 
      Helicobacter pylori are associated with increased discontinuation rates. Studies 
      were selected from the 1990-1996 MEDLINE data base, and references in published
      articles and reviews were obtained. Each article was uniformally abstracted for
      factors that could potentially affect dropout rates. Drug regimens with high
      numbers of doses per day had highest dropout rates (p=0.0001). The total dropout 
      rate was lowest for regimens containing a proton pump inhibitor (OR = 0.75, CI
      0.57, 0.98). The rate was high in regimens containing a bismuth compound due to
      side effects (OR = 2.79, CI 1.78, 4.36). The main finding was that drug regimens 
      for eradication of H. pylori that have a high number of doses per day result in
      higher discontinuation rates than regimens with fewer doses per day.

TI  - Importance of pH control in the management of GERD.
PG  - 649-57
AB  - The degree of esophageal mucosal injury that occurs in patients with
      gastroesophageal reflux disease depends on duration of exposure and pH of the
      refluxate. Evidence suggests that an intraesophageal pH of less than 4.0 directly
      correlates with the degree of mucosal injury. The advent of acid secretory
      inhibitors such as the histamine2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) and, more
      recently, the proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) has revolutionized the treatment of
      patients with reflux disease. However, the evidence linking the degree of mucosal
      damage to pH of the refluxate has prompted investigators to reevaluate the
      effectiveness of these agents. The PPIs are significantly more effective than the
      H2RAs in achieving and sustaining an intragastric pH above 4.0. The results of
      clinical trials performed with the PPIs indicate a faster rate of healing of
      erosive esophagitis and of symptom relief than treatment with H2RAs.

TI  - Treatment options for Helicobacter pylori infection when proton pump
      inhibitor-based triple therapy fails in clinical practice.
PG  - 489-96
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of Helicobacter pylori eradication regimens has not
      been extensively investigated in the clinical practice setting. The optimal
      treatment choice after an initial failed eradication attempt has not been
      determined. AIMS: To evaluate proton pump inhibitor-based triple therapies as
      first-line eradication regimens in clinical practice, and to establish the
      efficacy of second-line regimens in the context of an initial failed eradication 
      attempt. METHODS: Three hundred and eight patients with dyspepsia and evidence of
      H. pylori at endoscopy were recruited. As first-line therapy, 116 patients
      received omeprazole 20 mg b.d. in combination with amoxycillin 1 g b.d. and
      clarithromycin 500 mg b.d. (OAC) while 192 patients received omeprazole 20 mg
      b.d. in combination with metronidazole 400 mg b.d. and clarithromycin 250 mg b.d.
      (OMC). H. pylori status was reassessed at least 4 weeks after therapy (25
      patients failed to attend for further testing). Of 52 patients with an initial
      failed eradication attempt, 20 patients received a 1 week quadruple therapy
      regimen incorporating omeprazole 20 mg b.d., tripotassium dicitrato bismuthate
      120 mg q.d.s., tetracycline 500 mg q.d.s. and metronidazole 400 mg t.d.s., 20
      patients received a 2-week proton pump inhibitor-based triple therapy regimen as 
      described, and 12 patients received a further 1-week proton pump inhibitor-based 
      triple therapy regimen. RESULTS: Including 308 patients, the intention-to-treat
      (ITT) eradication rates for OAC and OMC as first-line regimens were 72% (95% CI: 
      63-80%) and 73% (95% CI: 67-79%) respectively. A per protocol (PP) analysis on
      the 283 patients who completed follow-up gives an initial eradication rate of 78%
      (95% CI: 69-86%) for OAC and 79% (95% CI: 73-85%) for OMC. There were 60 patients
      (21%; 95% CI: 17-26%) in whom the initial eradication attempt was unsuccessful.
      With second-line therapy, H. pylori was successfully eradicated in a further
      35/52 (67%; 95% CI: 58-73%) patients. The eradication rates with the quadruple
      regimen and 2-week triple therapy regimens were 75% (95% CI: 56-94%) and 80% (95%
      CI: 63-98%) respectively (P = 0. 71). The eradication rate with a repeat 1-week
      regimen was 33% (95% CI: 7-60%). CONCLUSIONS: The eradication rates achieved in
      this 'in practice' study with recommended first-line 1-week proton pump
      inhibitor-based triple therapy regimens were lower than the rates achieved with
      similar regimens in the clinical trial setting. A repeat 1-week proton pump
      inhibitor-based triple therapy regimen was not successful as a salvage therapy.
      Both the 2-week proton pump inhibitor-based triple therapy regimen and the 1-week
      quadruple therapy regimen were successful second-line treatments in >/=75% of
      patients.

TI  - Quality of life in arthritis patients using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
PG  - 129-33
AB  - Arthritis is a painful and disabling condition. To suppress the pain and the
      inflammatory process, patients are often chronic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
      drug (NSAID) users. Chronic use of NSAIDs may induce peptic ulcer, dyspeptic
      problems and heartburn. Therefore, these patients are often provided with
      treatment to relieve and/or protect against gastrointestinal problems. Rheumatic 
      disorders also affect a range of health-related quality of life domains. In one
      study, patients with NSAID-associated gastroduodenal lesions complained about
      lack of energy, sleep disturbances, emotional distress and social isolation in
      addition to pain and mobility limitations. The degree of distress and dysfunction
      differed markedly from scores in an unselected population. Clinical trial data
      suggest that acid-suppressing therapy with omeprazole is superior to therapy with
      misoprostol and ranitidine in healing gastroduodenal lesions and preventing
      abdominal pain, heartburn and indigestion symptoms during continued NSAID
      treatment. Because arthritic patients are severely incapacitated by their
      condition regarding most aspects of health-related quality of life, it is
      important to offer a treatment that is effective in healing and preventing
      NSAID-induced ulcers and gastrointestinal symptoms during continued NSAID
      treatment without further compromising the patients' quality of life. Treatment
      with omeprazole once daily has been shown to be superior to that with ranitidine 
      and misoprostol in this respect.

TI  - The effect of antibiotic therapy on bleeding from duodenal ulcer.
PG  - 950-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We conducted this study to test whether eradication of Helicobacter
      pylori (H. pylori) infection prevents hemorrhage related to duodenal ulcer.
      METHODS: Patients with H. pylori infection and endoscopically proven duodenal
      ulcers without ulcer-related hemorrhage were enrolled into four randomized,
      double-blind, multicenter studies using the same study protocol. They were
      treated with clarithromycin plus omeprazole (441 patients), omeprazole alone (447
      patients), or ranitidine alone (263 patients). Success of H. pylori eradication
      was evaluated by the 13C-urea breath test 4-6 wk after the last dose of study
      drug. Follow-up continued at monthly intervals up to 1 yr after the last dose of 
      study drug. RESULTS: Bleeding due to duodenal ulcer was not observed in any
      patients who received clarithromycin plus omeprazole, whereas five patients in
      the omeprazole treatment group and six patients in the ranitidine treatment group
      experienced an episode of ulcer-related hemorrhage during follow-up. All patients
      who experienced ulcer-related bleeding were male. When compared by bleeding,
      there were no significant differences with respect to ethnicity, alcohol
      consumption, or tobacco use. H. pylori infection was no longer detectable in 68% 
      of patients after treatment with clarithromycin plus omeprazole, compared with 5%
      after treatment with omeprazole alone or 4% after treatment with ranitidine
      alone. CONCLUSION: In a population of duodenal ulcer patients without
      predisposing risk factors for ulcer bleeding, antibiotic eradication or
      suppression of H. pylori infection prevented the occurrence of ulcer-related
      hemorrhage for up to 1 yr after therapy.

TI  - Omeprazole versus high-dose ranitidine in mild gastroesophageal reflux disease:
      short- and long-term treatment. The Dutch Reflux Study Group.
PG  - 931-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Patients with reflux esophagitis suffer from a chronic condition that 
      may cause considerable discomfort because of recurrent symptoms and diminished
      quality of life. This study was designed to evaluate acute and long-term
      treatment comparing standard doses of omeprazole and high-dose ranitidine.
      METHODS: Patients with endoscopically verified symptomatic esophagitis grade I or
      II were initially treated with omeprazole 20 mg daily or ranitidine 300 mg twice 
      daily for 4-8 wk. Patients who were symptom free were randomized to maintenance
      treatment with omeprazole 10 mg daily or ranitidine 150 mg twice daily. Patients 
      were seen every 3 months or at symptomatic relapse. RESULTS: The percentage of
      asymptomatic patients after 4 and 8 wk treatment were 61% and 74%, respectively, 
      for omeprazole and 31% and 50%, respectively, for ranitidine. Of 446 patients
      treated initially, 277 were asymptomatic, of whom 263 entered the maintenance
      study. The estimated proportion of patients in remission after 12 months of
      maintenance treatment with omeprazole 10 mg daily (n = 134) and ranitidine 150 mg
      twice daily (n = 129) were 68% and 39%, respectively (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS:
      Omeprazole 20 mg daily is superior to high-dose ranitidine in the symptomatic
      treatment of reflux esophagitis grade I and II. Furthermore, omeprazole at half
      the standard dose is more effective than ranitidine in a standard dose in keeping
      patients in remission for a period of 12 months.

TI  - Gastro-oesophageal reflux related cough and its response to laparoscopic
      fundoplication.
PG  - 963-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was designed to determine prospectively the rate of cough 
      before and after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication performed for the control of 
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. METHODS: One hundred and ninety five
      consecutive patients (76 men) of mean (SD) age 46.9 (14.1) years with proven
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, who were either on long term omeprazole (n =
      187) or who had not responded to a trial of omeprazole (n = 8), took part in the 
      study which was carried out in a university teaching hospital that included a
      regional respiratory referral centre. Patients underwent oesophageal manometry,
      24 hour oesophageal pH testing, and symptom score evaluation by an independent
      observer before and six months after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. RESULTS:
      One hundred and thirty three patients presented with reflux symptoms and 62 with 
      respiratory symptoms; 68% of patients complained of cough before surgery (86%
      with respiratory symptoms, 60% with gastrointestinal symptoms). The percentage
      reflux time in 24 hours fell significantly (p < 0.0001) from a mean (SD) of 9.38 
      (10.99)% to 1.22 (2.92)%, lower oesophageal sphincter tone rose significantly (p 
      < 0.0001) from a mean (SD) of 7.71 (5.90) mm Hg to 21.74 (10.84) mm Hg, and the
      cough score fell from a median value of 8.0 (IQR 12.0) to 0 (IQR 3) following
      surgery. Of the patients with cough, 51% were cough free after surgery and 31%
      improved. The patients with respiratory symptoms had a higher cough score before 
      (median 12.0 (IQR 5.5) versus 4.0 (IQR 8.75), p < 0.0001) and after surgery
      (median 1 (7.5) versus 0.0 (IQR 1.0), p = 0.0045) than those with
      gastrointestinal symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who present to
      gastroenterologists with severe reflux commonly complain of cough. Laparoscopic
      Nissen fundoplication is effective in the control of cough in patients with
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, with or without primary respiratory disease.

      men.
PG  - 911-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel study was conducted on the
      effect of mibefradil, both an L- and T-type Ca2+-channel blocker with a more
      selective blockade of T-type channels, administered once daily for 1 week to
      normal male subjects, on blood pressure, intracellular cationic concentrations,
      sodium-proton exchange rate and 3H-thymidine incorporation in peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMC). METHODS: After a 1-week run-in period on placebo, the
      subjects (n = 40) were allocated to a placebo or a mibefradil group. Placebo or
      50 mg mibefradil was administered once daily in the morning for 1 week. All
      subjects were investigated at baseline and after 1 week of placebo or mibefradil 
      administration. Standing or recumbent blood pressure and heart rate of subjects
      in the mibefradil group was decreased (P < 0.05 or less) compared with that of
      subjects in the placebo group. RESULTS: Decreased (P < 0.001) intracellular free 
      Ca2+ concentration and reduced (P < 0.001) 3H-thymidine incorporation in the PBMC
      were observed in the mibefradil-treated subjects. The intracellular sodium,
      potassium or magnesium concentration as well as the sodium-proton exchange rate
      were not changed during mibefradil administration. CONCLUSION: The blood pressure
      lowering action of mibefradil in men is accompanied by a decrease in
      intracellular free Ca2+ concentration. Mibefradil also reduced the 3H-thymidine
      incorporation or de novo DNA synthesis in PBMC by modulating the calcium
      homeostasis.

TI  - Prescription of acid-suppressing drugs in relation to endoscopic diagnosis: a
      record-linkage study.
PG  - 397-405
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although widely used, few data are available on the appropriateness
      of prescribing of acid-suppressing drugs (ASDs), despite guidelines on the
      investigation and treatment of dyspeptic patients. METHODS: We created a database
      of 62 000 endoscopy examinations and record-linked these to a prescribing
      database. Endoscopic diagnoses were classified into peptic, nonpeptic and others.
      The H2-antagonists, omeprazole and misoprostol, were studied. RESULTS: 35 000
      patients had one or more endoscopies during 1978-93; two-thirds were over 45
      years of age at first endoscopy. A quarter of all patients who had been
      endoscoped had consistently normal examinations. Peptic oesophageal pathology was
      the commonest positive finding. A quarter of those prescribed ASDs between 1989
      and 1993 had been endoscoped between 1978 and 1993. In those with a peptic
      diagnosis prescribed any ASD, the pathologies found were: oesophageal (42.9%),
      duodenal (36.3%) and gastro-pyloric (21.3%). Patients prescribed omeprazole were 
      more likely to have undergone endoscopy than those prescribed other ASDs, and
      they were also more likely to have peptic oesophageal pathology. Long-term
      prescribing (>56 days per year) occurred in two-thirds of patients prescribed
      ASDs and 40% had at least one endoscopy. In those prescribed short-term ASDs, 20%
      had undergone at least one endoscopy. Peptic and nonpeptic endoscopic pathology
      was associated with increased ASD prescribing, but a normal endoscopy did not
      reduce prescribing. CONCLUSION: ASD prescribing appeared to be mainly
      symptom-driven. Positive endoscopic findings increased the prescribing of ASDs,
      but normal findings did not reduce it.

TI  - Furazolidone-containing short-term triple therapies are effective in the
      treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection.
PG  - 317-22
AB  - BACKGROUND: A furazolidone-containing therapeutic regimen for Helicobacter pylori
      infection has attracted special interest in the face of a rising world-wide
      metronidazole resistant H. pylori, and the expense of currently used
      antimicrobial regimens. AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of furazolidone-containing 
      regimens in eradicating H. pylori. METHODS: One-hundred and forty H. pylori
      positive patients with endoscopically confirmed duodenal ulcer or functional
      dyspepsia received one of four different regimens to eradicate H. pylori. In the 
      first trial, the patients were randomly assigned to receive a 1-week course of
      furazolidone 100 mg b.d. and clarithromycin 250 mg b.d., with either tripotassium
      dicitrato bismuthate (TDB) 240 mg b.d. (FCB group) or lansoprazole 30 mg daily
      (FCL group). In the second trial, the patients were randomly assigned to receive 
      a 1-week course of clarithromycin 250 mg b.d. and omeprazole 20 mg daily, with
      either furazolidone 100 mg b.d. (FCO group) or metronidazole 400 mg b.d. (MCO
      group). Endoscopy was repeated 4 weeks following completion of therapy with
      re-assessment of H. pylori status on gastric biopsies by histology and culture.
      RESULTS: Four patients (1 in FCB, 1 in FCO and 2 in MCO groups) dropped out
      because they refused a follow-up endoscopy. Eradication rates of H. pylori on an 
      intention-to-treat basis in the FCB, FCL, FCO and MCO groups were 91% (32/35, 95%
      CI: 82-99%), 91% (32/35, CI: 82-99%), 86% (30/35, CI: 74-97%) and 74% (26/35, CI:
      60-89%) (all P > 0.05), respectively. Mild side-effects occurred in 15% of the
      140 patients. In MCO group, the eradication rate in the patients infected with
      metronidazole-sensitive isolates of H. pylori was 86%, but dropped to 67% in
      those with metronidazole-resistance strains (P = 0.198). CONCLUSION: One-week
      regimens containing furazolidone and clarithromycin in combination with TDB or a 
      proton pump inhibitor fulfil the criteria for successful H. pylori therapy.

PG  - 311-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: When metronidazole is used in bismuth-based or proton pump
      inhibitor-based triple therapy, the cure rate of Helicobacter pylori is usually
      high. However, metronidazole-resistant H. pylori strains, which are increasing in
      frequency, are a major cause of failed H. pylori eradication. AIM: To evaluate
      the efficacy of non-metronidazole containing bismuth-based triple therapy for H. 
      pylori infection. METHODS: One-hundred and eighty H. pylori-positive patients
      with endoscopically documented peptic ulcer disease or functional dyspepsia were 
      randomly assigned to one of three 1-week regimens containing tripotassium
      dicitrato bismuthate (also called colloidal bismuth subcitrate) 240 mg b.d. and
      two antibiotics: furazolidone 100 mg b.d. plus clarithromycin 250 mg b.d. (Group 
      A); or clarithromycin 250 mg b.d. plus amoxycillin 1000 mg b.d. (Group B); or
      furazolidone 100 mg b.d. plus josamycin 1000 mg b.d. (Group C). H. pylori status 
      was assessed by rapid urease test, histology and culture of gastric biopsy
      specimens taken from both the antrum and corpus, both before and at least 4 weeks
      after completion of therapy. RESULTS: Thirteen patients dropped out (3 in group
      A, 5 in group B and 5 in group C). Based on an intention-to-treat analysis, the
      eradication rates achieved in groups A, B and C were 88% (53/60), 58% (35/60) and
      77% (46/60), respectively. These differences were significant between groups A
      and B (P < 0.001), as well as between groups B and C (P < 0.05). Side-effects
      occurred in 7 (12%) patients in group A, 3 (5%) in group B and 8 (13%) in group
      C, and were mild, with the exception of vomiting in one patient (group C) that
      resulted in withdrawal from the study. CONCLUSION: One-week triple therapy,
      consisting of tripotassium dicitrato bismuthate, low-dose furazolidone and
      low-dose clarithromycin, achieves a high cure rate of H. pylori.

TI  - Triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori eradication is more effective than
      long-term maintenance antisecretory treatment in the prevention of recurrence of 
      duodenal ulcer: a prospective long-term follow-up study.
PG  - 303-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of Helicobacter pylori eradication treatment and
      long term acid suppression maintenance in the natural course of duodenal ulcer
      has not been directly compared. AIM: To compare in a prospective randomized study
      the effectiveness of H. pylori eradication on the prevention of recurrence of
      duodenal ulcer with long-term maintenance acid suppression therapy. METHODS: One 
      hundred and fourteen duodenal ulcer patients were randomized to the treatment
      over a 12-month period. Fifty-seven of them received triple therapy consisting of
      1 g sucralfate q.d.s. for 28 days, 300 mg metronidazole q.d.s. for 14 days and
      250 mg clarithromycin q.d.s. for 14 days. Another 57 received 20 mg omeprazole
      q.d.s. for 12 months. An upper endoscopy was performed before treatment, at 6
      weeks, and 2, 6 and 12 months after the first endoscopy. Side-effects were
      self-recorded and clinical follow-ups were arranged for up to 4.25 years.
      RESULTS: The ulcer healing rate was 90.2% (95% confidence interval (95% CI):
      79-97%) in the omeprazole group at 6 weeks as compared to 83.3% (95% CI: 70-93%) 
      in the triple therapy group (P = 0.38). There was a higher success rate of pain
      control in the omeprazole group. Side-effects were more frequently reported and
      compliance was poorer in the triple therapy group during the first 4 weeks.
      During follow-up, more relapses were seen in the omeprazole group (9.8%, 95% CI: 
      3-21%) than the triple therapy group (4.2%, 95% CI: 1-13%) at 1 year (P = 0.44). 
      All relapses were due to the persistence of H. pylori infection. At the 1 year
      follow-up, none of the patients who were H. pylori negative had an endoscopic
      relapse compared to 7 out of 56 patients who remained H. pylori positive (12.5%, 
      95% CI: 5-24%, P = 0.018). After a mean follow-up of 4.07 years, none of those
      who remained H. pylori negative had an ulcer relapse while the 11 out of 41 who
      remained H. pylori positive had an ulcer relapse (26.8%, 95% CI 14-43, P = 0.
      0005). CONCLUSIONS: Both regimens were highly effective in healing ulcers. The
      eradication of H. pylori infection was associated with more side-effects and poor
      compliance but was more effective than the maintenance therapy in reducing the
      recurrence of duodenal ulcers. For the prevention of ulcer recurrence, testing of
      H. pylori status after triple therapy is more important than maintenance therapy.

TI  - The DU-MACH study: eradication of Helicobacter pylori and ulcer healing in
      patients with acute duodenal ulcer using omeprazole based triple therapy.
PG  - 289-95
AB  - AIM: To investigate the efficacy of two omeprazole triple therapies for the
      eradication of Helicobacter pylori, ulcer healing and ulcer relapse during a
      6-month treatment-free period in patients with active duodenal ulcer. METHODS:
      This was a double-blind, randomized study in 15 centres across Canada. Patients
      (n = 149) were randomized to omeprazole 20 mg once daily (O) or one of two 1-week
      b. d. eradication regimens: omeprazole 20 mg, metronidazole 400 mg and
      clarithromycin 250 mg (OMC) or omeprazole 20 mg, amoxycillin 1000 mg and
      clarithromycin 500 mg (OAC). All patients were treated for three additional weeks
      with omeprazole 20 mg once daily. Ulcer healing was assessed by endoscopy after 4
      weeks of study therapy. H. pylori eradication was determined by a 13C-urea breath
      test and histology, performed at pre-entry, at 4 weeks after the end of all
      therapy and at 6 months. RESULTS: The intention-to-treat (intention-to-treat)
      analysis contained 146 patients and the per protocol (per protocol) analysis, 114
      patients. The eradication rates were (intention-to-treat/per protocol): OMC-85%
      and 92%, OAC-78% and 87% and O-0% (O). Ulcer healing (intention-to-treat) was
      greater than 90% in all groups. The differences in the eradication and relapse
      rates between O vs. OMC and O vs. OAC were statistically significant (all, P <
      0.001). Treatment was well tolerated and compliance was high. CONCLUSION: The OMC
      and OAC 1-week treatment regimens are safe and effective for eradication, healing
      and the prevention of relapse in duodenal ulcer patients.

TI  - Basal and stimulated gastrin and pepsinogen levels after eradication of
      Helicobacter pylori: a 1-year follow-up study.
PG  - 189-200
AB  - AIM: A decrease in gastrin and pepsinogen (PG) levels 1 month after Helicobacter 
      pylori eradication has been described repeatedly, but the long-term progression
      of such a decrease has been scarcely studied. We therefore studied the effect of 
      H. pylori eradication on basal and stimulated gastrin and PG levels for 1 year.
      Initially, the usefulness of measuring these parameters for the noninvasive
      diagnosis of H. pylori eradication was validated. Furthermore, an assessment was 
      made of the association between H. pylori reinfection and a re-increase in
      gastrin and PG values. Finally, an evaluation was made of the variables
      influencing gastrin and PG concentration, with particular attention to H. pylori 
      infection and histological lesions of gastric mucosa. METHODS: Two-hundred and
      twenty-two patients with duodenal ulcer were studied prospectively. Exclusion
      criteria were the administration of antibiotics, H2 antagonists, omeprazole or
      bismuth prior to endoscopy. In all patients serum basal levels of gastrin, PGI,
      and PGII were measured before and 1 month after completing eradication therapy.
      In the successfully eradicated patients, gastrin, PGI, and PGII were also
      measured at 6 and 12 months. In 80 patients stimulated measurements of gastrin
      (after ingestion of two beef cubes) and PGI (after injection of pentagastrin)
      were also performed. H. pylori-negative patients after therapy underwent a urea
      breath test at 6 and 12 months, and patients who had stimulated gastrin and PG
      concentration measured had also an endoscopy performed at 6 months. RESULTS: H.
      pylori was eradicated in 73% of patients. A histological improvement was observed
      1 month after completing H. pylori eradication therapy, both at gastric antrum
      and body (P < 0.001), while a further improvement at antrum was demonstrated at 6
      months (P < 0.01). With regard to the different cut-off points for decreased
      basal and stimulated measurements for diagnosing H. pylori eradication, the best 
      results were obtained, respectively, with PGII (sensitivity of 90% and
      specificity of 76%) and PGI 30 min after stimulation (sensitivity and specificity
      of 82%), with an area under the ROC curve of 0.87 in both cases. In the multiple 
      regressions analysis H. pylori status correlated with gastrin, PGI and PGII after
      therapy (P < 0.001), while histological lesions correlated only with gastrin
      levels (P < 0.05). A decrease in basal and stimulated serum parameters was
      demonstrated immediately after eradication (Wilcoxon test, P < 0.001), and an
      additional decrease (at 6 months) was observed just in PGI (Friedman test, P <
      0.01). However, gastrin and PGII values remained unchanged after the first month 
      post-eradication. Seven patients were reinfected with H. pylori during follow-up.
      Quantitation of basal and stimulated gastrin and PGI levels was not reliable as a
      reinfection marker. Regarding basal PGII, the parallelism was strong at 6 months 
      (re-increase in all four reinfected patients), although only in one out of three 
      with reinfection at 1 year did PGII rise at that stage. CONCLUSIONS: (1)
      Measurement of gastrin and PG levels (especially basal PGII values) is a useful
      non-invasive method to confirm H. pylori eradication after therapy. (2) H. pylori
      eradication is associated with a significant decrease in basal and stimulated
      gastrin levels and in basal PGII levels that is detected immediately (1 month)
      after finishing treatment, and remains unchanged for 1 year. However, the
      decrease in basal and stimulated PGI levels occurs progressively for 6 months,
      although such levels remain also unchanged afterwards. (3) Measurement of gastrin
      and PGI concentrations has a limited usefulness in the diagnosis of H. pylori
      reinfections after successful eradication, although PGII determination could be
      more useful in this situation.

TI  - Gastroesophageal reflux disease: diagnosis and management.
PG  - 1161-9, 1199
AB  - Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a chronic, relapsing condition with
      associated morbidity and an adverse impact on quality of life. The disease is
      common, with an estimated lifetime prevalence of 25 to 35 percent in the U.S.
      population. GERD can usually be diagnosed based on the clinical presentation
      alone. In some patients, however, the diagnosis may require endoscopy and,
      rarely, ambulatory pH monitoring. Management includes lifestyle modifications and
      pharmacologic therapy; refractory disease requires surgery. The therapeutic goals
      are to control symptoms, heal esophagitis and maintain remission so that
      morbidity is decreased and quality of life is improved.

TI  - Safety profile of Lansoprazole: the US clinical trial experience.
PG  - 195-205
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Lansoprazole has undergone extensive clinical evaluation for the
      treatment of acid-peptic diseases. The aim of this study was to define the safety
      profile of lansoprazole and compare it to that of other therapeutic agents
      evaluated in the same controlled trials. METHODS: The clinical safety profile of 
      lansoprazole and comparative agents (placebo, ranitidine and omeprazole) was
      reviewed for 3281 patients who participated in short term (up to 8 weeks) and
      long term (up to 56 months) clinical trials conducted in the US. Adverse events, 
      laboratory value changes and gastric biopsy changes that occurred during
      treatment were compared statistically for differences between treatments.
      RESULTS: The incidence of adverse events and number of patients discontinuing
      treatment because of adverse events was similar for lansoprazole and comparative 
      agents. Other than elevated serum gastrin levels, a known effect of proton pump
      inhibitors, no trends in laboratory changes were observed. Median values for
      gastrin levels remained within the normal range; about 2% of patients had gastrin
      levels >400 pg/ml at any time, while <1% had 2 or more gastrin values >500 pg/ml.
      Values returned to baseline levels after therapy was discontinued. No significant
      changes in gastric endocrine cell growth from baseline to final visit were
      observed, nor was there evidence of dysplasia or neoplasia. CONCLUSION:
      Lansoprazole is well tolerated for both short and long term treatment of
      acid-related disease. The tolerability of lansoprazole is comparable to that of
      ranitidine, omeprazole and placebo in the treatment of these diseases.

TI  - Reliability of the omeprazole hydroxylation index for CYP2C19 phenotyping:
      possible effect of age, liver disease and length of therapy.
PG  - 115-9
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the reliability of the omeprazole hydroxylation index as a
      marker for polymorphic CYP2C19 activity in a Japanese population of healthy young
      subjects (n = 78) and patients with peptic ulcer (n = 72). METHODS: Healthy
      subjects were administered a single dose of omeprazole (20 mg), whereas patients 
      received 20 mg daily for at least 1 week. The ratio of the serum concentration of
      omeprazole to hydroxyomeprazole at 3 h postdose was determined and used as a
      measure of CYP2C19 activity. The CYP2C19 wild type (wt) gene and four mutant
      alleles associated with the poor metaboliser phenotype of (S)-mephenytoin,
      CYP2C19*2 in exon 5, CYP2C19*3 in exon 4, CYP2C19m4 in exon 9, and CYP2C19m3 in
      the initial codon were analysed. RESULTS: In the healthy volunteer study there
      was complete concordance between genotype and phenotype. However, eight of the
      patients who had the EM genotype had a high value for their hydroxylation index, 
      and were classified as phenotypic PMs. No CYP2C19m4 and CYP2C19m3 mutations were 
      detected in the eight mismatched patients. They were all genotypic heterozygous
      EMs, elderly (> or = 65 years) and/or had hepatic disease. Therefore, impaired
      CYP2C19 activity combined with partial saturation of omeprazole metabolism during
      multiple dosing may have contributed to the discrepancy between CYP2C19
      genotyping and phenotyping. CONCLUSION: Although omeprazole has been used instead
      of mephenytoin as a probe for polymorphic CYP2C19, it does not appear to be
      reliable enough for clinical application in Japanese patients.

TI  - Simple closure of perforated duodenal ulcer.
PG  - 309-11
AB  - A study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of simple closure followed by
      drug therapy in cases of perforated duodenal ulcer and to identify the risk
      factors in relation to the mortality. The male to female ratio was 5:1. Of the
      patients 59.2% were up to 50 years of age, while 40.8% were above the age of 50
      years. Of the patients 47% were admitted 24 hours after the onset of peritonitis.
      All these patients were surgically treated with simple closure of the perforation
      with omental patch. Nine patients expired leading to 7.5% mortality. The risk
      factors identified for mortality were age 60 years and above, presence of shock
      on admission and delayed presentation. The mortality is directly related to the
      number of risk factors present in a given patient. At the time of discharge the
      patients were advised to take orally famotidine 40 mg at bed time for a period of
      8 weeks. Eighty-one patients could be followed up and Visick grading was done.
      Sixty-two patients were in grade I, 11 in grade II, 3 in grade III and 5 in grade
      IV. The results indicate that simple closure followed by drug therapy is
      acceptable treatment for perforated duodenal ulcer.

      for Helicobacter pylori infection. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of two
      1-week low-dose triple-therapy drug regimens involving antisecretory drugs for
      Helicobacter pylori infection, 99 patients with H. pylori infection were treated 
      with either lansoprazole (LPZ) or ranitidine (RNT) used together with

TI  - Antimicrobial treatment of H. pylori infection--a pooled efficacy analysis of
      eradication therapies.
PG  - 16-26
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical efficacy of available therapies directed
      towards Helicobacter pylori eradication. DESIGN: Pooled overall analyses of a
      limited number of drug combinations regardless of dosage, duration, formulation
      etc. SUBJECTS: Helicobacter pylori infected patients with or without
      complications. INTERVENTIONS: Efficacy data from all studies included in the
      analysis are transformed to or retained as intention to treat data. MAIN OUTCOME:
      Efficacy is presented as proportion of patients cured from the infection.
      Confidence intervals are enlarged by 1.5 due to the inferior strength of a pooled
      analysis. RESULTS: Dual therapies are ineffective. Triple therapies cure 70-90%
      of the patients. Well documented high efficacy is shown for a proton pump
      inhibitor plus two antimicrobials. Less studied but effective alternatives are
      ranitidine-bismuth plus two antimicrobials. CONCLUSION: A proton pump inhibitor
      plus two antimicrobials is the best validated highly effective type of
      eradication therapy.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori clearance and serum gastrin and pepsinogen I concentrations
      in omeprazole treatment of duodenal ulcer patients.
PG  - 817-20
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine which demographic factors may influence serum gastrin and
      pepsinogen I (PGI) levels in duodenal ulcer patients undergoing omeprazole
      treatment. METHODS: We conducted an outpatient-based prospective study in the
      Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, to investigate the pharmacological effects on 
      patients with duodenal ulcers receiving omeprazole treatment for 4 weeks.
      Sixty-eight patients (61 males/7 females, aged 25 73 years) with endoscopically
      confirmed duodenal ulcer were included. Gastrin and pepsinogen I levels were
      measured before and after treatment. Demographic factors including age, sex,
      smoking, ulcer healing and antral Helicobacter pylori colonization/clearance were
      analyzed, in order to measure their probable influences on serum gastrin and
      pepsinogen I levels. RESULTS: Ulcer healing was seen in 92.6% of patients while
      48 (70.6%) antral clearances were seen in 66 H. pylori colonized patients at the 
      end of trial. Omeprazole monotherapy led to a marked elevation of serum gastrin
      (85.8 pg x ml(-1), SD 32.0 pg x ml(-1) vs 133.9 pg x ml(-1), SD 71.6 pg x ml(-1),
      P < 0.01), and pepsinogen I (111.0 ng x ml(-1), SD 36.7 ng x ml(-1) vs 253.6 ng x
      ml(-1) , SD 64.8 ng x ml(-1), P < 0.01) levels when measured on day 29. Only
      patients showing antral H. pylori clearance exhibited an influence on the
      magnitude of pepsinogen I elevation following omeprazole monotherapy (143.9%, SD 
      67.3% vs 78.6%, SD 51.2%, P < 0.01). Moreover, the sensitivity and specificity of
      serum pepsinogen I variations were plotted on a receiving operating
      characteristic (ROC) curve. The 140% increased pepsinogen I level yielded a
      maximum accuracy of 80% specificity or 50% sensitivity to predict antral H.
      pylori clearance. CONCLUSION: Antral H. pylori clearance is at least partially
      responsible for the omeprzaole-induced hyperpepsinogenemia I. The magnitude of
      hyperpepsinogenemia I probably provides a non-invasive alternative for predicting
      H. pylori clearance.

TI  - Symptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux disease: double blind controlled study of
      intermittent treatment with omeprazole or ranitidine. The European Study Group.
PG  - 502-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess intermittent treatment over 12 months in patients with
      symptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. DESIGN: Randomised, multicentre,
      double blind, controlled study. Patients with heartburn and normal endoscopy
      results or mild erosive changes received omeprazole 10 mg or 20 mg daily or
      ranitidine 150 mg twice daily for 2 weeks. Patients remaining symptomatic had
      omeprazole 10 mg or ranitidine dose doubled for another 2 weeks while omeprazole 
      20 mg was continued for 2 weeks. Patients who were symptomatic or mildly
      symptomatic were followed up for 12 months. Recurrences of moderate or severe
      heartburn during follow up were treated with the dose which was successful for
      initial symptom control. SETTING: Hospitals and primary care practices between
      1994 and 1996. SUBJECTS: 677 patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total time off active treatment, time to failure of
      intermittent treatment, and outcomes ranked from best to worst. RESULTS: 704
      patients were randomised, 677 were eligible for analyses; 318 reached the end of 
      the study with intermittent treatment without recourse to maintenance
      antisecretory drugs. The median number of days off active treatment during follow
      up was 142 for the entire study (281 for the 526 patients who reached a treatment
      related end point). Thus, about half the patients did not require treatment for
      at least 6 months, and this was similar in all three treatment groups. According 
      to outcome, 378 (72%) patients were in the best outcome ranks (no relapse or one 
      (or more) relapse but in remission until 12 months); 630 (93%) had three or fewer
      relapses in the intermittent treatment phase. Omeprazole 20 mg provided faster
      relief of heartburn. The results were similar in patients with erosive and
      non-erosive disease. CONCLUSIONS: Intermittent treatment is effective in managing
      symptoms of heartburn in half of patients with uncomplicated gastro-oesophageal
      reflux disease. It is simple and applicable in general practice, where most
      patients are seen.

      subsequent colon cancer has been controversial. Using data collected as part of
      an incident case-control study of colon cancer conducted in northern California, 
      Minnesota, and Utah, we evaluated this association. METHODS: Participants were
      between 30 and 79 yr of age and had a first primary colon cancer diagnosed
      between October 1, 1991 and September 30, 1994. Analyses were adjusted for age,
      gender, family history of colorectal cancer, body mass index, dietary energy and 
      fiber intake, use of aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and
      long-term leisure-time vigorous physical activity. RESULTS: A weak positive
      association between cholecystectomy and proximal colon cancer (odds ratio [OR]
      and 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3 [1.0-1.6]) was observed. This was
      counterbalanced by a weak, nonsignificant negative association (OR 0.8, 95% CI
      0.6-1.1) with distal colon cancer leading to no overall association (OR 1.0, 95% 
      CI 0.9-1.2). The association between colon cancer and cholecystectomy did not
      differ by gender or race, but it did differ by study area, with most of the
      increased association being attributed to the Minnesota population. The elevated 
      risk of proximal colon cancer increased after cholecystectomy but disappeared
      after 14 years. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that cholecystectomy or the
      underlying gallstone disease that prompts it may be related weakly to the risk of
      subsequent proximal colon cancer. However, the association may differ by
      geographic area of the country, and may be artifactual at least in part.

TI  - Classification of dyspepsia. Identification of independent symptom components in 
      7270 consecutive, unselected dyspepsia patients from general practice.
PG  - 1262-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several attempts to classify dyspepsia into subgroups have been
      proposed as a basis for empirical treatment and research. However, subgrouping
      has proved difficult due to overlap of symptoms between subgroups, and the
      response to empirical therapy is difficult to predict. We aimed to study whether 
      natural symptom combinations occur in patients seeing general practitioners
      because of dyspepsia and whether symptom presentation could predict the effect of
      proton pump inhibitor treatment. METHODS: The symptom presentation of 7270
      consecutive, unselected patients with dyspepsia in general practice was studied
      by using principal-components analysis. The relation to the effect of omeprazole 
      was studied in a subsample (n=471) with predominantly reflux-like or ulcer-like
      dyspepsia being included in a controlled clinical trial of omeprazole versus
      placebo. RESULTS: Four principal components (factors), explaining 36% of the
      total variance, were found. They describe four independent dimensions in the
      symptoms of dyspepsia that can be interpreted meaningfully as representing A)
      acid-related disease of the upper gastrointestinal tract, B) irritable bowel
      disorder, C) dysmotility of the stomach/duodenum, and D) dysmotility of the
      esophagus. In the subsample the response to proton pump inhibition therapy was
      associated with high component-A scores, low component-B scores, and low
      component-C scores. A pocket chart was devised to obtain the component scores
      easily in new patients. CONCLUSION: The analysis identified four characteristic, 
      biologically meaningful dyspepsia components that express independent dimensions 
      in the symptoms of patients with dyspepsia. The symptom scores corresponding to
      the four components may improve symptom-based diagnosis and thereby empirical
      therapy. In particular, the association between component scores and the effect
      of omeprazole suggests that classifying dyspepsia on the basis of these
      components may focus empirical omeprazole therapy even more.

TI  - Treatment with proton pump inhibitors induces tolerance to histamine-2 receptor
      antagonists in Helicobacter pylori-negative patients.
PG  - 1244-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment with H2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) and proton pump
      inhibitors (PPIs) induces hypergastrinemia and causes rebound hypersecretion of
      gastric acid after treatment, and during treatment with H2RAs tolerance develops.
      In the present study we investigated whether a treatment period with a PPI
      induced tolerance to an H2RA. METHODS: Thirteen patients with esophagitis were
      given omeprazole for 90 days. Twenty-four-hour pH monitorings without and with
      ranitidine were performed before and after treatment with omeprazole. Blood
      samples and biopsy specimens from the oxyntic mucosa were analyzed for gastrin,
      histamine, and chromogranin A. RESULTS: An increase in mucosal histamine and a
      reduction in the effect of ranitidine on gastric pH was found 14 days after
      discontinuing omeprazole compared with before treatment in Helicobacter
      pylori-negative but not in H. pylori-positive patients. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment
      with omeprazole reduces the effect of ranitidine in H. pylori-negative patients. 
      This is caused by an increase in histamine released by the enterochromaffin-like 
      cell secondarily to hypergastrinemia, corresponding to the tolerance towards
      H2RAs seen in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.

TI  - Comparison of the effect of lansoprazole and omeprazole on intragastric acidity
      and gastroesophageal reflux in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 1239-43
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lansoprazole (LAN) and omeprazole (OME) heal esophagitis effectively 
      and to similar extents, but LAN has a faster effect on the relief of symptoms of 
      gastroesophageal reflux. However, no strict comparison of the two proton pump
      inhibitors' effect on acid reflux and gastric acidity has been published. The aim
      of this study was to compare the effects of LAN and OME on gastroesophageal
      reflux with simultaneous measurements of gastric acidity in patients with
      established gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and esophagitis. METHODS:
      Fourteen patients with endoscopically verified erosive esophagitis and with a
      pretreatment esophageal 24-h pH measurement showing acid reflux to the esophagus 
      participated in the study. This was a double-blind, randomized study with
      crossover design. Before (day 0) and on the last day (day 5) of each treatment
      period with encapsulated 30 mg LAN or 20 mg OME daily, 24-h intraesophageal and
      intragastric acidity were measured with antimony electrodes connected to an
      ambulatory pH recording system. RESULTS: Ten of 14 patients completed the study. 
      There were no differences in intragastric or intraesophageal acidity or the
      number of reflux episodes on day 0 between the two treatments. Both LAN and OME
      treatments increased the median and nocturnal intragastric pH and decreased the
      24-h area under the time curve for intragastric acidity significantly and to
      about the same extent (79% and 69% acid inhibition by LAN and OME, respectively) 
      (NS). However, the percentage of time with pH below 4 in the esophagus was
      significantly less during LAN treatment (1.92% +/- 2.29; mean +/- standard
      deviation) than during OME treatment (4.76% +/- 2.88%) on day 5 (P = 0.002).
      There were also significantly fewer reflux episodes >5 min during treatment with 
      LAN (1.00 +/- 1.33) than with OME (2.90 +/- 2.42) at the end of the treatment
      period (P = 0.031). CONCLUSIONS: In this study lansoprazole and omeprazole had a 
      comparable effect on gastric acidity in patients with established GERD with
      esophagitis. However, 30 mg lansoprazole daily reduced the acidity in the
      oesophagus and the number of refluxes more effectively than 20 mg omeprazole
      daily. This might indicate that proton pump inhibitors affect the esophageal
      clearance and/or influence the lower esophageal sphincter differently.

TI  - The Second Canadian Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Consensus: moving forward to 
      new concepts.
PG  - 551-6
AB  - Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a disease with serious consequences
      that may result in significant impairment in quality of life and disease
      morbidity. Across all grades of severity of symptoms and severity of underlying
      esophageal disease, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) provide therapeutic gains over 
      prokinetics (PKs) or H2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs). The potential cost
      effectiveness of using medications with higher acquisition costs that may lower
      health care costs overall is often disregarded when conducting cost comparisons
      with medications having lower 'up-front' costs. Limiting therapy to less
      effective agents condemns many patients to protracted suffering, repeated
      physician visits and needless reinvestigation of symptoms that could have been
      resolved by appropriate initial therapy. Based on current data, use of any
      classification of symptom severity as a basis for selecting one class of
      therapeutic agents over another for first line therapy (i.e. PKs, H2RAs for
      'mild' GERD, versus a PPI for 'severe' disease) is unwarranted.

TI  - Correlation of ambulatory 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring results with symptom
      improvement in patients with noncardiac chest pain due to gastroesophageal reflux
      disease.
PG  - 36-9
AB  - Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) accounts for up to 60% of patients with
      noncardiac chest pain (NCCP). Twenty-four-hour esophageal pH monitoring has been 
      considered the most sensitive test for identifying acid reflux as the probable
      cause for chest pain. It is unclear if there is a correlation between the degree 
      of esophageal acid exposure as determined by 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring and
      symptom improvement during a short course of high-dose omeprazole (the omeprazole
      test) in patients with NCCP due to GERD. Twenty-three patients with GERD-related 
      NCCP were studied. All patients were referred by a cardiologist and evaluated by 
      upper endoscopy and 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring. Diagnosis of GERD was
      defined by one or both tests being abnormal. Subsequently, patients underwent
      baseline symptom intensity assessment during 1 week off therapy followed by 1
      week on therapy with high-dose omeprazole (40 mg A.M. and 20 mg P.M.). There was 
      a statistically significant correlation between the esophageal acid exposure by
      24-hour esophageal pH monitoring and the change in symptom intensity score after 
      treatment. However, there was no significant correlation between the pH values
      and symptom intensity score during baseline or during the omeprazole test. In
      patients with GERD-related NCCP undergoing the omeprazole test, 24-hour
      esophageal pH monitoring has a therapeutic predictive value in addition to its
      diagnostic merit. Patients with greater esophageal acid exposure appear to have a
      greater response to antireflux treatment.

TI  - Health-related quality of life outcomes of omeprazole versus ranitidine in poorly
      responsive symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 284-91
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated changes in health-related quality of life (HRQL) 
      outcomes of once-daily omeprazole compared with ranitidine for the short-term
      treatment of patients with poorly responsive symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux 
      disease (GERD). METHODS: A double-blind, randomized clinical trial, compared
      omeprazole versus ranitidine for the treatment of poorly responsive GERD.
      Eligible patients had a history of predominant heartburn symptoms with
      symptomatic heartburn after 6 weeks of ranitidine treatment. Patients were
      randomized to omeprazole 20 mg once daily (n = 156) or ranitidine 150 mg twice
      daily (n = 161) and followed for 8 weeks. Assessments were completed at baseline 
      and after 8 weeks with physician-rated symptoms: Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating 
      Scale (GSRS); Psychological General Well-Being (PGWB) Index; Sleep Scale; Impact 
      on Daily Activities Scale, and Overall Treatment Effect. Primary HRQL endpoints
      were the GSRS reflux scale and PGWB total score. RESULTS: No differences between 
      the 2 treatment groups were observed in baseline demographic, clinical or HRQL
      measures. After 8 weeks, omeprazole-treated patients had greater improvement in
      GSRS reflux scale scores (p<0.0001) and PGWB total scores (p = 0. 019) compared
      with ranitidine-treated patients. Significant between group differences favoring 
      omeprazole were also observed in GSRS total scores (p<0.0001), abdominal pain
      scale scores (p = 0.003), and indigestion scale scores (p = 0.003), Impact on
      Daily Activities (p = 0.001), PGWB positive well-being (p = 0.015), anxiety (p = 
      0. 030), and general health scale scores (p = 0.010). Patient ratings of overall 
      treatment effect demonstrated the significantly (p<0. 0001) greater benefits of
      omeprazole (mean = 5.26) compared with ranitidine treatment (mean = 3.83).
      CONCLUSIONS: Omeprazole treatment significantly reduced persistent reflux-related
      symptoms and normalized psychological well-being compared with ranitidine in
      poorly responsive symptomatic patients with GERD.

TI  - Evaluation of omeprazole as a cost-effective diagnostic test for
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 59-66
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a need for a simple, therapeutic test that is of diagnostic 
      value and can also provide rapid symptom relief in patients who present with
      classic, mild symptoms suggestive of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD),
      when the diagnosis is based on symptom assessment alone. AIM: To assess the
      diagnostic value of a therapeutic trial of omeprazole 40 mg in a dyspeptic
      population. METHODS: A total of 90 patients with symptoms suggestive of GERD
      entered the study. Patients underwent endoscopy and ambulatory oesophageal pH
      monitoring for 18-24 h. Patients then received omeprazole 40 mg o.m. for 2 weeks.
      RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between the diagnoses obtained from 
      a trial of omeprazole and the diagnoses obtained from pH monitoring (P < 0. 05). 
      There was no significant correlation between the diagnoses obtained from
      endoscopy and those obtained from pH monitoring. Both omeprazole and endoscopy
      were compared to pH monitoring as the 'gold standard' for the diagnosis of GERD
      and the cost per correct diagnosis with omeprazole was pound47 (95% CI: pound40- 
      pound59) compared to pound480 (95% CI: pound396- pound608) with endoscopy. There 
      was a complete absence of acid-related symptoms in the majority (59%) of patients
      after 3 days of omeprazole 40 mg therapy and, after 2 weeks, 82% of patients had 
      experienced an improvement in overall symptoms ( 1 grade). CONCLUSIONS: We
      conclude that omeprazole can be used as a clinically effective tool in the
      initial management of GERD and that it is of diagnostic value in patients who
      present with typical symptoms, such as heartburn, when the diagnosis is based on 
      symptom assessment alone.

TI  - Double-blind comparison [correction of Double-blind, placebo-controlled
      comparison] of rabeprazole 20 mg vs. omeprazole 20 mg in the treatment of erosive
      or ulcerative gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. The European Rabeprazole Study
      Group.
PG  - 49-57
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rabeprazole sodium is the most recent member of a class of
      substituted benzimidazole molecules known as proton pump inhibitors. Other proton
      pump inhibitors have been shown to be effective in healing oesophagitis. METHODS:
      In this randomised, double-blind, multicentre study, conducted at 27 European
      sites, the efficacy and safety of rabeprazole and omeprazole were compared in
      patients with erosive or ulcerative gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD).100 
      patients received rabeprazole 20 mg, and 102 patients omeprazole 20 mg once daily
      for 4 or 8 weeks, with healing monitored by endoscopy. RESULTS: Overall GERD
      healing rates observed and evaluated at weeks 4 and 8 were equivalent. Four-week 
      healing rates for rabeprazole and omeprazole were 81%-81% and 92%-94% for 8-week 
      healing. Rabeprazole-treated patients had similar relief of the frequency and
      intensity of heartburn to those treated with omeprazole. Both drugs were well
      tolerated over the 8-week treatment period. Mean changes in fasting serum gastrin
      were comparable. No significant differences in laboratory parameters were seen.
      Biopsies for argyrophil ECL cell histology at the end-point revealed a similar
      distributions of hyperplasia grades to those at baseline in both groups. Biopsies
      of body and antral mucosa for other parameters were similar between treatments
      for Helicobacter pylori colonization, presence or degree of inflammation, atrophy
      or intestinal metaplasia at the end-point. CONCLUSION: In this study, GERD
      healing rates following rabeprazole 20 mg once daily were equivalent to those
      obtained with omeprazole 20 mg once daily. Both treatments resulted in a
      comparable relief of the frequency and intensity of heartburn associated with
      this disease, and both were well tolerated.

TI  - Evaluation of a new ultrashort triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori disease.
PG  - 1269-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: 1-week proton pump inhibitor-based triple therapies are considered
      the most effective and convenient drug combinations for curing Helicobacter
      pylori infection. Short therapies, lasting less than 1 week have been
      investigated rarely. AIM: To assess the efficacy and tolerability of a 3-day
      lansoprazole triple therapy after 1 day of lansoprazole pre-treatment. METHODS:
      Seventy H. pylori-positive (rapid urease test and histology) patients received
      LAzT3 regimen (lanzoprazole 30 mg b.d. and azithromycin 500 mg o.m. for 3 days;
      tinidazole 2000 mg o.m. on day 1 and 1000 mg o.m. on days 2-3) after 1 day of
      lansoprazole pretreatment. Patients with active ulcer received lansoprazole 30 mg
      o.m. for an additional 4 weeks. Follow-up gastroscopy was carried out 4-6 weeks
      after completion of therapy. Eradication was defined as negative histology and
      rapid urease test. RESULTS: Four patients failed to attend the follow-up
      endoscopy. One patient complained of minor side-effects. H. pylori was eradicated
      in 57 of 66 patients suitable for evaluation, with a per-protocol cure rate of
      86.3% (95%CI: 76-94%), and an intention-to-treat cure rate of 81.4% (95%CI:
      70-90%). CONCLUSIONS: This new ultrashort triple therapy including lansoprazole, 
      azithromycin and tinidazole seems to be effective in eradicating H. pylori. It is
      safe and well-tolerated, and may be taken into consideration as a valid
      alternative to the better known and widely used 1-week proton pump
      inhibitor-based triple therapies.

TI  - Comparison of 24-h control of gastric acidity by three different dosages of
      pantoprazole in patients with duodenal ulcer.
PG  - 1241-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is now clear that the extent to which gastric acid secretion must 
      be suppressed varies with the clinical condition being treated. AIM: To assess
      the 24-h control of gastric acidity and the individual response variability of
      three different doses of pantoprazole. METHODS: Sixty-four duodenal ulcer
      patients were recruited for this prospective, randomized, multicentre,
      double-blind, parallel-group study. They were subdivided into three well-matched 
      groups treated with 20 mg o.m., 40 mg o.m. and 40 mg b.d. of pantoprazole,
      respectively. Endoscopy and intragastric pH monitoring were performed in each
      patient before and after 14 days of treatment. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients were 
      eligible for final analysis (17 treated with 20 mg o.m., 18 with 40 mg o.m. and
      20 with 40 mg b.d. pantoprazole). The ulcer crater healed in 94, 88 and 95% of
      cases, respectively. The three dosages of pantoprazole produced significant
      increases in gastric pH compared to basal levels (P < 0.0001). There was also a
      clear dose-dependent pharmacodynamic effect, which augmented on moving from the
      lowest dosage of 20 mg o.m. pantoprazole to the highest dosage of 40 mg b.d. (P <
      0.01-0.001). The inter-individual response variability within the three treatment
      groups was more marked with the dose of 20 mg than with the two higher doses of
      pantoprazole. CONCLUSIONS: All three doses of pantoprazole we tested are highly
      effective in decreasing gastric acidity and there is a clear dose-dependent
      pharmacodynamic effect on moving from the lowest to the highest dosage. The
      greatest inter individual variation in the degree of acid inhibition was seen
      with pantoprazole 20 mg o.m., while the majority of patients responded adequately
      to the two higher doses of the drug.

TI  - Nocturnal gastric acidity and acid breakthrough on different regimens of
      omeprazole 40 mg daily.
PG  - 1235-40
AB  - BACKGROUND: On chronic intake of omeprazole, most healthy volunteers and patients
      still have nocturnal acid breakthrough (NAB), defined as night-time periods with 
      gastric pH < 4.0 lasting for longer than 1 h. Gastro-oesophageal reflux during
      NAB may be particularly injurious to the oesophageal mucosa, contributing to the 
      chronic lesions complicating the condition. AIM: To compare the effect of three
      different dosing regimens of omeprazole 40 mg daily with regard to suppressing
      nocturnal gastric acidity and avoiding NAB. METHODS: Eighteen healthy volunteers 
      were given three different regimens of omeprazole for 7 days each in randomized
      order: 40 mg before breakfast (qAM), 40 mg before dinner (qPM) and 20 mg before
      breakfast and dinner (b.d.). On day 7, 24-h intragastric and intraoesophageal
      pH-metry was performed. Tracings were analysed for the period from 22.00 h until 
      06.00 h with regard to the percentage of time at which gastric pH was below 4.0, 
      3.0 and 2.0, and also the occurrence and duration of NAB. RESULTS: Nocturnal acid
      breakthrough was significantly more common on qAM than on qPM and b.d. (P < 0.05)
      dosing. The percentage of time gastric pH was less than 4.0 overnight was
      significantly lower on qPM (median 31.3) and b.d. (median 20.5) than on qAM
      (median 66.3) dosing (P=0.01 and P < 0.02, respectively). A pH threshold of 3 and
      4 showed the same differences, as did median 24-h gastric pH. Daytime acidity was
      not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: In healthy volunteers, dinner time or
      split dosing of omeprazole 40 mg daily is significantly more effective than
      dosing before breakfast in preventing NAB and controlling gastric acidity. These 
      regimens should be preferred in patients in whom suppression of nocturnal gastric
      acidity is desirable.

TI  - Gastro-oesophageal reflux associated with nocturnal gastric acid breakthrough on 
      proton pump inhibitors.
PG  - 1231-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nocturnal gastric acid breakthrough, defined as intragastric pH < 4
      for more than 1 h in the overnight period, is observed in up to 70% of normal
      subjects on proton pump inhibitors taken twice daily. The frequency of this
      breakthrough in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux and accompanying
      oesophageal reflux during this period has not been studied. AIM: To examine the
      frequency of nocturnal break-through and accompanying oesophageal acid exposure
      in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux treated with proton pump inhibitors
      twice daily. METHODS: Prolonged ambulatory pH records from 76 patients on twice
      daily proton pump inhibitors between January 1991 and July 1997 were analysed for
      the presence of nocturnal gastric acid breakthrough and accompanying oesophageal 
      pH < 4. Studies from 31 normal subjects on twice daily proton pump inhibitors
      constituted the control group. RESULTS: Nocturnal gastric acid breakthrough was
      seen in 70% of 61 patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux, 80% of 15 patients
      with Barrett's oesophagus and 67% of normal controls (P=N.S.). Oesophageal acid
      exposure was seen in 33% of gastro-oesophageal reflux patients, 50% of Barrett's 
      oesophagus patients and 8% of normal controls (P < 0.03). No difference was found
      between patients taking omeprazole or lansoprazole. CONCLUSION: Nocturnal acid
      breakthrough is frequently seen on proton pump inhibitors twice daily and is
      often accompanied by oesophageal reflux. This has important implications for
      medical therapy in patients with severe gastro-oesophageal reflux and Barrett's
      oesophagus.

TI  - Does eradication of Helicobacter pylori impair healing of nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drug associated bleeding peptic ulcers? A prospective
      randomized study.
PG  - 1201-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the widely accepted view that Helicobacter pylori is the most
      important cause of peptic ulcer disease, recent studies have suggested that the
      microbe protects against nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-associated
      gastroduodenal lesions and promotes ulcer healing. We investigated the effects of
      H. pylori eradication on the healing of NSAID-associated bleeding peptic ulcers. 
      METHODS: Chronic NSAID users presenting with peptic ulcer haemorrhage underwent
      endoscopy to secure haemostasis and to document H. pylori infection by rapid
      urease test and culture. They were prospectively randomized to receive either
      omeprazole (20 mg once daily) for 8 weeks or a 1-week course of triple therapy
      (bismuth subcitrate 120 mg, tetracycline 500 mg, metronidazole 400 mg, all given 
      four times daily) plus omeprazole (20 mg once daily) for 8 weeks. Endoscopy was
      repeated after 8 weeks. Final H. pylori status was determined by a 13C-urea
      breath test that was performed at least 4 weeks after discontinuation of
      omeprazole. RESULTS: 195 H. pylori-infected NSAID users, complicated by bleeding 
      ulcers, were randomized to receive omeprazole alone (102) or triple therapy plus 
      omeprazole (93). 174 patients returned for second endoscopy at 8 weeks (91 in the
      omeprazole group, 83 in the triple therapy group). Urea breath test was negative 
      in 14% in the omeprazole group vs. 92% in the triple therapy group (P < 0.001).
      Complete ulcer healing was achieved in 88 (97%) patients in the omeprazole group 
      and 77 (93%) in the triple therapy group (P=0. 31). On intention-to-treat
      analysis, ulcers were healed in 86% of the omeprazole group and 83% of the triple
      therapy group (P=0.50). There was no significant difference in the healing rates 
      of gastric or duodenal ulcers between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Eradication of 
      H. pylori did not impair the healing of NSAID-associated bleeding peptic ulcers.

TI  - One-week low-dose triple therapy is effective in treating Helicobacter
      pylori-infected patients with bleeding peptic ulcers.
PG  - 733-7
AB  - Proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-based triple therapy, which combines a PPI and two
      antibiotics, is highly effective in eradicating Helicobacter pylori infection in 
      peptic ulcer patients, even if given for only 1 week. However, the application of
      this regimen in patients with bleeding ulcers has not been adequately
      investigated. We studied the effectiveness of triple therapy in treating 122
      patients with proven H. pylori infection, and bleeding stigmata on endoscopy; 97 
      had duodenal ulcer (DU), 15 had gastric ulcer (GU), and 10 had both types of
      ulcers. A regimen of omeprazole (20 mg), metronidazole (500 mg), and
      clarithromycin (250 mg) twice daily was administered for 1 week as soon as the
      patient could eat normally after bleeding, followed by omeprazole (20 mg) daily
      for 3 additional weeks. Follow-up endoscopy and 13C-urea breath tests (UBTs) were
      performed at least 4 weeks after triple therapy. A total of 104 patients
      completed the study, 83 with DU, 12 with GU, and nine with both. The overall
      ulcer healing rate was 97.1% and the eradication rate was 91.3%. Patients with
      and without H. pylori eradication did not differ significantly in terms of age,
      gender, UBT titer, units of blood transfused, or interval between endoscopy and
      the beginning of triple therapy. We conclude that 1-week low-dose PPI-based
      triple therapy is effective in eradicating H. pylori infection in patients with
      bleeding peptic ulcers. When followed by 3 weeks of additional PPI treatment, a
      satisfactory ulcer healing rate can also be achieved.

TI  - Transabdominal bowel sonography for the detection of intestinal complications in 
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 112-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The course of Crohn's disease is characterised by the occurrence of
      intestinal complications such as strictures, intra-abdominal fistulas, or
      abscesses. Standard diagnostic procedures may fail to show these complications,
      in particular fistulas. AIMS: To test the value of transabdominal bowel
      sonography (T) for the detection of intestinal complications in Crohn's disease. 
      METHODS: T was prospectively performed in 213 patients with Crohn's disease in a 
      university based inflammatory bowel disease referral centre. Thirty three
      underwent resective bowel surgery and were included in this study. The accuracy
      of T to detect strictures, intra-abdominal fistulas, or abscesses was compared
      with surgical and pathological findings. RESULTS: T was able to identify
      strictures in 22/22 patients and to exclude it in 10/11 patients (100%
      sensitivity, 91% specificity). Fistulas were correctly identified in 20/23
      patients and excluded in 9/10 patients (87% sensitivity, 90% specificity).
      Intra-abdominal abscesses were correctly detected in 9/9 patients and excluded in
      22/24 patients (100% sensitivity, 92% specificity). CONCLUSIONS: In experienced
      hands T is an accurate method for the detection of intestinal complications in
      Crohn's disease. T is thus recommended as a primary investigative method for
      evaluation of severe Crohn's disease.

TI  - Lack of effect of treating Helicobacter pylori infection in patients with
      nonulcer dyspepsia. Omeprazole plus Clarithromycin and Amoxicillin Effect One
      Year after Treatment (OCAY) Study Group.
PG  - 1875-81
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is uncertain whether treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection
      relieves symptoms in patients with nonulcer, or functional, dyspepsia. METHODS:
      We conducted a double-blind, multicenter trial of patients with H. pylori
      infection and dyspeptic symptoms (moderate-to-very-severe pain and discomfort
      centered in the upper abdomen). Patients were excluded if they had a history of
      peptic ulcer disease or gastroesophageal reflux disease and had abnormal findings
      on upper endoscopy. Patients were randomly assigned to seven days of treatment
      with 20 mg of omeprazole twice daily, 1000 mg of amoxicillin twice daily, and 500
      mg of clarithromycin twice daily or with omeprazole alone and then followed up
      for one year. Treatment success was defined as the absence of dyspeptic symptoms 
      or the presence of minimal symptoms on any of the 7 days preceding the 12-month
      visit. RESULTS: Twenty of the 348 patients were excluded after randomization
      because they were not infected with H. pylori, were not treated, or had no data
      available. For the remaining 328 patients (164 in each group), treatment was
      successful for 27.4 percent of those assigned to receive omeprazole and
      antibiotics and 20.7 percent of those assigned to receive omeprazole alone
      (P=0.17; absolute difference between groups, 6.7 percent; 95 percent confidence
      interval, -2.6 to 16.0). After 12 months, gastritis had healed in 75.0 percent of
      the patients in the group given omeprazole and antibiotics and in 3.0 percent of 
      the patients in the omeprazole group (P<0.001); the respective rates of H. pylori
      eradication were 79 percent and 2 percent. In the group given omeprazole and
      antibiotics, the rate of treatment success among patients with persistent H.
      pylori infection was similar to that among patients in whom the infection was
      eradicated (26 percent vs. 31 percent). There were no significant differences
      between the groups in the quality of life after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In
      patients with nonulcer dyspepsia, the eradication of H. pylori infection is not
      likely to relieve symptoms.

TI  - An office approach to the diagnosis of chronic cough.
PG  - 2015-22
AB  - Chronic cough is a common problem in patients who visit family physicians. The
      three most common causes of chronic cough in those who are referred to pulmonary 
      specialists are postnasal drip, asthma and gastroesophageal reflux. The initial
      treatment of patients with cough is often empiric and may involve a trial of
      decongestants, bronchodilators or histamine H2 antagonists, as monotherapy or in 
      combination. If a therapeutic trial is not successful, sequential diagnostic
      testing including chest radiograph, purified protein derivative test for
      tuberculosis, computed tomography of the sinuses, methacholine challenge test or 
      barium swallow may be indicated. By using a standard protocol for diagnosis and
      treatment, 90 percent of patients with chronic cough can be managed successfully 
      in the family physician's office. However, in some cases it may take three to
      five months to determine a diagnosis and effective treatment. For the minority of
      patients in whom this diagnostic approach is unsuccessful, consultation with a
      pulmonary specialist is appropriate.

TI  - The utility of endoscopy in the management of patients with gastroesophageal
      reflux symptoms.
PG  - 2508-12
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The utility of endoscopy in the management of patients with symptoms
      of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is unclear. The purpose of this
      prospective study was to assess the impact of endoscopy on the subsequent
      management of patients with uncomplicated reflux symptoms. METHODS: A total of
      742 patients underwent endoscopy for symptoms of GERD. Endoscopists recorded the 
      therapy before endoscopy, the findings of endoscopy, and the treatment
      recommendations after endoscopy. RESULTS: There was no difference in
      pre-endoscopy therapy or grade of esophagitis in subjects undergoing endoscopy
      for failed therapy versus GERD symptoms alone. After endoscopy, the most common
      strategy for patients taking omeprazole was to maintain or increase the dose. For
      those taking an H2 blocker before endoscopy, the most common outcome was to
      switch the patient to omeprazole, independent of the grade of esophagitis.
      CONCLUSIONS: Most patients undergoing endoscopy for symptoms of GERD were
      switched to omeprazole regardless of the endoscopic findings. No esophageal
      cancer was identified and the incidence of Barrett's esophagus was low. It
      appears that endoscopy itself did not change the management of patients receiving
      H2-blocker therapy. A trial of a proton pump inhibitor before endoscopy should be
      considered.

TI  - Can the C-14 urea breath test replace follow-up endoscopic biopsies in patients
      treated for Helicobacter pylori infection?
PG  - 815-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The C-14 urea breath test (UBT) is the most specific noninvasive test
      to detect Helicobacter pylori, with reported sensitivity and specificity rates of
      90% and 95%, respectively. This test has not been evaluated for eradication after
      a therapeutic trial. The goal of this study was to assess the accuracy of C-14
      UBT in the diagnosis and eradication of H. pylori infection in patients with
      duodenal ulcer who were treated with a triple drug regimen. METHODS: Sixty
      patients with active duodenal ulcers who tested positive for the rapid urease
      test had a C-14 UBT at 0 weeks (at enrollment) and at 6 and 12 weeks using 5
      microCi (185 KBq) of C-14 urea. A single breath sample was collected at 15
      minutes for UBT. H. pylori was eradicated using lansoprazole and two antibiotics.
      RESULTS: Receiver operator characteristic curves showed that, using a value of
      400 counts per minute (cpm), UBT had a sensitivity rate of 91%, specificity rate 
      of 93%, positive predictive value of 77%, and a negative predictive value of 97% 
      in the prediction of H. pylori eradication. The mean + 3 SD of H. pylori-negative
      patients was 380.1 cpm; at this cutoff value, the sensitivity and specificity
      rates were 91.3% and 92.8%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The C-14 UBT was an
      accurate, rapid, and easily administered test to diagnose initial H. pylori
      infection and to monitor its eradication, thereby obviating the need for repeated
      endoscopic biopsies.

TI  - Optimization of acid suppression for patients with peptic ulcer bleeding: an
      intragastric pH-metry study with omeprazole.
PG  - 601-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study whether an intravenous infusion dose of omeprazole (80 mg + 8
      mg/h) during 24 h can be subsequently reduced with maintained effect. Second, to 
      study the effect of oral omeprazole 20 mg given once or twice daily up to day 10,
      after cessation of a 3-day intravenous infusion (80 mg + 8 mg/h). DESIGN:
      Prospective, randomized, partly blinded study. METHODS: Twelve Helicobacter
      pylori(+) patients and 12 H. pylori(-) subjects were included. In part I the
      patients received omeprazole, 80 mg + 8 mg/h, during 24 h followed by 8, 4 or 2
      mg/h. In part II the subjects received 80 mg + 8 mg/h during 3 days followed by
      20 mg omeprazole orally, once or twice daily until day 10. Intragastric pH was
      measured. RESULTS: All H. pylori(+) patients showed a rapid increase of
      intragastric pH with a mean intragastric pH of 6.7 during the second half of the 
      first day. After the subsequent dose reduction, the mean pH decreased to 6.1-6.2.
      Patients continuing on 8 mg/h showed the best results. Likewise, all H. pylori(-)
      subjects showed a rapid and sustained reduction of intragastric acidity during
      the infusion. Subsequent dose reduction to 20 mg once daily led to a stable
      fraction of time with pH > 3 of 72%. CONCLUSIONS: Omeprazole given as a
      continuous infusion of 80 mg + 8 mg/h for 72 h followed by omeprazole 20 mg once 
      daily raised the intragastric pH to and above levels alleged to allow haemostasis
      in patients with peptic ulcer bleeding and subsequent healing of the ulcer.

TI  - Eradication of Helicobacter pylori by a 1-week course of famotidine, amoxicillin 
      and clarithromycin.
PG  - 579-82
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The combination of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) such as omeprazole
      with amoxicillin and clarithromycin constitutes one of the most effective
      treatments for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori. Nevertheless, the
      mechanisms of interaction between these drugs remain unclear. It has been shown
      that minimal inhibitory concentration values of both antibiotics are considerably
      lower at neutral pH levels than in an acid environment. Further, omeprazole
      possesses bacteriostatic activity. To evaluate the significance of these
      mechanisms we replaced omeprazole with famotidine, a drug which only suppresses
      acid production, but has no intrinsic antimicrobial activity. METHODS: We
      evaluated the efficacy of a 1-week course of famotidine 80 mg b.i.d., amoxicillin
      1000 mg b.i.d. and clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d. in a pilot study (20 patients),
      and then confirmed our results in a larger replication study (87 patients). A
      total of 107 patients with H. pylori-associated duodenal ulcer (n = 54), gastric 
      ulcer (n = 14) or non-ulcer dyspepsia (n = 39) were included. Endoscopy was
      performed at baseline and 4-6 weeks after discontinuation of treatment. H. pylori
      status was assessed by the urease test and histology. RESULTS: H. pylori was
      successfully eradicated in 94 of 104 patients who completed the study (90.4%; CI 
      95%, 83.0-95.3%). By intention-to-treat analysis, the eradication rate was 87.9% 
      (CI 95%, 80.1-93.4%). Ulcer healing was observed in 98.1% of duodenal ulcers and 
      92.9% of gastric ulcers (based on per-protocol analysis). Mild side effects that 
      did not require termination of treatment were reported by seven patients (6.7%). 
      CONCLUSION: A 1-week course of famotidine, amoxicillin and clarithromycin is a
      highly effective, simple and safe eradication regimen. Our data indicate that
      acid suppression is the crucial mechanism by which the activity of amoxicillin
      and clarithromycin against H. pylori is enhanced, whereas additional
      antimicrobial activity or other specific effects of PPIs seem to be less
      important.

TI  - Effects of trimebutine maleate on gastric motility in patients with gastric
      ulcer.
PG  - 823-7
AB  - The effects of trimebutine maleate (TM), a prokinetic drug, on gastrointestinal
      motility in patients with gastric ulcer were investigated. Twenty patients with
      active gastric ulcers were allocated to two groups; 10 patients received a proton
      pump inhibitor alone (PPI group), given orally, and 10 patients received oral TM 
      in combination with a PPI (PPI + TM group), each for a period of 8 weeks.
      Electrogastrography (EGG) and gastric emptying were measured before and after the
      treatment period. During the active ulcer stage, tachygastria (more than 0.06 Hz)
      or bradygastria (less than 0.04 Hz) in the EGG frequency were observed in 9
      patients either before or after meals. During the healed ulcer stage,
      tachygastria or bradygastria was observed in 4 of 10 patients in the PPI group,
      while in the PPI + TM group, 1 patient had tachygastria and none had
      bradygastria. Postprandial dip (PD) was observed in 3 of the 20 patients during
      the active stage, while after treatment, PD was observed in 3 patients in the PPI
      group and in 6 patients in the PPI + TM group, respectively. Gastric emptying in 
      the PPI group did not show any change between before and after treatment, while
      that in the PPI + TM group improved significantly after treatment. These results 
      suggest that TM may have an ameliorative effect on abnormal gastric motility in
      patients with gastric ulcer.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori infection in children.
PG  - 1105-12
AB  - Helicobacter pylori colonizes the human stomach, especially during childhood.
      However, a variety of H. pylori strains exists, with major differences in
      virulence characteristics which probably account for different clinical symptoms,
      and the majority of infected subjects remains asymptomatic. Helicobacter pylori
      infection is correlated with socioeconomic conditions and hygienic circumstances,
      resulting in an extremely high prevalence in children in developing countries.
      Commercial screening tests are not capable of separating the more virulent
      strains (type I with vacuolating toxin VacA and CagA protein) from the less
      virulent strains (type II, VacA and CagA negative). Type I strains, but not type 
      II, are associated with an increased risk for duodenal ulcer and gastric cancer. 
      Therefore, future screening tests and vaccinations should focus on the type I
      strains.

TI  - A placebo-controlled trial to assess the effects of 8 days of dosing with
      rabeprazole versus omeprazole on 24-h intragastric acidity and plasma gastrin
      concentrations in young healthy male subjects.
PG  - 1079-89
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rabeprazole (LY307640, E3810) is a new, potent, proton pump
      inhibitor. A single daily 20 mg dose significantly decreases 24-h intragastric
      acidity. There are no data currently available directly comparing the effect of
      rabeprazole on 24-h acidity with established proton pump inhibitors. AIM: To
      compare the effects of rabeprazole 20 mg o.m. and omeprazole 20 mg o.m. on 24-h
      intragastric acidity and plasma gastrin concentration in a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, in healthy H. pylori-negative subjects.
      METHODS: Twenty-four healthy male volunteers, negative for H. pylori infection by
      serology and 13C-urea breath test, were studied on the 1st and 8th day of dosing 
      with either placebo, rabeprazole 20 mg or omeprazole 20 mg, once each morning, in
      a crossover fashion. On days 1 and 8, hourly intragastric acidity was measured by
      gastric aspiration for 24 h from 08.00 hours. On day 8, plasma gastrin
      concentrations were also measured hourly from 08.00 to 24.00 hours, then every 2 
      h thereafter. RESULTS: A single dose of both rabeprazole and omeprazole
      significantly decreased 24-h intragastric acidity compared with placebo. The 24-h
      acidity on day 1 was significantly decreased for rabeprazole compared with
      omeprazole (331 vs. 640 mmol.h/L, P < 0.001), resulting in a significantly higher
      median 24-h intragastric pH and longer times at which intragastric pH was > 3 and
      > 4. On day 8 of dosing, the decrease in 24-h intragastric acidity was greater
      with rabeprazole than with omeprazole, but the difference was not statistically
      significant (160 vs. 218 mmol.h/L, P = 0.1). However, 24-h plasma gastrin
      concentration (1687 vs. 1085 pmol.h/L. P < 0.01) and percentage time that
      intragastric pH was > 3 (69 vs. 59%, P = 0.008) and > 4 (60 vs. 51%, P = 0.03)
      were significantly greater. CONCLUSIONS: Rabeprazole 20 mg once daily has a
      significantly faster onset of antisecretory activity than omeprazole 20 mg once
      daily. After 8 days the differences in intragastric pH > 3 and > 4 holding times 
      persisted, but there was no significant difference in 24-h acidity.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of one-week triple therapy for eradicating Helicobacter
      pylori in children.
PG  - 278-82
AB  - BACKGROUND: Proton pump inhibitor-based eradication therapy of Helicobacter
      pylori has been widely studied in adults, but there have been only a few reports 
      about this therapy in children. The purpose of this study was to investigate the 
      safety and efficacy of 1-week triple therapy for eradication of H. pylori and
      ulcer healing in children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We prospectively studied 15
      patients aged 2-17 years (5 with gastric ulcers, 8 with duodenal ulcers, and 2
      with nodular gastritis alone). Three patients had H2 blocker-resistant duodenal
      ulcers. Patients received 0.75 mg/kg of lansoprazole b.i.d., 25 mg/kg of
      amoxicillin b.i.d., and 10 mg/kg of clarithromycin b.i.d. for 7 days. No
      additional therapy (including antisecretory drugs) was administered to any
      patients following eradication therapy. Patients underwent endoscopy to obtain
      antral biopsies (culture, urease test and histology) and to evaluate the mucosal 
      status, and underwent a 13C-urea breath test before and 4-8 weeks after the
      completion of a 1-week course of therapy. RESULTS: All patients received the full
      drug regimen. Endoscopy showed complete healing of ulcers in 12 of 13 patients
      with peptic ulcer disease (92%). H. pylori was eradicated in 13 of 15 patients
      (87%). Diarrhea and/or an altered taste sensation occurred in 5 patients (33%).
      There were no hematological or biochemical abnormalities related to therapy.
      CONCLUSION: The 1-week triple therapy was safe and effective for eradicating H.
      pylori. The present study showed that ulcer healing in juveniles is closely
      associated with eradication of H. pylori, and that no additional therapy is
      required when H. pylori is eradicated. A shorter course of eradication therapy
      than 2 weeks may be suitable for children with H. pylori infection.

      Scandinavian countries. DESIGN: Partly randomised controlled study, and partly
      open study. SETTING: Hospitals throughout Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland.
      SUBJECTS: 310 patients with chronic reflux disease and oesophagitis who were
      initially entered into a randomised controlled study of omeprazole and antireflux
      surgery. INTERVENTIONS: Total fundic wrap, partial fundoplication, or omeprazole.
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Control of symptoms at one year. RESULTS: 154 patients who
      had their symptoms of reflux completely controlled with omeprazole were initially
      randomised to have an open operation but 10 refused, leaving 144 for analysis. 34
      patients who had only a partial response were also offered operation; 120/178
      (68%) had a total fundic wrap, and 53 (30%) partial fundoplication. 6 patients
      had postoperative complications that required reoperation and 123 made a
      completely uneventful recovery. Reflux was controlled in most patients, and only 
      10 (6%) required further treatment with omeprazole. The outcome in those patients
      who only responded partially to omeprazole was similar to that in patients who
      had a complete response. CONCLUSION: The outcome of antireflux surgery throughout
      Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland is good.

TI  - Disappearance of hyperplastic polyps in the stomach after eradication of
      Helicobacter pylori. A randomized, clinical trial.
PG  - 712-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori infection is common in patients with hyperplastic
      gastric polyps. OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of eradication of H. pylori on the
      clinical course of patients with hyperplastic gastric polyps. DESIGN:
      Single-blind, randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: University-based
      gastroenterology outpatient clinic. PATIENTS: 35 patients with H. pylori
      infection and hyperplastic gastric polyps at least 3 mm in diameter.
      INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned to a treatment group (n = 17),
      which received a proton-pump inhibitor (omeprazole or lansoprazole), amoxicillin,
      and either clarithromycin or ecabet sodium, or to a control group (n = 18), which
      received no treatment. MEASUREMENTS: Patients underwent endoscopy before
      enrollment and 12 to 15 months after the end of treatment. Serum gastrin levels
      and titers of IgG to H. pylori were measured. RESULTS: In the treatment group,
      the polyps had disappeared by 3 to 15 months (average, 7.1 +/- 1.2 months) after 
      the end of treatment in 12 of all 17 patients (71%) and in 12 of the 15 patients 
      (80%) in whom H. pylori was eradicated. However, 12 to 15 months after the start 
      of the study, no change in polyps or H. pylori status was seen in any controls (P
      < 0.001). Histologic findings of inflammation and activity, serum gastrin levels,
      and titers of IgG to H. pylori showed significant regression in the treatment
      group compared with the control group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Most hyperplastic 
      polyps disappeared after eradication of H. pylori. Thus, eradication should be
      attempted before endoscopic removal is done in patients with hyperplastic gastric
      polyps and H. pylori infection.

TI  - Ranitidine controls nocturnal gastric acid breakthrough on omeprazole: a
      controlled study in normal subjects.
PG  - 1335-9
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Proton pump inhibitors administered twice daily do not provide
      complete nocturnal acid suppression. Acid breakthrough, or decrease in
      intragastric pH to <4 for an hour or longer, occurs in three quarters of normal
      subjects and patients at night. We compared the effect of a third dose of
      omeprazole at bedtime with that of a dose of ranitidine at bedtime on residual
      nocturnal acid secretion in patients receiving omeprazole twice daily. METHODS:
      Twelve volunteers underwent overnight intragastric pH monitoring after 7 days of 
      treatment with omeprazole, 20 mg twice daily, followed by different treatment
      supplements at bedtime: placebo; additional omeprazole, 20 mg; ranitidine, 150
      mg; and ranitidine, 300 mg. RESULTS: Additional omeprazole at bedtime reduced the
      percentage of time with intragastric pH of <4 from 48% to 31% (P < 0.005)
      compared with omeprazole twice daily with placebo at bedtime. Ranitidine at
      bedtime reduced this parameter more, 5% with 150 mg and 6% with 300 mg (P <0.01
      vs. omeprazole twice daily plus bedtime). Results for percentage of time with
      intragastric pH <3 were similar. Eleven subjects had acid breakthrough with
      placebo at bedtime; 7 with omeprazole at bedtime (P = NS); 4 with ranitidine, 150
      mg at bedtime; and 3 with ranitidine, 300 mg at bedtime (P < 0. 05, ranitidine
      vs. placebo). CONCLUSIONS: Bedtime ranitidine is more effective than bedtime
      omeprazole on residual nocturnal acid secretion in patients receiving omeprazole 
      twice daily. This finding suggests that fasting breakthrough nocturnal acid
      secretion in patients receiving omeprazole twice daily is most likely histamine
      related.

TI  - Continuous and more effective duodenal ulcer healing under therapy with bismuth
      and two antibiotics than with dual therapy comprising omeprazole and amoxicillin.
PG  - 847-50
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the speed of the healing process of duodenal ulcers
      during eradication regimens with and without a high-dose anti-secretory drug.
      SETTING: An outpatient department of a university hospital as a community-based
      and referral centre. MATERIALS: A total of 101 patients with proven duodenal
      ulcer and a positive urease test were randomized into two groups: one group
      received the classic triple therapy (bismuth subnitrate 3 x 375 mg for 4 weeks + 
      tetracycline 3 x 500 mg + metronidazole 3 x 250 mg daily, both for 2 weeks ), the
      other group received dual therapy comprising amoxicillin 2 x 1000 mg + omeprazole
      2 x 20 mg daily, both for 2 weeks. All patients underwent a control endoscopy 2
      and 6 weeks after the beginning of treatment. Eradication was assumed if a urease
      test and culture were negative in all specimens taken from antral and corpus
      mucosa. RESULTS: In total, 93 patients completed all 6 weeks of the study (45
      patients in the triple therapy group and 48 patients in the dual therapy group). 
      The disappearance of ulcer pain was faster in the group under the regimen
      including omeprazole (dual therapy) than in the group with triple therapy
      (2.4+/-2.7 days versus 4.5+/-3.5 days; P< 0.01). The two-week healing rate was
      significantly higher in the patients treated with dual therapy than in the group 
      treated with triple therapy (77% versus 33.3%; P< 0.01); however, 12 out of 37
      patients with a healed ulcer in the dual therapy group had an ulcer relapse at 6 
      weeks (six became symptomatic). Only in one of these 12 patients was Helicobacter
      pylori eradicated. Fifteen of the 45 patients with triple therapy had healed
      ulcers at 2 weeks, and of these 14 remained healed at 6 weeks (H. pylori was
      eradicated in eight patients). The six-week healing rate with dual therapy was
      the same as with classic triple therapy (64.6% versus 77.6%); the eradication
      rate was lower in the former group than in the latter (30.4% versus 51.1%
      respectively; P=0.056). CONCLUSION: A high dose of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) 
      combined with amoxicillin results in rapid ulcer healing and pain disappearance, 
      but is associated with early ulcer relapse due to lack of eradication of H.
      pylori. Its addition to regimens with bismuth and antibiotics is not necessary to
      achieve ulcer healing.

TI  - Speed of onset of oesophageal acid reduction with different proton-pump
      inhibitors in patients with reflux oesophagitis.
PG  - 753-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Proton-pump inhibitors are the most effective drug treatment for
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. With the increasing trend toward 'on demand'
      therapy, it is important to determine how quickly oesophageal acid reflux is
      reduced, and whether this differs between the available compounds. DESIGN: A 2 x 
      2 double-blind crossover study. METHOD: Eight patients with Savary-Miller grade
      II oesophagitis underwent 24 h pre-treatment oesophageal pH monitoring. Each
      patient was randomly allocated to receive daily omeprazole 20 mg and lansoprazole
      30 mg for 2 days, in two separate double-blind periods, with a washout period of 
      14 days. Two further oesophageal pH recordings were obtained during the second 48
      h period of treatment with each drug. RESULTS: Five patients completed the study 
      and their results are presented. Lansoprazole significantly reduced the
      percentage of total reflux time (P = 0.04) and percentage upright reflux time
      (P=0.04) on the second day of treatment compared to the pre-treatment, while this
      was not achieved with omeprazole. There was a significant difference in the
      reduction of the total reflux time (P= 0.011), upright reflux time (P=0.021) and 
      total reflux episodes (P < 0.001) on day 2 of treatment when comparing
      lansoprazole with omeprazole. All patients on lansoprazole had a decrease in
      symptoms of heartburn and regurgitation, with complete resolution in four
      patients. Three patients had a decrease in these symptoms with omeprazole,
      including complete resolution in two. CONCLUSION: This study was limited by the
      small number of patients who underwent this demanding investigation. However,
      lansoprazole appears to have a more rapid onset of reduction of acid
      gastro-oesophageal reflux than omeprazole over a 48 h period.

TI  - The usefulness of a structured questionnaire in the assessment of symptomatic
      gastroesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 1023-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) rests
      primarily on recognition of symptom patterns that are classical for reflux
      disease, but little attention has been paid to the use of a formal questionnaire 
      for identifying such symptom patterns. METHODS: A self-administered questionnaire
      was developed which has seven items that focus on the nature of the symptoms and 
      the precipitating, exacerbating, and relieving factors. The diagnostic validity
      of the questionnaire was tested against endoscopy and 24-h pH monitoring. A
      further evaluation was undertaken in patients with symptoms suggestive of GERD
      and in patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia, to identify factors that might predict 
      symptom relief during treatment with omeprazole. RESULTS: When endoscopic
      esophageal mucosal breaks and 24-h pH data were used as criteria for the
      diagnosis of GERD, the questionnaire had a sensitivity of 92% but a very low
      specificity of 19%. Symptom relief during treatment with omeprazole was predicted
      by the presence of heartburn, described as 'a burning feeling rising from the
      stomach or lower chest up towards the neck' (P = 0.004), and 'relief from
      antacids' (P = 0.02). In non-ulcer dyspepsia a positive response to omeprazole
      was confined to the subgroup of patients who identified their main discomfort as 
      heartburn as described above. CONCLUSION: The present questionnaire using
      descriptive language usefully identified heartburn in patients presenting with
      upper abdominal symptoms, and this symptom predicted symptom resolution during
      treatment with omeprazole.

TI  - Effect of omeprazole 20 mg twice daily on duodenogastric and gastro-oesophageal
      bile reflux in Barrett's oesophagus.
PG  - 603-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Both acid and duodenal contents are thought to be responsible for the
      mucosal damage in Barrett's oesophagus, a condition often treated medically.
      However, little is known about the effect of omeprazole on duodenogastric reflux 
      (DGR) and duodenogastro-oesophageal reflux (DGOR). AIMS: To study the effect of
      omeprazole 20 mg twice daily on DGR and DGOR, using the technique of ambulatory
      bilirubin monitoring. METHODS: Twenty three patients with Barrett's oesophagus
      underwent manometry followed by 24 hour oesophageal and gastric pH monitoring. In
      conjunction with pH monitoring, 11 patients (group 1) underwent oesophageal
      bilirubin monitoring and 12 patients (group 2) underwent gastric bilirubin
      monitoring, both before and during treatment with omeprazole 20 mg twice daily.
      RESULTS: In both groups there was a significant reduction in oesophageal acid
      (pH<4) reflux (p<0.005) and a significant increase in the time gastric pH was
      above 4 (p<0.005). In group 1, median total oesophageal bilirubin exposure was
      significantly reduced from 28.9% to 2.4% (p<0.005). In group 2, median total
      gastric bilirubin exposure was significantly reduced from 24.9% to 7.2%
      (p<0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of Barrett's oesophagus with omeprazole 20 mg
      twice daily results in a notable reduction in the exposure of the oesophagus to
      both acid and duodenal contents. In addition, delivery of duodenal contents to
      the upper gastric body is reduced.

TI  - Twice-daily, 10-day triple therapy with omeprazole, amoxicillin, and
      clarithromycin for Helicobacter pylori eradication in duodenal ulcer disease:
      results of three multicenter, double-blind, United States trials.
PG  - 2106-12
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We assessed the safety and efficacy of 10-day twice-daily triple
      therapy for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) in three double-blind, controlled
      trials in patients with duodenal ulcer disease. METHODS: H. pylori-infected
      patients with one or more duodenal ulcer(s) at endoscopy (studies 1, 2) or with a
      documented duodenal ulcer history and no duodenal ulcer or erosions at endoscopy 
      (study 3) were randomly assigned to 10-day courses of omeprazole 20 mg b.i.d.
      plus amoxicillin 1 g b.i.d. plus clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d. (OAC) or placebo
      plus amoxicillin 1 g b.i.d. plus clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d. (AC). In studies 1 
      and 2, patients received an additional 18 days of omeprazole 20 mg q.d. (OAC
      group) or placebo (AC group). Endoscopy was repeated 4 wk after therapy in
      studies 1 and 2 and 4-6 wk after therapy in study 3. At baseline, H. pylori was
      diagnosed by CLOtest plus histology, or by culture. Eradication was defined as no
      positive biopsy test and two or more negative tests. Patients were defined as
      compliant if they took 75% or more of each study drug and missed < or = 3
      consecutive days of the 10-day therapy. RESULTS: Intent-to-treat populations of
      the three studies combined were 241 patients for OAC and 266 for AC. Of all OAC
      patients combined, 2% stopped study medications due to adverse events, and 93%
      were compliant. Per-protocol cure rates were 78% to 90% (all studies combined,
      84%) for OAC vs 33% to 45% (combined, 39%) for AC (p < 0.001, OAC vs AC);
      intent-to-treat eradication rates were 69% to 83% (combined, 75%) for OAC vs 32% 
      to 37% (combined, 35%) for AC; (p < 0.001, OAC vs AC). CONCLUSION: Rigorously
      designed studies indicate that 10 days of twice-daily triple therapy with
      omeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin achieves per-protocol eradication
      rates of approximately 80% to 90% in the U.S.

TI  - Evaluation of the PyloriTek test for detection of Helicobacter pylori infection
      in cases with and without eradication therapy.
PG  - 2102-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The accuracy of the PyloriTek test (a 1-h rapid urease test) used
      after eradication therapy of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) has not been well
      clarified. This study was done to evaluate the accuracy of the PyloriTek test
      results for cases with and without eradication therapy, using culture and
      histology as gold standard methods, and to establish the suitable timing of the
      PyloriTek test after eradication treatment. METHODS: One hundred sixty-three
      patients undergoing upper endoscopy were randomly selected; 100 patients had not 
      received eradication therapy and 63 had. Three biopsy specimens each were
      obtained from the gastric antrum and the body for examination by PyloriTek,
      culture, and histology. The absence of H. pylori was established with negative
      results from both culture and histology. RESULTS: In cases without eradication
      therapy, PyloriTek, correctly identified 66 of 67 H. pylori-positive cases and 30
      of 33 H. pylori-negative cases, yielding 98.5% sensitivity and 90.9% specificity.
      In cases with eradication therapy, PyloriTek gave correct diagnoses in 10 of 17
      H. pylori-positive cases and in 45 of 46 H. pylori-negative cases, for 58.8%
      sensitivity and 97.8% specificity. However, when PyloriTek was used more than 4
      months after the end of eradication therapy, both the sensitivity and the
      specificity increased to 100%. CONCLUSION: Considering time and cost, the use of 
      PyloriTek alone may be satisfactory for detecting H. pylori infection in cases
      without eradication therapy. When patients are examined more than 4 months after 
      intervention, the use of PyloriTek alone may be sufficient for correctly
      diagnosing H. pylori infections.

TI  - Comparison of omeprazole, metronidazole and clarithromycin with
      omeprazole/amoxicillin dual-therapy for the cure of Helicobacter pylori
      infection.
PG  - 646-50
AB  - In this randomized, multicenter trial, we evaluated the effectiveness and side
      effect profile of a modified omeprazole-based triple therapy to cure Helicobacter
      pylori infection. The control group consisted of patients treated with standard
      dual therapy comprising omeprazole and amoxicillin. One hundred and fifty-seven
      H. pylori infected patients with duodenal ulcers were randomly assigned to
      receive either a combination of omeprazole 10 mg, clarithromycin 250 mg and
      metronidazole 400 mg (OCM) given three times daily for 10 days (n = 81), or a
      combination of omeprazole 20 mg and amoxicillin 1 g (OA) given twice daily for 14
      days (n = 76). Prior to treatment and after 2 and 6 weeks, gastric biopsies from 
      the antrum and corpus were obtained for histology and H. pylori culture. H.
      pylori infection was cured in 97.4% after OCM and in 65.8% after OA in the
      per-protocol analysis (p < 0.001) (intention-to-treat analysis: 93.4% and 63.2%, 
      respectively). H. pylori was successfully cultured in 122 patients (77%). The
      overall rate of metronidazole resistance was 19.7% (24/122), no primary
      resistance to clarithromycin or amoxicillin was found. In the OCM group, all
      patients infected with metronidazole-sensitive H. pylori strains (n = 51) and
      those infected with strains of unknown susceptibility to metronidazole (n = 14)
      were cured (100%), while 77% (10/13) of those harboring metronidazole-resistant
      strains were cured of the infection (p = 0.36). Side effects leading to premature
      termination of treatment occurred in 2.5% of the patients in the OCM group and in
      1.4% of the OA group. We conclude that combined treatment with omeprazole,
      clarithromycin and a higher dose of metronidazole is highly effective in curing
      H. pylori infection, and that this regimen remains very effective in the presence
      of metronidazole-resistant strains.

TI  - Omeprazole: therapy of choice in intellectually disabled children.
PG  - 1113-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study extensively the therapeutic approach of gastroesophageal
      reflux disease in intellectually disabled children. DESIGN: We studied the effect
      of omeprazole sodium on healing and symptom relief in 52 institutionalized
      intellectually disabled children (male-female, 21:31; mean age, 15.4 years;
      range, 4-19 years). INTERVENTION: Endoscopically proven esophagitis (grades I-IV,
      Savary-Miller classification) was treated with omeprazole sodium, 40 mg/d (20
      mg/d for children weighing <20 kg) as healing dose for 3 months, and 20 mg/d (10 
      mg/d for children weighing <20 kg) as maintenance dose for another 3 months.
      After 3 and 6 months, results of treatment were evaluated using symptom scoring
      and/or endoscopy. For patients with relapse, the dose was increased. RESULTS: At 
      first endoscopy, 19 patients (36%) of 52 showed grade I esophagitis; 20 (38%),
      grade II; 6 (12%), grade III; and 7 (13%), grade IV. In 44 (86%) of 51 patients, 
      treatment was effective in healing esophagitis and keeping patients in remission,
      independent of the severity of esophagitis. In 7 patients (14%), a symptomatic
      relapse was observed after decreasing the dose. However, these patients became
      symptom free again after increasing the dose and showed healing on endoscopy at
      the end of the study. One child did not finish the study for reasons not related 
      to therapy. Marked improvement of persistent vomiting, regurgitation, food
      refusal, iron deficiency anemia, and signs of depression was seen at the end.
      CONCLUSIONS: Omeprazole is highly effective for all grades of esophagitis in
      intellectually disabled children, without adverse effects. The dose needed to
      maintain the remission can be titrated according to the reflux symptoms. One
      disadvantage of medical therapy is that it is open ended, in contrast to
      operation, but surgery in this population has high mortality and complication
      rates.

TI  - Gastrointestinal manometry studies in children.
PG  - 187-91
AB  - Children with gastrointestinal motility disorders present with diverse symptoms, 
      and obtaining a detailed history is often impossible. As in adults, evaluation of
      a suspected motility disorder begins with exclusion of mechanical obstruction or 
      primary inflammatory disorders. Subsequently, coordination of peristaltic
      function is evaluated in those segments of the gastrointestinal tract that are
      suspected to be abnormal based on the clinical history. Evaluation of
      gastrointestinal motility in children is particularly challenging because of
      frequent lack of patient cooperation and difficulties in adapting the equipment
      to patient size. This review discusses the indications and approach to the
      evaluation of motility of each region of the gastrointestinal tract in infants
      and children.

TI  - Triple regimens using lansoprazole or ranitidine bismuth citrate for Helicobacter
      pylori eradication.
PG  - 997-1001
AB  - BACKGROUND: A combination of an antisecretory agent with two antibiotics is
      considered the 'gold standard' for Helicobacter pylori eradication. OBJECTIVES:
      To compare the eradication rates and the safety profile of two short-term triple 
      therapies containing lansoprazole (L) or ranitidine bismuth citrate (RBC) as
      antisecretory agents. METHODS: One hundred and twelve H. pylori-positive patients
      either with peptic ulcer (56 duodenal ulcers: 25 active and 31 with a history of 
      ulcer; 13 gastric ulcers: nine active and four with a history of ulcer) or
      gastritis (43) were included in an open, randomized, controlled trial. H. pylori 
      infection was initially detected by CLO-test and histology on antral and corpus
      biopsies. H. pylori-positive patients were randomized to receive L plus
      clarithromycin (C) 250 mg b.d. plus tinidazole (T) 500 mg b.d. (LCT) or RBC plus 
      C 250 mg b.d. and T 500 mg b.d. for 7 days (RbcCT). L or RBC were administered
      for a further 3 weeks in patients with active peptic ulcers. A second endoscopy
      was performed at least 6 weeks after the end of therapy for the assessment of H. 
      pylori infection by CLO-test and histology. Eradication was assumed if all the
      tests were negative for H. pylori. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients in the LCT group
      and 4 5 in the RbcCT group were assessed for H. pylori eradication. The
      eradication rates, according to intention-to-treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP)
      analyses were, respectively, 76.8% and 89.5% for the LCT group, and 73.2% and
      91.1% for the RbcCT group. No statistically significant difference in eradication
      rates was found between the two groups by Mantel-Haenszel test. All peptic ulcers
      were healed. In patients in whom H. pylori had been eradicated, the severity of
      gastritis was significantly reduced. Side-effects were rare. One patient in the
      LCT group and two in the RbcCT group were withdrawn because of adverse events.
      CONCLUSION: Short-term triple therapy with either lansoprazole or RBC is equally 
      effective and well tolerated.

TI  - Dual versus triple therapy: comparison of five antibiotic regimens for
      eradication of Helicobacter pylori in a prospective, randomized study.
PG  - 803-9
AB  - We compared the efficacy of three dual and two triple therapies for eradication
      of Helicobacter pylori (HP), and evaluated the influence of smoking and
      omeprazole pretreatment on HP eradication. 220 patients with proven HP infection 
      (histology and 13C-urea breath test [UBT]) were randomly allocated to one of the 
      following regimes: BMT (bismuth subsalicylate 600 mg t. i. d. for 28 days,
      metronidazole 400 mg t. i. d. and tetracycline 500 mg q. i. d. for ten days). OA 
      (omeprazole 40 mg o. d. and amoxicillin 750 mq q. i. d. for 14 days), OC
      (omeprazole 40 mg o. d. and clarithromycin 500 mg b. i. d. for 14 days), OT
      (omeprazole 40 mg o. d. and tetracycline 500 mg q. i. d. for 14 days), OMC
      (omeprazole 40 mg o. d., metroinidazole 400 mg t. i. d. and clarithromycin 250 mg
      b. i. d. for seven days). Eradication was defined as negative UBT six weeks after
      completion of the therapy. In an "all-patients-treated" ("per-protocol")
      analysis, the eradication rates were: BMT, 91% (93%); OA, 84% (90%); OC, 74%
      (74%); OT, 24% (24%); and OMC, 90% (93%). Smoking impaired the success of OA and 
      OT (p < 0.05), but the efficacy of the triple regimens was not affected.
      Omeprazole pretreatment did not influence eradication rates. Thus, highest
      eradication rates were achieved with the two triple therapies tested. However,
      OA, given at a daily antibiotic dose of 3 g amoxicillin for 14 d, was also highly
      effective. After failure of triple therapy, OA was successful in seven of ten
      patients (70%). The efficacy of OC was lower than that of the triple therapies (p
      < 0.05). In conclusion, metronidazole- and clarithromycin-based triple therapies 
      are highly effective first line therapies. OA, given at a dose of 3 g per day
      over 14 days, should be considered as a possible second line therapy, e.g. in
      retherapy after failed triple therapy.

TI  - Omeprazole. A review of its use in Helicobacter pylori infection,
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and peptic ulcers induced by nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs.
PG  - 447-86
AB  - Omeprazole is a well studied proton pump inhibitor that reduces gastric acid
      secretion. This review examines its use in Helicobacter pylori infection,
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) with or without oesophagitis and
      gastrointestinal damage caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). 
      Optimal omeprazole regimens for anti-H. pylori therapy are those that administer 
      the drug at a dosage of 40 mg/day (in 1 or 2 divided doses) for 7, 10 or 14 days 
      in combination with 2 antibacterial agents. As a component of 3-drug regimens in 
      direct comparative studies, omeprazole was at least as effective as lansoprazole,
      pantoprazole, bismuth compounds and ranitidine. However, a meta-analysis suggests
      that triple therapies with omeprazole are more effective than comparable regimens
      containing ranitidine, lansoprazole or bismuth. Omeprazole also appears to be
      successful in triple therapy regimens used in children with H. pylori infection. 
      In patients with acute GORD with oesophagitis, omeprazole is at least as
      effective as lansoprazole or pantoprazole in promoting healing, and superior to
      ranitidine, cimetidine or cisapride in oesophagitis healing and symptom relief.
      Omeprazole was similar to lansoprazole and superior to ranitidine in preventing
      oesophagitis relapse in patients with all grades of oesophagitis, but may be
      superior to lansoprazole or pantoprazole in patients with more severe disease.
      More patients with symptomatic GORD without oesophagitis experienced symptom
      relief after short term treatment with omeprazole than with ranitidine, cisapride
      or placebo, and symptoms were more readily prevented by omeprazole than by
      cimetidine or placebo. Omeprazole was effective in healing and relieving symptoms
      of reflux oesophagitis in children with oesophagitis refractory to histamine H2
      receptor antagonists. Omeprazole is superior to placebo in preventing
      NSAID-induced gastrointestinal damage in patients who must continue to take
      NSAIDs. It is also similar to misoprostol and superior to ranitidine in its
      ability to heal NSAID-induced peptic ulcers and erosions, and superior to
      misoprostol, ranitidine or placebo in its ability to prevent relapse. In long and
      short term studies, omeprazole was well tolerated, with diarrhoea, headache,
      dizziness, flatulence, abdominal pain and constipation being the most commonly
      reported adverse events. Usual omeprazole dosages, alone or combined with other
      agents, are 10 to 40 mg/day for adults and 10 to 20 mg/day for children.
      CONCLUSIONS: Omeprazole is a well studied and well tolerated agent effective in
      adults or children as a component in regimens aimed at eradicating H. pylori
      infections or as monotherapy in the treatment and prophylaxis of GORD with or
      without oesophagitis or NSAID-induced gastrointestinal damage.

TI  - Proton pump inhibitors. Pharmacology and rationale for use in gastrointestinal
      disorders.
PG  - 307-35
AB  - Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are drugs which irreversibly inhibit proton pump
      (H+/K+ ATPase) function and are the most potent gastric acid-suppressing agents
      in clinical use. There is now a substantial body of evidence showing improved
      efficacy of PPIs over the histamine H2 receptor antagonists and other drugs in
      acid-related disorders. Omeprazole 20 mg/day, lansoprazole 30 mg/day,
      pantoprazole 40 mg/day or rabeprazole 20 mg/day for 2 to 4 weeks are more
      effective than standard doses of H2-receptor antagonists in healing duodenal and 
      gastric ulcers. Patients with gastric ulcers should receive standard doses of
      PPIs as for duodenal ulcers but for a longer time period (4 to 8 weeks). There is
      no conclusive evidence to support the use of a particular PPI over another for
      either duodenal or gastric ulcer healing. For Helicobacter pylori-positive
      duodenal ulceration, a combination of a PPI and 2 antibacterials will eradicate
      H. pylori in over 90% of cases and significantly reduce ulcer recurrence.
      Patients with H. pylori-positive gastric ulcers should be managed similarly. PPIs
      also have efficacy advantages over ranitidine and misoprostol and are better
      tolerated than misoprostol in patients taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs (NSAIDs). In endoscopically proven gastro-oesophageal reflux disease,
      standard daily doses of the PPIs are more effective than H2-receptor antagonists 
      for healing, and patients should receive a 4 to 8 week course of treatment. For
      severe reflux, with ulceration and/or stricture formation, a higher dose regimen 
      (omeprazole 40 mg, lansoprazole 60 mg, pantoprazole 80 mg or rabeprazole 40 mg
      daily) appears to yield better healing rates. There is little evidence that PPIs 
      lead to resolution of Barrett's oesophagus or a reduction of subsequent
      adenocarcinoma development, but PPIs are indicated in healing of any associated
      ulceration. In Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, PPIs have become the treatment of
      choice for the management of gastric acid hypersecretion.

TI  - Cure of Helicobacter pylori infection and healing of duodenal ulcer: comparison
      of pantoprazole-based one-week modified triple therapy versus two-week dual
      therapy. The International Pantoprazole HP Study Group.
PG  - 1919-24
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Eradication of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is recommended as the
      first-line therapeutic concept for reliable long-term prevention of duodenal
      ulcer (DU) relapse. Current treatment regimens vary in efficacy, complexity, and 
      compliance. To assess the efficacy of pantoprazole in H. pylori eradication in
      parallel groups of patients using two eradication regimens. METHODS: Patients,
      (18-85 yr old; intention-to-treat, n=286) with proven DU, positive rapid urease
      test (biopsy), and 13C-urea breath test (UBT) were included in a prospective,
      randomized, multicenter study. Modified triple therapy consisted of 40 mg
      pantoprazole b.i.d., 500 mg clarithromycin t.i.d., and 500 mg metronidazole
      t.i.d. for 7 days (PCM therapy); dual therapy consisted of 40 mg pantoprazole
      b.i.d. and 500 mg clarithromycin t.id. for 14 days (PC therapy). In both groups
      40 mg pantoprazole o.d. was given until day 28 when healing of DU was evaluated
      endoscopically; H. pylori status was assessed by UBT on day 56. RESULTS: H.
      pylori eradication rate was 95% in PCM versus 60% in PC therapy groups
      (perprotocol population, p < 0.001), and 82% in PCM versus 50% in PC therapy in
      the intention-to-treat patient population (p < 0.001). The DU healing rate was
      98% in the PCM and 95% in the PC therapy groups (per-protocol population). Both
      regimens were similarly well tolerated. Adverse events in both regimens included 
      taste disturbance, diarrhea, and increased serum concentration of liver enzymes, 
      at an incidence of < 10%. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to 2-wk PC therapy (pantoprazole 
      and clarithromycin), the 1-wk PCM therapy (pantoprazole, clarithromycin, and
      metronidazole) is a significantly superior and highly promising strategy for
      eradication of H. pylori.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of rabeprazole in combination with four antibiotic regimens
      for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori in patients with chronic gastritis
      with or without peptic ulceration.
PG  - 1909-13
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Rabeprazole is a new fast acting proton pump inhibitor that has
      recently been proven to be effective in the treatment of peptic ulceration and
      reflux esophagitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate rabeprazole in
      combination with antibiotics for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori (H.
      pylori) in patients with chronic active gastritis with or without peptic ulcer
      disease. METHODS: Seventy-five H. pylori-infected patients were randomized in a
      double-blind fashion to receive a 7-day treatment regimen consisting of: RAC,
      RAM, RCM, or RC (R=rabeprazole 20 mg b.d., A=amoxycillin 1 g b.d.,
      C=clarithromycin 500 mg b.d., M=metronidazole 400 mg b.d.). Randomized patients
      were H. pylori-positive by gastric biopsy urease test, histology and 13C urea
      breath test (13C-UBT). H. pylori eradication was assessed by 13C-UBT, 4 and 8 wk 
      after finishing treatment. Endoscopy with histology and culture for antibiotic
      sensitivity testing was performed pretreatment and if treatment failed. RESULTS: 
      On an intention-to-treat analysis, treatment success was: RCM 100%, RAC 95%, RAM 
      90%, and RC 63%. The most common side effects were loose stools, headache, and
      taste disturbance, but there were no serious adverse events related to the study 
      medication. The two patients failing RAM treatment had metronidazole-resistant
      strains before and after treatment. None of the pretreatment H. pylori isolates
      from six patients failing RC were clarithromycin resistant, but three of five
      successfully cultured posttreatment had developed clarithromycin resistance.
      CONCLUSION: Rabeprazole-based triple therapy with two antibiotics for 1 wk is
      safe and effective in eradicating H. pylori. Dual therapy with clarithromycin is 
      less successful, and the majority of treatment failures develop clarithromycin
      resistance.

TI  - Low rate of emergence of clarithromycin-resistant Helicobacter pylori with
      amoxycillin co-therapy.
PG  - 887-92
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with persistent Helicobacter pylori infection following
      treatment with clarithromycin or omeprazole plus clarithromycin often develop
      clarithromycin resistance. AIM: To assess pre- and post-treatment antibiotic
      resistance in three double-blind trials of triple therapy with omeprazole,
      amoxycillin and clarithromycin. METHODS: Patients with H. pylori and duodenal
      ulcer (studies 1 and 2) or history of duodenal ulcer (study 3) were randomly
      assigned to 10 day courses of omeprazole 20 mg b.d., amoxycillin 1 g b.d. and
      clarithromycin 500 mg b.d. (OAC) or placebo, amoxycillin 1 g b.d. and
      clarithromycin 500 mg b.d. (AC). Endoscopy was performed at baseline and 4 weeks 
      after completion of therapy in studies 1 and 2, and at 4-6 weeks after therapy in
      study 3. At baseline, H. pylori was diagnosed by CLO test with confirmation by
      histology, or by culture. Eradication was defined as no positive biopsy test and 
      > or = 2 negative tests. Susceptibility testing was performed using the Etest.
      RESULTS: In the 91 patients with pre-treatment susceptible isolates who had
      persistent infection after AC, 10 developed resistance, eight had intermediate
      susceptibility and 73 continued to have clarithromycin-susceptible H. pylori
      isolates. In the 10 patients with pre-treatment susceptible isolates who had
      persistent infection after OAC, three developed clarithromycin resistance and
      seven still had susceptible isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Use of amoxycillin co-therapy 
      results in a low rate of clarithromycin resistance developing in patients with
      persistent H. pylori infection following therapy with a clarithromycin-containing
      regimen.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori eradication and ulcer healing with daily lansoprazole, plus 1
      or 2 weeks co-therapy with amoxycillin and clarithromycin.
PG  - 881-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Proton pump inhibitor based combination therapy is one standard
      strategy for Helicobacter pylori eradication. AIM: To compare the eradication and
      duodenal ulcer healing efficacy of two 2-week, single dose, lansoprazole based
      combination therapies. METHODS: Healthy adult patients with endoscopically
      confirmed, H. pylori associated duodenal ulcer disease (3 mm > ulcer < 20 mm)
      were eligible for the study. All patients received a 14 day course of
      lansoprazole 30 mg o.m., and were randomized to receive either 7 or 14 days of
      amoxycillin 1 g b.d. and clarithromycin 500 mg b.d. Patients were endoscoped at
      entry and 14-17 days later. Symptomatic, unhealed patients received a further 14 
      days of therapy with lansoprazole 30 mg o.m. Eradication was confirmed a minimum 
      of 28 days after cessation of all therapy by urease reaction and histological
      assessment of gastric body and antral biopsies (three biopsies each site).
      RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were randomized to a treatment arm, of which 58 could
      be included in an intention-to-treat and key-point-available analysis. H. pylori 
      eradication rates were identical, at 93% (95% CI: 73-98% (1 week), 78-99% (2
      week)). In the combined group, all but 13 ulcers were healed at 2 weeks; six
      required further therapy because of symptoms, while six of the seven asymptomatic
      patients went on to heal. CONCLUSION: An eradication regimen, based on a 2-week
      course of single dose lansoprazole with 1 week of antibiotic co-therapy, is
      effective in eradicating H. pylori, while the 2 weeks of acid suppression is
      usually effective in duodenal ulcer healing.

TI  - H2-antagonist maintenance therapy versus Helicobacter pylori eradication in
      patients with chronic duodenal ulcer disease: a prospective study.
PG  - 873-80
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few outcome studies directly compare Helicobacter pylori eradication 
      therapy with maintenance H2-antagonist therapy in duodenal ulcer disease. AIM: To
      examine prospectively the efficacy of H. pylori eradication therapy with
      ranitidine maintenance therapy over 1 year in patients with confirmed chronic
      duodenal ulcer. METHODS: One hundred and nineteen patients with active H. pylori 
      infection were randomized to receive ranitidine, 150 mg/day initially (58
      patients), or omeprazole, 40 mg/day, amoxycillin 2 g/day and metronidazole 1.2
      g/day for 14 days, or omeprazole 40 mg/day and clarithromycin 1.5 g/day, for 14
      days (if penicillin-allergic). Symptoms were assessed using the Gastrointestinal 
      System Rating Scale (GSRS) and SF36 quality of life index. RESULTS: 13C urea
      breath testing confirmed overall treatment success in 100% of patients (58/58)
      per protocol and 95.1% (58/61) on an intention-to-treat basis. At 4 and 12 months
      there were no differences in any GSRS symptoms between treatment groups. SF36
      analysis showed a perceived health improvement at 4 and 12 months in patients who
      received H. pylori eradication. However, despite successful H. pylori
      eradication, one-fifth of patients still required antisecretory therapy.
      CONCLUSION: Following successful H. pylori eradication, chronic duodenal ulcer
      patients were at least as well symptomatically as when taking maintenance
      ranitidine. They perceived that their health had improved, but a subgroup was
      still acid-suppression dependent.

TI  - Review article: one-week clarithromycin triple therapy regimens for eradication
      of Helicobacter pylori.
PG  - 823-37
AB  - BACKGROUND: One-week triple therapies have been endorsed as the treatment
      regimens of choice for eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection. Those that
      include clarithromycin appear to be the most effective. AIM: To review reports of
      triple therapies that include clarithromycin. METHODS: Reports were identified
      from the literature to May 1998. The variation between study designs prevents a
      formal meta-analysis. A measure of the relative efficacies of regimens has,
      however, been gained by comparison and by pooling of intention-to-treat
      eradication rates. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-two studies were identified
      which included 264 treatment arms of a 1-week triple therapy composed of
      clarithromycin with amoxycillin or a nitroimidazole (metronidazole or
      tinidazole), and either ranitidine bismuth citrate or a proton pump inhibitor
      (omeprazole, lansoprazole or pantoprazole). From reports of these studies, an
      intention-to-treat H. pylori eradication rate could be determined from 210
      treatment arms of 151 studies. CONCLUSIONS: There is little to choose between the
      efficacies of 1-week clarithromycin-based triple therapy eradication regimens.
      However, those comprising clarithromycin, a nitroimidazole and either ranitidine 
      bismuth citrate or a high dose of omeprazole are, in general, the most effective.
      Against antibiotic-resistant strains of H. pylori, regimens including ranitidine 
      bismuth citrate may be more effective than those including a proton pump
      inhibitor.

      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: HELP NSAIDs study. Helicobacter
      Eradication for Lesion Prevention.
PG  - 1016-21
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of Helicobacter pylori in patients receiving non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is unclear. We investigated the effects of H.
      pylori eradication in patients with current or previous peptic ulceration,
      dyspepsia, or both who continued to use NSAIDs. METHODS: 285 patients were
      randomly assigned omeprazole 20 mg, amoxycillin 1000 mg, and clarithromycin 500
      mg, twice daily (n=142, H. pylori eradication treatment), or omeprazole with
      placebo antibiotics (n=143, controls) for 1 week. All patients received
      omeprazole 20 mg once daily for 3 weeks until endoscopy, and, if the ulcer was
      not healed, 40 mg once daily until repeat endoscopy at 8 weeks. Ulcer-free
      patients with mild dyspepsia continued NSAIDs but not antiulcer treatment. We
      investigated ulcers with endoscopy at 1, 3, and 6 months and with
      carbon-13-labelled urea breath test at 3 months. FINDINGS: The estimated
      probability of being ulcer-free at 6 months was 0.56 (95% CI 0.47-0.65) on
      eradication treatment and 0.53 (0.44-0.62) on on control treatment (p=0.80). Time
      to treatment failure did not differ between groups for ulcers or dyspepsia alone,
      per-protocol analysis, or final H. pylori status. 66% (58-74) of the eradication 
      group compared with 14% (8-20) of the control group had a final negative H.
      pylori result (p<0.001). Fewer baseline gastric ulcers healed among
      eradication-treatment patients than among controls (72 vs 100% at 8 weeks,
      p=0.006). INTERPRETATION: H. pylori eradication in long-term users of NSAIDs with
      past or current peptic ulcer or troublesome dyspepsia led to impaired healing of 
      gastric ulcers and did not affect the rate of peptic ulcers or dyspepsia over 6
      months.

TI  - The effects of omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, on early gastric stagnation
      after a pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy: results of a randomized
      study.
PG  - 1005-10
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: To determine the effects of Omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor 
      (PPI), on gastric stasis following a pylorus-preserving pancreatico-duodenectomy 
      (PPPD) by means of a randomized trial of PPPD patients. METHODOLOGY: Forty-two
      PPPD patients were randomly divided into two groups: Group 1 (n=24) received a
      PPI through a jejunal tube after PPPD, whereas Group 2 (n=18), serving as
      controls, received a saline solution through a jejunal tube and no medication
      after a PPPD. The daily volume and total acidity of the gastric juice, aspirated 
      via nasogastric tube, were measured each day for 7 days following PPPD. RESULTS: 
      In Group 1 the mean daily aspirated volume of gastric juice was 160.2 ml, and the
      mean maximum volume was 222.8 ml on the first postoperative day. In Group 2, six 
      patients were withdrawn from this study for therapy on the third or fourth
      postoperative day due to gastric bleeding and/or a large amount of excreted
      gastric juice (in excess of 2,000 ml). The mean daily aspirated volume of gastric
      juice in the remaining Group 2 patients was 787.4 ml, and the mean maximum volume
      was 1,039 ml on the third postoperative day. Gastric secretion was significantly 
      lower in Group 1 (p<0.05). Further, the total acidity of the gastric juice was
      significantly lower in Group 1 than in Group 2 for each of the 7 postoperative
      days (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that postoperative
      administration of a PPI significantly suppresses the volume and acidity of the
      gastric juice after PPPD.

TI  - Continuous maintenance with low-dose lansoprazole versus Helicobacter pylori
      eradication in the prevention of duodenal ulcer recurrence.
PG  - 990-3
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Reduction of gastric acid secretion by maintenance treatment
      with antisecretory agents and eradication of H. pylori by antibiotics constitute 
      the most effective therapeutic options in preventing duodenal ulcer relapse. The 
      aim of this study was to compare the effect of a 12-month low-dose lansoprazole
      maintenance treatment with H. pylori eradication on the rate of ulcer relapse in 
      H. pylori-positive duodenal ulcer patients. METHODOLOGY: After a healing phase
      with lansoprazole 30 mg/die or lansoprazole 30-60 mg/die plus antibiotics
      (amoxycillin, tinidazole and colloidal bismuth subcitrate), 84 patients with
      healed duodenal ulcer entered the follow-up phase. Thirty-eight patients with
      persistent H. pylori infection received lansoprazole 15 mg at bedtime, whereas 46
      in whom H. pylori was eradicated during the acute phase received no active
      therapy during the 12-month follow-up. The two groups were well balanced
      concerning all demographic characteristics. Clinical controls were performed
      every 3 months or sooner in the event of symptomatic relapse. RESULTS: In terms
      of per protocol analysis, the overall rate of ulcer relapse at 6 months was 5.5% 
      (2/36) in the maintenance group and 0 (0/42) in the antibiotic group. The
      corresponding figures at 12 months were 20.5% (7/34) and 5.7% (2/35),
      respectively (p:ns, 95% CI for the difference -0.30+0.02). On intent to treat
      analysis, the rate of ulcer relapse at 6 months was 5.2% (2/38) in the first
      group and 0% (0/46) in the second group: at 12 months the corresponding figures
      were 19.4% (7/36) and 4.3% (2/46), respectively (p=0.06; CI 95%: +0.016+0.28). No
      significant side effects were observed during long-term maintenance with
      lansoprazole. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous maintenance with low-dose lansoprazole may 
      constitute a valuable alternative to H. pylori eradication for the prevention of 
      relapse and complications in duodenal ulcer patients not suitable for, or who
      have failed, H. pylori eradication.

TI  - Somatostatin in the prevention of recurrent bleeding after endoscopic haemostasis
      of peptic ulcer haemorrhage: a preliminary report.
PG  - 673-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although endoscopic injection therapy provides excellent initial
      haemostasis in actively bleeding ulcers, the incidence of recurrent haemorrhage
      is not negligible. The aim of this study was to compare somatostatin, omeprazole 
      and ranitidine in preventing further haemorrhage after endoscopic injection
      haemostasis. METHODS: Seventy-three patients with major stigmata of ulcer
      haemorrhage at endoscopy were treated with epinephrine injection and randomly
      assigned to receive either omeprazole (n = 24) or ranitidine (n = 24) or
      somatostatin (n = 25). The three groups were similar in all background variables 
      including mean age, clinical and endoscopic features, severity of bleeding and
      timing of the haemostatic procedure. All patients underwent a second endoscopic
      look at 48 h. Failures of treatment or retreatment underwent emergency surgery.
      RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between the groups
      in terms of initial haemostasis, need for emergency surgery, transfusion
      requirements, length of hospital stay or mortality. Early recurrent haemorrhage
      was 5/22 (22.7%) in the ranitidine group, 5/23 (21.7%) in the omeprazole group
      and 2/23 (8.7%) in the somatostatin group. No major side-effect was noted with
      drug therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The preliminary results suggest that somatostatin
      might be more effective than ranitidine and omeprazole in the prevention of
      recurrent haemorrhage following endoscopic injection therapy of bleeding peptic
      ulcers.

TI  - Dual therapy using a double dose of lansoprazole with amoxicillin versus triple
      therapy using a double dose of lansoprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin to
      eradicate Helicobacter pylori infection: results of a prospective randomized open
      study.
PG  - 1531-4
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The eradication of Helicobacter pylori is recommended in duodenal
      ulcer disease. The aim of this randomized open trial was to evaluate and compare 
      H. pylori eradication and safety after a dual therapy consisting of lansoprazole 
      (30 mg b.i.d.) and amoxicillin (1 g b.i.d.) versus a triple therapy consisting of
      lansoprazole (30 mg b.i.d.), amoxicillin (1 g b.i.d.), and clarithromycin (500 mg
      b.i.d.) administered from day 1 to day 14. METHODS: All patients with an ulcer
      received lansoprazole (30 mg) from day 15 to day 28. H. pylori status was
      determined from antral biopsies using histology, culture, and polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) upon inclusion and 1-3 months after the end of the treatment.
      RESULTS: Of the 50 patients included in the study, five did not adhere to the
      protocol. H. pylori eradication was obtained in 37.5% of the patients receiving
      lansoprazole-amoxicillin (n = 9/24) and in 95.2% of the patients receiving
      lansoprazole-amoxicillin-clarithromycin (n = 20/21, p < 0.0002). Minor side
      effects appeared in 8.3% of the cases during dual therapy (n = 2/24) and in 52%
      during triple therapy (n = 13/22, p < 0.001). These side effects consisted mainly
      of diarrhea and a metallic taste. CONCLUSION: Concomitant administration of
      double doses of lansoprazole with amoxicillin and clarithromycin is very
      efficacious against H. pylori infection compared with dual therapy.

TI  - Cure of H. pylori infection using a 7-day triple therapy combining pantoprazole
      with two antibiotics.
PG  - 206-11
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acid pump inhibitors combined with antimicrobials cure gastritis and 
      peptic ulcer disease but a standard therapy has not yet been established. We
      therefore investigated a triple therapy with pantoprazole. METHODS: The aim of
      this open-label monocenter trial, involving 30 intention-to-treat patients with
      peptic ulcer disease or functional dyspepsia, was to assess the H. pylori cure
      rate after a 7-day triple therapy with pantoprazole (40 mg bid) plus
      metronidazole (500 mg bid) and amoxicillin (1 g bid). The H. pylori status was
      assessed by rapid urease test, histological examination and culture at the
      initial examination and by histological examination and culture at the study end 
      4 weeks after ending all therapy. RESULTS: At the end of the trial H. pylori was 
      eradicated in 21 of 27 per protocol patients (78%; 95% CI 58-91%) and in 21 of 30
      patients included in the trial (70%; 95% CI 51-85%). In 15 of 16 per protocol
      patients with metronidazole-sensitive strain (94%; 95% CI 70-100%) the infection 
      was cured, but in contrast eradication was accomplished in only one of 3 patients
      with a metronidazole-resistant H. pylori strain. Post-treatment resistance to
      metronidazole was observed in 6 cases, although 4 of them had had H. pylori
      strains sensitive to metronidazole at the initial visit. The gastritis had
      clearly been improved, and the activity of gastritis had completely disappeared 4
      weeks after treatment. Seven adverse events were observed in 7 patients, the
      intensity of which was moderate in 6 cases. CONCLUSIONS: This short-term triple
      therapy with pantoprazole, amoxicillin and metronidazole provides an effective
      regimen especially in patients with metronidazole-sensitive strain.

TI  - Lansoprazole quadruple therapy is effective in curing Helicobacter pylori
      infection.
PG  - 202-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Quadruple therapy using omeprazole combined with classic bismuth
      triple therapy has been advocated as optimal therapy for the cure of Helicobacter
      pylori (H. pylori) infection. We investigated the efficacy of substituting
      lansoprazole for omeprazole in proton pump quadruple therapy. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: In a prospective open study, 219 consecutive patients, with either
      peptic ulcer disease or biopsy-proven H. pylori-associated gastritis, received
      seven days of lansoprazole, bismuth, tetracycline and metronidazole after three
      days of lansoprazole pretreatment. Cure of infection was judged by 14C urea
      breath test at six weeks after completion of therapy. RESULTS: On an intention to
      treat basis, 198 of the 219 patients (90%) were confirmed to be cured of H.
      pylori infection. Compliance was excellent and minimal side effects reported.
      CONCLUSION: Lansoprazole-based quadruple therapy achieves a very high cure rate
      in an unselected population of either peptic ulcer patients or those with H.
      pylori-associated gastritis. Recommended regimens should achieve at least 90%
      cure of infection. Lansoprazole quadruple therapy is effective and compares
      favorably with other H. pylori treatment regimens.

TI  - Performance of a rapid whole blood test for Helicobacter pylori in primary care: 
      a German multicenter study.
PG  - 179-83
AB  - BACKGROUND: Serological rapid whole-blood tests for the detection of H. pylori
      are presently being promoted for use in primary care. We conducted a multi-center
      study to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of the Boehringer Mannheim
      Helicobacter pylori test (BM test), which is identical with the Cortecs Helisal
      test. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A previous diagnosis of H. pylori, a history of
      peptic ulcer diseases, or proton-pump inhibitor, bismuth or antibiotic use during
      the preceding month were exclusion criteria. The BM test was performed prior to
      endoscopy by 7 primary care physicians, 5 practicing gastroenterologists, or a
      single physician in the university hospital outpatient service. During endoscopy,
      antral and corpus biopsies were obtained for histology and rapid urease testing
      (RUT). H. pylori positivity was defined by histology and/or RUT as reference
      methods. H. pylori IgG-ELISA was performed additionally. RESULTS: Of the 203
      patients included, 151 were H. pylori-positive by reference methods (74.4%). The 
      overall accuracy of the BM test was 77.3%. Eight BM tests were indeterminate, and
      in the other 195 patients the test performed as follows: sensitivity 80.3%,
      specificity 81.3%, positive predictive value 92.9%, negative predictive value
      57.4%. Using IgG-ELISA as reference, the BM test performance was similar. It also
      did not differ substantially among the three groups of physicians involved.
      CONCLUSIONS: We found the performance of the BM test to be insufficiently
      accurate, as both over- and underdiagnosis of H. pylori infection were not
      infrequent. This test needs to be improved before its use in primary care can be 
      recommended.

TI  - Changes in Helicobacter pylori-induced gastritis in the antrum and corpus during 
      and after 12 months of treatment with ranitidine and lansoprazole in patients
      with duodenal ulcer disease.
PG  - 735-40
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have shown that acid-suppressing treatment leads to
      aggravation of Helicobacter pylori gastritis in the corpus. It remains unclear
      whether this augmentation of the inflammation reverts to baseline after
      termination of treatment. METHODS: In 114 H. pylori-infected duodenal ulcer
      patients we investigated the gastritis parameters in antral and corpus mucosa
      before treatment, after 6 and 12 months of therapy, and 6 months after
      termination of treatment with 15 mg lansoprazole or 150 mg ranitidine/day.
      RESULTS: Lansoprazole and ranitidine led to a significant aggravation of
      gastritis in the corpus after 6 and 12 months of treatment. However, while there 
      was no change in gastritis in the antrum with ranitidine, treatment with
      lansoprazole led to partial elimination of H. pylori with improvement of the
      inflammation in this part of the stomach. Following termination of therapy, the
      observed changes reverted to baseline. No increase in intestinal metaplasia
      and/or atrophy in the antrum or corpus was observed. CONCLUSION: Both substances 
      are associated with an aggravation of H. pylori gastritis in the corpus. However,
      only lansoprazole leads to a partial elimination of H. pylori with improvement of
      the inflammation in the antrum. The changes provoked by acid-suppressing
      treatment revert to baseline after termination of therapy.

TI  - Short-term low-dose pantoprazole-based triple therapy for cure of Helicobacter
      pylori infection in duodenal ulcer patients.
PG  - 731-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: The eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection has been achieved
      using various therapy regimens, but the efficacy of the proton-pump inhibitor
      pantoprazole as part of these regimens has not yet been widely tested. AIM: To
      evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a 1-week low-dose pantoprazole-based
      triple therapy in patients with H. pylori-positive duodenal ulcer. METHODS: In an
      open single-centre prospective study, 71 patients with endoscopically proven
      active duodenal ulcer and H. pylori infection received pantoprazole 40 mg o.m.
      for 4 weeks, and during the first week a combination antimicrobial treatment
      comprising tinidazole 500 mg b.d. plus clarithromycin 250 mg b.d. H. pylori
      eradication was defined as concordant negative histology and rapid urease test
      performed at endoscopy 4-6 weeks after the end of treatment, confirmed 4 weeks
      later by 13C-urea breath test. RESULTS: Sixty-six patients (93%) completed the
      trial and five patients were lost to follow-up. H. pylori infection was cured in 
      61 out of the 66 patients who completed the trial (per-protocol analysis: 92.4%, 
      95% CI: 83.2-97.5%; intention-to-treat analysis: 85.9%, 95% CI: 75.7-93.0%). At
      final endoscopy, 65 out of 66 patients had healed ulcer (98.5%). Mild adverse
      events occurred in six patients (9.1%). CONCLUSIONS: One-week low-dose
      pantoprazole-based triple therapy is a simple, effective and well-tolerated
      regimen for ulcer healing and H. pylori eradication in patients with duodenal
      ulcer.

TI  - One-week use of ranitidine bismuth citrate, amoxycillin and clarithromycin for
      the treatment of Helicobacter pylori-related duodenal ulcer.
PG  - 725-30
AB  - BACKGROUND: Proton pump inhibitors have been widely used in combination with
      amoxycillin, clarithromycin or metronidazole for the treatment of Helicobacter
      pylori infection. AIM: To study the effects of 1-week ranitidine bismuth citrate 
      (RBC)-based triple therapy in the treatment of H. pylori-related duodenal ulcers.
      METHOD: Patients with duodenal ulcers and H. pylori infection were prospectively 
      randomized to receive either RBC with amoxycillin and clarithromycin for 1 week
      (RAC), or omeprazole with amoxycillin and clarithromycin for 1 week (OAC). No
      additional ulcer healing drug was used after the 1-week medication. Patients were
      assessed for H. pylori eradication, ulcer healing and side-effects after
      receiving the therapies. RESULTS: One hundred consecutive patients were recruited
      to this study, with 50 patients randomized to each treatment group. In the
      intention-to-treat analysis, duodenal ulcers were completely healed in 45 (90%)
      patients in the RAC group and 43 (89.6%) in the OAC group (P = 1.0). H. pylori
      eradication was confirmed in 47 (94%) in the RAC group and 42 (87.5%) in the OAC 
      group (P = 0.31). There was no significant difference in the severity of
      side-effects experienced by the two treatment groups. CONCLUSION: One-week
      RBC-based triple therapy is an effective treatment for H. pylori-related duodenal
      ulcers. The therapeutic effects are comparable to a 1-week course of proton pump 
      inhibitor-based triple therapy.

TI  - Effect of omeprazole treatment on plasma concentrations of the gastric peptides, 
      xenin, gastrin and somatostatin, and of pepsinogen.
PG  - 27-33
AB  - The peptide xenin 25 is a gastric mucosal constituent like gastrin, somatostatin 
      and pepsinogen. Gastrin and pepsinogen plasma concentrations increase when the
      secretion of gastric acid is reduced by proton pump inhibitors. In the present
      investigation, treatment with omeprazole led to an increase in fasting and
      postprandial plasma concentrations of xenin, gastrin and pepsinogens A and C (P <
      0.05, in each instance), whereas somatostatin plasma levels remained unchanged.
      Because subcutaneous injection of pentagastrin did not raise xenin plasma
      concentrations, a direct effect of gastrin on xenin production seems unlikely.
      This study indicates that xenin plasma concentrations are regulated by
      intragastric pH, as are those of gastrin and pepsinogen.

TI  - Acid peptic diseases in the era of Helicobacter pylori.
PG  - 358-68
AB  - The treatment of peptic ulcers has been revolutionized by the discovery that
      Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacteria is a causative agent for ulcer
      formation. However, when patients present with dyspepsia or epigastric
      discomfort, more than 80% of patients will not have ulcer disease and empiric
      treatment of H. pylori is not recommended for these patients. Eradication of H.
      pylori has not been demonstrated to improve the symptoms of non-ulcer dyspepsia
      compared with non-ulcer dyspepsia patients treated with placebo. Therefore, we
      recommend that patients should first be evaluated for peptic ulcers with
      endoscopy or upper gastrointestinal series before the diagnosis and treatment of 
      H. pylori. Generally, the treatment of H. pylori should be limited to patients
      with peptic ulcers, mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas, and gastric
      cancers. Most diagnostic tests for H. pylori, including quantitative IgG
      antibody, urea breath tests, rapid urease tests (CLO), tests of gastric mucosal
      biopsies, and staining of gastric mucosal biopsies, have equivalent diagnostic
      characteristics. Therefore, the choice of diagnostic test for H. pylori should be
      based on cost, ease of use, and lack of complications. Multiple antibiotic
      regimens are available for the treatment of H. pylori. Triple antibiotic therapy 
      is the least expensive but has the highest rate of side effects and the least
      compliance. Combining a proton pump inhibitor with clarithromycin and another
      antibiotic will eradicate H. pylori with fewer side effects and better compliance
      but this is the most expensive antibiotic regimen.

TI  - Noninvasive diagnosis of gastroesophageal inflammation using dipyridamole
      thallium-201 tomography.
PG  - 1255-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Esophagitis, a complication of GERD, and gastric erosions are common
      findings in dyspeptic patients. Unfortunately, these findings cannot be predicted
      based on symptoms alone and require endoscopy for an accurate diagnosis.
      Noninvasive diagnosis of other gastrointestinal pathology by radiopharmaceuticals
      (GA 67, Tc 99m pertechnetate) has previously been studied. We hypothesized that
      endoscopically documented esophagitis and/or gastric erosions could also be
      detected by using dipyridamole thallium-201 imaging and, if they were of
      sufficient accuracy, could serve as a useful, noninvasive screening test for
      esophagitis and/or gastric erosions. METHODS: A pilot study was undertaken in 12 
      patients undergoing endoscopy for symptoms of GERD or dyspepsia. Esophagitis was 
      defined as the presence of either erosions or ulceration and gastric erosions
      were defined as discrete mucosal breaks measuring > or = 1 mm. Dipyridamole
      thallium-201 imaging was performed the following day on all 12 patients. A
      standard dose of dipyridamole (0.56 mg/kg) was infused over 4 min, followed by a 
      3-mCi dose of thallium-201. Initial stress tomographic images and reinjection (1 
      mCi) resting tomographic images 3-4 h later were obtained using a gamma camera.
      Tomographic images were read blinded to the endoscopy results. Thallium-201
      uptake was graded on a 0-3+ scale using the liver uptake as the internal
      comparative standard (2+ = uptake equal to the liver). Abnormal thallium uptake
      was defined as > or = 2+ in the area of the esophagus or stomach. RESULTS: Seven 
      women and five men (mean age 41 yr, range 25-60 yr) were studied. Eight patients 
      were taking histamine-2 receptor antagonists and none were on proton pump
      inhibitors, or promotility agents. All five patients with endoscopic esophagitis 
      had a positive thallium-201 tomographic image. Seven patients had no evidence of 
      esophagitis, and three had positive thallium-201 tomograms. Dipyridamole
      thallium-201 imaging sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative
      predictive values for esophagitis were 100%, 57%, 63%, and 100%, respectively.
      All three patients with gastric erosions had positive thallium-201 tomograms. Six
      of nine patients without gastric erosions had positive tomograms. The
      sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of DT 201
      gastric erosions were 100%, 33%, 33%, and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:
      Dipyridamole thallium-201 tomographic imaging has good sensitivity (100%) in
      detecting esophagogastric mucosal erosions, but its poor specificity (33-57%)
      results in an unacceptable accuracy as a screening test. Additionally, the cost
      of radiopharmaceuticals requires that sensitivity and specificity be at least
      equal to that of endoscopy for this test to be clinically valuable as a screening
      test. However, a noninvasive test for these diseases is inherently appealing, and
      further research in this area seems to be warranted.

TI  - An ascending single-dose safety and tolerance study of an oral formulation of
      rabeprazole (E3810).
PG  - 667-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: Proton pump inhibitors such as omeprazole produce a long-lasting
      inhibition of gastric acid secretion associated with significant increases in
      plasma gastrin. Rabeprazole (E3810) is a new substituted benzimidazole H+,K+
      ATPase inhibitor. It acts as an irreversible, non-competitive inhibitor of the
      H+,K+ ATPase and preliminary studies demonstrate that rabeprazole produces a
      potent and long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion and a low level of
      hypergastrinaemia. AIM: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study
      was performed to further examine the effects of different single doses of
      rabeprazole on gastric acid secretion and serum gastrin. METHODS: In this study, 
      four groups of 10 healthy, non-smoking Helicobacter pylori-negative men (mean age
      22.5 +/- 3.9 years) received single oral doses of 10, 20, 30 and 40 mg of
      rabeprazole. Two of the 10 volunteers in each group received placebo as part of
      the double-blind study design. All volunteers who entered into the study had a
      normal gastric acid secretory capacity as evaluated by pentagastrin challenge.
      Prior to administration of the first dose of test drug, volunteers underwent an
      inpatient 24-h measurement of baseline intragastric pH. One week later,
      volunteers received the test drug and again underwent an inpatient 24-h
      measurement of intragastric pH. During both periods, plasma samples were
      collected at specified intervals over 48 h and were sent for analysis of
      rabeprazole and gastrin levels. RESULTS: Administration of rabeprazole resulted
      in a dose-dependent increase in the duration and extent of intragastric pH
      elevation. The response among all volunteers receiving drug was significantly
      different from placebo, with greater acid inhibition occurring in the 30 and 40
      mg groups. In addition, there was also a dose-related increase in plasma gastrin.
      The pharmacokinetics of rabeprazole were similar to those of other proton pump
      inhibitors with a t1/2 of between 0.7 and 1.0 h. There were no clinically
      significant effects on patient laboratory tests or serious adverse events.
      CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that rabeprazole is as potent as
      omeprazole and lansoprazole in inhibiting gastric acid secretion.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori eradication as a surrogate marker for the reduction of
      duodenal ulcer recurrence.
PG  - 619-33
AB  - OBJECTIVES: An abundance of data exists documenting the association of H. pylori 
      eradication with the reduction in duodenal ulcer recurrence. AIM: To evaluate the
      validity of using H. pylori eradication as a surrogate marker for the reduction
      in duodenal ulcer recurrence using rigorously controlled studies. METHODS: Three 
      controlled clinical trials were conducted in patients with uncomplicated, active 
      duodenal ulcers. Patients were treated with various combinations of omeprazole
      and amoxycillin. Ulcer healing and H. pylori eradication were assessed. For
      patients whose duodenal ulcer healed, duodenal ulcer recurrence was determined
      over a 6-month period in patients with H. pylori eradication and those remaining 
      positive for H. pylori at least 4 weeks after treatment. To support the data
      obtained from these clinical trials, a search of the medical literature was
      conducted to identify additional human clinical trials in which duodenal ulcer
      recurrence rates were measured and categorized by H. pylori status at least 1
      month post-treatment. RESULTS: In 11 controlled trials, the overall 6-18-month
      duodenal ulcer recurrence rate was 54% among patients remaining positive for H.
      pylori at least 4 weeks after treatment compared to 6% among patients with H.
      pylori eradication following treatment. This finding was corroborated by the
      uncontrolled trials, in which the duodenal ulcer recurrence rate was 64% among
      patients found to be H. pylori-positive and 6% for patients found to be H.
      pylori-negative at least 4 weeks after treatment. A time course of duodenal ulcer
      recurrence rates using pooled data from both controlled and uncontrolled studies 
      demonstrated that duodenal ulcer recurrence rates for H. pylori-negative patients
      persisted for up to 4 years following treatment. Duodenal ulcer recurrence rates 
      for H. pylori-positive patients increased for the first year, then levelled off. 
      A comparison of the duodenal ulcer recurrence rates for different treatment
      regimens revealed that eradication regimens based on omeprazole plus antibiotics 
      and bismuth plus antibiotics exhibited similar duodenal ulcer recurrence rates
      for H. pylori-positive and -negative patients. CONCLUSION: Regardless of
      treatment regimens, H. pylori eradication produced a consistent and significant
      reduction in duodenal ulcer recurrence. Therefore H. pylori eradication, 4 weeks 
      post-therapy, can be used as a surrogate marker for reduced duodenal ulcer
      recurrence in investigational clinical trials.

TI  - Influence of clarithromycin dosage on pantoprazole combined triple therapy for
      eradication of Helicobacter pylori.
PG  - 613-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low-dose clarithromycin (250 mg b.d.) in combination with omeprazole 
      and metronidazole has been recommended for the eradication of Helicobacter
      pylori. Whether the substitution of omeprazole by pantoprazole requires
      adjustment of the clarithromycin dose is not known. AIM: To directly compare the 
      efficacy and tolerability of two different dosages of clarithromycin in
      combination with pantoprazole and metronidazole. METHODS: One hundred and
      sixty-three patients with endoscopically confirmed gastritis, gastric or duodenal
      ulcers and positive H. pylori findings in the rapid urease test were randomized
      and treated for 7 days with pantoprazole (40 mg b.d.). metronidazole (500 mg
      b.d.) and clarithromycin using either a regimen of 500 mg b.d. (group PMC 500) or
      250 mg b.d. (group PMC 250). Eradication success was determined no less than 4
      weeks after concluding therapy using the 13C-urea breath test. RESULTS:
      One-hundred and thirty-nine patients completed the study. Based on a per protocol
      analysis. successful eradication was documented in 63/70 patients (90.0%) in
      group PMC 500 and in 62/69 patients (89.9%) in group PMC 250. Based on the
      intention-to-treat analysis, eradication rates were 78.8% (group PMC 500) and
      75.6% (group PMC 250). The incidence of adverse effects was significantly higher 
      in patients receiving PMC 500 (50.0%) than in those receiving PMC 250 (25.4%).
      CONCLUSIONS: Triple therapy with pantoprazole, metronidazole and clarithromycin
      provides an efficient eradication regimen for H. pylori infection. A low dose of 
      clarithromycin is equal to a higher dose in therapeutic efficacy and it offers
      the advantage of improved tolerance and lower cost.

      maintenance therapy. Twelve patients with severe hypergastrinaemia (gastrin > 400
      ng/L) were compared with 14 control patients (gastrin < 300 ng/L). Helicobacter
      pylori serology and a laboratory screen were obtained in all patients. Gastric
      emptying was scored by the evidence of food remnants upon endoscopy 12 h after a 
      standardized meal. Gastric antrum and corpus biopsies were analysed for
      histological parameters, as well as somatostatin and gastrin concentrations. All 
      patients underwent a meal-stimulated gastrin test and the hypergastrinaemia
      patients also underwent a vagal nerve integrity assessment by pancreatic
      polypeptide testing (PPT). RESULTS: Severe hypergastrinaemia patients had a
      longer duration of treatment (80 vs. 55 months; P = 0.047) and were characterized
      by a higher prevalence of H. pylori infection (9/12 vs. 2/14, P = 0.004), corpus 
      mucosal inflammation and atrophic gastritis (P < 0.04). This was reflected in
      lower serum pepsinogen A concentrations (mean +/- S.E.M. 53.6 +/- 17.9 vs. 137
      +/- 16.0 mg/L, P = 0.03), pepsinogen A/C ratio (1.8 +/- 0.3 vs. 4.1 +/- 0.6, P = 
      0.005) and mucosal somatostatin concentrations (2.75 +/- 0.60 vs. 4.48 +/- 1.08
      mg/g protein, P = 0.038). Two patients in the hypergastrinaemia group had signs
      of delayed gastric emptying, but none in the normogastrinaemia group did (P =
      N.S.). In addition, both groups had a normal meal-stimulated gastrin response.
      CONCLUSION: Severe hypergastrinaemia during omeprazole maintenance therapy for
      GERD is associated with the duration of therapy and H. pylori infection, but not 
      with abnormalities of gastric emptying or vagal nerve integrity.

TI  - A comparison of 10 and 14 days of lansoprazole triple therapy for eradication of 
      Helicobacter pylori.
PG  - 1651-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data from large, multicenter, US studies determining the efficacy of 
      triple therapy for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori are lacking, especially
      for a treatment duration of less than 14 days. METHODS: Patients with H pylori
      infection and active duodenal ulcer disease or a history of duodenal ulcer
      disease within the past year were randomized to receive 30 mg of lansoprazole, 1 
      g of amoxicillin, and 500 mg of clarithromycin twice daily for 10 or 14 days. The
      primary efficacy end point was the eradication of H pylori as confirmed by
      negative histological and culture results at 4 to 6 weeks after the completion of
      treatment. RESULTS: Of 284 patients enrolled in the study from 46 US sites, 236
      met the entry criteria. At 4 to 6 weeks after the end of therapy, H pylori was
      eradicated in 85% (96/ 113) of the patients receiving 14-day triple therapy and
      in 84% (103/123) of those receiving 10-day triple therapy by per-protocol
      analysis (95% confidence interval for treatment group differences, -10.5 to 8.1; 
      P>.05). There was also no significant difference between the 14- and 10-day
      treatment groups when analyzed by an intent-to-treat analysis of H pylori
      eradication. A similar proportion of patients in each treatment group reported an
      adverse event related to therapy (34% [46/136] vs 38% [56/148], respectively).
      CONCLUSIONS: In patients with an active or a recent history of duodenal ulcer,
      lansoprazole-based triple therapy for 10 or 14 days is highly effective in the
      eradication of H pylori. The duration of therapy may be reduced from 14 to 10
      days without a significant effect on regimen efficacy.

TI  - Effect of omeprazole in patients with chest pain and normal coronary anatomy:
      initial experience.
PG  - 51-5
AB  - Gastroesophageal reflux is frequently found in patients with chest pain despite
      normal coronary anatomy, but little data on the effect of specific medication
      exist. After performing 24 h ambulatory pH monitoring and the Bernstein test on
      23 patients with normal coronary anatomy, we gave omeprazole, 40 mg nocte, for
      six weeks to these and to a control group of ten patients with coronary disease. 
      Pain episodes per fortnight fell from 16.2 to 12.0 (P=0.02) in the patients with 
      normal anatomy and from 19.6 to 17.1 (nonsignificant) in the patients with
      coronary disease. Improvement occurred in seven (30%) of the patients with normal
      coronary anatomy compared with one (10%) of those with coronary disease, while
      complete resolution occurred in four (17%) and none, respectively. Improvement or
      complete resolution were not predicted by the results of 24 h pH monitoring,
      although there was a trend towards the prediction of efficacy by the Bernstein
      test. Omeprazole shows promise as a treatment for patients with chest pain
      despite normal coronary anatomy and larger placebo-controlled trials should now
      be undertaken.

TI  - Triple therapy with omeprazole, amoxicillin and clarithromycin is effective
      against Helicobacter pylori infection in gastric ulcer patients as well as in
      duodenal ulcer patients. Results of a randomized controlled trial in Japan.
PG  - 321-5
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: There have been few reliable published studies permitting
      assessment of therapeutic regimens for Helicobacter pylori infection in gastric
      ulcer (GU) patients. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of
      omeprazole-based dual and triple therapy regimens, both including clarithromycin,
      for the cure of H. pylori infection in active GU and duodenal ulcer (DU)
      patients. The study was conducted in Japan, a country in which GU is more
      prevalent than DU. METHODS: Two hundred and thirty-four consecutive peptic ulcer 
      patients (GU: n = 124; DU: n = 103; GDU: n = 7) suffering from H. pylori
      infection were randomly treated with either omeprazole 20 mg b.i.d. + amoxicillin
      500 mg q.i.d. + clarithromycin 400 mg b.i.d. (OAC) or with omeprazole 20 mg
      b.i.d. + clarithromycin 400 mg b.i.d. (OC) for 14 days. H. pylori infection was
      evaluated by histology and culture from antral and corpus biopsies 6 weeks after 
      completing antimicrobial therapy. RESULTS: Follow-up data were available in 202
      patients. The cure rates of H. pylori infection in GU patients were 83.9% (47/56)
      with OAC and 59. 2% (29/49) with OC. Corresponding rates in DU patients were
      91.5% (43/47) and 70.5% (31/44), respectively. The cure rates with OAC were
      significantly higher than those with OC (p < 0.001, chi2 test). The cure rates in
      GU patients were lower than those in DU patients for both regimens, but these
      differences were not statistically significant. Side effects were generally mild 
      and did not interfere with compliance. One patient in the OAC group and 2
      patients in the OC group complained of severe side effects that led to therapy
      discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: Triple therapy with omeprazole, amoxicillin and
      clarithromycin is a safe and effective regimen for the cure of H. pylori
      infection in GU patients as well as in DU patients. We recommend this triple
      regimen as a first-line treatment in all patients with peptic ulcers associated
      with H. pylori infection in Japan.

TI  - Randomized comparison of 1-hour topical method vs. amoxycillin plus omeprazole
      for eradication of Helicobacter pylori in duodenal ulcer patients.
PG  - 69-75
AB  - BACKGROUND: A novel 1-h topical method eradicated Helicobacter pylori in 96% of
      dyspeptic patients. The eradication rate of amoxycillin/omeprazole therapy varies
      from 0 to 93%. AIM: To compare both methods in patients with endoscopically
      proven duodenal ulcer. METHODS: Eighty patients (59 males, 21 females; median age
      43 years) were randomized into two therapeutic groups. The first group (group A) 
      was treated with a 6-week course of ranitidine 300 mg/day, then omeprazole 20 mg 
      b.d. with pronase 36000 units/day for 2 days, followed by 1-h topical therapy
      with a solution of bismuth, metronidazole, amoxycillin and pronase. The second
      group (group B) consisted of patients treated with omeprazole 20 mg b.d. and
      amoxycillin 2 g/day for 2 weeks, followed by a 4-week course of ranitidine 300
      mg/day. Eradication of H. pylori was assessed by urease test, histology, a
      polymerase chain reaction and a 13C-urea breath test, all of which were performed
      4 weeks after discontinuation of the antibacterial treatment. RESULTS:
      Eradication rates in groups A and B were 2.5% and 35% in an intention-to-treat
      analysis, respectively. Side-effects were encountered in 40.5% and 12.5% of
      subjects in groups A and B, respectively. Treatment tolerance was rated as poor
      by 54% of patients in group A and 2.5% of patients in group B. CONCLUSIONS: Both 
      treatment regimens, the 1-h topical method and amoxycillin with omeprazole, have 
      low eradication rates in patients with duodenal ulcer. In addition, the topical
      treatment is characterized by a high rate of side-effects and poor tolerance.
      Based on the results of our study, neither method can be recommended for
      eradication of H. pylori in patients with duodenal ulcer.

      of Helicobacter pylori and healing of duodenal ulcer.
PG  - 59-62
AB  - AIM: To compare the efficacy and safety of triple therapy with omeprazole plus
      amoxycillin and clarithromycin vs. ranitidine bismuth citrate plus amoxycillin
      and clarithromycin in the treatment of Helicobacter pylori-associated duodenal
      ulcers. METHODS: Eighty-one patients with duodenal ulcers were randomized to the 
      following treatments: 39 cases with amoxycillin 1 g b.d. and clarithromycin 500
      mg b.d. for 1 week plus omeprazole 20 mg b.d. for 2 weeks (omeprazole +
      amoxycillin + clarithromycin (OAC)), and 42 cases to the same regimen of
      amoxycillin and clarithromycin for 7 days plus ranitidine bismuth citrate 400 mg 
      b.d. for 2 weeks (ranitidine bismuth citrate + amoxycillin + clarithromycin
      (RbAC)). Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed together with a rapid
      urease test and histological examination of antral and corpus biopsy samples
      prior to treatment and 4 weeks after the end of therapy. RESULTS: Thirty-four
      patients in the OAC group and 38 in the RbAC group completed the treatment and
      4-week follow-up. H. pylori was eradicated in 30 of 34 patients (88%) in the OAC 
      group and in 32 of 38 patients (84%) in the RbAC group according to a
      per-protocol analysis (P = N.S.). Thirty-three (97%) patients treated with OAC
      and 36 (95%) treated with RbAC presented healed duodenal ulcers at 4 weeks (P =
      N.S.). On an intention-to-treat basis there was no difference in H. pylori
      eradication between the OAC (77%) and RbAC groups (76%); duodenal ulcer healing
      was achieved in 85 and 86% of patients in the OAC and RbAC groups, respectively
      (P = N.S.). CONCLUSION: The OAC and RbAC triple therapy regimens proved equally
      effective in both H. pylori eradication and in duodenal ulcer healing.

TI  - Omeprazole is more effective than cimetidine in the prevention of recurrence of
      GERD-associated heartburn and the occurrence of underlying oesophagitis.
PG  - 41-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is documentation of the long-term use of omeprazole 10 mg o.d. 
      in patients with reflux oesophagitis but not in the large number of
      gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GERD) patients without oesophagitis. There is
      also a paucity of data on the long-term use of cimetidine in GERD patients.
      METHODS: One hundred and fifty-six patients (100 male) who previously had
      symptomatic non-ulcerative oesophagitis (81%) or symptoms without oesophagitis
      (19%), were recruited. All patients were in symptomatic remission following 4
      weeks of omeprazole 20 mg o.d. or cimetidine 400 mg q.d.s. and, if required, a
      further 4 weeks of omeprazole 20 mg o.d. Patients were randomized to receive,
      double-blind, either omeprazole 10 mg o.m. (n = 77) or cimetidine 800 mg nocte (n
      = 79) for 24 weeks. RESULTS: A greater proportion of patients receiving
      omeprazole, compared with cimetidine, were in symptomatic remission after 12 (69 
      vs. 27%) and 24 weeks (60 vs. 24%) (each P < 0.0001). The median time to
      symptomatic relapse was longer for patients receiving omeprazole (169 vs. 15
      days) (P = 0.0001). Of patients leaving the study in symptomatic remission, a
      greater proportion receiving omeprazole, compared with cimetidine, was free of
      oesophagitis (84 vs. 53%) (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Omeprazole 10 mg o.m. is more
      effective than cimetidine 800 mg nocte in the prevention of recurrence of
      GERD-associated heartburn and the occurrence of underlying oesophagitis.

TI  - Primary gastroduodenal prophylaxis with omeprazole for non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drug users.
PG  - 135-40
AB  - AIM: To investigate the efficacy of omeprazole 20 mg o.m. as primary prophylaxis 
      against non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-associated ulcer disease or 
      dyspeptic symptoms. METHODS: A parallel group study compared patients randomized 
      to receive omeprazole 20 mg o.m. or placebo as co-therapy with on-going NSAID
      treatment, over 6 months, in 19 specialist centres in Ireland, Hungary, France,
      the UK and the USA. One hundred and sixty-nine patients taking NSAIDs regularly, 
      chronically and above defined minimum doses entered the trial. The main outcome
      measure was the development of gastric or duodenal ulcers detected
      endoscopically, the development of multiple erosions in the stomach or duodenum, 
      or the onset of moderate or severe dyspeptic symptoms. RESULTS: The estimated
      probability of remaining free of these end-points for 6 months for patients
      taking omeprazole was 0.78 compared to 0.53 for placebo (P = 0.004). Fourteen
      patients receiving placebo (16.5%) developed 15 ulcers, comprising nine gastric
      and six duodenal ulcers, compared to three patients (3.6%) receiving omeprazole
      (all gastric ulcers). Logistic regression analysis showed that older patients
      were less likely, whilst those with rheumatoid arthritis were more likely, to
      remain free of NSAID-associated problems. CONCLUSIONS: Omeprazole is an effective
      agent for gastroduodenal prophylaxis in patients taking NSAIDs. Its main effect
      is to reduce the rate of development of gastric and duodenal ulcers.

TI  - US double-blind, controlled trials of omeprazole and amoxycillin for treatment of
      Helicobacter pylori.
PG  - 377-82
AB  - BACKGROUND: Widely variable Helicobacter pylori eradication rates have been
      reported with omeprazole/amoxycillin dual therapy. We present the first US
      double-blind, controlled trials of this dual therapy. METHODS: Three separate
      studies were performed: Studies 1 and 2 included patients with an active duodenal
      ulcer and Study 3 included patients with a documented history of duodenal ulcer. 
      H. pylori eradication regimens in all studies were omeprazole plus amoxycillin
      vs. omeprazole vs. amoxycillin for 2 weeks. Doses in Study 1 were omeprazole 40
      mg b.d. and amoxycillin 500 mg t.d.s., and in Studies 2 and 3 they were
      omeprazole 20 mg b.d. and amoxycillin 1 g t.d.s. Endoscopic biopsy tests were
      used for H. pylori diagnosis, and testing for H. pylori eradication was done at
      least 4 weeks after the completion of therapy. Amoxycillin sensitivities were
      performed in Study 2. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP)
      analyses showed that eradication rates with omeprazole/amoxycillin [ITT: 39%,
      40%, 46% (n = 72, 62, 48); PP: 50%, 46%, 54% (n = 54, 52, 37)] were significantly
      greater than monotherapy with either omeprazole (ITT: 0-4%); PP: 0-5%) or
      amoxycillin (ITT: 2-5%; PP: 0-11%). No patients taking the dual therapy
      discontinued therapy due to adverse events. Amoxycillin resistance was not seen
      at baseline (n = 76) or after amoxycillin therapy (n = 56). CONCLUSIONS:
      Omeprazole/amoxycillin dual therapy is well tolerated but the eradication rate
      which can be expected in the USA is at best about 50%.

TI  - Omeprazole and sucralfate in the treatment of NSAID-induced gastric and duodenal 
      ulcer.
PG  - 355-60
AB  - AIM: To establish the healing efficacy of two drugs, omeprazole and sucralfate,
      when given to patients who had developed gastric or duodenal ulcer while
      undergoing chronic treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
      METHODS: Ninety-eight patients with arthritis or arthrosis and NSAID-related
      gastric or duodenal ulcer were admitted to the endoscopic, single-blind study.
      They were randomized to receive either omeprazole 20 mg o.m. or sucralfate 2 g
      b.d. for 4-8 weeks. The patients continued to receive the same NSAID during the
      trial. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed at entry and after 4 or 8
      weeks. RESULTS: Eighty-eight patients completed the 4-week study, but only 81
      were available for final analysis at 8 weeks. Omeprazole was significantly
      superior to sucralfate in inducing gastric ulcer healing after both 4 (87 vs.
      52%, P = 0.007) and 8 weeks (100 vs. 82%, P = 0.04). No statistically significant
      difference in duodenal ulcer healing rates emerged between the two groups either 
      at 4 (79 vs. 55%) or 8 weeks (95 vs. 73%). The healing rates in patients with
      combined gastric and duodenal ulcer were 67 vs. 33% after 4 weeks and 6 7 vs. 6
      7% after 8 weeks of treatment. The percentages of asymptomatic patients were
      similar in the two treatment groups both at 4 (70 vs. 73%) and 8 weeks (70 vs.
      75%). H. pylori infection did not influence healing rates, but significantly more
      H. pylori-positive patients healed with omeprazole. CONCLUSIONS: The results of
      this study show that omeprazole is superior to sucralfate in healing
      NSAID-induced gastroduodenal ulcer in patients who continue to take
      anti-inflammatory drugs. The good results observed were unrelated to H. pylori
      status.

TI  - Dose-response relationship of lansoprazole to gastric acid antisecretory effects.
PG  - 321-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Proton pump inhibitors have been found to be effective in numerous
      studies in patients with peptic ulcer disease, particularly associated with
      Helicobacter pylori and gastro-oesophogeal reflux disorders. Optimal healing
      rates of antisecretory therapy for peptic acid disease is dependent upon the
      degree and duration of acid suppression and the length of treatment. OBJECTIVE:
      To evaluate the extent and duration of gastric acid suppression of several
      lansoprazole regimens, administered for 5 consecutive days in 32 healthy adult
      male subjects. METHODS: Intragastric 24-h pH monitoring was performed in 32
      healthy subjects in a randomized, double-blind, four-way crossover study. Sixteen
      subjects (Group 1) received lansoprazole 30 mg o.d. (once daily), 15 mg b.d.
      (twice daily), 30 mg b.d. and 30 mg t.d.s. (three times a day) for 5 days; and 16
      subjects (Group 2) received lansoprazole 30 mg o.d., 60 mg o.d., 60 mg b.d. and
      60 mg t.d.s. for 5 days. RESULTS: Mean 24-h intragastric pH values for
      lansoprazole 30 mg o.d., 15 mg b.d., 30 mg b.d. and 30 mg t.d.s. were 4.47, 4.57,
      5.07 and 5.63, respectively. Multiple-dose regimens of lansoprazole 30 mg b.d.
      and t.d.s. produced greater acid suppression compared to lansoprazole 30 mg o.d. 
      and 15 mg b.d. There was no significant difference in acid suppression between
      lansoprazole 30 mg o.d. and 15 mg b.d. Mean 24-h intragastric pH values for
      lansoprazole 30 mg o.d., 60 mg o.d., 60 mg b.d. and 60 mg t.d.s. were 4.13, 4.45,
      5.19 and 5.13, respectively. Multiple-dose regimens of lansoprazole 60 mg b.d.
      and t.d.s. produced significantly greater acid suppression compared to
      lansoprazole 30 mg o.d. and 60 mg o.d. There was no significant difference in
      acid suppression between lansoprazole 30 mg o.d. and 60 mg o.d. Lansoprazole 30
      mg t.d.s., 60 mg b.d. and 60 mg t.d.s. produced significantly greater percentage 
      time above pH 3, 4, 5 and 6 than did lansoprazole 30 mg o.d. Post-regimen serum
      gastrin values increased by 50-130% from pre-study mean values but remained
      within normal range and returned to pre-study values 7-14 days post-dosing.
      CONCLUSIONS: Multiple-dose regimens of lansoprazole (> or =30 mg b.d. for 5 days)
      produce significantly increased intragastric pH and significantly longer duration
      of increased intragastric pH than does lansoprazole 30 mg administered once
      daily.

TI  - Efficacy of tetracycline and metronidazole alone or with ranitidine on the
      healing of duodenal ulcer and eradication of Helicobacter pylori. A randomized
      controlled multicenter study. Tetra-Metro-Ran Study Group.
PG  - 686-90
AB  - In almost all eradication regimens, which contain antibiotics and bismuth
      derivatives, the administration of acid suppressing drugs for 4-6 weeks is
      recommended for healing of duodenal ulcer. The aim of this multicenter double
      blind study is to elucidate the effect of two classic antibiotics tetracycline
      (CAS 60-54-8) and metronidazole (CAS 443-48-1) alone or combined with ranitidine 
      (CAS 66357-35-5) on the healing of duodenal ulcer and eradication of Helicobacter
      Pylori. Patients with duodenal ulcer were randomized to two treatment groups:
      group A received either ranitidine 4 x 150 mg or tetracycline 4 x 500 mg or
      metronidazole 3 x 250 mg for 2 weeks. Group B received 4 x placebo + tetracycline
      and metronidazole as in group A for 2 weeks. A final endoscopy was performed
      after 8 weeks. Four biopsy specimens were obtained from the antrum (two) and
      corpus (two) for both urease test and hematoxylin stain for detection of H.
      pylori. Out of 201 patients entering the study 156 completed the study (78 in A
      and 78 in B). The healing rate of duodenal ulcer was 98.7% in group A and 97.5 in
      group B. The eradication rate was only 33.3% in group B but 64% in group A (p <
      0.001), when additionally ranitidine was given. The present study shows that
      treatment with the two antibiotics tetracycline and metronidazole alone results
      in a very low H. pylori eradication, but almost complete healing of duodenal
      ulcer after 8 weeks. Prolonged administration of antisecretory drugs in
      eradication regimens containing two antibiotics is not necessary for duodenal
      ulcer healing. However, the addition of H2-receptor antagonists or proton pump
      inhibitors to antibiotics increases the eradication rate.

TI  - Sample size calculation in economic evaluations.
PG  - 327-35
AB  - A simulation method is presented for sample size calculation in economic
      evaluations. As input the method requires: the expected difference and variance
      of costs and effects, their correlation, the significance level (alpha) and the
      power of the testing method and the maximum acceptable ratio of incremental
      effectiveness to incremental costs. The method is illustrated with data from two 
      trials. The first compares primary coronary angioplasty with streptokinase in the
      treatment of acute myocardial infarction, in the second trial, lansoprazole is
      compared with omeprazole in the treatment of reflux oesophagitis. These case
      studies show how the various parameters influence the sample size. Given the
      large number of parameters that have to be specified in advance, the lack of
      knowledge about costs and their standard deviation, and the difficulty of
      specifying the maximum acceptable ratio of incremental effectiveness to
      incremental costs, the conclusion of the study is that from a technical point of 
      view it is possible to perform a sample size calculation for an economic
      evaluation, but one should wonder how useful it is.

TI  - Omeprazole in patients with mild or moderate reflux esophagitis induces lower
      relapse rates than ranitidine during maintenance treatment.
PG  - 742-51
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Patients with reflux esophagitis have rapid relapses after
      treatment withdrawal. This study was designed to investigate the relapse rate of 
      symptomatic esophagitis during maintenance treatment with omeprazole versus
      ranitidine after the induction of acute healing with omeprazole. METHODOLOGY:
      Patients with endoscopically verified acute erosive or ulcerative esophagitis
      (grade 2 or 3) were initially treated with 20 mg of omeprazole daily for 4, 8, or
      12 weeks. After healing, the patients were randomized to maintenance treatment
      with omeprazole (20 mg every morning) or ranitidine (150 mg twice daily). A
      control endoscopy was performed at the end of the healing phase and after 6
      months of maintenance treatment or symptomatic relapse. RESULTS: Of 231 initially
      treated patients, 223 were healed (no erosive esophagitis) and entered the
      maintenance study. The estimated proportions of patients in remission after 6
      months of maintenance treatment with 20 mg of omeprazole once per day (n = 102)
      and 150 mg of ranitidine twice per day (n = 103) were 89.2% and 75.7%,
      respectively. The single daily dose of omeprazole worked significantly better
      than the doses of ranitidine (p < 0.001). The omeprazole group, in comparison to 
      the ranitidine group, had a significantly higher number of patients without
      symptoms (37.8% vs 54.7%) and a lesser percentage of moderate symptoms (9.45% vs 
      19.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Maintenance treatment with omeprazole (20 mg once daily) is 
      superior to ranitidine (150 mg twice daily) in keeping patients with mild to
      moderate erosive reflux esophagitis in remission over a 6-month period.

TI  - Screening for Helicobacter pylori in young dyspeptic patients referred for
      investigation--endoscopy for those who test negative.
PG  - 577-82
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies in young dyspeptic patients have suggested that screening
      strategies based on non-invasive H. pylori testing can reduce endoscopy workload 
      by 25-40%. Such strategies usually propose that only H. pylori-positive
      individuals should undergo endoscopy. This approach may fail to diagnose
      idiopathic ulcers, ulcers in patients whose screening test is falsely negative
      and reflux disease. AIM: To investigate a hypothetical screening strategy in
      which endoscopy is initially performed only in H. pylori-negative dyspeptics.
      METHODS: Seventy-two consecutive patients under 45 years of age undergoing
      investigation for 'ulcer-like' dyspepsia had invasive and non-invasive
      determination of H. pylori status. Individuals found to be H. pylori-positive at 
      endoscopy received 1 week of proton pump inhibitor-based triple therapy. H.
      pylori-negative individuals received therapy tailored to their diagnosis.
      Endoscopy was repeated in the positive group to confirm successful eradication.
      Results were analysed according to our strategy, i.e. serologically-positive
      patients would have received eradication therapy without endoscopy, but patients 
      found to be negative would have been referred for endoscopy. RESULTS: According
      to the serology test there were 39 positive and 33 negative results. Symptoms
      failed to resolve during follow-up in nine of the serological positives despite
      successful eradication. There were also five false positives who were deemed
      likely treatment failures. Thus according to our strategy, these 14
      serologically-positive patients would ultimately have required an endoscopy and
      the other 25 serologically-positive patients would have avoided an endoscopy,
      resulting in a 35% reduction in endoscopy usage in this population. In the
      serologically-negative group there were three cases of peptic ulcer disease where
      the test was falsely negative, but they were detected by the strategy. No cases
      of gastric malignancy were detected at endoscopy. Thus our strategy would have
      reduced initial endoscopy referrals by 35% in this selected population.
      CONCLUSION: A strategy of empirical H. pylori eradication therapy can safely
      reduce the requirement for endoscopy in young dyspeptic patients without sinister
      symptoms.

TI  - Addition of bismuth subnitrate to omeprazole plus amoxycillin improves
      eradication of Helicobacter pylori.
PG  - 557-61
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the addition of bismuth subnitrate to a dual oral 
      therapy regimen with omeprazole plus amoxycillin could improve Helicobacter
      pylori eradication. METHODS: Fifty consecutive Helicobacter pylori-positive
      patients were randomly enrolled to receive either (A) bismuth subnitrate (300 mg 
      q.d.s.), omeprazole (20 mg b.d.) and amoxycillin (500 mg q.d.s.), or (B)
      omeprazole (20 mg b.d.) and amoxycillin (500 mg q.d.s.). Both groups (n=25 each) 
      received the medication for 14 days. H. pylori status was reassessed 30 days
      after completion of the therapy in order to evaluate eradication rates. RESULTS: 
      Six patients were lost to follow-up and therefore excluded from the study (three 
      patients from each group). One patient from Group B withdrew from the study
      because of side-effects. The addition of bismuth subnitrate to omeprazole and
      amoxycillin significantly improved its efficacy in eradicating H. pylori, with
      72% (18/25) eradication in Group A and 52% (13/25) in Group B (P=0.027). The
      addition of bismuth subnitrate to dual oral therapy was also capable of improving
      the healing of peptic ulcers when compared with dual oral therapy alone (100%,
      8/8 vs. 58%, 4/7; P=0.021). CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that the addition
      of bismuth subnitrate to dual oral therapy enhances H. pylori eradication, and
      improves healing of peptic ulcers.

TI  - Lansoprazole and secnidazole with clarithromycin, amoxycillin or pefloxacin in
      the eradication of Helicobacter pylori in a developing country.
PG  - 551-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: A number of triple drug regimens using proton pump inhibitors and two
      antibiotics have been evaluated in the West and reported to achieve Helicobacter 
      pylori eradication rates of over 90%. In developing countries however, these
      combinations have neither been well evaluated, nor the optimum treatment for H.
      pylori infection well defined. AIM: To compare the combination of a proton pump
      inhibitor with a nitroimidazole and another antibiotic in eradicating H. pylori
      infection and healing duodenal ulcer. METHODS: Sixty consecutive patients with
      active duodenal ulcer who were positive for H. pylori (by rapid urease test and
      14C-urea breath test) were randomized into three treatments groups: (1) LAS
      (n=21): lansoprazole 30 mg o.m., amoxycillin 500 mg q.d.s. and secnidazole 2 g on
      alternate days for 2 weeks; (2) LCS (n=18): lansoprazole 30 mg o.m.,
      clarithromycin 500 mg b.d. and secnidazole 2 g on alternate days for 1 week; (3) 
      LPS (n=21): lansoprazole 30 mg o.m., pefloxacin 400 mg o.m. and secnidazole 2 g
      on alternate days for 2 weeks. Urease and breath tests were performed at 0, 6 and
      12 weeks to check for H. pylori eradication. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat
      eradication rates were as follows: LAS 86%, LCS 83%, LPS 71%; the overall ulcer
      healing rate was 90% at 6 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: High H. pylori eradication rates
      were achieved using the amoxycillin- and clarithromycin-based therapies. Fewer
      side-effects, better compliance and low cost favoured the amoxycillin-based
      therapy.

TI  - Two-week course of pantoprazole combined with 1 week of amoxycillin and
      clarithromycin is effective in Helicobacter pylori eradication and duodenal ulcer
      healing.
PG  - 545-50
AB  - BACKGROUND: Experience with proton pump inhibitor-based triple therapy is
      predominantly with omeprazole-containing regimens. AIM: To investigate the
      efficacy of a pantoprazole-based regimen, with either a 1 or 2-week course of
      antibiotic co-therapy, in eradicating H. pylori, healing duodenal ulcers and to
      assess the antibiotic sensitivity profiles of isolated H. pylori strains.
      METHODS: A single-blind, multicentre, parallel group comparison of patients with 
      endoscopically proven, H. pylori associated, active duodenal ulceration. All
      patients received pantoprazole, 40 mg b.d. for 2 weeks. Patients were randomized 
      to receive either 1 or 2 weeks of therapy with amoxycillin, 1 g b.d. and
      clarithromycin 500 mg b.d. Patients were endoscoped at entry, at 14 days and a
      minimum of 4 weeks after cessation of all therapy. H. pylori status was
      determined by urease reaction, histological assessment and culture from antral
      and body biopsies. Antibiotic sensitivity was determined using the agar dilution 
      technique. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients were randomized. One week co-therapy
      (n=33): eradication efficacy, ITT= 79% (95% CI: 61-91%); ulcer healing efficacy
      (at 6-week visit)=88% (95% CI: 72-97%). Two-week co-therapy (n=34): eradication
      efficacy, ITT=91% (95% CI: 76-98%: ulcer healing efficacy= 88% (95% CI: 73-97%). 
      Both regimens were well tolerated and no primary antibiotic resistance was noted.
      CONCLUSION: Pantoprazole-based triple therapy, with either 1 or 2 weeks of
      co-therapy with amoxycillin and clarithromycin, is effective in eradicating H.
      pylori and healing duodenal ulceration.

      asthma was combined with GER to identify all studies of the effects of medical
      antireflux therapy on asthma control. The articles' bibliographies were also
      reviewed. Studies were graded according to Sackett's criteria and grouped by
      levels of evidence. RESULTS: A total of 242 citations were found; 171 were
      published in English. Twelve studies of the effects of medical antireflux therapy
      on asthma control, with a total of 326 treated patients, were identified. Eight
      studies were placebo-controlled, three were open studies, and one used an
      untreated control. Eight studies treated 20 or fewer patients. Reflux symptoms
      either did not improve or the effects of antireflux therapy on them were not
      reported in four studies. The combined data from the controlled medical
      antireflux studies showed that: (1) asthma symptoms improved in 69% of the
      subjects; (2) asthma medication use was reduced in 62% of the subjects; (3)
      evening peak expiratory flow (PEF), but not PEF at other times, improved in 26%
      of the subjects; and (4) spirometry did not improve in any of the
      placebo-controlled antireflux studies. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the combined data
      suggests that medical antireflux therapy improves asthma symptoms, may reduce
      asthma medication use, but has minimal or no effect on lung function.

TI  - The impact of Helicobacter pylori eradication on peptic ulcer healing.
PG  - 1080-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Current literature was reviewed analyzing the outcome of peptic ulcer 
      healing in relation to the results of the posttherapeutic Helicobacter pylori
      (HP) status. METHODS: Literature was reviewed along with an analysis of 60
      studies, comprising a total of 4329 patients. RESULTS: Successful Helicobacter
      pylori eradication was found to induce a better response in peptic ulcer healing,
      regardless of diagnosis: gastric ulcer 88% vs 73% (odds ratio [OR] 2.7, p <
      0.01), duodenal ulcer 95% vs 76% (OR 5.6, p < 0.0001), and peptic ulcer 95% vs
      76% (OR 6.6, p < 0.0001), for patients having their HP infection successfully
      cured versus those remaining HP-positive, respectively (Fisher's exact test). For
      all evaluated time points (< or = 6, 7-8, and 10-12 wk after beginning
      treatment), HP-negative patients had higher healing rates than HP-positive
      patients (95% vs 82%, 94% vs 69%, and 96% vs 78% with corresponding OR of 4.2,
      6.5, and 7.4, all p < 0.0001, Fisher's exact test). The use of concomitant acid
      suppression therapy during initial HP eradication provided a benefit on peptic
      ulcer healing only for patients with persistent HP infection (improved healing
      rates of 78% vs 67%; otherwise rates were 94-96%). Likewise, prolonged acid
      inhibition in HP treatment failures after the initial HP treatment phase resulted
      in 7-20% improved healing rates, whereas patients becoming HP-negative did not
      profit. CONCLUSION: Successful HP eradication therapy accelerates peptic ulcer
      healing even without concomitant acid suppression.

TI  - Omeprazole improves peak expiratory flow rate and quality of life in asthmatics
      with gastroesophageal reflux.
PG  - 1060-3
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine if omeprazole improves
      pulmonary function and quality of life in asthmatics with gastroesophageal
      reflux. METHODS: This was a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled
      cross-over trial. After a 4-wk lead-in period, nine patients with documented
      asthma and gastroesophageal reflux, were prescribed either omeprazole 20 mg,
      daily or placebo for 8 wk and then crossed over to the alternate treatment.
      Outcome measurements included: forced expiratory volume at 1 s (FEV1), peak
      expiratory flow rate (PEFR), and responses on the Asthma Quality of Life
      Questionnaire, a validated disease specific measure of functional status.
      RESULTS: After omeprazole treatment, compared with placebo, patients had higher
      mean morning and evening PEFR, mean absolute difference (95% CI): morning: 37.8
      L/min. (10.9-64.6), evening: 31.2 (3.2-59.2). Omeprazole treatment led to higher 
      mean overall scores on the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire, and on the
      subdomains of activity limitation, symptoms, and emotions (p = 0.039, 0.049,
      0.024, 0.040). A trend toward higher FEV1 (mean: 15.6% difference) with
      omeprazole failed to reach statistical significance (p > 0.2). CONCLUSIONS: After
      taking omeprazole for 8 wk, asthmatics with GER have better PEFR and quality of
      life than after placebo.

TI  - Susceptibility of Helicobacter pylori isolates to metronidazole, clarithromycin
      and amoxycillin in vitro and in clinical treatment in Japan.
PG  - 1131-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Primary and acquired resistance to antibiotics is an important factor
      in determining the reason for treatment failure in Helicobacter pylori infection.
      We examined the relationship between the susceptibility of H. pylori isolates and
      the efficacy of chemotherapy. METHODS: The minimal inhibitory concentrations
      (MICs) of metronidazole (MNZ), clarithromycin (CLAR) and amoxycillin (AMOX) of
      320 H. pylori pre-treatment isolates were determined by the agar dilution method.
      In 290 patients with peptic ulcers. H. pylori infection was treated by dual or
      triple combination therapies for 2 weeks: one proton pump inhibitor (30 mg/day
      lansoprazole or 20 mg/day omeprazole) and one or two antibiotics (500 mg AMOX,
      200 mg CLAR or 250 mg MNZ twice a day). MICs were also determined after the
      treatment failure. RESULTS: Among the drugs tested, for MNZ and CLAR, 8.1% and
      9.1% of the isolates, respectively, were resistant, while no isolate was
      resistant to AMOX. After unsuccessful treatment using MNZ and CLAR, 66.7% and
      70.61% of the isolates changed from sensitive to resistant, respectively. All
      isolates were sensitive to AMOX after treatment failure. CONCLUSIONS: The failure
      of the H. pylori treatment results in the induction of resistance to CLAR and/or 
      MNZ. Regimens with a high cure rate should be used in order to prevent the
      generation of acquired resistance to antibiotics.

TI  - Ranitidine bismuth citrate with clarithromycin versus omeprazole with amoxycillin
      in the cure of Helicobacter pylori infection.
PG  - 1123-9
AB  - AIM: To compare the efficacy of ranitidine bismuth citrate plus clarithromycin
      (RBC-C) vs. omeprazole plus amoxycillin (OME-AMO) in the cure of Helicobacter
      pylori infection. METHODS: In this double-blind, multicentre, parallel-group
      study 122 H. pylori-positive patients with active duodenal ulcer or gastritis,
      with confirmed history of duodenal ulcer, were randomized to treatment with
      ranitidine bismuth citrate 400 mg b.d. plus clarithromycin 500 mg b.d. or
      omeprazole 20 mg b.d. plus amoxycillin 1000 mg b.d. for 14 days, followed by 14
      days of ranitidine bismuth citrate 400 mg b.d. or omeprazole 20 mg once daily,
      respectively, to facilitate ulcer healing. Endoscopy was carried out at the start
      of the study and 28 days after the end of treatment. At each endoscopy four
      biopsies were obtained from the antrum and four biopsies from the corpus, for
      rapid urease test, histology and culture. H. pylori infection was defined as a
      positive urease test, confirmed by histology or culture. Cure of H. pylori
      infection was defined as negative urease test, histology or culture from both
      sites. RESULTS: Per-protocol, all-patients-treated and intention-to-treat cure
      rates (95% confidence interval) were, respectively, 90% (81-89%), 90% (82-89%)
      and 84% (74-93%) for ranitidine bismuth citrate plus clarithromycin, and 39%
      (27-54%), 44% (31-57%) and 41% (29-53%) for omeprazole plus amoxycillin, P <
      0.00001. Both regimens were well tolerated. Eight patients were lost to
      follow-up, for lack of efficacy (one patient), adverse events (three patients) or
      refusal of second endoscopy (four patients). CONCLUSION: Ranitidine bismuth
      citrate 400 mg b.d. with clarithromycin 500 mg b.d. is superior to omeprazole 20 
      mg b.d. with amoxycillin 1000 mg b.d. Ranitidine bismuth citrate with
      clarithromycin is the first dual therapy with high cure rates and good tolerance,
      and is easy to take. It may therefore prove a suitable first-line treatment in H.
      pylori infection.

TI  - Prognostic factors for relapse of reflux oesophagitis and symptoms during 12
      months of therapy with lansoprazole.
PG  - 1093-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Symptom relief and endoscopic healing are both important treatment
      goals in patients with reflux oesophagitis. Knowledge of predictive factors for
      treatment success could facilitate choice of treatment in individual patients.
      AIM: To assess the value of clinical data and data from baseline ancillary
      investigations in predicting the outcome of maintenance therapy with a proton
      pump inhibitor. METHODS: After healing and symptom relief had been obtained on
      open therapy with lansoprazole 30 mg daily, 103 patients with reflux oesophagitis
      grade 1 or 2 were randomized to maintenance therapy with lansoprazole 15 or 30 mg
      daily, and time until recurrence of symptoms and/or endoscopic changes was
      recorded. The predictive value of the following variables was assessed by Cox
      regression analysis: dose of lansoprazole, symptom severity, grade of reflux
      oesophagitis. Helicobacter pylori infection status, lower oesophageal sphincter
      resting tone, percentage of 24 h with an oesophageal pH of <4.0, and median 24 h 
      intragastric pH before start of treatment. RESULTS: Dose of lansoprazole (P =
      0.01) and symptom severity (P < 0.05) both significantly predicted time to
      relapse. Grade of reflux oesophagitis had only a borderline predictive value (P =
      0.09), while H. pylori infection status and data from manometry and
      intraoesophageal 24-hour pH-metry did not predict relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Symptom
      severity before starting therapy is a significant predictive factor for treatment
      success during potent antisecretory therapy with lansoprazole, more so than
      endoscopic grade of reflux oesophagitis. In a group of patients with
      uncomplicated reflux oesophagitis being considered for maintenance therapy with
      lansoprazole, ancillary investigations with endoscopy, manometry and 24-hour
      pH-metry gave very limited prognostic information. H. pylori infected patients
      relapsed as early as patients who were not infected.

PG  - 1087-92
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pantoprazole is a benzimidazole derivative which selectively inhibits
      the proton pump H+. K+-ATPase necessary for the final step in gastric acid
      secretion. AIM: To investigate the tolerability and the prophylactic effect of
      pantoprazole 40 mg once daily on relapse in patients whose reflux oesophagitis
      had been healed. METHODS: The safety of pantoprazole 40 mg once daily was

      been healed with omeprazole or pantoprazole. Relapse was defined as
      endoscopically-confirmed reflux oesophagitis (at least Grade I), with endoscopies
      being performed for patients experiencing 3 consecutive days of disease-specific 
      symptoms. RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier survival analysis at 6 and 12 months gave
      estimated treatment failure rates of 2% and 6% from confirmed relapses
      (per-protocol), and of 9% and 30% for a worst-case group (all withdrawals counted
      as failures). The only population shift in laboratory variables was a doubling of
      the median serum gastrin level over the first 6 months; thereafter it stabilized.
      Fifty-four (24%) patients experienced adverse events; 15 of these withdrew.
      Serious adverse events were reported for 12 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Pantoprazole
      appears to be highly effective and to have a good safety profile for long-term
      prophylaxis of reflux oesophagitis.

TI  - Omeprazole 20 or 40 mg daily for healing gastroduodenal ulcers in patients
      receiving non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
PG  - 463-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are strongly
      associated with gastroduodenal ulcers, and the management of patients with
      NSAID-associated ulcers represents a common clinical dilemma. AIM: To assess
      NSAID-associated ulcer healing during treatment with either standard (20 mg) or
      high dosage (40 mg) omeprazole. METHODS: One hundred and sixty-nine patients
      chronically ingesting diclofenac, ketoprofen, indomethacin or naproxen for
      osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, who had abdominal pain and an
      endoscopically proven gastroduodenal ulcer, were evaluated in a randomized,
      double-blind, dose regimen trial with omeprazole 20 mg o.m. (n = 81) or
      omeprazole 40 mg o.m. (n = 88). Ulcer healing was assessed endoscopically at 4
      and 8 weeks in the case of unhealed ulcers. Patients continued their usual daily 
      dose of anti-inflammatory medication throughout the study period. RESULTS: One
      hundred and fifty-six patients completed the study (77 patients taking 20 mg
      omeprazole and 79 patients taking 40 mg omeprazole); 12 patients were lost during
      follow-up and one patient reported an adverse event. Cumulative ulcer
      intention-to-treat healing rates at 8 weeks were 88% (95% confidence interval
      (CI) = 79-95%) for the 20 mg omeprazole group and 96.2% (95% CI = 89-99%) for the
      40 mg group, and 97.1% (95% CI = 90-100%) for the 20 mg omeprazole group and
      98.6% (95% CI = 93-100%) for the 40 mg group by per protocol analysis. There were
      no statistically significant differences between the two groups. Symptom relief
      did not differ significantly between the two treatment groups. CONCLUSION: Both
      standard and high doses of omeprazole are equally safe and effective regimens for
      the treatment of NSAID-induced gastroduodenal ulcers when anti-inflammatory
      treatment is not discontinued.

TI  - Prospective evaluation of a new anti-ulcer agent, ecabet sodium, for the
      treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection.
PG  - 457-61
AB  - BACKGROUND: A new anti-ulcer agent, ecabet sodium, is active against Helicobacter
      pylori. AIM: To assess the efficacy of ecabet sodium for the eradication of H.
      pylori in patients with gastroduodenal diseases. METHODS: In a prospective,
      randomized and controlled study, patients infected with H. pylori were assigned
      to one of the following two groups: group LA, who received lansoprazole 30 mg
      o.d. + amoxycillin 500 mg q.d.s. after meals for 2 weeks, and group LAE, who
      received lansoprazole 30 mg o.d. + amoxycillin 500 mg q.d.s. + ecabet sodium 1000
      mg b.d. after meals for 2 weeks. H. pylori status was determined before and at
      least 4 weeks after the therapy by rapid urease test, histology and a urea breath
      test. RESULTS: Of 101 patients (mean age 53 years, range 17-77 years, M/F: 68/33)
      enrolled in the study, 97 patients completed the protocol. Four patients were
      withdrawn because of diarrhoea (three from group LA) and skin rash (one from
      group LAE). The eradication of H. pylori was achieved in 28/48 (58%) patients in 
      group LA and 38/49 (78%) patients in group LAE. The rate of eradication of H.
      pylori produced by the LAE treatment was significantly higher than that produced 
      by the LA treatment. Side-effects appeared in two patients (malaise 1, skin rash 
      1) in group LAE and in seven patients (diarrhoea 6, dizziness 1) in group LA.
      These side effects disappeared spontaneously with cessation of the treatment.
      CONCLUSIONS: Ecabet sodium in combination with lansoprazole and amoxycillin
      increased the rate of eradication of H. pylori. Ecabet sodium appeared to reduce 
      the incidence of diarrhoea as a side-effect of the dual LA therapy.

TI  - Comparison of omeprazole and lansoprazole in short-term triple therapy for
      Helicobacter pylori infection.
PG  - 433-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Effective anti-Helicobacter pylori therapies with few side-effects
      are needed. AIM: To study the effectiveness of short-term triple therapy with
      amoxycillin, clarithromycin and either omeprazole or lansoprazole for eradication
      and healing of peptic ulcers. METHODS: Patients with gastric or duodenal ulcers
      received amoxycillin (1 g b.d.), clarithromycin (500 mg b.d.) and lansoprazole
      (30 mg b.d.) (LAC) or omeprazole (20 mg b.d.) (OAC) for 7 days. Endoscopic
      examinations were performed before treatment and at least 4 weeks after
      completion of therapy. H. pylori status was confirmed by rapid urease test and
      histological examination (Giemsa stain) from gastric biopsies taken from both the
      antrum and the body. RESULTS: A total of 356 patients were randomized in this
      single-blind study. On a per protocol basis, H. pylori was eradicated in 134 of
      170 patients (79%) in the lansoprazole group and in 105 of 146 (72%) in the
      omeprazole group (P = 0.189); and in intention-to-treat analysis 72% and 62%,
      respectively (P = 0.043). Healing of the ulcers was obtained in 166 of 186 (98%),
      and in 139 of 146 patients (95%), respectively (P = 0.357). Side-effects occurred
      in two patients in the LAC group and in six in the OAC group B (four stopped
      therapy). CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that the two regimens are highly
      effective in healing duodenal ulcers and are well tolerated. Neither treatment
      achieves the ideal cure rate for H. pylori. Lansoprazole does not appear to have 
      a significant advantage over omeprazole either in ulcer healing or in H. pylori
      eradication.

TI  - Assessment of symptomatic response as predictor of Helicobacter pylori status
      following eradication therapy in patients with ulcer.
PG  - 618-22
AB  - BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy is routinely used for
      treating patients with peptic ulcer disease. AIMS: To assess the value of
      symptomatic response to H pylori eradication therapy as a marker of
      post-treatment H pylori status. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and nine
      dyspeptic patients with active duodenal or gastric ulceration association with H 
      pylori infection had their symptoms measured by a validated questionnaire before 
      and three months following H pylori eradication therapy. The symptomatic response
      was compared with post-treatment H pylori status as determined by the 14C urea
      breath test. RESULTS: An eradication rate of 84% was achieved. Of the 92 patients
      eradicated of H pylori, 47% experienced complete or near complete resolution of
      dyspepsia. Of the 17 patients in whom the infection was not eradicated, only one 
      (6%) experienced resolution of dyspepsia. Resolution of dyspepsia was therefore a
      powerful predictor of eradication of H pylori with a predictive value of 98%. In 
      contrast, persistence of dyspepsia was a weak predictor of persisting infection
      with a predictive value of only 25%. Excluding patients with endoscopic evidence 
      of coexisting oesophagitis and/or retrosternal discomfort or reflux at initial
      presentation did not increase the predictive value of persisting dyspepsia for
      persisting infection. CONCLUSIONS: Complete resolution of dyspeptic symptoms is a
      powerful predictor of eradication of H pylori infection in ulcer patients.
      Persistence of symptoms is a weak predictor of persisting infection and patients 
      with persisting dyspepsia must have their H pylori status rechecked to guide
      future management.

TI  - The clinical and economic value of a short course of omeprazole in patients with 
      noncardiac chest pain.
PG  - 42-9
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Evaluation of new patients with noncardiac chest pain (NCCP)
      may require a variety of costly tests. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
      efficacy of the omeprazole test (OT) in diagnosing gastroesophageal reflux (GERD)
      in patients with NCCP and estimate the potential cost savings of this strategy
      compared with conventional diagnostic evaluations. METHODS: Thirty-nine patients 
      referred by cardiologists were enrolled. Baseline symptoms were recorded, and the
      patients were randomized to either placebo or omeprazole (40 mg AM and 20 mg PM) 
      groups for 7 days. Patients were crossed over to the other arm after a washout
      period and repeat baseline symptom assessment. All patients underwent 24-hour
      esophageal pH monitoring and upper endoscopy before randomization. RESULTS:
      Thirty-seven patients (94.9%) completed the study. Twenty-three (62.2%) were
      classified as GERD positive and 14 as GERD negative. Eighteen (78%) GERD-positive
      patients and 2 (14%) GERD-negative patients had a positive OT (P < 0.01),
      yielding a sensitivity of 78.3% (95% confidence interval, 61.4-95.1) and
      specificity of 85.7% (95% confidence interval, 67.4-100). Economic analysis
      showed that the OT saves $573 per average patient evaluated and results in a 59% 
      reduction in the number of diagnostic procedures. CONCLUSIONS: The OT is
      sensitive and specific for diagnosing GERD in patients with NCCP. This strategy
      results in significant cost savings and decreased use of diagnostic tests.

TI  - No effects of high-dose omeprazole in patients with severe airway
      hyperresponsiveness and (a)symptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux.
PG  - 1070-4
AB  - Acid gastro-oesophageal reflux may aggravate respiratory symptoms in patients
      with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) by increasing airway
      hyperresponsiveness through vagally-mediated pathways. We wanted to determine
      whether elimination of acid reflux could improve symptoms in such patients. In a 
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 36 allergic and nonallergic
      subjects (17 males and 19 females, mean age 52 yrs), with airway obstruction and 
      severe airway hyperresponsiveness despite maintenance treatment with an inhaled
      corticosteroid and with increased acid gastro-oesophageal reflux, were treated
      either with omeprazole, 40 mg b.i.d., or placebo for 3 months. Primary endpoints 
      were: airway hyperresponsiveness, as determined by the provocative concentration 
      of methacholine producing a 20% fall in forced expiratory volume in one second
      (PC20); and airway obstruction. Secondary endpoints were: peak expiratory flow
      variability; reversibility to inhaled ipratropium bromide as a parameter of vagal
      activity; asthma symptoms scores; and medication used. Reflux was measured by 24 
      h ambulatory intraoesophageal pH measurement. Omeprazole, 40 mg b.i.d., for 3
      months had no beneficial effect on any of the pulmonary parameters, despite its
      profound effect on acid reflux and improvement of reflux symptoms scores,
      compared to placebo. The results of this study do not support a role for
      intensive antireflux therapy to improve pulmonary symptoms and function in
      patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, who have severe
      airway hyperresponsiveness despite maintenance treatment with inhaled
      corticosteroids.

TI  - Two-day quadruple therapy for cure of Helicobacter pylori infection: a
      comparative, randomized trial.
PG  - 932-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare a 2-day quadruple therapy with a 14-day triple
      therapy in the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection. METHODS: Eighty-one
      consecutive patients with an endoscopically diagnosed peptic ulcer and
      demonstrated infection by H. pylori were included in the study. Patients were
      randomized to receive omeprazole 40 mg b.i.d., amoxicillin 2.5 g once daily,
      metronidazole 500 mg t.i.d., and bismuth subcitrate 360 mg t.i.d. for 2 days,
      followed by omeprazole 20 mg once daily for 6 additional days (Group 1) or a
      14-day course of omeprazole 20 mg b.i.d., amoxicillin 1 g t.i.d., and
      metronidazole 500 mg t.i.d. (Group 2). Eradication was evaluated by antral biopsy
      and rapid urease test at 2 months after therapy and by C13-urea breath test after
      a year. RESULTS: Two patients were lost to follow-up at 2 months.
      Intention-to-treat analysis showed that H. pylori infection was cured in 29 of 42
      patients (69%; 95% CI: 53-82%) in Group 1 versus 36 of 39 (92%; 95% CI: 78-98%)
      of patients in Group 2 (p = 0.009). Per-protocol analysis showed a cure rate of
      71% (95% CI: 55-84%) (29/41 patients) and 95% (95% CI: 81-99%) (36/38 patients), 
      respectively (p = 0.007). Fifty-five of 65 cured patients returned 1 year after
      treatment (26 in Group 1, 29 in Group 2). All but one in Group 2 remained cured. 
      There were no significant differences in compliance (88% in Group 1 versus 92% in
      Group 2) or in the presence of side effects (27%; 95% CI: 15-43% versus 41%; 95% 
      CI: 26-58%; ns). CONCLUSION: Two-day quadruple therapy is significantly less
      effective than 2-wk triple treatment.

TI  - Eradication of Helicobacter pylori reduces the rate of duodenal ulcer rebleeding:
      a long-term follow-up study.
PG  - 925-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The long-term efficacy of Helicobacter pylori eradication to reduce
      the rate of recurrence of peptic ulcer bleeding is still uncertain. We evaluated 
      the rate of duodenal ulcer rebleeding for 48 months after H. pylori eradication. 
      METHODS: Thirty-two male patients with H. pylori infection and duodenal ulcer
      bleeding were treated with omeprazole (40 mg/day for 4 wk), colloidal bismuth
      (480 mg/day for 2 wk), amoxicillin (2 g/day for 1 wk), and metronidazole (750
      mg/day for 1 wk), and followed up for 48 months. Endoscopy and tests for H.
      pylori infection were repeated every year. RESULTS: Ulcer healed in all patients,
      but H. pylori infection persisted or recurred in 11 patients. Within 48 months,
      rebleeding occurred in nine (81.8%) of these patients, whereas the 21 patients
      who were persistently negative for H. pylori infection remained asymptomatic
      without rebleeding (0/ 21 = 0%, p < 0.002) during the whole follow-up.
      CONCLUSIONS: Eradication of H. pylori can reduce the rate of duodenal ulcer
      rebleeding for at least 4 yr, thus potentially modifying the natural history of
      the disease.

TI  - Ranitidine bismuth citrate in the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection and 
      duodenal ulcer.
PG  - 672-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the clinical pharmacology of ranitidine bismuth citrate in
      the treatment of Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection and duodenal ulcer. DATA
      SOURCES: A MEDLINE search of the English-language literature from 1992 to January
      1997 was conducting using the key terms Tritec, ranitidine, and bismuth.
      References of articles pertaining to treatment of duodenal ulcer or HP were
      extensively searched for relevant sources. DATA EXTRACTION: All articles
      pertaining to ranitidine bismuth citrate were considered for inclusion, with
      emphasis placed on randomized, double-blind trials. Priority was placed on data
      pertaining to regimens that are currently approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration for the treatment of duodenal ulcer in conjunction with HP. DATA
      SYNTHESIS: Each tablet of ranitidine bismuth citrate 400 mg contains 162 mg of
      ranitidine base, 128 mg of trivalent bismuth, and 110 mg of citrate. It uses the 
      acid-suppressive actions of ranitidine and the antimicrobial and mucosal
      protective effects of bismuth to eradicate HP. Ranitidine bismuth citrate in
      conjunction with clarithromycin represents one of four treatment regimens
      currently approved in the US for duodenal ulcer associated with HP infection. In 
      four double-blind, randomized trials, this agent has achieved HP eradication
      rates of 73-94% and duodenal ulcer healing rates of 73-89%. It is given twice
      daily for 28 days, and is associated with very low rates of adverse effects.
      CONCLUSIONS: Relative to some therapeutic alternatives, ranitidine bismuth
      citrate plus clarithromycin may be simpler to take and have less adverse effects,
      but may be more expensive. Compared with omeprazole plus clarithromycin, it is
      less expensive, may have lower ulcer healing rates, but may be more effective in 
      eradicating HP. The role of ranitidine bismuth citrate will continue to evolve as
      more patients are treated, and other regimens continue to be tested for duodenal 
      ulcer healing and HP eradication.

      controlled, double blind comparison].
PG  - 482-5
AB  - In a randomised double-blind parallel study the gastroduodenal tolerability of
      300 mg acetylsalicilic acid daily (ASA, CAS 50-78-2) has been evaluated in the
      presence of placebo (n = 8), 40 mg pantoprazole (CAS 102625-70-7) daily (8 a.m.) 
      (n = 16) and 300 mg ranitidine (CAS 66357-35-5) daily (8 a.m.) (n = 16) in
      healthy volunteers using upper GI-endoscopy. The treatment period lasted 14 days,
      endoscopic controls were performed at entry and repeated at day 14. At entry, the
      mean endoscopic score averaged 1.0 +/- 0.0 (+/- SEM) in the ASA/placebo, in the
      ASA/pantoprazole and the ASA/ranitidine group. In the placebo experiments 300 mg 
      ASA daily induced marked gastroduodenal lesions at day 14 (lesion score of 6.8
      +/- 1.4 (+/- SEM). Concomitant administration of 40 mg pantoprazole daily offered
      significant protection against 300 mg ASS daily on day 14 (2.1 +/- 0.6) (+/- SEM)
      (p < 0.05) vs ASA/placebo. 300 mg ASA plus 300 mg ranitidine daily reduced the
      damaging score to 4.9 +/- 1.2 (+/- SEM) (n.s. vs ASA/ placebo). Our data suggest 
      that coadministration of 40 mg pantoprazole daily reduces significantly
      gastroduodenal lesions evoked by 300 mg ASA daily.

TI  - Miconazole gel increases the cure rate of Helicobacter pylori infection when
      added to lansoprazole and amoxicillin in a randomized trial.
PG  - 120-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Miconazole is an antimycotic agent with bacteriocidal activity
      against Helicobacter pylori in vitro. Its role in the clinical eradication of H. 
      pylori has not been studied. The objective of this study was to investigate the
      efficacy and side effect profile of miconazole for the treatment of H. pylori.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 65 patients with gastritis or peptic ulcer
      disease in whom H. pylori infection was confirmed by a rapid urease test and
      microbiologic assessment. In vitro miconazole sensitivity was assessed for the H.
      pylori strains isolated from the enrolled patients. All patients were randomized 
      to receive either dual therapy consisting of lansoprazole 30 mg daily and
      amoxicillin 500 mg three times a day for 14 days (LA, n = 33) or triple therapy
      using the LA regimen plus miconazole gel 100 mg three times a day for 14 days
      (LAM, n = 32). At least 8 weeks after the treatment, successful therapy was
      validated by the histological and microbiologic assessment. Adverse effects and
      drug adherence were monitored by direct questioning. RESULTS: The minimum
      inhibitory concentrations of miconazole ranged from 3.13 to 6.25 mg/L. H. pylori 
      was eradicated in 16 of 33 patients (48%, 95% CI = 31% to 67%) after LA therapy, 
      and 24 of 32 patients (75%, 95% CI = 59% to 91%) after LAM therapy (p < .03).
      There was no significant difference in the occurrence of adverse events between
      the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of miconazole gel to the LA regimen
      significantly improved the cure rate of H. pylori without an increase in adverse 
      effects.

TI  - Varying efficacy of Helicobacter pylori eradication regimens: cost effectiveness 
      study using a decision analysis model.
PG  - 1648-54
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine how small differences in the efficacy and cost of two
      antibiotic regimens to eradicate Helicobacter pylori can affect the overall cost 
      effectiveness of H pylori eradication in duodenal ulcer disease. DESIGN: A
      decision analysis to examine the cost effectiveness of eight H pylori eradication
      strategies for duodenal ulcer disease with and without 13C-urea breath testing to
      confirm eradication. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cumulative direct treatment costs per
      100 patients with duodenal ulcer disease who were positive for H pylori. RESULTS:
      In model 1 the strategy of omeprazole, clarithromycin, and metronidazole alone
      was the most cost effective of the four strategies assessed. The addition of the 
      13C-urea breath test and a second course of omeprazole, clarithromycin, and
      metronidazole achieved the highest eradication rate (97%) but was the most
      expensive (62.63 pounds per patient). The cost of each additional effective
      eradication was 589.00 pounds (incremental cost per case) when compared with the 
      cost of treating once only with omeprazole, clarithromycin, and metronidazole;
      equivalent to the cost of a patient receiving ranitidine for duodenal ulcer
      relapse for more than 15 years. Eradication strategies of omeprazole,
      amoxycillin, and metronidazole were less cost effective than omeprazole,
      clarithromycin, and metronidazole alone. In model 2 the addition of the 13C-urea 
      breath test after treatment, and maintenance treatment, increased the cost of all
      the strategies and reduced the cost advantage of omeprazole, clarithromycin, and 
      metronidazole alone. CONCLUSION: Small differences in efficacy can influence the 
      comparative cost effectiveness of strategies for eradicating H pylori. Of the
      strategies tested the most cost effective (omeprazole, clarithromycin, and
      metronidazole alone) was neither the least expensive (omeprazole, amoxycillin,
      and metronidazole alone) nor the most effective (omeprazole, clarithromycin, and 
      metronidazole with further treatment for patients found positive for H pylori on 
      13C-urea breath testing). Cost effectiveness should be an important part of
      choosing an eradication strategy for H pylori.

TI  - Proarrhythmia associated with cisapride in children.
PG  - 1053-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cisapride is a prokinetic agent that facilitates gastrointestinal
      motility and is widely used for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease 
      (GERD) in adults and children. However, reports of ventricular proarrhythmia have
      been noted in patients taking cisapride, particularly in conjunction with other
      drugs that may inhibit hepatic metabolism of cisapride via the cytochrome P450
      3A4 system. OBJECTIVE: We designed a prospective, blinded study to evaluate the
      effect of cisapride on ventricular repolarization in children with GERD. METHODS:
      We analyzed the electrocardiograms (ECGs) from 35 children (age 0.4 to 18 years, 
      mean 5.2 years) including measurement of the resting QT interval (QTc), JT
      interval (JTc), as well as QT and JT interlead dispersion markers. Data from
      these patients were compared with ECGs from a control group of 1000 normal
      children. RESULTS: Eleven (31%) of 35 patients receiving cisapride had a
      prolonged QTc (> or = 450 ms). The JTc was prolonged > or = 360 ms in 16 of 35
      patients (46%). The mean QTc in the cisapride group was 428 +/- 35 ms and mean
      JTc was 336 +/- 35 ms. An increased QT or JT dispersion (> 70 ms) was seen in
      only 3 of 35 children. Of the 11 children with QTc prolongation, 2 had documented
      torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia. Both patients were taking cisapride 
      concomitantly with a macrolide antibiotic. All other patients were treated with
      either cisapride alone or in conjunction with other GERD agents, such as
      ranitidine or omeprazole. CONCLUSIONS: Cisapride may cause prolongation of
      ventricular repolarization in children. There does not appear to be increased
      heterogeneity of repolarization or delayed depolarization in this small sample.
      The proarrhythmia may be exacerbated by medications that inhibit cytochrome P450 
      3A4 hepatic metabolism, overdosage, or mechanisms that result in decreased serum 
      clearance. ECG intervals should be monitored in children maintained on cisapride,
      particularly when used in combination with other known QT-prolonging medications.

TI  - Processing-independent analysis in the diagnosis of gastrinomas.
PG  - 379-85
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study evaluates whether a new analytic principle,
      processing-independent analysis (PIA), offers better specificity and sensitivity 
      than the conventional gastrin radioimmunoassay in the diagnosis of gastrinomas.
      METHODS: Plasma concentrations of alpha-amidated gastrins and the total
      progastrin product were measured with radioimmunoassay and with PIA,
      respectively, in 512 samples taken for gastrin measurement and in a selected
      group of gastrinoma patients (n=10). RESULTS: Among the 512 patients were 9 with 
      gastrinomas. In plasma from these patients the median degree of amidation (ratio 
      of alpha-amidated gastrins to total progastrin product) was 75% (range, 25-98%), 
      whereas in the other groups the medians varied from 41% to 86%. In the second
      group of gastrinoma patients all had a degree of amidation of less than 50%.
      CONCLUSIONS: In screening for gastrinomas PIA offered no diagnostic advantages in
      comparison with conventional gastrin radioimmunoassay. However, in selected
      patients who in spite of normal or slightly increased concentrations of amidated 
      gastrins were still suspected of having gastrinoma, additional measurement of the
      total progastrin product showed incomplete processing of progastrin and thus
      proved helpful in establishing the diagnosis.

TI  - Helicobacter biology--discovery.
PG  - 7-16
AB  - The presence of gastric spirochaetal organisms was first documented over a
      century ago. Though repeatedly reported in the medical literature, it was felt
      that these spiral bacteria were merely contaminants and the reports were
      generally ignored by the medical community. On 22 October 1982, at a meeting of
      the Royal Australian College of Physicians, successful culture of these
      'Campylobacterlike organisms' from gastric biopsy specimens was reported for the 
      first time. Moreover, it was shown that their presence was associated with
      gastritis and, possibly, with peptic ulceration. The subsequent discovery of the 
      pivotal role of Helicobacter pylori in a wide range of conditions has
      revolutionised our understanding of gastroduodenal diseases. Improvements in
      diagnostic and therapeutic options, combined with the gradual acceptance of the
      aetiological role of an infective agent in peptic disease, have led to a
      remarkable change in the management of gastroduodenal conditions in the past
      decade.

TI  - Recent findings in asthma likely to impact patient care.
PG  - 187-92
AB  - The management of asthma is becoming increasingly complex as more pharmacologic
      agents become available and we gain increased understanding of the pathogenetic
      processes of asthma and the risks for potentially irreversible airway remodeling 
      that might be increased by suboptimal management and interactions with
      concomitant disease states such as gastroesophageal reflux. Although physicians
      now have greater responsibility to make use of this increasing knowledge to
      provide more effective management for their asthma patients, they also have a
      greater opportunity to increase the overall quality of life of patients under
      their care.

TI  - One-week proton pump inhibitor-based triple therapy eradicates residual
      Helicobacter pylori after failed dual therapy.
PG  - 266-70
AB  - The purposes of this study were to assess the efficacy of a 1-week proton pump
      inhibitor (PPI)-based triple therapy after failure of dual therapy in
      Helicobacter pylori eradication, and to compare the effectiveness of
      clarithromycin and metronidazole in this regimen. Between January 1996 and March 
      1997, 67 patients with persistent H. pylori infection after a 2-week course of
      dual therapy (amoxicillin plus omeprazole) were enrolled. They were randomly
      assigned to receive amoxicillin (1000 mg twice daily) and omeprazole (20 mg twice
      daily) plus either metronidazole (500 mg twice daily) or clarithromycin (250 mg
      twice daily). Endoscopy was performed in each patient to assess the status of H. 
      pylori using the rapid urease test (CLOtest) and the histologic findings before
      dual therapy, after dual therapy, and after triple therapy. H. pylori isolates
      were tested for antibiotic resistance when triple therapy failed. The 1-week
      triple therapy was well tolerated in both groups with no adverse effects severe
      enough to cause withdrawal from the trial. Residual H. pylori was eradicated in
      94% (33/35) of patients in the clarithromycin group and 84% (27/32) in the
      metronidazole group; the difference was not statistically significant. All seven 
      patients in whom triple therapy failed were infected with metronidazole-resistant
      isolates and two also had clarithromycin-resistant isolates. This 1-week triple
      therapy is safe and effective in eradicating residual H. pylori after dual
      therapy failure. Failure of the rescue regimen is related to antimicrobial agent 
      resistance. Because of the high metronidazole resistance rate in Taiwan,
      clarithromycin appears to be more promising than metronidazole for the control of
      H. pylori.

TI  - Use of the Short Form-36 to detect the influence of upper gastrointestinal
      disease on self-reported health status.
PG  - 221-6
AB  - Patient-centred outcome measures such as the Short Form-36 (SF-36) have been
      developed to assess the impact of ill health and medical interventions on
      self-reported health status. The objective of the study was to assess the impact 
      of gastrointestinal disease upon health status as measured by the SF-36 physical 
      and mental health component scores (PCS and MCS) and to assess whether these
      component scores might be an appropriate outcome measure for use in clinical
      research in gastroenterology. The subjects were 364 patients aged between 18 and 
      64 years who had been prescribed proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) by general
      practitioners in Oxfordshire. The general practices participating identified
      patients who had been prescribed PPIs. The data were abstracted from the general 
      practice medical records of these patients concerning gastrointestinal diagnoses 
      and other prescribed medications. The patients were sent the SF-36 questionnaire 
      by post and the PCS and MCS scores were derived, which were adjusted for age and 
      sex and compared with the scores of the general population of the Oxford region. 
      Co-morbidity was assessed by the extent to which non-gastric medications were
      also used. The commonest diagnoses were oesophagitis/gastro-oesophageal reflux
      and indigestion. People with these diagnoses had significantly lower health
      status than the general population. Differences persisted when the results were
      controlled for the possible effects of co-morbidity. It was concluded that the
      SF-36 is sensitive to the impact of gastrointestinal disease on health status.

      different treatment strategies with omeprazole. International GORD Study Group.
PG  - 119-24
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of omeprazole in patients presenting with
      troublesome reflux symptoms. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, parallel-group,
      placebo-controlled comparison. SETTING: Primary care. SUBJECTS: Patients were
      recruited using a symptom-based questionnaire for diagnosis of gastro-oesophageal
      reflux disease. INTERVENTIONS: After endoscopy, patients without endoscopic
      oesophagitis were randomized to omeprazole 20 mg (Ome20), omeprazole 10 mg
      (Ome10) or placebo once daily for 4 weeks (n = 261) and those with oesophagitis
      (except circumferential/ulcerative) were randomized to receive either Ome20 or
      Ome10 once daily for 4 weeks (n = 277). Patients not symptom-free at 4 weeks
      received open treatment with Ome20 once daily for a further 4 weeks. Those
      symptom-free at 4-8 weeks were followed up for 6 months off treatment, to see
      whether their symptoms recurred. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Complete upper GI symptom 
      relief during week 4 on Ome20 or Ome10 in patients with or without endoscopic
      oesophagitis. RESULTS: Forty one percent of all patients on Ome20 and 35% on
      Ome10 reported complete relief from upper GI symptoms during week 4, whilst 73%
      of the patients on Ome20 and 62% on Ome10 obtained sufficient control. Complete
      relief during week 4 was reported by 19% of endoscopy-negative patients on
      placebo, and sufficient control by 35%. Endoscopic healing at 4 weeks occurred in
      76% of oesophagitis patients on Ome20 and in 56% on Ome10. After 6 months off
      treatment, 90% of patients with oesophagitis and 75% of endoscopy-negative
      patients reported symptomatic relapse. CONCLUSION: Both 10 mg and 20 mg of
      omeprazole gave effective relief of symptoms, although 20 mg gave superior
      healing in patients with oesophagitis. After cessation of treatment, symptomatic 
      relapse was rapid and frequent in both endoscopy-positive and endoscopy-negative

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and effect on caffeine metabolism of the proton pump inhibitors,
      omeprazole, lansoprazole, and pantoprazole.
PG  - 369-75
AB  - AIMS: To study the pharmacokinetics of three proton pump inhibitors, omeprazole, 
      lansoprazole, and pantoprazole, as well as any potential influence on CYP1A2
      activity (measured by means of rate of caffeine metabolism) of these compounds at
      single dose and repeated dose administration. METHODS: Fourteen healthy males,
      classified as 12 extensive metabolizers (EMs) and two poor metabolizers (PMs)
      according to the urinary S/R mephenytoin ratio, completed this open, randomized, 
      three-way cross-over study. In each of the three 7-day treatment periods either
      omeprazole (20 mg), lansoprazole (30 mg) or pantoprazole (40 mg) in
      therapeutically recommended doses was administered once daily, and the
      pharmacokinetics of the proton pump inhibitors as well as the rate of caffeine
      metabolism was measured on days 1 and 7. RESULTS: In the EMs there was an
      increase in AUC from day 1 to day 7 for omeprazole. In the PMs the AUC of both
      omeprazole and lansoprazole was unchanged during repeated dosing, while for
      pantoprazole there was a tendency to a slight decrease. The AUC at steady state
      was for all three proton pump inhibitors 5 fold higher in PMs compared with EMs, 
      indicating that the same proportion of the dose, irrespective of compound, is
      metabolized by CYP2C19. No induction of CYP1A2 was evident for any of the
      compounds in either EMs or PMs. CONCLUSIONS: The approximately 5 fold difference 
      in AUC between EMs and PMs indicates that approximately 80% of the dose for all
      three proton pump inhibitors is metabolized by the polymorphically expressed
      CYP2C19. None of the three proton pump inhibitors, administered in
      therapeutically recommended doses, is an inducer of CYP1A2--neither in PMs nor in
      EMs.

TI  - Triple versus dual therapy for eradicating Helicobacter pylori and preventing
      ulcer recurrence: a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study of lansoprazole, 
      clarithromycin, and/or amoxicillin in different dosing regimens.
PG  - 584-90
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The efficacy and safety of dual and triple therapies with a proton
      pump inhibitor and antibiotic(s) for therapy of Helicobacter pylori-associated
      duodenal ulcer disease have been compared using results from independent studies 
      using different methods and regimens, making interpretation difficult. In a
      large, double-blind, multicenter study conducted in the United States, we
      compared a triple therapy regimen with four dual therapy and one monotherapy
      regimens in the eradication of H. pylori and the prevention of ulcer recurrence. 
      METHODS: Patients with active duodenal ulcer disease or history of duodenal ulcer
      disease within the past year and H. pylori infection were randomized to receive
      one of six 14-day treatment regimens: lansoprazole 30 mg, clarithromycin 500 mg, 
      and amoxicillin 1 gm b.i.d.; lansoprazole 30 mg b.id. and either clarithromycin
      500 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d.; lansoprazole 30 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. with amoxicillin 1
      gm t.i.d.; or lansoprazole 30 mg t.i.d. alone. No additional acid suppression
      therapy followed eradication therapy. Primary efficacy endpoints were eradication
      of H. pylori and ulcer recurrence. RESULTS: Of 396 patients enrolled in the
      study, 352 met the entry criteria for duodenal ulcer status and H. pylori
      positivity. At 4-6 wk after the end of therapy, H. pylori was eradicated from 94%
      (44 of 47) of patients receiving lansoprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin
      triple therapy, 77% (39 of 51) of those receiving lansoprazole t.i.d./amoxicillin
      t.i.d., 75% (36 of 48) of those receiving lansoprazole b.i.d./clarithromycin
      t.i.d., 57% (28 of 49) of those receiving lansoprazole b.i.d./clarithromycin
      b.i.d., 53% (26 of 49) of those receiving lansoprazole b.i.d./amoxicillin t.i.d.,
      and 2% (1 of 53) of those receiving lansoprazole monotherapy (p < or = 0.05,
      triple therapy vs each dual therapy and each dual therapy vs monotherapy). Of
      those patients who were documented as free of ulcer at 4-6 wk after treatment,
      ulcers recurred within 6 months in 7% of patients receiving triple therapy, as
      compared with 13-23% of patients receiving dual therapy, and 69% of patients
      receiving lansoprazole monotherapy. Patients who were H. pylori negative at 4-6
      wk after treatment were less likely to have an ulcer recurrence than were
      patients who were H. pylori positive (11% [10 of 95] vs 47% [20 of 43],
      respectively, across treatment groups). For triple therapy and dual therapy, a
      similar proportion of patients reported a drug-related adverse event (23% vs
      17-33%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with active or a recent history
      of duodenal ulcer, a 14-day course of lansoprazole-based triple therapy without
      additional acid suppression therapy is highly effective in the eradication of H. 
      pylori and in preventing ulcer recurrence. Among the dual therapies, higher
      eradication rates occurred when lansoprazole (with amoxicillin) or clarithromycin
      (with lansoprazole) was administered t.i.d. vs b.i.d., but the rates were still
      significantly lower than with lansoprazole triple therapy with all three drugs
      administered b.i.d.

TI  - Bismuth-containing single-antibiotic 1-week triple therapy for Helicobacter
      pylori eradication.
PG  - 277-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although bismuth was both the first drug shown to alter the natural
      history of peptic ulcer disease and also a constituent of the first very
      effective eradication regimens, it has been excluded from the newer regimens,
      despite its safety and low cost, in favour of two antibiotics. AIM: To asses a
      novel 1-week regimen consisting of bismuth, clarithromycin and a proton pump
      inhibitor in routine clinical practice. METHODS: One hundred and three
      consecutive patients with peptic ulcer disease and antral biopsies containing
      Helicobacter pylori were given a 7-day course of treatment with bismuth
      (tripotassium dicitrato bismuthate chelate) 120 mg q.d.s., clarithromycin 500 mg 
      t.d.s. and lansoprazole 30 mg o.d. Completeness of eradication was assessed by a 
      l3C-urea breath test, in all except three patients, at least 4 months later.
      RESULTS: Of the 100 patients who were assessed in this open treatment study 84
      (84%; 95% CI: 77-91%) had a negative breath test. Minor side-effects were
      reported by 14% and more troublesome side-effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea,
      hallucinations, nasty taste and body pains) were reported by 10%. CONCLUSIONS: A 
      1-week course of triple therapy including bismuth, clarithromycin and a proton
      pump inhibitor is effective in routine clinical practice and is well tolerated.

TI  - Lansoprazole triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori--is 5 days enough?
PG  - 273-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Seven-day proton pump inhibitor triple therapy is currently the
      treatment of choice for Helicobacter pylori infection. It is unclear whether
      triple therapy for less than 7 days might preserve efficacy while at the same
      time improving patient acceptability and compliance. AIM: To evaluate the
      Helicobactericidal efficacy, ulcer healing capacity and patient acceptability of 
      a 5-day lansoprazole-based triple therapy regimen. METHODS: Sixty-nine
      consecutive patients with H. pylori-positive peptic ulcer received lansoprazole
      30 mg twice daily in combination with metronidazole 400 mg twice daily and
      clarithromycin 250 mg twice daily for 5 days. Ulcer healing medication was not
      continued after the 5-day regimen. H. pylori status was assessed before and at
      least 4 weeks after therapy by rapid urease test and histology. Adverse events
      and compliance were assessed by direct questioning. RESULTS: All 69 patients
      attended for repeat endoscopy and 63 were H. pylori-negative after therapy giving
      a cure rate of 91%, (95%, Cl: 85-98%). Of the 59 patients with active ulcers, 58 
      were healed at repeat endoscopy giving an ulcer healing rate of 98% (95% Cl:
      92-100%). All patients fully complied with therapy and mild adverse events,
      mainly gastrointestinal, were reported by 11 patients (16%). CONCLUSIONS:
      Five-day lansoprazole triple therapy is an effective regimen for H. pylori
      infection which combines a high cure rate and ulcer healing efficacy with the
      advantages of excellent patient acceptability and compliance.

TI  - Changes in Helicobacter pylori-induced gastritis in the antrum and corpus during 
      12 months of treatment with omeprazole and lansoprazole in patients with
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 247-53
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have shown that treatment with omeprazole leads to
      aggravation of Helicobacter pylori gastritis in the corpus. Whether this also
      applies to lansoprazole, and whether, in comparison with omeprazole, there are
      differences in therapy-induced gastritis parameter changes remains unclear.
      METHODS: In 111 patients infected with H. pylori and with gastro-oesophageal
      reflux disease we investigated the gastritis parameters in antral and corpus
      mucosa before and after 2, 6 and 12 months of treatment with 15 or 30 mg
      lansoprazole or 20 mg omeprazole/day. RESULTS: In all groups the different
      treatments had a similar effect: in both regions of the stomach, suppression or
      partial elimination of H. pylori was seen. However, improvement in the
      inflammation was observed only in the antrum, while in the corpus most gastritis 
      parameters worsened significantly. There was no increase in intestinal metaplasia
      or atrophy. CONCLUSION: In common with omeprazole, lansoprazole aggravates the
      gastritis parameters in the corpus but improves them in the antrum. Treatment
      with proton pump inhibitors does not result in any increase in the incidence of
      atrophy/intestinal metaplasia. However, as gastritis predominating in the corpus 
      seems to be associated with an elevated carcinogenic risk, consideration should
      be given to prophylactic H. pylori eradication therapy before initiating proton
      pump inhibitor treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We hypothesized that treatment of duodenal ulcer disease with
      antibiotic therapy directed toward Helicobacter pylori infection is more
      cost-effective than therapy with antisecretory agents. METHODS: A randomized,
      double-blind, multicenter clinical trial of adult patients with active duodenal
      ulcer and H. pylori infection was conducted. Patients were randomized to receive 
      500 mg of clarithromycin 3 times a day plus 40 mg of omeprazole daily for 14 days
      followed by 20 mg of omeprazole daily for an additional 14 days (group 1), 20 mg 
      of omeprazole daily for 28 days (group 2), or 150 mg of ranitidine hydrochloride 
      twice a day for 28 days (group 3). The use of ulcer-related health care resources
      was documented during monthly interviews for 1 year after the initial therapy.
      Clinical success was evaluated 4 to 6 weeks and 1 year after the end of therapy. 
      RESULTS: Of the 819 patients enrolled, 727 completed the study. Group 1 included 
      243 patients; group 2, 248 patients; and group 3, 236 patients. Patients in group
      1 used fewer ulcer-related health care resources during the 1 year after therapy 
      compared with groups 2 and 3 (comparisons are given as group 1 vs group 2 and
      group 1 vs group 3, respectively): the number of endoscopies performed, 28 vs 76 
      (P<.001) and vs 71 (P<.001); patients receiving drugs to treat an ulcer, 118 vs
      180 (P<.001) and vs 168 (P<.001); clinic visits, 83 vs 135 (P=.05) and vs 161
      (P<.001); hospitalizations, 0 vs 5 (P=.045) and vs 6 (P=.02); and length of
      hospital stay, 0 vs 24 days (P=.04) and vs 37 (P=.04). When ulcer-related costs
      were defined as the outcome variable in a multivariate linear regression
      analysis, therapy was determined to have a significant influence on costs (group 
      1 vs group 2, P<.001; group 1 vs group 3, P=.008). Clinical success rates at the 
      end of the study and cure of H. pylori infection were significantly greater in
      group 1 compared with groups 2 and 3 (P<.001). Therapy with clarithromycin plus
      omeprazole provided savings of $1.94 and $2.96 (compared with therapy with
      omeprazole and with ranitidine hydrochloride, respectively) per dollar spent
      within the first year after therapy. This incremental cost-benefit translates to 
      savings of $547 or $835 per patient in group 1 (compared with patients in group 2
      or group 3, respectively) during the first year after therapy. CONCLUSIONS:
      Combination therapy with clarithromycin and omeprazole resulted in significantly 
      fewer uses of ulcer-related health care resources than conventional antisecretory
      therapy during a 1-year follow-up and significant savings in associated costs
      during the same period. Patients who received clarithromycin plus omeprazole also
      showed a significantly improved clinical outcome compared with patients who
      received only omeprazole or ranitidine.

AB  - Since acceptance of the association between Helicobacter pylori and peptic ulcer 
      disease, eradication of H. pylori has become the standard of care in the
      treatment of peptic ulcer disease. Unfortunately, eradication therapy is no easy 
      task, especially when one is faced with a myriad of drug combinations with
      varying degrees of efficacy and tolerability. The following is a review of the
      literature regarding the drugs and drug combinations used to eradicate H. pylori 
      and their effectiveness both as single agents and in combination.

TI  - Predictive factors for rebleeding in patients with peptic ulcer bleeding after
      multipolar electrocoagulation: a retrospective analysis.
PG  - 113-6
AB  - The role of endoscopic therapy for peptic ulcer bleeding is well-documented.
      Nevertheless, rebleeding occurs in 10% to 30% of patients, and such patients are 
      at high risk for death without early retreatment or definitive surgery. The aim
      of our study was to predict which patients would rebleed within 1 month after
      successful multipolar electrocoagulation of 100 patients with active peptic ulcer
      bleeding (spurting, oozing, or nonbleeding visible vessel). We had achieved
      initial hemostasis in 97 patients and carried out univariate and multivariate
      analyses to predict which patients would rebleed. Rebleeding occurred within 1
      month in 17 (17.5%) patients. we correlated 20 clinical and endoscopic factors
      with rebleeding episodes. With univariate analysis, blood transfusion of 500 ml
      or more at entry (p < 0.0001) and use of cimetidine (p = 0.01) were statistically
      significant for rebleeding. With multivariate analysis, use of omeprazole was an 
      independent factor for preventing rebleeding (odds ratio, 7.68; 95% confidence
      interval, 1.642-35.929). We suggest that omeprazole may help to prevent
      rebleeding in patients who have had hemostasis with multipolar
      electrocoagulation.

      patients with dyspeptic complaints. A randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, clinical study without pretreatment diagnostic upper
      endoscopy.
PG  - 231-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Maastricht Consensus Report advises that, in Helicobacter
      pylori-positive patients after surgery for peptic ulcer disease, H. pylori should
      be eradicated. The aim of the present study was to investigate the symptomatic
      response of H. pylori eradication in previously vagotomized peptic ulcer patients
      with persistent dyspeptic complaints. METHODS: The study was performed as a
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Pretreatment diagnostic upper
      endoscopy was omitted. All the results were submitted to intention-to-treat and
      efficacy analyses. RESULTS: We could not find any differences between the two
      groups with regard to intensity or frequency of upper abdominal pain, nausea,
      heartburn, or other abdominal symptoms during the 12-month follow-up. The triple 
      therapy eradication rate was 88% at both 3- and 12-month controls. CONCLUSION:
      Vagotomized peptic ulcer patients with persistent dyspeptic complaints should
      undergo a diagnostic upper endoscopy to detect ulcer recurrence before H. pylori 
      eradication treatment is considered.

PG  - 153-67
AB  - Pregnant patients with symptomatic GERD should be managed aggressively with
      lifestyle modification and dietary changes. Antacids and antacids/alginic acids
      combination or sucralfate should be considered first-line medical therapy. If
      symptoms are not adequately relieved or complications develop, treatment with
      cimetidine or ranitidine should be considered; these H2 receptor antagonists are 
      preferred during pregnancy. Nizatidine cannot be recommended. Proton-pump
      inhibitors should be used with caution because little human experience is
      available. Despite this caveat, both proton-pump inhibitors are likely to be safe
      during pregnancy.

TI  - Accuracy of CLOtest after Helicobacter pylori therapy.
PG  - 250-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: The accuracy of rapid urease testing after Helicobacter pylori
      therapy has not been widely studied and might be diminished because of decreased 
      numbers of organisms. We assessed CLOtest results after therapy in two
      randomized, double-blind trials. METHODS: A total of 233 patients (in two
      separate studies) with true-positive baseline CLOtests (by histology or culture) 
      received 2 weeks of omeprazole/amoxicillin, omeprazole, or amoxicillin. In study 
      1, patients received an additional 2 weeks of omeprazole therapy (20 mg/day) or
      placebo; no additional therapy was given in study 2. Endoscopy was repeated 4
      weeks after completion of therapy in both studies. A diagnosis of cure required
      at least two negative endoscopic biopsy tests (histology, culture, CLOtest) and
      no positive tests. RESULTS: After therapy, 178 patients (76%) remained positive
      for H. pylori by histology and/or culture for both studies combined. Post-therapy
      CLOtest sensitivity was 86% and specificity was 95%. Sensitivity was poorer in
      patients after dual therapy than after monotherapy in both study 1 (68% vs. 89%; 
      p = 0.03) and study 2 (75% vs. 94%; p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: CLOtest sensitivity
      after therapy was lower than expected in our large group of patients with
      baseline true-positive CLOtests. In addition, sensitivity was lower after the use
      of more effective therapy (i.e., dual therapy as compared with monotherapy).
      Although most patients with unsuccessful treatment will be identified with the
      CLOtest alone, a negative result should not be taken as diagnostic of
      eradication.

TI  - Eradicating Helicobacter pylori reduces hypergastrinaemia during long-term
      omeprazole treatment.
PG  - 159-65
AB  - BACKGROUND: Both proton pump inhibitor drug treatment and Helicobacter pylori
      infection cause hypergastrinaemia in man. AIMS: To determine whether eradicating 
      H pylori is a means of reducing hypergastrinaemia during subsequent proton pump
      inhibitor treatment. METHODS: Patients with H pylori were randomised to treatment
      with either anti-H pylori or symptomatic treatment. One month later, all received
      four weeks treatment with omeprazole 40 mg/day for one month followed by 20
      mg/day for six months. Serum gastrin concentrations were measured before and
      following each treatment. RESULTS: In the patients randomised to anti-H pylori
      treatment, eradication of the infection lowered median fasting gastrin by 48% and
      meal stimulated gastrin by 46%. When gastrin concentrations one month following
      anti-H pylori/symptomatic treatment were used as baseline, omeprazole treatment
      produced a similar percentage increase in serum gastrin in the H pylori infected 
      and H pylori eradicated patients. Consequently, in the patients in which H pylori
      was not eradicated, median fasting gastrin concentration was 38 ng/l (range
      26-86) at initial presentation and increased to 64 ng/l (range 29-271) after
      seven months omeprazole, representing a median increase of 68% (p < 0.005). In
      contrast, in the patients randomised to H pylori eradication, median fasting
      gastrin at initial presentation was 54 ng/l (range 17-226) and was unchanged
      after seven months omeprazole at 38 ng/l (range 17-95). CONCLUSION: Eradicating H
      pylori is a means of reducing the rise in gastrin during subsequent long term
      omeprazole treatment. In view of the potential deleterious effects of
      hypergastrinaemia it may be appropriate to render patients H pylori negative
      prior to commencing long-term proton pump inhibitor treatment.

      arthritis. While controlling symptoms and improving quality of life, NSAID use is
      associated with gastroduodenal injury and a 2%-4% annual risk for symptomatic
      gastroduodenal ulceration, hemorrhage, and perforation. This requires clinicians 
      to balance the efficacy of NSAIDs against the potential risk of serious
      gastrointestinal events. Identification and stratification of risk can help guide
      the optimal approach for arthritis management of individual patients or large
      populations such as managed care organizations. NSAID-induced gastroenteropathy
      carries considerable economic consequences; 46% of arthritis costs are related to
      managing serious adverse events. It is reasonable to assume that these costs may 
      not be incurred if high-risk patients are recognized and optimally managed. Newer
      therapies with proven safety margins present an attractive option, especially for
      patients at higher risk. The single-tablet formulations of diclofenac and
      misoprostol (Arthrotec) offer an alternative in managing NSAID patients because
      of their inherent safety profile. Studies with diclofenac/misoprostol indicate
      its effectiveness in treating signs and symptoms of arthritis and in reducing the
      incidence of NSAID-induced gastroenteropathy. As such, this agent may provide
      improved medical and economic outcomes. This review discusses the clinical
      aspects of NSAID-induced gastroenteropathy, including available preventive
      therapies. Approaches to assessing patients' risk for developing complications,
      and the relationship of medical risk and economic outcomes, are also examined.
      Although not all patients require preventive therapy, patients with heightened
      risk may benefit clinically and economically from gastroprotective NSAIDs.
      Additional research or modeling may provide further insight into the economic
      implications of managing and preventing NSAID-induced gastroenteropathy.

TI  - A four-day low dose triple therapy regimen for the treatment of Helicobacter
      pylori infection.
PG  - 390-3
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The current guidelines recommend 1-wk triple therapy regimens for
      eradicating H. pylori infection. Until now, shorter regimens have scarcely been
      investigated. Azithromycin is a new generation macrolide antibiotic with unusual 
      and favorable pharmacokinetics, and seems to be a very promising agent for
      innovative anti-H. pylori regimens. We assessed the efficacy and tolerability of 
      a new 4-day low dose triple therapy in comparison with a well established 1-wk
      triple therapy in the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection. METHODS: One
      hundred-sixty consecutive patients with biopsy-proven H. pylori infection were
      randomized to receive lansoprazole 30 mg b.i.d. on days 1-4, azithromycin 500 mg 
      u.i.d. on days 2-4, and tinidazole 2000 mg u.i.d. on day 3 (LAT group), or 7 days
      of triple therapy of omeprazole 20 mg u.i.d., clarithromycin 250 mg b.i.d., and
      tinidazole 500 mg b.i.d. (OCT group). Patients with gastric or duodenal active
      ulcer received proton pump inhibitors for an additional 4 wk. H. pylori
      eradication was defined as negative of both rapid urease test and histology on
      biopsies taken from the gastric body and antrum at least 1 month after the end of
      treatment. RESULTS: Seven patients in the LAT group and four in the OCT group
      were lost to follow-up. No significant difference in either efficacy or
      tolerability was observed between the two regimens. Active ulcers healed in 97.8%
      of cases with LAT and in 100% of cases with OCT. The eradication rate was 80.8%
      in the LAT group and 85.5% in the OCT group, considering the per-protocol
      results, and 73.3% and 81.2%, respectively, considering the intention-to-treat
      results. Side effects occurred in one LAzT patient and in two OCT patients; they 
      were mild and did not interfere with compliance. CONCLUSION: The new proposed
      ultrashort triple therapy, including lansoprazole, low dose azithromycin for 3
      days, and a single dose of tinidazole, appears to be a very effective anti-H.
      pylori regimen, a simpler, cheaper, well-tolerated, and equally effective
      alternative to 1-wk triple therapy.

TI  - Rabeprazole.
PG  - 261-7; discussion 268
AB  - Rabeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor with antisecretory properties. In vitro
      animal experiments have indicated that the inhibition of the proton pump by
      rabeprazole is partially reversible. Rabeprazole has 2- to 10-fold greater
      antisecretory activity than omeprazole in vitro. However, it dissociates more
      readily from H+,K(+)-ATPase than omeprazole, resulting in a shorter duration of
      action. In comparative clinical trials rabeprazole was significantly more
      effective than placebo, famotidine or ranitidine and as effective as omeprazole
      in the treatment of patients with erosive or ulcerative gastro-oesophageal reflux
      disease or gastric or duodenal ulcers. Healing rates with rabeprazole were
      independent of Helicobacter pylori status. Rabeprazole in combination with either
      clarithromycin and metronidazole or clarithromycin and amoxicillin or amoxicillin
      and metronidazole or clarithromycin for 7 days produced eradication of H. pylori 
      in 100, 95, 90 and 63% of patients. The tolerability profile of rabeprazole 20mg 
      once daily was similar to that of famotidine 20mg twice daily, ranitidine 150mg 4
      times daily or omeprazole 20mg once daily in comparative trials. The adverse
      events reported with once daily administration of rabeprazole 20mg include
      malaise, nausea, diarrhoea, headache, dizziness and skin eruptions in 0.7 to 2.2%
      of patients.

TI  - Cost effectiveness of treatment for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in clinical
      practice: a clinical database analysis.
PG  - 13-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous evaluation of the cost effectiveness of antireflux
      medication used in gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) have been based on
      results obtained in controlled clinical trials. Unfortunately such an approach
      does not necessarily identify the therapeutic option which provides the greatest 
      benefit from available resources in real life situations. To make an informed
      choice requires a recognition that the costs and benefits of therapy in practice 
      may differ from those identified in trials. AIMS: To evaluate, based on a
      retrospective prescription database analysis, the cost effectiveness of
      alternative treatment options for patients with uncomplicated GORD. The analysis 
      assesses health service resource use during the first six months of treatment in 
      three groups of patients initially prescribed cisapride (CIS), ranitidine (RAN), 
      or omeprazole (OME). METHODS: The MediPlus UK database was used to identify all
      health care resources consumed by patients in the three treatment groups during
      their first six months of treatment. Patients with more complicated GORD, as
      indicated by initial referral to a specialist or outpatient hospital visit (<
      13%), were excluded from the analysis. RESULTS: The average cost per patient for 
      the initial six months of treatment for CIS, RAN, and OME based therapies was 136
      Pounds, 177 Pounds, 189 Pounds per patient, respectively. A major element
      underlying this cost variation was the acquisition cost and quantity of
      antireflux medication required by patients. The average number of one month
      equivalent prescriptions consumed during this six month period was 1.85 (CIS),
      2.57 (RAN), and 2.96 (OME) with associated costs of 49 Pounds (CIS), 67 Pounds
      (RAN), and 105 Pounds (OME). Antacid and alginate/antacid use was higher in the
      CIS and RAN groups (about 1.0 antacid prescription per patient versus 0.4 for
      OME), but their contribution to the total cost per patient was less than 2%. The 
      number of general practitioner consultations over the six month period for each
      treatment group was 2.4 (CIS), 2.9 (RAN), and 2.6 (OME) with associated costs of 
      60.31 Pounds (CIS), 73.06 Pounds (RAN), and 65.52 Pounds (OME). The average
      number of non-drug interventions (referrals, outpatient visits, endoscopies,
      barium meals, or x rays) was 0.34 in the RAN group compared with less than 0.2 in
      the CIS and OME groups. The costs associated with such interventions were 23.80
      Pounds (RAN), 9.60 Pounds (CIS), and 11.10 Pounds (OME) per patient. CONCLUSION: 
      The data indicate that the "step up" approach, starting with a prokinetic or H2
      receptor antagonist, represents the most cost effective initial therapeutic
      strategy for a primary care physician to adopt when faced with a patient with
      first diagnosis of uncomplicated GORD.

TI  - Does Helicobacter pylori eradication depend on the period of amoxicillin
      treatment? A retrospective study.
PG  - 23-6
AB  - In this study, the effect of different periods of amoxicillin (AMPC) treatment on
      the eradication rate of Helicobacter pylori in 173 patients with peptic ulcers
      (gastric ulcer, 109; duodenal ulcer, 64) was investigated. AMPC (1.5 g/day) was
      administered for 2, 4, or 6 weeks with omeprazole (20mg/day) and plaunotol
      (240mg/day), a mucoprotective drug, for 8 weeks. The H. pylori eradication rate
      was 46.7% for 2 weeks' treatment, 83.4% for 4 weeks' treatment, and 100% for 6
      weeks' treatment. The eradication rate had a good correlation with the period of 
      AMPC treatment. The healing rates of peptic ulcer at 4 and 8 weeks were 93.3% and
      100%, respectively, in the 2-week group, 98.0% and 99.3% in the 4-week group, and
      85.7% and 100% in the 6-week group. The recurrence rate of gastric and duodenal
      ulcers was 3.5% and 0% respectively, in the patients in whom H. pylori was
      eradicated and 30.0% and 40%, respectively, in the patients in whom H. pylori was
      not eradicated for 12 months after the H. pylori eradication treatment. Adverse
      effects of this regimen were observed in 5 (2.9%) of the 173 patients. Diarrhea
      was observed in 3 patients and eruption in 2. These adverse effects disappeared
      within a few days after only AMPC was withdrawn. Therefore, these may be caused
      by AMPC. The eradication rate of H. pylori depends on the period of AMPC
      treatment. This regiment, AMPC (1.5g/day) + omeprazole (20mg/day) + plaunotol
      (240mg/day), is safe and well tolerated for eradication of H. pylori.

      they received omeprazole 40 mg, and on day 8 they received mexiletine 200 mg and 
      omeprazole 40 mg concomitantly. Serum concentrations of mexiletine were
      determined just before drug administration and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24
      hours on day 1 and day 8. RESULTS: No differences in mexiletine concentrations
      were observed between the two phases of the study. The mean AUCs after
      administration of mexiletine alone and in combination with omeprazole 40 mg/d
      were 6.26 and 6.20 ng.h/L, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that
      omeprazole does not affect mexiletine metabolism.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori infection--current status in Singapore.
PG  - 637-41
AB  - Helicobacter pylori infection is a common infection in Singapore affecting about 
      31% of the population. The seroprevalence of H. pylori infection increases with
      age from 3% in children below 5 years to 71% in adults above 65 years. Amongst
      the races, Chinese and Indians had similar rates of seropositivity (34.3% and
      33.6%) while in Malays it was significantly lower (13.7%; P < 0.05). H. pylori
      infection is associated with peptic ulcer disease (both duodenal and gastric
      ulcer) as well as gastric cancer [adenocarcinoma, early gastric cancer and
      mucosa-associated lymphoma of T cell type (MALT) lymphoma]. Its role in non-ulcer
      dyspepsia is controversial. H. pylori was found in 31% of non-ulcer dyspepsia
      patients in Singapore compared with 28% in normal healthy controls. Gastric
      emptying test using indigestible solids shows that gastroparesis per se, H.
      pylori in the presence of gastroparesis (but not H. pylori alone) are related to 
      dyspeptic symptom. H. pylori plays a synergistic role with non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in causing bleeding in gastric ulcer but not in 
      duodenal ulcer. Invasive and non-invasive methods are available for diagnosis of 
      H. pylori and should be used to establish the aetiology of gastro-duodenal
      disease. Currently two groups of therapeutic regimes with eradication rates of
      90% are available: bismuth containing regimes and proton-pump inhibitors based
      regimes. Triple therapy for one week (using three drugs effective against H.
      pylori) is currently the treatment of choice.

TI  - Double-blind trial of omeprazole and amoxicillin in the cure of Helicobacter
      pylori infection in gastric ulcer patients. The Ulcer Study Group, Germany.
PG  - 49-54
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our aim was to investigate the efficacy of omeprazole and amoxicillin
      in curing Helicobacter pylori infection in gastric ulcer patients. METHODS: In a 
      double-blind trial 185 H. pylori-positive gastric ulcer patients were
      prospectively randomized to receive 40 mg omeprazole twice daily and either 750
      mg amoxicillin three times daily or 750 mg amoxicillin placebo three times daily 
      on days 1-14, followed by 20 mg omeprazole daily on days 15-56. RESULTS:
      Twenty-seven patients were excluded because of lack of compliance or missed
      follow-up examinations; one patient receiving amoxicillin discontinued treatment 
      owing to side effects. On an intention-to-treat basis, omeprazole/amoxicillin led
      to cure of H. pylori infection in 67.1% (47 of 70) of patients not using
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)/aspirin (ASA) and in 46.7% (14 of 
      30) of those taking NSAIDs/ASA (P < 0.05). With the omeprazole/placebo regimen,
      H. pylori infection was cured in 8.8% (no NSAIDs), and 0% (NSAIDs). CONCLUSIONS: 
      The use of NSAIDs/ASA may limit the efficacy of omeprazole/amoxicillin in curing 
      H. pylori infection in gastric ulcer patients.

TI  - Prevention of gastric ulcer recurrence with tetraprenylacetone.
PG  - 44-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of cytoprotective agents in the treatment of ulcers remains 
      unclear. In the present study we investigated the effect of tetraprenylacetone
      (TAP), a cytoprotective agent, on healing and recurrence of gastric ulcers
      infected with Helicobacter pylori and on the mucosal microvascular architecture
      of healed gastric ulcers. PATIENTS: Ninety-five gastric ulcer patients with H.
      pylori infection were studied. METHODS: Gastric ulcer patients with H. pylori
      infection received 20 mg omeprazole (44 patients) or 20 mg omeprazole and 150 mg 
      TAP (46 patients) in random fashion. Ulcer healing was assessed with endoscopy 12
      weeks after the start of treatment. The patients with healed ulcer were followed 
      up for another 12 months without further therapy. During endoscopic examination
      at week 12, biopsy specimens were obtained from healed gastric ulcers, and the
      gastric mucosal microvascular architecture of the biopsy specimens was observed
      by means of the alkaline phosphatase staining method. RESULTS: The rate of ulcer 
      healing at week 12 was similar in patients treated with omeprazole with and
      without TAP. However, at or within 12 months of the start of follow-up
      observation, ulcers recurred significantly less frequently in patients treated
      with both omeprazole and TAP than in those treated with omeprazole alone.
      Alkaline phosphatase staining methods showed that the mucosal microvascular
      architecture improved significantly more frequently in healed gastric ulcers that
      had been treated with both omeprazole and TAP than in those treated with
      omeprazole alone. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with TAP plus omeprazole significantly
      decreases ulcer recurrence through TAP's improved mucosal restoration.

TI  - One-week omeprazole treatment in the diagnosis of gastro-oesophageal reflux
      disease.
PG  - 15-20
AB  - BACKGROUND: Symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux are common, and currently
      available methods for diagnosing reflux disease are expensive and uncomfortable
      for the patient. The diagnostic value of a treatment test with omeprazole is
      unclear. METHODS: Patients with dyspepsia including heartburn admitted for upper 
      gastrointestinal endoscopy were studied in a prospective, randomized,
      double-blind Scandinavian multicentre study. Before entry 188 patients were
      enrolled, and 160 were randomized to 1-week treatment with 20 mg omeprazole twice
      daily or placebo. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) was defined as reflux 
      oesophagitis Savary-Miller grades II-III at endoscopy or pH < 4 exceeding 4% of
      the total time at 24-h oesophageal pH-monitoring and was found in 135 patients.
      The treatment test was considered positive when the patient's symptoms improved
      during the treatment week compared with the pretreatment day. RESULTS: The
      sensitivity in diagnosing reflux disease was 71-81% with omeprazole as a
      diagnostic test, compared with 36-47% for placebo during treatment days 3-7. The 
      specificity was similar for the two treatment arms during the first days of the
      study. During the end of the week a larger proportion of the patients with normal
      endoscopy and pH test responded to omeprazole treatment, giving omeprazole lower 
      specificity than placebo. The investigators' overall evaluation of whether the
      patient was a responder to the test had a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of
      55% in the omeprazole-treated patients. The corresponding figures in the placebo 
      group were 17% and 92%, respectively. CONCLUSION: One week of omeprazole
      treatment is a simple diagnostic test with a fairly high sensitivity. The
      specificity is poor owing to the placebo effect and to the lack of a gold
      standard in diagnosing reflux disease.

TI  - One-week therapy with omeprazole, clarithromycin and metronidazole or ornidazole,
      followed by 3 weeks' treatment with omeprazole, eradicates Helicobacter pylori
      equally and heals duodenal ulcer.
PG  - 1185-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate and compare the efficacy of 'triple' 1-week
      regimens--omeprazole, clarithromycin and a nitroimidazole (metronidazole or
      ornidazole)--followed by omeprazole, for an additional 3 weeks, on Helicobacter
      pylori eradication and duodenal ulcer (DU) healing, in a country with a high
      resistance rate of H. pylori to metronidazole. DESIGN: Open, prospective,
      two-centre study. METHODS: Patients older than 18 years with active duodenal
      ulcer (DU), diagnosed by endoscopy and found to be infected with H. pylori
      (modified Giemsa stain and CLO test, Delta West, Australia), were included in the
      study. Three triple-drug regimens, given for 7 days, were used. (1) omeprazole
      (Om) 20 mg once a day, plus clarithromycin (Cl) 250 mg twice daily, plus
      ornidazole (Or) 500 mg twice daily (O1COr); (2) Om 20 mg twice daily, plus Cl 250
      mg twice daily, plus Or 500 mg twice daily (OCOr); and (3) Om 20 mg twice daily, 
      plus Cl 250 mg twice daily, plus metronidazole (M) 500 mg twice daily (OCM). Two 
      hundred and three consecutive H. pylori-positive patients were included in the
      study, randomly assigned as follows: 50 patients (group A1: 32 men, 18 women, age
      23-77 years) on O1COr; 47 patients (group A2: 29 men, 18 women, age 27-77 years) 
      on OCOr; and 106 (group B: 71 men, 35 women, age 18-83 years) on OCM. Ulcer
      healing and H. pylori eradication were assessed endoscopically, 8-9 weeks after
      the start of treatment. H. pylori was considered eradicated if both histology and
      rapid urease test (six biopsies, antrum-body) were negative. RESULTS: Eleven
      patients were lost to follow-up; 192 patients were analysed. Group A1: 48; group 
      A2: 44; group B: 100. 'Per-protocol' analysis: H. pylori eradication, 90-93% (P =
      0.901); ulcer healing, 90-98% (P = 0.300). 'Intention to treat' analysis: H.
      pylori eradication, 85-88% (P = 0.887); ulcer healing, 86-91% (P = 0.657).
      Compliance was excellent, no serious side effects were observed and no patients
      withdrew due to side effects. CONCLUSIONS: No differences were observed in the H.
      pylori eradication and the healing rate among the groups. It seems that twice
      daily omeprazole is no better than single daily dosage and that ornidazole is as 
      effective as metronidazole. In addition, in the studied population which is
      believed to have a high prevalence of metronidazole resistance, all the regimens 
      used were effective.

PG  - 238-43
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We compared the efficacy of three different doses of the proton pump
      inhibitor lansoprazole in the management of reflux esophagitis. METHODS: Two
      hundred ninety-two patients with endoscopically confirmed reflux esophagitis were
      enrolled in a double-blind, multicenter study and were randomized to lansoprazole
      15, 30, or 60 mg or placebo administered once daily for 8 wk. RESULTS: Healing
      rates after 4 wk of lansoprazole 15, 30, and 60 mg/d were 67.6%, 81.3%, and
      80.6%, respectively. These were all significantly superior (p < 0.001) to
      placebo, which produced endoscopic healing in only 32.8% of the patients after 4 
      wk. The 4-wk healing rates with lansoprazole 30 or 60 mg were significantly
      higher than that with lansoprazole 15 mg (p < 0.05), confirming a dose-response
      effect. Cumulative healing rates after 8 wk of treatment were 52.5% with placebo 
      and 90.0%, 95.4%, and 94.4% with lansoprazole 15, 30, and 60 mg, respectively (p 
      < 0.001 for all doses of lansoprazole vs placebo). Lansoprazole was also
      significantly superior to placebo in relieving symptoms in patients with reflux
      esophagitis. Lansoprazole was well tolerated, and no serious treatment-related
      adverse events were encountered. Up to 3 months after discontinuation of
      treatment, all lansoprazole-treated groups had more patients free of endoscopic
      evidence of esophagitis than the group treated with placebo. CONCLUSIONS:
      Lansoprazole was safe and effective for the treatment of reflux esophagitis in
      this trial. This study indicates that the optimum daily dose of lansoprazole for 
      reflux esophagitis is 30 mg.

TI  - Proton-pump inhibitors for gastric acid-related disease.
PG  - 27-34
AB  - Proton-pump inhibitors are the most effective drugs introduced to date for
      suppressing gastric acid production. Although they are used to treat the same
      conditions as histamine type-2 receptor antagonists, they differ from the latter 
      drugs in how they inhibit acid production, and in how they should be given.
      Initial concerns over potential ill effects of hypergastrinemia due to long-term 
      acid suppression with proton-pump inhibitors have been unfounded.

TI  - One week triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori: a multicentre comparative study.
      Lansoprazole Helicobacter Study Group.
PG  - 735-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Eradication of Helicobacter pylori cures and prevents the relapse of 
      duodenal ulceration and also results in histological resolution of chronic active
      gastritis. AIM: To compare four treatment regimens lasting seven days of a proton
      pump inhibitor and two antibiotics in the eradication of H pylori. PATIENTS: Men 
      or women with H pylori positive duodenal ulceration or gastritis, or both.
      METHODS: A single blind, prospectively randomised, parallel group, comparative,
      multicentre study. After a positive CLO test, patients underwent histology, H
      pylori culture, and a 13C urea breath test to confirm H pylori status. Treatment 
      with one of four regimens: LAC, LAM, LCM, or OAM, where L is 30 mg of
      lansoprazole twice daily, A is 1 g of amoxycillin twice daily, M is 400 mg of
      metronidazole twice daily, C is 250 mg of clarithromycin twice daily, and O is 20
      mg of omeprazole twice daily, was assigned randomly. A follow up breath test was 
      done at least 28 days after completing treatment. RESULTS: H pylori eradication
      (intention to treat) was 104/121 (86.0%) with LAC, 87/131 (66.4%) with LAM,
      103/118 (87.3%) with LCM, and 94/126 (74.6%) with OAM. There was a significant
      difference (p < 0.001) in the proportion of patients in whom eradication was
      successful between LAC and LCM when compared with LAM, but no significant
      difference (p = 0.15) between LAM and OAM. Metronidazole resistance before
      treatment was identified as a significant prognostic factor with regard to
      eradication of H pylori. The regimens which contained metronidazole were
      significantly less effective than those without metronidazole in the presence of 
      pretreatment resistant H pylori. There was no difference among the treatment
      groups with regard to the incidence and severity of adverse events reported.
      CONCLUSIONS: All four treatment regimens were safe and effective in eradicating H
      pylori in the patient population studied. LAC was the most efficacious treatment 
      in patients with pretreatment metronidazole resistant H pylori, and was
      significantly better than LAM and OAM in this group of patients.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics during treatment with the omeprazole 20 mg 
      enteric-coated tablet and 20 mg capsule in asymptomatic duodenal ulcer patients.
PG  - 657-60
AB  - This study compared the 24 h intragastric pH profile and bioavailability at
      repeated dosing conditions of the omeprazole 20 mg enteric-coated tablet versus
      the 20 mg capsule. Forty duodenal ulcer patients in asymptomatic remission
      completed this randomized open two-way crossover study. Omeprazole 20 mg tablets 
      or capsules were administered for seven days in each period. A 24 h pH recording 
      was performed before the start of treatment and on day 7 of each treatment
      period. Plasma concentrations of omeprazole were determined 24 h after the dose. 
      The treatment periods were separated by two to four weeks. The difference in
      percentage of time with pH of at least 3 was less than 16% in favour of the
      tablet (not significant). The estimated mean area under the plasma
      concentration-time curve as well as the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) for
      omeprazole were 18% and 41% higher, respectively, for the tablet versus the
      capsule, with the latter percentage being statistically significant. The time to 
      reach Cmax (tmax) with the tablet was, on average, about 0.5 h longer than to
      reach the tmax of the capsule. This study indicates that the enteric-coated
      tablet formulation of omeprazole is biodynamically equivalent to the capsule
      regarding their effects on intragastric pH during repeated dosing.

TI  - Relationship between the efficacy of amoxicillin and intragastric pH for the
      treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection.
PG  - 144-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Proton pump inhibitors are reported to enhance the efficacy of
      antibiotics in the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection. An elevated
      intragastric pH is considered to be an important factor for this increased
      antimicrobial efficacy. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of
      different doses of lansoprazole on 24-hour intragastric pH and to correlate the
      effect of amoxicillin on the cure rate for H. pylori infection with the
      intragastric pH obtained during lansoprazole treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS:
      Thirty-six duodenal ulcer patients who tested positively for H. pylori as
      assessed by a rapid urease test, culture, and histological evaluation were
      allocated randomly to dual treatment with amoxicillin, 3 gm/day, and lansoprazole
      in different doses ranging between 30 and 180 mg/day for 2 weeks. A 24-hour
      intragastric pH measurement was taken in all patients on the fifth day of
      treatment. H. pylori status was determined by culture and histological workup 6
      weeks after cessation of the amoxicillin-lansoprazole medication. RESULTS: The H.
      pylori infection was treated successfully in 19 of 32 patients who completed the 
      dual therapy (per protocol, 59.4%). The median intragastric pH in patients who
      were treated successfully was 4.4 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.7-4.7), as
      compared to 4.0 (95% CI = 3.5-4.5) in patients who were not treated successfully 
      (p = .47, Wilcoxon's rank sum test). The median percentage of time that the
      intragastric pH exceeded 4 was not different in the two groups (p = .77).
      Administration of lansoprazole in doses exceeding 30 mg induced only a moderate
      additional increase in intragastric pH. CONCLUSIONS: Profound inhibition of
      gastric acid secretion seems not to be necessary to improve the effect of
      amoxicillin on the cure rate for H. pylori infection in patients with duodenal
      ulcers.

TI  - Sucralfate as an alternative to bismuth in quadruple therapy for Helicobacter
      pylori eradication.
PG  - 140-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are persuasive arguments for treating all patients with
      Helicobacter pylori-associated peptic ulcer disease. However, the choice of
      therapeutic regimen remains problematical. Bismuth triple therapy produces
      greater than 80% cure of H. pylori infection, whereas omeprazole and bismuth
      quadruple therapy has produced cure rates in excess of 90%. Colloidal bismuth is 
      not available in many countries, hence limiting the use of bismuth-based
      therapeutic regimens. We substituted widely available sucralfate for bismuth in a
      quadruple-therapy regimen. METHOD: We studied 223 consecutive patients with
      gastritis or peptic ulcer disease in whom H. pyori infection was confirmed by
      CLOtest (Delta West Ltd., Bentley, WA, Australia) or histological assessment.
      Successful therapy was validated by the 14C urea breath test 4 to 6 weeks after
      therapy. Omeprazole, 20 mg was given twice daily for 10 days. After 3 days of
      omeprazole sucralfate (1 gm qid), tetracycline (500 mg qid) and metronidazole
      (400 mg tid) were added for 7 days. RESULTS: Therapy was successful in 194 of 223
      patients (87%). Compliance was excellent, with only two patients being unable to 
      tolerate therapy. Side effects were minimal and included nausea, vomiting,
      headache, and vaginal moniliasis. At 6 months' follow-up, 10 of 210 patients (5%)
      who were previously documented as "cured" had a positive breath test.
      CONCLUSIONS: The wide availability of sucralfate in many countries makes it a
      possible alternative to bismuth for use in proton pump quadruple-therapy
      regimens, achieving a reasonable cure rate for H. pylori infection.

TI  - Randomized clinical trial comparing two one-week triple-therapy regimens for the 
      eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection and duodenal ulcer healing.
PG  - 35-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: One-week triple therapy has been shown to be effective in Helicobacter
      pylori eradication and duodenal ulcer healing. However, the optimal therapeutic
      combination has not yet been identified. Bismuth-containing regimens have the
      advantage of requiring only one antibiotic. It has been suggested that high doses
      of omeprazole improve the bactericidal efficacy of antimicrobial regimens against
      H. pylori. We evaluated the efficacy of two 1-wk triple-therapy regimens for H.
      pylori eradication and duodenal ulcer healing. METHODS: On an intention-to-treat 
      basis, 182 patients with H. pylori-associated duodenal ulcer were randomized.
      Group OCB patients (n = 91) were given omeprazole 40 mg b.i.d., clarithromycin
      500 mg b.i.d., and colloidal bismuth subcitrate 120 mg q.i.d. for 7 days. Group
      OCA patients (n = 91) were treated with omeprazole and clarithromycin at the same
      doses plus amoxicillin 1 g b.i.d., also for 7 days. Endoscopies were performed at
      entry and at 4 wk after the end of treatment. The presence of H. pylori was
      assessed by urease test, histology, Gram stain, and culture. No patient received 
      follow-up treatment. RESULTS: H. pylori eradication rates achieved in the OCB and
      OCA groups were similar whether by intention-to-treat (82.4% vs 88.9% ;p = 0.21) 
      or per protocol analysis (83.3% vs 89.9%; p = 0.19). Duodenal ulcer healing rates
      also were the same for OCB and OCA in intention-to treat (91.2% vs 91.1%) and per
      protocol analysis (92.2% vs 92.1%), respectively (p = 0.98). CONCLUSIONS: High
      rates of H. pylori eradication and duodenal ulcer healing were obtained with both
      short-treatment regimens, which were safe and well-tolerated. Colloidal bismuth
      subcitrate seems to be a good alternative to amoxicillin in the triple-therapy
      combination with omeprazole and clarithromycin. The omeprazole dose does not seem
      to play a major role in H. pylori eradication in these therapeutic combinations.

TI  - Incidence of infectious complications associated with the use of
      histamine2-receptor antagonists in critically ill trauma patients.
PG  - 120-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of histamine2 (H2)-receptor antagonist use on 
      the occurrence of infectious complications in severely injured patients. SUMMARY 
      BACKGROUND DATA: Some previous studies suggest an increased risk of nosocomial
      pneumonia associated with the use of H2-receptor blockade in critically ill
      patients, but other investigations suggest an immune-enhancing effect of
      H2-receptor antagonists. The purpose of this study was to determine whether
      H2-receptor antagonist use affects the overall incidence of infectious
      complications. METHODS: Patients enrolled in a randomized trial comparing
      ranitidine with sucralfate for gastritis prophylaxis were examined for all
      infectious complications during their hospitalization. Data on the occurrence of 
      pneumonia were prospectively collected, and other infectious complications were
      retrospectively obtained from the medical record. The relative risk of infectious
      complications associated with ranitidine use and total infectious complications
      were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 98 patients included, the charts of 96 were available 
      for review. Sucralfate was given to 47, and 49 received ranitidine. Demographic
      factors were similar between the groups. Ranitidine use was associated with a
      1.5-fold increased risk of developing any infectious complication (37 of 47 vs.
      26 of 47; 95% confidence interval, 1.04 to 2.28). Infectious complications
      totaled 128 in the ranitidine-treated group and 50 in the sucralfate-treated
      group (p = 0.0014). These differences remained after excluding catheter-related
      infections (p = 0.0042) and secondary bacteremia (p = 0.0046). CONCLUSIONS:
      Ranitidine use in severely injured patients is associated with a statistically
      significant increase in overall infectious complications when compared with
      sucralfate. These results indicate that ranitidine should be avoided where
      possible in the prophylaxis of stress gastritis.

TI  - Treatment of Barrett's esophagus by endoscopic laser ablation and antireflux
      surgery.
PG  - 40-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The regeneration of intestinal metaplasia by squamous epithelium in 17
      patients with Barrett's esophagus after endoscopic laser ablation in a
      reflux-free environment after successful antireflux surgery was prospectively
      examined. METHODS: All patients had antireflux surgery, and healing of reflux was
      verified at postoperative endoscopy and 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring.
      Thereafter, in 11 patients, the whole Barrett's epithelium was ablated using
      endoscopic Nd-YAG laser energy in 1 to 8 sessions (mean, 4). The needed energy
      was 965 to 11,173 joules (mean 4709), or about 1000 joules per centimeter of
      Barrett's esophagus. Six patients had no laser ablation but were treated by
      antireflux surgery and served as a control group. RESULTS: In all laser-treated
      patients, the regenerated epithelium was histologically of squamous type in the
      tubular esophagus, but two patients still had intestinal metaplasia in the
      gastric cardia. In controls, the length of Barrett's esophagus and intestinal
      metaplasia remained unchanged. The length of follow-up was 26 months after the
      last laser session and 21 months in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The
      regenerated esophageal epithelium arising after laser ablation in reflux-free
      environment surgery is of squamous type. This treatment may have a role in
      preventing the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma arising in Barrett's
      esophagus.

TI  - A prospective randomized comparative trial showing that omeprazole prevents
      rebleeding in patients with bleeding peptic ulcer after successful endoscopic
      therapy.
PG  - 54-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: A blood clot in a peptic ulcer is unstable in a low pH environment.
      The use of omeprazole may prevent rebleeding by elevating intragastric pH in
      patients with bleeding peptic ulcer after hemostasis has been achieved.
      OBJECTIVES: To assess the influence of using omeprazole and cimetidine on 24-hour
      intragastric pH and to determine their ability to prevent rebleeding after having
      achieved initial hemostasis in patients with active bleeding or nonbleeding
      visible vessels. METHODS: One hundred patients with bleeding peptic ulcers who
      had obtained initial hemostasis were enrolled in this randomized comparative
      trial. In the cimetidine group (n = 50), a 300-mg intravenous bolus of cimetidine
      was given, followed by a 1200-mg continuous infusion daily for 3 days.
      Thereafter, 400 mg of cimetidine was given orally twice daily for 2 months. In
      the omeprazole group (n = 50), a 40-mg intravenous bolus of omeprazole was given,
      followed by 160 mg of continuous infusion daily for 3 days. Thereafter, 20 mg of 
      omeprazole was given orally once daily for 2 months. A pH meter was inserted in
      each patient's fundus under fluoroscopic guidance after the intravenous bolus of 
      cimetidine or omeprazole had been administered. RESULTS: The stigmata of recent
      hemorrhage before endoscopic therapy in the omeprazole and cimetidine groups
      were, respectively, spurting (9 vs 12), oozing (4 vs 9), and nonbleeding visible 
      vessel (37 vs 29) (P > .05). The duration of intragastric pH higher than 6.0 was 
      longer in the omeprazole group (mean [+/- SD], 84.4% +/- 22.9%) than that of the 
      cimetidine group (mean [+/- SD], 53.5% +/- 32.3%) (P < .001). Rebleeding occurred
      in 2 patients (4%) in the omeprazole group and in 12 patients (24%) in the
      cimetidine group by day 14 after enrollment (P = .004). There was a tendency for 
      patients in the omeprazole group to require less blood transfusion (median, 0 mL;
      range, 0-2500 mL) than those in the cimetidine group (median, 0 mL; range, 0-5000
      mL) (P = .08). The hospital stay and number of operations and mortality rate were
      similar between both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The use of omeprazole is more effective
      than cimetidine in increasing intragastric pH and reducing rebleeding episodes in
      patients with bleeding peptic ulcers after successful endoscopic therapy. This
      suggests that omeprazole should be used routinely after successful endoscopic
      therapy.

TI  - One week triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori: does high-dose clarithromycin
      confer additional benefit?
PG  - 199-204
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clarithromycin, a new acid stable macrolide antibiotic with proven
      efficacy against Helicobacter pylori, has been widely incorporated into
      eradication regimens but its optimal dosage schedule remains controversial. The
      standard dose of clarithromycin is 250 mg twice daily. METHODS: In a prospective 
      study designed to evaluate the helicobactericidal efficacy, patient
      acceptability, and ulcer healing efficacy of a triple therapy regimen
      incorporating high dose clarithromycin, 100 consecutive patients with H.
      pylori-positive peptic ulcer received omeprazole 20 mg twice daily in combination
      with metronidazole 400 mg twice daily and clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily for
      seven days. H. pylori status was assessed before and at least 4 weeks after
      therapy by rapid urease test and histology. Adverse events and compliance were
      assessed by direct questioning. RESULTS: Only two patients failed to attend for
      repeat endoscopy, leaving 98 evaluable patients. Of these, 94 were H.
      pylori-negative after therapy, giving an intention-to-treat eradication rate of
      94% (95% confidence interval, 89%-99%). The ulcer healing rate was 92% (86%-98%),
      and ulcer healing was significantly associated with H. pylori eradication (p <
      0.01). Adverse events were reported by 33% of patients of which nausea was the
      commonest (14%). Noncompliance with therapy was significantly associated with H. 
      pylori treatment failure (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Seven day triple therapy
      incorporating high dose clarithromycin effectively eradicates H. pylori and heals
      ulcers, but it is disadvantaged by a relatively high rate of adverse events. In
      view of these findings and the fact that no direct comparison to date has shown
      increased efficacy from high dose clarithromycin, we would recommend continued
      use of low dose clarithromycin when combined with omeprazole and a
      nitroimidazole.

TI  - Clarithromycin dual therapy regimens for eradication of Helicobacter pylori: a
      review.
PG  - 159-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Peptic ulcer disease can be cured by eradication of Helicobacter
      pylori during treatment to heal the ulcer. Dual therapy regimens were among the
      first to be granted approval for use. Reports of dual therapies including
      clarithromycin as the sole antibiotic are reviewed. METHODS: Reports were
      identified from literature up to May 1997. Information reviewed included patient 
      population, medical diagnosis, trial design, eradication regimens, and H. pylori 
      eradication rates. The great diversity between studies limits formal
      meta-analysis but a measure of relative efficacy has been obtained by comparison 
      of eradication rates derived by clearly defined methods and by pooling data.
      RESULTS: Seventy-five reports of trials with 104 dual therapy treatment arms were
      reviewed. H. pylori eradication rates reported with ranitidine bismuth citrate
      plus clarithromycin range from 70-96% with a pooled observed rate of 85%. With
      omeprazole plus clarithromycin, reported eradication rates range from 27-90% with
      the pooled reported rate being 66%. Few data are available with either
      lansoprazole or ranitidine hydrochloride plus clarithromycin. CONCLUSION: High H.
      pylori eradication rates derived by consistent and clearly defined methods have
      been seen with ranitidine bismuth citrate plus clarithromycin. Lower and more
      variable rates are reported with clarithromycin and either a proton pump
      inhibitor or a histamine H2-receptor antagonist.

TI  - High eradication rate of Helicobacter pylori using a four-drug regimen in
      patients previously treated unsuccessfully.
PG  - 906-12
AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of a new regimen in
      eradicating Helicobacter pylori (Hp) in patients with duodenal ulcer (DU) who
      were previously treated unsuccessfully with standard triple therapy (tripotassium
      dicitratobismuthate [TDB] 120 mg QID, metronidazole 500 mg TID, and tetracycline 
      500 mg QID) or proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) dual therapy (omeprazole 20 mg BID and
      amoxicillin 500 mg QID). The study included 133 consecutive patients aged 17 to
      83 years with endoscopically diagnosed DU (diameter > or = 5 mm) in whom standard
      triple therapy or PPI dual therapy had failed to eradicate Hp. A rapid urease
      (CLO) test was performed on four biopsy specimens at study entry and at least 1
      month after the end of treatment to confirm Hp colonization and eradication,
      respectively. Patients were considered to be Hp positive if any CLO test was
      positive within 2 hours, and Hp was considered to be eradicated if all CLO tests 
      were still negative after 24 hours. In 31 randomly selected patients, Hp
      eradication was confirmed histologically as well. Patients were given omeprazole 
      60 mg/d (20 mg in the morning and 40 mg in the evening) plus amoxicillin 500 mg
      QID for 10 days and subsequently were given metronidazole 500 mg TID for 10 days 
      plus TDB 120 mg QID for 6 weeks. One hundred and twenty-four patients were
      followed up; five (4%) withdrew because of side effects (protracted diarrhea,
      stomatitis, skin rashes). Per-protocol analysis showed Hp eradication in 113 of
      119 patients (95%) and ulcer healing in 118 of 119 (99%). Intent-to-treat
      analysis showed an Hp eradication rate of 85% (113 of 133 patients) and an ulcer 
      healing rate of 89% (118 of 133 patients). In per-therapy analysis, the Hp
      eradication rate was 91% (113 of 124 patients), and the ulcer healing rate was
      95% (118 of 124 patients). Side effects were observed in 39 of 119 patients (33%)
      and were generally mild. The four-drug regimen used in this study, when given to 
      patients previously treated unsuccessfully with standard triple therapy or PPI
      dual therapy, was highly effective in eradicating Hp and healing DUs and had no
      major side effects.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori infection in Chile.
PG  - 983-9
AB  - This article summarizes studies designed to evaluate the role of Helicobacter
      pylori infection in Chile, described in 21 reports from nine centers in various
      Chilean regions published between 1985 and 1995. According to their data, H.
      pylori infection is quite frequent among patients with a variety of gastric
      conditions, including adults (43%-92%) and children (6%-100%). Levels of specific
      IgG antibodies to H. pylori are also elevated among patients with duodenal ulcers
      (100%) and gastritis (86%) as well as asymptomatic adults (75%). Combination
      therapy with three (but not two) drugs has been proved effective, with clinical
      improvement, ulcer cure, and H. pylori eradication occurring in well-controlled
      studies. Available evidence suggests that antibiotic resistance is not a major
      problem in treatment. The H. pylori reinfection rate is low (4.2% per year),
      suggesting that combination therapy with three drugs constitutes a cost-effective
      alternative for treating colonized symptomatic patients. Concurrent preliminary
      studies revealed that antibodies to VacA but not CagA proteins correlate with
      disease severity in Chilean patients. It can be concluded that local research
      assists local administrators of health resources to implement adequate policies
      to prevent, control, and treat H. pylori-related pathologies.

TI  - Randomized comparison of ranitidine bismuth citrate-based triple therapies for
      Helicobacter pylori.
PG  - 2213-5
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In an attempt to increase the efficacy and simplicity of FDA-approved
      regimens for Helicobacter pylori, we studied (1) addition of an inexpensive
      antibiotic (amoxicillin) to twice-daily ranitidine bismuth citrate
      (RBC)-clarithromycin dual therapy, and (2) substitution of RBC for bismuth
      subsalicylate + H2-receptor antagonist in bismuth-based triple therapy. METHODS: 
      Subjects with previously untreated Helicobacter pylori infection documented by
      13C-urea breath test plus either endoscopic biopsy or serology were randomly
      assigned to a 2-wk course of (1) RBC 400 mg b.i.d., amoxicillin 1 g b.i.d., and
      clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d. (RAC), or (2) RBC 400 mg b.i.d., metronidazole 250
      mg t.i.d., and tetracycline 500 mg t.i.d. (RMT). Repeat breath test was performed
      4 wk after the completion of therapy. RESULTS: Intent-to-treat and per-protocol
      cure rates for RAC were 46 of 50 patients (92%) and 45 of 47 patients (96%); for 
      RMT they were 40 of 50 patients (80%) and 37 of 42 patients (88%). Study drugs
      were stopped due to side effects in three patients (6%) taking RAC and six
      patients (12%) taking RMT. CONCLUSIONS: Twice-daily RBC-based triple therapy with
      clarithromycin and amoxicillin produces Helicobacter pylori eradication rates
      over 90%, which is comparable to rates seen with proton pump inhibitor-based
      triple therapies. RBC also may be substituted for bismuth subsalicylate and an + 
      H2-receptor antagonist in standard bismuth-based triple therapy.

TI  - Proton pump inhibitors or histamine-2 receptor antagonists for the prevention of 
      recurrences of erosive reflux esophagitis: a cost-effectiveness analysis.
PG  - 2179-87
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Erosive esophagitis is a recurring condition for which many patients 
      require preventive therapy. If maintenance therapy must be provided, the most
      cost-effective treatment strategy should be established. We evaluated the costs
      and benefits associated with three treatment strategies: 1) maintenance therapy
      with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) strategy, 2) maintenance therapy with a
      high-dose histamine-2 receptor antagonist (H2RA) strategy, and 3) maintenance
      therapy with a standard-dose H2RA. If patients experience a symptomatic
      recurrence on the H2RA strategies, they then receive PPI maintenance. METHODS: We
      used a cost-effectiveness model with a 1-yr time frame; data were obtained from
      randomized trials of lansoprazole and ranitidine, from case series, and expert
      opinion. RESULTS: In most situations, the high-dose H2RA strategy is the most
      costly, yet it is less effective than the PPI strategy. Among the remaining two
      options, the PPI strategy is more costly and more effective than the
      standard-dose H2RA strategy, requiring an additional $52-688 per recurrence
      prevented, depending on drug acquisition costs. The greater the degree to which
      esophagitis decreases quality of life, the more cost effective is the PPI
      strategy. For example, with a $50,000 per quality-adjusted life year
      cost-effectiveness threshold and a market-weighted average of drug costs, the PPI
      strategy appears cost effective for those patients who report that symptoms of
      esophagitis cause greater than a 9% decrement in quality of life. CONCLUSIONS:
      The high-dose H2RA strategy is not preferred in terms of either costs or
      benefits. The PPI strategy appears cost effective relative to the standard-dose
      H2RA strategy in the following situations: when patients are significantly
      bothered by esophagitis and in institutional settings where the difference in
      drug costs between PPIs and H2RAs is small.

TI  - The effect of cisapride in maintaining symptomatic remission in patients with
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 1100-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Successful treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) has 
      traditionally been assessed as healing of reflux oesophagitis, which may not be
      relevant in patients with moderate disease. In these patients symptom relief and 
      patient satisfaction with therapy are of fundamental importance. Cisapride has
      well-documented prokinetic effects and may be well suited for long-term therapy
      of GORD, but its effectiveness in purely symptomatic treatment is unknown. We
      therefore compared two dosage regimens of cisapride with placebo over a period of
      6 months in patients with evidence of gastrooesophageal reflux, initially treated
      with antisecretory medication, with regard to maintaining symptom relief and
      satisfaction with treatment. METHODS: Five hundred and thirty-five patients with 
      reflux oesophagitis grade 1 (n = 293) or 2 (n = 124) or with no reflux
      oesophagitis but pathologic 24-h pH-metry (n = 118) achieved satisfactory symptom
      relief with an H2-receptor antagonist or proton pump inhibitor within 4-8 weeks. 
      In a double-blind randomized, parallel-group study, they were then treated with
      cisapride, 20 mg at night or 20 mg twice daily, or placebo and followed up for a 
      maximum period of 6 months. Relapse was defined as dissatisfaction with therapy
      or an average consumption of more than two antacid tablets a day. RESULTS: Median
      time to relapse was 63 days for cisapride, 20 mg twice daily; 59 days for
      cisapride, 20 mg at night; and 49 days for placebo. Time to relapse was not
      significantly different (P = 0.09). Presence and grade of oesophagitis at base
      line, type of therapy before randomization, and pattern of non-reflux symptoms at
      base line did not influence these findings significantly. CONCLUSION: The study
      indicates that cisapride is of limited value in maintenance therapy of GORD in
      patients in whom symptom relief has been accomplished with potent antisecretory
      medication. This 'step-down' approach to therapy seems disadvantageous in the
      long-term therapy of GORD.

TI  - Omeprazole plus clarithromycin and either tinidazole or tetracycline for
      Helicobacter pylori infection: a randomized prospective study.
PG  - 2029-31
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Helicobacter pylori has begun to show resistance to imidazoles and
      could result in the low efficacy of short-term triple therapy. The aim of this
      study was to assess whether administration of tetracycline instead of tinidazole 
      in short-term low-dose triple therapy could increase the H. pylori eradication
      rate. METHODS: In a prospective study, 113 patients with peptic ulcer (n = 36) or
      non-ulcer dyspepsia (n = 77) were randomized to receive 1-wk treatment, composed 
      of omeprazole 20 mg b.i.d., clarithromycin 250 mg b.i.d., and either tinidazole
      500 mg b.i.d. (n = 57) or tetracycline 500 mg b.i.d. (n = 56), upon detection of 
      H. pylori infection at endoscopy. RESULTS: H. pylori eradication, defined as a
      negative bacterial finding in a rapid urease test and upon histologic assessment 
      at least 4 wk after cessation of therapy, was achieved in 86% (49 of 57; 95%
      confidence interval = 76.9-95) of patients in the first group and in 71.4% (40 of
      56; 95% confidence interval = 59.6-83.3) in the second group (p = not
      significant). Side effects occurred in 28% of patients from the tinidazole-based 
      group and in 12.5% from the tetracycline group (p = not significant). Two
      patients in the tinidazole group discontinued therapy at 5 and 6 days because of 
      side effects. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of tetracycline instead of
      tinidazole in short-term triple therapy yielded disappointing results in H.
      pylori eradication.

TI  - Immediate eradication of Helicobacter pylori in patients with previously
      documented peptic ulcer disease: clinical and economic effects.
PG  - 2017-24
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The clinical and economic benefits of Helicobacter pylori eradication
      for patients with newly diagnosed peptic ulcer disease are widely accepted. The
      objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of H. pylori
      eradication in the large cohort of asymptomatic patients receiving maintenance
      antisecretory therapy for a previously documented peptic ulcer disease. METHODS: 
      A decision analytic model estimated the clinical and economic effects of two
      management strategies for asymptomatic patients receiving maintenance
      antisecretory therapy for a previously documented peptic ulcer: strategy
      1-immediate H. pylori eradication therapy and cessation of maintenance therapy,
      and strategy 2-continued-maintenance antisecretory therapy, with H. pylori
      eradication therapy reserved for the first symptom recurrence. RESULTS: At 1 yr, 
      the model estimated that immediate H. pylori eradication therapy (strategy 1) led
      to 22% fewer months with ulcers (28.7 vs. 36.8 ulcer months/100 patient years),
      10% fewer months with ulcer symptoms (21.0 vs. 23.1 symptom months/100 patient
      years), and 24% lower per-patient expenditures ($587 vs. $767/patient year) than 
      maintenance antisecretory therapy and symptom-based H. pylori eradication
      (strategy 2). Immediate H. pylori eradication, however, resulted in 14% more
      months with upper gastrointestinal symptoms from all causes (37.9 vs. 33.2
      symptom months/100 patient years) than strategy 2, because maintenance
      antisecretory therapy was effective in treating symptoms due to causes other than
      peptic ulcer disease. CONCLUSIONS: Ulcer-related outcomes of asymptomatic
      patients receiving maintenance antisecretory agents for peptic ulcer disease can 
      be improved with immediate H. pylori eradication at reduced cost. Therefore, H.
      pylori eradication should be aggressively pursued in all patients-symptomatic or 
      not-with previously documented peptic ulcers, who are receiving maintenance
      antisecretory therapy.

TI  - Omeprazole as a diagnostic tool in gastroesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 1997-2000
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the diagnostic value of empirical treatment with
      omeprazole in the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). METHODS:
      Patients with symptoms suggestive of GERD underwent upper gastrointestinal
      endoscopy and 24-h esophageal pH monitoring. Patients with reflux esophagitis
      grade 0 or 1 were included in the study and were randomized to double-blind
      treatment with either 40 mg omeprazole or placebo o.m. The effect of treatment
      was evaluated after 1 and 2 wk with a symptom questionnaire with a four-grade
      Likert scale, and symptomatic response outcome was compared with the results of
      24-h pH-metry. RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients were included; however, 13 were
      excluded from the final analysis because of protocol violation. Of the remaining 
      85 patients, 54 had no signs of esophagitis at endoscopy, and 31 had esophagitis 
      grade 1. The pH registration showed pathological gastroesophageal reflux in 47
      patients (55%). Forty-one patients were randomized to treatment with omeprazole
      and 44 to placebo. There was a significant correlation between the pH
      registration result and response to omeprazole (p = 0.04, chi2), but not to
      placebo (p = 0.16). With pH-metry as the gold standard, the omeprazole test had
      positive and negative predictive values of 68% and 63%, respectively, for the
      diagnosis of GERD. When the omeprazole test was used as the gold standard, the
      positive and negative predictive values of pH monitoring were 68 % and 63 %,
      respectively. Similar sensitivity was found when the pH-metry was compared with
      presence of esophagitis. CONCLUSION: Determination of the symptomatic response to
      40 mg of omeprazole for 14 days is a simple and inexpensive tool for the
      diagnosis of GERD, with a sensitivity and specificity comparable to 24-h pH
      monitoring.

TI  - Heartburn without oesophagitis: efficacy of omeprazole therapy and features
      determining therapeutic response.
PG  - 974-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data are limited on the value of effective antisecretory therapy in
      the relief of heartburn in patients without oesophagitis. METHODS: Patients with 
      heartburn, without endoscopic signs of oesophagitis, were randomized to
      double-blind treatment with omeprazole, 20 or 10 mg once daily, or placebo, for 4
      weeks (n = 509). Pre-treatment oesophageal acid exposure was assessed using 24-h 
      intra-oesophageal pH monitoring. Heartburn was assessed at 2 and 4 weeks.
      RESULTS: At 4 weeks the proportion of patients with complete absence of heartburn
      was 46% (95% confidence interval, 39-53%) with 20 mg omeprazole, 31% (25-38%)
      with 10 mg omeprazole, and 13% (7-20%) with placebo. Satisfaction with therapy
      was reported by 66%, 57%, and 31% of the patients, respectively. CONCLUSION:
      Omeprazole, 20 and 10 mg once daily, provides rapid relief of heartburn in
      patients without endoscopic oesophagitis.

      relief of symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in general practice.
PG  - 965-73
AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of omeprazole, 20 mg once daily, in the treatment of
      reflux oesophagitis and the therapeutic advantages over the histamine H2 receptor
      antagonists are well documented. This study assessed 20 mg omeprazole daily
      (OM20), 10 mg omeprazole daily (OM10), and 150 mg ranitidine (RAN) twice daily
      for symptom relief in gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). METHODS: Patients
      (n = 994) presenting with heartburn to their general practitioner underwent
      endoscopy to exclude peptic ulcer disease and were randomized into a UK,
      multicentre, parallel-group, double-blind comparison of the three treatments for 
      4 weeks. Symptoms were assessed at clinic visits after 2 and 4 weeks. RESULTS:
      Symptom relief after 4 weeks was achieved by 61% (OM20), 49% (OM10), and 40%
      (RAN) patients (OM20 versus OM10, P < 0.0167; OM20 versus RAN, P < 0.0001; OM10
      versus RAN, P < 0.01). Among the patients (32%) with erosive reflux oesophagitis,
      symptom relief was achieved in 79% (OM20), 48% (OM10), and 33% (RAN) (OM20 versus
      OM10, P < 0.0001; OM20 versus RAN, P < 0.0001; OM1O versus RAN, NS). CONCLUSION: 
      Omeprazole, 20 mg, is the most effective initial therapy for relief of GORD
      symptoms.

AB  - Pathophysiology and treatment of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) in children have
      often been extrapolated from studies in adult patients. Fortunately, many groups 
      are now addressing GER specifically in relation to children. Abnormalities in
      gastrointestinal motility are described in gastroesophageal reflux GER, and there
      are several new studies looking at this issue in infantile GER. An international 
      working group has put together recommendations for management of infantile GER.
      The results of a large pediatric study using omeprazole and a review of the use
      of the prokinetic cisapride in pediatrics are summarized. Several papers review
      recent experiences with laparoscopic fundoplication. New diagnostic modalities
      used to investigate GER in infants and children are discussed. These studies aid 
      in both our understanding of possible pathogenesis of GER as well as treatment of
      the young patient with GER.

TI  - Can optimal acid suppression prevent rebleeding in peptic ulcer patients with a
      non-bleeding visible vessel: a preliminary report of a randomized comparative
      study.
PG  - 1495-9
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The hypothesis that profound acid suppression might prevent clot
      lysis and thus benefit patients with a non-bleeding visible vessel has not been
      confirmed. Omeprazole can suppress gastric acid remarkably and may be beneficial 
      for patients with peptic ulcer bleeding. METHODOLOGY: Fifty-two patients with a
      non-bleeding visible vessel at the ulcer base were enrolled and randomized into
      four groups (N = 13 in each group). In the cimetidine group, the patients
      received cimetidine 300 mg i.v. bolus followed by 300 mg i.v. every 6 hr during
      hospitalization. In the heater probe thermocoagulation + cimetidine group, the
      patients received heater probe thermocoagulation and cimetidine 300 mg i.v. bolus
      followed by 300 mg i.v. every 6 h during hospitalization. In the omeprazole q.d. 
      group, the patients received omeprazole 40 mg i.v. bolus followed by 40 mg i.v.
      daily for two days. In the omeprazole q 12 h group, the patients received
      omeprazole 40 mg i.v. bolus followed by 40 mg i.v. every 12 h for two days. A 24 
      hr intragastric pH was recorded for every case. RESULTS: The mean 24 hr
      intragastric pH were higher in the omeprazole q.d. (mean 5.8) and the omeprazole 
      q 12 h groups (mean 6.4) than in the cimetidine (mean 4.3) and the heater probe
      thermocoagulation + cimetidine groups (mean 4.9) (p < 0.05). Rebleeding occurred 
      in 5, 2, 2 and 2 patients in the cimetidine, heater probe thermocoagulation +
      cimetidine, omeprazole q.d., and omeprazole q 12 h groups, respectively (p >
      0.05). Volume of blood transfusion and number of days in hospital were not
      statistically different among the four groups. CONCLUSIONS: Omeprazole can
      remarkably suppress gastric acid when it is compared to that of the H2 receptor
      blocker. Patients with a non-bleeding visible vessel using omeprazole do not
      exhibit a decrease in the rebleeding rate as compared with those patients using
      cimetidine.

TI  - Effects of oral rabeprazole on oesophageal and gastric pH in patients with
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 973-80
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study examined the dose-response effects of the new proton-pump 
      inhibitor rabeprazole on oesophageal and gastric pH in patients with
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. METHODS: This study had a single-centre,
      double-blind, randomized, two-way crossover design. Twenty patients were treated 
      for two 7-day periods separated by a 7-10-day washout period. Patients were
      randomly assigned to receive either 20 mg of rabeprazole once daily during the
      first treatment period and 40 mg once daily during the second treatment period,
      or 40 mg during the first treatment period and 20 mg during the second treatment 
      period. The primary efficacy variable was oesophageal acid exposure determined by
      24-hour ambulatory pH monitoring. Acid-reflux time was defined as the percentage 
      of time over 24 h that oesophageal pH was < 4. A dosage was considered effective 
      if reflux time was reduced to < 6%, a number which has been our internal
      laboratory reference. RESULTS: Both rabeprazole 20 mg and 40 mg, given once
      daily, normalized reflux time, with decreases of 79% and 92% in acid exposure by 
      day 7. Both dosages also decreased the mean total number of reflux episodes and
      the number of episodes lasting > 5 min, with no significant differences between
      dosages for any reflux parameter. Mean gastric pH increased with 20 mg from 1.86 
      at baseline to 3.71 on day 1 and 4.17 on day 7. Rabeprazole 40 mg once daily
      increased gastric pH from 2.01 to 4.37 on day 1, and to 4.65 on day 7. Safety
      analyses revealed no significant acute side-effects for either dosage.
      CONCLUSIONS: Pathological oesophageal acid exposure was normalized with both 20
      mg and 40 mg dosages of rabeprazole, and the effects of these two doses did not
      differ. Rabeprazole was well-tolerated in this short-term study.

TI  - Treatment of reflux oesophagitis of moderate and severe grade with ranitidine or 
      pantoprazole--comparison of 24-hour intragastric and oesophageal pH.
PG  - 959-65
AB  - BACKGROUND: Proton pump inhibiting drugs strongly decrease gastric acid secretion
      and have proven more effective in the treatment of reflux oesophagitis than
      H2-receptor antagonists. METHODS: In a double-blind randomized trial, 24 patients
      with oesophagitis grade II (n = 15) and III (n = 9) were treated for 4 weeks with
      either ranitidine 150 mg b.d. (n = 13) or pantoprazole 40 mg o.m. (n = 11).
      Before the trial and on the last day of medication, 24-h intragastric pH and
      oesophageal pH profiles were performed. Healing was assessed by endoscopy.
      RESULTS: Pantoprazole increased median gastric pH from 1.7 to 3.9. Virtually no
      change in gastric pH was seen in the ranitidine group. Pantoprazole reduced the
      fraction time of pH < 4 in the oesophagus from 21% to 3% (P = 0.0005), and the
      median number of refluxes from 206 to 56 (P = 0.022). Oesophageal acid exposure
      was not decreased by ranitidine. Healing of the oesophagitis was seen in 6/11
      cases after pantoprazole and in 3/13 cases after ranitidine (N.S.) CONCLUSION: In
      patients with oesophagitis of moderate and severe grade, pantoprazole 40 mg o.m. 
      decreases intragastric acidity and gastro-oesophageal acid reflux more
      effectively than ranitidine 150 mg b.d.

      (ACT-10) eradicates Helicobacter pylori and heals duodenal ulcer. ACT-10 Study
      Group.
PG  - 943-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: Whilst the role of Helicobacter pylori eradication in managing
      duodenal ulcers has been established, consensus regarding the ideal regimen has
      not been achieved. METHODS: Patients with H. pylori-positive active duodenal
      ulcer were randomly assigned to receive triple therapy with amoxycillin 1000 mg
      b.d. + clarithromycin 500 mg b.d. + omeprazole 20 mg daily for 10 days (ACT-10)
      or dual therapy with clarithromycin 500 mg t.d.s. + omeprazole 40 mg daily for 14
      days (Dual). No additional acid suppression was provided following eradication
      therapy. Endoscopy, with biopsy for culture and histology, as well as 13C-urea
      breath testing (13C-UBT) were performed pre-treatment to assess H. pylori
      infection. H. pylori eradication was established at 4-6 weeks follow-up with
      culture (2 antral, 1 corpus biopsies), histology (2 antral biopsies), and
      13C-UBT. Ulcer healing by endoscopy and change in clinical symptoms were also
      assessed at 4-6 weeks. RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty-seven (267) patients were
      randomized to ACT-10 (n = 137) or Dual therapy (n = 130). By per-protocol and
      intention-to-treat analyses, H. pylori eradication at 4-6 weeks follow-up was 91%
      (115/127) and 88% (120/136), respectively, for ACT-10 patients and 59% (68/115)
      and 55% (72/130), respectively, for Dual therapy patients (P < 0.001 for both
      analyses). Ulcer healing was high in both treatment groups: ACT-10, 93% (118/127)
      and 90% (122/136), respectively; and Dual therapy, 91% (104/114) and 85%
      (111/130), respectively. Pre-treatment resistance to clarithromycin was low (4%, 
      8/214) as compared to metronidazole resistance which was over 40%. Emergence of
      resistance to clarithromycin was observed in 2% of patients receiving ACT-10 and 
      in 25% of those receiving Dual therapy. ACT-10 and Dual therapy patients
      experienced similar rates of drug-related adverse events (33% vs. 32%,
      respectively) and discontinuation from therapy due to an adverse event (1.5% vs. 
      5%, respectively). More than 90% of patients were compliant with each prescribed 
      medication. CONCLUSION: In patients with active duodenal ulcer, a 10-day course
      of amoxycillin-clarithromycin-based triple therapy without additional acid
      suppression is highly effective in eradicating H. pylori and healing duodenal
      ulcer.

TI  - Twice a day quadruple therapy (bismuth subsalicylate, tetracycline, metronidazole
      plus lansoprazole) for treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection.
PG  - 935-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Quadruple therapy (bismuth, metronidazole and tetracycline (BMT) +
      proton pump inhibitor) is touted as being > 95% effective, regardless of
      metronidazole resistance. We tested a 10-day b.d. quadruple therapy for treatment
      of H. pylori infection. METHODS: Anti-H. pylori therapy consisted of lansoprazole
      15 mg b.d. plus tetracycline 500 mg b.d., metronidazole 500 mg b.d., and
      swallowable Pepto-Bismol caplets (2 b.d.) for 10 days. H. pylori status was
      evaluated by culture and histology before and 4 or more weeks after therapy.
      RESULTS: The cure rate for intention-to-treat was 70%. Treatment success was
      calculated overall and separately in relation to antimicrobial resistance
      patterns. The cure rate among the metronidazole-sensitive isolates was 89.7% (26 
      of 29) vs. 41.2% (7 of 17) of the metronidazole-resistant isolates (P < 0.005).
      Moderate (n = 1) or severe (n = 3) side-effects were experienced in four patients
      with only one withdrawing because of side-effects. CONCLUSION: Twice a day
      quadruple therapy is effective for metronidazole-sensitive strains but its
      usefulness is markedly reduced by the presence of pre-treatment metronidazole
      resistance. Twice a day quadruple therapy can be recommended in locations where
      background metronidazole resistance is uncommon. Possibly, 14-day therapy or a
      higher dosage of metronidazole provide better results with
      metronidazole-resistant H. pylori.

TI  - Two omeprazole-based Helicobacter pylori eradication regimens for the treatment
      of duodenal ulcer disease in general practice.
PG  - 919-27
AB  - BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori is the main acquired factor in the pathogenesis
      of duodenal ulcer disease. METHODS: This multicentre study conducted in 32
      general practice centres in the UK and Ireland was a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-group comparison of triple therapy (n = 
      98: omeprazole 40 mg once daily and amoxycillin 1 g b.d. for 2 weeks, and
      metronidazole 400 mg t.d.s. for the first week) and dual therapy (n = 85:
      omeprazole 40 mg once daily and amoxycillin 1 g b.d. for 2 weeks, with placebo
      during the first week) for the eradication of H. pylori in patients with
      symptomatic duodenal ulcer disease. Patients who were successfully treated
      entered a follow-up phase for 12 months to assess symptomatic relapse and use of 
      health-care resources. RESULTS: Eradication of H. pylori based on a second
      13C-urea breath test was successful in 95% (95% confidence interval (CI) =
      90-100%) of patients receiving omeprazole triple therapy and 53% (95% CI =
      41-65%) of those receiving omeprazole dual therapy (P < 0.0001 between groups,
      all data available analysis). The all-patients-treated analysis gave eradication 
      rates of 80 and 44% for omeprazole triple therapy and omeprazole dual therapy,
      respectively. Symptomatic relapse occurred in 16% (18/116) of the H.
      pylori-negative patients who entered the 12-month follow-up period, and there
      were significant reductions in the number of consultations, investigations and
      prescriptions relating to upper gastrointestinal symptoms compared with the 12
      months prior to the eradication therapies (all P < 0.0001). The two treatment
      strategies were comparable in terms of the number of adverse events reported.
      CONCLUSIONS: Omeprazole triple therapy provides a highly effective treatment for 
      the eradication of H. pylori infection in patients in general practice, with an
      adverse event profile similar to that seen with omeprazole dual therapy. The
      successful eradication of H. pylori with these omeprazole regimens results in a
      significant decrease in the use of health-care resources in the 12 months
      following treatment.

TI  - A prospective follow-up study of 5669 users of lansoprazole in daily practice.
PG  - 887-97
AB  - BACKGROUND: Immediately after the introduction of the proton pump inhibitor
      lansoprazole, a 2-year follow-up study was started to evaluate patterns of use,
      safety and effectiveness of this drug in naturally occurring groups of patients
      in the Netherlands. Medical data were recorded by participating physicians while 
      medication listing were provided by pharmacists. METHODS: The study was designed 
      according to the Safety Assessment of Marketed Medicines guidelines. The only
      inclusion criterion was the use of lansoprazole prior to entry into the study.
      RESULTS: A total of 5669 lansoprazole users was included by 374 general
      practitioners and 117 specialists. Lansoprazole was mostly prescribed in patients
      with reflux oesophagitis (55.1%), 'gastritis' (26.8%) and duodenal ulcers
      (11.4%), sometimes as part of a Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy (8.5%).
      For their complaints most patients (91.1%) had previously used acid-related
      drugs. Improvement or disappearance of complaints was achieved in 88.9% and 90.5%
      of patients after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment, respectively. Diarrhoea (4.1%),
      headache (2.9%) and nausea (2.6%) were the most frequently reported adverse
      events. CONCLUSION: The patterns of use of lansoprazole in daily practice
      deviated from the recommendations in the information leaflet. Nevertheless,
      lansoprazole was found to be safe in this naturally occurring group of users.
      Effectiveness appeared to be comparable to results found in clinical trials of
      the registered indications for lansoprazole.

TI  - Cure with omeprazole plus amoxicillin versus long-term ranitidine therapy in
      Helicobacter pylori-associated peptic ulcer bleeding.
PG  - 299-304
AB  - BACKGROUND: Long-term prophylaxis with ranitidine reduces the risk of recurrent
      bleeding in patients with a history of bleeding peptic ulcers. To date, no
      randomized study has been performed to compare cure of Helicobacter pylori
      infection versus H2 blocker prophylaxis in patients with bleeding peptic ulcer.
      METHODS: In a prospective randomized study, 95 consecutive patients with H.
      pylori-associated peptic ulcer bleeding were randomized to either ranitidine
      prophylaxis (150 mg at night) for 2 years or to H. pylori-eradication with
      omeprazole 60 mg twice daily plus amoxicillin 750 mg three times daily for 10
      days. RESULTS: (Intention-to-treat analysis). Forty-eight patients were enrolled 
      in the ranitidine group; 47 in the omeprazole-plus-amoxicillin group. Mean
      follow-up was 576 days (77 to 730). Ulcer recurrence rate was 31.3% in the
      ranitidine group (group 1) versus 6.37% in the eradication group (group 2; p =
      0.0018). More patients had recurrent bleeding in group 1 (8.3%) than in group 2
      (4.2%) but we were not able to show a statistically significant difference with
      respect to recurrent bleeding between groups (p = 0.29). Definite cure of H.
      pylori infection was achieved in 89.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Cure of H. pylori infection 
      reduces recurrence of peptic ulcer and therefore rebleeding more effectively than
      does long-term maintenance therapy with an H2 blocker.

TI  - Identification, diagnosis, and treatment of acid-related diseases in the elderly:
      implications for long-term care.
PG  - 938-58
AB  - Acid-related disorders such as peptic ulcer disease and gastroesophageal reflux
      disease occur frequently in the elderly and are associated with a high frequency 
      of morbidity and mortality. The proton pump inhibitors lansoprazole and
      omeprazole produce faster rates of healing and greater symptomatic relief in
      patients with acid-related disorders than histamine2-receptor antagonists, are
      well tolerated, and are associated with few adverse events. Compared with
      omeprazole, which interacts with diazepam, warfarin, and phenytoin, lansoprazole 
      produces only a minor increase in theophylline clearance. Proton pump inhibitors 
      in combination with antibiotic therapy can eradicate Helicobacter pylori, the
      main risk factor in the recurrence of peptic ulcer disease, obviating the need
      for maintenance therapy. Long-term acid suppression with proton pump inhibitors
      may be necessary to prevent the recurrence of gastroesophageal reflux disease.
      The safety and efficacy profile of these agents makes them ideal for the
      treatment of acid-related diseases in elderly patients.

TI  - Parietal cell protrusions in gastric ulcer disease.
PG  - 1126-30
AB  - Oxyntic mucosal biopsy specimens from patients receiving omeprazole therapy have 
      been described as frequently showing characteristic tonguelike protrusions of
      parietal cell cytoplasm (PCP) into the gland lumen. Although protrusion of
      parietal cell cytoplasm is believed to be associated with omeprazole therapy and 
      has been implicated in the histogenesis of fundic gland polyps, we have observed 
      it in a wide variety of different conditions unrelated to peptic ulcer disease or
      omeprazole therapy. To establish the incidence of PCP and analyze its
      relationship to gastritis, gland dilatation, cystic change, and fundic gland
      polyps, we studied 400 gastric mucosal biopsy specimens from gastric ulcer
      patients who were not receiving omeprazole therapy and who did not receive any
      medications for at least 2 weeks. Severity of each of these changes was graded on
      a scale of I to III. PCP was observed in oxyntic mucosal biopsy specimens from 60
      (15%) patients and was associated with varying grades of chronic superficial or
      interstitial gastritis in 25 (Helicobacter pylori was identified in 12). Although
      chronic atrophic gastritis, cystic change, or fundic gland polyps were not
      identified in any of the cases with PCP, gland dilatation was present in 25 of 60
      (42%) biopsy specimens. No consistent linear correlation was observed between
      increasing grades of PCP and gastritis or gland dilatation. Our findings of PCP
      in 15% of gastric ulcer patients who were off all medications for 2 weeks
      indicate that PCP is not always related to omeprazole usage. It appears to be a
      change encountered in a wide variety of diverse settings and, therefore, should
      not be used to monitor omeprazole therapy. In gastric ulcer patients, there is no
      linear correlation between PCP and gland dilatation or severity of gastritis. The
      lack of association of PCP with such cardinal features of fundic gland polyps as 
      gland dilatation and cystic change suggests that PCP per se has little if any
      role in the development of such polyps. The exact clinical and functional
      significance of PCP remain to be established and merits further investigation.

TI  - Current guidelines on stress ulcer prophylaxis.
PG  - 581-96
AB  - Acute uppergastrointestinal bleeding in intensive care unit (ICU) patients may
      occur due to peptic ulcer disease, adverse drug effects, gastric tube lesions,
      acute renal failure, liver failure or stress-induced gastric mucosal lesions.
      Gastric acid hypersecretion can be observed in patients with head trauma or
      neurosurgical procedures. Gastric mucosal ischaemia due to hypotension and shock 
      is the most important risk factor for stress ulcer bleeding. Preventive
      strategies aim to reduce gastric acidity (histamine H2 receptor antagonists,
      antacids), strengthen mucosal defensive mechanisms (sucralfate, antacids,
      pirenzepine) and normalise gastric mucosal microcirculation (sucralfate,
      pirenzepine). However, the most important prophylactic measure is an optimised
      resuscitation and ICU regime aiming to improve oxygenation and microcirculation. 
      All drugs approved for stress ulcer prophylaxis in Europe (H2 antagonists,
      antacids, pirenzepine, sucralfate) have been shown to be effective in prospective
      controlled randomised trials. However, due to insufficient clinical data,
      prostaglandins and omeprazole cannot be recommended for this use. Stress ulcer
      prophylaxis is indicated only in patients at risk, and not in every ICU patient. 
      The selection of drugs today depends not only on efficacy but also on possible
      adverse effects and on costs. In this regard, the most cost-effective drug is
      sucralfate. The clinical relevance of nosocomial pneumonia due to gastric
      bacterial overgrowth has decreased during the past decade due to several changes 
      in the management of critically ill patients.

TI  - Bismuth subsalicylate instead of metronidazole with lansoprazole and
      clarithromycin for Helicobacter pylori infection: a randomized trial.
PG  - 1483-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the efficacy of lansoprazole, clarithromycin, and
      metronidazole (LCM) administered twice daily for 7 days. Because there is growing
      concern about the development of metronidazole-resistant H. pylori (HP) strains, 
      we also tested a novel regimen consisting of lansoprazole, clarithromycin, and
      bismuth subsalicylate (LCB). METHODS: Patients with active HP infection and
      peptic ulcer, a history of peptic ulcer, or nonulcer dyspepsia were randomized to
      either lansoprazole 30 mg b.i.d., clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d., and metronidazole
      500 mg b.i.d. or lansoprazole 30 mg b.i.d., clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d., and
      bismuth subsalicylate 524 mg b.i.d. (LCB) for 7 days. Compliance and side effects
      were recorded by using a diary. RESULTS: "Per protocol" eradication with LCM was 
      achieved in 41 of 47 (87%). By using "intention to treat" analysis, LCM
      eradicated HP infection in 43 of 53 patients (81%). By using "per protocol"
      analysis, LCB eradicated HP infection in 40 of 47 patients (85%). On an
      "intention to treat" basis, LCB led to HP eradication in 42 of 52 (81%). The most
      common significant side effects observed with LCM were altered taste (39%) and
      abdominal pain (19%). With LCB, the most common significant side effects were
      altered taste (23%) and dark stools (23%). CONCLUSIONS: LCB for 7 days was as
      effective in eradicating HP infection as a 7-day course of LCM. Further studies
      evaluating the role of bismuth compounds in proton-pump inhibitor based triple
      therapy are warranted. Such therapy may have particular importance in areas where
      high metronidazole resistance is a concern.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The therapeutic approach to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in
      intellectually disabled individuals has not been studied extensively. So far,
      only low response rates to medical and surgical therapy of GERD have been
      reported. However, the efficacy of proton pump inhibitors, to date the most
      effective medical therapy for GERD, has never been evaluated in this population. 
      Our purpose, therefore, was to study the effect of omeprazole on healing and
      symptom relief in the intellectually disabled. METHODS: The treatment scheme was 
      as follows: omeprazole 40 mg was given once daily (o.d.) as a healing dose for 3 
      months, and omeprazole 20 mg o.d. was given as a maintenance dose for another 3
      months, to intellectually disabled subjects with endoscopically proven
      esophagitis, grades I-IV, according to Savary-Miller classification. After 3 and 
      6 months, the result of this treatment was evaluated by symptom scoring and/or
      endoscopy. In case of relapse, the dose was increased. RESULTS: At the first
      endoscopy, 40 of 107 patients (37%) had grade I, 36 (34%) grade II, 18 (17%)
      grade III, and 13 (12%) grade IV esophagitis. In 92 of 104 patients (88%), the
      treatment scheme was effective in healing the esophagitis and keeping patients in
      remission, independent of the severity of esophagitis. In 11 of 104 (11%)
      patients, a symptomatic relapse was observed after the dose was decreased to 20
      mg o.d. However, all of these patients became symptom free again after the dose
      was increased to 40 mg o.d., and all were healed endoscopically at the end of the
      study. One (1%) patient needed omeprazole 60 mg o.d. for healing, but in this
      patient, no relapse was seen while on a maintenance dose of omeprazole 40 mg o.d.
      Marked improvement of persistent vomiting, hematemesis, regurgitation, food
      refusal, iron deficiency anemia, and depressive symptoms was seen at the end of
      the study. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that omeprazole is highly effective 
      for all grades of esophagitis in the intellectually disabled. The dose needed to 
      maintain them in remission can be titrated according to the reflux symptoms.

TI  - Lansoprazole. An update of its pharmacological properties and clinical efficacy
      in the management of acid-related disorders.
PG  - 473-500
AB  - Lansoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that reduces gastric acid secretion. It
      has proved effective in combination regimens for the eradication of Helicobacter 
      pylori and as monotherapy to heal and relieve symptoms of gastric or duodenal
      ulcers and gastro-oesophageal reflux. After initial healing, it may be used to
      prevent recurrence of oesophageal erosions or peptic ulcers in patients in whom
      H. pylori is not the major cause of ulceration and to reduce basal acid output in
      patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Usual dosages are 15 to 60 mg/day,
      although dosages of < or = 180 mg/day have been used in patients with
      hypersecretory states. In patients with duodenal or gastric ulcer, short term
      lansoprazole monotherapy was similar to omeprazole and superior to histamine H2
      receptor antagonists in achieving healing rates > 90%. Lansoprazole was as
      effective a component of H. pylori eradication regimens as omeprazole,
      tripotassium dicitrato bismuthate (colloidal bismuth subcitrate) or ranitidine.
      Lansoprazole was superior to ranitidine in symptom relief and healing of
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and tended to relieve symptoms more rapidly
      than omeprazole, although initial healing was similar. As maintenance treatment, 
      lansoprazole was similar to omeprazole and superior to ranitidine in relieving
      symptoms and preventing relapse. Lansoprazole was also superior to ranitidine in 
      healing and relieving symptoms of oesophageal erosions associated with Barrett's 
      oesophagus; healing was maintained for a mean of 2.9 years in > or = 70% of
      patients. Lansoprazole was also superior to ranitidine in prophylaxis of
      redilatation of oesophageal strictures. After > or = 4 years of use in patients
      with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, lansoprazole 60 to 180 mg/day effectively
      controlled basal acid output. Dosages may be reduced in some patients once
      healing and symptom relief has been achieved. Preliminary studies of lansoprazole
      in patients at risk of aspiration pneumonia or stress ulcers show promise.
      Although studies show lansoprazole is potentially effective in treating
      gastrointestinal bleeding, future studies should assess patients' H. pylori
      status. Lansoprazole has been well tolerated in clinical trials, with headache,
      diarrhoea, dizziness and nausea appearing to be the most common adverse effects. 
      Tolerability of lansoprazole does not deteriorate with age and the drug is well
      tolerated in long term use (< or = 4 years) in patients with Zollinger-Ellison
      syndrome or reflux disease. Thus, lansoprazole is an important alternative to
      omeprazole and H2 receptor antagonists in acid-related disorders. In addition to 
      its efficacy in healing or maintenance treatment, it may provide more effective
      symptom relief than other comparator agents.

TI  - Gastric acid, acid-suppressing drugs, and bacterial gastroenteritis: how much of 
      a risk?
PG  - 571-4
AB  - Recent studies have reported an association between acid-suppressing drugs
      (histamine H2 receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors) and development of
      infectious gastroenteritis. We conducted a case-control study nested in a cohort 
      of more than 170,000 ever-users of acid-suppressing drugs to examine the
      association between acid-suppressing drugs and bacterial gastroenteritis, using
      data from the General Practice Research Database in the United Kingdom. We
      identified 374 confirmed cases of bacterial gastroenteritis and 2,000 randomly
      sampled controls from the study cohort. There was little increased risk of
      bacterial gastroenteritis among users of acid-suppressing drugs [relative risk
      (RR) = 1.1; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.8-1.4]. Omeprazole "single users"
      had an RR of 1.6 (95% CI = 1.0-2.4), but this effect was not observed among those
      using only omeprazole during the last year (RR = 1.1; 95% CI = 0.7-1.9). We did
      not find any dose or treatment duration response. These data do not support a
      major role for acid reduction in the development of bacterial gastroenteritis.

TI  - Gastric corpus IL-8 concentration and neutrophil infiltration in duodenal ulcer
      patients.
PG  - 793-800
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present study was to examine the association
      between interleukin-8 (IL-8) in the gastric body due to Helicobacter pylori
      infection and histological gastritis, as well as elucidating the effect of acid
      secretion inhibitors on H. pylori associated body gastritis in duodenal ulcer
      patients. METHODS: Twenty H. pylori-negative patients, 20 H. pylori-positive
      patients with chronic gastritis without peptic ulceration, and 20 H.
      pylori-positive duodenal ulcer patients (DU) were studied. Four biopsy samples
      were taken, each from the greater curvature of the antrum and body of the
      stomach. Biopsies were histologically investigated by ELISA to determine the
      density of H. pylori, the degree of neutrophil infiltration and the IL-8
      concentration in the mucosa. RESULTS: In the gastric mucosa of H. pylori-negative
      subjects, no IL-8 and hardly any neutrophil infiltration were observed. In
      contrast, enhanced IL-8 production and increased neutrophil infiltration were
      present in those infected with H. pylori. In H. pylori-positive patients, a
      significant correlation was observed between the IL-8 concentration and the
      degree of neutrophil infiltration, but no correlation was found in the body
      mucosa of those with DU. Twelve of 20 DU patients demonstrated hardly any
      neutrophil infiltration, despite the increased mucosal IL-8 content in the body. 
      The administration of omeprazole in DU patients markedly increased mucosal
      neutrophil infiltration even though it did not cause any significant change in
      the H. pylori density and IL-8 concentration in the body. Although the effect of 
      omeprazole was transient, a significant increase in neutrophil infiltration
      continued in comparison with the status before omeprazole administration in those
      subsequently undergoing maintenance treatment with H2-blockers. CONCLUSION: In H.
      pylori-positive chronic gastritis, IL-8 concentration is enhanced in the mucosa
      of the body, and is associated with increased neutrophil infiltration. However,
      in DU patients, despite increases in body IL-8 concentration, neutrophil
      infiltration is reduced and the gastritis may be localized in the antrum.

TI  - Treating the symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease: a double-blind
      comparison of omeprazole and cisapride.
PG  - 765-73
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few studies have specifically addressed the management of the
      symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, and there are no comparative data 
      in this respect for acid pump inhibitors and prokinetic agents. METHODS:
      Following endoscopy 424 patients presenting with heartburn as the predominant
      symptom of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease were randomized to treatment with
      omeprazole 20 or 10 mg once daily, or cisapride 10 mg four times daily, in a
      double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group, multicentre study. Symptoms and
      quality of life were assessed at 4 weeks. Patients still experiencing heartburn
      continued therapy for a further 4 weeks and the assessments were repeated.
      RESULTS: At 4 weeks, heartburn was resolved in 65% (95% CI: 57-73%), 56% (48-64%)
      and 41% (32%-49%) of patients treated, respectively, with omeprazole 20 mg and 10
      mg once daily, and cisapride. Both omeprazole doses were significantly more
      effective than cisapride (P < 0.01). The same order of efficacy was observed
      regardless of the presence of erosive oesophagitis. Regurgitation and epigastric 
      pain also improved to a greater degree with omeprazole than with cisapride.
      Quality of life was improved in all treatment groups, and the improvement in the 
      reflux dimension of the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) score was
      significantly different between groups (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Omeprazole 20 or
      10 mg once daily is significantly more effective than cisapride in the resolution
      of heartburn, regardless of the presence of erosive oesophagitis, and this is
      accompanied by an improvement in patient quality of life.

TI  - Twenty-four-hour intragastric acidity and plasma gastrin during 3-month treatment
      with omeprazole in healthy subjects.
PG  - 747-53
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prolonged treatment with omeprazole 20 or 40 mg/day is sometimes
      required, especially for severe oesophagitis. However, information about
      long-term effects on intragastric acidity and plasma gastrin response with such
      drug regimens is scarce. METHODS: Sixteen healthy subjects (11 men, 5 women, mean
      age 29 years) randomly received either 20 or 40 mg of omeprazole once daily (at
      08.00 h) for 3 months. Gastric pH was recorded every 6 s for 24 h from noon to
      noon under standardized conditions, and blood samples were collected hourly in
      order to determine the 24-h plasma gastrin response on day 0 (pre-entry), day 7, 
      day 28 and day 90. RESULTS: From day 0 to day 7, 24-h median pH increased from
      1.7 to 4.6 and mean percentage of time at pH < 4 decreased from 89% to 35% with
      omeprazole 20 mg. Respective values with omeprazole 40 mg were 1.9 to 4.3, and
      89% to 34%. Inhibition of gastric acidity remained unchanged during the 3 months 
      of treatment. Despite similar effects on the basis of 24-h analysis, the decrease
      in daytime acidity was slightly higher with omeprazole 40 mg than with omeprazole
      20 mg. Twenty-four-hour integrated plasma gastrin significantly increased with
      both drug regimens between day 0 and day 7 (P < 0.01), and between day 7 and day 
      28 (P < 0.01) with omeprazole 40 mg; there was no significant increase between
      day 28 and day 90 with either of the drug regimens. CONCLUSION: Omeprazole 20 and
      40 mg/day provides long-term stable acid suppression with a progressive increase 
      in gastrin response, stabilizing after 2 months of treatment.

TI  - Age-dependent eradication of Helicobacter pylori with dual therapy.
PG  - 711-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Combined treatment using an acid-inhibiting drug with antibiotics can
      cure Helicobacter pylori infection. However, eradication rates are highly
      variable, especially if a proton pump inhibitor is used with amoxycillin.
      Therefore it is important to define factors/predictors of the clinical outcome.
      METHODS: In a single-blind study, 60 H. pylori-positive patients prospectively
      matched for diagnosis (erosive gastritis, duodenal and gastric ulcer), age (above
      and below 50 years) and smoking habits were randomly treated (each group n = 20) 
      for 2 weeks with amoxycillin (1 mg b.d.) and either omeprazole (20 mg b.d.),
      lansoprazole (30 mg b.d.) or ranitidine (300 mg b.d.). Intragastric pH and plasma
      levels of the administered drugs were monitored over a dosing interval of 12 h.
      RESULTS: The overall eradication rates were 45% (intention-to-treat, ITT, 27/60) 
      or 47% (per protocol 27/58); they did not differ (ITT) between omeprazole (50%), 
      lansoprazole (40%) and ranitidine (45%). Median pH and time at which intragastric
      pH was above 4 was slightly lower for ranitidine (4.0 +/- 1.7; 51 +/- 25%) than
      for omeprazole (5.4 +/- 1.1: 77 +/- 25%; P < 0.05) or lansoprazole (4.4 +/- 1.6: 
      68 +/- 32%). Plasma concentrations of amoxycillin were comparable in all three
      treatment groups. Post-treatment H. pylori status was not dependent on those
      levels, or the drug-induced extent or duration of increased intragastric pH.
      However, H. pylori-eradicated patients were significantly (P < 0.05) older (56
      +/- 13 years) than patients still H. pylori-positive (47 +/- 14 years). In
      addition, in patients older than 50 years (n = 33), eradication was higher (P <
      0.01) than in patients (n = 25) below 50 years (65 vs. 24%). Eradication rate was
      highest (75-83%) in subgroups of patients (> 50 years and history of peptic ulcer
      or smokers). Neither activity/grade of peptic ulcer or erosive gastritis nor
      initial diagnosis were predictors for clinical outcome. CONCLUSION: The age of
      patients must be regarded as a major determinant of H. pylori eradication rate
      and may represent an important factor contributing to the highly variable
      clinical results.

TI  - Review article: current practice and future perspectives in the management of
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 651-62
AB  - Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is primarily due to incompetence of the 
      lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) and crural diaphragm, with transient LOS
      relaxation frequently accounting for daytime reflux. In the absence of drugs that
      adequately correct the motility defects of GERD, treatment is directed towards
      decreasing gastric acidity. Oesophageal healing is related to control of 24-h
      intragastric acidity, the degree of acid suppression and duration of treatment.
      H2-receptor antagonists are generally less effective in GERD than in peptic ulcer
      disease. While providing symptomatic relief in non-erosive GERD, they are often
      ineffective in healing erosive oesophagitis. Proton pump inhibitors provide more 
      rapid and complete healing and symptom resolution. They are superior to
      H2-receptor antagonists in the long-term management of erosive oesophagitis and
      in reducing recurrence of oesophageal stricture following mechanical dilatation. 
      In Barrett's oesophagus, high-dose proton pump inhibitors in combination with
      laser/photodynamic ablation therapy can produce metaplastic regression, although 
      this does not preclude future emergence of adenocarcinoma. Surgical morbidity and
      mortality rates in GERD generally remain higher than those associated with
      long-term pharmacotherapy. However, direct comparisons between laparascopic
      anti-reflux surgery and proton pump inhibitor maintenance therapy remain to be
      performed. Although there is no evidence that H. pylori infection worsens the
      severity of oesophagitis or that H. pylori is carcinogenic in the metaplastic
      oesophageal mucosa. It has been suggested that H. pylori-positive patients
      requiring long-term proton pump inhibitor therapy receive bacterial eradication
      therapy to reduce the risk of developing atrophic gastritis.

TI  - PCR-RFLP typing of ureC from Helicobacter pylori isolated from gastric biopsies
      during a European multi-country clinical trial.
PG  - 251-6
AB  - A multi-country clinical trial was conducted in ten European countries to
      determine the efficacy of clarithromycin-omeprazole dual therapy for treating
      Helicobacter pylori infection in peptic ulcers. Gastric biopsies were cultured
      for H. pylori before and after treatment. PCR-RFLP was used to determine the
      genetic heterogeneity of 100 H. pylori isolates from pretreatment and
      posttreatment biopsies. An 820 bp amplified fragment of the ureC gene was
      digested with the restriction enzymes Sau3A and Hhal. Fourteen different Sau3A
      patterns and 15 different Hhal patterns were identified among the pretreatment
      isolates. In combination, 42 different RFLP types were identified. Comparison of 
      isolates before treatment with those after treatment showed that five of ten
      patients on clarithromycin-omeprazole dual therapy had the same RFLP type and
      that all 12 patients on omeprazole therapy alone had the same RFLP type. All
      isolates were susceptible to clarithromycin prior to treatment, while seven of
      ten patients on clarithromycin-omeprazole therapy had H. pylori that was
      resistant to clarithromycin after therapy and 11 of 12 patients on omeprazole
      therapy had isolates susceptible to clarithromycin after treatment. In addition
      to PCR-RFLP typing, the presence of the cytotoxin-associated gene (cagA) and the 
      vacuolating gene (vacA) was determined; 79% of the isolates were cagA-positive
      and all were vacA-positive. The results of this study indicate that infection of 
      H. pylori in Europe is not restricted to a few RFLP types.

TI  - Enantioselective hydroxylation of omeprazole catalyzed by CYP2C19 in Swedish
      white subjects.
PG  - 129-37
AB  - Stereoselective disposition of omeprazole and its formed 5-hydroxy metabolite
      were studied in five poor metabolizers and five extensive metabolizers of
      S-mephenytoin. After a single oral dose of omeprazole (20 mg), the plasma
      concentrations of the separate enantiomers of the parent drug and the 5-hydroxy
      metabolite were determined for 10 hours after drug intake. In poor metabolizers, 
      the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve [AUC(0-8)] of
      (+)-omeprazole was larger and that of the 5-hydroxy metabolite of this enantiomer
      was smaller than the AUC(0-8) values in extensive metabolizers (p < 0.001). The
      mean AUC(0-8) of the (-)-enantiomer of omeprazole was also higher in poor
      metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers, but only 3.1-fold compared with
      7.5-fold for (+)-omeprazole. The rate of formation of the hydroxy metabolite from
      (-)-omeprazole was low and not significantly different in poor and extensive
      metabolizers. These results show that (+)-omeprazole is to a major extent
      hydroxylated by CYP2C19. Also (-)-omeprazole may partly be metabolized by this
      enzyme but is mainly metabolized by another enzyme, presumably CYP3A4, to the
      achiral sulfone metabolite. The plasma concentration ratio of omeprazole to
      5-hydroxyomeprazole obtained 3 hours after the drug intake has been used to
      distinguish between extensive and poor metabolizer phenotypes. With use of the
      ratio between the (+)-enantiomers of the parent drug and the metabolite, a better
      discrimination between phenotypes was obtained. The ratio between the
      (-)-enantiomers also separated the phenotypes but was less discriminatory. For
      the future, measurement of total concentrations will suffice for phenotyping.

TI  - Lifetime costs of surgical versus medical treatment of severe gastro-oesophageal 
      reflux disease in Finland.
PG  - 766-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) can be effectively treated
      pharmacologically or surgically. As GERD is often a chronic condition, we
      compared the long-term costs of medical and surgical management. METHODS: The
      medical regimens were ranitidine (150 or 300 mg/day), omeprazole (20 or 40
      mg/day), and lansoprazole (30 mg/day), with costs calculated for total life
      expectancy after diagnosis and for one-third of that time. Costs for open or
      laparoscopic surgery (Nissen fundoplication) included pre- and post-operative
      investigations, sick leave, and calculated financial loss due to fatal outcome.
      RESULTS: Costs were lowest with ranitidine, 150 mg/day, for one-third of the
      patient's lifetime and highest with lifelong omeprazole, 40 mg/daily. The cost of
      open or laparoscopic operation was less than that of lifelong daily treatment
      with proton pump inhibitors or ranitidine, 300 mg daily. CONCLUSION: In Finland, 
      antireflux surgery for GERD is cheaper than lifetime treatment with proton pump
      inhibitors.

TI  - Accuracy of invasive and noninvasive tests to diagnose Helicobacter pylori
      infection after antibiotic treatment.
PG  - 1268-74
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the diagnostic accuracy of the most widely available tests
      for diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection after antibiotic treatment.
      METHODS: A total of 59 H. pylori-positive, duodenal ulcer patients (mean age,
      40.7 +/- 11.7 yr; 40 male and 19 female) were treated for 2 wk with either
      amoxicillin-metronidazole (n = 36) or omeprazole-amoxicillin-tinidazole (n = 23),
      and after 4 wk, were tested for H. pylori infection by [14C]urea breath test
      (UBT), serum IgG antibody level, and multiple antral biopsies for rapid urease
      testing, histology, Warthin-Starry stain, and polymerase chain reaction to detect
      H. pylori DNA. Infection status was established by a concordance of test results.
      RESULTS: H. pylori was eradicated in 47 patients (80%). UBT and rapid urease
      testing had the best sensitivity and specificity, although not statistically
      different to Warthin-Starry stain and polymerase chain reaction. Serology and
      histology had little diagnostic value in this setting due to high proportion of
      false-positive results. CONCLUSIONS: Noninvasive UBT is as accurate in predicting
      H. pylori status after antibiotic treatment as rapid urease testing and
      Warthin-Starry stain. Especially for duodenal ulcer patients, UBT could be
      considered the gold standard to confirm eradication of H. pylori.

TI  - Guilty as charged: bugs and drugs in gastric ulcer.
PG  - 1255-61
AB  - Gastric ulcer disease remains a cause of hemorrhage, perforation, outlet
      obstruction, and death. Recent advances in the understanding of peptic ulcer
      disease indicate that infection with Helicobacter pylori and ingestion of
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the cause of almost all gastric
      and duodenal ulcers. Our therapy, therefore, is in a state of transition: the old
      acid-suppressive temporary therapy that allows frequent ulcer recurrences and
      complications is being replaced by curative therapies. The old therapy, by
      reducing gastric acid secretion or enhancing gastric mucosal defenses, inhibited 
      the cofactors needed for ulcer development. Acid suppression relieved symptoms
      and healed ulcers, while defense enhancers, such as prostaglandin analogs healed 
      and prevented acute NSAID-induced gastric ulcers. These benefits were maintained,
      however, only as long as acid-reducing agents or mucosal defense enhancers were
      continued. On the other hand, curative therapies (such as eradicating H. pylori
      infection and/or stopping the use of NSAIDs) eliminate the causes of ulcer.
      Curative combination regimens consisting of antibiotics, ranitidine bismuth
      citrate, bismuth, and proton pump inhibitors have been approved by the Food and
      Drug Administration. These new regimens can cure benign gastric ulcer.
      Unfortunately, we cannot always determine which gastric ulcers are benign, and
      concern about gastric cancer remains. All gastric ulcers therefore still require 
      biopsy and histological examination. With new treatment regimens, the time may be
      rapidly approaching when ulcer disease will be "history."

TI  - Lansoprazole potentiates vecuronium paralysis.
PG  - 422-3
AB  - The effect of lansoprazole, a newer second generation proton pump inhibitor, on
      vecuronium induced muscle paralysis was evaluated. Fifty adult patients
      comprising grade I (normal healthy patient) and grade II (patient with a mild
      systemic disease) as classified by the American Society of Anesthesiologists were
      randomly allocated into two different groups each consisting of 25 patients.
      Group I (control) did not receive lansoprazole and group II (study) received 30
      mg lansoprazole in the night before operation. There was no statistically
      significant difference (p > 0.05) in the time required for complete paralysis
      between group I (215.7 +/- 15.19 seconds) and group II (197.5 +/- 14.13 seconds).
      However, the duration of paralysis was significantly different (p < 0.05) between
      group I (32.7 +/- 8.7 minutes) and group II (43.9 +/- 9.3 minutes). It was
      concluded that there is a potential for interactions and one should carefully and
      closely monitor the patients to prevent prolonged paralysis in patients receiving
      lansoprazole, as a pre-anaesthetic medication.

TI  - Lansoprazole compared with histamine2-receptor antagonists in healing gastric
      ulcers: a meta-analysis.
PG  - 743-57
AB  - To compare the gastric ulcer healing rates of lansoprazole with
      histamine2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) (ranitidine, famotidine, cimetidine, and 
      roxatidine), a meta-analysis was performed using data from five published and
      eight unpublished randomized controlled trials. Analyses were performed using (1)
      both evaluable patients (n = 1527) and all randomized patients (n = 1655)
      (assuming that patients lost to follow-up were treatment failures); (2) all
      studies and a subset of studies that received high methodologic quality scores;
      and (3) fixed-effects, random-effects, and Bayesian statistical models. In all
      cases, lansoprazole was associated with a significantly higher rate of endoscopic
      healing at both 4 and 8 weeks compared with the H2RAs. When the most conservative
      Bayesian statistical model and intent-to-treat analysis were used, lansoprazole
      was associated with a 33% higher healing rate at 4 weeks (risk ratio = 1.33; 95% 
      confidence interval [CI] = 1.19 to 1.49) and a 12% higher healing rate at 8 weeks
      (risk ratio = 1.12; 95% CI = 1.06 to 1.19) than were the H2RA agents. Similar
      results were obtained when the meta-analysis was performed on evaluable rather
      than all randomized patients and using the three different analytical techniques 
      noted above. Slightly lower, though still highly significant, improvement in
      ulcer healing rates was obtained when the meta-analysis was performed using a
      subset of six studies that received high methodologic quality scores. These
      results support the conclusion that lansoprazole heals ulcers more quickly than
      do the H2RAs and also achieves higher overall rates of healing. The eradication
      of Helicobacter pylori associated with gastric ulcers was not assessed in
      individual studies.

PG  - 190-5
AB  - Beyond the obvious step of limiting use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
      (NSAIDs), the treatment of ulcers induced by NSAIDs remains controversial. We
      evaluated the efficacy of the proton-pump inhibitor lansoprazole on NSAID-induced
      ulcers. Ulcers were endoscopically diagnosed in 47 NSAID users. These patients
      received 30 mg/day lansoprazole, orally, for 6 or 8 weeks (6 weeks for duodenal
      ulcers and 8 weeks for other ulcers). Ulcer healing was assessed using an
      established classification system. The presence of immunoglobulin G antibody
      against Helicobacter pylori was also evaluated. The antibody was present in the
      sera of 51% of patients (24/47). Most of the ulcers reached scarring stages S1
      (healing) or S2 (good healing), and the S2 healing rate was 35%. Two H. pylori
      seropositive patients did not reach these stages; their ulcers were improved by
      H. pylori eradication therapy, followed, in one case, by medication with
      misoprostol. Lansoprazole seemed to be useful for most patients with
      NSAID-induced ulcers, but a few needed additional treatments.

TI  - Does treatment of Helicobacter pylori with antibiotics alone heal duodenal ulcer?
      A randomised double blind placebo controlled study.
PG  - 43-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection prevents duodenal ulcer
      relapse. It has not been established if treatment of the infection heals duodenal
      ulcer. AIM: To test the hypothesis that treatment of the infection was associated
      with healing of duodenal ulcer. METHODS: A randomised, double blind placebo
      controlled trial was performed to study the efficacy of an antibiotic only
      regimen consisting of 300 mg metronidazole, 500 mg amoxycillin, and 250 mg
      clarithromycin, each given four times daily for two weeks, in the healing of
      duodenal ulcer as assessed by endoscopy. Symptoms were controlled with
      acetaminophen and antacids. RESULTS: Of 100 consecutive patients with
      endoscopically established duodenal ulcer, 97 with positive rapid urease test on 
      antral biopsy specimens were admitted into the study and 81 completed the trial. 
      Of these, 40 were randomised to receive antibiotics and 41 to receive placebo.
      Treatment with antibiotics resulted in 92.5% (95% confidence interval (95% CI)
      84.3-100) healing at four weeks and 100% at eight and 12 weeks; the corresponding
      healing rates for placebo treatment were respectively, 36.6%, 61%, and 63.4% (95%
      CIs 21.8-51.3, 46.0-75.9, and 48.7-78.2 respectively). The differences between
      the two treatment groups were significant at p < 0.001 at each time point and by 
      life table analysis. Clearance of H pylori as assessed by urease test on antral
      biopsy specimens at four weeks and eradication of the organism as determined by
      13C-urea breath test at eight weeks were achieved in 85% and 62.5% of patients
      respectively. Duodenal ulcer healed at four weeks in 87.2% and 86.2% (95% CIs
      76.7-97.7 and 73.7-98.8) of patients in whom H pylori clearance or eradication,
      was achieved, versus 42.9% and 51.9% (95% CIs 27.9-57.8 and 38.3-65.5; p < 0.001 
      and < 0.003 respectively) in whom these processes failed. Stepwise discriminant
      analysis on 32 clinical, personal, and endoscopic characteristics as well as H
      pylori clearance and eradication identified H pylori clearance as the most
      discriminative variable for the healing of duodenal ulcer at four weeks, followed
      by ulcer depth and eradication of the organism. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with an
      antibiotic only regimen was effective for the healing of duodenal ulcer, and
      clearance as well as eradication of H pylori contributed significantly to the
      healing. The results constituted the strongest evidence to date that H pylori
      infection was aetiologically related to duodenal ulceration, and support the
      concept of treating duodenal ulcer associated with H pylori as an infection and
      relieving its symptoms with acid reducing agents such as antacids.

TI  - Current European concepts in the management of Helicobacter pylori infection. The
      Maastricht Consensus Report. European Helicobacter Pylori Study Group.
PG  - 8-13
AB  - There is considerable confusion over the management of Helicobacter pylori
      infection, particularly among primary care physicians, and numerous European
      countries lack national guidelines in this rapidly growing area of medicine. The 
      European Helicobacter Pylori Study Group therefore organised a meeting in
      Maastricht of H pylori experts, primary care physicians and representatives of
      National Societies of Gastroenterology from Europe to establish consensus
      guidelines on the management of H pylori at the primary care and specialist
      levels, and to consider general health care issues associated with the infection.
      As in previous guidelines, eradication therapy was recommended in all H pylori
      positive patients with peptic ulcer disease. Additionally, at the primary care
      level in dyspeptic patients < 45 years old and with no alarm symptoms, diagnosis 
      is recommended by non-invasive means (13C urea breath test, serology) and if H
      pylori positive the patient should be treated. Moreover, at the specialist level 
      the indications for eradication of H pylori were also broadened to include H
      pylori positive patients with functional dyspepsia in whom no other possible
      causes of symptoms are identified by the specialist (after a full investigation
      including endoscopy, ultrasound and other necessary investigations), patients
      with low grade gastric mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma (managed
      in specialised centres) and those with gastritis with severe macro- or
      microscopic abnormalities. There was consensus that treatment regimens should be 
      simple, well tolerated and achieve an eradication rate of over 80% on an
      intention to treat basis. It was strongly recommended, therefore, that
      eradication treatment should be with proton pump inhibitor based triple therapy
      for seven days, using a proton pump inhibitor and two of the following:
      clarithromycin, a nitroimidazole (metronidazole or tinidazole) and amoxycillin.

PG  - 530-2
AB  - The influence of the proton pump inhibitor lansoprazole on strain diversity in
      Helicobacter pylori infected patients was investigated. Multiple isolates of
      Helicobacter pylori obtained pre- and post-therapy from gastric antral and body
      biopsies in 22 patients were compared using the random amplified polymorphic
      DNA-polymerase chain reaction (RAPD-PCR) for analysis. Post-therapy strains
      exhibiting novel RAPD-profiles were found in 5 of 22 patients (4 of 11 patients
      treated with lansoprazole alone and 1 of 11 patients treated with lansoprazole
      plus amoxicillin). Proton pump inhibition may affect the microecology of the
      stomach by influencing the colonisation patterns of specific strains.

TI  - Maintenance treatment for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. A placebo-controlled
      evaluation of 10 milligrams omeprazole once daily in general practice.
PG  - 627-32
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is a frequent cause for
      consultation in general practice and is a chronically relapsing disease. METHODS:
      This general practice study was a 6-month randomized, double-blind parallel-group
      placebo-controlled assessment of the efficacy and safety of continuous treatment 
      with 10 mg omeprazole every morning after initial symptom control in 495 patients
      with GORD but without erosive oesophagitis. RESULTS: On the basis of life-table
      estimates for cumulative relapse rates, patients in the placebo group (52%) were 
      almost twice as likely as those in the omeprazole group (27%) to discontinue
      therapy before 24 weeks because of inadequate relief of heartburn or for other
      reasons including adverse events (all-patients-treated analysis, log rank test, P
      = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that 10 mg omeprazole once daily is 
      an effective and well-tolerated treatment strategy in general practice for the
      long-term management of symptoms of GORD in patients without erosive
      oesophagitis.

TI  - Eradication of H. pylori in a developing country: comparison of lansoprazole
      versus omeprazole with norfloxacin, in a dual-therapy study.
PG  - 1140-2
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Lansoprazole, a newer benzimidazole, is more potent than omeprazole
      in its anti-Helicobacter pylori effect in vitro. The present study was aimed at
      assessing its efficacy in a developing country. METHODS: Fifty patients were
      randomized to receive either lansoprazole or omeprazole, with norfloxacin for 2
      wk; the ulcer healing rates, H. pylori eradication rates, and recurrence rates
      were compared over a 6-month period. RESULTS: Both lansoprazole and omeprazole
      were equally effective in inducing healing of ulcer (96.1 vs 95.5%, p > 0.05) and
      eradicating H. pylori (76.9 vs 63.9%, p > 0.05), with very low recurrence rates
      over a 6-month follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: Either lansoprazole or omeprazole
      combined with norfloxacin is effective in eradicating H. pylori in a high
      percentage of cases of duodenal ulcer, with little difference between the two
      proton pump inhibitors.

TI  - Omeprazole-based dual and triple therapy for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori
      infection in peptic ulcer disease: a randomized trial.
PG  - 92-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: It was our goal to evaluate the efficacy and safety and patient
      compliance with omeprazole-based dual and triple therapy for eradication of
      Helicobacter pylori in peptic ulcer disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred
      seventy-five consecutive patients with H. pylori infection and associated active 
      peptic ulcer were included. H. pylori infection was assessed by rapid urease test
      and histological analysis. Patients were randomized among three treatments: group
      1 (56 patients): omeprazole, 20 mg bid, and amoxicillin, 1 gm bid, for 2 weeks;
      group 2 (61 patients): omeprazole, 20 mg bid, plus amoxicillin, 1 gm bid, and
      metronidazole, 500 mg bid, for 1 week; and group 3 (58 patients): omeprazole, 20 
      mg bid, plus amoxicillin, 1 gm bid, and clarithromycin, 500 mg bid, for 1 week.
      Ulcer healing and cure of infection were evaluated at 4 to 6 weeks after
      cessation of therapy. Eradication rate was calculated per-protocol and by an
      intention-to-treat analysis. RESULTS: At posttreatment endoscopy, duodenal ulcer 
      was healed in 98.3% of patients. Eleven patients (6%) were lost to follow-up. H. 
      pylori infection was treated successfully in 55% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 
      41%-69%) of patients of group 1; 86% (95% CI = 77%-95%) of group 2 (p < .001 vs. 
      group 1); and 93% (95% CI = 85%-100%) of group 3 (p < .001 vs. group 1). On
      intention-to-treat analysis, eradication was 52%, 80%, and 86% in groups 1, 2,
      and 3, respectively. A good compliance was observed in more than 90% of patients 
      of all groups. Side effects were reported by 7% of patients in group 1, 9% in
      group 2, and 11% in group 3. None of the patients stopped therapy because of side
      effects. CONCLUSIONS: Dual-therapy omeprazole-amoxicillin for 2 weeks is
      associated with significantly lower eradication rate than is 1-week
      omeprazole-based triple therapies. Triple therapy is well-tolerated and produces 
      side effects similar to those of dual therapy. The highest cure rate of H. pylori
      infection was achieved with triple therapy of omeprazole, amoxicillin, and
      clarithromycin for 1 week.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori eradication--comparison of three drug regimens and
      symptomatic assessment in duodenitis and antral gastritis.
PG  - 214-6
AB  - Helicobacter pylori (Hp) eradication in peptic ulcer disease is associated with a
      greatly reduced recurrence rate. The optimal drug regimen for HP eradication
      remains uncertain. It is also unclear if eradication of Hp in duodenitis and
      antral gastritis improves symptoms. The aims of this study were to compare the
      efficacy of three drug regimens in the eradication of Hp and to assess if Hp
      eradication improved symptoms in patients with duodenitis and antral gastritis.
      Patients (n = 79) found to have duodenal ulcer, duodenitis and/or antral
      gastritis with a positive urease test (CLO) at endoscopy were allocated to one of
      the three regimens: A. omeprazole 20 mg b.d. and clarithromycin 500 mg t.d.s. for
      two weeks (n = 27), B. De-Nol 240 mg b.d. for four weeks, metronidazole 400 mg
      t.d.s. and amoxicillin 500 mg t.d.s. for one week (n = 26), and C. omeprazole 20 
      mg b.d. and amoxicillin 500 mg t.d.s. for two weeks (n = 26). In conclusion,
      traditional 'triple' therapy with bismuth and two antibiotics achieved the
      highest Hp eradication rate and was best tolerated. Recolonisation with Hp was
      uncommon after eradication. Dyspeptic symptoms improved with Hp eradication in
      duodenitis and antral gastritis.

      g, and omeprazole, 80 or 120 mg: a prospective randomized trial.
PG  - 593-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The appropriate dose of proton pump inhibitors needed for eradicating
      Helicobacter pylori by dual therapy is still controversial. DESIGN: The study was
      conducted as a single-blind, single-centre trial. METHODS: Fifty-four patients
      with active duodenal ulcers were treated with amoxycillin tablets, 750 mg three
      times daily, and omeprazole, either 40 mg twice daily (group 1) or 40 mg three
      times daily (group 2), for 14 days in a prospective randomized trial. H. pylori
      eradication was assessed 10 weeks after starting treatment. Biopsies were taken
      for rapid urease tests and histological analysis and 13C-urea breath tests were
      ordered. RESULTS: In both groups ulcer healing was complete in 96.3% of patients 
      after 10 weeks. Ten weeks after starting treatment, Helicobacter pylori was
      eradicated in 76.9% of the patients in group 1 and 74.1% of those in group 2, as 
      shown by rapid urease tests and histological analysis. In the subgroup of fully
      compliant patients (n = 49) the eradication rates were 80% and 79.2%,
      respectively. Hyperacidity significantly reduced the eradication rates. Patients 
      showing successful H. pylori eradication were significantly older (59 +/- 14.0
      years vs. 49 +/- 15.6 years; P = 0.025). Eradication rates were lower in smokers 
      than in non-smokers (36.4% vs. 83.9%; P = 0.006). CONCLUSION: It is concluded
      that higher omeprazole doses should be reserved for younger patients and smokers;
      in others they are not needed.

TI  - Low cure rate of Helicobacter pylori infection with omeprazole and furazolidone
      dual therapy for one week.
PG  - 533-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Furazolidone is an inexpensive antibiotic that has considerable
      anti-Helicobacter pylori activity in vitro. METHODS: Twenty-three patients with
      culture-proven H. pylori infection were treated for one week with a dual therapy 
      containing omeprazole and furazolidone. RESULTS: Eradication succeeded in 10 of
      the first 20 evaluable patients (50%; 95% CI: 27.2-72.8%). This percentage was
      regarded as too low, and the study was terminated. Side-effects were mild.
      CONCLUSION: With the possible increase in resistance to metronidazole and
      clarithromycin world-wide, furazolidone may be useful alternative in the
      treatment of H. pylori infection. Dual therapy for one week, however, is not
      sufficient.

TI  - Doubling the omeprazole dose (40 mg b.d. vs. 20 mg b.d.) in dual therapy with
      amoxycillin increases the cure rate of Helicobacter pylori infection in duodenal 
      ulcer patients.
PG  - 515-22
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have shown that dual therapy with omeprazole and
      amoxycillin may cure Helicobacter pylori infection. However, the optimum dose of 
      omeprazole has still to be established. METHODS: An international, randomized,
      double-blind multicentre trial was conducted in patients with duodenal ulcers to 
      compare the H. pylori cure rates obtained by dual therapy consisting of either
      omeprazole 20 mg b.d. plus amoxycillin 750 mg b.d. or omeprazole 40 mg b.d. plus 
      amoxycillin 750 mg b.d. for 2 weeks. Dual therapy was followed by omeprazole 20
      mg once daily for 2 weeks. Before entering the trial and 4 weeks after cessation 
      of treatment H. pylori infection was assessed by histology and a 13C-urea breath 
      test. RESULTS: 381 patients were randomized into the study, of whom 345 were
      evaluable for the all-patients-treated analysis of efficacy and 378 were valid
      for the evaluation of safety. Histology results showed that H. pylori infection
      was cured in 64 out 174 patients treated with omeprazole 20 mg b.d. plus
      amoxycillin and in 102 out of 171 patients treated with omeprazole 40 mg b.d.
      plus amoxycillin (37% vs. 60%; P < 0.001). Both treatment regimens were well
      tolerated, with adverse events reported by 29 (15.2%) and 35 patients (18.7%),
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that dual therapy with
      amoxycillin 750 mg b.d. and omeprazole 40 mg b.d. is superior to dual therapy
      with amoxycillin and omeprazole 20 mg b.d. in patients with H. pylori-positive
      duodenal ulcers. Thus, a true dose-response relationship exists between
      omeprazole and treatment success. However, a combination of omeprazole with two
      of amoxycillin, clarithromycin and nitroimidazole is a preferable alternative for
      routine clinical use.

TI  - Maintenance therapy with cisapride after healing of erosive oesophagitis: a
      double-blind placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 487-95
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are few data on the role of prokinetic agents as maintenance
      therapy in moderately severe reflux oesophagitis despite the high relapse rate of
      this condition after healing. AIMS: To determine whether cisapride is more
      effective than placebo as maintenance therapy after healing of moderate erosive
      oesophagitis in two respects: first, in preventing symptomatic relapse and
      preserving quality of life; and, second, in improving oesophageal motor function.
      PATIENTS: Forty-two patients whose grade II-III oesophagitis had been healed with
      omeprazole were randomized to receive either cisapride 20 mg nocte or placebo for
      6 months. Oesophageal pH monitoring and manometry were performed before starting 
      maintenance therapy and after 4 weeks, and symptomatic status and quality of life
      were assessed at weeks 0, 4, 13 and 26. RESULTS: After 4 weeks of maintenance
      therapy, lower oesophageal sphincter pressure improved in the cisapride group
      (16.4-21.9 mmHg, P = 0.01) but not in the placebo group (25.5-22.7 mmHg, P =
      0.2). Oesophageal pH monitoring showed no significant changes in either group.
      Sixteen (76%) cisapride patients and 12 (57%) placebo patients withdrew within 4 
      weeks owing to symptomatic relapse (P = 0.2). After 26 weeks, 21 (100%) cisapride
      and 17 (81%) placebo patients had relapsed (log-rank analysis of survival time P 
      = 0.07). Quality of life parameters deteriorated in both treatment groups to a
      similar degree. CONCLUSION: Maintenance therapy with cisapride 20 mg nocte
      improves the lower oesophageal sphincter pressure in patients whose oesophagitis 
      has been healed with omeprazole. However, cisapride is no better than placebo in 
      preventing symptomatic relapse or deterioration in quality of life.

TI  - Peptic ulcer perforation before and after the introduction of H2-receptor
      blockers and proton pump inhibitors.
PG  - 523-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this retrospective study was to compare patients treated
      for perforated peptic ulcer before and after the introduction of the H2-receptor 
      antagonists and proton pump inhibitors (PPI) with regard to their medical
      history, clinical features, methods of diagnosis and treatment, complications,
      and mortality. METHODS AND RESULTS: During the study period 1974 to 1992 we found
      a significant reduction in the incidence of peptic ulcer perforation (P < 0.001).
      Patients admitted during the later period of the study were older and more
      seriously ill. The incidence of perforation among men decreased, but that among
      women was stable, thus changing the sex ratio towards a female preponderance at
      the end of the study period. After the introduction of PPI the relative number of
      gastric perforations decreased compared with the number of perforations in the
      duodenum. A relatively higher proportion of patients with gastric perforations
      was taking acetylsalicylic acid or non-steroid, anti-inflammatory drugs at the
      time of admission compared with patients with duodenal perforation. Simple suture
      of the perforation was the operative procedure used in 80% of the patients.
      CONCLUSIONS: Even though patients were increasingly older and more ill, neither
      the mortality nor the rate of postoperative complications changed during the
      study period.

AB  - This article deals with the nonpulmonary, non-infectious complications in
      intermediate and long-term survivors of lung transplantation. Although they are
      an infrequent cause of mortality, these disorders can cause significant morbidity
      in this population. Diseases associated with the gamut of medications used
      post-transplant are specifically discussed, as are diseases caused by the direct 
      immunosuppressive action of some of these drugs. General care of transplant
      patients also entails attention to their underlying diseases, and to routine
      medical considerations common to all patients.

TI  - Speed of healing and symptom relief in grade II to IV gastroesophageal reflux
      disease: a meta-analysis.
PG  - 1798-810
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Esophagitis healing proportions are often incorrectly called
      the healing rate. The aim of this study was to compare different drug classes by 
      expressing the speed of healing and symptom relief through a new approach.
      METHODS: A fully recursive literature search to July 1996 identified 43 articles 
      on gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) (7635 patients) meeting strict
      inclusion criteria: single- or double-blind randomized studies in adults with
      endoscopically proven erosive or ulcerative esophagitis. For each drug class,
      linear regression analysis estimated the average percentage of patients who were 
      healed and heartburn free per week. RESULTS: Mean overall healing proportion
      irrespective of drug dose or treatment duration (< or =12 weeks) was highest with
      proton pump inhibitors (PPIs; 83.6% +/- 11.4%) vs. H2-receptor antagonists
      (H2RAs; 51.9% +/- 17.1%), sucralfate (39.2% +/- 22.4%), or placebo (28.2% +/-
      15.6%). Correcting for patients without baseline heartburn, the mean
      heartburn-free proportion was highest with PPIs (77.4% +/- 10.4%) vs. H2RAs
      (47.6% +/- 15.5%). PPIs showed a significantly faster healing rate (11.7%/wk) vs.
      H2RAs (5.9%/wk) and placebo (2.9%/wk). PPIs provided faster, more complete
      heartburn relief (11.5%/wk) vs. H2RAs (6.4%/wk). CONCLUSIONS: More complete
      esophagitis healing and heartburn relief is observed with PPIs vs. H2RAs and
      occurs nearly twice as fast. This semiquantitative expression of speed of healing
      and symptom relief permits comparisons for future economic evaluation and
      quality-of-life assessments.

TI  - A critical appraisal of current management practices for infant regurgitation.
PG  - 187-202
AB  - Regurgitation is a common manifestation in infants below the age of one year and 
      a frequent reason of counseling of general practitioners and paediatricians.
      Current management starts with postural and dietary measures, followed by
      antacids and prokinetics. Recent issues such as an increased risk of sudden
      infant death in the prone sleeping position and persistent occult
      gastro-oesophageal reflux in a subset of infants receiving milk thickeners or
      thickened "anti-regurgitation formula" challenge the established approach.
      Therefore, the clinical practices for management of infant regurgitation have
      been critically evaluated with respect to their efficacy, safety and practical
      implications. The updated recommendations on the management of infant
      regurgitation contain 5 phases: (1A) parental reassurance; (1B) milk-thickening
      agents; (2) prokinetics; (3) positional therapy as an adjuvant therapy; (4A)
      H2-blockers; (4B) proton pump inhibitors; (5) surgery.

TI  - Pantoprazole-based dual and triple therapy for the eradication of Helicobacter
      pylori infection: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 886-90
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The eradication of Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection in
      duodenal ulcer and dyspepsia has been achieved using various therapy regimens.
      The efficacy of protein pump inhibitor pantoprazole as part of these regimens has
      not been widely studied. METHODOLOGY: During a prospective randomized trial, 250 
      Hp positive patients with either duodenal ulcer, erosive bulbitis, or gastritis
      and dyspepsia were treated using 14 days of therapy 1) pantoprazole 40 mg daily
      and clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d. (PC), 2) pantoprazole 40 mg daily and
      clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d. plus amoxicillin 1 g b.i.d. (PCA), or 3) bismuth
      subcitrate 120 mg t.i.d., roxithromycin 150 mg b.i.d., metronidazole 250 mg
      b.i.d. plus ranitidin 300 mg (BRMR). Hp status was assessed on 3 tests at the
      inclusion (2-specimen rapid urease test, 2-specimen histology, serology) and 2
      tests (2-specimen rapid urease test, 2-specimen histology) 4 weeks after the end 
      of the treatment. RESULTS: The entry criteria was fulfilled in 250 patients, of
      whom 13 missed the control endoscopy. The treatment had to be discontinued for
      adverse effects in 8 (10%) BRMR patients, and 1 (1%) PCA patients. Compliance was
      100% in the PC group. All ulcers were healed at the end of the study with one
      exception in the BRMR group. The best eradication rate of Hp was shown by the PCA
      group with 94.8% (n = 73/77) followed by the PC group with 82.5% (n = 66/80) and 
      finally the BRMR with 67.6% (n = 48/71)-PCA:BRMR - p < 0.001; PC:BRMR-p < 0.001; 
      PCA:PC-p < 0.05. CONCLUSION: This study showed that triple therapy using PPI
      pantoprazole combined with antibiotics clarithromycin and amoxicillin was very
      effective in the eradication of Hp and treatment of duodenal ulcer with rare side
      effects. The dual pantoprazole and clarithromycin therapy had the highest rate of
      patient compliance, but is less effective than triple therapy. The combination of
      ranitidin with bismuth based triple therapy had the highest number of adverse
      events and the lowest rate of Hp eradication and therefore, should not be
      recommended.

AB  - BACKGROUND: At least 10-15% of patients with reflux symptoms have a normal
      endoscopy and physiological levels of acid reflux on pH monitoring. Such patients
      with 50% or more of symptoms associated with acid reflux episodes have "a
      positive symptom index" (SI), and it has been proposed that this defines the
      "sensitive oesophagus". AIM: To test the response to omeprazole 20 mg twice daily
      for four weeks of patients with normal levels of acid reflux using a randomised, 
      placebo controlled, double blind, cross-over design. PATIENTS: Eighteen patients 
      with normal levels of reflux, 12 of whom had a positive SI. METHODS: Response was
      measured by symptomatic assessment and the SF-36 quality of life (QOL)
      questionnaire. RESULTS: Patients with a positive SI showed the following
      improvements on omeprazole compared with placebo: decrease in symptom frequency
      (p < 0.01), severity (p < 0.01) and consumption of antacids (p < 0.01). In the
      group with a negative SI only one patient clearly improved. The QOL parameters
      for bodily pain (65.6 v 53.4, p = 0.03) and vitality (60.6 v 48.8, p = 0.049)
      were significantly better on omeprazole than placebo for the group overall.
      CONCLUSION: Omeprazole improves symptoms in 11 of 18 patients with normal
      endoscopy and pH monitoring, particularly those with a positive SI. This supports
      the theory that such patients have an oesophagus which is "sensitive" to acid
      reflux and are part of the GORD spectrum.

TI  - Effects of long-term treatment with lansoprazole and omeprazole on serum gastrin 
      and the fundic mucosa.
PG  - 347-56
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of long-term lansoprazole and omeprazole
      treatment (6 months) on serum gastrin levels. PATIENTS: Forty duodenal ulcer
      patients without previous treatment with proton pump inhibitors were randomized
      to receive either 20 mg/day or omeprazole or 30 mg/day of lansoprazole. Serum
      gastrin levels were determined on entry and every 2 months. On finalizing the
      study antral and fundic biopsies were obtained for immunohistochemical analysis
      of the enterochromaffin-like cell population. RESULTS: Before starting the
      treatment fasting serum gastrin was similar in both groups (108.7 +/- 60.9 pg/mL 
      omeprazole; 102.7 +/- 56.9 pg/mL lansoprazole). The treatment with either
      omeprazole or lansoprazole increased serum gastrin levels, but the increase was
      mild, maximal at 2 months and similar between omeprazole and lansoprazole (113.44
      +/- 114.9 pg/mL omeprazole vs 166.1 +/- 117.9 pg/mL lansoprazole; p > 0.05). When
      serum gastrin levels were individually analyzed by patient, most were below 200
      pg/mL and only 3 patients (1 omeprazole/2 lansoprazole) had levels near 500 pg/mL
      which were not correlated with enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia.
      CONCLUSIONS: Long-term treatment with either omeprazole or lansoprazole is safe, 
      at least during 6 months, and results in mild hypergastrinemia. No differences
      between these two drugs were observed.

TI  - Efficacy of a pectin-based anti-reflux agent on acid reflux and recurrence of
      symptoms and oesophagitis in gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 509-14
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease may be treated with a drug forming a
      floating neutral raft in the stomach. The pectin-based raft-forming anti-reflux
      agent Aflurax (Idoflux) was examined, first regarding reduction of oesophageal
      acid exposure, and next as to its efficacy as maintenance treatment in patients
      with healed oesophagitis. DESIGN: Double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized
      clinical trials. SETTING: Open access endoscopy unit. PARTICIPANTS: Fourteen
      patients with erosive oesophagitis had measurement of acid exposure. Eighty-eight
      patients with healed erosive/ulcerative oesophagitis and relief of heartburn
      after pre-treatment with omeprazole received maintenance treatment.
      INTERVENTIONS: Crossover 12-h oesophageal pH monitoring during Aflurax/placebo
      treatment. Maintenance treatment for up to 6 months with two tablets of Aflurax
      1200 mg or placebo four times daily. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Percentage time pH
      less than 4 in 6 plus 6 h (upright + supine). Time to recurrence of moderate or
      severe heartburn (life table analysis). RESULTS: The median (interquartile range)
      acid exposure times in the upright position were: 3.1% (1.6-13.0%) on Aflurax
      versus 6.7% (2.5-14.9%) on placebo (P = 0.10). In the supine position no
      difference was found (Aflurax 13.7%, placebo 13.2%). The time to recurrence of
      heartburn with Aflurax treatment was prolonged significantly; after 6 months the 
      life table estimates were 48% of patients in remission on Aflurax versus 8% on
      placebo (P = 0.01). Following treatment, erosive oesophagitis was found in 17/34 
      on Aflurax versus 28/38 on placebo (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Aflurax significantly 
      delays recurrence of moderate or severe heartburn and erosive oesophagitis, when 
      used as maintenance treatment. The acid exposure was not significantly reduced
      with pH monitoring.

TI  - A critical appraisal of current management practices for infant
      regurgitation--recommendations of a working party.
PG  - 343-57
AB  - Regurgitation is a common manifestation in infants below the age of 1 year and a 
      frequent reason of counselling of general practitioners and paediatricians.
      Current management starts with postural and dietary measures, followed by
      antacids and prokinetics. Recent issues such as an increased risk of sudden
      infant death in the prone sleeping position and persistent occult
      gastro-oesophageal reflux in a subset of infants receiving milk thickeners or
      thickened "anti-regurgitation formula" challenge the established approach.
      Therefore, the clinical practices for management of infant regurgitation have
      been critically evaluated with respect to their efficacy, safety and practical
      implications. The updated recommendations reached by the working party on the
      management of infant regurgitation contain five phases: (1 A) parental
      reassurance; (1 B) milk-thickening agents; (2) prokinetics; (3) positional
      therapy as an adjuvant therapy; (4 A) H2-blockers; (4 B) proton pump inhibitors; 
      (5) surgery.

TI  - Incidence of antireflux surgery in Finland 1988-1993. Influence of proton-pump
      inhibitors and laparoscopic technique.
PG  - 415-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The advent of proton-pump inhibitors, and subsequently of the
      laparoscopic technique, can be assumed to have influenced the use of antireflux
      surgery in gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. METHODS: Data on antireflux
      operations carried out in Finland in 1988-93 were obtained from national
      statistics, and the number of operations performed laparoscopically in 1993 was
      ascertained by a questionnaire to all relevant units. The rates per 100,000
      population in the catchment areas were calculated. RESULTS: Antireflux surgery
      almost always implied fundoplication. During 1993, 784 fundoplications and 43
      other antireflux procedures were performed in Finland (total population around 5 
      million). The fundoplication rate per 100,000 population rose from 8.8 to 15.4
      between 1988 and 1993. The increase was minimal (8.1-8.2) in 1990-91 when the
      first proton-pump inhibitor, omeprazole, was introduced, but remarkably greater
      (12.8-15.4) in 1992-93, when the laparoscopic technique became popular.
      Differences in fundoplication rates were six to tenfold between health service
      districts and even larger between hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: The numbers of
      antireflux operations in Finland were almost static when proton-pump inhibitors
      were introduced, but rapidly increased after the advent of the laparoscopic
      technique. Remarkable discrepancies were found in the incidence of fundoplication
      between different areas and hospitals.

TI  - An objective end point for dilation improves outcome of peptic esophageal
      strictures: a prospective randomized trial.
PG  - 354-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The usual end point for defining success of dilation is subjective
      (relief of dysphagia). In most patents thus managed strictures recur. We asked
      whether an objective end point would improve outcome. METHODS: After dilation to 
      15 mm, patients were randomized into subjective and objective groups. In
      subjective group patients, end point for dilation was alleviation of dysphagia;
      in objective group patients, passing the 12 mm barium pill test. Objective group 
      patients who failed underwent redilation until they passed the pill or failed
      three times. During Part 1 of the study, patients received ranitidine, during
      Part 2 they received omeprazole. RESULTS: In part 1, dysphagia was alleviated in 
      7 of 8 subjective group patients. Only 2 of 10 objective group patients passed
      the pill test and no additional patients passed after 3 sessions, although most
      had no dysphagia. In Part 2, 19 subjective groups and 15 objective group patients
      were studied. End point was not achieved in 3 objective group patients. Over
      long-term follow-up, objective group patients had less recurrent dysphagia (p =
      0.02) and required fewer redilation sessions (p < 0.05). Overall, the pill test
      correlated with the presence or absence of dysphagia (P < 0.001). Predictive
      value of passing the pill 1 week after dilation for the absence of dysphagia was 
      100%, but of failing the pill test and the presence of dysphagia was only 18%.
      CONCLUSIONS: Achieving an objective end point reduces stricture recurrence and
      the need for subsequent dilation. Initial subjective improvement does not predict
      long-term success.

TI  - Does pretreatment with omeprazole decrease the chance of eradication of
      Helicobacter pylori in peptic ulcer patients?
PG  - 790-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: It has been reported that pretreatment with omeprazole could decrease 
      the efficacy of Helicobacter pylori eradication. Our aim was to compare the
      efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the eradicating regimen,
      omeprazole/amoxicillin/metronidazole. The two antibiotics were scheduled either
      during the first or during the last 2 wk of omeprazole administration. METHODS:
      In this prospective controlled study conducted in a single center, 78 symptomatic
      peptic ulcer patients were treated for 4 wk with omeprazole 40 mg o.m.; the
      patients were randomly assigned to receive amoxicillin 1 g t.i.d. postprandially 
      and metronidazole 250 mg t.i.d. postprandially, either during the first 2 wk
      (group A, n = 40) or the last 2 wk of therapy with omeprazole (group B, n = 38). 
      H. pylori status was assessed by culture, histology, urease test, and IgG
      antibodies. Each patient's course was followed for 1 yr. RESULTS: H. pylori
      infection was cured in 97.4% of group A (95% CI: 0.84-0.99) and in 89% of group B
      (95% CI: 0.73-0.96, p = 0.28). Healing was achieved in 80% of the patients in
      group A (95% CI: 0.63-0.90) and in 75.7% of patients in group B (95% CI:
      0.60-0.90, p = 0.60) At 12-month follow-up, 72 patients were evaluated: 37/38
      (97%) of patients in group A and 33/33 (100%) in group B were confirmed as cured 
      of the infection (NS). Peptic ulcer healing rate reached 100% in the two groups. 
      Furthermore, between the two groups, there were no significant differences in
      symptom relief or improvement. Both regimens were well tolerated, and no patient 
      had to be withdrawn from therapy because of an adverse event. Minor side-effects 
      appeared to be similar in the two groups (40% vs. 38%). CONCLUSIONS: This
      randomized study clearly indicates that omeprazole pretreatment does not
      significantly reduce the efficacy of eradicating therapy for H. pylori in peptic 
      ulcer patients.

TI  - Laparoscopic treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 434-40
AB  - Laparoscopic fundoplication is technically feasible in treating gastroesophageal 
      reflux disease (GERD). Although medication is the primary treatment for GERD, not
      all patients respond completely or are able to adhere to a medical regimen. In
      the present series, 59 patients were laparoscopically treated for GERD at three
      centers using a standardized technique. All patients had been medically treated
      prior to referral, although 84 per cent had heartburn and 2 per cent had
      laryngitis despite 20 to 40 mg/day of omeprazole. Fifteen per cent of patients
      were intolerant of or would no longer take omeprazole. Patients were evaluated by
      esophageal manometry (in 100%) and 24-hour pH studies (in 66%). Seventy-six per
      cent of patients had lower-esophageal sphincter pressure <15 mm Hg. Five patients
      had low esophageal body peristaltic pressures (<35 mm Hg). These patients
      underwent Toupet partial fundoplication, whereas 54 patients underwent Nissen
      fundoplication. Mean operative time was 158 +/- 7 minutes, and three patients
      (5%) were converted to an open procedure. Operative complications were minor and 
      occurred in 13 per cent. In 45 patients evaluated 1 year after surgery, heartburn
      had resolved in 98 per cent. Thirty-nine of 56 patients (70%) had mild early (<1 
      month postoperatively) dysphagia, and 9 (19%) had severe early dysphagia, which
      improved in 7 after nonoperative dilatation. Two of these had continued mild
      dysphagia. Two patients had severe dysphagia and were laparoscopically converted 
      from Nissen to Toupet fundoplications, which resulted in marked improvement.
      Early gas bloat symptoms occurred in 45 per cent and dropped to 5 per cent at 1
      year. Laparoscopic treatment of GERD is safe and effective in preventing reflux
      symptoms. Although mild dysphagia occurs after the procedure, this is transient
      in most patients. Patients with severe dysphagia can be treated with nonoperative
      dilatation or laparoscopic partial fundoplication and maintain the antireflux
      characteristics of the wrap.

TI  - A comparison of omeprazole and placebo for bleeding peptic ulcer.
PG  - 1054-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of medical treatment for patients with bleeding peptic
      ulcers is uncertain. METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled
      trial in 220 patients with duodenal, gastric, or stomal ulcers and signs of
      recent bleeding, as confirmed by endoscopy. In 26 patients the ulcers showed
      arterial spurting, in 34 there was active oozing, in 35 there were nonbleeding,
      visible vessels, and in 125 there were adherent clots. The patients were randomly
      assigned to receive omeprazole (40 mg given orally every 12 hours for five days) 
      or placebo. The outcome measures studied were further bleeding, surgery, and
      death. RESULTS: Twelve of the 110 patients treated with omeprazole (10.9 percent)
      had continued bleeding or further bleeding, as compared with 40 of the 110
      patients who received placebo (36.4 percent) (P<0.001). Eight patients in the
      omeprazole group and 26 in the placebo group required surgery to control their
      bleeding (P<0.001). Two patients in the omeprazole group and six in the placebo
      group died. Thirty-two patients in the omeprazole group (29.1 percent) and 78 in 
      the placebo group (70.9 percent) received transfusions (P<0.001). A subgroup
      analysis showed that omeprazole was associated with significant reductions in
      recurrent bleeding and surgery in patients with nonbleeding, visible vessels or
      adherent clots, but not in those with arterial spurting or oozing. CONCLUSIONS:
      In patients with bleeding peptic ulcers and signs of recent bleeding, treatment
      with omeprazole decreases the rate of further bleeding and the need for surgery.

TI  - Daily omeprazole surpasses intermittent dosing in preventing relapse of
      oesophagitis: a US multi-centre double-blind study.
PG  - 373-80
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Relapse of erosive oesophagitis occurs in almost all patients if
      treatment is stopped after initial healing. AIM: To assess the potential of
      different therapeutic regimens of omeprazole to prevent relapse of erosive reflux
      oesophagitis after initial healing with omeprazole. PATIENTS AND METHODS:
      Patients whose active erosive reflux oesophagitis (grade > or = 2) had healed
      (grade 0 or 1) after 4-8 weeks of open-label omeprazole 40 mg daily (phase I)
      were eligible to join a multi-centre, 6-month double-blind, placebo-controlled
      maintenance study (phase II), which included endoscopy, symptom assessments,
      serum gastrin measurements, and gastric fundic biopsies. During phase I,
      endoscopy was performed at weeks 0, 4, and 8. At the end of phase I, 429 of 472
      patients (91%) were healed, and there were significant reductions in heartburn,
      dysphagia and acid regurgitation. Of the 429 patients who healed, 406 joined
      phase II and were randomized to one of three groups: 20 mg omeprazole daily (n = 
      138), 20 mg omeprazole for 3 consecutive days each week (n = 137), or placebo (n 
      = 131). During phase II, endoscopy was performed at months 1, 3, and 6 or at
      symptomatic relapse. RESULTS: The percentages of patients still in endoscopic
      remission at 6 months were 11% for placebo, 34% for omeprazole 3-days-a-week, and
      70% for omeprazole daily. Both omeprazole regimens were superior to placebo in
      preventing recurrence of symptoms (P < 0.001); however, omeprazole 20 mg daily
      was superior to omeprazole 20 mg 3-days-a-week (P < 0.001). Compared to baseline,
      omeprazole therapy resulted in no significant differences among treatment groups 
      in the distribution of gastric endocrine cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results show
      that after healing of erosive oesophagitis with 4-8 weeks of omeprazole, relapse 
      of oesophagitis and recurrence of reflux symptoms can be prevented in 70% of
      patients with a maintenance regimen of 20 mg daily, but that intermittent dosing 
      comprising 3 consecutive days each week significantly compromises efficacy.

TI  - Lansoprazole 15 and 30 mg daily in maintaining healing and symptom relief in
      patients with reflux oesophagitis.
PG  - 365-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: In patients with reflux oesophagitis, endoscopic healing and symptom 
      relief are considered important treatment goals in long-term care. AIM: To
      compare the effect of lansoprazole 15 and 30 mg daily on maintaining endoscopic
      healing and symptom relief in patients with moderate reflux oesophagitis.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a single-centre, double-blind randomized clinical trial,
      103 patients with grade 1 or 2 reflux oesophagitis who were endoscopically healed
      and asymptomatic after lansoprazole 30 mg daily for 12 weeks, were randomized to 
      maintenance therapy with either lansoprazole 15 mg or 30 mg o.m. Endoscopy was
      repeated after 3, 6 and 12 months, and symptom relief assessed after 3, 6, 9 and 
      12 months. Relapse of oesophagitis or symptoms were considered end-points.
      RESULTS: After 12 months, 14/50 patients (28%) receiving lansoprazole 15 mg daily
      had suffered an endoscopic relapse compared to 8/53 patients (15%) treated with
      lansoprazole 30 mg daily. A life table analysis showed no statistically
      significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.086). Significantly more
      patients were kept in complete symptomatic remission in the 30 mg group (P <
      0.01). In the 15 mg group, 23/50 (46%) had suffered either an endoscopic or
      symptomatic relapse on completion of the study, compared to 12/53 (23%) in the 30
      mg group. A life table analysis showed this difference to be statistically
      significant (P = 0.010). Lansoprazole 15 and 30 mg daily were equally well
      tolerated. CONCLUSION: No statistically significant differences were found in
      endoscopic relapse rate or occurrence of adverse events, while lansoprazole 30 mg
      proved superior to 15 mg in maintaining patients in symptomatic relief and
      combined endoscopic and symptomatic remission.

TI  - Lansoprazole versus omeprazole: influence on meal-stimulated gastric acid
      secretion.
PG  - 359-64
AB  - AIMS: To investigate, by means of meal-stimulated acid secretion, the extent to
      which differences in plasma half-life, bioavailability and the recommended
      therapeutic dose can influence the antisecretory potency of lansoprazole and
      omeprazole. METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study,
      10 healthy male volunteers received 15 mg or 30 mg lansoprazole, 20 mg or 40 mg
      omeprazole or placebo for 5 days, in a randomized order. Meal-stimulated acid
      secretion was determined by means of a homogenized test meal and intragastric
      titration. RESULTS: On day 1, meal-stimulated acid secretion was decreased by 35%
      and 45% after administration of 15 mg or 30 mg lansoprazole, and by 16% and 42%
      after 20 mg or 40 mg omeprazole. After 3 and 5 days of dosing the decreases were 
      53% and 48% with 15 mg lansoprazole, 82% and 82% with 30 mg lansoprazole, 43% and
      39% with 20 mg omeprazole, and 76% and 83% with 40 mg omeprazole. At all
      measuring points during the 5-day dosing periods, lansoprazole 15 mg and 30 mg
      proved superior to 20 mg omeprazole in inhibiting meal-stimulated gastric acid
      secretion, but the differences were only statistically significant for the
      lansoprazole 30 mg dose, 30 mg lansoprazole and 40 mg omeprazole proved
      equipotent. On day 1 only 30 mg lansoprazole was significantly better than
      placebo. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the following order of antisecretory
      potency: 30 mg lansoprazole = 40 mg omeprazole > 15 mg lansoprazole approximately
      20 mg omeprazole.

TI  - In single doses ranitidine effervescent is more effective than lansoprazole in
      decreasing gastric acidity.
PG  - 355-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: A rapid and reproducible decrease of gastric acidity is preferable in
      patients with penetrating/perforating peptic ulcers and in on-demand treatment of
      some patients with dyspepsia. The present study was done to compare the effect of
      single doses of ranitidine effervescent with that of the proton pump inhibitor
      lansoprazole. METHOD: Twelve healthy young volunteers were studied by 11-h
      intragastric continuous pH recording after the intake of ranitidine 150 or 300 mg
      effervescent tablets or lansoprazole 30 mg capsules. Trial medications were taken
      with 200 mL water, and the subjects remained fasting apart from 250 mL fluid at 4
      h. RESULTS: Ranitidine effervescent, both 150 and 300 mg, induced a rapid and
      persisting increase in gastric pH in most of the subjects, whereas a single dose 
      of lansoprazole 30 mg did not affect intragastric pH in five of the twelve
      subjects. CONCLUSION: The histamine H2-blocker ranitidine given as an
      effervescent formulation is superior to the proton pump inhibitor lansoprazole in
      inducing a rapid decrease of gastric acidity.

TI  - An increasing dose of omeprazole combined with amoxycillin cures Helicobacter
      pylori infection more effectively.
PG  - 323-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The combination of omeprazole and amoxycillin has demonstrated
      effectiveness with very few side-effects in the treatment of H. pylori infection,
      however cure rates have varied widely. The present study addresses the question
      as to the extent to which the cure rate of H. pylori infection depends on the
      size of the daily omeprazole dose, and investigates other patient-related factors
      that influence treatment success. METHODS: In a randomized, controlled and
      investigator-blinded trial, 163 hospitalized patients with H. pylori-associated
      gastritis were treated with 20 mg omeprazole once daily in the morning, 20 mg
      omeprazole b.d., 40 mg omeprazole b.d. or 60 mg omeprazole b.d. for 14 days. In
      addition, all patients received 1000 mg amoxycillin b.d. on days 5-14. Endoscopic
      and histological examinations were performed prior to treatment, at the end of
      treatment and 4 weeks after completion of treatment. RESULTS: H. pylori infection
      was cured in 18 of 40 (45%, 95% CI: 29-62%), in 22 of 39 (56.4%, 95% CI: 40-72%),
      in 25 of 38 (65.8%, 95% CI: 49-80%), and in 33 of 40 (82.5%, 95% CI: 67-93%)
      patients, respectively, (P < 0.001). Side-effects leading to discontinuation of
      treatment occurred in only 1.2%. CONCLUSION: The daily dose of omeprazole is an
      important factor for the success of dual therapy comprising omeprazole and
      amoxycillin in curing H. pylori infection. Cure of H. pylori infection correlates
      positively and significantly with the size of the daily omeprazole dose. The
      combination of high-dose omeprazole and amoxycillin is an effective and
      well-tolerated regimen for the treatment of H. pylori-associated diseases.

TI  - Randomized study comparing omeprazole plus amoxycillin versus omeprazole plus
      clarithromycin for eradication of Helicobacter pylori.
PG  - 317-22
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dual therapy with omeprazole plus amoxycillin or with omeprazole plus
      clarithromycin has been proposed for eradication of Helicobacter pylori. The main
      problem is the great variability in the rate of eradication. METHODS: A group of 
      287 consecutive patients with active peptic ulcers and H. pylori infections were 
      admitted to a prospective, randomized, multicentre study, to be given omeprazole 
      20 mg b.d. plus either amoxycillin 1 g b.d. or clarithromycin 500 mg t.d.s. for 2
      weeks. Cure was defined as the absence of H. pylori infection, 4-6 weeks after
      completing anti-microbial therapy, assessed by urease activity and histology of
      antral and body gastric biopsies. RESULTS: The bacteria were eradicated in 68/143
      patients (48%) treated with amoxycillin and omeprazole and 70/144 patients (49%) 
      treated with clarithromycin and omeprazole (intention-to-treat analysis). The
      ulcers were healed in 118/127 patients (93%) treated with amoxycillin and in
      115/123 (94%) of those treated with clarithromycin. Undesirable effects were rare
      with both treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Combined treatment with omeprazole plus either
      amoxycillin or clarithromycin produced a high percentage of short-term healing of
      ulcers and was well tolerated, but is not useful as first-line anti-Helicobacter 
      pylori treatment.

      Helicobacter pylori.
PG  - 311-6
AB  - AIM: To investigate a repeat treatment regimen with the same antibiotic
      combination of amoxycillin and metronidazole in patients with continuing
      Helicobacter pylori infection. METHODS: Eighty-two patients with severe peptic
      ulcer disease and concurrent Helicobacter pylori infection were treated with a
      two week regimen of omeprazole (40 mg once daily), amoxycillin (750 mg t.d.s.)
      and metronidazole (400 mg t.d.s.). Upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy was
      performed before, and approximately 2 months after, completion of antibiotic
      therapy. Biopsies were taken for rapid urease testing and the histological
      demonstration of H. pylori infection. Patients with persistent H. pylori
      infection at follow-up endoscopy were re-treated with a second and identical
      antibiotic treatment course. A subsequent endoscopic examination with
      accompanying biopsies was performed at least 6 weeks after the second treatment
      course and after a further 6, 18 and 30 months. RESULTS: Eradication of H. pylori
      was achieved in 69 patients (84%, 95% CI: 75-90%) after the first treatment. Four
      patients (4/82 = 5%) were withdrawn from the study because of side-effects. All
      of the remaining nine patients had their H. pylori infection eradicated after the
      second treatment course (95% CI: 70-100%). Seventy-eight patients had a follow-up
      examination after a median 30 months of the initial eradication of H. pylori, and
      all but one remained free of infection and none had an ulcer relapse.
      CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that patients with persistent H. pylori
      infection after completing a primary course of omeprazole (40 mg once daily),
      amoxycillin (750 mg t.d.s.) and metronidazole (400 mg t.d.s.) will probably
      respond to a repeat course of treatment with the same antibiotic combination.

PG  - 328-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: Does profound acid inhibition by continuous infusion of omeprazole
      for 72 h reduce further bleeding in elderly patients with peptic ulcer bleeding
      (PUB)? METHODS: Three hundred and thirty-three patients > or = 60 years old with 
      PUB were randomized to omeprazole (80 mg + mg/h) or placebo as continuous
      infusion for 72 h. From day 4 to 21 all patients received 20 mg omeprazole orally
      once daily. RESULTS: When evaluated on day 3, the primary variable 'overall
      outcome' (based on an ordinal ranking scale; see Study variables) (P = 0.017) and
      the secondary variables, surgery (P = 0.003), degree (P = 0.004) and duration of 
      bleeding (P = 0.003) all favored the omeprazole group. Blood transfusions, need
      for endoscopic treatment, and mortality were not statistically different. On
      follow-up, by day 21, the mortality in the group initially receiving intravenous 
      omeprazole was 6.9%, while the intravenous placebo group showed an extremely low 
      mortality, 0.6%. CONCLUSION: Three days' infusion of omeprazole improved overall 
      outcome and reduced need for intervention in PUB patients.

TI  - Effect of omeprazole on the outcome of endoscopically treated bleeding peptic
      ulcers. Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled multicentre study.
PG  - 320-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Haemostasis is highly pH-dependent and severely impaired at low pH.
      However, there is no clear evidence that acid-suppressing drugs have beneficial
      effects in peptic ulcer haemorrhage. Endoscopic haemostatic treatment provides
      important reduction in morbidity and may be more efficient when a neutral
      intragastric pH is maintained. METHODS: We conducted a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled multicentre study of intravenous infusion of omeprazole (80 mg
      as bolus, followed by 8 mg/h) or placebo for 72 h. All patients received 20 mg
      omeprazole orally from day 3 until follow-up on day 21. Only patients with ulcer 
      haemorrhage, endoscoped within 12 h after admission, and with a history or signs 
      of circulatory failure and spurting bleeding, oozing bleeding, visible vessel, or
      clot, were included. Endoscopic intervention was aimed at when spurting bleeding,
      oozing bleeding, or a visible vessel was observed. The primary efficacy measure
      was the worst ranking on an overall outcome scale (5 = death, 4 = surgery, 3 =
      additional endoscopic treatment, 2 = more than 3 units of blood, and 1 = no more 
      than 3 units of blood transfused). Base-line prognostic factors of treatment
      success by day 3 and of other binary outcomes were considered in a logistic
      regression model. RESULTS: Two hundred and seventy-four patients were randomly
      assigned to omeprazole (134 patients) or placebo (140 patients). The number of
      patients included in the 'intention-to-treat' analysis was 130 in the omeprazole 
      group and 135 in the placebo group. The primary variable, the overall outcome at 
      72 h, showed a difference (P = 0.004) between the two treatments in favour of
      omeprazole. Treatment success by 72 h defined as no death, no operation, or no
      additional endoscopic treatment was 91.0% in the omeprazole group and 79.7% in
      the placebo group (therapeutic gain, 11.3 percentage units; 95% confidence
      interval, 2.3 to 20.4 percentage units). Significant differences in favour of
      omeprazole were also found for secondary variables such as number of blood
      transfusions, duration and degree of bleeding, and the need for surgery and
      additional endoscopic treatments on day 3 and day 21. However, the numbers of
      deaths by day 3, 21, or 35 were very similar. CONCLUSIONS: We found a beneficial 
      effect of intravenous omeprazole in severe ulcer haemorrhage, with a reduction in
      the number of operations, in endoscopic treatments, and in the duration and
      severity of bleeding.

TI  - Triple therapy with ranitidine or lansoprazole in the treatment of Helicobacter
      pylori-associated duodenal ulcer.
PG  - 649-52
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to verify the efficacy--in the cure of
      duodenal ulcer associated H. pylori infection--of ranitidine 300 mg taken late in
      the evening or lansoprazole 30 mg taken before breakfast, coupled with
      clarithromycin and metronidazole. METHODS: Eighty patients with endoscopically
      proven active duodenal ulcer were randomized to take ranitidine or lansoprazole
      for 4-8 wk, together with clarithromycin 250 mg b.i.d. and metronidazole 500 mg
      b.id. for the first 2 wk. Endoscopic controls, as well as histological and urease
      tests for H. pylori, were performed at entry and after 4 and 8 wk. RESULTS:
      According to intent-to-treat analysis, ulcers were healed after 4 wk in 36/40
      patients (90%) with ranitidine and in 38/40 (95%) with lansoprazole. After 8 wk, 
      the healing percentage with ranitidine and lansoprazole was 97% (39/40) and 95%
      (38/40), respectively. H. pylori was eradicated in 85% of the patients taking
      ranitidine and in 90% of those taking lanzoprazole. Side effects were reported in
      25% of the patients in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that the
      combination of ranitidine, clarithromycin, and metronidazole can be considered an
      alternative to proton pump inhibitors in terms of clinical efficacy and economy.

TI  - Normalization of esophageal pH with high-dose proton pump inhibitor therapy does 
      not result in regression of Barrett's esophagus.
PG  - 582-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The importance of esophageal acid control in the management of
      Barrett's esophagus is controversial. The objective of this study was to assess
      the impact of esophageal acid control on the symptoms of reflux disease, healing 
      of erosive esophagitis, change in length of Barrett's epithelium, and the
      appearance of squamous islands. METHODS: Thirteen of 27 patients on 60 mg
      lansoprazole underwent ambulatory 24 h esophageal pH monitoring while on therapy.
      Symptoms were recorded, and the length of Barrett's epithelium was measured,
      photographed, and biopsied every 6 months over an average of 5.7 yr. RESULTS:
      Eight of 13 patients had a normal 24 h pH (group I, mean pH < 4, 0.8%), five
      patients had abnormal results (group II, mean pH < 4, 10.6%). Symptoms improved
      in all patients, and there was complete healing of erosive esophagitis in all
      patients. An increase in the number of squamous islands was noted in 62.5% of
      patients in group I and in 80% of patients in group II. The mean length of
      Barrett's epithelium at baseline and study completion in group I was 5.6 and 5.0 
      cm, respectively (mean decrease, 0.6 cm), and for group II was 4.2 and 4.2 cm,
      respectively (mean decrease, 0 cm). There was no significant difference in the
      change in length between the two groups (p = 0.494). CONCLUSIONS: Although
      symptoms improved, erosive esophagitis healed, and squamous islands increased,
      there was no significant decrease in the length of Barrett's esophagus. Control
      of esophageal pH alone is not sufficient for the reversal of Barrett's esophagus.

TI  - Efficacy of omeprazole one year after cure of Helicobacter pylori infection in
      duodenal ulcer patients.
PG  - 576-81
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We have previously shown that, in duodenal ulcer patients, pH control 
      by omeprazole is less pronounced after cure of Helicobacter pylori infection. The
      present study was designed to test the hypothesis that this response to
      omeprazole persists 1 yr after cure of H. pylori infection. METHODS: In 12
      duodenal ulcer patients, intragastric acidity was measured with a glass electrode
      during treatment with omeprazole (20 mg) once daily before, and 4-6 wk and 1 yr
      after, cure of H. pylori infection. H. pylori infection was assessed by [13C]urea
      breath test, culture, histology (Warthin Starry stain), and rapid urease test.
      RESULTS: Cure of H. pylori infection resulted in a lowered pH during omeprazole
      treatment. This effect persisted after 1 yr. Median 24-h gastric pH before H.
      pylori treatment was 5.6; 4-6 wk after cure of the infection it was 2.9 (p =
      0.003), and 1 yr after cure of the infection it remained unchanged (pH = 2.5; p =
      0.5). Accordingly, twice as much time was spent above pH 3 and pH 4 before H.
      pylori treatment than 1 or 12 months after cure (percent of time > or = pH 3:
      82.7 vs. 49.7 vs. 43.1; percent of time > or = pH 4: 72.7 vs. 38.3 vs. 26.4).
      CONCLUSION: In duodenal ulcer patients, cure of H. pylori infection resulted in a
      marked rapid and persistent decrease of the pH increasing effect of omeprazole.
      Therefore, H. pylori is a determinant of the pH achieved in response to
      omeprazole treatment in duodenal ulcer patients.

TI  - Extent and variation of omeprazole prescribing in an elderly population of
      Ontario.
PG  - 411-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the extent of omeprazole prescribing in the senior
      population of Ontario over a 1-year period; the variation in omeprazole
      prescribing for this population according to age group, gender, and geographic
      region: and the extent of inappropriate prescribing of omeprazole for this
      population. DESIGN: Retrospective drug utilization review of prescription drug
      insurance claims. DATA SOURCE: The Ontario Drug Benefit (ODB) program claims
      database. OUTCOME MEASURES: The following outcomes were measured: the proportion 
      of seniors in Ontario who received a prescription for omeprazole from April 1,
      1992 to March 31, 1993: effects of age group, gender, and geographic region of
      residence on omeprazole prescribing; and the extent of inappropriate omeprazole
      prescribing according to the ODB criteria for use. Prescribing of omeprazole was 
      defined as inappropriate if a first-line antiulcer drug (i.e.,
      histamine2-receptor antagonist) was not prescribed within 1-6 months of the first
      prescription claim for omeprazole. RESULTS: A total of 29,936 seniors in Ontario 
      received omeprazole from April 1, 1992 to March 31, 1993 (2.53 recipients per 100
      eligible population). The age-gender group most frequently prescribed omeprazole 
      was women 65-74 years, followed by women and men 75 years or older, and then men 
      65-74 years. Omeprazole prescribing varied widely among the 48 provincial
      counties (range of 1.66 recipients per 100 eligible population to 4.52 recipients
      per 100 population, p < 0.001). There was no evidence of a clustering effect in
      omeprazole prescribing at the county level. Prescribing of omeprazole was
      considered to be inappropriate for 80.5% of recipients. CONCLUSIONS: This study
      demonstrated the ineffectiveness of the ODB limited-use program in controlling
      omeprazole prescribing. Further study should be done to examine determinants of
      variation in prescribing by geographic region.

TI  - Choice of long-term strategy for the management of patients with severe
      esophagitis: a cost-utility analysis.
PG  - 1078-86
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Omeprazole has shown remarkable efficacy and safety in the
      treatment of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD); similarly,
      laparoscopic techniques have allowed less morbidity in patients undergoing
      fundoplication procedures. Concerns about the long-term cost and safety of both
      strategies have prompted a debate of their role in long-term management of
      patients with severe erosive esophagitis. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was
      performed to compare two strategies: laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF) vs.
      omeprazole. A two-stage Markov model was used to obtain cost and efficacy
      estimates; all estimates were discounted at 3% per year. The time horizon was 5
      years. Sensitivity analyses were performed on all relevant variables. RESULTS:
      Both strategies were similarly effective (4.33 quality-adjusted life years per
      patient), with omeprazole less expensive than LNF ($6053 vs. $9482 per patient). 
      At 10 years, LNF and omeprazole costs were similar. Efficacy estimates were
      extremely sensitive to changes in quality of life associated with postoperative
      symptoms and long-term use of medication. CONCLUSIONS: Medical therapy is the
      preferred treatment strategy for most patients with severe erosive esophagitis.
      Individuals with a long life expectancy are good candidates for LNF if
      postoperative morbidity is low and GERD symptoms remain abated for many years.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness analysis of different strategies for treating duodenal ulcer. 
      Helicobacter pylori eradication versus antisecretory treatment.
PG  - 367-76
AB  - Helicobacter pylori has recently been recognised as a causative agent for
      duodenal ulcer, and the efficacy of various combinations of antibacterials and
      antisecretory agents in eradicating this pathogen has been assessed. The
      objective of this study was to determine the efficiency of 2 treatment strategies
      for patients with H. pylori-positive duodenal ulcer. Cost effectiveness was
      analysed for antisecretory therapy (omeprazole 20 mg/day for 4 weeks), and
      eradication therapy (triple therapy: omeprazole 40 mg/day plus clarithromycin 1
      g/day plus amoxicillin 2 g/day for 1 week). In a Markov model, a hypothetical
      cohort of 5000 patients was followed for 10 years through 6 disease states.
      Cyclic eradication therapy (i.e. in the first duodenal ulcer episode and in
      relapses) was the most cost effective [21 Spanish pesetas (Pta) per day free of
      symptoms (DFS); Pta128 = $US1 (October 1995)] of the eradication options
      evaluated [antisecretory in the first episode, then eradication for relapses
      (Pta22.3/DFS), and eradication therapy first, then antisecretory therapy
      (Pta27.3/DFS)]. Antisecretory therapy alone was less cost-effective (Pta39/DFS)
      than each of the 3 eradication options. Eradication treatment in the first
      episode of duodenal ulcer and relapses has savings in direct costs per patient of
      up to 56% compared with antisecretory therapy alone. Sensitivity analyses showed 
      the model to be very robust. It is, therefore, advisable to treat initial
      episodes of H. pylori-positive duodenal ulcer and relapses with triple therapy.
      The improved cost-effectiveness ratio was largely explained by the long term
      reduction in relapses obtained with the eradication strategies.

TI  - Effects of smoking on cure of Helicobacter pylori infection and duodenal ulcer
      recurrence in patients treated with clarithromycin and omeprazole.
PG  - 27-31
AB  - BACKGROUND: Smoking may affect adversely the cure rate for Helicobacter pylori
      infection in patients treated with amoxicillin and omeprazole. Therapy with
      clarithromycin and omeprazole was tested for its effectiveness in the treatment
      of H. pylori infection in smokers and nonsmokers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients
      with verified duodenal ulcer and H. pylori infection received clarithromycin 500 
      mg tid, in combination with omeprazole 40 mg/ day, for 2 weeks, followed by
      omeprazole (20 or 40 mg daily) for 2 additional weeks according to a randomized, 
      double-blind, multicenter design. Patients were analyzed by their smoking status 
      for the cure of H. pylori infection, ulcer healing, and prevention of duodenal
      ulcer recurrence. RESULTS: After treatment with clarithromycin and omeprazole, H.
      pylori infection was cured in 71% of the smokers and in 77% of the nonsmokers
      (evaluated 4-6 weeks after treatment). Overall ulcer healing was 95%, and overall
      ulcer recurrence was 19%. For H. pylori-negative patients, ulcer recurrence was
      12% in both smokers and nonsmokers. None of these values was significantly
      different when smokers were compared to nonsmokers. CONCLUSIONS: Therapy with
      clarithromycin and omeprazole is effective for cure of H. pylori infection in
      smokers and nonsmokers. Smoking has no effect on duodenal ulcer healing or
      duodenal ulcer recurrence for patients treated with this regimen.

TI  - Time of Helicobacter pylori eradication assessment following treatment.
PG  - 13-20
AB  - BACKGROUND: The most appropriate time to assess accurately Helicobacter pylori
      eradication following treatment has been debated, with recommendations ranging
      from 1 to 3 months. The purpose of this study was to validate the assessment of
      H. pylori eradication 1 month following treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three
      randomized, double-blind, active-controlled clinical trials were conducted in
      patients with endoscopically verified, active duodenal ulcers and H. pylori
      infection. Patients were treated with various treatment regimens of omeprazole
      plus amoxicillin. Ulcer healing, H. pylori eradication, and ulcer relapse were
      examined. Patients underwent repeat endoscopy and biopsy at 1 and 6 months
      following treatment (or sooner if symptoms returned) to determine the recurrence 
      of ulcers and H. pylori status. To determine the accuracy of measuring H. pylori 
      eradication at 1 month posttreatment, we compared the H. pylori status at 1 month
      and 6 months following treatment. RESULTS: In a combination of treatment groups
      and studies, a total of 384 evaluable patients represented data at both time
      points and were included in the analysis. Of those eradicated at 1 month
      posttreatment, 94% (141 of 150) remained eradicated at 6 months posttreatment.
      The proportion of patients with H. pylori eradicated at 1 month posttreatment did
      not differ significantly from that at 6 months posttreatment for each study. The 
      overall efficiency of the two tests (agreement between tests) was 93% (359 of
      384). Agreement between the 1-month and 6-month posttreatment H. pylori
      assessment was apparent, regardless of the treatment used. CONCLUSION: H. pylori 
      eradication measured 1 month following cessation of treatment accurately reflects
      successful treatment of the infection.

TI  - Eradication of Helicobacter pylori: an objective assessment of current therapies.
PG  - 223-43
AB  - The purpose of the present review was to determine objectively the optimal
      treatment for the eradication of H. pylori amongst the currently used regimens. A
      comprehensive literature search provided a data-base relating to the following
      treatments: dual therapy with an anti-secretory drug plus either amoxycillin or
      clarithromycin; standard triple therapy, with or without additional
      anti-secretory drugs; proton pump inhibitor triple therapy; and H2-receptor
      antagonist triple therapy. Emphasis was placed on intention-to-treat analyses of 
      eradication rates using all of the available evidence. The criteria used to
      select the optimal treatment were efficacy (eradication rates), frequency of
      side-effects, simplicity of the regimen (number of tablets per day and duration
      of treatment) and cost. The analysis showed that proton pump inhibitor triple
      therapy (that is, a proton pump inhibitor plus any two of amoxycillin,
      clarithromycin or a nitroimidazole) was the preferred treatment for the
      eradication of H. pylori. In particular, the 1-week, low-dose regimen with
      omeprazole plus clarithromycin plus tinidazole produced the highest eradication
      rates (> 90%) with the lowest frequency of side-effects and at only modest cost.

TI  - Lansoprazole: a comprehensive review.
PG  - 308-26
AB  - Lansoprazole is the second member of the substituted benzimidazole class of
      antisecretory agents approved for use in the United States. These drugs decrease 
      parietal cell acid secretion by inhibiting H+, K(+)-adenosine triphosphatase, the
      final step in the secretion of acid. Lansoprazole has been studied extensively
      for the short-term treatment of duodenal and gastric ulcers, reflux esophagitis, 
      and Helicobacter pylori-positive peptic ulcer disease; long-term treatment of
      Zollinger-Ellison syndrome; and maintenance treatment of erosive esophagitis. A
      dosage of 30 mg/day produced higher healing rates and equivalent or faster relief
      of ulcer symptoms than ranitidine or famotidine in patients with duodenal or
      gastric ulcers and reflux esophagitis. Compared with omeprazole 20 mg/day, that
      dosage provided faster epigastric pain relief in these patients after 1 week,
      although healing rates for the two agents were equivalent at 4 and 8 weeks. In
      patients with peptic ulcer refractory to 8-week therapy with histamine2-receptor 
      antagonists, healing rates were not significantly different between lansoprazole 
      and omeprazole. In patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, lansoprazole was
      superior to histamine2-receptor antagonists and was similar in efficacy, safety, 
      and duration of action to omeprazole. Combinations of lansoprazole or omeprazole 
      with one or two antibiotics produced equivalent eradication of H. pylori. In
      clinical trials, lansoprazole was well tolerated, with frequency of adverse
      effects similar to that reported with ranitidine, famotidine, and omeprazole.

TI  - Antimicrobial management of Helicobacter pylori-associated gastrointestinal tract
      disease.
PG  - 173-80
AB  - Since the identification of Helicobacter pylori in 1983, this pathogen has become
      the dominant focus of investigation in a variety of gastrointestinal tract
      disorders, including peptic ulcer disease, nonulcer dyspepsia, and gastric
      carcinoma. During the past 7 years, the efficacy of a variety of antimicrobial
      single, dual, and triple therapy regimens--including the use of acid-suppressive 
      agents, such as proton pump inhibitors, and histamine2-receptor antagonists--in
      the eradication of H pylori have been investigated. Newer treatment approaches,
      such as dual therapy (proton pump inhibitor + 1 antimicrobial agent) and 7-day
      regimens have shown a high degree of success and have the potential to improve
      compliance. However, the optimal regimen, in terms of cost, efficacy, and
      tolerability, and optimal length of treatment still remains to be determined.

TI  - Anti-Helicobacter pylori treatment in bleeding ulcers: randomized controlled
      trial comparing 2-day versus 7-day bismuth quadruple therapy.
PG  - 438-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: One-week bismuth triple therapy has been established to be highly
      effective in curing H. pylori infection, but patient compliance has been the
      major factor of success in therapy. For patients hospitalized for ulcer bleeding,
      an effective regimen that can completed before discharge will ensure full
      compliance. AIM: To compare 2-day versus 1-wk bismuth triple therapy plus
      omeprazole in curing H. pylori infection and bleeding peptic ulcers. METHODS: 100
      patients with non-actively bleeding duodenal (DU) or gastric ulcers (GU) and
      confirmed H. pylori infection were randomized to receive either bismuth
      subcitrate 120 mg, tetracycline 500 mg, and metronidazole 400 mg four times daily
      for 1 wk (OBTM-7) or bismuth subcitrate 240 mg, tetracycline 500 mg, and
      metronidazole 400 mg four times daily for 2 days (OBTM-2). Both groups of
      patients also received omeprazole 20 mg twice daily for the first week. In the
      OBTM-2 group, the anti-Helicobacter therapy was finished during hospitalization. 
      Endoscopy was repeated 5 wk after randomization to monitor ulcer healing and
      determine H. pylori status. Side effects related to the anti-Helicobacter therapy
      was graded as follows: A, mild discomfort, which did not affect daily activity;
      B, moderate discomfort affecting daily activity; and C, severe discomfort and
      patients discontinued therapy. RESULTS: Forty-six patients in the OBTM-2 group
      and 50 in the OBTM-7 group returned for follow-up endoscopy. With an
      intention-to-treat analysis, ulcer healing was achieved in 44 of 46 patients
      (95.7%) in the OBTM-2 group versus 49 of 50 (98%) in the OBTM-7 group, p = 0.61. 
      H. pylori eradication was successful in 35 of 46 patients (76.1%) in the OBTM-2
      and in all 50 patients (100%) in the OBTM-7 group, p = 0.00024. There was no
      difference in the severity of side effects experienced by the patients in the
      OBTM-2 group than in the OBTM-7 group (19 vs 32%, p = 0.16). None of the patients
      had rebled during the period of follow-up. CONCLUSION: Despite similar efficacy
      in ulcer healing, the 2-day quadruple therapy is less effective than the 1-wk
      regimen in curing H. pylori infection.

TI  - Long-term comparison of antireflux surgery versus conservative therapy for reflux
      esophagitis.
PG  - 295-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the long-term symptomatic and
      endoscopic outcome in gastroesophageal reflux disease with erosive esophagitis,
      comparing conservative with operative management. METHODS: The study comprised
      105 of 120 patients consecutively referred for severe reflux symptoms to the
      gastroenterologic outpatient department of a teaching hospital, where erosive
      esophagitis was confirmed endoscopically. If conservative management (modified
      lifestyle and medication) failed to relieve symptoms and heal the esophagitis,
      antireflux surgery (Nissen fundoplication) was undertaken. Follow-up (median,
      10.9 years) evaluation of all patients included comprehensive, standardized
      interviews; self-scoring of symptoms at the time of referral and currently; and
      observations at endoscopy. RESULTS: Nissen fundoplication was performed on 37 of 
      the 105 patients. At follow-up of these 37 patients, (31) 84% had no or only
      occasional mild heartburn, (33) 89% were free from erosive esophagitis, and (2)
      5% were taking H2 antagonists or omeprazole. The corresponding figures in the 68 
      patients with only conservative treatment were (36) 53%, (31) 45%, and (14) 21%. 
      The mean change in symptom score between referral time and follow-up was 5.7 in
      the surgically treated group and 1.7 in the nonsurgically treated group. Fifteen 
      new cases of Barrett's metaplasia were found at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In
      gastroesophageal reflux disease with erosive esophagitis, surgical treatment gave
      results subjectively and objectively superior to those from conservative
      management.

TI  - Complement activation after ischemia-reperfusion in human liver allografts:
      incidence and pathophysiological relevance.
PG  - 908-18
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Little is known about the occurrence and possible consequences
      of local complement activation in human liver transplantation. The aim of this
      study was to search for signs of complement activation in human liver allografts 
      and evaluate their relationship to cell injury and leukocyte sequestration.
      METHODS: In 33 postreperfusion biopsy specimens, 9 preoperative specimens, and 10
      intraoperative specimens, the cytolytic membrane attack complex of complement was
      localized, expression of complement inhibitors was evaluated, and intragraft
      accumulation of leukocytes and platelets was quantitated. RESULTS: In control
      samples and preoperative biopsy specimens, the membrane attack complex was
      detected only in extracellular deposits, associated with its soluble inhibitors
      clusterin and vitronectin. Comparable observations were performed in 14
      postoperative specimens. In the remaining 19 postoperative specimens, membrane
      attack complex decorated a variable proportion of hepatocytes. The extent of
      membrane attack complex deposition correlated with the increase in postoperative 
      aspartate aminotransferase levels in serum (P = 0.002) and the decrease in
      postoperative factor V levels in serum (P = 0.002). It also correlated with the
      number of leukocytes and platelets accumulating within the graft (P < or =
      0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Local complement activation is frequent during human liver
      transplantation and probably contributes to cell injury and leukocyte
      sequestration in the allograft.

TI  - Gastric mucosa during treatment with lansoprazole: Helicobacter pylori is a risk 
      factor for argyrophil cell hyperplasia.
PG  - 707-17
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The mechanisms causing progression of fundic gastritis and
      changes in argyrophil cell morphology in patients undergoing long-term treatment 
      with proton pump inhibitors are unknown. The hypothesis of this study was that
      Helicobacter pylori is a risk factor for both gastritis and argyrophil cell
      hyperplasia. METHODS: Forty-two patients with peptic disorders resistant to
      H2-blockers were treated with 30-90 mg lansoprazole daily for up to 5 years.
      Serum gastrin levels, antral gastrin cells, fundic argyrophil cells, parameters
      of gastritis, and H. pylori infection were evaluated regularly. RESULTS: In
      nonantrectomized patients, serum gastrin levels increased from a median of 76
      pg/mL to 163 pg/mL within 3 months. Antral gastrin cell density increased from
      175 to 267 cells/mm2 (P < 0.001), and fundic argyrophil cell density increased
      from 83 to 149 cells/mm2 (P < 0.001). Chronic inflammation, activity, and atrophy
      of the oxyntic mucosa worsened exclusively in patients with H. pylori infection. 
      Linear and/or micronodular argyrophil cell hyperplasia was diagnosed in 2.6% of
      patients before lansoprazole and in 29.2% after 5 years treatment. These changes 
      were significantly related to serum gastrin levels, H. pylori infection, chronic 
      inflammation, and atrophy of the oxyntic mucosa. CONCLUSIONS: H. pylori
      represents an important factor for the progression of fundic gastritis and the
      development of argyrophil cell hyperplasia during long-term treatment with
      lansoprazole.

TI  - Randomised double blind controlled study of recurrence of gastric ulcer after
      treatment for eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection.
PG  - 565-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection
      reduces recurrence of benign gastric ulceration. DESIGN: Randomised, double
      blind, controlled study. Patients were randomised in a 1:2 ratio to either
      omeprazole 40 mg once daily for eight weeks or the same treatment plus
      amoxycillin 750 mg twice daily for weeks 7 and 8. A 12 month untreated follow up 
      ensued. SETTING: Teaching and district general hospitals between 1991 and 1994.
      SUBJECTS: 107 patients with benign gastric ulcer associated with H pylori. MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Endoscopically confirmed relapse with gastric ulcer (analysed
      with life table methods), H pylori eradication, and healing of gastric ulcers
      (Mantel-Haenszel test). RESULTS: 172 patients were enrolled. Malignancy was
      diagnosed in 19; 24 were not infected with H pylori; four withdrew because of
      adverse events; and 18 failed to attend for start of treatment, leaving 107
      patients eligible for analysis (35 omeprazole alone; 72 omeprazole plus
      amoxycillin). In the omeprazole/amoxycillin group 93% (67/72; 95% confidence
      interval 84% to 98%) of gastric ulcers healed and 83% (29/35; 66% to 94%) in the 
      omeprazole group (P = 0.103). Eradication of H pylori was 58% (42/72; 46% to 70%)
      and 6% (2/35; 1% to 19%) (P < 0.001) and relapse after treatment was 22% (16/72) 
      and 49% (17/35) (life table analysis, P < 0.001), in the two groups,
      respectively. The recurrence rates were 7% (3/44) after successful H pylori
      eradication and 48% (30/63) in those who continued to be infected (P < 0.001).
      CONCLUSIONS: Eradication of H pylori reduces relapse with gastric ulcer over one 
      year. Eradication rates achieved with this regimen, however, are too low for it
      to be recommended for routine use.

TI  - Twenty-four-hour monitoring of intragastric acidity: comparison between
      lansoprazole 30mg and pantoprazole 40mg.
PG  - 195-200
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To date, there is no published study, comparing the effects of
      lansoprazole and pantoprazole on gastric acid secretion inhibition. The aim of
      this study, was to compare the effects of these two drugs on 24-h intragastric
      pH-metry. DESIGN: Twelve healthy volunteers were included in an open, randomized,
      crossover study. Each subject received lansoprazole 30mg during 7 days followed, 
      after a 14-day wash-out period, by pantoprazole 40 mg for 7 days or vice versa.
      Intragastric 24-h pH monitoring was performed before the treatment, and then
      after the first and seventh intake in each treatment period. RESULTS: The
      decrease in gastric acidity on daytime, night-time and total 24-h periods during 
      both treatments was significantly different from the base value. Significant
      differences in acid inhibition were found between lansoprazole 30mg and
      pantoprazole 40 mg during daytime and 24 h after the first intake. After repeated
      dose regimens, a significant difference was detected between treatment periods
      but only for pH above 4. After the first dose, the median pH value with
      lansoprazole was also significantly greater than for pantoprazole. Pantoprazole
      activity increased significantly from first to seventh intake, in contrast to
      lansoprazole. CONCLUSION: Lansoprazole 30 mg was significantly more potent than
      pantoprazole 40 mg on 24-h pH profiles on the first and seventh days. The
      antisecretory effect of lansoprazole was maximum after the first intake whereas
      pantoprazole activity increased significantly between the first and last intake.

TI  - Lansoprazole heals erosive reflux oesophagitis in patients with Barrett's
      oesophagus.
PG  - 147-56
AB  - BACKGROUND: Barrett's oesophagus is thought to be a complication of severe
      gastro-oesophageal reflux. AIM: To determine whether the proton pump inhibitor,
      lansoprazole, is effective in healing erosive reflux oesophagitis in patients
      with Barrett's oesophagus. METHODS: An 8-week, randomized, double-blind study was
      conducted using patients with both erosive reflux oesophagitis and Barrett's
      oesophagus. Erosive reflux oesophagitis was defined as grades 2-4 oesophagitis;
      Barrett's oesophagus, as specialized columnar epithelium obtained by biopsy from 
      the tubular oesophagus; and healing, as a return to grade 0 or 1 oesophageal
      mucosa (complete re-epithelialization). One-hundred and five (105) patients from 
      one centre were randomized to receive either lansoprazole 30 mg daily or
      ranitidine 150 mg twice daily. Unhealed or symptomatic lansoprazole patients at
      week 4 were randomized to receive the same 30 mg dose daily or an increased dose 
      of 60 mg daily. Endoscopy was performed at baseline and at weeks 2, 4, 6 and 8.
      RESULTS: The treatment groups were similar in regards to baseline
      characteristics, erosive reflux oesophagitis grades and length of Barrett's
      oesophagus. At each 2-week interval, lansoprazole patients had significantly
      greater healing rates and less day and night heartburn and regurgitation than
      ranitidine patients. There were no significant differences between treatment
      groups in antacid use, quality of life parameters, or rate of reported adverse
      events. Median values for fasting serum gastrin levels remained within the normal
      range for both groups. CONCLUSION: In patients with both Barrett's oesophagus and
      erosive reflux oesophagitis, lansoprazole is significantly more effective than
      ranitidine in relieving reflux symptoms and healing erosive reflux oesophagitis.

TI  - Highly effective twice-daily triple therapies for Helicobacter pylori infection
      and peptic ulcer disease: does in vitro metronidazole resistance have any
      clinical relevance?
PG  - 248-53
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare cure rates of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection,
      ulcer healing, and side effects of three simplified regimens of triple therapy in
      patients with peptic ulcer disease. METHODS: Two hundred thirty-one patients were
      prospectively randomized to receive either regimen OAM (omeprazole 20 mg b.i.d., 
      amoxicillin 750 mg b.i.d., and metronidazole 400 g b.i.d.), OCM (omeprazole 20 mg
      b.i.d., clarithromycin 250 mg b.i.d., and metronidazole 400 mg b.i.d.), or BCM
      (bismuth subcitrate 240 mg b.i.d., clarithromycin 250 mg b.i.d., and
      metronidazole 400 mg b.i.d.), all for 10 days. Side effects were reported
      immediately afterward in a self-administered questionnaire. Upper endoscopy was
      carried out before treatment and 2 months after treatment. Three antral and three
      corpus biopsy specimens were analyzed microbiologically and with rapid urease
      test to determine the presence of H. pylori. Altogether 143 patients (62%) had an
      active ulcer at start of treatment. Metronidazole resistant (M-R) H. pylori
      strains were found in 30% of patients, while none had clarithromycin resistant
      (C-R) strains. RESULTS: According to intention-to-treat analysis, H. pylori cure 
      rates were 91, 95, and 95% with OAM, OCM, and BCM, respectively (p = 0.63). In
      patients with metronidazole-sensitive (M-S) strains versus M-R strains, the cure 
      rates were 96 versus 77% with OAM (p = 0.025), 94 versus 94% with OCM, and 94
      versus 96% with BCM. Ulcer healing rates were 95, 94, and 92%, respectively (p = 
      0.91). There were no significant differences in side effects between the
      regimens, and only five patients (2%) had to stop the treatment prematurely.
      CONCLUSIONS: All treatment regimens were highly effective for cure of H. pylori
      infection and for ulcer healing. Metronidazole resistance reduced the efficacy of
      OAM, but was of no importance for the efficacy of OCM or BCM. Side effects were
      of minor importance.

TI  - Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding in the Amsterdam area: incidence,
      diagnosis, and clinical outcome.
PG  - 236-43
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In the United States of America and the United Kingdom several
      epidemiological upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) surveys have been done.
      However, information about the current epidemiology of acute UGIB in continental 
      Western Europe is sparse. METHODS: From July of 1993 to July of 1994, 951
      patients with acute UGIB were prospectively included in 12 hospitals in the
      Amsterdam area. Data were collected prospectively with a standard questionnaire
      and included demographic as well as specific data relating to UGIB. RESULTS: The 
      overall incidence was 45 per 100,000 persons/yr. Patients had an advanced age
      (median, 71 yr), and shock was found in 63%. Coexisting illnesses were present in
      85%. Twenty percent had a history of previous ulcer disease, of whom 33% used
      acid suppressive therapy. Endoscopy was performed within 24 h in 78%, and in 42% 
      a gastroduodenal ulcer was found. In 24%, no diagnosis could be made at the
      initial endoscopy, in these patients endoscopy was done significantly later than 
      in those in whom a diagnosis was readily made. Rebleeding occurred in 16.4%, and 
      7% had surgery. Mortality rate was 13.9%, which was considered in one-third to be
      directly related to the bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence and diagnostic
      profile of UGIB is similar to other large European studies, but different from
      those for the United States. Bleeding could perhaps have been prevented in the
      patients with a history of previous ulcer disease. The 24-h endoscopy service was
      not as fast, accurate, and widespread as we assumed. Mortality seems to be more
      related to advanced age, shock, and coexisting illnesses.

TI  - Scleroderma and pregnancy.
PG  - 133-47
AB  - Pregnancy in systemic sclerosis may be uneventful, with both good maternal and
      fetal outcomes. Because scleroderma is a multisystem disease and complications do
      occur, however, careful antenatal evaluations, discussion of potential problems, 
      and participation in a high-risk obstetric monitoring program is very important
      to optimize the best outcome. Because women with diffuse scleroderma are at
      greater risk for developing serious cardiopulmonary and renal problems early in
      the disease, they should be encouraged to delay pregnancy until the disease
      stabilizes. All patients who become pregnant during this high-risk time should be
      monitored extremely carefully. Although there are some suggestions that there are
      increases in infertility and miscarriages before disease onset, recent studies
      show that these issues probably do not have major impact for women with
      established scleroderma who plan to become pregnant. The high risk of premature
      and small infants may be minimized with specialized obstetric and neonatal care, 
      however. Renal crisis in scleroderma is the only truly unique aspect of these
      pregnant, which, unlike blood pressure elevation in nonscleroderma pregnancies,
      must be treated aggressively with ACE inhibitors. Other pregnancy problems may
      not be unique to scleroderma, but because it is a chronic illness, any
      complication carries higher risks for both mother and child. Careful planning,
      close monitoring, and aggressive management should allow women with scleroderma
      to have a high likelihood of a successful pregnancy.

TI  - Pharmacoeconomic comparison of treatments for the eradication of Helicobacter
      pylori.
PG  - 87-97
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with Helicobacter pylori-induced duodenal ulcer should have 
      their infection eradicated. The optimal choice of antibiotic therapy, however, is
      less clear. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate costs and outcomes of treatment with 8
      antibiotic regimens with documented activity against H pylori vs maintenance
      therapy with histamine2-receptor antagonists (H2RA). METHODS: A meta-analysis for
      119 studies enrolling 6416 patients to determine aggregate eradication rates. The
      complexity of each regimen was used to determine the anticipated compliance rate 
      and actual effectiveness. A decision analytic model with Monte Carlo simulation
      determined annual costs and health outcomes. RESULTS: Average annual total costs 
      of testing for H pylori infection and antibiotic treatment ranged from $223 to
      $410 and prevented ulcer recurrence in 70% to 86% of patients. The H2RA
      maintenance therapy cost $425 and prevented recurrence in 72% of patients. The
      lowest costs and recurrence rates were achieved by 3 regimens: standard triple
      therapy (a combination of bismuth subsalicylate, metronidazole, and tetracycline 
      hydrochloride) for 14 days ($223, with 18% recurrence); a combination of
      clarithromycin, metronidazole, and a proton pump inhibitor for 7 days ($235, with
      15% recurrence); and standard triple therapy with a proton pump inhibitor for 7
      days ($236, with 14% recurrence). CONCLUSION: Treatment with any regimen resulted
      in lower costs compared with H2RA maintenance therapy. Three antibiotic regimens 
      had consistently lower costs and better outcomes: standard triple therapy for 14 
      days, metronidazole, clarithromycin, and a proton pump inhibitor for 7 days, and 
      standard triple therapy plus a proton pump inhibitor for 7 days.

PG  - 127-32
AB  - In order to investigate the mechanism by which proton pump inhibitor increases
      serum pepsinogen levels, we evaluated the effects of ulcer location and IgG
      antibody against Helicobacter pylori on lansoprazole-induced elevations. Patients
      with endoscopically proven peptic ulcer received lansoprazole 30 mg/day for 6 or 
      8 weeks; pepsinogen I and II levels, along with antibody to H. pylori, were
      measured in fasting blood samples. We found that whether or not antibody to H.
      pylori was present, pepsinogen I and II levels and the I/II ratio rose
      significantly in lansoprazole-treated patients. Patients with stomach-body ulcers
      showed smaller increases in both pepsinogens than did those with ulcers in the
      gastric angle/antrum or in the duodenum. In conclusion, lansoprazole increases
      serum levels of both pepsinogens I and II, although a larger increase in
      pepsinogen I elevates the pepsinogen I/II ratio. The relatively small increases
      seen in patients with stomach-body ulcers suggest atrophic changes in the gastric
      mucosa in patients with stomach-body ulcer.

TI  - Prophylaxis of acute gastroduodenal bleeding after renal transplantation.
PG  - 375-8
AB  - Severe gastroduodenal bleeding after renal transplantation is effectively
      prevented by H2 receptor blockers. New drugs for prophylaxis include proton pump 
      inhibitors. The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of
      prophylaxis with the H2 blocker ranitidine and with the proton pump inhibitor
      omeprazole. One hundred seventy-seven consecutive patients were included in a
      controlled, prospective, randomized study after cadaveric renal transplantation. 
      In one case, ranitidine failed to prevent exsanguination due to duodenal peptic
      ulcer bleeding. No bleeding was noted in the omeprazole group. There were no
      significant differences between the groups in hospitalization time, development
      of renal function, amount of cyclosporin A, prednisone, azathioprine, or
      methylprednisoline ingested, or laboratory biochemical parameters. We conclude
      that prophylaxis of severe gastroduodenal bleeding after renal transplantation
      with omeprazole is effective. Omeprazole is certainly as good as ranitidine; its 
      advantages are a prolonged effect and a simple dosage, independent of graft
      function development.

TI  - Lansoprazole versus omeprazole in the treatment of reflux esophagitis.
PG  - 171-4
AB  - To evaluate the therapeutic potential of the newly developed proton pump
      inhibitor lansoprazole in patients with reflux esophagitis (grade I and II
      according to Savary Muller criteria), the authors performed a single blind,
      randomized clinical trial comparing 20 mg omeprazole and 30 mg lansoprazole,
      involving 60 patients at two clinical hospitals. The treatment period was or 8
      weeks, and main efficacy variables were healing of endoscopic changes and relief 
      of reflux symptoms. No significant difference in terms of healing and relief of
      reflux symptoms was found either after 4 or after 8 weeks of treatment. In
      conclusion, 30 mg lansoprazole daily was found to be safe and effective therapy
      comparable to omeprazole in the short-term treatment for reflux esophagitis
      (grade I and II).

TI  - Prevention of recurrences of erosive reflux esophagitis: a cost-effectiveness
      analysis of maintenance proton pump inhibition.
PG  - 78-88
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of three management strategies for
      healed erosive reflux esophagitis: maintenance therapy with a proton pump
      inhibitor (PPI) from the outset; no maintenance therapy unless a patient's
      symptoms recur once over a year; and no maintenance therapy unless a patient's
      symptoms recur twice over a year. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Decision analysis using 
      data from randomized trials of lansoprazole, case series, and expert opinion.
      RESULTS: For patients with grade 4 esophagitis, maintenance from the outset is
      the most efficient approach. For all other patients, providing maintenance PPI
      after a patient experiences two recurrences is the least costly but least
      effective approach. The other two approaches prevent more recurrences: waiting to
      initiate maintenance therapy until symptoms recur once requires an additional $73
      for each recurrence prevented whereas maintenance PPI from the outset requires an
      additional $819 for each recurrence prevented. Maintenance therapy from the
      outset is cost effective if symptoms of esophagitis cause a 22% or greater
      decrement in quality of life (using $50,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained
      as a cost-effectiveness definition). However, withholding maintenance until the
      time of a first recurrence is cost effective if symptoms cause a 2% or greater
      decrement in quality of life. CONCLUSION: For grades 2 and 3 esophagitis,
      providing maintenance therapy after a patient experiences a further recurrence is
      a preferred option that appears cost-effective across a wide array of
      assumptions. Maintenance therapy from the outset, however, appears cost-effective
      only for those patients who report a significant decline in quality of life
      associated with esophagitis or for those patients with baseline grade 4
      esophagitis.

PG  - 95-9
AB  - In this study, the efficacy and tolerability of two different therapeutic
      schedules in eradicating Helicobacter pylori and healing duodenal ulcer were
      evaluated. The study included 60 patients with duodenal ulcer and Helicobacter
      pylori infection. They were randomly allocated to either of two groups: group 1
      (N = 30) received omeprazole 20 mg for 28 days, amoxicillin 3 x 500 mg for 7 days
      and metronidazole 3 x 500 mg for 5 days, and group 2 (N = 30) received omeprazole
      20 mg for 28 days, ACA (amoxicillin 500 mg plus clavulanic acid 125 mg) 3 x 625
      mg for 7 days and metronidazole 3 x 500 mg for 5 days. Endoscopic examination,
      bioptic urease test and histologic examination were performed before, and 30 and 
      90 days after the treatment. Endoscopic examination was also performed one month 
      after the beginning of the treatment, when healing of duodenal ulcer was observed
      in 90% (27/30) of the group 1 patients and in 93.3% (28/30) of the group 2
      patients. The Helicobacter pylori eradication achieved in group 1 and 2 was 76.7%
      (23/30) and 83.3% (25/30), respectively. Side effects were present in 20% (6/30) 
      of the group 1 patients and in 23.3% (7/30) of the group 2 patients. Side effects
      were mild and did not require interruption of the treatment. A higher rate of
      eradication was achieved in group 2 than in group 1, but the difference was not
      statistically significant.

TI  - Efficacy of primed infusions with high dose ranitidine and omeprazole to maintain
      high intragastric pH in patients with peptic ulcer bleeding: a prospective
      randomised controlled study.
PG  - 36-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: In healthy subjects, continuous infusions of high dose ranitidine and
      omeprazole produce high intragastric pH values. AIM: To test the hypothesis that 
      both drugs also maintain high intragastric pH values in patients with bleeding
      ulcers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In two parallel studies, 20 patients with bleeding 
      duodenal ulcers and 20 patients with bleeding gastric ulcers were randomly
      assigned to receive either ranitidine (0.25 mg/kg/hour after a bolus of 50 mg) or
      omeprazole (8 mg/hour after a bolus of 80 mg) for 24 hours. Intragastric pH was
      continuously recorded with a glass electrode placed 5 cm below the cardia.
      RESULTS: Both drugs rapidly raised the intragastric pH above 6. During the second
      12 hour period, however, the percentage of time spent below a pH of 6 was 0.15%
      with omeprazole and 20.1% with ranitidine (p = 0.0015) in patients with duodenal 
      ulcer; in patients with gastric ulcer it was 0.1% with omeprazole and 46.1% with 
      ranitidine (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Primed infusions of omeprazole after a bolus
      produced consistently high intragastric pH values in patients with bleeding
      peptic ulcers, whereas primed infusions with ranitidine were less effective
      during the second half of a 24 hour treatment course. This loss of effectiveness 
      may be due to tolerance.

TI  - Omeprazole, amoxicillin and bismuth for peptic ulcer healing and Helicobacter
      pylori eradication.
PG  - 47-50
AB  - A controlled, randomized study was performed in patients with active peptic ulcer
      disease and positive Helicobacter pylori (Hp) status to assess the clinical
      efficacy (endoscopic healing and eradication of Hp) of different combined
      treatments. In the first part of the study a treatment with omeprazole (CAS
      73590-58-6) (40 mg once daily) alone (group A) or in combination with
      tripotassium dicitrato bismuthate (TDB; 240 mg bid, group B) for 4 weeks was
      evaluated in 20 and 13 patients, respectively. As expected healing rates were
      high and comparable (75 vs. 85%), however, Hp-eradication was zero in both
      groups. In the subsequent second part of the trial group A (n = 19) received
      omeprazole (20 mg bid) for 2 weeks + amoxicillin (CAS 26787-78-0) tablets (1 g
      bid only 2nd week). Accumulated healing rate increased to 95% but Hp-eradication 
      was 37%. From group B only 8 patients participated in a second 4-week course of
      monotherapy with TDB. Whereas healing occurred in all individuals, Hp-eradication
      was still low (12.5%). In addition plasma levels (omeprazole, Bi) and urinary
      excretion (Bi) were monitored to test whether drug interaction and/or
      noncompliance of the patients could help to explain the clinical findings.
      Systemic availability of Bi was increased by the coadministration of omeprazole
      and plasma levels of omeprazole were in general higher in Hp-positive patients if
      compared to those of Hp-negative patients. The following conclusions could be
      drawn from the 4 parts of the study: Treatment of peptic ulcer disease with
      omeprazole either alone or in combination with TDB is effective for ulcer healing
      but not for eradicating Hp. Omeprazole seems to decrease the Hp-eradicating
      potential of Bi probably due to a drug interaction. A second treatment course
      with TDB is apparently not of much benefit. One week pretreatment with omeprazole
      does not affect healing but might attenuate Hp-eradication rate of subsequent
      combined treatment with amoxicillin. One week coadministration of amoxicillin is 
      not sufficient. The magnitude of omeprazole's plasma levels has no effect on
      Hp-eradication rates. As the numbers of patients in this study was relatively
      small these conclusions need to be confirmed by larger trials.

TI  - Short-term low-dose triple therapy with azithromycin, metronidazole and
      lansoprazole appears highly effective for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori.
PG  - 45-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the OCN (omeprazole, clarithromycin and nitroimidazoles)
      short-term low-dose regimens are regarded as 'the standard' in the treatment of
      Helicobacter pylori infection, azithromycin is a new-generation, acid-stable
      macrolide which may prove particularly useful for a new short-term low-dose
      triple therapy regimen. OBJECTIVE: To further improve OCN eradication treatments 
      by reducing both the number of pills and the total cost. METHODS: A new
      short-term low-dose triple therapy (LAM) using lansoprazole 30 mg once a day for 
      1 week, azithromycin 500 mg once a day for 3 days, and metronidazole 250 mg twice
      a day for the same 3 days, was administrated to 60 patients presenting with H.
      pylori-positive gastritis with or without peptic ulcer, and compared with the
      classic 'Bazzoli regimen' (OCT: omeprazole, clarithromycin, tinidazole) in 60
      matched patients. H. pylori infection before and after therapy was evaluated by a
      rapid urease test, conventional histology and toluidine-stained semi-thin
      sections. Three biopsies from the corpus and three from the antrum were taken
      during endoscopical examination before and 7-8 weeks after discontinuation of the
      treatment. Patient compliance, drug tolerance and drug costs were also taken into
      consideration. RESULTS: H. pylori infection was eradicated 7-8 weeks after
      treatment in 56 of the 60 patients in the LAM group (93.3%), and in 52 of the 57 
      patients in the OCT group who completed the treatment (91.2%), with no
      statistical difference. When gastric or duodenal ulceration was present, ulcer
      healing was observed in all cases. CONCLUSION: The new proposed short-term
      low-dose triple therapy (LAM) appears to be as effective as the OCT for the
      eradication of H. pylori infection. The new treatment, however, seems to have
      advantages in terms of drug tolerance, patient compliance and therapy cost.

TI  - Contemporary medical therapy for gastroesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 205-12, 217-8
AB  - Gastroesophageal reflux disease is a chronic disorder that requires long-term
      therapy in most patients. The appropriate medical therapy should be
      individualized to the severity of symptoms, the degree of esophagitis and the
      presence of other acid-reflux complications. Lifestyle changes should form the
      basis of any therapeutic approach. In patients with mild to moderate disease,
      initial therapy with histamine H2-receptor antagonists in conventional dosages is
      suggested. Prokinetic agents are potentially useful in patients with impaired
      esophageal or gastric motor function, but their efficacy as single agents does
      not appear to surpass that of standard doses of H2 blockers. Sucralfate, a
      cytoprotective agent, is an additional therapeutic option. For patients with more
      severe disease, omeprazole and lansoprazole provide unequaled healing rates and
      accelerated symptom relief. In most patients, maintenance therapy is vital.
      Surgery is indicated in patients whose disease is refractory to medical therapy
      and in those who develop complications not amenable to medical therapy.

TI  - Natural course of gastroesophageal reflux disease: 17-22 year follow-up of 60
      patients.
PG  - 37-41
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the long-term course of conservatively managed
      gastroesophageal reflux disease without H2-antagonists or omeprazole. METHODS:
      Design: Clinical trial, uncontrolled. Setting: Gastroenterological outpatient
      department of a teaching hospital. Patients: Sixty of 87 patients consecutively
      referred for severe gastroesophageal reflux symptoms and with objectively proven 
      pathological reflux. Measurements: Esophagoscopy, esophagography,
      cinecardiography of cardiac region, standard reflux test, and confirmatory
      Bernstein-Baker test. Follow-up included a standardized interview, esophagoscopy 
      with biopsy, and 24-h pH monitoring. RESULTS: At follow-up 17-22 yr after
      referral, symptoms were less than at the time of referral in 36 of the 50
      nonoperated patients (six now symptom-free), were unchanged in five, and were
      worse in nine patients. Medication for reflux symptoms was no longer used by 34
      of the nonoperated patients. The prevalence of erosive esophagitis fell from 40% 
      at referral to 27% at follow-up endoscopy; 42% of the studied patients had
      pathological 24-h pH, and the endoscopies revealed six new cases of Barrett's
      metaplasia. Of the 41 nonoperated patients examined with both endoscopy and 24-h 
      pH, 27 (66%) had erosive esophagitis and/or pathological pH values. Of the 10
      operated patients, all had fewer symptoms at follow-up than they had at referral 
      (nine were symptom-free). The prevalence of erosive esophagitis fell from 60% at 
      referral to 10% at follow-up. One of the 10 patients had pathological 24-h pH at 
      follow-up. Neither the presence of esophagitis or hiatal hernia nor the severity 
      of symptoms at the time of referral predicted the course of the disease of the
      conservatively treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: The severity of the symptoms
      declines in the long term, but pathological reflux persists in most of the
      conservatively treated patients. Thus, the reflux itself is not self-limiting,
      and therapy should be designed with this in mind.

TI  - Studies on the interrelation between Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, Helicobacter
      pylori, and proton pump inhibitor therapy.
PG  - 84-91
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The interrelation between Helicobacter pylori infection and
      proton pump inhibitor therapy in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is
      unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of these factors on 
      parameters of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. METHODS: Prevalence of H. pylori was
      determined by biopsy and antibody testing in 84 patients. The influence of H.
      pylori status on clinical and laboratory parameters of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome
      was evaluated. Seroconversion after surgery was assessed retrospectively in
      infected patients. RESULTS: The prevalence of H. pylori exposure was 23% (10%
      with active infection). Acid output was higher in H. pylori-negative patients,
      but other clinical and biochemical parameters did not differ. Parameters were
      also similar for patients determined to be H. pylori positive by histology or
      antibody testing alone. Seroconversion rates did not differ between those
      rendered or not rendered disease free despite a significant reduction in acid
      output. CONCLUSIONS: H. pylori infection is not a risk factor for peptic
      ulceration in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. The prevalence is lower
      than in the general population and much lower than for patients with idiopathic
      peptic ulcer disease. Long-term omeprazole therapy in H. pylori-positive patients
      with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome may-lead to a reduction in parietal cell mass.

      cure rates of Helicobacter pylori infection. The minimal inhibitory concentration
      of lansoprazole for H. pylori in vitro is lower than that for omeprazole,
      prompting interest in treatment with amoxicillin plus lansoprazole. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: H. pylori-infected patients with endoscopically documented duodenal
      ulcer either currently or within the past year were randomized to 14 days of (1) 
      lansoprazole, 30 mg bid, plus amoxicillin, 1 gm tid; (2) lansoprazole, 30 mg tid,
      plus amoxicillin, 1 gm tid; (3) lansoprazole, 30 mg tid alone; or (4)
      amoxicillin, 1 gm tid alone. Endoscopy was done at enrollment and at 4 to 6 weeks
      after completion of treatment or for recurrent symptoms. H. pylori status was
      assessed by culture and histology. Ulcer prevalence was evaluated at follow-up
      endoscopy. RESULTS: Two hundred sixty-two patients met enrollment criteria and
      were treated. By per-protocol analysis, H. pylori infection was cured in 57% of
      those treated with lansoprazole twice daily plus amoxicillin and in 67% of those 
      treated with lansoprazole three times daily plus amoxicillin, compared with 0%
      treated with lansoprazole alone or amoxicillin alone (p < .001 for dual therapy
      versus either monotherapy). Amoxicillin resistance was not observed. At follow-up
      endoscopy, ulcer prevalence was 17% in patients treated with lansoprazole twice
      daily plus amoxicillin, 23% in those treated with lansoprazole three times daily 
      plus amoxicillin, 33% in those treated with lansoprazole alone, and 35% in those 
      treated with amoxicillin alone (p = .024; lansoprazole twice daily plus
      amoxicillin versus amoxicillin alone). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with amoxicillin
      plus lansoprazole, 30 mg tid, led to cure of H. pylori infection in 67% of
      patients with active or recently healed duodenal ulcer.

TI  - Reinfection and duodenal ulcer relapse in south-east Asian patients following
      successful Helicobacter pylori eradication: results of a 2-year follow-up.
PG  - 1157-60
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the reinfection rate of Helicobacter pylori and duodenal
      ulcer relapse rate in a group of patients followed up long term. DESIGN:
      Prospective study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were followed up endoscopically
      at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after successful H. pylori eradication and duodenal
      ulcer healing. H. pylori status was determined by culture, rapid urease test,
      Gram's stain of a fresh tissue smear and histological examination of antral
      biopsies and rapid urease test and histological examination of corpus biopsies.
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Duodenal ulcer healing, H. pylori reinfection. RESULTS:
      Thirty-eight patients with duodenal ulcer disease (35 active, 3 healed) had
      successfully eradicated H. pylori following treatment with omeprazole/amoxycillin
      (n = 11), omeprazole/amoxycillin/metronidazole (n = 16) and colloidal bismuth
      subcitrate/ amoxycillin/metronidazole (n = 11). All patients with active duodenal
      ulcer had healed ulcers at the end of therapy. Thirty-five of 38 patients were
      seen according to schedule up to 2 years; two patients were seen up to 12 months 
      and one up to 6 months only. Reinfection with H. pylori was not recorded in any
      of our patients. Shallow duodenal ulcers were noted in three patients at 1-year
      follow-up, two of whom admitted to taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
      (NSAIDs); H. pylori status was negative in all three. Subsequent follow-up
      revealed spontaneous healing of the ulcers in all three patients. At 2 years, one
      patient whose H. pylori status was negative had recurrence of duodenal ulcer. All
      of the three patients who defaulted subsequent to follow-up were negative for H. 
      pylori and had healed ulcers on follow-up endoscopy at 6 and 12 months.
      CONCLUSION: Reinfection rate with H. pylori was zero in a group of South-East
      Asian patients who had successfully eradicated the infection. Duodenal ulcer
      relapse was also low (2.9%) in this group of patients at 2 years.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori eradication using one-week low-dose lansoprazole plus
      amoxycillin and either clarithromycin or azithromycin.
PG  - 997-1000
AB  - AIM: To evaluate and compare two 1-week low-dose triple therapies based on
      lansoprazole, amoxycillin and a macrolide in eradicating Helicobacter pylori.
      METHODS: Seventy consecutive patients, suffering from dyspeptic symptoms with H. 
      pylori infection, were randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups: (A)
      (LAC; n = 35) lansoprazole 30 mg once daily, amoxycillin 1000 mg b.d.,
      clarithromycin 250 mg b.d., all for 7 days; and (B) (LAA; n = 35) lansoprazole 30
      mg once daily and amoxycillin 1000 mg b.d., both for 7 days, plus azithromycin
      500 mg once daily for only 3 days. The H. pylori status was evaluated by means of
      histology and rapid urease test at entry and 8 weeks after treatment. RESULTS:
      Three patients did not complete the treatment: one in the LAC group was withdrawn
      owing to severe side-effects; two patients in the LAA group stopped the treatment
      prematurely. H. pylori eradication was obtained in 28 of 34 (82%; 95% CI =
      66-93%) patients in the LAC group and in 20 of 33 (61%; 95% CI = 42-77%) patients
      in the LAA group. The difference is significant (P < 0.029). On
      intention-to-treat analysis, the rates of eradication were (28 of 35 patients,
      80% in the LAC group and 20 of 35 patients, 57% in the LAA group. Side-effects
      occurred in nine (26%) and six (18%) patients in the LAC and LAA groups,
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose lansoprazole plus amoxycillin and
      clarithromycin is more effective than low-dose lansoprazole plus amoxycillin and 
      azithromycin, but it gave a greater incidence of side-effects.

TI  - Prescribing patterns for dyspepsia in primary care: a prospective study of
      selected general practitioners.
PG  - 889-95
AB  - AIM: To define prescribing patterns for symptomatic dyspeptic patients in a
      cross-section of general practitioners in Leeds, United Kingdom. METHODS: Nine
      general practitioners from a range of practices took part in a prospective
      observational study of prescribing patterns for dyspepsia. All consultations with
      symptomatic dyspeptic patients were recorded over a 4-month period. Symptoms were
      recorded as ulcer-like, reflux-like, or nonspecific, and details of recent
      therapy, previous investigations and any prescription issued were noted. RESULTS:
      257 consecutive consultations were recorded (new patients 23%, consulted before
      but not investigated 33%, previously investigated 44%). 93% of consultations
      resulted in a prescription (antacids 24%, prokinetic/motility agent 8%,
      H2-receptor antagonist 36%, proton pump inhibitor 24%, Helicobacter pylori
      eradication therapy 8%). 42.5% of new patients received an acid-suppressing drug 
      as first-line therapy, of which only 32% had tried over-the-counter remedies.
      Symptom-type (ulcer-like, reflux-like or nonspecific) significantly influenced
      choice of empiric therapy (P < 0.001), though prescribing was still variable.
      Although around 60% of patients with previously negative investigations or only
      minor disease received acid-suppressing drugs, such patients were six times more 
      likely to receive 'less potent' treatments (no prescription, antacid or motility 
      agent) than those with known acid-peptic disease (odds ratio 6.23, P < 0.01).
      Only 30% of patients with previously documented peptic ulcer received H. pylori
      eradication therapy, yet patients with a wide range of other diagnoses received
      this form of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Management guidelines may help to promote a 
      more consistent and selective use of newer treatments, and promote more
      cost-effective patient care.

TI  - Lansoprazole: a proton pump inhibitor.
PG  - 1425-36
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To summarize the published data on lansoprazole, a proton pump
      inhibitor approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in the treatment
      of duodenal ulcer, erosive esophagitis, and pathologic hypersecretory conditions 
      (e.g., Zollinger-Ellison syndrome). DATA SOURCES: Published data on lansoprazole 
      identified by MEDLINE searches (1985-1996), as well as other pertinent
      literature. STUDY SELECTION: Clinical efficacy trials discussed were limited to
      multicenter, double-blind, parallel group, prospective studies, where possible.
      DATA SYNTHESIS: Lansoprazole inhibits gastric acid secretion via inhibition of
      gastric hydrogen/potassium adenosine triphosphatase (H+,K(+)-ATPase), an enzyme
      of the gastric parietal cell membrane that forms part of the proton pump that
      performs the final step in the acid secretory process. Lansoprazole binds
      covalently to parietal cell H+,K(+)-ATPase, rendering it nonfunctional and
      inhibiting the secretion of gastric acid. In clinical trials, lansoprazole has
      been shown to be more effective than placebo and standard doses of histamine
      (H)2-receptor antagonists and as effective as standard doses of omeprazole for
      the treatment of peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux, Zollinger-Ellison
      syndrome, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug-induced lesions. CONCLUSIONS:
      Lansoprazole is safe and effective for the treatment of acid-related disorders.
      It is more effective than the H2-receptor antagonists and comparable to
      omeprazole for these indications. The choice between lansoprazole and omeprazole 
      is likely to be institution-specific and pharmacoeconomic.

TI  - Paroxysmal laryngospasm secondary to gastroesophageal reflux.
PG  - 1502-5
AB  - Over a 2-year period (1992 to 1994), 12 consecutive adult patients with
      paroxysmal laryngospasm were prospectively studied. All had had other symptoms of
      gastroesophageal reflux (GER); however, only 4 (33%) experienced symptoms of
      heartburn. Each patient underwent fiberoptic laryngeal examination, barium
      swallow/esophagography, and ambulatory, 24-hour, double-probe pH monitoring
      (pH-metry). Eleven (92%) of the 12 patients had evidence of GER on examination,
      and 10 (83%) had abnormal pH-metry, including 3 who demonstrated pharyngeal
      reflux while having normal total acid exposure times in the esophageal probe. All
      the patients responded to antireflux treatment, using dietary and lifestyle
      modifications and omeprazole, with complete cessation of the laryngospastic
      episodes. This study documents the role of GER in the etiology of paroxysmal
      laryngospasm, it highlights the advantages of double-probe pH-metry in diagnosing
      this extraesophageal manifestation of GER, and it demonstrates that antireflux
      therapy with omeprazole is effective in controlling GER-induced laryngospasm.

TI  - Comparison of once-daily doses of omeprazole (40 and 20 mg) and placebo in the
      treatment of benign gastric ulcer: a multicenter, randomized, double-blind study.
PG  - 2516-22
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this multicenter, randomized, double-blind study,
      conducted in 520 patients, was to compare the efficacy and safety of omeprazole
      (40 and 20 mg once daily) with placebo in the treatment of benign gastric ulcer. 
      METHODS: Treatment with omeprazole or placebo lasted 4 wk; those whose ulcers
      remained unhealed continued the same treatment regimen for an additional 4 wk.
      The effects of therapy were determined by endoscopy and assessment of GI
      symptoms. Safety and tolerability were evaluated through reported adverse events,
      physical examinations, and laboratory tests. RESULTS: At weeks 4 and 8, the
      proportion of patients with healed ulcers was significantly greater in the
      omeprazole 40- and 20-mg groups than in the placebo group (p < 0.01). At week 8, 
      the healing rate was significantly greater in the 40-mg group than in the 20-mg
      group (82.7 vs 74.8%, p < 0.05). In patients with large ulcers (>1 cm), the 40-mg
      regimen was associated with a significantly higher healing rate (78.9%) than both
      the 20-mg regimen (61.4%) and placebo (34.6%) at week 8 (p < 0.05 vs omeprazole
      20 mg; p < 0.01 vs placebo). Healing rates in patients with small ulcers were
      similar for the 40- and 20-mg groups. Omeprazole was well tolerated, with no
      significant differences versus placebo in the overall incidence of clinical or
      laboratory adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Omeprazole 40 and 20 mg, administered
      once daily, healed a significantly greater proportion of patients than did
      placebo. The 40-mg regimen offered significant advantages over the 20-mg regimen 
      in patients with large ulcers.

TI  - Marked increase in gastric acid secretory capacity after omeprazole treatment.
PG  - 649-53
AB  - BACKGROUND: In contrast with the histamine2 (H2) blockers, proton pump inhibitors
      have not been shown to give rebound hypersecretion of acid. Taking into
      consideration the hyperplasia of the enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell provoked by
      hypergastrinaemia secondary to profound acid inhibition and the central role of
      histamine from ECL cells in the regulation of acid secretion, the lack of any
      rebound acid hypersecretion after treatment with proton pump inhibitors has been 
      questioned. AIMS: To reassess the effect of treatment with omeprazole on
      post-treatment acid secretion. METHODS AND PATIENTS: Basal and pentagastrin
      stimulated acid secretion were determined in nine patients with reflux
      oesophagitis before and 14 days after termination of a 90 day treatment period
      with the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole (40 mg daily). Basal gastrin release
      were determined before and during omeprazole treatment. Furthermore, biopsy
      samples from the oxyntic mucosa were taken before and at the end of the treatment
      period for chemical (histamine and chromogranin A (CgA)) evaluation of the ECL
      cell mass. RESULTS: A substantial increase in meal stimulated gastrin release
      during omeprazole treatment resulted in an increased ECL cell mass. Furthermore, 
      CgA in serum increased during omeprazole treatment suggesting that serum CgA may 
      be used as a test to evaluate ECL cell hyperplasia. A significant increase in
      basal and a marked (50%) and significant increase in pentagastrin stimulated acid
      secretion were found after treatment with omeprazole. CONCLUSIONS: Increased acid
      secretion after a conventional treatment period with a proton pump inhibitor is
      probably due to ECL cell hyperplasia and may have negative consequences for acid 
      related diseases.

TI  - Randomised controlled trial of ranitidine versus omeprazole in combination with
      antibiotics for eradication of Helicobacter pylori.
PG  - 131-6
AB  - This study compared high dose ranitidine versus low dose omeprazole with
      antibiotics for the eradication of H pylori. 80 patients (mean age 48 years,
      range 18-75) who had H pylori infection were randomised in an investigator-blind 
      manner to either a two-week regime of omeprazole 20 mg daily, amoxycillin 500 mg 
      tid and metronidazole 400 mg tid (OAM), or ranitidine 600 mg bd, amoxycillin 500 
      mg tid and metronidazole 400 mg tid (RAM), or omeprazole 20 mg daily and
      clarithromycin 500 mg tid (OC), or omeprazole 20 mg daily and placebo (OP). H
      pylori was eradicated in 6 of 19 patients in the OAM group (32%); 8 of 18 in the 
      RAM group (44%), 4 of 15 in the OC group (27%); none of 18 in the OP group (0%). 
      [< P0.005 for OAM, RAM, OC vs OP; P = N.S. between OAM, RAM, OC]. Overall
      metronidazole resistance was unexpectedly high at 58%. Eradication rates in
      metronidazole sensitive patients were 71% (5/7) and 100% (3/3) for OAM and RAM
      respectively. In conclusion, H pylori eradication rates using high dose
      ranitidine plus amoxycillin and metronidazole may be similar to that of low dose 
      omeprazole in combination with the same antibiotics for omeprazole with
      clarithromycin. Overall eradication rates were low due to a high incidence of
      metronidazole resistance but were higher in metronidazole-sensitive patients.
      Even high dose ranitidine with two antibiotics achieves a relatively low
      eradication rate. These metronidazole-based regimens cannot be recommended in
      areas with a high incidence of metronidazole resistance.

TI  - Lack of pharmacokinetic interaction after administration of lansoprazole or
      omeprazole with prednisone.
PG  - 1064-71
AB  - In a recently reported case, administration of omeprazole, a "proton pump"
      inhibitor, was temporally associated with the clinical relapse of pemphigus in a 
      44-year-old woman whose condition had been stabilized with a fixed dose of
      prednisone, suggesting the possibility of a drug interaction. This
      placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, three-period crossover study was
      conducted to evaluate and compare the pharmacokinetics of prednisolone after a
      single dose of prednisone given during multi-dose administration of lansoprazole 
      or omeprazole. Lansoprazole (30 mg), omeprazole (40 mg), or placebo was
      administered once daily under fasted conditions for 7 days to healthy male
      volunteers. On the seventh day, a single dose of prednisone (40 mg) was
      administered concomitantly with the study medication, and plasma prednisolone
      concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography for 24
      hours thereafter. Two weeks separated the first doses of each study period.
      Eighteen volunteers entered the study; pharmacokinetic data were evaluable for 15
      participants. Safety data were evaluable for 16 participants in the
      lansoprazole/prednisone group; 17 in the omeprazole/ prednisone group; and 17 in 
      the placebo/prednisone group. The pharmacokinetic parameters for prednisolone,
      including the maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax), time to maximum
      plasma concentration (tmax), terminal-phase half-life (t1/2), and area under the 
      concentration-time curve, were comparable for the three regimens. Adverse events 
      (AEs) rated as possibly or probably drug related were reported by 50%, 24%, and
      47% for subjects in the lansoprazole, omeprazole, and placebo treatment groups,
      respectively. Headache was the most common drug-related AE. No serious AEs were
      reported, and no subject withdrew from the study because of an AE. Concomitant
      administration of lansoprazole or omeprazole does not affect the absorption,
      biotransformation, or disposition of a single dose of prednisone. All three
      treatment regimens were well tolerated.

TI  - Ecabet sodium eradicates Helicobacter pylori infection in gastric ulcer patients.
PG  - 59-62
AB  - Ecabet sodium (ecabet), a new agent that has protective effects on the gastric
      mucosa has anti-Helicobacter pylori effects, binding with urease to inhibit H.
      pylori activity, and causing the bacterial to become non-viable. Ecabet
      monotherapy eradicates H. pylori infection in Japanese monkeys. We investigated a
      new regimen that included ecabet to eradicate H. pylori infection in gastric
      ulcer patients. Fifty-five H. pylori-positive patients with gastric ulcer were
      randomly assigned to one of two groups: group 1 received dual therapy with
      lansoprazole (30 mg o.d.) for 8 weeks plus clarithromycin (200 mg b.i.d.) or
      amoxicillin (250 mg q.i.d.) for 2 weeks. Group 2 received triple therapy with
      lansoprazole (30 mg o.d.) and ecabet sodium (1.0 g b.i.d.) for 8 weeks plus
      clarithromycin (200 mg b.i.d.) or amoxicillin (250 mg q.i.d.) for 2 weeks. Four
      weeks after the treatment was withdrawn, H. pylori status was evaluated by
      histological examination, rapid urease test, and culture. The eradication rate
      was 26% (7 out of 27 patients) in group 1 and 79% (22 out of 28 patients) in
      group 2. All patients completed the treatment. The addition of ecabet to the
      regimen increased the eradication rate of H. pylori infection, and there were no 
      associated major side effects.

TI  - Significant increase in eradication rates of Helicobacter pylori infection with
      two consecutive dual therapies (omeprazole and amoxycillin or omeprazole and
      clarithromycin). A randomized study in 450 Spanish patients.
PG  - 48-52
AB  - Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with peptic ulcer disease and chronic
      gastritis, and eradication of the microorganism markedly reduces the recurrence
      of peptic ulcer. However, a major problem is the choice of a treatment that is
      effective, has high eradication rate, and is well tolerated by patients. We
      evaluated the eradication of H. pylori infection in patients with chronic
      gastritis (CG), duodenal ulcer (DU), and gastric ulcer (GU) after two dual
      therapies (omeprazole with either amoxycillin or clarithromycin). Of 450 patients
      initially included in the study, 207 had CG, 187 DU and 56 GU, and all presented 
      with H. pylori infection. Diagnosis was made from endoscope examination, biopsy
      samples, rapid urease test and 13C-urea breath test (UBT). H. pylori infection
      was considered to be present when two of the tests had positive results. All
      patients were randomized to one of two regimens: (A) omeprazole (20 mg b.i.d.)
      plus amoxycillin (750 mg t.i.d.) or (B) omeprazole (40 mg b.i.d.) plus
      clarithromycin (500 mg t.i.d.). The duration of each of the regimens was 2 weeks.
      Fifty-eight patients who showed H. pylori infection after the first treatment (27
      with CG, 24 with DU, and 7 with GU) were allocated to a second therapy. H. pylori
      eradication was assessed by UBT, 6 weeks after the end of the therapies; positive
      values were those higher than 5 delta units. A second consecutive dual therapy of
      omeprazole plus an antibiotic (amoxycillin or clarithromycin) not used in the
      first therapy improved on the eradication rates obtained with the first regimen. 
      The overall eradication rates were also higher, but no significant differences
      were found between amoxycillin and clarithromycin. The best results were obtained
      in those patients with GU.

TI  - Therapeutic options after failed Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy.
PG  - 2333-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Many of the currently used Helicobacter pylori eradication regimens
      fail to cure 5-20% of the patients. Those patients will remain at risk of
      developing a potentially fatal complication of peptic ulcer disease. Therefore, a
      new attempt to cure H. pylori infection after initial failure of therapy is
      indicated. We studied the efficacy of three retreatment regimens after initial
      failure of omeprazole-amoxicillin dual therapy. METHODS: Fifty-three patients
      whose treatment failed were randomly assigned to receive retreatment with the
      same regimen of omeprazole 20 mg b.i.d. (group I) or omeprazole 40 mg t.i.d.
      (group II) plus amoxicillin 750 mg t.i.d. for 14 days. Forty patients in whom the
      omeprazole-amoxicillin retreatment failed were assigned to receive omeprazole 20 
      mg b.i.d., amoxicillin 750 mg t.i.d., and metronidazole 500 mg t.i.d. for 14 days
      (group III) or omeprazole 20 mg b.i.d. plus clarithromycin 500 mg t.i.d. for 14
      days (group IV). H. pylori infection was assessed by culture and histology of
      gastric biopsies before and 4-6 wk after cessation of therapy. Susceptibility of 
      H. pylori to amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and metronidazole was determined by the
      E test. RESULTS: In groups I (n = 28) and II (n = 25), cure of H. pylori
      infection was achieved in 21% and 28% of patients, respectively (not
      significant). In groups III (n = 20) and IV (n = 20), H. pylori infection was
      cured in 75% and 70%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Retreatment with an identical
      omeprazole-amoxicillin dual regimen is of limited benefit, a result that is
      independent of the omeprazole dose. In contrast, a third H. pylori eradication
      attempt with omeprazole-clarithromycin dual therapy or
      omeprazole-amoxicillin-metronidazole triple therapy provides reasonable cure
      rates after failure of omeprazole-amoxicillin dual therapy.

TI  - Gastroesophageal reflux disease. The long and the short of therapeutic options.
PG  - 76-80, 85-6, 89
AB  - Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common and treatable condition.
      Initial therapy includes lifestyle modifications, avoidance of certain
      medications, and use of antacids, alginic acid preparations, and over-the-counter
      histamine2 (H2) receptor antagonists. Escalation of therapy for acute disease
      relies primarily on H2 receptor antagonists given in conventional dosages.
      Although H2 receptor antagonists remain the cornerstone of therapy, sucralfate
      and promotility agents, especially cisapride, may offer alternatives. Most cases 
      of GERD that are resistant to these therapies can be reliably healed with proton 
      pump inhibitors (PPIs). Patients whose GERD is healed with one of the
      aforementioned agents often relapse unless they receive further therapy. For
      patients with mild disease, H2 receptor antagonists, cisapride, or a combination 
      of the two may prevent recurrent symptoms. In severe disease, PPIs are the agents
      of first choice, but concerns about the safety of long-term use must be
      considered. In selected patients, surgery offers an option for long-term control 
      of GERD. With present surgical techniques, symptom relief can be obtained with
      little risk of complications.

TI  - Adult asthma and gastro-oesophageal reflux: the effects of omeprazole therapy on 
      asthma.
PG  - 671-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 40-60% of patients with asthma have gastro-oesophageal 
      reflux (GOR) and it has been postulated that this may worsen asthma severity.
      AIMS: To investigate the effect of the potent gastric acid inhibitor omeprazole
      40 mg orally daily on peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), asthma symptoms and
      histamine bronchial responsiveness in adult patients with both asthma and GOR.
      METHODS: This was a double blind, randomised, placebo controlled, crossover
      study. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, 24 hour oesophageal pH measurements,
      spirometry and histamine bronchoprovocation test (HIT) were performed prior to
      entry. Phase 1:2 week placebo run-in period, with baseline recording of PEFR,
      asthma and GOR symptoms, and use of inhaled beta 2-agonist. Phase 2: patients
      randomised to receive either placebo or omeprazole 40 mg/d for four weeks. Phase 
      3: placebo for two weeks. Phase 4: patients crossed over to opposite treatment
      from that of phase 2. Spirometry, and diary cards were assessed at beginning and 
      end of phases 2 and 4. HIT was performed at the end of phase 2 and at the
      beginning and end of phase 4. RESULTS: Twenty patients (eight female and 12 male)
      completed the study. The evening but not morning PEFR (% predicted) were
      significantly higher on omeprazole vs placebo (82 +/- 4% SEM vs 79 +/- 4% SEM; p 
      < 0.05). No significant differences were found in FEV1, FVC, histamine bronchial 
      responsiveness and diurnal variation of PEFR between placebo and omeprazole
      treatments. Similarly, there were no significant differences during placebo and
      omeprazole periods in day time wheeze, cough, breathlessness, beta 2-agonist use 
      or night time wheeze and breathlessness. Day and night heartburn symptoms were
      significantly better on omeprazole vs placebo (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Omeprazole
      40 mg daily improved evening PEFR in asthma patients with GOR. However, asthma
      symptoms, inhaled beta 2-agonist use and histamine bronchial responsiveness did
      not change.

TI  - Omeprazole versus ranitidine: short-term triple-therapy in patients with
      Helicobacter pylori-positive duodenal ulcers.
PG  - 829-31
AB  - AIM: To compare the results of two short triple-therapy regimens, different only 
      in the antisecretory drugs used, in patients with active duodenal ulcer and
      Helicobacter pylori infection. METHODS: All patients received a combination of
      clarithromycin 250 mg b.d. and tinidazole 500 mg b.d. for 1 week, in addition to 
      an antisecretory drug: omeprazole 20 mg (50 patients) or ranitidine 300 mg (50
      patients) twice daily for 1 week, followed by a single daily dose for a further 3
      weeks. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, with rapid urease test and histological 
      examination of antral and corpus biopsies, was performed prior to the treatment
      and at least 2 months after the discontinuation of the antisecretory therapy.
      RESULTS: Duodenal ulcer healing was documented in all patients at the endoscopic 
      examination after therapy. H. pylori eradication was achieved in 46 of 50
      patients (92%, 95% CI = 85-99%) in the omeprazole group and in 43 of 50 patients 
      (86%, 95% CI = 76-96%) in the ranitidine group: the difference is not
      significant. CONCLUSION: Omeprazole or ranitidine, in combination with
      clarithromycin and tinidazole, are equally effective in the eradication of H.
      pylori infection and healing of duodenal ulcers.

TI  - Effects of lansoprazole plus amoxycillin on the cure of Helicobacter pylori
      infection in Japanese peptic ulcer patients.
PG  - 821-7
AB  - AIM: The effect of lansoprazole plus amoxycillin on curing Helicobacter pylori
      infection and peptic ulcer recurrence was evaluated. METHOD: The study group was 
      composed of 68 patients with gastric ulcers and 51 with duodenal ulcers, all were
      H. pylori-positive. The participants were assigned at random to the lansoprazole 
      alone group (lansoprazole 30 mg o.m. for 6 or 8 weeks) or the lansoprazole plus
      amoxycillin group (lansoprazole alone regimen plus amoxycillin at 500 mg q.d.s.
      concomitantly for the first 2 weeks). Healed patients were not given maintenance 
      treatment with acid secretion inhibitors. The cure rate for H. pylori infection
      and the ulcer recurrence rate after 1 year were investigated. RESULT: The cure
      rate for H. pylori infection was 4.2% in patients receiving lansoprazole alone
      and 38.5% in patients receiving lansoprazole plus amoxycillin (P < 0.01) for
      gastric ulcers, and 0% in patients receiving lansoprazole alone and 61.9% in
      patients receiving lansoprazole plus amoxycillin (P < 0.001) for duodenal ulcers.
      The recurrence rate was 42.3% in patients receiving lansoprazole alone and 28.6% 
      in patients receiving lansoprazole plus amoxycillin for gastric ulcers, and 66.7%
      for patients receiving lansoprazole alone and 11.1% for patients receiving
      lansoprazole plus amoxycillin (P < 0.001) for duodenal ulcers. None of the
      patients with gastric or duodenal ulcers cured of H. pylori infection had a
      recurrence. CONCLUSION: Concomitant use of lansoprazole and amoxycillin increased
      the curative effects on H. pylori infection. However, the cure rates with this
      regimen remained inadequate.

TI  - Misoprostol and omeprazole in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced acute
      gastroduodenal mucosal injury. A randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study.
PG  - 1477-82
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy (CT) may induce acute mucosal injury to the stomach and 
      duodenum, but its prevention has been scarcely investigated. METHODS: One hundred
      and eighty-two cancer patients with normal stomach and duodenum or having fewer
      than 3 erosions, selected to be treated with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 
      5-fluorouracil (CMF) (77 breast carcinoma patients) or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (105
      colon carcinoma patients), were randomly assigned to prophylactic treatment with 
      misoprostol, 400 micrograms twice a day; omeprazole, 20 mg once a day; or
      placebo, 1 tablet twice a day. Seven days after the end of the second source of
      CT, all patients underwent control esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Endoscopic
      findings were quantified on the basis of an arbitrary score: 0 = normal; 1 = less
      than 3 erosions; 2 = 3-15 erosions; 3 = more than 15 erosions or ulcer; 4 = giant
      ulcer (greatest dimension of more than 2 cm) or multiple ulcers with cumulative
      greatest dimension exceeding 2 cm. RESULTS: Mean score increased significantly in
      the placebo and misoprostol groups, either after CMF (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05,
      respectively) or after 5-FU (P < 0.001 for both), whereas it did not in the
      omeprazole group. Gastric and duodenal ulcers were significantly less frequent in
      patients receiving omeprazole than in those receiving placebo (P < 0.05 after
      both CMF and 5-FU). No significant difference was observed between placebo and
      misoprostol. Omeprazole was significantly more effective than placebo and
      misoprostol in reducing the frequency and degree of the endoscopic worsening,
      either after CMF or after 5-FU (P < 0.05 for both CT regimens). Epigastric pain
      and/or heartburn were significantly less frequent in patients receiving
      omeprazole than in those receiving placebo (P < 0.01) or misoprostol (P < 0.001).
      CONCLUSIONS: The strong and prolonged inhibition of gastric acid production
      induced by omeprazole seems to be effective in preventing chemotherapy-induced
      gastroduodenal mucosal injury. Further trials are necessary to verify whether
      such a prevention of endoscopically observed injury can translate into prevention
      of clinically significant injury.

TI  - Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 983-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in 
      adults with esophageal complications (esophagitis, stricture, adenocarcinoma, or 
      Barrett metaplasia) or extraesophageal complications (otolaryngological
      manifestations and asthma). DATA SOURCES: Peer-reviewed publications located via 
      MEDLINE or cross-citation. STUDY SELECTION: Emphasis was placed on new
      developments in diagnosis and therapeutics. Thus, fewer than 10% of identified
      citations are discussed. DATA EXTRACTION: Controlled therapeutic trials were
      emphasized. The validity of pathophysiological observations and uncontrolled
      trials were critiqued by the author. DATA SYNTHESIS: Esophagitis is typically a
      chronic, recurring disorder treated with long-term antisecretory therapy,
      titrated to disease severity. Laparoscopic [correction of Laparascopic]
      antireflux surgery is an alternative strategy, but neither long-term efficacy
      data nor an appropriate controlled trial comparing it with proton pump inhibitor 
      therapy exists. The main risk of esophagitis is adenocarcinoma arising from
      Barrett metaplasia, the incidence of which is increasing. Strong evidence
      suggests that both reflux-induced asthma and otolaryngological complications
      (subglottic stenosis, laryngitis, pharyngitis, or cancer) can occur without
      esophagitis. While the otolaryngological manifestations usually respond to
      antisecretory medications, reflux-induced asthma responds convincingly only to
      antireflux surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Although esophagitis and GERD symptoms
      predictably respond to antisecretory medicines, the risk of adenocarcinoma from
      Barrett metaplasia dictates that if heartburn is refractory to treatment, chronic
      (>5 years), or accompanied by dysphagia, odynophagia, or bleeding, it should be
      evaluated by endoscopy. Thereafter, patients with Barrett metaplasia require
      surveillance endoscopy to control the cancer risk. Reflux-induced asthma remains 
      a vexing problem in the absence of either medical therapy or proven efficacy of a
      reliable mechanism of prospectively identifying affected patients.

TI  - Effectiveness of quadruple therapy using lansoprazole, instead of omeprazole, in 
      curing Helicobacter pylori infection.
PG  - 145-50
AB  - BACKGROUND: Omeprazole enhances the efficacy of bismuth-based triple therapy. It 
      is unknown whether the same is true for other proton pump inhibitors.
      Lansoprazole has superior anti-Helicobacter activity in vitro and possibly also
      in vivo; therefore we investigated quadruple therapy with lansoprazole. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: In two studies performed in separate hospitals, a total of 67
      Helicobacter pylori-positive patients were treated with 7-day quadruple therapy
      (lansoprazole, colloidal bismuth subcitrate, tetracycline, and metronidazole)
      after 3 days of lansoprazole pretreatment. Testing for cure was done by endoscopy
      in study 1 and by breath test in study 2. RESULTS: Cure rates per protocol were
      31 of 31 (100%) in study 1 and 30 of 32 (94%) in study 2. Intention-to-treat cure
      rates were 31 of 35 (89%) in study 1 and 30 of 32 (94%) in study 2. Cured overall
      were 32 of 34 with a metronidazole sensitive strain and 3 of 3 with a
      metronidazole-resistant strain. Data on side effects were collected from 51
      patients. Twelve (21%) had no side effects, 27 (53%) had mild side effects, 10
      (20%) had moderate side effects, but only 2 (4%) had severe side effects. Side
      effects, never were the reason that a patient stopped taking the medication.
      CONCLUSIONS: The results with lansoprazole-quadruple therapy are comparable to
      the historic control group treated with omeprazole-quadruple therapy. The cure
      rare is very high, and although mild to moderate side effects occurred in many
      patients, everybody finished the treatment regime.

TI  - Eradication of Helicobacter pylori using one-week triple therapies combining
      omeprazole with two antimicrobials: the MACH I Study.
PG  - 138-44
AB  - BACKGROUND: Eradication of Helicobacter pylori provides potential cure in the
      majority of patients with peptic ulcer disease, and eradication rates of more
      than 90% have been reported, using omeprazole in combination with two
      antimicrobials. The choice of antimicrobials, dose regimen and duration of
      treatment have varied between studies, however, and an optimal treatment still
      has to be established. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted an international,
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving more than 100
      patients in each of six treatment groups in 43 hospital gastrointestinal units in
      Canada, Germany, Ireland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Patients (n = 787) with
      proved duodenal ulcer disease were randomized to treatment twice daily for 1 week
      with omeprazole, 20 mg (O), plus either placebo (P) or combinations of two of the
      following antimicrobials: amoxicillin, 1 gm (A), clarithromycin, 250 or 500 mg
      (C250, C500), or metronidazole, 400 mg (M). Eradication of H. pylori was
      evaluated by 13C-UBT, performed before and 4 weeks after treatment cessation.
      RESULTS: The eradication rates for the all-patients-treated analysis were 96%,
      OAC500; 95%, OMC250; 90%, OMC500; 84%, OAC250; 79%, OAM; and 1%, OP. OAC500 and
      OMC250 achieved eradication rates with lower 95% confidence interval limits
      exceeding 90%. All regimens were well-tolerated, 96% of patients complied with
      their dose regimen, and 2.3% of the patients discontinued treatment owing to
      adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Omeprazole triple therapies given twice daily for 1 
      week produce high eradication rates, are well-tolerated, and are associated with 
      high patient compliance. The two most effective therapies were those combining
      omeprazole, 20 mg, with either amoxicillin, 1 gm, plus clarithromycin, 500 mg, or
      metronidazole, 400 mg, plus clarithromycin, 250 mg, all given twice daily.

TI  - Double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled evaluation of clarithromycin and
      omeprazole for Helicobacter pylori-associated duodenal ulcer.
PG  - 130-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Eradication of Helicobacter pylori leads to faster ulcer healing and 
      a significant decrease in ulcer recurrence. Clarithromycin is the most effective 
      monotherapy for eradicating H. pylori from the gastric mucosa, and omeprazole
      frequently is used for the treatment of duodenal ulcer disease, prompting the
      interest to investigate rigorously the combination of clarithromycin and
      omeprazole for eradicating H. pylori. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The aim of this
      double-blind, randomized, multicenter (n = 30), multinational (n = 10) study was 
      to compare clarithromycin and omeprazole with omeprazole monotherapy for the
      eradication of H. pylori from the gastric mucosa, endoscopic healing, and
      reduction of symptoms and ulcer recurrence in patients with active duodenal
      ulcer. Patients with active duodenal ulcer associated with H. pylori infection
      were randomized to receive omeprazole, 40 mg every morning for 14 days, with
      either clarithromycin, 500 mg, or placebo three times daily, which was followed
      by omeprazole, 20 mg every morning for 14 days. Patients underwent endoscopy
      before enrolling in the study, immediately after finishing treatment, and at 4-
      to 6-week and 6-month follow-up evaluations or at the recurrence of symptoms.
      RESULTS: Two hundred and eight patients with active duodenal ulcer associated
      with confirmed H. pylori infection were randomized to treatment with either
      clarithromycin and omeprazole (n = 102) or omeprazole and placebo (n = 106). Four
      to six weeks after treatment was completed, H. pylori was eradicated in 74% (95% 
      confidence interval, 63.0%-82.4%) of patients receiving clarithromycin and
      omeprazole, compared with 1% (0.0%-6.2%) of patients receiving omeprazole
      monotherapy (p < .001). Clarithromycin resistance developed in eight patients
      treated with clarithromycin and omeprazole and in none given omeprazole and
      placebo. Ulcers, which were healed following treatment in more than 95% of study 
      patients, recurred by the 6-month follow-up visit in 10% (5%-19%) of dual therapy
      recipients, compared with 50% (39%-61%) of those who took omeprazole alone (p <
      .001). CONCLUSION: Clarithromycin and omeprazole dual therapy is simple and
      well-tolerated and leads to consistently high eradication rates for patients with
      duodenal ulcer associated with H. pylori infection.

TI  - Evaluation of the efficacy and tolerability of four different therapeutic
      regimens for the Helicobacter pylori eradication.
PG  - 145-9
AB  - The aim of our study is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of four
      different therapeutic regimens for Helicobacter pylori eradication. One-hundred
      and thirty-two consecutive patients suffering from either peptic ulcer or
      non-ulcer dyspepsia, with Helicobacter pylori infection, were allocated to one of
      the following 4 groups with different therapeutic regimens: A) omeprazole 20 mg
      bid for 14 days/amoxycillin 1000 mg bid for 14 days/tinidazole 500 mg bid for 14 
      days (30 patients, 13 with peptic ulcer); B) omeprazole 20 mg bid for 14
      days/amoxycillin 1000 mg bid for 14 days (41 patients, 23 with peptic ulcer); C) 
      omeprazole 20 mg bid for 14 days/azithromycin 500 mg/day for 3 days for 2
      consecutive weeks (25 patients, 12 with peptic ulcer); D) omeprazole 20 mg/day
      for 7 days/clarithromycin 250 mg bid for 7 days/tinidazole 500 mg bid for 7 days/
      (36 patients, 14 with peptic ulcer). The Helicobacter pylori status was evaluated
      by means of histology, culture and urease test, at entry and 8 weeks after
      treatment. 2 group A, B and D patients, 1 D patient didn't complete the
      treatment. In evaluable patients, the Helicobacter pylori eradication was
      obtained in 24 patients of group A (85.71%), in 24 of group B (58.98%), in 11 of 
      group C (45.83%) and in 24 of group D (70.58%). On intention-to-treat analysis,
      Helicobacter pylori eradication was 80% in group A, 56.09% in group B, 44% in
      group D and 66.67% in group D. Sideeffects occurred in 6 patients of group A
      (20.68%), in 5 of group B (12.5%), in 3 group D (8.82%) and none of group C. In
      conclusion, triple therapy with omeprazole/clarithro-mycin/tinidazole is better
      for cost/benefit ratio; omeprazole/amoxycillin/tinidazole is more effective than 
      others regimens in the Helicobacter pylori eradication, but causes more side
      effects; double therapy with omeprazole/azithromycin is the most tolerable and
      the least efficacy for Helicobacter pylori eradication.

      disease.
PG  - 1035-68
AB  - This article reviews the management of severe upper gastrointestinal bleeding in 
      the patient with chronic liver diseases. The initial assessment, diagnostic
      work-up, and treatment options for variceal and nonvariceal bleeding are
      discussed. The role of diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopy for esophagogastric
      varices is reviewed with special emphasis on new endoscopic techniques including 
      variceal band ligation and cyanoacrylate injection. Various pharmacologic,
      surgical, and radiologic treatment options for variceal bleeding also are
      discussed. In addition, nonvariceal causes of severe upper gastrointestinal
      bleeding are reviewed including peptic ulcer diseases, Mallory-Weiss tear, portal
      hypertensive gastropathy, and gastric antral vascular ectasia.

TI  - 4-day lansoprazole quadruple therapy: a highly effective cure for Helicobacter
      pylori infection.
PG  - 1778-82
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We have advocated quadruple therapy as the optimal therapy for cure
      of Helicobacter pylori infection. In this study, we investigated the efficacy and
      tolerability of 4-day therapy with lansoprazole, bismuth, tetracycline, and
      metronidazole. METHODS: In a prospective open study, 51 consecutive patients,
      most of them with chronic peptic ulcer disease and biopsy proven H. pylori
      infection, received 4-day lansoprazole quadruple therapy after 3 days of
      lansoprazole pretreatment. Repeat endoscopy was performed 6 wk later, with antral
      and corpus biopsies for rapid urease test, histology, and culture. A patient was 
      considered cured if three methodologies had negative results. RESULTS: By
      intention-to-treat, 48 of 51 patients (94%) (95% CI 84%-99%) were cured; per
      protocol, 48 of 49 (98%) (95% CI 89%-100%) were cured. In 14 patients, the
      bacterial isolates were tested for metronidazole susceptibility: 12/12 with a
      sensitive strain were cured, as were 2/2 with a resistant strain. The regimen was
      well tolerated. Most side effects were mild, and none caused treatment to be
      stopped prematurely. CONCLUSIONS: Four-day lansoprazole quadruple therapy
      achieves a very high cure rate in an unselected population of mainly ulcer
      patients. Furthermore, the regimen is short, can be used in patients allergic to 
      penicillin, and is well tolerated, with no dropouts due to side effects.
      Presently, this regimen should be used only in patients with a
      metronidazole-sensitive pre-treatment bacterial isolate. When empiric treatment
      is used, 7-day quadruple therapy remains the therapy of choice, because it has
      well-documented efficacy against metronidazole-resistant strains. Further studies
      are needed to define the optimal treatment duration for quadruple therapy in
      patients with metronidazole-resistant strains.

TI  - Omeprazole versus ranitidine or ranitidine/metoclopramide in poorly responsive
      symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 1766-72
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate complete symptom resolution, mucosal healing, and
      tolerability of omeprazole, ranitidine, or ranitidine/metoclopramide in patients 
      with poorly responsive, symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
      METHODS: Adults with persistent symptomatic GERD after ranitidine treatment were 
      stratified by esophagitis grade and randomized to omeprazole 20 mg once daily,
      ranitidine HCI 150 mg twice daily, or ranitidine HCI 150 mg twice daily plus
      metoclopramide HCI 10 mg four times daily. Endoscopies were conducted at baseline
      and at wk 4 and 8. Patients assessed overall symptom improvement at wk 4 and 8
      and evaluated daytime and nighttime heartburn, dysphagia, and acid regurgitation 
      daily. RESULTS: After 1 wk, 13% of patients receiving omeprazole (N = 100) had
      complete resolution of all GERD symptoms versus 1% and 3% of patients receiving
      ranitidine (N = 97) or ranitidine/metoclopramide (N = 93), respectively (p <
      0.001). More patients receiving omeprazole had complete symptom resolution at wk 
      4 (33%) and at the end of the study (64%; both p < 0.001) than patients receiving
      ranitidine (8% and 28%, respectively) or ranitidine/metoclopramide (7% and 29%,
      respectively). Regardless of baseline esophagitis grade, more patients receiving 
      omeprazole had complete symptom resolution. At wk 8, more than 91% of patients
      with grade 0 or 1 esophagitis at baseline were still healed irrespective of
      treatment. At wk 8, 80% of patients with esophagitis grade 2 or higher at entry
      were healed with omeprazole (p < 0.001 vs ranitidine [40%] and
      ranitidine/metoclopramide [46%]). Thirty-four percent of patients reported an
      adverse event. Significantly more patients receiving combination treatment
      reported an adverse event than patients treated with single agents. CONCLUSIONS: 
      In patients with persistent GERD symptoms after ranitidine, omeprazole (20 mg
      daily for up to 8 wk) provides faster and more complete resolution of common GERD
      symptoms than continued ranitidine (300 mg daily) alone or in combination with
      metoclopramide (40 mg daily). Omeprazole provides significantly higher rates of
      endoscopic healing than ranitidine alone or with metoclopramide. Omeprazole and
      ranitidine are generally well tolerated. The addition of metoclopramide to
      ranitidine significantly increases adverse events.

TI  - Lansoprazole prevents recurrence of erosive reflux esophagitis previously
      resistant to H2-RA therapy. The Lansoprazole Maintenance Study Group.
PG  - 1758-65
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This randomized, double-blind study was designed to determine whether 
      the proton pump inhibitor lansoprazole could prevent relapse among patients with 
      healed erosive reflux esophagitis that had been resistant to healing with at
      least 3 months of H2-receptor antagonist therapy. RESULTS: By the end of the
      year, 13% of placebo patients remained healed compared with 67% of lansoprazole
      15 mg and 55% of lansoprazole 30 mg patients (p < 0.001 for time to first
      relapse). All placebo patients were symptomatic by the end of the study whereas
      only one-third of the lansoprazole patients was symptomatic at the end of the
      12-month study period. The two lansoprazole doses were comparably effective in
      maintaining healing and in symptom control and were well tolerated. Fasting serum
      gastrin values increased significantly to about 1.5-2 times the baseline values
      over the first 2 months of lansoprazole treatment; no further increase was noted.
      CONCLUSION: Erosive relapse can be prevented in most patients for up to 1 yr with
      lansoprazole 15 mg or 30 mg once daily.

TI  - Pulmonary symptoms associated with gastroesophageal reflux: use of ambulatory pH 
      monitoring to diagnose and to direct therapy.
PG  - 1715-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: We studied 54 patients with chronic persistent cough or asthma
      suspected to be due to reflux using distal and proximal pH monitoring. Therapy
      for reflux was determined by the referring physician and included H2 blockers
      (51%), omeprazole (36%), surgery (10%), and lifestyle modifications only (3%). On
      follow-up evaluation, the effect of anti-reflux therapy on pulmonary symptoms
      (PS) was scored as excellent, good, fair, no change, or worsening symptoms.
      RESULTS: Forty-two of the 54 patients (78%) had abnormal reflux. Of these, 28
      patients (67%) had abnormal proximal acid exposure. Seventy-one percent of reflux
      patients achieved good to excellent response in PS from anti-reflux therapy. The 
      response was not significantly different between patients with proximal reflux
      and those with only distal reflux. None of the patients without documented reflux
      who nevertheless received anti-reflux therapy had a response, even when fair
      improvement was included as a response. Seventeen percent of patients whose
      pulmonary symptoms responded to anti-reflux therapy would not have been
      recognized as having abnormal reflux if proximal pH monitoring had not been done.
      CONCLUSIONS: The percentage of patients (78%) with pulmonary symptoms having
      abnormal reflux is consistent with prior studies. Documenting abnormal
      gastroesophageal reflux helps direct appropriate therapy, and proximal pH
      monitoring may identify patients with pulmonary symptoms who respond to
      anti-reflux therapy.

TI  - Quality of life scale for gastroesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 217-24
AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment of uncomplicated gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is 
      primarily to improve the symptoms of the patient. However, measurement of
      symptomatic outcome is difficult because it is as the patient perceives it to be 
      and not "objective." This creates a need to develop a simple and understandable
      instrument to measure symptomatic outcome. STUDY DESIGN: All patients referred
      for evaluation of GERD were eligible for this prospective study. During the
      initial visit, patients were asked to complete the Gastroesophageal Reflux Data
      Sheet. This ten-item questionnaire included an overall assessment of
      satisfaction; the best possible score was 0, and the worst was 45. The evaluation
      included history, physical examination, and additional studies, including upper
      gastrointestinal series, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, esophageal manometry, and
      24-hour esophageal pH monitoring as indicated. Initial treatment was medical with
      histamine2-blockers, omeprazole, cisapride, or both. If a patient was
      dissatisfied with medical treatment and had both a hypotensive lower esophageal
      sphincter and abnormal results of the 24-hour pH monitoring, then operative
      treatment with either laparoscopic or open Nissen or Toupet fundoplication was
      offered. After approximately three months of medical treatment or one month after
      operative treatment, patients were asked to complete the questionnaire again.
      Data were analyzed using nonparametric tests and linear regression analysis.
      RESULTS: A total of 72 patients were assessed, and 100 percent of them completed 
      the questionnaire. Patients who were satisfied with their condition had a median 
      health-related quality of life (HRQL) score of five, and those who were
      dissatisfied had a median score of 26 (p < 0.000001). Patients who ultimately
      chose surgical therapy had a median preoperative score of 28, compared with 15
      for patients who chose to continue medical therapy (p = 0.0001). The change in
      HRQL score from before treatment to after treatment for surgical patients was 27 
      compared with 11 for medically treated patients (p < 0.002). Items 1 through 6 of
      the questionnaire were individually sensitive to the effects of treatment.
      However, there was no correlation between HRQL and the composite pH score or with
      the lower esophageal sphincter pressure. CONCLUSIONS: This HRQL score has
      advantages over standard health status instruments for GERD including simplicity 
      for patients (and therefore a high compliance rate), ease of understanding for
      physicians, and sensitivity to the effects of treatment. In addition, it may help
      determine, early in the course of treatment, patients who may ultimately require 
      surgical therapy, thereby avoiding prolonged, but futile, medical therapy.

TI  - Effects of dextran sulphate sodium on intestinal epithelial cells and intestinal 
      lymphocytes.
PG  - 234-41
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The effects of dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) on mouse
      intestinal epithelial cells and intraepithelial lymphocytes were analysed to
      investigate the mechanism by which DSS induces colitis and tumours in mice.
      Cytotoxicity of DSS towards intestinal epithelial cells and intestinal
      intraepithelial lymphocyte hybridomas or fresh intestinal intraepithelial
      lymphocytes seems to have concentration, time, and cell type dependency with
      increasing concentrations and time causing increased cytotoxicity. RESULTS:
      Integrin alpha 4 expression was marginally down regulated by 0.5% of DSS, while
      alpha M290 expression was up regulated. DSS inhibits the binding of 9.1 gamma
      delta cells to both extracellular matrix (ECM) and epithelial cells. Conversely
      at high concentrations it increases binding to all ECM except poly-L-lysine.
      Various cytokines including TGF beta, interleukin 2, and tumour necrosis factor
      alpha as well as prostaglandin alter the expression of the integrin alpha 4 and
      M290 subunits at the cell surface, and also alter the adhesion of 9.1 gamma delta
      cells to epithelial monolayers. The expression of a large number of cell adhesion
      molecules expressed on intraepithelial lymphocytes is affected by a combination
      of the abundant gut cytokine TGF beta and DSS, suggesting that DSS induced
      colitis may ultimately arise from a combination of gut cytokine and DSS. DSS also
      triggers intraepithelial lymphocyte aggregation on all ECM coated plate tested.
      CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the potential roles of DSS induced colitis
      may be: (a) direct cytotoxicity; (b) interference with the normal interaction
      between intestinal lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and ECMs; (c) aberrant
      modulation of the expression of the integrin beta 7 receptors, other cell
      receptors, and their functions.

TI  - Evaluation of therapeutic regimens for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori
      infection.
PG  - 270-7
AB  - Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is currently considered the most important
      exogenous factor in the genesis of gastritis and peptic ulcer disease. However,
      the optimum regimen for the eradication of H. pylori remains unclear. The purpose
      of this study was to evaluate the eradication rate of H. pylori, the side
      effects, and the patients' compliance with regard to various drug regimens. We
      also analyzed factors influencing the eradication of H. pylori. One hundred and
      eighty patients were included and divided into four groups: 42 patients (Group I)
      received tripotassium dicitrato bismuthate (240 mg b.i.d.), metronidazole (250 mg
      t.i.d.) and amoxicillin (500 mg t.i.d.) for 14 days; 55 patients (Group 2)
      received omeprazole (20 mg b.i.d.) and amoxicillin (1000 mg b.i.d.) for 14 days; 
      36 patients (Group 3) were treated with omeprazole (20 mg b.i.d.), metronidazole 
      (250 mg t.i.d.) and amoxicillin (500 mg t.i.d.) for 14 days; and 47 patients
      (Group 4) received omeprazole (20 mg q.d.) and amoxicillin (500 mg t.i.d.) for 14
      days and then tripotassium dicitrato bismuthate (240 mg b.i.d.) and nizatidine
      (150 mg q.d.) for 14 days. The diagnosis of H. pylori was made by histology. The 
      eradication of H. pylori was defined both by histology (H&E and Giemsa stain) and
      by rapid urease test (CLOR) showing negative for H. pylori 4 weeks after the
      completion of therapy. Of the 180 patients, 95 patients had non-ulcer dyspepsia, 
      40 patients had gastric ulcer and 45 patients had duodenal ulcer. The eradication
      rate of H. pylori was highest (89.3%) in Group 3, as compared with Group 1
      (68.9%), Group 2 (65.4%), and Group 4 (48.9%). The eradication rate was
      significantly higher in Group 3 than in Groups 2 and 4 (p < 0.05). There was no
      significant difference in the eradication rate among clinical diagnosis, sex and 
      age. But, in the conventional triple therapy (Group 1), the eradication rate was 
      higher in male (78.6%) than in female (46.2%). The side effects in order, were
      nausea (22.1%), dizziness (19.5%), abdominal pain (11.6%) and diarrhea (97%), and
      there was no difference among the drug regimens. The compliance of the patients
      was good (more than 80% irrespective of drug regimen). On the basis of these
      findings, the side effects of the drugs seemed minimal, and the compliance of
      patients was good irrespective of the drug regimen. In conclusion, the triple
      therapy with omeprazole, metronidazole and amoxicillin was the most effective
      regimen and could be recommended for H. pylori eradication.

AB  - Following failure of conventional therapy for reflux oesophagitis, 15 children
      were treated with omeprazole 20 mg daily for a period of up to three months
      initially. Treatment resulted in a marked symptomatic improvement as measured by 
      incidence of pain, vomiting, dysphagia and haematemesis. Four children failed
      treatment and required fundoplication. No complications from the use of

TI  - Prevention of peptic ulcer and dyspeptic symptoms with omeprazole in patients
      receiving continuous non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy. A Nordic
      multicentre study.
PG  - 753-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are known to cause
      gastroduodenal lesions and dyspeptic symptoms. METHODS: Patients with a history
      of dyspepsia or uncomplicated peptic ulcer disease and with a need for continuous
      NSAID treatment were randomized to receive either 20 mg omeprazole once daily or 
      placebo. Gastroduodenal ulcers, erosions, and dyspeptic symptoms were evaluated
      after 1 and 3 months. RESULTS: During a 3-month study period 4.7% (4 of 85) of
      omeprazole-treated patients developed peptic ulcer, compared with 16.7% (15 of
      90) of patients treated with placebo. This prophylactic effect of omeprazole was 
      sustained independently of previous peptic ulcer history or Helicobacter pylori
      status. Development of dyspeptic symptoms requiring active treatment, either
      alone or in combination with ulcer(s) or erosions, occurred in 15.3% (15 of 85)
      of patients treated with omeprazole and 35.6% of those who received placebo.
      CONCLUSIONS: Omeprazole, 20 mg once daily, provides effective prophylactic
      therapy in patients at risk of developing NSAID-associated peptic ulcers or
      dyspeptic symptoms.

TI  - Long-term follow-up after cure of Helicobacter pylori infection with 4 days of
      quadruple therapy.
PG  - 645-50
AB  - BACKGROUND: We have shown that 4 days of quadruple therapy after omeprazole
      pre-treatment is an effective therapy for curing H. pylori infection. In this
      study we investigated whether this regimen would maintain the high cure rate
      during long-term follow-up. Some recent studies have reported high recurrence
      rates after apparent cure. Apparently not all methods to test for cure have
      sufficient sensitivity to pick up small numbers of residual bacteria. This study 
      also served to investigate whether our methods to test for cure 5-6 weeks
      post-treatment were reliable. METHODS: All patients from a previous study were
      invited to return for a 14C-urea breath test and serology. A representative group
      of 37 patients (76%) returned for a urea breath test and serology. The mean
      follow-up was 14.7 months (range 11.4-23.6 months). RESULTS: None of the 37
      patients had a positive urea breath test results. IgG antibody titres fell
      steadily in all patients, showing a mean decrease of 83% at the end of the
      follow-up. None of the patients showed an increase in titre. Reinfection was
      therefore 0% (0 of 37). CONCLUSION: Four days of quadruple therapy seems to be an
      effective therapy for the eradication of H. pylori as evidenced after long-term
      follow-up. Our biopsy methodology is reliable in identifying treatment failures
      5-6 weeks post-treatment.

      Helicobacter pylori eradication treatment with omeprazole and amoxycillin with or
      without metronidazole.
PG  - 637-44
AB  - AIM: To determine the effect of Helicobacter pylori eradication with omeprazole
      and amoxycillin, with or without metronidazole, on the 12-month course of
      duodenal ulcer disease. METHODS: In a randomized; double-blind study, conducted
      in 19 hospitals, 105 H. pylori positive duodenal ulcer patients were healed and
      symptom-free following either omeprazole dual therapy (omeprazole 40 mg
      o.m.+amoxycillin 500 mg t.d.s., OA, eradication rate 46%, n = 52) or omeprazole
      triple therapy (omeprazole 40 mg o.m.+amoxycillin 500 mg t.d.s.+metronidazole 400
      mg t.d.s., OAM, eradication rate 92%, n = 53) for 2 weeks, followed by 2 weeks of
      omeprazole 20 mg o.m. and a 12-month untreated follow-up period, after which time
      all patients were endoscoped. Endoscopic and symptomatic relapse rates, and
      effect on H. pylori status measured using 13C-urea breath test, were determined. 
      RESULTS: During the 12-month untreated follow-up period, the life-table
      endoscopic relapse rates were 12% (95% CI: 2-22%) and 2% (95% CI: 0-6%) for OA
      and OAM patients, respectively. By 12 months, life-table symptomatic relapse
      rates were 22% (95% CI: 13-37%) and 19% (95% CI: 8-30%) for OA and OAM,
      respectively. In the 12 months untreated follow-up period, 2/69 (3%, 95% CI:
      0-7%) patients rendered H. pylori negative had an endoscopic relapse at the end
      of the 12-month follow-up period, compared with 5/31 (16%, 95% CI: 3-29%)
      patients remaining H. pylori positive (P = 0.03 between H. pylori positive and
      negative groups). Twelve of 69 (17%, 95% CI: 8-26%) patients rendered H. pylori
      negative relapsed symptomatically, compared with 9/31 (29%, 95% CI: 13-45%)
      patients remaining H. pylori positive (P = N.S. between groups). There was a
      significant improvement in epigastric pain (P = 0.0001), nausea and vomiting (P <
      0.05) between entry to the study and 1, 6 and 12 months post-treatment for both
      treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: OAM eradicates H. pylori in significantly more
      patients than OA, but successful H. pylori eradication with either OAM or OA
      predisposes to low endoscopic and symptomatic relapse rates for duodenal ulcer
      patients when followed up for 12 months.

TI  - One-week triple therapy with omeprazole, amoxycillin and clarithromycin for
      treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection.
PG  - 617-21
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multi-drug regimens are generally required to reliably cure H. pylori
      infection. We previously demonstrated that a 2-week three-times-a-day regimen of 
      amoxycillin and clarithromycin was effective against H. pylori infection.
      OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and side-effects of a 1-week twice-daily
      dosing schedule for the treatment of H. pylori infection. METHODS: We studied the
      efficacy of 1-week of therapy with 20 mg of omeprazole, 1 g of amoxycillin and
      250 mg of clarithromycin, all twice daily H. pylori status was determined at
      entry and 4 or more weeks after completing antimicrobial therapy using histology 
      (Genta stain) and culture. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients with documented peptic
      ulcer disease and H. pylori infection were treated. The H. pylori infection was
      cured in 24 (77%, 95% CI = 58-90%) (intention-to-treat). In a per protocol
      analysis the cure rate was 23 of 29 patients (79%, 95% CI = 60-92%). One patient 
      took only 43% of the study drugs and another withdrew following development of an
      anaphylactic reaction to study medication. Mild side-effects were reported by 16%
      including diarrhoea, headache and altered taste. Compliance averaged 95%.
      Pretreatment clarithromycin resistance averaged 5% and had not been acquired by
      any strains post-therapy. CONCLUSION: This combination of omeprazole, amoxycillin
      and low-dose clarithromycin resulted in a relatively low cure rate even in
      patients with clarithromycin-sensitive isolates. Large comparative studies will
      be needed to define the optimal duration, dose and dosing interval if this
      combination of drugs is to become competitive.

TI  - Altered bowel function and duodenal bacterial overgrowth in patients treated with
      omeprazole.
PG  - 557-61
AB  - BACKGROUND: The dramatic inhibitory effect of proton pump inhibitors on acid
      secretion has raised concern about possible side-effects, such as small bowel
      bacterial overgrowth, which may result in further gut dysfunction. The aim of
      this study was to assess the effect of proton pump inhibitors on duodenal
      bacteriology, carbohydrate absorption and bowel habit. METHODS: Small bowel
      bacterial overgrowth and xylose absorption were measured by culture of aspirated 
      duodenal fluid and a combined 1 g 14C-D-xylose absorption-metabolism test in 20
      patients with peptic ulcer disease. Tests were repeated after 4 weeks of
      treatment with omeprazole 20 mg daily. Intestinal transit was assessed by
      recording interdefecatory intervals and stool form. RESULTS: All patients showed 
      an increase in duodenal bacterial counts following treatment, geometric mean
      counts increasing from 330 to 95000 CFU/mL. The geometric mean of the difference 
      was 290 CFU/mL (95% CI, 110-720 CFU/mL; P < 0.0001). No changes were noted in the
      xylose absorption or metabolism tests. Mean interdefecatory intervals decreased
      by 32% from 31.7 to 21.6 h, the mean difference being 10.1 h (95% CI, 1.6-18.5 h:
      P = 0.01). The mean stool form index increased from 2.95 to 4.70, mean difference
      1.75 (95% CI, 1.10-2.40: P < 0.0001), with four patients reporting diarrhoea.
      CONCLUSION: The results indicate that conventional treatment for duodenal ulcers 
      with a proton pump inhibitor significantly increases bacterial colonization of
      the duodenum and the speed of intestinal transit.

TI  - Reflux symptom relief with omeprazole in patients without unequivocal
      oesophagitis.
PG  - 547-55
AB  - BACKGROUND: As many as 50% of patients with reflux symptoms have no endoscopic
      evidence of oesophagitis. This multicentre study was designed to assess symptom
      relief after omeprazole 20 mg once daily in patients with symptoms typical of
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease but without endoscopic evidence of
      oesophagitis. METHODS: Patients (n = 209) were randomized in a double-blind study
      to receive either omeprazole 20 mg once daily (n = 98) or placebo (n = 111) for 4
      weeks. Symptoms were assessed at clinic visits and using daily diary cards, with 
      patient-completed questionnaires providing additional data on symptoms and on
      psychological disturbance. RESULTS: On completion, symptom relief favoured
      omeprazole: 57% of patients on omeprazole were free of heartburn (vs. 19% on
      placebo), 75% were free of regurgitation (47%) and 43% were completely
      asymptomatic (14%), each with P < 0.0001. Fewer patients in the omeprazole group 
      required alginate/antacid relief medication (P < 0.05). Symptom relief (time to
      first heartburn-free day) was more rapid with omeprazole (2 vs. 5 days on
      placebo; P < 0.01). A greater reduction in anxiety occurred in the omeprazole
      group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Omeprazole 20 mg once daily is effective in
      providing relief of the symptoms typical of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in 
      patients with essentially normal oesophageal mucosa.

TI  - Effect of short- and long-term treatment with omeprazole on the absorption and
      serum levels of cobalamin.
PG  - 541-5
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate absorption of protein-bound and unbound cyanocobalamin before
      and during treatment with omeprazole, and cobalamin levels in patients on
      long-term treatment with omeprazole. METHODS: In eight former duodenal ulcer
      patients absorption of unbound and protein-bound cobalamin was determined by
      measuring 24-h urinary excretion of unbound 58Co-cyancobalamin or protein-bound
      57Co-cyanocobalamin during a modified Schilling test. Tests were performed before
      and during treatment with 20 mg and 40 mg omeprazole daily for 9 days. Serum
      cobalamin levels were assessed in 25 patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux
      disease (GERD) before and during long-term maintenance therapy with omeprazole.
      Mean treatment duration was 56 months (range 36-81 months). RESULTS: Urinary
      excretion of unbound cobalamin was unchanged with both dosages of omeprazole.
      Excretion of 57Co-cyanocobalamin, however, decreased significantly during
      treatment with both 20 mg omeprazole (mean +/- S.E.M.: 1.31 +/- 0.20 vs. 0.54 +/-
      0.17%; P < 0.02) and 40 mg omeprazole (1.25 +/- 0.26 vs. 0.29 +/- 0.06%; P <
      0.02). Mean serum cobalamin levels (+/- S.E.M.) before and during therapy with
      omeprazole in GERD patients were 298 +/- 27 and 261 +/- 16 pg/mL (normal range
      180-900 pg/mL), respectively (P = N.S.). CONCLUSIONS: Absorption of
      protein-bound, but not unbound, cyanocobalamin is decreased when measured by a
      modified Schilling test during treatment with omeprazole. However, no change in
      serum cobalamin levels was observed in patients with GERD after treatment with
      omeprazole for up to 7 years.

TI  - Lansoprazole versus ranitidine in the maintenance treatment of reflux
      oesophagitis.
PG  - 529-39
AB  - AIMS: To assess the relative efficacies of lansoprazole 15 mg once daily,
      lansoprazole 30 mg once daily and ranitidine 300 mg b.d. in the maintenance
      treatment of reflux oesophagitis for 12 months. METHODS: Multicentre,
      out-patient, double-blind, parallel group, prospectively randomized clinical
      trial. Patients with grade 0, asymptomatic oesophagitis after 8 weeks of
      treatment with lansoprazole 30 mg once daily were randomized to receive
      lansoprazole 30 mg once daily (L30) (n = 75), lansoprazole 15 mg once daily (L15)
      (n = 86) or ranitidine 300 mg b.d. (R600) (n = 74) for 12 months. Endoscopy was
      repeated at 6 and 12 months, and symptomatic assessment was made every 3 months. 
      Efficacy was primarily assessed by the time to endoscopically confirmed relapse
      (oesophagitis grade > or = 1) and the proportion of patients who relapsed during 
      the 12-month study period. Severity of symptoms were secondary efficacy measures.
      RESULTS: For all patients randomized with at least one post-baseline endoscopy
      (intent-to-treat principle) both lansoprazole 15 mg (P < 0.001) and lansoprazole 
      30 mg (P < 0.001) were significantly superior to ranitidine 600 mg with respect
      to time to endoscopic relapse. There was no difference between the lansoprazole
      groups (P = 0.11). There was evidence of relapse in 27 of 86 (31.4%), 15 of 75
      (20.0%) and 50 of 74 (67.6%) of the patients treated with lansoprazole 15 mg and 
      30 mg and ranitidine 600 mg, respectively. Patients receiving treatment with
      either lansoprazole dosages experienced significantly less severe heartburn and
      regurgitation than those patients treated with ranitidine. There were no
      differences between the treatment groups with respect to the severity or
      incidence of adverse events. No clinically significant laboratory changes were
      observed in any of the treatment groups. Serum gastrin levels were elevated in
      all treatment groups, and most markedly in those patients receiving lansoprazole,
      but there was no significant difference between the treatments. Morphological and
      immunohistochemical examination of the gastric biopsies revealed no clinically
      relevant changes from baseline in any of the treatment groups. CONCLUSION: Both
      lansoprazole 15 mg and lansoprazole 30 mg once daily are significantly more
      effective than high-dose ranitidine in maintaining reflux oesophagitis in
      remission.

TI  - Long-term treatment with lansoprazole for patients with Zollinger-Ellison
      syndrome.
PG  - 507-22
AB  - BACKGROUND: Normalization of gastric secretion and cure of associated upper
      gastrointestinal lesions by resection of gastrinoma is possible in approximately 
      20% of patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, leaving approximately 80%
      dependent on medical treatment with proton pump inhibitors for acid suppression. 
      METHODS: Lansoprazole was given for 3-48 months (median 28 months) to 26
      Zollinger-Ellison syndrome patients with peptic ulcer manifestations in all and
      oesophagitis in 13. Starting with 60 mg/day. the dose was individualized to lower
      basal acid output to less than 5 mmol/h for those with intact stomachs and less
      than 1 mmol/h in those who had prior gastrectomy or with oesophagitis. The
      patients were studied every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months with
      gastric analysis (basal and maximal acid and pepsin output) and endoscopy with
      biopsy for enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells. RESULTS: Lansoprazole inhibited
      basal acid output by 95%, pepsin output by 65% and remained effective at the
      initial mean (66 +/- 4.3 mg/day) or smaller doses (56 +/- 12 mg/day) at 48
      months. Mucosal lesions healed and symptoms (ulcer-type pain, diarrhoea,
      heartburn, weight loss) resolved rapidly, usually within a few weeks. Serum
      gastrin and ECL cell populations, which were elevated before treatment, remained 
      statistically unchanged but one of the three multiple endocrine neoplasia I
      (MEN-I) patients developed a small carcinoid. Of the three patients with
      metastatic gastrinoma at diagnosis one has died and one has progressed, while the
      third has had stable liver metastases for 26 years. Ulcer-type relapses occurred 
      in three of the five post-gastrectomy patients, one with fatal jejunal ulcer
      perforation despite adequate acid suppression. No biochemical or clinical adverse
      events due to lansoprazole were encountered. CONCLUSION: Lansoprazole effectively
      inhibits acid and pepsin secretion in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome patients without
      any demonstrated side-effects. Despite strict acid control, post-gastrectomy
      Zollinger-Ellison syndrome patients were more liable to ulcer relapse, while
      oesophagitis was not a marker for therapeutic difficulty.

      acid output of more than 15 mmol/h.
PG  - 497-506
AB  - BACKGROUND: About 10% of patients with duodenal ulcers have marked gastric acid
      hypersecretion with basal acid output (BAO) of more than 15 mmol/h, which is in
      the range found in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. PATIENTS AND STUDY DESIGN: We
      report long-term, up to 4 years, prospective treatment using lansoprazole in nine
      male patients with duodenal ulcers and a BAO of more than 15 mmol/h whose results
      are compared with those in 10 male Zollinger-Ellison syndrome patients with
      intact stomachs reported in detail in an accompanying paper. RESULTS: All 19
      subjects, except one Zollinger-Ellison syndrome patient who had gastric and
      oesophageal ulcers, had a history of duodenal ulcers; 22% of those with gastric
      acid hypersecretion had oesophagitis compared with 60% of those with
      Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Each subject had the dose of lansoprazole adjusted to
      give a BAO of less than 5 mmol/h. At 3-month intervals to 1 year, and then at
      6-monthly intervals, basal and pentagastrin stimulated secretions were studied,
      in addition to gastroscopy with biopsy for gastric mucosal morphology. Basal and 
      maximal acid and pepsin secretions were not different between gastric acid
      hypersecretion and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome patients before treatment. During
      treatment, BAO was reduced by over 90% to less than 2 mmol/h, while peak acid
      output was reduced by 70% in those with gastric acid hypersecretion and 90% in
      Zollinger-Ellison syndrome patients. Four gastric acid hypersecretion patients
      had relapses during treatment, three times in one patient and twice in another
      patient, but all responded to continued treatment with lansoprazole. Of the seven
      ulcer-related relapses in the gastric acid hypersecretion patients, four occurred
      with a BAO of less than 2 mmol/h and three with a BAO of 7.1-7.3 mmol/h; five of 
      the seven relapses occurred in the absence of Helicobacter pylori. Lansoprazole
      remained effective at an average dose of approximately 70 mg/day, without causing
      any side-effects. CONCLUSION: Lansoprazole is apparently safe and effective for
      treating hypersecretion, whether due to hypergastrinaemia (Zollinger-Ellison
      syndrome) or not (non-Zollinger-Ellison syndrome hypersecretors).

TI  - Antimicrobial therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection versus long-term
      maintenance antisecretion treatment in the prevention of recurrent hemorrhage
      from peptic ulcer: prospective nonrandomized trial on 125 patients.
PG  - 1549-52
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to assess the effectiveness of therapy for
      Helicobacter pylori (HP) on the prevention of recurrent bleeding in patients with
      recent upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage from peptic ulcers. METHODS: We
      performed a prospective follow-up study without randomization on 125 consecutive 
      patients (83 males and 42 females) who had presented with their first major
      episode of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage from peptic ulcer (22 gastric and
      103 duodenal ulcers). All 125 patients were HP-positive. During the acute phase
      of bleeding, all patients were treated with standard supportive measures. After
      the acute bleeding phase, patients were allocated to two treatment groups: 1)
      antimicrobial therapy-84 patients received one of the following three regimens:
      1) amoxicillin 500 mg t.i.d. for 10 days + omeprazole 20 mg b.i.d. for 30 days;
      2) clarythromycin 500 mg t.i.d. for 12 days + omeprazole 20 mg b.i.d. for 30
      days; or 3) amoxicillin 500 mg t.i.d. for 10 days + metronidazole 500 mg t.i.d.
      for 10 days + colloidal bismuth subcitrate 240 mg b.i.d. for 30 days. For
      long-term antisecretion maintenance treatment, 41 patients were allocated to
      either omeprazole 20 mg once a day or ranitidine 150 mg once a day, for 1 yr.
      RESULTS: During the follow-up period, peptic ulcers recurred in six patients in
      the antibiotic group (7.14%) and 13 patients in the maintenance group (31.7%) (p 
      < 0.001). The fraction of patients without recurrent bleeding was greater in the 
      antibiotic group than in the maintenance group. Two patients in the antibiotic
      group (2.3%) and five in the maintenance group (12.1%) had recurrent hemorrhages 
      (p < 0.1). CONCLUSION: Cure of HP infection reduces the recurrence of peptic
      ulcer and of rebleeding from ulcer disease more effectively than does long-term
      maintenance therapy.

TI  - Persistent acid secretion during omeprazole therapy: a study of gastric acid
      profiles in patients demonstrating failure of omeprazole therapy.
PG  - 1527-31
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) who, 
      despite omeprazole 20 mg b.i.d., demonstrate continued abnormal gastric acid
      secretion. METHODS: Eighty-eight patients with GERD completed ambulatory gastric 
      and esophageal pH monitoring for persistent symptoms on omeprazole 20 mg b.i.d.. 
      Seventeen (19%) demonstrated abnormal gastric acid secretion (percentage time
      gastric pH < 4 > 50%). The 17 omeprazole failures (OF) were compared with: 1) 19 
      randomly selected patients with GERD (also studied on omeprazole 20 mg b.i.d. and
      2) 19 normal volunteers studied on both placebo and omeprazole 20 mg b.i.d..
      Total time intragastric pH < 4, 24-hr gastric pH frequency distribution, and
      15-min median pH values for the 6-h period after the evening omeprazole dose were
      compared. RESULTS: Both the 24-hr frequency distribution for gastric pH and the
      15-min median gastric pH profile for patients with GERD and volunteers on
      omeprazole 20 mg b.i.d. were almost identical. By contrast, gastric pH studies
      from the OF group receiving omeprazole 20 mg b.i.d. most closely resembled those 
      of the normal subjects receiving placebo, with respect to these variables.
      Gastric pH monitoring in seven of the 17 OF patients while on omeprazole 80
      mg/day demonstrated a significant decrease in the median percentage time gastric 
      pH remained below 4 (32.8% on 80 mg/day vs 74.3% on 40 mg/day; p < 0.02).
      CONCLUSION: There are individuals whose intragastric acidity persists despite
      conventional doses of omeprazole. Although the underlying mechanism remains
      unclear, the majority (six of seven) (87%) demonstrated improved gastric acid
      control when placed on high dose omeprazole, indicating that this is often a
      dose-dependent phenomenon.

TI  - Efficacy of ciprofloxacin in the eradication of Helicobacter pylori.
PG  - 775-8
AB  - In small preliminary trials, ciprofloxacin has failed to eradicate Helicobacter
      pylori. Since fluoroquinolones have a marked reduction in bactericidal activity
      at acidic pH, we altered the gastric pH using omeprazole and investigated the
      efficacy of ciprofloxacin in eradicating H pylori. Forty-four consecutive
      patients infected with H pylori were prospectively studied in a randomized,
      double-blind, controlled trial comparing ciprofloxacin with a placebo for 2
      weeks. Both treatment groups received bismuth and omeprazole. In 36 patients,
      follow-up endoscopy was done 4 weeks after the cessation of all study drugs. The 
      H pylori infection cleared in 13 of 17 patients (76%) in the ciprofloxacin group 
      versus 5 of 19 (26%) in the placebo group. Concurrent administration of
      omeprazole with ciprofloxacin resulted in increased bactericidal activity against
      H pylori. Ciprofloxacin when combined with omeprazole and bismuth is efficacious 
      for eradication of H pylori.

TI  - Effect of omeprazole on the distribution of metronidazole, amoxicillin, and
      clarithromycin in human gastric juice.
PG  - 358-67
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The mechanism by which antimicrobial therapy against
      Helicobacter pylori is enhanced by acid suppression is unknown. The aim of this
      study was to investigate the effect of omeprazole on gastric juice, plasma, and
      saliva concentrations of metronidazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin. METHODS:
      Single doses of antibiotic were administered intravenously to 24 healthy men
      (each antibiotic to 8 subjects) while taking placebo or omeprazole. Antibiotic
      concentrations were measured in gastric juice, plasma, and saliva. The
      pharmacokinetic parameters gastric clearance and gastric transfer fraction were
      calculated for each antibiotic. RESULTS: In the omeprazole group compared with
      the placebo group, mean maximum antibiotic gastric juice concentrations (in
      milligram per liter) of metronidazole decreased from 33.6 to 8.3 (P = 0.0001),
      whereas those of clarithromycin were unchanged, and those of amoxicillin
      increased from 0.13 to 0.68 (P = 0.02). Omeprazole increased salivary
      concentrations of metronidazole (P = 0.02) but had no effect on clarithromycin
      concentrations (no amoxicillin was detectable in saliva). CONCLUSIONS: Omeprazole
      decreases the intragastric concentrations of metronidazole by reducing acid
      secretion and increases intragastric concentrations of amoxicillin partly by
      reducing gastric juice volume. Novel pharmacokinetic parameters have been
      described that provide an insight into the mechanisms underlying drug transfer
      across the blood-stomach barrier.

PG  - 859-62
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Our study is to compare a short-term low-dose triple therapy
      with a long-term medium-dose double therapy for H.pylori eradication. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: One hundred and ten consecutive patients, suffering from dyspeptic
      symptoms, with H.pylori infection, were randomly allocated to one of the
      following 2 groups with different therapeutic regimens: A) omeprazole 20 mg/day
      for 7 days, tinidazole 500 mg bid for 7 days, clarithromycin 250 mg bid for 7
      days (55 pts, 20 with peptic ulcer); B) omeprazole 20 mg bid for 14 days,
      amoxycillin 1000 mg bid for 14 days (55 pts, 28 with peptic ulcer). The "H.pylori
      status" was evaluated by means of histology, culture and urease test, at entry
      and 8 weeks after treatment. RESULTS: Two group A and one group B pts didn't
      complete the treatment. The H.pylori eradication was obtained in 38 pts of group 
      A (71.69%) (C.I.95%: 55.19176-80.86293), in 31 of group B (58.49%) (C.I.95%:
      42.32777-69.7017); on Intention-to-Treat analysis, the rate of eradication gave
      similar results. Side effects occurred in 9 pts of group A (16.98%), in 8 of
      group B (14.81%). CONCLUSIONS: Short-term low-dose triple therapy with
      omeprazole/tinidazole/clarithromycin has a better cost/benefit ratio than
      long-term dual therapy with omeprazole/amoxycillin in the H.pylori eradication,
      but it causes more side-effects.

TI  - Bacterial overgrowth during treatment with omeprazole compared with cimetidine: a
      prospective randomised double blind study.
PG  - 54-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gastric and duodenal bacterial overgrowth frequently occurs in
      conditions where diminished acid secretion is present. Omeprazole inhibits acid
      secretion more effectively than cimetidine and might therefore more frequently
      cause bacterial overgrowth. AIM: This controlled prospective study compared the
      incidence of gastric and duodenal bacterial overgrowth in patients treated with
      omeprazole or cimetidine. METHODS: 47 outpatients with peptic disease were
      randomly assigned to a four week treatment regimen with omeprazole 20 mg or
      cimetidine 800 mg daily. Gastric and duodenal juice were obtained during upper
      gastrointestinal endoscopy and plated for anaerobic and aerobic organisms.
      RESULTS: Bacterial overgrowth (> or = 10(5) cfu/ml) was present in 53% of the
      patients receiving omeprazole and in 17% receiving cimetidine (p < 0.05). The
      mean (SEM) number of gastric and duodenal bacterial counts was 6.0 (0.2) and 5.0 
      (0.2) respectively in the omeprazole group and 4.0 (0.2) and 4.0 (0.1) in the
      cimetidine group (p < 0.001 and < 0.01; respectively). Faecal type bacteria were 
      found in 30% of the patients with bacterial overgrowth. Basal gastric pH was
      higher in patients treated with omeprazole compared with cimetidine (4.2 (0.5)
      versus 2.0 (0.2); p < 0.001) and in patients with bacterial overgrowth compared
      with those without bacterial overgrowth (5.1 (0.6) versus 2.0 (0.1); p < 0.0001).
      The nitrate, nitrite, and nitrosamine values in gastric juice did not increase
      after treatment with either cimetidine or omeprazole. Serum concentrations of
      vitamin B12, beta carotene, and albumin were similar before and after treatment
      with both drugs. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that the incidence of gastric
      and duodenal bacterial overgrowth is considerably higher in patients treated with
      omeprazole compared with cimetidine. This can be explained by more pronounced
      inhibition of gastric acid secretion. No patient developed signs of malabsorption
      or an increase of N-nitroso compounds. The clinical significance of these
      findings needs to be assessed in studies with long-term treatment with
      omeprazole, in particular in patients belonging to high risk groups such as HIV
      infected and intensive care units patients.

TI  - Role of Helicobacter pylori in ulcer healing and recurrence of gastric and
      duodenal ulcers in longterm NSAID users. Response to omeprazole dual therapy.
PG  - 22-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relation between Helicobacter pylori infection and non-steroidal 
      anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-associated peptic ulcers remains unclear; in
      particular, it is not known whether H pylori plays a part in the healing and
      recurrence of these ulcers. AIMS: To evaluate prospectively in a consecutive
      series of arthritis patients receiving longterm NSAID treatment the prevalence of
      peptic ulcer as well as the effect of H pylori eradication on the healing and
      recurrence of gastric and duodenal ulcer found. PATIENTS: Some 278 consecutive
      patients underwent gastroscopy with multiple biopsies of the gastric antrum and
      corpus for histological examination and rapid urease test. One hundred peptic
      ulcers (59 gastric ulcers, 39 duodenal ulcers, and two gastric ulcers concomitant
      with a duodenal ulcer) were found. Seventy per cent of these ulcers were H pylori
      positive. METHODS: According to their H pylori status, ulcer patients were
      randomised to one of the following treatments: H pylori negative ulcers received 
      omeprazole 20 mg twice daily for four to eight weeks, whereas H pylori positive
      lesions were treated with omeprazole 20 mg twice daily plus amoxycillin 1 g twice
      daily (the second of these for the first two weeks) or omeprazole alone for four 
      to eight weeks while continuing NSAID therapy. Patients with healed ulcers were
      endoscopically followed up for six months after stopping antiulcer therapy while 
      continuing NSAIDs. RESULTS: Endoscopic healing rates for gastric and duodenal
      ulcers in the three different groups were similar both at four and eight weeks. H
      pylori eradication did not influence healing, which occurred in 14 of 20 (70%) of
      patients in whom H pylori was eradicated, compared with 14 of 17 (82%) of
      patients with persistent infection. Cumulative recurrence rates at six months did
      not statistically differ among the three different groups (27% in H pylori
      negative, 46% in H pylori positive, and 31% in those where H pylori was
      eradicated during the healing phase), although a numerical trend in favour of a
      higher recurrence rate in infected patients was evident. CONCLUSIONS: H pylori
      eradication does not confer any significant advantage on the healing of gastric
      and duodenal ulcers associated with longterm NSAID use. It remains to be
      established with certainty whether eradication may be helpful in the reduction of
      recurrence in a specific subset of NSAID associated ulcer.

TI  - How to treat Helicobacter pylori infection--should treatment strategies be based 
      on testing bacterial susceptibility? A personal viewpoint.
PG  - 709-16
AB  - Peptic ulcer disease is an infectious disease. Only antibiotic regimens that
      achieve a 90% cure should be used to treat this infection. Antimicrobial
      susceptibility is the main determinant in the success of therapy; cure rates are 
      usually lower in resistant strains. As in any other infectious disease it is
      essential in treatment studies to stratify results according to pretreatment
      bacterial susceptibility. Cure-rates have to be reported separately for sensitive
      and resistant strains. It must be realized that a study achieving a high cure
      rate with a certain regimen can either have included few patients with resistant 
      strains or, alternatively, the regimen tested can have a high efficacy in
      resistant strains. This issue is fundamental and only if that information is
      available, do we know whether or not we can reproduce the results reported in
      that particular study in a different population. We have reviewed all
      Helicobacter studies that tested pretreatment bacterial susceptibility. The
      results achieved with dual therapy, bismuth triple therapy, proton pump inhibitor
      triple therapy and quadruple therapy in sensitive and resistant strains are
      discussed. Based on these data, treatment recommendations are made for empirical 
      treatment in areas with low resistance rates and those with high resistance
      rates. If treatment is individualized and based on the antibiogram then easier,
      shorter and cheaper regimens seem possible.

TI  - Candida overgrowth after treatment of duodenal ulcer. A comparison of cimetidine,
      famotidine, and omeprazole.
PG  - 7-10
AB  - Acid-reducing drugs can cause increased growth of microbes, including fungus,
      because of high gastric pH. Our purpose was to evaluate the occurrence of mycotic
      infection in patients with duodenal ulcer on anti-ulcer therapy and to compare
      the effects of cimetidine, famotidine, and omeprazole. Eighty patients with
      duodenal ulcer (62 males and 18 female patients, 16-65 years old) were evaluated 
      for mycotic infection before and after 6 weeks of therapy (cimetidine, 20
      patients; famotidine, 40 patients; omeprazole, 20 patients). Mycotic infection
      was diagnosed by endoscopic biopsy from the ulcer edge subjected to smear,
      culture, and histopathology and by endoscopic brush samples and gastric aspirate.
      On the basis of these studies, patients were categorized as having no fungal
      growth, saprophytic growth, or significant fungal growth. Thirty-five (43.8%)
      patients had evidence of fungus before ulcer therapy, and 16 of the 35 (20%) had 
      significant fungal growth. The fungal isolation rate was higher in older patients
      (> and = 45 years of age) and in those with an ulcer size > and = 2 cm. While
      there was no significant increase in the total number of patients with evidence
      of fungus after therapy (n = 36), there was a significant increase in those with 
      significant growth (n = 27, p < 0.05) compared with pretreatment status. We found
      that posttreatment gastric pH of > and = 4 was associated with a higher fungal
      positivity rate (59.4%) than pH values < 4 (32.4%, p < 0.05). However, neither
      the type of drug used nor the response in terms of ulcer healing correlated with 
      the presence of fungus. Regardless of the type of drug used, acid-reducing
      therapy is associated with increased significant fungal growth.

TI  - Corticosteroids and ulcers: is there an association?
PG  - 870-2
AB  - The literature presented supports a small but highly probable association between
      corticosteroids and ulcers. The following characteristics appear to be exhibited 
      by patients who are at high risk for developing corticosteroid-induced ulcers:
      corticosteroids coadministered with NSAIDs, a total dosage greater than 1000 mg
      of prednisone equivalent, a duration of therapy longer than 30 days, and a
      history of PUD. Further prospective research examining the association of
      corticosteroids and PUD in conjunction with other contributing factors is needed.
      The role of prophylactic therapy to prevent corticosteroid-induced ulcers is not 
      well established. Even though a small study in liver transplant recipients, who
      are already at increased risk for GI ulceration, has suggested beneficial effects
      with prophylactic regimens, generalization of these results to all
      corticosteroid-treated patients would be inappropriate. Large prospective trials 
      to determine the most efficacious prophylactic regimen (e.g., histamine2-receptor
      antagonists, proton pump inhibitors, cytoprotective agents [misoprostol]) for
      corticosteroid-induced ulcerations are not currently available. We suggest that
      most prophylaxis currently performed is unnecessary. In high-risk patients,
      however, prophylaxis appears to be prudent until further information is
      available.

TI  - Low H. pylori reinfection rate after triple therapy in Chilean duodenal ulcer
      patients.
PG  - 1395-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We studied prospectively in a single-blind controlled manner the
      efficacy of 4-wk triple-antibiotic therapy, with amoxicillin (500 mg p.o.,
      t.i.d.), metronidazole (250 mg p.o., t.i.d.), and bismuth subsalicylate tablets
      (524 mg p.o., q.i.d.), plus omeprazole (20 mg p.o., q.d.) and compared it with
      omeprazole (id) in the treatment of duodenal ulcer (DU) patients colonized with
      Helicobacter pylori. METHODS: One hundred DU patients were entered prospectively 
      over a 12-month period. Fifty-seven of them received triple therapy plus
      omeprazole and 43 received omeprazole alone. Clinical, endoscopic, and
      bacteriological evaluations were performed on admission and at 28 days, 4, 8, and
      12 months after treatment. RESULTS: After 4-wk treatment (day 28), the ulcer
      healing rate was high, but there was no significant difference between rates in
      the triple therapy and omeprazole groups (99% vs. 91%). In contrast, the
      long-term DU recurrence rate after 12-month follow-up was significantly lower (p 
      > 0.01) for triple therapy (3/57, 5%), compared with omeprazole (34/43, 79%). The
      difference (higher relapse rate for omeprazole-treated patients) was significant 
      (p < 0.001) by the second evaluation, 4 months after treatment. The eradication
      rate of H. pylori was also significantly higher among DU patients treated with
      triple therapy (p < 0.001) during all prospective evaluations, grand mean, 82%
      (range 82-87%), compared with the omeprazole-treated group, in which there were
      no cases in which H. pylori was eradicated. Follow-up revealed that 2/47 H.
      pylori-eradicated patients became reinfected after 1 yr, giving a reinfection
      rate of 4.2 patient/yr. CONCLUSIONS: Four-week triple-antibiotic therapy plus
      omeprazole constitutes an adequate alternative for treatment of Chilean DU
      patients.

      administration of lansoprazole and omeprazole are reviewed. Lansoprazole and
      omeprazole are proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs). These agents bind covalently to
      hydrogen/potassium-exchanging adenosine triphosphatase in gastric parietal cells,
      rendering the molecule nonfunctional and inhibiting the secretion of gastric
      acid. The bioavailability of lansoprazole is 85%; that of omeprazole is 54%.
      Although lansoprazole and omeprazole have a plasma half-life of less than 2
      hours, the duration of action is more than 24 hours. Clinical trials have shown
      lansoprazole and omeprazole to be effective in the treatment of duodenal ulcers, 
      gastric ulcers, peptic ulcer disease involving Helicobacter pylori infection,
      recurrent ulcers, ulcers induced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, reflux 
      esophagitis, Barrett esophagus, and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. In many cases,
      these PPIs were more effective than histamine H2-receptor antagonists or worked
      when the latter failed. Lansoprazole and omeprazole have similar adverse-effect
      profiles and are well tolerated in both long- and short-term therapy. The dosage 
      and duration of therapy vary with the condition being treated or the individual
      patient. Dosage adjustments should be considered only in the case of lansoprazole
      in patients with severe liver disease. Lansoprazole and omeprazole are highly
      specific in blocking a critical step in gastric acid production and have been
      found to be safe and effective in the treatment of many acid peptic disorders.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of pantoprazole 40 mg versus 80 mg in patients with
      reflux oesophagitis.
PG  - 397-401
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pantoprazole is a substituted benzimidazole which is a potent
      inhibitor of gastric acid secretion by its action upon H+, K+-ATPase. METHODS:
      Pantoprazole 40 mg and 80 mg were compared in a randomized double-blind study in 
      192 out-patients with stage II or III (Savary-Miller classification) reflux
      oesophagitis. Patients received either pantoprazole 40 mg (n = 97) or
      pantoprazole 80 mg (n = 95), once daily before breakfast for 4 weeks. Treatment
      was extended for a further 4 weeks if the oesophagitis had not healed. RESULTS:
      After 4 weeks complete healing of the reflux oesophagitis was seen in 78% of
      protocol-correct patients given pantoprazole 40 mg daily (n = 86), and in 72% in 
      the 80 mg (n = 87) group. The cumulative healing rates after 8 weeks were 95 and 
      94%, respectively (P > 0.05, Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel), and time until healing of 
      oesophagitis comparable in both groups. Differences between doses were also not
      significant in an intention-to-treat analysis. Both dosing schedules were well
      tolerated and the patients experienced remarkable symptom relief. No adverse
      event or changes in laboratory values of clinical significance could definitely
      be ascribed to the trial medication. CONCLUSION: The 40 mg pantoprazole dosage is
      comparable to 80 mg in reflux oesophagitis, both in efficacy and tolerability.

TI  - A trial of lansoprazole in refractory gastric ulcer.
PG  - 381-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: The proton-pump inhibitor, lansoprazole, a more potent gastric acid
      inhibitor with a longer action than H2-receptor antagonists, should heal
      refractory gastric ulcers more effectively. METHODS: Lansoprazole's efficacy in
      healing refractory gastric ulcer(s) (i.e. after 6 weeks of treatment with
      H2-receptor antagonists, antacids or sucralfate at recommended dosages, and/or a 
      relapse within 1 year of documented gastric ulcer), was compared by a two-dose
      regimen in a four-centre, randomized, parallel group study. One hundred and
      eighteen patients (59 per group) with an endoscopically confirmed gastric ulcer >
      or = 3 mm, received lansoprazole 30 or 60 mg daily. We assessed efficacy
      endoscopically at 4 and 8 weeks, and again after documented healing during a
      maintenance phase of lansoprazole 30 mg/day at 2 and 4 months. RESULTS:
      Demographic and anthropometric data were comparable. Healing rates at 4 weeks
      were 63% (30 mg) vs. 66% (60 mg) (95% CI, -14 to 21%) and cumulatively at 8
      weeks, 83% (30 mg) vs. 81% (60 mg) (95% CI, -12 to 16%). Two and 4 months after
      documented healing, 86% and 78% of intention-to-treat patients remained in
      remission. CONCLUSION: Lansoprazole 30 or 60 mg/day appear equally effective in
      healing refractory gastric ulcers, while maintenance therapy of 30 mg/day
      effectively prevented an ulcer relapse.

TI  - The effects of omeprazole 20 and 40 mg twice daily on intragastric acidity in
      duodenal ulcer patients.
PG  - 367-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: The combination of omeprazole with amoxycillin or clarithromycin is
      used as treatment against Helicobacter pylori. It seems likely that the
      antibacterial activity of the antibiotic may be improved by increasing gastric pH
      towards neutrality, and a twice daily regimen of omeprazole is probably needed.
      AIM: To assess the effects of twice daily administration of omeprazole 20 and 40 
      mg. METHODS: Twelve duodenal ulcer patients in remission were randomized to
      receive in single-blind fashion either placebo, omeprazole 20 mg or omeprazole 40
      mg twice daily (08.00 and 20.00 h). On the sixth day of dosing they underwent
      24-h gastric pH-metry. RESULTS: Omeprazole 20 and 40 mg b.d. produced marked
      decreases (P < 0.001) of 24-h gastric acidity (pH 5.4 +/- 0.9 and pH 5.7 +/- 0.6,
      respectively, vs. a basal pH of 1.4 +/- 0.2) and kept gastric pH at levels higher
      than 3.0 for almost 24 h. Gastric pH was kept above 5.0 for about 18 h and above 
      6.0 for about 10 h, while the time spent above 7.0 did not exceed 3 h. There were
      no significant differences between the two omeprazole dosages at any pH
      threshold. CONCLUSION: Omeprazole 20 mg b.d. is sufficient to render the gastric 
      milieu as anacidic as possible in duodenal patients.

      and repeated oral administration of the proton pump inhibitor pantoprazole in
      comparison to omeprazole.
PG  - 359-66
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pantoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor characterized by a low
      potential to interact with the cytochrome P450 enzyme system in man. Its effect
      on intragastric pH following single and repeated oral intake was investigated in 
      comparison to omeprazole by continuous intragastric pH-metry at doses recommended
      for treatment of peptic ulcer disease. METHODS: Sixteen healthy male subjects
      underwent two dosing periods. From day 1 to day 7, they were given once daily by 
      mouth 40 mg pantoprazole in one period and 20 mg omeprazole in the other period, 
      according to a double-blind randomized crossover design. Twenty-four-hour
      intragastric pH was recorded and frequent blood samples for pharmacokinetic
      analysis were taken on day 1 and day 7. A placebo pH profile was obtained prior
      to each treatment period. RESULTS: Pantoprazole was significantly more effective 
      than omeprazole with regard to increase in 24-h and daytime pH, following both
      single (median 24-h pH: 1.45 vs. 1.3, P < 0.05; median daytime pH: 1.6 vs. 1.3, P
      < 0.01) and repeated (median 24-h pH: 3.15 vs. 2.05, P < 0.01; median daytime pH:
      3.8 vs. 2.65, P < 0.05) oral intake. As compared to the first dose, repeated
      administration of both drugs markedly increased the effect on intragastric pH.
      With pantoprazole, steady-state serum concentrations were obtained after the
      first dose, but not with omeprazole. Both drugs were well tolerated without
      relevant changes in vital signs of clinical laboratory parameters. CONCLUSION:
      Pantoprazole 40 mg is significantly more effective than omeprazole 20 mg in
      raising intragastric pH.

TI  - Dose-response of omeprazole combined with amoxycillin on duodenal ulcer healing
      and eradication of Helicobacter pylori.
PG  - 303-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Combination therapy using omeprazole and amoxycillin can cure
      Helicobacter pylori infection, but data are controversial concerning the efficacy
      of this regimen. The present study investigated varying doses of omeprazole
      combined with a standard amoxycillin dose on duodenal ulcer healing and
      eradication of H. pylori, in order to find an optimal dose regimen. METHODS: H.
      pylori-positive out-patients (n = 231) with duodenal ulcers were treated randomly
      and double-blind with either omeprazole 20, 40 or 80 mg b.d. plus amoxycillin 1 g
      b.d. for 14 days. Patients with an unhealed ulcer after this therapy took
      omeprazole 20 mg o.m. for another month. RESULTS: After 2 weeks, ulcer healing
      rates in the three treatment groups were not statistically different (85, 82 and 
      93%, respectively). Treatment with omeprazole 80 mg b.d. was significantly better
      in curing H. pylori infection (eradication rate 69%) than treatment with
      omeprazole 20 and 40 mg b.d. (47 and 53%). CONCLUSIONS: Combination of either
      omeprazole 20 or 40 mg b.d. plus amoxycillin 1 g b.d., is not sufficiently
      effective to be recommended as an anti-H. pylori therapy. Omeprazole 80 mg b.d.
      combined with amoxycillin is more efficient and well tolerated, but better
      treatment options now exist to cure H. pylori infection.

TI  - Low-dose omeprazole plus clarithromycin and either tinidazole or amoxycillin for 
      Helicobacter pylori infection.
PG  - 285-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of our study was to compare two 1-week, low-dose triple
      therapies for Helicobacter pylori eradication. METHODS: One hundred consecutive
      patients, suffering from dyspeptic symptoms with H. pylori infection, were
      randomly allocated to 7 days of treatment with omeprazole 20 mg o.m. plus
      clarithromycin 250 mg b.d. and either tinidazole 500 mg b.d. (group A: n = 50, 19
      with peptic ulcer) or amoxycillin 1000 mg b.d. (group B: n = 50, 20 with peptic
      ulcer). H. pylori-status was evaluated by means of histology, culture and urease 
      test, at entry and 8 weeks after treatment. RESULTS: Three patients did not
      complete the treatment. H. pylori eradication was obtained in 35 patients from
      group A (73%) (95% CI, 55-82%) and in 40 patients from group B (82%) (95% CI,
      66-90%). On intention-to-treat analysis, the rates of eradication were similar.
      Side-effects occurred in seven patients from group A (14.58%) and in four
      patients from group B (8.33%), but none discontinued therapy because of
      side-effects. CONCLUSION: Both triple 1-week, low-dose omeprazole therapies gave 
      good eradication rates with infrequent side-effects.

TI  - A seven-day Helicobacter pylori treatment regimen using clarithromycin,
      omeprazole and tripotassium dicitrato bismuthate.
PG  - 279-83
AB  - AIM: To evaluate clarithromycin 500 mg t.d.s., tripotassium dicitrato bismuthate 
      240 mg b.d. and omeprazole 20 mg b.d. for 7 days as a Helicobacter pylori
      treatment regimen. METHODS: The H. pylori status of dyspeptic patients undergoing
      endoscopy was assessed by histology, culture and rapid urease testing of biopsies
      and by 13C-urea breath test. Fifty patients who were H. pylori-positive were
      treated with the above treatment regimen for 7 days. Those patients with active
      duodenal ulcers present at endoscopy were given omeprazole 20 mg nocte for a
      further 21 days. Not less than 28 days after completing treatment, all tests were
      repeated to reassess H. pylori status. Bacterial sensitivity of H. pylori
      cultures was determined and patients recorded any side-effects. RESULTS: On an
      intention-to-treat basis, H. pylori infection was cured in 90% (95% CI: 78-96%)
      of patients. Taste disturbance was experienced by 35% patients. Compliance was
      excellent, with 96% patients taking more than 95% of tablets. Metronidazole
      resistance was 41% but all cultures were sensitive to clarithromycin.
      CONCLUSIONS: This 7-day treatment achieved a high level of cure of H. pylori
      infection with relatively minor side-effects. It may have a role to play,
      particularly where there is a high level of metronidazole resistance.

TI  - Comparison of two low-dose one-week triple therapy regimens with and without
      metronidazole for cure of H. pylori infection.
PG  - 275-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: One-week triple therapy consisting of omeprazole 20 mg b.d.,
      clarithromycin 250 mg b.d. and tinidazole 500 mg b.d. is an effective therapy for
      H. pylori infection with a cure rate of 93%. We therefore compared two similar
      1-week regimens consisting of a lansoprazole, clarithromycin and either
      metronidazole or tetracycline in a prospective study. METHODS: Two cohorts, each 
      of 60 patients suffering from H. pylori infection associated with peptic ulcer
      disease or ulcer-like dyspepsia, were treated for 1 week with either lansoprazole
      30 mg b.d., clarithromycin 250 mg b.d. and either metronidazole 400 mg b.d.
      (cohort A, n = 60) or tetracycline 300 mg b.d. (cohort B, n = 60). Four weeks
      after treatment, cure of H. pylori infection was evaluated by endoscopy using
      rapid urease testing together with histology. RESULTS: In cohort A, 55 patients
      out of 60 showed cure of H. pylori infection (92%); the treatment was well
      tolerated, but three patients suffered from side-effects. In cohort B, which was 
      free of metronidazole, 50 out of 60 patients showed cure of H. pylori infection
      (83%); two patients reported side-effects. The differences between the two
      cohorts were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Triple therapy for 1 week
      with lansoprazole as the antisecretory agent seems to be as effective as is
      reported for omeprazole-based regimens.

TI  - Brush cytology: a reliable method to detect Helicobacter pylori.
PG  - 317-21
AB  - This study was conducted to verify the reliability of brush cytology in detecting
      Helicobacter pylori in an unselected group of patients with duodenal ulcer (DU)
      and nonulcer dyspepsia (NUD). Endoscopy was performed on 416 consecutive
      patients: group A, 94 with active DU; group B, 176 patients with DU after
      omeprazole (n = 78), ranitidine (n = 43), or triple anti-H. pylori therapy (n =
      55); and group C, 146 patients with NUD. During endoscopy, the gastric mucosa was
      brushed and two biopsy samples from the antrum and body were obtained for
      histology. In 65 patients, culture of the brush-collected materials also was
      performed as was that from of biopsy samples. The overall frequency of H. pylori 
      presence detected by brush cytology was significantly higher compared with that
      of histology (p < 0.001), particularly in group A (p < 0.05), group C (p < 0.05),
      and in patients with DU after omeprazole treatment (p < 0.01), but not in
      patients with DU after ranitidine or anti-H. pylori treatment. The overall
      frequency of H. pylori-positive cultures from the brush-collected material was
      higher compared with cultures from the biopsy samples (38.5% vs. 24.6%),
      particularly in the NUD group (32.6% vs. 16.3%). Brush cytology is more sensitive
      than histology, besides being faster and cheaper, for the assessment of H. pylori
      infection, particularly when the density of the bacteria is low.

TI  - How to achieve a near 100% cure rate for H. pylori infection in peptic ulcer
      patients. A personal viewpoint.
PG  - 313-6
AB  - Infection with Helicobacter pylori is the main etiological factor in duodenal and
      gastric ulcer disease, and eradication of the organism cures peptic ulcer
      disease. Cure of the infection therefore has become the ultimate treatment goal
      in ulcer patients. Only therapies that achieve a > 90% cure rate should be used
      in clinical practice and, as in any other disease, the therapy with the highest
      cure rates should be used. Bismuth-based triple therapy is considered the gold
      standard; it has been used successfully in many studies, usually with good
      tolerability on the part of patients. Many physicians have been hesitant to
      prescribe this therapy. The regimen is complex, and it is thought to have many
      side effects. Several groups have shown that concomitant therapy with a proton
      pump inhibitor increases efficacy and lessens side effects. Moreover, it has
      become clear that the duration of treatment can be decreased to just 7 days. With
      this adjustment it now seems sensible to use this short 7-day quadruple therapy, 
      which at present has superior cure rates when compared with any other
      anti-Helicobacter therapy. This article is a plea for the use of this regimen and
      gives practical advice about how to employ therapy in general practice.
      Suggestions are made about how to motivate a patient to comply with the therapy
      prescribed. If these suggestions are followed, good compliance seems possible,
      and a near 100% cure rate will be within reach.

TI  - The role of a defective lower esophageal sphincter in the clinical outcome of
      treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 655-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical role of a defective lower esophageal
      sphincter in the long-term outcome of medical and surgical treatment for
      gastroesophageal reflux disease. DESIGN: Nonrandomized control study (median
      follow-up, 33 months). SETTING: Referred care. PATIENTS: Fifty-five patients with
      gastroesophageal reflux disease were prospectively evaluated using a symptom
      questionnaire, upper endoscopy, esophageal manometry, and 24-hour pH monitoring. 
      Patients were classified into three groups: (1) those with a manometrically
      defective lower esophageal sphincter, treated surgically; (2) those with a
      manometrically defective lower esophageal sphincter, treated medically; and (3)
      those with a manometrically normal lower esophageal sphincter, treated medically.
      INTERVENTION: Nissen antireflux procedure and medical therapy with H2-blockers
      and/or omeprazole. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Symptomatic improvement after treatment
      and need for continuous medication. RESULTS: After therapy, symptoms improved
      significantly in all three groups (P < .05), but least in the patients who
      declined surgery. Among patients with a defective lower esophageal sphincter,
      medical therapy could be discontinued in 13 of 14 patients who had surgery
      compared with one of 14 who declined surgery. Of the 27 patients with a normal
      lower esophageal sphincter who were treated medically, medical therapy could be
      discontinued in 12. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease
      who have a defective lower esophageal sphincter, surgery can ensure durable
      symptom control. Patients with a defective sphincter who decline surgery are
      destined for lifelong therapy, whereas in approximately half of those with a
      normal sphincter, medical therapy can eventually be discontinued.

TI  - Effective maintenance treatment of reflux esophagitis with low-dose lansoprazole.
      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 859-67
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of two doses of lansoprazole with that of
      placebo in preventing recurrence of erosive esophagitis in a 12-month period.
      DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: 25
      U.S. medical centers. PATIENTS: 173 patients with documented healing of erosive
      esophagitis after 8 weeks of acid-suppressing therapy. INTERVENTION:
      Lansoprazole, 15 mg or 30 mg, or placebo once daily for as long as 12 months.
      MEASUREMENTS: Endoscopy and symptom evaluation after 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months
      of treatment. Endoscopy was also done whenever symptoms suggested erosive
      changes. RESULTS: Lansoprazole was significantly superior to placebo in
      maintaining healing and preventing recurrence of symptoms. By month 1, 45% of
      placebo recipients remained healed compared with more than 90% of patients in
      either lansoprazole group. By month 12, only 24% of placebo recipients remained
      healed compared with 79% of patients receiving 15 mg of lansoprazole and 90% of
      patients receiving 30 mg of lansoprazole. During the same period, 35% of placebo 
      recipients remained asymptomatic compared with 72% of recipients of 15 mg of
      lansoprazole and 67% of recipients of 30 mg of lansoprazole. The 15-mg and 30-mg 
      lansoprazole doses did not differ significantly in maintaining healing and
      controlling symptoms. Follow-up after recurrence of erosion indicated that during
      the 12 months, 35% of placebo recipients and 2% of lansoprazole recipients had
      three or more recurrences. CONCLUSION: Lansoprazole effectively maintains healing
      of erosive esophagitis. The 15-mg and 30-mg lansoprazole doses did not differ
      significantly for use as maintenance treatment.

TI  - Refractory duodenal ulcer healing and relapse: comparison of omeprazole with
      Helicobacter pylori eradication.
PG  - 449-52
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate differences between omeprazole and Helicobacter pylori 
      eradication in patients with duodenal ulcers refractory to H2-receptor
      antagonists and to compare the recurrence rates after the two treatments. DESIGN 
      AND METHODS: Forty-five patients with endoscopically proven duodenal ulcers
      refractory to H2-receptor antagonists and H. pylori infection were randomly
      assigned to 8 weeks of treatment with omeprazole 40 mg/day or 4 weeks of
      treatment with colloidal bismuth subcitrate 480 mg/day plus metronidazole 750
      mg/day and tetracycline 1000 mg/day from day 1 to day 14. Patients were evaluated
      endoscopically and clinically at the end of treatment. Patients with healed
      ulcers were followed up for 1 year after cessation of the treatment. Endoscopy
      was performed at 3 and 12 months. RESULTS: Ulcer healing occurred in 100% (21/21)
      of patients on triple therapy and 70.5% (12/17) of those treated with omeprazole 
      alone (P = 0.0123). The relapse rate at the 3rd month was 11.7% (2/17) in the
      triple therapy group and 60% (6/10) in the omeprazole group (P = 0.0248). Of the 
      patients followed to study endpoint (relapse or endoscopy at 12 months) three of 
      12 (25%) receiving triple therapy, compared to six of eight (75%) receiving
      omeprazole, relapsed (P = 0.0648). CONCLUSION: These results show that triple
      therapy is more effective than omeprazole in the treatment of refractory duodenal
      ulcers and reduces the rate of ulcer relapse.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori eradication with short-term therapy leads to duodenal ulcer
      healing without the need for continued acid suppression therapy.
PG  - 421-3
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether duodenal ulcers continue to heal following
      successful Helicobacter pylori eradication with short-term eradication therapy
      without further acid suppression therapy. METHODS: Patients with endoscopically
      proven duodenal ulcers who were H. pylori positive were randomized to receive
      omeprazole 40 mg each morning and clarithromycin 500 mg three times daily or
      famotidine 40 mg twice daily and clarithromycin 500 mg three times daily for 2
      weeks. No acid-suppressing agents nor ulcerhealing drugs such as bismuth
      compounds or sucralfate were prescribed after that. Patients were re-examined
      endoscopically at week 2 at the end of treatment, and at week 6, 4 weeks after
      the completion of treatment. RESULTS: Thirty of 44 (68.2%) patients from both
      treatment arms, in whom the bacteria were subsequently noted to have been
      eradicated, had healed ulcers at week 2; at Week 6, 42 of 44 (95.5%) were noted
      to have healed ulcers without further acid-suppressing or ulcer-healing
      treatment. CONCLUSION: Although a short-term acid-suppressing treatment is
      insufficient to heal ulcers, where an important putative factor such as H. pylori
      is eliminated, the ulcer healing process continues without further need for
      acid-suppressing or ulcer-healing agents.

TI  - Relation between oesophageal acid exposure and healing of oesophagitis with
      omeprazole in patients with severe reflux oesophagitis.
PG  - 649-54
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Reducing oesophageal acid exposure by suppressing acid secretion
      with omeprazole is highly effective in healing reflux oesophagitis. Some patients
      with severe oesophagitis, fail to heal and whether this results from inadequate
      acid suppression or other factors is unclear. The aim of this study, was to
      investigate the relation between oesophageal acid exposure and healing in
      patients with severe reflux oesophagitis treated with omeprazole. METHODS: Sixty 
      one patients with grade 3 or 4 ulcerative oesophagitis were treated for eight
      weeks with omeprazole 20 mg every morning. Those patients unhealed at eight weeks
      were treated with 40 mg every morning for a further eight weeks. Endoscopy and 24
      hour oesophageal pH monitoring were performed before treatment and at the end of 
      each treatment phase while receiving treatment. RESULTS: Thirty per cent of
      patients failed to heal with the 20 mg dose. Unhealed patients had greater total 
      24 hour oesophageal acid exposure before treatment, and while receiving treatment
      also had greater acid exposure and a smaller reduction in acid exposure than did 
      patients who healed. Forty seven per cent of the unhealed patients also failed to
      heal with the 40 mg dose. These patients had similar levels of acid exposure
      before treatment to those who healed, but had greater acid exposure while
      receiving treatment, particularly at night when supine. CONCLUSIONS: Patients
      with severe ulcerative oesophagitis who are refractory to omeprazole have greater
      oesophageal acid exposure while receiving treatment than responding patients.
      This is due to a reduced responsiveness to acid suppression, and is likely to be 
      an important factor underlying the failure of the oesophagitis to heal.

TI  - Atrophic gastritis and Helicobacter pylori infection in patients with reflux
      esophagitis treated with omeprazole or fundoplication.
PG  - 1018-22
AB  - BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori infection plays an important part in the
      development of atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia, conditions that
      predispose patients gastric cancer. Profound suppression of gastric acid is
      associated with increased severity of gastritis caused by H. pylori, but it is
      not known whether acid suppression increases the risk of atrophic gastritis.
      METHODS: We studied patients from two separate cohorts who were being treated for
      reflux esophagitis: 72 patients treated with fundoplication in Sweden and 105
      treated with omeprazole (20 to 40 mg once daily) in the Netherlands. In both
      cohorts, the patients were followed for an average of five years (range, three to
      eight). After fundoplication, the patients did not receive acid-suppressive
      therapy. The presence of H. pylori was assessed at the first visit by histologic 
      evaluation in the fundoplication group and by histologic and serologic evaluation
      in the omeprazole group. The patients were not treated for H. pylori infection.
      Before treatment and during follow-up, the patients underwent repeated
      gastroscopy, with biopsy sampling for histologic evaluation. RESULTS: Among the
      patients treated with fundoplication, atrophic gastritis did not develop in any
      of the 31 who were infected with H. pylori at base line or the 41 who were not
      infected; 1 patient infected with H. pylori had atrophic gastritis before
      treatment that persisted after treatment. Among the patients treated with
      omeprazole, none of whom had atrophic gastritis at base line, atrophic gastritis 
      developed in 18 of the 59 infected with H. pylori(P<0.001) and 2 of the 46 who
      were not infected (P=0.62). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with reflux esophagitis and H. 
      pylori infection who are treated with omeprazole are at increased risk of
      atrophic gastritis.

TI  - Cure of gastric ulcer disease after cure of Helicobacter pylori infection--German
      Gastric Ulcer Study.
PG  - 343-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with gastric ulcer
      disease in about 75% of cases. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine 
      whether H. pylori eradication reduces gastric ulcer relapse rates. DESIGN: The
      study was randomized, controlled, multicentric and investigator blinded, and was 
      conducted at three university hospitals, two teaching hospitals, and by six
      practising gastroenterologists. METHODS: During a period of 1 year 152 patients
      with gastric ulcers were randomly assigned to one of two treatment regimens:
      omeprazole 20 mg daily in the morning for 8 weeks (74 patients), or bismuth
      subsalicylate 600 mg three times daily for 8 weeks combined with 500 mg
      amoxicillin twice daily and 1000 mg tinidazole twice daily for the first 10 days 
      (triple therapy) (78 patients). Follow-up examinations were performed 6, 12 and
      18 months after treatment and whenever ulcer symptoms occurred. RESULTS: Of the
      152 randomized patients five were excluded because of gastric cancer, 10 missed
      follow-up examinations and seven receiving triple therapy terminated treatment
      because of side effects. Of the remaining 130 patients, five of 69 (7.2%) in the 
      omeprazole and six of 61 (9.8%) in the triple group were H. pylori negative.
      After 8 weeks' therapy, the gastric ulcer was healed in 85.9% (omeprazole) and in
      81.8% triple) in H. pylori-positive patients, and in 80% (omeprazole) and 16.7%
      (triple) in H. pylori-negatives. H. pylori was eradicated in 8.1% of the patients
      who received omeprazole monotherapy and in 78.2% receiving triple therapy, and in
      8.1% and 69.4% in an intention-to-treat analysis. The subsequent relapse rates
      during a follow-up period of 12 months were 50% in the omeprazole group and 4% in
      the triple group. Gastric ulcer relapse was observed in 49% of patients who were 
      H. pylori positive and in 2% who were H. pylori negative after treatment.
      CONCLUSION: The data show that the presence of H. pylori is an important
      predictor of gastric ulcer relapse and that eradication of H. pylori may heal
      gastric ulcer disease.

TI  - Comparison of two lansoprazole-antibiotic combinations (amoxycillin or classical 
      triple therapy) for treatment of H. pylori infection in duodenal ulcer patients.
PG  - 211-3
AB  - AIM: To compare the eradicating capacity of two different antibiotic-lansoprazole
      combinations (amoxycillin vs. standard triple therapy) with that of lansoprazole 
      alone in Helicobacter pylori-positive duodenal ulcer patients. METHODS:
      Ninety-six out-patients with H. pylori-positive duodenal ulcer were randomly
      assigned to receive one of the following three antiulcer regimens: (1)
      lansoprazole 30 mg b.d. for 4 weeks plus amoxycillin 1 g t.d.s. during the last 2
      weeks; or (2) lansoprazole 30 mg once daily for 4 weeks plus classical triple
      therapy (tripotassium dicitratobismuthate 240 mg b.d., amoxycillin 1 g t.d.s. and
      tinidazole 500 mg b.d.) for the last 2 weeks; or (3) lansoprazole 30 mg once
      daily for 4 weeks. Endoscopy was repeated at the end of treatment and 1 month
      later. A rapid urease test and histology were used to determine H. pylori status.
      RESULTS: Duodenal ulcer healing rates at 4 weeks were 96% after both lansoprazole
      with amoxycillin, and lansoprazole with triple therapy, and 97% after
      lansoprazole alone. Eradication of H. pylori was significantly better with
      lansoprazole with triple therapy than with either lansoprazole with amoxycillin
      or lansoprazole alone (90% vs. 55% vs. 3%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Classical
      triple therapy combined with lansoprazole is significantly more effective than
      the lansoprazole with amoxycillin combination for the eradication of H. pylori in
      duodenal ulcer patients pre-treated with lansoprazole.

TI  - Treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection with low or high dose omeprazole
      combined with amoxycillin and the effect of early retreatment.
PG  - 165-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cure rates of H. pylori infection, using dual therapy with omeprazole
      and amoxycillin, vary considerably and the efficacy of retreatment with this
      regimen in the case of initial failure is controversial. Therefore, we conducted 
      a large prospective double-blind randomized trial, studying the efficacy of low
      vs. high dose omeprazole in dual therapy and of early retreatment with the same
      regimens. METHODS: One hundred and sixty-eight consecutive H. pylori-positive
      patients, suffering from either peptic ulcer disease or functional dyspepsia,
      were enrolled. Group I (n = 84) received omeprazole 20 mg b.d. plus amoxycillin
      750 mg t.d.s., for 2 weeks. Group II (n = 84) received omeprazole 40 mg t.d.s.
      plus amoxicillin 750 mg t.d.s., for 2 weeks. RESULTS: The H. pylori eradication
      rate was 60.2% in group I and 64.3% in group II (P = 0.59). Cure of H. pylori
      infection was significantly better in patients with peptic ulcer disease,
      compared to non-ulcer dyspeptics (P = 0.016). Retreatment, given in 54 patients, 
      was successful in 21.4% patients in group I and in 28% patients in group II (P = 
      0.58). CONCLUSIONS: High dose of omeprazole has no advantage compared to low dose
      in terms of eradication efficacy. Early retreatment with the same regimen offers 
      limited improvement in cure rate. Presence of peptic ulcer disease influences
      cure rates significantly.

TI  - Effects of pirenzepine on omeprazole-induced hypergastrinemia and acid
      suppression in peptic ulcer patients.
PG  - 167-70
AB  - Omeprazole effectively suppresses acid secretion, resulting in the long-term
      elevation of intragastric pH and serum gastrin level. Pirenzepine has been
      reported to inhibit gastrin secretion. This study was carried out to examine the 
      effects of additional pirenzepine treatment on the hypergastrinemia and gastric
      acid suppression induced by omeprazole. Concentrations of serum gastrin and
      plasma somatostatin were measured in 28 peptic ulcer patients before treatment,
      after omeprazole treatment (20 mg/day) for 2 weeks, and after omeprazole and
      pirenzepine (100 mg/day) treatment for 2 weeks. The acid inhibitory effect of
      pirenzepine treatment in addition to omeprazole was evaluated by 24-h
      intragastric pH measurement in six healthy volunteers. Serum gastrin level was
      increased significantly, to 2.4-fold the pretreatment level, by omeprazole
      treatment. Additional treatment with pirenzepine suppressed serum gastrin level
      to 0.6-fold the omeprazole-treatment level. The serum somatostatin level was not 
      altered significantly either by omeprazole treatment or by omeprazole and
      pirenzepine treatment. In healthy volunteers whose pH 3 holding time on 24-h
      intragastric pH monitoring was 70% by omeprazole treatment, omeprazole and
      pirenzepine treatment markedly increased the pH 3 holding time, to 89%. These
      findings suggest that pirenzepine is useful in reducing the undesirable effects
      of omeprazole-induced hypergastrinemia, i.e., the excessive trophic effect of
      omeprazole on the acid-secreting part of the stomach and the overstimulation of
      acid secretion. The additional pirenzepine treatment is also effective in
      suppressing acid secretion.

TI  - Omeprazole coupled with two antibiotics for Helicobacter pylori eradication and
      prevention of ulcer recurrence.
PG  - 695-700
AB  - BACKGROUND: Numerous therapeutic trials aimed at eradicating Helicobacter pylori 
      (HP) from the gastric mucosa and preventing ulcer recurrence have been carried
      out; however, an optimal treatment has not yet been established with carefully
      controlled randomized studies. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to evaluate
      the efficacy of an association of omeprazole (OM) coupled with two antibiotics in
      the eradication of HP and prevention of duodenal ulcer (DU) recurrence. METHODS: 
      One hundred and eighty three patients with active DU were randomized under
      double-blind conditions to receive either OM 20 mg for 4 wk plus amoxycillin 3 g 
      daily and metronidazole 1 g daily during the 2nd and 3rd wk (91 patients, group
      A) or OM 20 mg for 4 wk plus matching placebo (92 patients, group B). Endoscopy
      was performed before and at the end of the 4-wk treatment as well as 2, 6, and 12
      months later. Biopsies were taken from the duodenum, antrum, and gastric body at 
      each endoscopic examination for HP histological detection and for evaluation of
      inflammatory changes according to the Sydney system. RESULTS: After 4 wk, 84/86
      patients (98%) of group A and 80/86 (93%) of group B were healed of their ulcers.
      The percentage of eradication was 90% in group A and 1% in group B. During a
      12-month follow-up, DU relapsed in 4/63 (6%, including two of three reinfected
      cases) HP-eradicated group A patients, 4/8 (50%) HP-noneradicated group A
      patients, and 52/65 (80%) persistently HP-positive group B patients. Rapid,
      complete, and persistent suppression of gastroduodenitis activity and gastric
      surface epithelium lesions was observed in most HP-eradicated group A patients,
      whereas a transient decrease of bacterial colonization and inflammatory scores in
      the antrum and a transient worsening of corpus gastritis were found in group B
      patients. CONCLUSIONS: The combined therapy with amoxycillin, metronidazole, and 
      omeprazole is highly effective in both HP eradication and prevention of duodenal 
      ulcer recurrence.

TI  - A comparison of lansoprazole, omeprazole, and ranitidine for reducing
      preoperative gastric secretion in adult patients undergoing elective surgery.
PG  - 832-6
AB  - Acid aspiration syndrome of induction of anesthesia is a life-threatening
      complication whose severity is affected by both pH and volume of the aspirated
      gastric juice. We compared the effects of two proton pump inhibitors (PPIs),
      lansoprazole and omeprazole, and an H2 blocker, ranitidine, on gastric secretion 
      in a prospective, randomized, double-blind fashion in 200 adult patients of ASA
      physical status I undergoing elective surgery. The patients were divided into
      eight groups (n = 25 each) according to their premedication. The patients
      received lansoprazole-lansoprazole (Group L-L), lansoprazole-placebo (Group L-P),
      placebo-lansoprazole (Group P-L), omeprazole-omeprazole (Group O-O),
      omeprazole-placebo (Group O-P), placebo-omeprazole (Group P-O),
      placebo-ranitidine (Group P-R), or placebo-placebo (Group P-P), as the first and 
      second medications. The dose of the study drug was 30 mg for lansoprazole, 150 mg
      for ranitidine, and 80 mg for omeprazole. The first medication was administered
      orally at 9:00 PM on the night before surgery and the second at 5:30 AM in the
      morning on the day of the surgery. Each patient fasted overnight and took the
      drug with 20 mL of water. After tracheal intubation, gastric fluid was aspirated 
      via an orogastric tube and the volume and pH of the aspirate were measured. The
      pH of the aspirated gastric fluid was higher in Groups P-R, L-L, P-L, O-O, and
      O-P than in Group P-P (P < 0.05). The volume of the gastric contents was similar 
      in Groups P-0 and P-P, and the other groups had smaller gastric volume than Group
      P-P (P < 0.05). Gastric fluid from patients in Group P-R was the least acidic (pH
      6.1 +/- 1.2) and had the least volume (0.09 +/- 0.06 mL/kg). Group L-L was
      comparable with Group P-R in both pH and volume, whereas Groups P-L and O-O were 
      similar to Group P-R only in volume. The proportion of patients at risk according
      to the traditional criteria (pH < 2.5 and volume 0.4 mL/kg) was significantly
      lower in Groups L-L (0%), P-L (4%), O-O (4%), and P-R (0%) than in Group P-P
      (48%) (P < 0.05). We concluded that two consecutive doses of lansoprazole or a
      morning dose of ranitidine seemed to be the most effective preanesthetic
      medication for reducing gastric acidity and volume.

TI  - Asthma and gastroesophageal reflux: acid suppressive therapy improves asthma
      outcome.
PG  - 395-405
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine (1) the appropriate omeprazole (Prilosec) dose required for
      adequate acid suppression in asthmatics with gastroesophageal reflux, (2) whether
      aggressive acid suppressive therapy of gastroesophageal reflux improves asthma
      outcome in asthmatics with gastroesophageal reflux, (3) the time course of asthma
      improvement, and (4) demographic, esophageal, or pulmonary predictors of a
      positive asthma response to antireflux therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty
      nonsmoking adult asthmatics with gastroesophageal reflux (asthma defined by
      American Thoracic Society criteria and reflux defined by symptoms and abnormal
      24-hour esophageal pH testing) were recruited from the outpatient clinics of a
      900-bed university hospital. Patients underwent baseline studies including a
      demographic questionnaire, esophageal manometry, dual-probe 24-hour esophageal pH
      test, barium esophogram, and pulmonary spirometry. During the 4-week pretherapy
      phase, patients recorded reflux and asthma symptom scores and peak expiratory
      flow rates (PEFs) upon awakening, 1 hour after dinner, and at bedtime. Patients
      began 20 mg/d omeprazole, and the dose was titrated until acid suppression was
      documented by 24-hour pH test. Patients remained on this acid suppressive dose
      for 3 months. Responders were identified by a priori definitions: asthma symptom 
      reduction by >20% and/or PEF increase by >20%. Asthma symptom scores, PEF's
      baseline and posttherapy pulmonary spirometry were analyzed. RESULTS: Twenty-two 
      (73%) patients were asthma symptom and /or PEF responders: 20 (67%) were asthma
      symptom responders, and 6 (20%) were PEF responders. Responders reduced their
      asthma symptoms by 57% (P<0.001), improved their morning and night PEFs by 8% and
      9% (both P <0.005), and had improvement in forced expiratory volume at 1 second
      (P <0.02), mean forced expiratory flow during the middle half (25% to 75%) of the
      forced vital capacity (P <0.04), and peak expiratory flow (P <0.01) with acid
      suppressive therapy. Mean acid suppressive dose of omeprazole was 27 mg/d
      (+/-2.2) with 27% (8) patients requiring more than 20 mg/d. The presence of
      regurgitation or excessive proximal esophageal reflux predicted asthma response
      with 100% sensitivity, 100% negative predictive value, specificity of 44% and a
      positive predictive value of 79%. CONCLUSIONS: Acid suppressive therapy with
      omeprazole improves asthma symptoms and/or PEFs by >20% and improves pulmonary
      function in 73% of asthmatics with gastroesophageal reflux after 3 months of acid
      suppressive therapy. Many asthmatics (27%) required >20 mg/d of omeprazole to
      suppress acid. The presence of regurgitation and/or excessive proximal esophageal

TI  - Pantoprazole. A review of its pharmacological properties and therapeutic use in
      acid-related disorders.
PG  - 460-82
AB  - Pantoprazole is an irreversible proton pump inhibitor which, at the therapeutic
      dose of 40mg, effectively reduces gastric acid secretion. In controlled clinical 
      trials, pantoprazole (40mg once daily) has proved superior to ranitidine (300mg
      once daily or 150mg twice daily) and equivalent to omeprazole (20mg once daily)
      in the short term (< or = 8 weeks) treatment of acute peptic ulcer and reflux
      oesophagitis. Gastric and duodenal ulcer healing proceeded significantly faster
      with pantoprazole than with ranitidine, and at similar rates with pantoprazole
      and omeprazole. The time course of gastric ulcer pain relief was similar with
      pantoprazole, ranitidine and omeprazole, whereas duodenal ulcer pain was
      alleviated more rapidly with pantoprazole than ranitidine. Pantoprazole (40mg
      once daily) showed superior efficacy to famotidine (40mg once daily) in ulcer
      healing and pain relief after 2 weeks in patients with duodenal ulcer in a large 
      multicentre nonblinded study. In mild to moderate acute reflux oesophagitis,
      significantly greater healing was obtained with pantoprazole than with ranitidine
      and famotidine, whereas similar healing rates were seen with pantoprazole and
      omeprazole. Pantoprazole showed a significant advantage over ranitidine in
      relieving symptoms of heartburn and acid regurgitation. Reflux symptoms were
      similarly alleviated by pantoprazole and omeprazole. Preliminary results indicate
      that triple therapy with pantoprazole, clarithromycin and either metronidazole or
      tinidazole is effective in the treatment of Helicobacter pylori-associated
      disease; however, these findings require confirmation in large well-controlled
      studies. Pantoprazole appears to be well tolerated during short term oral
      administration, with diarrhoea (1.5%), headache (1.3%), dizziness (0.7%),
      pruritus (0.5%) and skin rash (0.4%) representing the most frequent adverse
      events. The drug has lower affinity than omeprazole or lansoprazole for hepatic
      cytochrome P450 and shows no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic or
      pharmacodynamic interactions at therapeutic doses with a wide range of drug
      substrates for this isoenzyme system. In conclusion, pantoprazole is superior to 
      ranitidine and as effective as omeprazole in the short term treatment of peptic
      ulcer and reflux oesophagitis, has shown efficacy when combined with
      antibacterial agents in H. pylori eradication, is apparently well tolerated and
      offers the potential advantage of minimal risk of drug interaction.

TI  - A randomized blinded comparison of omeprazole and ranitidine in the treatment of 
      chronic esophageal stricture secondary to acid peptic esophagitis.
PG  - 216-21
AB  - BACKGROUND: Esophageal strictures due to gastroesophageal reflux disease are
      often resistant to medical therapy and require repeated dilation procedures. Our 
      aim was to compare the efficacy of therapy with omeprazole (20 mg/day) to
      ranitidine (150 mg twice daily) in the treatment of chronic esophageal
      strictures. METHODS: Thirty-three patients with chronic esophageal stricture
      disease (mean length of prior treatment, 50.9 months) were entered into a
      randomized blinded trial. The majority (88%) of the patients had received
      multiple prior esophageal dilations (mean, 7.9 per patient). Endoscopy and barium
      esophagograms were performed initially and at the end of 10 months. Symptoms were
      considered every 2 months and dilations performed as needed. The patient groups
      were equivalent. RESULTS: One patient in each group was subsequently lost to
      follow-up. No significant differences were seen in symptom improvement or need of
      dilation. At the final endoscopy, 8 of 17 (47%) patients receiving ranitidine had
      residual erosions or ulceration, compared with 1 of 14 (7%) patients receiving
      omeprazole (p >0.2). All patients receiving ranitidine had persistent strictures,
      whereas 8 of 14 (57.1%) patients receiving omeprazole had radiographic and
      endoscopic resolution of their strictures (p <0.004). CONCLUSION: These data
      further emphasize the need for vigorously treating esophagitis in patients with
      acid peptic strictures.

TI  - Effect of omeprazole in the treatment of refractory acid-related diseases in
      childhood: endoscopic healing and twenty-four-hour intragastric acidity.
PG  - 415-21
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical efficacy of once-daily treatment with
      omeprazole in refractory acid-related diseases in children. METHODS: Endoscopic
      healing and 24-hour intragastric pH values were assessed in 13 patients with
      refractory reflux esophagitis (n = 5), refractory and/or giant duodenal ulcer (n 
      = 6), or giant gastric ulcer (n = 2). The mean dose of omeprazole was 0.6 mg/kg
      per day (range, 0.3 to 0.7 mg/kg per day). Pharmacokinetic studies of omeprazole 
      were performed in seven patients. RESULTS: The cumulative healing rates at 2, 4, 
      6, and 8 weeks of treatment were 46%, 85%, 92%, and 92%, respectively.
      Esophagitis in one patient did not heal despite increases in doses of up to 1.6
      mg/kg per day (40 mg/day). The mean intragastric pH of omeprazole-treated
      patients was 5.2 (range, 3.0 to 6.6) and mean hydrogenion activity was 1.78
      mmol/L (range, 0.01 to 10.42 mmol/L). There was wide interindividual variation in
      the reduction of gastric acid production. Mean intragastric H+ activity in
      omeprazole-treated patients was significantly lower than that of control subjects
      (p < 0.005) and that of patients treated with histamine type 2(H2)-receptor
      antagonists (p < 0.05). Mean intragastric H+ activity was not significantly
      correlated to the area under the concentration-time curve of omeprazole. No
      severe adverse effects were reported during treatment or at follow-up.
      CONCLUSIONS: Omeprazole has a potent antisecretory effect and is a suitable
      alternative for short-term treatment of refractory acid-related diseases; a
      relatively low dose (0.6 mg/kg per day) appears to be optimal in most patients.
      Unhealed esophagitis at 8 weeks of treatment was considered to be refractory to
      omeprazole.

TI  - Cost of acid peptic disorders in a managed-care organization.
PG  - 319-33; discussion 302
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the cost of managing ambulatory
      patients with symptoms of acid peptic disorders in a managed-care organization
      under actual clinical conditions. Study data were collected in a large
      independent practice association model health maintenance organization in
      Gainesville, Florida, from prescription records maintained in a computerized
      database and from patient medical records. Patients had to be started on a
      histamine2-receptor antagonist (H2RA) or the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole
      between 1992 and 1994. A total of 113 patients qualified for inclusion in the
      study; 57 received H2RAs, 27 received omeprazole, and 29 received combination
      therapy. The costs of procedures, physician visits, and drug therapy were
      considered in the economic evaluation. Costs were evaluated using two methods:
      the capitation total cost (CTC) and the fee-for-service total cost (FSTC). The
      mean CTC and FSTC for managing a patient with acid peptic symptoms for 6 months
      were $382 +/- 356 (range, $14 to $1820) and $456 +/- 368 (range, $52 to $1925),
      respectively. Drug costs represented 52% of the total FSTC and 62% of the total
      CTC. Drug costs were followed by the costs for encounters with primary care
      physicians, endoscopy, referral to specialists, and upper gastrointestinal (UGI) 
      tract procedures. Documented outcomes were available for 85 patients. Compared
      with patients receiving H2RAs (n = 41), patients receiving omeprazole (n = 18)
      had significantly lower FSTCs ($317 +/- 219 compared with $423 +/- 307,
      respectively); diagnostic testing costs (for endoscopy, $0 compared with $44 +/- 
      119, respectively; for UGI procedures, $22 +/- 42 compared with $55 +/- 54,
      respectively); physician encounter costs ($66 +/- 40 compared with $86 +/- 38,
      respectively); and referral to specialist costs ($0 compared with $18 +/- 60,
      respectively). Patients receiving omeprazole also had more positive clinical
      outcomes than patients receiving H2RAs (78% compared with 49%, respectively),
      resulting in a more favorable cost of producing a successful outcome compared
      with patients receiving an H2RA. The cost of success was $407 for patients
      treated with omeprazole compared with $869 for patients treated with H2RAs. The
      findings of this analysis conducted under actual clinical conditions support
      findings of randomized clinical trials showing the cost-effectiveness of proton
      pump inhibitors.

TI  - Current management of gastroesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 24-32
AB  - Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a chronic condition that is very
      common, and may result in considerable morbidity as well as mortality (from
      complications). I present data on the therapy of patients with GERD and offer a
      practical approach to their management. The goals of management of GERD are
      relief of symptoms, healing of esophagitis, prevention of complications, and
      maintenance of remission. Simple lifestyle changes may control GERD in up to 20% 
      of patients. Promotility therapy addresses the pathophysiology of this disorder, 
      but the best results are only 50 to 60% control using cisapride, whereas the
      older agents (metoclopramide and bethanechol) are limited by side effects. Acid
      suppression using histamine receptor antagonists controls GERD in 50 to 60% of
      patients, whereas proton pump inhibitors offer the most effective control
      (80-100%). A surgical approach (especially using newer laparoscopic techniques)
      will provide effective therapy of GERD in a high percentage of patients, but
      further careful comparisons are needed to define the long-term efficacy and cost 
      issues associated with both surgical and chronic medical therapy of GERD. Despite
      this lack of long-term data, we know that GERD is a chronic, often lifelong
      illness, and maintenance therapy should be offered to most patients. This therapy
      may include aggressive medical therapy (up to and including chronic proton pump
      inhibitor therapy) or antireflux surgery in selected patients.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori augments the pH-increasing effect of omeprazole in patients
      with duodenal ulcer.
PG  - 725-32
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Omeprazole is less effective in healthy subjects than in
      patients with duodenal ulcers. The aim of this study was to determine whether
      Helicobacter pylori augments the pH-increasing effect of omeprazole in patients
      with duodenal ulcers. METHODS: In 16 patients with duodenal ulcers, baseline
      intragastric acidity was measured before and 4-6 weeks after the cure of H.
      pylori infection. In 17 patients with duodenal ulcers, 24-hour pH metry was
      performed during treatment with 20 mg omeprazole once daily before as well as
      after eradication of H. pylori. Intragastric acidity was measured using a glass
      electrode placed 5 cm below the cardia. H. pylori infection was assessed by [13C]
      urea breath test, culture, histology, and rapid urease test. RESULTS: H. pylori
      eradication resulted in marked decrease of the pH-increasing effect of omeprazole
      (24-hour median gastric pH, 5.5 vs. 3.0; P<0.002) that was most pronounced during
      nighttime (median gastric pH, 6.4 vs. 2.1; P=0.001). On the other hand, baseline 
      intragastric pH remained unchanged after eradication (median gastric pH, 1.0 vs. 
      1.1; P=0.5). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with duodenal ulcers treated with
      omeprazole, intragastric pH depends significantly on the presence or absence of
      H. pylori, whereas baseline pH remained unchanged after H. pylori eradication.

PG  - 622-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To integrate the realization that peptic ulcer most commonly reflects 
      infection with Helicobacter pylori or use of aspirin and other nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) into a disease management approach.
      PARTICIPANTS: Guidelines were outlined by the author and presented for review to 
      the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) Practice Parameters Committee,
      selected by the president of the ACG, and a panel of experts in peptic ulcer,
      selected by the committee. EVIDENCE AND CONSENSUS PROCESS: These guidelines were 
      formulated following extensive review of the literature obtained by MEDLINE
      search and presented for detailed review and revision to unpublicized committee
      meetings on three occasions and to experts by mail. These recommendations are an 
      official statement of the ACG and have been approved by the American
      Gastroenterological Association and the American Society for Gastroenterological 
      Endoscopy. Firm recommendations are discriminated from reasonable suppositions
      pending definitive data. CONCLUSIONS: Since cure of H. pylori infection decreases
      recurrence rates and facilitates healing, antibiotic therapy is indicated for all
      H. pylori-infected ulcer patients. No optimal, simple antibiotic regimen has yet 
      emerged. Simultaneous conventional ulcer therapy is recommended to facilitate
      symptom relief and healing. For refractory ulcers, only maximal acid inhibition
      offers advantage over continued conventional therapy; cure of H. pylori infection
      is likely to facilitate healing of refractory ulcers. Only with complicated or
      refractory ulcers should conventional maintenance therapy be continued, at least 
      until successful H. pylori eradication is confirmed. A search for NSAID use is
      indicated for all ulcer patients. For NSAID-associated ulcers these drugs should 
      be discontinued if possible and H. pylori, if present, should be cured.

TI  - Kinetic studies of Helicobacter pylori urease inhibition by a novel proton pump
      inhibitor, rabeprazole.
PG  - 182-7
AB  - Urease is an important virulence factor of pathogenicity of gastric Helicobacter 
      pylori. The inhibition of H. pylori urease by the novel proton pump inhibitor,
      rabeprazole, was investigated kinetically. It was found to act as an irreversible
      noncompetitive inhibitor of the enzyme. The inhibitory potency of rabeprazole was
      dependent on the pH of reaction mixture and its Ki values were 0.14 microM (pH
      5.0), 0.34 microM (pH 7.0) and 6.10 microM (pH 8.5). Progressive inactivation of 
      urease by rabeprazole initially proceeded according to pseudo-first-order
      kinetics with respect to the remaining enzymatic activity at pH 7.0 and 37
      degrees C, with a second-order rate constant of 0.0017 microM-1 s-1. When the
      inactivation half-life was plotted versus the reciprocal of the rabeprazole
      concentration, a straight line was obtained with a slope of -3.12. From an
      Arrhenius-plot of the temperature-dependence of the inactivation (over the range 
      of 5-37 degrees C), an activation energy of 13.2 kcal/mol was calculated.
      Recovery of activity was incomplete for H. pylori urease inhibited by
      rabeprazole, suggesting that the rabeprazole-urease complex is very stable.

TI  - Medical treatment of metastasizing carcinoid tumors.
PG  - 203-7
AB  - Long-acting somatostatin analogs, such as octreotide, comprise the therapeutic
      modality of choice for the symptomatic relief of flush and diarrhea in patients
      with carcinoid syndrome. The sequelae of gastric acid hypersecretion in patients 
      with gastrin-producing duodenal carcinoids (gastrinoma) are perfectly controlled 
      by proton pump inhibitors. Antiproliferative medical strategies to control the
      growth of metastatic carcinoid tumors include long-acting somatostatin analogs,
      interferon alpha, and the combination of the two. However, the success rate is
      less than 50%, and it is questionable whether true tumor regression can be
      expected. Controlled prospective studies are mandatory to address the question
      whether interferon or somatostatin analogs or the combination of the two should
      be used as first-line medical strategies and if hepatic artery embolization in
      patients with liver metastases should be performed before beginning medical
      therapy. Chemotherapy, including etoposide and cisplatin, has been shown to be
      effective only for purely differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas and not for
      slowly growing carcinoids.

TI  - A cost-effective approach to the patient with peptic ulcer bleeding.
PG  - 83-103
AB  - The average hospital cost to manage patients hospitalized at Virginia Mason
      Hospital who bleed from a peptic ulcer is approximately $5000 per patient in our 
      series of 30 patients. Because there are 150,000 admissions per year in the
      United States for peptic ulcer bleeding, the total hospital cost can be estimated
      to be $750 million. The actual cost may be higher because our 30 patients had
      minimal complications and were discharged on average in less than 4 days. The
      majority of hospital cost is incurred by the intensive care unit or the hospital 
      nursing floor. There is a close to linear relation between the length of stay and
      the total hospital cost. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is a major advance in
      the treatment of peptic ulcer bleeding. It can provide significant cost savings
      by identifying some patients with bleeding peptic ulcers who have clean bases on 
      endoscopy who are then eligible for prompt discharge from the hospital. In
      addition, endoscopic thermal therapy (with multipolar electrocautery or heater
      probe) and injection therapy cost less than $50 in incremental cost and can
      reduce further bleeding by 43%, reduce the need for urgent surgery by 63%, and
      reduce the mortality rate by 60%. Some patients still require urgent surgical
      intervention, which is substantially more costly than endoscopic hemostasis but
      is highly effective. Preliminary studies show promise in predicting further
      bleeding, with clinical scoring systems such as the Baylor Bleeding Score and
      with the use of Doppler ultrasonography. Better prediction of further bleeding
      should guide the choice of durable hemostasis early in the hospitalization.
      Additional studies should clarify the role of NSAID avoidance and H. pylori
      eradication in the long-term prevention of recurrent peptic ulcer bleeding.

TI  - Triple therapy with azithromycin, omeprazole, and amoxicillin is highly effective
      in the eradication of Helicobacter pylori: a controlled trial versus omeprazole
      plus amoxicillin.
PG  - 258-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: Azithromycin is a new-generation, acid-stable macrolide antibiotic
      that achieves remarkably high concentrations in gastric tissue, persisting above 
      the MIC90 for Helicobacter pylori over a 5-day period after a single 500-mg oral 
      dose. METHODS: We evaluated a new metronidazole-free triple therapy with
      omeprazole 20 mg b.i.d. plus amoxicillin 1 g b.i.d. (both for 14 days) and
      azithromycin 500 mg mane (for the first 3 days only) (group I) versus double
      therapy with omeprazole 20 mg b.i.d. plus amoxicillin 1 g t.i.d., both for 14
      days (group II). H. pylori status was determined by urease test and histology
      before and 6 wk after completion of therapy. RESULTS: Ninety-two patients with
      peptic ulcer disease or nonulcer dyspepsia completed the study. H. pylori
      infection was eradicated in 44 (91.6%) of 48 patients randomized to receive
      triple therapy versus 26 (59.1%) of 44 who received double therapy (p < 0.001).
      Smoking, but not omeprazole pretreatment, proved to be a risk factor for
      treatment failure only in the double-therapy group (p = 0.05). All ulcers healed 
      by the time of the 8-wk endoscopic control. Side effects, usually minor, were
      recorded in 12.5% and 9.1% of patients, respectively (NS), but therapy had to be 
      discontinued in one patient in group I and in three in group II (NS).
      CONCLUSIONS: Two-week triple therapy with omeprazole, amoxicillin, and (for the
      first 3 days) low-dose azithromycin is highly effective in eradicating H. pylori.
      This regimen is safe and well-tolerated, and we recommend that it be used as
      first-line treatment, as an alternative to less-effective omeprazole-amoxicillin 
      double therapy. Moreover, azithromycin appears to be a new, promising antibiotic 
      for future innovative anti-H. pylori combinations.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of treatment regimens for the eradication of Helicobacter
      pylori in duodenal ulcer.
PG  - 239-45
AB  - BACKGROUND: Eradication of Helicobacter pylori with antimicrobials was
      recommended by a recent NIH consensus panel for all infected patients with peptic
      ulcer disease. The precise regimen that should be used for eradication of the
      infection remains uncertain because of the variety of regimens described,
      variable results with the regimens, and difficulties in predicting drug
      compliance outside clinical trials. METHODS: A decision analysis tree was
      developed with three regimens that are widely used regimens for the eradication
      of H. pylori: 1) 2-wk triple drug therapy (metronidazole, bismuth, tetracycline
      with H2 receptor antagonist), 2) 2-wk omeprazole and amoxicillin, and 3) 2-wk
      omeprazole and clarithromycin. Traditional H2 receptor antagonist therapy was
      used for comparison. A 2-yr time period was chosen for study to allow sufficient 
      time for relapse and to evaluate its effect on the treatment strategy.
      Probabilities for eradication, compliance, and metronidazole resistance were
      determined from published data, and assumptions were tested by sensitivity
      analysis. RESULTS: Standard 2-wk triple drug therapy was the least expensive
      strategy ($720), and conventional H2 receptor antagonist therapy was the most
      expensive ($1791). Costs with 2-wk therapy with omeprazole and clarithromycin
      ($768) were lower than with omeprazole and amoxicillin ($1028). CONCLUSIONS:
      Treatment to eradicate H. pylori in infected patients with duodenal ulcer is a
      less expensive strategy than traditional therapy with H2 receptor antagonists.
      Triple drug therapy is the optimal regimen in areas where metronidazole
      resistance rates are < 36% and compliance is > 53%. Omeprazole and amoxicillin is
      not cost-effective unless eradication rates are greater than 74%. Dual drug
      therapy with omeprazole and clarithromycin is effective in regions where
      metronidazole resistance is high or where it is anticipated that there would be
      poor compliance with the more complicated triple drug therapy regimen.

TI  - Pathogenesis of gastric metaplasia of the human duodenum: role of Helicobacter
      pylori, gastric acid, and ulceration.
PG  - 452-8
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The pathogenesis of gastric metaplasia (GM) in the duodenum is
      unclear. The aim of this investigation was to study the effect on the extent of
      GM of ulcer healing, Helicobacter pylori eradication, and acid suppression singly
      and in combination. The relationship between GM and gastroduodenal inflammation
      and H. pylori infection density was also studied. METHODS: Duodenal and gastric
      antral biopsy specimens were obtained from H. pylori-positive patients with
      duodenal ulcer and from H. pylori-positive nonulcer subjects. Biopsy procedures
      from patients with duodenal ulcer were repeated after 6 months of treatment.
      Nonulcer subjects were treated symptomatically and did not undergo re-endoscopy. 
      RESULTS: Ulcer healing alone produced no change in GM or in gastroduodenal
      inflammation. H. pylori eradication produced a 42% reduction in GM and
      improvement in inflammation. Acid suppression produced a 43% reduction in GM but 
      without a significant change in inflammation. A combination of H. pylori
      eradication and acid suppression produced an additive effect with a 66% reduction
      in GM. A positive relationship was detected between the extent of GM and antral
      H. pylori density, duodenitis score, and antral gastritis score. CONCLUSIONS:
      This study shows that the extent of duodenal GM is unrelated to the presence or
      absence of ulceration but is partly due to H. pylori and partly due to acid.

TI  - Pooled analysis of anti-Helicobacter pylori treatment regimens.
PG  - 27-40
AB  - BACKGROUND: The human pathogen Helicobacter pylori and its association with
      peptic ulcer has dramatically changed the therapeutic approach to patients with
      this disease. Successful treatment of the infection has consistently been shown
      to prevent ulcer recurrence. Published data on therapeutic options are sometimes 
      confusing since only few studies have similar design, drug combinations, dosage, 
      dosing, formulation, patient material, and size. A formal meta-analysis is
      therefore of limited value. METHOD: Data on anti-H. pylori therapies from a large
      number of publications are pooled into a few groups based on the combination of
      drugs, regardless of dosage, duration, etc., of the therapy. A mean success rate 
      is calculated for all studies with subanalysis with regard to study design, size,
      doses and duration. RESULTS: Triple combinations are needed to achieve a success 
      rate of more than 80%. Bismuth/tetracycline based triple therapy gives 82%
      success rate (range 43-100%) compared to 85% and 87% success rate (range 72-100% 
      and 43-100%) achieved with omeprazole/clarithromycin based triples respectively. 
      CONCLUSION: Omeprazole/clarithromycin based triple regimens are the most
      effective anti-H. pylori therapeutic strategies, slightly superior to bismuth
      triple regimens.

AB  - With the introduction of long-acting somatostatin analogues, several advances
      have been made in the management of endocrine tumors. Octreotide was first used
      for the management of acromegaly and later used for metastatic
      gastroenteropancreatic tumors. Somatostatin receptor imaging has recently been
      introduced not only for the localization of somatostatin receptor-positive tumors
      but also for selection of optimal therapy. In addition to inhibitory effects on
      exocrine and endocrine secretion, octreotide has also been suggested to have
      antiproliferative effects manifested mainly by stabilization of disease and not
      tumor regression.

AB  - The majority of patients presenting with acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage
      bleed from peptic diseases erosive gastritis and duodenal or gastric ulcers.
      Early gastroscopy is essential in order to reach a diagnosis, assess the
      prognosis, and institute appropriate therapy. In a meta-analysis it was shown
      that H2-antagonists significantly reduced mortality. However, two large,
      prospective and placebo-controlled studies with famotidine and omeprazole failed 
      to show reduction of rebleeding or death. The value of endoscopic haemostatic
      therapy in patients with high-risk peptic ulcers (active bleeding and
      non-bleeding visible vessel) has been firmly established with 75% decrease in
      rebleeding and operation rate, and a 40% reduction in mortality. Risk factors for
      an adverse outcome are: elderly patients, concomitant diseases and large ulcers
      in the posterior duodenal bulb or on the lesser curvature. The mortality for
      emergency surgery in upper GI bleeding is still 10-50%. The mortality of elective
      operations is less than 2%. Some studies have reduced mortality by avoiding
      emergency surgery through early elective surgery in high-risk patients.

TI  - Pathogenesis and treatment of acid peptic disorders: comparison of proton pump
      inhibitors with other antiulcer agents.
PG  - 2-34; discussion 1
AB  - Acid peptic disorders, including gastric ulcers, duodenal ulcers, and
      gastroesophageal reflux disease, are commonly occurring conditions with high
      direct and indirect costs. The pathogenesis of these disorders involves an
      imbalance between acid secretion and gastric mucosal defenses. Pharmacologic
      treatment of acid peptic disorders has focused on correcting this imbalance by
      either improving mucosal defenses with drugs such as sucralfate, bismuth, and
      prostaglandin analogs, neutralizing acid with antacids, or decreasing acid
      secretion with histamine2 (H2)-receptor antagonists, or, more recently, proton
      pump inhibitors. Proton pump inhibitors are more potent inhibitors of acid
      secretion than H2-receptor antagonists. In clinical comparisons, proton pump
      inhibitors were shown to be more effective in the treatment of acid peptic
      disorders than H2-receptor antagonists. Helicobacter pylori infection is a factor
      in 85% to 100% of duodenal ulcers and 70% to 90% of gastric ulcers; eradicating
      this organism results in a considerable decrease in the recurrence of ulcers.
      Current management of peptic ulcer disease includes the use of combination
      antisecretory and antibiotic therapy for acute treatment of H pylori-associated
      disease. Patient self-medication with over-the-counter products, including
      H2-receptor antagonists, may have an impact on the potential for reducing the
      recurrence of peptic ulcer disease in patients with H pylori infection. Patients 
      with recurrent disease should be informed of the need to seek medical treatment
      through aggressive education at the point of sale for over-the-counter drugs.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori eradication--evaluation of triple therapy containing
      omeprazole.
PG  - 1-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a need to develop alternative regimen(s) for treating
      Helicobacter pylori infection because of problems of drug compliance,
      side-effects and resistance with the conventional regimen consisting of bismuth, 
      metronidazole and an antibiotic. AIMS: To compare prospectively the efficacy of
      conventional triple therapy (bismuth subcitrate 120 mg QID, amoxycillin 500 mg
      QID and metronidazole 400 mg TID for 2 weeks with one containing omeprazole (20
      mg OD), bismuth subcitrate and amoxycillin (regimen B). METHODS: Sixty two
      consecutive patients with H pylori infection associated with antral gastritis
      and/or duodenal ulcer were randomized to two treatment groups and re- evaluated
      after completion of 2 weeks of therapy and then after a further 4 weeks for
      eradication of H pylori, ulcer healing and drug side-effects. RESULTS: Regimen B 
      resulted in higher H pylori eradication rate as compared to regimen A (76.7% vs
      63.3%, better ulcer healing rate (90.9%, vs 70.6%), lesser side-effects (10.0% vs
      36.7%) and better drug compliance (100% vs 93.3%). The difference between the two
      regimens was significant (p < 0.05) only in respect to side-effects. CONCLUSION: 
      For H pylori eradication, omeprazole, bismuth and amoxycillin combination for 2
      weeks is as effective as the conventional therapy and is better tolerated.

AB  - The efficacy of omeprazole, 20 mg once daily, in suppressing Helicobacter pylori 
      colonization was studied in 33 patients with peptic ulcers. Omeprazole treatment 
      produced a significant fall in the number of H. pylori colony-forming units in
      the antrum. This finding, together with the results of a meta-analysis of
      clinical trials of H. pylori eradication therapy, suggests that combinations of
      omeprazole and antibiotics may be useful as eradication therapy in patients with 
      peptic ulcer disease and H. pylori infection.

      eradication of H. pylori (assessed histologically 4 weeks after the end of
      therapy) led to prompt and persistent suppression of gastritis activity, slow,
      partial regression of mononuclear inflammation and an ulcer recurrence rate of
      only 14% during the 6 months' follow-up. In patients treated with omeprazole and 
      placebo, or where eradication treatment with omeprazole and amoxycillin had
      failed, transient clearance of H. pylori from the antral (but not oxyntic) mucosa
      was seen. In both of these groups of patients transient regression in the antrum,
      and worsening in the corpus, of gastritis activity and mononuclear inflammation
      were evident, coupled with ulcer recurrence rates of 72 and 46%, respectively. It
      was concluded that H. pylori colonization and gastritis activity play a crucial
      role in ulcerogenesis, that acid inhibition treatment improves antral H. pylori
      gastritis and worsens the oxyntic mucosal gastritis, and that this can be
      prevented by eradication of the H. pylori infection.

TI  - Cure of Helicobacter pylori infection: role of duration of treatment with
      omeprazole and amoxicillin.
PG  - 98-100
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To date, some studies have suggested that short-term therapy may be a
      promising therapeutic concept for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori. The
      primary objective of the present study was to elucidate the role of the duration 
      of treatment in the cure of H. pylori infection. METHODS: Forty consecutive
      patients with H. pylori-positive peptic ulcer disease were randomly allocated to 
      four study groups. The groups were treated with a 14-day course of 20 mg
      omeprazole b.i.d. orally combined with 2 g amoxicillin t.i.d. intravenously for 1
      day (n = 10; six women, age range 40-84 yr), for 3 days (n = 10; five women, age 
      range 29-74 yr), for 5 days (n = 10; five women, age range 21-82 yr), for 7 days 
      (n = 10); five women, age 42-82 yr), respectively. Initially, a standardized
      clinical evaluation of symptoms and and upper GI tract endoscopy were performed
      for assessment of H. pylori infection of the gastric mucosa (biopsy urease test, 
      specific culture, and histology). At least 4 wk after cessation of omeprazole
      medication, H. pylori eradication was evaluated either as described or with the
      help of the 13C-urea breath test. RESULTS: H. pylori eradication, defined as
      negative bacterial findings in urease test, culture, and histology or 13C-urea
      breath test at least 4 wk after discontinuation of omeprazole therapy, was
      achieved in one of 10 patients (10%) in the one-day group, none of 10 patients
      (0%) in the 3- and 5-day groups and six of 10 patients (60%) in the 7-day group. 
      CONCLUSION: We conclude that short-term therapies with the proton pump inhibitor 
      omeprazole and the antibiotic amoxicillin must be considered completely
      ineffective if performed as a short-term therapy for up to 5 days. A therapy
      duration of 7 days seems to mark a turning point in antibiotic effectiveness,
      with a rapid increase in eradication rates.

TI  - Laparoscopic fundoplication in the treatment of severe gastroesophageal reflux
      disease: preliminary results of a prospective trial.
PG  - 60-4
AB  - To determine the technical feasibility and success of laparoscopic fundoplication
      in the treatment of severe gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), 18 consecutive
      adult patients were enrolled in a prospective study. All patients had received
      unsuccessful conservative treatment, were refractory to medical management, or
      had recurrence of symptoms of esophagitis after omeprazole therapy. All patients 
      had severe acid reflux on 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring, endoscopic evidence
      of previous or ongoing esophagitis, and a defective lower esophageal sphincter on
      manometry. Complete (Nissen) fundoplication was done in 11 and partial (Toupet)
      fundoplication in 7 patients; the mean operative time was 183 minutes (range, 120
      to 357 minutes). Feedings were initiated on the first postoperative day, and the 
      average length of stay was 2.6 days (range, 1 to 6). There were no deaths or
      conversions to laparotomy. Postoperative morbidity consisted of transient
      bloating in three patients and dysphagia requiring dilatation in four patients.
      Return to work or normal activity averaged 19 days (range, 3 to 28), and 17
      patients (94%) reported good to excellent results, with a median follow-up of 7
      months. Laparoscopic fundoplication is technically feasible and offers a sound
      surgical alternative to patients with refractory GERD, but longitudinal follow-up
      is required to confirm long-term results.

TI  - The effect of intrathecal opioid-receptor agonists on visceral noxious
      stimulation in rabbits.
PG  - 139-46
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Conflicting results have been published concerning the effects
      of different opioid-receptor agonists against visceral noxious stimulation. The
      introduction of colorectal distention facilitates research in this field. The aim
      of this study was to examine intrathecally administered opioid agonists against
      colorectal distention in conscious rabbits. METHODS: Rabbits were equipped with a
      subcutaneous intrathecal injection system. Colorectal distention was induced by
      inflation of a balloon inserted into the descending colon. The test parameter was
      the pressure eliciting a characteristic visceromotor response. Examinations were 
      performed before and after administration of the following drugs: morphine,
      U50488H, [D-Pen2, D-Pen5]enkephalin (DPDPE), naloxone, MR2266, naltrindole,
      saline, and acidified saline. RESULTS: The visceromotor response to colorectal
      distention was inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by intrathecal opioids
      acting as agonists at all three types of opioid receptors. Morphine was
      antagonized more effectively by intrathecal than intramuscular naloxone. U50488H 
      and DPDPE were equally antagonized by the specific antagonists MR2266 and
      naltrindole. Electrical thresholds in the lumbar region were increased, although 
      they remained unaltered in the cervical region after administration of all three 
      agonists. CONCLUSIONS: Intrathecal administration of different opioid agonists
      produces a dose-dependent spinal effect. The rank order of potencies in this
      model is DPDPE > U50488H > morphine > saline = 0.

TI  - Morning or evening dosage of omeprazole for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease?
PG  - 693-7
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: When routinely checking patients receiving omeprazole
      treatment for gastro-oesophageal reflux, we have been finding patients with
      surprisingly low nocturnal gastric pH. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
      impact of timing of the 40 mg omeprazole once daily regimen. METHODS: We
      evaluated the difference in effect of 40 mg omeprazole, given as a morning or
      evening dose, in 17 patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Gastric and 
      oesophageal pH was recorded by portable 24-h two-channel pH-metry in a cross-over
      design of 14 days of morning and 14 days of evening administration. RESULTS: In
      five patients pathological reflux was abolished by both regimens, four only
      during morning dosage, and three only during evening dosage. In the remaining
      five patients abolition of pathological reflux was not achieved. The therapeutic 
      outcome and patient preference for morning or evening administration were closely
      related to the individual oesophageal pH curves. Patients with reflux induced by 
      physical activity had a clear preference for morning dosage, patients with
      nocturnal reflux showed a clear preference for evening dosage. Gastric pH
      profiles showed a high inter-individual variation; paired statistics, however,
      revealed a significant impact of dosage timing on the gastric pH profile. After
      morning dosage the work-day part (the first 7 h) of the gastric pH profile is
      0.72 +/- 0.91 (mean difference of pairs +/- s.d.) higher than after evening
      dosage (P < 0.01). After evening dosage the gastric pH during the supine period
      is 0.64 +/- 0.83 (mean difference of pairs +/- s.d.) higher than after morning
      dosage (P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: The timing of a 40 mg omeprazole dosage regimen
      has a clinically significant impact on the 24-h pH profile, and that--by relating
      to the patient 24-hour oesophageal pH-metry in combination with the patient
      symptomatology--the timing of this dosage is highly important for therapeutic
      efficacy.

TI  - Only four days of quadruple therapy can effectively cure Helicobacter pylori
      infection.
PG  - 633-8
AB  - AIM: To determine whether 4 days of quadruple therapy using bismuth, tetracycline
      and metronidazole combined with omeprazole is effective treatment for
      Helicobacter pylori infection. METHODS: Non-ulcer dyspepsia, as well as chronic
      peptic ulcer patients with biopsy-proven H. pylori infection received 4 days of
      quadruple therapy. They were pretreated with 3 days of omeprazole. At least 5-6
      weeks later, endoscopy was repeated with 10 biopsies for urease test, histology
      and culture to establish cure of infection. RESULTS: None of the 54 patients
      included was lost to follow-up but two had a 14C-urea breath test instead of
      endoscopy. Side-effects did not interfere with compliance. Forty-nine out of 54
      patients (91%; 95% CI: 80-97%) were cured. Metronidazole susceptibility data were
      available from 43 pre-treatment isolates. Of these 38/40 (95%) with a
      metronidazole-sensitive strain, and one of three with a metronidazole-resistant
      strain were cured. CONCLUSIONS: Four days of quadruple therapy after omeprazole
      pre-treatment is a feasible, well tolerated, and effective treatment for H.
      pylori infection, especially in those carrying a metronidazole-sensitive strain. 
      It seems that in quadruple therapy, cure rate and treatment duration have a
      non-linear relation. Our results need confirmation, but for patients suffering
      from side-effects with the 7-day regimen stopping treatment after 4 days is
      justified.

TI  - One week treatment for Helicobacter pylori infection: a randomised study of
      quadruple therapy versus triple therapy.
PG  - 1085-8
AB  - This study evaluated one week of quadruple therapy as treatment for Helicobacter 
      pylori infection. Sixty duodenal ulcer patients were randomised to receive either
      standard triple therapy (tripotassium dicitrato bismuthate 120 mg
      qds+tetracycline 500 mg qds+metronidazole 400 mg qds), quadruple therapy A
      (triple therapy+omeprazole 20 mg od) or quadruple therapy B (triple
      therapy+omeprazole 40 mg od), for 7 days. H. pylori eradication rates were 65%,
      60% and 60%, respectively, with no significant differences between the groups.
      These results suggest that quadruple therapy provides no benefits over one week
      of triple therapy for treatment of H. pylori infection.

PG  - 1189-94
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and side-effect profile of two currently
      advocated treatment regimens for eradicating Helicobacter pylori. DESIGN: A
      randomized, controlled, open, single-centre study. SETTING: A community hospital 
      in The Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-six consecutive patients with (chronic)
      ulcer disease and biopsy-proven H. pylori infection, but without active
      ulceration at the time of inclusion. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly
      allocated to 1 week of quadruple therapy with omeprazole, bismuth, tetracycline
      and metronidazole (group 1) or 2 weeks of dual therapy with omeprazole and
      amoxicillin (group 2). Group 1 patients were pretreated with omeprazole for 3
      days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cure was confirmed by obtaining 10 endoscopic
      biopsies for urease testing, histology and culture 6 weeks after treatment.
      Side-effects were scored on a standard questionnaire. RESULTS: Three patients
      were lost to follow-up. In the 'intention to treat' analysis 37 (92.5%) of 40
      patients in group 1 were cured compared with 20 (55.6%) of 36 patients in group 2
      (P < 0.001). The difference in efficacy was 36.9% (95% confidence interval
      18.7-55.1%). Side-effects were fewer and milder in group 2, but all patients in
      both groups were able to complete the course of treatment. CONCLUSION: Dual
      therapy is significantly less effective in curing H. pylori infection in peptic
      ulcer patients than quadruple therapy. No patients were intolerant to either
      treatment. On the basis of the low efficacy of dual therapy, we believe that this
      therapy should not be used as a first-line treatment strategy. We confirmed our
      previous finding that 1 week of quadruple therapy is tolerated well and that it
      is highly effective against metronidazole-sensitive as well as
      metronidazole-resistant strains of H. pylori.

TI  - Prolonged treatment with omeprazole does not improve the eradication rate of
      Helicobacter pylori infection--a short report [corrected].
PG  - 619-20
AB  - Omeprazole has been shown to have a suppressive effect on Helicobacter pylori.
      The aim of this study was to determine if prolonged treatment with omeprazole
      would result in a higher eradication rate than short course treatment. Twenty
      patients with endoscopy proven duodenal ulcers and unequivocal evidence of
      Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection based on culture, histology, urease test and
      Gram's stain of a fresh tissue smear were treated with omeprazole 40 mg om for
      2-4 weeks. Following ulcer healing, patients received either maintenance
      omeprazole 20 mg om or placebo for up to one year. All 20 patients had healed
      ulcers following a 2-4 week course of omeprazole 40 mg om.. All were negative for
      HP at the end of treatment. Thirteen patients received short course therapy with 
      omeprazole only, followed by placebo. On follow-up endoscopy at 3 months, only
      one of 13 (7.7%) had eradicated the bacteria. Seven patients received maintenance
      treatment with omeprazole 20mg om for one year. Following completion of
      treatment, patients were followed up at 1, 3 and 6 months. Only one of 7 (14.3%) 
      patients had eradicated the infection on long term follow-up. The eradication
      rates of HP with both short and long course omeprazole monotherapy were low.

TI  - Comparative role of omeprazole in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux
      disease.
PG  - 1252-62
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and its treatment,
      with emphasis on the use and place of omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor. DATA
      SOURCES: A compilation prepared by the National Library of Medicine's Interactive
      Retrieval Services (Medlars II) for the period 1987 to 1994 was used as the data 
      source. STUDY SELECTION: Focus was placed on human comparative clinical studies
      with well-accepted measures of esophageal healing (endoscopy) and symptom
      resolution. Safety data were compiled from the clinical trials literature and
      large postmarketing data studies. Pharmacoeconomic studies selected were judged
      to meet the criteria of good design, presence of sensitivity testing, and
      statement of perspective. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were obtained from double-blind, 
      controlled clinical studies. Other data were extracted from pertinent literature 
      of good design and significant results. DATA SYNTHESIS: Overall, the clinical
      trials of omeprazole for the treatment of patients with erosive GERD demonstrate 
      that omeprazole provides superior therapy in terms of esophageal healing symptom 
      resolution and patient compliance when compared with histamine2-receptor
      antagonists (H2RAs) and antacids. In addition, studies also indicate that
      omeprazole is the most effective agent for the treatment of patients with GERD
      refractory to other treatments. Dosage adjustment is not necessary in patients
      with impaired renal or hepatic function or in the elderly. Finally, although the 
      acquisition drug cost for daily treatment of patients with GERD is highest with
      the use of omeprazole, pharmacoeconomic studies indicate that treatment is more
      cost-effective with the use of omeprazole than with H2RA or antacid treatment
      alone or combined with nonpharmacologic approaches. CONCLUSIONS: Based on
      efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness, omeprazole is the drug of choice for
      the treatment of patients with endoscopically confirmed erosive GERD.

TI  - Short- and long-term omeprazole for the treatment and prevention of duodenal
      ulcer, and effect on Helicobacter pylori.
PG  - 2172-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study analyzes the effect of short- and long-term omeprazole (OM)
      on duodenal ulcer healing, recurrence, and H. pylori status. METHODS: Patients
      affected by active duodenal ulcer were randomly allocated to treatment with OM 20
      mg or 40 mg once daily for 4 wk. Subsequently, patients with healed duodenal
      ulcer were randomly assigned to one of the following three groups: OM 20 mg once 
      daily for 12 months, OM 20 mg alternate days for 12 months, and no treatment.
      Endoscopy was performed at entry, at 4 wk, and after 4, 8, and 12 months. Two
      biopsy specimens from antrum, body, and fundus were taken for histology and
      search for H. pylori. One hundred and eighty patients with active duodenal ulcer 
      were admitted. Ninety-one were treated with OM 20 mg once daily and 89 with OM 40
      mg for 4 wk. RESULTS: The results at 4 wk show 92.8% patients healed with OM 20
      mg and 95.1% at 40 mg (NS). In the second part of the study, 96 of the patients
      who healed at 4 wk (45 with OM 20 mg, and 51 with OM 40 mg) entered the long-term
      study. Thirty-six patients received OM 20 mg daily for 12 months, 35 OM 20 mg on 
      alternate days for 12 months, and 25 patients no treatment. The results show a
      healing rate of 100%, 100%, and 95% with OM 20 mg daily, of 97%, 95%, and 93%
      with OM 20 mg on alternate days, and of 81%, 50%, and 40% (p < 0.01) with no
      treatment at 4, 8, and 12 months, respectively. H. pylori that was found in 97%
      of patients at entry, at 4 wk was found in 92.8% of patients treated with OM 20
      mg and in 97.5% of patients treated with OM 40 mg (NS). In one-third of the
      patients, H. pylori disappeared from the antrum but was found in the fundus. A
      30% reduction in the presence of H. pylori was seen in the group treated with 20 
      mg daily for 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that both continuous and
      alternate-day long-term OM treatment at 20 mg are similarly efficacious in the
      prevention of duodenal ulcer recurrence. Healing active duodenal ulcers with 20
      or 40 mg does not influence subsequent treatment. Long-term OM at 20 mg daily for
      12 months suppresses H. pylori temporarily in one-third of the patients. In these
      patients however, H. pylori reactivates after the end of treatment.

TI  - Optimal dose of omeprazole in combination with amoxicillin in eradicating H.
      pylori and preventing relapses in duodenal ulcer patients.
PG  - 842-6
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Triple therapy schemes, based on bismuth salts, eradicate
      H.pylori in a high percentage of duodenal ulcer (DU) patients. However, a simple 
      and effective regime with a low complication rate is desirable. Previous studies 
      have shown that the combination of Omeprazole (O) with an antibiotic (most
      commonly Amoxycillin [A]) is effective, but the optimal dose of O in this
      combination is not well defined. The aim of this study therefore was to address
      this subject. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The following four groups of patients were
      studied: group I (20mg O daily + 500mg A qid, n=18), group II (20mg O bid + 500mg
      A qid, n=17), group III (20mg O tid + 500mg A qid, n=18), group IV (20mg O qid + 
      500mg A qid, n=20). Patients were treated for two weeks with the above
      combinations. Endoscopy was performed four weeks after stopping treatment to
      check for H. pylori eradication and then one year later or when symptoms
      suggesting relapse occurred. RESULTS: Eradication rates were as follows; group I 
      6/18 (33.3%), group II 10/17 (58.8%), group III 15/18 (83.3%), group IV 17/20
      (85%). The highest eradication rate was achieved in group IV which was
      significantly higher (P<0.001) than in all the other groups except for group III.
      After treatment, there was a total of 48 H. pylori (-) and 25 H. pylori (+)
      patients in the four groups of patients studied. Relapse occurred in 20/25 (80%) 
      of the H. pylori (+) patients and in only 2/48 (4.16%) of the H. pylori (-)
      patients (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: a) The combination of Omeprazole and Amoxycillin
      is effective in eradicating H. pylori. It seems that in this combination 60 or
      80mg of Omeprazole is equally effective in achieving high percentages of
      eradication. Eradication of H. pylori with this regime prevents duodenal ulcer
      recurrence.

TI  - Lansoprazole capsules and amoxicillin oral suspension in the treatment of peptic 
      ulcer disease.
PG  - 1053-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lansoprazole is a potent antisecretory drug also possessing
      anti-Helicobacter pylori activity in vitro. It is a candidate drug for
      combination regimens with antibiotics for treating H. pylori infections. METHODS:
      In a semiblind study, 65 patients with duodenal and/or gastric ulcer and
      pathologic 14C urea breath test results were treated with either 60 mg
      lansoprazole every morning only for 14 days or combined with 500 mg amoxicillin
      oral suspension four times daily between meals, given for 11 days. Endoscopy and 
      breath test were repeated after 6 weeks and 6 months. Patients with unhealed
      ulcers were withdrawn. RESULTS: Eradication of H. pylori infection was attained
      in 46% of patients receiving lansoprazole and amoxicillin but in no patient
      receiving lansoprazole alone. Ulcers healed significantly more often in those who
      were H. pylori-negative (18 of 19 (95%)) than in those who were H.
      pylori-positive (20 of 41 (49%)). Adverse events, particularly stomatitis/sore
      throat and diarrhea, occurred significantly more often when amoxicillin was
      combined with lansoprazole. CONCLUSIONS: Lansoprazole eradicated H. pylori
      infection only when combined with amoxicillin. Eradication rates in this study
      are hardly acceptable, and further studies are necessary to define optimal doses 
      and duration of treatment. Using amoxicillin as an oral suspension may not be of 
      any substantial benefit and may cause stomatitis and sore throat.

TI  - A comparison of five maintenance therapies for reflux esophagitis.
PG  - 1106-10
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with reflux esophagitis have a high rate of relapse within
      one year after therapy is discontinued. METHODS: We enrolled 175 adults with
      endoscopy-confirmed reflux esophagitis in a prospective study comparing five
      maintenance therapies. All the patients were initially treated with omeprazole
      (40 mg orally once a day) for four to eight weeks, and healing was confirmed by
      endoscopy. Participants were then stratified according to their initial grade of 
      esophagitis and randomly assigned to 12 months of treatment with one of the
      following: cisapride (10 mg three times a day), ranitidine (150 mg three times a 
      day), omeprazole (20 mg per day), ranitidine plus cisapride (10 mg three times a 
      day), or omeprazole plus cisapride. Endoscopy was repeated after 6 and 12 months 
      of treatment; the endoscopists were blinded to the treatment assignments.
      Remission was defined as the absence of esophageal lesions on scheduled or
      unscheduled follow-up endoscopy. RESULTS: In an intention-to-treat analysis, the 
      numbers of patients in continued remission at 12 months were 19 of 35 (54
      percent) in the cisapride group, 17 of 35 (49 percent) in the ranitidine group,
      28 of 35 (80 percent) in the omeprazole group, 23 of 35 (66 percent) in the
      ranitidine-plus-cisapride group, and 31 of 35 (89 percent) in the
      omeprazole-plus-cisapride group. Omeprazole was significantly more effective than
      cisapride (P = 0.02) or ranitidine (P = 0.003), and combination therapy with
      omeprazole plus cisapride was significantly more effective than cisapride alone
      (P = 0.003), ranitidine alone (P < 0.001), or ranitidine plus cisapride (P =
      0.03). Ranitidine plus cisapride was significantly better than ranitidine alone
      (P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: For maintenance treatment of reflux esophagitis,
      omeprazole alone or in combination with cisapride is more effective than
      ranitidine alone or cisapride alone, and the combination of omeprazole and
      cisapride is more effective than ranitidine plus cisapride.

TI  - The cost effectiveness of Helicobacter pylori eradication versus maintenance and 
      episodic treatment in duodenal ulcer patients in Sweden.
PG  - 410-27
AB  - This study compares the cost effectiveness of Helicobacter pylori eradication and
      conventional treatment in duodenal ulcer patients treated by a general
      practitioner. Using a Markov chain approach, Swedish cost data and a study period
      of 5 years, we conclude that H. pylori eradication with omeprazole and
      appropriate antibiotics is a cost-effective alternative compared with both
      maintenance and episodic treatment. Of the patients entering the eradication
      strategy, most are cured and will have no relapse during a 5-year period. H.
      pylori eradication results in higher initial costs but, because of a very low
      risk of recurrence after successful eradication, the expected future costs are
      reduced. The investment pays off within 1 year when compared with maintenance
      treatment, and within 3 years when compared with episodic treatment.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori eradication: the best long-term prophylaxis for ulcer
      bleeding recurrence?
PG  - 622-5
AB  - Peptic ulcer is the most common cause of acute intestinal hemorrhage.
      Helicobacter pylori is now accepted as being a pathogenetic agent in chronic
      active gastritis, and is strongly associated with ulcer disease. Eradication of
      H. pylori reduces significantly the rate of ulcer recurrence. Preliminary data
      demonstrate that rebleeding did not occur in patients with complicated ulcers
      whose H. pylori infection had been eradicated. That this should be the case
      follows logically from the fact that, if ulcer relapses are eliminated, the
      associated hemorrhage must also be eliminated. Recent publications on this topic 
      are discussed in this review article.

PG  - 460-4
AB  - The pharmacokinetic interaction potential of the new proton-pump inhibitor
      lansoprazole and theophylline was assessed in a double-blind, two-period (13-day 
      duration per period), multiple-dose crossover study in 14 healthy male
      volunteers. Lansoprazole 60 mg or placebo once daily was coadministered with
      anhydrous theophylline 200 mg four times daily. Plasma theophylline
      concentrations were quantitated via high-performance liquid chromatography.
      Lansoprazole did not appear to affect substantially the absorption profile or
      clearance of theophylline. Theophylline area under the plasma
      concentration-versus-time curve over the 6-h dosing interval decreased slightly
      (13%) but statistically significantly during lansoprazole coadministration. As
      the magnitude of this effect was small, this interaction is likely to be
      clinically insignificant.

      suppression.
PG  - 571-4
AB  - AIM: To measure 24-h ambulatory oesophageal pH data in patients with
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease prior to, during and after acute treatment with
      comparable doses of omeprazole and ranitidine. METHODS: The subjects were 20
      adults with at least 8% acid contact time. Ten subjects were treated for 1 week
      with omeprazole 20 mg q.d.s. and 10 subjects with ranitidine 300 mg t.d.s. All
      subjects were examined at the end of 1 week of therapy and subsequent to
      cessation of treatment (1 day for ranitidine and 3 days for omeprazole). RESULTS:
      Both drugs produced a statistically significant (P < 0.05) decrease in acid
      contact time with acute treatment. Omeprazole produced a significantly greater
      decrease in acid contact time when compared to ranitidine. Subsequent to
      treatment cessation, the total acid contact time for omeprazole remained
      significantly less than the baseline level, while ranitidine returned to levels
      which were not significantly different from the baseline. CONCLUSION: These data 
      provide no evidence for a 'reflux rebound' subsequent to the cessation of acute
      acid secretory suppression.

TI  - A comparison of three doses of lansoprazole (15, 30 and 60 mg) and placebo in the
      treatment of duodenal ulcer. The Lansoprazole Study Group.
PG  - 521-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lansoprazole is a new proton pump inhibitor for the treatment of
      peptic ulcer disease. METHODS: A double-blind, multicentre study was undertaken
      in 296 patients with endoscopically proven duodenal ulcer to compare the efficacy
      and safety of lansoprazole 15, 30 or 60 mg with placebo. Ulcer healing was
      documented by endoscopy at 2 and 4 weeks; patients whose ulcers healed after 4
      weeks were followed for up to 6 months post-treatment. RESULTS: Four-week healing
      rates of 89.4%, 91.7% and 89.9% were obtained with lansoprazole 15, 30 and 60 mg,
      respectively, compared with 46.1% on placebo (P < 0.001). All three doses of
      lansoprazole produced rapid symptom relief, although patients taking 60 mg
      lansoprazole required fewer antacids than did those taking 15 mg. At 6 months,
      the percentages of patients healed were 45.3%, 40.0% and 38.4% in the
      lansoprazole 15, 30 and 60 mg dosage groups, respectively, and 25.3% for the
      placebo group. No significant adverse events were documented during the period of
      this trial. CONCLUSION: Lansoprazole is an effective and safe treatment for
      duodenal ulcer and the 15 mg dose is as effective as 30 or 60 mg.

TI  - Addition of metronidazole to omeprazole/amoxycillin dual therapy increases the
      rate of Helicobacter pylori eradication: a double-blind, randomized trial.
PG  - 513-20
AB  - AIMS: To compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of an
      omeprazole/amoxycillin (OA) dual therapy Helicobacter pylori eradication regimen 
      with an omeprazole/amoxycillin/metronidazole (OAM) triple therapy regimen.
      METHODS: In this double-blind trial, conducted in 19 hospitals, 119 patients with
      symptomatic duodenal ulcer disease were randomized to receive either 14 days
      treatment with omeprazole 40 mg daily, amoxycillin 500 mg t.d.s. and placebo
      followed by a further 14 days' treatment with omeprazole 20 mg daily (n = 59) or 
      14 days treatment with omeprazole 40 mg daily, amoxycillin 500 mg t.d.s., and
      metronidazole 400 mg t.d.s., followed by a further 14 days' treatment with
      omeprazole 20 mg daily (n = 60). H. pylori status was assessed by 13C-urea breath
      test at entry and at 4 weeks post-treatment. RESULTS: H. pylori infection was
      eradicated in 46% of the OA treated patients and in 92% of the OAM treated
      patients, a mean difference of 46% (P < 0.0001, 95% CI for the difference: +30 to
      +62). In only one patient was the duodenal ulcer not endoscopically healed after 
      4 weeks of treatment (OA 100%; OAM 98% healed). There were no significant
      differences in speed of symptom relief or improvement in symptoms between the two
      groups. Both regimens were well tolerated, with 96% of patients completing the
      course, and only one patient withdrawing due to an adverse event. The only
      side-effect with a significantly higher incidence in the OAM group was diarrhoea,
      which occurred in 36% of patients compared to 16% of patients in the OA group (P 
      < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A regimen consisting of omeprazole 40 mg daily, amoxycillin
      500 mg t.d.s. and metronidazole 400 mg t.d.s. for 14 days gives an appreciably
      higher H. pylori eradication rate than omeprazole and amoxycillin alone, with
      acceptable tolerability.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori eradication in a clinical setting: success rates and the
      effect on the quality of life in peptic ulcer.
PG  - 483-90
AB  - BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori eradication for peptic ulcer has been widely
      taken up. Evidence for the efficacy of different regimens is often derived from
      small series in clinical trials but there is little reporting of everyday
      practice with unselected patients. Freedom from ulcer relapse has been
      demonstrated, but not whether this equates with clinical success. METHODS: We
      report on a series of 706 patients with H. pylori infection who, between January 
      1991 and April 1995, received eradication therapy followed by assessment of H.
      pylori status. Two-hundred and seven of these patients were followed-up by postal
      questionnaire, validated by parallel questionnaires to their general
      practitioners, covering clinical outcome measures. RESULTS: The overall
      eradication rate was 81.7%, and a 1-week course of omeprazole plus two
      antibiotics was significantly better than a 2-week course of standard triple
      therapy (85.0% vs. 78.0%, P < 0.05). Amongst 21 first-time failures, a 7-day
      course of a clarithromycin-containing triple therapy succeeded in 18. The
      questionnaire replies indicate that, following successful H. pylori eradication, 
      ulcer patients are less likely to consult with ulcer symptoms (P < 0.0005), take 
      medication (P < 0.0005), require further prescription (P < 0.0005), or lose
      work-time because of their ulcer (P < 0.005). They are more likely to have a
      subjective sense of ulcer cure (P < 0.0005). CONCLUSIONS: In addition to clear
      cost savings, social benefits are now demonstrated when H. pylori is eradicated. 
      A well-tolerated 1 week regimen is genuinely effective in everyday practice.

TI  - The effects of short-term lansoprazole therapy on Helicobacter pylori infection
      and antral gastritis in duodenal ulcer patients.
PG  - 1824-8
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Lansoprazole is a new potent proton pump inhibitor that exhibits
      activity against Helicobacter pylori in vitro. This study endeavored to determine
      the effects of 4 wk of lansoprazole therapy upon H. pylori infection and antral
      gastritis in duodenal ulcer patients and to determine the relationship of the
      gastritis with Helicobacter infection and with ulcer activity. METHODS:
      Satisfactory antral biopsies were obtained from 119 duodenal ulcer patients
      before and after 4 wk of therapy with lansoprazole, ranitidine, or placebo.
      Sections were scored blindly for degree of active and chronic inflammation and
      extent of H. pylori infection. RESULTS: Four weeks of lansoprazole (30 mg daily) 
      or ranitidine (300 mg daily) therapy produced a significant decrease in H. pylori
      infection. The reduction of H. pylori infection, but not ulcer healing per se,
      correlated with the decrease in active and chronic antral inflammation. Reduction
      of H. pylori infection, however, did not improve the good ulcer-healing rates
      already achieved at 4 wk by potent acid inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: Lansoprazole
      exhibits activity against H. pylori in vivo. Short-term improvement in antral
      gastritis is affected by reduction of H. pylori infection but not by ulcer
      healing.

TI  - Omeprazole/amoxicillin versus triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori in duodenal 
      ulcer disease: two-year follow-up of a prospective randomized study.
PG  - 590-3
AB  - The present study was designed to compare the efficacy and tolerability of triple
      therapy and dual therapy for Helicobacter pylori in duodenal ulcer patients and
      to evaluate the long-term clinical course of ulcer disease. Forty duodenal ulcer 
      patients with proven H. pylori infection were enrolled into the study and
      randomly treated with either triple therapy consisting of bismuth subsalicylate, 
      metronidazole and tetracycline plus ranitidine or with dual therapy comprising
      omeprazole and amoxicillin. Patients were investigated clinically and
      endoscopically including assessment of H. pylori infection by means or rapid
      urease test, culture, histology and urea breath testing 4 weeks after cessation
      of eradication therapy, in 1-year intervals and when dyspeptic symptoms recurred.
      One patient of each group was lost during follow-up. H. pylori infection was
      cured by triple therapy in 84.2% and by dual therapy in 78.9% (p = 1.00). During 
      follow-up, all patients with cure of H. pylori infection (n = 31) remained in
      stable remission with respect to duodenal ulcer disease, while 6 out of 7
      patients persistently infected with H. pylori developed an ulcer relapse (p <
      0.001). One patient with cured infection had had an episode of dyspeptic symptoms
      requiring pharmacotherapy and in another 3 patients mild refluxesophagitis
      without necessity of medical treatment had been detected on the occasion of a
      scheduled endoscopy. In the short-term, cure of the infection resulted in a
      marked reduction of the degree of antral gastritis and in a loss of activity in
      all but one patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Empiric therapy for gastroesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 1808-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the absence of highly specific symptoms and without esophageal
      erosions, long-term pH monitoring is necessary for diagnosing gastroesophageal
      reflux disease. This method, however, is not generally available. OBJECTIVE: To
      determine whether gastroesophageal reflux disease can be diagnosed empirically by
      acid suppression in patients with normal results of endoscopy. METHODS: We
      studied 33 consecutive outpatients with pathologic findings on pH monitoring who 
      had symptoms compatible with gastroesophageal reflux disease and normal results
      of esophagogastroduodenoscopy, particularly a normal appearance of the esophageal
      mucosa. The severity of symptoms was graded on a visual analog scale from 1 to 10
      by the patient. The patients were treated for at least 7 days with either
      ranitidine, 150 mg twice daily (patients 1 through 10), omeprazole, 40 mg/d
      (patients 11 through 21), or omeprazole, 40 mg twice daily (patients 22 through
      33). A reassessment of symptoms and second pH monitoring were performed during
      the last day of treatment. RESULTS: Omeprazole, 40 mg/d, significantly reduced
      the severity of symptoms from 7.1 (range, 4 to 9) to 3.7 (0 to 8) and the reflux 
      measure mean acidity from 0.98 mmol/L (0.21 to 76 mmol/L) to 0.02 mmol/L (0 to
      0.47 mmol/L). Omeprazole, 40 mg twice daily, significantly reduced the severity
      of symptoms from 6.8 (3 to 10) to 0.6 (0 to 2) and the mean acidity from 0.38
      mmol/L (0.13 to 8.5 mmol/L) to 0.01 mmol/L (0 to 0.14 mmol/L). Both doses of
      omeprazole were superior to ranitidine, 150 mg twice daily. When a 75% reduction 
      of symptoms was defined as positive, the "omeprazole test" with 40 mg twice daily
      had a sensitivity of 83.3%, whereas the sensitivity with 40 mg/d was only 27.2%. 
      CONCLUSION: In practice, the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease can be 
      ruled out if symptoms do not improve with a limited course of high-dose proton
      pump inhibitors.

TI  - Effect of parenteral omeprazole and ranitidine on gastric pH and the outcome of
      bleeding peptic ulcer.
PG  - 103-6
AB  - The pharmacotherapy of bleeding peptic ulcer is directed at attempting to keep
      the gastric pH above the proteolytic range for pepsin. In this randomized,
      prospective, open clinical trial we have compared the effects and outcome of
      omeprazole versus ranitidine in patients with bleeding peptic ulcer. Of 219
      consecutive patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, 51 (23.2%) had an
      ulcer with endoscopic predictors of rebleeding at the time of diagnosis. These 51
      patients were selected at random to receive either omeprazole (80 mg bolus and 40
      mg/12 h i.v.) or ranitidine (50 mg/4 h i.v.). No endoscopic therapy was performed
      at the time of diagnosis. Twenty of these patients with duodenal ulcer (n = 10
      omeprazole, n = 10 ranitidine) underwent 24-h gastric pH monitoring. Both groups 
      were homogeneous in all clinical and endoscopic parameters. No differences in
      blood transfusion units, time of hospitalization, the lowest hematocrit measured,
      and mortality rates were observed between the groups. However, omeprazole reduced
      the number of rebleeding episodes (p = 0.1) and the need for surgery (3.8% vs.
      22.7%; p = 0.05). Omeprazole also reduced the amount of time the gastric pH was <
      6 (15.3 +/- 5.9% vs. 61.8 +/- 5.6%, p < 0.0001). We conclude that parenteral
      omeprazole is much more effective than ranitidine in keeping the gastric pH above
      the proteolytic range for pepsin in bleeders and that this might explain a better
      outcome in a subset of patients with bleeding peptic ulcers treated with
      parenteral omeprazole.

TI  - Non-bleeding visible vessel treatment: perendoscopic injection therapy versus
      omeprazole infusion.
PG  - 872-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: The non-bleeding visible vessel in a peptic ulcer is the highest risk
      factor for a bleeding recurrence among not actively bleeding lesions.
      Perendoscopic injection of sclerosing compounds is usually used as prophylaxis
      against rebleeding. METHODS: Forty-two patients with visible vessels in a peptic 
      ulcer at an emergency endoscopic procedure have been studied: 21 patients
      underwent prophylactic perendoscopic hemostasis, and 21 patients were infused
      with omeprazole intravenously. RESULTS: Eight patients (19%), four in each group,
      had early rebleedings (within 48 h after the enrollment). There was no
      significant difference between the two types of treatment. At the endoscopic
      control after 48 h there were significantly more lesions with higher risk of
      rebleeding (Forrest IIa and IIb) in the group treated with perendoscopic
      hemostasis. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that omeprazole infusion is a valid
      alternative to injection treatment of non-bleeding visible vessels.

TI  - Omeprazole in the long-term treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. A
      double-blind randomized dose-finding study.
PG  - 839-46
AB  - BACKGROUND: Omeprazole is effective in the treatment of reflux oesophagitis, and 
      it is important to determine the lower dose limit with still appropriate clinical
      efficacy. METHODS: Patients with endoscopic oesophagitis grade 1-4 (N = 220) were
      randomized to double-blind treatment with 20 mg or 40 mg omeprazole daily for 4-8
      weeks. Those healed after this initial treatment phase were re-randomized to
      double-blind treatment with 20 mg omeprazole daily (n = 67), 10 mg omeprazole
      daily (n = 68), or placebo (n = 33) for 6 months. Remission was defined as the
      absence of any endoscopic sign of oesophagitis. RESULTS: Healing rates were
      increased with 40 mg omeprazole, the therapeutic gain compared with the 20-mg
      dose being 15% after 4 and 8 weeks. The proportion of patients in remission after
      6 months was 59% with 20 mg omeprazole, 35% with 10 mg omeprazole, and 0% with
      placebo. CONCLUSION: Maintenance treatment with 10 mg omeprazole can prevent
      recurrence of oesophagitis in about one-third of patients with all grades of
      oesophagitis, and 20 mg omeprazole in about twice as many.

TI  - Efficacy and optimum dose of omeprazole in a new 1-week triple therapy regimen to
      eradicate Helicobacter pylori.
PG  - 835-40
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of a 1-week course of omeprazole,
      clarithromycin and tinidazole for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori and the 
      optimum dose of omeprazole required. DESIGN: The study was divided into two
      sequential phases. The first phase was an open, two-centre study. The second
      phase was a single-blind, single-centre study. METHODS: Patients found to be
      infected with H. pylori at endoscopy were enrolled in the study. In phase 1,
      patients were prescribed 20 mg omeprazole, 250 mg clarithromycin and 500 mg
      tinidazole twice daily for 1 week. In phase 2, all patients were prescribed 250
      mg clarithromycin and 500 mg tinidazole twice daily for 1 week. In addition,
      patients were randomly assigned to receive 20 mg omeprazole twice daily (group
      A), 20 mg omeprazole daily (group B) or no omeprazole (group C). Eradication was 
      assessed in all patients by 13C-urea breath testing 4 weeks after the completion 
      of therapy. RESULTS: In phase 1, H. pylori eradication was achieved in 132 (88%) 
      of 150 evaluable patients. In phase 2, eradication was achieved in 44 (88%) of 50
      individuals in group A, 47 (88.7%) of 53 in group B and 30 (63.8%) of 47 in group
      C. In the omeprazole groups, 22 patients harboured metronidazole-resistant
      strains of H. pylori and all were cured by the omeprazole regimen. One patient
      harboured a strain of H. pylori that was resistant to clarithromycin alone but
      which was successfully eradicated. Treatment failed in two out of three patients 
      harbouring H. pylori strains resistant to both clarithromycin and tinidazole.
      CONCLUSION: One week of omeprazole, clarithromycin and tinidazole is effective in
      eradicating H. pylori. There is no advantage in increasing the dose of omeprazole
      from once to twice daily. This regimen is effective in patients with
      5-nitroimidazole-resistant strains of H. pylori.

TI  - Triple therapy with sucralfate, tetracycline, and metronidazole for Helicobacter 
      pylori-associated duodenal ulcers.
PG  - 1424-7
AB  - Triple therapy with bismuth, metronidazole, and tetracycline or amoxicillin is
      effective for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori, but side effects are common. 
      Sucralfate inhibits H. pylori hemagglutinin, protease, and lipase and thus might 
      affect colonization of the bacterium in the stomach. OBJECTIVE: We compared the
      efficacy and side effects of triple therapy with sucralfate versus triple therapy
      with bismuth plus omeprazole in the treatment of H. pylori-associated duodenal
      ulcer (DU). METHODS: One hundred and fifty DU patients were recruited in this
      study; 71 cases were randomized to receive bismuth 120 mg q.i.d., metronidazole
      400 mg q.i.d., and tetracycline 500 mg q.i.d. (BMT) for 1 wk, and 79 cases were
      randomized to receive sucralfate 1 g q.i.d., metronidazole 400 mg q.i.d., and
      tetracycline 500 mg q.i.d. (SMT) for 1 wk. For the ulcer treatment, BMT patients 
      were also given omeprazole 20 mg daily for 4 wk, and SMT patients received
      sucralfate for 4 wk from day of randomization. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients in
      the BMT group and 60 in the SMT group finished the treatment and follow-up at 8
      wk. H. pylori was eradicated in 49 out of 53 (92%) patients in the BMT group and 
      in 45 out of 60 (75%) patients in the SMT group (p = 0.0057). Forty-nine (92%)
      patients who received omeprazole and BMT and 53 (88%) patients who received SMT
      had healed DU at 8 wk (p = 0.34). Side effects related to medication were
      reported in 38 (71.7%) patients in the BMT group and in 42 (70%) patients in the 
      SMT group. On an intention-to-treat basis, there was no difference in ulcer
      healing between the BMT group (93.1%) and the SMT group (89.7%). H. pylori
      eradication was achieved in 84.4 and 66.2% in the BMT and SMT groups,
      respectively (p = 0.018). CONCLUSION: Therapy of sucralfate, tetracycline, and
      metronidazole for 1 wk has a satisfactory but lower success rate in eradication
      of H. pylori when compared with the conventional triple therapy plus omeprazole. 
      Side effects of this therapy are no fewer than the conventional triple therapy.

TI  - Effect of triple therapy or amoxycillin plus omeprazole or amoxycillin plus
      tinidazole plus omeprazole on duodenal ulcer healing, eradication of Helicobacter
      pylori, and prevention of ulcer relapse over a 1-year follow-up period: a
      prospective, randomized, controlled study.
PG  - 1419-23
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Triple therapy and amoxycillin plus omeprazole are the two most
      widely recommended regimens for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori. However, 
      no controlled studies with a large number of cases are available for the reliable
      comparison of these two regimens. The aim of this controlled, randomized,
      prospective study was to compare the effect of these two regimens and a further
      regimen for metronidazole-resistant patients on duodenal ulcer healing, H. pylori
      eradication, and prevention of ulcer relapse. METHODS: Patients (n = 144) with
      proven duodenal ulcer (DU) were randomized to one of the three following
      regimens: group A, omeprazole (2 x 40 mg) plus amoxycillin (4 x 500 mg) for 2 wk;
      group B, triple therapy: bismuth nitrate (4 x 375 mg) plus metronidazole (4 x 250
      mg) and tetracycline (4 x 500 mg) daily for 2 wk and ranitidine (150 mg) for the 
      first week and bismuth nitrate (4 x 375 mg) alone for a further 2 wk; group C,
      omeprazole (20 mg) plus amoxycillin (4 x 500 mg) and tinidazole (2 x 500 mg) for 
      2 wk. RESULTS: A total of 46 patients in group A, 39 in group B, and 43 in group 
      C completed the study. One patient in group A and three in group B did not
      tolerate the regimens and dropped out of the study. Control endoscopy was
      performed 8 wk after the start of treatment and when symptoms appeared (up to 1
      yr after the start of treatment). In subjects who completed the study, both the
      healing rate of DU in group B (97% compared with 74 and 73% in A and C,
      respectively, p < 0.02) and the H. pylori eradication rate in group B (85
      compared with 35%, p < 0.0001 in A and 58%, p < 0.02, in C) were significantly
      higher than in groups A and C. The symptomatic ulcer relapse during the 1-yr
      follow-up in patients with initially healed ulcers was similar in all groups (18,
      16, and 19% in A, B, and C, respectively). The predictor of healing using
      logistic regression analysis was night pain (p < 0.05). The predictor of H.
      pylori eradication was sex (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The 2-wk triple therapy plus
      an additional 2-wk treatment with the bismuth derivative (without a prolonged
      administration of acid suppressing drugs) seems to be an effective and economic
      treatment not only for the eradication of H. pylori but also for the healing of
      acute DU. The higher incidence of side effects found after triple therapy
      compared with the other two regimens was tolerated by the patients.

TI  - Treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection with omeprazole-amoxicillin
      combination therapy versus ranitidine/sodium bicarbonate-amoxicillin.
PG  - 1411-4
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Simpler, effective therapies to treat Helicobacter pylori infection
      are greatly needed. Omeprazole co-therapy apparently enhances effectiveness of
      some antimicrobials. Our objective in this study was to determine whether the
      apparent additional benefit provided by omeprazole to amoxicillin therapy could
      be equaled by a high dose of ranitidine plus sodium bicarbonate. METHODS: In a
      prospective randomized trial, we tested 1 g amoxicillin b.i.d. with either
      omeprazole 20 mg b.i.d., or high dose ranitidine (900 and 1800 mg) plus sodium
      bicarbonate tablets 650 t.i.d. (with meals) for 14 day. RESULTS: Fifty-two
      patients with documented H. pylori infection and peptic ulcer completed therapy. 
      The cure rate with omeprazole and amoxicillin was poor (46%), with the 95%
      confidence interval (CI) = 25-67%. Ranitidine plus sodium bicarbonate was also
      poor (39% cure) with the 95% CI = 21.5-59% (p > 0.57). Average compliance was
      more than 92% for all three groups. Side effects were experienced in only two
      patients (stomatitis and mild diarrhea). CONCLUSION: Neither the omeprazole nor
      ranitidine plus bicarbonate plus amoxicillin therapies used here can be
      recommended for treatment of H. pylori infection.

TI  - A comparison of intravenous ranitidine and omeprazole on gastric volume and pH in
      women undergoing emergency caesarean section.
PG  - 797-800
AB  - We have compared the effect of intravenously administered omeprazole and
      ranitidine on gastric contents in a double-blind study in 80 consecutive women
      undergoing emergency Caesarean section. When the decision to perform emergency
      Caesarean section was made, patients were randomly assigned to receive either
      ranitidine 50 mg or omeprazole 40 mg intravenously. The volume and pH of the
      gastric contents were measured immediately after tracheal intubation and again
      before extubation. The gastric pH was found to be higher after omeprazole than
      after ranitidine immediately after intubation (5.89 +/- 1.46 and 5.21 +/- 1.36
      respectively) (P < 0.05) and before extubation (5.97 +/- 1.38 and 5.32 +/- 1.24
      respectively) (P < 0.05). However, the gastric volumes were comparable in both
      the groups. The number of patients with gastric volume > 25 ml and pH < 2.5 were 
      3 (7.5%) in the ranitidine group and 1 (2.5%) in the omeprazole group after
      intubation and none in either of the groups before extubation. We conclude that
      omeprazole 40 mg iv administered at the time of the decision to operate, results 
      in higher gastric pH than ranitidine in obstetric patients undergoing emergency
      Caesarean section.

TI  - Eradication of Helicobacter pylori and prevention of recurrence of duodenal
      ulcer: a randomized, double-blind, multi-centre trial of omeprazole with or
      without clarithromycin.
PG  - 417-23
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial treatment for Helicobacter pylori eradication is
      currently recommended for all patients with duodenal ulcer disease, but consensus
      on the best treatment is lacking. METHODS: Patients with active duodenal ulcer
      and H. pylori were enrolled in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled
      multi-centre study. Patients received omeprazole 40 mg daily for 28 days and
      either clarithromycin 500 mg t.d.s. or placebo t.d.s. for the first 14 days.
      Patients underwent endoscopy before starting treatment, at 2 weeks, immediately
      after stopping treatment if unhealed at 2 weeks, and at 1, 6 and 12 months after 
      the end of treatment, or at the recurrence of symptoms. Eradication of H. pylori,
      duodenal ulcer healing and ulcer recurrence were measured. RESULTS: One-hundred
      and fifty-four patients were recruited and randomized to omeprazole plus
      clarithromycin (n = 74) or to omeprazole plus placebo (n = 80). One month after
      treatment, H. pylori was eradicated in 57 of 69 (83%; 95% CI: 72-91%) patients
      receiving omeprazole plus clarithromycin, compared with 1 of 75 (1%; 95% CI:
      0-7%) receiving omeprazole alone (P < 0.001). In patients receiving omeprazole
      plus clarithromycin the ulcer healed at 2 weeks in 83% (95% CI: 71-91%) and at 4 
      weeks in 100% (95% CI: 95-100%), compared with 77% (95% CI: 66-86%) and 97% (95% 
      CI: 91-100%) in those given omeprazole plus placebo (N.S.). Ulcers recurred at 12
      months in 6% (95% CI: 1-16%) of patients given omeprazole plus clarithromycin,
      compared with 76% (95% CI: 63-86%) of patients given omeprazole plus placebo (P <
      0.001). The incidence of side-effects was similar in both treatment groups (38%
      with clarithromycin dual therapy and 29% with omeprazole plus placebo; P =
      0.304). Ninety per cent of patients took at least 90% of their prescribed
      medication. CONCLUSIONS: Omeprazole plus clarithromycin dual therapy eradicated
      H. pylori in 83% of patients with duodenal ulcer and significantly decreased
      12-month recurrence from 76% to 6%.

TI  - Comparison of pantoprazole versus omeprazole in the treatment of acute duodenal
      ulceration--a multicentre study.
PG  - 411-6
AB  - METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, multicentre study, the proton pump
      inhibitors pantoprazole and omeprazole were compared in patients with active
      duodenal ulcers. Two hundred and seventy-six protocol-correct patients received
      either pantoprazole 40 mg (n = 185) or omeprazole 20 mg (n = 91), once daily for 
      2 or 4 weeks, depending on the progress of ulcer healing. RESULTS: Rates of
      complete ulcer healing after 2 weeks were 71% in patients given pantoprazole and 
      74% in patients given omeprazole. After 4 weeks the figures were 96% and 91%,
      respectively. These differences were not significant. There was no significant
      difference in ulcer pain prior to treatment, and 85% of the pantoprazole group
      and 86% on omeprazole were pain-free after 2 weeks (not significant). The time
      until complete pain relief with pantoprazole or omeprazole, based on data from
      diary cards, was not significantly different (P > 0.05, Uleman's U-test). Both
      treatments were equally well tolerated. Changes in routine laboratory parameters 
      were minimal in both groups. CONCLUSION: Pantoprazole was shown to be a
      highly-effective and well-tolerated treatment for acute duodenal ulcer.
      Pantoprazole 40 mg and omeprazole 20 mg were equally effective with respect to
      ulcer healing and pain relief, and have similar adverse event profiles.

TI  - Review article: the continuing development of proton pump inhibitors with
      particular reference to pantoprazole.
PG  - 363-78
AB  - Inhibition of the gastric proton pump is gaining acceptance as the treatment of
      choice for severe gastrooesophageal reflux disease, and for treatment of duodenal
      and gastric ulceration. Three of these drugs are now available (omeprazole,
      lansoprazole and pantoprazole) and more are being developed. Proton pump
      inhibitors share the same core structure, but differ in terms of substituents on 
      this core. The substitutions are able to modify some important chemical
      properties of the compounds. For example, pantoprazole is significantly more
      acid-stable than omeprazole or lansoprazole. E3810 is significantly less stable
      than the other compounds. We present an explantation for this finding that
      depends on the relative pK values for the pyridine and benzimidazole nitrogens,
      especially the former. Pantoprazole formulated in an enteric-coated tablet
      displays high bioavailability and linear pharmacokinetics whether on single or
      multiple dose regimens. Although all three proton pump inhibitors provide a
      similar chemical conversion to sulphenamides, which are highly reactive cysteine 
      reagents, these reagents derivatize different cysteines in the extracytoplasmic
      or membrane domain of the pump and inhibit the pump at different rates. Whereas
      the differences in chemical reactivity can be explained by the solution chemistry
      of the compounds, selective derivatization of different cysteines on the protein 
      argues for an involvement of pump structure in response to the presence of the
      proton pump inhibitor on its luminal surface. This suggests that the proton pump 
      inhibitors, which were originally designed to take advantage of only the highly
      acidic space generated in the parietal cell by the production of the
      sulphenamide, are made even more selective by the protein they target.
      Pantoprazole is metabolized by a combination of phase I and phase II metabolism, 
      and has also been shown to have a very low potential for drug interaction.
      Studies of acid secretion in man have shown this compound to be an effective and 
      long lasting inhibitor of acid secretion. The pharmacodynamics explain the
      cumulative effect of repeated doses and maximal acid secretory capacity with a
      once daily dosage.

TI  - Comparison of once daily doses of lansoprazole (15, 30, and 60 mg) and placebo in
      patients with gastric ulcer.
PG  - 1289-94
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A multicenter, double-blind study was conducted in 268 patients to
      compare the safety and efficacy of 15, 30, and 60 mg of lansoprazole and placebo 
      in the treatment of gastric ulcer. METHODS: The study included an 8-wk treatment 
      period to assess healing and a 6-month posttreatment period to evaluate ulcer
      recurrence. Endoscopies were performed, GI symptoms and antacid use were
      assessed, and safety evaluations were conducted, including serum gastrin and
      biopsies of the lesions and the greater curvature of the stomach. RESULTS: At
      week 4, healing rates were significantly higher with lansoprazole 15 and 30 mg
      (64.6 and 58.1%, respectively) compared with placebo (37.5%). By week 8, healing 
      rates were 76.7% with placebo, 92.2% with 15 mg of lansoprazole, 96.8% with 30
      mg, and 93.2% with 60 mg of lansoprazole (p < 0.05). The drug was well tolerated,
      with no significant differences from placebo in the incidence of adverse events. 
      Fasting serum gastrin increased in all lansoprazole groups, reaching a plateau by
      week 2 and returning to baseline levels by month 1 posttreatment. No significant 
      increase in Grimelius-positive cells or inflammation was evident. All but two
      patients had normal gastric morphology evaluated by Solcia classification.
      CONCLUSIONS: Lansoprazole, 15, 30, and 60 mg, administered once daily before
      eating, healed gastric ulcers to an approximately equal degree, and all were
      significantly better than placebo.

TI  - The rationale for continuous maintenance treatment of reflux esophagitis.
PG  - 1465-71
AB  - Reflux esophagitis is a chronic process associated with frequent episodes of
      relapse in many patients. In addition, the disease may be progressive in at least
      some patients. Erosion of the esophageal mucosa precedes the development of some 
      of the complications of the condition. There is accumulating evidence that
      continuous treatment of patients with erosive esophagitis effectively maintains
      symptomatic remission and absence of esophageal erosions. Whether such treatment 
      will prevent the development of complications has not yet been demonstrated. We
      investigated a number of questions concerning the natural history and
      complications of erosive esophagitis and the need for maintenance treatment for
      patients with severe manifestations of disease as well as the impact of
      continuous maintenance treatment on the natural history of reflux esophagitis and
      its complications.

TI  - Cost and quality effects of treating erosive oesophagitis. A re-evaluation.
PG  - 139-46
AB  - The objective of this study was to re-evaluate the clinical and economic effects 
      of common therapies for erosive oesophagitis in the light of a newly approved
      treatment regimen. A previously constructed 7-month community practice decision
      analytical model was revised to include the latest published data on efficacy and
      symptomatic outcomes. The original results of phase I therapy (antacids plus
      dietary, sleeping and lifestyle changes) alone or combined with ranitidine 150mg 
      bid or omeprazole 20mg od were reassessed by adding new clinical data on the
      efficacy of and symptomatic response to ranitidine 150mg qid. The same payment
      data used in the first analysis were applied here as well, with the addition of
      the US price of ranitidine 150mg qid. The study perspective was that of the payer
      or insurer. Omeprazole-based therapy remained a dominant strategy for symptomatic
      care during the 7-month model. It was 14% less costly per patient, led to 23%
      fewer symptomatic months, and had 21% lower cost per symptom-free month than
      ranitidine 150mg qid, the next best alternative. Evolving treatment strategies
      necessitate rapid assessment and reassessment so that clinical practice can
      remain current, patients can be assured of the best quality, and insurers can be 
      aware of treatment cost and budgetary impact given limited resources in all
      countries. Only by consistent and continuous re-evaluation of new or changing
      medical interventions can clinicians and insurers adapt patient management to new
      scientifically derived results. This is the best manner by which to meet
      patients' care needs and the clinical needs of practitioners, as well as the
      financial needs of payers.

TI  - Meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials comparing lansoprazole with
      ranitidine or famotidine in the treatment of acute duodenal ulcer.
PG  - 661-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim was to compare the clinical efficacy of lansoprazole with the 
      efficacies of ranitidine and famotidine in order to rank this drug in the
      hierarchy of duodenal ulcer treatments. METHODS: All randomized clinical trials
      in which lansoprazole was used to treat patients with duodenal ulceration were
      reviewed. The meta-analysis included a quality assessment for each trial. The
      main criterion chosen for the meta-analysis was the endoscopic healing rate at 4 
      weeks; other criteria were the healing rate at 2 weeks and the absence of pain at
      2 and 4 weeks. Statistical methods used were the Der Simonian and Laird method
      and the method of Peto et al. A sensitivity analysis was performed according to
      the H2 blocker type (famotidine or ranitidine). Odds ratios against
      histamine-receptor blockers were used to compare lansoprazole indirectly with
      omeprazole and other drugs. RESULTS: Five double-blind trials were identified
      including 848 patients. The mean 4-week healing rate in patients treated with
      lansoprazole was 85%, which was significantly higher than the healing rate in
      patients treated with H2-receptor blockers (75%). This difference of 10% was
      significant (P < 0.01) according to the Der Simonian method, and the
      corresponding odds ratio of 2.27 (95% confidence interval 1.5-3.2) was
      significant according to the Peto method (P < 0.01). There was also a significant
      difference in favour of lansoprazole for 2-week healing rates (mean difference
      20%, P < 0.01) and for the percentage of patients without pain at 2 weeks (mean
      difference 8%; P < 0.02). Indirect comparisons of 4-week healing rates showed no 
      difference between 30 mg lansoprazole and 20 mg omeprazole and confirmed that
      both drugs had a greater efficacy than ranitidine, famotidine, nizitidine,
      cimetidine or sucralfate. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis showed that 30 mg
      lansoprazole was more effective in producing healing at 2 and 4 weeks than
      ranitidine or famotidine. Lansoprazole also led to a greater reduction in the
      percentage of patients free of pain at 2 weeks. The efficacy of lansoprazole was 
      not different from that of omeprazole.

TI  - Intragastric acidity as a predictor of the success of Helicobacter pylori
      eradication: a study in peptic ulcer patients with omeprazole and amoxicillin.
PG  - 39-43
AB  - Omeprazole plus amoxicillin cures Helicobacter pylori infection. The hypothesis
      was tested that low acidity is a predictor of outcome. Fifty patients with
      relapsing or complicated, or both H pylori positive duodenal (n = 25) or gastric 
      ulcer (n = 25) were randomly treated with either omeprazole 20 mg twice daily
      plus amoxicillin 1 g twice daily or with omeprazole 40 mg twice daily plus
      amoxicillin 1 g twice daily over two weeks. After one week of combined treatment,
      a 24 hour gastric pH measurement was performed in all patients. H pylori cure
      rate was 67%. Patients who later turned out to be cured had higher pH values
      during night time and after meals (p < 0.05). In an explorative analysis drug
      compliance, smoking, location of the ulcer (duodenum versus stomach), age, and
      grade of body gastritis were additional predictors of the outcome. Smoking (p =
      0.006), compliance (p = 0.037), duodenal ulcer disease (p = 0.065), and young age
      (p = 0.021) were related to high acidity. In conclusion, the success of
      eradication treatment with omeprazole and amoxicillin in ulcer patients infected 
      with H pylori depends on intragastric pH. Drug compliance, smoking habits,
      location of ulcer, age, and activity of body gastritis are other predictors and
      in part related to intragastric acidity.

TI  - Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication is a satisfactory alternative to long-term
      omeprazole therapy.
PG  - 938-42
AB  - A total of 168 patients with proven gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)
      receiving long-term medical therapy underwent laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication.
      The operation was converted to open fundoplication in four patients. All patients
      reported complete (92.3 per cent) or partial (7.7 per cent) relief of reflux
      symptoms 1 month after surgery. There were no associated deaths and the
      perioperative complication rate was 8.9 per cent. The mean(s.e.m.) length of
      operating time was 69.9(2.4) min and mean(s.e.m.) hospital stay 2.7(0.1) days.
      Symptom score assessment, 24-h oesophageal pH recording and lower oesophageal
      sphincter pressure showed significant (P < 0.0001) improvement 6 months after
      surgery in 85 evaluable patients. Before operation 37.5 per cent of the patients 
      were considered symptomatically controlled on omeprazole and had excellent
      symptom control after surgery. This initial experience suggests that laparoscopic
      Nissen fundoplication is a safe and effective treatment for patients with GORD
      requiring long-term medication.

TI  - [Treatment of acute peptic gastroduodenal ulcer: omeprazole is superior to
      ranitidine especially in the early phase of ulcer healing. A prospective
      controlled randomized serial endoscopy study].
PG  - 165-70
AB  - Omeprazole (OM) has been shown to be superior to H2-Blockers in terms of complete
      healing rates of gastric (GU) and duodenal ulcers (DU). We investigated in more
      detail the kinetics of ulcer healing under OM (20 mg mane) compared with
      ranitidine (RAN 300 mg nocte) in GU (n = 28) and DU (n = 27) by multiple series
      endoscopy. After endoscopic diagnosis (day 0) patients were allocated to either
      OM or RAN in a random order. Endoscopic controls were undertaken at day (d) 3, 7,
      14, 21, 28, 42 up to complete ulcer healing. The seize of ulcer areas was
      assessed by independent endocopists estimating the longest and shortest diameter 
      D acc. to the formula A = pi x D1 x D2:4. Results: In GU and DU cumulating
      healing rates were sign, higher under OM. In GU and DU, the most striking
      differences in the absolute and percentual reduction of ulcer seize in favour of 
      OM vs RAN were observed mainly during the first week. At d3 under OM the
      reduction in DU-area was 43% and at d7 75% compared to a distinctly lower rate
      under RAN with the corresponding figures of 9% and 61% resp. In GU the mean
      reduction in area was for IM at d3 41%, at d7 82% in contrast to RAN at d3 of 34%
      and d7 of 49%. The faster healing during the first week was accompanied by sign
      more rapid reduction in day-and-night-painscore during OM vs RAN.(ABSTRACT

AB  - Upper-gastrointestinal bleeding may be related to tension or fear, which are
      commonly aggravating factors in digestive diseases. A survey was made of patients
      living in and around Hadera (located in Israel's central coastal region) during
      the Gulf War (January 18 through February 28, 1991) who suffered from
      upper-gastrointestinal bleeding; they were compared with patients seen during
      1990 and 1992-1993 at the same time of the year. We found no appreciable
      difference in the rate of upper-gastrointestinal bleeding during the analogous
      periods covered in the survey.

TI  - A double-blind study of pantoprazole and omeprazole in the treatment of reflux
      oesophagitis: a multicentre trial.
PG  - 321-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pantoprazole is a new substituted benzimidazole which is a potent
      inhibitor of gastric acid secretion by its action upon H+,K(+)-ATPase. AIM: To
      compare pantoprazole 40 mg with omeprazole 20 mg as once daily dosing in the
      treatment of reflux oesophagitis (grades II and III). METHODS: This double-blind,
      randomized, multicentre study included 286 patients. Patients were reendoscoped
      after 4 weeks, and continued to receive a further 4 weeks of treatment if they
      were not healed at this time. RESULTS: After 4 weeks of treatment, complete
      healing occurred in 126/170 (74%) patients in the pantoprazole group and in 67/86
      (78%) patients in the omeprazole group (per-protocol analysis). At 8 weeks, the
      corresponding healing rates were 153/170 (90%) and 81/86 (94%). The differences
      between the treatment groups were not significant (P = 0.57 and 0.34).
      Improvement in the principal symptoms of reflux oesophagitis was also very
      similar between the treatment groups, with 59% and 69% at 2 weeks, and 83% and
      86% at 4 weeks, respectively, being free from any individual symptom. Both
      treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown pantoprazole
      and omeprazole to be similarly effective and well tolerated in the treatment of
      mild to moderate reflux oesophagitis.

TI  - Treatment and prevention of relapse of mild oesophagitis with omeprazole and
      cisapride: comparison of two strategies.
PG  - 281-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oesophagitis is usually a chronic condition. Healing with omeprazole 
      is often followed by early relapse. Combination treatment and subsequent
      maintenance treatment with the prokinetic cisapride may be of benefit in relapse 
      prevention. METHODS: Patients with endoscopically proven oesophagitis, grade I (n
      = 120) or grade II (n = 105), were randomized in an open fashion to receive 8
      weeks of healing treatment with omeprazole 20 mg daily (OM) followed by 12 months
      of follow-up without maintenance treatment, or 8 weeks of combined treatment of
      omeprazole 20 mg daily plus cisapride 5 mg t.d.s. (OMCIS) followed by 12 months
      of maintenance treatment with cisapride 5 mg t.d.s. (CIS). Only the patients
      healed after acute treatment were included in the 12-month follow-up study for
      evaluation of endoscopic relapse. RESULTS: In the group of patients with
      oesophagitis grade I (n = 58 receiving OM, n = 62 receiving OMCIS), healing rates
      were comparable for both acute treatment regimens. In the group of patients with 
      grade II (n = 54 receiving OM, n = 51 receiving OMCIS), the healing rates were
      slightly but not significantly in favour of OMCIS after 4 and 8 weeks of
      treatment. During the 12 months of follow-up, CIS maintenance treatment was
      associated with a significant reduction of relapse. In the group of patients with
      initial grade I oesophagitis, the relapse rates after 3 months were 20% in the
      OMCIS group receiving CIS maintenance treatment, compared to 48% in the group
      healed on OM without further maintenance treatment (P = 0.04). After 6 months,
      these relapse rates were 31% and 85% respectively (P < 0.001), and after 12
      months 40% and 96% (P < 0.001). In the group of patients with initial grade II
      oesophagitis, they were, respectively, 20% vs. 39% after 3 months (P = 0.056),
      41% vs. 78% after 6 months (P < 0.001) and 52% vs. 95% after 12 months (P <
      0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this open study indicate that continued
      treatment with cisapride 5 mg t.d.s. (after initial healing with omeprazole 20 mg
      daily plus cisapride 5 mg t.d.s.) is beneficial in the long-term management of
      grade I and II oesophagitis: this treatment approach significantly reduces the
      high relapse rate observed after stopping healing treatment with omeprazole.

AB  - AIM: To perform a further Cox proportional hazards logistic regression analysis
      of data from two large-scale placebo-controlled trials with cisapride as
      maintenance treatment in reflux disease. RESULTS: Analysis of each of the two
      databases, allowing the model to operate freely, led to the identification of a
      number of unexpected putative predictors of outcome in the 6 to 12 months
      following initial healing of oesophagitis with an H2-receptor antagonist or
      omeprazole. This allowed us to delineate more accurately the patient population
      that is likely to respond to long-term continuous treatment with low or standard 
      dose cisapride. The analysis revealed that symptom severity may be more useful
      than endoscopic severity in predicting relapse or in guiding therapy. Reflux
      oesophagitis outcome is particularly poor in the presence of
      treatment-recalcitrant symptoms or severe mucosal damage. Analysis showed
      cisapride to be effective in the maintenance treatment of patients with
      non-refractory symptoms, irrespective of the initial severity of oesophagitis,
      the healing agent used, or a history of previous endoscopic relapses.

TI  - Treatment of Helicobacter pylori infections.
PG  - 369-89
AB  - The available literature on the relationship between several diseases and
      Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is reviewed. Duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer,
      complicated peptic ulcer, abdominal symptoms and gastroduodenal mucosal damage
      during the use of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), non-ulcer
      dyspepsia (NUD) and gastric malignancy are discussed. The case for and against
      eradication is critically discussed. Eradication of H. pylori should be pursued
      in all patients with peptic ulcer disease, whether they are using NSAIDs or not. 
      Eradication of H. pylori in the treatment of NUD should be considered
      experimental. Treatment aimed at the eradication of H. pylori should be
      considered in all patients with low-grade malignant mucosa-associated lymphoid
      tissue (MALT) lymphoma and in all patients with Menetrier's disease. Finally,
      this treatment should be considered in a subset of H. pylori-infected patients
      who possibly are at an increased risk of gastric cancer: patients with a strong
      family history of gastric carcinoma and patients in need of long-term treatment
      with a proton-pump inhibitor. In view of the importance of patient compliance,
      the risk of side-effects and the possibility of inducing metronidazole resistance
      when treatment with a metronidazole-containing regimen is used, treatment aimed
      at the eradication of H. pylori should be carefully implemented and monitored.

TI  - Omeprazole-amoxycillin therapy for eradication of Helicobacter pylori in duodenal
      ulcer bleeding: preliminary results of a pilot study.
PG  - 319-21
AB  - Thirty-five patients with duodenal ulcer bleeding and Helicobacter
      pylori-colonization were assigned to receive 2 x 20 mg omeprazole and 3 x 750 mg 
      amoxycillin daily for 2 weeks. Eradication was defined as no evidence of H.
      pylori infection by urease test and by histology 4 weeks after completion of
      therapy. Two patients were lost to follow up. All ulcers healed completely (100% 
      ulcer healing rate). Twenty-nine out of the 33 patients were H. pylori-negative
      (87.9% eradication rate). Three patients complained of typical side effects of
      amoxycillin (9.1% side effect rate). The patients were prospectively followed for
      12 months. After ulcer healing, no maintenance therapy was given. One of the 29
      patients in whom H. pylori eradication had been successful suffered a second
      ulcer hemorrhage with H. pylori reinfection (3.4% relapse rate of ulcer
      bleeding), and this was managed endoscopically. Recurrent ulcer hemorrhage
      occurred in 2 out of 4 H. pylori-resistant patients. At the end of the follow-up 
      period, of the patients in whom H. pylori eradication had been initially
      successful, only the patient with re-bleeding remained reinfected. The 4 H.
      pylori-resistant patients showed persistent H. pylori colonization. In
      conclusion, omeprazole plus amoxycillin is a safe and effective treatment for
      eradicating H. pylori; this treatment reduces the relapse rate of duodenal ulcer 
      bleeding.

TI  - Critical issues in the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 577-86
AB  - AIM: To discuss some of the critical issues in the management of gastroesophageal
      reflux disease (GERD). OPINION: GERD is a chronic relapsing disease characterized
      by pathological exposure of the distal esophagus to gastric acid. Diagnosis of
      the condition can often be made on the basis of symptomatology alone. Endoscopy
      can help in assessing the degree of esophageal damage, influencing the choice of 
      therapy, and should be performed at least once during a symptomatic patient's
      lifetime to exclude a diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus. However, endoscopy is
      mandatory at diagnosis if alarm symptoms are present. Treatment should aim to
      provide the lowest degree of acid suppression needed for the control of symptoms.
      Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) represent the most cost-effective treatment option 
      for the short- and long-term management of GERD. Compared with standard- and
      high-dose H2-receptor antagonists, PPIs result in superior and faster healing and
      symptom relief across all grades of esophagitis and are more effective at
      maintaining patients in symptomatic and endoscopic remission. Treatment with PPIs
      has also been shown to reduce the rate of recurrent stricture after initial
      dilatation. PPIs are generally well tolerated, and to date there have been no
      reports of gastric dysplasia resulting from their long-term use. Anti-reflux
      surgery should be reserved for patients who are unresponsive to continuous PPI
      therapy or perhaps for young patients. It will be several years before the impact
      of laparoscopic fundoplication as a cost-beneficial therapy for GERD can be
      assessed. CONCLUSION: The superior clinical efficacy of PPIs when compared with
      any other drug regimen for GERD make them the treatment of choice for the short- 
      and long-term management of this troublesome condition.

TI  - Severe gastroesophageal reflux disease. Medical and surgical options for
      long-term care.
PG  - 98-106
AB  - Severe gastroesophageal reflux disease is usually a chronic problem with periods 
      of relapse, but effective medical and surgical therapies are available. Two
      recently introduced agents, omeprazole (Prilosec) and cisapride (Propulsid),
      represent advances in medical therapy; the safety of long-term, continuous
      omeprazole therapy is under investigation. Used by surgeons with sufficient
      experience, the new laparoscopic approach offers potential advantages over
      conventional anti-reflux surgery in suitable candidates. The decision of whether 
      to recommend long-term medical therapy or surgery must be individualized. Medical
      therapy may be the best choice in elderly patients and poor surgical candidates, 
      in patients whose symptoms are well controlled with omeprazole and who accept its
      benefit-risk profile, and when a highly experienced anti-reflux surgeon is not
      available. Surgery may be appropriate (assuming a skilled surgeon is available)
      in patients who are young, have trouble taking medication, need multiple agents
      to control symptoms, and need continuous omeprazole therapy but are unwilling to 
      accept the theoretical risk of gastric carcinoid tumors that accompanies it.

TI  - Impact of colloidal bismuth subnitrate in the eradication rates of Helicobacter
      pylori infection-associated duodenal ulcer using a short treatment regimen with
      omeprazole and clarithromycin: a randomized study.
PG  - 718-21
AB  - Recent trials have shown that duodenal ulcers treated by H2-blockers heal faster 
      if Helicobacter pylori is eradicated concurrently. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the
      efficacy of a short treatment regimen in H. pylori eradication and ulcer healing 
      and to assess the impact of colloidal bismuth subnitrate (CBS) in H. pylori
      eradication rate. METHODS: Sixty-one patients with H. pylori-associated duodenal 
      ulcer were randomized in two short treatment groups. Group A patients (31) were
      given omeprazole 20 mg b.i.d. x 8 days. Clarithromycin (500 mg, b.i.d.) and CBS
      (120 mg, q.i.d.) were added 24 h after starting omeprazole and were given for 7
      days. Group B patients (30) were treated as group A patients but without CBS.
      Endoscopies were performed at entry and 4 wk after the end of treatment. Presence
      of H. pylori was assessed at each endoscopy by urease test, and biopsy specimens 
      were examined for histological evidence of gastritis and by Gram stain and
      culture for H. pylori infection. No patient received follow-up treatment.
      RESULTS: H. pylori eradication rates were achieved in 25/31 (80.6%) group A
      patients and in 15/30 (50%) in group B patients (p = 0.012). Duodenal ulcer
      healing was documented in 30/31 (96.8%) patients in group A and in 25/30 (83%)
      patients in group B. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of CBS to the double therapy with 
      omeprazole and clarithromycin substantially improves the eradication rate of H.
      pylori. Short therapy with omeprazole 20 mg/b.i.d., clarithromycin 500 mg/b.i.d.,
      and CBS 120 mg/q.i.d. is a safe, well tolerated combination that achieves a 80.6%
      eradication rate of H. pylori and duodenal ulcer healing rates as good as those
      achieved by omeprazole 20 mg/d when given for 4 wk.

TI  - Double-blind trial of omeprazole and amoxicillin to cure Helicobacter pylori
      infection in patients with duodenal ulcers.
PG  - 1412-7
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Anti-Helicobacter pylori treatment with combinations of
      omeprazole and amoxicillin is a promising treatment option. The aim of this study
      was to investigate whether a daily omeprazole dose of 120 mg combined with
      amoxicillin would cure H. pylori infection at a rate comparable with that
      achieved with "triple therapy." METHODS: In a double-blind, randomized,
      controlled, and multicenter trial in Germany, 270 patients with an H.
      pylori-associated duodenal ulcer were treated with 40 mg omeprazole three times a
      day and 750 mg amoxicillin three times a day for the first 14 days (n = 139)
      followed by 20 mg omeprazole once daily until day 42 or with omeprazole plus 750 
      mg amoxicillin placebo three times a day for the same time period (n = 131).
      RESULTS: Cure rates of H. pylori infection were 91% in the omeprazole plus
      amoxicillin group, 0% in the omeprazole plus placebo group, and 89% and 0%,
      respectively, performing an intention-to-treat analysis. Cure of H. pylori
      infection in patients pretreated with omeprazole was only 58% compared with 95%
      in patients who were not. The cumulative 12-month relapse rates were 11.3% and
      44% in the treatment groups and 1.6% in H. pylori-negative and 49% in H.
      pylori-positive patients. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of 120 mg omeprazole daily
      and 2.25 g amoxicillin daily with its H. pylori cure rate of around 90% is one of
      the best tolerated and most effective treatment regimens.

TI  - Omeprazole and H2-receptor antagonists in the acute treatment of duodenal ulcer, 
      gastric ulcer and reflux oesophagitis: a meta-analysis.
PG  - 467-75
AB  - This paper is a meta-analysis of 30 published, double-blind clinical trials
      comparing omeprazole with ranitidine or cimetidine for the treatment of duodenal 
      ulcer, gastric ulcer and reflux oesophagitis. These studies compare the
      recommended doses of omeprazole with those for ranitidine and cimetidine, and the
      confidence intervals for the therapeutic gain show that the findings are highly
      reliable. The difference in healing rates favoured omeprazole over ranitidine in 
      patients with duodenal ulcer after 2 weeks of treatment (15.2 percentage units; P
      < 0.001), and after 4 weeks of treatment in patients with gastric ulcer (9.9
      percentage units; P = 0.005), or reflux oesophagitis (23 percentage units; P <
      0.001). Similarly, omeprazole gave a 20.6 percentage units higher average healing
      rate than cimetidine in patients with duodenal ulcer after 2 weeks of treatment
      (P < 0.0001). Significantly more patients treated with omeprazole were free of
      symptoms at their first follow-up visit than patients treated with ranitidine or 
      cimetidine.

TI  - Pharmacological management of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 695-710
AB  - Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) ranges from episodic symptomatic reflux 
      without oesophagitis to severe oesophageal mucosal damage, such as Barrett's
      metaplasia or peptic stricture. The multifactorial pathogenesis of GORD prevents 
      medical cure of the disease. GORD is a chronic disease with a high tendency to
      relapse, requiring a long term treatment strategy in practically all patients.
      Complete healing of all mucosal lesions is not necessarily the aim of treatment
      in all patients. In milder forms of reflux disease, symptom relief is the most
      important goal. Many patients with mild GORD do well on symptomatic self-care
      with antacids and/or alginate. In addition, lifestyle changes should be advised
      to all patients: these improve symptoms and enhance the efficacy of therapy. In
      the acute treatment of GORD the prokinetic drug cisapride has been shown to be
      effective in relieving symptoms and healing grade I to II oesophagitis. Cisapride
      decreases symptomatic and endoscopic relapse in patients with mild GORD.
      Histamine H2-receptor antagonists are effective in relieving reflux symptoms in
      about 50% of patients, but with regard to healing, H2-antagonists appear to be
      mainly effective in grades I and II and not in higher grades of oesophagitis.
      Maintenance treatment with H2-antagonists is mainly symptomatically effective in 
      patients with mild GORD. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) provide significantly
      higher healing rates of reflux oesophagitis than H2-antagonists, even in the more
      severe cases of oesophagitis and Barrett's ulcers. PPIs are also effective in
      patients with oesophagitis refractory to treatment with H2-antagonists. PPIs have
      become the drugs of first choice in healing of all patients with more severe
      forms of reflux oesophagitis, and increasingly also for patients with milder
      forms of oesophagitis, certainly those who fail to respond to other drugs. In
      maintenance treatment of GORD, PPIs are the most effective drugs, offering the
      possibility of keeping nearly all patients in remission with adjusted doses.
      Current patient data of up to 5 years indicate the safety of this strategy for
      this period, but the exact consequences of strong acid inhibition over a longer
      period still have to be clarified. At present, all but a few patients with GORD

TI  - Omeprazole versus ranitidine as adjunct therapy to endoscopic injection in
      actively bleeding ulcers: a prospective and randomized study.
PG  - 308-12
AB  - BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Although high rates of initial hemostasis can be
      achieved with endoscopic injection therapy in actively bleeding ulcers, the
      incidence of rebleeding is not negligible. Optimal conditions for clotting may
      require achieving deep and sustained acid inhibition to avoid the deleterious
      effect of acid and pepsin secretions on the hemostatic process. The aim of this
      study was to assess whether omeprazole could improve the efficacy of ranitidine
      as an adjunct treatment in endoscopic injection therapy to avoid rebleeding.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-six patients with active arterial bleeding from a
      peptic ulcer disclosed at emergency endoscopy were included in this prospective
      trial. All patients received injections of 1:10,000 adrenaline. Subsequently,
      they were randomized to receive either intravenous omeprazole (n = 45), with an
      initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every eight hours for four days and
      thereafter with oral administration; or ranitidine (n = 41), 50 mg every six
      hours for 12 to 24 hours and thereafter with oral administration. RESULTS: The
      two groups were well matched in terms of clinical and endoscopic data. There were
      no statistically significant differences between the groups with regard to:
      further bleeding (29% in both groups), need for emergency surgery (20% in the
      omeprazole group vs. 22% in the ranitidine group), transfusion requirements (2.4 
      +/- 2.2 vs. 2.2 +/- 2.1 units), length of hospital stay (14.1 +/- 13.9 vs. 15.3
      +/- 15.4 days), or mortality (7% vs. 2%). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that
      omeprazole does not improve the efficacy of ranitidine after endoscopic injection
      therapy in patients with an active arterial bleeding ulcer.

TI  - Effect of acid suppression on efficacy of treatment for Helicobacter pylori
      infection.
PG  - 817-20
AB  - Eradication of Helicobacter pylori from the stomach by triple therapy with
      bismuth, tetracycline, and metronidazole cures peptic ulcer disease. We
      investigated whether concomitant acid inhibition with omeprazole would improve
      the results of triple therapy. 108 consecutive patients with peptic-ulcer disease
      and biopsy-proven H pylori infection were randomised to 7 days of triple therapy 
      with or without omeprazole 20 mg twice daily. Patients in the omeprazole-treated 
      group were pretreated with 3 days of omeprazole. Eradication of H pylori was
      assessed by 10 endoscopic biopsies for urease test, histology, and culture 4-6
      weeks after treatment. 53 of 54 (98.1%) patients treated with omeprazole were
      cured compared with 45 of 54 (83.3%) of those not treated (p = 0.02), a
      difference in efficacy of 14.8% (95% Cl 4.2-25.4%). Most side effects were mild
      and did not interfere with compliance; 105 patients (97.2%) finished treatment.
      Gastro-intestinal side effects were significantly fewer in the omeprazole group. 
      We conclude that the addition of omeprazole to triple therapy improves efficacy, 
      lessens side effects, and is sufficiently efficacious to obviate the need for a
      diagnostic test of cure in compliant patients.

TI  - Omeprazole 10 mg or 20 mg once daily in the prevention of recurrence of reflux
      oesophagitis. Solo Investigator Group.
PG  - 492-8
AB  - This study determined the optimal maintenance dose of omeprazole in reflux
      oesophagitis. One hundred and ninety three patients rendered asymptomatic and
      healed after four or eight weeks omeprazole were randomised double blind to 10 mg
      omeprazole once daily (n = 60 evaluable), 20 mg omeprazole once daily (n = 68),
      or placebo (n = 62) for one year or until symptomatic relapse. Each omeprazole
      regimen was superior to placebo in preventing both symptomatic relapse (life
      table analysis, p < 0.001) and endoscopically verified relapse (p < 0.001). At 12
      months, the life table endoscopic remission rates (proportions of patients
      without grade > or = 2 oesophagitis) were: 50% (95% confidence intervals 34 to
      66%) with 10 mg omeprazole once daily, 74% (62 to 86%) with 20 mg omeprazole once
      daily, and 14% (2 to 26%) with placebo. At 12 months, the life table symptomatic 
      remission rates (proportions of patients asymptomatic or with mild symptoms)
      were: 77% (64 to 89%) with 10 mg omeprazole once daily, 83% (73 to 93%) with 20
      mg omeprazole once daily, and 34% (16 to 52%) with placebo. Both 10 mg and 20 mg 
      omeprazole once daily were effective in prolonging the remission of reflux
      oesophagitis: 10 mg may be appropriate to start longterm treatment, though the
      existence of a dose response relation means that 20 mg once daily may be
      effective in patients for whom 10 mg once daily is suboptimal.

TI  - Peptic ulcer patterns in Arctic Norway.
PG  - 100-3
AB  - While there are four times as many duodenal as gastric ulcers in Europe and the
      United States, previous studies have shown gastric ulcers to be more common in
      the Arctic regions of Norway. To investigate a possible change in the
      duodenal-to-gastric ulcer ratio, the incidence rate of first-time peptic ulcer in
      a well defined population in Northern Norway was studied by registration of all
      examinations of the upper digestive tract from 1983 to 1984. In this population, 
      5.3% were examined by endoscopy (52.5%) or a barium meal (47.5%). The incidence
      rates of duodenal and gastric ulcers were 1.4 and 0.8 per 1,000 per year,
      resulting in a duodenal-to-gastric ulcer ratio of 1.7:1. Although this ratio is
      higher than in a previous study (1.1:1), the pattern of peptic ulcer disease in
      northern Norway is still different from that in the rest of Europe.

TI  - Peptic ulcer--a new look.
PG  - 218-23
AB  - This review covers major advances in peptic ulcer disease over the last 25 years.
      Flexible endoscopy enables accurate diagnosis of peptic ulcer to be made and its 
      introduction made possible the large number of controlled clinical trials on the 
      use of various agents in peptic ulcer treatment. The histamine H-2 receptor
      antagonists, which reduce gastric acid output, were the first major group of
      potent ulcer healing drugs introduced. Subsequently, other ulcer healing agents
      with different modes of action, e.g. colloidal bismuth, sucralfate, prostaglandin
      analogues, omeprazole were also shown to be effective. The identification of
      Helicobacter pylori ten years ago was another major advance in peptic ulcer
      disease. This bacterium is now thought to be the most important cause of peptic
      ulcer disease and its eradication cures the disease. There are still unanswered
      questions regarding varying sequelae of Helicobacter pylori infection, the effect
      of the infection on gastric acid and gastrin secretion while a convenient and
      effective treatment regime remains to be developed. Non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs are now thought to be the second most important cause of 
      peptic ulcer disease and a major risk factor for ulcer complications and
      mortality. While misoprostol and histamine H-2 antagonists can prevent peptic
      ulcer associated with these substances, indications for prophylaxis have not yet 
      been defined. If Helicobacter pylori infection could be controlled through
      improved socio-economic standards and possible development of a vaccine, and if
      anti-inflammatory drugs devoid of gastric side effects can be developed, peptic
      ulcer may become a less important health problem in the future.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori and peptic ulcer disease.
PG  - 283-6
AB  - Since William Beaumont's classic description of gastric physiology in 1847, the
      focus of clinical practice and basic research concerning gastric and duodenal
      ulcers has centered on the secretion of acid and pepsin. In addition to these
      well-known factors (largely determined by heredity, age, and oral intake), the
      search for other agents that alter the mucosal barrier has identified a bacillus,
      Helicobacter pylori, as a significant agent in the development of chronic
      gastritis and benign gastric and duodenal ulcers. This review explores the
      scientific evidence for an important causal role of H. pylori in the development 
      of peptic ulcers on the basis of pathologic, pathophysiologic, and pharmacologic 
      data.

TI  - A comparison of lansoprazole and ranitidine in the treatment of erosive
      oesophagitis. Multicentre Investigational Group.
PG  - 25-31
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lansoprazole is a new proton pump inhibitor which produces prolonged 
      decrease of gastric acidity. The aim of this study was to compare lansoprazole to
      a standard dose of ranitidine in the treatment of patients with reflux
      oesophagitis. METHODS: Two hundred and forty-seven patients with erosive
      oesophagitis were randomly assigned to 8 weeks of treatment with either 30 mg
      lansoprazole once daily or 150 mg ranitidine twice daily. RESULTS: Two hundred
      and forty-two patients were included in the analysis. Lansoprazole (30 mg) daily,
      healed oesophagitis in 92.1% of patients after 8 weeks of treatment. This was
      significantly superior to 150 mg ranitidine b.d.s. which healed oesophagitis in
      69.9% of patients (P < 0.001). Relief of reflux symptoms was superior with
      lansoprazole to that with ranitidine. Both lansoprazole and ranitidine were well 
      tolerated with no serious drug-related adverse events noted. CONCLUSION:
      Lansoprazole, 30 mg once daily, is highly effective and safe in the short-term
      treatment of erosive oesophagitis.

TI  - Pantoprazole versus omeprazole in the treatment of acute gastric ulcers.
PG  - 19-24
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pantoprazole is a new substituted benzimidazole which is a potent
      inhibitor of gastric acid secretion by its action upon H+,K(+)-ATPase. METHODS:
      The proton pump inhibitors pantoprazole and omeprazole were compared in a
      randomized, double-blind study in 219 patients with benign gastric ulcers.
      Patients received either pantoprazole 40 mg (n = 146) or omeprazole 20 mg (n =
      73), once daily before breakfast for 4 weeks. Treatment was extended for a
      further 4 weeks if the ulcer had not healed. RESULTS: After 4 weeks, complete
      ulcer healing was seen in 88% of protocol-correct patients given pantoprazole and
      in 77% given omeprazole (between-group difference P < 0.05). At 8 weeks, the
      corresponding values were 97% and 96% (not significant). In the comparative
      intention-to-treat analysis there were no statistical differences between the
      treatment groups. Among the patients who had ulcer pain prior to treatment, 79%
      of the pantoprazole group and 68% of the omeprazole group were pain-free after 2 
      weeks, and after 4 weeks 88% and 81%, respectively (not significant). Pronounced 
      improvement in the other gastrointestinal symptoms was seen in both groups. Only 
      10% of patients in each group reported adverse events. There were moderate
      increases in fasting serum gastrin levels with both treatments at 4 and 8 weeks. 
      CONCLUSION: Pantoprazole, 40 mg once daily in the morning, is a highly effective,
      well tolerated treatment for acute, benign gastric ulcer. Pantoprazole and
      omeprazole were equally safe in the therapy of gastric ulcer.

TI  - Pantoprazole is superior to ranitidine in the treatment of acute gastric ulcer.
PG  - 111-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pantoprazole is a newly developed gastric H+/K(+)-adenosine
      triphosphatase inhibitor with a potent and long-acting inhibitory effect on
      gastric acid secretion. METHODS: In a double-blind multicenter study with 28
      centers in Germany, pantoprazole (40 mg before breakfast) was compared with
      ranitidine (300 mg at bedtime) with regard to healing rates, time until healing, 
      symptom relief, and tolerability. A total of 248 outpatients with benign gastric 
      ulcer were included. RESULTS: The healing rates after 2, 4, and 8 weeks were 37%,
      87%, and 97%, respectively, in the pantoprazole and 19%, 58%, and 80% in the
      ranitidine group. The differences between the two groups were significant at 2
      weeks (p < 0.01), 4 weeks (p < 0.001), and 8 weeks (p < 0.001;
      Cochran/Mantel-Haenszel method). Ulcer healing proceeded significantly faster
      with pantoprazole (p < 0.001; Uleman's U-test). Both treatments were well
      tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Pantoprazole appears to be superior to ranitidine in
      gastric ulcer healing.

TI  - Meta-analysis of the effect of placebo on the outcome of medically treated reflux
      esophagitis.
PG  - 101-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: To ascertain the placebo-induced effect in the treatment of reflux
      esophagitis, we reviewed all the English-language literature concerning the
      results of placebo-controlled trials of erosive/ulcerative esophagitis from 1976 
      to 1990. Twenty-two studies fulfilled our meta-analytic criteria. RESULTS: After 
      4 to 8 weeks of treatment, active drugs (cimetidine, ranitidine, nizatidine,
      omeprazole, metoclopramide, sucralfate) were significantly more effective than
      placebo in the healing of esophagitis, with a pooled rate difference (PRD) of
      0.22 in favor of the active drug, an odds ratio (OR) of 2.57 (confidence interval
      (CI) = 2.0-3.3). Pooled mean healing rate (+/- SD) with the active drug was 47.3 
      +/- 24.0%, as compared with 26.8 +/- 18.0% obtained with placebo after 4 to 8
      weeks of treatment. With regard to symptomatic response, complete disappearance
      of symptoms was observed in an average of 31.6% active-treated patients and in
      11.8% of placebo-treated patients, respectively. The PRD was 0.20, and the OR
      2.25 (CI = 1.65-3.06). The incidence of side effects was not statistically
      different for the two treatment groups. CONCLUSION: Placebo is a relatively
      inactive drug in the short-term treatment of erosive ulcerative reflux and does
      not appear to change the natural history of the disease.

TI  - Efficacy of omeprazole combined with antibiotics for Helicobacter pylori
      eradication and duodenal ulcer recurrence.
PG  - 117-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish the efficacy of omeprazole combined with two antibiotics 
      for Helicobacter pylori eradication and duodenal ulcer relapse. PATIENTS:
      Thirty-seven patients with endoscopically proven duodenal ulcer and H. pylori
      infection. METHODS: Treatment consisted of 20 mg omeprazole daily for 4 weeks
      with the addition, during the second and third weeks, of amoxycillin (1 g three
      times daily) and metronidazole (1 g daily) (group A) or placebo (group B).
      Endoscopy and biopsy to assess ulcer recurrence and H. pylori status were
      performed at entry to the study, after 4 weeks of therapy, and 1 and 6 months
      after treatment. RESULTS: Duodenal ulcers healed in all patients. H. pylori
      infection was eradicated in 15 (79%) out of 19 patients in group A and one (6%)
      out of 16 patients in group B (P < 0.01). One patient in each of the groups was
      lost to follow-up after 6 weeks. During the 6 month follow-up period, duodenal
      ulcers recurred in three of the 16 patients with H. pylori eradication, compared 
      with 16 of the 19 patients with persistent H. pylori infection (19 versus 84%; P 
      < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The combination of omeprazole with amoxycillin and
      metronidazole is effective in H. pylori eradication. This triple therapy, which
      eradicates H. pylori, also significantly reduced duodenal ulcer relapse.

TI  - Antibacterial treatment of gastric ulcers associated with Helicobacter pylori.
PG  - 139-42
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a strong association between infection with Helicobacter
      pylori and gastric ulcers that are unrelated to the use of nonsteroidal
      antiinflammatory medications. We studied the efficacy of antibacterial therapy
      without medication to suppress gastric acid for the treatment of patients with H.
      pylori infection and gastric ulcers unrelated to the use of nonsteroidal agents. 
      METHODS: Patients with gastric ulcers seen on endoscopy and with H. pylori
      infection confirmed by smear or culture were randomly assigned to receive either 
      a one-week course of antibacterial agents (120 mg of bismuth subcitrate, 500 mg
      of tetracycline, and 400 mg of metronidazole, each given orally four times a day)
      or a four-week course of omeprazole (20 mg orally per day). Follow-up endoscopies
      were performed after five and nine weeks. The patients and their physicians were 
      aware of the treatment assignments, but the endoscopists were not. RESULTS: A
      total of 100 patients were randomly assigned to treatment, and 85 completed the
      trial. At five weeks, H. pylori had been eradicated in 41 of the 45 patients in
      the antibacterial-treatment group (91.1 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 
      82.9 to 99.3) and in 5 of the 40 in the omeprazole group (12.5 percent; 95
      percent confidence interval, 2.3 to 22.7; P < 0.001). The gastric ulcers were
      healed in 38 of the patients treated with antibacterial drugs (84.4 percent; 95
      percent confidence interval, 73.9 to 95.0) and in 29 of those treated with
      omeprazole (72.5 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 58.6 to 86.4; P =
      0.28). At nine weeks, ulcer healing was confirmed in 43 of the patients receiving
      antibacterial therapy and in 37 of those receiving omeprazole (P = 1.0). The mean
      (+/- SD) duration of pain during the first week of treatment was 1.9 +/- 2.6 days
      in the omeprazole group, as compared with 3.6 +/- 3.0 days in the
      antibacterial-treatment group (P = 0.004). One year after treatment, recurrent
      gastric ulcers were detected in 1 of 22 patients (4.5 percent) in the
      antibacterial-treatment group and in 12 of 23 (52.2 percent) in the omeprazole
      group (P = 0.001). H. pylori was detected in the 1 patient with a recurrent ulcer
      who had received antibacterial treatment and in 10 of the 12 patients with
      recurrent ulcers who had received omeprazole. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with H.
      pylori infection and gastric ulcers unrelated to the use of nonsteroidal
      antiinflammatory drugs, one week of antibacterial therapy without acid
      suppression heals the ulcers as well as omeprazole and reduces the rate of their 
      recurrence.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori eradication: unravelling the facts.
PG  - 48-62
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recommendations for the choice, doses or duration of eradication
      therapy are still lacking. The purpose of this review was therefore to assess
      what conclusions could be drawn about eradication therapy, subsequent reinfection
      with Helicobacter pylori and ulcer recurrence. METHODS: Data were extracted from 
      published papers and abstracts and entered into a dedicated database for
      appropriate subset analyses. RESULTS: Despite problems of patient compliance and 
      metronidazole resistance, triple therapy with either a bismuth salt or an
      antisecretory agent plus two antibiotics appears to provide the most effective
      eradication of H. pylori (< 80%). Dual therapies such as omeprazole plus
      amoxycillin are less effective (mean 59%, range 0-92%). Reinfection rates over
      one year vary between countries from 3% in Australia and the USA to 35% in
      Ireland. Reports of ulcer recurrence during the first year after successful
      eradication range from 0 to 27%. CONCLUSIONS: There are insufficient data for
      particular doses and durations of eradication therapy from well designed
      controlled studies.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori and peptic ulcer.
PG  - 92-6
AB  - Helicobacter pylori is an important pathogen causing both gastric and duodenal
      ulcer. The causal relationship is based on the strong association of peptic ulcer
      with H. pylori-induced gastritis, the improved rate of healing with H. pylori
      suppression, and markedly low recurrence rates for ulcer after H. pylori
      eradication. The ideal regimen for H. pylori eradication should be simple,
      inexpensive, free of side effects, and effective in at least 90% of patients.
      Triple therapy involving bismuth, metronidazole and tetracycline or amoxicillin
      results in the best and most consistent eradication data, but there is a
      significant incidence of side effects and problems with compliance. Acid
      suppression with ranitidine or omeprazole combined with antibiotics is effective 
      but expensive with variable results in clinical trials. Sucralfate may also
      reduce H. pylori density and enhance the action of antibiotics used in
      eradication regimens. Studies reported in this Journal suggest that sucralfate
      can be successfully substituted for bismuth in triple therapy regimens with
      documented efficacy and few side effects. Considerable progress in developing
      newer regimens to eradicate H. pylori has been made. However, the development of 
      an ideal drug or regimen remains a challenge.

TI  - Sucralfate in Helicobacter pylori eradication strategies.
PG  - 89-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sucralfate monotherapy has been shown to suppress but not eradicate
      Helicobacter pylori. The combination of sucralfate with antibiotic(s) has been
      evaluated recently in the treatment of H. pylori-positive duodenal ulcer. The aim
      of this article is to review the efficacy of sucralfate-containing duotherapy and
      triple therapy in duodenal ulcer healing and H. pylori eradication rates.
      METHODS: Reports on duotherapy and triple therapy including sucralfate as the
      mediating agent were analysed to assess the duodenal ulcer healing and H. pylori 
      eradication rates. RESULTS: One study on duotherapy with sucralfate and
      amoxycillin achieved an ulcer healing rate of 86% and H. pylori eradication rate 
      of 40%, which compared favourably with sucralfate monotherapy that resulted in
      duodenal ulcer healing and H. pylori eradication rates of 65% and 0%
      respectively. A total of six studies have examined triple therapy using
      sucralfate with two antibiotics. The duodenal ulcer healing rates were generally 
      over 90% and the H. pylori eradication rates about 80% (range 59% to 100%). In
      one comparative study, the 4-week duodenal ulcer healing and H. pylori
      eradication rates of sucralfate-containing triple therapy were not
      distinguishable from those of omeprazole-containing triple therapy. CONCLUSIONS: 
      It is concluded that sucralfate is an effective mediating agent for the
      eradication of H. pylori in patients with duodenal ulcer.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori eradication: a critical appraisal and current concerns.
PG  - 73-6
AB  - Helicobacter pylori is now well recognized as a critical factor in the majority
      of patients with peptic ulcer disease and successful treatment of the infection
      results in cure of the disease. However, treatment of this infection has proved
      difficult, involving a combination of drugs, and has usually involved complex
      treatment regimens. Triple therapy involving a bismuth compound in combination
      with metronidazole and tetracycline or amoxicillin have been most widely used and
      achieve successful cure of the infection in about 90% of cases when the
      tetracycline combination is used. More recently, the use of the proton-pump
      inhibitors in combination with amoxicillin have been widely advocated to combine 
      effective symptom relief with high ulcer healing rates and an opportunity to cure
      the disease. However, all these treatments have some disadvantages due to
      unpredictability, adverse events, complex regimens making compliance difficult,
      or cost. This article reviews the results of current treatments for the
      eradication of H. pylori infection and identifies opportunities for the
      development of optimal approaches to the cure of this infection.

TI  - Effect of intravenous infusion of omeprazole and ranitidine on twenty-four-hour
      intragastric pH in patients with a history of duodenal ulcer.
PG  - 25-30
AB  - The effect on intragastric pH of two different dose regimens of continuous
      intravenous infusion of omeprazole (4 or 8 mg/h after a bolus of 80 mg), and
      ranitidine (0.25 mg/kg/h after a bolus of 50 mg) was studied in 10 patients with 
      duodenal ulcer disease in symptomatic remission. The pH was monitored over
      24-hour periods during fasting in a cross-over, randomised design including a
      baseline period. With the high omeprazole dose it was possible to maintain a pH >
      or = 4 in all patients but 1 and 6 of the patients also maintained a pH > or = 6.
      The lower dose of omeprazole seemed to be somewhat less effective. Continuous
      infusion of ranitidine was as efficient as the higher omeprazole infusion
      although with a tendency to decreased pH levels towards the end of the 24-hour
      period. Thus, in order to obtain consistently high pH levels of 4-6 over a
      prolonged period a continuous infusion of omeprazole, an 80-mg bolus plus a
      continuous infusion of 8 mg/h seem to be needed.

      infection in duodenal ulcer disease.
PG  - 14-20
AB  - Treatment with omeprazole plus amoxicillin or clarithromycin resulted in
      encouraging Helicobacter pylori cure rates in pilot and controlled studies. The
      present prospective, randomized study was designed to compared the efficacy and
      safety of amoxicillin and clarithromycin as constituents of omeprazole-enhanced
      antibiotic therapy of H. pylori infection. Fifty patients with active duodenal
      ulcer disease and histologically and/or culturally confirmed H. pylori
      colonization of the gastric mucosa were treated with omeprazole (day 1-14: 40 mg 
      twice daily, day 15-42: 20 mg once in the morning). The patients were randomly
      assigned to receive either amoxicillin (1 g twice daily; group I: n = 25) or
      clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily; group II: n = 25) during the first 2 weeks of
      treatment. The patients of group I and II had comparable demographic and clinical
      characteristics. One patient of group I was lost to follow-up. H. pylori
      infection was cured in 87.5% of group I and 84.0% of group II (p = 1.00). All
      ulcers had healed after 6 weeks of omeprazole treatment. Pain relief occurred
      within the first day of treatment in the majority of patients of both groups (p =
      0.89). Minor side effects were recorded in 6 patients of group I and in 4
      patients of group II (25 vs. 16%; p = 0.50). In 1 female patient amoxicillin had 
      to be withdrawn after 3 days because of nausea and emesis. In conclusion, 2 weeks
      of treatment with omeprazole plus amoxicillin or clarithromycin are highly and
      equally effective regimens to cure H. pylori infection in patients with duodenal 
      ulcer disease.

TI  - Triple therapy eradicated H. pylori equally in patients pretreated with
      omeprazole or ranitidine. A 12-month follow-up.
PG  - 12-6
AB  - The aim of this study was twofold: first, to investigate the effectiveness of a
      standard triple therapy (tripotassium dicitrato bismuthate, 125 mg q.i.d.,
      tetracycline hydrochloride 500 mg q.i.d., and metronidazole 500 mg t.i.d.) in
      eradicating Helicobacter pylori in patients with duodenal ulcer successfully
      healed with omeprazole or ranitidine; second, to examine the influence of the
      eradication on duodenal ulcer recurrence rate after 12 months. Two hundred
      forty-five consecutive H. pylori-positive patients with healed duodenal ulcer
      either with omeprazole (20 mg/day, 126 patients) or with ranitidine (150 mg
      b.i.d., 119 patients) given at random, began triple therapy for 15 days. H.
      pylori eradication was looked for 4-5 weeks later by culture of biopsy material, 
      hematoxylin-eosin stain, and rapid urease test. H. pylori-eradicated patients
      were followed up for 12 months. Endoscopy was carried out at the end of the
      follow-up or whenever symptoms appeared. Five patients (2.0%) withdrew because of
      triple-therapy-related side effects. The eradication rate was 92% (220 of 240
      patients); no difference was found between those healed with omeprazole (93%, 114
      of 123 patients) or ranitidine (91%, 106 of 117 patients). Of 220 successfully
      treated patients, 132 completed the 12-month follow-up. The duodenal ulcer
      recurrence rate was 4% (5 of 132 patients); 3% (2 of 70) in the omeprazole group 
      and 5% (3 of 62) in the ranitidine group healed. All the recurrences were
      asymptomatic. H. pylori recurrence rate was 11% (14 of 132 patients); no
      difference was found between patients healed with omeprazole (10%, 7 of 70
      patients) or with ranitidine (11%, 7 of 62 patients). All the recurrent duodenal 
      ulcers occurred in H. pylori-positive patients (36%, 5 of 14 patients). Standard 
      triple therapy after duodenal ulcer healing with omeprazole or ranitidine
      eradicates H. pylori in comparable high rates. Side effects were mild and
      dropouts were only 2%. Ulcer recurrence rate 12 months after eradication was low 
      and comparable between those healed with omeprazole or ranitidine.

PG  - 9-11
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of two 1-week low-dose triple
      therapy regimens for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection. PATIENTS AND
      METHODS: Eighty patients with H. pylori infection and peptic ulcer disease (n =
      64) or functional dyspepsia (n = 16), with similar demographic and clinical
      characteristics, were treated for 1 week with either omeprazole 20 mg once in the
      morning and clarithromycin 250 mg and metronidazole 400 mg twice daily (OCM; n = 
      40) or with omeprazole 20 mg once in the morning and clarithromycin 250 mg and
      tetracycline 500 mg twice daily (OCT; n = 40). H. pylori infection was assessed
      by urease test, culture and histology performed before and 4 (or more) weeks
      after cessation of the eradication therapy. RESULTS: H. pylori infection was
      treated successfully in 38 out of 40 patients by OCM and in 26 out of 40 patients
      by OCT (95 versus 65%, respectively; P = 0.0015). The OCM regimen was well
      tolerated in all patients except for one who complained of epigastric pain. Three
      patients on the OCT regimen reported side effects (abdominal pain, diarrhoea,
      pruritus), two of whom discontinued the study medication after 1 day.
      CONCLUSIONS: The 1-week low-dose triple therapy comprising omeprazole,
      clarithromycin and metronidazole was highly effective in eradicating H. pylori
      and was well tolerated. The replacement of metronidazole by tetracycline resulted
      in a significant decrease in the eradication rate.

      and 12 months (p < 0.05). After 3 months (T1) no significant effectiveness was
      found in the prevention of ulcer relapses by omeprazole and ranitidine. After 6
      months (T2) a significant reduction of relapses (p < 0.05) was recorded when
      comparing every- other-day omeprazole to the weekend regimen. After 12 months
      every-other-day omeprazole treatment significantly reduced the relapses compared 
      with the week-end therapy (p = 0.05) and with ranitidine (p < 0.05).

AB  - Forty-five patients with pancreatic steatorrhoea (27 with calcified pancreatitis,
      13 with non-calcified pancreatitis, two with pancreaticoduodenectomy, one with
      total pancreatectomy, and two with pancreatic cancer) were divided into four
      groups and given the following medication for 2 to 4 weeks: 4 to 6 g/day of
      sodium bicarbonate (group I); 9 g/day of high-lipase pancreatin (lipase, 56,600
      U/g, Federation Internationale Pharmaceutique (FIP); group II); 12 to 24 tablets 
      or 9.0 g of commercial pancreatic enzyme preparations (group III); or 50 mg of
      omeprazole (group IV). Faecal fat excretion was evaluated before and after drug
      administration. Faecal fat excretion was reduced by 2.9 g (range, 1.7 to 5.0 g)
      in group I; 8.8 g (range, 2.9 to 39.9 g) in group II; 10.8 g (range, 2.3 to 21.8 
      g) in group III; and 4.3 g (range, 3.6 to 5.6 g) in group IV. The pancreatic
      digestive enzyme preparation was more effective than sodium bicarbonate and
      agents that raise the pH of the upper small intestine (such as proton-pump
      inhibitors) in reducing faecal fat excretion. The results indicate that all of
      the preparations used are effective against mild pancreatic steatorrhoea. If the 
      condition is more advanced, however, a massive dosage of pancreatic digestive
      enzyme and possibly the combined use of an agent to raise the pH of the upper
      small intestine are likely to be effective.

      acid secretion, and concentrations of gastrointestinal hormones and enzymes in
      serum and gastric juice in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 137-44
AB  - Twelve healthy volunteers (6 females, 6 males) between 26 and 36 years of age
      were enroled in this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, three-way
      cross-over study. The objective was to determine the influence of lansoprazole
      (Agopton, Takeda Pharma GmbH, Aachen), a novel proton pump inhibitor, in doses of
      30 and 60 mg, on the intragastric pH, on meal-stimulated gastric acid secretion
      and on the concentration of gastrointestinal hormones and enzymes in serum and
      gastric juice. Active drug or placebo had to be taken as single daily morning
      doses on an empty stomach for 7 days. Each wash-out period between drug
      application periods was 2 weeks long. Lansoprazole induced a dose-related
      increase in intragastric pH as well as a relevant reduction of basal acid output,
      meal-stimulated acid output and meal-stimulated secretion volume. 60 mg
      lansoprazole was significantly superior to 30 mg in increasing intragastric pH.
      The basal secretion volume in volunteers on 30 and 60 mg lansoprazole were lower 
      than in volunteers on placebo. Serum gastrin and serum pepsinogen concentrations 
      increased in a dose-dependent manner. Pepsin output and pepsin activity in
      gastric juice were slightly decreased in volunteers on 30 mg lansoprazole and
      markedly suppressed in volunteers on 60 mg lansoprazole 2 h after meal
      stimulation. Intrinsic factor concentration increased in volunteers on
      lansoprazole with a clear dose relationship. The evaluation of laboratory data
      and reported nonserious adverse events proved the relative safety of this new
      antiulcer agent.

PG  - 5-7
AB  - To evaluate whether eradication with omeprazole and amoxicillin results in a
      reduction of ulcer recurrence and rebleeding in patients with Helicobacter
      pylori-associated duodenal ulcer hemorrhage, patients with upper gastrointestinal
      hemorrhage from duodenal ulcers with stigmata of recent hemorrhage, a drop in
      hemoglobin level of more than 2 g/dL, and documented H. pylori infection (by
      rapid urease test and histologic findings) were randomly assigned to receive
      omeprazole, 40 mg every day, and amoxicillin, 1 g twice a day, (Group A) or
      omeprazole alone, 40 mg every day, (Group B) for 2 weeks. No maintenance
      antiulcer therapy was given. Patients underwent a second endoscopy 4 weeks after 
      completion of therapy and were followed for 1 year. Endoscopy was performed again
      at the end of 1 year. All patients showed ulcer healing 4 weeks after completion 
      of therapy. H. pylori eradication rates were 83% (Group A) and 5% (Group B) (p < 
      .001). Ulcer recurrences were significantly lower in Group A (3/29 or 10%) than
      in Group B (9/22 or 41%; p < .05). Comparison of Group A patients with
      eradication and Group B patients without eradication also revealed a significant 
      difference in rates of ulcer relapse (1/24 or 4% versus 9/21 or 43%; p < .01).
      Rebleeding occurred significantly less often in the dual therapy group than in
      the omeprazole group (0/29 versus 6/22 or 27%; p < .01). Eradication of H. pylori
      significantly reduces the rates of ulcer recurrence and rebleeding in patients
      with duodenal ulcer bleeding. Dual therapy with omeprazole and amoxicillin should
      be considered in all H. pylori-positive patients with hemorrhage from duodenal
      ulcers.

TI  - Eradication of Helicobacter pylori reduces the possibility of rebleeding in
      peptic ulcer disease.
PG  - 1-4
AB  - A close relationship has been found between Helicobacter pylori and peptic ulcer 
      disease. Furthermore, eradication of H. pylori is associated with low recurrence 
      rates. The aim of the present study was to examine whether eradication of H.
      pylori has any impact on the complications of ulcers, such as bleeding.
      Thirty-one patients hospitalized for duodenal ulcer bleeding, undergoing
      conservative treatment and with a previous history of bleeding, comprised the
      group studied. All patients had emergency endoscopy, and tests for H. pylori
      proved to be positive in all. After discharge, patients were given omeprazole 20 
      mg daily for 4 weeks for ulcer healing, which was achieved in all patients
      (100%). After this, patients were randomized to receive either omeprazole 20 mg
      t.i.d. alone (group O, n = 15) or the combination of omeprazole 20 mg t.i.d. +
      amoxicillin 500 mg q.i.d. (group O + A, n = 16) for 2 weeks. Endoscopy was
      performed 4 weeks after treatment ended to check for eradication of H. pylori and
      again when rebleeding or symptomatic relapse occurred. Groups O and O + A were
      similar in age, sex, smoking habits, and NSAID use. The follow-up period was 12
      months for both groups. Eradication was achieved in 2 of 15 (13.3%) patients in
      group O and in 13 of 16 (81.3%) patients in group O + A (p < .001). Five patients
      rebled during follow-up. All of them belonged to group O and were patients in
      whom eradication had failed. In contrast, none of group O + A had rebleeding (p =
      0.18).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Prevention of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced gastroduodenal ulcers: 
      role of mucosal protective and gastric antisecretory drugs.
PG  - 48-61
AB  - One of the most serious side effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
      (NSAIDs) is upper gastrointestinal mucosal damage that may result in erosions,
      ulcerations and other serious complications. NSAIDs reduce endogenous
      prostaglandins, and this reduction is relevant to their pharmacology and
      toxicity. The stomach and to some extent the duodenum are the major organs
      involved in the mucosal toxicity of NSAIDs. With the availability of the
      synthetic prostaglandin misoprostol, it has become possible to prevent
      NSAID-induced gastroduodenal ulcers without compromising the beneficial
      antirheumatic and analgesic effects of NSAID therapy. In fact, misoprostol is the
      only drug with established long-term efficacy in preventing NSAID-induced
      gastroduodenal ulcers in rheumatic patients. The purpose of this communication is
      to critically review the efficacy of gastric antisecretory drugs, mucosal
      protective drugs and misoprostol when used for the prevention of NSAID-induced
      ulcers, considering only data from well-controlled, randomized, double-blind
      clinical studies. The histamine H2-receptor antagonist ranitidine has been shown 
      to be effective in preventing NSAID-induced duodenal ulcers, but has no efficacy 
      in preventing NSAID-induced gastric ulcers. In a direct comparative trial with
      ranitidine, misoprostol (200 micrograms qid) was significantly more effective
      than ranitidine (150 mg bid) in preventing gastric ulcers in chronic NSAID users.
      The inactivity of ranitidine in preventing gastric ulcers indicates that the
      pathogenesis of NSAID-induced gastric ulcers is not related to gastric acid.
      Limited but conflicting data exist with omeprazole. The mucosal-coating drug
      sucralfate has not been found effective in preventing NSAID ulcers. In fact, in a
      direct comparative trial, misoprostol (200 micrograms qid) was significantly more
      effective than sucralfate (1 g qid) in preventing gastric ulcers in patients
      receiving chronic NSAID therapy. No meaningful data exist with organic bismuth
      salts, a group of drugs which has mucosal coating and protective properties. From
      this brief overview, we conclude: (1) mucosal-coating compounds have no
      therapeutic role in preventing NSAID-induced ulceration; (2) gastric
      antisecretory drugs are not effective in preventing NSAID-induced gastric ulcers,
      and (3) misoprostol is the only antiulcer drug proven to be effective for
      preventing NSAID-induced gastric and duodenal ulcers in patients receiving
      chronic NSAID. Misoprostol represents a major therapeutic advance for the
      management of NSAID-induced mucosal injury.

PG  - 187-93
AB  - The present study evaluated the time in remission during a 2-year follow-up after
      eradication of Helicobacter pylori (HP) in patients with an HP-associated
      duodenal ulcer (DU). HP was eradicated by combined treatment with high-dose
      omeprazole (2 x 40 mg) and amoxicillin (2 x 1,000 mg; n = 27) administered for 10
      days (OME + AMX); alternatively, patients were treated with omeprazole
      monotherapy (OME) using the same dosage (n = 25). During the 2-year follow-up
      period endoscopy including histological examination was performed after 1 and 2
      years or whenever symptoms compatible with ulcer relapse occurred. HP eradication
      was achieved in 82% of the OME + AMX group, but in 0% of the OME group. The
      cumulative DU relapse rates were 0% after 1 year and 7% after 2 years in 22
      patients who became HP-negative. Both HP-negative patients who relapsed in the
      2nd year of follow-up were HP-positive again at the time of relapse. Of the 5
      patients who were not eradicated after OME + AMX therapy, 2 relapsed within the
      1st year (40%) and another 2 within the 2nd year (80%). In the OME group the
      cumulative relapse rates within 1 and 2 years of follow-up were 52 and 76%,
      respectively. The results further confirm that eradication of HP with combined
      OME + AMX treatment leads to a distinct decrease in DU relapse rates and thus may
      cure DU disease. Long-term eradication with combined OME + AMX treatment is
      possible, and the rate of reinfection with HP is low (4.5%/year).

      in duodenal ulcer patients: a multicenter, prospective, comparative study.
      Interdisciplinary Group for Ulcer Study.
PG  - 181-6
AB  - We performed an open, prospective, randomized, three-cell, 6-month clinical trial
      on the prevention of duodenal ulcer (DU) relapse, comparing three omeprazole
      schedules, i.e. 20 mg daily, 20 mg every other day (e.o.d.) and 40 mg on
      Saturdays and Sundays (S/S). Diagnosis of either healed or relapsed DU was on an 
      endoscopic basis. Follow-up visits were performed at 3-monthly intervals with
      endoscopy at the baseline, after 6 months and at every symptomatic relapse.
      Statistics: chi 2 test with standardized deviates, Yates' corrected chi 2 test
      and analysis of variance (one-way). One hundred and fifteen patients were
      randomized to receive omeprazole 20 mg/day, 123 omeprazole 20 mg e.o.d. and 115
      40 mg S/S. Twenty-eight dropped out (11, 8 and 9, respectively). Demonstrated
      ulcer relapse rates were 5.7% with omeprazole 20 mg/day, 18.1% with 20 mg e.o.d. 
      and 17.6% with 40 mg S/S (p = 0.0124, 'per-protocol' analysis). No clinically
      significant adverse effects were recorded. In conclusion, of the three schedules 
      studied, omeprazole 20 mg/day proved the most effective maintenance treatment for
      healed DU.

TI  - Hypertension in the elderly. Implications and generalizability of randomized
      trials.
PG  - 1932-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate morbidity and mortality benefits of drug therapy for
      hypertensive elderly subjects, compare these benefits with effects in younger
      subjects, and provide a framework for generalizing results derived from trials to
      actual patients. DATA SOURCES: A literature search using MEDLINE from 1966 to
      1993, references from reviews and trial articles, and experts. STUDY SELECTION:
      Randomized trials lasting at least 1 year that evaluated effects of drug
      treatment on morbidity and mortality outcomes in hypertensive persons. DATA
      EXTRACTION: Four independent reviewers appraised protocol characteristics and
      quality of selected trials. DATA SYNTHESIS: There were 13 trials involving 16,564
      elderly persons (age 60 years and older). The prevalence of cardiovascular risk
      factors, cardiovascular disease, and competing comorbid diseases was lower among 
      trial participants than the general population of hypertensive elderly persons.
      When the six large high-quality trials were combined, trial results showed 43
      subjects (95% confidence interval [CI], 31 to 69) and 61 subjects (95% CI, 39 to 
      141) needed to be treated for 5 years to prevent one cerebrovascular event and
      one coronary heart disease event, respectively. Including the other seven trials 
      did not change the results significantly. Only 18 subjects (95% CI, 14 to 25)
      needed to be treated to prevent one cardiovascular event (cerebrovascular or
      cardiac). Twelve trials in primarily younger and middle-aged adults involved
      approximately 33,000 persons. For all outcomes except cardiac mortality, two to
      four times as many of the younger subjects as the older subjects needed to be
      treated for 5 years to prevent morbid and mortal events. No significant effect on
      cardiac mortality was seen among younger subjects, while 78 older subjects (95%
      CI, 50 to 180) needed to be treated to prevent a fatal cardiac event.
      CONCLUSIONS: Randomized trials demonstrate that treating healthy older persons
      with hypertension is highly efficacious. Five-year morbidity and mortality
      benefits derived from trials are greater for older than younger subjects.
      Extrapolating benefits from trials to individual patients is difficult, but
      should take into account multiple issues including the patient's risk factors,
      preexisting cardiovascular disease, and competing comorbid illnesses.

TI  - Omeprazole plus amoxicillin for cure of Helicobacter pylori infection. Factors
      influencing the treatment success.
PG  - 1070-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Omeprazole plus amoxicillin may cure Helicobacter pylori infection.
      However, the published results vary rather widely, and the factors influencing
      the treatment success remain unclear. METHODS: Four hundred and twenty-three H.
      pylori-positive patients were treated with 1- or 2-week regimens comprising 40 mg
      or 80 mg omeprazole and amoxicillin in 11 prospective protocols. A complete set
      of data was available for 405 patients (ulcer disease, n = 383; dyspepsia, n =
      22) and was submitted to uni- and multi-variate statistical analyses to elucidate
      the factors affecting the cure rates of the infection; 18 patients were lost to
      follow-up. RESULTS: The overall proportion of H. pylori cure was 76%.
      Insufficient compliance (p < 0.001), a short duration of treatment (p < 0.001),
      smoking (p = 0.003), and omeprazole pretreatment (p = 0.041) were the significant
      independent factors predicting treatment failure, whereas advanced age (p =
      0.002), high scores of grade and of activity of gastritis (p = 0.035 and p =
      0.019, respectively), and gastric ulcer disease (p = 0.058) were independent
      factors predicting treatment success. CONCLUSIONS: Several patient- and
      therapy-related factors diminish or increase the rate of H. pylori cure obtained 
      by omeprazole/amoxicillin. These should be considered in future studies comparing
      different treatment regimens for curing H. pylori infection and also when
      designing treatment regimens applicable for routine clinical practice.

TI  - Peptic ulcer disease in children. Diagnosis, treatment, and the implication of
      Helicobacter pylori.
PG  - 707-25
AB  - Peptic ulcers are a relatively infrequent occurrence in children. Ulcers in the
      stomach and duodenum are typically secondary to systemic illnesses or drugs in
      young children; secondary ulcers do not recur. In contrast, duodenal ulcers in
      older children and adolescents have a relapsing course that is increasingly
      recognized to be related to coexisting, chronic, active antral gastritis and
      Helicobacter pylori infection. Antihelicobacter therapy not only heals duodenal
      ulcers, but it alters the natural history by reducing the frequency of ulcer
      recurrences. Not all primary duodenal or gastric ulcers in the pediatric
      population, however, are related to H. pylori; their cause remains unknown.
      Treatment for these patients requires either antacids, H2 blockers, proton pump
      inhibitors, or ulcer coating agents for 6-8 weeks along with long-term
      maintenance therapy.

TI  - Effects of omeprazole and eradication of Helicobacter pylori on gastric and
      duodenal mucosal enzyme activities and DNA in duodenal ulcer patients.
PG  - 995-1000
AB  - BACKGROUND: Duodenal and gastric content of mucosal enzymes in duodenal ulcer
      (DU) patients differs from that of controls. The purpose of this study has been
      to examine the effect of omeprazole and eradication of Helicobacter pylori on
      mucosal enzymes in DU patients. METHODS: The enzyme activities of seven gastric
      and duodenal mucosal marker enzymes from the brush border, lysosomes, and
      mitochondria have been studied. In study I the measurements were made in 29
      patients with an active DU before and after 14 days of omeprazole treatment. In
      study II 22 duodenal ulcer patients were given bismuth subnitrate,
      oxytetracycline, and metronidazole (triple therapy) for 2 weeks to eradicate H.
      pylori. Biopsy specimens were taken from the duodenum and the stomach for enzyme 
      measurements and histologic assessment. In study II additional specimens were
      obtained from the prepyloric region for urease tests and culture of H. pylori.
      RESULTS: The ulcer healing rates were more than 90% after both omeprazole and
      triple therapy. H. pylori was eradicated in 86% after triple therapy. The
      activities of the brush-border enzymes lactase, neutral-alpha-glucosidase,
      alkaline phosphatase, leucyl-beta-naphthylamidase, and gamma-glutamyltransferase 
      (gamma-GT) increased significantly in the duodenal bulb and the descending
      duodenum during treatment with omeprazole. No changes in duodenal enzyme activity
      were detected after triple therapy, whereas a significant fall in gamma-GT and
      acid phosphatase activities was seen in the stomach. The mucosal DNA in the
      gastric antrum decreased both after treatment with omeprazole and after triple
      therapy. CONCLUSIONS: A similar decrease in mucosal DNA of the gastric antrum was
      demonstrated after both omeprazole and triple therapy with bismuth subnitrate,
      oxytetracycline, and metronidazole. Omeprazole also affects the content of
      duodenal mucosal enzymes, whereas triple therapy particularly affects the gastric
      mucosal enzyme activity.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic optimisation of the treatment of peptic ulcer in patients with
      renal failure.
PG  - 393-408
AB  - The pathogenesis of peptic ulceration is not yet clear. It could be due to an
      imbalance between acid secretion and mucosal defensive and/or protective
      mechanisms, but the association between Helicobacter pylori and peptic ulceration
      has questioned this hypothesis. Therefore, drugs inhibiting acid secretion and/or
      eradicating H. pylori are of major interest. Peptic ulcer disease is often
      associated with renal failure. For the selection of the proper dosage of these
      agents their pharmacokinetic properties and alterations in pharmacokinetics in
      various disease states, including renal failure, should be known. As histamine
      H2-receptor antagonists and pirenzepine are mainly eliminated by the renal route 
      their elimination is dependent on creatinine clearance. Consequently, their
      elimination will be impaired in patients with renal insufficiency, which makes
      dosage reduction mandatory in these patients. No dosage supplementation is
      necessary after any type of dialysis because the drugs are removed in
      insignificant amounts by the various blood purification procedures. Misoprostol
      and proton pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole, lansoprazole and pantoprazole,
      are primarily eliminated by nonrenal routes. Therefore no dosage adjustments are 
      necessary in patients with renal insufficiency. Bismuth salts, sucralfate and
      antacids should be avoided in patients with renal failure because of the
      accumulation of their cations and the associated risk of toxic reactions. For
      most agents more long term experience from comparative and double-blinded studies
      is needed to define better their clinical efficacy and tolerability in patients
      with renal failure.

TI  - The efficacy of two doses of omeprazole for short- and long-term peptic ulcer
      treatment in the elderly.
PG  - 935-41
AB  - This study evaluated the efficacy, safety, and most suitable dose of omeprazole
      in short-term acute treatment (4 weeks) and maintenance treatment (6 months) of
      patients older than 60 years of age with endoscopically diagnosed gastric ulcer
      (GU) or duodenal ulcer (DU). This randomized, prospective study included 156
      patients (67 GU and 89 DU; mean age, 74.8 and 72.3 years, respectively) who were 
      randomized in the acute phase into two treatment groups: omeprazole 20 mg/d or 40
      mg/d as a single morning dose for 4 weeks. The 6-month follow-up phase included
      101 patients who were randomized to receive omeprazole 20 mg/d or 20 mg every
      other day. After 4 weeks of treatment, 94.0% of GU patients and 95.5% of DU
      patients showed complete ulcer scarring with no statistical differences between
      doses. At the end of the 6-month follow-up, 4.5% of GU patients and 8.8% of DU
      patients relapsed, with no statistical differences between groups. No clinically 
      significant adverse events were recorded. In conclusion, omeprazole is a highly
      effective, well-tolerated, and safe drug for the short- and long-term treatment
      of GU and DU in the elderly. The dose of 20 mg/d for the acute phase and 20 mg on
      alternate days for maintenance therapy appears most appropriate for elderly
      patients with ulcers.

TI  - Effect of up to 3 years of high-dose lansoprazole on Barrett's esophagus.
PG  - 1844-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Barrett's esophagus is a metaplastic condition resulting from
      gastroesophageal reflux disease. Previous medical and surgical therapies have
      failed to predictably eradicate Barrett's. The objective of this study was to
      assess the impact of long-term, high-dose lansoprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, 
      on Barrett's esophagus. METHODS: Patients with Barrett's esophagus at least 3 cm 
      long and with specialized columnar epithelium were treated with 60 mg of
      lansoprazole each morning. Every 6 months, patients had standardized symptomatic,
      laboratory, and endoscopic assessment. The length of Barrett's esophagus was
      measured, photo-documented, and biopsied. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients with
      Barrett's esophagus have been treated an average of 2.9 yr. Symptoms improved
      (70%, 19 patients), and erosive esophagitis healed (100%, 13 patients), but there
      was no significant reduction in the length of Barrett's epithelium (mean length
      at baseline 5.7 cm, final visit 5.3 cm). However, by the final visit, 20 of 26
      patients (77%) had squamous islands: two unchanged in size, six with increased
      surface area, and 12 newly developed on therapy. Initially, mean fasting gastrin 
      levels rose significantly but then plateaued after 1 month of therapy. Of 10
      patients with gastrin levels for 18 months or longer, only one had a level > or =
      400 pg/ml. CONCLUSIONS: Lansoprazole 60 mg for up to 3 yr was safe and effective 
      in controlling symptoms and esophagitis. The impact on the extent of Barrett's
      esophagus over this time interval was manifested by the extension and development
      of squamous islands.

TI  - Omeprazole 40 mg o.m. combined with amoxycillin alone or with amoxycillin and
      metronidazole in the eradication of Helicobacter pylori.
PG  - 1789-92
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to determine the effect of dual therapy with
      omeprazole and amoxicillin and of triple therapy with omeprazole, amoxicillin,
      and metronidazole in the eradication of Helicobacter pylori (HP) and to study the
      long-term results of eradication in these patients. METHODS: A prospective,
      randomized, controlled trial was performed. Patients who were recruited had
      unequivocal evidence of HP infection based on culture, histology, rapid urease
      test, and Gram's stain of a tissue smear. Eradication was defined as the absence 
      of bacteria in all tests performed on both corpus and antral biopsies. RESULTS:
      The infection was eradicated in 15 of 19 (78.9%) patients randomized to receive
      dual therapy and in 19 of 22 (86.4%) patients who received triple therapy. We
      followed the course of 30 patients in whom HP had been eradicated for a prolonged
      term (up to 12 months). All remained clear of HP. Twenty-five of 28 patients
      (89.3%) with duodenal ulcers in whom HP was successfully eradicated remained
      healed at 12 months. Fewer side effects were reported among patients who received
      the dual therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy with omeprazole and
      amoxicillin with or without metronidazole is effective in the eradication of HP. 
      In particular, the dual therapy regimen with amoxicillin is not only effective
      but is also well tolerated by patients.

      inhibitor, were studied in healthy male volunteers after single (20, 40, and 80
      mg) and repeated oral doses (60 mg, once daily for 7 days) as enteric-coated
      tablet. At the single doses of 20 and 40 mg, intragastric pH was continuously
      monitored in each of two subjects. No abnormal findings definitely attributable
      to the test drug were observed throughout the study. In the single-dose study,
      the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma
      concentration-time curve of TY-11345 increased in a dose-proportional manner. The
      time to reach Cmax was about 3 h after dosing and plasma concentrations declined 
      thereafter with a half-life of about 1 h irrespective of dose. The effect of food
      intake on the pharmacokinetic parameters of TY-11345, which was evaluated at the 
      dose of 40 mg in a cross-over design, was not significant. TY-11345 was not
      detected in urine unchanged, while a main metabolite and its conjugate were
      identified in urine as 32-38% of the dose. An intragastric pH value over 4 was
      obtained about 3 h after the administration of 40 mg and maintained for more than
      5 h, despite the fall of plasma concentration. This effect was less obvious at a 
      dose of 20 mg. In the multiple-dose study, the pharmacokinetics exhibited no
      substantial difference between the first and last doses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT

TI  - Effects of pantoprazole on endocrine function in healthy male volunteers.
PG  - 549-54
AB  - METHOD: In a randomized, double-blind, two-period crossover study, pantoprazole
      40 mg or placebo were given orally to 12 male volunteers for 2 weeks each. There 
      was a wash-out period of at least 1 week between the two treatment periods. The
      effects of pantoprazole or placebo on cortisol and testosterone (primary
      criteria), and tri-iodothyronine, thyroxine, thyroid-stimulating hormone,
      thyronine-binding protein, parathyroid hormone, insulin, glucagon, renin,
      aldosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteotrophic hormone, prolactin and
      somatotrophic hormone were compared. In addition, intragastric 24-h pH, 24-h
      H(+)-activity, and volume of nocturnal gastric juice were determined by gastric
      aspiration technique. RESULTS: Pantoprazole did not influence plasma levels of
      testosterone, circadian cortisol concentrations or plasma cortisol levels after
      exogenous adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation, as compared to placebo (P >
      0.05, Koch's test). Furthermore, there were no clinically relevant changes with
      any of the other endocrine parameters. Pantoprazole significantly increased the
      median 24-h pH (group median 4.3 vs. 1.8; P < 0.001) and decreased 24-h
      H(+)-activity (4.0 vs. 22.6 mmol/L; P < 0.001). The volume of nocturnal gastric
      juice did not significantly differ between the two treatments. Pantoprazole was
      well tolerated and the frequency of adverse events was similar to placebo. No
      drug-related changes in laboratory values were observed. CONCLUSION: Pantoprazole
      did not influence endocrine function in healthy male volunteers during short-term
      treatment.

TI  - Long term treatment with omeprazole 20 mg three days a week or 10 mg daily in the
      prevention of duodenal ulcer relapse.
PG  - 541-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to compare omeprazole 10 mg o.m. (daily)
      with omeprazole 20 mg o.m. on Friday to Sunday inclusive (weekend) in the
      prevention of duodenal ulcer relapse over a 6-month period. METHODS: After an
      open healing phase (4 to 8 weeks) with omeprazole 20 mg o.m., 81 patients entered
      the follow-up phase. Forty-two were randomized in a double-blind double-dummy
      technique, to omeprazole 10 mg o.m., and 39 to omeprazole 20 mg at weekends. At 3
      and 6 months or on symptomatic relapse the patients underwent endoscopy with
      gastric biopsies (quantitative assessment of argyrophilic and gastrin cells),
      symptom evaluation, and laboratory screening with fasting serum gastrin. RESULTS:
      Five patients in the 10 mg group and four in the weekend group were lost to
      follow-up. The estimated relapse rates over six months in the two groups
      receiving 10 mg daily or 20 mg at weekends were 19% and 31%, respectively (95% CI
      of percentage difference: -33% to 8%: intention-to-treat analysis, P = N.S.).
      During the follow-up phase, symptoms tended to be milder in the omeprazole 10 mg 
      daily group compared to the weekend group. Gastrin levels increased significantly
      during the healing phase but then stayed almost constant in the omeprazole 10 mg 
      group, and significantly decreased with weekend treatment. The median number of
      argyrophilic cells showed a slight but statistically significant increase in the 
      omeprazole 10 mg daily group, but did not change in the weekend group. Both the
      healing and long-term therapies were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Our data do not
      show a clear difference between the two treatment regimens, but there was a
      tendency towards a lower recurrence rate with omeprazole 10 mg daily compared
      with 20 mg weekend therapy.

TI  - Amoxycillin capsules with omeprazole for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori. 
      Assessment of the importance of antibiotic dose timing in relation to meals.
PG  - 495-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Giving antibiotics after meals prolongs their gastric residence time 
      and improves their intragastric distribution. We aimed to see whether this would 
      result in improved eradication of Helicobacter pylori. METHODS: Eighty patients
      with H. pylori infection were treated with 40 mg omeprazole in the morning for 28
      days and amoxycillin 500 mg q.d.s. for days 15-28. Amoxycillin dosing was
      randomised to either 1 h before or 10 min after food. Good compliance was
      pre-defined as missing less than four doses of amoxycillin or two of omeprazole. 
      RESULTS: Amoxycillin dosing after meals was shown not to affect H. pylori
      eradication rate either when results were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis
      [amoxycillin before meals successful in 63% (25/40), after in 65% 26/40)] or for 
      good compliers only [before meals 81% (17/21), after 71% (20/28)]. This excludes,
      with 95% confidence, a benefit of greater than 18% from dosing before, or 23%
      from dosing after meals. Good compliance, however, was shown to be important,
      with H. pylori eradication in 76% (37/49) of good compliers compared with 48%
      (11/23) of others completing the protocol (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The timing of 
      antibiotic administration in relation to meals is not important in the treatment 
      of H. pylori infection with this regimen of amoxycillin capsules and omeprazole. 
      Good compliance, is however, an important determinant of treatment success.

TI  - Scintigraphic assessment of the intragastric distribution and gastric emptying of
      an encapsulated drug: the effect of feeding and of a proton pump inhibitor.
PG  - 489-94
AB  - BACKGROUND: Local delivery of therapeutic agents to the stomach may be a useful
      strategy in the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection. We aimed to see
      whether the intragastric distribution and gastric retention of a therapeutic
      agent could be improved, either by giving omeprazole or by dosing after a meal.
      METHODS: Twelve healthy volunteers took part in this double-blind
      placebo-controlled crossover study comparing the effects of omeprazole 20 mg
      twice daily for 5 days with placebo, and the fasted with the fed state, on the
      gastric emptying and intragastric distribution of a soluble scintigrapic marker
      contained in a drug capsule. RESULTS: Dosing after food profoundly prolonged
      gastric residence of the drug label, prolonging mean time to 50% emptying (T50)
      from 0.5 +/- 0.1 h in the fasted state to 2.0 +/- 0.2 h when given after food.
      Food also improved intragastric distribution by increasing delivery to the body
      and fundus. Omeprazole enhanced the effect of food, prolonging T50 to 2.9 +/- 0.3
      h, but had no effect in fasted subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Dosing after food markedly 
      improves the aspects of local drug delivery to the stomach investigated in this
      study, and omeprazole enhances this effect. Post-prandial dosing may, therefore, 
      be useful for improving delivery of some anti-Helicobacter agents.

TI  - Intravenous omeprazole/amoxicillin and omeprazole pretreatment in Helicobacter
      pylori-positive acute peptide ulcer bleeding. A pilot study.
PG  - 880-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aims of this study were to evaluate a Helicobacter pylori
      eradication schedule for H. pylori-positive gastroduodenal ulcer bleeding, which 
      could be commenced intravenously after endoscopic diagnosis, and to assess the
      effect of omeprazole pretreatment on bacterial eradication. METHODS: In a
      prospective study 20 consecutive patients with H. pylori-positive acute peptide
      ulcer bleeding, who were managed conservatively including endoscopic injection
      therapy, were treated with a 2-week regimen consisting of either 40 mg omeprazole
      three times daily (with the exception of the loading dose of 80 mg) and 2 g
      amoxicillin three times daily intravenously for 3 days and 20 mg omeprazole twice
      daily and 1 g amoxicillin twice daily orally for 11 days (n = 10) or only with 40
      mg omeprazole three times daily (with the exception of the loading dose of 80 mg)
      intravenously for 3 days and 20 mg omeprazole twice daily and 1 g amoxicillin
      twice daily orally for 11 days (n = 10). Subsequently, both groups received 20 mg
      omeprazole twice daily orally for 4 weeks. RESULTS: H. pylori eradication,
      defined as negative bacterial findings in urease test, culture and histology, or 
      13C-urea breath test at least 4 weeks after cessation of omeprazole medication,
      was achieved in 100% (10/10) of patients in the first group but only in 30%
      (3/10) of patients in the second group (p < 0.01). Ulcer healing was
      endoscopically confirmed in all but one patient in the second group. CONCLUSIONS:
      For the first time a promising concept for H. pylori eradication in H.
      pylori-positive ulcer bleeding is available by using a combined intravenous and
      oral omeprazole/amoxicillin therapy, which can be started intravenously
      immediately after an emergency upper GI endoscopy. In addition, these data imply 
      that omeprazole pretreatment may not be wise when H. pylori eradication is
      attempted.

TI  - Current diagnosis and treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 867-76
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Original English
      language reports were obtained through a Medline search of the National Library
      of Medicine up to and including 1993. The reference lists of all original reports
      and review articles were searched to locate any further material. In the
      evaluation of therapeutic efficacy, randomized studies were preferentially
      considered; greatest priority was given to double-blind, placebo-controlled
      trials. Abstracts, nonrandomized trials, and non-English language publications
      were considered only when other data were unavailable. RESULTS: Information
      obtained from histories and physical examinations suggests that GERD occurs in
      many patients. Evaluation of mucosal injury with use of either endoscopy or air
      contrast barium radiography is an important early step in the diagnosis of GERD. 
      Endoscopy obtains tissue for histologic study, especially in Barrett's esophagus.
      Prolonged esophageal pH monitoring is the most useful determinant of the presence
      and amount of reflux of acid. Patients with GERD should be counseled on lifestyle
      modification and the use of antacids and antirefluxants. Histamine type 2
      receptor antagonists provide symptomatic relief in 32 to 82% of patients with
      GERD and resolution of verified esophagitis in 0 to 82%. Responses with
      omeprazole therapy are higher; symptomatic responses were noted in 62 to 94% of
      patients, and healing of esophagitis occurred in 71 to 96%. Promotility agents
      and surgical therapy have a role in selected patients. CONCLUSION: GERD is a
      chronic disorder that often necessitates individualized lifelong therapy. Many
      questions remain to be answered about the cost-effectiveness of both diagnostic
      tests and therapy for GERD.

TI  - Effect of short-term cognitive psychotherapy on recurrence of duodenal ulcer: a
      prospective randomized trial.
PG  - 440-8
AB  - The aim of this prospective, randomized trial was to assess whether short-term
      cognitive psychotherapy (10 sessions during 4 months) could reduce the 1-year
      recurrence rate of duodenal ulcer. One group received psychotherapy; one group
      was a control group. One hundred patients, aged 17 to 64 years, with duodenal
      ulcer were selected from March 1989 to May 1991. The main outcome measure was
      relapse of duodenal ulcer, which was verified by endoscopy. When psychotherapy
      started after cessation of antiulcer medication, the relapse-free time was
      significantly shorter in the therapy group than in the controls. When the
      protocol was modified so that psychotherapy and antiulcer medication were given
      concomitantly, there was no significant difference in recurrence rate between the
      groups at 1-year follow-up (84% in the therapy group and 92% in the control
      group). Symptoms of upper abdominal discomfort/pain, measured every second month,
      decreased significantly in the therapy group compared to the control group.
      Psychotherapy led to less neuroticism (Eysenck Personality Questionnaire) and
      less trait anxiety (Spielberger Trait Anxiety Scale) compared to controls at 4
      months. At the 12-month follow-up, most of this gain was lost, but the
      psychotherapy group had lower scores on "concern about disapproval" on the
      Sociotropy-Autonomy Scale than the control group. There is no beneficial effect
      of short-term cognitive psychotherapy on the 1-year recurrence rate of duodenal
      ulcer.

TI  - Lansoprazole. A reappraisal of its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic
      properties, and its therapeutic efficacy in acid-related disorders.
PG  - 404-30
AB  - Lansoprazole is a benzimidazole derivative that effectively decreases gastric
      acid secretion, regardless of the primary stimulus, via inhibition of gastric
      H+,K(+)-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase). It provides effective symptom relief
      and healing of peptic ulcer and reflux oesophagitis after 4 to 8 weeks of therapy
      and appears to prevent recurrence of lesions when administered as maintenance
      therapy. When administered at therapeutic dosages, lansoprazole produced higher
      healing rates than ranitidine or famotidine in patients with duodenal and gastric
      ulcers. Lansoprazole heals duodenal ulcers more rapidly than ranitidine or
      famotidine. Relief of ulcer symptoms in lansoprazole recipients is at least
      equivalent to, and tends to be more rapid than, that in patients receiving
      histamine H2-receptor antagonists. In comparisons with omeprazole 20 mg/day,
      lansoprazole 30 mg/day produced duodenal ulcer healing more rapidly and reduced
      ulcer pain to a greater extent at 2 weeks, but overall healing rates were similar
      after 4 weeks of therapy. At therapeutic dosages, lansoprazole produces superior 
      healing and symptom relief of reflux oesophagitis in comparison with ranitidine, 
      and it tends to relieve heartburn more effectively than omeprazole, although both
      agents produce equivalent healing. Healing of peptic ulcers or reflux
      oesophagitis refractory to histamine H2-receptor antagonists occurs after 8 weeks
      in the majority of patients treated with lansoprazole, and lansoprazole and
      omeprazole demonstrate similar efficacy in patients with refractory peptic
      ulcers. In patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, lansoprazole effectively
      controls mean basal gastric acid output. Lansoprazole is generally well tolerated
      in clinical trials. The incidence of adverse effects is similar to that of
      omeprazole, ranitidine and famotidine in comparative studies. Combination therapy
      with lansoprazole and antibacterial agents such as amoxicillin, tinidazole,
      roxithromycin and/or metronidazole appears to eradicate Helicobacter pylori in 22
      to 80% of patients with this organism. Limited data also suggest that
      lansoprazole may have superior activity against H. pylori in comparison with
      omeprazole, although the clinical relevance of this preliminary finding requires 
      further confirmation. Thus, lansoprazole may be considered as alternative to
      existing antisecretory agents available for the treatment of acid-related
      disorders, particularly because it may provide more rapid healing and relief of
      symptoms.

TI  - Long-term treatment with omeprazole for refractory reflux esophagitis: efficacy
      and safety.
PG  - 161-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of omeprazole in
      patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease resistant to treatment with
      histamine-2 (H2)-receptor antagonists. DESIGN: Cohort analytic study with a mean 
      follow-up of 48 months (range, 36 to 64 months). SETTING: Patients receiving
      ambulatory care from referral centers. PATIENTS: 91 patients with
      gastroesophageal reflux disease resistant to treatment with an H2-receptor
      antagonist but subsequently responsive to 40 mg of omeprazole daily.
      INTERVENTION: Open maintenance therapy consisting of 20 mg of omeprazole daily in
      86 patients and 40 mg daily in 5 patients. OUTCOME MEASURES: Endoscopy to assess 
      healing; side effects, laboratory values, fasting serum gastrin level, and
      gastric corpus biopsies to assess safety. RESULTS: Esophagitis recurred in 47% of
      the patients receiving 20 mg of omeprazole daily, but all rehealed after the dose
      was doubled. Seven of 40 patients (18%) had a second relapse after a mean
      follow-up time of 24 months (range, 9 to 36 months) that was successfully treated
      with a further 20-mg dose increment for a mean period of 36 months (range, 6 to
      39 months). Median gastrin levels increased initially from 60 ng/L before study
      entry to 162 ng/L (P < 0.01) with treatment and reached a plateau during
      maintenance treatment. Very high gastrin levels (> 500 ng/L) were observed in a
      subgroup (11%) of patients. The incidence of micronodular hyperplasia increased
      from 2.5% of the patients at first biopsy to 20% at the last biopsy (P = 0.001), 
      with a corresponding progression of gastritis to subatrophic or atrophic
      gastritis from less than 1% to 25% (P < 0.001), which was more pronounced in
      patients with very high serum gastrin levels. CONCLUSIONS: Maintenance therapy
      with omeprazole was effective for at least 5 years in patients with
      gastroesophageal reflux disease resistant to treatment with H2-receptor
      antagonists. Treatment was accompanied by a persistent increase in serum gastrin 
      levels and an increase of micronodular argyrophil cell hyperplasia and
      subatrophic or atrophic gastritis.

TI  - Review article: Helicobacter pylori eradication--understandable caution but no
      excuse for inertia.
PG  - 369-89
AB  - The long-term management of patients with peptic ulcer disease is unsatisfactory,
      as judged by the persistently high levels of haemorrhage, perforation and death
      from this condition in Western countries. Although ulcer recurrence and
      complications can be prevented, many patients with peptic ulcer disease fail to
      receive the benefits of modern therapeutic regimens. In recent years, eradication
      of Helicobactor pylori has been promoted as a 'cure' for peptic ulcer disease
      and, while such claims are premature, there can be little doubt that this
      treatment--when successful--dramatically improves the medium-term prognosis of
      ulcer patients. However, in general, clinicians have given this promising
      therapeutic advance a lukewarm welcome. The aim of this detailed review of the
      literature is to remove the uncertainty and confusion surrounding many aspects of
      eradication therapy. Estimates are provided of the eradication rates after either
      triple therapy or the combination of omeprazole plus amoxycillin, and the sources
      of variation in published studies are discussed. Problems associated with
      eradication therapy, including side effects, compliance and re-infection, are
      addressed in order to ascertain the extent and clinical significance of each
      factor. In addition, studies reporting the outcome of patients with peptic ulcer 
      disease after eradication are assessed with reference to both ulcer recurrence
      and complications. The result of the review is to dissipate much of the
      scepticism concerning eradication therapy. However, whilst acknowledging the
      efficacy of eradication therapy, its limitations have also to be recognized. By
      itself, it does not provide the complete answer to peptic ulcer disease. For some
      ulcer patients, eradication therapy is the preferred option; for others,
      prophylactic therapy with H2-receptor antagonists is more suitable. Guidelines
      are proposed for the selection of patients for each alternative therapy. The
      crucial point is that patients with peptic ulcer--excluding the small proportion 
      with a mild form of the disease--require positive, long-term management
      consisting of either continuous prophylaxis with H2-receptor antagonists or the
      eradication of Helicobacter pylori.

TI  - Serum gastrin levels following administration of omeprazole alone or in
      combination with pirenzepine.
PG  - 398-402
AB  - Serum gastrin levels in 44 peptic ulcer patients (26 gastric ulcer patients and
      18 duodenal ulcer patients) were determined after they had been treated with
      omeprazole (OPZ) (20 mg/day) alone or in combination with pirenzepine (PZP) (100 
      mg/day). Serum gastrin levels were measured before, as well as 2, 4, and 6 weeks 
      after administration, and the changes were compared. The levels were
      significantly elevated (twofold) at 2 weeks of treatment in both the OPZ and OPZ 
      plus PZP groups. In patients taking OPZ alone, the levels rose up to 6 weeks,
      while in those taking OPZ plus PZP the levels decreased at 4 and 6 weeks. At 4
      weeks, serum gastrin levels in the OPZ plus PZP group were lower (although not
      significantly) than those in patients taking OPZ alone. In gastric ulcer
      patients, serum gastrin levels in the OPZ group were significantly elevated,
      while in the OPZ plus PZP group, these levels were only slightly, but not
      significantly elevated. There was no significant difference between the two
      gastric ulcer groups at any time. In duodenal ulcer patients, serum gastrin
      levels increased significantly at 2 weeks of treatment in both groups. At 4 weeks
      and thereafter, the serum gastrin levels remained significantly high in patients 
      taking OPZ alone, while they decreased at both 4 and 6 weeks in patients taking
      OPZ plus PZP. Thus, serum gastrin levels in duodenal ulcer patients were markedly
      decreased by the addition of PZP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Bismuth-free triple therapy for eradicating Helicobacter pylori and reducing the 
      gastric ulcer recurrence rate.
PG  - 1032-5
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The goals of this study were to assess the effectiveness of a new
      triple therapy consisting of amoxicillin and metronidazole with plaunotol in the 
      eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection in humans, and to determine whether 
      this treatment regimen reduces the rate of recurrence of gastric ulcer in
      patients infected with H. pylori, without instituting maintenance therapy with
      H2-receptor antagonists. METHODS: Thirty patients with active gastric ulcer who
      were infected with H. pylori were first treated with omeprazole until scarring
      occurred. Patients then received plaunotol for 4 wk, with amoxicillin and
      metronidazole for 7 days. RESULTS: This triple therapy resulted in the safe
      eradication of H. pylori in 26 (86.7%) of 30 patients, with no recurrence of
      ulcer seen during a 12-month follow-up period in patients who tested negative for
      the presence of H. pylori. In addition, histological inflammatory changes
      improved in these patients. Of the four patients with persistent H. pylori
      infection, in three (75%), ulcers recurred. CONCLUSION: This new triple therapy
      was very effective in eradicating H. pylori in infected patients and in reducing 
      the rate of recurrence of gastric ulcer in these patients.

TI  - Causal role of Helicobacter pylori in peptic ulcer relapse.
PG  - 134-8
AB  - Helicobacter pylori has been shown to infect the gastric mucous layer of almost
      all patients with duodenal ulcer disease, as well as that of most patients with
      gastric ulcer disease. Recent studies have suggested that the eradication of H.
      pylori affects the natural history of duodenal ulcer disease such that the rate
      of relapse decreases markedly. We evaluated the relationship between H. pylori
      infection and peptic ulcer relapse in a Japanese population following a
      prospective study. Seven of 18 (38.9%) gastric ulcer patients positive for H.
      pylori relapsed by the end of 1 year, whereas only 1 of 9 (11.1%) gastric ulcer
      patients without H. pylori developed ulcer relapse (P < 0.05). Relapse rates of
      duodenal ulcer patients negative for H. pylori were significantly lower than
      those positive for H. pylori within 1 year (0% vs 66.7%; P < 0.01). The effects
      of anti-H. pylori drugs on the eradication of H. pylori were examined in 50
      patients with peptic ulcers. Eradication rates with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI)
      alone (omeprazole 20 mg) showed the lowest values (4 of 13; 30.8%). The rates
      were: 44.4% for amoxicillin alone (4 of 9); 70% for triple therapy consisting of 
      amoxicillin, metronidazole, and bismuth subnitrate (14 of 20); and 87.5% for
      concomitant therapy of the PPI plus amoxicillin (7 of 8). Reinfection rates of H.
      pylori within 1 year after eradication of this organism were distinctly higher in
      the PPI alone group (80%) than in other groups (18.2%-32.4%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED

PG  - 72-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of eradication of Helicobacter
      pylori(H.pylori) in the patients with duodenal ulcer(Du) upon the DU recurrence. 
      METHODS: This study was performed for 190 patients with DU. Four different
      methods-microscopy of Gram stained mucosal smear, specific culture, biopsy urease
      test, histology of H &E staining-were taken for identifying colonization of H.
      pylori before treatment, and for finding the eradication of H. pylori 4 weeks
      after completion of therapy in each treatment group (cometidine, omeprazole,
      colloidal bismuth subcitrate(CBS), CBS and metronidazole double therapy, CBS,
      metronidazole and amoxicillin triple therapy). To detect DU recurrence, the
      gastroscopy was performed at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after therapy. RESULTS: The
      eradication rate of the cimetidine group the omeprazole group, and the CBS group 
      were 0%, 7.7%, 0%, respectively, and that of the double therapy group and the
      triple therapy group were 44.4% and 89.3%, respectively. Seventy three patients
      who were followed up for 2 years were categorized into two groups according to
      the eradication of H. pylori. The recurrence rate was 3.2% both in 1 year and 2
      years later in the former group-one consisting of 31 patients with H. pylori
      eradicated, while the recurrence rate was 57.1% in 1 year and 78.6% in 2 years
      later, in the latter group-the other of 42 patients with H. pylori not
      eradicated. CONCLUSION: The eradication of H. pylori in patients with DU reduces 
      the recurrence of DU.

TI  - NSAID-induced peptic ulcer disease: a critical review of pathogenesis and
      management.
PG  - 210-22
AB  - Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) initiate gastroduodenal ulceration 
      and promote complications such as bleeding and perforation. Age greater than 60
      years, a prior history of ulcer disease, and concomitant corticosteroid use are
      important risk factors for ulcer development. NSAIDs interfere with mucosal
      defense via direct toxic effects in addition to cyclooxygenase inhibition and
      subsequent depletion of endogenous prostaglandins. While all NSAIDs are
      ulcerogenic, drugs which avoid topical injury and do not inhibit mucosal
      prostaglandins appear to have lesser risk of toxicity. Although NSAID injury
      requires luminal acid, prophylactic use of H2 receptor antagonists has been
      disappointing, preventing duodenal injury only. Greater acid suppression with
      proton pump inhibition appears promising. Prostaglandins are effective for
      prevention of NSAID-induced gastroduodenal injury, but are not well tolerated.
      Recent evidence suggests NSAID ulcers heal rapidly with proton pump inhibitors
      compared to H2 receptor antagonists in those patients who require continued NSAID
      therapy.

TI  - A pharmacodynamic study of two omeprazole regimens suitable for long-term
      treatment of duodenal ulcer.
PG  - 488-92
AB  - BACKGROUND: The experience with long-term treatment of peptic ulcer with
      omeprazole is still scant, but the possibility cannot be excluded that its better
      pharmacodynamic effect on gastric acidity also has a positive result in the
      relapse rate. Moreover, this drug acts via a mechanism other than receptorial
      binding, and therefore its efficacy should not dissipate with time. This study
      was carried out to assess the pharmacodynamic properties and the possible changes
      with time of two dose regimens of omeprazole that could be suitable for long-term
      treatment in duodenal ulcer. METHODS: Twenty patients with endoscopically proven 
      duodenal ulcer were studied by means of 24-h gastric pH-metry both in basal
      conditions and on the 5th day of acute treatment with 40 mg omeprazole in the
      morning. All the ulcers healed after 4 weeks, and thereafter 10 patients were
      randomized to receive orally 20 mg omeprazole daily at 0800 h in single-blind
      fashion (group A) and 10 to receive 20 mg omeprazole every other day (group B)
      for up to 6 months. At the end of the 1st, 3rd, and 6th month of these
      maintenance treatments 24-h gastric pH-metry was repeated to assess the
      antisecretory effect of each regimen over time. In group-B patients the test was 
      performed on 2 consecutive days (without and with medication) at each time
      interval. The fasting gastrin values were also determined. The patients underwent
      esophagogastroduodenoscopy every 2 months. RESULTS: Three patients in group B
      were lost to follow-up for various reasons, and only seven remained eligible for 
      final analysis. The two long-term regimens of omeprazole were able to increase
      significantly pH values (p < 0.02-0.001) and the times spent at and above pH 3.0 
      (p < 0.001) over 24 h compared with basal conditions. In group A the 24-h pH
      value obtained in the 6th month was higher (p < 0.02) than that in the 3rd month 
      of maintenance treatment. In group B the pharmacologic effect tended to decrease 
      on the day without medication compared with the day with medication, but the
      difference between them was significantly (p < 0.05) only at the 6-month
      interval. There was no significant difference between the gastrin levels of the
      two groups in the long-term treatment. No ulcer relapse was detected at any
      long-term endoscopic control in the two groups of patients. CONCLUSIONS: The two 
      omeprazole regimens we tested are effective in reducing gastric acidity, and
      their pharmacodynamic action does not decrease with time. They are therefore
      suitable for maintenance treatment in acid-related disorders.

TI  - Effect of omeprazole and sucralfate on prepyloric gastric ulcer. A double blind
      comparative trial and one year follow up.
PG  - 837-40
AB  - This study compared healing rates, relief of symptoms, frequency of adverse
      events, and proportion of patients in remission after one year follow up in 104
      patients with active prepyloric ulcer during treatment with 40 mg omeprazole once
      daily or 2 g sucralfate twice daily, using a randomised double blind controlled
      trial. Healing rates after two, four, and six weeks were (omeprazole/sucralfate) 
      49%/23%; 83%/59%; 90%/70% respectively. After two weeks, omeprazole was more
      efficient than sucralfate in relief of daytime and nocturnal epigastric pain,
      nausea, and heartburn. The proportion of patients in remission after one year
      follow up was significantly higher in the omeprazole group (p < 0.01). Of the
      healed patients ulcers recurred in 36% in the omeprazole group and in 46% in the 
      sucralfate group. It is concluded that the ulcer healing rate was higher and
      symptom relief was more pronounced in the omeprazole group compared with the
      sucralfate group, and that more patients were still in remission after a one year
      follow up period.

TI  - Omeprazole v ranitidine for prevention of relapse in reflux oesophagitis. A
      controlled double blind trial of their efficacy and safety.
PG  - 590-8
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare recurrence rates of reflux oesophagitis
      (after endoscopic healing with omeprazole) over a 12 month period of randomised, 
      double blind, maintenance treatment with either daily omeprazole (20 mg every
      morning; n = 53), weekend omeprazole (20 mg on three consecutive days a week, n =
      55) or daily ranitidine (150 mg twice daily, n = 51). Patients were assessed for 
      relapse by endoscopy (with gastric biopsy) at six and 12 months, or in the event 
      of symptomatic recurrence, and serum gastrin was monitored. At 12 months, the
      estimated proportions of patients in remission (actuarial life table method) were
      89% when receiving daily omeprazole compared with 32% when receiving weekend
      omeprazole (difference 57%, p < 0.001, 95% confidence intervals: 42% to 71%) and 
      25% when receiving daily ranitidine (difference 64%, p < 0.001, 95% confidence
      intervals: 50% to 78%). Median gastrin concentrations increased slightly during
      the healing phase, but remained within the normal range and did not change during
      maintenance treatment. No significant pathological findings were noted, and no
      adverse events were attributable to the study treatments. In conclusion, for
      patients who respond favourably to acute treatment with omeprazole 20 mg every
      morning, the drug is a safe and highly effective maintenance treatment for
      preventing relapse of reflux oesophagitis and its associated symptoms over 12
      months. By contrast, weekend omeprazole and daily ranitidine were ineffective.

TI  - Clinical review of lansoprazole.
PG  - 48-55; discussion 56-7
AB  - Lansoprazole is an inhibitor of gastric H+,K(+)-ATPase, commonly referred to as
      the 'proton pump'. The pharmacodynamic effect of proton pump inhibition is to
      reduce gastric acid secretion. Long experience with H2 antagonists and more
      recently proton pump inhibitors has demonstrated the value of reducing gastric
      acid secretion in conditions where acid plays a key role in the pathogenesis of
      gastrointestinal inflammation and ulceration. The pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics and clinical safety of lansoprazole are discussed elsewhere in
      this supplement, and so this review will focus upon the European and American
      experience of the efficacy of lansoprazole in the treatment of peptic ulceration 
      and gastro-oesophageal reflux.

TI  - Omeprazole in the treatment of asthmatics with nocturnal symptoms and
      gastro-oesophageal reflux: a placebo-controlled cross-over study.
PG  - 350-4
AB  - Eleven adult patients with nocturnal asthma, and gastro-oesophageal reflux
      documented by endoscopy or ambulatory oesophageal pH monitoring completed a
      double-blind cross-over study (4 week treatment, one week run-in and cross-over
      periods) comparing the effects of omeprazole 20 mg daily and placebo on asthma
      control assessed by symptoms, peak expiratory flow rate and bronchodilator usage.
      Omeprazole treatment did not improve asthma symptoms during the day or night, or 
      peak expiratory flow rate readings. There was no difference in bronchodilator
      inhaler usage during omeprazole therapy. Treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux
      with omeprazole in patients with nocturnal asthma and gastro-oesophageal reflux
      does not improve asthma symptoms or peak expiratory flow rate. This suggests that
      gastro-oesophageal reflux does not exacerbate bronchoconstriction in nocturnal
      asthma.

PG  - 1346-8
AB  - PCR was performed for the detection of Helicobacter pylori in feces from 24
      patients with proven infections. Several precautions were taken to overcome
      possible inhibition of PCR with feces. In the first 12 patients, feces were
      examined shortly after endoscopy. In another group of 12 patients, who were
      treated during 2 weeks with omeprazole (40 mg each day) to increase gastric pH,
      feces were examined as well. H. pylori target DNA could not be detected in the
      stools of any of the 24 infected patients. It was concluded that there was no
      substantial shedding of H. pylori in feces from either group of patients.

TI  - Effect of omeprazole on intragastric bacterial counts, nitrates, nitrites, and
      N-nitroso compounds.
PG  - 455-60
AB  - Previous studies have suggested that profound inhibition of gastric acid
      secretion may increase exposure to potentially carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds. 
      The aim of this study was to find out if the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole (20
      mg daily) is associated with increased concentrations of potentially carcinogenic
      N-nitroso compounds in gastric juice. The volume of gastric contents, number of
      bacteria, and concentrations of nitrates, nitrites, and N-nitroso compounds was
      determined in gastric aspirates obtained after an overnight fast in 14 healthy
      volunteers (7M:7F) after one week of treatment with placebo, and one and two
      weeks' treatment with omeprazole. Median bacterial concentrations were 1.0 x
      10(4) (range 5.0 x 10(3)-5.0 x 10(6)) colony forming units (CFU)/ml after one
      weeks' treatment with placebo and increased significantly to 4.0 x 10(5) (0-3.3 x
      10(7)) CFU/ml after two weeks' treatment with omeprazole (p < 0.05). A similar
      increase was seen in the concentration of nitrate reducing bacteria. There was no
      difference in the volume of gastric aspirates after treatment with omeprazole
      when compared with placebo (65 (29-155) ml v 42 (19-194) ml). The concentration
      of N-nitroso compounds was 0.13 (0-1.0) mumol/l after two weeks of omeprazole,
      which was not significantly different from that seen with placebo (0.15 (0-0.61) 
      mumol/l). There was also no increase in the concentrations of nitrates or
      nitrites. It is concluded that omeprazole (20 mg once daily) for two weeks in
      healthy volunteers is associated with gastric bacterial proliferation but does
      not increase concentrations of N-nitroso compounds.

TI  - Omeprazole for the treatment of posterior laryngitis.
PG  - 321-6
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether the patients with refractory posterior laryngitis
      respond to treatment with omeprazole. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixteen consecutive
      patients with persistent posterior laryngitis despite prior therapy with H2
      blockers were recruited from outpatient university otolaryngology and
      gastroenterology practices. Patients received 6 to 24 weeks of omeprazole 40 mg
      qhs, which was increased to 40 mg twice a day for 6 weeks in four patients with
      continuing symptoms. Laryngoscopy, esophagoscopy, and esophageal/laryngeal
      symptom questionnaire were completed at entry to the study. Laryngoscopy and the 
      questionnaire were repeated at the conclusion of the study. A follow-up
      questionnaire was completed at 6 weeks. RESULTS: Laryngoscopy scores improved
      from 4.44 to 1.94 (nonblinded otolaryngologist) and 4.31 to 1.88 (blinded
      otolaryngologist) (P < 0.05). Laryngeal and esophageal symptom indices improved
      from 13.94 and 9.00 to 3.00 and 0.38, respectively (P < 0.05). Symptom indices
      increased to 7.00 and 7.33, respectively, after the discontinuation of therapy (P
      < 0.05 compared with the conclusion of the study). One patient intolerant of
      omeprazole underwent fundoplication and was asymptomatic 6 weeks after surgery.
      Only 3 patients had esophagitis at entry. CONCLUSIONS: The signs and symptoms of 
      posterior laryngitis improve with the administration of omeprazole and symptoms
      recur after discontinuation of therapy, suggesting that reflux is the underlying 
      etiology. Patients with refractory symptoms, but intolerant of omeprazole, may

      are often subtle, and many patients with posterior laryngitis do not have
      esophagitis.

TI  - Short report: omeprazole-tetracycline combinations are inadequate as therapy for 
      Helicobacter pylori infection.
PG  - 259-62
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current triple antimicrobial therapies cure Helicobacter pylori
      infection in 60-90% of cases but are cumbersome. Addition of omeprazole to
      amoxycillin has been shown to enhance effectiveness when compared to amoxycillin 
      alone. METHOD: We studied omeprazole 20 mg t.d.s. plus tetracycline 500 mg q.d.s.
      for 14 days (OMP/TCN) and omeprazole 40 mg in the morning plus tetracycline 500
      mg q.d.s. along with bismuth subsalicylate tablets 2 q.d.s. (OMP/TCN/BSS) for 14 
      days. Forty-four patients (19 OMP/TCN, 25 OMP/TCN/BSS) with H. pylori peptic
      ulcer disease were studied. H. pylori status was evaluated at least 4 weeks after
      ending antimicrobial therapy. RESULTS: In the OMP/TCN group cure of H. pylori
      infection was achieved in 5/19 (26%). Adding bismuth to the regimen improved the 
      results; 4 weeks after ending therapy cure of H. pylori infection was achieved in
      12/25 (48%). CONCLUSIONS: Neither regimen can be recommended for routine cure of 
      H. pylori infection. Although one cannot predict which antimicrobial therapies
      will be enhanced by the addition of omeprazole, these data suggest that future
      studies should evaluate drugs whose effectiveness is compromised by low pH.

TI  - Rapid healing of gastric ulcers with lansoprazole.
PG  - 215-20
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lansoprazole is a new proton pump inhibitor which powerfully
      decreases acid secretion. METHODS: We compared the efficacy and short-term safety
      of lansoprazole against ranitidine in the healing of gastric ulcer. This was a
      parallel group, comparative multicentre, prospectively randomized, double-blind
      study which included 250 patients with gastric ulcer, 219 of whom had follow-up
      endoscopic data. RESULTS: Both lansoprazole 30 mg and 60 mg daily produced
      significantly more rapid healing of gastric ulcer than ranitidine 300 mg nightly 
      with healing rates after 4 weeks of 78% (P < 0.05), 84% (P < 0.01) and 61%,
      respectively. After 8 weeks, the corresponding healing rates were 99%, 97% and
      91% (P = 0.08). Symptom relief was similar for all treatment groups, but fewer
      antacids were used by patients receiving lansoprazole. Sixty-nine patients
      experienced 91 adverse events; the incidence, pattern and severity was similar
      across all three treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Lansoprazole 30 mg and 60 mg once
      daily had similar efficacy. Both were superior to ranitidine 300 mg nocte in
      healing gastric ulcer. The short-term safety profile of lansoprazole was similar 
      to ranitidine. These data indicate that lansoprazole should be used at a dose of 
      30 mg once daily for the treatment of gastric ulcers.

TI  - Review article: drug therapy for reflux oesophagitis.
PG  - 147-57
AB  - Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease is a common disorder and symptoms can be mild
      to severe. Management of the disease should be individualized. Life-style changes
      are important for all patients. Drug therapy is often necessary but only very few
      patients with severe disease need surgical treatment. The purpose of this article
      is to focus on drug therapy and to review the clinical trials of all the drugs
      used for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Thereafter, judged solely on the data
      derived from these trials, a practical approach to the management of
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease is suggested.

TI  - Omeprazole treatment of chronic duodenal ulceration.
PG  - 50-1
AB  - Omeprazole, a substituted benzimidazole, is an acid pump inhibitor, introduced
      for treatment of chronic duodenal ulceration. In a study of 116 patients with
      endoscopically documented chronic duodenal ulcers, omeprazole affected healing in
      77 (66.3%) patients after two weeks and 106 (91.4%) patients after four weeks,
      with symptoms relief in 102 (88%) patients within the first week of treatment.
      There was significantly higher healing rate in females (p < 0.05) and diffuse
      ulceration rather than single ulcers (p < 0.05). In meta-analysis comparing
      omeprazole to other antiulcer drugs reported in this country, there was a
      significant higher healing rate (p < 0.01) and symptom relief (p < 0.01) in
      favour of omeprazole. It proved to be effective and safe for the short term
      treatment of chronic duodenal ulceration.

TI  - Comparison of omeprazole and histamine H2-receptor antagonists in the treatment
      of elderly and young patients with reflux oesophagitis.
PG  - 121-6
AB  - Retrospective analyses of two multicentre clinical trials were carried out to
      examine the association of age with endoscopically verified reflux oesophagitis
      lesions and symptoms before and after 4 or, if necessary, 8 weeks randomized
      double-blind treatment with omeprazole (20 mg o.m.) or histamine H2-receptor
      antagonists (H2RA) (cimetidine 400 mg q.d.s. or ranitidine 150 mg b.d.). Of the
      elderly patients (> or = 65 years) 79 received omeprazole, 39 cimetidine and 36
      ranitidine; of the young patients (< 65 years) 200 received omeprazole, 94
      cimetidine and 102 ranitidine. The objective of treatment was to heal the
      oesophagus and to relieve the patient's symptoms. On completion of the studies
      the proportion of elderly omeprazole-treated patients (68%) healed and
      symptom-free was nearly three times that of elderly H2RA-treated patients (23%, p
      < 0.001). In the young patient group the proportion of omeprazole-treated
      patients (57%) both healed and symptom-free was nearly twice that of H2RA-treated
      patients (29%, p < 0.001). The advantage of omeprazole over H2RA, in terms of
      endoscopic healing and symptom relief, is at least as great in elderly patients
      as in younger patients.

TI  - Omeprazole versus ranitidine plus somatostatin in the treatment of severe
      gastroduodenal bleeding: a prospective, randomized, controlled trial.
PG  - 72-4
AB  - In a randomized, controlled clinical trial omeprazole was compared with
      ranitidine plus somatostatin in the treatment of severe acute gastrointestinal
      bleeding due to peptic pathology. Intravenous infusion of the drugs was
      administered until clinical stabilization or surgical operation. The two regimens
      were equally effective in controlling bleeding. The need for blood transfusion
      and surgical operation together with the mortality rate did not differ
      significantly between groups. No toxic effects were observed as a result of the
      infusion of omeprazole. In this study the infusion of omeprazole alone showed an 
      efficacy comparable to the association of ranitidine and somatostatin in the
      treatment of severe acute peptic bleeding.

TI  - Duodenal ulcer healing by eradication of Helicobacter pylori without anti-acid
      treatment: randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 508-10
AB  - Randomised trials have shown that duodenal ulcers treated by H2 blockers heal
      faster if Helicobacter pylori is eradicated concurrently. It remains unknown
      whether eradication of H pylori without suppression of acid-secretion, is
      sufficient to allow healing. 153 patients with H pylori infection and duodenal
      ulcer were randomised to receive either a 1-week course of bismuth subcitrate,
      tetracycline, and metronidazole (76), or omeprazole for 4 weeks with the same
      three-drug regimen for the first week (77). Endoscopy and antral biopsies were
      done at entry and 4 weeks after treatment. 132 patients were suitable for
      analysis. Duodenal ulcers healed in 60 (92%; 95% CI 86-100%) patients taking
      bismuth, tetracycline, and metronidazole compared with 63 (95%; 88-100%) taking
      omeprazole in addition to the three other drugs. H pylori was eradicated in 61
      (94%; 88-100%) who received only three drugs compared with 66 (98%; 96-100%) who 
      received omeprazole as well. Symptoms were reduced more effectively during the
      first week in patients who received omeprazole (p = 0.003). We conclude that a
      1-week regimen of bismuth, tetracycline, and metronidazole for patients with H
      pylori and duodenal ulcer eradicates the organism and heals the ulcer in most
      patients. Concurrent administration of omeprazole reduces ulcer pain more rapidly
      but has no effect on ulcer healing.

TI  - One-year follow-up of duodenal ulcers after 1-wk triple therapy for Helicobacter 
      pylori.
PG  - 199-202
AB  - OBJECTIVE: to study the ulcer recurrence rate of Helicobacter pylori-positive
      duodenal ulcers at 1 yr after eradication of the bacteria by triple therapy.
      METHOD: Patients with H. pylori-positive duodenal ulcers were randomized to
      receive either triple therapy for 1 wk plus omeprazole for 4 wk (Triple+OMP) (n =
      78), or omeprazole alone (OMP) for 4 wk (N = 77). Patients were followed up every
      3 months for symptom enquiry. At 1 yr, all asymptomatic patients were invited to 
      attend for gastroscopy. RESULTS: At 8 wk, 16 patients in the OMP group and four
      in the Triple+OMP group had an ulcer. During the 1-yr period, 12 patients in the 
      OMP group and no patient in the Triple+OMP group developed symptomatic ulcers. At
      follow-up endoscopy at 1 yr, another 10 ulcers were detected in the OMP group and
      two in the Triple+OMP group. Fifteen patients in the OMP group and 13 in the
      Triple+OMP group were lost to follow-up. In total, ulcers were detected in 39 of 
      61 (64%) assessable patients in the OMP group, and in six of 65 (9%) assessable
      patients in the Triple+OMP group after 1 yr (chi 2 test: p < 0.001). Of the
      patients whose H. pylori were successfully eradicated by Triple+OMP at 8 wk, 90% 
      remained H. pylori negative at 1 yr. CONCLUSION: Triple therapy for 1 wk
      eradicates H. pylori infection and significantly reduces duodenal ulcer relapses.

TI  - Short report: treatment of gastric ulcer with lansoprazole or ranitidine: a
      multicentre clinical trial.
PG  - 119-22
AB  - We studied the effectiveness of lansoprazole and ranitidine in promoting gastric 
      ulcer healing in a multicentre double-blind trial, by comparing the proportion of
      healed ulcers after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. One hundred and fifty-eight
      patients were randomly given either ranitidine (150 mg each morning and at
      bedtime) or lansoprazole (30 mg each morning and placebo at bedtime). One hundred
      and twenty-eight patients completed the trial (62 taking lansoprazole, 66 taking 
      ranitidine). Fifty-one (80%) of those treated with lansoprazole and forty-two
      (62%) of those treated with ranitidine had healed ulcers at 4 weeks (P < 0.05).
      Sixty-one (98%) patients who received lansoprazole and 57 (86%) who received
      ranitidine had healed ulcers at 8 weeks (P < 0.05). The observed differences were
      not significant in the intention-to-treat analysis. No serious adverse event was 
      reported with lansoprazole.

TI  - Duodenal bacterial overgrowth during treatment in outpatients with omeprazole.
PG  - 23-6
AB  - The extent of duodenal bacterial overgrowth during the pronounced inhibition of
      acid secretion that occurs with omeprazole treatment is unknown. The bacterial
      content of duodenal juice of patients treated with omeprazole was therefore
      examined in a controlled prospective study. Duodenal juice was obtained under
      sterile conditions during diagnostic upper endoscopy. Aspirates were plated
      quantitatively for anaerobic and aerobic organisms. Twenty five outpatients with 
      peptic ulcer disease were investigated after a 5.7 (0.5) weeks (mean (SEM))
      treatment course with 20 mg (nine patients) or 40 mg (16 patients). The control
      group consisted of 15 outpatients referred for diagnostic endoscopy without prior
      antisecretory treatment. No patient in the control group had duodenal bacterial
      overgrowth. In the omeprazole group bacterial overgrowth (> or = 10(5) cfu/ml)
      was found in 14 (56%) patients (p = 0.0003). The number of bacteria (log10) in
      duodenal juice in patients treated with omeprazole was distinctly higher (median 
      5.7; range < 2-8.7) when compared with the control group (median < 2; range <
      2-5.0; p = 0.0004). As well as orally derived bacteria, faecal type bacteria were
      found in seven of 14 and anaerobic bacteria in three of 14 patients. Bacterial
      overgrowth was similar with the two doses of omeprazole. These results indicate
      that duodenal bacterial overgrowth of both oral and faecal type bacteria occurs
      often in ambulatory patients treated with omeprazole. Further studies are needed 
      to determine the clinical significance of these findings, particularly in high
      risk groups during long term treatment with omeprazole.

TI  - Evidence for the essential role of Helicobacter pylori in gastric ulcer disease.
PG  - 19-22
AB  - Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) eradication heals chronic active type B gastritis 
      and dramatically changes the natural history of duodenal ulcer disease. There are
      few data concerning the role of anti-H pylori treatment in gastric ulcer disease.
      A total of 83 patients presenting with H pylori positive active gastric ulcer
      disease were treated with omeprazole and antibiotics (amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin,
      roxithromycin) in seven different clinical protocols, each of which included the 
      attempt to eradicate H pylori infection and to evaluate the post-therapeutic
      course of ulcer disease. The overall proportion of H pylori eradication was 67.9%
      (53 of 78 patients available for follow up). Best results were obtained with two 
      week treatment regimens comprising omeprazole 20 mg twice daily and amoxicillin
      500 mg four times a day or 1000 mg twice daily (eradication > 80%). Eradication
      of H pylori speeds up ulcer healing, with a six week healing rate of 84.9%
      compared with 60% in patients with persistent H pylori infection (p = 0.0148). In
      a subgroup of 11 patients with refractory ulcers, H pylori eradication (n = 10)
      was associated with ulcer healing on continued acid suppression in nine cases.
      One male patient with chronic antral ulcer did not respond to treatment within
      the next six months (H pylori and ulcer persistence), and in one female patient a
      resistant body ulcer was identified as gastric lymphoma. Fifty patients with
      healed ulcers were followed up for one year. Patients with (n = 32) and without
      (n = 18) bacterial eradication had similar demographic and clinical
      characteristics. H pylori eradication was associated with a statistically
      significant reduction of ulcer recurrences (3.1 v 55.6%, p<0.001). This study
      concludes that H pylori eradication considerably changes the natural history of H
      pylori associated gastric ulcer disease. In addition, H pylori eradication speeds
      up ulcers healing and is associated with healing of previously refractory ulcers.
      Thus, treatment aimed at bacterial eradication should be considered in all
      patients with gastric ulcers severe enough to contemplate further treatment
      options.

TI  - Do continuous infusions of omeprazole and ranitidine retain their effect with
      prolonged dosing?
PG  - 60-4
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Prolonged infusions of H2-antagonists are commonly used in
      intensive care units, although little is known about their antisecretory efficacy
      beyond the initial 24 hours of dosing. The aim of this study was to assess the
      antisecretory effects of infusions of ranitidine and omeprazole for a period of
      72 hours. METHODS: Twelve healthy volunteers received individually titrated
      72-hour intravenous infusions of omeprazole, ranitidine, or placebo in a
      double-blind, crossover study. Gastric pH and dosing requirements were compared. 
      RESULTS: The median percentage of time with pH > 4 (interquartile range) was 93% 
      (88%-95%) on day 1 and 96% (94%-99%) on day 3 with omeprazole and 67% (56%-78%)
      and 43% (31%-51%), respectively, with ranitidine (both P < 0.001 vs. omeprazole).
      The mean doses (+/- SD) required on days 1 and 3 for omeprazole were 235.8 +/- 44
      mg and 134.0 +/- 37 mg (P < 0.0001), and ranitidine doses were 502.5 +/- 76 mg
      and 541.8 +/- 25 mg, respectively (P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Omeprazole infusions
      consistently maintained gastric pH above 4 over a period of 72 hours with
      progressively lower doses. Significant tolerance to the antisecretory effect of
      ranitidine infusion developed in 72 hours, which was not overcome despite
      individually titrated doses of more than 500 mg/24 hours. Consequently,
      application of pharmacodynamic results of single-day H2-blocker and proton-pump
      inhibitor studies to prolonged infusion trials for stress ulcer-related bleeding 
      is inappropriate.

TI  - Cytoprotection with misoprostol: use in the treatment and prevention of ulcers.
PG  - 37-45
AB  - Prostaglandins protect the gastric mucosa by decreasing gastric acid secretion,
      increasing mucus and bicarbonate production and maintaining mucosal blood flow.
      Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) cause gastroduodenal damage and
      this is due, at least in part, to inhibition of mucosal prostaglandin production.
      Misoprostol is a synthetic analogue of prostaglandin E1 which has been used in
      the healing of ulcers and prevention of peptic ulcers in patients taking NSAIDs. 
      Misoprostol is of equal efficacy to H2 antagonists in the healing of ordinary
      peptic ulcers (not associated with NSAIDs). Misoprostol is superior to placebo in
      healing NSAID ulcers during continued NSAID treatment but there have been no
      comparative trials with other ulcer-healing drugs. Misoprostol, H2 antagonists
      and sucralfate are of similar efficacy in prevention of NSAID-associated duodenal
      ulcers but misoprostol is more effective in prevention of gastric ulcers.
      Misoprostol has not been compared to omeprazole in this situation.

TI  - Long-term therapy with pantoprazole in patients with peptic ulceration resistant 
      to extended high-dose ranitidine treatment.
PG  - 59-64
AB  - Patients (106) with peptic ulceration of the oesophagus, stomach and duodenum,
      unresponsive to 3 or more months of high-dose treatment with ranitidine, were
      initially given pantoprazole (40-80 mg, p.o.) daily. In 96.7% of the patients
      ulcers healed within 2 to 8 weeks, and in 2.3% of patients the ulcers healed
      within 12 weeks. In just one patient with severe oesophagitis, the lesion took
      more than 6 months to heal. After ulcer healing, patients (98 to date) were
      treated with pantoprazole (40 mg/day) as long-term maintenance therapy.
      Eighty-eight of the 98 patients have been taking pantoprazole for 6 months to 3
      years. During maintenance therapy, peptic disease was kept in remission in most
      patients with 40 mg pantoprazole. Twelve patients with oesophagitis and two
      patients with gastric ulcers needed higher doses (80-120 mg) to control the
      disease. One female patient developed peripheral oedema which disappeared quickly
      after stopping treatment. No further drug-related adverse effects were observed. 
      Seven patients withdrew from the study and two patients died, all for
      non-drug-related reasons. Routine laboratory tests remained without significant
      changes in all patients. Mean (+/- S.E.M.) serum gastrin levels were already
      elevated during the initial high-dose ranitidine treatment (128 +/- 23 pg/ml).
      Within one year of the start of the pantoprazole treatment, serum gastrin levels 
      rose to 3 times normal values (189 +/- 32 pg/ml). Thereafter, no further
      increases in serum gastrin were observed for up to 2.5 years.
      Enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell density increased very slightly from 0.19% to
      0.24% within one year.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - The efficacy and safety of pantoprazole in the treatment of duodenal and gastric 
      ulcers has been compared with that of the first proton pump inhibitor omeprazole 
      in two (previously reported) clinical studies. Pantoprazole (40 mg/day)
      administered orally was an effective and well-tolerated treatment for both
      indications. Pantoprazole was as effective as omeprazole (20 mg/day) and had a
      similar safety profile. For gastric ulcers, the healing rate with pantoprazole
      was superior to that with omeprazole at 4 weeks.

      disorders.
PG  - 66-82
AB  - For the treatment of duodenal and gastric ulcer and reflux oesophagitis,
      especially erosive oesophagitis, omeprazole has an advantage over histamine
      H2-receptor antagonists because it heals significantly more patients
      significantly faster. Adverse effects have been observed during short term
      treatment with the same frequency as during treatment with H2-antagonists. Also, 
      maintenance treatment with omeprazole of reflux oesophagitis is significantly
      superior to H2-antagonist therapy. During long term treatment for up to 8 years
      no further drug-related adverse effects have been observed. Moderate
      hypergastrinaemia occurs in some patients, especially if an omeprazole dosage of 
      40 mg/day is needed. A slight increase of the agyrophil (endocrine) cell volume
      density and an extension of micronodular hyperplasia in the oxyntic mucosa after 
      several years of omeprazole treatment seem to be related to the severity of the
      corpus gastritis and not to drug-induced hypergastrinaemia, because similar
      changes have been observed in equal frequency in patients not receiving
      anti-secretory drugs. Theoretical arguments against long term treatment with
      potent acid-suppressing drugs, such as the possible consequences of gastric
      bacterial overgrowth or hypergastrinaemia, are not supported by clinical
      observations and epidemiological data and are, therefore, speculative.

PG  - 91-7
AB  - The clinical outcome and cost-effectiveness of episodic treatment of duodenal
      ulcer with omeprazole and ranitidine were evaluated over a 5-year period. The
      analysis was based on data from published clinical trials comparing healing rates
      obtained with omeprazole and with ranitidine, as well as on data from the
      literature on ulcer recurrence and other clinical events. Patients with an active
      duodenal ulcer were treated until healed or for a maximum of 24 weeks.
      Maintenance therapy was instituted in patients with ulcers that were very slow to
      heal and in patients with frequent relapses after cessation of treatment.
      Patients who experienced frequent relapses while receiving maintenance therapy,
      and those whose ulcer had not healed after 24 weeks of continuous treatment, were
      defined as candidates for surgery. A statistical model was set up and a random
      number generator used to generate a sequence of clinical events, month by month, 
      over a 5-year period for each patient in a large cohort. Episodic treatment with 
      omeprazole was shown to be more effective in avoiding maintenance treatment and
      surgery when compared with episodic treatment with ranitidine. Patients who
      received episodic treatment with omeprazole also spent more time in remission
      from disease. Using current Swedish cost data, it was found that episodic
      treatment with omeprazole was more cost-effective than episodic treatment with
      ranitidine.

TI  - Appropriate acid suppression for optimal healing of duodenal ulcer and

PG  - 79-82
AB  - Comparisons of the effectiveness of treatments for healing duodenal ulcer are
      essential to determine optimal management strategies for both economic analysis
      and quality-of-life evaluation. Differences are usually made on the basis of the 
      proportion of ulcers healed at varying time intervals. It has been shown by
      meta-analysis that healing of duodenal ulcers with antisecretory drugs is
      directly correlated to the degree of acid suppression. More recently,
      sophisticated meta-analysis of 24-hour intragastric acidity data and clinical
      trials of antisecretory drugs has demonstrated that the optimal degree and
      duration of gastric acid suppression for healing duodenal ulcer can be achieved
      by an aggregate time above pH 3 of 18-20 hours/day. These conditions predict 100%
      ulcer healing at 4 weeks. Antisecretory drug regimens that approach these
      criteria should achieve faster healing than other agents, with a concomitant
      acceleration of symptom resolution. Regression analysis was performed on the
      healing-time curves for each drug class to determine the rate of ulcer healing
      per week. The mean proportion of ulcers healed, irrespective of treatment
      duration, was highest for omeprazole, which also provided a significantly faster 
      rate of duodenal ulcer healing than all other drug classes (p < 0.001). It has
      recently been shown that healing of erosive oesophagitis with antisecretory drugs
      is directly correlated with both the duration of acid suppression over the
      24-hour period (p < 0.05) and the elevation of intra-oesophageal pH above 4.
      Furthermore, oesophageal acid exposure time can be normalized by maintaining the 
      intra-oesophageal pH above 4 for at least 96% of the 24-hour period.(ABSTRACT

PG  - 74-8
AB  - Reflux oesophagitis is a chronic disorder with frequent relapses on cessation of 
      initial successful treatment. In patients with reflux oesophagitis, treatment
      with the acid pump inhibitor, omeprazole, has repeatedly been demonstrated to
      prevent the recurrence of symptoms and of erosive and/or ulcerative lesions in
      the oesophagus. Comparative trials have shown that an average of 82% of
      oesophagitis patients were maintained in endoscopic and symptomatic remission
      over a period of 12 months when treated with omeprazole, 20 mg once daily. This
      compares with only 36% of patients in remission when given 'full-dose'
      H2-receptor antagonist therapy (ranitidine, 300 mg daily). It is interesting to
      note that, in a recent trial, 62% of reflux oesophagitis patients were in
      remission after 12 months of treatment with omeprazole, 10 mg once daily,
      compared with the corresponding figure of 72% among those on 20 mg once daily. In
      patients poorly responsive to control of oesophagitis with H2-receptor
      antagonists, omeprazole at a dose of at least 20 mg daily is required to achieve 
      symptom resolution and endoscopic healing--and remission can be maintained for
      years with continued omeprazole treatment. Omeprazole has been shown to have a
      good long-term safety profile, as evaluated in these trials.

PG  - 69-73
AB  - Grade I oesophagitis is usually considered to be a less severe form of
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). However, with regard to symptom
      severity, patients without macroscopic mucosal lesions have been shown not to
      differ from those with more severe oesophagitis. A number of controlled trials on
      the efficacy of omeprazole in GORD have included patients with lower grades of
      the disease. The results show that the differences in efficacy between omeprazole
      and H2-receptor antagonists, which have been established for the treatment of
      erosive and ulcerative oesophagitis, also extend to patients with grade I
      oesophagitis (erythema and friability). In these studies, omeprazole provided
      more rapid symptom resolution and histological improvement than ranitidine. In
      one double-blind comparative trial, complete endoscopic normalization of the
      oesophageal mucosa was observed in 90% of patients with grade I oesophagitis
      within 4 weeks of treatment with omeprazole, 40 mg once daily, compared with 55% 
      of those treated with ranitidine, 150 mg twice daily; at 8 weeks the mucosa in
      all patients in the omeprazole group had completely healed at endoscopy, while
      oesophagitis was still present in 21% of the patients receiving ranitidine. A
      separate 6-month, placebo-controlled maintenance study was performed in patients 
      who had completed a short-term study and who had total relief from the major
      symptoms of GORD and complete healing of endoscopic oesophagitis. All patients
      given placebo had an endoscopic recurrence (i.e. endoscopic grade I or more) and 
      this was associated with the return of symptoms in 75% of cases.(ABSTRACT

TI  - Prevention of duodenal ulcer relapse by long-term treatment with omeprazole.
PG  - 39-41
AB  - Duodenal ulcer is a chronic disease with a high risk of relapse--if left
      untreated, the relapse rate is 50-80% per year (1). However, the relapse rate can
      be effectively reduced by inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Although many
      patients can be managed with episodic therapy, controlled either by the patient
      or doctor, continuous maintenance treatment is often necessary for patients with 
      severe forms of the disease and those at risk of complications (2). Maintenance
      therapy with single night-time doses of an H2-receptor antagonist reduces relapse
      rates from approximately 75% to 25% per year (3). As omeprazole is more effective
      than the H2-receptor antagonists in the acute treatment of duodenal ulcer,
      healing virtually all patients within 4 weeks (4), it may also be more effective 
      in the maintenance treatment of duodenal ulcer disease. To date, three studies
      have reported the effect of omeprazole on relapse rates of duodenal ulcer. A
      Danish multicentre study involved 195 patients, who were treated with omeprazole,
      either 10 mg once daily, or 20 mg once daily on Friday, Saturday and Sunday
      (weekend therapy), or with placebo (5). After 6 months, the remission rates were 
      67% and 70%, respectively, for those patients receiving omeprazole--significantly
      higher than in those receiving placebo (17% after 6 months). An Italian
      multicentre study of 81 patients found that omeprazole, both 10 mg once daily,
      and 20 mg once daily at weekends (Friday, Saturday and Sunday), was equally
      effective in preventing relapse. The proportions of patients in remission were
      81% and 70%, respectively, after 6 months (6).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

      patients.
PG  - 28-34
AB  - The incidence and mean score of Helicobacter pylori-related, active
      antroduodenitis, lesions of superficial antral epithelium and duodenal
      gastric-type metaplasia were higher in endoscopic biopsies from a large series of
      patients with duodenal ulcer, when compared with asymptomatic patients or
      patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia. In 65 out of 73 patients with duodenal ulcer
      who could be followed up, H. pylori was eradicated using a combination of
      amoxycillin, 3 g daily, metronidazole, 1 g daily, and omeprazole, 20 mg daily.
      Rapid and permanent (6-month follow-up) abolition of both gastroduodenitis
      activity and lesions of the gastric surface epithelium was observed in these 65
      patients. There was also a progressive decrease in total immune-inflammatory
      cells but without a substantial change in duodenal gastric-type metaplasia.
      Similar, but transient and quantitatively less prominent, improvements were
      observed in the antroduodenal mucosa, which had been temporarily cleared of H.
      pylori by treatment with omeprazole alone. Conversely, increased gastritis
      activity, epithelial lesions and immune-inflammatory cell scores were found in
      the short term in the corpus mucosa, which was not cleared of H. pylori after
      omeprazole treatment. It is concluded that, of the various H. pylori-related
      mucosal changes, antroduodenitis activity and antral epithelial lesions most
      closely reflect the severity of mucosal damage and are probably the most
      important factors in duodenal ulcerogenesis. Their complete and rapid suppression
      after bacterial eradication may be a key factor in preventing ulcer relapse.

AB  - The mechanisms underlying duodenal ulcer (DU) recurrence after endoscopically
      confirmed healing are unclear. We sought to examine histologic differences in
      healing induced by omeprazole and nizatidine. This also entailed assessing
      interobserver variation in endoscopic diagnosis and the correlation between
      endoscopic and histomorphologic healing. We treated 31 DU patients for 4 weeks
      with either omeprazole (20 mg daily a.m.) or nizatidine (300 mg twice daily). The
      healing rates of both groups showed no significant differences (86.7% versus
      81.2%; p = 0.5). Good mucosal repair rates did not differ significantly (38.5%
      versus 69.2% respectively; p = 0.5). Endoscopists' agreement over scar type was
      0.80, with the chance of agreement 0.70 (k = 0.34 +/- -0.08). The correlation
      between macroscopic and histologic appearance of scars was fair, but fully
      significant (r = 0.48; p < 0.05). We conclude that the study was too small to
      detect significant differences in healing patterns between the two drugs. The
      wide variation in endoscopic diagnosis suggests that mucosal repair is best
      assessed by histologic examination of biopsy samples.

PG  - 1102-5
AB  - Strong inhibition of acid secretion could be able to decrease gastric and
      duodenal ulcer early rebleeding. OBJECTIVE--The aim of this double blind
      randomized trial was to compare early rebleeding rates of 2 groups of patients
      treated with ranitidine (600 mg/day) or lansoprazole (60 mg/day) per os for 6
      consecutive days. METHODS--Seventy five patients with a high risk of rebleeding
      (clinical and endoscopical criteria) were included in this trial. These ulcers
      were Ia (n = 10), Ib (n = 20), IIa (n = 13), IIb (n = 32) in Forrest
      classification. RESULTS--Nineteen out of 75 patients rebled (25.3%): 11 out of 37
      (30%) and 8 out of 38 (21%) in the ranitidine and lansoprazole groups
      respectively. Rates of rebleeding were 10%, 12.5%, 36% and 29% respectively in
      the ulcers grade Ia (previously treated with endoscopic sclerosis), Ib, IIa and
      IIb in the Forest classification. CONCLUSION--The rates of rebleeding were not
      statistically different in the 2 groups of treatment. The high rebleeding rates
      observed with Forrest IIa and IIb and duodenal ulcers support the need of
      haemostatic endoscopic therapy associated to antisecretory treatment in such
      patients.

TI  - Omeprazole and high dose ranitidine in the treatment of refractory reflux
      oesophagitis.
PG  - 655-9
AB  - Thirty two consecutive patients (age range 6 months-13.4 years) with severe
      reflux oesophagitis were randomised to a therapeutic trial for eight weeks during
      which they received either standard doses of omeprazole (40 mg/day/1.73 m2
      surface area) or high doses of ranitidine (20 mg/kg/day). Twenty five patients
      completed the trial (12 on omeprazole, 13 on ranitidine). At entry and at the end
      of the trial patients underwent symptomatic score assessment, endoscopic and
      histological evaluation of the oesophagus, and simultaneous oesophageal and
      gastric pH measurement; results are given as median (range). Both therapeutic
      regimens were effective in decreasing clinical score (omeprazole before 24.0
      (15-33), after 9.0 (0-18); ranitidine before 19.5 (12-33), after 9.0 (6-12)), in 
      improving the histological degree of oesophagitis (omeprazole before 8.0 (6-10), 
      after 2.0 (0-60); ranitidine before 8.0 (8-10), after 2.0 (2-6), and in reducing 
      oesophageal acid exposure, measured as minutes of reflux at 24 hour pH monitoring
      (omeprazole before 129.4 (84-217), after 44.6 (0.16-128); ranitidine before 207.3
      (66-306), after 58.4 (32-128)) as well as intragastric acidity, measured as
      median intragastric pH (omeprazole before 2.1 (1.0-3.0), after 5.1 (2.2-7.4);
      ranitidine before 1.9 (1.6-4), after 3.4 (2.3-5.3)). Serum gastrin concentration 
      was > 150 ng/l in four patients on omeprazole and in three patients on
      ranitidine. It is concluded that in children with refractory reflux oesophagitis 
      high doses of ranitidine are comparable with omeprazole for the healing of
      oesophagitis and relief of symptoms; both drugs resulted in efficacious reduction
      of intragastric acidity and intra-oesophageal acid exposure.

TI  - Use of omeprazole in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome: a prospective nine-year study of
      efficacy and safety.
PG  - 597-610
AB  - H+, K(+)-ATPase inhibitors such as omeprazole are the antisecretory agents of
      choice for the management of gastric acid hypersecretory states, including the
      Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. However, long-term follow-up data on the overall
      efficacy and safety of these agents in large numbers of patients are lacking. In 
      the current study we examined the long-term efficacy and safety of omeprazole in 
      116 patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome treated with oral omeprazole at a
      single centre for up to 114 months (mean +/- S.E.M. = 38 +/- 3 months). The
      initial omeprazole maintenance dose was established according to the acute upward
      dose titration method in 89/116 patients (77%). Gastric acid output was
      effectively controlled using 60 mg of omeprazole once daily in 41/89 patients
      (46%) and 22/89 patients (25%) required twice daily omeprazole therapy. The mean 
      ranitidine equivalent dose for patients who required 60 mg omeprazole once daily 
      (2.5 +/- 0.2 g/day) was significantly lower than the mean ranitidine equivalent
      dose for patients who required more than 60 mg omeprazole once daily (4.3 +/- 0.3
      g/day). Long-term omeprazole maintenance therapy was discontinued in 36/116
      patients (31%) but in no cases was discontinuation due either to drug-induced
      side-effects or uncontrolled gastric acid output. Fasting serum gastrin levels
      were significantly elevated above pre-treatment levels at only one time point
      during follow-up and were likely due to tumour growth rather than a drug effect. 
      The final long-term omeprazole maintenance doses were lower than the initial
      doses but correlated closely with the pre-omeprazole basal acid output (r = 0.41,
      P < 0.001) and ranitidine equivalent dose requirements (r = 0.49, P < 0.001). We 
      conclude that omeprazole effectively and safely controls gastric acid
      hypersecretion in all patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome for up to nine
      years without evidence by tachyphylaxis.

TI  - Does 40 mg omeprazole daily offer additional benefit over 20 mg daily in patients
      requiring more than 4 weeks of treatment for symptomatic reflux oesophagitis?
PG  - 501-7
AB  - This study was designed to establish whether 40 mg omeprazole once daily exhibits
      sufficient additional efficacy over that of 20 mg omeprazole once daily in
      patients with symptomatic reflux oesophagitis requiring more than an initial
      4-week course of 20 mg omeprazole once daily (o.m.) to warrant routine use of the
      higher dose. Three hundred and thirteen patients were randomized to receive
      either 20 mg omeprazole (4 weeks) then 20 mg (second 4 weeks if not both healed
      and symptom-free after 4 weeks), or 20 mg omeprazole (4 weeks) then 40 mg
      omeprazole o.m. (second 4 weeks). One hundred and twenty-seven patients were
      healed and symptom-free after 4 weeks and left the study at that point. Taking
      the second treatment period in isolation, the healing rate (64% vs. 45%, P <
      0.02) and relief of heartburn (72% vs. 60%, P < 0.002) were greater among
      patients receiving 40 mg omeprazole o.m., demonstrating the existence of a
      dose-response relationship for omeprazole. However, on completion, there were no 
      significant differences between the patients randomized to the 20/20 mg (healed
      65%, asymptomatic 69%) or the 20/40 mg (healed 74%, asymptomatic 74%: both not
      significant differences compared with 20/20 mg) regimens. The magnitude of the
      difference in efficacy between 20 and 40 mg omeprazole in symptomatic reflux
      oesophagitis is insufficient to warrant the routine use of 40 mg in patients
      requiring more than 4 weeks' treatment with 20 mg omeprazole o.m.; continued
      treatment with 20 mg omeprazole for 4-8 weeks is the preferred option.

TI  - Alternate-day therapy with omeprazole for duodenal ulcer.
PG  - 132-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Maximal acid suppression produced by a single dose of 20 mg
      omeprazole has been reported to persist for over 24 hours, with acid secretion
      returning to normal after 2 days. OBJECTIVES: (i) To study the effect of single
      oral dose of 20 mg omeprazole on maximal acid output (MAO) and peak acid output
      (PAO) in duodenal ulcer patients and healthy volunteers. (ii) To compare the
      efficacy of omeprazole 20 mg daily versus 20 mg on alternate days in the
      treatment of duodenal ulcer. STUDY DESIGN: Open randomized comparative trial.
      METHODS: MAO and PAO were estimated in five duodenal ulcer patients and five
      healthy volunteers before, and 24 hours and 48 hours after, a single 20 mg oral
      dose of omeprazole. Fifty eight consecutive uncomplicated duodenal ulcer patients
      were randomized to receive omeprazole 20 mg either daily (n = 30) or on alternate
      days (n = 28) for four weeks. The two groups were matched for age, sex, duration 
      of ulcer symptoms, smoking, NSAID use, and ulcer size at entry. Symptom scores
      using a pre-defined scoring system and endoscopic ulcer healing rates were
      evaluated at 2 and 4 weeks. RESULTS: MAO and PAO showed significant reduction in 
      both duodenal ulcer patients and healthy controls 24 hours after 20 mg
      omeprazole. Reduction at 48 hours was significant in duodenal ulcer patients but 
      not in controls. Endoscopic healing rates of duodenal ulcer at 2 and 4 weeks were
      80% and 93.3% respectively in the daily treatment group and 71.4% and 85.7%
      respectively in the alternate-day treatment group. These differences were not
      statistically significant. CONCLUSION: 20 mg omeprazole on alternate days is as
      effective as 20 mg daily (i) in suppressing MAO and PAO and (ii) in the treatment
      of duodenal ulcer.

TI  - Omeprazole: a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of its use in duodenal ulcer and reflux
      oesophagitis.
PG  - 482-510
AB  - Omeprazole regulates gastric acid secretion and is an effective treatment of
      acute duodenal ulcer and reflux oesophagitis, achieving more rapid healing and
      symptomatic relief than histamine H 2-receptor antagonists. When administered as 
      maintenance therapy, omeprazole reduces the incidence of relapse. The drug is
      also highly effective in patients poorly responsive to histamine H 2-receptor
      antagonists. The daily acquisition cost of omeprazole is higher than that of
      histamine H 2-receptor antagonists in many countries, and thus it is important to
      evaluate the pharmacoeconomic impact of omeprazole in the short and long term
      treatment of duodenal ulcer and reflux oesophagitis. Pharmacoeconomic analyses
      have been performed in several clinical settings using pooled data from clinical 
      trials or simulated models of clinical practice. In a single analysis using
      Finnish cost data, omeprazole was more cost effective than ranitidine in the
      treatment of duodenal ulcer disease over a 6-month period. The cost effectiveness
      of omeprazole was comparable to that of sucralfate-containing regimens, with
      patients receiving omeprazole being healed more quickly and experiencing a
      greater number of healthy days. Using a computer-model simulation and Swedish
      cost data, omeprazole was more cost effective than ranitidine when administered
      as intermittent treatment of duodenal ulcer over 5 years. Preliminary reports
      indicate that regimens which eradicate Helicobacter pylori are more cost
      effective than those which do not. As short term treatment of reflux
      oesophagitis, omeprazole 20 to 40 mg/day was the dominating treatment strategy,
      being less costly and more effective than ranitidine 300 to 1200 mg/day.
      Omeprazole 20 mg/day produced symptom-free days more cost effectively than either
      cimetidine 1.6 g/day or ranitidine 300 mg/day. More importantly, as long term
      (maintenance or intermittent) treatment of reflux oesophagitis, omeprazole 20
      mg/day was more cost effective than both ranitidine 150 mg twice daily and 'phase
      1' therapy (diet and antacids) over 6 and 12 months. Thus, based on analyses
      evaluated, omeprazole appears to be more cost effective than ranitidine in the
      short term treatment of duodenal ulcer. Results for long term treatment are less 
      clear cut, but full details from some studies are not yet available. For the
      short term treatment of reflux oesophagitis omeprazole is more cost effective
      than ranitidine or cimetidine and for long term treatment omeprazole is more cost
      effective than ranitidine. As treatment for reflux oesophagitis, omeprazole is
      considered to be the dominating treatment strategy.

TI  - Lansoprazole and Helicobacter pylori infection.
PG  - 49-57
AB  - Helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis is present in virtually all patients
      with duodenal ulcer (DU). Eradication of H pylori is associated with a highly
      significant decline in the recurrence rates of DU, indicating that treatments
      aimed at eradicating H pylori are mandatory in these patients. The novel proton
      pump inhibitor lansoprazole exhibits a potent antiulcer effect and, in vitro, a
      direct antibacterial effect against H pylori. Conflicting data have been reported
      on the question of whether lansoprazole is bactericidal against H pylori in vivo 
      when administered alone. The aim of this double-blind trial was to address this
      issue further by comparing the effects of two different 4-week regimens
      (lansoprazole alone or in combination with amoxicillin) on H pylori infection in 
      patients with DU. Patients were assessed before and after the 4-week treatment
      and 3 months after stopping the study medication. The ulcer healing rates at 4
      weeks were similar for the two treatments while there was a trend for higher
      recurrence rates at 4 months in patients receiving lansoprazole alone. The
      frequency of high-grade H pylori infection was significantly lower in the
      lansoprazole and amoxicillin group both at 4 weeks (84% clearing) and 4 months.
      After 4 weeks of treatment there were no patients with residual H pylori-positive
      active antral gastritis in the lansoprazole and amoxicillin group compared with
      25% in the lansoprazole alone group. Neither treatment significantly affected the
      IgG antibody response to H pylori either at the circulatory or the mucosal level.
      In contrast, the mucosal H pylori-specific IgA response was significantly
      enhanced after 4 weeks and more markedly after treatment with
      lansoprazole.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Treatment of patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.
PG  - 22-31
AB  - In the treatment of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome patients with severe disease and
      acid hypersecretion, proton pump inhibitors are the drugs of choice. Data have
      now been accumulated on lansoprazole treatment of 41 patients (21 treated at the 
      National Institutes of Health [NIH], Bethesda, Maryland, USA, and 20 treated at
      the Bichat-Claude Bernard Hospital, Paris, France). Short-term studies of the
      inhibitory action of lansoprazole on acid secretion have been carried out in both
      institutions. Our group first performed a dose-response analysis of the efficacy 
      of lansoprazole in reducing basal acid output (BAO) in four patients with severe 
      Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (mean BAO 52 +/- 9 [SD] mmol H+/h) who had previously 
      been treated with a mean omeprazole dosage of 75 mg/day. The maximum acid
      inhibitory effect was obtained with lansoprazole 60-90 mg/day. The 40-hour
      duration of action of lansoprazole appears equivalent to that of omeprazole. In a
      second study at the Bichat-Claude Bernard Hospital, nine Zollinger-Ellison
      syndrome patients underwent 24-hour intragastric pH monitoring while receiving
      lansoprazole (mean dosage 80 mg/day, range 30-165 mg/day) or omeprazole (mean
      dosage 75 mg/day, range 20-180 mg/day). The acid inhibitory activity of the two
      drugs was comparable. Those patients are currently receiving long-term
      maintenance treatment with lansoprazole, and satisfactory clinical and biological
      secretory control has been achieved. The long-term safety and efficacy of
      lansoprazole administration were studied in the 21 patients followed at the NIH. 
      In those patients the initial maintenance dose was determined using acid
      inhibition studies; in all patients lansoprazole controlled gastric acid
      hypersecretion and peptic symptoms in both the short and long term. The mean
      initial maintenance dose was 60 mg QID, except for two patients who required 60
      mg BID. During long-term treatment (mean duration 31 months, range 1-43 months), 
      six patients required a dosage increase within the first year, while the
      lansoprazole dose could be reduced in six others. The safety profile of
      lansoprazole has been excellent. Comparable results have been noted in nine
      Zollinger-Ellison syndrome patients during an ongoing evaluation in our
      institution. These studies indicate that lansoprazole is an efficacious,
      well-tolerated antisecretory agent in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.

TI  - Treatment of gastroesophageal (acid) reflux with lansoprazole: an overview.
PG  - 2-13
AB  - Despite the fact that reflux esophagitis is a multifactorial disease, inhibition 
      of gastric acid secretion is the mainstay of medical treatment, both for moderate
      and severe cases. Antisecretory agents lower the acidity of the refluxate, thus
      decreasing its aggressive effect, which favors the mucosal healing process. The
      greater the acid inhibition, the greater will be the mucosal repair. This is the 
      reason for a therapeutic gain for H2-receptor antagonists over anticholinergics
      and antacids, and for proton pump inhibitors over H2-receptor antagonists. The
      most recently developed proton pump inhibitor, lansoprazole, at doses of 15, 30, 
      or 60 mg/day for 4 and 8 weeks of treatment, has proven to be significantly more 
      effective than placebo (one multicenter study involving 292 patients) or
      ranitidine (three multicenter studies involving 653 patients) in terms of mucosal
      healing and symptom relief. In two comparative trials with omeprazole 20 mg vs
      lansoprazole 30 mg (in a total of 349 evaluable patients) healing rates were
      found to be similar, but in one trial the relief of heartburn proved to be
      significantly more pronounced in patients receiving lansoprazole who also used
      fewer antacids. The frequency of adverse events was comparable in the two
      treatment groups. Reflux esophagitis is a chronic condition and after stopping
      antisecretory treatment, including lansoprazole, most patients relapse in terms
      of symptoms and endoscopical lesions, which suggests the need for long-term
      treatment. However, a strategy for long-term control of reflux esophagitis
      remains to be defined (lower daily dose, alternate-day standard dose, or
      concomitant prokinetic drugs?). The safety of proton pump inhibitors given for
      prolonged periods also needs to be more thoroughly evaluated.

TI  - Mechanisms of NSAID-induced ulcerogenesis: structural properties of drugs, focus 
      on the microvascular factors, and novel approaches for gastro-intestinal
      protection.
PG  - 23-38
AB  - The multifactorial ulcer-producing actions of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs (NSAIDs) are briefly reviewed and the main actions highlighted as the focus
      for potential strategies for reducing the ulcerogenic effects of these drugs.
      While some clinical benefits are evident from long-term clinical studies from
      application of PG analogues (misoprostol) and H+/K(+)-ATP-ase inhibitors
      (omeprazole) these are, ultimately, expensive approaches. Chemical structural
      properties of the NSAIDs underlying differences in their ulcerogenicity are
      analyzed with the objective of establishing the reasons for the low
      ulcerogenicity of some of these drugs (e.g. azapropazone). These studies serve as
      a basis for developing less gastrotoxic drugs in the future. In the studies we
      have undertaken analysis of the benefits of micronutrients and of modulating
      eicosanoid metabolism have been considered. The results of some clinical trials
      with micronutrients have proven encouraging. These and other approaches and
      pitfalls reported give further encouragement to explore the mechanisms of the
      protective effects of these latter agents and serve as a basis for future
      developments.
