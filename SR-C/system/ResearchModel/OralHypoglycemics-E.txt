TI  - Improvements in glycemic control in type 2 diabetes patients switched from
      sulfonylurea coadministered with metformin to glyburide-metformin tablets.
PG  - 256-62
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the change in hemoglobin A1C (A1C) in patients with type 2
      diabetes switched from coadministration of a sulfonylurea (SU), glyburide or
      glipizide, and metformin (SU+Met) to a single glyburide-metformin tablet.
      METHODS: A retrospective cohort study design of patients with type 2 diabetes
      treated at 3 Veterans Affairs Medical Centers and 1 Department of Defense Medical
      Center was utilized. One hundred percent of patients receiving
      glyburide-metformin tablets were screened for inclusion. Patients with at least 6
      months of prior SU+Met combination therapy and a baseline A1C measured within 35 
      days prior to or 3 days after switch to glyburide-metformin tablets were
      included. At least one documented follow-up A1C at >or=90 days after the switch
      to glyburide-metformin was required for inclusion. Glycemic control,
      complications, lipid parameters, concomitant medications, and weight were
      analyzed prior to and following the switch to glyburide-metformin. RESULTS:
      Seventy-two patient records were included after the disqualification criteria
      excluded 488 prospective patients. The mean age of the 72 patients was 62 years; 
      average body mass index was 32.9 kg/m2, average baseline A1C was 8.3%, and the
      average time since diagnosis was 7.6 years. The mean reduction in A1C was 0.6%
      (P=0.002) at a mean follow-up of 196 days after the switch to glyburide-metformin
      tablets. Improvement in glycemic control was predominantly seen in patients with 
      a baseline A1C >or=8% in whom a 1.3% mean reduction in A1C (P=0.0002) was
      achieved despite a lower mean final dose of glyburide. CONCLUSION: The results of
      this study suggest that in type 2 diabetic patients with an A1C >or=8%, switching
      from coadministration of a sulfonylurea plus metformin to combination
      glyburide-metformin tablets may provide an improvement in glycemic control in the
      range of a 1.2 to 1.4 absolute percentage point decrease in A1C. A randomized,
      prospective trial comparing these 2 methods of treatment is needed, however, to
      determine the precise effect provided by the unique formulation of glyburide in
      the glyburide-metformin tablet.

TI  - Cardiovascular risk in type 2 diabetics and pharmacological regulation of
      mealtime glucose excursions.
PG  - 335-40
AB  - In type 2 diabetic patients mealtime glucose fluctuations are important
      determinants of overall glucose control and overall risk of diabetes
      cardiovascular complications. In fact, acute elevation of plasma glucose
      concentrations trigger an array of tissue response that may contribute to
      development of such vascular complications since it may result in a thrombophilic
      condition, causes endothelial dysfunction (possibly through a reduction of nitric
      oxide availability) and is responsible for non-enzymatic glycation and production
      of free- radicals with ensuing oxidative stress. To keep post-prandial glucose
      with narrow range, metiglinide analogues drugs have been developed. In
      particular, repaglinide and nateglinide seem the most useful ones. In fact, both 
      drugs improve 1(st) phase insulin release but they do not affect the total daily 
      amount of insulin released by the pancreas. Due to the mechanism of action and to
      pharmacokinetic properties, repaglinide and nateglinide allow diabetic patients
      to get a more tight metabolic glucose control with a contemporary reduction in
      the cases of severe hypoglycaemia. In conclusions, repaglinide and nateglinide
      are new and powerful pharmacological tools not only for achieving a better
      metabolic glucose control but also for preventing the development of
      diabetes-related cardiovascular complications.

TI  - Lispro insulin and metformin versus other combination in the diabetes mellitus
      type 2 management after secondary oral antidiabetic drug failure.
PG  - 181-7
AB  - The purpose of the study was to find out differences between treatments of
      diabetes type 2 after secondary oral antidiabetic drug failure. Three different
      methods of treatment were compared: lispro insulin in combination with metformin,
      glimepiride and metformin combination or two daily doses of biphasic insulin
      30/70 together with bed-time NPH insulin. The study included 87 patients with
      diabetes mellitus type 2 randomly distributed into 3 different treatment groups. 
      Fasting and postprandial glucose were analyzed by enzymatic colorimetric method
      and HbA1c was measured by ion exchange chromatography. HbA1c significantly
      decreased in all three study groups. The decrease was mostly expressed among
      patients treated with lispro and metformin. When focused on postprandial glucose 
      control, antihyperglycemic metformin and insulin lispro therapy has greater
      impact on the overall metabolic control (decrease in level of HbA1c) in
      comparison with the above mentioned more traditional approaches.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of nateglinide and its metabolites in subjects with type 2
      diabetes mellitus and renal failure.
PG  - 90-5
AB  - AIMS: We evaluated the benefits and safety of nateglinide, a novel oral
      hypoglycemic agent, in type 2 diabetes patients with renal failure. METHODS:
      Single-dose pharmacokinetics were studied in 8 patients with type 2 diabetes and 
      a low creatinine clearance (range 1.8-16.5 ml/min/1.73 m2) up to 6 hours after 90
      mg nateglinide administration. Next, we treated another group of 8 patients
      undergoing regular hemodialysis with nateglinide 90 mg/day for 1-3 months. The
      effect of hemodialysis on metabolite accumulation was then tested. RESULTS: After
      a single 90 mg dose, nateglinide significantly increased the post-prandial
      secretion of insulin and thereby reduced plasma glucose levels. Mean
      pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC(0-6) 10.45 mg/l/h; t(1/2) 1.89 h, Cl/F 10.19 l/h)
      were comparable with those reported in healthy subjects. A much larger AUC value 
      than those previously reported of M1, a major metabolite in the urine of healthy 
      subjects, was observed, and the plasma concentration of M1 did not decline up to 
      6 hours after. In patients treated on a regular basis, there was marked
      accumulation of M1, while nateglinide could not be detected 24 hours after the
      last dose. Plasma M1 levels were significantly reduced by the hemodialysis
      sessions. CONCLUSIONS: Single 90 mg dose of nateglinide was safe and effective in
      patients with renal failure. However, repeated administrations could cause
      prolonged hypoglycemia due to accumulation of M1, which is known to have a modest
      hypoglycemic activity. Hemodialysis may help to eliminate excessive accumulation 
      of M1.

TI  - Possible heart failure exacerbation associated with rosiglitazone: case report
      and literature review.
PG  - 945-54
AB  - Increasing evidence suggests that neurohumoral manifestations of heart failure
      may lead to insulin resistance, predisposing patients with heart failure to the
      development of glucose intolerance or worsening of existing diabetes.
      Theoretically, insulin-sensitizing thiazolidinediones (TZDs) should be beneficial
      in this patient population. A 74-year-old man with well-compensated systolic
      dysfunction and longstanding type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with glyburide
      began therapy with rosiglitazone 4 mg/day, which was increased to 8 mg/day after 
      1 month. Two weeks later he was seen with a 5-kg weight gain, shortness of
      breath, bibasilar rales, +S3 gallop, and increased jugular venous distention.
      Twelve days later symptoms worsened, with pulmonary edema on chest radiograph,
      continued weight gain, and +4 pitting edema resistant to oral diuretics. The
      patient was admitted to the hospital for exacerbation of heart failure. Five days
      after discharge he was readmitted for similar symptoms, including an 11.8-kg
      weight gain. He reported adherence to drug therapy and diet. Rosiglitazone was
      immediately discontinued and 11 days later the man's weight stabilized to 79 kg
      and remained between 79 and 80 kg 2 and 3 months after discharge. This case
      demonstrates that TZDs may precipitate weight gain and pulmonary and peripheral
      edema in patients with stable heart failure. Earlier reports documented similar
      symptoms in patients without a history of heart failure. Although current
      recommendations state that TZDs should not be administered to patients with New
      York Heart Association class III or IV disease, practitioners should be aware
      that these adverse effects also may occur in patients with milder forms heart
      failure as well as those without heart failure.

TI  - Effect on glycemic control of exenatide (synthetic exendin-4) additive to
      existing metformin and/or sulfonylurea treatment in patients with type 2
      diabetes.
PG  - 2370-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: AC2993 (synthetic exendin-4; exenatide) is a peptide that enhances
      glucose-dependent insulin secretion, suppresses inappropriately elevated glucagon
      secretion, and slows gastric emptying. AC2993 also promotes beta-cell
      proliferation and neogenesis in vitro and in animal models. This study examines
      the activity and safety of subcutaneously injected AC2993 in patients with type 2
      diabetes currently treated with diet and/or oral antidiabetic agents (OAAs).
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 109 patients treated with diet and a
      sulfonylurea and/or metformin were enrolled in a blinded study. Patients were
      randomly assigned to one of three subcutaneously (SC) injected regimens of AC2993
      (0.08 micro g/kg) or placebo for 28 days. RESULTS: All three AC2993 regimens led 
      to significant reductions in serum fructosamine relative to placebo (P <or=
      0.004). Mean reductions ranged from 39 to 46 micro mol/l. All AC2993 groups had
      reductions in HbA(1c) ranging from 0.7 to 1.1% (P <or= 0.006). An end-of-study
      HbA(1c) <7% was achieved by 15% of AC2993 patients versus 4% of placebo patients,
      confirming AC2993 effects on fasting and postprandial glycemia. On days 14 and
      28, the beta-cell index (homeostasis model assessment) for patients treated with 
      AC2993 was 50-100% higher than baseline, contrasting with unchanged levels for
      placebo. The most common adverse event was transient mild-to-moderate nausea.
      CONCLUSIONS: AC2993 is a promising therapeutic for patients with type 2 diabetes.
      In this study, it had significant effects on HbA(1c) levels in patients not
      currently achieving optimal glucose control with diet and/or OAAs.

TI  - Economic model of first-line drug strategies to achieve recommended glycaemic
      control in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 819-37
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the short-term direct medical costs and effectiveness
      associated with achieving recommended glycaemic goals using commonly prescribed
      first-line oral antihyperglycaemic medications in type 2 diabetes mellitus.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature-based, decision-tree model was developed to
      project the number of patients achieving glycosylated haemoglobin values of <7%
      on oral therapies and the associated costs over a 3-year timeframe. For each
      first-line strategy, patients could progress to combination therapy using two or 
      more agents prior to the introduction of insulin. The overall cost of treatment
      included costs (2001/2002 values; US dollars) of comprehensive medical care,
      laboratory tests, patient education, drug therapy, home glucose monitoring and
      adverse events. RESULTS: At 3 years, the overall cost of treatment for the
      various first-line strategies was 6,106 US dollars for glipizide gastrointestinal
      therapeutic system, 6,727 US dollars for metformin immediate release, 6,826 US
      dollars for metformin extended release, 7,141 US dollars for glibenclamide
      (glyburide)/metformin, 7,759 US dollars for rosiglitazone and 9,298 US dollars
      for repaglinide. Costs of comprehensive routine medical care ranged from
      approximately 1,538-2,128 US dollars in year 1 and from approximately 952-1,543
      US dollars in subsequent years, for controlled and uncontrolled patients,
      respectively. Adverse events represented <1%, and drug therapies represented
      approximately 50%, of the overall cost, respectively. Substantial cost
      differences between the strategies were seen within the first year. Regardless of
      first-line therapy, patients progressed quickly to combination therapies, with
      effectiveness among the agents being similar. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term costs
      required to provide comprehensive diabetes care and achieve glycemic goals can be
      substantial. The model suggests a sulphonylurea strategy may provide similar
      effectiveness with cost savings over other agents and should be considered when
      selecting an initial drug therapy in newly diagnosed patients with type 2
      diabetes mellitus.

TI  - Multicenter, randomized, double-masked, parallel-group assessment of simultaneous
      glipizide/metformin as second-line pharmacologic treatment for patients with type
      2 diabetes mellitus that is inadequately controlled by a sulfonylurea.
PG  - 890-903
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) with inadequate
      long-term blood glucose control with sulfonylurea or metformin monotherapy
      require additional treatment. The synergistic effects of combining glipizide with
      metformin on glucose control may be realized by treating the primary effects of
      type 2 DM, impaired insulin secretion, and insulin resistance. OBJECTIVE: This
      study assessed therapy with glipizide/metformin combination tablets in patients
      with type 2 DM that is uncontrolled by at least half the maximum labeled daily
      dose of a sulfonylurea. METHODS: In this multicenter, double-masked,
      parallel-group, active-controlled study, patients were randomized to receive
      glipizide 30-mg, metformin 500-mg, or glipizide/metformin 5/500 mg tablets for 18
      weeks (metformin and glipizide/metformin doses were titrated to achieve blood
      glucose control). Maximum total daily doses were glipizide 30 mg, metformin 2000 
      mg, and glipizide/ metformin 20/2000 mg. RESULTS: A total of 247 patients were
      included in the study. The mean (SD) age was 56.2 (10.1) years; 61.5% of patients
      were male; 70.0% were white, 15.8% were Hispanic/Latino, 13.0% were black, and
      1.2% were Asian/Pacific Islanders. Patients were, on average, obese (mean [SD]
      body mass index, 31.3 [4.7] kg/m2), had moderate to severe hyperglycemia (mean
      [SD] glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c], 8.7% [1.1]), and had a mean (SD) DM duration of
      6.5 (4.9) years. Glipizide/ metformin tablets controlled the HbA1c level more
      effectively than did either glipizide or metformin monotherapies (mean treatment 
      differences, in favor of glipizide/ metformin, of -1.06% and -0.98%,
      respectively, P < 0.001). At study end, an HbA1c level < 7.0% was achieved in
      approximately 4-fold more patients who were treated with glipizide/metformin
      (36.3%) compared with glipizide (8.9%) or metformin (9.9%) monotherapies.
      Glipizide/metformin tablets also reduced the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level
      and the 3-hour postprandial glucose area under the concentration-time curve more 
      effectively than did either monotherapy, without increasing the fasting insulin
      level. The greater blood glucose control with glipizide/ metformin tablets was
      achieved at a mean daily dose of glipizide/metformin 17.5/1747 mg, compared with 
      mean doses of glipizide 30.0 mg or metformin 1927 mg. Treatments were well
      tolerated, with a low incidence of symptoms of hypoglycemia evidenced by a
      fingerstick blood glucose measurement < or = 50 mg/dL in the combination group
      (12.6%); 1 patient discontinued the study treatment for this reason. No patient
      required medical assistance for hypoglycemia. CONCLUSIONS: Glipizide/metformin
      tablets were more effective than either glipizide or metformin monotherapy in
      controlling HbA1c and in reducing FPG compared with baseline in patients with
      blood glucose that was uncontrolled with previous sulfonylurea treatment. In
      addition, patients receiving glipizide/ metformin were more likely to achieve an 
      HbA1c level < 7.0%. These results were consistent with the synergistic effects on
      insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction. Glipizide/metformin was well
      tolerated, with a low incidence of hypoglycemia.

TI  - [Glimepiride--an oral antidiabetic agent].
PG  - 125-7
AB  - Glimepiride is the oral antidiabetic, second-generation sulfonylurea. It is
      structurally similar to glyburide. Glimepiride exhibited more potent
      glucose-lowering effects than glyburide and longer duration of hypoglycemic
      effect. Glimepiride is useful in the treatment of non-insulin-dependent (type II)
      diabetes mellitus. Glimepiride is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise
      for non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. Glimepiride reduces glucose levels
      blood by stimulating insulin release from functional pancreatic beta cells in
      response to glucose. Glimepiride in daily dose 1 to 8 mg is causing a
      dose-related decrease blood glucose levels and glycosylated hemoglobin fasting
      state and postprandially. If the maximum dose of glimepiride fails to lower blood
      glucose sufficiently, metformine or insuline may be added to glimepiride
      monotherapy. Glimepiride is very safe drug and adverse effects causing by
      glimepiride are very rare. The risk of hypoglycemia after use of glimepiride is
      very small, therefore is the therapy with glimepiride is more preferable than the
      therapy with glibenclamide.

TI  - Comparison of the micro- and macro-vascular effects of glimepiride and gliclazide
      in metformin-treated patients with Type 2 diabetes: a double-blind, crossover
      study.
PG  - 616-9
AB  - AIMS: To compare the metabolic and vascular effects of two sulphonylureas (SU),
      gliclazide (specific for the pancreatic [SUR1] receptor) and glimepiride (a
      nonspecific agent that also binds to vascular and cardiac [SUR2] receptors),
      during chronic administration in metformin-treated patients with Type 2 diabetes 
      (T2DM). METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, crossover study of gliclazide 80 mg 
      BID and glimepiride 2 mg OD, each for 4 weeks as add-on therapy to metformin,
      with a 4-week washout period. Patients attended four study mornings after first
      dose and 4 weeks' SU treatment for measurements of arterial distensibility (Ax), 
      pressor responsiveness to i.v. angiotensin II (ANGII), and cutaneous
      microvascular vasodilator responses to iontophoresis of acetylcholine (ACh) and
      sodium nitroprusside (SNP). RESULTS: Glycaemic responses were similar (e.g. serum
      fructosamine was 315 vs 329 micro mol l-1 after 4 weeks), and there was no change
      in augmentation index during treatment with either SU (9.1 vs 9.8 mmHg after 4
      weeks [95% confidence interval -8.1, 10.5]). Similarly, there were no differences
      between treatments in pressor responsiveness (e.g. PD10[dose of agonist required 
      to increase mean BP by 10 mmHg] for ANGII was 1.37 vs 1.68 ng kg-1 min-1[-4.3,
      6.9]) or cutaneous microvascular vasodilator responses (peak ACh response 68 +/- 
      36 vs 63 +/- 34 perfusion units [-82.7, 79.1]). CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence
      that SUR1-specific and nonspecific SUs have differential effects on arterial
      distensibility, endothelial function or vasodilator mechanisms in
      metformin-treated patients with T2DM.

TI  - Glimepiride combined with morning insulin glargine, bedtime neutral protamine
      hagedorn insulin, or bedtime insulin glargine in patients with type 2 diabetes. A
      randomized, controlled trial.
PG  - 952-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with type 2 diabetes are often treated with oral
      antidiabetic agents plus a basal insulin. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy 
      and safety of glimepiride combined with either morning or bedtime insulin
      glargine or bedtime neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin in patients with
      type 2 diabetes. DESIGN: Open-label, randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: 111
      centers in 13 European countries. PATIENTS: 695 patients with type 2 diabetes who
      were previously treated with oral antidiabetic agents. INTERVENTION:
      Randomization to treatment with morning insulin glargine, bedtime NPH insulin, or
      bedtime insulin glargine for 24 weeks in addition to 3 mg of glimepiride. The
      insulin dose was titrated by using a predefined regimen to achieve fasting blood 
      glucose levels of 5.56 mmol/L or lower (< or =100 mg/dL). MEASUREMENTS:
      Hemoglobin A(1c) values, blood glucose levels, insulin dose, and body weight.
      RESULTS: Hemoglobin A(1c) levels improved by -1.24% (two-sided 90% CI, -1.10% to 
      -1.38%) with morning insulin glargine, by -0.96% (CI, -0.81% to -1.10%) with
      bedtime insulin glargine, and by -0.84% (CI, -0.69% to -0.98%) with bedtime NPH
      insulin. Hemoglobin A(1c) improvement was more pronounced with morning insulin
      glargine than with NPH insulin (0.40% [CI, 0.23% to 0.58%]; P = 0.001) or bedtime
      insulin glargine (0.28% [CI, 0.11% to 0.46%]; P = 0.008). Baseline to end-point
      fasting blood glucose levels improved similarly in all three groups. Nocturnal
      hypoglycemia was less frequent with morning (39 of 236 patients [17%]) and
      bedtime insulin glargine (52 of 227 patients [23%]) than with bedtime NPH insulin
      (89 of 232 patients [38%]) (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The risk for nocturnal
      hypoglycemia was lower with glimepiride in combination with morning and bedtime
      insulin glargine than with glimepiride in combination with bedtime NPH insulin in
      patients with type 2 diabetes. Morning insulin glargine provided better glycemic 
      control than did bedtime insulin glargine or bedtime NPH insulin.

TI  - Thiazolidinediones in diabetes: current status and future outlook.
PG  - 406-11
AB  - Thiazolidinediones have recently emerged as promising antidiabetic drugs. Unlike 
      other oral antidiabetic drugs, thiazolidinediones function to ameliorate insulin 
      resistance, a primary factor for the development of type 2 diabetes.
      Thiazolidinediones are ligands of the nuclear receptor, peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor-gamma, and their antidiabetic effects appear to
      be mediated by activation of this receptor. The two currently marketed
      thiazolidinediones, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, display similar efficacies in
      their glucose lowering activities, but interestingly display slightly different
      clinical and side effect profiles. Understanding the molecular basis for these
      differences will help in the development of next generation thiazolidinediones
      that are more efficacious and safer for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

      or clinical evidence?].
PG  - 645-50
AB  - Theoretical and experimental research data as well as human epidemiological
      studies on large populations suggest a great difference in influencing
      cardiovascular processes and alterations among the oral antidiabetic drugs used
      in the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus. Drugs delaying or inhibiting
      carbohydrate absorption as well as insulin sensitizers have an unambiguous
      reducing effect on diabetic cardiovascular complications. Only fluid retention
      needs precaution during the treatment with thiazolidinedions in patients
      suffering from heart disease. Among insulin secretizers repaglinid, glibenclamid 
      and glipizide have an ATP-sensitive potassium channel inhibiting effect in the
      vascular smooth muscle cells, too, reducing hereby vasodilation. Glibenclamide
      also inhibits ischaemic preconditioning. Therefore, the antidiabetic drug of
      choice can be decisive in diabetic patients suffering from ischaemic heart
      diseases or peripheral obliterative disorders. In the case of secondary
      sulphonylurea resistance and/or severe ischaemic alterations insulin treatment
      becomes necessary to avoid further cardiovascular complications.

TI  - Chromium as adjunctive treatment for type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 876-85
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of
      trivalent chromium in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and hyperlipidemia. DATA
      SOURCES: The English literature was searched from 1966 through May 2002 using
      MEDLINE, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and EMBASE. The key words
      included chromium, glucose, lipids, and diabetes. Pertinent references from
      review articles and studies were used as additional sources. DATA SYNTHESIS:
      Trivalent chromium is an essential nutrient and has a key role in lipid and
      glucose metabolism. Supplementation with chromium does not appear to reduce
      glucose levels in euglycemia. It may, however, have some efficacy in reducing
      glucose levels in hyperglycemia. The effects of chromium on lipid levels are
      variable. Chromium in doses <1000 microg/d appears to be safe for short-term
      administration. Kidney function and dermatologic changes need to be monitored.
      CONCLUSIONS: Chromium appears to be a safe supplement and may have a role as
      adjunctive therapy for treatment of type 2 diabetes. Additional large-scale,
      long-term, randomized, double-blind studies examining the effect of various doses
      and forms of chromium are needed.

TI  - Addition of rosiglitazone to existing sulfonylurea treatment in chinese patients 
      with type 2 diabetes and exposure to hepatitis B or C.
PG  - 33-42
AB  - The effects of adding rosiglitazone to existing sulfonylurea (SU) treatment have 
      not previously been studied in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes and no known
      pre-existing hepatic impairment. Patients were randomized to receive
      rosiglitazone 2 mg twice daily (R4 + SU) or 4 mg twice daily (R8 + SU) or placebo
      (SU + P) for 24 weeks in addition to existing SU treatment. Most patients were
      taking concomitant glibenclamide (34%) or gliclazide (25%). Changes in
      glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and plasma
      insulin concentrations were measured. Of the 530 patients enrolled (45% male,
      mean age 59 years), 105 were in the SU + P group, 215 in the R4 + SU group, and
      210 in the R8 + SU group. The mean baseline HbA(1c) was 9.8%, and FPG was 183.8
      mg/dL. Compared with placebo, addition of rosiglitazone (2 or 4 mg twice daily)
      produced significant decreases in mean HbA(1c) (1.04% and 1.44%, respectively; p 
      < 0.0001) and FPG (21.6 and 36.0 mg/dL, respectively; p < 0.0001). There were
      statistically significant (p < 0.0001) reductions from baseline in insulin
      concentration of 23.3 and 30.4 pmol/L in the R4 + SU and R8 + SU groups,
      respectively. Despite the high prevalence of seropositivity for hepatitis B
      and/or C at baseline (56%), there was no evidence of hepatotoxicity. No
      clinically significant changes in routine hematology, biochemistry, or
      electrocardiogram were observed. The addition of rosiglitazone to SU produced
      clinically significant improvements in glycemic control in Chinese patients with 
      type 2 diabetes. Rosiglitazone plus SU was well tolerated irrespective of
      hepatitis B and C serological status.

TI  - Evaluation of the effects of nateglinide on postprandial glycemia in patients
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a multicenter, multinational, non-randomized,
      non-controlled Latin American study.
PG  - 89-95
AB  - One hundred and sixteen Latin American type 2 diabetic patients previously only
      on a diet were enrolled in this multicenter, multinational, nonrandomized,
      noncontrolled study. Only 109 completed the study. After 8 weeks of treatment
      with 120 mg of nateglinide, administered prior to each meal, the postprandial (2 
      h) glucose concentration decreased to 85.11 +/- 5.65 mg/dl (p < 0.0001), and
      HbA(1c) values decreased to 1.06 +/- 0.10% (p < 0.0001). No response differences 
      were detected in relation to age, gender, or ethnicity, but we did encounter a
      better response in recently diagnosed patients (<or=1 year). No serious adverse
      events were observed. We can, therefore, conclude that nateglinide is a
      well-tolerated, safe, and effective insulinotropic agent.

TI  - Slowly progressing type 1 diabetes: persistence of islet cell autoantibodies is
      related to glibenclamide treatment.
PG  - 469-74
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several experimental studies in rats have demonstrated that
      sulfonylurea treatment increases autoantigen expression in B-cells. This
      phenomenon may be deleterious for the preservation of residual beta cell function
      in patients with slowly progressing type 1 diabetes or latent autoimmune diabetes
      of adult (LADA). AIM/HYPOTHESIS: The aim of the present study was to evaluate
      whether the exclusion of glibenclamide in the treatment of ICA positive type 2
      diabetic patients may diminish or halt the humoral autoimmune response against
      B-cells as well as improve metabolic control and insulin secretion. SUBJECTS AND 
      METHODS: Fourteen type 2 diabetic patients with pancreatic autoimmunity (ICA+ and
      GABA+) and treated with insulin and glibenclamide (duration of disease 2.0 +/-
      2.2, range 0.1-7 years and age 53 +/- 12.5, range 36-75 years) were studied.
      Patients were randomly assigned to two treatment groups, Group 1: insulin
      monotherapy (n = 8, age 53 +/- 6.4 years) (Exclusion of glibenclamide) and, Group
      2: insulin plus glibenclamide (n = 6, age 53.5 +/- 16.9) (Unmodified treatment). 
      Both groups were investigated at the beginning of the study and after one year
      for the following parameters: ICA and anti-GAD65 antibodies, fasting glucose and 
      fasting C-peptide. RESULTS: In group 1, six out of eight patients became ICA
      negative while all patients in group 2 remained ICA positive (p = 0.0097).
      Fasting glucose concentrations improved in group 1 (4.6 +/- 2.8) in relation to
      group 2 (11.5 +/- 5.5, p = 0.0023) after one year of treatment. No differences
      were found for anti-GAD antibodies and fasting C-Peptide between the groups.
      CONCLUSIONS: These data show that exclusion of glibenclamide in the treatment of 
      ICA+ type 2 diabetic patients partially decreases specific autoimmunity against
      endocrine pancreatic cells and improves metabolic control. This may reflect
      decreased expression of B-cell autoantigens suggesting that insulin monotherapy
      is a better choice for the treatment of LADA.

TI  - Insulin analogues. A critical review.
PG  - 527-41
AB  - Multiple and important technological innovations in the field of insulin therapy 
      have appeared in the last decade. Insulin analogues with novel pharmacokinetics
      have been developed. The first of these analogues to appear in the market was
      insulin lispro. We believe that the most part of the stu-dies carried out with
      this molecule in comparison with regular insulin were unfair as long as its short
      duration of action was ignored, since in many of these studies it was
      administered with meals and with only one dose of intermediate insulin given at
      night. Several studies done mainly by Italian investigators have proven this
      concept being true in studies with adequate baseline insulin coverage. Insulin
      aspart has appeared recently in the market in the United States with very similar
      effects to lispro. The FDA has recently approved a new ultralong acting analogue.
      The main advantages are its long, peakless action with better effects during down
      hours and a lower incidence of hypoglycaemia. We also review other approaches
      with novel insulin molecules attached to thyroxin or fatty acids in order to
      create a bridge for binding to plasmatic proteins. These molecules have longer
      effects and some of them more selective sites of action. Finally we included a
      brief review of other routes of insulin administration.

TI  - Obesity and type-2 diabetes in the elderly.
PG  - 137-45
AB  - Type-2 diabetes is common in the elderly and when compounded by obesity presents 
      a major challenge for the physician. Obesity plays a central role in the
      aetiology and pathogenesis of type-2 diabetes. Body weight is determined by an
      interaction between genetic, environmental and psychosocial factors acting
      through the physiological mediators of energy intake and expenditure. Obesity is 
      thought to predispose to type-2 diabetes primarily by causing insulin resistance.
      Education and changes in lifestyle remain the key issues in obesity management.
      Anti-obesity drugs may delay the onset of diabetes but there is limited
      experience of their use in elderly patients. Obesity should not be viewed as a
      cosmetic problem that affects a few individuals, but a major health hazard that
      is both preventable and amenable to treatment.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of nateglinide in the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 467-8
AB  - Nateglinide a new short-acting D-phenylalanine derivative represents a new
      chemical class of drugs for treating type 2 diabetes that is pharmacologically
      and therapeutically distinct from currently existing agents. Studies in normal
      patients and those with type 2 diabetes have shown that nateglinide reduces
      mealtime blood glucose excursions by physiologic regulation of insulin secretion.
      Nateglinide binds to and inhibits the K+(ATP) channel of the beta-cell, causing
      membrane depolarisation, with a subsequent influx of extracellular calcium that
      results in insulin secretion. A total of 105 patients in 5 centres with type II
      diabetes mellitus were taken according to the inclusion criteria and given drug
      treatment and were evaluated on their improvement in fasting and postprandial
      plasma glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin values for efficacy, besides
      physician's assessment of the overall safety and efficacy. Nateglinide in a dose 
      of 60 mg before three main meals was given and increased to a maximum of 120 mg
      thrice daily over the first 3-4 weeks. Nateglinide had to be taken 10 minutes
      before meals. Duration of treatment was 12 weeks. The patients showed decrease in
      fasting plasma glucose from 2nd week onwards and reduction in glycosylated
      haemoglobin by 6th week onwards. Postprandial glucose reduction was also
      significant at the end of 12th week. The frequency of adverse effects was low and
      no serious adverse effects were encountered.

TI  - Oral hypoglycaemic agent failure.
PG  - 452-6
AB  - Type 2 diabetic patients initially respond satisfactorily to diet, exercise and
      oral hypoglycaemic agents (OHA), but a fraction of them acquires resistance to
      drugs, right from the beginning (primary OHA failure) or in due course of time
      (secondary OHA failure) and becomes insulin requiring ultimately. Poor diet
      compliance and deterioration of beta-cell function are major causes of OHA
      failure and annual incidence is 3 to 30%. Keeping in mind the benefit of organ
      salvage in diabetes, failure with OHA treatment should be detected earliest and
      necessary measures adopted as early as possible. Recognition, appraisal and
      assessment of total problem can help a diabetic to enjoy a normal life.

TI  - Oral magnesium supplementation improves insulin sensitivity and metabolic control
      in type 2 diabetic subjects: a randomized double-blind controlled trial.
PG  - 1147-52
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether oral magnesium supplementation (as magnesium
      chloride [MgCl(2)] solution) improves both insulin sensitivity and metabolic
      control in type 2 diabetic subjects with decreased serum magnesium levels.
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study was a clinical randomized double-blind
      placebo-controlled trial. A total of 63 subjects with type 2 diabetes and
      decreased serum magnesium (serum magnesium levels </=0.74 mmol/l) treated by
      glibenclamide received either 50 ml MgCl(2) solution (containing 50 g MgCl(2) per
      1,000 ml solution) or placebo daily for 16 weeks. Chronic diarrhea, alcoholism,
      use of diuretic and/or calcium antagonist drugs, and reduced renal function were 
      exclusion criteria. Homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)
      was used as the parameter of insulin sensitivity and glucose and HbA(1c) as
      parameters of metabolic control. RESULTS: At the end of the study, subjects who
      received magnesium supplementation showed significant higher serum magnesium
      concentration (0.74 +/- 0.10 vs. 0.65 +/- 0.07 mmol/l, P = 0.02) and lower
      HOMA-IR index (3.8 +/- 1.1 vs. 5.0 +/- 1.3, P = 0.005), fasting glucose levels
      (8.0 +/- 2.4 vs. 10.3 +/- 2.1 mmol/l, P = 0.01), and HbA(1c) (8.0 +/- 2.4 vs.
      10.1 +/- 3.3%, P = 0.04) than control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Oral supplementation
      with MgCl(2) solution restores serum magnesium levels, improving insulin
      sensitivity and metabolic control in type 2 diabetic patients with decreased
      serum magnesium levels.

TI  - Maternal-fetal transport of hypoglycaemic drugs.
PG  - 303-13
AB  - Due to legal, ethical and monetary problems, drug studies in pregnancy are rare. 
      Numerous pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes occur in pregnancy that can 
      affect the efficacy and safety of drugs, and these are difficult to predict
      without appropriate studies. Drugs potentially useful and safe in pregnancy have 
      to either not cross the placenta and/or be harmless to the fetus at clinically
      relevant concentrations. The first characteristic can be predicted using in vitro
      models such as the placenta perfusion model. In the case of glibenclamide
      (glyburide), in vitro experiments showed minimal maternal-fetal transfer, leading
      to completion of a successful clinical trial of this drug in gestational
      diabetes. Insulin, the main drug used in diabetes during pregnancy, has also been
      shown not to cross the placenta in vitro, as has insulin lispro. Animal insulin
      may cross the placenta when complexed with anti-insulin antibodies. Other
      sulphonylurea drugs (tolbutamide and chlorpropamide) have been shown to cross the
      placenta both in vitro and in vivo and to produce toxicity in the fetus. This
      review summarises the pharmacokinetic data available for hypoglycaemic drugs
      during pregnancy, as well as the potential role for the in vitro placenta
      perfusion model in the preclinical evaluation of drugs with potential usefulness 
      in pregnancy.

TI  - The relative contributions of insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction to the
      pathophysiology of Type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 3-19
AB  - The relative contributions of insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction to the
      pathophysiology of Type 2 diabetes have been debated extensively. The concept
      that a feedback loop governs the interaction of the insulin-sensitive tissues and
      the beta cell as well as the elucidation of the hyperbolic relationship between
      insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion explains why insulin-resistant subjects
      exhibit markedly increased insulin responses while those who are
      insulin-sensitive have low responses. Consideration of this hyperbolic
      relationship has helped identify the critical role of beta-cell dysfunction in
      the development of Type 2 diabetes and the demonstration of reduced beta-cell
      function in high risk subjects. Furthermore, assessments in a number of ethnic
      groups emphasise that beta-cell function is a major determinant of oral glucose
      tolerance in subjects with normal and reduced glucose tolerance and that in all
      populations the progression from normal to impaired glucose tolerance and
      subsequently to Type 2 diabetes is associated with declining insulin sensitivity 
      and beta-cell function. The genetic and molecular basis for these reductions in
      insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function are not fully understood but it does
      seem that body-fat distribution and especially intra-abdominal fat are major
      determinants of insulin resistance while reductions in beta-cell mass contribute 
      to beta-cell dysfunction. Based on our greater understanding of the relative
      roles of insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction in Type 2 diabetes, we can 
      anticipate advances in the identification of genes contributing to the
      development of the disease as well as approaches to the treatment and prevention 
      of Type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of nateglinide in renally impaired diabetic patients.
PG  - 163-70
AB  - Treatment of hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes mellitus and renal
      insufficiency is complicated by altered pharmacokinetics of hypoglycemic agents. 
      This study evaluated the pharmacokinetic profile and safety of nateglinide, an
      amino acid derivative that improves early phase insulin secretion and reduces
      mealtime glucose excursions. This open-label, single-dose, two-center study
      included patients (mean age = 57 +/- 10 years) with type 1 or 2 diabetes with
      impaired renal function (IRF) (n = 10) or with renal failure undergoing
      hemodialysis (n = 10). Both groups were compared with age-, sex-, height-, and
      weight-matched healthy controls (n = 20). All participants received a single
      120-mg dose of nateglinide immediately before breakfast. Pharmacokinetic and
      safety evaluations were undertaken up to 48 hours postdose. All 40 subjects
      completed the study. Plasma nateglinide concentrations increased rapidly in
      patients undergoing dialysis and matched healthy subjects (tmax = 0.95 vs. 0.78
      h, respectively) and was comparable with patients with IRF and matched healthy
      subjects (tmax = 0.80 vs. 0.65 h, respectively). There were no statistically
      significant differences for Cmax or AUC0-t between the groups. Nateglinide was
      eliminated rapidly in all groups (t1/2 = 1.9-2.8 h). There was no correlation
      between the level of renal function and systemic exposure. There was a low extent
      of renal excretion of nateglinide in healthy subjects (11%) and diabetic patients
      with IRF (3%). Nateglinide was well tolerated. These data suggest that
      nateglinide is suitable for use in diabetic patients with IRF or with renal
      failure undergoing dialysis. Given the comparable absorption and elimination
      profiles of nateglinide in renally impaired and healthy subjects, no dose
      adjustment appears necessary in the renally impaired.

TI  - Use of octreotide to treat prolonged sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycemia in a
      patient with chronic renal failure.
PG  - 86-9
AB  - A diabetic patient with chronic renal failure who developed recurrent and
      prolonged episodes of hypoglycemia associated with use of sulfonylurea agent is
      presented here. This patient was hospitalized with neuroglycopenic symptoms of
      hypoglycemia that persisted in spite of large doses of parenteral glucose
      replacement. On administration of somatostatin analogue octreotide, hypoglycemia 
      resolved and, blood glucose levels were maintained even after cessation of
      parenteral glucose. The patient received 2 subcutaneous doses of octreotide 12
      hours apart, and made a complete recovery. Our experience suggests that use of
      octerotide to treat refractory or prolonged sulfonylurea-included hypoglycemia in
      renal failure patients is safe and effective; large prospective studies would be 
      needed to validate these findings.

TI  - Beneficial effects of a glyburide/metformin combination preparation in type 2
      diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 66-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by both insulin deficiency 
      and insulin resistance. Effective treatment often requires therapy directed at
      both abnormalities. Patients on monotherapy might benefit from a combination
      agent such as glyburide/metformin, which increases insulin secretion and reduces 
      insulin resistance. METHODS: All patients taking a glyburide/metformin
      preparation at the Carl T. Hayden VAMC were identified from pharmacy records.
      Patients with documented hemoglobin A values within 31 weeks prior and between 3 
      and 33 weeks after initiation of therapy (92 subjects) were examined. RESULTS:
      Glyburide/metformin combination therapy reduced hemoglobin A levels from 0.087 to
      0.083 (P < 0.06). Significant reductions were seen in those patients with initial
      levels higher than 0.08 (0.094 to 0.087; P < 0.01). No significant reductions
      were seen in those patients with initial levels lower than 0.08. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      patients on monotherapy or on dual oral therapy with inadequate control, changing
      to a glyburide/metformin combination preparation may improve glucose control.

TI  - Population PKPD modelling of the long-term hypoglycaemic effect of gliclazide
      given as a once-a-day modified release (MR) formulation.
PG  - 147-57
AB  - AIMS: To study the relationship between the pharmacokinetics (PK) of gliclazide
      and its long-term pharmacodynamic (PD) effect in a large population of Type 2
      diabetic patients and to identify factors predicting intersubject variability.
      METHODS: A PKPD database of 634 Type 2 diabetic patients with a total of 5,258
      fasting plasma glucose (FPG) samples was built up from the data collected during 
      the clinical development of a modified release formulation of gliclazide
      (gliclazide MR). The PKPD analysis used a nonlinear mixed effect modelling
      approach. A mixture model was used to identify patients with a FPG response to
      treatment. In patients identified as responders, the decrease in FPG was related 
      to gliclazide exposure (AUC) by an Emax relationship. An effect compartment was
      used to describe the link between PK and PD. A linear disease-progression model
      was used to assess the glycaemic deterioration observable over several months of 
      treatment. Simulations were performed to evaluate the predictive performance of
      the PKPD model and to illustrate the time course of the antidiabetic effect of
      gliclazide MR. RESULTS: Disease state was found to be the main explanatory factor
      for intersubject variability in response to gliclazide. The percentage of
      responders to gliclazide, used as monotherapy, increased inversely to the number 
      of classes of antidiabetic agents received prior to entry in the studies. In
      responders, the initial dose (30 mg) of the gliclazide MR dosing regimen induced 
      half of the maximum hypoglycaemic effect. The equilibration half-life between the
      PK and PD steady states was 3 weeks (intersubject variability of 84%). The rate
      of disease progression was 0.84 mmol l(-1) year(-1) (intersubject variability
      143%). The PKPD model adequately predicted the FPG profiles of 234 patients who
      received the current formulation of gliclazide. Simulation of a 1-year parallel
      dose ranging clinical trial illustrated the influence of dose, time and type of
      previous antidiabetic treatment on the percentage of patients with clinically
      significant improvement of blood glucose control. CONCLUSIONS: This population
      PKPD analysis has characterized the relationship between the exposure to
      gliclazide and its long-term hypoglycaemic effect, and has established that the
      intersubject variability in response is mostly related to disease state. These
      results underline the clinical interest of quickly increasing the dose of
      gliclazide MR according to the response to treatment in order to achieve
      effective blood glucose control.

TI  - Rosiglitazone reduces urinary albumin excretion in type II diabetes.
PG  - 7-12
AB  - This study examines the effect of rosiglitazone on urinary albumin excretion
      (UAE) in patients with type II diabetes. Urinary albumin: creatinine ratio (ACR) 
      was measured in a 52-week, open-label, cardiac safety study comparing
      rosiglitazone and glyburide. Patients were randomised to treatment with
      rosiglitazone 4 mg b.i.d. or glyburide. ACR was measured at baseline and after 28
      and 52 weeks of treatment. Statistically significant reductions from baseline in 
      ACR were observed in both treatment groups at week 28. By week 52, only the
      rosiglitazone group showed a significant reduction from baseline. Similar results
      were observed for the overall study population and for the subset of patients
      with baseline microalbuminuria. For patients with microalbuminuria at baseline,
      reductions in ACR did not correlate strongly with reductions in glycosylated
      haemoglobin, or fasting plasma glucose, but showed strong correlation with
      changes in mean 24-h systolic and diastolic blood pressure for
      rosiglitazone-treated patients (deltaACR vs deltamean 24-h systolic blood
      pressure, r=0.875; deltaACR vs deltamean 24-h diastolic blood pressure, r=0.755; 
      P < 0.05 for both). No such correlation was observed for glyburide-treated
      patients. In conclusion, rosiglitazone treatment was associated with a decrease
      in urinary albumin excretion. These findings suggest a potential beneficial
      effect of rosiglitazone in the treatment or prevention of renal and vascular
      complications of type II diabetes.

TI  - Multifactorial intervention and cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2
      diabetes.
PG  - 383-93
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular morbidity is a major burden in patients with type 2
      diabetes. In the Steno-2 Study, we compared the effect of a targeted,
      intensified, multifactorial intervention with that of conventional treatment on
      modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2
      diabetes and microalbuminuria. METHODS: The primary end point of this open,
      parallel trial was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal
      myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, revascularization, and amputation. Eighty
      patients were randomly assigned to receive conventional treatment in accordance
      with national guidelines and 80 to receive intensive treatment, with a stepwise
      implementation of behavior modification and pharmacologic therapy that targeted
      hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and microalbuminuria, along with
      secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease with aspirin. RESULTS: The mean
      age of the patients was 55.1 years, and the mean follow-up was 7.8 years. The
      decline in glycosylated hemoglobin values, systolic and diastolic blood pressure,
      serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels measured after an overnight fast, and
      urinary albumin excretion rate were all significantly greater in the
      intensive-therapy group than in the conventional-therapy group. Patients
      receiving intensive therapy also had a significantly lower risk of cardiovascular
      disease (hazard ratio, 0.47; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.24 to 0.73),
      nephropathy (hazard ratio, 0.39; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.17 to 0.87),
      retinopathy (hazard ratio, 0.42; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.21 to 0.86),
      and autonomic neuropathy (hazard ratio, 0.37; 95 percent confidence interval,
      0.18 to 0.79). CONCLUSIONS: A target-driven, long-term, intensified intervention 
      aimed at multiple risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes and
      microalbuminuria reduces the risk of cardiovascular and microvascular events by
      about 50 percent.

TI  - Plasma adiponectin plays an important role in improving insulin resistance with
      glimepiride in elderly type 2 diabetic subjects.
PG  - 285-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effect of glimepiride, a third-generation
      sulfonylurea hypoglycemic agent, on insulin resistance in elderly patients with
      type 2 diabetes, in connection with plasma adiponectin and 8-epi-prostagrandin
      F2alpha (8-epi-PGF2alpha), an oxidative stress marker. RESEARCH DESIGN AND
      METHODS: A total of 17 elderly patients with type 2 diabetes received 12 weeks of
      treatment with glimepiride. Homeostasis assessment model of insulin resistance
      (HOMA-IR), homeostasis assessment model of beta-cell function, HbA(1c), C-peptide
      in 24-h pooled urine (urine CPR), and plasma concentrations of 8-epi-PGF2alpha,
      tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1, 
      and adiponectin were measured at various times. The metabolic clearance rate of
      glucose (MCR-g) was also assessed by a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp.
      RESULTS: After 8 weeks of glimepiride treatment, significant reductions were
      observed in HbA(1c) (from 8.4 +/- 1.9 to 6.9 +/- 1.0%), HOMA-IR (from 2.54 +/-
      2.25 to 1.69 +/- 0.95%), and plasma TNF-alpha concentrations (from 4.0 +/- 2.0 to
      2.6 +/- 2.5 pg/ml). MCR-g was significantly increased from 3.92 +/- 1.09 to 5.73 
      +/- 1.47 mg. kg(-1). min(-1). Plasma adiponectin increased from 6.61 +/- 3.06 to 
      10.2 +/- 7.14 micro g/ml. In control subjects, who maintained conventional
      treatment, no significant changes were observed in any of these markers.
      CONCLUSIONS: Glimepiride remarkably improved insulin resistance, suggested by a
      significant reduction in HOMA-IR, an increase in MCR-g, and a reduction in
      HbA(1c) without changing extrapancreatic beta-cell function and urine CPR.

TI  - Influence of treatment with acarbose or glibenclamide on insulin sensitivity in
      type 2 diabetic patients.
PG  - 38-44
AB  - AIM: The aim of our double-blind, placebo-controlled study was to compare the
      effect of acarbose and glibenclamide on the insulin sensitivity in type 2
      diabetes. METHODS: We investigated 77 patients (mean age 58.7 years, mean BMI
      27.3 kg/m2), treated by diet alone for at least 4 weeks. The subjects were
      randomized into three treatment groups for 16 weeks: 100 mg t.i.d. acarbose (n = 
      25) or 1 mg t.i.d. glibenclamide (n = 27) or one t.i.d. placebo (n = 25). Before 
      and after therapy, the levels of fasting plasma glucose, glycosylated
      haemoglobin, fasting insulin, plasma glucose and insulin 1 h after a standardized
      breakfast were measured and insulin sensitivity determined by euglycaemic
      hyperinsulinaemic clamp test. RESULTS: After the treatment period, BMI in the
      acarbose and placebo group decreased significantly, whereas in the glibenclamide 
      group a significant increase was observed. Fasting plasma glucose was only
      significant reduced under glibenclamide. The postprandial glucose decreased
      significantly after acarbose (13.8 vs. 11.4 mmol/l, p < 0.05) and glibenclamide
      treatment (14.6 vs. 11.4 mmol/l, p < 0.05) and was unchanged under placebo (13.8 
      vs. 13.7 mmol/l). The fasting insulin levels remained unchanged in all three
      groups, whereas postprandial insulin values increased significantly under
      glibenclamide. Neither acarbose nor glibenclamide significantly changed insulin
      sensitivity [acarbose: glucose disposal rate before treatment 2.3 mg/kg body
      weight/min/insulin, after treatment 3.2; glibenclamide 2.2 vs. 2.1; placebo 2.6
      vs. 3.0]. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show a more substantial improvement of glucose
      control under glibenclamide than under acarbose which, however, was not
      associated with an increase of insulin sensitivity.

TI  - Molecular basis for Kir6.2 channel inhibition by adenine nucleotides.
PG  - 266-76
AB  - K(ATP) channels are comprised of a pore-forming protein, Kir6.x, and the
      sulfonylurea receptor, SURx. Interaction of adenine nucleotides with Kir6.2
      positively charged amino acids such as K185 and R201 on the C-terminus causes
      channel closure. Substitution of these amino acids with other positively charged 
      residues had small effects on inhibition by adenine nucleotide, while
      substitution with neutral or negative residues had major effects, suggesting
      electrostatic interactions between Kir6.2 positive charges and adenine nucleotide
      negative phosphate groups. Furthermore, R201 mutation decreased channel
      sensitivity to ATP, ADP, and AMP to a similar extent, but K185 mutation decreased
      primarily ATP and ADP sensitivity, leaving the AMP sensitivity relatively
      unaffected. Thus, channel inhibition by ATP may involve interaction of the
      alpha-phosphate with R201 and interaction of the beta-phosphate with K185. In
      addition, decreased open probability due to rundown or sulfonylureas caused an
      increase in ATP sensitivity in the K185 mutant, but not in the R201 mutant. Thus,
      the beta-phosphate may bind in a state-independent fashion to K185 to destabilize
      channel openings, while R201 interacts with the alpha-phosphate to stabilize a
      channel closed configuration. Substitution of R192 on the C-terminus and R50 on
      the N-terminus with different charged residues also affected ATP sensitivity.
      Based on these results a structural scheme is proposed, which includes features
      of other recently published models.

TI  - The angiotensin-receptor blockers: from antihypertensives to cardiovascular
      all-round medications in 10 years?
PG  - 328-38
AB  - Angiotensin-receptor blockers have been part of the antihypertensive treatment
      armamentarium since the mid-1990s. During this period, the number of agents has
      increased greatly, as has the number of indications for which these drugs are
      being tested in randomized controlled clinical trials. Beginning as efficacious
      and very well tolerated antihypertensives, angiotensin-receptor blockers have
      been shown to have benefits in patients with diabetes and heart failure that are 
      not only attributable to the reduced blood pressure, as supported by recently
      concluded trials. The expanding treatment areas with these agents widen the
      interest in their applicability across the entire cardiovascular continuum. A
      number of large-scale studies set to report within the next few years will
      further determine the effects of angiotensin-receptor blockers in a range of
      cardiovascular indications beyond hypertension.

TI  - Tolbutamide, flurbiprofen, and losartan as probes of CYP2C9 activity in humans.
PG  - 84-91
AB  - The metabolic activity of CYP2C9 in 16 subjects expressing four different
      genotypes (CYP2C9*1/*1, *1/*2, *1/*3, and *2/*2) was evaluated. Single oral doses
      of tolbutamide, flurbiprofen, and losartan were administered in a randomized,
      crossover design. Plasma and urine were collected over 24 hours. The urinary
      metabolic ratio and amount of metabolite(s) excreted were correlated with
      formation clearance. The formation clearance of tolbutamide to its
      CYP2C9-mediated metabolites demonstrated a stronger association with genotype
      compared to flurbiprofen and losartan, respectively (r2 = 0.64 vs. 0.53 vs.
      0.42). A statistically significant correlation was observed between formation
      clearance of tolbutamide and the 0- to 12-hour urinary amount of
      4'-hydroxytolbutamide and carboxytolbutamide (r = 0.84). Compared to tolbutamide,
      the correlations observed between the respective measures of flurbiprofen and
      losartan metabolism were not as strong. Tolbutamide is a better CYP2C9 probe than
      flurbiprofen and losartan, and the 0- to 12-hour amount of 4'-hydroxytolbutamide 
      and carboxytolbutamide is the best urinary measure of its metabolism.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of repaglinide in healthy caucasian and Japanese subjects.
PG  - 23-8
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics of three
      different single doses (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg) of repaglinide in healthy Caucasian
      and Japanese subjects. In this single-center, open-label, randomized,
      three-period crossover study, 27 healthy male subjects (15 Caucasian and 12
      Japanese) each received three different single doses of repaglinide (0.5, 1.0,
      and 2.0 mg) at consecutive 24-hour intervals. Pharmacokinetic profiles, including
      area under the curve (AUC0-t), maximum serum concentration (Cmax), time to Cmax
      (tmax), and half-life (t1/2), were determined for each dose of repaglinide. The
      relative change in blood glucose level (RC1h) and area under the blood glucose
      curve (AUGC0-1) at 1 hour after dose were also measured. After oral dosing, both 
      Cmax and AUC0-t increased linearly with dose within the 0.5- to 2.0-mg dose
      range, regardless of ethnic group. Both Cmax and AUC0-t were significantly higher
      in Japanese subjects than in Caucasian subjects. At each dose of repaglinide,
      Cmax and AUC were statistically significantly higher in Japanese than in
      Caucasian subjects (p = 0.0038 and 0.023, respectively). Discrepancies in body
      weight and body mass index (BMI) between Caucasian and Japanese subjects could
      not explain the between-group differences in Cmax or AUC0-t. Statistically
      significant differences in pharmacodynamic parameters (RC1h and AUGC0-1) were
      found between ethnic groups (p < 0.0001), the difference being more pronounced
      for RC1h than AUGC0-1. At a dose of 2.0 mg, the mean decrease in RC1h was 41% for
      Japanese subjects and 24% for Caucasian subjects. Hypoglycemic reactions were
      more common at the highest dose (2.0 mg), where they were observed more
      frequently in Japanese (7 cases) than in Caucasian subjects (4 cases). It was
      concluded that higher serum levels of repaglinide and greater reductions in blood
      glucose levels are found in Japanese than in Caucasian subjects following a
      single oral dose of repaglinide within the 0.5- to 2.0-mg dose range. Repaglinide
      is well tolerated in both ethnic groups. The results indicate that glycemic
      control targets may be achieved at lower doses within the recommended range
      (0.5-4.0 mg/meal) when repaglinide is used to treat Japanese patients in
      comparison to Caucasian patients.

TI  - Effects of inhibition of ATP-sensitive potassium channels on metabolic
      vasodilation in the human forearm.
PG  - 39-46
AB  - Experimental data suggest that vascular ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channels
      may be an important determinant of functional hyperaemia, but the contribution of
      K(ATP) channels to exercise-induced hyperaemia in humans is unknown. Forearm
      blood flow was assessed in 39 healthy subjects (23 males/16 females; age 22+/-4
      years) using the technique of venous occlusion plethysmography. Resting forearm
      blood flow and functional hyperaemic blood flow (FHBF) were measured before and
      after brachial artery infusion of the K(ATP) channel inhibitors glibenclamide (at
      two different doses: 15 and 100 microg/min) and gliclazide (at 300 microg/min).
      FHBF was induced by 2 min of non-ischaemic wrist flexion-extension exercise at 45
      cycles/min. Compared with vehicle (isotonic saline), glibenclamide at either 15
      microg/min or 100 microg/min did not significantly alter resting forearm blood
      flow or peak FHBF. The blood volume repaid at 1 and 5 min after exercise was not 
      diminished by glibenclamide. Serum glucose was unchanged after glibenclamide, but
      plasma insulin rose by 36% (from 7.2+/-0.8 to 9.8+/-1.3 m-units/l; P =0.02) and
      150% (from 9.1+/-1.3 to 22.9+/-3.5 m-units/l; P =0.002) after the 15 and 100
      microg/min infusions respectively. Gliclazide also did not affect resting forearm
      blood flow, peak FHBF, or the blood volume repaid at 1 and 5 min after exercise, 
      compared with vehicle (isotonic glucose). Gliclazide induced a 12% fall in serum 
      glucose (P =0.009) and a 38% increase in plasma insulin (P =0.001). Thus
      inhibition of vascular K(ATP) channels with glibenclamide or gliclazide does not 
      appear to affect resting forearm blood flow or FHBF in healthy humans. These
      findings suggest that vascular K(ATP) channels may not play an important role in 
      regulating basal vascular tone or skeletal muscle metabolic vasodilation in the
      forearm of healthy human subjects.

TI  - [Aspects of antihyperglycemic oral bitherapy in 76 cases of non insulindependent 
      diabetes in Dakar].
PG  - 319-22
AB  - Some reasons justify the introduction of the association of sulfonylurea and
      metformine when monotherapy is ineffective. Hereafter a period of monotherapy by 
      sulfonylurea or metformine only bitherapy has been instituted. Socio-demography, 
      number of consultations, type of monotherapy and of association, duration of
      treatment, body mass index, fasting blood glycemia and post-prandial glycemia,
      blood pressure and type of complication were studied. There were 2.5 times more
      women than men with lower mean age for women. The majority of patients were from 
      Dakar (81.6%). More than half of patients were women at home (60.5%). Present
      obesity (plethoric diabetes) or past obesity (metaplethoric diabetes) concerned
      90.3% of patients. Patients have done 9.14 4.39 consultations under bitherapy.
      The gliclazide-metformin association was observed 37 times and the
      glibenclamide-metformin association 67 times. The duration of monotherapy was
      45.9 39.7 months and that of bitherapy 92.5 43.7 months. The variations of body
      mass index showed a diminution of 1.26 kg/m2 and for fasting blood glycemia and
      augmentation of 0.011 g/L and post-prandial a diminution of 0.05 g/L. The body
      mass index variations in diabetic patients showed a diminution of weight more in 
      plethoric patients in bitherapy compared to monotherapy. This study is
      retrospective and cannot show the optimal efficacy of bitherapy. But the
      combination of enhancement of glucose captation and lowering of hepatic glucose
      production has been shown during this bitherapeutic association. Addition of
      metformine and treatment with sulfonylurea make a combination that
      significatively improves glycemic control but also cholesterol level and allows
      obtation of better weight in type 2 non insulin-dependent diabetes with
      insulinoresistance.

TI  - Does type 2 diabetes mellitus delay renal failure in autosomal dominant
      polycystic kidney disease?
PG  - 803-13
AB  - Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common renal disease
      without an effective therapeutic intervention to delay renal failure. Within
      kindreds, renal dysfunction often develops at a similar age in affected
      individuals, although there are known modifying factors. Two kindreds with ADPKD 
      have shown a striking pattern of delayed onset of renal insufficiency in those
      individuals also suffering from type 2 diabetes mellitus. Eight nondiabetic
      patients with ADPKD had onset of dialysis or renal death at ages 38-52 years,
      (mean +/- SEM 46 +/- 1.9, n = 7) as compared with four diabetics who started
      dialysis or are still off dialysis at the age of 61 +/- 2.8 years (p < 0.01). Two
      of the four diabetics still have reasonable renal function at age 61 and 66. The 
      diabetes was diagnosed at age 32 +/- 2 years and was treated with oral
      hypoglycemics for 19 +/- 2 years before institution of insulin. Cardiovascular
      disease dominated the clinical picture in the diabetics. In conclusion, onset of 
      renal failure in ADPKD was delayed for over 15 years in individuals who also
      suffered from type 2 diabetes mellitus, in two ADPKD kindreds. Possible
      mechanisms are discussed, including glibenclamide inhibition of the cystic
      fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. The striking delay associated with 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus in ADPKD induced renal failure should be evaluated
      further.

TI  - Rosiglitazone and pioglitazone: new preparations. Two new oral antidiabetics both
      poorly assessed.
PG  - 170-6
AB  - (1) Treatment of type 2 (non insulin-dependent) diabetes is based on lifestyle
      measures and management of cardiovascular risk. (2) The reference first-line drug
      therapy for type 2 diabetes, when drug therapy is needed, is single-agent
      treatment with metformin (a biguanide) for overweight patients, or with
      glibenclamide (a glucose-lowering sulphonylurea) for other patients. (3) If
      monotherapy fails to control blood glucose levels adequately, most clinical
      guidelines then recommend a combination of metformin with a glucose-lowering
      sulphonylurea, although the few available comparative clinical data raise the
      possibility of excess mortality with this treatment. (4) Rosiglitazone and
      pioglitazone (glitazones that reduce insulin resistance) have been authorized in 
      the European Union for combination with a glucose-lowering sulphonylurea (for
      patients in whom metformin is ineffective or poorly tolerated) or with metformin 
      (for obese patients). (5) None of the available trials of rosiglitazone and
      pioglitazone include data on mortality or morbidity. (6) There are fewer data on 
      pioglitazone than on rosiglitazone. (7) According to short-term comparative
      trials, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone are more effective than placebo on blood
      glucose levels. Combinations of rosiglitazone or pioglitazone with metformin or
      with glucose-lowering sulphonylureas have not been compared with the metformin + 
      glucose-lowering sulphonylurea combination or with insulin. (8) Rosiglitazone and
      pioglitazone frequently cause weight gain. (9) Pioglitazone has a slightly
      favourable effect on lipid profiles, unlike rosiglitazone, which increases
      LDL-cholesterol levels. (10) The main side effect of rosiglitazone and
      pioglitazone is sodium and water retention, which can provoke oedema, anaemia (by
      haemodilution), and even heart failure. Rosiglitazone and pioglitazone are also
      hepatotoxic. (11) Combining rosiglitazone with insulin is contraindicated, owing 
      to the increased risk of heart failure. The same applies to pioglitazone. (12) In
      practice, neither rosiglitazone nor pioglitazone has a place in the management of
      type 2 diabetes, except in the context of strictly controlled long-term
      comparative clinical trials.

TI  - High-throughput inhibition screening of major human cytochrome P450 enzymes using
      an in vitro cocktail and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.
PG  - 1459-67
AB  - A method has been developed for the high-throughput inhibition screening of the
      major human cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and
      CYP3A4) using an in vitro substrate cocktail and liquid chromatography-tandem
      mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). A cocktail consisting of the selective substrates
      phenacetin (CYP1A2), tolbutamide (CYP2C9), omeprazole (CYP2C19), bufuralol
      (CYP2D6), and midazolam (CYP3A4) was incubated with human liver microsomes. The
      metabolic reactions were terminated with methanol containing dextrorphan as an
      internal standard. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was analyzed by
      LC-MS-MS employing a fast gradient. The concentrations of the substrate
      metabolites-paracetamol, 4-hydroxytolbutamide, 5-hydroxyomeprazole,
      1'-hydroxybufuralol, and 1'-hydroxymidazolam-in each sample were determined by
      LC-MS-MS in a single assay. The method was validated by incubating known CYP
      inhibitors (furafylline, CYP1A2; sulfaphenazole, CYP2C9; s-mephenytoin, CYP2C19; 
      quinidine, CYP2D6; and troleandomycin, CYP3A4) with the individual substrates
      they were known to inhibit and with the substrate cocktail. IC50s (microM)
      determined using the substrate cocktail were in good agreement with those
      obtained with individual substrates (furafylline, 2.9 vs. 2.0; sulfaphenazole,
      0.75 vs. 0.72; s-mephenytoin, 170 vs. 180; quinidine, 0.17 vs. 0.24;
      troleandomycin, 2.6 vs. 3.2) and with previously reported values in the
      literature.

TI  - Oral anti diabetic polychemotherapy in type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 350-3
AB  - The therapeutic guidelines of the seventies for type 2 diabetic patients was a
      monotherapy which choice was based on the BMI of the patient and a bitherapy in
      case of a blood glucose increase. The pathophysiologic knowledge on type 2
      diabetes has moved and the disease is nowadays more complex with a loss of the
      beta cell mass and an insulin resistance state of the liver, muscle and adipocyte
      tissue associated with a defect in gastro-intestinal hormones in the postprandial
      state. The pathophysiologic knowledge and the existence of new therapeutic agents
      led us to discuss oral antidiabetic polychemotherapy at the first drug
      prescription. This intuitive proposition has no evidence-based arguments with
      prospective long-term studies that would demonstrate the benefit of such a
      proposition. Moreover, if nowadays we can imagine a tritherapy proposition,
      progress in chemistry research will conduct to a quadri- and penta-therapy with
      expected difficulties in therapeutic compliance of the patient.

TI  - Nateglinide improves early insulin secretion and controls postprandial glucose
      excursions in a prediabetic population.
PG  - 2141-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the metabolic effectiveness,
      safety, and tolerability of nateglinide in subjects with impaired glucose
      tolerance (IGT) and to identify a dose appropriate for use in a diabetes
      prevention study. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This multicenter, double-blind,
      randomized, parallel-group, fixed-dose study of 8 weeks' duration was performed
      in a total of 288 subjects with IGT using a 2:2:2:1 randomization. Subjects
      received nateglinide (30, 60, and 120 mg) or placebo before each main meal.
      Metabolic effectiveness was assessed during a standardized meal challenge
      performed before and after the 8-week treatment. All adverse events (AEs) were
      recorded, and confirmed hypoglycemia was defined as symptoms accompanied by a
      self-monitoring of blood glucose measurement < or =3.3 mmol/l (plasma glucose <
      or =3.7 mmol/l). RESULTS: Nateglinide elicited a dose-related increase of insulin
      and a decrease of glucose during standardized meal challenges, with the
      predominant effect on early insulin release, leading to a substantial reduction
      in peak plasma glucose levels. Nateglinide was well tolerated, and symptoms of
      hypoglycemia were the only treatment-emergent AEs. Confirmed hypoglycemia
      occurred in 28 subjects receiving nateglinide (30 mg, 0 [0%]; 60 mg, 5 [6.6%];
      120 mg, 23 [26.7%]) and in 1 (2.3%) subject receiving placebo. CONCLUSIONS:
      Nateglinide was safe and effective in reducing postprandial hyperglycemia in
      subjects with IGT. Preprandial doses of 30 or 60 mg nateglinide would be
      appropriate to use for longer-term studies to determine whether a rapid-onset,
      rapidly reversible, insulinotropic agent can delay or prevent the development of 
      type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Effect of combination glipizide GITS/metformin on fibrinolytic and metabolic
      parameters in poorly controlled type 2 diabetic subjects.
PG  - 2123-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Epidemiological studies have implicated increased
      plasminogen-activated inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) as a marker or predictor of accelerated
      coronary atherosclerotic disease in type 2 diabetes. We sought to determine
      whether metabolic control, independent of its oral mode of implementation,
      affects PAI-1 in patients with marked hyperglycemia. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS:
      A total of 91 subjects were screened, subjected to a 4-week drug washout, and
      randomized to daily treatment with glipizide GITS (maximum 20 mg, n = 46) or
      metformin (maximum 2,550 mg, n = 45) as monotherapy. After monotherapy,
      combination therapy was initiated by adding the second agent to the regimen.
      Plasma glucose (fasting and postprandial), HbA(1c), fructosamine, and PAI-1 were 
      assayed before and after randomization and sequentially thereafter in all
      subjects; hepatic glucose output (HGO) and abdominal fat distribution were each
      measured in a subset of subjects. RESULTS: Glycemic control was markedly impaired
      at baseline (mean HbA(1c) 10.4 +/- 0.2% glipizide GITS; 10.0 +/- 0.2% metformin) 
      but improved comparably with each agent as monotherapy and in combination (P <
      0.0001 vs. baseline), as assessed with meal tolerance studies, fructosamine
      values, and HGO. Body weight and abdominal fat distribution did not change
      significantly in either group. PAI-1 concentrations were extraordinarily high (5-
      to 10-fold more than normal) at baseline (202 +/- 12 ng/ml glipizide GITS; 201
      +/- 13 ng/ml metformin) but declined comparably, and significantly, after
      treatment with either agent as monotherapy and decreased further with combination
      therapy. CONCLUSIONS: When hyperglycemia is profound, increases in PAI-1 are also
      profound. Control of hyperglycemia with either glipizide GITS, an insulin
      secretagogue, or metformin as monotherapy comparably ameliorates elevated PAI-1.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of glyburide/metformin tablets (Glucovance)
      versus equivalent doses of glyburide and metformin in patients with type 2
      diabetes.
PG  - 1301-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of two different formulations of glibenclamide 
      (glyburide) combined with metformin on postprandial glucose excursions, and to
      assess their pharmacokinetics. The formulations were a combination
      glibenclamide/metformin tablet (Glucovance; controlled-particle-size
      glibenclamide and metformin) versus glibenclamide (Micronase) and metformin
      (Glucophage) coadministered separately. DESIGN: A randomised, double-blind,
      two-way crossover study in which patients with type 2 diabetes received either
      glibenclamide/metformin 2.5/500mg tablets or glibenclamide 2.5mg with metformin
      500mg twice daily for 14 days. After a 2-week washout, patients were crossed over
      to the other treatment for 14 days. Patients consumed standardised meals on the
      days when pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluations were performed.
      PARTICIPANTS: Forty patients with type 2 diabetes were enrolled; 37 were
      randomised (18 men, 19 women) and 35 completed the study. Mean age was 58 years; 
      mean body mass index was 31 kg/m(2). The baseline glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) 
      was 9.3% for both treatment groups. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Two-hour postprandial
      glucose excursion (PPGE) was used to assess postprandial glucose dynamics.
      RESULTS: Treatment with glibenclamide/metformin resulted in a significantly
      smaller mean PPGE than was attained by treatment with glibenclamide plus
      metformin, according to measurements taken after the day 14 afternoon
      standardised meal (89.5 vs 117.4 mg/dl, p = 0.011). The mean glibenclamide peak
      concentration (C(max)) was significantly greater (approximately 16%) after
      glibenclamide/metformin treatment on both days 1 and 14. Glibenclamide/metformin 
      treatment was associated with a 2-fold greater area under the concentration-time 
      curve to 3 hours for glibenclamide (AUC(3)) [p < 0.001], although the AUC over
      the administration interval was equivalent for both formulations. CONCLUSION: In 
      patients with type 2 diabetes, glibenclamide/metformin resulted in lower PPGE,
      suggesting that the higher glibenclamide AUC(3) observed with this formulation
      may contribute to better postprandial glycaemic control than is attained by
      glibenclamide plus metformin separately.

TI  - Combination-therapy with bedtime nph insulin and sulphonylureas gives similar
      glycaemic control but lower weight gain than insulin twice daily in patients with
      type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 272-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: To study the effect on body weight and glycaemic control of two
      insulin treatment regimens in patients with Type 2 diabetes and moderate failure 
      to oral hypoglycaemic agents. METHODS: Sixteen patients treated with oral
      hypoglycaemic agents (6 men and 10 women) were included in this open-label,
      randomized, parallel group study. Their age was 62 +/- 2 (mean +/- SEM) years
      (range 44-79 years), body weight 71.3 +/- 2.9 kg, body mass index (BMI) 24.6 +/- 
      0.8 kg/m(2). The patients were switched to insulin treatment with bedtime NPH
      insulin combined with daytime sulphonylurea (combination group) or twice daily
      injections of a premixed combination of regular human and NPH insulin (insulin
      twice daily group) with measurements as given below before and after 12 and 24
      weeks of treatment. RESULTS: HbA(1c) was lowered from 8.3 +/- 0.3% to 7.0 +/-
      0.2% in the insulin twice daily group (p<0.05) and from 8.3 +/- 0.3% to 6.8 +/-
      0.5% in the combination group (p<0.03; ns between treatment groups). Body weight 
      increased from 71.7 +/- 4.0 kg to 77.6 +/- 4.4 kg in the insulin twice daily
      group (p<0.001) and from 70.8 +/- 4.6 kg to 72.7 +/- 5.1 kg in the combination
      group (ns; p<0.02 between groups). The dose of insulin at 24 weeks in the insulin
      twice daily group was 45.8 +/- 4.2 U and 29.4 +/- 5.4 U in the combination group 
      (p=0.03). Combination treatment reduced fasting and stimulated C-peptide levels. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Both treatments improved glycaemic control to the same extent but
      the combination of bedtime NPH insulin and daytime sulphonylurea gave a very
      small increase of body weight over a 6 months period. We conclude that
      combination therapy is an attractive alternative when starting insulin treatment 
      in patients with Type 2 diabetes as this is a critical period for weight gain in 
      such patients.

TI  - The contentious nature of gestational diabetes: diet, insulin, glyburide and
      metformin.
PG  - 1557-68
AB  - Gestational diabetes (GD) develops because pregnancy increases requirements for
      insulin secretion while increasing insulin resistance. Women with GD often have
      impaired pancreatic beta-cell compensation for insulin resistance. The nature of 
      GD is currently contentious, with debate about its existence, diagnosis and
      ramifications for both mother and offspring from pregnancy into later life. Also 
      contentious are the outcomes of intervention with diet, insulin, glyburide
      (Glynase trade mark, Pharmacia Upjohn) and metformin (Glucophage trade mark,
      Bristol-Myers Squibb). There is consensus that women with unequivocal GD have a
      significant risk of adverse perinatal outcomes and increased risk of later type 2
      diabetes mellitus. Foetuses from pregnancies with GD have a higher risk of
      macrosomia (associated with higher rate of birth injuries), asphyxia, and
      neonatal hypoglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia. Uncontrolled GD predisposes
      foetuses to accelerated, excessive fat accumulation, insulin resistance,
      pancreatic exhaustion secondary to prenatal hyperglycaemia and possible higher
      risk of child and adult obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus later in adult life.
      However, there is no consensus as to whether glucose intolerance of a severity
      below unequivocal GD is related to adverse maternal, fetal or perinatal outcomes,
      and whether this relationship is a continuous one. If dietary intervention is not
      sufficient in the treatment of GD, then, historically, insulin has been added.
      Recent studies suggest that glyburide may be efficaciously substituted for
      insulin. Preliminary studies suggest that metformin may have the unique potential
      to prevent the development of GD.

TI  - Therapeutic options for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 1009-23; quiz 1024-7
AB  - The incidence of diabetes mellitus is steadily increasing in the United States.
      Currently the United States spends approximately $100 billion in healthcare costs
      annually for the management of diabetes. Most of the costs are attributed to
      hospitalizations and treatment of diabetes complications. Preventing these
      complications with tight glycemic control is the key to reducing morbidity,
      mortality, and healthcare costs secondary to diabetes mellitus. Recently, the
      American College of Endocrinology also stressed earlier screening for diabetes
      and endorsed lowering the goal percent of hemoglobin glycosylation to 6.5%. These
      strategies help identify patients with diabetes at an earlier stage and in turn
      prevent more complications. Better control of diabetes is now feasible with the
      recent approval of 8 new antidiabetic products. Pioglitazone and rosiglitazone
      are agents with a novel mechanism of action. Metformin XR, insulin aspart, and
      miglitol are agents that are similar to previously marketed products, but have
      different pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic properties. Metformin/glyburide is
      the first combination product for the treatment of diabetes. Nateglinide
      represents the first agent in a new class of antidiabetic agents and insulin
      glargine is a novel insulin preparation. All of the agents have unique
      characteristics that may render them useful in specific patient populations.

TI  - Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1: physiologic role, regulation, and the
      influence of common pharmacologic agents.
PG  - 1187-99
AB  - Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is the major inhibitor of endogenous
      thrombolysis, thereby promoting thrombosis. PAI-1 is also a primary contributor
      to the development and recurrence of acute myocardial infarction. The renin
      angiotensin system, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, and
      estrogen all influence the fibrinolytic system and PAI-1 in particular. Available
      data strongly suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and
      hormone replacement therapy with estrogen beneficially reduce PAI-1 production.
      Metformin, an agent commonly used for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
      (NIDDM), appears to favorably decrease PAI-1 production in NIDDM patients but not
      nondiabetic patients. Among the cholesterol-lowering statins, clinical literature
      evaluating pravastatin provides the most compelling data to support this agent's 
      favorable effect on PAI-1. Other available statins either have not displayed an
      effect on PAI-1 or do not have clear data to conclusively define their effects on
      the fibrinolytic system.

TI  - Glyburide/metformin combination product is safe and efficacious in patients with 
      type 2 diabetes failing sulphonylurea therapy.
PG  - 368-75
AB  - AIM: To compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of a fixed combination
      glyburide/metformin preparation with those of glyburide or metformin alone in
      patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by sulphonylurea, diet and 
      exercise. METHODS: In this 16-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel group
      study, 639 patients with inadequate glycaemic control on at least half-maximal
      dose of sulphonylurea were randomly assigned to: glyburide 10 mg b.i.d. (n =
      164); metformin 500 mg (n = 153); glyburide/metformin 2.5 mg/500 mg (n = 160); or
      glyburide/metformin 5 mg/500 mg (n = 162). Titration was allowed to maximum doses
      of 2000 mg for metformin or 10 mg/2000 mg and 20 mg/2000 mg for
      glyburide/metformin 2.5 mg/500 mg and 5 mg/500 mg respectively. The primary
      outcome measure was HbA1c level after 16 weeks; secondary end-points included
      fasting and 2-h post-prandial plasma glucose. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded 
      and summarized by treatment group. RESULTS: Both strengths of glyburide/metformin
      equally reduced mean HbA1c by 1.7% more than did glyburide alone (p < 0.001), and
      by 1.9% more than did metformin alone (p < 0.001). Final mean fasting plasma
      glucose concentrations were also lower in both glyburide/metformin groups than in
      the glyburide (-2.8 mmol/l, -51.3 mg/dl; p < 0.001) and metformin groups (-3.6
      mmol/l, -64.2 mg/dl; p < 0.001). Safety and tolerability were similar across all 
      treatment groups, except for a higher incidence of gastrointestinal AEs in the
      metformin monotherapy group, and more patients reporting mild or moderate
      symptoms of hypoglycaemia while taking glyburide/metformin. CONCLUSIONS: Both
      glyburide/metformin tablet strengths produced, with equal efficacy, significantly
      better glycaemic control than monotherapy with either agent. These data also
      confirm that glycaemic efficacy does not require maximal sulphonylurea doses in
      combination with metformin.

TI  - A comparison of the effects of rosiglitazone and glyburide on cardiovascular
      function and glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 2058-64
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This open-label, active-controlled study investigated the cardiac
      safety and antihyperglycemic effect of rosiglitazone (RSG) in patients with type 
      2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Of the 203 patients randomly assigned to
      RSG (4 mg b.i.d.) or glyburide (GLB) (titrated to achieve optimal glycemic
      control for the first 8 weeks only to limit the risk of hypoglycemia; mean 10.5
      mg/day), 118 had an echocardiogram performed at week 52. Left ventricular (LV)
      mass index, ejection fraction, and left ventricular end-diastolic volume were
      assessed by M-mode echocardiography at baseline and weeks 12, 28, and 52; 24-h
      ambulatory blood pressure was assessed at baseline and at weeks 28 and 52.
      Glycemic control was assessed by measuring fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and
      HbA(1c). RESULTS: Neither treatment produced an increase in LV mass index that
      exceeded 1 SD. Ejection fraction did not change in either group. Both groups had 
      clinically insignificant increases in LV end-diastolic volume. RSG, but not GLB, 
      caused a statistically significant reduction in ambulatory diastolic blood
      pressure. Both treatments reduced HbA(1c) and FPG. CONCLUSIONS: A total of 52
      weeks of therapy with RSG (4 mg b.i.d.) did not adversely affect cardiac
      structure or function in patients with type 2 diabetes and produced significant
      and sustained reductions in hyperglycemia. Decreases in ambulatory diastolic
      blood pressure with RSG were superior to those with GLB.

TI  - Troglitazone: the discovery and development of a novel therapy for the treatment 
      of Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 1173-97
AB  - Prior to the introduction of troglitazone, it had been more than 30 years since
      the last significant improvement in antidiabetic therapy. In view of the pressing
      need for more effective oral agents for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes
      mellitus, troglitazone was granted priority review by the FDA and was launched in
      the USA in 1997. The first of the thiazolidinedione insulin sensitizing agents,
      troglitazone was quickly followed by rosiglitazone and pioglitazone. The
      glitazones proved to be effective not only in lowering blood glucose, but also to
      have beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk. Troglitazone was subsequently
      withdrawn because of concerns about hepatotoxicity, which appears to be less of a
      problem with rosiglitazone and pioglitazone. Recent insights into the molecular
      mechanism of action of the glitazones, which are ligands for the peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptors, open the prospect of designing more effective, 
      selective and safer antidiabetic agents. This document will review the history of
      troglitazone from discovery through clinical development.

TI  - Oral antihyperglycemic agents during pregnancy and lactation: a review.
PG  - 755-60
AB  - The treatment approach of diabetes mellitus during pregnancy requires a
      combination of diet, exercise, multiple home glucose determinations and intensive
      insulin regimens. During the last decade there was an increased interest in the
      use of oral antihyperglycemic agents (OAHAs) as an alternative to insulin in
      achieving good glycemic control. OAHAs are divided into four groups: derivatives 
      of sulfonylurea, biguanides, glucosidase inhibitors and thiazolidinediones. This 
      review describes the possible teratogenic effects of the use of OAHAs during
      pregnancy and the effects of these drugs during lactation. Animal and human
      studies assessing the teratogenic effects of OAHAs have yielded conflicting data 
      because the risk of major malformations in infants of mothers with diabetes
      appears to be related to maternal glycemic control rather than the antidiabetic
      therapy. A major concern with the use of OAHAs during pregnancy is neonatal
      hypoglycemia, which may be severe and persist for days. Therefore, insulin is
      still the drug of choice because it has not been implicated as a teratogen in
      human pregnancies. In addition, because of the lack of data regarding the use of 
      OAHAs in pregnancy, we cannot draw firm conclusions about all of the available
      drugs. However, OAHAs, especially glibenclamide (glyburide), may be beneficial in
      a situation where the proper use of insulin is problematic. Because there are
      very limited clinical data on the exposure of OAHAs to the infant via breast
      milk, and the potentially serious effect of neonatal hypoglycemia, the safest
      recommendation is not to breast feed while taking OAHAs. Well-conducted,
      prospective, controlled studies regarding the feasibility of OAHAs in pregnant
      women with diabetes and during lactation are needed.

TI  - A retrospective cohort analysis of the clinical effectiveness of a
      physician-pharmacist collaborative drug therapy management diabetes clinic.
PG  - 1294-300
AB  - The glycemic control of patients with diabetes in a physician-supervised,
      pharmacist-managed primary care clinic was compared with that of patients
      receiving standard care in the same health care system. We retrospectively
      analyzed the glycemic control of 87 men with type 1 or type 2 diabetes whose
      diabetes-related drug therapy was managed by clinical pharmacists compared with a
      control group of 85 similar patients whose care was not augmented by clinical
      pharmacists. Primary outcomes were differences in fasting blood glucose (FBG) and
      glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) levels between groups. Secondary outcomes were
      relative risk (RR) for achieving an A1C of 7% or below, frequency of
      diabetes-related scheduled and unscheduled clinic visits, and frequency of
      hypoglycemic events. The study group had 864 clinic visits and the control group 
      had 712 between October 1997 and June 2000. No statistical differences were noted
      in FBG or A1C between groups. The RR of achieving an A1C of 7% or below was
      significantly higher in the study cohort (RR 5.19, 95% confidence interval [CI]
      2.62-10.26). The frequency of hypoglycemic events did not differ between groups. 
      The mean +/- SD frequency of unscheduled diabetes-related clinic
      visits/patient/year was higher in the control group (1.33 +/- 3.74) than in the
      study group (0.11 +/- 0.46, p = 0.003). Pharmacist-managed diabetes care was
      effective in improving glycemic control and was not associated with an increased 
      risk for hypoglycemic events or unscheduled diabetes-related clinic visits.

TI  - Quality of care in diabetes: understanding the guidelines.
PG  - 196-206
AB  - We are in the midst of a global pandemic of diabetes. Despite the increasing
      burden of the disease, measurements of quality repeatedly show poor adherence to 
      or implementation of current guidelines for diabetes care. This article will
      provide a brief review of the most significant randomized controlled clinical
      trials relevant to the current guidelines and then discuss essential treatment
      goals and the evidence that supports them. Several practical clinical questions
      related to the implementation of modern diabetes guidelines will be raised and
      answered. Finally, reasons for the poor quality performance observed will be
      examined.

TI  - Lipid effects of glyburide/metformin tablets in patients with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus with poor glycemic control and dyslipidemia in an open-label extension
      study.
PG  - 1426-38
AB  - BACKGROUND: Because both type 2 diabetes and elevated plasma lipid levels are
      important independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease and coronary heart 
      disease, the choice of an antihyperglycemic agent for patients with type 2
      diabetes--in whom abnormal plasma lipid levels are often seen-should take into
      account effects on lipids as well as on markers of glycemic control. OBJECTIVE:
      This study assessed the effects on lipid levels of glyburide/metformin tablets in
      the treatment of type 2 diabetes, particularly in a group of patients who had
      poor glycemic control and dyslipidemia at baseline. METHODS: This 52-week,
      open-label study was an extension of a 32-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
      study. The patient population was drawn from 3 groups: those who completed the
      double-blind study, those who were discontinued from the double-blind study, and 
      those who were ineligible for the double-blind study based on predefined measures
      of glycemic control (screening fasting plasma glucose > 240 mg/dL and
      glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA1c] < or = 12%, or HbA1c 11%-12%) and were directly
      enrolled in the open-label extension study. Patients with an HbA1c of < 9%
      received glyburide/ metformin tablets 1.25 mg/250 mg BID; those with an HbA1c >
      or = 9% received glyburide/ metformin tablets 2.5 mg/500 mg BID. Changes in total
      cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglyceride (TG) levels were assessed for
      52 weeks. RESULTS: The study population included 828 patients: 515 who completed 
      the double-blind study, 138 who were discontinued from the double-blind study,
      and 175 who were enrolled directly. Direct enrollees had poor glycemic control
      and dyslipidemia at baseline. Improvements in plasma lipid levels were seen as
      early as week 13. At week 52, the mean change in TC from baseline was -8.0 mg/dL 
      for the total population (95% CI, -10.9 to -5.2; P < 0.05) and -23.2 mg/dL for
      direct enrollees (95% CI, -30.1 to -16.4; P < 0.05). The mean decrease in LDL-C
      from baseline for the total population was 2.86 mg/dL (95% CI, -5.3 to -0.4; P < 
      0.05), compared with a reduction of 13.3 mg/dL for direct enrollees (95% CI,
      -18.5 to -8.1; P < 0.05). Mean HDL-C levels were minimally affected. Mean TG
      levels decreased by 27.8 mg/dL for the entire population (95% CI, -42.9 to -12.8;
      P < 0.05) and by 99.7 mg/dL for direct enrollees (95% CI, -152.5 to -46.8; P <
      0.05). CONCLUSION: In this open-label extension study, treatment with glyburide/ 
      metformin tablets for type 2 diabetes had a durable, favorable effect on lipid
      levels, particularly in those with poor glycemic control and dyslipidemia at
      baseline.

TI  - Durability of efficacy and long-term safety profile of glyburide/metformin
      tablets in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: an open-label extension study.
PG  - 1401-13
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intensive glycemic control substantially reduces the microvascular
      and macrovascular complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus, although less than
      half of patients with diabetes achieve the target glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c)
      value recommended by the American Diabetes Association. Because monotherapy with 
      an oral agent does not address the multiple pathophysiologic defects of diabetes,
      use of combination therapy appears to be warranted. A previous 32-week,
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial found that treatment with
      glyburide/metformin tablets was associated with greater reductions in HbA1c
      values compared with glyburide monotherapy, metformin monotherapy, and placebo.
      OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the durability of efficacy and long-term safety 
      profile of therapy with glyburide/metformin tablets over 52 weeks. METHODS:
      Patients enrolled in this open-label extension study were drawn from 3 groups:
      those who completed the 32-week double-blind study, those who were discontinued
      from the double-blind study, and those who were ineligible for the double-blind
      study and were enrolled directly in the open-label extension study. Patients with
      an HbA1c of < 9% received glyburide/metformin 1.25 mg/250 mg tablets BID, and
      those with an HbA1c of > or = 9% received glyburide/metformin 2.5 mg/500 mg
      tablets BID. Primary efficacy variables included changes from baseline in HbA1c, 
      fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and body weight at week 52. Safety was assessed
      based on adverse-event data and the results of physical examinations and
      laboratory tests. RESULTS: A total of 828 patients were enrolled in the study:
      515 who completed the 32-week double-blind study, 138 who were discontinued from 
      the double-blind study, and 175 who were directly enrolled. At week 52, the mean 
      HbA1c value for the entire population had decreased from a baseline value of
      8.73% to 7.04% (95% CI, -1.81 to -1.58). Patients who were enrolled directly had 
      the poorest glycemic control at baseline and experienced the greatest reduction
      in HbA1c (-3.35%; 95% CI, -3.61 to -3.10). A reduction in mean FPG for the total 
      population was observed as early as week 2, from 201 to 141 mg/dL (95% CI, -63.0 
      to -55.7). Symptoms of hypoglycemia occurred in 19.9% (165/828) of patients,
      although only one third of these patients had a documented finger-stick blood
      glucose value of > or = 50 mg/dL. CONCLUSIONS: In this 52-week, open-label
      extension study, glyburide/metformin tablets were well tolerated and effective in
      patients with type 2 diabetes. They provided rapid and sustainable reductions in 
      HbA1c values and FPG concentrations.

TI  - Discontinuation of metformin in type 2 diabetes patients treated with insulin.
PG  - 249-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: Metformin added to insulin therapy in type 2 diabetic patients
      improves glycaemic control and decreases the required daily dose of insulin
      (DDI). Metformin should be discontinued if cardiac, hepatic or renal failure
      develops. We examined whether glycaemic control can be maintained after metformin
      cessation. METHODS: We included 45 type 2 diabetic patients treated with insulin 
      plus metformin, and 45 matched controls treated with insulin only. After
      discontinuation of metformin in the first group, we aimed for tight fasting and
      postprandial blood glucose levels, 4-7 and 4-10 mmol/l, respectively, in both
      groups. During 12 weeks we assessed glycaemic control every two weeks and, if
      necessary, adjusted the insulin dosage. RESULTS: In the group in which metformin 
      was discontinued, DDI increased from 67.9 +/- 22.9 to 92.2 +/- 29.4 IU (p <
      0.001) leaving glycaemic control unchanged. In the controls, glycated haemoglobin
      (GHb) decreased by 0.93% (p < 0.001), while DDI increased slightly from 62.4 +/- 
      22.9 to 72.3 +/- 27.3 IU (p < 0.001). The increase in DDI was larger in patients 
      in whom metformin was discontinued than in the controls (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS:
      In type 2 diabetic patients treated with insulin plus metformin, glycaemic
      control can be maintained after discontinuation of metformin by increasing the
      DDI substantially (20 to 36%) during application of an intensified treatment
      protocol.

TI  - Factors associated with switching from oral hypoglycaemic agents to insulin
      therapy.
PG  - 243-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of our study was to determine which factors are associated
      with switching from oral hypoglycaemic agents to insulin therapy in patients with
      type 2 diabetes mellitus in general practice. METHODS: Longitudinal,
      observational study in a Dutch general healthcare centre. All pharmacologically
      treated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were included (n = 152).
      Comorbidity, laboratory results and medication use were obtained from the general
      practitioners' files. RESULTS: A total of 31 (20.4%) patients switched from oral 
      hypoglycaemic agents to insulin therapy; they were significantly younger at the
      onset of diabetes, 50.5 versus 57.7 years. Fasting blood glucose levels and
      HbA(1c) values were significantly higher after the switch compared with patients 
      on oral treatment, 10.0 mmol/l versus 8.4 mmol/l and 8.8% versus 7.9%,
      respectively. Concerning comorbidity, they suffered more frequently from acute
      myocardial infarction, lipid disorders, depression, retinopathy and atrial
      fibrillation. Cardiovascular disease in general was more often present in
      patients who switched over to insulin, 77.4% versus 52.9% (OR 3.1; CI 1.2-7.6).
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients who switch over to insulin therapy are younger at
      diagnosis, suffer from more health problems besides diabetes, especially
      cardiovascular disease, and have worse metabolic control, compared with users of 
      oral hypoglycaemic agents.

TI  - A diabetes outcome progression trial (ADOPT): an international multicenter study 
      of the comparative efficacy of rosiglitazone, glyburide, and metformin in
      recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 1737-43
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Therapies with metformin, sulfonylureas, or insulin improve glycemic
      control in the short term but do not prevent progressive islet beta-cell failure 
      or long-term deterioration in glycemia. Our goal was to evaluate, in patients
      recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (<3 years), the long-term efficacy of
      monotherapy with rosiglitazone on glycemic control and on the progression of
      pathophysiological abnormalities associated with type 2 diabetes as compared with
      metformin or glyburide monotherapy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A Diabetes
      Outcome Progression Trial (ADOPT) is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group
      study consisting of a screening visit, a 4-week placebo run-in, a 4-year
      treatment period, and an observational follow-up of approximately 3,600
      drug-naive patients with type 2 diabetes diagnosed within the previous 3 years.
      After run-in, patients will be randomized to rosiglitazone, glyburide, or
      metformin titrated to the maximum effective daily doses (8 mg rosiglitazone, 15
      mg glyburide, or 2 g metformin). The primary outcome is time to monotherapy
      failure, defined as the time following titration to the maximal effective or
      tolerated dose when fasting plasma glucose exceeds 180 mg/dl (10 mmol/l).
      Secondary outcomes include measures of islet beta-cell function, insulin
      sensitivity, dyslipidemia, changes in urinary albumin excretion, plasminogen
      activator inhibitor-1 antigen, fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein. Safety and
      tolerability will also be evaluated. Patient-reported outcomes and resource
      utilization data will be collected and analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: ADOPT will provide 
      data on the effect of mechanistically differing treatment options on metabolic
      control, beta-cell function, and markers of macrovascular disease risk in type 2 
      diabetes.

TI  - Repaglinide versus metformin in combination with bedtime NPH insulin in patients 
      with type 2 diabetes established on insulin/metformin combination therapy.
PG  - 1685-90
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect on glycemic control and weight gain of
      repaglinide versus metformin combined with bedtime NPH insulin in patients with
      type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 80 subjects treated with
      850 or 1,000 mg t.i.d. metformin combined with bedtime NPH insulin were
      randomized to 13 weeks of open-label treatment with 4 mg t.i.d. repaglinide (n = 
      39) or metformin (dose unchanged) (n = 41). Insulin dose was titrated at the
      clinician's discretion, aiming for a fasting blood glucose (FBG) < or =6.0
      mmol/l. RESULTS: Baseline age, diabetes duration, insulin requirement, weight,
      BMI, FBG, and HbA(1c) (Diabetes Control and Complications Trial-aligned assay,
      normal range 4.6-6.2%) were similar. Glycemic control improved (nonsignificantly)
      with insulin/metformin by (mean) 0.4%, from 8.4 to 8.1% (P = 0.09) but
      deteriorated with insulin/repaglinide by (mean) 0.4%, from 8.1 to 8.6% (P = 0.03;
      P = 0.005 between groups). Weight gain was less with insulin/metformin: 0.9 +/-
      0.4 kg (means +/- SE) (P = 0.01) versus 2.7 +/- 0.4 kg (P < 0.0001) (P = 0.002
      between groups). The Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire score
      (potential range 0 [minimum] to 36 [maximum]) increased from 32.4 +/- 0.8 to 34.1
      +/- 0.5 (P = 0.01) with insulin/metformin but decreased from 32.5 +/- 0.9 to 29.1
      +/- 1.3 (P < 0.002) with insulin/repaglinide. CONCLUSIONS: Combined with bedtime 
      NPH insulin, metformin provides superior glycemic control to repaglinide with
      less weight gain and improved diabetes treatment satisfaction.

TI  - Tablet-breaking ability of older persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 530-40
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the ability of older persons
      with type 2 diabetes to accurately break in half 2 different formulations of
      micronized glyburide tablets. METHODS: Thirty persons with type 2 diabetes, over 
      age 70, were recruited from the St Louis University geriatric clinics.
      Participants were randomly assigned to 2 groups. Group A broke 30 Glynase
      Prestabs and 30 generic tablets using 2 different manual tablet-breaking methods.
      Group B broke 15 Glynase Prestabs and 15 generic tablets without instructions.
      Visual analog scales were used to assess pain and difficulty of tablet breaking. 
      RESULTS: A higher percentage of successful tablet breaking was reported with
      Glynase Prestabs (80%) compared with the generic tablets (33%). Mean pain scores 
      for breaking Glynase Prestabs were 0.1 (Group A) and 0.9 (Group B). Higher pain
      scores were obtained for the generic tablets (2.1 for Group A, 3.2 for Group B). 
      Glynase Prestabs were easier to break in both groups, and the resultant half
      tablets showed less variance from the expected theoretical weight (50% of whole
      parent tablet weight). CONCLUSIONS: Older adults broke Glynase Prestabs more
      accurately and with less difficulty than generic micronized glyburide tablets.
      This variation in ease of tablet breaking and accuracy between different tablet
      formulations affect bioavailability and patient compliance.

TI  - Gliclazide improves anti-oxidant status and nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation in
      Type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 752-7
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the effects of gliclazide on oxidative status and vascular
      response to systemic administration of L-arginine, the natural precursor of
      nitric oxide (NO), in Type 2 diabetic patients. METHODS: Thirty Type 2 diabetic
      patients received glibenclamide (n = 15) or gliclazide (n = 15) in a 12-week,
      randomized, observer-blinded, parallel study. Plasma lipid peroxides, total
      radical-trapping anti-oxidant parameter (TRAP), and blood pressure responses to
      an intravenous bolus of L-arginine were measured pre- and post-treatment.
      RESULTS: At 12 weeks, gliclazide patients had lower plasma lipid peroxides (13.3 
      +/- 3.8 micro mol/l vs. 19.2 +/- 4.3 micro mol/l; P = 0.0001) and higher plasma
      TRAP (1155.6 +/- 143.0 micro mol/l vs. 957.7 +/- 104.3 micro mol/l; P = 0.0001)
      than the glibenclamide patients. Gliclazide but not glibenclamide significantly
      reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.0199 and P = 0.00199,
      respectively, two-way repeated measures analysis of variance) in response to
      intravenous L-arginine. CONCLUSIONS: Gliclazide reduces oxidative stress in Type 
      2 diabetic patients by improving plasma anti-oxidant status. This effect is
      associated with enhanced NO-mediated vasodilation.

TI  - Glimepiride improves both first and second phases of insulin secretion in type 2 
      diabetes.
PG  - 1607-11
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of glimepiride on
      insulin sensitivity and secretion in subjects with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH
      DESIGN AND METHODS: After a 2-week washout from prior sulfonylurea therapy, 11
      obese subjects with type 2 diabetes underwent euglycemic and hyperglycemic clamp 
      studies before and during glimepiride therapy. RESULTS: Glimepiride resulted in a
      2.4-mmol/l decrease in fasting plasma glucose (P = 0.04) that was correlated with
      reductions in postabsorptive endogenous glucose production (EGP) (16.4 +/- 0.6
      vs. 13.5 +/- 0.5 micro mol. kg(-1). min(-1), P = 0.01) (r = 0.21, P = 0.01).
      Postabsorptive EGP on glimepiride was similar to that of control subjects (12.8
      +/- 0.9 micro mol. kg(-1). min(-1), NS). Fasting plasma insulin (66 +/- 18 vs. 84
      +/- 48 pmol/l, P = 0.05), and first-phase (19 +/- 8 vs. 32 +/- 11 pmol/l, P =
      0.04) and second-phase incremental insulin responses to glucose (48 +/- 23 vs. 72
      +/- 32 pmol/l, P = 0.02) improved with glimepiride therapy. Insulin sensitivity
      did not change with treatment (4.6 +/- 0.7 vs. 4.3 +/- 0.7 micro mol. kg(-1).
      min(-1). pmol(-1)) and remained below that of control subjects (8.1 +/- 1.8 micro
      mol. kg(-1). min(-1). pmol(-1), P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The current study
      demonstrates that glimepiride improves both first and second phases of insulin
      secretion, but not insulin sensitivity, in individuals with type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Combination therapy with nateglinide and a thiazolidinedione improves glycemic
      control in type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 1529-33
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of monotherapy using nateglinide and the
      thiazolidinedione troglitazone with initial combination of the two agents on
      glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately
      controlled by diet alone. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study consisted of a 
      28-week, double-blind, randomized, multicenter study that included a 4-week,
      single-blind, placebo, run-in period and a 24-week (shortened to 16 weeks),
      double-blind, active treatment period. RESULTS: At the 16-week end point,
      nateglinide 120 mg, troglitazone 600 mg, and the combination of the agents
      achieved statistically significant decreases in HbA(1c) in comparison with
      placebo and a baseline HbA(1c) of 8.1-8.4% (P < 0.001). The reductions in HbA(1c)
      were similar in the nateglinide (0.6%) and troglitazone (0.8%) monotherapy
      groups. The reduction in HbA(1c) (1.7%) was greatest in the combination group;
      79% of patients in the combination group achieved HbA(1c) levels of <7%. The
      combination group had a higher number of adverse events, primarily due to an
      increased incidence of mild hypoglycemia in this treatment group. CONCLUSIONS:
      Nateglinide and troglitazone are equally effective in decreasing HbA(1c) levels. 
      However, these reductions from baseline HbA(1c) values of >8% are not adequate to
      achieve HbA(1c) levels of <7%. In contrast, the combination of nateglinide and of
      a thiazolidinedione shows an additive effect that is highly effective in reducing
      HbA(1c) levels to the target of <7% in 66% of patients, from a baseline HbA(1c)
      that is just above 8%.

TI  - Rosiglitazone: a review of its use in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 1805-37
AB  - Rosiglitazone, a thiazolidinedione with a different side chain from those of
      troglitazone and pioglitazone, reduces plasma glucose levels and glucose
      production and increases glucose clearance in patients with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus. Insulin sensitivity, pancreatic beta-cell function and surrogate
      markers of cardiovascular risk factors are significantly improved by
      rosiglitazone. Double-blind trials of 8 to 26 weeks of rosiglitazone 4 or 8
      mg/day monotherapy indicate significant decreases in fasting plasma glucose (-2
      to -3 mmol/L with 8 mg/day) and glycosylated haemoglobin levels [HbA(1c); -0.6 to
      -0.7% (-0.8 to -1.1% in drug-naive patients) with 8 mg/day]. Significant
      decreases in hyperglycaemic markers occurred when rosiglitazone was combined with
      metformin (HbA(1c) -0.8 to -1.0%), a sulphonylurea (-1.4%) or insulin (-1.2%) for
      26 weeks versus little change with active comparator monotherapy. Efficacy was
      maintained in trials of < or = 2 years, and was also apparent in various ethnic
      subgroups, elderly patients, and both obese and nonobese patients. Rosiglitazone 
      is currently not indicated in combination with injected insulin. It should be
      administered in conjunction with diet and exercise regimens. Rosiglitazone is
      generally well tolerated. Despite rare individual reports of liver function
      abnormalities in rosiglitazone recipients, the incidence of these in clinical
      trials (< or = 2 years' duration) was similar to that in placebo and active
      comparator groups. Fluid retention associated with rosiglitazone may be the cause
      of the increased incidence of anaemia in clinical trials, and also means that
      patients should be monitored for signs of heart failure during therapy. Although 
      bodyweight is increased overall with rosiglitazone therapy, increases are in
      subcutaneous, not visceral, fat; hepatic fat is decreased. The pharmacokinetic
      profile of rosiglitazone is not substantially altered by age or renal impairment,
      nor are there important drug interactions. Rosiglitazone is not indicated in
      patients with active liver disease or increased liver enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: Oral 
      rosiglitazone 4 or 8 mg/day provides significant antihyperglycaemic efficacy and 
      is generally well tolerated, both as monotherapy and in combination with other
      antihyperglycaemic agents, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who do not
      have active liver disease. Long-term data are required before conclusions can be 
      drawn about the clinical significance of positive changes to surrogate markers of
      cardiovascular disease risk and improvements to pancreatic beta-cell function.
      Rosiglitazone significantly improves insulin sensitivity and, as such, is a
      welcome addition to the treatment options for patients with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus.

TI  - Improved glycaemic control with metformin-glibenclamide combined tablet therapy
      (Glucovance) in Type 2 diabetic patients inadequately controlled on metformin.
PG  - 673-80
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of two dosage strengths of a
      single-tablet metformin-glibenclamide (glyburide) combination, compared with the 
      respective monotherapies, in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM)
      inadequately controlled by metformin monotherapy. METHODS: In this 16-week,
      double-blind, multicentre, parallel-group trial, 411 patients were randomized to 
      receive metformin 500 mg, glibenclamide 5 mg, metformin-glibenclamide 500 mg/2.5 
      mg or metformin-glibenclamide 500 mg/5 mg, titrated with the intention to achieve
      fasting plasma glucose (FPG) < or = 7 mmol/l. RESULTS: Decreases in glycated
      haemoglobin (HbA1c) and FPG were greater (P < 0.05) for metformin-glibenclamide
      500 mg/2.5 mg (-1.20% and -2.62 mmol/l) and 500 mg/5 mg (-0.91% and -2.34
      mmol/l), compared with metformin (-0.19% and -0.57 mmol/l) or glibenclamide
      (-0.33% and -0.73 mmol/l). HbA1c < 7% was achieved by 75% and 64% of patients
      receiving metformin-glibenclamide 500 mg/2.5 mg and 500 mg/5 mg, respectively,
      compared with 42% for glibenclamide and 38% for metformin (P = 0.001). These
      benefits were achieved at lower mean doses of metformin or glibenclamide with
      metformin-glibenclamide 500 mg/2.5 mg and 500 mg/5 mg (1225 mg/6.1 mg and 1170
      mg/11.7 mg) than with glibenclamide (13.4 mg) or metformin (1660 mg).
      Treatment-related serious adverse events occurred in two patients receiving
      glibenclamide. Plasma lipid profiles were unaffected and mean changes in body
      weight were < or = 1.0 kg. CONCLUSIONS: Intensive management of Type 2 DM with a 
      new metformin-glibenclamide combination tablet improved glycaemic control and
      facilitated the attainment of glycaemic targets at lower doses of metformin or
      glibenclamide compared with the respective monotherapies, without compromising
      tolerability.

TI  - Oral hypoglycaemics. When not to use what.
PG  - 637-43
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the 1940s and '50s the first oral hypoglycaemic agents (the
      sulphonylureas and metformin) became available. These remained the only agents
      for the next 50 years. Over the last five years three new classes have been
      released. General practitioners now have a wider range of effective hypoglycaemic
      agents from which to choose. OBJECTIVES: This article focuses on those patients
      where particular agents should not be used: i.e. 'when not to use what'.
      DISCUSSION: In general however, it must be remembered that problems with oral
      hypoglycaemics are rare. The great majority of patients have no problems with
      their prescribed hypoglycaemic medication.

TI  - Bioequivalence evaluation of two brands of gliclazide 80 mg tablets (Glyzide &
      Diamicron)--in healthy human volunteers.
PG  - 197-202
AB  - A randomized, two-way, crossover, bioequivalence study in 24 fasting, healthy,
      male volunteers was conducted to compare two brands of gliclazide 80 mg tablets, 
      Glyzide (Julphar, UAE) as test and Diamicron (Servier Industries, France) as
      reference product. The study was performed at the International Pharmaceutical
      Research Centre (IPRC), in joint venture with Speciality Hospital, Amman, Jordan.
      The drug was administered with 240 ml of 20% glucose solution after a 10 h
      overnight fasting. After dosing, serial blood samples were collected for a period
      of 48 h. Plasma harvested from blood was analyzed for gliclazide by validated
      HPLC method. Various pharmacokinetic parameters including AUC(0-t), AUC(0-
      proportional, variant), C(max), T(max), T(1/2), and elimination rate constant
      were determined from plasma concentrations of both formulations. Statistical
      modules (ANOVA and 90% confidence intervals) were applied to AUC(0-t), AUC(0-
      proportional, variant), and C(max) for bioequivalence evaluation of the two
      brands which revealed no significant difference between them, and 90% CI fell
      within US FDA accepted bioequivalence range of 80-125%. Based on these
      statistical inferences, Glyzide was judged bioequivalent to Diamicron.

TI  - Changes in treatment after the start of oral hypoglycaemic therapy in Type 2
      diabetes: a population-based study.
PG  - 606-10
AB  - AIMS: To determine the changes in oral hypoglycaemic therapy and the time to
      incidence of insulin therapy in people with Type 2 diabetes. METHODS: A
      retrospective incidence cohort was constructed of 1305 subjects with Type 2
      diabetes, who obtained a first prescription for oral hypoglycaemic medication
      between 1 July 1993 and 31 December 1994 in Tayside, Scotland. The primary
      endpoint of changes in oral hypoglycaemic therapy and time to insulin was
      determined up to the end of the follow-up, on 31 December 1995. RESULTS: Overall,
      9.4% of subjects switched to insulin, while 11% of those initially on
      sulphonylurea, and 6% of those initially on metformin switched to insulin
      therapy. Approximately three-quarters (72%) remained on the same class of drug
      throughout the study period (median follow-up 588 days). Only 9% died during the 
      follow-up and this did not differ appreciably by drug group. Males were more
      likely to switch to insulin compared with females (10.3% vs. 8.5%), and those who
      switched were slightly younger with a mean age of 58 years compared with a mean
      age of 60 years of those who did not switch. The median time of switching to
      insulin was 186 days or approximately 6 months for this cohort, giving a rate of 
      switching to insulin of 5.84% per year. Poorer glycaemic control (HBA1c) and low 
      body mass index (BMI) were associated with switching to insulin. CONCLUSIONS:
      Following initial therapy with oral hypoglycaemic medication in the population,
      switching to insulin occurred at a rate of 5.84% per year. Switching to insulin
      was associated with being younger, male, having low BMI and higher HbA1c.

TI  - Oral hypoglycemic agents and the pregnant diabetic: "from bench to bedside".
PG  - 215-24
AB  - Today, the criteria for diagnosis and treatment have evolved into an
      evidence-based medicine approach. The need for evidence-based information is
      especially critical in the management of gestational diabetes, in general, and
      especially in the use of oral hypoglycemic agents. These agents have been
      categorically contraindicated for decades in the United States based on anecdotal
      and/or weak evidence for these recommendations. In this article, the similarities
      between gestational and type 2 diabetes are described and the rationale for the
      use of oral hypoglycemic agents for the treatment of both are discussed. The
      author will show how research from basic sciences (placental transfers) to
      clinical studies (perinatal outcome) can lead to significant evidence on which to
      base management recommendations.

TI  - Desensitization of insulin secretion.
PG  - 1921-35
AB  - Desensitization of insulin secretion describes a reversible state of decreased
      secretory responsiveness of the pancreatic beta-cell, induced by a prolonged
      exposure to a multitude of stimuli. These include the main physiological
      stimulator, glucose, but also other nutrients like free fatty acids and
      practically all pharmacological stimulators acting by depolarization and Ca2+
      influx into the beta-cell. Desensitization of insulin secretion appears to be an 
      important step in the manifestation of type 2 diabetes and in the secondary
      failure of oral antidiabetic treatment. In this commentary, the basic concepts
      and the controversial issues in the field will be outlined. With regard to
      glucose-induced desensitization, two fundamentally opposing concepts have
      emerged. The first is that desensitization is the consequence of functional
      changes in the beta-cell that impair glucose-recognition. The second is that
      long-term increased secretory activity leads to a depletion of releasable
      insulin, often in spite of increased insulin synthesis. The latter concept is
      more appropriately termed beta-cell exhaustion. The same dichotomy applies to the
      desensitization evoked by pharmacological stimuli: again the relative
      contributions of a decreased insulin content versus alterations in signal
      transduction are in dispute. The action of tolbutamide on beta-cells may be an
      example of desensitization caused by a lack of releasable insulin since the
      signaling mechanisms are nearly unchanged, whereas the action of phentolamine, an
      imidazoline, induces a strong desensitization without reducing insulin content or
      secretory granules, apparently by abolishing Ca2+ influx. With pharmacological
      agents it seems that both, alterations in signal transduction and decreased
      availability of releasable insulin, can contribute to the desensitized state of
      the beta-cell, the relative contribution being variable depending upon the exact 
      nature of the secretory stimulus.

TI  - Orlistat use in type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 1210-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the use of orlistat in type 2 diabetes. DATA SOURCES: A
      MEDLINE search of the English-language literature (1990-August 2001) was
      performed using the key terms orlistat, obesity, glucose, and diabetes. DATA
      EXTRACTION: All articles pertaining to orlistat were considered for inclusion,
      with emphasis placed on randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical
      trials. DATA SYNTHESIS: In April 1999, orlistat was approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration for the treatment of obesity. Of 13 randomized, placebo-controlled
      studies, only 2 reported specific data in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Both 
      reported significant weight reduction and improved glycemic control over placebo.
      CONCLUSIONS: Since weight loss is a difficult goal to achieve in patients with
      type 2 diabetes, orlistat can be a safe, effective addition to a
      multidisciplinary approach.

TI  - Clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of repaglinide.
PG  - 471-83
AB  - Repaglinide is a novel, fast-acting prandial oral hypoglycaemic agent developed
      for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes whose disease cannot be
      controlled by diet and exercise alone. Although repaglinide binds to the
      sulphonylurea binding sites on pancreatic beta-cells and has a similar mechanism 
      of action, repaglinide exhibits distinct pharmacological properties compared with
      these agents. Following administration, repaglinide is absorbed rapidly and has a
      fast onset of dose-dependent blood-glucose lowering effect. The drug is
      eliminated rapidly via the biliary route, without accumulation in the plasma
      after multiple doses. Repaglinide is well tolerated in patients with type 2
      diabetes, including elderly patients and patients with hepatic or renal
      impairment. The pharmacokinetic profile of repaglinide and the improvements in
      post-prandial hyperglycaemia and overall glycaemic control make repaglinide
      suitable for administration preprandially, with the opportunity for flexible meal
      arrangements, including skipped meals, without the risk of hypoglycaemia.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of pioglitazone in type 2 diabetes: a randomised,
      placebo-controlled study in patients receiving stable insulin therapy.
PG  - 251-7
AB  - The glycaemic and lipid effects of treatment with pioglitazone in combination
      with a stable insulin regimen were evaluated in patients with type 2 diabetes.
      Patients (n=566) receiving stable insulin regimens for > or = 30 days yet who had
      HbA1c > or = 8.0% and C-peptide > 0.7 microg/l were randomised to receive
      once-daily 15 mg pioglitazone, 30 mg pioglitazone, or placebo in a 16-week
      multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Per study protocol, the
      insulin dose was to remain unchanged, but could be decreased in response to
      hypoglycaemia. At the end of double-blind treatment, patients receiving
      pioglitazone (15 mg or 30 mg) showed statistically significant mean decreases
      relative to baseline HbA1c (-1.0 and -1.3, respectively; p<0.0001) and fasting
      plasma glucose (FPG) (-34.5 mg/dl [-1.92 mmol/l] and -48.0 mg/dl [-2.67 mmol/l], 
      respectively; p<0.0001); these differences compared with placebo were also
      significant (p<0.0001). Pioglitazone (15 or 30 mg) yielded significant increases 
      in HDL-C levels (mean increases ranging from +7.1% to + 9.3%) compared with
      baseline or placebo (p<0.01). The 30 mg dose also significantly reduced mean
      triglyceride levels (-23.7%) compared with placebo (p=0.0218). No consistent
      changes in TC or LDL-C levels were observed. The incidence of adverse events was 
      similar in all treatment groups, although the incidences of weight increase,
      hypoglycaemia and oedema were higher among patients receiving insulin plus
      pioglitazone. There was no evidence of hepatotoxicity or drug-induced elevations 
      of serum ALT > or = 3 x ULN. Pioglitazone, when added to stable insulin regimens,
      significantly improved HbA1c and FPG in type 2 diabetes. Pioglitazone treatment
      also provided significant benefit with respect to plasma HDL-C and triglyceride
      levels. Whether these lipid changes have an impact on overall diabetic
      complications remains to be determined.

TI  - Simultaneous glyburide/metformin therapy is superior to component monotherapy as 
      an initial pharmacological treatment for type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 201-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether simultaneous initial treatment of both insulin
      resistance and impaired beta-cell insulin secretion with glyburide/metformin
      tablets is superior to monotherapy with each component agent. RESEARCH DESIGN AND
      METHODS: In this randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multicentre
      study, 806 patients with type 2 diabetes (mean duration, 3 years) who had failed 
      diet and exercise were randomly assigned to 4 weeks of therapy with placebo,
      glyburide 2.5 mg, metformin 500 mg, glyburide/metformin 1.25/250 mg, or
      glyburide/metformin 2.5/500 mg once daily. Doses were then titrated over 8 weeks 
      based on glycaemic response. The primary outcome measure was change from baseline
      in mean HbA1c after 20 weeks. Changes in fasting plasma glucose, lipids and body 
      weight were also assessed along with 2-h postprandial glucose and insulin values 
      after a standardized meal. RESULTS: At week 20, patients taking
      glyburide/metformin 1.25/250 mg or 2.5/500 mg tablets had greater reductions in
      HbA1c levels (-1.48% and -1.53% respectively) compared with placebo (-0.21%; both
      p < 0.001), glyburide (-1.24%; p = 0.016 and p = 0.004 respectively) or metformin
      (-1.03%; both p < 0.001). Fasting plasma glucose concentrations were reduced more
      in both glyburide/metformin groups compared with placebo and metformin (p <
      0.001); patients in both combination therapy groups also had significantly lower 
      postprandial glucose concentrations compared with placebo, glyburide and
      metformin. CONCLUSIONS: Initial combination treatment with glyburide/metformin
      tablets produces greater improvements in glycaemic control than either glyburide 
      or metformin monotherapy. The superiority of initial therapy with
      glyburide/metformin tablets may arise from simultaneous treatment of both
      pathophysiological defects of type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Multiple drug targets in the management of type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 203-21
AB  - Diabetes mellitus (DM) is being diagnosed at an alarming rate around the world.
      More than 90% of the estimated 200 million affected persons with diabetes
      worldwide have type 2 DM, an often clinically silent disorder. In the United
      States, nearly half of the estimated 16 million persons with diabetes remain
      undiagnosed. Type 2 diabetes is preceded by a long period of impaired glucose
      tolerance (IGT), a potentially reversible metabolic state associated with
      increased risk for macrovascular complications. At the time of diagnosis more
      than one-third of patients have already developed long-term complications of
      diabetes. Genetic and acquired factors contribute to the pathogenesis of type 2
      diabetes. The pathophysiological hallmarks consist of progressive insulin
      resistance, pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction, and excessive hepatic glucose
      production. The ideal treatment for type 2 diabetes should correct insulin
      resistance, beta-cell dysfunction, and normalize hepatic glucose output, as well 
      as prevent, delay, or reverse diabetic complications. Emerging targets for
      therapy of type 2 diabetes include inhibition of gluconeogenesis, lipolysis, and 
      fatty acid oxidation, as well as stimulation of beta3-adrenergic receptors. Drug 
      intervention for obesity is a legitimate adjunct to diabetes management.
      Additional drug targets include interventions to prevent or delay the progression
      of specific complications. Finally, primary prevention of type 2 diabetes is an
      important emerging strategy. The specific pharmacological agents acting at the
      various targets are discussed in this review. A targeted approach to the multiple
      underlying pathophysiologic processes offers the best chance of controlling
      diabetes and complications.

TI  - Thiazolidinediones and type 2 diabetes: new drugs for an old disease.
PG  - 381-6
AB  - Thiazolidinediones are a new class of drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes,
      and act by improving insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue, liver and skeletal
      muscle. Rosiglitazone and pioglitazone are registered for use in monotherapy, and
      in combination with sulfonylureas and metformin. Pioglitazone is also licensed
      for use in combination with insulin. There is level II evidence that in patients 
      with inadequate glycaemic control both drugs reduce the level of HbA1c and
      fasting plasma glucose (FPG) when used as monotherapy and in combination with
      sulfonylurea or metformin or insulin; and both drugs increase levels of HDL and
      LDL and lower free fatty acid levels, but only pioglitazone significantly lowers 
      triglyceride levels. Both drugs lower fasting insulin and C-peptide levels. In
      monotherapy, they may be slightly less potent at reducing the level of HbA1c than
      sulfonylureas or metformin. The maximal effect of these agents may not be seen
      for 6-14 weeks after commencement. Both drugs are well tolerated but liver
      function must be checked at baseline every second month for the first year, and
      periodically thereafter. The drugs are currently contraindicated in patients with
      moderate to severe liver dysfunction and alanine aminotransferase levels more
      than 2.5 times normal, New York Heart Association III-IV cardiac status,
      pregnancy, lactation and in children. The main side effects include weight gain, 
      oedema, and mild dilutional anaemia.

TI  - Current oral agents for type 2 diabetes. Many options, but which to choose when?
PG  - 32-4, 37-40, 43-6
AB  - Increasingly, type 2 diabetes takes a toll on public health and healthcare costs 
      in the United States. Although the remedy for this growing problem is very
      complex, two critical components of its control are prevention and effective
      therapy. Progress in diabetes prevention is likely to take decades. But
      fortunately, growth in our understanding of what occurs in this chronic disease
      has led to advances in the pharmacologic options aimed at decreasing
      hyperglycemia, the main clinically measurable metabolic consequence of diabetes. 
      In this article, Drs Ahmann and Riddle provide an overview of the oral agents now
      available for the treatment of diabetes and discuss the clinical factors that
      help determine when to use which medication and what outcome to expect.

TI  - A rapid increase in beta-cell function by multiple insulin injections in type 2
      diabetic patients is not further enhanced by prolonging treatment.
PG  - 307-16
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Intensive insulin treatment in type 2 diabetes can improve beta-cell
      function. It is not known which duration of treatment achieves maximal
      improvement. We addressed this question in type 2 diabetic patients who displayed
      features of 'secondary failure'. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHOD: Ten patients were
      randomized to multiple insulin injection (MI) therapy for 9 weeks. Another 10
      patients started with bedtime insulin (BTI) and continued their peroral
      medication. Following 9 weeks of treatment, patients on MI switched to BTI and
      glibenclamide. RESULTS: Three days of MI led to a decrease in fasting
      proinsulin/insulin ratio, 0.43 +/- 0.20 vs. 0.29 +/- 0.11, P=0.01 and an increase
      in glucagon-stimulated C-peptide over baseline, 0.77 +/- 0.43 vs. 1.28 +/- 0.44
      nmol L-1, P 0.02. Nine weeks of MI treatment successively decreased fasting and
      nonfasting blood glucose in parallel with increasing insulin dosage. Initial
      improvements in secretion parameters were upheld but not further enhanced, the 9 
      week proinsulin/insulin ratio being 99 +/- 23% and that of glucagon-stimulated
      C-peptide being 95 +/- 24% of the values obtained after 3 days of treatment.
      Eight weeks after termination of MI there persisted a total weight gain that
      tended to be larger than after continuous peroral medication with BTI.
      CONCLUSION: Improvement of insulin secretion by intensive insulin treatment is
      rapidly gained with no further effect obtained after a longer treatment period.
      This finding, as well as undesirable effects of MI on body weight, argues against
      prolonged MI treatment as a prelude to other therapeutic regimens in type 2
      diabetic patients.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics, tolerability, and fructosamine-lowering effect of a novel,
      controlled-release formulation of alpha-lipoic acid.
PG  - 29-35
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of a
      novel, controlled-release oral formulation of alpha-lipoic acid (LA) and to
      investigate whether sustaining the concentration of LA in plasma would have a
      beneficial effect on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: 
      For the pharmacokinetic study, a single, 600-mg dose of either controlled-release
      LA (CRLA) or quick-release LA (QRLA) was administered orally to 12 normal human
      subjects. The plasma profile of LA was determined for 24 hours after
      administration of the dose,and pharmacokinetic analyses were performed. For the
      safety and tolerability study, 21 patients with type 2 diabetes were given 900 mg
      of CRLA daily for 6 weeks, followed by 1,200 mg of CRLA daily for an additional 6
      weeks. Active treatment was followed by a 3-week washout period. Throughout the
      study, patients continued to take their prestudy antidiabetic medications, which 
      included metformin (Glucophage), sulfonylureas (Amaryl, glyburide, and
      Glucotrol), acarbose (Precose), troglitazone (Rezulin), and insulin (either as
      monotherapy or in combination). CRLA was evaluated for safety and tolerability as
      well as for effects on glycemic control. RESULTS: The Tmax (time to maximal
      plasma concentration) of LA administered as CRLA was 1.25 hours and was
      approximately 2.5-fold longer in comparison with the Tmax for QRLA (Tn,5X = 0.5
      hour; P<0.02). No severe side effects or changes in either liver or kidney
      function or hematologic profiles were noted after the administration of CRLA. In 
      15 patients, the mean plasma fructosamine concentration was reduced from 313 to
      283 micromol/L(P<0.05) after 12 weeks of treatment with CRLA. CONCLUSION: CRLA
      increased the plasma concentration of LA over time in healthy subjects, and CRLA 
      was safe, well tolerated, and effective in reducing plasma fructosamine in
      patients with type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Evaluation of innovative skin-marking technique performed before thyroid
      ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsies.
PG  - 5-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To introduce an innovative skin-marking technique performed before
      ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (US-FNAB) of the thyroid.
      METHODS: We studied 248 patients with thyroid nodules, who were classified on the
      basis of physical examination into two groups-those with palpable nodules (N =
      127) and those with nonpalpable or difficult-to-palpate nodules (N = 121). Each
      group was further subdivided according to the size of the thyroid nodule (< or = 
      15 mm versus >15 mm). Before US-FNAB, we performed the skin-marking technique
      with the aid of a catheter, a permanent marker, and ultrasound guidance. An
      established point for needle entry was indicated on the skin. The chi-square test
      was used to compare results between the groups of patients. RESULTS: The
      proportions of adequate and insufficient biopsy material in the overall group of 
      patients were 88.7% and 11.3%, respectively. When the patients were stratified by
      palpable and nonpalpable thyroid nodules, biopsy specimens were adequate in 89.8%
      and insufficient in 10.2% of those with palpable nodules, whereas the
      corresponding proportions for those with nonpalpable nodules were 87.6% and
      12.4%, respectively. No statistically significant differences were noted between 
      the two groups. Comparisons between patients with thyroid nodules >15 mm in their
      largest diameter versus those with nodules < or =15 mm also showed no
      statistically significant differences in terms of insufficient biopsy material.
      CONCLUSION: Our technique creates a marking on the skin that leads directly to
      the thyroid nodule and facilitates the acquisition of adequate cytologic
      material. This is particularly relevant when small transducers are not available 
      or when the physician needs reassurance about the accuracy of the thyroid biopsy 
      site.

TI  - Effects of dietary treatment alone or diet with voglibose or glyburide on
      abdominal adipose tissue and metabolic abnormalities in patients with newly
      diagnosed type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 658-62
AB  - OBJECTIVE; To examine the effects of diet and diet with voglibose or glyburide on
      abdominal adiposity and metabolic abnormalities in patients with type 2 diabetes.
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 36 Japanese patients with newly diagnosed
      type 2 diabetes (50.8 +/- 8.6 years of age, BMI 24.5 +/- 3.5 kg/m(2)) and 273
      normal control subjects were studied. The patients were treated for 3 months with
      diet alone (30 kcal/kg per day) (n = 15), diet with voglibose (n = 12), or diet
      with glyburide (n = 9). They underwent 75-g oral glucose tolerance testing,
      assessment of insulin sensitivity (SI), and acute insulin response (AIR) with
      intravenous glucose tolerance testing based on the minimal model, and measurement
      of abdominal visceral adipose tissue area (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue
      area (SAT) by computed tomography before and after treatment. RESULTS: The
      diabetic patients had comparable SAT but larger VAT than the control subjects.
      With a mean weight loss of 2-3 kg, VAT and SAT were decreased similarly in all
      treatment groups. The VAT-to-SAT ratio was decreased only in the voglibose group.
      Glycemic control and serum lipid profiles were improved in all groups. Changes in
      glycemic control after diet were closely correlated with changes in VAT but not
      with changes in SAT. SI and AIR were unchanged in the diet group but were
      improved in the voglibose and glyburide groups. CONCLUSIONS: In Japanese patients
      with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes who were relatively lean but had excess VAT,
      diet with or without voglibose or glyburide effectively reduced VAT. Decrease in 
      VAT was closely associated with improvement of glycemic control with diet.
      Additional use of voglibose or low-dose glyburide had no detrimental effects on
      abdominal adiposity and had beneficial effects on SI and AIR.

TI  - The NEPI antidiabetes study (NANSY). 1: short-term dose-effect relations of
      glimepiride in subjects with impaired fasting glucose.
PG  - 443-51
AB  - AIM: NANSY is a randomised, placebo-controlled Swedish-Norwegian study which aims
      to include 2 x 1112 male and female subjects with impaired fasting glucose (IFG),
      to assess whether conversion to type 2 diabetes can be delayed by addition of
      sulphonylurea to dietary regulation and increased exercise. This pilot study was 
      conducted to find the optimum dose of glimepiride in NANSY. METHODS: In a double 
      blind trial in primary care 25 IFG subjects were in random order exposed to
      single doses and one-week treatments with 0 (placebo), 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg
      glimepiride once daily. The optimum dose was assessed by measuring blood glucose 
      during oral 75 g glucose tolerance test (OGTT), comparing fasting blood glucose, 
      and the area under the blood glucose curve (AUC), and by monitoring hypoglycaemic
      events. RESULTS: With single doses, there was a clear dose-response relationship 
      for the reduction in AUC, with a statistically significant difference only
      between placebo (mean 1981, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1883-2078) and 2 mg
      glimepiride (mean 1763, 95% CI 1665-1861). However, following 1-week treatments, 
      the only significant difference was between placebo (mean 1934, 95% CI 1856-2012)
      and 1 mg glimepiride (mean 1714, 95% CI 1637-1792). Correspondingly, the only
      statistically significant difference in fasting blood glucose day 7 was between
      placebo (5.87 mmol/l, 95% CI 5.68-6.05 mmol/l) and 1 mg glimepiride (5.42 mmol/l,
      95% CI 5.21-5.62 mmol/l). Chemical hypoglycaemia was common but hypoglycaemic
      symptoms were rare and similar between the active doses, and easily countered by 
      the subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The sulphonylurea dose-effect curve may be
      bell-shaped, perhaps due to down regulation of sulphonylurea receptors during
      chronic exposure. Alternatively, the finding could be a rebound phenomenon,
      secondary to preceding hypoglycaemia. The optimum dose for NANSY was found to be 
      1 mg glimepiride.

TI  - The effects of intensive glycaemic control on body composition in patients with
      type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 410-6
AB  - AIM: To examine the effects of improved glycaemic control over 20 weeks on the
      type and distribution of weight change in patients with type 2 diabetes who at
      baseline have poor glycaemic control. METHODS: Forty-three patients with type 2
      diabetes and HbA1c > 8.9% were randomised to either intensive glycaemic control
      (IC) n = 21 or usual glycaemic control (UC) n = 22 for 20 weeks. Dual energy
      X-ray absorptiometry was used to assess the type and distribution of weight
      change during the study. RESULTS: After 20 weeks HbA1c was significantly lower in
      patients randomised to IC than UC (HbA1c IC 8.02 +/- 0.25% vs. UC 10.23 +/-
      0.23%, p < 0.0001). In the IC group weight increased by 3.2 +/- 0.8 kg after 20
      weeks (fat-free mass increased by 1.8 +/- 0.3 kg) compared to 0.02 +/- 0.70 kg in
      UC (p = 0.003). The gain in total body fat mass comprised trunk fat mass (IC 0.94
      +/- 0.5 kg vs. UC 0.04 +/- 0.4 kg, p = 0.18) and peripheral fat mass (total body 
      fat - trunk fat) (IC 0.71 +/- 0.32 kg vs. UC -0.21 +/- 0.28 kg, p = 0.04). Blood 
      pressure and serum lipid concentrations did not change over time in either group.
      CONCLUSIONS: Intensive glycaemic control was associated with weight gain which
      was distributed in similar proportions between the central and peripheral regions
      and consisted of similar proportions of fat and fat-free mass. Blood pressure and
      serum lipid concentrations were not adversely affected.

TI  - Effects and serum levels of glibenclamide and its active metabolites in patients 
      with type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 403-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the effects and serum levels of glibenclamide (Gb) and its
      active metabolites in patients on chronic Gb medication on different daily doses.
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty patients with type 2 diabetes on regular Gb therapy
      (1.75-14.0 mg daily). Blood samples were taken immediately before and 90 min
      after regular Gb intake. A standardized breakfast was served 30 min after drug
      intake. Serum insulin and proinsulin levels were determined by ELISA methods
      without cross-reactivities. Serum drug levels were determined by HPLC. Fischer's 
      R to Z-test (correlation coefficients) and paired Student t-tests were used when 
      comparing values within the entire group and unpaired non-parametric Mann-Whitney
      tests were used when comparing high and low dose levels. A p-value < 0.05 was
      considered significant. RESULTS: There were significant correlations between
      daily Gb dose, on the one hand, and, on the other, HbAlc (r = 0.55),
      Delta-insulin (r = - 0.59) and Delta-proinsulin (r = - 0.52) levels. Significant 
      correlations between Gb therapy duration and insulin (r = - 0.40) and proinsulin 
      (r = - 0.34) secretion and between Gb dose and ratio proinsulin/insulin (RPI) at 
      both time points (r = 0.32 and 0.30) were also found. The RPI was lower after Gb 
      intake. In patients on > or = 10.5 mg steady state serum metabolite levels (Ml
      and Ml + M2) were higher (29(0-120) and 33 (0-120) ng/ml) than those of Gb itself
      (18(0-64) ng/ml). A great inter-subject variability in Gb levels at both time
      points was seen. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that, in patients on chronic
      medication, Gb is capable of stimulating both insulin and proinsulin secretion;
      the effect on insulin release is relatively greater. The effect was more
      pronounced in patients on a low Gb dose, either because of less impaired
      beta-cells in those receiving low doses, or due to reduced sulphonylurea
      sensitivity in those on high dosage (down-regulation). In patients on a daily
      dose of 10.5 mg or more, serum metabolite levels of clinical relevance were
      demonstrated; the metabolites may contribute to hypoglycaemic events.

TI  - Alternative therapies for type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 45-58
AB  - Type 2 diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease that has a significant impact on
      the health, quality of life, and life expectancy of patients, as well as on the
      health care system. Exercise, diet, and weight control continue to be essential
      and effective means of improving glucose homeostasis. However, lifestyle
      management measures may be insufficient or patient compliance difficult,
      rendering conventional drug therapies (i.e., oral glucose-lowering agents and
      insulin injection) necessary in many patients. In addition to adverse effects,
      drug treatments are not always satisfactory in maintaining euglycemia and
      avoiding late stage diabetic complications. As an alternative approach, medicinal
      herbs with antihyperglycemic activities are increasingly sought by diabetic
      patients and health care professionals. Commonly used herbs and other alternative
      therapies, less likely to have the side effects of conventional approaches for
      type 2 diabetes, are reviewed.

TI  - "A" is for amylin and amyloid in type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 124-39
AB  - Amyloid deposits within the islet of the pancreas have been known for a century. 
      In 1987, the islet amyloid precursor polypeptide (IAPP) amylin (a 37 amino acid) 
      was discovered. Recently there has been an explosion of amylin's importance in
      the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This review is intended to
      share what is understood about amylin derived amyloid and the role it plays in
      T2DM. Whether islet amyloid is an epiphenomenona, a tombstone, or a trigger it
      leaves an indelible footprint in greater that 70% of the patients with T2DM.
      There is current data supporting the damaging role of intermediate sized toxic
      amyloid particles to the beta cell resulting in a beta cell defect which
      contributes to a relative deficiency or loss of insulin secretion. Within the
      islet there is an intense redox stress which may be associated with the unfolding
      of amylin's native secondary structure compounding its amyloidogenic properties. 
      In addition to the beta cell defect there may be an absorptive defect as a result
      of amyloid deposition in the basement membranes which form an envelope around the
      inta-islet capillary endothelium. We have an opportunity to change our current
      treatment modalities with newer medications and we should attempt to diagnose
      T2DM earlier and use these newer treatment strategies in combination to decrease 
      glucotoxicity without elevating endogenous insulin and amylin. In the 21st
      century our goal should be to prevent remodeling, save the pancreatic islet,
      conquer islet amyloid, and amyloid diabetes.

TI  - Vascular effects of glibenclamide vs. glimepiride and metformin in Type 2
      diabetic patients.
PG  - 136-43
AB  - AIMS: Glibenclamide attenuates the protective responses to opening of vascular
      ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channels during ischaemia. Therefore,
      glibenclamide treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus may have hazardous
      cardiovascular effects when used under conditions of ischaemia. Glimepiride and
      metformin seem to lack such characteristics. Based on these data, we hypothesized
      that, in contrast to glibenclamide, chronic treatment of Type 2 diabetic patients
      with glimepiride or metformin will not impair the vasodilator function of K(ATP) 
      opening in vivo. METHODS: Two groups of 12 Type 2 diabetes mellitus patients
      participated in a double-blind randomized cross-over study consisting of two
      8-week periods, in which treatment with orally administered glibenclamide (15
      mg/day) was compared with either glimepiride or metformin (6 mg and 1500 mg/day, 
      respectively). At the end of each treatment period, the increase in forearm blood
      flow (FBF, venous occlusion plethysmography) in response to intra-arterial
      administered diazoxide (K(ATP) opener), acetylcholine (endothelium-dependent
      vasodilator) and dipyridamole (adenosine-uptake blocker) and to forearm ischaemia
      was measured. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in vasodilator
      responses to diazoxide, acetylcholine, dipyridamole and forearm ischaemia after
      glibenclamide compared with glimepiride and metformin. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic
      treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus with glimepiride or metformin has similar
      effects on vascular K(ATP) channels compared with chronic glibenclamide
      treatment.

TI  - Effects of treatment with sulfonylurea drugs or insulin on ischemia-induced
      myocardial dysfunction in type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 808-12
AB  - In patients with diabetes and coronary artery disease, the potential negative
      role of sulfonylurea drugs is under intensive investigation. We assessed the
      effects of treatment with glibenclamide or insulin on the extension of left
      ventricular myocardial dysfunction induced by acute ischemia. Nineteen
      consecutive patients with type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease entered the
      study. Each patient was randomly assigned to either insulin or glibenclamide
      therapy. Treatment was crossed over after 12 weeks and maintained for another 12 
      weeks. At the end of each treatment, left ventricular myocardial function at rest
      and during dipyridamole infusion was studied by two-dimensional echocardiography 
      under the same conditions of metabolic control. Glibenclamide or insulin
      treatment did not influence the rest values of left ventricular dimensions, left 
      ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), or wall motion score index (WMSI).
      Dipyridamole infusion, in patients receiving glibenclamide treatment, decreased
      LVEF (43 +/- 7 vs. 37 +/- 12%, P < 0.005) and increased WMSI (1.4 +/- 0.28 vs.
      1.98 +/- 0.24, P < 0.001) compared with baseline values; during insulin
      treatment, LVEF (46 +/- 8 vs. 45 +/- 11%, NS) and WMSI (1.4 +/- 0.29 vs. 1.6 +/- 
      0.4, NS) did not change significantly. Peak stress LVEF was higher (45 +/- 11 vs.
      37 +/- 12%, P < 0.001) and WMSI lower (1.6 +/- 0.4 vs. 1.98 +/- 0.24, P < 0.001) 
      in patients receiving insulin. The results indicate that in patients with type 2 
      diabetes and coronary artery disease, ischemic myocardial dysfunction induced by 
      dipyridamole infusion is less severe during treatment with insulin than with
      glibenclamide. Restitution of a preconditioning mechanism in insulin-treated
      patients may be the potential beneficial mechanism.

TI  - Vascular K(ATP) channel blockade by glibenclamide, but not by acarbose, in
      patients with Type II diabetes.
PG  - 307-14
AB  - Glibenclamide inhibits the opening of vascular ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP))
      channels, which represents a protective mechanism during ischaemia. This effect
      may imply harmful cardiovascular effects of glibenclamide when used under
      conditions of ischaemia in patients with Type II diabetes. Acarbose is not
      associated with effects on the cardiovascular system, because the drug is not
      absorbed from the bowel. Therefore we hypothesized that treatment of Type II
      diabetes patients with glibenclamide will impair the vasodilator function of
      K(ATP) opening, unlike treatment with acarbose. A double-blind randomized
      cross-over study in 12 patients with Type II diabetes was performed to compare
      the effects of glibenclamide with those of acarbose on the vasodilator responses 
      to K(ATP) channel opening in the forearm vascular bed. The study consisted of two
      periods: 8 weeks of treatment with orally administered glibenclamide (10 mg x
      day(-1)) followed by 8 weeks of treatment with acarbose (300 mg x day(-1)), or
      vice versa. At the end of each treatment period, forearm blood flow (venous
      occlusion plethysmography) in response to intra-arterially administered
      diazoxide, acetylcholine and dipyridamole and to forearm ischaemia was measured. 
      The diazoxide-mediated increase in the forearm blood flow ratio (infused/control 
      arm) was significantly less pronounced after glibenclamide than after acarbose
      (290 +/- 58% and 561 +/- 101% respectively; P<0.0005). Forearm blood flow
      responses to acetylcholine, dipyridamole and forearm ischaemia were similar
      during glibenclamide and acarbose treatment. Thus, in patients with Type II
      diabetes mellitus, treatment with glibenclamide is associated with an attenuated 
      response to K(ATP) opening as compared with treatment with acarbose. This implies
      that glibenclamide may affect defensive mechanisms under conditions of K(ATP)
      channel activation.

TI  - New trends in the development of oral antidiabetic drugs.
PG  - 53-71
AB  - A large number of oral antidiabetic agents are available today. This article
      provides a short review of the pharmacology and some clinical aspects of various 
      oral antidiabetic drugs. It focuses mainly on the newest developing drugs
      (therapy of the near future) and on the most commonly used older groups for the
      common approach of every-day practice (sulphonylureas). The primary goal of this 
      review is to compare the electrophysiological effects of glibenclamide in
      isolated normal and streptozotocin induced diabetic rats and alloxan induced
      rabbits ventricular preparations, while on the other hand to differentiate the
      hypoglycaemic sulphonylureas (0.1-1000 mmol/kg) according to their cardiovascular
      activity in healthy and diabetic animals. In vitro (1-100 micromol/l) as well as 
      chronically treated (5 mg/kg for 10 weeks) glibenclamide prolonged the action
      potential duration in normal but failed to affect it in diabetic ventricular
      preparations. Our results suggest that the sensitivity to glibenclamide of K(ATP)
      channels in diabetic ventricular fibers is drastically decreased. The effects of 
      different sulphonylureas (tolbutamide, glibenclamide, gliclazide, glimepiride) on
      ventricular ectopic beats as well as the duration of ventricular fibrillation
      induced by 10 min ischemia/50 min reperfusion in healthy and diabetic rats were
      compared. Tolbutamide and gliclazide dose-dependently enhanced both parameters
      both in healthy and diabetic groups. Glibenclamide in healthy rats increased,
      while in diabetic rats it decreased the arrhythmogenicity. Glimepiride depressed 
      the arrhythmogenicity in both healthy and diabetic animals. Glimepiride proved to
      dose-dependently enhance the myocardial tissue flow in dog in contrast to
      glibenclamide. These results confirm that glimepiride has less cardiovascular
      actions than other sulphonylureas. From the newest oral antidiabetics this review
      tries to emphasize the most important basic pharmacological properties, mechanism
      of action, therapeutic use.

TI  - Modeling the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a unique oral hypoglycemic 
      agent using neural networks.
PG  - 87-91
AB  - PURPOSE: To develop a predictive population pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic
      (PK/PD) model for repaglinide (REP), an oral hypoglycemic agent, using artificial
      neural networks (ANNs). METHODS: REP, glucose concentrations, and demographic
      data from a dose ranging Phase 2 trial were divided into a training set (70%) and
      a test set (30%). NeuroShell Predictor was used to create predictive PK and PK/PD
      models using population covariates: evaluate the relative significance of
      different covariates; and simulate the effect of covariates on the PK/PD of REP. 
      Predictive performance was evaluated by calculating root mean square error and
      mean error for the training and test sets. These values were compared to naive
      averaging (NA) and randomly generated numbers (RN). RESULTS: Covariates found to 
      have an influence on PK of REP include dose, gender. race, age, and weight.
      Covariates affecting the glucose response included dose, gender, and weight.
      These differences are not expected to be clinically significant. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      came to the following three conclusions: 1) ANNs are more precise than NA and RN 
      for both PK and PD; 2) the bias was acceptable for ANNs as compared with NA and
      RN; and 3) neural networks offer a quick and simple method for predicting, for
      identifying significant covariates, and for generating hypotheses.

TI  - Glibenclamide vs gliclazide in reducing oxidative stress in patients of
      noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus--a double blind randomized study.
PG  - 803-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Parameters of oxidative stress were quantitated in 50 patients with
      type 2 diabetes mellitus in uncontrolled state and after control using oral
      glibenclamide or gliclazide. The estimates were further compared between the two 
      groups irrespective of drug used to evaluate the difference, if any. METHODS: The
      study was a double blind, uncontrolled, noncrossover and randomized trial. Fifty 
      patients of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes were divided in to two groups. Group I
      (25 patients) received capsule A (glibenclamide) while Group II (25 patients)
      received capsule B (gliclazide). The parameters studied were Superoxide dismutase
      (SOD), malonyl-dialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH). They were done at 
      (a) uncontrolled stage (FBS--165 +/- 16.7 mg/dl, PP--240 +/- 30.1 mg/dl and
      HbA1--10.5 +/- 0.9% in group I and FBS--150 +/- 15.8 mg/dl, PP--246 +/- 29.1
      mg/dl HbA1 10.6 +/- 0.8% in group II) and during controlled stage at 12 weeks
      (FBS--120 +/- 18.5 mg/dl, PP--180 +/- 19.1 mg/dl and HbA1--8.4 +/- 0.29% in group
      I and FBS--118 +/- 17.6 mg/dl, PP--176 +/- 20.1 mg/dl and HbA1--8.5 +/- 0.39% in 
      group II patients). RESULTS: The significantly raised levels of MDA and SOD, and 
      decreased levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) during uncontrolled stage of
      diabetes indicated free radical stress induced lipid peroxidation. The
      significant fall of MDA and SOD and increased levels of GSH in blood in both
      groups after control revealed beneficial effects of glycemic control on oxidative
      stress. The levels were not normalized and stayed higher than those in controls. 
      On intergroup comparison; the control of diabetes with gliclazide (group II)
      showed improvement in oxidative stress (MDA, GSH) better (p < 0.001) than
      glibenclamide (group I). CONCLUSION: Oxidative stress in uncontrolled diabetes is
      decreased with glycemic control. The control of diabetes with gliclazide reduced 
      oxidative stress more than glibenclamide, indicating higher antioxidant
      properties of gliclazide. Normalization of oxidative stress was not achieved.
      Further studies are required to see long-term effect of drug therapy in combating
      oxidative stress after achieving acceptable control of diabetes.

TI  - Comparative efficacy of preprandial or postprandial Humalog Mix75/25 versus
      glyburide in patients 60 to 80 years of age with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 73-86
AB  - BACKGROUND: Humalog Mix75/25 (Mix75/25) is a novel premixed insulin containing
      75% neutral protamine lispro (an intermediate-acting insulin) and 25% insulin
      lispro. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare glycemic control and 
      hypoglycemia rates with Mix75/25 versus glyburide, and with preprandial versus
      postprandial Mix75/25, in patients aged 60 to 80 years with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus and persistent hyperglycemia on sulfonylurea therapy. METHODS: In this
      open-label, 16-week, parallel-group study, patients were randomized to 1 of 2
      treatments: glyburide 15 mg/d (or up to the maximum daily dose) or Mix75/25. The 
      Mix75/25 group was randomly subdivided into preprandial (immediately before
      breakfast and dinner) and postprandial (within 15 minutes after the start of
      breakfast and dinner) injection subgroups. The primary outcomes were glycemic
      control and rate of hypoglycemia. RESULTS: A total of 143 patients were
      randomized; 127 completed the study. The change in glycosylated hemoglobin
      (HbA(1c)) from baseline to end point was significantly greater with Mix75/25 than
      with glyburide (mean +/- SEM, -1.14% +/- 0.18% vs -0.36% +/- 0.15%, P = 0.001).
      HbA(1c) changes with preprandial and postprandial Mix75/25 were not significantly
      different (-1.20% +/- 0.26% vs -1.08% +/- 0.26%, P = 0.748). Fasting blood
      glucose (BG), 2-hour postprandial BG, and mean daily BG reductions were greater
      with Mix75/25 than with glyburide (P < 0.001); preprandial and postprandial
      Mix75/25 administration did not differ significantly with respect to any of these
      BG variables. The hypoglycemia rate increased with Mix75/25 by 0.17 +/- 0.02
      episodes per patient per 30 days, but there was no change with glyburide (P =
      0.077). Body weight increased by 1.02 +/- 0.35 kg with Mix75/25 and decreased by 
      0.85 +/- 0.18 kg with glyburide (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with
      glyburide, Mix75/25 significantly improved glycemic control in older patients
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus, could be administered after meals without
      compromising glycemic control, and was well tolerated.

TI  - Sibutramine: new preparation. Slight weight loss; but also a slight rise in blood
      pressure ...
PG  - 140-5
AB  - (1) The reference treatment for achieving weight loss by obese patients is a
      combination of dietary measures, exercise and behavioural interventions. There is
      currently no drug treatment with demonstrated efficacy on the morbidity or
      mortality associated with excess body weight. (2) Sibutramine, a serotonin- and
      noradrenaline-reuptake inhibitor structurally related to the amphetamines has
      been granted marketing authorisation in France for the treatment of obesity and
      excess body weight in patients with associated risk factors. (3) The clinical
      file on sibutramine contains no trial focusing on morbidity or mortality end
      points. (4) According to comparative clinical trials, weight loss during a 6-12
      month course of sibutramine is, on average, between 3 and 9 kg greater than that 
      on placebo. Patients regain weight after sibutramine cessation. (5) Sibutramine
      has little or no benefit on blood sugar or lipid parameters. (6) The main known
      adverse effect of sibutramine is increased blood pressure. Sibutramine also has
      amphetamine-like side effects. (7) In practice, sibutramine currently has no
      place in the management of obesity.

TI  - Sulfonylurea inadequacy: efficacy of addition of insulin over 6 years in patients
      with type 2 diabetes in the U.K. Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS 57).
PG  - 330-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of the addition of insulin when maximal
      sulfonylurea therapy is inadequate in individuals with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH 
      DESIGN AND METHODS: Glycemic control, hypoglycemia, and body weight were
      monitored over 6 years in 826 patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes in 8 
      of 23 U.K. Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) centers that used a modified
      protocol. Patients were randomly allocated to a conventional glucose control
      policy, primarily with diet (n = 242) or an intensive policy with insulin alone
      (n = 245), as in the main study. However, for patients randomized to an intensive
      policy with sulfonylurea (n = 339), insulin was added automatically if the
      fasting plasma glucose remained >108 mg/dl (6.0 mmol/l) despite maximal
      sulfonylurea doses. RESULTS: Over 6 years, approximately 53% of patients
      allocated to treatment with sulfonylurea required additional insulin therapy.
      Median HbA(1c) in the sulfonylurea +/- insulin group was significantly lower
      (6.6%, interquartile range [IQR] 6.0-7.6) than in the group taking insulin alone 
      (7.1%, IQR 6.2-8.0; P = 0.0066), and significantly more patients in the
      sulfonylurea +/- insulin group had an HbA(1c) <7% (47 vs. 35%, respectively; P = 
      0.011). Weight gain was similar in the intensive therapy groups, but major
      hypoglycemia occurred less frequently over all in the sulfonylurea (+/- insulin) 
      group compared with the insulin alone group (1.6 vs. 3.2% per annum,
      respectively; P = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: Early addition of insulin when maximal
      sulfonylurea therapy is inadequate can significantly improve glycemic control
      without promoting increased hypoglycemia or weight gain.

TI  - Glimepiride in type 2 diabetes mellitus Thai patients.
PG  - 1221-8
AB  - This study aimed to confirm the efficacy of glimepiride given once daily in the
      treatment of Thai type 2 diabetic patients and to find out the optimum dosage for
      Thai patients. The patients were enrolled at the diabetic clinics of 5 hospitals 
      (Rajavithi, Chulalongkorn, Pramongkutklao, Siriraj and Theptarin Hospitals). All 
      patients started glimepiride 1 mg once daily and escalated to 2, 3, 4 and until 6
      mg every 4 weeks if fasting plasma glucose (FPG) exceeded 140 mg/dL. Subjects
      were 60 females and 29 males with an average age of 52.2 +/- 10.0 years. Mean BMI
      was 25.5 +/- 3.8 kg/m2. Fifty seven patients (64.0%) were drug naive and thirty
      two patients (36.0%) had been previously treated with oral hypoglycemic agents.
      Seventy three per cent of the drug naive and 37 per cent of the previously
      treated patients could be controlled with 1-2 mg of glimepiride once daily. At
      the twelfth week of treatment, mean fasting plasma glucose decreased from 224.6
      to 156.6 mg/dL (30% reduction) and mean HbA1c decreased from 10.0 to 7.5 per cent
      (25% reduction). At the end of the study 49.4 per cent of the patients had HbA1c 
      < 7.0 per cent, 21.3 per cent had HbA1c 7.0-8.0 per cent and 29.3 per cent had
      HbA1c > 8.0 per cent. Adverse events that were probably or possibly related to
      the drug were reported in 5 patients (5.6%). Three of them were hypoglycemia and 
      two patients had skin rash. All hypoglycemic episodes were mild. Glimepiride was 
      indicated to be safe. There were no clinically significant changes in clinical
      laboratory values, physical examinations and vital signs. In conclusion,
      glimepiride was efficacious and safe in type 2 diabetes Thai patients and 1-2 mg 
      of glimepiride appeared to be a sufficient dose for most newly diagnosed type 2
      diabetic patients.

TI  - Oral antihyperglycemic therapy for type 2 diabetes: clinical applications.
PG  - 373-6
AB  - Oral agents are the mainstay of pharmacologic treatment for type 2 diabetes, and 
      physicians now have a number of agents to choose from. However, more choices
      translate into more complex decision making. Many patients with diabetes have
      associated comorbidities, and most diabetic patients will require more than 1
      agent to achieve good glycemic control. This article illustrates several of the
      pharmacologic approaches to type 2 diabetes through 4 situations that use
      principles of evidence-based medicine. The scenarios also highlight some of the
      difficulties in choosing the optimal pharmacologic treatment regimen for
      individual patients. Physicians should also recognize that type 2 diabetes is a
      multisystem disorder that requires multidisciplinary care, including education
      and ongoing counseling for effective patient self-management of the disease.
      Finally, patient preferences are a vital component of informed decision making
      for pharmacologic treatment of diabetes.

TI  - Oral antihyperglycemic therapy for type 2 diabetes: scientific review.
PG  - 360-72
AB  - CONTEXT: Care of patients with type 2 diabetes has been revolutionized throughout
      the past several years-first, by the realization of the importance of tight
      glycemic control in forestalling complications, and second, by the availability
      of several unique classes of oral antidiabetic agents. Deciphering which agent to
      use in certain clinical situations is a new dilemma facing the primary care
      physician. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review available data from the literature
      regarding the efficacy of oral antidiabetic agents, both as monotherapy and in
      combination. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search was performed to identify all
      English-language reports of unique, randomized controlled clinical trials
      involving recently available oral agents for type 2 diabetes. Bibliographies were
      also reviewed to find additional reports not otherwise identified. STUDY
      SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Studies (63) were included in the analysis if they
      had a study period of at least 3 months; if each group contained at least 10
      subjects at the study's conclusion; and if hemoglobin A(1c) was reported. When
      multiple dosages of a drug were tested, the results of the highest approved
      dosage were used. In placebo-controlled trials, hemoglobin A(1c) data are
      presented as the difference between the change in treated vs placebo subjects.
      DATA SYNTHESIS: Five distinct oral drug classes are now available for the
      treatment of type 2 diabetes. Compared with placebo treatment, most of these
      agents lower hemoglobin A(1c) levels approximately 1% to 2%. Equivalent efficacy 
      is usually demonstrated when different agents are compared with one another in
      the same study population. When they are used in combination, there are
      additional glycemic benefits. Long-term vascular risk reduction has been
      demonstrated only with sulfonylureas and metformin. CONCLUSIONS: With few
      exceptions, the available oral antidiabetic agents are equally effective at
      lowering glucose concentrations. Their mechanisms of action are different,
      however, and as a result they appear to have distinct metabolic effects. These
      are reflected in their adverse effect profiles and their effect on cardiovascular
      risk, which may influence drug choice.

TI  - Pramlintide (Amylin).
PG  - 1575-81
AB  - Pramlintide is a human amylin analog, under development by Amylin (originally in 
      collaboration with Johnson & Johnson), as an adjunct with insulin for the
      potential prevention of complications of type I diabetes, and as a single agent
      for type II diabetes [279804], [295121], [305454]. In December 2000, Amylin
      submitted a US NDA seeking approval to market pramlintide as an adjunctive
      therapy for type 1 and 2 diabetics using insulin [392527]; the application was
      accepted for review by the FDA in January 2001 [396938], and was scheduled for
      review by the Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee on July 26
      2001 [408924]. In May 2001, Amylin submitted an MAA for pramlintide to the EMEA
      [411323] and in October 2001, Amylin received an approvable letter from the FDA
      for both Type I and insulin-using Type II diabetes; however, at this time,
      discussions with the FDA were ongoing regarding additional clinical work that was
      required before the NDA would be approved [425570].

TI  - Current and future treatment strategies for type 2 diabetes: the beta-cell as a
      therapeutic target.
PG  - 1568-74
AB  - Diabetes affects millions of people worldwide. The most common variants are type 
      1 diabetes with autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic beta-cells and type 2
      diabetes with peripheral insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction. In spite
      of tremendous research, current pharmacological regimens are still sub-optimal
      for adequate blood glucose control. As a consequence, patients with diabetes are 
      at significant risk for development of serious long-term complications, such as
      blindness and kidney disease. This review will discuss present and future
      strategies for the treatment of type 2 diabetes with a focus on the more recently
      recognized problems of beta-cell dysfunction and loss. The treatment strategies
      presented include promotion of beta-cell proliferation and differentiation by
      glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists.

TI  - Post-stenotic coronary blood flow at rest is not altered by therapeutic doses of 
      the oral antidiabetic drug glibenclamide in patients with coronary artery
      disease.
PG  - 54-60
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether blood flow in normal and post-stenotic coronary
      arteries is altered by therapeutic doses of the sulfonylurea agent glibenclamide.
      PATIENTS: 12 patients with a high grade stenosis of the left anterior descending 
      coronary artery (n = 10) or left circumflex coronary artery (n = 2), and an
      angiographically normal corresponding left circumflex artery or left anterior
      descending artery, respectively. DESIGN: Two Doppler ultrasound wires were
      positioned in the "normal" and post-stenotic artery for simultaneous measurements
      of coronary blood flow velocity under baseline conditions and after intravenous
      glibenclamide, 0.05 mg/kg body weight. Local coronary blood flow was calculated
      from the average peak velocity and the cross sectional area derived from
      quantitative coronary angiographic analysis. Coronary flow reserve was determined
      after intracoronary injection of 30 microg adenosine and 12 mg papaverine.
      RESULTS: One hour after glibenclamide, serum insulin increased from (mean (SD))
      7.4 (2.0) to 44.8 (25.5) mU/l (p < 0.005), and C peptide from 1.4 (0.4) to 3.4
      (1.2) ng/l (p = 0.005). In normal coronary arteries coronary flow reserve was 2.6
      (0.4) after adenosine and 3.0 (0.4) after papaverine, while in post-stenotic
      arterial segments it was 1.2 (0.3) after adenosine (p = 0.005) and 1.3 (0.3)
      after papaverine (p = 0.005). There was no significant difference after
      glibenclamide. In non-stenotic arteries, average peak velocity (18.8 (5.2) cm/s) 
      and calculated coronary blood flow (23.8 (10.7) ml/min) were not altered by
      glibenclamide (18.3 (5.2) cm/s and 22.8 (10.4) ml/min, respectively). In
      post-stenotic arteries, baseline average peak velocity was 13.3 (4.9) ml/min and 
      coronary blood flow was 9.1 (3.0) ml/min, without significant change after
      glibenclamide (13.3 (5.2) cm/s, 9.0 (3.2) ml/min). CONCLUSIONS: Glibenclamide,
      0.05 mg/kg intravenously, is effective in increasing serum insulin, suggesting a 
      K(ATP) channel blocking effect in pancreatic beta cells. It does not compromise
      coronary blood flow and vasodilatation in response to adenosine and papaverine in
      post-stenotic and angiographically normal coronary arteries at rest.

TI  - Hepatotoxicity with thiazolidinediones: is it a class effect?
PG  - 873-88
AB  - Decreased insulin sensitivity plays a major role in various human diseases.
      particularly type 2 diabetes mellitus, and is associated with a higher risk of
      atherosclerosis and cardiovascular complications. Thiazolidinediones, more
      commonly termed glitazones, are the first drugs to specifically target muscular
      insulin resistance. They have proven efficacy for reducing plasma glucose levels 
      in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with diet alone,
      sulphonylureas, metformin or insulin. In addition, they are associated with some 
      improvement of the cardiovascular risk profile. However, troglitazone, the first 
      compound approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the US, proved to be
      hepatotoxic and was withdrawn from the market after the report of several dozen
      deaths or cases of severe hepatic failure requiring liver transplantation. It
      remains unclear whether or not hepatotoxicity is a class effect or is related to 
      unique properties of troglitazone. Rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, two other
      glitazones, appear to have similar efficacy with regard to blood glucose control 
      in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus as compared with troglitazone. In
      controlled clinical trials, the incidence of significant (> or =3 x upper limit
      of normal) increases in liver enzyme levels (ALT in particular) was similar with 
      rosiglitazone or pioglitazone as compared with placebo, whereas troglitazone was 
      associated with a 3-fold greater incidence. In contrast to the numerous case
      reports of acute liver failure in patients receiving troglitzone, only a few case
      reports of hepatotoxicity have been reported in patients treated with
      rosiglitazone until now, with a causal relationship remaining uncertain.
      Furthermore, no single case of severe hepatotoxicity has been reported yet with
      pioglitazone. It should be mentioned that troglitazone, unlike pioglitazone and
      rosiglitazone, induces the cytochrome P450 isoform 3A4, which is partly
      responsible for its metabolism, and may be prone to drug interactions.
      Importantly enough, obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus are 
      associated with liver abnormalities, especially non-alcoholic steatohepatitis,
      independent of any pharmacological treatment. This association obviously
      complicates the selection of patients who are good candidates for a treatment
      with glitazones as well as the monitoring of liver tests after initiation of
      therapy with any thiazolidinedione compound. While regular monitoring of liver
      enzymes is still recommended and more long term data are desirable, current
      evidence from clinical trials and postmarketing experience in the US supports the
      conclusion that rosiglitazone and pioglitazone do not share the hepatotoxic
      profile of troglitazone.

TI  - Glycemic control with Humalog Mix25 in type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled
      with glyburide.
PG  - 1732-44
AB  - BACKGROUND: Humalog Mix25 (Mix25) is a premixed insulin mixture of 25% insulin
      lispro and 75% neutral protamine lispro. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to 
      quantitate the improvement in glycemic control achieved with Mix25 versus the
      maximum dose of glyburide (GB) in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately
      controlled with GB. METHODS: In this randomized, parallel, open-label comparative
      study, patients with type 2 diabetes received either Mix25 before the morning and
      evening meals for 4 months or GB 15 mg daily for 4 months. Glycemic control was
      assessed by glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) measurements, 4-point self-monitored 
      blood glucose profiles, and patient-reported hypoglycemia. Patients also
      completed a treatment satisfaction questionnaire at the end of the study.
      RESULTS: All 172 patients were white; 85 were randomized to receive Mix25. The
      mean age was 59.5 +/- 8.2 years, and 35.5% (61/172) were men. The mean body mass 
      index was 27.2 kg/m2. The mean duration of type 2 diabetes was 10.2 +/- 6.6
      years, and the mean duration of sulfonylurea treatment was 5.8 +/- 5.9 years. The
      mean HbA1c and fasting blood glucose levels were 10.07% +/- 1.4% and 11.6 +/- 2.8
      mmol/L, respectively, in the glyburide group and 9.85% +/- 1.2% and 12.2 +/- 2.9 
      mmol/L, respectively, in the Mix25 group. There were no statistically significant
      differences between the treatment groups at baseline for any of the demographic
      or efficacy variables. At end point, mean HbA1c was significantly lower in the
      Mix25 group than in the GB group (Mix25, 8.5% +/- 1.3%; GB, 9.4% +/- 1.8%; P =
      0.001). A larger decrease from baseline in HbA1c and in all self-monitored blood 
      glucose values was observed in the Mix25 group: -1.4% versus -0.7% for HbA1c, P =
      0.004; -2.8 mmol/L versus -1.1 mmol/L for fasting blood glucose, P < 0.01; -5.1
      mmol/L versus -1.7 mmol/L for the morning 2-hour postprandial blood glucose, P < 
      0.001; -2.2 mmol/L versus -0.8 mmol/L for the evening preprandial blood glucose, 
      P < 0.05; and -4.4 mmol/L versus -1.5 mmol/L for the evening 2-hour postprandial 
      blood glucose, P < 0.001. Patients expressed more satisfaction with Mix25 than
      with GB, as measured by the weighted combined score on a treatment satisfaction
      questionnaire (2.0 +/- 1.3 vs 0.7 +/- 1.3). The mean hypoglycemia rate (events
      per patient per 30 days) was significantly higher in the Mix25 group at end point
      (Mix25, 0.30 +/- 0.53; GB, 0.05 +/- 0.20; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with 
      maximum-dose GB, twice-daily injections of Mix25 resulted in improved glycemic
      control and treatment satisfaction, and were associated with a predictably higher
      rate of hypoglycemia in this group of patients with type 2 diabetes who were
      inadequately controlled with maximum-dose GB. Although the inclusion of patients 
      who were inadequately controlled with GB was intended to allow a comparison of
      the 2 treatments with respect to efficacy and tolerability in a real-life
      setting, a double-blind comparison in treatment-naive individuals may have
      resulted in a different outcome.

TI  - Prescribing patterns and therapeutic implications for diabetic hypertension in
      Bahrain.
PG  - 1350-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine drug prescription patterns and the extent of conformity
      with World Health Organization/international Society of Hypertension (WHO/ISH)
      guidelines in diabetic hypertension. DESIGN: Retrospective prescription-based
      survey. SETTING: Seven primary-care health centers, comprising approximately
      one-third of primary-care health centers in Bahrain. PATIENTS: Patients with type
      2 diabetes and hypertension. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The prescribing pattern of
      antihypertensive and antidiabetic drugs. RESULTS: Among a study sample of 1,463
      patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension, antidiabetic agents were
      prescribed as monotherapy in the following descending order: glyburide,
      gliclazide, insulin, and metformin. As combinations, sulfonylureas plus metformin
      was most popular, followed by metformin plus insulin, and sulfonylureas plus
      insulin. Sulfonylurea and metformin with insulin was rarely used. There was no
      significant difference in prescribing of glyburide and metformin between the
      elderly and young middle-aged diabetic patients; many patients older than 65
      years were treated with a beta-blocker along with a long-acting sulfonylurea.
      Both as monotherapy and in overall use, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting
      enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and calcium-channel blockers were most often prescribed.
      Among 35.5% patients treated with antihypertensive combinations, various two- and
      three-drug combinations of beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, calcium-channel
      blockers, and diuretics were often used. The proportion of patients taking
      atenolol 100 mg/d was higher with combination regimens. Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg
      or equivalent thiazide diuretics were extensively used. CONCLUSIONS: The
      prescribing pattern of antihypertensives in diabetic hypertension differs in many
      instances from WHO/ISH guidelines, especially regarding the choice of
      antihypertensive drugs and their combinations. The appropriateness of
      antidiabetic drug choice is questionable in relation to the antihypertensive
      used.

TI  - Medical care from childhood to adulthood in type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 692-707
AB  - Diabetes mellitus comprises a heterogeneous group of diseases that have in common
      the development of macro- and microvascular complications. It is now possible to 
      identify subjects at high risk of Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes, especially in the
      patient's family members. Preventive interventions are quickly becoming
      available, and can help delay the onset of the disease and thereby reduce
      complications in these subjects. Furthermore the correct etiological diagnosis of
      diabetes is fundamental in providing the best treatment for the patient.
      Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) syndrome should be suspected in cases
      of a subtle onset of diabetes and autosomal dominant inheritance. Mitochondrial
      DNA mutations should be considered when a diabetic patient also suffers from
      deafness or if there is a family history of this combination in the mother side
      of the family. Atypical diabetes has to be identified by the physician to avoid
      mistakes when the patient enters the non-insulin-dependent phase. In the case of 
      Wolfram's syndrome a gene analysis for each family member should be performed to 
      identify heterozygote subjects. Recently, many discoveries in genetics help us
      better understand the pathogenesis of the diseases and diagnose the monogenic
      form of diabetes more easily. If all family members are followed in the same
      center, clues from the family history are readily available for differential
      diagnosis and preventive interventions can be established more effectively.

TI  - [Thiazolidinediones--a new class of oral antidiabetics].
PG  - 6106-11
AB  - Two members of the group, thiazolidinediones, have been approved for the
      treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. These novel oral antihyperglycaemic agents
      reduce insulin resistance through binding to and activation of the nuclear
      receptor, PPAR gamma, with subsequent effects on the glucose and lipid
      homoeostasis. The compounds will probably exhibit beneficial effects on other
      facets of the metabolic syndrome. Their effectiveness on glycaemic control
      appears comparable, as assessed by the literature available. HbA1c is lowered by 
      1.0 to 1.5%. Both drugs are approved for combination therapy with either
      metformin or sulphonylureas, not as monotherapy or in combination with insulin.
      Disturbed heart function (NYHA I-IV) is a contra-indication. In contrast to
      troglitazone, there is so far no evidence of liver toxicity. In spite of the
      limited literature, it is anticipated that the present class of oral
      hypoglycaemic agents will turn out to be an important contribution to improving
      the metabolic control of patients with type 2 diabetes, if the safety profile
      remains unchanged in long-term studies.

TI  - Genetic variability of the SUR1 promoter in relation to beta-cell function and
      Type II diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 1330-4
AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: We aimed to examine the promoter of SUR1 for genetic variation
      and to determine if variants were associated with Type II (non-insulin-dependent)
      diabetes mellitus or measures of beta-cell function. METHODS: We examined 465 bp 
      upstream of the ATG site in 46 Type II diabetic patients and 15 glucose tolerant 
      control subjects by SSCP-heteroduplex analysis. RESULTS: We identified an a --> t
      substitution 437 bp upstream of the ATG site. The allelic frequency was similar
      in 455 unrelated Type II diabetic patients and in 203 glucose tolerant control
      subjects matched for age (0.036, [95 % CI 0.019-0.053] vs 0.034 [95 % CI
      0.009-0.059]; p = 0.92). Among the glucose tolerant subjects there were no
      differences between non-carriers (n = 189) and carriers (n = 14) of the variant
      in fasting values or 30 min values of plasma glucose and serum insulin during an 
      oral glucose tolerance test. In a study of 233 glucose tolerant offspring of and 
      spouses to Danish Caucasian Type II diabetic patients, non-carriers (n = 193) and
      carriers (n = 37) of the -437 a/t polymorphism did not differ in glucose or
      tolbutamide stimulated insulin response during an intravenous glucose tolerance
      test with intravenous tolbutamide injection [AUCs-insulin (0-8) min, 2290 +/-
      1660 vs 2308 +/- 1935 pmol/l x min and AUCs-insulin(20-30 min), 3113 +/- 2033 vs.
      3393 +/- 2830 pmol/l x min, respectively]. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: We have
      identified a novel a/t polymorphism of the SUR1 gene promoter which is not
      associated with Type II diabetes mellitus or measures of beta-cell function.
      Previous reported non-functional variants of SUR1 associated with Type II
      diabetes mellitus still need to be accounted for.

TI  - Postchallenge hyperglycemia in a national sample of U.S. adults with type 2
      diabetes.
PG  - 1734-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Postchallenge hyperglycemia (PCH) is known to contribute to suboptimal
      glycemic control in adults with non-insulin-requiring type 2 diabetes. The
      objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of PCH among individuals
      with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional
      analysis of data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
      (1988-1994) in adults aged 40-74 years with diabetes who were not using insulin
      (i.e., they used oral hypoglycemics or received no pharmacological therapy). Each
      respondent underwent a standard 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. PCH was defined
      as a 2-h glucose level >or=200 mg/dl. RESULTS: Overall, PCH was present in 74% of
      those with diagnosed diabetes. Although it was present in virtually all (99%) of 
      the diabetic adults under suboptimal glycemic control (HbA(1c) >or=7.0%), PCH was
      also common (39%) among those under optimal control (HbA(1c) <7.0%). Likewise,
      among sulfonylurea users, PCH was present in 99% of those under suboptimal
      control and in 63% of those under good control. Similar patterns were observed in
      those with undiagnosed diabetes. Isolated PCH (2-h glucose >or=200 mg/dl and
      fasting glucose <126 mg/dl) was present in 9.8% of the adults with diagnosed
      diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that PCH is common among diabetic
      adults in the U.S., even in the setting of "optimal" glycemic control and
      sulfonylurea use. Interventions designed to lower postprandial glucose excursions
      may help improve overall glycemic control in the general population of U.S.
      adults with diabetes.

TI  - A review of rosiglitazone in type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 1082-99
AB  - The thiazolidinedione rosiglitazone maleate works primarily to improve insulin
      sensitivity in muscle and adipose tissue. It may have additional pharmacologic
      effects, however, as its main target is peroxisome proliferator-activated
      receptor-gamma. Data using the homeostasis model assessment and
      proinsulin:insulin ratio in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus suggest that
      rosiglitazone may have the potential to sustain or improve beta-cell function. In
      these patients the drug reduces fasting plasma glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, 
      insulin, and C-peptide. In clinical trials, rosiglitazone monotherapy
      significantly reduced glycosylated hemoglobin by 1.5% compared with placebo and
      led to significant improvements in glycemic control when given in combination
      with metformin, sulfonylureas, or insulin. A dosage of 4 mg twice/day
      significantly reduced fasting plasma glucose levels and produced comparable
      reductions in glycosylated hemoglobin compared with glyburide. Rosiglitazone has 
      a low risk of gastrointestinal side effects and hypoglycemia, reduced insulin
      demand, potential sparing effects on beta-cells, and favorable drug interaction
      profile. Adverse events of clinical significance are edema, anemia, and weight
      gain. Premarketing data indicate no significant difference in liver enzyme
      elevations for rosiglitazone, placebo, or active controls. Another drug in the
      thiazolidinedione class, troglitazone, was associated with idiosyncratic
      hepatotoxicity and was removed from the market. Therefore, until long-term data
      are available for rosiglitazone, liver enzyme monitoring is recommended.

TI  - Intramuscular injection of insulin lispro or soluble human insulin:
      pharmacokinetics and glucodynamics in Type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 562-6
AB  - AIM: The aim of the study was to compare the pharmacokinetics and glucodynamics
      of insulin lispro and soluble human insulin following intramuscular (i.m.)
      injection in patients with Type 2 diabetes with secondary failure of
      sulphonylureas. METHODS: Single 15-U i.m. doses of insulin lispro or soluble
      human insulin were administered to 16 patients in a two-way, randomized,
      crossover design. Glucodynamic and pharmacokinetic parameters were determined
      over 6 h after insulin injection using clamp techniques. RESULTS: Insulin C(max) 
      was significantly higher (971 +/- 217 vs. 659 +/- 141 pmol/l, P < 0.001) and
      T(max) was significantly shorter (46.9 +/- 27 vs. 94.7 +/- 50.1 min, P = 0.002)
      with insulin lispro. Glucose infusion rate (GIR) curves showed clear separation
      20 min after injection and were significantly greater for insulin lispro during
      the 40-60, 60-80 and 80-100-minute time intervals. Total glucose infused was only
      approximately 5% larger with insulin lispro during the 6-h follow-up, due to
      lower insulinaemia at later time points. The glucose R(max) and TR(max) were not 
      statistically different between insulin treatments. CONCLUSION: This study shows 
      that i.m. injection of insulin lispro is followed by its more rapid absorption,
      which results in stronger metabolic effect in the first 2 h when compared with
      soluble human insulin under the same test conditions. Diabet. Med. 18, 562-566

TI  - Endothelial dysfunction and type 2 diabetes. Part 2: altered endothelial function
      and the effects of treatments in type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 436-47
AB  - Coronary artery, cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular disease, are the
      principal causes of morbidity and mortality in type 2 diabetes mellitus. The
      accelerated macrovascular disease in type 2 diabetes mellitus is due partly to
      the increased incidence of cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension,
      obesity and dyslipidemia. Advanced glycation end products, glycoxidised and
      oxidized low-density lipoproteins and reactive oxygen species linked to
      hyperglycemia have all been identified in type 2 diabetes mellitus and could
      accelerate macroangiopathy. Hence, the resistance to insulin is an additional
      independent risk factor, in association with oxidant stress, dyslipidemias, and
      prothrombic/hypofibrinolytic states. The endothelium is a major organ involved by
      cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypercholesterolemia, hypertension,
      inflammation, ageing, postmenopausal status, and smoking. Changes in endothelium 
      function may lead to the coronary artery circulation being unable to cope with
      the increased metabolism of myocardial muscle independently of a reduced coronary
      artery diameter. The way endothelial function is altered in diabetic patients is 
      not yet fully understood, but the loss of normal endothelial function could be
      involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic angiopathy, as endothelial dysfunction
      is associated with diabetic microangiopathy and macroangiopathy. Finally, recent 
      reports indicate that an improved metabolic control in diabetic patients,
      whatever the treatment used, is associated with near normalization or restoration
      of normal endothelial function.

PG  - 381-8
AB  - United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) has demonstrated definitively
      that patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) benefit from intensive blood
      glucose control, because it diminishes the risk to develop microvascular
      complications. The therapeutic targets in the type 2 DM have been modified in
      order to reduce the risk of these complications. However, aggressive treatment
      may be disastrous for patients with microvascular complications and/or an
      increased risk of hypoglycemic unawareness, and neither it would be advised in
      older patients or with short life expectancy. The available drugs for treatment
      of type 2 DM offer many options for achieving these therapeutic targets, based on
      the need of the individual patient. In this job we review the targets in the
      metabolic control of type 2 DM and their backgrounds, and we describe briefly the
      therapeutic strategy recommended for reaching these targets, with special
      attention to the new oral antidiabetic agents (repaglinide and
      thiazolidinediones).

TI  - Effects of improved glycaemic control on endothelial function in patients with
      type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 322-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with type 2 diabetes have abnormal endothelial function but 
      it is not certain whether improvements in glycaemic control will improve
      endothelial function. AIMS: To examine the effects of short-term improved
      glycaemic control on endothelial function in patients with inadequately regulated
      type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: Forty-three patients with type 2 diabetes and 
      glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) > 8.9% were randomized to either improved
      glycaemic control (IC) n = 21 or usual glycaemic control (UC) n = 22 for 20
      weeks. Using high-resolution B-mode ultrasound, brachial artery flow-mediated
      dilatation (FMD) and glyceryl trinitrate-mediated dilatation (GTN-D) were
      measured at baseline and 20 weeks later. RESULTS: After 20 weeks, HbA1c was
      significantly lower in IC versus UC (IC 8.02 +/- 0.25% versus UC 10.23 +/- 0.23%,
      P < 0.0001) but changes in FMD and GTN-D were not different between the groups
      (FMD at baseline and week 20 IC 5.1 +/- 0.56% versus 4.9 +/- 0.56% and UC 4.2 +/-
      0.51% versus 3.1 +/- 0.51%; P = 0.23: GTN-D IC 12.8 +/- 1.34% versus 10.4 +/-
      1.32% and UC 13.7 +/- 1.2% versus 12.7 +/- 1.23%; P = 0.39). In the IC group
      weight increased by 3.2 +/- 0.8 kg after 20 weeks compared to 0.02 +/- 0.70 kg in
      UC (P = 0.003). Blood pressure and serum lipid concentrations did not change in
      either group. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term reduction of HbA1c levels did not appear to
      affect endothelial function in patients with type 2 diabetes and previously
      poorly regulated glycaemic control.

TI  - [Repaglinide, potentially a therapeutic improvement for diabetes mellitus type
      2].
PG  - 1547-50
AB  - In about 25% of type 2 diabetes patients, good diabetes control is not attainable
      with oral blood-glucose lowering drugs. Furthermore, in many people with diabetes
      the disease deteriorates, despite the use of blood-glucose lowering medication,
      due to the decline of the pancreatic beta cells. The development of new drugs,
      such as repaglinide, is therefore important. Repaglinide is an insulin secretion 
      enhancer with a different mechanism of action to the sulphonylureas, which means 
      it does not continuously stimulate insulin secretion. The tablets should be taken
      with each meal. After oral ingestion repaglinide is resorbed quickly, with a
      half-life of between 30 minutes to an hour. In clinical trials repaglinide has
      been found to be equally effective as glibenclamide. Repaglinide has been found
      to be particularly effective in sulphonylurea-naive patients. Skipping the meal
      plus tablet combination results in less frequent hypoglycaemic symptoms compared 
      to glibenclamide. Repaglinide results in greater reductions in postprandial
      glucose levels than glibenclamide. It does not affect insulin resistance.
      Long-term data are lacking, both with regard to efficacy and side effects.
      Repaglinide deserves a place in the diabetes treatment of newly-diagnosed type 2 
      diabetes patients who are well-informed about their disease, as well as in
      patients with renal failure. It should also be considered for patients whose
      diabetes is poorly controlled on metformin monotherapy.

TI  - Differences in pharmacotherapy and in glucose control of type 2 diabetes patients
      in two neighbouring towns: a longitudinal population-based study.
PG  - 249-53
AB  - AIM: To compare prescribing, dosage and blood glucose levels in patients with
      type 2 diabetes in two communities with differences in anti-hyperglycaemic drug
      utilization. METHODS: A retrospective longitudinal (1984-1994) population-based
      study in two neighbour towns in southern Sweden. The mean prescribed daily dose
      was expressed as a fraction of the Defined Daily Dose (DDD) for each drug.
      RESULTS: In town A, prescribing of oral agents and insulin was predominantly made
      by one specialized diabetes clinician, while in town B it was spread among
      several different general practitioners and one specialist. Altogether 44 636
      medical visits by 2348 patients were identified. In each town, about 40% of the
      patients were treated without anti-hyperglycaemic drugs, about 40% with oral
      agents and about 20% with insulin. However, there were pronounced between-town
      differences in dosage and glucose control. The mean prescribed daily dose of
      sulphonylurea monotherapy decreased gradually from approximately 0.7 to
      approximately 0.5 DDD in town B but remained approximately 0.8 DDD in town A. The
      proportion of patients on both sulphonylurea and metformin increased
      substantially in town A but not in town B. In these patients, the mean prescribed
      daily dose of sulphonylurea exceeded 1.0 DDD in both towns, although it decreased
      with time in town B. The mean prescribed daily dose of insulin increased from
      1.05 to 1.2 DDD in town A but remained virtually unchanged at 0.95 DDD in town B.
      The mean fasting blood glucose was lower in town A than in town B both overall
      (7.7 vs. 8.8 mmol/l), in those treated without any anti-hyperglycaemic drugs (7.2
      vs. 8.1 mmol/l), in those on sulphonylurea monotherapy (8.3 vs. 9.7 mmol/l) and
      in those treated with insulin (8.1 vs. 10.2 mmol/l). CONCLUSIONS: Glucose control
      in routine care was better when most patients were treated by a diabetes
      specialist and were exposed to more intense pharmacotherapy.

PG  - 456-9
AB  - Repaglinide (NovoNorm) is an antidiabetic oral agent of the new glinide class
      with insulinotropic activity. Its action on insulin secretion is more rapid and
      shorter than that of sulphonylurea compounds. Thanks to these properties,
      repaglinide is able to better control postprandial hyperglycaemia and is
      associated with a lower risk of delayed hypoglycaemic episodes. It is indicated
      for the treatment of type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus as
      monotherapy, after diet failure, or in combination with metformin, when the
      biguanide is insufficient. NovoNorm is commercialized as tablets of 0.5, 1 and 2 
      mg, to be taken just before each meal. Initial dosis should be 0.5 mg before meal
      in diabetic patients on diet alone or 1 mg before meal in patients already
      receiving an hypoglycaemic agent. If necessary, the dosis should be progressively
      increased, depending on the individual response, up to 4 mg before meal (maximal 
      daily dosage of 16 mg), in order to optimize blood glucose control.

PG  - 2434-40
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetes results from reduced beta-cell
      function and insulin resistance. The treatment of type 2 diabetes must be
      targeted against both conditions to reduce symptoms of hyperglycaemia and the
      risk of diabetic late complications. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this review we
      cover the recent scientific documentation from long term studies on treatment
      effects. We also discuss the different treatments available. RESULTS: Recent
      clinical trials have shown that lowering blood glucose levels over time
      significantly reduces development of microvascular complications in type 2
      diabetes. There are several treatment options available which make adequate blood
      glucose control possible in patients with type 2 diabetes. INTERPRETATION: A
      reduction in the development of microvascular complications in type 2 diabetes is
      an achievable goal.

TI  - Alpha-lipoic acid: a multifunctional antioxidant that improves insulin
      sensitivity in patients with type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 401-13
AB  - Alpha-Lipoic acid (LA) is a disulfide compound that is produced in small
      quantities in cells, and functions naturally as a co-enzyme in the pyruvate
      dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase mitochondrial enzyme
      complexes. In pharmacological doses, LA is a multifunctional antioxidant. LA has 
      been used in Germany for over 30 years for the treatment of diabetes-induced
      neuropathy. In patients with type 2 diabetes, recent studies have reported that
      intravenous (i.v.) infusion of LA increases insulin-mediated glucose disposal,
      whereas oral administration of LA has only marginal effects. If the limitations
      of oral therapy can be overcome, LA could emerge as a safe and effective
      adjunctive antidiabetic agent with insulin sensitizing activity.

TI  - Oral antidiabetic treatment in patients with coronary disease: time-related
      increased mortality on combined glyburide/metformin therapy over a 7.7-year
      follow-up.
PG  - 151-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: A sulfonylurea--usually glyburide--plus metformin constitute the most
      widely used oral antihyperglycemic combination in clinical practice. Both
      medications present undesirable cardiovascular effects. The issue whether the
      adverse effects of each of these pharmacologic agents may be additive and
      detrimental to the prognosis for coronary patients has not yet been specifically 
      addressed. HYPOTHESIS: This study was designed to examine the survival in type 2 
      diabetics with proven coronary artery disease (CAD) receiving a combined
      glyburide/metformin antihyperglycemic treatment over a long-term follow-up
      period. METHODS: The study sample comprised 2,275 diabetic patients, aged 45-74
      years, with proven CAD, who were screened but not included in the bezafibrate
      infarction prevention study. In addition, 9,047 nondiabetic patients with CAD
      represented a reference group. Diabetics were divided into four groups on the
      basis of their therapeutic regimen: diet alone (n = 990), glyburide (n = 953),
      metformin (n = 79), and a combination of the latter two (n = 253). RESULTS: The
      diabetic groups presented similar clinical characteristics upon recruitment.
      Crude mortality rate after a 7.7-year follow-up was lower in nondiabetics (14 vs.
      31.6%, p<0.001). Among diabetics, 720 patients died: 260 on diet (mortality
      26.3%), 324 on glyburide (34%), 25 on metformin alone (31.6%), and 111 patients
      (43.9%) on combined treatment (p<0.000001). Time-related mortality was almost
      equal for patients on metformin and on combined therapy over an intermediate
      follow-up period of 4 years (survival rates 0.80 and 0.79, respectively). The
      group on combined treatment presented the worst prognosis over the long-term
      follow-up, with a time-related survival rate of 0.59 after 7 years, versus 0.68
      and 0.70 for glyburide and metformin, respectively. After adjustment to variables
      for prognosis, the use of the combined treatment was associated with an increased
      hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality of 1.53 (95% confidence interval [CI]
      1.20-1.96), whereas glyburide and metformin alone yielded HR 1.22 (95% CI
      1.02-1.45) and HR 1.26 (95% CI 0.81-1.96), respectively. Conclusions: We conclude
      that after a 7.7-year follow-up, monotherapy with either glyburide or metformin
      in diabetic patients with CAD yielded a similar outcome and was associated with a
      modest increase in mortality. However, time-related mortality was markedly
      increased when a combined glyburide/metformin treatment was used.

TI  - Mechanisms of acute and chronic hypoglycemic action of gliclazide.
PG  - 201-6
AB  - An extrapancreatic effect of sulfonylureas has been postulated. However, in vivo 
      results have been disputed because the amelioration of insulin action that
      follows sulfonylurea may represent the relief from glucose toxicity rather than a
      direct effect of the drug. Therefore, we studied the hypoglycemic action of
      gliclazide acutely and after 2 months of therapy in seven type 2 diabetic
      patients. All patients received a 240-minute i.v. glucose infusion with
      [3-3H]glucose. In a random order, 160 mg gliclazide (study 1) or placebo (study
      2) was given orally before glucose infusion. Finally, the effect of 160 mg
      gliclazide was reassessed after a two-month treatment with the same sulfonylurea 
      (80 mg t.i.d.). Basal plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide and endogenous glucose
      production (EGP) were similar before the two initial studies. During glucose
      infusion, EGP was more suppressed after gliclazide in spite of comparable
      increase in plasma insulin and C-peptide. After the two-month therapy, basal
      plasma glucose levels and HbA1c were lower while plasma insulin and C-peptide
      were higher with respect to baseline (p < 0.05). Gliclazide further reduced
      plasma glucose, the incremental area above baseline, and EGP during glucose
      infusion, while plasma insulin and C-peptide achieved higher plateaus (p < 0.05).
      When data were pooled, plasma glucose concentration and EGP correlated both in
      the basal state (r = 0.71) and during the last hour of glucose infusion (r =
      0.84; both p < 0.05). These data suggest that gliclazide enhances the suppression
      of EGP induced by insulin and that this effect is greater with chronic treatment 
      because of concomitant improvement of insulin secretion.

TI  - Pioglitazone hydrochloride in combination with sulfonylurea therapy improves
      glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a randomized,
      placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 10-7
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of pioglitazone in combination
      with a sulfonylurea in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. SUBJECTS AND
      METHODS: This 16-week, double-blind study included patients on a stable regimen
      of a sulfonylurea for > or = 30 days and with a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C)
      level > or = 8.0%. Patients were randomly assigned to receive once daily
      pioglitazone 15 mg (n = 184), pioglitazone 30 mg (n = 189), or placebo plus
      sulfonylurea (n = 187). RESULTS: Patients receiving pioglitazone + sulfonylurea
      had significant (P < 0.05) decreases from baseline in HbA1C and fasting plasma
      glucose levels compared with patients treated with placebo + sulfonylurea. As
      compared with placebo, HbA1C decreased by 0.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]:
      0.06% to 1.2%) with pioglitazone 15 mg and 1.3% (CI: 1% to 1.6%) with 30 mg
      pioglitazone; fasting plasma glucose levels decreased by 39 mg/dL (95% CI: 27 to 
      52 mg/dL) with pioglitazone 15 mg and by 58 mg/dL (95% CI: 46-70 mg/dL) with 30
      mg pioglitazone. Both pioglitazone + sulfonylurea groups had significant (P <
      0.05) mean percent decreases in triglyceride levels (17%, 95% CI: 6% to 27% for
      15 mg; 26%, 95% CI: 16% to 36% for 30 mg) and increases in high-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol levels (6%, 95% CI: 1% to 11% for 15 mg; 13%, CI: 8% to
      18% for 30 mg) compared with placebo + sulfonylurea. There were small but
      statistically significant mean percent increases in low-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol levels in all groups. Pioglitazone was well tolerated, and the rates 
      of adverse events were similar in all groups. CONCLUSION: In patients with type 2
      diabetes, pioglitazone plus sulfonylurea significantly improves HbA1C and fasting
      plasma glucose levels with beneficial effects on serum triglyceride and
      HDL-cholesterol levels.

TI  - Lessons from the glitazones: a story of drug development.
PG  - 1870-5
AB  - Troglitazone, the first in the thiazolidinedione class of oral hypoglycaemic
      agents, was launched in the USA in March, 1997. It reached Europe later that
      year, only to be withdrawn within weeks on the grounds of liver toxicity.
      Meanwhile it went on to generate sales of over $2 billion in the USA, and caused 
      at least 90 cases of liver failure (70 resulting in death or transplantation)
      before it was withdrawn in March, 2000. Rosiglitazone and pioglitazone reached
      the US market in 1999 as first-line agents to be used alone or in combination
      with other drugs, but in Europe the same dossiers were used one year later to
      apply for a limited licence as second-line agents restricted to oral combination 
      therapy. How should we use the glitazones? And how did they achieve blockbuster
      status without any clear evidence of advantage over existing therapy?

TI  - The effect of 3-month ingestion of Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb 761) on pancreatic 
      beta-cell function in response to glucose loading in individuals with
      non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 600-11
AB  - In the first report (Journal of Clinical Pharmacology 2000; 40:647-654), it was
      shown that ingestion of 120 mg of Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb 761) daily for 3
      months by normal glucose-tolerant individuals caused a significant increase in
      pancreatic beta-cell insulin and C-peptide response, measured as the area under
      the curve (AUC0-->120) during a 2-hour standard (75 g) oral glucose tolerance
      test (OGTT). This follow-up study was designed to determine the effect of the
      same Ginkgo biloba treatment on glucose-stimulated pancreatic beta-cell function 
      in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) subjects. In diet-controlled
      subjects (fasting plasma glucose [FPG], 117 +/- 16 mg/dl; fasting plasma insulin 
      [FPI], 29 +/- 8 microU/ml; n = 6), ingestion of Ginkgo biloba produced no
      significant effect on the insulin AUC0-->120 (193 +/- 53 vs. 182 +/- 58
      microU/ml/h, before and after ingesting Ginkgo biloba, respectively). In
      hyperinsulinemic NIDDM subjects taking oral hypoglycemic medications (n = 6) (FPG
      143 +/- 48 mg/dl; FPI 46 +/- 13 microU/ml), ingestion of Ginkgo biloba caused
      blunted plasma insulin levels from 30 to 120 minutes during the OGTT, leading to 
      a reduction of the insulin AUC0-->120 (199 +/- 33 vs. 147 +/- 58 microU/ml/h,
      before and after Ginkgo biloba, respectively). The C-peptide levels increased,
      and so the AUC0-->120 did not parallel the insulin AUC0-->120, creating a
      dissimilar insulin/C-peptide ratio indicative of an enhanced hepatic extraction
      of insulin relative to C-peptide. Thus, in pancreatic beta-cells that are already
      maximally stimulated, ingestion of Ginkgo biloba may cause a reduction in plasma 
      insulin levels. Only in NIDDM subjects with pancreatic exhaustion (FPG 152 +/- 46
      mg/dl; FPI 16 +/- 8 microU/ml; n = 8), who also took oral hypoglycemic agents,
      did Ginkgo biloba ingestion significantly increase pancreatic beta-cell function 
      in response to glucose loading (insulin AUC0-->120 increased from 51 +/- 29 to 98
      +/- 20 microU/ml/h, p < 0.0001), paralleled by a C-peptide AUC0-->120 increase
      from 7.2 +/- 2.8 to 13.7 +/- 6.8 (p < 0.0001). Whether this increase is due to
      "resuscitation" of previously exhausted islets or increased activity of only the 
      remaining functional islets is unclear. However, not even in this group did
      increased pancreatic beta-cell activity cause a reduction of blood glucose during
      the OGTT. It is concluded that ingestion of Ginkgo biloba extract by an NIDDM
      subject may increase the hepatic metabolic clearance rate of not only insulin but
      also the hypoglycemic agents. The result is reduced insulin-mediated glucose
      metabolism and elevated blood glucose.

TI  - The effects of inorganic chromium and brewer's yeast supplementation on glucose
      tolerance, serum lipids and drug dosage in individuals with type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 831-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of supplementation with organic and inorganic
      chromium on glucose tolerance, serum lipids, and drug dosage in type 2 diabetes
      patients, in the hope of finding a better and more economical method of control. 
      METHODS: Seventy eight type 2 diabetes patients were divided randomly into two
      groups and given Brewer's yeast (23.3ug Cr/day), and CrCl3 (200ug Cr/day)
      sequentially with placebo in between, in a double blind cross-over design of four
      stages, each lasting 8 weeks. At the beginning and end of each stage, subjects
      were weighed, their dietary data and drug dosage recorded, and blood and urine
      samples were collected for analysis of glucose (fasting and 2 hour post 75g
      glucose load) fructosamine, triglycerides, total and HDL-cholesterol, and serum
      and urinary chromium. RESULTS: Both supplements caused a significant decrease in 
      the means of glucose (fasting and 2 hour post glucose load), fructosamine and
      triglycerides. The means of HDL-cholesterol, and serum and urinary chromium were 
      all increased. The mean drug dosage decreased slightly (and significantly in case
      of Glibenclamide) after both supplements and some patients no longer required
      insulin. No change was noted in dietary intakes or Body Mass Index. A higher
      percentage of subjects responded positively to Brewer's yeast chromium, which was
      retained more by the body, with effects on fructosamine, triglycerides, and
      HDL-cholesterol maintained in some subjects when placebo followed it, and mean
      urinary chromium remaining significantly higher than zero time mean. CONCLUSION: 
      Chromium supplementation gives better control of glucose and lipid variables
      while decreasing drug dosage in type 2 diabetes patients. A larger scale study is
      needed to help decide on the convenient chemical form, and dosage required to
      achieve optimal response.

TI  - 24-hour glycemic profile in type 2 diabetic patients treated with gliclazide
      modified release once daily.
PG  - 133-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In type 2 diabetes, the primary and secondary prevention of long-term
      micro- and macrovascular complications requires a control of blood glucose levels
      24 hours a day. The present study was undertaken to assess the effect of a new
      formulation of gliclazide administered once daily, gliclazide modified release,
      on plasma glucose levels over 24 hours. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 21 type 2
      diabetic patients previously treated by diet alone or oral antidiabetic agents,
      glycemic profile (8 am, 10 am, 12 am, 2 pm, 5 pm, 8 pm, 10 pm, 3 am and 8 am),
      overall glycemic control, acceptability, and compliance with treatment were
      assessed before and after a 10-week treatment with gliclazide modified release,
      (30-60 mg), given once daily at breakfast. RESULTS: The results indicate a
      significant decrease in plasma glucose levels at all points of the cycle. Mean
      plasma glucose levels over 24 hours and mean plasma glucose levels during the
      fasting and the postprandial periods were significantly improved after treatment.
      In previous drug-naive patients, decrease in HbA1C was observed (1.0 +/- 1.1%,
      P=0.022). The acceptability was good, with no hypoglycemic events, and a high
      compliance with treatment was also observed. CONCLUSION: We can therefore
      conclude that gliclazide modified release, given once daily at breakfast, is
      effective over 24 hours in reducing plasma glucose levels in type 2 diabetes.
      This once-daily administration should lead to an optimal patient compliance with 
      treatment.

TI  - Clinical review of glimepiride.
PG  - 699-713
AB  - This article reviews the pharmacological and clinical aspects of glimepiride, the
      latest second-generation sulfonylurea for treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus
      (DM). Glimepiride therapy ameliorates the relative insulin secretory deficit
      found in most patients with Type 2 DM. It is a direct insulin secretagogue;
      indirectly, it also increases insulin secretion in response to fuels such as
      glucose. Its action to augment insulin secretion requires binding to a high
      affinity sulfonylurea receptor, which results in closure of ATP-sensitive
      potassium channels in the beta-cells of the pancreas. The question has been
      raised whether insulin secretagogues by acting on vascular or myocardial
      potassium channels may prevent ischaemic preconditioning, a physiological
      adaptation that could affect the outcome of coronary heart disease, but there is 
      evidence against this concern being applicable to glimepiride. Glimepiride's
      antihyperglycaemic efficacy is equal to other secretagogues. It has
      pharmacokinetic properties that make it less prone to cause hypoglycaemia in
      renal dysfunction than some other insulin secretagogues, particularly glyburide
      (also known as glibenclamide in Europe). Its convenient once daily dosing may
      enhance compliance for diabetic patients who often also require medications for
      other co-morbid conditions, such as hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and cardiac
      disease. Glimepiride is approved for monotherapy, for combination with metformin 
      and with insulin. Clinically, its reduced risk of hypoglycaemia makes it
      preferable to some other insulin secretagogues when attempting to achieve
      recommended glycaemic control (haemoglobin A(1c) (HgbA(1c)) 7%). Using suppertime
      neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) and regular insulin with morning glimepiride in 
      overweight diabetic patients achieves glycaemic goals more quickly than insulin
      alone and with lower insulin doses.

TI  - Sulfonylurea treatment of type 2 diabetic patients does not reduce the
      vasodilator response to ischemia.
PG  - 738-42
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sulfonylureas block the activation of vascular potassium-dependent ATP
      channels and impair the vasodilating response to ischcmia in nondiabetic
      individuals, but it is not know whether this occurs in type 2 diabetic patients
      under chronic treatment with these drugs. Glimepiride, a new sulfonylurea,
      apparently has no cardiovascular interactions. The aim of our study was to
      compare the effect of the widely used compound glibenclamide, the
      pancreas-specific glimepiride, and diet treatment alone on brachial artery
      response to acute forearm ischemia. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Brachial artery 
      examination was performed by a high-resolution ultrasound technique on 20 type 2 
      diabetic patients aged mean +/- SD) 67 +/- 2 years and on 18 nondiabetic patients
      matched for age, hypertension, and dislipidemia. Diabetic subjects underwent
      three separate evaluations at the end of each 8-week treatment period, during
      which they received glibenclamide, glimepiride, or diet alone according to
      crossover design. Scans were obtained before and after 4.5 min of forearm
      ischemia. Postischemic vasodilation and hyperemia were expressed as percent
      variations in vessel diameter and blood flow. RESULTS: Postischemic vasodilation 
      and hyperemia were, respectively, 5.42 +/- 0.90 and 331 +/- 38% during
      glibenclamide, 5.46 +/- 0.69 and 326 +/- 28% during glimepiride, and 5.17 +/-
      0.64 and 357 +/- 35% during diet treatment (NS). These results were similar to
      those found in the nondiabetic patients (6.44 +/- 0.68 and 406 +/- 42%, NS).
      CONCLUSIONS: In type 2 diabetic patients, the vasodilating response to forearm
      ischemia was the same whether patients were treated with diet treatment alone or 
      with glibenclamide or glimepiride at blood glucose-lowering equipotent closes.

PG  - 1107-15
AB  - This study investigated the effects of oral combined hormone replacement therapy 
      (OCHRT) on lipid concentrations and subpopulation distribution of lipoproteins in
      nine postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes mellitus and moderate glycemic
      control. After 16 weeks of continuous daily therapy of conjugated estrogens 0.625
      mg and medroxyprogesterone 2.5 mg, the mean concentration of high-density
      lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol showed a statistically significant increase of
      16.7%, predominantly in the HDL2 subfraction. No statistically significant
      changes in mean concentrations of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein
      (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)
      triglycerides, apolipoprotein A1, or apolipoprotein B were evident. Likewise, no 
      changes were found in the average diameter of VLDL, LDL, or HDL particles;
      triglyceride concentrations of VLDL subfractions; cholesterol concentrations of
      LDL subfractions; or chemical composition of plasma LDL. These findings lend
      further support to the use of OCHRT in postmenopausal women with diabetes to
      decrease their risk for coronary artery disease.

      followed from diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. Oxford Regional Prospective Study
      Group.
PG  - 555-60
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine whether a rise in blood pressure could be detected before
      the onset of microalbuminuria (MA) in a cohort of children followed from
      diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Oxford Regional
      Prospective Study is an incident cohort study of children with type 1 diabetes
      aged (mean +/- SD) 9.8 +/- 3.7 years at diagnosis. Subjects were assessed
      annually from diagnosis, with measurement of HbA1c, arterial blood pressure
      (random zero), and three urine samples for estimation of the albumin/creatinine
      ratio. During follow-up, 63 of 494 children developed MA at one or more annual
      assessments and were designated as cases for a nested case-control study. Each
      case was matched for sex and age at diagnosis with two normoalbuminuric control
      subjects. Blood pressure (BP) data were compared at corresponding years of
      diabetes duration. RESULTS: Cases with MA were similar to normoalbuminuric
      control subjects with respect to age and BMI, but they had higher mean HbA1c
      levels (mean difference 1.1%, P < 0.001). In the years before the onset of MA,
      the diastolic BP standard deviation score (SDS) was significantly higher than
      zero in cases (mean 0.49, P < 0.001) and in control subjects (0.50, P < 0.001).
      No difference could be detected between cases and control subjects before the
      onset of MA in either systolic or diastolic BP (mean difference systolic -1.2
      mmHg [95% CI -4.7 to 2.7], mean difference diastolic 0.1 mmHg [-2.4 to 2.6]).
      However, within the cases, the onset of MA was associated with elevations in
      systolic and diastolic BP SDSs (F = 16.1, P < 0.001; and F = 18.0, P < 0.001).
      BMI, but not HbA1c, was associated with systolic and diastolic BP SDSs in the
      subjects with MA (F = 0.6, P = 0.4; and F = 12.3, P = 0.001). However, the
      association of BP with MA remained signifcant for systolic BP (P = 0.001) and for
      diastolic BP (P < 0.001) after adjusting for BMI. CONCLUSIONS: A rise in systemic
      BP cannot be detected before the first appearance of MA in children with type 1
      diabetes. BP rises concurrently with the onset of MA and is also closely related 
      to BMI.

TI  - Role of common sequence variants in insulin secretion in familial type 2 diabetic
      kindreds: the sulfonylurea receptor, glucokinase, and hepatocyte nuclear factor
      1alpha genes.
PG  - 472-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We have demonstrated high heritability of insulin secretion measured
      as acute insulin response to glucose times insulin sensitivity (disposition
      index). Furthermore, we showed that obese normoglycemic family members of a type 
      2 diabetic proband failed to compensate for the insulin resistance of obesity by 
      increasing insulin secretion. In this study, we tested the primary hypotheses
      that previously described variants in the pancreatic sulfonylurea receptor gene
      (SUR1 or ABCC8), glucokinase (GCK) gene, or hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha
      (TCF1 or HNF1alpha) gene contribute to the inherited deficiencies of insulin
      secretion and beta-cell compensation to insulin resistance, as well as the
      secondary hypotheses that these variants altered insulin sensitivity. RESEARCH
      DESIGN AND METHODS: We typed 124 nondiabetic members of 26 familial type 2
      diabetic kindreds who had undergone tolbutamide-modified intravenous glucose
      tolerance tests for two variants of the ABCC8 (sulfonylurea) gene, two variants
      of the GCK gene, and one common amino acid variant in the TCF1 (HNF1alpha) gene. 
      All family members were classified as normal or having impaired glucose tolerance
      based on oral glucose tolerance testing. We used minimal model analysis to
      calculate the insulin sensitivity index (S1) and glucose effectiveness (SG), and 
      acute insulin response to glucose was calculated as the mean insulin excursion
      above baseline during the first 10 min after the glucose bolus. Disposition index
      (DI), a measure of beta-cell compensation for insulin sensitivity, was calculated
      as insulin sensitivity times acute insulin response. Effects of polymorphisms
      were determined using mixed effects models that incorporated family membership
      and by a likelihood analysis that accounted for family structure through
      polygenic inheritance. RESULTS: An intronic variant of the ABCC8 gene just
      upstream of exon 16 was a significant determinant of both DI and an analogous
      index based on acute insulin response to tolbutamide. Surprisingly, heterozygous 
      individuals showed the lowest indexes, whereas the DI in the two homozygous
      states did not differ significantly. Neither the exon 18 variant nor the variants
      in the GCK and TCF1 genes were significant in this model. However, combined
      genotypes of ABCC8 exon 16 and 18 variants again significantly predicted both
      indexes of glucose and tolbutamide-stimulated insulin secretion. Unexpectedly, a 
      variant in the 3' untranslated region of the GCK gene interacted significantly
      with BMI to predict insulin sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: The exon 16 variant of the 
      ABCC8 gene reduced beta-cell compensation to the decreased insulin sensitivity in
      the heterozygous state. This may explain the observation from several groups of
      an association of the ABCC8 variants in diabetes and is consistent with other
      studies showing a role of ABCC8 variants in pancreatic beta-cell function.
      However, our study focused on individuals from relatively few families.
      Ascertainment bias, family structure, and other interacting genes might have
      influenced our unexpected result. Additional studies are needed to replicate our 
      observed deficit in beta-cell compensation in individuals heterozygous for ABCC8 
      variants. Likewise, the role of the GCK 3' variant in the reduced insulin
      sensitivity of obesity will require further study.

TI  - Serum insulin assay: an important therapeutic tool in management of freshly
      diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 815-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The study was performed to see that, whether metabolic control and
      response to treatment in freshly diagnosed patients of type 2 diabetes mellitus
      is affected by primary pathology (hyperinsulinemia/inappropriate insulin
      secretion). METHODS: One hundred and eight freshly diagnosed patients of type 2
      diabetes mellitus with age range from 30-65 years were followed for a period of
      three months. The blood glucose, serum triglyceride, and serum insulin levels
      were determined in each patient. Patients were found to have either higher or
      normal to low serum insulin values at fasting, and accordingly patients were
      distributed into two groups; group one (normal to low initial fasting serum
      insulin level i.e. < or = 30 microU/ml) and group two (high fasting serum insulin
      level i.e. > or = 30 microU/ml). Each group was further divided into two
      subgroups A and B. Subgroup A was treated with glipizide and B with metformin.
      RESULTS: Diabetic patients who had fasting hyperinsulinemia (n = 53, 100%) had
      blood pressure > or = 140/90 at the time of presentation. Patients who had
      fasting serum insulin within normal range only 30% (n = 17) had hypertension.
      Patients of group one had good recovery from hyperglycemia and reduction in
      triglyceride values when treated with sulphonylurea (subgroup A) as compared to
      patients treated with biguanide (subgroup B). On the contrary patients of group
      two showed poor glycemic control, increase in blood pressure and rise in serum
      triglyceride titre when treated with sulphonylurea (subgroup A) while in the same
      group biguanide effectively produced euglycemia with normalization of blood
      pressure and decrease in triglyceride levels (subgroup B). CONCLUSION: Assessment
      of initial serum insulin levels is helpful guide to decide about the type of oral
      hypoglycemic agent to be used in freshly diagnosed patients to type 2 diabetes
      mellitus.

TI  - The short-term effect of a switch from glibenclamide to metformin on blood
      pressure and microalbuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 571-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Renal hyperfiltration and albuminuria have a deleterious effect on
      kidney function. Therefore, we studied the effect of metformin on blood pressure,
      renal hemodynamics, and microalbuminuria in type 2 diabetic patients. METHODS: A 
      clinical trial was designed in type 2 diabetic patients with incipient
      nephropathy. All patients were below the age of 65, normotensive, and without
      evidence of malignant, hepatic, or cardiovascular disorders. They were randomly
      allocated to receive glibenclamide or metformin. At baseline and 12 weeks
      thereafter we measured body mass index (BMI), serum insulin, blood glucose, lipid
      profile, glycosylated hemoglobin, blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate,
      renal plasma flow, and urine albumin. RESULTS: We studied 23 patients in the
      glibenclamide group and 28 in the metformin group. There was no difference in
      baseline variables between the groups. Metabolic control was obtained in both
      groups. In the metformin group, all the following variables decreased:
      microalbuminuria was reduced by a mean of 24.2 mg/day (p = 0.008); systolic and
      diastolic blood pressure by a mean of 5.3 mmHg (p = 0.002) and 3.93 mmHg (p =
      0.009), respectively; insulin levels by an average of 11.8 microIU/mL (p =
      0.001), and total cholesterol levels and triglycerides by an average of 0.45 and 
      0.18 mmol/L, respectively. Insulin resistance measured by the homeostasis model
      decreased more in the metformin group than in the glibenclamide group. Patients
      treated with glibenclamide had an increase in HDL cholesterol of 0.082 mmol/L (p 
      = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Metformin significantly decreased the urine albumin
      excretion rate with none of the expected changes in renal hemodynamics, probably 
      due to its favorable effects on blood pressure, lipid profile, metabolic control,
      and insulin resistance.

TI  - Effects of antihyperglycaemic therapies on proinsulin and relation between
      proinsulin and cardiovascular risk factors in type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 227-32
AB  - AIM: To assess the effect of oral antihyperglycaemic therapy on fasting
      proinsulin and the relation between proinsulin levels and cardiovascular risk
      factors in type 2 diabetes. METHODS: One hundred and sixty-five patients with
      type 2 diabetes, fasting blood glucose concentration (FBG) > or = 6.7 mmol/l,
      were recruited from five diabetes outpatient clinics in primary health care. Diet
      and antihyperglycaemic medication, aiming at FBG < 6.7 mmol/l, was maintained for
      6 months after completed dose titration in a randomized, double-blind,
      double-dummy trial with metformin (M), glibenclamide (G) and primary combination 
      of both drugs (MG). The study compared M, G and MG in low dose (MGL) and also
      different high-dose regimens, i.e. G added to M (M/G), M added to G (G/M) and
      primary combination (MGH). Outcome measures were fasting proinsulin, glycaemia,
      body mass index, blood pressure, lipids, insulin and C-peptide. RESULTS: Lower
      proinsulin levels were found when therapy was initiated with metformin (M vs. G, 
      p = 0.013 and M/G vs. G/M, p = 0.033). M and G were equally effective on glucose 
      levels. In the group as a whole FBG decreased from (mean +/- s.d.) 10.2 +/- 2.7
      to 7.0 +/- 1.2 mmol/l with no change in proinsulin. Proinsulin was associated
      with cardiovascular risk factors, linking high proinsulin to an atherogenic risk 
      marker profile. Mean proinsulin change from baseline was inconsistently
      associated with markers of insulin resistance. Meal-stimulated glucose (net AUC) 
      decreased after treatment only in those with low baseline proinsulin levels.
      CONCLUSION: It may be advantageous to initiate oral antihyperglycaemic therapy
      with metformin rather than with sulphonylurea. High proinsulin levels are
      associated with an atherogenic-risk marker profile and an impaired therapeutic
      postprandial glucose response after treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes.
      Proinsulin change after therapy is inconsistently associated with markers of
      insulin resistance and unrelated to fasting blood glucose reduction.

TI  - Leptin concentrations are related to glycaemic control, but do not change with
      short-term oral antidiabetic therapy in female patients with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus.
PG  - 313-6
AB  - This study evaluated the relation of leptin with glycaemic control and the effect
      of 14 days of diet, or diet combined with gliclazide, glipizide-GITS or metformin
      treatment, on leptin concentration in 51 female patients with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus. Leptin levels were similar both at baseline and after treatment in
      diabetic and control groups. Diabetic patients with basal fasting plasma glucose 
      (FPG) < 10 mmol/l or with basal postprandial plasma glucose (PPPG) < 13.9 mmol/l 
      had significantly higher leptin levels than diabetic patients with basal FPG > or
      = 10 mmol/l or with basal PPPG > or = 13.9 mmol/l (19.6+/-8.7 vs. 13.65+/-5.4
      microg/l, p < 0.05; and 20.2+/-7.9 vs. 12.9+/-5.2 microg/l, p < 0.05,
      respectively). Mode of treatment did not influence leptin levels. Delta leptin
      showed a weak correlation with basal FPG (r = 0.346; p < 0.05), basal and
      post-treatment PPPG (r = 0.335, p < 0.05 and r = 0.325, p < 0.05, respectively)
      and a moderate correlation with post-treatment FPG (r = 0.391, p < 0.01). In
      conclusion, leptin level is not affected by the presence of type 2 diabetes
      mellitus and by short-term treatment with diet or oral antidiabetic drugs but is 
      directly related to glycaemic control in female patients with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus.

TI  - Diastolic dysfunction in normotensive men with well-controlled type 2 diabetes:
      importance of maneuvers in echocardiographic screening for preclinical diabetic
      cardiomyopathy.
PG  - 5-10
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Because a pseudonormal pattern of ventricular filling has never been
      considered in studies that reported a prevalence of left ventricular diastolic
      dysfunction (LVDD) between 20 and 40%, our aim was to more completely evaluate
      the prevalence of LVDD in subjects with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We
      studied 46 men with type 2 diabetes who were aged 38-67 years; without evidence
      of diabetic complications, hypertension, coronary artery disease, congestive
      heart failure, or thyroid or overt renal disease; and with a maximal treadmill
      exercise test showing no ischemia. LVDD was evaluated by Doppler
      echocardiography, which included the use of the Valsalva maneuver and pulmonary
      venous recordings to unmask a pseudonormal pattern of left ventricular filling.
      RESULTS: LVDD was found in 28 subjects (60%), of whom 13 (28%) had a pseudonormal
      pattern of ventricular filling and 15 (32%) had impaired relaxation. Systolic
      function was normal in all subjects, and there was no correlation between LVDD
      and indexes of metabolic control. CONCLUSIONS: LVDD is much more common than
      previously reported in subjects with well-controlled type 2 diabetes who are free
      of clinically detectable heart disease. The high prevalence of this phenomenon in
      this high-risk population suggests that screening for LVDD in type 2 diabetes
      should include procedures such as the Valsalva maneuver and pulmonary venous
      recordings to unmask a pseudonormal pattern of ventricular filling.

AB  - Two randomized crossover studies were conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics 
      (including food effect) of fixed-combination metformin/glyburide tablets.
      Pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of two strengths (500 mg/2.5 mg and 500 mg/5
      mg) of metformin/glyburide tablets were assessed relative to coadministered
      metformin and glyburide tablets in study 1. The effect of a high-fat meal on the 
      bioavailability of a metformin/glyburide (500 mg/5 mg) tablet was assessed
      relative to the fasted condition in study 2. The fixed combination
      metformin/glyburide tablets showed bioequivalence for the metformin component
      with the reference metformin tablet and comparable bioavailability for the
      glyburide component with the reference glyburide tablet. Food does not appear to 
      affect the bioavailability of either component to an appreciable extent.

      hypoglycemic drug. Significant increase in urine sodium, urine volume,
      significant decrease in serum cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL (low density
      lipoproteins) and VLDL (very low density lipoproteins) cholesterol were observed 
      indicating that root of W. somnifera is a potential source of hypoglycemic,

TI  - The effect of oral hypoglycaemic agents on dyslipidaemia in Nigerian patients
      with newly diagnosed non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus--a prospective
      study.
PG  - 126-31
AB  - Thirty-five patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes (NIDDM) were treated and
      followed up for 24 weeks. Six of whom were managed with diet and/or metformin,
      nine received glibenclamide, twelve had a combination of metformin and
      glibenclamide, while the remaining eight patients received metformin and/or some 
      other type of sulphonylurea (chlorpropamide or glipizide). By an analysis of
      variance, the different drug regimes showed equivalent glycaemic controlling
      effects, but the influence on dyslipidaemia was variable within the treatment
      groups, while these changes were insignificant between the groups. It is thus
      concluded that commonly used oral hypoglycaemic agents do not adversely affect
      plasma lipid levels in Nigerian patients with NIDDM.

TI  - Insulin sensitiser drugs.
PG  - 1347-61
AB  - Insulin resistance is the predominant early pathological defect in Type 2
      diabetes. As well as being a risk factor for the development of Type 2 diabetes, 
      insulin resistance is also associated with increased cardiovascular risk and
      other metabolic disturbances including visceral adiposity, hyperinsulinaemia,
      impaired glucose tolerance, hypertension and dyslipidaemia [1-4]. The newest
      approach to oral antidiabetic therapy is to target improvements in insulin
      sensitivity at muscle, adipose tissue and hepatic level. This results in
      improvements in glycaemic control and other features of the insulin resistance
      syndrome, with potential long-term benefits in preventing/delaying the onset of
      diabetic complications and macrovascular disease.

TI  - [Pharmacological properties of nateglinide, rapid-onset/short-duration
      insulinotropic agent, in the treatment of type 2 diabetes].
PG  - 171-80
AB  - An early defect in Type 2 diabetes is the loss of acute insulin release after
      food intake, which causes prolonged elevation of postprandial glucose levels.
      Suppressing postprandial hyperglycemia is considered to be very important for
      preventing diabetic complications. Sulfonylureas are well-known insulin
      secretagogues and have been widely used in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes.
      These agents, however, do not appear to be able to ameliorate impairment of the
      first phase of insulin secretion and postprandial hyperglycemia. Nateglinide,
      which is a derivative of D-phenylalanine, is a non-sulfonylurea insulin
      secretagogue. Although the in vitro insulin-releasing effect of nateglinide is
      similar to that of sulfonylureas, its hypoglycemic effect is more rapid and short
      lasting. The in vivo unique pharmacodynamic profile of nateglinide is likely to
      result from its rapid absorption and elimination. This novel antidiabetic agent
      has made it possible to compensate for the impaired first phase insulin response 
      and thus suppresses postprandial hyperglycemia. In clinical trials, nateglinide
      reduced prandial glucose excursion and improved early phase of insulin release
      dose-dependently after 12 weeks treatment. Nateglinide is a highly physiologic
      mealtime glucose regulator, which rapidly increases insulin secretion when taken 
      before meals, mimicking early-phase insulin release lost in patients with Type 2 
      diabetes.

TI  - Long-term dietary treatment with increased amounts of fiber-rich low-glycemic
      index natural foods improves blood glucose control and reduces the number of
      hypoglycemic events in type 1 diabetic patients.
PG  - 1461-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate in type 1 diabetic patients 1) the long-term feasibility
      of a high-fiber (HF) diet composed exclusively of natural foodstuffs and 2) the
      efficacy of this diet in relation to blood glucose control and incidence of
      hypoglycemic episodes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study was randomized with
      parallel groups. Participants were part of a larger multicenter study on the
      effects of acarbose on glucose control in diabetes. A total of 63 type 1 diabetic
      patients, age 28 +/- 9 years, BMI 24 +/- 0.6 kg/m2, after a 4-week run-in period 
      on their habitual diet, were randomized to either an HF (n = 32) or a low-fiber
      (LF) diet (n = 31) for 24 weeks. The two diets, composed exclusively of natural
      foodstuffs, were weight-maintaining and, aside from their fiber content, were
      similar for all nutrients. At the end of the run-in period and the dietary
      treatment, fasting blood samples for the measurement of plasma cholesterol, HDL
      cholesterol, triglyceride, and HbA(1c) were collected. A daily glycemic profile
      was performed on a day in which the participants had consumed a standard menu
      representative of their treatment diet (HF or LF). RESULTS: Of the 63 study
      subjects, 29 in the HF group (91%) and 25 in the LF group (81%) completed the
      study Compared with the LF diet, the HF diet after 24 weeks decreased both mean
      daily blood glucose concentrations (P < 0.05) and number of hypoglycemic events
      (P < 0.01). When compliance to diet was taken into account, 83% of the subjects
      on the HF diet and 88% on the LF diet were compliant. In this subgroup, compared 
      with the LF diet, the HF diet significantly reduced mean daily blood glucose
      concentrations (P < 0.001), HbA(1c) (P < 0.05), and number of hypoglycemic events
      (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In type 1 diabetic patients, an HF diet is feasible in
      the long term and, compared with an LF diet, improves glycemic control and
      reduces the number of hypoglycemic events.

TI  - Does holiday hypoglycaemia exist?
PG  - 23-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: To determine whether an excessive, prolonged and, above all, unusual 
      physical exertion could be associated with episodes of mild hypoglycaemia in
      non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) patients treated with
      glibenclamide. METHODS: Experimental design: 11 months of observation with
      retrospective analysis of patient personal diaries to determine the hypoglycaemic
      risk. Setting: Diabetic Unit-Department of Medicine and Aging-Chieti University
      School of Medicine. Patients: We enrolled 340 NIDDM outpatients adjusted for sex,
      age, body mass index, alcohol intake and oral treatment regimen with
      glibenclamide. Patients were tested monthly for circadian blood glucose profiles 
      and glycosylated hemoglobin. Mild hypoglycaemia was defined on the basis of blood
      glucose values < 2.8 mmol/l associated with mild autonomic symptoms, without
      requiring external assistance. Each diabetic patient filled personal diary
      indicating the therapy regimen and the characteristics of eventual hypoglycaemic 
      episodes occurring during the observation period. RESULTS: 21.8% of NIDDM
      patients experienced one or two episodes of mild hypoglycaemia during the
      observation period. The analysis of the patients' diaries showed that 60% of the 
      hypoglycaemic episodes was associated with excessive, prolonged and unexpected
      physical exertions. Within this group, about 70% of the episodes occurred during 
      a holiday ("holiday hypoglycaemia"). After analyzing the socio-demographic and
      clinical characteristics of the diabetic patients reporting hypoglycaemic events,
      we found a higher risk for "holiday hypoglycaemia" in patients with a lower
      educational level, with a sedentary occupation or among the ex-farmers.
      CONCLUSIONS: As resulted in the present study, unexpected physical exertions may 
      represent a relevant cause of mild hypoglycaemia in diabetic patients receiving
      oral antidiabetic therapy. However, this hypoglycaemic cause may have been
      underestimated in the literature. Educational programs conducted by general
      practitioners or diabetologists could be useful for the patients in reducing the 
      number of mild hypoglycaemic episodes.

TI  - Pioglitazone.
PG  - 333-43; discussion 344-5
AB  - Pioglitazone is an orally administered insulin sensitising thiazolidinedione
      agent that has been developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
      Pioglitazone activates the nuclear peroxisome proliferator activated
      receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma), which leads to the increased transcription of
      various proteins regulating glucose and lipid metabolism. These proteins amplify 
      the post-receptor actions of insulin in the liver and peripheral tissues, which
      leads to improved glycaemic control with no increase in the endogenous secretion 
      of insulin. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, monotherapy with pioglitazone 
      15 to 45 mg/day has been shown to decrease blood glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c)
      levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The addition of pioglitazone 30
      mg/day to preexisting therapy with metformin, or of pioglitazone 15 or 30 mg/day 
      to sulphonylurea, insulin or voglibose therapy, has been shown to decrease HbA1c 
      and fasting blood glucose levels significantly in patients with poorly controlled
      type 2 diabetes mellitus. Pioglitazone has also been associated with improvements
      in serum lipid profiles in randomised placebo-controlled clinical studies. The
      drug has been well tolerated by adult patients of all ages in clinical studies.
      Oedema has been reported with monotherapy, and pooled data have shown
      hypoglycaemia in 2 to 15% of patients after the addition of pioglitazone to
      sulphonylurea or insulin treatment. There have been no reports of hepatotoxicity.

TI  - [Pharmacological treatment of postprandial hyperglycemia].
PG  - 20-4
AB  - Every diabetes treatment contributes to the control of postprandial blood
      glucose, yet some agents more specifically target this goal. Alpha-glucosidase
      inhibitors, led by acarbose, mainly address postprandial glucose control. These
      agents inhibit intestinal disaccharidases through a competitive effect and can be
      used either as the sole treatment or in combination with other antidiabetic
      drugs. Other agents improve insulin secretion kinetics. This is the case for
      repaglinide et nateglinide, which are efficient in controlling postprandial blood
      glucose, and to a lesser degree, fasting blood glucose. These agents shortly and 
      quickly stimulate insulin secretion and should be available soon. In oral therapy
      secondary failures, trials are currently being conducted to clarify the role of
      fast-acting insulin analogs, as monotherapy or in combination. Finally, insulin
      sensitizing agents are being investigated as a way to improve postprandial
      glucose efflux by potentiating insulin effects. The optimal strategy for the use 
      of these different therapeutic agents remains to be established, as well as their
      long-term effects on diabetic complications.

TI  - The K121Q variant of the human PC-1 gene is not associated with insulin
      resistance or type 2 diabetes among Danish Caucasians.
PG  - 1608-11
AB  - The human plasma-cell membrane differentiation antigen-1 (PC-1) has been shown to
      inhibit insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity. Recently, a K121Q polymorphism
      in the human PC-1 gene was found in a Sicilian population and was shown to be
      strongly associated with insulin resistance. The objectives of the present
      investigation were to examine in the Danish Caucasian population whether the
      K121Q variant was associated with type 2 diabetes or, in glucose-tolerant
      subjects, with impaired whole-body insulin sensitivity. We genotyped 404 Danish
      type 2 diabetic patients and found that the allele frequency of the variant was
      0.14 (95% CI 0.12-0.16), whereas the allele frequency was 0.16 (95% CI 0.13-0.19)
      among 237 matched glucose-tolerant control subjects (P = 0.6). In the control
      subjects, there were no significant differences among wild-type, heterozygous, or
      homozygous subjects in regard to 1) serum insulin and plasma glucose levels at
      fasting, 60 min, or 120 min during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) or 2)
      the estimates of insulin resistance obtained from the homeostasis model
      assessment (HOMA). Furthermore, we investigated the impact of the variant in 2
      other Danish population samples that comprised 356 young healthy subjects and 226
      glucose-tolerant offspring of type 2 diabetic probands, respectively. In all of
      the study populations, the polymorphism was not associated with an altered
      insulin sensitivity index as estimated from an intravenous glucose tolerance test
      in combination with an intravenous injection of tolbutamide. In addition, among
      the 226 offspring, the variations in serum insulin and serum C-peptide responses 
      measured during an OGTT were not related to the PC-1 genotype. In conclusion, the
      K121Q polymorphism of the human PC-1 gene is not associated with type 2 diabetes 
      or insulin resistance among Danish Caucasians.

TI  - Less nocturnal hypoglycemia and better post-dinner glucose control with bedtime
      insulin glargine compared with bedtime NPH insulin during insulin combination
      therapy in type 2 diabetes. HOE 901/3002 Study Group.
PG  - 1130-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Available basal insulin formulations do not provide a constant and
      reliable 24-h insulin supply. We compared the efficacy and safety of glargine (a 
      long-acting insulin analog) and NPH insulins in insulin-naive type 2 diabetic
      patients treated with oral antidiabetic agents. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS:
      There were 426 type 2 diabetic patients (age 59 +/- 9 years, BMI 28.9 +/- 4.3
      kg/m2, mean +/- SD) with poor glycemic control on oral antidiabetic agents
      randomized to treatment for 1 year with bedtime insulin glargine or bedtime NPH
      insulin. Oral agents were continued unchanged. The fasting blood glucose (FBG)
      target was 6.7 mmol/l (120 mg/dl). RESULTS: Average glycemic control improved
      similarly with both insulins (HbA(1c), [reference range <6.5%] 8.3 +/- 0.1 vs.
      8.2 +/- 0.1% at 1 year, glargine vs. NPH, mean +/- SEM, P < 0.001 vs. baseline
      for both). However, there was less nocturnal hypoglycemia (9.9 vs. 24.0% of all
      patients, glargine vs. NPH, P < 0.001) and lower post-dinner glucose
      concentrations (9.9 +/- 0.2 vs. 10.7 +/- 0.3 mmol/l, P < 0.02) with insulin
      glargine than with NPH. Insulin doses and weight gain were comparable. In
      patients reaching target FBG, HbA(1c) averaged 7.7 and 7.6% in the glargine and
      NPH groups at 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: Use of insulin glargine compared with NPH is
      associated with less nocturnal hypoglycemia and lower post-dinner glucose levels.
      These data are consistent with peakless and longer duration of action of insulin 
      glargine compared with NPH. Achievement of acceptable average glucose control
      requires titration of the insulin dose to an FBG target < or =6.7 mmol/l. These
      data support use of insulin glargine instead of NPH in insulin combination
      regimens in type 2 diabetes.

PG  - 101-4
AB  - In this open, randomized, two way crossover, bioequivalence study, two 5 mg
      tablet preparations of glipizide (Glipizyd tabl. 5 mg, Tarchominskie Zaklady
      Farmaceutyczne POLFA S.A., and Glibenese tabl. 5 mg, Pfizer), were compared in 24
      healthy male volunteers. Pharmacokinetic variables (mean maximum plasma
      concentration, mean time to reach maximum plasma concentration, and the mean area
      under the plasma concentration-time curve) were not statistically significantly
      different for the two formulations. It can be concluded that the two tablet
      preparations of glipizide are likely to be bioequivalent.

TI  - Troglitazone or metformin in combination with sulfonylureas for patients with
      type 2 diabetes?
PG  - 879-82
AB  - BACKGROUND: Combination oral therapy is often used to control the hyperglycemia
      of patients with type 2 diabetes. We compared the effectiveness of metformin and 
      troglitazone when added to sulfonylurea therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes
      who had suboptimal blood glucose control. METHODS: We used a randomized 2-group
      design to compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of troglitazone and
      metformin for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus that was inadequately
      controlled with diet and oral sulfonylureas. Thirty-two subjects were randomized 
      to receive either troglitazone or metformin for 14 weeks, including a 2-week
      drug-titration period. The primary outcome variable was mean change in the level 
      of glycosylated hemoglobin (Hb A1c) from baseline. Secondary outcomes included
      mean changes from baseline in fasting plasma glucose and C-peptide levels, renal 
      or metabolic side effects, and symptomatic tolerability. RESULTS: The addition of
      either troglitazone or metformin to oral sulfonylurea therapy significantly
      decreased Hb A1c levels. Both treatment regimens also significantly reduced
      fasting plasma glucose and C-peptide levels. We found no significant differences 
      between the treatment arms in efficacy, metabolic side effects, or tolerability. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that troglitazone and metformin each
      significantly improved Hb A1c, fasting plasma glucose, and C-peptide levels when 
      added to oral sulfonylurea therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes who had
      inadequate glucose control.

TI  - Response of pancreatic beta-cells to improved insulin sensitivity in women at
      high risk for type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 782-8
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the response of pancreatic beta-cells to
      changes in insulin sensitivity in women at high risk for type 2 diabetes. Oral
      glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) and frequently sampled intravenous glucose
      tolerance tests (FSIGTs) were conducted on Latino women with impaired glucose
      tolerance and a history of gestational diabetes before and after 12 weeks of
      treatment with 400 mg/day troglitazone (n = 13) or placebo (n = 12). Insulin
      sensitivity was assessed by minimal model analysis, and beta-cell insulin release
      was assessed as acute insulin responses to glucose (AIRg) and tolbutamide (AIRt) 
      during FSIGTs and as the 30-min incremental insulin response (30-min dINS) during
      OGTTs. Beta-cell compensation for insulin resistance was assessed as the product 
      (disposition index) of minimal model insulin sensitivity and each of the 3
      measures of beta-cell insulin release. In the placebo group, there was no
      significant change in insulin sensitivity or in any measure of insulin release,
      beta-cell compensation for insulin resistance, or glucose tolerance. Troglitazone
      treatment resulted in a significant increase in insulin sensitivity, as reported 
      previously. In response, AIRg did not change significantly, so that the
      disposition index for AIRg increased significantly from baseline (P = 0.004) and 
      compared with placebo (P = 0.02). AIRt (P = 0.001) and 30-min dINS (P = 0.02)
      fell with improved insulin sensitivity during troglitazone treatment, so that the
      disposition index for each of these measures of beta-cell function did not change
      significantly from baseline (P > 0.20) or compared with placebo (P > 0.3).
      Minimal model analysis revealed that 89% of the change from baseline in insulin
      sensitivity during troglitazone treatment was accounted for by lowered plasma
      insulin concentrations. Neither oral nor intravenous glucose tolerance changed
      significantly from baseline or compared with placebo during troglitazone
      treatment. The predominant response of beta-cells to improved insulin sensitivity
      in women at high risk for type 2 diabetes was a reduction in insulin release to
      maintain nearly constant glucose tolerance.

TI  - Repaglinide/troglitazone combination therapy: improved glycemic control in type 2
      diabetes.
PG  - 979-83
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This multicenter open-label clinical trial compared the efficacy and
      safety of repaglinide/troglitazone combination therapy, repaglinide monotherapy, 
      and troglitazone monotherapy in type 2 diabetes that had been inadequately
      controlled by sulfonylureas, acarbose, or metformin alone. RESEARCH DESIGN AND
      METHODS: Patients with type 2 diabetes (n = 256) who had inadequate glycemic
      control (HbA1c > or =7.0%) during previous monotherapy were randomly assigned to 
      receive repaglinide (0.5-4.0 mg at meals), troglitazone (200-600 mg once daily), 
      or a combination of repaglinide (1-4 mg at meals) and troglitazone (200-600 mg
      once daily). After a 4-6 week washout period, the trial assessed 22 weeks of
      treatment: 3 weeks (weeks 0-2) of forced titration, 11 weeks of fixed-dose
      treatment (weeks 3-13), and 8 weeks (weeks 14-21) of titration to maximum dose.
      Changes in HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) values were measured. RESULTS: 
      The combination therapy showed a significant reduction in mean HbA1c values
      (-1.7%) that was greater than with either type of monotherapy Repaglinide
      monotherapy resulted in a reduction of HbA1c values that was significantly
      greater than troglitazone (-0.8 vs. -0.4%) (P < 0.05). Combination therapy was
      more effective in reducing FPG values (-80 mg/dl) than either repaglinide (-43
      mg/dl) or troglitazone (-46 mg/dl) monotherapies. Adverse events were similar in 
      all groups. CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy with repaglinide and troglitazone
      leads to better glycemic control than monotherapy with either agent alone.
      Repaglinide monotherapy was more effective in lowering HbA1c levels than
      troglitazone monotherapy Repaglinide/troglitazone combination therapy was
      effective and did not show unexpected adverse events.

TI  - [Pharma-clinics. Medication of the month. Glimepiride (Amarylle)].
PG  - 184-6
AB  - Glimepiride, commercialized in Belgium under the trade name of Amarylle by
      Aventis, is a new sulphonylurea compound which is indicated in the treatment of
      type 2 diabetes, after diet and exercise failure. It is available as 2 mg
      tablets. The initial doses is 1 mg, to be progressively increased up to 4 mg per 
      day, if necessary, with a maximal daily dose of 6 mg. It is recommended to take
      glimepiride once a day, with the first main meal. Because of a particular binding
      of this sulphonylurea to the B cells of Langerhans pancreatic islets and,
      perhaps, of the presence of some extrapancreatic effects, both hypoglycaemic risk
      and circulating plasma insulin levels are lower with glimepiride than with
      glibenclamide, the reference sulphonylurea agent used in comparative clinical
      trials.

TI  - Recent developments and emerging therapies for type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 75-94
AB  - Most patients with type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus require
      pharmacotherapy, initially as monotherapy and subsequently in combination, as
      adjuncts to diet and exercise. Exogenous insulin is ultimately required in a
      substantial proportion, reflecting the progressive natural history of the
      disease. Sulphonylureas and biguanides have been employed for over 4 decades as
      oral antidiabetic agents, but they have a limited capacity to provide long term
      glycaemic control and can cause serious adverse effects. Thus, more efficacious
      and tolerable antidiabetic agents are required. Recent years have witnessed the
      introduction of agents with novel modes of action, that is, the alpha-glucosidase
      inhibitors acarbose and miglitol (which reduce postprandial hyperglycaemia) and
      the first of the thiazolidinedione insulinsensitising drugs--troglitazone and
      rosiglitazone. Although the former has been withdrawn in some countries due to
      adverse effects, another 'glitazone' pioglitazone is expected to be approved in
      the near future. Other recently introduced drugs include glimepiride and the
      meglitinide insulin secretagogue, repaglinide. Attention is also focusing
      increasingly on combination therapy using insulin together with sulphonylureas,
      metformin or troglitazone. Rapid-acting insulin analogues are now being used as
      alternatives to conventional insulins; their role in the management of type 2
      diabetes mellitus is presently uncertain but reports of a reduced frequency of
      hypoglycaemia are encouraging. The development of new drugs aims to counter the
      principal metabolic defects of the disorder, respectively, relative insulin
      deficiency and insulin resistance. Novel classes of rapid-acting secretagogues
      under evaluation include the morphilinoguanide BTS 67582 and the meglitinides
      mitiglinide (KAD 1229) and senaglinide (A-4166). Succinate ester derivatives
      represent a potential novel approach to improving beta-cell function through
      enhancement of insulin biosynthesis and secretion. Enhancement of
      nutrient-induced insulin secretion is a mechanism with several putative targets
      within the beta-cell; potentiators of insulin secretion include glucagon-like
      peptide-1 and its analogues, phosphodiesterase inhibitors and the imidazoline
      derivative PMS 812 (S 21663). The amylin agonist pramlintide slows gastric
      emptying and suppression of glucagon secretion. Non-thiazolidinedione
      insulin-sensitising agents include the gamma-receptor agonist G 1262570X (GG 570)
      and D-chiro-inositol. Insulin analogues with prolonged action and inhaled insulin
      preparations are also under investigation. Insulin-mimetic agents include organic
      vanadium compounds. Whether newer agents will offer clinically relevant efficacy 
      and tolerability advantages over existing therapies remains to be determined.

TI  - Erythromycin improves glycaemic control in patients with Type II diabetes
      mellitus.
PG  - 411-5
AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Erythromycin mimics the effect of the gastrointestinal hormone
      motilin by binding to its receptor and acting as a motilin agonist. We recently
      found that motilin stimulates insulin secretion at lower doses than doses
      required to stimulate gastric contractile activity. We studied the effects of
      erythromycin on insulin secretion and glycaemic control in patients with diabetes
      mellitus. METHODS: Inpatients (n = 34) with Type II (non-insulin-dependent)
      diabetes mellitus were randomly assigned to receive either erythromycin (400 mg
      orally three times a day, n = 19) or a placebo (n = 15) for 1 week (first study).
      Another 34 outpatients with Type II diabetes were also treated with erythromycin 
      (200 mg orally three times a day, n = 17) or a placebo (n = 17) for 4 weeks
      (second study). Finally, nine inpatients with Type II diabetes and eight normal
      control subjects received intravenous erythromycin (10 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1)) or
      saline infusion and insulin secretion was examined (third study). RESULTS:
      Erythromycin lowered fasting blood glucose and fructosamine concentrations (p <
      0.01) and increased basal as well as glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (p
      <0.05-0.01) (first study). Low doses of erythromycin treatment for 4 weeks also
      significantly improved glycaemic control in Type II diabetic patients (second
      study). Erythromycin infusion significantly increased plasma insulin and
      decreased glucose concentrations in Type II diabetic and control subjects and
      greatly potentiated glucose-induced insulin secretion in the latter (third
      study). CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: These results indicate that erythromycin given
      orally has an antidiabetogenic effect and therefore erythromycin derivatives that
      lack the antibacterial activity could have a therapeutic value in Type II
      diabetic patients.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of cerivastatin for type 2 diabetes and
      hypercholesterolaemia. Hyperlipidaemia in Diabetes Mellitus investigators.
PG  - 399-403
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of coronary heart disease (CHD) is markedly increased 
      in diabetic patients compared with non-diabetic individuals, and its prognosis is
      less good. Serum total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol
      concentrations have been shown to be powerful predictors of CHD morbidity and
      mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes. The available data suggest that the
      target cholesterol concentration in patients with diabetes should be similar to
      that in non-diabetic individuals with a previous myocardial infarction. This led 
      us to investigate the efficacy, tolerability and safety of a new, highly potent
      statin, cerivastatin, in diabetic hyperlipidaemia. METHODS: This was a
      multinational, multicentre, double-blind, randomized study in type 2 diabetic
      patients with hypercholesterolaemia (LDL cholesterol >3.35 mmol/l; triglycerides 
      <4.56 mmol/l). Eligible patients were randomly assigned to groups to receive
      cerivastatin 0.1 mg or 0.3 mg or placebo in a ratio of 2:2:1 for 12 weeks. They
      were monitored in the clinic every 4 weeks. RESULTS: Of the 453 patients
      screened, 265 were allocated to the study groups. Fifty-one received placebo and 
      107 patients were assigned to each active treatment group (0.1 mg and 0.3 mg
      cerivastatin). At the close of the study, total cholesterol had decreased by
      13.7% and 23.5%, LDL cholesterol decreased by 20.2% and 33.8%, and triglyceride
      concentrations decreased by 3.9% and 12.3% in the cerivastatin 0.1 mg and 0.3 mg 
      groups, respectively. There was no significant difference between the groups in
      haemoglobin A1c, adverse events or increases in liver and muscle enzymes during
      the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Hypercholesterolaemic patients with type 2
      diabetes had a significant reduction in LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol
      concentrations after cerivastatin treatment once daily. The dose of 0.3 mg
      cerivastatin is effective in diabetic hypercholesterolaemia, with co-reduction of
      triglyceride concentrations. The effect of cerivastatin on coronary morbidity and
      mortality is currently being investigated in clinical trials.

      postprandial peak plasma glucose levels and thus improves glycaemic control,
      which is reflected in a reduced glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level. This oral
      antihyperglycaemic agent is indicated for the treatment of patients with type 2
      diabetes mellitus. Miglitol is generally well tolerated and, unlike the
      sulphonylurea agents, is not associated with bodyweight gain or hypoglycaemia
      when administered as monotherapy. The drug is systemically absorbed but is not
      metabolised and is rapidly excreted via the kidneys. Clinical trials with
      miglitol (usually 50 or 100 mg 3 times daily) in patients with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus consistently demonstrated a significant improvement in glycaemic control
      for periods of 6 to 12 months. There were also marked reductions in postprandial 
      serum insulin levels, although miglitol generally had no effect on fasting
      insulin levels. In comparative studies miglitol had similar efficacy to acarbose,
      but at lower therapeutic doses (50 and 100 mg 3 times daily, respectively). In
      addition, although sulphonylurea agents provided superior reductions in HbA1c
      levels, miglitol provided similar or superior reductions in fasting and
      postprandial plasma glucose levels. In combination with other oral antidiabetic
      agents or insulin, miglitol improved glycaemic control in patients in whom
      metabolic control was suboptimal despite dietary and pharmacological
      intervention. Most adverse events associated with miglitol treatment involve
      disturbances of the gastrointestinal tract (most common effects are flatulence,
      abdominal pain and diarrhoea). These symptoms are usually dose dependent, mild to
      moderate in severity, occur at the onset of treatment, decline with time and
      resolve promptly on discontinuation of the drug or with dosage adjustment. As
      monotherapy, miglitol is not associated with hypoglycaemia, but concomitant use
      with other oral antidiabetic agents may necessitate dosage adjustment of the
      other agents. Miglitol had no significant effects on renal, cardiovascular,
      respiratory or haematological parameters in long term studies. No dosage
      adjustments are required in elderly patients, in those with hepatic impairment or
      in those with mild to moderate renal insufficiency. Conclusions: In long term,
      well designed trials miglitol reduces fasting and postprandial plasma glucose
      levels, thus improving glycaemic control, which is reflected in a reduced HbA1c
      level in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Most adverse events associated
      with miglitol involve disturbances of the gastrointestinal tract. This agent is a
      useful first-line therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
      insufficiently controlled by diet alone and as second-line or as adjuvant therapy
      in those insufficiently controlled with diet and sulphonylurea agents. Miglitol
      may prove particularly beneficial in elderly patients and those with hepatic
      impairment or mild to moderate renal impairment, in whom other oral antidiabetic 
      agents are contraindicated or need to be used with caution.

AB  - In addition to dietary and lifestyle changes, standing as the cornerstone of type
      2 diabetes care, pharmacological treatments, whether as single or multidrug
      patterns, are often necessary for an efficient blood glucose control. Besides
      insulin, four different oral antidiabetic drug categories are available, each of 
      them acting through different and potentially synergistic ways. Oral antidiabetic
      drugs include: 1) biguanides acting through the reduction of hepatic glucose
      production and are most efficient in obese patients; 2) alpha-glucosidase
      inhibitors delaying carbohydrate intestinal absorption; 3) thiazolidinediones or 
      "glitazones", acting as insulin sensitizers; 4) insulin secretion enhancers,
      mainly including sulfonylureas, which increase insulin secretion and are being
      credited by a long clinical usage; these are now joined by the new generation of 
      insulin secretion enhancers, led by repaglinide, which can mimic the
      physiological insulin secretion profile by a specific stimulatory effect on
      beta-cells characterized by its fast onset and short half-life. Obviously, the
      combination of these different antidiabetic drugs, by targetting different
      synergistic and additive pathways, can help to further improve blood glucose.

TI  - Addition of low-dose rosiglitazone to sulphonylurea therapy improves glycaemic
      control in Type 2 diabetic patients.
PG  - 40-7
AB  - AIMS: This study was designed to test the efficacy and safety of low-dose
      rosiglitazone, a potent, insulin-sensitizing thiazolidinedione, in combination
      with sulphonylurea in Type 2 diabetic patients. METHODS: For the
      intention-to-treat analysis, 574 patients (59% male, mean age 61 years) were
      available, randomized to receive 26 weeks of twice-daily placebo (n = 192),
      rosiglitazone 1 mg (n = 199) or rosiglitazone 2 mg (n = 183) in addition to
      existing sulphonylurea treatment with gliclazide (47.6% of patients),
      glibenclamide (41.8%) or glipizide (9.4%) (two patients were taking carbutamide
      or glimepiride). Change in haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG),
      fructosamine, insulin, C-peptide, albumin, and lipids were measured, and safety
      was evaluated. RESULTS: Mean baseline HbA1c was 9.2% and FPG was 11.4 mmol/l.
      Rosiglitazone at doses of 1 and 2 mg b.d. plus sulphonylurea produced significant
      decreases, compared with sulphonylurea plus placebo, in HbA1c (-0.59% and -1.03%,
      respectively; both P<0.0001) and FPG (1.35 mmol/l and 2.44 mmol/l, respectively; 
      both P<0.0001). Both HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol increased and
      potentially beneficial decreases in non-esterified fatty acids and gamma glutamyl
      transpeptidase levels were seen in both rosiglitazone groups. The overall
      incidence of adverse experiences was similar in all three treatment groups, with 
      no significant cardiac events, hypoglycaemia or hepatotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS:
      Overall, the combination of rosiglitazone and a sulphonylurea was safe, well
      tolerated and effective in patients with Type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Economic assessment of troglitazone as an adjunct to sulfonylurea therapy in the 
      treatment of type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 116-27
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the economic efficiency of adding troglitazone to
      sulfonylurea therapy to improve glycemic control. BACKGROUND: Despite the high
      prevalence of type 2 diabetes, existing treatment strategies often fail. New oral
      agents give a wider segment of the population with type 2 diabetes hope of
      achieving near-normal blood-glucose levels. Troglitazone, a novel chemical
      entity, is one promising new agent. METHODS: We conducted an economic analysis
      based on glycemic-control data from a randomized clinical trial comparing
      troglitazone with placebo, each added to glyburide. A patient simulation model
      was used to translate these data to long-term outcomes associated with diabetes. 
      Patients had poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus despite glyburide
      therapy. Risk functions of developing and progressing through nephropathy,
      retinopathy, neuropathy, hypoglycemia, and macrovascular disease were developed
      from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial and large epidemiologic
      studies. Cost estimates were based on data from 5 states, all payor databases,
      surveys, and literature. The main outcomes of the model were cost-consequences,
      number of patients developing each type of complication, mean time to development
      of the complication, cost per life-year gained (LYG), and cost per
      quality-adjusted life-year. RESULTS: The model predicts that for every 1000
      patients treated with troglitazone, the improved glycemic control could mean that
      95 to 140 fewer patients would experience one of the most severe diabetic
      complications (eg, blindness, end-stage renal disease, amputation), which may
      increase life expectancy by 2.0 years. These benefits are obtained at an
      additional $2100 per LYG (undiscounted). The ratio remains <$50,000 per LYG for
      most variations in input. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical trial demonstrated that
      troglitazone + glyburide improves glycemic control compared with glyburide alone.
      Based on these results, the model estimates fewer diabetic complications at a
      cost well below accepted cost-effective thresholds.

      antidiabetic therapy.
PG  - 389-95
AB  - This article reviewed the relevant literature including published clinical trials
      and reviews on currently available oral hypoglycemic agents. Results showed that 
      the benefits of glycemic control have been established through multiple clinical 
      trials. Long-term control of blood glucose levels in type 1 and type 2 diabetic
      patients will decrease the incidence and prolong the time until progression of
      diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy. Our increased understanding of
      the pathophysiology behind type 2 diabetes has led to the development of many new
      agents that are aimed at treating the underlying insulin resistance and relative 
      insulinopenia. The sulfonylureas as a group have been used for many years and act
      by stimulating insulin secretion. They are useful alone or as combination therapy
      with insulin or another oral hypoglycemic agent. The biguanides act by decreasing
      hepatic glucose production and by increasing peripheral insulin sensitivity. The 
      alpha-glucosidase inhibitors act nonsystemically by blocking the metabolism of
      digested polysaccharides and therefore lowering the amount of carbohydrate
      absorbed in a meal. Benzoic acid derivatives act in a manner similar to that of
      sulfonylureas by enhancing pancreatic insulin production. They offer a shorter
      duration of action, lowering the risk of hypoglycemia. The thiazolidinediones
      increase peripheral insulin sensitivity and are effective as both monotherapy and
      combination therapy. Oral hypoglycemic agents, when properly administered, are
      very effective in controlling type 2 diabetes and preventing long-term
      complications.

TI  - The use of sulphonylureas in the elderly.
PG  - 471-81
AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a heterogeneous disorder characterised by defects in 
      insulin secretion as well as reduced insulin action. During aging, glucose
      intolerance will gradually develop, and this is manifested primarily by an
      increase in the postprandial blood glucose response while fasting blood glucose
      levels are often less elevated. Abnormal beta-cell secretion of insulin is a main
      feature of this. Treatment of elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
      focuses on reduction of (hyperglycaemic) complaints and prevention of the
      development or progression of secondary complications. Although regular physical 
      activity and dietary measures, aiming at bodyweight normalisation, are the
      cornerstones of therapy, pharmacological treatment with oral blood glucose
      lowering-agents often proves necessary to control the hyperglycaemia. In the
      United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) it was clearly shown that
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were intensively treated with oral
      blood glucose-lowering agents or insulin developed less microvascular
      complications. The question whether achievement of strict metabolic control is
      also of benefit in elderly patients, is still unanswered. Sulphonylureas are
      drugs which stimulate insulin secretion by enhancing the release of insulin from 
      the pancreatic beta-cells without an effect on insulin synthesis. They are
      frequently used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, and several
      preparations are available. In general, there are no major differences in
      effectiveness between the various sulphonylureas. Long term treatment with
      sulphonylureas will decrease fasting and postprandial plasma glucose levels by 3 
      to 5 mmol/L, and glycosylated haemoglobin by 20%. However, after its initial
      decline, plasma glucose level will often go up slightly during the following
      months to years. Sulphonylureas are usually well tolerated. Hypoglycaemia is the 
      most frequently occurring adverse effect, which may be very serious and damaging 
      in the elderly. It has been associated primarily with long-acting sulphonylureas,
      like chlorpropamide and glibenclamide (glyburide). Hypoglycaemic episodes may
      trigger serious events like myocardial infarction or stroke. Therefore,
      shorter-acting compounds like tolbutamide and gliclazide have been relatively
      well tolerated and appear to be the best choice to treat elderly patients. It is 
      advisable to start with a low dose and increase the dose, when needed, in small
      steps. The efficacy of sulphonylureas is much greater when they are taken before 
      a meal. Because of the fact that type 2 diabetes mellitus is a progressive
      disease, and residual beta-cell function decreases with time, insulin therapy may
      ultimately be warranted in a significant number of patients.

TI  - Oral pharmacologic management of type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 2613-20
AB  - Epidemiologic and interventional studies have led to lower treatment targets for 
      type 2 diabetes (formerly known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes), including a
      glycosylated hemoglobin level of 7 percent or less and a before-meal blood
      glucose level of 80 to 120 mg per dL (4.4 to 6.7 mmol per L). New oral
      medications make these targets easier to achieve, especially in patients with
      recently diagnosed diabetes. Acarbose, metformin, miglitol, pioglitazone,
      rosiglitazone and troglitazone help the patient's own insulin control glucose
      levels and allow early treatment with little risk of hypoglycemia. Two new
      long-acting sulfonylureas (glimepiride and extended-release glipizide) and a
      short-acting sulfonylurea-like agent (repaglinide) simply and reliably augment
      the patient's insulin supply. Combinations of agents have additive therapeutic
      effects and can restore glucose control when a single agent is no longer
      successful. Oral therapy for early type 2 diabetes can be relatively inexpensive,
      and evidence of its cost-effectiveness is accumulating.

TI  - Lack of interaction between thioctic acid, glibenclamide and acarbose.
PG  - 819-25
AB  - AIMS: Thioctic acid (TA), glibenclamide and acarbose are widely used to either
      alone or concomitantly treat patients suffering from noninsulin-dependent
      diabetes (NIDDM). This study systematically investigated drug-drug interactions
      between TA and glibenclamide and TA and acarbose. METHODS: Fourteen male and 10
      female healthy volunteers participated a randomized, open three period cross over
      trial (treatments A-C) followed by a fourth period (treatment D). A baseline
      profile for plasma insulin and glucose concentrations, variables which served as 
      pharmacodynamic measures, was assessed before entering the trial. Treatments were
      A=600 mg TA orally, B=3.5 mg glibenclamide orally, C=600 mg TA+3.5 mg
      glibenclamide, D=600 mg TA+50 mg acarbose. Time courses of R(+)-TA and S(-)-TA as
      well as glibenclamide concentrations were measured with specific analytical
      methods. RESULTS: There was no clinically relevant change of TA enantiomer
      pharmacokinetics by glibenclamide or acarbose. Also, glibenclamide
      pharmacokinetics were not altered by TA to a clinically meaningful extent. Plasma
      insulin and glucose concentrations did not indicate an interaction between TA and
      glibenclamide or TA and acarbose. Glibenclamide had the expected effect on
      insulin and glucose levels independent of comedication. There were only minor and
      short lasting adverse events with the majority being (expected) hypoglycaemic
      symptoms occurring during the treatments with glibenclamide. CONCLUSIONS:
      Coadministration of single doses of TA and glibenclamide or TA and acarbose does 
      not appear to cause drug-drug interactions.

TI  - Repaglinide--a new compound for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 229-34
AB  - Repaglinide is a new oral blood glucose lowering agent, a member of the
      carbamoylmethyl benzoic acid (CMBA) family. Its mechanism of action is partly
      similar to that of the sulphonylurea: the release of insulin from the pancreatic 
      beta cells is stimulated by closure of ATP-dependent potassium channels. However,
      repaglinide regulates these channels via a different binding site on the beta
      cell than glibenclamide, and the drug does not cause insulin release in the
      absence of glucose, or during voltage-clamping. After oral administration the
      drug is rapidly absorbed and eliminated. It is therefore used in a meal-related
      dosing regimen; repaglinide is taken with each main meal. This meal-related use
      may give a more physiological mimick of daytime insulin requirement than
      once-daily or twice-daily use of sulphonylurea. Patients using repaglinide are
      less likely to develop hypoglycaemic symptoms when they miss or postpone a meal
      in comparison with patients on glibenclamide treatment. In long-term comparative 
      phase 3 clinical studies it was found that repaglinide is equally effective in
      maintaining glycaemic control as existing sulphonylurea, but it gives
      significantly better control of postprandial blood glucose levels. Repaglinide
      can be used as monotherapy both in obese and non-obese type 2 diabetic patients, 
      and is also very effective in combination with drugs like metformin or
      thiazolidines. Because of its excretion through liver and bile it is also an
      attractive drug for diabetic patients with diminished kidney function, especially
      the elderly diabetic. Although the overall incidence of hypoglycaemia was similar
      during use of repaglinide and of sulphonylurea, fewer serious hypoglycaemic
      episodes were observed in repaglinide-treated patients.

TI  - Low-dose ethanol predisposes elderly fasted patients with type 2 diabetes to
      sulfonylurea-induced low blood glucose.
PG  - 2037-43
AB  - OBJECTIVE: It has previously been demonstrated that the risk of hypoglycemia is
      low among otherwise healthy elderly fasted patients with type 2 diabetes taking
      oral sulfonylurea medications. Nevertheless, these agents do cause hypoglycemia
      in clinical practice, suggesting that accompanying factors must typically be
      present for hypoglycemia to occur. Ethanol is one putative risk factor that has
      not been evaluated as a mechanism for low blood glucose among sulfonylurea users.
      We hypothesized that low concentrations of ethanol would reduce blood glucose
      concentrations in elderly type 2 diabetic patients receiving sulfonylureas during
      a short-term fast. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 10 type 2 diabetic
      patients, aged 68 +/- 3 years and receiving 20 mg glyburide daily, participated
      in a prospective double-blind placebo-controlled in-patient study consisting of
      two 24-h fasts at least 1 week apart. During hours 14 and 15 of the fasting
      studies, subjects received intravenous infusions of either 4.35 mmol.kg-1.h-1
      ethanol (equivalent to one or two alcoholic beverages) or saline placebo in
      random order. Ethanol, plasma glucose, insulin, and counterregulatory hormones
      were assessed very 30-60 min during the final 10 h of the fast. RESULTS: Blood
      ethanol levels peaked at 17 +/- 2 mmol/l (the lower legal limit of intoxication
      in New Mexico) during the ethanol study. Plasma glucose concentrations did not
      differ at baseline (placebo 8.5 +/- 1.8 vs. ethanol 8.7 +/- 1.7 mmol/l; P =
      0.50), but nadir plasma glucose was lower after the ethanol infusion compared
      with placebo (4.4 +/- 1.2 vs. 5.0 +/- 1.4 mmol/l; P = 0.01), and the absolute
      decline in plasma glucose was also greater during the ethanol study than the
      placebo study (4.7 +/- 0.9 vs. 3.6 +/- 1.2 mmol/l; P = 0.01). Counterregulatory
      hormone levels were increased during the ethanol study and nonesterified fatty
      acid concentrations were suppressed compared with the placebo study. CONCLUSIONS:
      Low doses of ethanol predispose fasted elderly type 2 diabetic patients to low
      blood glucose during a short-term fast. This may be one of several mechanisms by 
      which sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycemia occurs in elderly patients.

TI  - Strategies for better diabetes control in the US.
PG  - 61-9
AB  - Recent surveys in the US have indicated that 71% of the total diabetes care is
      delivered by primary care physicians, and that current management practices in
      terms of the point of initiation of pharmacological treatment fall considerably
      short of the American Diabetes Association's recommendations. In part, this delay
      in initiating treatment is due to a fear of provoking hypoglycaemia, which in
      itself results from a general avoidance of blood glucose monitoring on the part
      of patients. As a consequence of this apparent disregard for diabetes care, blood
      glucose concentrations are not adequately controlled in the US and this is
      reflected in a high incidence of chronic complications, particularly diabetic
      neuropathy. This is likely to have major cost implications in the future. In an
      effort to improve the standard of diabetes care, a number of US authorities have 
      begun producing guidelines for primary care physicians, and in the State of
      Texas, treatment algorithms that incorporate recommendations based on the current
      US registration trial data have been developed. These recommendations, which have
      now been adopted by the State of Texas and form part of the minimum standard of
      care mandated by the State Department of Health's Diabetes Council, provide
      guidance on the selection and use of oral antidiabetic drugs (including
      sulphonylureas, metformin, troglitazone, repaglinide and acarbose) in patients
      with type 2 diabetes, both for glycaemic control and for prevention of
      cardiovascular complications. It is hoped that organised implementation of these 
      treatment algorithms will produce better control of diabetes and its
      complications than the current ad hoc strategies used by individual
      practitioners.

TI  - Insulin lispro in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus after
      oral agent failure.
PG  - 1703-14
AB  - This study assessed the safety profile and efficacy of a new combination therapy 
      (insulin lispro plus sulfonylurea) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
      experiencing secondary oral agent failure. A total of 423 patients were randomly 
      assigned to 3 treatment groups: preprandial insulin lispro plus sulfonylurea (L +
      S), bedtime neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin plus sulfonylurea (N + S),
      and preprandial insulin lispro plus bedtime NPH insulin (L + N). Mean decreases
      in glycosylated hemoglobin from baseline were 1.60%+/-1.27% for patients
      receiving L + S, 1.21%+/-1.21% for those receiving N + S, and 1.40%+/-1.46% for
      those receiving L + N (within treatment, P<0.001; for L + S vs. N + S, P =
      0.003). Fasting blood glucose level was higher in patients receiving L + S
      (171+/-46.5 mg/dL) or L + N (166+/-52.5 mg/dL) than in those receiving N + S
      (144+/-48.2 mg/dL) (P<0.001, for both comparisons). Conversely, postprandial
      blood glucose level was lower in patients receiving L + S (165+/-41.6 mg/dL) or L
      + N (165+/-46.3 mg/dL) than in those receiving N + S (213+/-58.3 mg/dL) (P<0.001,
      for both comparisons). The overall rate of hypoglycemia (episodes per 30 days)
      was not statistically significant when the L + S, N + S, and L + N therapies were
      compared (0.99+/-1.74 vs. 0.87+/-2.31 vs. 1.16+/-2.38, respectively). The rate of
      nocturnal hypoglycemia was lowest in the L + S group (0.00+/-0.00 vs. 0.10+/-0.37
      for the N + S group vs. 0.15+/-0.54 for the L + N group; P = 0.004). L + S, which
      has a safety profile equal to those of N + S and L + N, is an effective treatment
      for patients with type 2 diabetes who experience oral sulfonylurea agent failure.
      L + S offers an alternative to these established combination therapies in
      patients whose type 2 diabetes cannot be controlled with a sulfonylurea alone.

PG  - 347-9
AB  - We report the case of a 35 year-old woman with recurrent gastrointestinal
      bleeding in a type 2 diabetic patient well controlled with glibenclamide. After
      volume resuscitation and transfusion with packed blood cells an infusion of
      octreotide at 50 mcg/hr was started. It was decided to start a long term
      octreotide treatment and the potential effect on her glycemic control was
      studied. A 75 gram oral glucose tolerance test was performed in two consecutive
      days with and then without octreotide infusion. With octreotide blood glucose was
      higher and insulin levels were lower. As clinical indications expand, situations 
      will arise where patients with diabetes on sulfonylureas may require octreotide
      with a conceivable dramatic worsening of glycemic control.

TI  - A short-term cost-of-treatment model for type 2 diabetes: comparison of glipizide
      gastrointestinal therapeutic system, metformin, and acarbose.
PG  - 1007-24
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare, from a managed care perspective, the 3-year costs of 3
      first-line monotherapy strategies in type 2 diabetes patients: glipizide
      gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS), metformin, and acarbose. STUDY
      DESIGN: A Markov model, with a Monte Carlo simulation, was developed to compare
      the costs to achieve full glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c of < or = 7%) with
      each first-line strategy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The patient population for the
      model was assumed to be all newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients eligible for
      monotherapy with an oral agent. Each monotherapy could be succeeded by add-on
      treatments. The model included the costs of routine medical care and supplies,
      medication, adverse events, and treatment failures. RESULTS: Using a Monte Carlo 
      simulation, the mean 3-year cumulative costs per patient were $4971, $5273, and
      $5311 for glipizide GITS, metformin, and acarbose first-line strategies,
      respectively. The main cost drivers were drug prices. Mean 3-year cost savings
      for first-line glipizide GITS were $301 over metformin and $340 over acarbose.
      Between 83% and 85% of all simulations showed cost savings with glipizide GITS
      compared with the other agents. CONCLUSIONS: The model suggests first-line
      monotherapy with glipizide GITS should result in desirable short-term economic
      benefits for managed care. Because the model incorporates recommended glycemic
      goals and performed well in sensitivity analyses, it should be applicable to a
      variety of clinical practices and useful for economic assessments of new
      therapies. Results of this model should be verified prospectively in typical care
      settings.

      sulphonylurea withdrawal. Scandinavian Insulin-Sulphonylurea Study Group Research
      Team.
PG  - 827-34
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the effect of adding insulin to sulphonylurea (SU) and the
      effect of SU withdrawal on glycaemic control in Type 2 diabetic patients who
      failed on treatment with SU alone. METHOD: One hundred and seventy-five patients 
      were included in a placebo-controlled multicentre study. During phase I (4
      months), premixed insulin was added to glibenclamide therapy; during phase II
      (1-4 months, depending on response) the insulin dose was fixed, while placebo or 
      glibenclamide replaced the open SU therapy. Insulin sensitivity (KITT), beta-cell
      function (C-peptide) and metabolic control (HbA1c) were monitored. RESULTS: HbA1c
      improved from 9.65% to 7.23% (P < 0.0001) during phase I. A high HbA1c value (P <
      0.0001) and a high KITT-value (P = 0.045) at baseline were associated with a
      beneficial response to combination treatment. During phase II, glycaemic control 
      was unchanged in the control (glibenclamide) group. In the placebo group, after
      SU withdrawal, fasting blood glucose (FBG) increased by 10% or more within 4
      weeks in 79% of the patients. Patients (67 of 112) with an FBG increase > or =40%
      during phase II were defined as 'SU responders' by protocol. In a multivariate
      analysis only a long duration of diabetes was associated with SU response. There 
      were more GAD-antibody-positive patients among non-responders (18% vs. 4%, P =
      0.0263). CONCLUSIONS: Poor glycaemic control in combination with preserved
      insulin sensitivity and lack of GAD antibodies predicts a beneficial response to 
      combination therapy, which can be achieved in 75% of patients with SU failure.

TI  - The lipoprotein profile differs during insulin treatment alone and combination
      therapy with insulin and sulphonylureas in patients with Type 2 diabetes
      mellitus.
PG  - 820-6
AB  - AIMS: To study whether changes in endogenous insulin secretion at the same
      glycaemic control affect the plasma concentrations of lipoproteins in patients
      with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: Fifteen patients, age 59+/-2 years (mean 
      +/- SEM), body weight 86.3+/-3.0kg, body mass index 29.6+/-0.9 kg/m2 were treated
      with sulphonylurea and insulin in combination or with insulin alone in a
      randomized, double-blind, crossover study. All patients were treated with a
      multiple daily injection regimen with the addition of glibenclamide 10.5 mg daily
      or placebo tablets. RESULTS: During combination therapy, the dose of insulin was 
      25% less (P < 0.002) and there was a 29% increase in plasma C-peptide
      concentration (P = 0.01). Plasma levels of free insulin were not changed. Plasma 
      levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and insulin-like growth
      factor-binding protein (IGFBP)-1 were lowered. There were no differences in the
      24-h blood glucose profiles or HbA1c (6.0+/-0.2 vs. 6.3+/-0.2%; P = 0.16). Body
      weight was similar. There was a significant decrease in plasma LDL cholesterol
      (3.04+/-0.24 vs. 3.41+/-0.21 mmol/l; P = 0.04), apolipoprotein A1 and of
      lipoprotein(a) but an increase in VLDL-triglycerides (1.36+/-0.31 vs. 0.96+/-0.16
      mmol/l; P = 0.02) during combination therapy. The ratio between LDL cholesterol
      and apolipoprotein B concentrations was significantly lower during combination
      therapy (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy with insulin and
      sulphonylureas increases portal insulin supply and thereby alters liver
      lipoprotein metabolism when compared with insulin therapy alone.

TI  - A review of metabolic and cardiovascular effects of oral antidiabetic agents:
      beyond glucose-level lowering.
PG  - 337-46
AB  - It has become evident that cardiovascular disease is the major cause of morbidity
      and mortality in type 2 diabetes mellitus. This raises the possibility that
      glucose lowering agents with other nonglucose-lowering effects, might have added 
      benefits. In this review, we focus on the metabolic and cardiovascular effects of
      oral antidiabetic agents that go beyond glucose-level lowering. Such effects
      include lipid modifying actions, antithrombotic and profibrinolytic activities,
      and direct action at the level of the vessel wall to improve endothelial function
      or prevent smooth muscle hyperplasia. These additional activities, particularly
      those seen with the newer oral antidiabetic agents, hold the promise of reducing 
      cardiovascular complications beyond that achievable by glucose lowering alone.

TI  - Interaction of sulfonylureas and exercise on glucose homeostasis in type 2
      diabetic patients.
PG  - 1647-54
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the plasma glucose-lowering effects of
      sulfonylureas and acute submaximal exercise are additive and, accordingly, to
      determine whether they may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined in
      fasting patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Eight postabsorptive type 2
      diabetic patients were examined at three occasions: after oral sulfonylurea (7 mg
      glibenclamide), during 60 min of ergometer cycle exercise at 57 +/- 3% of VO2max,
      and during exercise after glibenclamide. RESULTS: Heart rate, VO2, and lactate
      responses to exercise were comparable (P > 0.05) on days with and without
      glibenclamide. Plasma insulin concentrations were always increased by
      glibenclamide, and they were lowered identically by exercise with and without
      glibenclamide. However, throughout exercise, absolute concentrations of insulin
      were lower on days without glibenclamide compared with days with glibenclamide
      (34.5 +/- 4.7 vs. 47.4 +/- 5.5 pmol/l; P < 0.05). At the start of exercise,
      glucose concentrations were similar between experiments (P > 0.05). The rate of
      decrease in glucose during exercise was higher (P < 0.05) on days with both
      glibenclamide and exercise, compared with days with glibenclamide alone and days 
      with exercise alone (-0.035 +/- 0.009 vs. -0.016 +/- 0.002 and -0.022 +/- 0.005
      mmol.l-1.min-1, respectively). Consequently, the glucose nadir was lower on days 
      with glibenclamide and exercise than on days with glibenclamide or exercise alone
      (6.7 +/- 1.1 vs. 8.1 +/- 0.9 and 7.6 +/- 1.0 mmol/l, respectively; P < 0.05).
      During exercise, the rate of appearance of plasma glucose determined by
      3-[3H]glucose infusion was lower on days with glibenclamide than on days without 
      glibenclamide (2.3 +/- 0.1 vs. 2.9 +/- 0.1 mg.min-1.kg-1; P < 0.05). In contrast,
      glucose clearance was identical (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In postabsorptive type 2
      diabetic patients, the hypoglycemic action of glibenclamide and exercise is
      enhanced when the treatments are combined. The interaction reflects an increased 
      inhibition by glibenclamide-enhanced insulin levels of hepatic glucose production
      when hepatic glucose production is accelerated by exercise.

TI  - Characterization of the cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in the in vitro
      metabolism of rosiglitazone.
PG  - 424-32
AB  - AIMS: To identify the human cytochrome P450 enzyme(s) involved in the in vitro
      metabolism of rosiglitazone, a potential oral antidiabetic agent for the
      treatment of type 2 diabetes-mellitus. Method The specific P450 enzymes involved 
      in the metabolism of rosiglitazone were determined by a combination of three
      approaches; multiple regression analysis of the rates of metabolism of
      rosiglitazone in human liver microsomes against selective P450 substrates, the
      effect of selective chemical inhibitors on rosiglitazone metabolism and the
      capability of expressed P450 enzymes to mediate the major metabolic routes of
      rosiglitazone metabolism. Result The major products of metabolism following
      incubation of rosiglitazone with human liver microsomes were para-hydroxy and
      N-desmethyl rosiglitazone. The rate of formation varied over 38-fold in the 47
      human livers investigated and correlated with paclitaxel 6alpha-hydroxylation
      (P<0.001). Formation of these metabolites was inhibited significantly (>50%) by
      13-cis retinoic acid, a CYP2C8 inhibitor, but not by furafylline, quinidine or
      ketoconazole. In addition, both metabolites were produced by microsomes derived
      from a cell line transfected with human CYP2C8 cDNA. There was some evidence for 
      CYP2C9 playing a minor role in the metabolism of rosiglitazone. Sulphaphenazole
      caused limited inhibition (<30%) of both pathways in human liver microsomes and
      microsomes from cells transfected with CYP2C9 cDNA were able to mediate the
      metabolism of rosiglitazone, in particular the N-demethylation pathway, albeit at
      a much slower rate than CYP2C8. Rosiglitazone caused moderate inhibition of
      paclitaxel 6alpha-hydroxylase activity (CYP2C8; IC50=18 microm ), weak inhibition
      of tolbutamide hydroxylase activity (CYP2C9; IC50=50 microm ), but caused no
      marked inhibition of the other cytochrome P450 activities investigated (CYP1A2,
      2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A and 4A). Conclusion CYP2C8 is primarily responsible 
      for the hydroxylation and N-demethylation of rosiglitazone in human liver; with
      minor contributions from CYP2C9.

TI  - Absorption, metabolism and excretion of a single oral dose of (14)C-repaglinide
      during repaglinide multiple dosing.
PG  - 521-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The present study was designed to assess the disposition of
      (14)C-repaglinide in whole blood, plasma, urine and faeces, and to measure the
      total recovery of drug-related material in urine and faeces after a single 2-mg
      oral dose of (14)C-repaglinide during multiple dosing. METHODS: In this
      single-centre, open-label, phase-I trial, six healthy male volunteers received 2 
      mg of the prandial glucose regulator, repaglinide, four times daily for 13 days, 
      15 min before meals. On the morning of day 7, breakfast was omitted and the dose 
      was given as an oral solution containing 2 mg of (14)C-repaglinide. RESULTS:
      After oral dosing, a mean peak plasma concentration of repaglinide of 27.74 ng.
      ml(-1) (range: 16.84-36.65 ng. ml(-1)) was observed with a time to peak
      concentration of 0.5 h. Approximately 20% of repaglinide and its associated
      metabolites were distributed into red blood cells. No measurable
      (14)C-radioactivity was present in whole blood samples 6 h after dosing. Within
      96 h of dosing with (14)C-repaglinide, 90% of the administered dose appeared in
      the faeces and 8% was excreted in urine. In the plasma, the major compound was
      repaglinide (61%). In the urine, the major metabolites were unidentified polar
      compounds, the aromatic amine (M(1)) (24%), and the dicarboxylic acid (M(2))
      (22%). In the faeces, the major metabolite was M(2) (66% of administered dose).
      Therefore, repaglinide was excreted predominantly as metabolites and the major in
      vivo metabolite of repaglinide in humans was M(2). During regular dosing for 6
      days, the morning plasma trough levels of repaglinide were, with very few
      exceptions, almost always too low to measure, indicating the absence of
      accumulation at this dose of 2 mg four times daily. Repaglinide was well
      tolerated, and there were no episodes of hypoglycaemia. CONCLUSION: After oral
      dosing with repaglinide, the mean peak plasma concentration was rapidly attained 
      and, thereafter, plasma concentrations decreased promptly. The major route of
      excretion was via the faeces. These properties make repaglinide a suitable
      insulin secretagogue for all patients with type-2 diabetes who retain sufficient 
      beta-cell function.

TI  - Clinical pharmacokinetics of troglitazone.
PG  - 91-104
AB  - Troglitazone is a new thiazolidinedione oral antidiabetic agent approved for use 
      to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. It is rapidly
      absorbed with an absolute bioavailability of between 40 and 50%. Food increases
      the absorption by 30 to 80%. The pharmacokinetics of troglitazone are linear over
      the clinical dosage range of 200 to 600 mg once daily. The mean elimination
      half-life ranges from 7.6 to 24 hours, which facilitates a once daily
      administration regimen. The pharmacokinetics of troglitazone are similar between 
      patients with type 2 diabetes and healthy individuals. In humans, troglitazone
      undergoes metabolism by sulfation, glucuronidation and oxidation to form a
      sulfate conjugate (M1), glucuronide conjugate (M2) and quinone metabolite (M3),
      respectively. M1 and M3 are the major metabolites in plasma, and M2 is a minor
      metabolite. Age, gender, type 2 diabetes, renal impairment, smoking and race do
      not appear to influence the pharmacokinetics of troglitazone and its 2 major
      metabolites. In patients with hepatic impairment the plasma concentrations of
      troglitazone, M1 and M3 increase by 30%, 4-fold, and 2-fold, respectively.
      Cholestyramine decreases the absorption of troglitazone by 70%. Troglitazone may 
      enhance the activities of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A and/or transporter(s) thereby 
      reducing the plasma concentrations of terfenadine, cyclosporin, atorvastatin and 
      fexofenadine. It also reduces the plasma concentrations of the oral contraceptive
      hormones ethinylestradiol, norethindrone and levonorgestrel. Troglitazone does
      not alter the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, glibenclamide (glyburide) or
      paracetamol (acetaminophen). There is no pharmacodynamic interaction between
      troglitazone and warfarin or alcohol (ethanol). Pharmacodynamic modelling showed 
      that improvement in fasting glucose and triglyceride levels increased with dose
      from 200 to 600 mg. Knowledge of systemic troglitazone exposure within a dose
      group does not improve the prediction of glucose lowering response or adverse
      effects beyond those based on the administered dose.

TI  - The natural history of insulin secretory dysfunction and insulin resistance in
      the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 787-94
AB  - The pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes involves abnormalities in insulin action,
      insulin secretion, and endogenous glucose output (EGO). However, the sequence
      with which these abnormalities develop and their relative contributions to the
      deterioration in glucose tolerance remain unclear in the absence of a detailed
      longitudinal study. We measured insulin action, insulin secretion, and EGO
      longitudinally in 17 Pima Indians, in whom glucose tolerance deteriorated from
      normal (NGT) to impaired (IGT) to diabetic over 5.1 +/- 1.4 years. Transition
      from NGT to IGT was associated with an increase in body weight, a decline in
      insulin-stimulated glucose disposal, and a decline in the acute insulin secretory
      response (AIR) to intravenous glucose, but no change in EGO. Progression from IGT
      to diabetes was accompanied by a further increase in body weight, further
      decreases in insulin-stimulated glucose disposal and AIR, and an increase in
      basal EGO. Thirty-one subjects who retained NGT over a similar period also gained
      weight, but their AIR increased with decreasing insulin-stimulated glucose
      disposal. Thus, defects in insulin secretion and insulin action occur early in
      the pathogenesis of diabetes. Intervention to prevent diabetes should target both
      abnormalities.

TI  - Carnitine transport and its inhibition by sulfonylureas in human kidney proximal 
      tubular epithelial cells.
PG  - 1361-70
AB  - The kidney plays an important role in the homeostasis of carnitine by its ability
      to reabsorb carnitine almost completely from the glomerular filtrate. The
      transport process responsible for this reabsorption has been investigated thus
      far only in laboratory animals. Here we report on the characteristics of
      carnitine uptake in a proximal tubular epithelial cell line derived from human
      kidney. The uptake process was found to be obligatorily dependent on Na+ with no 
      involvement of anions. The process was saturable, with a Michaelis-Menten
      constant of 14 +/- 1 microM. The Na+:carnitine stoichiometry was 1:1. The same
      process also was found to be responsible for the uptake of acetylcarnitine and
      propionylcarnitine, two acyl esters of carnitine with potential for therapeutic
      use in humans. The uptake process was specific for carnitine and its acyl esters.
      Betaine, a structural analog of carnitine, interacted with the uptake process to 
      a significant extent. The present studies also showed that sulfonylureas, oral
      hypoglycemic agents currently used in the management of type 2 diabetes,
      inhibited the carnitine uptake system. Among the sulfonylureas tested,
      glibenclamide was the most potent inhibitor. The inhibition was competitive.
      Glibenclamide inhibited the uptake not only of carnitine but also of
      acetylcarnitine and propionylcarnitine. The inhibition most likely was the result
      of direct interaction of the compound with the carnitine transporter because the 
      inhibition could be demonstrated in purified rat kidney brush border membrane
      vesicles.

      mortality: the Honolulu Heart Program.
PG  - 1262-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The associations between glucose intolerance measured at the study
      entry date and the 23-year incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD), CHD
      mortality, and total mortality were examined at the Honolulu Heart Program.
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This prospective study followed a cohort of 8,006
      Japanese-American men who were 45-68 years old and living on the island of Oahu, 
      HI, in 1965. Baseline glucose was measured in a nonfasting state 1 h after a 50-g
      glucose load. History and use of medication for diabetes was obtained during an
      interview. The cohort was divided into four categories of glucose tolerance:
      low-normal, high-normal, asymptomatic hyperglycemia, and known diabetes. RESULTS:
      During the 23 years of follow-up, 864 incident cases of CHD, 384 deaths from CHD,
      and 2,166 total deaths occurred. The relative risks (RRs) were obtained using Cox
      proportional hazards modeling, with the low-normal category as a reference. The
      RRs were adjusted for age only, as well as for age, BMI, hypertension,
      cholesterol, triglycerides, smoking, alcohol, and a Japanese diet index. The
      age-adjusted and risk factor-adjusted RRs for all outcomes were significant for
      the asymptomatic hyperglycemic and known diabetes groups (P<0.05). The
      age-adjusted RRs for CHD incidence and total mortality were marginally
      significant in the high-normal group, but the RRs were not significant when
      adjusted for risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a dose-response
      relation of glucose intolerance at baseline with CHD incidence, CHD mortality,
      and total mortality, independent of other risk factors, in this cohort of
      middle-aged and older Japanese-American men.

TI  - Reduced glucose effectiveness as a feature of glucose intolerance: evidence in
      elderly type-2 diabetic subjects.
PG  - 169-75
AB  - One of the factors determining glucose tolerance is glucose disappearance
      independent from the dynamic insulin (glucose effectiveness); the debate on its
      role in the development of Type-2 diabetes is still open. The aim of the present 
      study was to evaluate insulin delivery, insulin sensitivity (SI), and glucose
      effectiveness (SG) in a group of elderly Type-2 diabetic patients (D, 4/6 F/M,
      age 67 +/- 2 years, 64 +/- 2 kg, BMI 23.8 +/- 0.5 kg/m2), compared to young
      controls (C, 4/6 F/M, 25 +/- 2 years, 72 +/- 4 kg, 23.7 +/- 1.1 kg/m2) and
      elderly controls (E, 2/4 F/M, 73 +/- 3 years, 63 +/- 4 kg, 23.1 +/- 0.5 kg/m2).
      We performed oral (OGTT) and intravenous (FSIGT) glucose tolerance tests. The
      OGTT showed that C and E were normotolerant, while D had a markedly reduced
      glucose tolerance. This was also confirmed in the FSIGT where the glucose
      tolerance index (KG) was 0.6 +/- 0.1% min-1 in D vs 1.8 +/- 0.2 in C and 1.5 +/- 
      0.2 in E (p < 0.0002). Total insulin area of D and the overall insulin delivery
      were not different from those of the control groups. The early phase area was
      instead significantly reduced (0.19 +/- 0.02 mU min/mL vs 0.61 +/- 0.06 of C and 
      0.46 +/- 0.06 of E, p < 0.001) given the reduction in the dynamic first-phase
      insulin delivery (0.86 +/- 0.17 min(microU/mL)/(mg/dL) vs 3.95 +/- 0.61 in C (p <
      0.005) and 2.61 +/- 0.66 (p < 0.001) in E). SI of D was 3.4 +/- 0.4 10(-4)
      min-1/(microU/mL), not different from that of C (4.7 +/- 0.6) and E (3.5 +/-
      0.2). This study showed a marked difference between SG of D and that of both
      control groups [0.010 +/- 0.001 min-1 vs 0.026 +/- 0.004 (p < 0.001) of C and
      0.020 +/- 0.003 (p < 0.002) of E], mostly due to the zero-insulin component GEZI 
      which was 0.006 +/- 0.001 in D vs 0.021 +/- 0.004 in C and 0.016 +/- 0.003 in E
      (p < 0.003). In the elderly groups, when taken together, SG exhibited a positive 
      correlation with the area under insulin concentration during the early phase and 
      with KG (r = 0.69, p = 0.0032 and r = 0.90, p = 0.0001, respectively),
      demonstrating the importance of the first-phase insulin delivery in modulating
      glucose effectiveness and glucose tolerance.

      Association diagnostic criteria. The DECODE study group. European Diabetes
      Epidemiology Group. Diabetes Epidemiology: Collaborative analysis Of Diagnostic
      criteria in Europe.
PG  - 617-21
AB  - BACKGROUND: The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommend that fasting
      glucose alone with the oral glucose tolerance test should be used to diagnose
      diabetes mellitus. We assessed mortality associated with the ADA fasting-glucose 
      criteria compared with the WHO 2 h post-challenge glucose criteria. METHODS: We
      assessed baseline data on glucose concentrations at fasting and 2 h after the 75 
      g oral glucose tolerance test from 13 prospective European cohort studies, which 
      included 18,048 men and 7316 women aged 30 years or older. Mean follow-up was 7.3
      years. We assessed the risk of death according to the different diagnostic
      glucose categories. FINDINGS: Compared with men who had normal fasting glucose (<
      6.1 mmol/L), men with newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus by the ADA fasting
      criteria (> or = 7.0 mmol/L) had a hazard ratio for death of 1.81 (95% CI
      1.49-2.20); for women the hazard ratio was 1.79 (1.18-2.69). For impaired fasting
      glucose (6.1-6.9 mmol/L), the hazard ratios were 1.21 (1.05-1.41) and 1.08
      (0.70-1.66). For the WHO criteria (> or = 11.1 mmol/L), the ratios for newly
      diagnosed diabetes were 2.02 (1.66-2.46) in men and 2.77 (1.96-3.92) in women,
      and for impaired glucose tolerance (7.8-11.1 mmol/L) were 1.51 (1.32-1.72) and
      1.60 (1.22-2.10). Within each fasting-glucose classification, mortality increased
      with increasing 2 h glucose. However, for 2 h glucose classifications of impaired
      glucose tolerance, and diabetes, there was no trend for increasing fasting
      glucose concentrations. INTERPRETATION: Fasting-glucose concentrations alone do
      not identify individuals at increased risk of death associated with
      hyperglycaemia. The oral glucose tolerance test provides additional prognostic
      information and enables detection of individuals with impaired glucose tolerance,
      who have the greatest attributable risk of death.

TI  - Hypoglycemia associated with high doses of sertraline and sulphonylurea compound 
      in a noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patient.
PG  - 12-4
AB  - Unlike other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), sertraline has
      linear pharmacokinetics so that increases in dose lead to proportional increases 
      in drug concentration. The half-life of sertraline is about 26 h so that it
      reaches a steady state in one week, according to the product monograph.
      Hypoglycemia associated with sertraline and coadministration of oral
      hypoglycemics belonging to the sulphonylurea derivatives has rarely been
      reported. A patient with schizoaffective disorder with non-insulin-dependent
      diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) treated with sertraline, risperidone and glyburide who 
      developed hypoglycemia is presented. The article highlights that inhibition of
      P450 enzymes can be affected by several different factors. Interactions are
      possible whenever a patient concomitantly receives two drugs that bind to the
      same P450 system Greater inhibition was likely induced at doses higher than those
      recommended. This process was reversed within 10 days of discontinuing the
      sertraline. Good glycemic control followed discontinuation of psychotropic drugs 
      and the oral hypoglycemic agent. Knowledge of the individual P450 enzymes is
      important in the metabolism of individual drugs, together with an understanding
      of the patient's drug metabolizing ability. These factors may lead to more
      appropriate prescribing and further research into specific P450 enzymes
      responsible for metabolism of particular drugs, which remains unclear.

TI  - Effects of combination of insulin and acarbose compared with insulin and
      gliclazide in type 2 diabetic patients.
PG  - 93-7
AB  - In this prospective study we aimed to compare insulin plus acarbose with insulin 
      plus gliclazide with respect to their effect on insulin requirement, lipid
      profiles and body mass index (BMI) while achieving good glycemic control. Forty
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were on conventional insulin therapy
      (subcutaneous insulin therapy consisting of regular and NPH insulin, two times a 
      day) were included in the study. They were randomized to double blind treatment
      with insulin in combination with gliclazide or acarbose for 6 months. For both
      groups, acceptable glycemic control was achieved at the end of study period. The 
      mean HbA(1c) levels decreased from 8.32+/-0.26 to 7.13+/-0.18% in acarbose group 
      and 8. 6+/-0.15 to 7.48+/-0.21% in the gliclazide group. The difference between
      groups was not significant (P 0.29). In the acarbose group, total cholesterol and
      LDL concentration decreased significantly while other parameters did not change. 
      In the gliclazide group, HDL levels decreased significantly from 46.6+/-2.48
      mg/dl to 41.3+/-2.09 mg/dl (P 0.001) BMI increased significantly from
      27.60+/-1.21 kg/m(2) to 28.69+/-1.26 kg/m(2). (P 0.003) Total daily insulin dose 
      was not changed in the acarbose group significantly, but increased from
      42.6+/-2.73 to 49.27+/-3.58 U/day, which was significant in gliclazide group of
      (P 0.016). In the acarbose group, there were no significant differences between
      responders and nonresponders with respect to fasting and stimulated C-peptide,
      HbA(1c) levels and baseline BMI values. But in the gliclazide group, baseline BMI
      values were significantly higher in the nonresponding group compared to
      responders (P 0.02). In conclusion, combination of insulin with acarbose can be a
      good alternative for type 2 diabetic patients on insulin therapy; seems more
      beneficial than combination with gliclazide; may have advantage of achieving good
      glycemic control without increasing insulin dose and BMI; also may have the
      advantage of providing a decrease in LDL level, which are all important to
      prevent atherosclerosis.

TI  - Type 2 diabetes: an overview.
PG  - 1339-45
AB  - Type 2 diabetes is a heterogeneous disorder. Clinical expression of the disorder 
      requires both genetic and environmental factors. One theory concerning its
      etiology is that it is the result of the evolution of a thrifty genotype that had
      survival benefits in the past but is detrimental in the current environment. An
      opposing theory is that it represents an adult metabolic response to fetal
      malnutrition. Hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes results from absolute or relative 
      insulin deficiency. Most often relative insulin deficiency is attributable to an 
      inability to adequately compensate for insulin resistance. Insulin resistance may
      be caused by a variety of genetic or metabolic factors. The most common
      etiological factor in insulin resistance is central obesity. Insulin resistance
      is associated with a cluster of metabolic abnormalities that include glucose
      intolerance, hypertension, a unique dyslipidemia, a procoagulant state, and an
      increase in macrovascular disease. Clinical intervention studies have
      demonstrated that reduction in the chronic microvascular and macrovascular
      complications of type 2 diabetes requires treatment of hyperglycemia to achieve
      hemoglobin A1c <7.0%, blood pressure </=130/80 mmHg, and plasma LDL-cholesterol
      </=2.6 mmol/L (</=100 mg/dL). Oral antihyperglycemic agents increase endogenous
      insulin secretion, decrease insulin resistance, or lower postprandial plasma
      glucose rise by delaying absorption of complex carbohydrates. Long-term glycemic 
      control in type 2 diabetes requires progressive, stepwise, combination treatment 
      with oral agents and eventually combination treatment with oral agents and
      insulin.

TI  - Clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of bromfenac.
PG  - 399-408
AB  - Bromfenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug whose peak plasma
      concentration is reached 0.5 hours after oral administration. Bromfenac binds
      extensively to plasma albumin. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve
      is linearly proportional to the dose for oral doses up to 150 mg. The
      relationship between the total plasma and analgesic effect has been established. 
      Only small amounts of bromfenac are eliminated unchanged, with the remaining drug
      being biotransformed into glucuronide metabolites which are excreted in urine and
      bile. Rapid elimination occurs in healthy individuals (half-life 0.5 to 4.0 h).
      Renal disease, hepatic disease and aging alter the disposition kinetics of
      bromfenac, and dosage adjustment may be advisable. Bromfenac modestly decreases
      free phenytoin concentrations. Bromfenac can cause idiosyncratic hepatic toxicity
      and has been withdrawn by its manufacturer pending further investigation of these
      case reports.

TI  - Late recovery of ventricular function in children with idiopathic dilated
      cardiomyopathy.
PG  - 334-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prognosis for children with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy
      (IDC) is variable. Patients who fail to exhibit improvement in left ventricular
      (LV) function have a high 1-year mortality rate, whereas improvement in LV
      fractional shortening (LVFS) to >15% is associated with better survival. However,
      complete recovery of LV performance to normal has not been examined. METHODS AND 
      RESULTS: The clinical features and echocardiograms of 63 children with IDC were
      reviewed. Sixteen patients (group 1) were identified who demonstrated progressive
      improvement in LVFS, ultimately recovering to within the normal range. They were 
      compared with 47 patients (group 2) in whom LVFS remained depressed. Group 1 LVFS
      at first examination was 13.6% +/- 5.1%, z = -10.8 +/- 4.0, and improved to
      within the normal range (33.7% +/- 3.4%, z = -0.9 +/- 1. 4, P <.001). Group 2
      initial LVFS was 13.6 +/- 2.3, z = -8.9 +/- 3.2 and did not change significantly 
      (15.7% +/- 7.3%, z = -7.3 +/- 1.6). The LV was dilated at initial examination in 
      all patients (z = 6.9 +/- 3.0). Recovery in group 1 was associated with a
      decrease in LV dimension to within the normal range (z = 1.3 +/- 1.6, P <.001),
      whereas the LV dimension in group 2 patients remained increased (z = 6.2 +/-
      3.4). The mean follow-up time at which LV function was noted to be normal was 4.5
      +/- 3.6 years (range 0.3 to 14 years). The total duration of follow-up was 6.5
      +/- 5.2 years (range 1 to 16 years). CONCLUSIONS: Complete recovery of LV
      function is possible in children with IDC. Recovery may occur within the first
      year after initial examination in some patients, but longer periods are needed in
      the majority of patients in whom LV function ultimately returned to normal.

TI  - High-dose biotin, an inducer of glucokinase expression, may synergize with
      chromium picolinate to enable a definitive nutritional therapy for type II
      diabetes.
PG  - 401-6
AB  - Glucokinase (GK), expressed in hepatocyte and pancreatic beta cells, has a
      central regulatory role in glucose metabolism. Efficient GK activity is required 
      for normal glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, postprandial hepatic glucose
      uptake, and the appropriate suppression of hepatic glucose output and
      gluconeogenesis by elevated plasma glucose. Hepatic GK activity is subnormal in
      diabetes, and GK may also be decreased in the beta cells of type II diabetics. In
      supraphysiological concentrations, biotin promotes the transcription and
      translation of the GK gene in hepatocytes; this effect appears to be mediated by 
      activation of soluble guanylate cyclase. More recent evidence indicates that
      biotin likewise increases GK activity in islet cells. On the other hand,
      high-dose biotin suppresses hepatocyte transcription of phosphoenolpyruvate
      carboxykinase, the rate-limiting enzyme for gluconeogenesis. Administration of
      high-dose biotin has improved glycemic control in several diabetic animals
      models, and a recent Japanese clinical study concludes that biotin (3 mg t.i.d.
      orally) can substantially lower fasting glucose in type II diabetics, without
      side-effects. The recently demonstrated utility of chromium picolinate in type II
      diabetes appears to reflect improved peripheral insulin sensitivity--a parameter 
      which is unlikely to be directly influenced by biotin. Thus, the joint
      administration of supranutritional doses of biotin and chromium picolinate is
      likely to combat insulin resistance, improve beta-cell function, enhance
      postprandial glucose uptake by both liver and skeletal muscle, and inhibit
      excessive hepatic glucose production. Conceivably, this safe, convenient,
      nutritional regimen will constitute a definitive therapy for many type II
      diabetics, and may likewise be useful in the prevention and management of
      gestational diabetes. Biotin should also aid glycemic control in type I patients.

TI  - Vasodilatory effects of troglitazone improve blood pressure at rest and during
      mental stress in type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 83-8
AB  - The present study examined the hemodynamic mechanisms of blood pressure (BP)
      lowering by troglitazone in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) at rest
      and during a mental arithmetic test (MAT). Twenty-two patients with DM with
      normal to high-normal BP and 12 controls matched for age, gender, glucose
      tolerance, and BP were studied. DM subjects showed significantly higher systolic 
      BP response during MAT than controls (157 versus 139 mm Hg; P<0.01). All 22 DM
      patients and 5 of 12 controls had systolic BP >140 mm Hg during MAT. Heart rate
      and diastolic BP were not significantly different between the 2 groups. The DM
      group was then randomized to receive troglitazone (n=10; 400 mg/d) or glyburide
      (n=12; 20 mg/d). MAT was repeated after 6 months of treatment. Both treatments
      reduced glucose equally (-1.7 mmol/L for troglitazone and -1.5 mmol/L for
      glyburide), but only troglitazone reduced insulin (-15 microU/mL; P<0.001) and
      C-peptide (-0.9 ng/mL; P<0.02) levels. Troglitazone significantly reduced BP at
      baseline (P<0.05) and systolic BP response to MAT (P<0.01), whereas glyburide did
      not affect BP at baseline or during MAT. Stroke volume and cardiac output did not
      change with either drug, but troglitazone decreased peripheral vascular
      resistance (-112 dyne. s. cm(-5); P<0.05). Improved insulin resistance rather
      than an improved glycemic control is associated with lower resting and stress BP 
      values in patients with DM. A reduction in vascular resistance may be a primary
      hemodynamic mechanism of the manner in which troglitazone lowers BP. Insulin
      sensitizers may offer potential therapeutic advantage in subjects with DM with
      elevated BP.

TI  - Rosiglitazone.
PG  - 921-30; discussion 931-2
AB  - Rosiglitazone, a thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agent, improves insulin
      resistance, a key underlying metabolic abnormality in most patients with type 2
      (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. In animal models of insulin
      resistance, rosiglitazone decreased plasma glucose, insulin and triglyceride
      levels and also attenuated or prevented diabetic nephropathy and pancreatic islet
      cell degeneration. In contrast with troglitazone, rosiglitazone does not induce
      cytochrome P4503A4 metabolism. It does not interact significantly with
      nifedipine, oral contraceptives, metformin, digoxin, ranitidine or acarbose. In
      clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, rosiglitazone 2 to 12 
      mg/day (as a single daily dose or 2 divided daily doses) improved glycaemic
      control, as shown by decreases in fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated
      haemoglobin (HbA1c). Addition of rosiglitazone 2 to 8 mg/day to existing
      sulphonylurea, metformin or insulin therapy achieved further reductions in
      fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c. Oral combinations improved insulin sensitivity 
      and beta-cell function according to a homeostasis model assessment. Consistent
      with its mechanism of action, rosiglitazone appears to be associated with a low
      risk of hypoglycaemia (<2% of patients receiving monotherapy). There is no
      evidence to date that rosiglitazone shares the hepatotoxicity of troglitazone.

TI  - Effect of troglitazone on body fat distribution in type 2 diabetic patients.
PG  - 908-12
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Troglitazone was recently reported to specifically promote the
      differentiation of pre-adipocytes into adipocytes in vitro in subcutaneous fat
      only, indicating a relation to insulin-resistance-improving action of
      troglitazone. To expand on this finding, we investigated at the clinical level
      how long-term administration of troglitazone influences the body fat distribution
      in type 2 diabetic patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Troglitazone (400
      mg/day) was administered for 6 months to 30 type 2 diabetic patients whose
      glycemic control was poor. A total of 18 patients received diet therapy alone (in
      the single-treatment group, BMI 26.0 +/- 4.6, HbA1c 8.2 +/- 1.7%), and 12
      patients concomitantly received glibenclamide (1.25-7.5 mg/day) (in the
      concomitant sulfonylurea group, BMI 25.4 +/- 4.7, HbA1c 9.2 +/- 1.2%). BMI,
      HbA1c, serum lipid level, and body fat distribution, which were determined by
      computed tomography (CT) scan at the umbilical level, were measured and compared 
      before and after troglitazone treatment. RESULTS: During the 6-month troglitazone
      treatment, HbA1c levels decreased and BMI increased in both groups. As for body
      fat distribution in the single-treatment group, visceral fat area (VFA) decreased
      (from 118.3 +/- 54.3 to 101.1 +/- 50.8 cm2; P < 0.001), and subcutaneous fat area
      (SFA) increased (from 189.7 +/- 93.3 to 221.6 +/- 101.6 cm2; P < 0.001),
      resulting in a decrease in visceral/subcutaneous (V/S) ratio (from 0.74 +/- 0.48 
      to 0.50 +/- 0.32; P < 0.001). In the concomitant sulfonylurea group, VFA was
      unchanged (from 108.1 +/- 53.5 to 112.5 +/- 59.9 cm2), while SFA increased (from 
      144.6 +/- 122.0 to 180.5 +/- 143.5 cm2; P < 0.01), thereby decreasing the V/S
      ratio (from 0.91 +/- 0.46 to 0.77 +/- 0.44; P < 0.01). The serum triglyceride
      level and the area under glucose curve during the 75-g oral glucose tolerance
      test decreased significantly in the single-treatment group. CONCLUSIONS:
      According to our data, troglitazone appears to promote fat accumulation in the
      subcutaneous adipose tissue rather than in the visceral adipose tissue in mildly 
      obese Japanese people with type 2 diabetes. This shift of energy accumulation
      from the visceral to subcutaneous adipose tissue may greatly contribute to the
      troglitazone-mediated amelioration of insulin resistance.

TI  - [Morning blood glucose determination in the monitoring of metabolic control in
      type 2 elderly diabetic cases treated by oral hypoglycemic agents].
PG  - 122-7
AB  - Daily blood glucose profiles were measured in 163 Type 2 elderly diabetic cases
      to evaluate whether a fasting (before breakfast) or a post-prandial (after
      breakfast) blood glucose concentration is able to predict blood glucose values
      throughout the day. In the diet-treated alone group (n = 61), the percentage of
      daily blood glucose profiles having plasma glucose values less than the 08:00
      hours (before breakfast) value were as follows: 59.0%, 32.8%, 59.0%, and 55.7% at
      18.00 (before supper), 24.00, 03.00, 06.00 hours, respectively. In group treated 
      by oral hypoglycemic agents (OHA) (n = 102), these were as follows: 45.1%, 26.5%,
      52.9%, and 67.6%, respectively. In the OHA group, the mean plasma glucose value
      at 08:00 hours was significantly higher in patients with the lowest plasma
      glucose levels between 60-79 mg/dl than in patients with these levels between
      80-99 mg/dl (103.7 +/- 19.6 vs 118.7 +/- 16.9 mg/dl, p < 0.01), but that at 10:00
      hours was similar in the two groups (218.8 +/- 43.9 vs 214.5 +/- 40.1 mg/dl). In 
      patients with lowest plasma glucose levels of between 60-99 mg/dl, the 08:00
      hours value correlated positively with that of 24:00 (r = 0.40), 03.00 (r =
      0.53), and the 06.00 hours value (r = 0.69), but no correlation was observed with
      the 18.00 hours value. On the other hand, the 10:00 hours value was not
      associated with these time-points values. Our results reveal that before
      breakfast plasma glucose values are more predictive of low blood glucose values
      in the night during sleep than after-breakfast blood glucose values, but do not
      predict low blood glucose values before supper in patients on OHA.

TI  - Effect of oral antidiabetic agents on plasma amylin level in patients with
      non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (type 2).
PG  - 330-4
AB  - The purpose of the study was the comparison of the effect of the oral therapy of 
      non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) with either a sulphonylurea or
      biguanide derivative on plasma amylin level. In 10 healthy individuals the
      fasting plasma amylin level was 1.56 +/- 0.27 pmol/l (mean +/- SEM) and 6 min
      after i.v. injection of 1 mg glucagon a fourfold increase was observed. In 10
      patients with NIDDM receiving glibenclamide (CAS 10238-21-8) the fasting plasma
      amylin level was twofold higher than in healthy control (2.72 +/- 0.38 pmol/l; p 
      < 0.025) but following glucagon administration it increased only twofold. In 15
      patients treated with metformin (CAS 657-24-9) the fasting plasma amylin level
      was similar to that in healthy individuals (1.64 +/- 0.25 pmol/l), but after
      glucagon stimulation the increment of plasma amylin was minimal and the relevant 
      mean value was significantly lower when compared with those in healthy
      individuals and with NIDDM patients treated with glibenclamide. In 10 untreated
      obese patients with newly diagnosed NIDDM the administration of glibenclamide (14
      days) resulted in the increase of basal (2.47 +/- 0.23 and 3.16 +/- 0.29 pmol/l; 
      p < 0.1), and glucagon stimulated (3.34 +/- 0.39 and 4.56 +/- 0.38; p < 0.05)
      plasma amylin concentrations, whereas other 10 patients receiving metformin
      showed a decrease in fasting plasma level of this peptide before (2.64 +/- 0.59
      and 1.28 +/- 0.38 pmol/l; p < 0.1), and after glucagon injection (5.02 +/- 0.55
      and 2.83 +/- 0.65 pmol/l; p < 0.02). With the respect to the trophic effect of
      amyloid deposits in the pancreatic islets and to a hypothetic effect of amylin
      increasing insulin resistance, the present results emphasize the particular
      usefulness of metformin in the pharmacological treatment of NIDDM. All
      contraindications and side effects of metformin should be taken into account
      before drug administration.

      metaregression analysis of published data from 20 studies of 95,783 individuals
      followed for 12.4 years.
PG  - 233-40
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between nondiabetic glucose levels and
      cardio vascular risk. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Three independent searches
      using MEDLINE (1966-1996), followed by a manual search of the references from
      each retrieved article, were conducted by two physicians and one medical
      librarian. Data had to be reported in at least three quantiles or intervals so
      that the nature of the relationship between glucose and cardiovascular events
      (i.e., linear or nonlinear) could be explored, and to ensure that any incremental
      cardiovascular risk was consistent across quantiles or intervals. RESULTS:
      Analyzed studies comprised 95,783 people (94% male) who had 3,707 cardiovascular 
      events over 12.4 years (1,193,231 person-years). Studies reporting fasting
      glucose levels (n = 6), 2-h glucose levels (n = 7), 1-h glucose levels (n = 5),
      and casual glucose levels (n = 4) were included. The glucose load used varied
      from 50 to 100 g. The highest glucose interval for most studies included glucose 
      values in the diabetic range. The relationship between glucose levels and the
      risk of a cardiovascular event was modeled for each study and the
      beta-coefficients were combined. Compared with a glucose level of 4.2 mmol/l (75 
      mg/dl), a fasting and 2-h glucose level of 6.1 mmol/dl (110 mg/dl) and 7.8 mmol/l
      (140 mg/dl) was associated with a relative cardiovascular event risk of 1.33 (95%
      CI 1.06-1.67) and 1.58 (95% CI 1.19-2.10), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The
      progressive relationship between glucose levels and cardiovascular risk extends
      below the diabetic threshold.

TI  - The effect of gliclazide on plasma insulin, intact and 32/33 split proinsulin in 
      South Asian subjects with Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 142-6
AB  - AIMS: Previous studies have shown that in Caucasian subjects with Type 2 diabetes
      mellitus (DM), the sulphonylurea glibenclamide increased insulin secretion
      without causing an increase in 32/33 split proinsulin secretion. South Asian
      subjects with Type 2 DM are thought to be more insulin resistant and the effect
      of sulphonylureas may be different. We therefore investigated the effect of
      sulphonylurea therapy with gliclazide on beta-cell function in South Asian
      subjects with newly diagnosed Type 2 DM. METHODS: Glucose, insulin, and intact
      and 32/33 split proinsulin were measured at diagnostic oral glucose tolerance
      test (OGTT). After 8-12 weeks on a conventional diet, subjects with a fasting
      glucose > 6 mmol/l (n = 16) were commenced on gliclazide. RESULTS: At diagnosis, 
      those requiring gliclazide were more hyperglycaemic but there was no difference
      in weight or fasting insulin concentration than in the diet group. Following
      diet, in the gliclazide group, weight fell (P < 0.04) with no change in fasting
      glucose concentration. Fasting intact proinsulin, insulin and 32/33 split
      proinsulin remained unchanged. After gliclazide therapy weight remained
      unchanged, but fasting glucose fell (P < 0.003). Fasting insulin and intact
      proinsulin remained unchanged but 32/33 split proinsulin fell (P < 0.05). Fasting
      insulin to glucose ratio significantly improved after gliclazide (P < 0.006).
      CONCLUSIONS: In South Asian subjects treated with gliclazide the reduction in
      fasting glucose concentrations appears to be due to an improvement in insulin
      sensitivity as well as in beta-cell function.

TI  - Sulfonylureas and ischaemic preconditioning; a double-blind, placebo-controlled
      evaluation of glimepiride and glibenclamide.
PG  - 439-46
AB  - AIMS: Glimepiride is a new sulfonylurea for diabetes treatment which is supposed 
      to impact less on extra-pancreatic ATP-dependent K+ channels than the
      conventional drug glibenclamide. This study was performed to evaluate whether
      this results in a better maintenance of ATP-dependent K+ channel mediated
      ischaemic myocardial preconditioning. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a double-blind
      placebo-controlled study the period of total coronary occlusion during balloon
      angioplasty of high grade coronary artery stenoses was used as a model to compare
      the effects of both drugs. Quantification of myocardial ischaemia was achieved by
      recording the intracoronary ECG and the time to the occurrence of angina during
      vessel occlusion. All patients underwent three dilatations. The first dilatation 
      (dilatation 1) served to determine the severity of ischaemia during vessel
      occlusion. During dilatation 2, baseline values were recorded. Thereafter,
      glimepiride (15 patients: 1.162 mg), glibenclamide (15 patients: 2.54 mg) or
      placebo (15 patients) were intravenously administered over 12 min. Dilatation 3
      started 10 min after the beginning of the drug administration. Mean ST segment
      shifts in the placebo group decreased by 35% (dilatation 2: 0.23; dilatation
      3:0.15 mV; CI -0.55 to 0.00 mV; P=0.049). A similar reduction also occurred in
      the glimepiride group, in which repetitive balloon occlusion led to a 34%
      reduction (dilatation 2: 0.35; dilatation 3: 0.23 mV; CI -0.21 to -0.02 mV;
      P=0.01). There was little influence however, on mean ST segment shifts in the
      glibenclamide group (dilatation 2 and dilatation 3: 0.24 mV; CI -0.10 to 0.25 mV;
      P=0.34). Accordingly, time to angina during balloon occlusion slightly increased 
      (by 30%) in the placebo group (dilatation 2: 37 s; dilatation 3: 48 s; CI 0.0 to 
      15.0 s; P=0.16); increased by 13% in the glimepiride group (dilatation 2: 40 s;
      dilatation 3: 45 s; CI 0.0 to 14.0 s; P=0023); and remained unchanged in the
      glibenclamide group (dilatation 2 and dilatation 3: 30 s; CI -7.5 to 7.5 s;
      P=0.67). CONCLUSION: These results show that glimepiride maintains myocardial
      preconditioning, while glibenclamide might be able to prevent it.

TI  - Troglitazone: a review of its use in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 409-38
AB  - Troglitazone is the first of a new group of oral antidiabetic drugs, the
      thiazolidinediones, and is indicated for the treatment of patients with type 2
      (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. Troglitazone acts by enhancing the
      effects of insulin at peripheral target sites and, unlike the sulphonylurea
      drugs, is not associated with hypoglycaemia when administered as monotherapy.
      Clinical trials with troglitazone (usually 200 to 600 mg/day) in patients with
      type 2 diabetes mellitus consistently showed marked improvement in glycaemic
      control, as well as reductions in fasting serum insulin, C-peptide and
      triglyceride levels. Comparative studies with either glibenclamide (glyburide) or
      metformin indicated similar glycaemic control with troglitazone or these agents. 
      Serum insulin levels were lower with troglitazone than with glibenclamide.
      Clinical trials of up to approximately 2 years' duration showed that glycaemic
      control is maintained with troglitazone on a long term basis. In general,
      troglitazone is well tolerated by the majority of patients. However,
      discontinuation of troglitazone because of elevated liver enzyme levels occurs in
      approximately 2% of patients receiving the drug, and frequent monitoring of liver
      enzymes is required (e.g. at least 11 times during the first year of therapy).
      Among patients who started troglitazone therapy in 1998 (after the incorporation 
      of a boxed warning and increased monitoring requirements in the product
      labelling), the estimated risk of liver-related death is approximately 1 in
      100,000. CONCLUSIONS: Troglitazone improves the ability of target cells to
      respond to insulin. The drug has been shown to improve glycaemic control in
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus when used as monotherapy or in combination
      with other oral antidiabetic drugs or insulin, and its efficacy is similar to
      that of glibenclamide or metformin. Although troglitazone is generally well
      tolerated, close monitoring of liver enzyme function is required to minimise the 
      rare occurrence of serious hepatic dysfunction. Drug acquisition and liver
      function monitoring costs, as well as potential adverse effects, are important
      factors that may ultimately determine the precise place of troglitazone in the
      management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Nevertheless, as the first member of a
      new class of oral antidiabetic agents, the thiazolidinediones, troglitazone
      offers an effective treatment option in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
      through its action of improving insulin sensitivity.

TI  - [Short-term intensive insulin therapy as a method of overcoming secondary failure
      of sulfonylureas in patients with type 2 diabetes (non-insulin-dependent)].
PG  - 442-51
AB  - The study group comprised 56 patients (25 males and 31 females) with type 2
      diabetes in whom the secondary failure to sulphonylurea derivates (SU) had
      developed. All patients were submitted for 14 days to therapy with 5 injections
      of insulin per day in total dose of insulin permitting to decrease the mean daily
      glycaemia below 8.8 mmol/l (160 mg/dl). After the termination of the intensive
      insulin therapy (IIT) the patients with insulin requirement below 44 U daily were
      alternatively qualified to treatment with SU (glybenclamide) alone or with this
      SU plus biguanide derivate (BG: phenformin), and those who needed more than 44 U 
      daily continued conventional therapy with insulin alone or with insulin plus SU
      (glybenclamide). There was a marked reduction of fasting and postprandial blood
      glucose during the IIT and over the subsequent 15 months of the follow-up. The
      mean glycaemia which initially was in fasting state 12.5 +/- 2.4 mmol/l (225 +/- 
      43 mg/dl) and 2 hours after breakfast 18.1 +/- 2.8 mmol/l (325 +/- 50 mg/dl)
      decreased significantly and was in four groups between 8.0 +/- 0.3 mmol/l (144
      +/- 5 mg/dl) and 10.8 +/- 0.5 mmol/l (194 +/- 9 mg/dl) in fasting state and
      between 10.5 +/- 0.3 (189 +/- 5 mg/dl) and 11.2 +/- 0.4 mmol/l (201 +/- 7 mg/dl) 
      after breakfast. The least hypoglycaemic effect was found in patients who after
      IIT were treated exclusively with insulin (mean daily dose 53 +/- 2 IU) while the
      decrease of glycaemia was most evident in patients treated with SU given as a
      single drug or in combination with BG or with insulin (mean daily dose 19 +/- 1
      IU). In all studied patients basal and stimulated (1 mg glucagon i.v.) C-peptide 
      secretion markedly decreased during IIT, and greatly increased after its
      termination, and this increase persisted over following 15 months of observation,
      correlating with the initial values. CONCLUSIONS: The short-term IIT in patients 
      with NIDDM and secondary failure to SU is effective in reducing hyperglycaemia,
      and in most of them makes possible to continue the oral antidiabetic treatment
      with SU. The secretion of endogenous insulin seems to have only limited influence
      on the metabolic control of the patients treated with four different
      pharmacological regiments after IIT.

TI  - Comparison of bedtime insulin regimens in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
      A randomized, controlled trial.
PG  - 389-96
AB  - BACKGROUND: Compared with other insulin regimens, combination therapy with oral
      hypoglycemic agents and bedtime insulin produces similar improvement in glycemic 
      control but induces less weight gain. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether bedtime
      insulin regimens differ with respect to their effects on weight gain in patients 
      with type 2 diabetes. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: Four
      outpatient clinics at central hospitals. PATIENTS: 96 patients (mean age, 58 +/- 
      1 years; mean body mass index, 29 +/- 1 kg/m2) whose type 2 diabetes was poorly
      controlled with sulfonylurea therapy (mean glycosylated hemoglobin value, 9.9%
      +/- 0.2%; mean fasting plasma glucose level, 11.9 +/- 0.3 mmol/L [214 +/- 5
      mg/dL]). INTERVENTION: Random assignment to 1 year of treatment with bedtime
      intermediate-acting insulin plus glyburide (10.5 mg) and placebo, metformin (2 g)
      and placebo, glyburide and metformin, or a second injection of
      intermediate-acting insulin in the morning. Patients were taught to adjust the
      bedtime insulin dose on the basis of fasting glucose measurements. MEASUREMENTS: 
      Body weight, biochemical and symptomatic hypoglycemias, and indices of glycemic
      control. RESULTS: At 1 year, body weight remained unchanged in patients receiving
      bedtime insulin plus metformin (mean change, 0.9 +/- 1.2 kg; P < 0.001 compared
      with all other groups) but increased by 3.9 +/- 0.7 kg, 3.6 +/- 1.2 kg, and 4.6
      +/- 1.0 kg in patients receiving bedtime insulin plus glyburide, those receiving 
      bedtime insulin plus both oral drugs, and those receiving bedtime and morning
      insulin, respectively. The greatest decrease in the glycosylated hemoglobin value
      was observed in the bedtime insulin and metformin group (from 9.7% +/- 0.4% to
      7.2% +/- 0.2% [difference, -2.5 +/- 0.4 percentage points] at 1 year; P < 0.001
      compared with 0 months and P < 0.05 compared with other groups). This group also 
      had significantly fewer symptomatic and biochemical cases of hypoglycemia (P <
      0.05) than the other groups. CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy with bedtime
      insulin plus metformin prevents weight gain. This regimen also seems superior to 
      other bedtime insulin regimens with respect to improvement in glycemic control
      and frequency of hypoglycemia.

TI  - Efficacy of combined treatments in NIDDM patients with secondary failure to
      sulphonylureas. Is it predictable?
PG  - 744-7
AB  - The treatment of NIDDM patients with secondary failure to sulphonylurea is a
      common problem. We performed a crossover study in 50 NIDDM patients with
      secondary failure to glibenclamide by comparing the addition to sulphonylurea of 
      either a low-dose bedtime NPH insulin or a t.i.d. oral metformin and by analyzing
      treatment efficacy in relation to patient and disease characteristics. Both
      combined therapies clearly improved glycaemic control. HbA1 c were similarly
      reduced by the addition of either bedtime NPH insulin (7.6+/-0.34 vs 8.7+/-0.35, 
      p<0.01) or metformin (7.6+/-0.22 vs 8.6+/-0.31, p<0.01). Also fasting plasma
      glucose (FPG) and post-prandial plasma glucose (PPPG) significantly decreased
      (p<0.01) with both treatments. Bed-time NPH insulin was more effective on FPG
      reduction than metformin (-36+/-2% vs -25+/-2%, p<0.01); in contrast, metformin
      addition was more effective on PPPG reduction than bedtime NPH insulin addition
      (-30+/-2% vs 20+/-3%, p<0.01). Serum cholesterol was marginally but significantly
      decreased after metformin (5.49+/-0.19 vs 5.91 +/-0.18 mM, p<0.05) but not after 
      NPH insulin. Body weight increase was significantly greater after insulin
      addition than after metformin (1.47+/-0.25 Kg vs 0.64+/-0.17 p=0.02). All
      patients preferred the addition of metformin rather than NPH insulin. None of the
      measured clinical and metabolic variables (before treatment FPG and PPPG, HbA1 c,
      post-glucagon C-peptide levels, insulin sensitivity, patient age, BMI and
      diabetes duration) significantly correlated to the efficacy of the two combined
      treatments studied. In conclusion, in NIDDM patients with secondary failure to
      sulphonylureas the addition of either low-dose bedtime NPH insulin or t.i.d.
      metformin is similarly effective in improving glycaemic control. Metformin is
      better accepted by patients and provides a modest advantage in terms of body
      weight and cholesterol levels. The most common clinical and metabolic variables
      are not useful for predicting the efficacy of these two combined treatments.

TI  - Effects of regular insulin or insulin LISPRO on glucose metabolism after an oral 
      glucose load in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 523-8
AB  - Seven obese Type 2 diabetic patients were studied for two 4-h periods after
      ingestion of a glucose load to determine the effects of preprandial subcutaneous 
      injection of Insulin Lispro (5 min before the meal) or regular insulin (20 min
      before the meal) on glucose metabolism. Glucose production and utilisation were
      measured using a dual isotope method. After Lispro, the mean postprandial
      increase in plasma glucose was 29% lower and the increase in insulin
      concentration 25% higher than after regular insulin (p < 0.05). Suppression of
      endogenous glucose production was similar with both types of insulin. Thus,
      preprandial injection of Lispro reduced postprandial glucose increments in Type 2
      diabetic patients as compared to regular insulin. This effect is best explained
      by the increased postprandial bioavailability of Lispro.

TI  - Insulin treatment of elderly type 2 diabetic patients: effects on retinopathy.
PG  - 442-7
AB  - Insulin treatment is reportedly associated with the transient progression of
      retinopathy, possibly with the development of macular oedema in middle-aged Type 
      2 diabetic patients. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of
      insulin treatment on eye-grounds in elderly (> 65-year-old) Type 2 diabetic
      patients with secondary failure of oral antidiabetic-drug therapy. Eye
      examinations were performed in 37 patients randomized to insulin (n = 19) or
      sulphonylurea (n = 16) treatment and re-investigated after one year. Insulin
      treatment reduced HbA1c from 9.3% to 7.3% (p < 0.001) after one year. In the
      sulphonylurea-treated group, HbA1c did not change (9.1 vs. 9.3%). At the start,
      65% of the patients had retinopathy, and after one year progression was noted in 
      7/35 patients (20%; 5 insulin- and 2 sulphonylurea-treated). In the
      insulin-treated group, the 5 patients with progression had higher initial fasting
      blood-glucose levels than other patients in the group (15.8 vs 13.1 mmol/L, p <
      0.05). Initial HbA1c levels did not differ between the groups (9.8 vs. 9.1%,
      n.s.), nor the reduction of HbA1c levels during treatment (2.2 vs. 1.3% n.s.).
      Thus, diabetic retinopathy in this study was common among elderly Type 2 diabetic
      patients. The progression of retinopathy may in fact be associated with insulin
      treatment or improvement of metabolic control.

TI  - Impact of nocturnal hypoglycemia on hypoglycemic cognitive dysfunction in type 1 
      diabetes.
PG  - 1920-7
AB  - To test the hypothesis that glycemic thresholds for cognitive dysfunction during 
      hypoglycemia, like those for autonomic and symptomatic responses, shift to lower 
      plasma glucose concentrations after recent antecedent hypoglycemia in patients
      with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), 15 patients were studied on two occasions. 
      Cognitive functions were assessed during morning hyperinsulinemic stepped
      hypoglycemic clamps (85, 75, 65, 55, and 45 mg/dl steps) after, in random
      sequence, nocturnal (2330-0300) hypoglycemia (48 +/- 2 mg/dl) on one occasion and
      nocturnal euglycemia (109 +/- 1 mg/dl) on the other. Compared with nondiabetic
      control subjects (n = 12), patients with T1DM had absent glucagon (P = 0.0009)
      and reduced epinephrine (P = 0.0010), norepinephrine (P = 0.0001), and neurogenic
      symptom (P = 0.0480) responses to hypoglycemia; the epinephrine (P = 0.0460) and 
      neurogenic symptom (P = 0.0480) responses were reduced further after nocturnal
      hypoglycemia. After nocturnal hypoglycemia, in contrast to nocturnal euglycemia, 
      there was less deterioration of cognitive function overall (P = 0.0065) during
      hypoglycemia based on analysis of the sum of standardized scores (z-scores).
      There was relative preservation of measures of pattern recognition and memory
      (the delayed non-match to sample task, P = 0.0371) and of attention (the Stroop
      arrow-word task, P = 0.0395), but not of measures of information processing (the 
      paced serial addition task) or declarative memory (the delayed paragraph recall
      task), after nocturnal hypoglycemia. Thus, glycemic thresholds for hypoglycemic
      cognitive dysfunction, like those for autonomic and symptomatic responses to
      hypoglycemia, shift to lower plasma glucose concentrations after recent
      antecedent hypoglycemia in patients with T1DM.

TI  - Previous episodes of hypoglycemic coma are not associated with permanent
      cognitive brain dysfunction in IDDM patients on intensive insulin treatment.
PG  - 1909-14
AB  - Intensive insulin treatment of IDDM is associated with increased frequency of
      hypoglycemic coma. The extent of possible cerebral sequelae after recovery is
      still unknown. We studied the impact of previous hypoglycemic coma on
      neurophysiological measures of cognitive brain function in 108 patients with
      adult-onset IDDM receiving intensive insulin treatment. In the study, 55 IDDM
      patients (age 38 +/- 14 years, mean +/- SD) who had a history of > or =1 (median 
      3, range 1-35) comatose hypoglycemic event were compared with 53 IDDM patients
      (age 34 +/- 12 years) with no history of hypoglycemic events using P300
      event-related potentials and psychometric tests (the Mini-Mental State Exam and
      trailmaking test, part A). Findings on these patients were compared with those
      from 108 matched healthy control subjects. No difference was observed in P300
      latencies and psychometric tests between patients with and without a history of
      hypoglycemic coma (P300 latency, 346 vs. 342 ms; trailmaking test, 31 vs. 30 s;
      Mini-Mental State Exam, 29.5 vs. 29.6; NS). In diabetic patients, however, P300
      latencies were delayed compared with those of healthy control subjects (344 vs.
      332 ms; P < 0.001) and were correlated to diabetes duration but not to total
      hypoglycemic episodes. Scores on the Mini-Mental State Exam (29.5 vs. 29.6; P =
      0.59) and trailmaking test (31 vs. 28 s; P = 0.10) were not different between
      patients and control subjects. In conclusion, previous episodes of hypoglycemic
      coma are not associated with permanent impairment of cognitive brain function in 
      patients with adult-onset IDDM receiving intensive insulin treatment compared
      with patients without such episodes. Cognitive brain function, however, is
      subclinically impaired in relation to duration of diabetes.

TI  - High-fat versus high-carbohydrate enteral formulae: effect on blood glucose,
      C-peptide, and ketones in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin or
      sulfonylurea.
PG  - 840-5
AB  - Recently, two commercial enteral formulae for diabetic patients have been made
      available in Spain: a high-complex-carbohydrate, low-fat formulation (HCF) and a 
      low-carbohydrate formulation (RCF). This study compares the effects of the two
      enteral nutritional formulae in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes
      mellitus (type 2 diabetes) treated with sulfonylurea or insulin. Fifty-two type 2
      diabetes patients were randomly assigned to receive one of the two enteral
      formulae. Test enteral formula breakfast (250 cc) were consumed at approximately 
      0900 h after routine medications (insulin or oral agents) had been taken. Venous 
      blood samples were obtained during fasting, before medication, and at 30 and 120 
      min after the start of the meal. The glycemic response of patients to the HCF was
      significantly greater than to RCF, but lower than in the sulfonyl type 2 diabetes
      treated groups. The incremental glucose response was within acceptable levels
      except in insulin treatment type 2 diabetes patients given HCF. Glucose, insulin,
      and C-peptide responses were higher in HCF than RCF groups. Two-factor analysis
      of variance on mean increments of blood glucose and C-peptide from basal levels
      to 30 min show the type of enteral nutrition as the main factor (P = 0.0010 and P
      = 0.0005, respectively). The RCF formula supplies 50.0% of energy as fat and
      33.3% as carbohydrates, so it may be a ketogenic diet. It was found that both
      ketone bodies were higher after RCF than after HCF ingestion, but without
      statistical significance. We conclude that the partial replacement of complex
      digestible carbohydrates with monounsaturated fatty acids in the enteral formulae
      for supplementation of oral diet may improve glycemic control in patients with
      type 2 diabetes. The long-term effects of enteral diets high in monounsaturated
      fatty acids need further evaluation in patients with type 2 diabetes.

      plasma soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 concentrations in non-obese,
      non-dyslipidaemic, normotensive, patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes.
PG  - 1392-6
AB  - To assess in vivo effects of antioxidants on vascular cell adhesion molecule
      (VCAM)-1 expression, circulating soluble VCAM-1 and intraerythrocytic reduced
      glutathione (GSH) and GSH disulphide (GSSG) concentrations were evaluated in
      non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients without complications (9 men, 6 women, 48
      +/- 6 years old) before and after 1 month of either oral N-acetyl-L-cysteine
      (1.200 mg/day) or placebo treatments, given in randomized, cross-over,
      double-blind fashion. Ten healthy subjects (7 men, 3 women, 52 +/- 4 years old)
      served as control subjects. Baseline plasma VCAM-1 concentrations were higher (p 
      = 0.007) in non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients (707.9 +/- 52.5 ng/ml) than
      in control subjects (627.3 +/- 84.6 ng/ml). Intraerythrocytic GSSG content was
      higher (non-insulin dependent diabetic patients: 0.618 +/- 0.185 micromol/g Hb;
      control subjects: 0.352 +/- 0.04 micromol/g Hb, p = 0.0002), whereas
      intraerythrocytic GSH concentrations were lower (p = 0.001) in non-insulin
      dependent diabetic patients (6.0 +/- 0.7 micromol/g Hb) than in control subjects 
      (7.1 +/- 0.5 micromol/g Hb). The mean GSH:GSSG ratio was also lower (p = 0.0001) 
      in the first (10.9 +/- 4.5) than in the second group (20.2 +/- 1.4). Circulating 
      VCAM-1 and intraerythrocytic GSH concentrations were negatively correlated in
      non-insulin diabetic patients (r = 0.605, p = 0.01). Treatment with
      N-acetyl-L-cysteine decreased plasma VCAM-1 (p = 0.01) and intraerythrocytic GSSG
      (p = 0.006) but increased GSH concentrations (p = 0.04) and the GSH:GSSG ratio (p
      = 0.004) in non-insulin dependent diabetic patients. Our data indicate that the
      vascular endothelium is activated in non-insulin dependent diabetes. Antioxidant 
      treatment counterbalanced such endothelial activation. Thus, antioxidant agents
      might protect against oxidant-related upregulation of endothelial adhesion
      molecules and slow down the progression of vascular damage in non-insulin
      dependent diabetes.

TI  - Influence of glucagon-like peptide 1 on fasting glycemia in type 2 diabetic
      patients treated with insulin after sulfonylurea secondary failure.
PG  - 1925-31
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) has glucose-dependent insulinotropic
      and glucagonostatic actions in type 2 diabetic patients on diet and on oral
      agents. It is not known, however, whether after secondary sulfonylurea failure,
      GLP-1 is still effective. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Therefore, 10 type 2
      diabetic patients (6 women, 4 men; age 65+/-10 years, BMI 30.4+/-5.1 kg/m2, HbA1c
      8.2+/-1.5%, 6+/-3 [2-13] years after starting insulin treatment) were examined in
      the fasting state after discontinuing NPH insulin on the evening before the two
      study days. GLP-1 (1.2 pmol x kg(-1) x min(-1) or placebo (NaCl with 1% human
      serum albumin) were infused over 6 h. Plasma glucose (glucose oxidase) insulin
      (IMx), and C-peptide (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) were measured.
      Statistical analysis was performed using repeated measures analysis of variance. 
      RESULTS: Fasting plasma glucose was 9.4+/-0.5 mmol/l and was reduced by GLP-1 to 
      5.3+/-0.3 (3.9-7.3) mmol/l (placebo: 8.2+/-0.7 mmol/l; P < 0.0001). GLP-1
      transiently increased insulin (from 115+/-31 to 222+/-64 pmol/l at 150 min; P <
      0.0001) and C-peptide (from 1.00+/-0.12 to 1.90+/-0.23 nmol/l at 120 min; P <
      0.0001) with no effect of placebo. Glucagon and free fatty acids were lowered
      transiently. After normalization of plasma glucose, insulin and C-peptide
      concentrations became lower again during the ongoing administration of exogenous 
      GLP-1, and no hypoglycemia occurred. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that exogenous 
      GLP-1 effectively lowers plasma glucose concentrations in advanced type 2
      diabetes long after sulfonylurea secondary failure. These findings may broaden
      the applicability of GLP-1-derived drugs as a new treatment to nearly all type 2 
      diabetic patients.

TI  - Effects of glibenclamide on blood pressure and cardiovascular responsiveness in
      non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 705-11
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of chronic glibenclamide therapy and placebo on
      blood pressure and cardiovascular responsiveness in patients with
      non-insulin-dependent diabetes. DESIGN AND METHODS: Fourteen patients with
      non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, seven of whom were receiving angiotensin
      converting enzyme inhibitor therapy, received glibenclamide or placebo for 1
      month in a double-blind, randomized crossover study. At the end of each treatment
      period patients attended for studies of forearm vascular responsiveness to
      intra-brachial arterial infusions of angiotensin II, acetylcholine, sodium
      nitroprusside and noradrenaline, responses of blood pressure to intravenous
      infusions of noradrenaline and angiotensin II and 24 h ambulatory blood pressure 
      monitoring. RESULTS: Administration of glibenclamide produced significantly
      better glycaemic control than placebo (fasting blood glucose level 8.5 +/- 2.4
      versus 13.5 +/- 4.5 mmol/l, P < 0.001) and plasma insulin levels were
      significantly higher during glibenclamide treatment than they were with placebo
      (12.9 +/- 4.4 versus 9.2 +/- 4.1 mU/l, P < 0.05). Body weights at the ends of the
      glibenclamide treatment and placebo phases were similar (92.1 +/- 14.3 versus
      91.1 +/- 14.3 kg, P = 0.085). Night-time systolic blood pressures were
      significantly higher during glibenclamide treatment than they were with placebo
      (128 +/- 17 versus 118 +/- 10 mmHg, P < 0.05) due to there being a smaller
      day-night difference in systolic blood pressure during glibenclamide treatment
      that appeared to occur mainly in patients receiving angiotensin converting enzyme
      inhibitors. Responses of diastolic blood pressure to intravenous infusion of
      angiotensin II and forearm vascular responses to intra-brachial arterial infusion
      of angiotensin II were significantly greater during glibenclamide treatment than 
      they were with placebo (P < 0.05). However, the enhancement of forearm vascular
      responses during glibenclamide treatment appeared to be restricted to patients
      receiving angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Responses of blood pressure
      to intravenous infusion of noradrenaline and forearm vascular responses to
      infusions of noradrenaline, acetylcholine and nitroprusside did not differ
      between glibenclamide treatment and placebo; neither did basal forearm vascular
      resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Glibenclamide therapy is associated with greater
      responses of blood pressure and forearm vascular responses to infusion of
      angiotensin and higher nocturnal blood pressures. This effect appears to be
      influenced by concomitant angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition.

PG  - 67-77
AB  - The progress of knowledge relating to non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
      (NIDDM) is associated with new therapeutic developments. Their different
      respective targets allow to classify them in drugs stimulating insulin secretion 
      (glimepiride, repaglinide, glucagon-like peptide 1), medications reducing insulin
      resistance (thiazolidinediones) or in insulinmimetic agents (vanadium). Alpha
      glucosidase inhibitors, available in France since 1993, constitute another
      therapeutic approach, reducing postprandial hyperglycemia by delaying the
      digestion of complex carbohydrates. These new medications, safer and sometimes
      effective in a single daily administration, represent an alternative to classic
      oral antidiabetic agents allowing therapeutic combinations and a more global
      management of NIDDM.

TI  - Issues surrounding tight glycemic control in people with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus.
PG  - 896-905
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the prospective evidence surrounding the issue of tight
      glycemic control in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus and resultant long-term 
      complications. DATA SOURCE: Conference proceedings and a MEDLINE search
      (1966-February 1998) identified pertinent English-language publications on type 2
      diabetes in humans. Key search terms included insulin resistance, diabetes
      mellitus, non-insulin-dependent, macrovascular complications, microvascular
      complications, and intensive glycemic control. STUDY SELECTION: Selection of
      prospective epidemiologic and clinical studies were limited to those focusing on 
      the management of type 2 diabetes. All articles with pertinent information
      relevant to the scope of this article were reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS: The
      pathophysiology of type 1 and type 2 diabetes differ; however, both share chronic
      complications that significantly affect morbidity and mortality. People with type
      1 diabetes have an absolute deficiency of insulin, whereas people with type 2
      diabetes have varying degrees of insulin resistance and an inadequate
      compensatory insulin secretory response. The Diabetes Control and Complications
      Trial (DCCT) has clearly indicated that intense control of blood glucose in type 
      1 diabetes prevents and slows the progression of microvascular (i.e.,
      retinopathy, nephropathy) and neuropathic complications. The Kumamoto study
      showed similar results in nonobese patients with type 2 diabetes. Intense insulin
      therapy in both populations has proven advantageous, thus supporting a common
      pathophysiologic process for the microvascular and neuropathic complications.
      Trends were seen toward fewer macrovascular (atherosclerotic disease)
      complications in the intensive insulin arm of the DCCT. Conversely, trends were
      seen toward an increase in macrovascular complications in the VA Cooperative
      study in people with type 2 diabetes using intensive insulin therapy. This may
      suggest a discordance in the pathophysiology of macrovascular disease between
      type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Additionally, it remains uncertain whether tight
      glycemic control prevents the onset or slows the progression of macrovascular
      disease. Two studies (the University Group Diabetes Program and the Veterans
      Affairs Cooperative Study on Glycemic Control and Complications in Type 2
      Diabetes) to date have examined pharmacotherapy options for patients with type 2 
      diabetes and resultant macrovascular complications. It has yet to be determined
      whether any therapeutic intervention will decrease the morbidity and mortality of
      macrovascular disease in this population. CONCLUSIONS: In type 2 diabetes,
      limited prospective evidence does support tight glycemic control to help prevent 
      or slow the progression of microvascular and neuropathic complications. It is
      uncertain whether tight glycemic control decreases macrovascular complications
      and which pharmacotherapeutic agent(s) is/are the best options. However, therapy 
      that improves glucose control in combination with aggressive risk factor
      management should be initiated and enforced in patients with type 2 diabetes in
      an effort to reduce long-term complications.

TI  - [Pitfalls in treatment with oral antidiabetic agents].
PG  - 30-5
AB  - In the treatment of type 2 diabetes (NIDDM) we possess three groups of oral
      hypoglycaemic drugs: sulfonyl urea derivatives, biguanides (metformin) and
      alpha-glucosidase (acarbose) inhibitors. Oral treatment of diabetes has a
      favourable impact on the patients metabolic deviations but it involves also
      certain dangers and pitfalls. The side-effects of oral antidiabetics can be
      reduced to a minimum by respecting consequentially contraindications of
      administration of different preparations, knowledge of their mechanism of action 
      and individual selection of a suitable antidiabetic for every patient.

TI  - Effect of intensive blood-glucose control with metformin on complications in
      overweight patients with type 2 diabetes (UKPDS 34). UK Prospective Diabetes
      Study (UKPDS) Group.
PG  - 854-65
AB  - BACKGROUND: In patients with type 2 diabetes, intensive blood-glucose control
      with insulin or sulphonylurea therapy decreases progression of microvascular
      disease and may also reduce the risk of heart attacks. This study investigated
      whether intensive glucose control with metformin has any specific advantage or
      disadvantage. METHODS: Of 4075 patients recruited to UKPDS in 15 centres, 1704
      overweight (>120% ideal bodyweight) patients with newly diagnosed type 2
      diabetes, mean age 53 years, had raised fasting plasma glucose (FPG; 6.1-15.0
      mmol/L) without hyperglycaemic symptoms after 3 months' initial diet. 753 were
      included in a randomised controlled trial, median duration 10.7 years, of
      conventional policy, primarily with diet alone (n=411) versus intensive
      blood-glucose control policy with metformin, aiming for FPG below 6 mmol/L
      (n=342). A secondary analysis compared the 342 patients allocated metformin with 
      951 overweight patients allocated intensive blood-glucose control with
      chlorpropamide (n=265), glibenclamide (n=277), or insulin (n=409). The primary
      outcome measures were aggregates of any diabetes-related clinical endpoint,
      diabetes-related death, and all-cause mortality. In a supplementary randomised
      controlled trial, 537 non-overweight and overweight patients, mean age 59 years, 
      who were already on maximum sulphonylurea therapy but had raised FPG (6.1-15.0
      mmol/L) were allocated continuing sulphonylurea therapy alone (n=269) or addition
      of metformin (n=268). FINDINGS: Median glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was 7.4% in
      the metformin group compared with 8.0% in the conventional group. Patients
      allocated metformin, compared with the conventional group, had risk reductions of
      32% (95% CI 13-47, p=0.002) for any diabetes-related endpoint, 42% for
      diabetes-related death (9-63, p=0.017), and 36% for all-cause mortality (9-55,
      p=0.011). Among patients allocated intensive blood-glucose control, metformin
      showed a greater effect than chlorpropamide, glibenclamide, or insulin for any
      diabetes-related endpoint (p=0.0034), all-cause mortality (p=0.021), and stroke
      (p=0.032). Early addition of metformin in sulphonylurea-treated patients was
      associated with an increased risk of diabetes-related death (96% increased risk
      [95% CI 2-275], p=0.039) compared with continued sulphonylurea alone. A combined 
      analysis of the main and supplementary studies showed fewer metformin-allocated
      patients having diabetes-related endpoints (risk reduction 19% [2-33], p=0.033). 
      Epidemiological assessment of the possible association of death from
      diabetes-related causes with the concurrent therapy of diabetes in 4416 patients 
      did not show an increased risk in diabetes-related death in patients treated with
      a combination of sulphonylurea and metformin (risk reduction 5% [-33 to 32],
      p=0.78). INTERPRETATION: Since intensive glucose control with metformin appears
      to decrease the risk of diabetes-related endpoints in overweight diabetic
      patients, and is associated with less weight gain and fewer hypoglycaemic attacks
      than are insulin and sulphonylureas, it may be the first-line pharmacological
      therapy of choice in these patients.

TI  - Repaglinide.
PG  - 173-80
AB  - Repaglinide is a novel insulin secretagogue being developed for the management of
      type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. It stimulates release of
      insulin from the pancreatic beta-cell, but appears to bind to a different
      receptor site from sulphonylureas. Repaglinide lowers fasting and postprandial
      blood glucose levels in animals, healthy volunteers and patients with type 2
      diabetes mellitus. Repaglinide is rapidly absorbed and eliminated, which may
      allow a relatively fast onset and offset of action. Excretion occurs almost
      entirely by non-renal mechanisms. In comparative clinical trials in patients with
      type 2 diabetes mellitus, repaglinide 0.5 to 4 mg twice or 3 times daily before
      meals provided similar glycaemic control to glibenclamide (glyburide) 2.5 to 15
      mg/day. Addition of repaglinide to existing metformin therapy resulted in
      improved glycaemic control. In contrast with glibenclamide, use of repaglinide
      allowed patients to miss a meal without apparently increasing the risk of
      hypoglycaemia.

TI  - Tight blood pressure control and risk of macrovascular and microvascular
      complications in type 2 diabetes: UKPDS 38. UK Prospective Diabetes Study Group.
PG  - 703-13
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether tight control of blood pressure prevents
      macrovascular and microvascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes.
      DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial comparing tight control of blood pressure
      aiming at a blood pressure of <150/85 mm Hg (with the use of an angiotensin
      converting enzyme inhibitor captopril or a beta blocker atenolol as main
      treatment) with less tight control aiming at a blood pressure of <180/105 mm Hg. 
      SETTING: 20 hospital based clinics in England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.
      SUBJECTS: 1148 hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes (mean age 56, mean
      blood pressure at entry 160/94 mm Hg); 758 patients were allocated to tight
      control of blood pressure and 390 patients to less tight control with a median
      follow up of 8.4 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Predefined clinical end points,
      fatal and non-fatal, related to diabetes, deaths related to diabetes, and all
      cause mortality. Surrogate measures of microvascular disease included urinary
      albumin excretion and retinal photography. RESULTS: Mean blood pressure during
      follow up was significantly reduced in the group assigned tight blood pressure
      control (144/82 mm Hg) compared with the group assigned to less tight control
      (154/87 mm Hg) (P<0.0001). Reductions in risk in the group assigned to tight
      control compared with that assigned to less tight control were 24% in diabetes
      related end points (95% confidence interval 8% to 38%) (P=0.0046), 32% in deaths 
      related to diabetes (6% to 51%) (P=0.019), 44% in strokes (11% to 65%) (P=0.013),
      and 37% in microvascular end points (11% to 56%) (P=0.0092), predominantly owing 
      to a reduced risk of retinal photocoagulation. There was a non-significant
      reduction in all cause mortality. After nine years of follow up the group
      assigned to tight blood pressure control also had a 34% reduction in risk in the 
      proportion of patients with deterioration of retinopathy by two steps (99%
      confidence interval 11% to 50%) (P=0.0004) and a 47% reduced risk (7% to 70%)
      (P=0.004) of deterioration in visual acuity by three lines of the early treatment
      of diabetic retinopathy study (ETDRS) chart. After nine years of follow up 29% of
      patients in the group assigned to tight control required three or more treatments
      to lower blood pressure to achieve target blood pressures. CONCLUSION: Tight
      blood pressure control in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes achieves
      a clinically important reduction in the risk of deaths related to diabetes,
      complications related to diabetes, progression of diabetic retinopathy, and
      deterioration in visual acuity.

TI  - Troglitazone in combination with sulfonylurea restores glycemic control in
      patients with type 2 diabetes. The Troglitazone Study Group.
PG  - 1462-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if the combination of troglitazone (a peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor-gamma activator) and sulfonylurea will provide
      efficacy not attainable by either medication alone. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: 
      There were 552 patients inadequately controlled on maximum doses of sulfonylurea 
      who participated in a 52-week randomized active-controlled multicenter study.
      Patients were randomized to micronized glyburide 12 mg q.d. (G12); troglitazone
      monotherapy 200, 400, or 600 mg q.d. (T200, T400, T600); or combined troglitazone
      and glyburide q.d. (T200/G12, T400/G12, T600/G12). Efficacy measures included
      HbA1c, fasting serum glucose (FSG), insulin, and C-peptide. Effects on lipids and
      safety were also assessed. RESULTS: Patients on T600/G12 had significantly lower 
      mean (+/- SEM) FSG (9.3 +/- 0.4 mmol/l; 167.4 +/- 6.6 mg/dl) compared with
      control subjects (13.7 +/- 0.4 mmol/l; 246.5 +/- 6.8 mg/dl; P < 0.0001) and
      significantly lower mean HbA1c (7.79 +/- 0.2 vs. 10.58 +/- 0.18%, P < 0.0001).
      Significant dose-related decreases were also seen with T200/G12 and T400/G12.
      Among patients on T600/G12, 60% achieved HbA1c < or =8%, 42% achieved HbA1c < or 
      =7%, and 40% achieved FSG < or =7.8 mmol/l (140 mg/dl). Fasting insulin and
      C-peptide decreased with all treatments. Overall, triglycerides and free fatty
      acids decreased, whereas HDL cholesterol increased. LDL cholesterol increased
      slightly, with no change in apolipoprotein B. Adverse events were similar across 
      treatments. Hypoglycemia occurred in 3% of T600/G 12 patients compared with <1%
      on G12 or troglitazone monotherapy CONCLUSIONS: Patients with type 2 diabetes
      inadequately controlled on sulfonylurea can be effectively managed with a
      combination of troglitazone and sulfonylurea that is safe, well tolerated, and
      represents a new approach to achieving the glycemic targets recommended by the
      American Diabetes Association.

TI  - Isolated postchallenge hyperglycemia and the risk of fatal cardiovascular disease
      in older women and men. The Rancho Bernardo Study.
PG  - 1236-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether diabetes defined by isolated postchallenge
      hyperglycemia (IPH) (2-h postchallenge plasma glucose > or = 11.1 mmol/l with
      fasting plasma glucose [FPG] < 7.0 mmol/l) increases the risk of fatal
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) in older women and men. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS:
      In a prospective study, we followed 769 men and 1,089 women, aged 50-89 years,
      who had no history of diabetes or myocardial infarction and demonstrated no
      fasting hyperglycemia (i.e., FPG < 7.0 mmol/l) when they underwent oral glucose
      tolerance testing at baseline in 1984-1987. RESULTS: At baseline, 70% of 125
      women and 48% of 133 men with previously undiagnosed diabetes had IPH. Over the
      next 7 years, women with IPH had a significantly increased risk of fatal CVD and 
      heart disease compared with nondiabetic women. This increased risk was not
      observed in men with IPH. This association was independent of age, hypertension, 
      central obesity, cigarette smoking, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides (multiply 
      adjusted hazard ratio and 95% CI: 2.6 and 1.4-4.7 for CVD; 2.9 and 1.3-6.4 for
      heart disease). CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes defined by IPH alone is common in older
      adults and more than doubles the risk of fatal CVD and heart disease in older
      women. Because the prevalence of IPH increases with age, the use of fasting
      glucose alone for diabetes screening or diagnosis may fail to identify most older
      adults at high risk for CVD and should be reevaluated.

TI  - Accelerated oral absorption of gliclazide in human subjects from a soft gelatin
      capsule containing a PEG 400 suspension of gliclazide.
PG  - 185-92
AB  - Whether a rapid elevation of serum gliclazide concentration in human subjects can
      be achieved through an acceleration of dissolution of gliclazide from a
      formulation was examined. A soft gelatin capsule containing PEG 400, PEG 4000,
      Tween 20 and glycerin was prepared as a formulation that may accelerate
      dissolution of gliclazide. The in vitro dissolution of gliclazide at pH 7.2 was
      identical for the soft capsule and conventional tablets, Diamicron and Diberin.
      However, at pH 1, 2 and 4.0 the dissolution from the soft capsule was more rapid 
      compared to the tablets. When bioavailability parameters were compared following 
      oral administration of the soft capsule and Diamicron to 16 healthy Korean male
      subjects, the parameters representing the amount of adsorption (i.e. the area
      under the serum gliclazide concentration vs. time curve up to 24 h, AUC24, and
      the peak serum concentration Cmax) were not statistically different for both
      formulations. However, the time required to reach the peak (Tmax) was
      significantly shorter for the soft capsule than for the Diamicron. Our results,
      therefore, indicate that a rapid elevation of serum gliclazide concentration
      following oral administration of a formulation can be achieved by accelerating
      the in vitro dissolution of gliclazide from the formulation into the acidic
      buffers. Thus, the rate of gastrointestinal absorption of gliclazide appears to
      be dependent on its in vivo dissolution rate in gastric fluid. A soft capsule
      containing a PEG 400 suspension of gliclazide appears to be an appropriate
      formulation for accelerating the dissolution.

TI  - Acarbose in NIDDM patients with poor control on conventional oral agents. A
      24-week placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 1154-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of acarbose, compared with placebo, on the
      metabolic control of NIDDM patients inadequately controlled on maximal doses of
      conventional oral agents. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this three-center
      double-blind study, 90 Chinese NIDDM patients with persistent poor glycemic
      control despite maximal doses of sulfonylurea and metformin were randomly
      assigned to receive additional treatment with acarbose 100 mg thrice daily or
      placebo for 24 weeks, after 6 weeks of dietary reinforcement. Efficacy was
      assessed by changes in HbA1c, fasting and 1-h postprandial plasma glucose and
      insulin levels, and fasting lipid levels. RESULTS: Acarbose treatment was
      associated with significantly greater reductions in HbA1c (-0.5 +/- 0.2% vs.
      placebo 0.1 +/- 0.2% [means +/- SEM], P = 0.038), 1-h postprandial glucose (-2.3 
      +/- 0.4 mmol/l vs. placebo 0.7 +/- 0.4 mmol/l, P < 0.001) and body weight (-0.54 
      +/- 0.32 kg vs. placebo 0.42 +/- 0.29 kg, P < 0.05). There was no significant
      difference between the two groups regarding changes in fasting plasma glucose and
      lipids or fasting and postprandial insulin levels. Flatulence was the most common
      side effect (acarbose vs. placebo: 28/45 vs. 11/44, P < 0.05). One patient on
      acarbose had asymptomatic elevations in serum transaminases that normalized in 4 
      weeks after acarbose withdrawal. Another patient on acarbose developed severe
      hypoglycemia; glycemic control was subsequently maintained on half the baseline
      dosage of sulfonylurea. CONCLUSIONS: In NIDDM patients inadequately controlled on
      conventional oral agents, acarbose in moderate doses resulted in beneficial
      effects on glycemic control, especially postprandial glycemia, and mean body
      weight. Additional use of acarbose can be considered as a useful alternative in
      such patients if they are reluctant to accept insulin therapy.

TI  - Beginning insulin treatment of obese patients with evening 70/30 insulin plus
      glimepiride versus insulin alone. Glimepiride Combination Group.
PG  - 1052-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study tested a simple algorithm for beginning insulin for obese
      patients with type 2 diabetes after sulfonylurea failure, comparing suppertime
      70/30 insulin plus continued glimepiride with insulin alone. RESEARCH DESIGN AND 
      METHODS: This was a multicenter ambulatory randomized double-masked parallel
      comparison. There were 208 subjects with secondary failure to sulfonylureas who
      took glimepiride titrated to 8 mg b.i.d. for 8 weeks; 145 subjects with fasting
      plasma glucose (FPG) 180-300 mg/dl (10-16.7 mmol/l) on this treatment were
      randomized to placebo plus insulin (PI) or glimepiride plus insulin (GI) for 24
      weeks. A dosage of 70/30 insulin before supper was titrated, seeking fasting
      capillary blood glucose (FBG) 120 mg/dl (6.7 mmol/l), equivalent to FPG 140 mg/dl
      (7.8 mmol/l). Outcome measures included FPG, HbA1c, insulin dosage, weight, serum
      insulin and lipids, and adverse events. RESULTS: FPG and HbA1c were equivalent at
      baseline: 261 vs. 250 mg/dl (14.5 vs. 13.9 mmol/l), and 9.9 vs. 9.7%. At 24
      weeks, the FPG target was achieved in both groups (136 vs. 138 mg/dl, 7.6 vs. 7.6
      mmol/l), and HbA1c values were equal (7.7 vs. 7.6%). However, with GI, control
      improved faster and fewer subjects dropped out (3 vs. 15%, P < 0.01), and less
      insulin was needed (49 vs. 78 U/d, P < 0.001). The outcomes were alike in other
      respects. No subject had severe hypoglycemia. CONCLUSIONS: Injection of 70/30
      insulin before supper safely restored glycemic control of type 2 diabetes not
      controlled by glimepiride alone. Control was restored more rapidly and with less 
      injected insulin when glimepiride was continued.

PG  - 195-200
AB  - This study evaluated the efficacy of acarbose in improvement of metabolic control
      in patients with fairly, well controlled non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 
      (NIDDM). Fifteen patients with mean age and duration of diabetes of 57.5 +/- 2.6 
      (SE) and 7.5 +/- 1.5 years, respectively were recruited and completed our study
      protocol. This study was a double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled design
      consisting of two twelve-week treatments of acarbose and placebo separated by an 
      eight-week washout period. Acarbose was effective in lowering of 1-hour and
      2-hour postprandial plasma glucose from 251.7 +/- 10.7 and 205.3 +/- 9.1 mg/dl to
      197.4 +/- 7.0 (p = 0.001) and 181.5 +/- 8.5 mg/dl (p = 0.03), respectively.
      Fasting plasma glucose was slightly decreased but without significant change,
      from 150.8 +/- 7.3 to 140.8 +/- 6.1 mg/dl (p = 0.07). Overall glycemic control
      tended to improve during the study period as indicated by the falling of HbA1c
      levels from 7.7 +/- 0.4 to 7.0 +/- 0.2 per cent (p = 0.05). Serum C-peptide both 
      fasting and postprandial as well as serum lipids were not affected by acarbose.
      Almost half of the patients treated with acarbose had mild and tolerable
      gastrointestinal adverse effects. In conclusion, acarbose, as combined therapy
      with other oral hypoglycemic agents, was effective in improvement of glycemic
      control particularly postprandial hyperglycemia in fairly, well controlled NIDDM 
      patients with mild and acceptable adverse effects.

PG  - 512-7
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate conjugated dienes in subjects with
      non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and its metabolic control. To
      achieve good metabolic control in addition to dietary management oral
      hypoglycemic agents such as glibenclamide, gliclazide and metformin were given to
      patients. Human plasma low-density lipoproteins (LDL) were delipidised and
      triglycerides (LDL-TG) and cholesterol esters (LDL-CE) were separated. Conjugated
      dienes in LDL-TG and LDL-CE of subjects with NIDDM (n = 90) and normal glucose
      tolerance (NGT) (n = 30) were measured using second derivative of uv absorption
      spectrum. Hypoglycemic agents lowered substantially concentration of cis, trans
      (c, t) and trans, trans (t, t) conjugated dienes in LDL-CE and LDL-TG. The
      duration of NIDDM has shown significant correlation (p < 0.001) with conjugated
      dienes in LDL-TG. Concentration of c, t and t, t-conjugated dienes in LDL-CE and 
      LDL-TG were found significantly higher in subjects with NIDDM than NGT (p <
      0.001). In conclusion, NIDDM, status of metabolic control and duration of
      diabetes have strong positive relation with oxidative stress.

TI  - Changes in amylin and amylin-like peptide concentrations and beta-cell function
      in response to sulfonylurea or insulin therapy in NIDDM.
PG  - 810-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Amylin, a secretory peptide of beta-cells, is the constituent peptide 
      of islet amyloid, which is characteristic of NIDDM, and changes in amylin
      secretion in response to therapies may influence the rate of production of islet 
      amyloid. The primary objective of this study was to determine whether therapy
      with sulfonylurea or basal insulin in NIDDM would alter amylin secretion in a way
      that might affect the formation of islet amyloid. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In
      a randomized crossover design, eight subjects with NIDDM underwent three 8-week
      periods of therapy with diet alone, sulfonylurea, or exogenous basal insulin,
      with evaluation of amylin, amylin-like peptide (ALP), and glucose and C-peptide
      concentrations, both during fasting and after a standard breakfast. Changes in
      beta-cell function (% beta) were assessed, in the basal state by homeostasis
      model assessment (HOMA) and in the stimulated state by hyperglycemic clamps.
      Seven nondiabetic control subjects each underwent a meal profile and
      hyperglycemic clamp. RESULTS: Both sulfonylurea and insulin therapy reduced basal
      glucose concentrations compared with diet alone, but neither reduced the
      increased postprandial glucose increments. Both sulfonylurea and insulin therapy 
      increased basal % beta, assessed by HOMA, but only sulfonylurea increased the
      second-phase C-peptide responses to the hyperglycemic clamp. Sulfonylurea
      increased time-averaged mean postprandial amylin and ALP concentrations compared 
      with diet alone (geometric mean [1-SD range] for amylin, 4.9 [2.0-11.8] vs. 3.0
      [1.4-6.2] pmol/l, P = 0.003; for ALP, 16.4 [8.5-31.7] vs. 10.1 [4.9-20.8] pmol/l,
      P = 0.001). Insulin therapy reduced basal ALP concentrations compared with diet
      alone (2.9 [1.5-5.6] vs. 6.0 [2.6-13.6] pmol/l, P = 0.03), but had no effect on
      postprandial concentrations of amylin (3.0 [1.3-6.5] pmol/l) or ALP (10.0
      [5.5-18.1] pmol/l). CONCLUSIONS: By increasing postprandial concentrations of the
      constituent peptides of islet amyloid, sulfonylurea therapy might increase the
      rate of deposition of islet amyloid and thereby accelerate the decline of % beta 
      in NIDDM, compared with diet therapy alone.

TI  - The effect of magnesium supplementation in increasing doses on the control of
      type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 682-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Hypomagnesemia occurs in 25-38% of patients with type 2 diabetes.
      Several studies have suggested an association between magnesium (Mg) depletion
      and insulin resistance and/or reduction of insulin secretion in these cases. Our 
      purpose was to evaluate if Mg supplementation (as magnesium oxide [MgO]) would
      improve metabolic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND
      METHODS: We studied 128 patients with type 2 diabetes (32 men, 96 women, aged
      30-69 years), treated by diet or diet plus oral antidiabetic drugs, in the Bahia 
      Federal University Hospital, Brazil. Patients at risk for hypomagnesemia or with 
      reduced renal function were excluded. This study was a clinical randomized
      double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Patients received either placebo, 20.7
      mmol MgO, or 41.4 mmol MgO daily (elementary Mg) for 30 days. Mg concentrations
      were measured in plasma, in mononuclear cells, and in 24-h urine samples. Fasting
      blood glucose, HbA1, and fructosamine were used as parameters of metabolic
      control. RESULTS: Of the patients, 47.7% had low plasma Mg, and 31.1% had low
      intramononuclear Mg levels. Intracellular Mg in patients with diabetes was
      significantly lower than in the normal population (62 blood donors; 1.4 +/- 0.6
      vs. 1.7 +/- 0.6 micrograms/mg of total proteins). No correlation was found
      between plasma and intracellular Mg concentrations (r = -0.179; P = 0.15) or
      between Mg concentrations and glycemic control (r = -0.165; P = 0.12).
      Intracellular Mg levels were lower in patients with peripheral neuropathy than in
      those without (1.2 +/- 0.5 vs. 1.5 +/- 0.6 micrograms/mg). Similar findings were 
      observed in patients with coronary disease (1.0 +/- 0.5 vs. 1.5 +/- 0.6
      micrograms/mg). In the placebo and in the 20.7 mmol Mg groups, neither a change
      in plasma and intracellular levels nor an improvement in glycemic control were
      observed. Replacement with 41.4 mmol Mg tended to increase plasma, cellular, and 
      urine Mg and caused a significant fall (4.1 +/- 0.8 to 3.8 +/- 0.7 mmol/l) in
      fructosamine (normal, 1.87-2.87 mmol/l). CONCLUSIONS: Mg depletion is common in
      poorly controlled patients with type 2 diabetes, especially in those with
      neuropathy or coronary disease. More prolonged use of Mg in doses that are higher
      than usual is needed to establish its routine or selective administration in
      patients with type 2 diabetes to improve control or prevent chronic
      complications.

TI  - Beta-cell deterioration determines the onset and rate of progression of secondary
      dietary failure in type 2 diabetes mellitus: the 10-year follow-up of the Belfast
      Diet Study.
PG  - 290-6
AB  - Secondary failure of plasma glucose control following initial successful response
      to diet therapy may be due to dietary indiscretion, or to progression of the
      intrinsic diabetic condition. We report a 10-year prospective natural history
      study of 432 newly diagnosed diabetic patients aged 40-69 years undertaken to
      assess the effect of intensive dietary management, where patients were
      transferred to insulin, or oral hypoglycaemic therapy (tolbutamide, metformin) by
      predetermined criteria of weight and plasma glucose. Secondary failure to diet
      therapy occurred in 41 patients in years 2-4, 67 patients in years 5-7, and 51
      patients in years 8-10; 173 patients remained on diet alone until death or the
      end of the study. Continuation on diet alone was associated with a lower ongoing 
      fasting plasma glucose, greater beta-cell function assessed by an oral glucose
      tolerance test at 6 months, and increasing age. The rate of rise of fasting
      plasma glucose was inversely related to the duration of successful dietary
      therapy, but mean weight remained constant in all groups while on diet alone. The
      ongoing fall in beta-cell function assessed by HOMA modelling closely mirrored
      the progressive rise in fasting plasma glucose: there was no change in mean
      insulin sensitivity in any of the groups.

TI  - The blood glucose lowering effects of exercise and glibenclamide in patients with
      type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 194-8
AB  - Physical exercise is associated with a fall in serum insulin levels, whereas
      sulphonylurea administration increases insulin release. To date, the opposing
      effects of exercise and sulphonylurea administration have not been systematically
      studied in Type 2 diabetic patients, who are not infrequently treated with
      sulphonylureas. In this study nine patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus were
      subjected to four treatments in random order on separate days: (A) endurance
      exercise after the administration of 3.5 mg glibenclamide; (B) as A but given
      only 1.75 mg glibenclamide; (C) as A but with placebo; (D) rest and
      administration of 1.75 mg glibenclamide. Exercise and placebo resulted in only a 
      small decrease in glycaemia. Rest and administration of 1.75 mg glibenclamide led
      to a moderate but steady fall in blood glucose concentrations. If glibenclamide
      administration and exercise were combined, blood glucose concentrations declined 
      more markedly. Serum insulin concentrations showed a physiological decrease
      during exercise and placebo administration. If patients rested after
      administration of glibenclamide serum insulin levels rose and remained elevated. 
      When exercise and glibenclamide were combined the rise in serum insulin levels
      was blunted and insulin levels fell once exercise was begun. Thus, exercise
      attenuates the glibenclamide induced increase in serum insulin in moderately
      hyperglycaemic Type 2 diabetic patients. Nevertheless, exercise has a substantial
      hypoglycaemic effect in glibenclamide treated Type 2 diabetic patients.

TI  - The effect of short periods of caloric restriction on weight loss and glycemic
      control in type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 2-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether an intermittent very-low-calorie diet (VLCD)
      improves weight loss and glycemic control more than moderate caloric restriction 
      alone. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Individuals with type 2 diabetes (n = 54) who
      were > or = 20% over ideal body weight participated in a 20-week behavioral
      weight control program. Subjects were randomized to either a standard behavioral 
      therapy (SBT) group or to one of two VLCD groups. SBT subjects received a
      1,500-1,800 kcal/day diet throughout. Both VLCD groups followed a VLCD for 5
      consecutive days during week 2, followed by either intermittent VLCD therapy for 
      1 day/week for 15 weeks (1-day) or for 5 consecutive days every 5 weeks (5-day), 
      with a 1,500-1,800 kcal/day diet at other times. RESULTS: Both VLCD groups lost
      more weight than the SBT group over the 20 weeks (P = 0.04). Although the groups 
      did not differ in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) changes at 20 weeks, more subjects
      in the 5-day group attained a normal HbA1c when compared with the SBT group (P = 
      0.04). This benefit was independent of the effects of weight loss. The best
      predictor of overall change in FPG and HbA1c was the FPG response during the
      first 3 weeks of the program. CONCLUSIONS: Periodic VLCDs improved weight loss in
      diabetic subjects. A regimen with intermittent 5-day VLCD therapy seemed
      particularly promising, because more subjects in this group attained a normal
      HbA1c. Moreover, the glucose response to a 3-week period of diet therapy
      predicted glycemic response at 20 weeks, and it was a better predictor of the
      20-week response than initial or overall weight loss.

TI  - Is there a concentration-effect relationship for sulphonylureas?
PG  - 181-8
AB  - Sulphonylureas have remained the mainstay of oral therapy for type 2
      (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). They stimulate insulin release
      from pancreatic beta cells. Pharmacokinetic differences between the various
      sulphonylureas are of clinical importance in terms of the time to onset of
      action, timing of drug administration in relation to food intake, magnitude and
      duration of the glucose-lowering effect and the risk of serious hypoglycaemia.
      Recent studies with improved analytical sensitivity have shown that the
      elimination half-life of glibenclamide is longer than previously thought and that
      2 metabolites of glibenclamide have significant hypoglycaemic activity.
      Furthermore, single dose studies in healthy volunteers using an integrated
      pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model have identified clear concentration-effect 
      relationships for both glibenclamide and its metabolites after oral and
      intravenous administration. Under multiple dose conditions, kinetic-dynamic
      relations have been identified with shorter-acting drugs in dosages that give
      discontinuous sulphonylurea exposure. However, at continuous exposure, i.e.
      sustained 24-hour therapeutic concentrations in plasma, there is evidence
      indicating the development of tolerance, which may be caused by downregulation of
      beta cell sensitivity. As more sophisticated concentration-effect studies appear,
      it has become evident that currently recommended maximum daily doses of many
      sulphonylureas are too high.

TI  - Long-term treatment with the dual antithromboxane agent picotamide decreases
      microalbuminuria in normotensive type 2 diabetic patients.
PG  - 423-30
AB  - Picotamide both inhibits thromboxane synthetase and acts as a thromboxane
      antagonist at the receptor level. We investigated the long-term effect of
      picotamide on urinary albumin excretion (UAE) at rest and induced by exercise in 
      30 type 2 diabetic patients who were normotensive and had microalbuminuria while 
      at rest. The subjects of our study had a mean age of 52.5 +/- 1.6 years, BMI of
      28.5 +/- 0.7 kg/m2, diabetes duration of 9.1 +/- 1.8 years, and HbA1c of 7.0 +/- 
      0.8%. The study was a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. The
      patients were randomly allocated to receive for 1 year either picotamide, 300 mg,
      3 tablets/day, or placebo, 3 tablets/day. The patients were asked to visit our
      outpatient clinic after 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of treatment. At all times,
      blood pressure, microalbuminuria at rest, blood glucose, serum creatinine, serum 
      picotamide, and creatinine clearance were measured; at baseline and after 6 and
      12 months, all patients underwent submaximal physical exercise. After 6 months of
      picotamide, baseline and exercise-induced microalbuminuria were significantly
      decreased (up to one-third) as compared with the baseline and placebo level, with
      no further drops at month 12 of picotamide treatment. On placebo treatment, UAE
      at rest and after exercise was slightly increased compared with baseline values. 
      The effects of picotamide occurred without significant side effects or changes in
      either blood pressure levels or glycometabolic control. Our study is the first
      long-term intervention trial in type 2 diabetes showing that an antithromboxane
      agent is able to decrease microalbuminuria, which in this disease is a dual
      marker of macro- and microangiopathy. Our findings suggest an important role for 
      thromboxane in the pathophysiology of microalbuminuria in diabetes; moreover, we 
      hypothesize that antithromboxane agents may have a place in the
      treatment/prevention of both macro- and microvascular complications in type 2
      diabetic patients.

TI  - Molecular effects of sulphonylurea agents in circulating lymphocytes of patients 
      with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 291-9
AB  - AIMS: In circulating lymphocytes of NIDDM patients pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), 
      the major determinant in glucose consumption through oxidative pathways, is
      poorly active. The aim of this study is to examine whether sulphonylurea drug
      treatment revives PDH activity in circulating lymphocytes from NIDDM patients.
      METHODS: Twenty normal-weight individuals with NIDDM were enrolled in this study.
      They had maintained their glycaemic levels close to normal by means of a
      restricted diet that had no longer been successful in the proceeding 2 months.
      The treatment protocol consisted in 160 mg gliclazide daily for 5 weeks. Twenty
      healthy subjects, matched for age, body mass index and gender, were enrolled as a
      control group. Patients, before and after treatment, as well as controls were
      tested for PDH activity in their circulating lymphocytes. Nine other untreated
      patients and nine healthy subjects, with the above mentioned characteristics,
      were recruited for the assay of PDH activity in their circulating lymphocytes
      before and after exposure, in vitro, to gliclazide, to insulin, and to gliclazide
      and insulin in combination. RESULTS: In gliclazide-treated NIDDM patients, PDH
      activity in circulating lymphocytes recovered. In vitro, in circulating
      lymphocytes of untreated patients and controls insulin at 5 microU ml(-1) was
      ineffective and highly effective, respectively, in raising enzyme activity;
      gliclazide at 10 ng ml(-1) was ineffective on PDH in both groups, but in
      combination with insulin at 5 microU ml(-1) in both groups PDH was as active as
      in cells of controls exposed to insulin only. In cells of controls, gliclazide
      alone at 25-50 ng ml(-1) caused enzyme activation, whereas above 50 ng ml(-1) it 
      caused inhibition; in cells of patients below 50 ng ml(-1) it had no effects, but
      at 50 ng ml(-1) and above raised enzyme activity to the basal level of controls. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that free gliclazide concentrations determine
      recovery of PDH activity in circulating lymphocytes of treated patients through
      drug-mediated enhanced insulin control over PDH or through the drug alone.

TI  - Evaluation of the potential clinical and economic effects of bodyweight
      stabilisation with acarbose in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. A
      decision-analytical approach.
PG  - 449-59
AB  - Bodyweight is an acknowledged independent risk factor for coronary heart disease 
      (CHD). The present model analysis was undertaken to investigate the clinical and 
      economic impact of bodyweight gain in patients with type 2
      (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus and its effects on the development of
      CHD. Based on a retrospective re-evaluation of data from the Diabetes
      Intervention Study (DIS), patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and stable
      bodyweight (group A) had a significantly lower rate of combined CHD events
      (30.3%) than patients showing a bodyweight gain (group B; 38.2%) over 10 years.
      Prevention of bodyweight gain, therefore, appears to be a meaningful strategy in 
      the management of diabetes mellitus. In addition to this clinical advantage,
      prevention of CHD will also result in economic savings associated with avoided
      treatment of coronary events. Based on the clinical outcomes from the DIS, the
      calculated per-patient net savings for a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus
      and stable bodyweight amounted to 1085 deutschmarks (DM) when compared with a
      patient experiencing a bodyweight increase. In a further step, the above
      situation was projected to current type 2 diabetes mellitus practice. Oral
      first-line treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus is usually initiated with
      glibenclamide (glyburide), which is known to increase bodyweight (reflecting
      group B). The novel alpha-glucosidase inhibitor acarbose, in contrast, appears to
      be as effective as glibenclamide, but has the advantage of being
      bodyweight-neutral (reflecting group A). From the clinical viewpoint, acarbose
      can thus be considered an alternative to glibenclamide. From the viewpoint of
      drug costs, monotherapy with acarbose is 4 times as expensive as glibenclamide in
      Germany, resulting in per-patient incremental costs of DM3527 for acarbose over
      10 years. Balanced against the potential 10-year cost saving of DM1085 resulting 
      from the potential of acarbose to prevent CHD, around one-third of the
      incremental cost of acarbose may be recouped by this single effect. However,
      further possible benefits of acarbose, including the avoidance of hypoglycaemia
      and the deferral of costly insulin therapy, may improve the economic value of
      this novel antidiabetic agent. Given the indirect approach of this evaluation and
      its many limitations, the above findings need critical appraisal, and comparative
      trials are urgently required to substantiate our preliminary results.

PG  - 51-6
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To investigate glyburide pharmacokinetics in patients with
      well-controlled noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), and test the
      hypothesis that intersubject variability in the glyburide dose is due to patient 
      differences in the drug's pharmacokinetics. METHODS: Prospective, open-label
      study. SETTING: University-affiliated, internal medicine outpatient clinic.
      PATIENTS: Fifty-one patients with NIDDM (11 women, 40 men, mean age 56.7 +/- 15.3
      yrs) receiving oral glyburide and with well-controlled glycohemoglobin levels
      10.0% or below. INTERVENTION: After fasting overnight, patients ingested their
      regular morning dose of glyburide and then ate breakfast. Blood samples were
      drawn before dosing and between 0.5-2 hours, 2-5 hours, and 5-10 hours after
      dosing. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Serum glyburide was assayed by
      high-performance liquid chromatography and pharmacokinetics by NONMEM. Glyburide 
      clearance was proportional to weight and greater in older patients (> 60 yrs).
      CONCLUSION: Variability in the glyburide dose was not primarily due to
      intersubject differences in the drug's pharmacokinetics.

TI  - [Pharmacokinetics of hypoglycemic sulfonamides: Ozidia, a new concept].
PG  - 39-43
AB  - Hypoglycaemic sulfonamides differ in their properties, which vary in clinical
      importance. The potency of sulfonamide has increased with the generations.
      However, this potency is compensated in practice by the dose prescribed, which is
      much smaller for recent generations. The half-life is a far more important
      property. The effective action period is correlated with half-life but is much
      longer. The action period for "short-term" sulfonamides is < or = 24 h
      (tolbutamide, glipizide) and can exceed 24 h for "long-term" sulfonamides (e.g.
      glibenclamide). Metabolism and elimination reduce the risk of accumulation. All
      sulfonamides are metabolised more than 95% by the liver. The metabolites are
      inactive except for one from glibenclamide. As a function of their action period 
      and possibly of intrinsic properties, some sulfonamides more than others (e.g.
      glibenclamide) affect fasting hepatic glucose production, which is particularly
      increased early in the day in non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients because of 
      a circadian drop in insulin sensitivity (dawn phenomenon). Finally, in chronic
      administration, all sulfonamides cause a progressive desensitisation of the beta 
      cell, which responds by an insulin secretion peak only during food intake. This
      condition indicates the unuselessness of sulfonamide fractionation and, contrary 
      to the classic notion, the low risk of hypoglycaemia after a meal is skipped. The
      ideal product would be a sulfonamide with high potency and an ultra-short
      half-life, but capable of maintaining plasma concentrations for 24 h (which might
      seem incompatible except in continuous administration). Moreover, it would exert 
      its action at relatively low levels of insulinaemia and be completely
      metabolisable. Glipizide in its osmotic oral form (Ozidia) satisfies all these
      conditions since it is a very potent sulfonamide with a quite short half-life but
      with intestinal delivery up to 16 h after administration because of its osmotic
      principle. It controls fasting glycaema better than ordinary glipizide and at
      least as well as glibenclamide by acting on hepatic glucose production. Compared 
      to glibenclamide, it has the advantage of generation this effect at lower levels 
      of insulinaemia. In comparison with normal glipizide, it allows identical control
      for lower postprandial inslinaemias, which is proof of its powerful inductive
      effect on insulin sensitivity.

TI  - A short term cost-effectiveness model for oral antidiabetic medicines in Europe.
PG  - 317-26
AB  - A short term (6-month) cost-effectiveness model has been developed to simulate
      current medical practice and disease progression in patients with type 2
      (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus uncontrolled by diet and exercise. The 
      model is based on decision-analytical techniques and includes probabilities of
      switching between treatments, the reason for the switch and the most common
      switch options. Effectiveness and economic measures are the 2 main outcomes. In
      order to assess effectiveness, we use symptom-free days with acceptable control
      (SFDACs), which represent each day of treatment without adverse events or
      symptoms, and with acceptable control of glucose and lipids. For the economic
      evaluation, only incremental costs incurred directly by a health insurance system
      are considered. This model should prove useful in the evaluation of new oral
      antidiabetic agents, since the short term aim of antidiabetic therapy is to
      provide adequate control in the absence of adverse effects and symptoms (a
      prerequisite for successful long term treatment). Furthermore, short term
      analysis provides data for comparing initial investment in drug therapy with
      potential savings over a longer treatment period.

TI  - Results of a placebo-controlled study of the metabolic effects of the addition of
      metformin to sulfonylurea-treated patients. Evidence for a central role of
      adipose tissue.
PG  - 1863-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To define the metabolic effects of metformin in the treatment of NIDDM
      and to evaluate potential mechanisms for its ability to improve glycemic control.
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Sulfonylurea-treated patients, with inadequate
      glycemic control, were treated with metformin in either a placebo-controlled or
      open fashion. Measurements were made of 1) fasting and postprandial plasma
      glucose, insulin, and free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations; 2) glucose appearance
      and disappearance rates measured overnight with 3-[3H]glucose; and 3) plasma FFA 
      concentrations during a 45-min infusion period at relatively low (approximately
      60 pmol/l) insulin concentrations. RESULTS: Mean +/- SE hourly plasma glucose,
      insulin, and FFA concentrations were similar before and after treatment in the
      placebo group. In contrast, mean hourly plasma glucose concentrations were
      significantly lower (P < 0.005) after metformin treatment in both the
      placebo-controlled and open-label groups (-3.9 +/- 1.0 and -4.4 +/- 0.8 mmol/l,
      respectively). Similarly, day-long hourly FFA levels were lower (P < 0.005)
      following metformin in the placebo-controlled and open-label groups (-87 +/- 35
      and -136 +/- 31 mumol/l, respectively). Plasma insulin concentrations did not
      change with treatment in any group. Overnight glucose turnover studies indicated 
      that neither the rate of glucose appearance (hepatic glucose production) or
      glucose disappearance changed significantly with treatment in the placebo or
      metformin groups. Because plasma glucose concentration was much lower after
      metformin treatment, overnight glucose metabolic clearance rate was significantly
      (P < 0.001) lower in this group. Finally, plasma FFA concentrations in response
      to a low-dosage insulin infusion (5 mU.m-2.min-1) were significantly lower after 
      metformin as compared with the placebo-treated group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS:
      Metformin treatment was associated with significantly lower day-long plasma
      glucose and FFA concentrations. Although overnight hepatic glucose production was
      unchanged following treatment with metformin, the overnight glucose metabolic
      clearance rate significantly increased. Given these findings, it is suggested
      that at least part of the antihyperglycemic effect of metformin is due to an
      increase in glucose uptake, secondary to a decrease in release of FFA from
      adipose tissue, and lower circulating FFA concentrations.

TI  - Assisting effects of lithium on hypoglycemic treatment in patients with diabetes.
PG  - 131-7
AB  - In this article, we report the assisting effect of lithium on hypoglycemic
      treatment in patients with diabetes. Thirty-eight diabetic patients, 15 male and 
      23 female, aged 20-70 yr, 33 noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM)
      patients, and 5 insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) patients, were
      recruited in this study. Fasting and 1-h postprandial blood glucose (BG) profiles
      were undertaken from three groups of patients with diabetes before and after
      short-term of treatment of lithium carbonate. Group I was treated with diet only,
      Group II with oral hypoglycemic agents (OHA), and Group III with insulin. The
      fasting blood glucose (FBG) level and 1-h postprandial blood glucose (1-h PBG)
      level before and after treatment of lithium were: Group I: FBG: 7.67 +/- 0.48 vs 
      7.13 +/- 0.82; 1-h PBG 15.13 +/- 0.88 vs 10.33 +/- 0.96; Group II: FBG: 8.84 +/- 
      0.67 vs 6.04 +/- 0.57; 1-h PBG: 12.33 +/- 0.72 vs 9.95 +/- 0.82; Group III: FBG: 
      10.87 +/- 0.83 vs 6.83 +/- 0.79; 1-h PBG: 12.45 +/- 0.93 vs 9.17 +/- 1.00 mmol/L,
      respectively. The FBG and PBG of all three groups decreased significantly after
      lithium treatment, except the FBG in Group I. These data suggest that combined
      with other therapy, lithium could improve glucose metabolism in most patients
      with diabetes. Our results suggest that lithium has an assisting hypoglycemic
      effect on antidiabetic treatment.

TI  - Insulin and sulfonylurea therapy in NIDDM patients. Are the effects on
      lipoprotein metabolism different even with similar blood glucose control?
PG  - 1601-6
AB  - This study evaluates the effects of insulin versus glibenclamide on lipoprotein
      metabolism at comparable levels of blood glucose control, in particular on the
      concentration and distribution of VLDL subfractions and lipolytic enzyme
      activities in nine NIDDM men (aged 56 +/- 3 years, BMI 26.5 +/- 0.9 kg/m2) (means
      +/- SE) participating in a crossover study. After a 3-week washout period,
      patients were randomly assigned to 2-month treatment periods (insulin or
      glibenclamide); thereafter, each patient crossed to the other treatment. At the
      end of each period, mean daily blood glucose (MDBG), HbA1e, plasma lipids,
      lipoproteins (VLDL, LDL, HDL), lipoprotein subfractions (VLDL1, 2, 3; HDL2,
      HDL3), and post-heparin lipase activities (lipoprotein lipase [LPL], hepatic
      lipase [HL]) were evaluated. Although glucose control was similar at the end of
      both periods (MDBG 8.3 +/- 0.3 vs. 7.9 +/- 0.3 mmol/l; HbA1c 7.4 +/- 0.3 vs. 7.0 
      +/- 0.2%, insulin versus glibenclamide), insulin compared with glibenclamide
      induced a significant reduction in plasma triglycerides (0.9 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.1 +/- 
      0.1 mmol/l, P < 0.05), VLDL triglycerides (50.1 +/- 12.2 vs. 63.6 +/- 12.3 mg/dl,
      P < 0.02), VLDL1 lipid concentration (24.9 +/- 7.5 vs. 39.9 +/- 9.5 mg/dl, P <
      0.006), and increased HDL2 cholesterol (25.2 +/- 1.6 vs. 20.3 +/- 1.3 mg/dl, P < 
      0.03). In terms of VLDL percentage subfraction distribution, with insulin, there 
      was a decrease in the larger subfractions (VLDL1 26.5 +/- 3.0 vs. 37.8 +/- 3.4%, 
      P < 0.02) and an increase in the smallest (VLDL3 47.3 +/- 3.8 vs. 37.3 +/- 3.3%, 
      P < 0.05). Moreover, HL activity was significantly lower after insulin than after
      glibenclamide (HL 247.2 +/- 22.3 vs. 263.5 +/- 22.6 mU/ml, P < 0.05). In
      conclusion, compared with glibenclamide, insulin treatment (independent of
      variations in glucose control) is able to decrease significantly plasma
      triglycerides, to increase HDL2 cholesterol, and to reduce only the concentration
      of the larger VLDL subfractions, with a consequent redistribution of their
      profile.

TI  - Relative hyperproinsulinemia of NIDDM persists despite the reduction of
      hyperglycemia with insulin or sulfonylurea therapy.
PG  - 1557-62
AB  - Subjects with NIDDM have increased plasma proinsulin concentrations, compared
      with nondiabetic subjects, both in absolute terms and as a proportion of
      circulating insulin-like molecules. It remains uncertain whether this reflects a 
      primary beta-cell defect in proinsulin processing or is secondary to
      hyperglycemia. We addressed this question by assessing the effects of reducing
      hyperglycemia on relative hyperproinsulinemia in subjects with NIDDM. Eight
      subjects with NIDDM underwent three 8-week periods in a randomized crossover
      design of therapy with diet alone, sulfonylurea (gliclazide), or insulin
      (ultralente). The effects on beta-cell peptide concentrations were assessed 1)
      fasting, 2) in response to hyperglycemic clamping, and 3) in response to an
      injection of the nonglucose secretogogue arginine and compared with measurements 
      in seven nondiabetic control subjects. Both sulfonylurea and insulin therapy
      substantially reduced fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1e) 
      concentrations, compared with diet therapy alone. The diabetic subjects on diet
      therapy had relative hyperproinsulinemia, assessed relative to C-peptide
      concentrations, fasting and in response to hyperglycemic clamping and arginine,
      compared with control subjects. Neither sulfonylurea nor insulin therapy altered 
      the relative hyperproinsulinemia. Insulin therapy reduced fasting proinsulin
      concentrations from geometric mean 29.4 (1 SD range, 14.6-59.0) pmol/l on diet
      therapy to 18.7 (7.3-48.1) pmol/l (P < 0.05). A similar trend was evident with
      fasting C-peptide concentrations with a reduction from 0.9 (0.6-1.4) nmol/l on
      diet therapy to 0.6 (0.4-0.9) nmol/l (P = 0.06), so that the relative
      hyperproinsulinemia, assessed as the ratio of fasting proinsulin to C-peptide,
      was unchanged by insulin. Similarly, insulin therapy failed to reduce the ratio
      of proinsulin to C-peptide concentrations in response to a hyperglycemic clamp
      and in the acute incremental response to arginine. Failure to improve the
      relative hyperproinsulinemia of NIDDM, despite significant reduction of
      hyperglycemia with exogenous insulin therapy, supports the hypothesis that
      relative hyperproinsulinemia in NIDDM is a reflection of a primary beta-cell
      defect rather than being secondary to hyperglycemia.

TI  - Monitoring of metabolic control in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes
      mellitus on oral hypoglycaemic agents: value of evening blood glucose
      determination.
PG  - 798-802
AB  - Monitoring of metabolic control in patients with non-insulin-dependent (Type 2)
      diabetes (NIDDM) is usually based upon blood glucose assay in the morning (after 
      an overnight fast) and in the postprandial state (breakfast or lunch). However,
      this schedule does not seek low blood glucose values, especially in the evening. 
      We have conducted a prospective study of laboratory blood glucose profiles (8 am,
      9.30 am after a 35 g carbohydrate breakfast and in the evening between 5 and 7
      pm). We have included 58 consecutive NIDDM patients regularly followed in our
      clinic (39 men, age 60 +/- 11.5 years, diabetes duration 8.6 +/- 6.5 years, BMI
      25.5 +/- 3 kg m-2), treated with the sulphonylurea gliclazide, alone (40-320 mg
      24 h-1, mean 170 +/- 110 mg) (group 1, n = 32) or in combination with metformin
      (1000-3000 mg 24 h-1, 2400 +/- 620 mg) (group 2, n = 26). All patients were
      stable, with no change in dosage for at least 3 months. Mean glycaemic control
      was good (group 1 HbA1c: 6.5 +/- 1.1%, group 2: 6.9 +/- 0.7%). Evening blood
      glucose values were the lowest of the day in 26 patients of group 1 (81.3%) and
      in 22 of group 2 (84.6%). Mean evening blood glucose levels were lower (p =
      0.001) than 8 am values (group 1: 5.8 +/- 1.4 vs 6.1 +/- 1.6 mmol l-1, group 2:
      6.5 +/- 1.8 vs 6.9 +/- 1.9) and than 9.30 am values (group 1: 7.6 +/- 1.5, group 
      2: 12.3 +/- 2.8). No blood glucose values in the hypoglycaemic range were
      observed. HbA1c was strongly correlated (p = 0.002 to 0.0001) in the whole group 
      with 8 am (r = 0.39), 9.30 am (r = 0.56), and evening blood glucose values (r =
      0.42). These results indicate that, in patients treated with the sulphonylurea
      gliclazide, alone or in combination with metformin, the lowest blood glucose
      values occur in the evening more frequently (4/5) than in the morning. Therefore,
      evening blood glucose determination should be performed systematically in the
      course of the metabolic evaluation of NIDDM patients on oral hypoglycaemic
      agents.

TI  - Pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes and modes of action of therapeutic
      interventions.
PG  - 1802-17
AB  - At least 90% of the 12 to 15 million persons with diabetes mellitus in the United
      States, half of whose condition remains undiagnosed, have type 2 diabetes. Type 2
      diabetes is preceded by a long period of impaired glucose tolerance, a reversible
      metabolic state associated with increased prevalence of macrovascular
      complications. Thus, at the time of diagnosis, long-term complications have
      developed in almost one fourth of patients. Susceptibility to type 2 diabetes
      requires genetic (most likely polygenic) and acquired factors, and its
      pathogenesis involves an interplay of progressive insulin resistance and
      beta-cell failure. The ideal treatment of type 2 diabetes should reverse insulin 
      resistance and beta-cell dysfunction in most treated patients and prevent, delay,
      or reverse long-term complications. Current strategies are aimed at amelioration 
      of insulin resistance (diet, exercise, weight loss, and metformin and
      troglitazone therapy), augmentation of insulin supply (sulfonylurea and insulin
      therapy), or limitation of postprandial hyperglycemia (acarbose therapy). Future 
      therapies probably will target (1) insulin resistance, using a multifaceted
      approach; (2) hepatic glucose production, using gluconeogenesis inhibitors; (3)
      excess nonesterified fatty acid production, using lipolysis inhibitors; and (4)
      fat oxidation, using carnitine palmitoyltransferase I and II inhibitors. Attempts
      also could be made to stimulate energy expenditure and increase nonoxidative
      glucose disposal by means of beta 3-adrenoceptor agonists. One promising strategy
      is an attack on multiple pathophysiological processes by combining antidiabetic
      agents with disparate mechanisms of action. Thus, we now have unprecedented
      resources for drug therapy for diabetes, with great opportunity for innovative
      combinations. It is hoped that these expanded choices will provide the tools
      necessary for a more efficient management of type 2 diabetes and prevention of
      its long-term complications.

TI  - Glibenclamide, but not acarbose, increases leptin concentrations parallel to
      changes in insulin in subjects with NIDDM.
PG  - 1430-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To hypothesize if glibenclamide, which increases insulin levels, also 
      increases leptin concentrations. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Leptin is a hormone
      that regulates weight in mice. In obese humans, leptin concentrations are
      increased, suggesting resistance to the effects of this hormone. Although
      short-term infusion of insulin during the hyperinsulinemiceuglycemic clamp does
      not increase leptin concentration, the effect of oral antidiabetic agents on
      leptin concentration is unknown. Differing effects can be expected, since
      glibenclamide acts via stimulation of insulin secretion, whereas acarbose
      inhibits alpha-glucosidases of the small intestine and has no direct effect on
      insulin levels. We examined the effect of acarbose (n = 4), glibenclamide (n =
      6), and placebo (n = 6) on insulin and leptin levels during 24-h periods before
      and after 16 weeks of therapy. RESULTS: We observed a significant diurnal
      variation in leptin concentrations. This was inversely related to insulin levels 
      during the 24-h follow-up with usual diet. Neither the placebo nor acarbose
      altered leptin concentrations. However, glibenclamide increased leptin
      concentrations parallel to insulin levels. There were only minor changes in body 
      weight during the l6-week follow-up: decrease in the placebo group (change -0.5
      kg/m2, P = 0.07) and acarbose (change -0.7 kg/m2, P = 0.046) and increase in the 
      glibenclamide group (change 0.8 kg/m2, P = 0.27). However, individual subjects
      who gained weight had increases in their leptin concentrations. The diurnal
      variation in leptin concentrations was preserved after glibenclamide.
      CONCLUSIONS: Glibenclamide increases circadian leptin and insulin concentrations,
      whereas acarbose does not. This observation may help to explain weight gain in
      subjects treated with glibenclamide and stable weight in those treated with
      acarbose in the long run.

TI  - [Value of biguanide in therapy of diabetes mellitus].
PG  - 472-9, 505
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Biguanides have been used in treatment of diabetes
      mellitus for over 30 years now. Due to frequent occurrence of lactic acidosis,
      particularly in patients with serious contraindications to biguanide therapy and 
      in cases of non-compliance with dosage instructions, buformin and phenformin were
      taken off the market in most European countries at the end of the seventies.
      Metformin continued to be allowed, since the risk of lactic acidosis is 20 times 
      less than with phenformin or buformin due to the different pharmacokinetic
      properties of the substance. Plenty of clinical experience has been gained with
      metformin, documented in a large number of reliable long-term studies. FINDINGS: 
      Metformin lowers fasting blood glucose levels by an average of 25% (17 to 37%),
      postprandial blood glucose by up to 44.5% and HbA1c bei 1.5% (0.8 to 3.1%)
      Metformin reduces raised plasma insulin levels in cases of metabolic syndrome by 
      as much as 30% and reduces the "insulin requirement" of type 2 insulin-treated
      diabetics by 15 to 32%. It has well documented effects on various rheological
      parameters. In overweight type 2 diabetics, metformin shows the same level of
      hypoglycaemic effect as all of the important sulfonylurea derivatives used in
      Europe. The active mechanism of these derivatives is, however, concentrated
      solely on reduction of blood glucose. This mechanism does not take into account
      the remaining risk constellation involved in insulin resistance. Biguanides,
      similarly to weight reduction, lead to a reduction of hyperinsulinaemia, which is
      by contrast exacerbated by sulfonylureas and, in particular, exogenous insulin.
      CONCLUSION: The risk of lactic acidosis can probably be eliminated entirely if
      dosage instructions and contraindications are observed carefully. The cause of
      such neglect in 83% of all cases was limited on renal function (serum creatinine 
      > 1.5 mg%). Regarding morbidity and mortality from lactic acidosis, metformin
      therapy is no riskier than treatment with the sulfonylurea derivative
      glibenclamide, taking into account the incidence of fatal hypoglycaemias with the
      latter.

TI  - Effect of glibenclamide on insulin release at moderate and high blood glucose
      levels in normal man.
PG  - 685-9
AB  - Insulin release occurs in two phases; sulphonylurea derivatives may have
      different potencies in stimulating first- and second-phase insulin release. We
      studied the effect of glibenclamide on insulin secretion at submaximally and
      maximally stimulating blood glucose levels with a primed hyperglycaemic glucose
      clamp. Twelve healthy male subjects, age (mean +/- SEM) 22.5 +/- 0.5 years, body 
      mass index (BMI) 21.7 +/- 0.6 kgm-2, were studied in a randomized, double-blind
      study design. Glibenclamide 10 mg or placebo was taken before a 4-h
      hyperglycaemic clamp (blood glucose 8 mmol L-1 during the first 2 h and 32 mmol
      L-1 during the next 2 h). During hyperglycaemic clamp at 8 mmol L-1, the areas
      under the delta insulin curve (AUC delta insulin, mean +/- SEM) from 0 to 10 min 
      (first phase) were not different: 1007 +/- 235 vs. 1059 +/- 261 pmol L-1 x 10 min
      (with and without glibenclamide, P = 0.81). However, glibenclamide led to a
      significantly larger increase in AUC delta insulin from 30 to 120 min (second
      phase): 16087 +/- 4489 vs. 7107 +/- 1533 pmol L-1 x 90 min (with and without
      glibenclamide respectively, P < 0.03). The same was true for AUC delta C-peptide 
      no difference from 0 to 10 min but a significantly higher AUC delta C-peptide
      from 30 to 120 min on the glibenclamide day (P < 0.01). The M/I ratio (mean
      glucose infusion rate divided by mean plasma insulin concentration) from 60 to
      120 min, a measure of insulin sensitivity, did not change: 0.26 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.22
      +/- 0.03 mumol kg-1 min-1 pmol L-1 (with and without glibenclamide, P = 0.64).
      During hyperglycaemic clamp at 32 mmol L-1, the AUC delta insulin from 120 to 130
      min (first phase) was not different on both study days: 2411 +/- 640 vs. 3193 +/-
      866 pmol L-1 x 10 min (with and without glibenclamide, P = 0.29). AUC delta
      insulin from 150 to 240 min (second phase) also showed no difference: 59623 +/-
      8735 vs. 77389 +/- 15161 pmol L-1 x 90 min (with and without glibenclamide, P =
      0.24). AUC delta C-peptide from 120 to 130 min and from 150 to 240 min were
      slightly lower on the glibenclamide study day (both P < 0.04). The M/I ratio from
      180 to 240 min did not change: 0.24 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.30 +/- 0.07 mumol kg-1 min-1
      pmol L-1 (with and without glibenclamide, P = 0.25). In conclusion, glibenclamide
      increases second-phase insulin secretion only at a submaximally stimulating blood
      glucose level without enhancement of first-phase insulin release and has no
      additive effect on insulin secretion at maximally stimulating blood glucose
      levels. Glibenclamide did not change insulin sensitivity in this acute
      experiment.

TI  - Treatment with the oral antidiabetic agent troglitazone improves beta cell
      responses to glucose in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance.
PG  - 530-7
AB  - Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is associated with defects in both insulin
      secretion and action and carries a high risk for conversion to
      non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Troglitazone, an insulin
      sensitizing agent, reduces glucose concentrations in subjects with NIDDM and IGT 
      but is not known to affect insulin secretion. We sought to determine the role of 
      beta cell function in mediating improved glucose tolerance. Obese subjects with
      IGT received 12 wk of either 400 mg daily of troglitazone (n = 14) or placebo (n 
      = 7) in a randomized, double-blind design. Study measures at baseline and after
      treatment were glucose and insulin responses to a 75-g oral glucose tolerance
      test, insulin sensitivity index (SI) assessed by a frequently sampled intravenous
      glucose tolerance test, insulin secretion rates during a graded glucose infusion,
      and beta cell glucose-sensing ability during an oscillatory glucose infusion.
      Troglitazone reduced integrated glucose and insulin responses to oral glucose by 
      10% (P = 0.03) and 39% (P = 0.003), respectively. SI increased from 1.3+/-0.3 to 
      2.6+/-0.4 x 10(-)5min-1pM-1 (P = 0.005). Average insulin secretion rates adjusted
      for SI over the glucose interval 5-11 mmol/liter were increased by 52% (P =
      0.02), and the ability of the beta cell to entrain to an exogenous oscillatory
      glucose infusion, as evaluated by analysis of spectral power, was improved by 49%
      (P = 0.04). No significant changes in these parameters were demonstrated in the
      placebo group. In addition to increasing insulin sensitivity, we demonstrate that
      troglitazone improves the reduced beta cell response to glucose characteristic of
      subjects with IGT. This appears to be an important factor in the observed
      improvement in glucose tolerance.

TI  - Beta cell response to oral glimepiride administration during and following a
      hyperglycaemic clamp in NIDDM patients.
PG  - 556-63
AB  - The aim of the present study was to assess the beta cell response to glimepiride,
      administered orally, during and following a hyperglycaemic clamp in 14 NIDDM
      patients (7 males), aged 62.5 (St. Dev. 7.7) years with a body mass index of 27.3
      (2.8) kg m(-2) and HbA(Ic) of 7.0 (0.7)% at baseline, in a placebo controlled
      study. All patients were on stable treatment with a second generation
      sulphonylurea for at least 8 weeks prior to randomization and received placebo
      (P) or 5 mg glimepiride (G) daily for 7 days and 10 mg prior to a hyperglycaemic 
      clamp (10.9 mmol l(-1) for 60 min, preceded by i.v. insulin infusion to stabilize
      fasting blood glucose levels at 4.0 mmol l(-1)). The clamp was followed by an
      observation period of 2 h in 5 subjects and 3.5 h in the next 9 subjects, during 
      which blood glucose and plasma insulin, C-peptide and proinsulin levels were
      measured at regular intervals to determine the effect of glimepiride on the
      interaction between changes in glycaemia and plasma levels of beta cell products.
      Neither G nor P elicited a first phase insulin response. Areas under plasma
      insulin curve during the 1 h hyperglycaemic clamp were 94.2 (39.5) vs 69.1 (26.5)
      pmol.h l(-1) in G and P clamps, respectively (p = 0.002). Total areas (AUC) under
      the plasma insulin curve were 377 (145) vs 271 (113) pmol.h l(-1) in G and P
      clamps (< 0.05). Total AUCs of C-peptide were 309 (96) and 259 (102 pmol.h.(-1), 
      in G and P clamps, respectively, p = 0.01. Total AUCs of proinsulin were 176 (77)
      versus 119 (56) pmol.h l(-1) in G and P clamps, respectively, p = 0.004. Five
      hours after G and P administration blood glucose levels were 4.7) 92.1) mmol(-1) 
      in the G clamp vs 6.2 (1.9) mmol l(-1) in the P clamp (p = 0.001). The number of 
      hypoglycaemic events (blood glucose < 3.0 mmol l(-1)) in the 3.5 h observation
      period was 3 in G clamps vs 0 in P clamps (p = ns). In conclusion, glimepiride
      stimulates the second phase insulin and proinsulin secretion. The lowering of
      blood glucose levels is not accompanied by a commensurate inhibition of the
      insulin secretion. Further studies are required to compare this new drug with
      currently available oral hypoglycaemic agents, with respect to glycaemic control 
      and the risk of hypoglycaemia.

TI  - Effect of insulin treatment on circulating islet amyloid polypeptide in patients 
      with NIDDM.
PG  - 472-6
AB  - The objective was to evaluate the effect of insulin treatment on circulating
      islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP). Twelve patients with NIDDM and secondary
      failure were studied on oral agents and then switched to insulin treatment.
      Fasting and postprandial IAPP concentrations were measured on oral treatment and 
      on insulin treatment. In 5 of the patients no postprandial concentrations were
      determined. In the 7 patients who were investigated both fasting and
      postprandially the fasting IAPP concentration was 6.5 +/- 1.2 pmol l(-1) (mean
      +/- SEM) during oral treatment with a rise to 13.5 +/- 3.1 90 min after breakfast
      (p = 0.028). On insulin treatment HbA1c decreased from 8.6 +/- 0.5 to 7.5 +/-
      0.4% (p< 0.03) and plasma C-peptide concentration was significantly lowered (p<
      0.01). There was a close correlation using simple regression between the per cent
      change of IAPP concentration and the per cent change of C-peptide concentration
      during this period (r = 0.88; p< 0.01). In the total patient material of 12
      patients there was a significant correlation using simple regression analysis
      between per cent change of IAPP concentration and per cent change of C-peptide
      concentration using all 48 measurements available (r = 0.58: p< 0.001). These
      data suggest that secretion of IAPP is lowered when endogenous insulin secretion 
      is lowered by administration of exogenous insulin in patients with NIDDM. Thus,
      if IAPP secretion has a pathogenetic role in the development of beta cell failure
      in NIDDM, insulin treatment might delay this deterioration.

TI  - Treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with metformin.
PG  - 213-21
AB  - BACKGROUND: Metformin alleviates hyperglycemia of non-insulin-dependent diabetes 
      mellitus (NIDDM) by inhibiting hepatic glucose production and improving
      peripheral insulin sensitivity. In contrast to sulfonylureas, metformin does not 
      stimulate insulin-secretion, promote weight gain, exacerbate hyperinsulinemia, or
      cause hypoglycemia. It also favorably affects serum lipids. METHODS: A
      comprehensive review of the medical literature from 1968 to the present was
      conducted using the key words "metformin" and "non-insulin-dependent diabetes
      mellitus." RESULTS: Metformin monotherapy was superior to placebo and comparable 
      to sulfonylureas in reducing fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin
      levels in patients with NIDDM uncontrolled by diet. Metformin and sulfonylureas, 
      however, had diverse effects on body weight and fasting plasma insulin levels;
      both weight and insulin levels remained unchanged or decreased with metformin and
      increased with sulfonylureas. In patients with secondary sulfonylurea failure,
      the combination of metformin and a sulfonylurea synergistically improved glycemic
      control better than either drug alone and was comparable to insulin plus
      sulfonylurea. When hyperglycemia is uncontrolled by insulin after secondary
      sulfonylurea failure, limited data suggest the efficacy of metformin plus
      insulin. The mild, transient, self-limited gastrointestinal side effects that
      sometimes occur can be minimized by gradually increasing the doses and by taking 
      metformin with food. Risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is low if
      prescribing guidelines are adhered to. Potential adverse drug interactions
      include hypoglycemia during concurrent sulfonylurea therapy and elevated
      metformin plasma concentrations when metformin is taken concomitantly with
      cimetidine. CONCLUSIONS: Metformin can be used safely and effectively as
      first-line monotherapy in NIDDM or in combination with a sulfonylurea when
      monotherapy with either agent fails. It can be particularly suitable when weight 
      gain, hyperlipidemia, and hypoglycemia are clinically important issues.

TI  - Oral antihyperglycaemics. Considerations in older patients with
      non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 323-31
AB  - Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is increasing in incidence as the
      population in most countries ages. Multiple pathology is common in the elderly,
      and cardiovascular disease is usually present at diagnosis. Patients who develop 
      NIDDM at age 65 years may live long enough to develop microvascular
      complications. Others who are frail and have multiple pathologies may require
      treatment to prevent both symptomatic hyperglycaemia and dehydration, whilst
      avoiding hypoglycaemia. The goals in the management of NIDDM in elderly people
      are the prevention of complications and the relief of symptoms. Treatment must be
      tailored to the individual's expectations and should be reviewed regularly with
      the changing circumstances of aging. If dietary measures fail to control glucose 
      levels, antihyperglycaemic sulphonylureas are the most frequently prescribed form
      of treatment. However, concern over the potential of these drugs to cause
      hypoglycaemia limits the choice to second generation sulphonylureas, agents that 
      preserve the first phase of insulin release and have non-biologically active
      metabolites that are promptly eliminated. The biguanide agent metformin is also
      appropriate in elderly obese patients with NIDDM who do not have renal, liver or 
      cardiac failure. The combination of a sulphonylurea and metformin can be
      effective in patients in whom insulin would otherwise be required. Novel
      compounds such as acarbose and the thiazolinediones may also be useful in the
      treatment of older diabetic patients.

TI  - Comparative effects of glibenclamide and metformin on ambulatory blood pressure
      and cardiovascular reactivity in NIDDM.
PG  - 692-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of chronic glibenclamide and metformin therapy 
      on blood pressure (BP) and cardiovascular responsiveness in patients with NIDDM. 
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Fourteen patients with NIDDM received metformin or
      glibenclamide for 1 month in a double-blind, randomized crossover study. At the
      end of each treatment period, patients were tested for forearm vascular
      responsiveness to intrabrachial arterial infusion of diazoxide (an ATP-sensitive 
      potassium channel opener), acetylcholine, sodium nitroprusside, and
      norepinephrine, BP responses to intravenous infusions of NE and angiotensin II,
      BP responses to cold pressor testing and isometric exercise, and 24-h ambulatory 
      BP monitoring. RESULTS: Metformin and glibenclamide produced similar glycemic
      control. Mean 24-h BPs did not differ between the two groups, but mean 24-h heart
      rates were significantly lower (75 +/- 6 bpm vs. 80 +/- 6 bpm) on glibenclamide
      therapy than on metformin. Plasma norepinephrine levels were significantly higher
      on glibenclamide (6.41 +/- 1.77 vs. 4.26 +/- 1.54 mmol/l, P < 0.01), and systolic
      BP responses to intravenous norepinephrine and angiotensin II were significantly 
      higher on glibenclamide than on metformin (P < 0.02 and P < 0.05, respectively). 
      Systolic BP responses to cold pressor testing appeared higher on glibenclamide
      than on metformin, but the difference did not quite achieve statistical
      significance (P = 0.052). Baseline forearm vascular resistance did not differ
      between the two drugs, nor did forearm vascular resistance responses to
      diazoxide, acetylcholine, sodium nitroprusside, and norepinephrine differ.
      CONCLUSIONS: Glibenclamide therapy is accompanied by greater systolic BP
      responses to norepinephrine and angiotensin II and higher plasma norepinephrine
      levels than those that occur on metformin therapy. Lower heart rates on
      glibenclamide therapy despite evidence of greater sympathetic activity suggests
      that glibenclamide may have negative chronotropic effects.

TI  - Metformin hydrochloride: an antihyperglycemic agent.
PG  - 893-903
AB  - The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, drug
      interactions, and dosage and administration of metformin hydrochloride are
      reviewed. Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent; it lowers the blood glucose
      concentration without causing hypoglycemia. Proposed mechanisms of action include
      decreased intestinal absorption of glucose, increased glucose uptake from the
      blood into the tissues, decreased glucose production in the liver, and decreased 
      insulin requirements for glucose disposal. Metformin is slowly absorbed from the 
      small intestine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism. The half-life is about
      five hours. The major route of elimination is renal; the drug is contraindicated 
      in patients with impaired renal function. In double-blind, placebo-controlled
      trials, metformin has shown efficacy in the treatment of non-insulin-dependent
      diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). The drug is as effective as sulfonylureas in patients 
      with diabetes who are nonobese or obese and whose diabetes is uncontrolled by
      diet alone. Metformin may be useful as addon therapy in obese patients with
      diabetes uncontrolled by sulfonylureas and diet. Lipid profiles may be favorably 
      influenced. The most common adverse effects are gastrointestinal. A rare but
      potentially fatal adverse effect is lactic acidosis. Metformin has the potential 
      to interact with cationic drugs eliminated by the renal tubular pathway. The
      usual effective dosage is 1.5-2.5 g/day orally in two or three divided doses.
      Metformin hydrochloride is an effective alternative to sulfonylureas in obese and
      non-obese patients with NIDDM in whom diet alone has not achieved glycemic
      control, and it may be useful as addon therapy in patients whose diabetes has not
      responded adequately to sulfonylureas plus dietary measures.

TI  - Concentration-effect relations of glibenclamide and its active metabolites in
      man: modelling of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.
PG  - 373-81
AB  - AIMS: The main purpose of this paper is to describe the relationship between
      serum concentrations of glibenclamide and its main metabolites and the effects on
      blood glucose levels, the clinically most relevant parameter to assess in
      diabetes. METHODS: Serum concentrations and blood glucose lowering effects
      (expressed as percent blood glucose reduction vs placebo) of glibenclamide (Gb)
      and its active metabolites, 4-trans-hydroxy-(M1) and 3-cis-hydroxy-glibenclamide 
      (M2), were analysed in eight healthy subjects participating in a
      placebo-controlled, randomized, single-blind crossover study, using intravenous
      administration of each compound as well as oral administration of Gb. RESULTS:
      Plots of % blood glucose reduction vs log serum concentration demonstrated
      counter-clockwise hysteresis for parent drug and its metabolites. An effect
      compartment was linked to appropriate pharmacokinetic models and pharmacokinetic 
      and pharmacodynamic modelling was used to fit the pharmacokinetics of Gb by both 
      routes and the metabolites for each individual. Based on the individual
      concentration-time profiles a PK/PD-model was applied to all effect data
      simultaneously. An increase in the steady-state serum concentration when the
      effect is 50% of maximal, CEss50, was found in the sequence M1 (23 ng ml-1), M2
      (37 ng ml-1) and Gb (108 ng ml-1). Corresponding interindividual variabilities
      expressed as CV% were 25%, 47% and 26%. The elimination rate constants from the
      effect site (kEO) were estimated and increased in the order M1 (0.178 h-1, CV
      13%), M2 (0.479 h-1, CV 8.5%) and Gb (1.59 h-1, CV 36%). Corresponding
      equilibration half-lives for the effect site (kEO-HL) were 3.9 h, 1.4 h and 0.44 
      h. Estimated Emax-values obtained for M1, M2 and Gb were 40% (CV 30%), 27% (CV
      56%) and 56% (CV 14%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that the two
      major metabolites of Gb are hypoglycaemic in man, that they may have higher
      activity at low concentrations and that they may have a longer effect duration
      than the parent drug.

TI  - Sulfonylurea treatment prevents recurrence of hyperglycemia in obese
      African-American patients with a history of hyperglycemic crises.
PG  - 479-83
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Many newly diagnosed obese African-American patients with history of
      severe hyperglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) are able to discontinue
      pharmacological treatment with continued good metabolic control. However, many of
      these individuals relapse into hyperglycemia within 1 year. In such patients, we 
      compared the effect of low-dose sulfonylurea and dietary therapy in the
      prevention of recurrence of hyperglycemia. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We
      conducted an intention-to-treat study in 35 obese newly diagnosed diabetic
      patients (17 with DKA and 18 with severe hyperglycemia). After discontinuation of
      insulin, seven of 17 patients with DKA and seven of 18 patients with
      hyperglycemia were managed with diet and glyburide (1.25-2.5 mg/day), whereas
      other patients were followed with diet alone. In all patients, pancreatic insulin
      reserve was documented 1 day after resolution of hyperglycemic crises and within 
      1 week of discontinuation of insulin. Recurrence of hyperglycemia was defined as 
      fasting blood glucose > 7.8 mmol/l (140 mg/dl) or random blood glucose > 10
      mmol/l (180 mg/dl) on two or more consecutive determinations, or HbA1c > 7.5%.
      RESULTS: Both treatment groups were comparable in age, sex, duration of diabetes,
      months of insulin therapy, BMI, glucose, and HbA1c. At presentation, the acute
      C-peptide response to glucagon in obese DKA patients was lower than in patients
      with hyperglycemia (P < 0.01), but responses were comparable after
      discontinuation of insulin. Sulfonylurea treatment significantly reduced
      recurrence of hyperglycemia in both obese DKA and obese hyperglycemic patients (P
      = 0.03). With a median follow-up of 16 months, hyperglycemia recurred in six of
      10 DKA patients and in five of 11 hyperglycemia patients treated with diet alone,
      compared with one of seven DKA and one of seven hyperglycemia patients treated
      with glyburide. Readmission with metabolic decompensation occurred in four
      patients treated with diet but in none of the patients treated with diet and
      glyburide. CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose sulfonylurea therapy prevents recurrence of
      hyperglycemia in newly diagnosed obese African-American patients with a history
      of hyperglycemic crises.

TI  - Novel MODY3 mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha gene: evidence for 
      a hyperexcitability of pancreatic beta-cells to intravenous secretagogues in a
      glucose-tolerant carrier of a P447L mutation.
PG  - 726-30
AB  - One form of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY3) results from mutations
      in the hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1alpha gene, located on chromosome
      12q24.2. The primary objective of the present study was to search for genetic
      variation in the HNF-1alpha gene in nine nonrelated Danish Caucasian subjects
      with MODY. Direct sequencing of the coding region and intron-exon boundaries of
      the HNF-1alpha gene revealed 2 novel and 1 previously reported missense mutations
      and 2 novel frameshift mutations in five of nine MODY subjects. These five
      mutations were found in neither 84 NIDDM patients nor 84 control subjects. One
      glucose-tolerant lean male with a P447L missense mutation, which in his relatives
      caused MODY, underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), a tolbutamide
      modified frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test, and a glucagon
      test to examine for a possible early beta-cell abnormality. He had a low insulin 
      secretion rate during an OGTT, but a twofold increase in pancreatic beta-cell
      response after intravenous glucose and a 2.5- to 4-fold increase in beta-cell
      response after either intravenous tolbutamide or intravenous glucagon loads. In
      conclusion, 1) mutations in the HNF-1alpha gene are common in Danish Caucasian
      MODY patients, and 2) early stages in the pathogenesis of MODY3 caused by the
      P447L mutation may be characterized by a hyperexcitability of beta-cells to
      intravenous secretagogues.

AB  - The duration of action and the pharmacokinetics of gliquidone
      (1-cyclohexyl-3-[[4-[2-(3,4-dihydro-7-methoxy-4,4-dimethyl-1,
      3-dioxo-2(1H)-isochinolyl)ethyl]phenyl]-sulfonyl]-urea, AR-DF 26 SE, CAS
      33342-05-1, Glurenorm, Beglynor) were investigated in 32 patients with
      non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus over 16 h. In a single-blinded
      cross-over design vs. placebo, one 30 mg tablet gliquidone was administered 15
      min before breakfast. Concomitant to the measurement of glucose and insulin, the 
      gliquidone plasma levels of 20 subjects were determined by a new specific liquid 
      chromatographic (HPLC) assay method with fluorescence detection, and the
      pharmacokinetic parameters calculated. Following the gliquidone administration,
      the mean plasma glucose profiles of the responders were up to 15% lower than with
      placebo (p < 0.005) between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m., representing a duration of the
      blood sugar-lowering effect of 8 to 10 h. Insulin values were raised, with peaks 
      over 40% higher, during or shortly after meals. Subsequently, the insulin levels 
      returned to approximately the same levels obtained with placebo during the
      postprandial phase. Plasma concentrations of gliquidone showed pronounced
      interindividual variability. The mean maximum concentration in plasma Cmax was
      0.65 microgram/ml, (range: 0.12-2.14 micrograms/ml, coefficient of variation
      (CV): 82%). The median time to reach maximum plasma concentrations tmax was 2.25 
      h (range: 1.25-4.75 h). The areas under the plasma concentration-time curve from 
      zero time to infinity (AUC0-infinity) and the mean terminal elimination
      half-lives (t1/2 beta) were computed from those patients (N = 8) who exhibited at
      least five plasma levels above the limit of quantitation in the terminal
      log-linear phase using a two-compartment model: the mean AUC0-infinity was 5.1
      micrograms.h/ml (range: 1.5-10.1 micrograms.h/ml, CV 56%). The dominant half-life
      t1/2 alpha derived from therapeutically relevant plasma levels of gliquidone (>
      80 ng/ml) was approximately 1.2 h (range: 0.4-3.0 h. CV: 71%) and the mean
      terminal half-life t1/2 beta was approximately 8 h (range: 5.7-9.4 h, CV: 17%).
      From the pharmacodynamic behavior as well as from the pharmacokinetic parameters 
      it can be deduced that gliquidone belongs to the class of short-acting
      sulfonylureas used in antidiabetic therapy.

TI  - Increased complications in noninsulin-dependent diabetic patients treated with
      insulin versus oral hypoglycemic agents: a population study.
PG  - 181-9
AB  - A cross-sectional population study was performed in a cohort of 890
      non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) patients residing in the greater 
      Denver metropolitan region. Its purpose was to evaluate the relationship between 
      insulin and oral hypoglycemic agents (OHAs) with regard to metabolic control and 
      diabetic complications. The mean glycosylated hemoglobin for patients treated
      with insulin was 12.0 +/- 0.15% versus 11.4 +/- 0.14% (p < .03) for OHA. The
      difference in fasting blood sugar for the insulin-treated group (195.0 +/- 3.5
      mg/dl) versus the OHA-treated group (194.0 +/- 2.9 mg/dl) was not statistically
      significant. Categorical increases in urinary albumin excretion were associated
      positively within insulin versus OHA therapy (p < .0001). Patients treated with
      insulin therapy had a higher frequency of peripheral vascular disease (insulin
      therapy, 14%; OHA therapy, 10%; p < .05); neuropathy (insulin therapy, 55%; OHA
      therapy, 37%; p < .0001); and retinopathy (insulin therapy, 71%; OHA therapy,
      45%; p < .0001). The frequency of cardiovascular disease was equivalent in the
      two groups (17% versus 13%). In protocols correcting for diabetes duration,
      glycosylated hemoglobin, and gender in a multivariate model, the use of insulin
      still was related significantly to increases in urinary albumin excretion (p <
      .01), retinopathy (p < .0001), and neuropathy (p < .0008). In a subgroup of
      individuals with diabetes duration > 10 years (n = 211 for insulin treatment, n =
      118 for OHA treatment), the frequency of neuropathy still was significantly
      higher in the insulin group (63% vs 49%; p < .016) as was retinopathy (85% vs
      58%; p < .0001). Overt albuminuria also was more significant in the
      insulin-treated patients (p < .04). In summary, the NIDDM patients treated with
      insulin had more nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy than did NIDDM patients
      treated with OHA, independent of duration of diabetes, fasting blood glucose,
      glycosylated hemoglobin, age, and blood pressure level. These results in NIDDM
      patients may be due to contributions from worse blood glucose control at an
      earlier stage in the patients' diabetes and/or the mitogenic, atherogenic,
      thrombogenic, and vascular permeability effects of insulin.

TI  - Short-term effects of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion treatment on
      insulin secretion in non-insulin-dependent overweight patients with poor
      glycaemic control despite maximal oral anti-diabetic treatment.
PG  - 51-7
AB  - It is difficult to treat obese non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients (NIDDs)
      whose glycaemic control remains poor despite maximal oral antidiabetic therapy.
      We studied the effect of a continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII)
      associated with a low-calorie diet and metformin 1,700 mg/day on glycaemic
      control and basal and stimulated insulin secretion in a series of 82 overweight
      NIDD before (T1), during CSII (T2), and after CSII withdrawal (T3). Patients were
      treated for 8 to 23 days with a mean amount of 0.50 +/- 0.02 IU/kg/day. Glycaemic
      control was very good after 3-5 days of CSII and remained good at T3. At T2,
      fasting and postprandial plasma C peptide levels decreased significantly. At T3, 
      fasting C peptide was very similar to T1, and postprandial C peptide was
      significantly higher than at T1. The molar fasting and postprandial plasma C
      peptide/glycaemia ratios increased significantly at T3. After glucagon injection,
      the molar delta C peptide/glycaemia ratio was significantly increased at T2 and
      even higher at T3. At T2, as at T1 and T3, there were significant correlations
      between fasting and postprandial C peptide levels and between the
      glucagon-induced C peptide peak and fasting and postprandial C peptide levels.
      Between T1 and T3 weight changes correlated significantly with the molar fasting 
      C peptide/glycaemia ratio at T1. Twenty-nine of the 30 patients for whom this
      ratio was > 6.6 x 10(-8) lost weight. The length of CSII treatment did not
      correlate with weight changes or other biological parameters. This study shows
      that CSII with moderate amounts of insulin associated with a low-calorie diet and
      metformin provided rapid glycaemic control, led to weight loss, maintained
      regulation of insulin secretion and seemed to improve insulin secretion and
      sensitivity. These results were obtained in only 8 to 10 days.

PG  - 155-9
AB  - The potential for eprosartan, a nonbiphenyl tetrazole angiotensin II receptor
      antagonist, to affect the 24-hour plasma glucose profiles in type II diabetic
      patients treated with glyburide was investigated in this randomized,
      placebo-controlled, double-blind (eprosartan-placebo phase only), two-period,
      period-balanced, crossover study. All patients received a stable oral dose
      (3.75-10 mg/day) of glyburide for at least 30 days before the first dose of
      double-blind study medication was administered. Patients were randomized to
      receive either 200-mg oral doses of eprosartan twice daily or matching oral
      placebo doses concomitantly with glyburide for 7 days during each treatment
      period. After a minimum washout period of 14 days, patients were crossed over to 
      the alternate treatment. Serial samples to measure glucose concentrations in
      plasma were collected over a 24-hour period on the day before administration of
      eprosartan or placebo and again on day 7. Mean glucose concentrations were
      comparable between treatment groups before administration of eprosartan or
      placebo. The point estimate (90% confidence interval) for the ratio of the
      average mean 24-hour plasma glucose concentrations of eprosartan + glyburide to
      placebo + glyburide after 7 days of administration was 0.96 (0.90, 1.01).
      Eprosartan did not significantly alter the 24-hour plasma glucose profile in
      patients with type II diabetes mellitus who were previously stabilized on
      glyburide.

TI  - [Clinical study of glibenclamide in combination with kelening treatment in
      non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus].
PG  - 29-31
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To asses the efficacy of combination therapy of glibenclamide and
      Kelening in treating the non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).
      METHODS: Sixty-five patients with NIDDM were randomly divided into two groups.
      One group was treated with both glibenclamide and Kelening, the other with
      glibenclamide alone. RESULTS: After treatment for 12 weeks, the levels of fasting
      blood glucose (FBG), postprandial blood glucose (PBG) and HBAIC were reduced
      significantly in glibenclamide-Kelening group. In both groups, the degree dropped
      of the levels of FBG were almost the same, but the levels of PBG and HBAIC in
      glibenclamide-Kelening group were reduced more significantly than those in
      glibenclamide group, and the incidence of hyperinsulinemia had dropped
      considerably. CONCLUSION: Glibenclamide in combination with Kelening in the
      treatment of NIDDM is more effective and less toxic, and the combination may
      reduce the dosage of glibenclamide in NIDDM.

TI  - Concomitant administration of the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor voglibose (AO-128) 
      does not alter the pharmacokinetics of glibenclamide.
PG  - 149-52
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Voglibose is a new and potent inhibitor of alpha-glucosidases used for
      treatment of diabetes mellitus. It increases gastro-intestinal motility and could
      thus affect absorption of other concurrently administered antidiabetic drugs. The
      aim of this study was to investigate whether or not voglibose modifies the
      pharmacokinetics of glibenclamide, a widely used oral antidiabetic, and the
      glibenclamide-induced decrease in fasting serum glucose. METHODS: Twelve healthy 
      male subjects were included in this double-blind cross-over study and received a 
      single 1.75-mg dose of glibenclamide on the 8th day of continuous administration 
      of either placebo (reference) or voglibose 5 mg t.i.d. (test). Blood samples were
      taken to determine the pharmacokinetic characteristics of glibenclamide and the
      test/reference ratios were evaluated according to bioequivalence criteria.
      Additional blood samples were taken to measure serum glucose on the same day.
      RESULTS: The concentration-time course of glibenclamide under concomitant
      voglibose administration was similar to that under placebo. The equivalence ratio
      (test/reference) for the pharmacokinetic characteristics AUCnorm was 1.03
      (geometric mean; 0.95-1.11, 90% confidence interval) and Cmax.norm 1.01
      (0.94-1.08). The parameters were within the accepted range of 0.8-1.25 (AUC) or
      0.7-1.43 (Cmax), thus fulfilling equivalence criteria and indicating no effect of
      voglibose on glibenclamide kinetics. The glibenclamide-induced decrease in
      fasting serum glucose concentration was similarly independent of placebo or
      voglibose co-administration. CONCLUSIONS: Voglibose did not interact with
      glibenclamide on a pharmacokinetic level. Concomitant treatment was well
      tolerated and has been proven to be safe for further clinical use.

TI  - Drug interaction: rifampicin and glibenclamide.
PG  - 11-2
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rifampicin is a potent inducer of the hepatic microsomal enzyme
      system. However, the drug has been shown to cause clinically important
      interactions with many drugs. This study was designed to test the interaction of 
      rifampicin with the oral hypoglycaemic agent glibenclamide. METHODS: Twenty-nine 
      well-controlled diabetic patients on a combination therapy of diet and
      glibenclamide, and willing to participate in the trial, received a daily dose of 
      450 mg (body weight < 50 kg) or 600 mg (body-weight > 50kg) of rifampicin for 10 
      days. RESULTS: There was a significant (p < 0.001) worsening of fasting and
      post-prandial blood sugar after administration of rifampicin. Dose modification
      of glibenclamide was required in 15 of the 17 patients in whom the diabetes
      became uncontrolled. Blood sugar normalized by day 6 after stopping rifampicin in
      all patients. CONCLUSION: Rifampicin and glibenclamide interact. Therefore,
      necessary dose modifications should be made in order to achieve euglycaemia if
      these two drugs are given together.

TI  - A study of the potential effect of sertraline on the pharmacokinetics and protein
      binding of tolbutamide.
PG  - 31-6
AB  - The effect of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) sertraline 200
      mg/day on the metabolism of intravenously administered tolbutamide was examined
      in a randomised nonblinded parallel-group study in 25 healthy male volunteers.
      There was a small but statistically significant decrease (16%) in the clearance
      of tolbutamide in patients receiving the maximum recommended dosage of
      sertraline. The terminal elimination rate constant was also significantly
      reduced, corresponding to the increase in the terminal elimination half-life
      (from 6.9 to 8.6 hours). The decrease in clearance was not associated with any
      significant changes in plasma protein binding or in the apparent volume of
      distribution of tolbutamide. This suggests that the change in tolbutamide
      clearance may be due to a slight inhibition of the cytochrome P450 (CYP)
      isoenzyme CYP2C9/10 when sertraline was administered in its maximum recommended
      dosage. However, the small changes in the volume of distribution and plasma
      binding of tolbutamide after sertraline treatment indicate that there is a
      minimal interaction between sertraline and tolbutamide.

TI  - Comparison of different insulin regimens in elderly patients with NIDDM.
PG  - 1326-32
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the metabolic effects of three different frequently used
      regimens of insulin administration on blood glucose control and serum lipids, and
      the costs associated with this treatment, in subjects with NIDDM, who were poorly
      controlled with oral antihyperglycemic agents. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We
      studied 95 elderly patients with NIDDM (age 68 +/- 9 years, BMI 26.0 +/- 4.6
      kg/m2, and median time since diagnosis of diabetes 9 years [range 1-37]; 37 men, 
      58 women), who were poorly controlled, despite diet and maximal doses of oral
      antihyperglycemic agents. Three insulin administration regimens were compared
      during a 6-month period: patients were randomized for treatment with a
      two-injection scheme (regimen A) or a combination of glibenclamide with one
      injection of NPH insulin, administered either at bedtime (regimen B) or before
      breakfast (regimen C), and insulin treatment was mainly instituted in an
      outpatient setting. RESULTS: After 6 months of insulin treatment, fasting blood
      glucose of the total patient population had decreased from an average of 14.1 +/-
      2.2 to 8.3 +/- 2.0 mmol/L (P < 0.001), and HbA1c fell from 11.0 +/- 1.3 to 8.3
      +/- 1.2% (P < 0.001); 34 patients reached HbA1c levels below 8.0%, 25 of them
      even below 7.5%. With two insulin injections daily, HbA1c decreased from 11.2 +/-
      1.3 to 8.2 +/- 1.2%, while during combined treatment, HbA1c fell from 10.5 +/-
      1.2 to 8.1 +/- 1.1% (regimen B) and from 11.1 +/- 1.3 to 8.5 +/- 1.1% (regimen
      C). Comparable improvement of the other measures of glycemic control, lipids and 
      lipoproteins, was observed in the different treatment regimens. Body weight
      increase was moderate (mean +/- 4.0 kg) and similar in all patient groups.
      One-third of patients starting with one insulin injection daily needed a second
      injection to control glycemia. One episode of severe hypoglycemia was observed.
      Combined insulin-sulfonylurea treatment was almost 20% more expensive than
      twice-daily administration of insulin alone. CONCLUSIONS: Insulin treatment can
      safely be instituted in elderly patients with NIDDM. However, it is difficult to 
      obtain optimal glycemic control. Insulin has moderate beneficial effects on serum
      lipoproteins. Although on the basis of glycemic control and weight gain, no
      preference for any treatment regimen can be discerned, twice-daily insulin
      administration is the most simple and cost-effective regimen.

TI  - New treatments for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 657-62
AB  - In subjects with type 2 diabetes, both defects of insulin secretion and insulin
      resistance contribute to the development of hyperglycaemia. The major goals of
      treatment are to optimise blood glucose control, and normalise the associated
      lipid disturbances and elevated blood pressure. Pharmacologic treatment is often 
      necessary. This paper discusses new forms of oral treatment for subjects with
      type 2 diabetes. These include a new sulphonylurea compound glimepiride (Amaryl),
      which binds to a different protein of the putative sulphonylurea receptor than
      glibenclamide, and seems to have a lower risk of hypoglycaemia. A new class of
      drugs with insulin secretory capacity, of which repaglinide (NovoNorm) is the
      leading compound, is now in phase III clinical trials. Alpha-glucosidase
      inhibitors reversibly inhibit alpha-glucosidase enzymes in the small intestine,
      which delays cleavage of oligo- and disaccharides to monosaccharides. This leads 
      to a delayed and reduced blood glucose rise after a meal. Two compounds are in
      development or have been marketed, ie, miglitol and acarbose (Glucobay). Another 
      new class of drugs is the thiazolidine-diones, which seem to work by enhancing
      insulin action. The 'insulin sensitising' effects of the leading compounds,
      troglitazone and BRL 49653C, do not involve any effect on insulin secretion.
      These drugs also seem to beneficially influence serum cholesterol and
      triglyceride levels. Oral antihyperglycaemic agents can be used only during a
      limited period of time in most patients, after which the diabetic state 'worsens'
      and insulin therapy has to be started. In this light, two new forms of treatment 
      which require subcutaneous injections are also discussed: the synthetic human
      amylin analogue AC137 (pramlintide) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (7-36)-amide, a
      strong glucose-dependent stimulator of insulin secretion. It remains to be seen
      whether these compounds can be developed further for clinical use in patients
      with diabetes.

TI  - Acarbose: its role in the treatment of diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 1255-62
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To review the clinical pharmacology of acarbose, an alpha-glucosidase
      inhibitor, and to summarize its role in the pharmacotherapy of diabetes mellitus.
      DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search identified all relevant articles, including
      reviews; Bayer Pharmaceuticals. STUDY SELECTION: Due to the large number of
      clinical trials available, specific criteria were used to narrow the focus of
      this review: (1) randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group
      study design; (2) a minimum of 25 patients enrolled per treatment arm; (3) a
      treatment duration of 90 days or more; and (4) adherence to Food and Drug
      Administration Good Clinical Practice guidelines. DATA EXTRACTION: All clinical
      trials that were available up to December 1995 were reviewed. Preliminary trials 
      and unpublished reports were not reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS: Acarbose is effective 
      in reducing postprandial hyperglycemia. It does not stimulate endogenous insulin 
      secretion and, therefore, will not cause hypoglycemia when used as monotherapy.
      The enhanced glycemic control achieved with acarbose is additive to that of
      sulfonylureas. It lowers postprandial serum glucose and insulin concentrations
      and does not promote weight gain. Acarbose can be used as first-line therapy with
      diet and exercise, or it can be used in combination with sulfonylureas to lower
      hemoglobin A1c concentrations an additional 0.5-0.9%. Acarbose is not a cure for 
      diabetes, nor is it a substitute for diet, exercise, oral hypoglycemic agents, or
      insulin. Adverse effects are gastrointestinal and can be diminished by starting
      with an initial dosage of 25 mg tid. Depending on patient response, the dosage
      can be increased up to a maximum of 100 mg tid over time. CONCLUSIONS: Acarbose, 
      through its unique mechanism of action, appears to be a safe and effective
      adjunctive agent to diet/exercise therapy or sulfonylurea therapy for treatment
      of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

TI  - Metformin's effects on glucose and lipid metabolism in patients with secondary
      failure to sulfonylureas.
PG  - 1185-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare results obtained with metformin versus those obtained with 
      DNA-recombinant insulin in obese patients with NIDDM suffering from secondary
      failure to sulfonylureas. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted an open,
      prospective, randomized, and comparative study comprising a total of 60 patients 
      selected and placed in two parallel groups. We had previously confirmed that the 
      subjects had secondary failure to high doses of sulfonylureas. The initial
      metformin dosage was a single 850 mg tablet, and the dosage was increased to two 
      or three tablets depending on the patient's metabolic changes. The initial dosage
      of DNA-recombinant insulin was 24 U, subcutaneously administered and divided into
      two portions: two-thirds at around 8:00 A.M., before breakfast, and the remaining
      third at 8:00 P.M., before dinner. The dosage was adjusted based on the patient's
      clinical and metabolic response. RESULTS: The initial average glucose value for
      the metformin group was 269.1 +/- 32.2 mg/dl, decreasing by the end of the study 
      to 159.7 +/- 30.5 mg/dl. For the insulin group, these figures went from 270.7 +/-
      24.0 mg/dl at the beginning of the study to 134.8 +/- 26.7 mg/dl. This decrease
      correlates with the reduction in glycosylated hemoglobin from 12.8 to 8.9% for
      the first group and from 12.3 to 8.2% for the second, as well as with the
      reduction in triglyceride values from 230.3 to 183.1 mg/dl and from 218.4 to
      186.3 mg/dl, respectively. The BMI (27.5-26.4), blood pressure (systolic from
      145.7-132.1 mmHg, diastolic from 90.3-84.8 mmHg), and total cholesterol levels
      (235-202 mg/dl) decreased in only the metformin group. CONCLUSIONS: Metformin is 
      an effective, safe, and well-tolerated treatment that improves metabolic control 
      and favorably modifies secondary clinical alterations due to insulin resistance, 
      such as arterial hypertension, overweight, and hyperlipidemia, in obese patients 
      with NIDDM suffering from secondary failure to sulfonylureas.

TI  - Effect of troglitazone on insulin sensitivity and pancreatic beta-cell function
      in women at high risk for NIDDM.
PG  - 1572-9
AB  - We conducted a randomized placebo-controlled study to determine the effects of
      the thiazolidinedione compound troglitazone on whole-body insulin sensitivity
      (SI), pancreatic beta-cell function, and glucose tolerance in 42 Latino women
      with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and a history of gestational diabetes
      mellitus (GDM), characteristics that carry an 80% risk of developing NIDDM within
      5 years. After baseline oral (OGTT) and intravenous (IVGTT) glucose tolerance
      testing, subjects were assigned to take placebo or 200 or 400 mg troglitazone
      daily for 12 weeks (14 subjects per treatment group). An OGTT and IVGTT were
      repeated during the 12th week of treatment. Five subjects failed to complete the 
      trial for personal reasons, and medication compliance averaged 90% in the
      remaining subjects, none of whom experienced a serious adverse event. SI,
      calculated by minimal model analysis of IVGTT results, changed by only 4 +/- 14% 
      during 12 weeks of placebo administration, but increased 40 +/- 22 and 88 +/- 22%
      above basal during treatment with 200 and 400 mg troglitazone, respectively (P = 
      0.01 among groups). Troglitazone administration was also associated with a
      dose-dependent reduction in the total insulin area during IVGTTs, which was
      highly significant (P < 0.001), and with a reduction during OGTTs, which
      approached statistical significance (P = 0.09). Glucose tolerance improved
      slightly in all groups, but the magnitude of change did not differ significantly 
      among groups, whether it was assessed as the number of subjects who continued to 
      manifest IGT at 12 weeks (P = 0.64 among groups), the change in total glucose
      area during OGTTs (P = 0.58), or the change in fractional glucose disappearance
      rates during IVGTTs (P = 0.28). Among the women who received troglitazone, the
      greatest improvement in SI occurred in the women who had the highest diastolic
      blood pressures and the best IVGTT insulin responses during baseline testing. Our
      findings indicate that troglitazone improved whole-body insulin sensitivity and
      lowered circulating insulin concentrations in women with prior GDM who are at
      very high risk for NIDDM. The lack of improvement in glucose tolerance despite
      improved insulin sensitivity may be a manifestation of the beta-cell defect that 
      predisposes the women to NIDDM. The overall pattern of response to troglitazone
      in our high-risk patients indicates that the drug is an ideal agent with which to
      test whether the amelioration of insulin resistance can delay or prevent diabetes
      in women with limited beta-cell reserve.

TI  - The effect on metabolic control of second-generation sulfonylurea drugs in
      patients with NIDDM after secondary failure to first-generation agents.
PG  - 370-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: The literature contains few data examining the results of therapy
      with second-generation sulfonylurea drugs in subjects with non-insulin-dependent 
      diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) after the onset of secondary failure to
      first-generation agents. The present study was undertaken to assess the efficacy 
      of therapy with second-generation sulfonylurea in subjects with NIDDM following
      secondary failure to first-generation agents. METHODS: The study included 55
      subjects with NIDDM who manifested secondary failure to first-generation
      sulfonylurea therapy. Of these, 29 subjects underwent therapy with the
      second-generation sulfonylurea glipizide, and 26 subjects were treated with
      glyburide, both drugs administered in the maximum daily dosage. Before initiation
      of the second-generation sulfonylurea agents and again at the end of 6 months,
      metabolic control was assessed by determination of fasting plasma glucose,
      glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and the lipid profile. RESULTS: Fasting plasma
      glucose and HbA1c levels were 209 +/- 31 mg/dL and 12.3 +/- 2.1%, respectively,
      before initiation of glipizide, and did not significantly change following
      therapy (fasting plasma glucose, 211 +/- 34 mg/dL; HbA1c, 11.7 +/- 1.8%).
      Similarly, no significant alteration was noted in these metabolic values in the
      glyburide group (before glyburide therapy, fasting plasma glucose, 180 +/- 16
      mg/dL; HbA1c, 11.2 +/- 1.6%; after glyburide therapy, fasting plasma glucose, 184
      +/- 20 mg/dL; HbA1c, 11.0 +/- 1.5%). Lipids also were not significantly altered
      following therapy with either glipizide or glyburide. Finally, for all subjects, 
      fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c were 200 +/- 27 mg/dL and 11.9 +/- 2.0%,
      respectively, during treatment with first-generation drugs and did not change
      significantly following therapy with the second-generation agents (fasting plasma
      glucose, 205 +/- 20 mg/dL; HbA1c, 11.2 +/- 1.2%). P values were > .60 for all
      comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with second-generation sulfonylurea agents
      for patients with NIDDM following onset of secondary failure to first-generation 
      sulfonylurea drugs achieves no better metabolic control than treatment with
      first-generation agents.

TI  - The effect of a very low dose of tolbutamide combined with an alpha-glucosidase
      inhibitor in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 433-7
AB  - The effect of adding a very low dose of a sulphonylurea (tolbutamide) to the
      treatment of 10 patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) was 
      investigated. Patients took 0.1 mg tds of an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor orally
      for 8 weeks, and 50 mg tds of the sulphonylurea, tolbutamide, for the last 4
      weeks of this period. The glycosylated haemoglobin level was significantly
      reduced during the combined treatment period compared with the level after
      treatment with alpha-glucosidase inhibitor alone (P = 0.035), although not
      compared with the pretreatment level. There were no significant changes in
      post-prandial blood glucose, serum lipid levels or connective peptide
      immunoreactivities. These preliminary results indicate that the addition of a
      very low dose of tolbutamide to a recommended diet and treatment with an
      alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, may improve glucose metabolism without raising
      insulin secretion or influencing lipid metabolism.

TI  - A review of the safety and efficacy of acarbose in diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 792-805
AB  - Acarbose is a novel oral anti-hyperglycemic agent approved for the treatment of
      noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. It inhibits alpha-glucosidases in the
      small intestine, an action that delays the digestion and absorption of complex
      carbohydrates. Subsequently, there is a smaller rise in the postprandial plasma
      glucose levels and an overall decrease in the glycosylated hemoglobin by
      0.5-1.0%. Potential advantages of acarbose include a greater effectiveness in
      controlling postprandial hyperglycemia, a low risk of hypoglycemia, and a
      possible delay in initiating insulin therapy. Acarbose can potentiate the
      hypoglycemic effects of sulfonylureas or insulin. It has not been associated with
      weight gain and hyperinsulinemia, both of which can occur with sulfonylureas or
      insulin. Gastrointestinal adverse effects are common with acarbose, and may
      decrease with continued treatment. Although rare, elevated serum transaminase
      levels have been reported.

TI  - The effect of glipizide gastrointestinal therapeutic system on islet cell
      hormonal responses to a test meal in NIDDM.
PG  - 883-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the abnormal glucagon and amylin secretions in
      NIDDM are secondary to hyperglycemia and relative hypoinsulinemia. RESEARCH
      DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 13 patients with NIDDM were studied before and
      after treatment with glipizide gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) in a
      randomized double-blind placebo-controlled fashion. Of the 13 subjects, 9 were
      randomized to the glipizide GITS arm and 4 were randomized to the placebo arm of 
      the study. Serum glucose, insulin, C-peptide, plasma glucagon, and plasma amylin 
      concentrations were measured under fasting and postprandial (post-Sustacal
      ingestion) conditions. The Sustacal challenge was performed at baseline and after
      12 weeks of treatment with either glipizide GITS or placebo. RESULTS: Glipizide
      GITS treatment resulted in a significant reduction in hyperglycemia and increases
      in insulin and C-peptide secretion. Hyperglucagonemia was not ameliorated, and
      amylin secretion was not altered after glipizide GITS treatment. Placebo-treated 
      patients did not show significant changes in any of the parameters measured.
      CONCLUSIONS: Glipizide GITS treatment failed to ameliorate the hyperglucagonemia 
      of NIDDM and did not alter amylin secretion even though it increased insulin
      secretion and significantly ameliorated the hyperglycemia. These observations
      suggest that NIDDM related abnormalities in some of the islet cell hormonal
      responses are the result of changes inherent in the islet cells and may be
      independent of hyperglycemia and relative hypoinsulinemia.

TI  - Glucagon-like peptide I enhances the insulinotropic effect of glibenclamide in
      NIDDM patients and in the perfused rat pancreas.
PG  - 857-63
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the acute effects of glibenclamide and glucagon-like
      peptide I (GLP-I) and their combination in perfused isolated rat pancreas and in 
      patients with secondary failure to sulfonylureas. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS:
      Rat islets were perfused with 10 nmol/l GLP-I in combination with 2 mumol/l
      glibenclamide. In human experiments, GLP-I (0.75 pmol. kg-1.min-1) was given as a
      continuous infusion during 240 min, while glibenclamide (3.5 mg) was administered
      orally. Eight patients participated in the study (age 57.6 +/- 2.7 years, BMI
      28.7 +/- 1.5 kg/m2, mean +/- SE). In all subjects, blood glucose was first
      normalized by insulin infusion administered by an artificial pancreas
      (Biostator). RESULTS: GLP-I increased the insulinotropic effect of glibenclamide 
      fourfold in the perfused rat pancreas. In human experiments, treatment with GLP-I
      alone and in combination with glibenclamide significantly decreased basal glucose
      levels (5.1 +/- 0.4 and 4.5 +/- 0.1 vs. 6.0 +/- 0.3 mmol/l, P < 0.01), while with
      only glibenclamide, glucose concentrations remained unchanged. GLP-I markedly
      decreased total integrated glucose response to the meal (353 +/- 60 vs. 724 +/-
      91 mmol.l-1. min-1, area under the curve [AUC] [-30-180 min], P < 0.02), whereas 
      glibenclamide had no effect (598 +/- 101 mmol.l-1. min-1, AUC [-30-180 min], NS).
      The combined treatment further enhanced the glucose lowering effect of GLP-I (138
      +/- 24 mmol. l-1.min, AUC [-30-180 min], P < 0.001). GLP-I, glibenclamide, and
      combined treat-stimulated meal-induced insulin release as reflected by
      insulinogenic indexes (control 1.44 +/- 0.4; GLP-I 6.3 +/- 1.6, P < 0.01;
      glibenclamide 6.8 +/- 2.1, P < 0.01; combination 20.7 +/- 5.0, P < 0.001). GLP-I 
      inhibited basal but not postprandial glucagon responses. Using paracetamol as a
      marker for gastric emptying rate of the test meal, treatment with GLP-I decreased
      gastric emptying at 180 min by approximately 50% compared with the control
      subjects (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In acute experiments on overweight patients
      with NIDDM, GLP-I exerted a marked antidiabetogenic action on the basal and
      postprandial state. The peptide stimulated insulin, suppressed basal glucagon
      release, and prolonged gastric emptying. The glucose-lowering effect of GLP-I was
      further enhanced by glibenclamide. This action may be at least partially
      accounted for by a synergistic effect of these two compounds on insulin release. 
      Glibenclamide per se enhanced postprandial but not basal insulin release and
      exerted a less pronounced antidiabetogenic effect compared with GLP-I.

      combined with sulfonylurea in type 2 diabetes patients with secondary tolerance
      to sulfonylurea. Possible selection criteria].
PG  - 47-52
AB  - The treatment of NIDDM patients with secondary failure to sulfonylureas is still 
      a debated problem. In this study we compared in NIDDM patients with secondary
      failure to glyburide, the effect of adding a single, low-dose bed time either NPH
      or ultralent insulin injection (0.15-0.2 U/kg) to the previously ineffective
      sulfonylurea treatment. Both NPH and ultralent insulin therapy have been
      demonstrated to be effective in ameliorating metabolic control in NIDDM patients 
      with secondary failure to sulfonylureas. However, the addition of bed-time
      ultralent insulin caused a greater and significant decrease in post prandial
      plasma glucose. In contrast, the average fasting plasma glucose decrease was
      significantly greater after NPH insulin administration. These results indicate
      that in NIDDM patients with secondary failure to glyburide bed-time ultralent
      insulin administration is a better tool to improve the post prandial plasma
      glucose.

TI  - O[The effect of physical exercise on glycemia on healthy subjects following
      administration of glimepiride].
PG  - 606-9
AB  - Sulfonylureas predispose to hypoglycaemia during and after exercise. The
      hypoglycaemic effect of the novel sulfonylurea glimepiride (G; CAS 93479-97-1) in
      male healthy volunteers under these conditions. Each subject was exposed to three
      experimental situations, administration of 3 mg G and rest, administration of 3
      mg G and 60 min of bicycle ergometry (E) (work load adjusted to a heart rate of
      120 bpm), or placebo (P) and bicycle ergometry as mentioned. Each of these was
      preceded and followed by 60 min of physical rest. Base line glycaemia was
      comparable (PE 83 +/- 8 mg/dl, GR 84 +/- 5 mg/dl, GE 86 +/- 7 mg/dl) and fell
      during GR to 63 +/- 6 mg/dl after 150 min. During GE glycaemia ceased to decline 
      after 30 min exercise, and rose thereafter reaching values comparable to PE after
      150 min (80 +/- 8 vs. 82 +/- 7 mg/dl). Serum insulin concentrations rose during
      exercise following administration of G to 6-7 microU/ml (AUC during the period
      60-120 min after administration: GE 371 +/- 81 microU/ml.60 min, GR 414 +/- 77
      microU/ml.60 min), and fell during PE to 4 microU/ml (265 +/- 49 microU/ml.60; p 
      < 0.001 vs. GE and GR). During GE serum insulin concentrations fell to 6
      microU/ml at the end of exercise and thereafter (AUC during the period 120-180
      min after administration: 340 +/- 82 microU/ml.60 min), whereas they remained at 
      7 microU/ml during GR (399 +/- 109 microU/ml.60 min; p = 0.087 vs. GE). In
      conclusion, exercise blunts the hypoglycaemic effect of glimepiride in healthy
      individuals.

AB  - In this retrospective study, the authors assess the efficacy of combined insulin 
      and oral hypoglycemic agents (OHAs) in controlling glycemic levels, as well as
      lipid levels and insulin requirements, in 48 patients with type II diabetes
      mellitus during a 1-year period. Thirty-two of these patients had secondary
      failure to an OHA (group 1). Sixteen patients (group 2) were taking high doses of
      insulin alone. Overall, 64.6% of all the patients responded to the combination
      therapy and insulin at 6 months. Response was defined as a decrease in hemoglobin
      A1c of more than 0.5%. At 12 months, 50% of these patients continued to respond
      to this regimen. No significant differences were seen in the patients' total
      cholesterol and triglyceride levels between responders and nonresponders in each 
      group. After 1 year of combination OHA and insulin therapy, 50% of the patients
      showed a 21.4% reduction in their daily insulin dose.

TI  - Clinical usefulness of serum 1,5-anhydroglucitol in monitoring glycaemic control.
PG  - 1514-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: To evaluate prospectively the clinical value of measuring serum
      concentrations of 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5AG) in monitoring glycaemia in patients
      with newly diagnosed non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), we measured
      serum 1,5AG in 56 such patients. METHODS: 28 patients (group A) were started on, 
      and continuously received, an oral hypoglycaemic agent for at least 6 weeks. The 
      other 28 patients (group B) were given such agents for 4 weeks, and then stopped 
      taking them for at least 2 weeks. All patients were then followed for an
      additional 10 weeks. Serum 1,5AG, fructosamine, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), and
      self-monitoring of blood glucose were monitored every 14 days for 16 weeks.
      FINDINGS: When sudden worsening of glycaemia occurred within 2 weeks, entailing
      withdrawal of oral treatment, 1,5AG accurately detected the slight change in
      glycaemia whereas HbA1c and fructosamine both failed to detect it. Although the
      change was detected by measurement of fasting plasma glucose (FPG)
      concentrations, FPG was less sensitive than 1,5AG. In patients with
      "near-normoglycaemia" (HbA1c about 6.5%) in the preceding 8 weeks, those who
      showed a lower concentration of 1,5AG (<10.0 micrograms/mL) manifested a higher
      mean daily plasma glucose concentration even though HbA1c measurement suggested
      good control of glycaemia. Results of 1,5AG were correlated more strongly with
      the FPG (r=0.790) and mean daily plasma glucose (r=-0.835) estimated on the same 
      day than those estimaoffted in the preceding 2, 4 and 8 weeks, and with a fall in
      the Spearman correlation coefficient at any preceding time interval.
      INTERPRETATION: Because 1,5AG accurately detected a slight change in glycaemia
      without delay, it is suitable for use in monitoring for strict control of
      glycaemia, an important clinical goal.

TI  - Metformin: a new treatment option for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 612-8
AB  - Metformin is a biguanide that can used alone or in combination with sulfonylureas
      or insulin in the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).
      Since biguanides do not increase pancreatic insulin secretion, they are referred 
      to as antihyperglycemic agents, as opposed to hypoglycemic agents. Biguanides
      reduce hyperglycemia by increasing, insulin sensitivity, decreasing glucose
      absorption, and inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis. Advantages of metformin
      include achieving glycemic control without exacerbating weight gain or
      hyperinsulinemia and beneficially affecting serum cholesterol concentrations.
      Although metformin has the potential to cause lactic acidosis, the incidence is
      significantly lower compared with phenformin. Risk factors for lactic acidosis
      include renal serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL and cardiovascular, pulmonary, and
      hepatic disease. Metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to surgery
      and before administration of radiologic intravenous contrast, and in patients
      with sepsis, severe gastrointestinal disease, trauma, and acute cardiovascular
      events.

TI  - Daytime glibenclamide and bedtime NPH insulin compared to intensive insulin
      treatment in secondary sulphonylurea failure: a 1-year follow-up.
PG  - 471-7
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the metabolic effects of a combination of
      daytime glibenclamide and evening NPH insulin with intensive insulin treatment
      (rapid acting insulin before meals and NPH insulin at bedtime) in patients
      exhibiting secondary failure to sulphonylurea treatment. Thirty-nine mildly obese
      NIDDM patients (BMI 25.6 +/- 0.5) were randomized after 6 weeks of intensive
      insulin treatment to either a combination treatment (CT, n = 20) or continued
      intensive insulin treatment (IT, n = 19). There were no differences between the
      two groups in age, diabetes duration, BMI, HbA1c, or basal and glucagon
      stimulated C-peptide. The patients were followed for 1 year and the findings were
      analysed on an intent to treat basis. Two patients in the CT group were excluded 
      after 2 and 6 months, respectively, due to unacceptably high postprandial glucose
      values. There was a significant difference in HbA1c between the CT and IT groups 
      at 6 months (8.2 +/- 0.2, n = 19, vs 6.8 +/- 0.4%, n = 19, p < 0.001)), but not
      at 12 months (7.8 +/- 0.3, n = 18, vs 7.5 +/- 0.4%, n = 19). After the initial
      intensive insulin treatment, BMI was constant in the CT group but increased
      significantly at 6 and 12 months in the IT group. We conclude that both
      treatments are associated with a marked and long-term improvement of glycaemic
      control. The intensive insulin treatment leads to a more pronounced weight
      increase which in the long run might have negative effect on overall metabolic
      control. Therefore, the combination treatment together with intensified education
      and dietary advice should be regarded as the initial treatment of choice for oral
      agent failure in moderately obese NIDDM patients.

TI  - Does a high-carbohydrate diet have different effects in NIDDM patients treated
      with diet alone or hypoglycemic drugs?
PG  - 498-500
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of a nigh-carbohydrate diet on blood glucose
      and plasma lipids in NIDDM patients with either mild or severe glucose
      intolerance. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A crossover design with a 15-day
      intervention diet was used. Eighteen patients were separated into two groups on
      the basis of hypoglycemic treatment (diet, n = 9, or diet plus glibenclamide, n =
      9) and were assigned to a 15-day treatment with a high-carbohydrate/low-fiber
      diet containing 60% energy from carbohydrate and 20% from fat or a
      low-carbohydrate/low-fiber diet with 40% energy from carbohydrate and 40% from
      fat and then crossed over to the other diet for 15 more days. RESULTS: The
      high-carbohydrate diet produced a significant increase in postprandial blood
      glucose in patients on glibenclamide (13.6 +/- 1.4 vs. 11.0 +/- 1.8 mmol/l, P <
      0.002, while no difference was recorded in the group on diet alone (9.7 +/- vs.
      8.9 +/- 0.6 mmol/l). Postprandial insulin levels were significantly higher after 
      the high-carbohydrate diet in the group on diet along (248 +/- 32 vs. 192 +/- 28 
      pmol/l, P < 0.01), while no significant differences were observed in the other
      group (226 +/- 19 vs. 202 +/- 24 pmol/l) The high-carbohydrate diet also induced 
      a significant increase in fasting plasma triglyceride concentrations in both
      groups (1.36 +/- 0.2 vs. 1.12 +/- 0.2 mmol/l, P < 0.05 and 1.4 +/- 0.3 vs. 1.1
      +/- 0.1 mmol/l, P < 0.05). No differences were observed in fasting plasma
      cholesterol and HDL. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of the high-carbohydrate diet on
      blood glucose control in NIDDM patients differ according to severity of glucose
      intolerance.

TI  - Metformin in noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 327-51
AB  - Metformin is an oral antihyperglycemic agent that is approved by the Food and
      Drug Administration for the treatment of noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. 
      It differs from the sulfonylureas in that it is does not enhance insulin
      secretion and normally does not produce hypoglycemia. Metformin acts to decrease 
      preprandial and postprandial blood glucose concentrations by increasing skeletal 
      muscle uptake of glucose, decreasing gluconeogenesis, and decreasing absorption
      of glucose. The addition of metformin to maximum dosages of a sulfonylurea may
      synergistically improve glucose control. The drug may offer other potential
      benefits, such as weight loss or minimal weight gain, improved blood flow in
      patients with peripheral vascular disease, reduction of tissue plasminogen
      activator inhibitor, and improved lipid profiles. It is relatively safe if taken 
      appropriately. Its most common side effects are gastrointestinal (nausea,
      diarrhea, anorexia), metallic taste, and vitamin B12 malabsorption. Lactic
      acidosis may also occur, but it is rare if metformin is avoided in patients with 
      contraindications to its use. With careful monitoring, the agent may be
      considered for the initial treatment of obese patients who fail dietary measures,
      and those whose disease is refractory to maximum dosages of sulfonylureas or who 
      do not tolerate them.

TI  - Effect of combination therapy of troglitazone and sulphonylureas in patients with
      Type 2 diabetes who were poorly controlled by sulphonylurea therapy alone.
PG  - 365-70
AB  - The clinical efficacy of troglitazone, a new oral hypoglycaemic agent was
      investigated in Type 2 diabetes in combination with sulphonylureas. Two hundred
      and ninety-one patients with Type 2 diabetes (age 21-81 years) whose previous
      glycaemic control by sulphonylureas was judged stable but unsatisfactory (fasting
      plasma glucose (FPG) > 8.3 mmol I-1) were randomly allocated into the
      troglitazone treatment group (troglitazone group, n = 145) or the placebo
      treatment group (placebo group, n = 146). They were treated by test drugs for 12 
      weeks in combination with the same dose of sulphonylureas before the trial. One
      hundred and twenty-two patients who received troglitazone and 126 patients who
      received placebo were evaluated for efficacy. The baseline characteristics did
      not differ significantly between the two groups. In the troglitazone group, FPG
      and HbA(1c) decreased significantly after the treatment (before vs after, FPG:
      10.8 +/- 2.0 mmol I(-1) vs 9.2 +/- 2.5 mmol I(-1), p< 0.001; HbA(1c): 9.2 +/-
      1.4% vs 8.5 +/- 1.5%, p< 0.001). FPG and HbA(1c) did not change after the
      treatment in the placebo group (before vs after, FPG: 10.5 +/- 1.7 mmol I(-1) vs 
      10.7 +/- 2.2 mmol I(-1); HbA(1c): 9.0 +/- 1.5% vs 9.2 +/- 1.6 %). Serum total
      cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol did not change in either group, however, serum
      triglyceride significantly decreased in the troglitazone group. No serious
      adverse events occurred in either group. In conclusion, troglitazone 400 mg
      day(-1) had a significant hypoglycaemic effect in combination with sulphonylureas
      without any serious adverse events. Troglitazone, developed as an insulin action 
      enhancer, can be a useful hypoglycaemic agent in the treatment of patients with
      Type 2 diabetes who are not well controlled by sulphonylureas alone.

PG  - 323-6
AB  - A 58-year-old man with chronic paranoid-hallucinatoric psychosis had transient
      episodes with marked paranoid delusions, auditory hallucinations without
      confusion, shakiness of both upper extremities, tachycardia and sweating. EMG
      performed with surface electrodes revealed many silent periods in postural active
      muscles with maximum duration of 120 ms; blood glucose was 65-75 mg/dl. At other 
      times, blood glucose was 135-140 mg/dl, EMG revealed few silent periods in
      postural active muscles with maximal duration of 50 ms and the patient noted some
      vibration in his outstretched hands only. Drug-induced asterixis (clozapine,
      benperidol) amplified by relative hypoglycemia was therefore assumed, and
      symptoms disappeared after oral antidiabetics were reduced.

TI  - A comparison of acarbose versus metformin as an adjuvant therapy in
      sulfonylurea-treated NIDDM patients.
PG  - 252-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of acarbose or metformin treatment used as an
      adjunct with a sulfonylurea agent in the treatment of NIDDM not adequately
      controlled with the use of a sulfonylurea agent alone. RESEARCH DESIGN AND
      METHODS: Of the poorly controlled female NIDDM patients on sulfonylurea
      treatment, 18 were randomly selected from the outpatient diabetic clinic for
      study. For 8 weeks, they received either acarbose (300 mg/daily) or metformin
      (1,500 mg/daily) in addition to sulfonylurea in a crossover design using a 3-week
      washout period between treatments. The efficacy of each drug regimen was assessed
      by measuring the levels of glycosylated hemoglobin, fasting and 2-h postprandial 
      blood glucose (PPBG) levels, cholesterol, triglyceride, and fibrinogen levels
      before and after 8 weeks of therapy. RESULTS: The metabolic parameters measured
      before initiation of either treatment regimen were similar. Mean fasting and 2-h 
      postprandial glucose levels were reduced moderately at the end of 8 weeks of both
      combination treatments (P < 0.05). Although the fasting and 2-h postprandial
      plasma insulin and C-peptide and fibrinogen levels at the end of the 8-week
      treatment periods were lower than those obtained at the beginning of the study,
      the differences between these values were not statistically significant.
      Cholesterol levels remained unchanged. Only the 2-h PPBG level in the group using
      acarbose plus a sulfonylurea was lower than the level achieved by the group using
      metformin plus a sulfonylurea (8.1 +/- 0.8 vs. 9.8 +/- 1.0 mmol/l, respectively, 
      P < 0.05). The difference between pre- and posttreatment levels of the 2-h PPBG
      level in both arms of the study were statistically significant (delta-acarbose,
      5.3 +/- 0.4 vs. delta-metformin, 2.9 +/- 0.3) (P < 0.05). Specific
      drug-associated side effects were observed in 12 patients on acarbose and 3
      patients on metformin. CONCLUSIONS: Acarbose or metformin can be used as
      effective adjuvant therapies with a sulfonylurea agent in NIDDM patients who are 
      poorly controlled with the sulfonylurea agent alone.

TI  - Circulating catecholamines and metabolic effects of captopril in NIDDM patients.
PG  - 226-30
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of captopril on circulating catecholamine
      levels in NIDDM patients and the possible relationship between captopril-related 
      changes in circulating catecholamine levels and insulin sensitivity. RESEARCH
      DESIGN AND METHODS: Fourteen nonobese normotensive NIDDM men (aged 44.5 +/- 5.1
      years) underwent a 2-h euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp (40 mU.m-2.min-1).
      Baseline evaluation of insulin sensitivity was followed by the random assignment 
      of each patient to either captopril or placebo treatment, according to a
      crossover double-blind design. Euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp studies were
      then repeated for all patients after both placebo and captopril treatments.
      Plasma norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E) levels were assessed before,
      during, and after each clamp. RESULTS: Resulting data showed that plasma
      catecholamine levels increased during baseline euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp 
      (NE: +23.6% time 0 vs. time 120 min, P < 0.05; E: +24.8% time 0 vs. time 120 min,
      P < 0.05). Captopril treatment significantly increased total glucose uptake (from
      19.0 +/- 9.0 to 26.8 +/- 10.1 mmol.kg-1.min-1, P < 0.05) and reduced baseline
      plasma NE (P < 0.001) and E (P < 0.05) levels. However, the magnitude of the NE
      (+25.7% time 0 vs. time 120 min, P < 0.001) and E (+27.2% time 0 vs. time 120
      min, P < 0.05) increments during euglycemic hyperinsulinemia were not affected by
      the drug. Percentage changes in the ratio of total body glucose uptake to
      circulating insulin levels and corresponding decrements of baseline plasma E
      levels after captopril therapy were negatively correlated (r = -0.57, P < 0.05). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The reduction of circulating catecholamines could contribute, at
      least in part, to the captopril-related amelioration of insulin sensitivity.

TI  - Effects of troglitazone: a new hypoglycemic agent in patients with NIDDM poorly
      controlled by diet therapy.
PG  - 151-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical efficacy of troglitazone, a newly
      developed oral hypoglycemic agent, in patients with NIDDM. RESEARCH DESIGN AND
      METHODS: There were 284 NIDDM patients (20-82 years of age) whose glycemic
      control while on a diet was judged stable but was judged unsatisfactory (fasting 
      plasma glucose [FPG] > or = 8.3 mmol/l) when entered into a multicenter and
      double-blind study with parallel groups study. They were randomly allocated into 
      two groups, the troglitazone group (the T group: 400 mg/day p.o.) and the placebo
      group (the P group), and were treated with test drugs for 12 weeks. RESULTS: We
      evaluated efficacy in 136 patients of the T group and 126 patients of the P
      group. There was no significant difference in any of baseline characteristics
      between the T and P groups. In the T group, FPG and HbA1c decreased significantly
      after treatment (before versus after, FPG 10.1 +/- 1.6 vs. 8.8 +/- 1.9 mmol/l, P 
      < 0.001; HbA1c: 8.6 +/- 1.5 vs 8.1 +/- 1.7%, P < 0.001). FPG and HbA1c did not
      change after treatment in the P group (before versus after, FPG 10.1 +/- 1.8 vs. 
      9.9 +/- 2.1 mmol/l; HbA1c 8.5 +/- 1.5 vs. 8.6 +/- 1.6%). Of 136 patients in the T
      group, 62 (45.6%) were classified as responders. Serum triglyceride level also
      decreased in the T group but not in the P group. Body weight increased slightly
      only in the T group. There were no differences in changes in blood pressure
      between the two groups. No serious adverse events occurred in either group.
      CONCLUSIONS: Troglitazone at 400 mg/day decreased FPG and HbA1c significantly in 
      NIDDM patients who had failed to respond to diet therapy. Troglitazone, developed
      as a drug to enhance insulin action, can be a useful hypoglycemic agent for the
      treatment of NIDDM.

TI  - Polymorphonuclear leukocytes in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus:
      abnormalities in metabolism and function.
PG  - 919-24
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine basal levels of cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]i) and
      phagocytic activity in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) from patients with
      non-insulin-dependent diabetes (NIDDM). DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
      SETTING: A university-county hospital. MEASUREMENTS: Cytosolic calcium levels,
      adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content, and phagocytosis of PMNLs from patients
      with NIDDM and from controls. INTERVENTION: In patients with NIDDM, we evaluated 
      the effect of treatment with an oral hypoglycemic agent (glyburide) on [Ca2+]i
      levels, ATP content, and the phagocytosis of PMNLs. PATIENTS: 22 controls and 34 
      patients with NIDDM were examined. Fifteen patients were studied before and after
      3 months of treatment with glyburide. RESULTS: Polymorphonuclear leukocytes from 
      patients with NIDDM showed significantly elevated basal levels of [Ca2+]i (68 +/-
      9.6 compared with 43 +/- 4.9 nmol/L; P < 0.01); reduced ATP content (1.30 +/-
      0.58 compared with 2.35 +/- 0.45 nmol/10(6) PMNLs; P < 0.01); and impaired
      phagocytosis (117 +/- 21.0 compared with 145 +/- 17.4 micrograms oil/10(7) PMNLs 
      per minute; P < 0.01) compared with controls. There was a direct and significant 
      correlation (P < 0.01, r = 0.80) between [Ca2+]i levels in PMNLs and serum
      glucose levels and an inverse correlation between phagocytic ability and [Ca2+]i 
      levels (P < 0.01; r = 0.62) as well as between phagocytic activity and fasting
      serum glucose levels (P < 0.01, r = 0.54) in patients with NIDDM. Glyburide
      therapy resulted in significant reduction in fasting serum glucose levels; in
      PMNLs, this treatment resulted in a significant reduction in [Ca2+]i levels, a
      significant increase in ATP content, and a significant improvement of
      phagocytosis. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with NIDDM have elevated [Ca2+]i levels in
      PMNLs. This abnormality is probably induced by hyperglycemia and is primarily
      responsible for the imparied phagocytosis seen in these patients.

PG  - 433-9
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a traditional Chinese
      treatment (TCT) based on three plants in association with a sulfonylurea,
      glibenclamide (2.5 mg X 3/d). A 2 X 2 factorial design was adopted for this
      multicentre randomized double-blind trial involving 4 groups [A = placebo (P) TCT
      + P glibenclamide; B = P TCT + verum glibenclamide; C = verum TCT + P
      glibenclamide; D = verum TCT + verum glibenclamide]. Patients included were type 
      2 diabetic outpatients, 40-70 years of age, treated by diet alone or oral
      anti-diabetic drugs. Endpoint criteria evaluated were HbA1, blood glucose and
      plasma insulin (at fasting, and 1 and 2 h after a test meal). At each visit, a
      clinical examination was performed, and a questionnaire on side effects and
      associated symptoms was completed. The dose was reduced by half in the case of
      hypoglycaemia. The 216 patients were recruited in 5 centres [Shanghai (1) = 48,
      Shanghai (2) = 40, Beijing = 40, Canton = 42, Chengdu = 46 and randomized into
      treatment groups A, B, C, D (56, 56, 50 and 54 respectively). Eleven patients
      were withdrawn for administrative reasons. In patients treated with
      glibenclamide, a significant increase in weight and insulinaemia was observed,
      together with a significant decrease in blood glucose values; in those receiving 
      TCT, blood glucose values were significantly decreased only 2 h after the test
      meal. A synergistic effect on blood glucose was observed when both treatments
      were given. Hypoglycaemia occurred in 19 patients (all in the two verum
      glibenclamide groups). This first multicentre controlled trial showed that the 3 
      Chinese plants tested were well-tolerated and effective in Type 2 diabetes as
      indicated by a significant synergistic effect in association with a sulfonylurea.

TI  - More uniform diurnal blood glucose control and a reduction in daily insulin
      dosage on addition of glibenclamide to insulin in type 1 diabetes mellitus: role 
      of enhanced insulin sensitivity.
PG  - 880-4
AB  - Combination therapy with insulin and sulphonylurea has gained acceptance in
      management of subjects with Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus.
      However, its role in management of Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus
      remains controversial. In this study, the effect of combination therapy with
      insulin and glibenclamide on metabolic control, daily insulin dosage, and insulin
      sensitivity was assessed in subjects with Type 1 diabetes mellitus. Ten men with 
      Type 1 diabetes mellitus participated in a randomized, double-blind, crossover,
      clinical trial with three treatment regimens, namely (1) insulin alone, (2)
      insulin and placebo, (3) insulin and glibenclamide, each lasting 3 months.
      Combination therapy induced: (1) reduction in daily insulin dosage; (2) more
      uniform blood glucose control as reflected by a lower average 24 h blood glucose 
      level, a smaller difference between mean preprandial and 2 h postprandial blood
      glucose concentrations, decreased 24 h urine glucose excretion, and a decline in 
      number of hypoglycaemic events; (3) improved insulin sensitivity as expressed by 
      more rapid plasma glucose disappearance rate, without a significant alteration in
      fasting plasma glucagon and 1h postprandial serum C-peptide levels; when compared
      with treatment with either insulin alone or with insulin and placebo. Therefore, 
      it is apparent that the addition of glibenclamide to insulin reduces daily
      insulin dosage and renders a greater uniformity to diurnal blood glucose control,
      most probably secondary to enhancement of insulin sensitivity.

TI  - Unchanged gene expression of glycogen synthase in muscle from patients with NIDDM
      following sulphonylurea-induced improvement of glycaemic control.
PG  - 1230-8
AB  - We have previously shown that the mRNA expression of muscle glycogen synthase is 
      decreased in non-insulin-dependent diabetic (NIDDM) patients; the objective of
      the present protocol was to examine whether the gene expression of muscle
      glycogen synthase in NIDDM is affected by chronic sulphonylurea treatment. Ten
      obese patients with NIDDM were studied before and after 8 weeks of treatment with
      a weight-maintaining diet in combination with the sulphonylurea gliclazide.
      Gliclazide treatment was associated with significant reductions in HbA1C
      (p=0.001) and fasting plasma glucose (p=0.005) as well as enhanced beta-cell
      responses to an oral glucose load. During euglycaemic, hyperinsulinaemic clamp (2
      mU x kg-1 x min-1) in combination with indirect calorimetry, a 35% (p=0.005)
      increase in whole-body insulin-stimulated glucose disposal rate, predominantly
      due to an increased non-oxidative glucose metabolism (p=0.02) was demonstrated in
      teh gliclazide-treated patients when compared to pre-treatment values. In
      biopsies obtained from vastus lateralis muscle during insulin infusion, the
      half-maximal activation of glycogen synthase was achieved at a significantly
      lower concentration of the allosteric activator glucose 6-phosphate (p=0.01).
      However, despite significant increases in both insulin-stimulated non-oxidative
      glucose metabolism and muscle glycogen synthase activation in gliclazide-treated 
      patients no changes were found in levels of glycogen synthase mRNA or
      immunoreactive protein in muscle. In conclusion, improved blood glucose control
      in gliclazide-treated obese NIDDM patients has no impact on the gene expression
      of muscle glycogen synthase.

TI  - Response of truncated glucagon-like peptide-1 and gastric inhibitory polypeptide 
      to glucose ingestion in non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. Effect of
      sulfonylurea therapy.
PG  - 165-9
AB  - Gastric inhibitory polypeptide (tGIP) and truncated glucagon like peptide-1
      (GLP-1) are potent gastrointestinal insulinotropic factors (incretin), are most
      released after a meal or ingestion of glucose in man and animals. To investigate 
      whether sulfonylurea (SU) affects the secretion of incretin, the modulation of
      plasma GIP and tGLP-1 levels following glucose ingestion in non-insulin-dependent
      diabetic type 2 patients with or without SU therapy was studied. A 75-G oral
      glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was carried out on 9 healthy subjects (controls)
      and 18 patients with non-obese type 2, 9 of whom were treated by diet alone
      (NIDDM-diet) and the other 9 with SU (glibenclamide 2.5 mg or gliclazide 40 mg)
      once a day (NIDDM-SU). Plasma GIP was measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) with R65
      antibody, and GLP-1 was measured by RIA with N-terminal-directed antiserum R1043 
      (GLP-1NT) and C-terminal-directed antiserum R2337 (GLP-1CT). Following OGTT,
      plasma glucose, GIP, GLP-1NT, and GLP-1CT in type 2 patients increased more
      markedly than in controls, despite the lower response of insulin. However, there 
      were no significant differences in plasma levels of these peptides between the
      NIDDM-diet and NIDDM-SU groups. Therefore, it is unlikely that SU is involved in 
      the high response of GIP and GLP-1s to OGTT in type 2 patients.

PG  - 256-60
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the most suitable treatment for Type 2
      (non-insulin-dependent) diabetic patients with secondary failure to sulfonylureas
      (SFS). In a four-month comparative study, 36 Type 2 diabetic patients given SFS
      were allocated to three treatment groups: A (n = 12, M/F 6/6, HbAlc 9.1 +/- 1.6%)
      received 0.3 IU/Kg body weight (BW) of insulin-Zn between 10 and 11 p.m.; B (n = 
      12, M/F 6/6, HbAlc 9.2 +/- 1.6%) SFS plus 850 mg/day of metformin; and C (n = 12,
      M/F 6/6, HbAlc 9.5 +/- 2.4%) SFS plus acarbose 3 x 100 mg daily. Modifications in
      HbAlc, BW, blood pressure (BP), lipoprotein profile and insulin sensitivity were 
      evaluated. HbAlc decreased in the three groups (A: 17.9 +/- 13.5%; B: 18.2 +/-
      4.5%; C: 7.6 +/- 16.8%; all p < 0.05; A and B vs C = p < 0.05). BW increased in
      group A and decreased in the other groups. BP decreased statistically in group B.
      HDL-cholesterol increased (1.26 +/- 0.46 vs 1.49 +/- 0.36 mmol/L; p < 0.05) and
      triglyceride levels decreased (1.68 +/- 0.85 vs 1.16 +/- 0.43 mmol/L; p < 0.05)
      in group A. There were no significant changes in the other studied parameters. We
      conclude that, for Type 2 diabetic patients given SFS, both insulin and metformin
      plus SFS provided better glycaemic control than acarbose plus SFS. Metformin
      combined with SFS offered further advantages for the control of BW and BP.

      on examined parameters].
PG  - 228-34
AB  - The purpose of the present work was to assess the relationship of leukocyte and
      erythrocyte superoxide dismutase activity to its cofactors concentrations i.e.
      zinc and copper in plasma and erythrocyte in diabetic patients and treatment
      variability. 104 patients were included in the study. 23 persons were in the
      control group. All patients were divided into 2 groups (NIDDM and IDDM). Patients
      with NIDDM were divided into 3 subgroups depending on treatment (insulin,
      gliclazide, dietary treated). In all groups, there were assessed following
      parameters: the leucocyte and erythrocyte SOD activity according to the method of
      Misra and Fridovich, and zinc and copper concentrations in plasma and
      erythrocyte, which were measured by flame absorption spectrophotometry.
      Statistical analysis was performed using the CRISP program. CONCLUSION: 1. The
      leukocyte and erythrocyte superoxide dismutase activity is significantly lowered 
      in diabetes mellitus. 2. In diabetic patients both in type I and type II as in
      the healthy people, there is a close correlation between SOD activity and its
      cofactors i.e. zinc and copper erythrocyte concentrations. 3. Insulin and
      gliclazide treatment increases SOD activity and delays late diabetic
      complications.

TI  - Efficacy of metformin in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
      The Multicenter Metformin Study Group.
PG  - 541-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sulfonylurea drugs have been the only oral therapy available for
      patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) in the United
      States. Recently, however, metformin has been approved for the treatment of
      NIDDM. METHODS: We performed two large, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind,
      controlled studies in which metformin or another treatment was given for 29 weeks
      to moderately obese patients with NIDDM whose diabetes was inadequately
      controlled by diet (protocol 1: metformin vs. placebo; 289 patients), or diet
      plus glyburide (protocol 2: metformin and glyburide vs. metformin vs. glyburide; 
      632 patients). To determine efficacy we measured plasma glucose (while the
      patients were fasting and after the oral administration of glucose), lactate,
      lipids, insulin, and glycosylated hemoglobin before, during, and at the end of
      the study. RESULTS: In protocol 1, at the end of the study the 143 patients in
      the metformin group, as compared with the 146 patients in the placebo group, had 
      lower mean (+/- SE) fasting plasma glucose concentrations (189 +/- 5 vs. 244 +/- 
      6 mg per deciliter [10.6 +/- 0.3 vs. 13.7 +/- 0.3 mmol per liter], P < 0.001) and
      glycosylated hemoglobin values (7.1 +/- 0.1 percent vs. 8.6 +/- 0.2 percent, P < 
      0.001). In protocol 2, the 213 patients given metformin and glyburide, as
      compared with the 210 patients treated with glyburide alone, had lower mean
      fasting plasma glucose concentrations (187 +/- 4 vs. 261 +/- 4 mg per deciliter
      [10.5 +/- 0.2 vs. 14.6 +/- 0.2 mmol per liter], P < 0.001) and glycosylated
      hemoglobin values (7.1 +/- 0.1 percent vs. 8.7 +/- 0.1 percent, P < 0.001). The
      effect of metformin alone was similar to that of glyburide alone. Eighteen
      percent of the patients given metformin and glyburide had symptoms compatible
      with hypoglycemia, as compared with 3 percent in the glyburide group and 2
      percent in the metformin group. In both protocols the patients given metformin
      had statistically significant decreases in plasma total and low-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations, whereas the values in
      the respective control groups did not change. There were no significant changes
      in fasting plasma lactate concentrations in any of the groups. CONCLUSIONS:
      Metformin monotherapy and combination therapy with metformin and sulfonylurea are
      well tolerated and improve glycemic control and lipid concentrations in patients 
      with NIDDM whose diabetes is poorly controlled with diet or sulfonylurea therapy 
      alone.

PG  - 387-92
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our study investigated the metabolic benefits deriving from chronic
      pharmacological vitamin C administration in aged non-insulin dependent (Type II) 
      diabetic patients. METHODS: Forty type II diabetic patients (age: 72 +/- 0.5
      years) underwent placebo and vitamin C (0.5 g twice daily) administration in
      double-blind, randomized, cross-over fashion. All patients were treated by oral
      hypoglycaemic agents which continued throughout the study. After baseline
      observations, treatment periods lasted 4 months and were separated by a 30-day
      wash-out period. RESULTS: Patients' antropometric data were unchanged throughout 
      the study. Chronic vitamin C administration vs placebo was associated with a
      significant decline in fasting plasma free radicals (0.26 +/- 0.06 vs 0.49 +/-
      0.07 p < 0.03) and insulin (90 +/- 4 vs 73 +/- 6 pmol/L p < 0.04), total- (7.3
      +/- 0.5 vs 5.8 +/- 0.4 mmol/L p < 0.03), LDL-cholesterol (5.6 +/- 0.6 vs 4.1 +/- 
      0.3 mmol/L p < 0.05) and triglycerides (2.58 +/- 0.07 vs 2.08 +/- 0.04 mmol/L p <
      0.04) levels. In 20 patients, chronic vitamin C administration improved whole
      body glucose disposal and nonoxidative glucose metabolism. Percent increase in
      plasma vitamin C levels correlated with the percent decline in plasma
      LDL-cholesterol (r = 0.44; p < 0.007) and insulin levels (r = 0.42; p < 0.006).
      Finally percent increase in plasma vitamin C levels was correlated with the
      percent decline in plasma free radicals and increase in GSH levels. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Chronic vitamin C administration has beneficial effects upon glucose and lipid
      metabolism in aged non-insulin dependent (type II) diabetic patients.

TI  - Prevention of complications in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).
PG  - 263-88
AB  - It is expected that the number of patients with diabetes mellitus will increase
      in the near future. The high rate of microvascular and macrovascular
      complications developing in these patients will place an even higher burden on
      our healthcare systems. Several pathophysiological factors are involved in the
      development of complications, among which are hyperglycaemia per se, the
      consequent formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and the
      intracellular accumulation of sorbitol. In addition, hypertension and
      dyslipidaemia also play an important role, especially in the development of
      coronary heart disease and stroke. The major therapeutic goals in patients with
      non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) are to reduce obesity and
      normalise lipid disturbances and increased blood pressure, in order to improve
      the well-being of the patient and reduce the risk of the development of late
      diabetic complications. Often, pharmacological treatment of the hyperglycaemia is
      necessary, in which case sulphonylureas, metformin, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors 
      such as acarbose, or insulin may be employed. It is believed that medical
      interventions, by their effect on improving metabolic control, reduce the
      incidence and severity of diabetic complications, especially when considering the
      toxic effects of glucose and the accumulation of AGEs as a consequence of raised 
      tissue glucose levels. This concept is also based on extrapolation of the finding
      of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial that intensive glycaemic control 
      in IDDM will prevent the progression of at least the microvascular complications 
      like retinopathy and nephropathy. There are, however, no long term studies in
      NIDDM patients to show that treatment with oral antihyperglycaemic agents helps
      to postpone or prevent complications. It is expected that the UK Prospective
      Diabetes Study will show whether better metabolic control, either with oral
      antihyperglycaemics or with insulin, will indeed improve outcome. Several other
      studies aiming at specific risk factor intervention (hypertension,
      hyperlipidaemia, lipid oxidation) in NIDDM patients are currently ongoing.

TI  - Comparison of bedtime NPH or preprandial regular insulin combined with
      glibenclamide in secondary sulfonylurea failure.
PG  - 1183-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of bedtime NPH insulin or preprandial regular
      insulin combined with glibenclamide on metabolic control in non-insulin-dependent
      diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) patients with secondary failure to sulfonylurea
      therapy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Eighty NIDDM patients were randomized to
      treatment with either three preprandial doses of regular insulin (daytime group
      D) or a bedtime dose of NPH insulin (nocturnal insulinization, group N), both
      regimens being combined with 10.5 mg of glibenclamide. Metabolic profiles were
      obtained at 0, 6, 16 weeks. RESULTS: Glycemic control had improved significantly 
      in both groups after 4 months. Fasting blood glucose was significantly lower
      compared with baseline in both groups. The mean change +/- SD in group D was -2.8
      +/- 3.5 mmol/l and in group N -6.4 +/- 3.0 mmol/L, the reduction being more
      pronounced in group N compared with group D (P < 0.0001). HbA1c was lowered
      similarly, from 9.2 +/- 1.4 to 7.1 +/- 1.2% in group D (P < 0.0001) and from 9.1 
      to 1.1 to 7.5 +/- 1.5% in group N (P < 0.0001). The total daily insulin doses
      were similar, 29 +/- 11 U in group D and 26 +/- 9 U in group N, and the
      circulating insulin levels during daytime were higher in group D than in group N.
      Total serum cholesterol and triglycerides were similarly and significantly
      lowered compared with baseline in both groups. Weight gain was more pronounced in
      group D (3.4 +/- 0.3 kg) than in group N (1.9 +/- 1.9 kg; D vs. N, P < 0.002),
      and the change was inversely correlated with initial eight but not with the
      improvement in HbA1c. CONCLUSIONS: The two insulin regimens exert similar effect 
      on glucose metabolism and serum lipids in NIDDM patients on combination therapy. 
      Weight gain is more pronounced in patients given insulin during the daytime when 
      preprandial doses of short-acting insulin are used.

TI  - Comparison of miglitol and glibenclamide in diet-treated type 2 diabetic
      patients.
PG  - 162-7
AB  - The efficacy of the new intestinal alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, miglitol, and
      glibenclamide were compared in a 6-month double-blind controlled protocol
      involving 100 non-insulin dependent diabetic patients under diet alone. HbA1c
      levels (initially between 7 and 11%) were reduced (p < 0.05): -0.78 +/- 0.21%
      after miglitol and -1.18 +/- 0.20% after glibenclamide. The difference between
      the two treatments was not significant, although glibenclamide appeared to be
      more active than miglitol at 8 (p = 0.002) and 16 weeks (p = 0.01) but not at 24 
      weeks. Fasting glycaemia decreased after miglitol (8.7 +/- 0.3 vs 9.6 +/- 0.3
      mmol/l, p = 0.005) and after glibenclamide (8.0 +/- 0.3 vs 9.1 +/- 0.3, p =
      0.007). After miglitol, a decrease was noted after breakfast (p < 0.001) and
      lunch (p < 0.001). The same was true for glibenclamide (p = 0.004 and p < 0.001
      respectively). A significant reduction in glucose incremental area during a
      standard meal test was noted at the end of miglitol (p = 0.008) or glibenclamide 
      treatment (p = 0.04). Subgroups of nonresponders to both treatments were
      identified (10/49 with miglitol, 9/47 with glibenclamide). Side effects were
      recorded in 10 patients treated with miglitol (flatulence and meteorism,
      diarrhoea, 1 discontinued therapy) and in 10 treated with glibenclamide
      (asthenia, sensation of hunger). This study indicates that miglitol is suitable
      for initial application in diet-resistant Type 2 diabetic patients, providing, a 
      persistent effect and acceptable side effects.

TI  - Dyslipidemias in patients with diabetes mellitus: classification and risks and
      benefits of therapy.
PG  - 317-37
AB  - To characterize the lipid and lipoprotein abnormalities in patients with diabetes
      mellitus and evaluate the risks and benefits of marketed pharmacologic therapies,
      a MEDLINE search of the National Library of Medicine data base was performed of
      studies published from January 1966 to March 1994. Clinical trials assessing
      effects on lipids and lipoproteins, and adverse effects of marketed
      lipid-lowering agents were extracted. Reviews and other relevant articles were
      included if they provided information regarding lipid and lipoprotein metabolism 
      or guidelines on the treatment of dyslipidemias in patients with diabetes
      mellitus. An extensive review of clofibrate was not included. The most common
      dyslipidemia in patients with poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes
      mellitus (IDDM) is combined elevated triglyceride and cholesterol levels, with
      reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (mixed hyperlipidemia).
      Hypertriglyceridemia combined with a reduced HDL cholesterol is the most common
      dyslipidemia in patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, but
      essentially any pattern of dyslipidemia may be present. Small and dense
      low-density lipoprotein (LDL), glycosylation of lipoproteins, and increased
      oxidized lipoproteins may be present in patients with diabetes mellitus; all
      contribute to accelerated atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Insulin therapy
      generally corrects quantitative lipid abnormalities in patients with IDDM, so
      drug treatment is seldom indicated. Diet, exercise, and insulin or oral
      sulfonylureas will improve hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL concentrations, but
      do not always return them to normal. Drug therapy is indicated when
      nonpharmacologic measures are inadequate. It is administered based on the effects
      of each agent on lipids and lipoproteins, patient age, adverse effect profile,
      patient tolerability, and drug-disease and drug-drug interactions. A fibric acid 
      derivative is the drug of choice for marked hypertriglyceridemia in patients with
      diabetes mellitus. Niacin can worsen glycemic control, but it may be required in 
      severe hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, or mixed hyperlipidemia.
      Bile-acid binding resins may accentuate hypertriglyceridemia but may be useful in
      selected patients with marked hypercholesterolemia and normal triglycerides.
      Hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reduced inhibitors are preferred in patients
      with elevated LDL cholesterol and mild hypertriglyceridemia. Patients with marked
      lipid abnormalities or mixed hyperlipidemias may require carefully dosed
      combinations of lipid-lowering drugs.

PG  - 521-5
AB  - To assess the influence of orlistat on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics 
      (the blood glucose-lowering effect) of glyburide, an open-label,
      placebo-controlled, randomized, two-way crossover study was done in 12 healthy
      male volunteers. Each subject received single 5-mg oral doses of glyburide
      (Micronase; The Upjohn Company, Kalamazoo, MI) on the fifth day of treatment with
      placebo (treatment A) and 80-mg orlistat (treatment B) three times a day for 4
      1/3 days; the two treatments were separated by a five-day washout period. Serial 
      blood samples were collected before and at appropriate intervals after each
      glyburide dose to determine plasma concentrations and blood glucose levels.
      Values of Cmax and AUC of glyburide showed an equality of the two treatments by
      the analysis of variance. There was an apparent correlation between blood glucose
      level and the logarithm of plasma glyburide concentration; this relationship
      appeared to not be altered when glyburide was administered with orlistat. In
      conclusion, orlistat administered at doses of 80-mg three times daily does not
      significantly alter the pharmacokinetics and blood glucose-lowering effect of a
      single 5-mg oral dose of glyburide in healthy volunteers.

TI  - Energy expenditure in type 2 diabetic patients on metformin and sulphonylurea
      therapy.
PG  - 401-8
AB  - Insulin and sulphonylurea therapies have both been reported to cause weight gain 
      in Type 2 diabetic patients whereas metformin does not have this adverse effect. 
      The mechanism for this difference is unclear. We have investigated in a
      cross-over study the effect of sulphonylurea and metformin therapy on energy
      expenditure and body composition in 10 Type 2 diabetic patients (7 females, 3
      males) of various weights (mean body mass index 33.4 (SD 7.6 kg m-2)). Free
      living total energy expenditure was measured over 14 days by the doubly labelled 
      water method adjusted for urinary glucose energy losses and resting energy
      expenditure by ventilated hood indirect calorimetry. Overall, total energy
      expenditure (12.88 +/- 4.17 vs 13.1 +/- 3.69 MJ 24 h-1) and resting metabolic
      rate (7.30 +/- 1.75 vs 7.23 +/- 1.74 MJ 24 h-1) were similar on metformin and
      sulphonylurea therapy, respectively. When adjusted for differences in fat free
      mass, resting metabolic rate on sulphonylurea therapy was slightly but
      significantly lower (mean difference -5.5 kJ 24 h-1 kg-1, 95% CI -1.2, -9.9 kJ 24
      h-1 kg-1, p < 0.05). Fat free mass also increased significantly by 1.3 kg (95% CI
      0.4, 2.4 kg, p < 0.05) when on sulphonylurea therapy, thus compensating for the
      lower resting metabolic rate per kg fat free mass to leave overall resting
      metabolic rate unchanged compared to metformin therapy. We also investigated the 
      effect of adding metformin to six Type 2 diabetic patients already on insulin.
      This did not lead to any measurable changes in any of the components of energy
      expenditure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Metformin. A review of its pharmacological properties and therapeutic use in
      non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 721-49
AB  - The biguanide metformin (dimethylbiguanide) is an oral antihyperglycaemic agent
      used in the management of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). It
      reduces blood glucose levels, predominantly by improving hepatic and peripheral
      tissue sensitivity to insulin without affecting the secretion of this hormone.
      Metformin also appears to have potentially beneficial effects on serum lipid
      levels and fibrinolytic activity, although the long term clinical implications of
      these effects are unclear. Metformin possesses similar antihyperglycaemic
      efficacy to sulphonylureas in obese and nonobese patients with NIDDM.
      Additionally, interim data from the large multicentre United Kingdom Prospective 
      Diabetes Study (UKPDS) indicated similar antihyperglycaemic efficacy for
      metformin and insulin in newly diagnosed patients with NIDDM. Unlike the
      sulphonylureas and insulin, however, metformin treatment is not associated with
      increased bodyweight. Addition of metformin to existing antidiabetic therapy
      confers enhanced antihyperglycaemic efficacy. This may be of particular use in
      improving glycaemic control in patients with NIDDM not adequately controlled with
      sulphonylurea monotherapy, and may serve to reduce or eliminate the need for
      daily insulin injections in patients with NIDDM who require this therapy. The
      acute, reversible gastrointestinal adverse effects seen with metformin may be
      minimised by administration with or after food, and by using lower dosages,
      increased slowly where necessary. Lactic acidosis due to metformin is rare, and
      the risk of this complication may be minimised by observance of prescribing
      precautions and contraindications intended to avoid accumulation of the drug or
      lactate in the body. Unlike the sulphonylureas, metformin does not cause
      hypoglycaemia. Thus, metformin is an effective antihyperglycaemic agent which
      appears to improve aberrant plasma lipid and fibrinolytic profiles associated
      with NIDDM. Possible long term clinical benefits of this drug with regard to
      cardiovascular mortality and morbidity are not yet established but are being
      assessed in a major ongoing study. Since metformin does not promote weight gain
      or hypoglycaemia it should be considered first-line pharmacotherapy in obese
      patients with NIDDM inadequately controlled by nonpharmacological measures.
      Metformin appears similarly effective for the pharmacological management of NIDDM
      in nonobese patients.

TI  - Effect of insulin treatment on serum lipoprotein(a) in non-insulin-dependent
      diabetes.
PG  - 194-200
AB  - In order to evaluate whether Lp(a), a lipoprotein that is potentially
      thrombogenic and atherogenic, is a potential risk factor for CAD in
      non-insulin-dependent diabetes (NIDDM), we compared the Lp(a) and its
      distribution in 145 NIDDM patients with that in 94 healthy control subjects.
      Furthermore, we studied the effect of insulin treatment on serum Lp(a) in 108
      patients with NIDDM. Male and female NIDDM patients had similar Lp(a)
      concentrations to healthy controls (median value 167 mg L-1, range 15-1550 mg L-1
      vs. 157 mg L-1, range 15-919 mg L-1, NS and 92, range 15-1190 mg L-1 vs. 103 mg
      L-1, range 15-842 mg L-1, NS). Also, the cumulative distribution of Lp(a) did not
      differ between the NIDDM patients and healthy subjects. Insulin treatment
      increased Lp(a) in diabetics with a Lp(a) concentration of less than 300 mg L-1, 
      but this effect was not related to the concomitant improvement in metabolic
      control (mean change (+/- SEM) of HbA1c from 9.80 +/- 0.15 to 8.00 +/- 0.12; P < 
      0.001). In subjects with elevated Lp(a) concentrations (> 300 mg L-1) the Lp(a)
      concentration was unaffected by insulin, despite a similar improvement in
      glycaemic control. These results suggest that insulin may modulate the
      concentration of Lp(a).

TI  - Treatment of hypercholesterolemia in NIDDM with policosanol.
PG  - 393-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether elevated levels of cholesterol and low-density
      lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) 
      patients could be decreased by policosanol, a new cholesterol-lowering drug.
      NIDDM predisposes patients to coronary artery disease (CAD) through the direct
      action of hyperglycemia on the arteries as well as the dyslipidemia induced by
      NIDDM. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This double-blind placebo-controlled trial
      was performed in 29 patients with NIDDM and hypercholesterolemia. After stable
      glycemic control was achieved by diet and/or oral hypoglycemic drugs, patients
      were instructed to follow a cholesterol-lowering diet for 6 weeks. Patients who
      met entry criteria received, under double-blind conditions, policosanol (5 mg) or
      placebo tablets twice a day for 12 weeks. RESULTS: Policosanol (10 mg/day)
      significantly reduced total cholesterol by 17.5% and LDL cholesterol by 21.8%
      compared with baseline and placebo. Furthermore, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)
      cholesterol was raised by 11.3% (not significant), and triglycerides showed a
      statistically nonsignificant decrease of 6.6%. These changes in lipid profile
      were similar to those induced by policosanol in nondiabetic patients with type II
      hyperlipoproteinemia. CONCLUSIONS: Glycemic control was unaffected by treatment. 
      No clinically or biochemically adverse effects attributable to treatment were
      observed. Only one patient (placebo) withdrew from the trial because of an
      adverse experience (erythema). We concluded that policosanol is effective and
      safe in patients with NIDDM and hypercholesterolemia.

TI  - Comparison of insulin with or without continuation of oral hypoglycemic agents in
      the treatment of secondary failure in NIDDM patients.
PG  - 307-14
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Optimal insulin regimens for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 
      (NIDDM) patients with secondary failure are controversial. We evaluated the
      efficacy, side effects, and quality of life of patients receiving insulin either 
      alone or in combination with their previous oral hypoglycemic agents (OHAs).
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifty-three Chinese patients with NIDDM (mean age
      53.9 +/- 12.6 years, duration of diabetes 9.0 +/- 4.9 years, body wt 60.4 +/-
      13.3 kg with corresponding body mass index 24.2 +/- 4.3 kg/m2, receiving the
      maximum dose of sulfonylurea and/or metformin) were confirmed to have OHA
      failure. Twenty-seven patients were randomized to continue OHAs and were given
      additional bedtime insulin (combination group); 26 patients were randomized to
      insulin therapy alone with twice-daily insulin (insulin group). Insulin doses
      were increased incrementally, aiming at fasting plasma glucose (FPG) < 7.8 mmol/l
      during a stabilization period of up to 8 weeks. Insulin dosage, body weight,
      glycemic control, and quality of life were assessed before and at 3 and 6 months 
      after stabilization. RESULTS: Both groups showed similar improvement of glycemic 
      control. For the combination group, FPG decreased from 13.5 +/- 2.7 to 8.9 +/-
      3.0 mmol/l at 3 months (P < 0.0001) and to 8.6 +/- 2.5 mmol/l at 6 months (P <
      0.0001). For the insulin group, FPG decreased from 13.5 +/- 3.6 to 7.5 +/-3.0
      mmol/l at 3 months (P < 0.0001) and to 9.8 +/- 3.5 mmol/l at 6 months (P <
      0.0001). No significant differences were observed between the groups. Similarly, 
      both groups had significant improvement of fructosamine and glycosylated
      hemoglobin (HbA1c). Fructosamine fell from a mean of 458 to 365 mumol/l at 3
      months (P < 0.0001) and to 371 mumol/l at 6 months (P < 0.0001) and from 484 to
      325 mumol/l at 3 months (P < 0.0001) and to 350 mumol/l at 6 months (P < 0.0001) 
      for the combination and insulin groups, respectively. HbA1c decreased from 10.2
      to 8.4% at 3 months (P < 0.0001) and to 8.7% at 6 months (P < 0.0001) in the
      combination group and from 10.7 to 7.8% at 3 months (P < 0.0001) and to 8.4% at 6
      months (P < 0.0001) in the insulin group. Despite similar improvement of
      glycemia, insulin requirements were very different. At 3 months, the combination 
      group was receiving a mean of 14.4 U/day compared with 57.5 U/day in the insulin 
      group (P < 0.0001). Similar findings were observed at 6 months (15.0 vs 57.2
      U/day, P < 0>0001). Both groups gained weight. However, for the combination
      group, weight gain was 1.6 +/- 1.8 kg at 3 months and 2.1 +/- 2.5% kg at 6 months
      (both P < 0.0001 vs baseline), whereas for the insulin group, weight gain was 3.5
      +/- 4.3 and 5.2 +/- 4.1 kg, respectively (both P < 0.0001 vs baseline). Weight
      gain was significantly greater in the insulin group (P < 0.05 at 3 months, and P 
      < 0.005 at 6 months). Fasting plasma triglyceride decreased in the insulin group 
      (1.8 +/- 1.0 to 1.4 +/- 0.8 mmol/l at 3 months [P < 0.005] and to 1.4 +/ 0.7
      mmol/l at 6 months [P < 0.02] but not in the combination group. No changes were
      observed in total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. No severe
      hypoglycemic reactions were recorded in either group. Mild reactions occurred
      with similar frequency in both groups. Well-being and quality of life improved
      significantly in both groups. The majority of patients (82.7%) wanted to continue
      insulin beyond 6 months, irrespective of the treatment group. CONCLUSIONS: In
      NIDDM patients with secondary OHA failure, therapy with a combination of OHAs and
      insulin and with insulin alone was equally effective and well tolerated. However,
      combination therapy was associated with a lower insulin dose and less weight
      gain. Combination treatment may be considered when OHA failure occurs as a
      potential intermediate stage before full insulin replacement.

PG  - 193-9
AB  - Recent animal studies have demonstrated that selective blockade of ATP-sensitive 
      K+ (KATP) channels of vascular smooth muscle results in a significant increase in
      peripheral vascular tone. The main aim of this study was to assess whether
      glyburide, a selective blocker of KATP channels and commonly used antidiabetic
      agent, influences resting blood flow and reactive hyperemic response of
      peripheral tissues of normal subjects. Baseline calf blood flow was measured
      non-invasively in six normal subjects with femoral venous occlusive
      plethysmography. Calf blood flow was also serially measured every 30-60 s after
      the release of calf arterial occlusion (10 min duration). Reactive hyperemia was 
      expressed in terms of peak post-occlusive flow, duration of hyperemia and
      reactive hyperemic volume. In each subject, baseline flow and reactive hyperemia 
      were measured before (control) and every hour for 5 h after the oral ingestion of
      either 7.5 mg glyburide or a placebo on two separate days. Baseline calf flow
      declined by 30 and 42% of control values after 1 and 2 h of glyburide intake (P <
      0.05) with a return to control values by hours 3, 4 and 5. Peak post-occlusive
      flow after 1, 2 and 3 h of glyburide ingestion was lower than control values by
      22, 30 and 28%, respectively (P < 0.05). The duration of reactive hyperemia after
      2 and 3 h of glyburide ingestion was significantly longer than control values (P 
      < 0.05), whereas reactive hyperemic volume remained unaffected by glyburide
      intake. Placebo elicited no significant changes in baseline flow or reactive
      hyperemia throughout the 5-h experimental period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

TI  - [Response of insulin and C-peptide to a mixed meal in non-insulin-dependent
      diabetics treated with insulin and chlorpropamide].
PG  - 21-8
AB  - Glucose control in NIDDM is prone to progressive deterioration due to secondary
      failure to oral hypoglycemic therapy. Insulin may subsequently be required for
      optimal control in spite of peripheral hyperinsulinemia. In Mexico, diabetes
      associated with obesity is common. We therefore designed a prospective study
      combining insulin and chloropropamide in order to evaluate any improvement in
      insulin response to a standardized meal load and a consequent amelioration of
      glucose control. METHODS. Twenty diabetic patients with secondary failure to full
      doses of hypoglycemic drugs and moderate hyperglycemia were recruited. Therapy
      was initiated with human insulin 20 IU/day and 500 mg cholopropamide, titrating
      insulin dosage in order to achieve euglycemia. Before treatment and at the end of
      the study period, a glucose/insulin/C peptide response curve to a mixed
      standardized meal was performed. Blood glucose, serum lipids fructosamine and
      glycosylated hemoglobin levels were also determined. All patients were followed
      by capillary glucose measurements three times a week and glucose and fructosamine
      concentrations every two weeks during the study period. RESULTS. All patients
      required less insulin, and glucose control improved significantly. Glucose,
      fructosamine and glycosylated hemoglobin levels decreased from 262 mg/dL, 369
      mmol/L and 14% to 111 mg/dL, 252 mmol/L, and 8% respectively; all differences
      were statistically significant. Insulin and C peptide levels increased
      significantly from 22.2 mU/mL and 1.65 ng/mL to 29.8 mU/mL and 1.97 ng/mL,
      respectively. When we measured the area under the curve, total values improved
      from 110 and 7.69 to 127 and 9.37, respectively; this was also statistically
      significant. Lipids levels decreased significantly, including triglicerides,
      total and LDL cholesterol whereas HDL cholesterol levels increased. CONCLUSIONS. 
      Glucose control improved in our patient cohort the pancreatic insulin response
      probably due to a more adequate glycemic microenvironment and a possible enhanced
      exogenous and endogenous insulin function.

TI  - Glibenclamide vs gliclazide in type 2 diabetes of the elderly.
PG  - 974-80
AB  - The objective of this study was to compare the effect of two sulphonylureas on
      the frequency of hypoglycaemic events and glycaemic control in elderly patients
      with Type 2 diabetes. Twenty-two untreated elderly patients were treated with
      glibenclamide or gliclazide in a randomized double-blind fashion. Prior to
      treatment, a biochemical profile, an oral glucose tolerance test, and a 2-h
      hyperglycaemic glucose clamp (glucose 5.4 mmol l-zs-1 above baseline) were
      performed. Patients were seen regularly over 6 months to assess glycaemic control
      and the frequency of hypoglycaemic reactions. Hyperglycaemic clamp studies and
      oral glucose tolerance tests were repeated at 1 and 6 months. The area under the 
      curve for the oral glucose tolerance test (glibenclamide: 15.5 +/- 0.7;
      gliclazide: 14.9 +/- 0.8 mmol l-1 (p = NS)) and the haemoglobin A1C
      (glibenclamide: 7.4 +/- 0.2%; gliclazide: 7.9 +/- 0.5% (p = NS)) were similar at 
      6 months. Hypoglycaemic reactions were significantly more frequent with
      glibenclamide than with gliclazide: 17 vs 4 (p < 0.01). Insulin sensitivity index
      (ml kg-1 min-1 pmol-1 x 100) was increased significantly by glibenclamide but not
      gliclazide (glibenclamide: 0.284 +/- 0.116 (baseline) vs 0.518 +/- 0.102 (6
      months) (p < 0.05), gliclazide: 0.260 +/- 0.048 (baseline) vs 0.358 +/- 0.048 (6 
      months) (p = NS)). We conclude that glycaemic control was equivalent with the two
      drugs but the incidence of hypoglycaemic reactions was significantly greater with
      glibenclamide probably because this drug increases insulin sensitivity to a
      greater degree.

TI  - Antihyperglycaemic efficacy, response prediction and dose-response relations of
      treatment with metformin and sulphonylurea, alone and in primary combination.
PG  - 953-60
AB  - The short-term (2-12 weeks) antihyperglycaemic efficacy of metformin (M),
      glibenclamide (G), and their primary combination (MG) was assessed in a
      double-blind study including 165 unselected patients with Type 2 diabetes.
      Patients with diet failure were randomized to M, G or MG. The dose was titrated
      with a fasting blood glucose concentration (FBG) of < 6.7 mmol l-1 as the target,
      using at most six dose levels, the first three comprising increasing monotherapy 
      (M or G) or low-dose primary combination (MGL), and the second three add-on
      therapies (M/G and G/M) and primary combination therapy escalated to high dose
      (MGH). Success rates were higher on MGL than on monotherapy. The difference in
      achieving acceptable control (FBG < or = 7.8 mmol 1(-1)) was 70% versus 51% (95% 
      confidence interval 3-36%, p = 0.032). When the drugs were combined, a slightly
      greater FBG reduction (p = 0.026) was observed, at lower dosage (p = 0.013). The 
      response could not be predicted from body weight, but depended upon initial FBG
      (p = 0.019) and meal-stimulated C-peptide (p = 0.007). FBG declined progressively
      with increasing doses of metformin, whereas glibenclamide exerted most of its
      effect at low dose. Primary combination therapy with metformin and sulphonylurea 
      may be clinically useful.

TI  - Minimal model analyses of insulin sensitivity and glucose-dependent glucose
      disposal in black and white Americans: a study of persons at risk for type 2
      diabetes.
PG  - 843-50
AB  - We have examined the impact of race and positive family history of type 2
      diabetes on glucose/insulin dynamics and the two components of glucose disposal
      in healthy, first-degree relatives of black and white American patients with type
      2 diabetes mellitus who are at a greater risk from the disease and their healthy 
      control subjects. Seventeen black and 15 white relatives were studied. Twenty-two
      black people and 24 white people, without family history of type 2 diabetes,
      served as healthy control subjects. Standard oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)
      and tolbutamide-modified frequent sampling intravenous glucose tolerance (FSIGT) 
      tests were performed in each subject. Insulin sensitivity index (SI) and glucose 
      effectiveness (SG) were calculated using the MINIMOD method described by Bergman 
      et al. Mean fasting and post-stimulation serum glucose levels were not
      significantly different in the black and white relatives. However, mean serum
      insulin responses to oral and/or intravenous stimulation were significantly
      greater in the blacks than whites, irrespective of positive family history of
      diabetes. The mean SI was significantly (P < 0.02) lower (52%) in the black (3.67
      +/- 0.56) than the white [7.50 +/- 1.93 x 10(-4) min-1 (mU1)-1] relatives.
      Comparing the healthy controls, the mean SI was significantly (P < 0.02) lower
      (51%) in black than white controls (4.84 +/- 0.78 vs. 9.71 +/- 1.27 x 10
      min-1(mU1)-1]. Mean SG and KG were greater (P < 0.05) in the blacks than whites, 
      irrespective of family history of diabetes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

      membrane width in diabetic patients.
PG  - 952-61
AB  - This study investigated the long-term effect of insulin or the combination of
      insulin and an oral hypoglycemic compound (glipizide) on the skeletal muscle
      capillary basement membrane width in insulin-requiring diabetic patients. Seventy
      diabetic patients were randomized to treatment with either insulin-placebo or
      insulin-glipizide (5 mg/d) for 3 years. Of these, only 61 patients completed the 
      study; 27 patients received insulin-placebo and 34 patients received
      insulin-glipizide. Three skeletal muscle (quadriceps femoris) biopsies were
      performed in all patients over a 3-year period. Glycosylated hemoglobin A1 was
      determined every 100 +/- 20 days, including plasma glucose levels. Muscle
      capillary basement membrane width was quantitated by a previously described
      method. After approximately 16 months, glycosylated hemoglobin A1 decreased
      significantly in each group from its baseline (P < 0.001 insulin-glipizide group 
      and P < 0.025 insulin-placebo), although no statistically significant difference 
      was seen between the two groups. After 3 years this decrease was statistically
      significant (P < 0.001) only in the insulin-glipizide group. At baseline, no
      statistically significant difference was found in the muscle capillary basement
      membrane width between the two groups. In spite of the significant decrease in
      glycosylated hemoglobin A1 in both groups after 14 to 16 months, only muscle
      capillary basement membrane width in the insulin-glipizide group decreased
      significantly compared with baseline. Patients receiving insulin-placebo showed a
      gradual increase in the muscle capillary basement membrane width, which after 3
      years was significantly higher than baseline (P < 0.02). Although the mechanisms 
      by which the addition of glipizide to insulin treatment reduced the thickening of
      the muscle capillary basement membrane are not clearly understood, the current
      findings suggest that diabetic microangiopathy is not necessarily progressive and
      that prophylaxis may be attained.

TI  - Re-evaluation of a biguanide, metformin: mechanism of action and tolerability.
PG  - 187-228
AB  - Metformin is a biguanide antidiabetic medication, that has been in use for over
      30 years. Its mechanism of action, unknown until a few years ago, is now linked
      to an improved peripheral sensitivity to insulin, through a stimulated tissue
      glucose uptake by a transporter linked system. Interest in metformin has been
      revived by the recent observation of a specific activity of this agent on some of
      the major traits of the so called 'polymetabolic syndrome' (or 'syndrome X'),
      characterized by: insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension and
      reduced fibrinolytic activity. Metformin, in studies examining one or more of
      these, has been shown, possibly through its peripheral insulin sensitizing
      mechanism, to correct most of the major symptoms characterizing this insulin
      resistance syndrome. Metformin, similarly to the other biguanide phenformin, has 
      been rated as potentially dangerous, because of the possible induction of lactic 
      acidosis, in some cases with a fatal outcome. Metformin is, however, associated
      with a very low incidence of lactic acidosis because, differently from
      phenformin, it does not undergo liver metabolism and, as a consequence, there are
      no high-risk groups, displaying an impaired metabolic handling. In this review,
      in addition to an overall evaluation of the more recent data on the mechanism of 
      action and clinical use of metformin, a detailed clinical analysis of all
      published cases of lactic acidosis is provided. These data indicate that the risk
      in metformin use is negligible, provided that care is taken when prescribing the 
      drug to patients with suspected clinical risks of lactic acidosis.

TI  - Ethnic differences in secretion, sensitivity, and hepatic extraction of insulin
      in black and white Americans.
PG  - 755-62
AB  - Hyperinsulinaemia and abnormalities in hepatic insulin extraction commonly
      coexist in ethnic groups with severe insulin resistance. Therefore, we compared
      the effects of ethnicity on glucose/insulin/C-peptide dynamics, hepatic insulin
      extraction, and insulin sensitivity in healthy black (n = 32) and white (n = 30) 
      Americans. Standard oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and tolbutamide-modified, 
      frequently sampled, intravenous glucose tolerance (FSIVGT) tests were performed
      in each subject. Insulin sensitivity index (S1)) was calculated using the MINIMOD
      method described by Bergman et al. Basal and post-stimulation hepatic insulin
      extraction were calculated by the molar ratios of C-peptide and insulin
      concentrations during the basal steady state and areas under the post-stimulation
      hormone curves, respectively. Apart from a slightly greater mean serum glucose
      peak response after oral glucose in the whites, mean glucose levels were
      identical in the blacks and whites during both stimulations. In contrast, serum
      insulin levels at basal and during both stimulations were significantly greater
      (2-3 fold) in the blacks than whites. However, the corresponding C-peptide
      responses were identical in both groups. The basal and postprandial hepatic
      insulin extraction were 33% and 45% lower in the blacks when compared to whites, 
      respectively. The mean S1 was significantly (p < 0.02) lower in the blacks (4.93 
      +/- 0.46) than the whites (7.17 +/- 0.88 x 10(-4).min-1 (mU l-1)-1). We conclude 
      that ethnicity may be a major determinant of the mechanism of peripheral
      hyperinsulinaemia and insulin insensitivity in black and white Americans.

TI  - Lack of interaction between glipizide and co-trimoxazole.
PG  - 997-1002
AB  - To identify the effects of co-trimoxazole on the elimination and disposition
      kinetics of glipizide, eight healthy male volunteers were studied in an
      unblinded, randomized, cross-over trial with two phases (no treatment or
      co-trimoxazole 160/800 mg twice a day). During each phase, subjects were treated 
      at home for 7 days with one of the treatment regimens, followed by a 24-hour
      hospitalization for a single-dose challenge with 10-mg oral glipizide and
      detailed blood studies. A 7-day washout period was interspersed between the
      phases. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were determined and
      compared using the Student's t-test for paired observations. Glipizide area under
      the curve (AUC), clearance, and half life for treatment and control phases were
      5758 +/- 1874 versus 5176 +/- 1505 micrograms/L/hour (P = .21), 0.41 +/- 0.15
      versus 0.45 +/- 0.14 mL/min/kg (P = .27), and 5.13 +/- 2.10 versus 3.95 +/- 1.37 
      hours (P = .04), respectively. Twenty-four-hour glucose AUCs for treatment and
      control phases were 112.24 +/- 8.76 versus 114.86 +/- 11.98 mmol/L/hour (P =
      .55), respectively. The only parameter reaching statistical significance was
      glipizide half life, but the difference is of doubtful clinical significance
      because of difficulty in identifying a clear elimination phase in several
      subjects. It is concluded that co-trimoxazole administration did not
      significantly alter glipizide disposition and elimination kinetics in this study 
      population.

PG  - 1141-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether short-term strict control of blood glucose can
      improve abnormal visual evoked potentials (VEPs) in poorly controlled diabetic
      patients with no overt diabetic complications. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: VEPs 
      (P100 wave latencies) were recorded in 12 poorly controlled diabetic patients (7 
      with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and 5 with non-insulin-dependent
      diabetes mellitus) before and after at least 3 days of near normoglycemia
      obtained by continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). Exclusion criteria
      were overt diabetic neuropathy or retinopathy. The control subjects were 12
      healthy subjects matched for age and sex. Fifty-two other subjects formed a
      reference control population. The intra-individual coefficient of variation for
      P100 latency was < 3%. RESULTS: The P100 latencies were longer in diabetic
      patients than in control subjects (means of both eyes +/- SD: 116.8 +/- 10.1 vs. 
      106.2 +/- 4.5 ms, P < 0.01), and 4 of the 12 diabetic patients had abnormal VEPs.
      After 3 days of close blood glucose control (mean blood glucose profile fell from
      13.7 +/- 2.2 mmol/l to 6.8 +/- 1.2 mmol/l, P < 0.01), the mean P100 latencies
      were significantly shorter (112.5 +/- 7.6 ms, P < 0.01) but were still
      significantly longer than control values. The longer the initial P100 latency,
      the greater the decrease after CSII. There was no correlation between the fall in
      blood glucose and improvement in VEPs. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term blood glucose
      normalization is associated with improved P100 wave latency in uncomplicated
      diabetic patients. These data suggest that abnormal VEPs are partly reversible
      and include functional disturbances related to glucose metabolism.

TI  - Effect of metformin on postprandial lipemia in patients with fairly to poorly
      controlled NIDDM.
PG  - 1093-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To quantify the effect of metformin on the metabolism of triglyceride 
      (TG)-rich lipoprotein of intestinal origin in patients with non-insulin-dependent
      diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) who had responded to sulfonylurea but still had fasting
      hyperglycemia. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with NIDDM who had
      demonstrated a fall in fasting plasma glucose concentration > 2.2 mmol/l in
      response to glipizide treatment but continued to have fasting plasma glucose
      concentrations > 8.3 mmol/l were studied. Fasting glucose, GHb, lipid and
      lipoprotein concentrations were determined, and resistance to insulin-mediated
      glucose disposal was estimated by measuring the steady-state plasma glucose
      (SSPG) concentration at the end of a 180-min infusion of somatostatin, glucose,
      and insulin. In addition, plasma glucose, insulin, and TG concentrations were
      measured at frequent intervals from 0800 to 2400, with patients eating breakfast 
      at 0800 and lunch at 1200. Vitamin A was also given at lunch, and the retinyl
      ester content in plasma and in chylomicron (Svedberg flotation constant [Sf] >
      400) and the chylomicron remnant (Sf 20-400) fractions were used to quantify the 
      concentration of postprandial intestinal TG-rich lipoprotein from 1200 to 2400.
      RESULTS: Fasting plasma glucose concentrations (6.8 +/- 0.4 vs. 10.5 +/- 0.4
      mmol/l), GHb levels (7.9 +/- 0.3 vs. 10.8 +/- 0.5%), and day-long plasma glucose 
      concentrations were all significantly lower after metformin treatment (P <
      0.001), which was associated with a significant (P < 0.001) fall in SSPG
      concentration (11.0 +/- 0.9 to 9.6 +/- 0.6 mmol/l). In addition, postprandial
      concentrations of glucose, insulin, free fatty acids, and TG were lower (P <
      0.001) following metformin treatment. Postprandial retinyl ester concentrations
      were also lower in plasma by 33 +/- 5.7% (P < 0.001) and in both the chylomicron 
      (32 +/- 7.2%, P < 0.001) and chylomicron remnant (26 +/- 7.0%, P < 0.005)
      fractions. CONCLUSIONS: Addition of metformin to sulfonylurea-treated patients
      with NIDDM with less than optimal glycemic control was associated with improved
      glycemic control, lower postprandial insulin and TG concentrations, and a
      decrease in postprandial concentration of TG-rich lipoproteins of intestinal
      origin. All of these changes might be expected to decrease risk of coronary heart
      disease.

AB  - Plasma lipids and VLDL and HDL composition were studied in a control group of 20 
      non diabetic subjects and in 31 male middle-age patients with non-insulin
      dependent diabetes treated by oral hypoglycemic agent glibenclamide and a weight 
      maintaining diet. Data for the diabetics were separated based on haemoglobin A1c 
      of less or greater than 7%. VLDL composition abnormalities were more frequent in 
      the diabetic patients with HbA1c of > 7%. VLDL-cholesterol, VLDL-triglycerides
      and VLDL-phospholipids were high in all diabetics whereas VLDL-apo B increased
      only in diabetics with HbA1c > 7%. Apo CII and apo CIII levels and also apo
      CII/apo CIII ratio were also reduced in the diabetic patients with HbA1c levels
      of more than 7%. Increases in the apo E and apo E/apo C ratio were also seen in
      the more hyperglycemic diabetics with HbA1c levels > 7%. In contrast apo CII and 
      apo CIII levels and also Apo CII/Apo CIII ratio remained unaltered in diabetic
      patients with less than 7% HbA1c levels. In these patients increases in the apo E
      levels were found while the apo E/apo C ratio remained unaltered. All diabetic
      patients showed increases in HDL-triglycerides and triglyceride/total cholesterol
      ratio with respect to control. Decreases in HDL-apo AI were also seen in both
      groups of diabetics, but the HDL-apo AI/HDL-apo AII ratio did not differ from
      control.

TI  - Effects of glibenclamide on ventricular fibrillation in non-insulin-dependent
      diabetics with acute myocardial infarction.
PG  - 767-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glibenclamide, a hypoglycemic sulfonylurea, has shown antiarrhythmic 
      effects in acutely ischemic myocardium. The aim of the present study was to
      evaluate the effectiveness of the drug in preventing ventricular fibrillation in 
      diabetic patients with acute myocardial infarction. METHODS: We studied 232
      patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (106 on glibenclamide,
      group A1; 126 treated with another hypoglycemic drug or with diet only, group A2)
      and 830 non-diabetic people. All the patients were admitted to our coronary care 
      unit with their first myocardial infarction. RESULTS: Ventricular fibrillation
      occurred in 1.9% of group A1, 7.9% of group A2, and 9.9% of the non-diabetic (A1 
      versus A2, P < 0.05; A2 versus the non-diabetic group, NS; A1 versus the
      non-diabetic group, P < 0.01). Sustained ventricular tachycardia was not
      significantly different among the groups. CONCLUSIONS: The antiarrhythmic
      effectiveness of glibenclamide might be related to its blocking action on the
      ATP-dependent potassium channel, with consequent attenuation of the efflux of
      potassium induced by ischemia. We also observed a higher mortality rate resulting
      from heart failure in group A2 than in group A1 or the non-diabetic group. Since 
      glibenclamide has never shown significant effects on myocardial contractility,
      this finding remains to be elucidated. Glibenclamide therefore appears to have an
      antifibrillatory effect in acute myocardial infarction; with respect to acute
      coronary events, the drug might be able to prevent ventricular fibrillation,
      which is most often fatal when it occurs before hospitalization.

TI  - Ischemic preconditioning during coronary angioplasty is prevented by
      glibenclamide, a selective ATP-sensitive K+ channel blocker.
PG  - 700-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Brief episodes of ischemia render the heart more resistant to
      subsequent ischemia; this phenomenon has been called ischemic preconditioning. In
      some animal species, myocardial preconditioning appears to be due to activation
      of ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels. The role played by KATP channels in
      preconditioning in humans remains unknown. The aim of this study was to establish
      whether glibenclamide, a selective KATP channel blocker, abolishes the ischemic
      preconditioning observed in humans during coronary angioplasty following repeated
      balloon inflations. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty consecutive patients undergoing
      one-vessel coronary angioplasty were randomized to receive 10 mg oral
      glibenclamide or placebo. Sixty minutes after glibenclamide or placebo
      administration, patients were given an infusion of 10% dextrose (8 mL/min) to
      correct glucose plasma levels or, respectively, an infusion of saline at the same
      infusion rate. Thirty minutes after the beginning of the infusion, both patient
      groups underwent coronary angioplasty. The mean values (+/- 1 SD) of ST-segment
      shifts on the surface 12-lead ECG and the intracoronary ECG were measured at the 
      end of the first and second balloon inflations, both 2 minutes long. In
      glibenclamide-treated patients, the mean ST-segment shift during the second
      balloon inflation was similar to that observed during the first inflation (23 +/-
      13 versus 20 +/- 8 mm, P = NS), and the severity of cardiac pain was greater (55 
      +/- 21 versus 43 +/- 23 mm on a scale of 0 to 100, P < .05). Conversely, in
      placebo-treated patients the mean ST-segment shift during the second inflation
      was less than that during the first inflation (9 +/- 5 versus 23 +/- 13 mm, P <
      .001), as was the severity of cardiac pain (15 +/- 15 versus 42 +/- 19 mm, P <
      .01). Blood glucose levels were significantly reduced 60 minutes after
      glibenclamide compared with those at baseline (53 +/- 9 versus 102 +/- 10 mg/100 
      mL, P < .001) in the glibenclamide group; however, before coronary angioplasty,
      blood glucose levels increased to 95 +/- 19 mg/100 mL, a value similar to that
      found in placebo group (96 +/- 11 mg/100 mL, P = NS). CONCLUSIONS: In humans,
      ischemic preconditioning during brief repeated coronary occlusions is completely 
      abolished by pretreatment with glibenclamide, thus suggesting that it is mainly
      mediated by KATP channels.

TI  - Effect of glipizide treatment on postprandial lipaemia in patients with NIDDM.
PG  - 781-7
AB  - The primary goal of the present study was to examine the effects of improved
      glycaemic control associated with glipizide treatment on postprandial lipaemia in
      non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients. The metabolism of triglyceride-rich
      lipoproteins of intestinal origin was assessed by measuring the retinyl palmitate
      content in plasma and the Svedberg flotation index (Sf) > 400 and Sf 20-400
      lipoprotein fractions. Fasting plasma glucose concentrations (14.5 +/- 0.5 vs 9.0
      +/- 0.5 mmol/l), glycated haemoglobin levels (13.1 +/- 0.6 vs. 9.7 +/- 0.6%), and
      daylong plasma glucose concentrations were all significantly lower after
      glipizide treatment (p < 0.001). The improvement in glycaemic control was
      associated with increases in insulin-mediated glucose uptake (p < 0.001) and
      plasma post-heparin lipoprotein and hepatic lipolytic activities (p < 0.02). Both
      fasting plasma triglyceride (3.09 +/- 0.51 vs 2.37 +/- 0.34 mmol/l), and
      postprandial triglyceride concentrations (p < 0.05-0.001) were lower following
      glipizide treatment, associated with a significant fall in retinyl palmitate
      content in all three lipoprotein fractions (p < 0.02-0.001), with the most
      substantial decrease seen in the Sf20-400 fraction. These data indicate that
      glipizide-induced improvement in glycaemic control was associated with changes in
      the metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins of intestinal origin that would 
      be anticipated to reduce risk of coronary heart disease in non-insulin-dependent 
      diabetic patients.

TI  - Control of diabetes during rehabilitation for diabetic stroke.
PG  - 399-404
AB  - Changes of diabetic control during rehabilitation therapy was studied
      retrospectively in 33 cases of diabetic stroke. Diabetic control was not
      deteriorated in any cases during rehabilitation therapy. In 21 cases, treatment
      of diabetes was not changed during rehabilitation therapy and the levels of
      fasting plasma glucose were decreased in all of them. Doses of hypoglycemic
      agents was reduced without significant deterioration of diabetic control in 9
      cases whose diabetic control was excellent, and in 2 cases who experienced
      hypoglycemic attack during rehabilitation therapy. In these cases, oral
      hypoglycemic agent was reduced from 2 to 1 tablet and insulin from 32 to 21 units
      per day on average. These results indicate that training in the stroke
      rehabilitation moderately improves diabetic control.

TI  - Short-term effects of felodipine in hypertensive type II diabetic males on
      sulfonylurea treatment.
PG  - 51-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the effects on blood pressure and glucose homeostasis of
      felodipine, a calcium antagonist. DESIGN: A double-blind randomized cross-over
      study comparing felodipine ER and placebo. SETTING: A university centre of
      diabetic care in Malmo, Sweden. SUBJECTS: Seventeen hypertensive type II diabetic
      males on oral sulfonylurea (glibenclamide) treatment. INTERVENTIONS: Four-week
      treatment periods separated by a 2-week wash-out period. Felodipine 10-20 mg once
      daily was given. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Blood pressure, heart rate, HbA1c and
      response to oral glucose tolerance test; glucose, insulin and c-peptide. Measured
      before randomization and at the end of each double-blind treatment period.
      RESULTS: Blood pressure was significantly reduced during felodipine treatment and
      heart rate slightly increased. Felodipine did not influence insulin or c-peptide 
      levels. There was no significant change in glucose levels but an increase in
      HbA1c. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated that felodipine is an effective agent
      for type II diabetic patients on glibenclamide treatment. The effect on HbA1c is 
      noteworthy even if not of clinical significance in the short term. Controlled
      long-term studies in diabetic patients are needed to fully evaluate
      antihypertensive agents.

TI  - Comparative dose-related time-action profiles of glibenclamide and a new
      non-sulphonylurea drug, AG-EE 623 ZW, during euglycaemic clamp in healthy
      subjects.
PG  - 703-7
AB  - Insulin and glucose responses to glibenclamide were studied in comparison to a
      novel non-sulphonylurea drug (AG) by means of the euglycaemic clamp technique.
      Nine fasting male subjects were connected to a Biostator and 1.75, 3.5 or 7.0 mg 
      glibenclamide or 1.0, 2.0 or 4.0 mg AG were given and blood glucose
      concentrations were clamped at 10% below basal values. Glucose infusion rates
      were registered over 10 h after administration of the tablet. Maximal glucose
      infusion rates after glibenclamide were 40% higher compared to AG (1.75 vs 1.0
      mg, 3.5 vs 2.0 mg, 7.0 vs 4.0 mg, respectively) and were reached after 3-3.5 h
      for all doses. After glibenclamide, area under the glucose infusion curves and
      maximal incremental serum insulin responses were higher by 25-40% and by 30%
      compared to AG when low, medium and high doses of each drug were tested. However,
      a linear dose relationship was obtained for both drugs when the glucose infusion 
      rate was plotted against the area under the insulin curve. In fact, both drugs
      were equipotent on a molecular weight basis. The hypoglycaemic index of both
      drugs (integrated glucose infusion rate divided by integrated insulin release)
      expressed per mumol of drug revealed a dose-dependent and parallel inverse
      curvilinear relation to increasing doses. This methodological approach allowed us
      to quantify and compare the metabolic effects of oral hypoglycaemic agents under 
      standardised experimental conditions.

TI  - Alcohol tolerance in patients with non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes
      treated with sulphonylurea derivatives.
PG  - 727-34
AB  - The oral ethanol loading test (0.5 g/kg body mass given as 40% solution) was
      carried out in 5 groups, each of 10 out-patients with non-insulin-dependent (type
      2) diabetes before and after 10 days of treatment with one of the following
      sulphonylurea derivatives: tolbutamide (CAS 64-77-7) 0.5 t.i.d., chlorpropamide
      (CAS 94-20-2) 0.5 once daily morning, glibornuride (CAS 26944-48-9) 0.025 t.i.d.,
      glibenclamide (CAS 10238-21-8) 0.005 t.i.d. and glipizide (CAS 29094-61-9) 0.005 
      t.i.d. The response to alcohol (facial flush, heart rate, blood pressure) were
      compared, and blood concentrations of ethanol, acetaldehyde, pyruvate, lactate,
      hydrocarbonates as well as blood pH, pO2 and pCO2 were determined in fasting
      state and during 6 hours after alcohol ingestion. In all patients the family
      history of diabetes and the presence and degree of vascular complications were
      registered. Evident flushing phenomenon was observed in 6 patients treated with
      chlorpropamide, in 3 treated with tolbutamide, in 2 treated with glibenclamide,
      in one receiving glibornuride and in none treated with glipizide. All drugs
      caused a greater rise of blood ethanol and acetaldehyde levels in relation to the
      control tests, but the difference reached statistical significance only in the
      group receiving chlorpropamide. Moreover, patients (pooled) with positive
      thermographic response had also significantly higher blood levels of ethanol and 
      acetaldehyde during the second test. The ratio of acetaldehyde to ethanol
      concentration in blood (mumol:mmol) was not significantly changed in any group
      indicating parallel impairment of both steps of ethanol metabolism.(ABSTRACT

TI  - [Management of diabetes in general practice--current requirements. 2: Oral
      antidiabetics and insulin therapy].
PG  - 163-6
AB  - Oral antidiabetic agents continue to play an important role in the treatment of
      type 2 diabetes. Of decisive importance is the timing of their use, together with
      a knowledge of their specific properties. Acarbose, which needs to be initiated
      at a low, slowly increasing dose, is noted for the fact that it has virtually no 
      systemic side effects. Metformin reduces plasma glucose levels without inducing
      hyperinsulinemia, and carries virtually no risk of lactic acidosis. Glibenclamide
      can be used either alone to treat type 2 diabetes or in combination with other
      oral antidiabetics or insulin. Today, intensified insulin therapy represents the 
      optimal standard of insulin replacement. It permits meal-oriented injection of
      normal insulin and the use of longer-acting insulin overnight. This form of
      treatment is now facilitated by the possibilities of plasma glucose
      selfmonitoring and the use of injection aids (pen). Intensified treatment should 
      be initiated at the time type I diabetes is diagnosed. In the case of a
      particularly instable metabolic situation or neuropathy, it may become necessary 
      to use insulin pumps.

TI  - [Effectiveness and tolerance of long-term acarbose therapy in diabetic patients
      with threatened secondary failure of sulfonylurea drug treatment].
PG  - 187-92
AB  - The efficacy and tolerability of acarbose was studied in 14 type-2-diabetic
      patients poorly controlled with diet and sulfonylureas. Acarbose was given in
      addition to sulfonylureas in a single-blind, placebo-controlled study for three
      times three months (acarbose-placebo-acarbose). At the beginning of the study and
      every three months body weight, HbA1c and biochemical and hematological safety
      parameters were measured. The patients controlled their mid morning urine glucose
      and two to four times daily their blood glucose concentration with a memory
      glucometer. Diabetic control improved significantly: HbA1c was 8.5 +/- 1.4% at
      the beginning, 6.5 +/- 1.1% after three months with acarbose (p < 0.001), 7.2 +/-
      0.9% after three months placebo (p < 0.01) and 6.7 +/- 1.3% again after three
      months with acarbose (p < 0.05). Thus, the effect of acarbose alone accounts for 
      0.7 or 0.5% respectively, whereas the effect of teaching and diet in a special
      diabetes unit (the difference from the study to placebo) accounts for 1.3% of
      HbA1c. Home monitored blood and urine glucose values were improved: The
      postprandial blood glucose concentrations, the postprandial differences, the mean
      blood glucose concentrations and the glycosuria were decreased during acarbose
      treatment in comparison with placebo. The preprandial blood glucose
      concentrations before breakfast and supper were not influenced by acarbose.
      Hematological and biochemical safety parameters as well as blood pressure and
      heart rate were unchanged. Meteorism and flatulence as typical side effects
      decreased during treatment. Acarbose is a safe and effective adjunct treatment
      for type-2-diabetic patients uncontrolled with diet and sulfonylurea alone.

TI  - Effects of glipizide on glucose metabolism and muscle content of the
      insulin-regulatable glucose transporter (GLUT 4) and glycogen synthase activity
      during hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetic patients.
PG  - 31-6
AB  - To examine whether sulphonylureas influence hyperglycaemia-induced glucose
      disposal and suppression of hepatic glucose production (HGP) in type 2 diabetes
      mellitus, a 150-min hyperglycaemic (plasma glucose 14 mmol/l) clamp with
      concomitant somatostatin infusion was used in eight type 2 diabetic patients
      before and after 6 weeks of glipizide (GZ) therapy. During the clamp a small
      replacement dose of insulin was given (0.15 mU/kg per min). Isotopically
      determined glucose-induced glucose uptake was similar before and after GZ
      administration which led to improved glycaemic control (basal plasma glucose 12.2
      +/- 1.3 vs 8.9 +/- 0.7 mmol/l; P < 0.01). Glucose-induced suppression of HGP was,
      however, more pronounced during GZ treatment (0.96 +/- 0.14 vs 1.44 +/- 0.20
      mg/kg per min; P < 0.02). Following GZ treatment hyperglycaemia failed to
      stimulate glycogen synthase activity. Moreover, GZ resulted in a significant
      increase in the immunoreactive abundance of the insulin-regulatable glucose
      transport protein (GLUT 4) (P < 0.02). In conclusion, these results suggest that 
      GZ therapy in type 2 diabetic patients enhances hepatic sensitivity to
      hyperglycaemia, while glucose-induced glucose uptake remains unaffected. In
      addition, GZ tends to normalize the activity of glycogen synthase and increases
      the content of GLUT 4 protein in skeletal muscle.

TI  - Effect of sulphonylurea therapy on plasma insulin, intact and 32/33 split
      proinsulin in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 293-8
AB  - This study was undertaken to clarify the effect of sulphonylurea therapy on beta 
      cell function in 27 subjects with newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
      Plasma glucose, insulin, intact and 32/33 split proinsulin were measured at
      diagnostic OGTT. After 8-12 weeks on a conventional diet, subjects with a fasting
      glucose > 9 mmol l-1 (n = 12) were commenced on sulphonylurea therapy. At
      diagnosis, the sulphonylurea requiring group were more hyperglycaemic (p <
      0.0001), less obese (p < 0.05) and more insulin deficient with a lower 30 min
      insulin (p < 0.0002) than the diet group. Following dietary intervention in the
      sulphonylurea group, weight remained unchanged but there was a reduction in
      fasting glucose (p < 0.009). Fasting insulin, intact proinsulin, and 32/33 split 
      proinsulin remained unchanged. After 12 weeks of sulphonylurea therapy there was 
      a weight gain of 1.5 kg (p < 0.01), but a reduction in fasting glucose (p <
      0.0001). Fasting insulin and intact proinsulin increased (p < 0.004) but 32/33
      split proinsulin remained unchanged. There was a significant increase in both the
      fasting insulin to glucose ratio (p < 0.005), and intact to 32/33 split
      proinsulin ratio (p < 0.02). Final fasting glucose following sulphonylurea
      therapy was positively correlated with the initial intact and 32/33 split
      proinsulin and the fasting glucose following dietary treatment. It is clear from 
      this work that sulphonylureas have a complex effect on beta cell physiology and
      as well as stimulating release of insulin they increase the release of intact
      proinsulin but not that of 32/33 split proinsulin, hence they increase the intact
      to 32/33 split proinsulin ratio.

TI  - Metabolic clearance rate of insulin in type 2 diabetic patients treated with
      combined insulin and sulfonylurea therapy.
PG  - 27-34
AB  - The metabolic clearance rate of insulin (MCRI) in 10 non-obese type 2 diabetic
      patients treated with either insulin alone or combined insulin plus sulfonylurea 
      therapy is investigated. A classical 2-hour euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic glucose
      clamp using the artificial pancreas was performed in a randomized order after two
      6-week periods of treatment: either with subcutaneous injections of insulin alone
      or with insulin plus oral administration of the sulfonylurea compound glipizide
      at the dose of 3 x 10 mg/day. The MCRI was calculated knowing the constant
      insulin infusion rate (0.1 U.kg-1.h-1) and measuring basal and steady-state
      plasma free insulin and C-peptide levels. When the test was performed at the end 
      of the period of treatment with insulin plus glipizide and 30 min after the
      ingestion of the last dose of 10 mg glipizide, plasma C-peptide levels were
      significantly increased and steady-state free insulin levels tended to be
      slightly higher whereas the metabolic clearance rate of glucose was not affected.
      The MCRI was significantly reduced by glipizide from 23.3 +/- 2.9 to 18.9 +/- 2.0
      ml.kg-1.min-1 p < 0.05. These results demonstrate that the sulfonylurea glipizide
      decreases the MCRI. This effect may play a role in the hypoglycemic action of
      sulfonylureas.

TI  - Effects of the carbohydrase inhibitor miglitol in sulfonylurea-treated NIDDM
      patients.
PG  - 20-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of the carbohydrase inhibitor miglitol (BAY m
      1099) on the metabolic profiles of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
      (NIDDM) patients suboptimally controlled on maximal daily doses of sulfonylurea
      (SFU) agents. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Multicenter, double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled 14-week clinical trial with six-week, single-blind placebo
      lead-in and run-out periods. NIDDM volunteers (192) with fasting plasma glucose
      (FPG) 140-250 mg/dl and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) 6.5-12.0% after at least 4 weeks
      of treatment with SFU at maximal dose were stratified by baseline HbA1c (above
      and below 9.0%) and then randomly assigned within strata to placebo (n = 63), 50 
      mg miglitol 3 times a day (n = 61), or 100 mg miglitol 3 times a day (n = 68).
      Efficacy was assessed by HbA1c, FPG, insulin, and lipid concentrations, and by
      plasma glucose and serum insulin responses to a standard meal. RESULTS: In the 50
      and 100 mg miglitol treatment groups, the mean changes from baseline in HbA1c
      (with placebo values subtracted) were 0.82 and 0.74%, respectively, and were
      highly significant (P = 0.0001 in each case). Mean peak plasma glucose levels
      after a standard test meal were comparably lowered by 57 mg/dl with the 50 mg
      miglitol dose, and by 64 mg/dl with the 100 mg miglitol dose compared with
      placebo (P = 0.0001 for each), with associated reductions in integrated serum
      insulin response (P < 0.05). No significant drug-associated changes in FPG,
      insulin, or cholesterol levels were noted, but fasting triglyceride levels were
      lowered significantly with the 50 mg miglitol dose. Miglitol's side effects were 
      limited to flatulence, loose stools, and abdominal discomfort, which were
      dose-related, rapidly resolved on drug discontinuation, and led to withdrawal
      from the study of 5 and 15% of patients taking 50 and 100 mg miglitol,
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Miglitol may be indicated as effective adjuvant
      therapy in NIDDM patients with suboptimal metabolic control despite conventional 
      treatment with diet and maximal daily doses of SFU. The dose of 50 mg miglitol 3 
      times a day may be preferable to 100 mg miglitol 3 times a day because of
      comparable efficacy and substantially reduced side effects.

TI  - Metabolic effects of metformin addition to chronic glibenclamide treatment in
      type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 15-9
AB  - In a randomized double-blind cross-over study the addition of metformin to
      chronic glibenclamide treatment was assessed conventionally (plasma glucose
      profile and HbA1c measurement) and with an euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic glucose 
      clamp in ten non obese (body mass index 22.3 +/- 0.5 (+/- SE)kg.m-2) Type 2
      diabetic patients with poor metabolic control. Metformin (500 mg twice a day) or 
      placebo were added in randomized sequence for 6 weeks to their usual
      sulphonylurea treatment (glibenclamide 5 mg three times a day, before meals). On 
      the last day of each administration period, an euglycaemic (glucose 5.5 +/- 0.5
      mmol.l-1), hyperinsulinaemic (insulin 698.1 +/- 22.9 pmol.l-1) clamp was
      performed, together with a study of insulin binding to circulating monocytes.
      Metformin reduced fasting glucose levels (6.1 +/- 0.4 vs 6.4 +/- 0.4 mmol.l-1, P 
      = 0.036), mean daily plasma glucose concentrations (9.2 +/- 0.4 mmol.l-1, P <
      0.001), and HbA1c (8.7 +/- 0.3 vs 9.3 +/- 0.2%; P = 0.027). No variations were
      registered in fasting plasma insulin or body weight. A significant reduction of
      basal hepatic glucose production (12.8 +/- 2.7 vs 33.9 +/- 4.5 mumol.kg-1 min-1, 
      P < 0.001), together with an increase in glucose utilization during the clamp
      (33.4 +/- 2.8 vs 25.9 +/- 1.1 mumol.kg-1.min-1, P = 0.033), was found after
      metformin, whereas residual glucose production during insulin infusion did not
      change. Insulin binding to circulating monocytes was higher after metformin (4.8 
      +/- 0.9 vs 3.2 +/- 0.6%, P = 0.020), while the lipaemic profile showed a
      reduction in triglycerides (1.2 +/- 0.1 vs 1.7 +/- 0.3 mmol.l-1, P = 0.039) and
      an increase in HDL-cholesterol (1.3 +/- 0.1 vs 1.0 +/- 0.1 mmol.l-1, P = 0.004)
      without variations in total cholesterol. These findings offer further evidence
      that metabolic control is improved after biguanide addition to sulphonylurea
      treatment, and support the hypothesis that biguanides improve insulin sensitivity
      both at the hepatic and peripheral (muscular) levels, as well as triglyceride
      metabolism.

TI  - The effect of hyperglycaemia on the absorption of glibenclamide in patients with 
      non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 53-5
AB  - We have studied the absorption of glibenclamide 10 mg as a single morning dose in
      7 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, comparing normoglycaemic
      and hyperglycaemic states. The maximal glibenclamide plasma concentrations were
      significantly higher in the normoglycaemic than in the hyperglycaemic state (448 
      vs 228 mg.l-1) and these peak concentrations were attained faster in
      normoglycaemia than in hyperglycaemia (3.7 vs 5 h). We conclude that the
      absorption of glibenclamide in the two states is different.

TI  - Effect of gliclazide on plasma lipids and pancreatic beta cell function in
      non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 246-50
AB  - Eighteen patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), who were 
      newly diagnosed or had their oral hypoglycemic agents discontinued for more than 
      3 months, were studied to evaluate the effect of gliclazide on glycemic control, 
      plasma lipids and beta cell function. The mean fasting plasma glucose (249 +/- 11
      vs 170 +/- 10 mg/dl, p < 0.001), postprandial plasma glucose (353 +/- 16 vs 237
      +/- 16 mg/dl, p < 0.001) and HbA1C (9.6 +/- 0.4 vs 6.5 +/- 0.3% p < 0.001)
      decreased significantly after 3-months of gliclazide treatment. The beta cell
      function showed a significant increase in fasting serum C-peptide (1.8 +/- 0.2 vs
      2.1 +/- 0.3 ng/ml, p < 0.05) and an insignificant increment in serum C-peptide
      after glucagon stimulation (2.2 +/- 0.3 vs 2.2 +/- 0.4 ng/ml, p < 0.1). In 8
      cases with an initial serum cholesterol above 200 mg/dl, the serum cholesterol
      decreased significantly (236 +/- 8 vs 200 +/- 12 mg/dl, p < 0.05). However,
      LDL-cholesterol (164 +/- 8 vs 145 +/- 13 mg, p > 0.05) and HDL-cholesterol (66
      +/- 5 vs 54 +/- 9 mg, p > 0.05) showed insignificant decrease after gliclazide
      therapy. In 4 patients with hypertriglyceridemia, the serum triglyceride
      decreased (441 +/- 161 vs 239 +/- 73 mg/dl, p > 0.1), but this was not
      statistically significant. These findings suggest that hyperglycemia, fasting
      serum C-peptide levels and hypercholesteremia are significantly improved after a 
      3-month period of gliclazide therapy in NIDDM patients.

TI  - [A comparative study of insulin and glyburide versus glyburide or insulin in the 
      chronic control of patients with type-2 diabetes].
PG  - 383-6
AB  - In order to know the usefulness of a combined treatment with gliburide and NPH
      insulin 25 patients with well controlled type II diabetes mellitus were studied. 
      The patients were randomly divided in to three groups: Group I just received
      gliburide, Group II only insulin and Group III gliburide and insulin. Glucose in 
      fast, glycosylated haemoglobin and C peptide levels were determined over five
      months. For the statistical data processing variance analysis was performed. The 
      initial and final glucose determinations were: Group I, 169.3 mg% and 139.0 mg%
      respectively (p > 0.05); Group II, 202.1 mg% and 177 mg% (p > 0.05); Group III,
      157.8 mg% and 158.8 mg% (p > 0.1) for the glycosylated haemoglobin the
      determinations were: Group I, 7.2% and 5.1% (p > 0.05); Group II, 6.2% and 5.1%
      (p > 0.05) and Group III, 5.7% and 4.7% (p > 0.05). For the C peptide were 2.5
      and 4.5 for Group I (p > 0.05), 2 and 4.1 for Group II (p > 0.05) and 3.2 and 5.3
      for Group III (p > 0.05) with no significant statistical differences. It is
      concluded that the combined treatment showed to be effective, but not superior,
      in order to control diabetic patients and it can be a useful therapeutic
      alternative in well selected patients.

TI  - Effect of an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor on intestinal fermentation and faecal
      lipids in diabetic patients.
PG  - 257-67
AB  - Eight non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients, in whom oral
      hypoglycaemic agents were not effective, were treated with an alpha-glucosidase
      inhibitor, AO-128 (0.9 mg/day) for 6 months. After 6 months of treatment there
      was a statistically significant decrease in the blood glucose level 1 and 2 h
      postprandially. The 2 h blood glucose level was also significantly reduced after 
      2 months' treatment. The insulin and HbA1c levels after 2 and 6 months' treatment
      were lower than those before administration. Faecal weight, the frequency of
      bowel movements, the ratio of hydroxy fatty acids to total fatty acids, and
      faecal short-chain carboxylic acid content were all increased significantly
      during treatment. The initially hard stools became normal or soft, although no
      actual diarrhoea developed. Both faecal bile-acid excretion and the ratio of
      primary bile acids to total bile acids were increased significantly after 2
      months, but they showed some recovery towards the pretreatment levels after 6
      months' treatment. There was no distinct change in neutral sterol and fatty acid 
      excretion. Breath hydrogen excretion showed a slight increase after treatment.
      These results suggest that intestinal fermentation was promoted and the
      intestinal transit time was shortened by AO-128 administration.

TI  - The use of glipizide combined with intensive insulin treatment for the induction 
      of remissions in new onset adult type I diabetes.
PG  - 281-8
AB  - To determine if glipizide could enhance remission induction in new onset type 1
      diabetes compared to intensive insulin treatment alone, 27 patients with type 1
      diabetes were intensively treated in an open randomized trial with subcutaneous
      injections for one month. The insulin was randomly either discontinued (Group A) 
      or the insulin discontinued and glipizide begun (Group B) Three patients in Group
      A (22%) and 7 in Group B (54%, p < .05) underwent insulin-free remissions for
      10.3 +/- 4.4 and 8.7 +/- 2.6 months, respectively (p = NS). Mean blood glucose
      levels during insulin treatment were lower in patients entering remissions (94
      +/- 3 mg/dl versus 102 +/- 5 mg/dl, p < 0.05). C-peptide levels were performed 0,
      4, 8, and 24 weeks after insulin treatment. When all patients were examined, mean
      stimulated C-peptide levels at 4 weeks (0.58 +/- 0.09 pm/ml) were increased
      compared to time 0 (0.32 +/- 0.05 pm/ml, p < 0.02). Patients not entering
      remission had higher 4-week stimulated values (0.67 +/- 0.12 pm/ml) compared to
      time 0 values (0.29 +/- 0.06 pm/ml, p < .01), whereas remission patients' mean
      C-peptide levels remained similar at 0, 4, 8 and 24 weeks. These data indicate
      that a) insulin treatment plus glipizide induces higher rates of remission
      compared to intensive insulin treatment alone, b) the intensity of initial
      metabolic control may be an important determinant for remission induction, and c)
      endogenous insulin secretion is not associated with remission induction,
      suggesting that glipizide alters insulin sensitivity or is immunomodulatory in
      the context of new onset type 1 diabetes.
