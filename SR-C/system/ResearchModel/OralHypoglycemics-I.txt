TI  - Nateglinide (Starlix): update on a new antidiabetic agent.
PG  - 535-41
AB  - Nateglinide is a new oral antidiabetic agent that stimulates insulin release
      promptly after its pre-meal administration in a strongly glucose-dependent
      fashion. Because its insulinotropic effects are short in duration, nateglinide
      specifically targets postprandial hyperglycaemia with a low potential to elicit
      hypoglycaemia or sustained hyperinsulinaemia. Nateglinide has an excellent safety
      and tolerability profile, and its efficacy in reducing HbA1c in monotherapy (120 
      mg before meals) is comparable to that of metformin, sulphonylureas,
      thiazolidinediones or acarbose (-0.5 to -1.5%). When combined with metformin,
      which primarily reduces fasting glucose levels, nateglinide's effects are
      additive. In our clinical experience, nateglinide is a particularly good
      therapeutic option in newly diagnosed, treatment-naive patients; elderly patients
      in whom hypoglycaemia is a concern; patients with kidney failure or mild hepatic 
      impairment; patients taking low-dose sulphonylureas who encounter problems with
      hypoglycaemia; and patients failing to achieve adequate glycaemic control on
      metformin or thiazolidinedione monotherapy.

TI  - Glimepiride in type 2 diabetes mellitus: a review of the worldwide therapeutic
      experience.
PG  - 799-816
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sulfonylureas (SUs) have been used for many years as first-line
      therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose blood glucose levels
      have not been effectively controlled by diet and exercise alone. Glimepiride is a
      once-daily SU that was introduced in 1995. Since then, a considerable body of
      evidence has been amassed regarding its use in type 2 diabetes. OBJECTIVE: This
      review provides a comprehensive summary of available data on the pharmacology,
      pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety profile of glimepiride in the treatment of
      type 2 diabetes. It also examines the use of glimepiride to achieve and maintain 
      good glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes in current clinical
      practice. METHODS: Relevant articles were identified through a search of MEDLINE 
      for English-language studies published from 1990 to 2002. The search terms used
      were glimepiride, sulfonylureas, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The manufacturer
      of glimepiride provided additional information. RESULTS: Glimepiride differs from
      other SUs in a number of respects. In clinical studies, glimepiride was generally
      associated with a lower risk of hypoglycemia and less weight gain than other SUs.
      Results of other studies suggest that glimepiride can be used in older patients
      and those with renal compromise. There is evidence that glimepiride preserves
      myocardial preconditioning, a protective mechanism that limits damage in the
      event of an ischemic event. Glimepiride can be used in combination with other
      oral antidiabetic agents or insulin to optimize glycemic control. CONCLUSION:
      Based on the evidence to date, glimepiride is an effective and well-tolerated
      once-daily antidiabetic drug and provides an important treatment option for the
      management of type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Influence of drugs interacting with CYP3A4 on the pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics, and safety of the prandial glucose regulator repaglinide.
PG  - 649-60
AB  - The object of this study was to analyze drug interactions between repaglinide, a 
      short-acting insulin secretagogue, and five other drugs interacting with CYP3A4: 
      ketoconazole, rifampicin, ethinyloestradiol/levonorgestrel (in an oral
      contraceptive), simvastatin, and nifedipine. In two open-label, two-period,
      randomized crossover studies, healthy subjects received repaglinide alone,
      repaglinide on day 5 of ketoconazole treatment, or repaglinide on day 7 of
      rifampicin treatment. In three open-label, three-period, randomized crossover
      studies, healthy subjects received 5 days of repaglinide alone; 5 days of
      ethinyloestradiol/levonorgestrel, simvastatin, or nifedipine alone; or 5 days of 
      repaglinide concomitant with ethinyloestradiol/levonorgestrel, simvastatin, or
      nifedipine. Compared to administration of repaglinide alone, concomitant
      ketoconazole increased mean AUC0-infinity for repaglinide by 15% and mean Cmax by
      7%. Concomitant rifampicin decreased mean AUC0-infinity for repaglinide by 31%
      and mean Cmax by 26%. Concomitant treatment with CYP3A4 substrates altered mean
      AUC0-5 h and mean Cmax for repaglinide by 1% and 17%
      (ethinyloestradiol/levonorgestrel), 2% and 27% (simvastatin), or 11% and 3%
      (nifedipine). Profiles of blood glucose concentration following repaglinide
      dosing were altered by less than 8% by both ketoconazole and rifampicin. In all
      five studies, most adverse events were related to hypoglycemia, as expected in a 
      normal population given a blood glucose regulator. The safety profile of
      repaglinide was not altered by pretreatment with ketoconazole or rifampicin or by
      coadministration with ethinyloestradiol/levonorgestrel. The incidence of adverse 
      events increased with coadministration of simvastatin or nifedipine compared to
      either repaglinide or simvastatin/nifedipine treatment alone. No clinically
      relevant pharmacokinetic interactions occurred between repaglinide and the CYP3A4
      substrates ethinyloestradiol/levonorgestrel, simvastatin, or nifedipine. The
      pharmacokinetic profile of repaglinide was altered by administration of potent
      inhibitors or inducers, such as ketoconazole or rifampicin, but to a lesser
      degree than expected. These results are probably explained by the metabolic
      pathway of repaglinide that involves other enzymes than CYP3A4, reflected to some
      extent by a small change in repaglinide pharmacodynamics. Thus, careful
      monitoring of blood glucose in repaglinide-treated patients receiving strong
      inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 is recommended, and an increase in repaglinide
      dose may be necessary. No safety concerns were observed, except a higher
      incidence in adverse events in patients receiving repaglinide and simvastatin or 
      nifedipine.

TI  - The effect of prandial glucose regulation with repaglinide on treatment
      satisfaction, wellbeing and health status in patients with pharmacotherapy naive 
      Type 2 diabetes: a placebo-controlled, multicentre study.
PG  - 413-25
AB  - This prospective, 16-week, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group study
      assessed the differential impact of the prandial glucose regulating oral
      hypoglycaemic drug, repaglinide, and placebo upon perceptions of quality of life 
      (QoL) and treatment satisfaction in pharmacotherapy-naive patients with Type 2
      diabetes. In addition, the study assessed whether these outcomes were influenced 
      by the patients' level of glycaemic control. A total of 253 patients were
      randomised in a 2:1 ratio of repaglinide: placebo, with doses taken flexibly with
      main meals (2-4 per day), whenever they were eaten. Repaglinide was initiated at 
      0.5 mg per meal, increased to 1 mg after 4 weeks if fasting plasma glucose
      exceeded 7.8 mmol/l. QoL and treatment satisfaction outcomes were compared using 
      generic and disease-specific self-assessment measures, previously applied in
      diabetes: the WHO Wellbeing Questionnaire (WHO-WBQ), WHO Diabetes Treatment
      Satisfaction Questionnaire (WHO-DTSQ) and EuroQoL EQ-5D. Over the trial period,
      repaglinide-treated patients reported a significant 9% improvement in (WHO-DTSQ) 
      treatment satisfaction score (p < 0.05). No significant increase was associated
      with placebo. The correlation between decrease in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c)
      and increase in treatment satisfaction (WHO-DTSQ) was -0.22 (p < 0.01). Scores
      obtained with the other measures did not change significantly during the trial in
      either group, but the cohort exhibited only a slight reduction in wellbeing
      (WHO-WBQ) and health status (EQ-5D) at baseline compared with the background
      population. In conclusion, flexible mealtime dosing with oral medication appears 
      to be well accepted by pharmacotherapy-naive patients with Type 2 diabetes. The
      results suggest that repaglinide provides a higher level of treatment
      satisfaction than placebo, and this may in part relate to improved glycaemic
      control.

TI  - Comparison between repaglinide and glimepiride in patients with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus: a one-year, randomized, double-blind assessment of metabolic parameters
      and cardiovascular risk factors.
PG  - 472-84
AB  - BACKGROUND: Repaglinide and glimepiride are relatively new oral hypoglycemic
      agents. Few data are available concerning their effects on metabolic parameters
      other than measures of glycemic control. OBJECTIVES: In addition to assessing the
      effects of repaglinide and glimepiride on glycemic control in patients with type 
      2 diabetes mellitus, this study also examined the effects of these agents on 3
      metabolic parameters known to be cardiovascular risk factors--lipoprotein(a)
      (Lp[a]), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and homocysteine (Hcy).
      METHODS: This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial was conducted at
      a single center in Italy. Eligible patients were nonsmokers; had no hypertension 
      or coronary heart disease; were taking no hypolipidemic drugs, diuretics,
      beta-blockers, or thyroxin; and had normal renal function. After an initial
      4-week placebo washout period, patients were randomized to receive repaglinide 1 
      mg/d or glimepiride 1 mg/d. The dose of study drug was optimized over an 8-week
      titration period, which was followed by a 12-month treatment period. Measures of 
      glycemic control (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c], fasting plasma glucose [FPG],
      postprandial plasma glucose [PPG], fasting plasma insulin [FPI], postprandial
      plasma insulin [PPI]) and the other metabolic parameters of interest were
      assessed after 6 and 12 months of treatment. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-four
      patients (63 women, 61 men) completed the study, 62 in each treatment group.
      There were no significant differences in demographic characteristics between
      groups. After 6 and 12 months of treatment, FPG levels and HbA1c values were
      significantly reduced from baseline in both groups (6 months, P < 0.05; 12
      months, P < 0.01). After 6 months, PPG levels were significantly decreased only
      in the repaglinide group (P < 0.05 vs baseline); at 12 months, however, PPG
      levels were significantly reduced from baseline in both groups (P < 0.01
      repaglinide, P < 0.05 glimepiride). No significant changes from baseline in FPI
      or PPI levels were seen in either group at 6 months, although FPI levels were
      significantly increased in the repaglinide group at 12 months (P < 0.05).
      Repaglinide significantly lowered levels of Lp(a), PAI-1, and Hcy after 12 months
      (all, P < 0.05 vs baseline). Glimepiride significantly lowered levels of Lp(a)
      and Hcy after 6 months (both, P < 0.05 vs baseline) and levels of Lp(a) (P < 0.01
      vs baseline), Hcy (P < 0.01 vs baseline), and PAI-1 (P < 0.05 vs baseline) after 
      12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Repaglinide and glimepiride improved glycemic control and
      reduced levels of other metabolic parameters of interest in this population of
      patients with type 2 diabetes. It is possible that the reductions in Lp(a),
      PAI-1, and Hcy were the result of improved glucose metabolism; however, the
      possibility that repaglinide and glimepiride may have a direct effect on these
      parameters should not be excluded.

TI  - Efficacy and safety profile of glimepiride in Mexican American Patients with type
      2 diabetes mellitus: a randomized, placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 194-209
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mexican Americans, the fastest growing ethnic group in the United
      States, have a 2- to 3-fold higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus
      relative to the non-Hispanic white population. It is estimated that 10% of
      Mexican Americans >or=20 years of age have diabetes. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this 
      study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of glimepiride, a long-acting
      sulfonylurea, as an adjunct to diet/exercise in Mexican Americans with type 2
      diabetes mellitus. METHODS: This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study. Mexican Americans with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes,
      defined as a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level between 120 mg/dL and 225 mg/dL
      and glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) values between 8.0% and 10.5%, after >or=3
      months of diet/exercise were enrolled. Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio
      (using the lowest available treatment assignment number when eligibility was
      established) to receive 14 weeks of glimepiride or matching placebo once daily
      with continued diet/exercise. The starting glimepiride dose was 1 mg, with
      titration to 2 mg and 4 mg for FPG levels >120 mg/dL. The primary efficacy
      variable was change in HbA(1c) from baseline to study end point. Secondary
      efficacy variables were HbA(1c) response (rated as excellent, good, or marginal) 
      and changes in FPG, fasting insulin, fibrinogen, and plasminogen activator
      inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) levels from baseline to study end point. The tolerability of 
      glimepiride in this study population was determined by evaluating adverse events,
      hypoglycemic episodes, and physical examination as well as laboratory findings.
      All analyses were performed on an intent-to-treat basis. A per-protocol analysis 
      also was conducted to support the primary efficacy analysis. RESULTS: Seventy
      patients were randomized to treatment with glimepiride (n = 48) or placebo ((n = 
      22). The glimepiride and placebo groups were similar with respect to mean (SE)
      age (48.4 [11.7] and 50.7 [10.0] years, respectively) and sex (56.3% [27/48] and 
      50.0% [11/22] were male, respectively). However, the glimepiride group had a
      higher mean body weight (83.3 [17.0] vs 76.3 [18.5] kg) and a significantly
      higher mean fasting insulin level (23.8 [17.7] vs 17.8 [19.7] microU/mL; P =
      0.031). The mean (SE) HbA(1c) values at study end point were 7.8% (0.2%) and 9.9%
      (0.7%) in patients receiving glimepiride and placebo, respectively. The adjusted 
      mean difference in HbA(1c) reduction from baseline to end point was statistically
      significant in favor of glimepiride (-1.8% [0.4%]; P < 0.001). More pronounced
      HbA(1c) impairment at baseline was associated with greater glimepiride-placebo
      differences in HbA(1c) reduction. Glimepiride-treated patients also achieved a
      significantly greater improvement in FPG, with an adjusted mean (SE) treatment
      difference of -46.7 (16.7) mg/dL (P = 0.007). Glimepiride did not appear to
      affect fibrinogen and PAI-1 levels but was associated with significantly greater 
      mean increases in fasting insulin (10.2 vs -2.1 microU/mL; P = 0.002) and body
      weight (2.3 vs 2.1 kg; P < 0.001) compared with placebo. Glimepiride was well
      tolerated, with an adverse-event profile similar to that of placebo. CONCLUSIONS:
      These results indicate that once-daily glimepiride plus diet/exercise was
      effective in Mexican Americans with type 2 diabetes whose disease was
      inadequately controlled with diet/exercise alone. It appeared to be well
      tolerated in the population studied. More weight gain was seen with glimepiride
      compared with placebo. Given the high prevalence of type 2 diabetes among Mexican
      Americans, further clinical studies of glimepiride and other glucose-lowering
      therapies are needed in this ethnic subset.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of repaglinide in type 2 diabetic patients with and without
      impaired renal function.
PG  - 886-91
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the influence of renal impairment on the safety and
      efficacy of repaglinide in type 2 diabetic patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS:
      This multinational, open-label study comprised a 6-week run-in period, continuing
      prestudy antidiabetic medication, followed by a titration period (1-4 weeks) and 
      a 3-month maintenance period. Patients with normal renal function (n = 151) and
      various degrees of renal impairment (n = 130) were treated with repaglinide
      (maximal dose of 4 mg, three times daily). Safety and efficacy assessments were
      performed at baseline (end of run-in) and at the end of study treatment. RESULTS:
      The type and severity of adverse events during repaglinide treatment were similar
      to the run-in period. The number of patients with adverse events was not
      significantly related to renal function during run-in or repaglinide treatment.
      Percentage of patients with hypoglycemic episodes increased significantly (P =
      0.007) with increasing severity of renal impairment during run-in but not during 
      repaglinide treatment (P = 0.074). Metabolic control (HbA(1c) and fasting blood
      glucose) with repaglinide was unchanged from that on previous antidiabetic
      medication. Final repaglinide dose tended to be lower for patients with severe
      and extreme renal impairment than for patients with less severe renal impairment 
      or normal renal function (P = 0.032). CONCLUSIONS: Repaglinide has a good safety 
      and efficacy profile in type 2 diabetic patients complicated by renal impairment 
      and is an appropriate treatment choice, even for individuals with more severe
      degrees of renal impairment.

TI  - Treatment of type 2 diabetes: inadequate assessment of oral antidiabetic
      combinations.
PG  - 28-30
AB  - (1) Metformin and glibenclamide are the only oral antidiabetics with a proven
      impact on the complications of type 2 diabetes. (2) Treatment with one of these
      drugs often fails to achieve the recommended target in HbA1c level (below 7%).
      (3) Only one randomised trial has assessed the preventive efficacy of a
      combination of oral antidiabetics when hyperglycaemia persists despite treatment 
      with a glucose-lowering sulphonylurea. The trial showed that combining metformin 
      and a glucose-lowering sulphonylurea is associated with a higher mortality than
      therapy with a sulphonylurea alone. (4) Despite this result, most clinical
      guidelines recommend the metformin + glucose-lowering sulphonylurea combination
      when oral antidiabetic monotherapy fails. (5) In the absence of convincing data
      supporting any particular strategy, all options should be discussed with patients
      including continuing with oral antidiabetic monotherapy, or starting insulin.

TI  - Pharmacotherapy of diabetes mellitus: implications for the prevention and
      treatment of cardiovascular disease.
PG  - 18-33
AB  - Diabetes mellitus in adults is associated with an increased risk of premature
      vascular disease and a higher mortality rate. The presence of other risk factors,
      often seen in diabetic patients, such as systemic hypertension, augments the rate
      of vascular diseases. Evidence is growing that tight control of hyperglycemia
      using insulin and/or oral hypoglycemic agents will modify this risk. More
      aggressive control of concomitant hypertension and/or hyperlipidemia is also
      required. Diabetic patients who have myocardial infarctions do worse than
      nondiabetic patients. Various strategies to improve outcomes include the use of
      tight blood glucose control, and various coronary interventions are currently
      under clinical study.

TI  - Differential effect of glyburide (glibenclamide) and metformin on QT dispersion: 
      a potential adenosine triphosphate sensitive K+ channel effect.
PG  - 1103-6
AB  - Glyburide (glibenclamide) is a specific blocker of the adenosine triphosphate
      (ATP) sensitive potassium (K+) channel. It has been reported to result in
      prolongation of the QT interval. QT interval dispersion (QTd) is a potentially
      sensitive marker for increased risk of arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. The
      aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of glyburide on QTd and
      compare it with that of metformin, a hypoglycemic agent that does not block the
      adenosine triphosphate sensitive K+ channel. Thirty patients with type 2 diabetes
      were randomized to glyburide and metformin groups. A 12-lead electrocardiogram
      was obtained before and at 2 months after being on glyburide or metformin.
      Therapy with QT and QTd were measured and QT corrected for rate (QTc). There was 
      no significant difference between the glyburide and metformin groups in age (62
      +/- 9 vs 59 +/- 10 years), baseline RR interval (819 +/- 86 vs 753 +/- 100 ms),
      QT (387 +/- 28 vs 383 +/- 27 ms), and QTc (433 +/- 25 vs 444 +/- 15 ms).
      Glyburide was associated with a significant increase in QTc (433 +/- 24 to 467
      +/- 24 ms, p <0.001), QTd (24 +/- 16 to 60 +/- 22 ms, p <0.001), and QTc
      dispersion (QTcd) (35 +/- 18 to 68 +/- 21 ms, p <0.001). In contrast, metformin
      was associated with a decrease in QTc (444 +/- 15 to 432 +/- 15 ms, p <0.01) and 
      did not affect QTd (14 +/- 5 to 12 +/- 6 ms, p = NS) and QTcd (23 +/- 9 to 22 +/-
      10 ms, p = NS). Glyburide, unlike metformin, causes an increase in QT dispersion.
      Increased dispersion may be a factor underlying an increased risk of arrhythmias 
      and sudden cardiac death.

TI  - Patient perceptions of prandial oral therapy for type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 669-77
AB  - PURPOSE: This survey was conducted to assess patient perceptions of glycemic
      control, convenience, and flexibility of a prescribed prandial oral therapy for
      type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: Questionnaires distributed by physicians
      yielded baseline responses from 3696 patients who were beginning repaglinide
      treatment. Data were analyzed from 1233 respondents who also completed follow-up 
      questionnaires after 4 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: Among respondents, 60% were
      taking repaglinide with other antidiabetic agents in combination therapy; 59%
      were taking metformin, and 24% were taking troglitazone. Most respondents (84%)
      indicated that they were "satisfied" or "very satisfied" with repaglinide
      therapy, 92% wished to continue its use, and 60% believed that the treatment had 
      improved their attitude toward taking antidiabetic medication. Patients perceived
      that fasting blood glucose levels were reduced during treatment, as was the
      incidence of hyperglycemia. Corresponding changes in perceived frequency of
      hypoglycemia during repaglinide treatment were minimal. CONCLUSIONS: Patient
      perceptions of prandial oral therapy with repaglinide were predominantly
      positive, due mostly to the perception that glucose control was achieved, with
      minimal perception of any increase in hypoglycemic episodes.

TI  - Gliclazide modified release.
PG  - 1357-64; discussion 1365-6
AB  - Gliclazide modified release (MR) is a new formulation of the drug gliclazide and 
      is given once daily. The hydrophilic matrix of hypromellose-based polymer in the 
      new formulation effects a progressive release of the drug which parallels the
      24-hour glycaemic profile in untreated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
      The formulation shows high bioavailability and its absorption profile is
      unaffected by coadministration with food. Mean plasma glucose levels are
      significantly reduced over a 24-hour period in patients with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus treated with gliclazide MR once daily, in both fasting and postprandial 
      states. No cardiovascular ATP-sensitive potassium channel interaction has been
      observed at therapeutic concentrations of gliclazide MR. Gliclazide MR has also
      demonstrated antioxidant properties that are independent of glycaemic control. In
      a randomised, double-blind, multicentre study, gliclazide MR 30 to 120 mg once
      daily showed similar efficacy to gliclazide immediate release (IR) 80 to 320
      mg/day (in divided doses for doses >80 mg) in patients with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus over a 10-month period, reducing glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) and 
      fasting plasma glucose (FPG) to a similar extent. The drug appeared most
      efficacious in patients who had previously been treated by diet alone, where
      significant reductions in HbA(1c) from baseline of 0.9% and 0.95% were seen at 10
      and 24 months. Similarly, a sustained effect of gliclazide MR was observed in a
      subgroup of elderly patients defined a priori; HbA(1c) was decreased to a similar
      degree to that observed in the general study population. Gliclazide MR showed
      similar tolerability to gliclazide IR after 10 months' treatment in the
      randomised trial. The most commonly observed adverse events were arthralgia,
      arthritis, back pain and bronchitis (each <5%). Bodyweight remained stable. In
      this study no episodes of nocturnal hypoglycaemia or hypoglycaemia requiring
      third party assistance were observed during treatment with gliclazide MR.
      Episodes of symptomatic hypoglycaemia were infrequent, occurring in approximately
      5% of patients.

TI  - Nateglinide improves glycaemic control when added to metformin monotherapy:
      results of a randomized trial with type 2 diabetes patients.
PG  - 177-86
AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: This study evaluated the addition of nateglinide, a
      d-phenylalanine derivative that restores early phase insulin release, to
      metformin in type 2 diabetes patients stabilized on high-dose metformin. METHODS:
      This multicentre, double-blind, parallel group trial included 467
      metformin-treated patients with glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) between 6.8% and
      11%. Patients were randomized to add nateglinide 60 mg, 120 mg or placebo before 
      three meals to metformin 1000 mg b.i.d. for 24 weeks. RESULTS: HbA1c was
      significantly reduced with nateglinide 60 mg and 120 mg plus metformin compared
      with metformin control (-0.36%, p = 0.003; -0.59%, p < 0.001 respectively).
      Greater benefits occurred if patients had elevated HbA1c at baseline (-1.38% with
      nateglinide 120 mg in patients with HbA1c > 9.5%). A modest fasting plasma
      glucose reduction was observed. Most symptoms suggestive of hypoglycaemia
      occurred in patients with low HbA1c levels (<or= 8%) at baseline, although no
      confirmed cases of hypoglycaemia occurred with nateglinide 60 mg in this patient 
      group. Events suggestive of hypoglycaemia were confirmed in 1.1% of cases (plasma
      glucose <or= 3.3 mmol/l). Weight gain over 24 weeks was 0.9 kg with nateglinide
      120 mg vs. metformin alone, and plasma lipids remained unchanged.
      CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In patients stabilized on high-dose metformin, the
      addition of nateglinide improved glycaemic control. The combination of these
      agents was well tolerated and both doses of nateglinide proved effective. The
      efficacy of nateglinide 60 mg and the low rate of hypoglycaemia observed at this 
      dose make it suitable for patients close to their therapeutic target on metformin
      monotherapy.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of extended-release glipizide GITS compared
      with immediate-release glipizide in patients with type II diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 651-7
AB  - This study was designed to compare the pharmacokinetic and short-term
      pharmacodynamic profile of extended-release glipizide GITS (Glucotrol XL) given
      in a dosage of 20 mg once daily with that of immediate-release glipizide
      (Glucotrol) 10mg twice daily in patients with type II diabetes mellitus. In an
      open-label, randomized, two-way crossover study, each glipizide formulation was
      administered for 5 days. Serial blood samples were drawn at baseline and on the
      5th day of each treatment phase for measurement of glipizide, glucose, insulin,
      and C-peptide concentrations. At steady state, the mean Cmax after
      immediate-release glipizide was significantly greater than after glipizide GITS, 
      and the tmax was considerably shorter. Although the mean Cmin with glipizide GITS
      was about 80% higher than with immediate-release glipizide, the mean AUC0-24 was 
      significantly lower. Despite the lower plasma concentrations with glipizide GITS 
      in this short-term study, the two formulations had similar effects on serum
      concentrations of glucose, insulin, and C-peptide. The absence of a pronounced
      peak plasma concentration with the GITS formulation might confer advantages in
      terms of maintaining clinical effectiveness and reducing the potential to cause
      adverse effects.

AB  - The persistence and compliance of type 2 diabetic patients to different regimens 
      of anti-hyperglycemic therapy were assessed retrospectively. The pharmacy claims 
      from a pharmacy benefit management organization were analysed from the third
      quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1999. Of the 23,400 patients enrolled
      and initiating anti-diabetic therapy, 85% started treatment with monotherapy,
      9.5% with insulin alone, 4.1% with polytherapy and 1.3% with insulin plus another
      therapy. Monotherapy patients were characterized as receiving metformin,
      sulfonylurea or another agent. For the 1-year follow-up period, 70.5% of the
      metformin patients, 75.3% of the sulfonylurea patients and 86.8% of the
      polytherapy patients underwent no regimen modification (except discontinuation). 
      For the patients who had no modification of their medication regimen, persistence
      with sulfonylurea or metformin monotherapy was 65% greater than with polytherapy 
      over a 1-year period. Compliance with sulfonylurea or metformin monotherapy was
      45% greater than with polytherapy.

TI  - Optimizing insulin secretagogue therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes: a
      randomized double-blind study with repaglinide.
PG  - 342-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Repaglinide, a novel antidiabetic agent that has a rapid onset and
      short duration of action, was developed for mealtime dosing. The purpose of this 
      pharmacodynamic study was to validate a prandial regimen of repaglinide by
      comparing meal-related dosing with a regimen in which the same total daily dose
      was divided into only two doses at morning and evening meals. RESEARCH DESIGN AND
      METHODS: The study was a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group trial in 19
      antidiabetic agent-naive subjects with type 2 diabetes (mean age 58 years, known 
      duration of diabetes 3.5 years, HbA(1c) 7.3%, and BMI 32 kg/m(2)). Patients were 
      randomly assigned to receive repaglinide either before each of the three main
      meals or before breakfast and before the evening meal. Patients in both groups
      received the same total daily dose of repaglinide. Twenty-four hour profiles of
      blood glucose, plasma insulin, and plasma C-peptide concentrations were measured 
      at baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: Repaglinide increased
      postprandial insulin levels and markedly reduced postprandial glucose levels
      relative to baseline in both groups. Significant reductions were also recorded in
      fasting blood glucose and HbA(1c) levels. The repaglinide regimen, in which a
      dose was taken before each main meal, was more effective in improving glycemic
      control (including postprandial glucose and HbA(1c) levels) than the same total
      dose of repaglinide divided into morning and evening mealtime doses. CONCLUSIONS:
      These data support the strategy of mealtime dosing with repaglinide. The
      improvements in glycemic control observed in these patients are encouraging. In
      addition to classic parameters of glycemic control, improvements in postprandial 
      glucose excursions may prove to be important because postprandial hyperglycemia
      has been suggested to be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease in
      diabetes.

TI  - Orlistat: in the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 2107-19; discussion 2120-1
AB  - Orlistat is a nonsystemically acting gastric and pancreatic lipase inhibitor that
      limits the absorption of dietary fat. A retrospective pooled analysis of three
      2-year, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials involving patients
      with obesity revealed that orlistat recipients were more likely to experience an 
      improvement, and less likely to experience a deterioration, in glucose tolerance 
      status than placebo recipients. In comparison with placebo, orlistat recipients
      had significantly greater reductions in glycosylated haemoglobin and fasting
      plasma glucose levels in large, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled
      studies of 24 to 52 weeks' duration involving patients with obesity and type 2
      diabetes mellitus. In one such study, the dosage of concomitant sulphonylureas
      was able to be reduced in more orlistat than placebo recipients (43.2 vs 28.9%), 
      with discontinuation of sulphonylurea therapy achieved in 11.7% of orlistat
      recipients. The most common adverse effects reported in orlistat recipients with 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus relate to the gastrointestinal system and are similar to
      those reported in studies involving patients without type 2 diabetes mellitus.

TI  - Insulinotropic meglitinide analogues.
PG  - 1709-16
AB  - The loss of early-phase insulin secretion is an important and early event in the 
      natural history of type 2 diabetes. Because a normal pattern of insulin secretion
      is essential for the effective control of postprandial metabolism, a rational
      basis for the development of agents that target early-phase insulin release
      exists. Conventional oral hypoglycaemic agents do not target, or adequately
      control, postprandial glycaemia. The emergence of new classes of oral agent with 
      a more specific mode of action provides, for the first time, an opportunity to
      restore early-phase insulin release. One such drug class is the meglitinide
      analogues (repaglinide, nateglinide, and mitiglinide). These drugs are ideally
      suited for combination use with metformin. They could also prove effective in
      combination with a thiazolidinedione, a drug class that targets insulin
      resistance. Exogenous insulin is frequently required in the late management of
      type 2 diabetes. However, one hope for newer combinations of diabetic drugs is
      that the functional life of the beta cell can be extended, thereby delaying the
      need for insulin injections.

TI  - Nateglinide therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 1426-34
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, dosing guidelines,
      adverse effects, drug interactions, and clinical efficacy of nateglinide. DATA
      SOURCES: Primary and review articles regarding nateglinide were identified by
      MEDLINE search (from 1966 to January 2001); abstracts were identified through the
      Institute for Scientific Information Web of Science (from 1995 to January 2001)
      and the American Diabetes Association; additional information was obtained from
      the nateglinide product information. STUDY SELECTION/DATA EXTRACTION: All
      articles and meeting abstracts identified from the data sources were evaluated
      and all information deemed relevant was included in this review. Much of the
      information was from abstracts or the product labeling, since few clinical
      studies have been published in the medical literature. DATA SYNTHESIS:
      Nateglinide is a novel nonsulfonylurea oral antidiabetic agent that stimulates
      insulin secretion from the pancreas. It has a rapid onset and short duration of
      action, allowing administration before a meal to reduce postprandial
      hyperglycemia. Improvement in glycemic control with nateglinide monotherapy has
      been demonstrated in patients not previously treated with antidiabetic
      medications. Greater improvement in glycemic control was observed when
      nateglinide was administered in combination with metformin. CONCLUSIONS:
      Nateglinide is similar to repaglinide, but has a quicker onset of action, quicker
      reversal, and does not usually require dosage titration. Based on the
      pharmacodynamics of nateglinide and repaglinide, nateglinide produces a more
      rapid postprandial increase in insulin secretion, and its duration of response is
      shorter than that of repaglinide. The risk of postabsorptive hypoglycemia should 
      be lower than with either sulfonylureas or repaglinide.

TI  - Effects of sibutramine in obese female subjects with type 2 diabetes and poor
      blood glucose control.
PG  - 1957-60
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of sibutramine in combination
      with hypoglycemic drugs in obese type 2 diabetic women whose glucose levels were 
      poorly regulated. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Female patients with type 2
      diabetes, poorly controlled glucose levels, and HbA(1c) >8% were randomly
      assigned to one of two groups. In addition to their prescribed hypoglycemic
      agents (maximum doses of sulfonylureas and metformin), one group (n = 30)
      received a placebo twice daily for 6 months and the other (n = 30) received
      sibutramine 10 mg b.i.d. for the same period. RESULTS: One patient in the
      sibutramine group was excluded during the study period because of hypertension;
      thus, a total of 29 data sets were analyzed for this group. In the placebo group,
      five patients had to be excluded because of low treatment efficacy, leaving a
      total of 25 who completed the study. Comparing the changes that occurred over 6
      months in the sibutramine and placebo groups, the former showed significantly
      greater reductions in fasting blood glucose (P < 0.0001), second-hour
      postprandial blood glucose (P < 0.0001), insulin resistance (P < 0.0001), waist
      circumference (P < 0.0001), BMI (P < 0.0001), HbA(1c) (P < 0.0001), diastolic
      blood pressure, pulse rate, uric acid levels, and all elements of the lipid
      profile except HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1. CONCLUSIONS: The addition
      of sibutramine to oral hypoglycemic therapy resulted in significant weight loss
      and improvement in metabolic parameters in this patient group. Sibutramine is an 
      effective adjunct to oral hypoglycemic therapy in obese women with type 2

TI  - Improved glycaemic control by addition of glimepiride to metformin monotherapy in
      type 2 diabetic patients.
PG  - 828-34
AB  - AIM: To compare the effect of glimepiride in combination with metformin with
      monotherapy of each drug on glycaemic control in Type 2 diabetic patients. DESIGN
      AND METHODS: Randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group multicentre
      study conducted in France. Type 2 diabetic patients aged 35-70 years inadequately
      controlled by metformin monotherapy 2550 mg daily for at least 4 weeks were
      randomized to either metformin, glimepiride or metformin and glimepiride.
      RESULTS: Three hundred and seventy-two patients aged 56 +/- 8 years were treated 
      for 5 months. Combination treatment was significantly more efficient in
      controlling HbA1c (% change + 0.07 +/- 1.20 for metformin, + 0.27 +/- 1.10 for
      glimepiride, -0.74 +/- 0.96 for combination treatment, P < 0.001), fasting blood 
      glucose (FBG) (mmol/l change + 0.8 +/- 0.4 for metformin, + 0.7 +/- 3.1 for
      glimepiride and -1.8 +/- 2.2 for combination treatment, P < 0.001) and
      post-prandial blood glucose (PPBG) (mmol/l change + 1.1 +/- 5.9 for metformin, + 
      0.1 +/- 5.1 for glimepiride and -2.6 +/- 3.9 for combination treatment, P <
      0.001) than either glimepiride or metformin alone. There was no significant
      difference between metformin or glimepiride monotherapy with respect to the
      change in HbA1c or FBG; however, glimepiride was significantly more effective
      than metformin in reducing PPBG. The incidence of symptomatic hypoglycaemia was
      higher in the combination group than in either monotherapy group (P = 0.039).
      CONCLUSIONS: Addition of glimepiride to metformin in Type 2 diabetic patients
      inadequately controlled by metformin alone resulted in superior glycaemic control
      compared with glimepiride or metformin monotherapy.

TI  - Glibenclamide improves postprandial hypertriglyceridaemia in type 2 diabetic
      patients by reducing chylomicrons but not the very low-density lipoprotein
      subfraction levels.
PG  - 781-5
AB  - AIM: There are scarce data dealing with the degree of postprandial lipaemia after
      sulphonylurea administration. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of 
      acute glibenclamide administration on postprandial lipaemia in Type 2 diabetic
      patients. METHODS: Eight randomly selected Type 2 diabetic individuals, aged
      43-65 years (mean, 54 years), who had never received any anti-diabetic drug, were
      included in the study. Each patient was given a 485 kcal mixed meal (45% fat, 40%
      carbohydrate and 15% protein) twice on separate days after an overnight fast:
      once with placebo and once with 5 mg glibenclamide, per os, in a random order.
      The two tests were performed with an interval of 7 days. Venous blood samples
      were drawn just before and 2 h, 4 h and 6 h after meal consumption. Total
      triglyceride levels in plasma, in chylomicrons (CM), in CM-deficient plasma, in
      very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) subfractions (VLDL-1, VLDL-2) and in
      intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) were determined. Free fatty acid (FFA) and
      total cholesterol levels in plasma, as well as high-density lipoprotein (HDL)
      cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels in CM-deficient 
      plasma, were also measured. Finally, serum glucose, insulin and C-peptide
      concentrations were measured in each sample. RESULTS: As expected there was a
      significant decrease in postprandial glycaemia after glibenclamide administration
      compared to placebo (mean area under the curve values: AUC = 53.3 +/- 18.2 and
      69.1 +/- 21.6 mm/h, P = 0.00009). In addition, the mean AUC values of insulin and
      C-peptide were significantly greater after drug administration. The AUC values of
      total plasma triglyceride and of CM triglyceride following glibenclamide
      administration were significantly lower compared to placebo, while the AUC values
      of postprandial triglyceride in CM-deficient plasma and of postprandial
      triglyceride in VLDL-1, VLDL-2 and IDL were not different after drug
      administration compared to placebo. Finally, no significant differences were
      noted in the AUC values of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol
      and plasma FFA levels after glibenclamide administration. CONCLUSIONS: These
      results demonstrate that glibenclamide administration improves postprandial
      hypertriglyceridaemia acutely by reducing postprandial triglycerides of
      intestinal origin.

TI  - Nateglinide: a new rapid-acting insulinotropic agent.
PG  - 1027-31
AB  - The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study has shown that tight glycaemic
      control significantly reduces microvascular complications in Type 2 diabetes, but
      the effects on macrovascular complications were less impressive and did not reach
      statistical significance. Epidemiological studies have shown that post-prandial
      hyperglycaemia, rather than fasting hyperglycaemia, is more closely related to
      cardiovascular complications. It is, therefore, possible that previous studies
      may have overlooked the possible benefits of tight control of post-prandial
      hyperglycaemia as an important factor in reducing the cardiovascular mortality.
      Nateglinide is a novel D-phenylalanine derivative that inhibits ATP-sensitive K+ 
      channels in pancreatic beta-cells in the presence of glucose and thereby restores
      first phase insulin response in patients with Type 2 diabetes. This helps in
      reducing post-prandial glucose excursion. Combination studies with metformin have
      shown it to be effective in controlling hyperglycaemia. While metformin reduces
      the basal plasma glucose, nateglinide helps in controlling post-prandial peaks.
      Nateglinide provides a new therapeutic option for treating Type 2 diabetes by
      specifically targeting post-prandial hyperglycaemia.

TI  - Repaglinide: a review of its therapeutic use in type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 1625-60
AB  - Repaglinide, a carbamoylmethyl benzoic acid derivative, is the first of a new
      class of oral antidiabetic agents designed to normalise postprandial glucose
      excursions in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Like the sulphonylureas,
      repaglinide reduces blood glucose by stimulating insulin release from pancreatic 
      beta-cells, but differs from these and other antidiabetic agents in its
      structure, binding profile, duration of action and mode of excretion. In clinical
      trials of up to 1-year's duration, repaglinide maintained or improved glycaemic
      control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In comparative, 1-year,
      double-blind, randomised trials (n = 256 to 544), patients receiving repaglinide 
      (0.5 to 4mg before 3 daily meals) achieved similar glycaemic control to that in
      patients receiving glibenclamide (glyburide) < or = 15 mg/day and greater control
      than patients receiving glipizide < or = 15 mg/day. Changes from baseline in
      glycosylated haemoglobin and fasting blood glucose levels were similar between
      patients receiving repaglinide and glibenclamide in all studies; however,
      repaglinide was slightly better than glibenclamide in reducing postprandial blood
      glucose in I short term study (n = 192). Patients can vary their meal timetable
      with repaglinide: the glucose-lowering efficacy of repaglinide was similar for
      patients consuming 2, 3 or 4 meals a day. Repaglinide showed additive effects
      when used in combination with other oral antidiabetic agents including metformin,
      troglitazone, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, and intermediate-acting insulin
      (NPH) given at bedtime. In 1-year trials, the most common adverse events reported
      in repaglinide recipients (n = 1,228) were hypoglycaemia (16%), upper respiratory
      tract infection (10%), rhinitis (7%), bronchitis (6%) and headache (9%). The
      overall incidence of hypoglycaemia was similar to that recorded in patients
      receiving glibenclamide, glipizide or gliclazide (n = 597) [18%]; however, the
      incidence of serious hypoglycaemia appears to be slightly higher in sulphonylurea
      recipients. Unlike glibenclamide, the risk of hypoglycaemia in patients receiving
      repaglinide was not increased when a meal was missed in 1 trial. In conclusion,
      repaglinide is a useful addition to the other currently available treatments for 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus. Preprandial repaglinide has displayed
      antihyperglycaemic efficacy at least equal to that of various sulphonylureas and 
      is associated with a reduced risk of serious hypoglycaemia. It is well tolerated 
      in a wide range of patients, including the elderly, even if a meal is missed.
      Furthermore, glycaemic control is improved when repaglinide is used in
      combination with metformin. Thus, repaglinide should be considered for use in any
      patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose blood glucose cannot be controlled by
      diet or exercise alone, or as an adjunct in patients whose glucose levels are
      inadequately controlled on metformin alone.

TI  - Insulin and glucose excursion following premeal insulin lispro or repaglinide in 
      cystic fibrosis-related diabetes.
PG  - 1706-10
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Insulin and glucose levels in response to premeal insulin lispro or
      repaglinide were evaluated in adult patients with cystic fibrosis-related
      diabetes (CFRD) without fasting hyperglycemia. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Seven
      patients with CFRD were fed 1,000-kcal liquid mixed meals. Three study conditions
      were administered in random order on separate mornings: 1) no premeal diabetes
      medication, 2) insulin lispro, 0.1 unit/kg body wt premeal and 3) repaglinide 1
      mg premeal. Glucose and insulin levels were measured every 20 min for 5 h.
      RESULTS: Fasting insulin and glucose levels were normal in patients with CFRD,
      but the peak glucose level was elevated. Insulin lispro significantly decreased
      the peak glucose level (P = 0.0004) and the 2-h (P = 0.001) and 5-h (P < 0.0001) 
      glucose area under the curve (AUC). Repaglinide significantly decreased the 5-h
      glucose AUC (P = 0.03). Neither drug completely normalized cystic fibrosis
      glucose excursion at the doses used for this study. Insulin lispro significantly 
      increased the 5-h insulin AUC (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: In response to
      subcutaneous insulin lispro, postprandial glucose excursion was significantly
      diminished and insulin secretion was enhanced compared with a control meal in
      which no medication was given to patients with CFRD. The oral agent repaglinide
      resulted in lesser corrections in these parameters. Neither drug completely
      normalized glucose or insulin levels, suggesting that the doses chosen for this
      study were suboptimal. Placebo-controlled longitudinal studies comparing the
      effectiveness of repaglinide and insulin on glucose metabolic control as well as 
      overall nutrition and body weight are needed to help determine optimal medical
      treatment of CFRD.

TI  - The effect of food on the oral bioavailability and the pharmacodynamic actions of
      the insulinotropic agent nateglinide in healthy subjects.
PG  - 172-9
AB  - Nateglinide (Starlix, SDZ DJN 608 or A-4166), a new insulinotropic agent, is
      intended to be administered prior to a meal in order to improve early insulin
      release in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients. The effects of a
      meal on the oral bioavailability and pharmacodynamic actions of nateglinide were 
      investigated. Twelve healthy male subjects completed this randomized,
      single-dose, four-way crossover study in which each subject received a 60 mg dose
      of nateglinide 10 minutes before the start of and immediately after a high-fat
      breakfast meal. In addition, each subject received a single 30 and 60 mg dose of 
      nateglinide underfasting conditions. Plasma and urine concentrations of
      nateglinide were determined by an HPLC method while plasma glucose and insulin
      concentrations were measured by standard immunoassay methods. Compared to the
      fasted state, administration of nateglinide 10 minutes before the meal was
      associated with an increase in the rate of absorption (12% increase in Cmax and
      52% decrease in tmax), while there was no significant effect on the extent of
      absorption (AUC). Alternatively, when nateglinide was given after the meal, a
      food effect was observed that was characterized by a decrease in the rate of
      absorption: 34% decrease in Cmax and a 22% increase in tmax but no significant
      effect on AUC. Nateglinide was rapidly eliminated with plasma t 1/2 = 1.4 hours. 
      Its plasma renal clearance, 20.7 ml/min, appears to be due mostly to active
      tubular secretion. However, only 13% to 14% of the dose is recovered as
      nateglinide in the urine. The 30 and 60 mg tablets were dose proportional in
      terms of both AUC and Cmax; both tmax and t 1/2 were dose independent. Regardless
      of timing, the combination of a meal and nateglinide produced a larger increase
      in insulin levels than did nateglinide alone. Meal-related glucose excursions
      were eliminated when nateglinide was taken prior to the meal. Thus, the rapid
      onset/short duration stimulation of insulin release by nateglinide should allow
      good control of prandial hyperglycemia while limiting exposure to
      hyperinsulinemia.

TI  - Beta-cell function evaluated by HOMA as a predictor of secondary sulphonylurea
      failure in Type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 584-8
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Secondary failure to oral hypoglycaemic agents, a common
      evolution of long-standing Type 2 diabetes, is usually assessed by
      non-standardized indices requiring fine clinical assessment, including
      hyperglycaemia resistant to maximum doses of sulphonylureas despite appropriate
      diet and follow-up. The goal of this study was to evaluate if HOMA, a modelized
      plasma insulin/glucose ratio allowing simple evaluation of residual insulin
      secretion and sensitivity, is a better predictor of the insulin requiring stage
      than clinical indices. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HOMA was measured in 84 Type 2
      diabetic patients aged 58 +/- SD 6 years, with diabetes duration 11 +/- 4 years, 
      hospitalized because of hyperglycaemia resistant to maximal doses of
      sulphonylureas (e.g. glibenclamide > or = 15 mg/day), with no apparent external
      reason for hyperglycaemia. Despite reinforced appropriate diet recommendations,
      62 of these patients remained hyperglycaemic (insulin-requiring group). RESULTS: 
      Age, duration of diabetes, body mass index (BMI) and HOMA value for insulin
      sensitivity (71 +/- 6% vs. 76 +/- 7%, normal values 59-161%) were comparable in
      the two groups. HbA(1c) was higher (10.0 +/- 0.2% vs. 8.3 +/- 0.3%, P < 0.001)
      and HOMA insulin secretion values lower (25 +/- 2% vs. 43 +/- 6%, normal values
      70-150%, P < 0.01) in the insulin-requiring group. Of the following potential
      predictors: HbA(1c) > 8%, duration of diabetes > or = 10 years, HbA(1c) combined 
      with diabetes duration, insulin sensitivity < or = 40%, insulin secretion < or = 
      20%, the latter showed the best positive predictivity (86% patients with low
      insulin secretion were insulin-requiring). CONCLUSIONS: (i) HOMA is a simple and 
      good predictor of the insulin-requiring stage in Type 2 diabetes mellitus; (ii)
      this stage of diabetes is characterized by a further decline of insulin secretion
      rather than of insulin sensitivity. Diabet. Med. 18, 584-588 (2001)

TI  - Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and dose-response relationship of repaglinide
      in type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 247-56
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pharmacodynamics and dose-response relationship of repaglinide, a
      novel oral hypoglycemic agent, were evaluated in steady-state treatment of
      patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Efficacy of repaglinide (0.25 mg, 0.5 mg,
      1 mg, 2 mg, and 4 mg) was compared to that of placebo in a double-blind,
      randomized, parallel-group, 4-week dose-response clinical trial in 143 patients. 
      Repaglinide was administered 15 minutes before meals (breakfast, lunch, and
      dinner). Efficacy of repaglinide therapy was assessed by measuring changes from
      baseline in mean levels of blood glucose (BGmean), fasting serum glucose (FSG),
      and mean levels of serum insulin (INSmean). RESULTS: Blood concentrations of
      repaglinide were proportional to the dose administered. INSmean values increased 
      in all repaglinide treatment groups (by 6.7 to 12.9 microU/mL). All doses of
      repaglinide significantly decreased values of BGmean and FSG as compared with the
      placebo group. BGmean values stabilized between the second and third week of
      repaglinide treatment. A well-defined dose-response relationship was observed for
      BGmean and FSG values. All doses of repaglinide were well tolerated, and there
      were no serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that the
      therapeutic reduction of serum glucose levels produced by repaglinide is
      dose-dependent for the 0.25- to 4-mg dose range. All doses of repaglinide tested 
      were effective and well tolerated in patients with type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Utilization of oral hypoglycemic agents in a drug-insured U.S. population.
PG  - 1411-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Clinical trials provide information regarding the safety and efficacy 
      of medications used to manage type 2 diabetes but do not elucidate drug
      effectiveness in a typical managed care environment. The aim of this study was to
      characterize "real-world" drug utilization patterns from both a prescriber and a 
      patient perspective. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective
      analysis of a large administrative pharmacy claims database, using data on
      continuously pharmacy benefit-eligible members prescribed oral hypoglycemic
      agents (OHAs). RESULTS: The 12-month persistence rate for the OHA cohort was low,
      ranging from 31% for alpha-glucosidase inhibitors to 60% for metformin;
      compliance rates varied between 70 and 80%. During the first 12 months of
      therapy, 36% of the patients remaining on therapy at 12 months had one or more
      therapy modifications. The mean number of therapy changes increased with the
      length of patient follow-up, with more than half of all patients experiencing at 
      least one therapy change over the duration of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: These
      findings document the wide variation in utilization patterns associated with
      pharmacological management of type 2 diabetes, suggesting that opportunity exists
      to optimize its pharmacological management.

TI  - Acute and short-term administration of a sulfonylurea (gliclazide) increases
      pulsatile insulin secretion in type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 1778-84
AB  - The high-frequency oscillatory pattern of insulin release is disturbed in type 2 
      diabetes. Although sulfonylurea drugs are widely used for the treatment of this
      disease, their effect on insulin release patterns is not well established. The
      aim of the present study was to assess the impact of acute treatment and 5 weeks 
      of sulfonylurea (gliclazide) treatment on insulin secretory dynamics in type 2
      diabetic patients. To this end, 10 patients with type 2 diabetes (age 53 +/- 2
      years, BMI 27.5 +/- 1.1 kg/m(2), fasting plasma glucose 9.8 +/- 0.8 mmol/l,
      HbA(1c) 7.5 +/- 0.3%) were studied in a double-blind placebo-controlled
      prospective crossover design. Patients received 40-80 mg gliclazide/placebo twice
      daily for 5 weeks with a 6-week washout period intervening. Insulin pulsatility
      was assessed by 1-min interval blood sampling for 75 min 1) under baseline
      conditions (baseline), 2) 3 h after the first dose (80 mg) of gliclazide (acute) 
      with the plasma glucose concentration clamped at the baseline value, 3) after 5
      weeks of treatment (5 weeks), and 4) after 5 weeks of treatment with the plasma
      glucose concentration clamped during the sampling at the value of the baseline
      assessment (5 weeks-elevated). Serum insulin concentration time series were
      analyzed by deconvolution, approximate entropy (ApEn), and spectral and
      autocorrelation methods to quantitate pulsatility and regularity. The P values
      given are gliclazide versus placebo; results are means +/- SE. Fasting plasma
      glucose was reduced after gliclazide treatment (baseline vs. 5 weeks: gliclazide,
      10.0 +/- 0.9 vs. 7.8 +/- 0.6 mmol/l; placebo, 10.0 +/- 0.8 vs. 11.0 +/- 0.9
      mmol/l, P = 0.001). Insulin secretory burst mass was increased (baseline vs.
      acute: gliclazide, 43.0 +/- 12.0 vs. 61.0 +/- 17.0 pmol. l(-1). pulse(-1);
      placebo, 36.1 +/- 8.4 vs. 30.3 +/- 7.4 pmol. l(-1). pulse(-1), P = 0.047; 5
      weeks-elevated: gliclazide vs. placebo, 49.7 +/- 13.3 vs. 37.1 +/- 9.5 pmol.
      l(-1). pulse(-1), P < 0.05) with a similar rise in burst amplitude. Basal (i.e., 
      nonoscillatory) insulin secretion also increased (baseline vs. acute: gliclazide,
      8.5 +/- 2.2 vs. 16.7 +/- 4.3 pmol. l(-1). pulse(-1); placebo, 5.9 +/- 0.9 vs. 7.2
      +/- 0.9 pmol. l(-1). pulse(-1), P = 0.03; 5 weeks-elevated: gliclazide vs.
      placebo, 12.2 +/- 2.5 vs. 9.4 +/- 2.1 pmol. l(-1). pulse(-1), P = 0.016). The
      frequency and regularity of insulin pulses were not modified significantly by the
      antidiabetic therapy. There was, however, a correlation between individual values
      for the acute improvement of regularity, as measured by ApEn, and the decrease in
      fasting plasma glucose during short-term (5-week) gliclazide treatment (r = 0.74,
      P = 0.014, and r = 0.77, P = 0.009, for fine and coarse ApEn, respectively). In
      conclusion, the sulfonylurea agent gliclazide augments insulin secretion by
      concurrently increasing pulse mass and basal insulin secretion without changing
      secretory burst frequency or regularity. The data suggest a possible relationship
      between the improvement in short-term glycemic control and the acute improvement 
      of regularity of the in vivo insulin release process.

TI  - Comparison between repaglinide and glipizide in Type 2 diabetes mellitus: a
      1-year multicentre study.
PG  - 395-401
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the long-term effectiveness and safety of repaglinide, a novel 
      prandial glucose regulator, in comparison with glipizide in the treatment of
      patients with Type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Diet or tablet-treated patients with Type
      2 diabetes (n = 256; age 40-75 years, body mass index (BMI) 20-35 kg/m2, HbA1c
      4.2-12.8%), without signs of severe microvascular or macrovascular complications,
      were included in this double-blind, multicentre, parallel-group comparative
      trial. Patients were randomized at a 2:1 ratio to repaglinide, 1-4 mg at
      mealtimes, or glipizide, 5-15 mg daily. RESULTS: Changes in fasting blood glucose
      (FBG) and HbA1c during the 12 months of treatment showed a significant difference
      in favour of repaglinide. In oral hypoglycaemic agents (OHA)-naive patients,
      HbA1c decreased in the repaglinide and glipizide groups by 1.5% and 0.3%,
      respectively (P < 0.05 between groups). Fasting blood glucose decreased in the
      repaglinide group by 2.4 mmol/l and increased in the glipizide group by 1.0
      mmol/l (P < 0.05 between groups). In the study population as a whole, repaglinide
      was able to maintain glycaemic control (HbA1c level) during the 1-year study
      period, whereas control deteriorated significantly with glipizide. Change in
      HbA1c from baseline was significantly better with repaglinide than with glipizide
      after 12 months (P < 0.05). In addition, FBG deteriorated significantly in the
      glipizide group compared with the repaglinide group (P < 0.05). No patients in
      either group experienced a major hypoglycaemic event; the number of patients
      experiencing minor hypoglycaemia was similar in the repaglinide and glipizide
      groups (15% and 19%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Repaglinide, given as a prandial
      glucose regulator, is shown to be an effective and safe treatment of patients
      with Type 2 diabetes, and is better than glipizide in controlling HbA1c and FBG
      levels, overall, and in OHA-naive patients.

TI  - Nateglinide.
PG  - 1200-5
AB  - The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse effects,
      interactions, and dosage of nateglinide are reviewed. Nateglinide is an oral
      hypoglycemic agent approved for use alone or in combination with metformin as an 
      adjunct to diet and exercise for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
      Nateglinide, an amino acid derivative of D-phenylalanine, stimulates the
      secretion of insulin by binding to the ATP potassium channels in pancreatic beta 
      cells. The result is an increase in beta-cell calcium influx, which leads to
      rapid, short-lived insulin release. The drug is rapidly and completely absorbed
      in the small intestine. The estimated bioavailability is 72%. Nateglinide is
      highly bound to plasma proteins, is metabolized extensively by the liver, and has
      an elimination half-life of 1.4 hours. Several clinical trials of nateglinide,
      alone and in combination with other oral hypoglycemic agents, have found the drug
      to be safe, effective, and well tolerated. The most common adverse effects are
      nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, and lightheadedness. There is a potential for
      interactions between nateglinide and medications affected by the cytochrome P-450
      isoenzyme system. Dosage regimens ranging from 60 to 240 mg have been evaluated. 
      The maximum effective dosage is 120 mg taken 10 minutes before meals three times 
      a day. Nateglinide is an alternative to second-generation sulfonylureas for the
      treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Additional comparative trials are needed
      to fully elucidate nateglinide's role.

TI  - Randomized dose ranging study of the reduction of fasting and postprandial
      glucose in type 2 diabetes by nateglinide (A-4166).
PG  - 1221-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This randomized crossover double-blind placebo-controlled study aimed 
      to assess the efficacy of nateglinide (A-4166), a novel phenylalanine-derived
      insulin secretagogue, in type 2 diabetic subjects while fasting and 5 min before 
      a standard meal. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A single dose of nateglinide (60,
      120, or 180 mg) or placebo was given to eight diet-treated overnight-fasted type 
      2 diabetic patients and to seven patients 5 min before a standard breakfast.
      Plasma glucose, radioimmunoassay insulin, and nateglinide were measured at
      baseline and for a further 180 min. RESULTS: The time-averaged 180-min postdose
      mean decrease in fasting plasma glucose concentration was greater after
      nateglinide (1.8 mmol/l; 95% CI 1.5-2.0) than after placebo (0.7 mmol/l; 95% CI
      0.3-1.2) (P < 0.001). Hypoglycemia did not develop in any of the subjects.
      Insulin concentrations increased 1.5-, 1.8-, and 1.9-fold with the 60-, 120-, and
      180-mg doses, respectively (P < 0.001), peaking approximately 30 min after the
      dose. Nateglinide concentrations peaked after approximately 30 min, decreasing to
      21% of peak by 180 min. In the meal test, the mean increase (2.9 mmol/l, 2.3-3.6)
      in plasma glucose over 180 min after placebo was reduced by 1.8 mmol/l (P <
      0.001) with the two higher doses of nateglinide. CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of
      nateglinide administered to diet-treated type 2 diabetic patients with fasting
      hyperglycemia increased insulin secretion and reduced fasting glucose without
      hypoglycemia. Administered 5 min before a meal, nateglinide reduced the
      postprandial glucose excursion by 64%. With its rapid onset and short duration of
      action, nateglinide is a promising oral prandial therapy in type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Matching treatment to pathophysiology in type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 646-59; discussion 645
AB  - BACKGROUND: Because type 2 diabetes is a progressive condition, >50% of all
      patients whose disease is initially controlled with diet and exercise will
      eventually need single or multiple pharmacologic agents to maintain adequate
      glycemic control. Although current treatment standards require that combination
      therapy be instituted only after the failure of monotherapy, the results of the
      Diabetes Control and Complications Trial and the United Kingdom Prospective
      Diabetes Study suggest that aggressive initial treatment is crucial to slowing
      the evolution of long-term complications associated with this disease.
      OBJECTIVES: This article reviews the diagnosis and classification of type 2
      diabetes, describes the multiple defects in glucose metabolism associated with
      the disease, and discusses the various pharmacologic options for achieving
      glycemic control in these patients. METHODS: The information in this review was
      compiled through a search of MEDLINE. Search terms included but were not limited 
      to type 2 diabetes and antihyperglycemic agents. In addition, abstracts were
      identified using the Web sites of diabetes-related professional organizations.
      RESULTS: Two pathophysiologic mechanisms, insulin resistance and impaired insulin
      secretion, are usually present at diagnosis in type 2 diabetes. Several studies
      have shown that combination therapy with antihyperglycemic agents having
      different mechanisms of action provides greater efficacy than treatment with
      single agents. CONCLUSIONS: Current research suggests that early aggressive
      treatment with combination therapy achieves glycemic control at lower doses and
      with fewer side effects than monotherapy with either component.

TI  - Importance of early insulin secretion: comparison of nateglinide and glyburide in
      previously diet-treated patients with type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 983-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study compared the effects of nateglinide, glyburide, and placebo
      on postmeal glucose excursions and insulin secretion in previously diet-treated
      patients with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study was conducted in 152 patients 
      who received either nateglinide (120 mg before three meals daily, n = 51),
      glyburide (5 mg q.d. titrated to 10 mg q.d. after 2 weeks, n = 50), or placebo (n
      = 51) for 8 weeks. Glucose, insulin, and C-peptide profiles during liquid meal
      challenges were measured at weeks 0 and 8. At weeks -1 and 7, 19-point daytime
      glucose and insulin profiles, comprising three solid meals, were measured.
      RESULTS: During the liquid-meal challenge, nateglinide reduced the incremental
      glucose area under the curve (AUC) more effectively than glyburide ( = -4.94 vs. 
      -2.71 mmol. h/l, P < 0.05), whereas glyburide reduced fasting plasma glucose more
      effectively than nateglinide ( = -2.9 vs. -1.0 mmol/l, respectively, P < 0.001). 
      In contrast, C-peptide induced by glyburide was greater than that induced by
      nateglinide ( = +1.83 vs. +0.95 nmol. h/l, P < 0.01), and only glyburide
      increased fasting insulin levels. During the solid meal challenges, nateglinide
      and glyburide elicited similar overall glucose control ( 12-h incremental AUC =
      -13.2 vs. -15.3 mmol. h/l), but the insulin AUC induced by nateglinide was
      significantly less than that induced by glyburide ( 12-h AUC = +866 vs. +1,702
      pmol. h/l, P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that nateglinide
      selectively enhanced early insulin release and provided better mealtime glucose
      control with less total insulin exposure than glyburide.

TI  - Hemodynamic, metabolic and hormonal responses to oral glibenclamide in patients
      with cirrhosis receiving glucose.
PG  - 303-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: In patients with cirrhosis, glucose may induce splanchnic and renal
      vasodilation. Since the antidiabetic sulfonylurea glibenclamide is known to
      induce splanchnic and renal vasoconstriction in portal hypertensive animals, this
      drug may inhibit glucose-induced hemodynamic responses in patients with
      cirrhosis. The aim of the present study was to investigate, in patients with
      cirrhosis, the short-term effects of glibenclamide on hemodynamic and humoral
      responses to glucose. METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 
      glibenclamide (5-mg tablet) or a placebo. All patients received an infusion of
      10% glucose (62.5 ml/h for 12 h) that was started at the same time as
      glibenclamide or placebo administration. Studies were performed prior to and 90
      min after glibenclamide or placebo. RESULTS: Glibenclamide (i.e. glibenclamide
      plus glucose) significantly increased plasma insulin concentrations and glycemia 
      while placebo (i.e. glucose alone) significantly increased glycemia but did not
      change plasma insulin levels. Glibenclamide did not significantly change the
      hepatic venous pressure gradient while this value was significantly increased
      following glucose alone. Glibenclamide did not significantly change renal blood
      flow and glomerular filtration rate while glucose alone significantly increased
      renal blood flow without affecting the glomerular filtration rate. Glibenclamide 
      significantly decreased cardiac index while glucose alone did not change this
      value. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with cirrhosis receiving glucose, glibenclamide
      blunted glucose-induced splanchnic and renal vasodilation. In addition,
      glibenclamide per se induced a decrease in cardiac index. These findings should
      be taken into account when glibenclamide is administered to patients with
      cirrhosis and type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Management of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the elderly: special considerations.
PG  - 31-44
AB  - The principles of managing type 2 diabetes mellitus in the elderly are no
      different from those in younger patients, but the priorities and therapeutic
      strategies need to be cautiously individualised. The objectives of treatment are 
      to improve glycaemic control in a stepwise approach that involves
      nonpharmacological methods including diet and exercise, and pharmacological
      therapy including mixtures of oral antihyperglycaemic agents alone or in
      combination with insulin. Although the goals of treatment may be the same for
      elderly and younger patients, certain aspects of type 2 diabetes in the elderly
      require special consideration. Treatment decisions are influenced by age and life
      expectancy, comorbid conditions and severity of the vascular complications.
      Adherence to dietary therapy, physical activity, and medication regimens may be
      compromised by comorbid conditions and psychosocial limitations. Drug-induced
      hypoglycaemia has been the main consideration and the most serious potential
      complication. In addition, the long term macrovascular and microvascular
      complications of type 2 diabetes are a source of significant morbidity and
      mortality. Indeed, vascular and neuropathic complications are already present at 
      the time of diagnosis in a significant number of patients, and the impact of
      improved diabetes control depends on the age and life expectancy of the patient. 
      Age-related changes in pharmacokinetics and the potential for adverse effects and
      drug interactions should also be considered when choosing appropriate
      pharmacological therapy. In general, a conservative and stepwise approach to the 
      treatment of the elderly patient with type 2 diabetes is suggested; treatment may
      be initiated with monotherapy, followed by early intervention with a combination 
      of oral agents including a sulphonylurea as a foundation insulin secretagogue in 
      addition to a supplemental insulin sensitiser. Insulin therapy is eventually
      required if significant hyperglycaemia [glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) >8%]
      persists despite oral combination therapy. Combination therapy with evening
      insulin and a long-acting sulphonylurea such as glimepiride is an effective
      strategy to improve hyperglycaemia in the elderly patient with type 2 diabetes in
      whom polypharmacy with oral agents is unsuccessful. In addition, such a regimen
      is simple to follow for the patient who may not be able to adhere to a more
      complicated insulin regimen. Hyperglycaemia in the elderly can be managed well
      with practical intervention and a straightforward treatment plan to enhance
      compliance. Optimal glycaemic control should be possible for every patient if
      treatment is individualised; however, strict glycaemic control may not be
      achievable in all patients or even desirable in many elderly patients.

TI  - Effects and pharmacokinetics of oral glibenclamide and glipizide in Caucasian and
      Chinese patients with type-2 diabetes.
PG  - 711-4
AB  - The effects and kinetics of oral glibenclamide (Gb) and glipizide (Gz) were
      studied in Caucasian and Chinese patients (ten in each group) with type-2
      diabetes. In randomised order, 2.5 mg Gb, 2.5 mg Gz or placebo was given orally
      before the administration of 75 g oral glucose. Concentrations of insulin and
      proinsulin were determined using radioimmunoassay (RIA) without
      cross-reactivities, and sulphonylurea concentrations were determined using
      high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). There were no significant
      interethnic differences in Gb or Gz effects whether on glucose, insulin or
      proinsulin/insulin ratio at any time point. Following Gz, however, Chinese
      patients had greater increments of serum proinsulin at 10-30 min compared with
      Caucasians. Apart from the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the
      plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of Gz being higher among the Chinese, no
      significant interethnic differences in pharmacokinetics were found. It appears
      that the same dosage principles could be used for Caucasian and Chinese patients 
      with type-2 diabetes when Gb or Gz are prescribed.

TI  - Impairment of early insulin response after glucose load, rather than insulin
      resistance, is responsible for postprandial hyperglycemia seen in obese type 2
      diabetes: assessment using nateglinide, a new insulin secretagogue.
PG  - 639-41
AB  - The insulin secretory pattern as a phenotype of type 2 diabetes is an impairment 
      in the rapid, pulsatile secretion of insulin in response to a rise in blood
      glucose after meal-intake. The restoration of endogenous rapid insulin secretion 
      after oral glucose load was established for the first time by using nateglinide, 
      which is a newly developed insulin secretagogue, in obese patients with type 2
      diabetes mellitus. It was clearly demonstrated that with nateglinide, serum
      insulin levels were quickly raised, and glycemic response curves were almost
      normalized with the same amount of insulin secretion during 180 min. Therefore,
      the lack of rapid, pulsatile secretion of insulin in response to glycemic rise
      after oral glucose load, rather than insulin resistance, is responsible for
      postprandial glycemic response in obese type 2 diabetes patients.

TI  - Beneficial and detrimental effects of intensive glycaemic control, with emphasis 
      on type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 463-76
AB  - Diabetes mellitus is a major health problem in the world. Several clinical trials
      have shown that some of the major complications of diabetes mellitus can be
      partially prevented or delayed by intensive glycaemic control. However, there are
      benefits and risks in aiming for near normal blood glucose levels. Intensive
      glycaemic control delays the onset and progression of retinopathy, nephropathy
      and neuropathy. Epidemiological and observational studies have shown that
      cardiovascular events may be correlated with the severity and duration of
      diabetes mellitus, but major randomised trials have only shown weak and
      nonsignificant benefits of intensive glycaemic management in decreasing event
      rates. A modest improvement in lipid profile results from blood glucose control
      although, in the majority of cases, not enough to reach current targets.
      Detrimental effects of intensive glycaemic control include bodyweight gain and
      hypoglycaemia. Controversial issues in the management of patients with diabetes
      mellitus include the unproven increase in cardiovascular morbidity from
      sulphonylureas and hyperinsulinaemia, and the still unknown long term effects of 
      newer oral antihyperglycaemic agents alone or in combination with traditional
      therapies (such as sulphonylureas and metformin). It is important to
      individualise management in setting glycaemic goals. Control of cardiovascular
      risk factors through blood pressure and lipid control and treatment with aspirin 
      (acetylsalicylic acid) and ACE inhibitors have consistently shown benefits in the
      prevention of both macro- and microvascular complications in patients with
      diabetes mellitus; these measures deserve priority.

TI  - Mealtime glucose regulation with nateglinide in healthy volunteers: comparison
      with repaglinide and placebo.
PG  - 73-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to compare the pharmacodynamic effects of
      single doses of nateglinide (A-4166), repaglinide, and placebo on mealtime
      insulin secretion and glycemic control in healthy subjects. RESEARCH DESIGN AND
      METHODS: Fifteen healthy volunteers participated in this open-label five-period
      crossover study. They received single 10-min preprandial doses of 120 mg
      nateglinide, 0.5 or 2 mg repaglinide, or placebo or 1 min preprandially of 2 mg
      repaglinide. Subjects received each dose only once, 48 h apart. Pharmacodynamic
      and pharmacokinetic assessments were performed from 0 to 12 h postdose. RESULTS: 
      Nateglinide induced insulin secretion more rapidly than 2 and 0.5 mg repaglinide 
      and placebo (10 min preprandial), with mean rates of insulin rise of 2.3, 1.3,
      1.15, and 0.8 microU x ml(-1) x min(-1), respectively, over the 0- to 30-min
      postmeal interval. After peaking, insulin concentrations decreased rapidly in the
      nateglinide-treated group and were similar to placebo within 2 h postdose. After 
      2 mg repaglinide, peak insulin concentrations were delayed and returned to
      baseline more slowly than with nateglinide treatment. Nateglinide treatment
      produced lower average plasma glucose concentrations in the 0- to 2-h postdose
      interval than either dose of repaglinide and placebo (P < 0.05 vs. 0.5 mg
      repaglinide and placebo). Plasma glucose concentrations returned more rapidly to 
      predose levels with nateglinide treatment than with either dose of repaglinide.
      Treatment with repaglinide produced a sustained hypoglycemic effect up to 6 h
      postdose. CONCLUSIONS: In this single-dose study in nondiabetic volunteers,
      nateglinide provided a more rapid and shorter-lived stimulation of insulin
      secretion than repaglinide, resulting in lower meal-related glucose excursions.
      If similar results are observed in diabetes, nateglinide may produce a more
      physiological insulin secretory response with the potential for a reduced risk of
      postabsorptive hypoglycemia.

TI  - Flexible meal-related dosing with repaglinide facilitates glycemic control in
      therapy-naive type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 11-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This double-blind randomized placebo-controlled parallel group study
      assessed the efficacy and safety (with particular regard to body weight and
      hypoglycemia) of repaglinide when used in a flexible mealtime dosing regimen in a
      situation close to everyday clinical practice. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A
      total of 408 patients with type 2 diabetes considered poorly controlled by diet, 
      but without a history of previous antidiabetic medication, were randomized to
      receive 0.5 mg repaglinide at mealtimes (increased to 1 mg after 4 weeks
      depending on blood glucose response) or placebo for 16 weeks. Patients were free 
      to choose a flexible meal pattern, adjusting the dosing schedule from two to four
      preprandial doses per day in accordance with a "one meal, one dose; no meal, no
      dose" principle. Additional snacks were not a requirement of the treatment
      schedule. RESULTS: Treatment with repaglinide significantly improved glycemic
      control with respect to baseline and placebo, reducing HbA1c by 1.14% from
      baseline and fasting plasma glucose by 1.8 mmol/l. Improvement in glycemic
      control was independent of the meal pattern adopted by patients, including those 
      most commonly taking two or four meals daily, with no correlation between meal
      pattern and risk of hypoglycemia. The improvement in glycemic control was also
      independent of degree of obesity and age < or =65 or >65 years. There was no
      significant body weight increase in the repaglinide group. CONCLUSIONS: Mealtime 
      dosing with repaglinide is effective in improving overall glycemic control in
      type 2 diabetic patients for which control is suboptimal using diet alone.
      Patients are able to vary their meal pattern from a conventional regimen of three
      meals daily without compromising control or increasing the risk of adverse
      events.

TI  - Near-normoglycaemic remission in African-Americans with Type 2 diabetes mellitus 
      is associated with recovery of beta cell function.
PG  - 10-6
AB  - AIMS: To prospectively determine the frequency of remission and possible
      mechanism of beta cell recovery in non-Whites with Type 2 diabetes mellitus in
      the setting of intensive glycaemic regulation using pharmacological agents.
      METHODS: Twenty-six consecutive, newly diagnosed African-American, Type 2
      diabetic patients presenting primarily for severe hyperglycaemia (31.0+/-12.8
      mmol/l) were followed for at least 1 year. Initial hospitalization included
      treatment with insulin, fluids and electrolytes. Outpatient intensive glycaemic
      regulation included insulin or glibenclamide, diabetes education and diet that
      altered nutrient content. Plasma glucose and C-peptide responses to an oral
      glucose tolerance test and HbA1c were measured at < 14, 15-56 and 57-112 days
      after presentation. Remission was defined as a HbA1c < or = 6.3% and fasting
      plasma glucose < 6.9 mmol/l, 3 months after discontinuing all pharmacological
      agents. RESULTS: Eleven of 26 patients (42.3%) developed remission after a mean
      of 83 days of pharmacological treatment and remained in remission during
      follow-up for 248-479 days; one relapsed after 294 days. Fifteen patients who did
      not develop a remission and were followed for 168-468 days, required continuing
      pharmacological therapy to be well-controlled. (mean HbA1c = 7.1%). There was no 
      significant difference in age, sex, plasma glucose at presentation, initial
      glycaemic regulation, final body mass index, magnitude of weight change or
      pharmacological agents used for treatment between the two groups. Plasma
      C-peptide response to oral glucose was initially (< 14 days) suppressed in all
      subjects and subsequently increased. The increase was significantly greater in
      those who underwent a remission than those who did not. Neither significant
      weight loss nor severe hypoglycaemia was observed in either group during
      intensive treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Forty-two per cent of newly diagnosed,
      unselected African-Americans with Type 2 diabetes, treated intensively using
      pharmacological agents, education and diet developed near-normoglycaemic
      remission. Remission was associated with a greater recovery of glucose-stimulated
      insulin secretion suggesting that therapies directed at promoting beta cell
      recovery and preservation are potentially useful approaches to the treatment of
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus.

TI  - Effect of rifampicin on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of glimepiride.
PG  - 591-5
AB  - AIMS: To study the effects of rifampicin on the pharmacokinetics and
      pharmaco-dynamics of glimepiride, a new sulphonylurea antidiabetic drug. METHODS:
      In this randomised, two-phase cross-over study, 10 healthy volunteers were
      treated for 5 days with 600 mg rifampicin or placebo once daily. On day 6, a
      single oral dose of 1 mg glimepiride was administered. Plasma glimepiride and
      blood glucose concentrations were measured up to 12 h. RESULTS: Rifampicin
      decreased the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve of glimepiride 
      by 34% (P < 0.001) and the mean elimination half-life by 25% (P < 0.05). No
      significant differences in the blood glucose response to glimepiride were
      observed between the placebo and rifampicin phases. However, symptomatic
      hypoglycaemia occurred only during the placebo phase. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of
      rifampicin on the pharmacokinetics of glimepiride suggest that rifampicin induced
      the CYP2C9-mediated metabolism of glimepiride and thereby slightly increased its 
      systemic clearance. Because the interaction was modest and did not significantly 
      alter the glucose-lowering effect of glimepiride in healthy volunteers, it is
      probably of limited clinical significance. However, in some patients the
      hypoglycaemic effect of glimepiride may be reduced during concomitant treatment
      with rifampicin.

TI  - Management of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular risk: lessons from
      intervention trials.
PG  - 975-83
AB  - Although the diagnosis of type 2 (noninsulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus is made
      when blood glucose levels exceed values which increase the risk of microvascular 
      complications, macrovascular disease is the major complication of type 2 diabetes
      mellitus. Both epidemiological and prospective data have demonstrated that
      treatment of hyperglycaemia is markedly effective in reducing the risk of
      microvascular disease but is less potent in reducing that of myocardial
      infarction, stroke and peripheral vascular disease. Treatment of other
      cardiovascular risk factors, although by definition less prevalent than
      hyperglycaemia, appears to be more effective in preventing macrovascular disease 
      than treatment of hyperglycaemia. In recent years, data from intervention trials 
      have suggested that greater benefits with respect to the prevention of
      macrovascular disease can be achieved by effective treatment of hypertension and 
      hypercholesterolaemia, and by the use of small doses of aspirin (acetylsalicylic 
      acid) than by treating hyperglycaemia alone. On the other hand, the UK
      Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), which examined the impact of intensive
      glucose and blood pressure (BP) control on micro- and macrovascular
      complications, is the only intervention trial to include only patients with type 
      2 diabetes mellitus. The UKPDS data, the epidemic increase in the number of
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and their high cardiovascular risk have,
      however, initiated several new trials addressing, in particular, the possible
      benefits of treatment of the most common form of dyslipidaemia (high serum
      triglyceride and low high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels) in these
      patients. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is thus a disease associated with a high
      vascular risk, where the majority of patients need, and are likely to benefit
      from, pharmacological treatment of several cardiovascular risk factors provided
      treatment targets have not been achieved by life-style modification.

TI  - Nateglinide alone and in combination with metformin improves glycemic control by 
      reducing mealtime glucose levels in type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 1660-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of nateglinide and metformin
      alone and in combination in type 2 diabetic patients inadequately controlled by
      diet, focusing on changes in HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and mealtime
      glucose excursions. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this randomized double-blind 
      study, patients with an HbA1c level between 6.8 and 11.0% during a 4-week placebo
      run-in received 24 weeks' treatment with 120 mg nateglinide before meals (n =
      179), 500 mg metformin three times a day (n = 178), combination therapy (n =
      172), or placebo (n = 172). HbA1c and FPG were evaluated regularly, and plasma
      glucose levels were determined after Sustacal challenge at weeks 0, 12, and 24.
      Hypoglycemia and other adverse events were recorded. RESULTS: At study end point,
      HbA1c was reduced from baseline with nateglinide and metformin but was increased 
      with placebo (-0.5, -0.8, and +0.5%, respectively; P < or = 0.0001). Changes in
      FPG followed the same pattern (-0.7, -1.6, and +0.4 mmol/l; P < or = 0.0001).
      Combination therapy was additive (HbA1c -1.4% and FPG -2.4 mmol/l; P < or = 0.01 
      vs. monotherapy). After Sustacal challenge, there was a greater reduction in
      mealtime glucose with nateglinide monotherapy compared with metformin monotherapy
      or placebo (adjusted area under the curve [AUC]0-130 min -2.1, -1.1, and -0.6
      mmol x h(-1) x l(-1); p < or = 0.0001). An even greater effect was observed with 
      combination therapy (AUC0-130 min -2.5 mmol x h(-1) x l(-1); P < or = 0.0001 vs. 
      metformin and placebo). All regimens were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS:
      Nateglinide and metformin monotherapy each improved overall glycemic control but 
      by different mechanisms. Nateglinide decreased mealtime glucose excursions,
      whereas metformin primarily affected FPG. In combination, nateglinide and
      metformin had complementary effects, improving HbA1c, FPG, and postprandial
      hyperglycemia.

TI  - Pharmacology and clinical experience with repaglinide.
PG  - 885-98
AB  - Repaglinide (NovoNorm((R))) is a novel oral antidiabetic agent, the first of a
      new class of insulin secretagogues known as the prandial glucose regulators to be
      approved for use in patients with Type 2 diabetes. Prandial glucose regulation is
      aimed at restoring the first-phase insulin response that follows consumption of a
      meal, which is missing in patients with Type 2 diabetes. After repaglinide
      administration, the resulting insulin profile reflects that of healthy
      individuals more closely, providing tighter glycaemic control and reducing the
      risk of hypoglycaemic events. Repaglinide is quickly absorbed and rapidly
      eliminated through biliary excretion, making it suitable for use in patients with
      renal impairment. It appears in the bloodstream within 15 to 30 min of dosing,
      stimulating short-term insulin release from the pancreatic beta-cells by binding 
      to a unique site on the beta-cell membrane. Rapid elimination ensures that
      postprandial insulin levels quickly return to preprandial levels as the high
      prandial glucose level subsides. Repaglinide is given on a 'one meal, one tablet;
      no meal, no tablet' basis. It is particularly effective in patients who have not 
      previously been treated with an oral antidiabetic agent, significantly reducing
      glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) levels by 1.6%. It also offers increased
      mealtime flexibility and safety, compared with other oral antidiabetic agents. As
      a result of the short plasma half-life and lack of accumulation of repaglinide
      with repeated dosing, the risk of between-meal and nocturnal hypoglycaemia is
      substantially reduced compared with other oral antidiabetic agents. Repaglinide
      acts synergistically with metformin, consistently improving glycaemic control in 
      patients who were insufficiently controlled by metformin alone. Results from
      recent studies have shown similar synergistic effects with neutral protamine
      Hagedorn (NPH)-insulin or troglitazone.

TI  - A comparison of glyburide and insulin in women with gestational diabetes
      mellitus.
PG  - 1134-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Women with gestational diabetes mellitus are rarely treated with a
      sulfonylurea drug, because of concern about teratogenicity and neonatal
      hypoglycemia. There is little information about the efficacy of these drugs in
      this group of women. METHODS: We studied 404 women with singleton pregnancies and
      gestational diabetes that required treatment. The women were randomly assigned
      between 11 and 33 weeks of gestation to receive glyburide or insulin according to
      an intensified treatment protocol. The primary end point was achievement of the
      desired level of glycemic control. Secondary end points included maternal and
      neonatal complications. RESULTS: The mean (+/-SD) pretreatment blood glucose
      concentration as measured at home for one week was 114+/-19 mg per deciliter
      (6.4+/-1.1 mmol per liter) in the glyburide group and 116+/-22 mg per deciliter
      (6.5+/-1.2 mmol per liter) in the insulin group (P=0.33). The mean concentrations
      during treatment were 105+/-16 mg per deciliter (5.9+/-0.9 mmol per liter) in the
      glyburide group and 105+/-18 mg per deciliter (5.9+/-1.0 mmol per liter) in the
      insulin group (P=0.99). Eight women in the glyburide group (4 percent) required
      insulin therapy. There were no significant differences between the glyburide and 
      insulin groups in the percentage of infants who were large for gestational age
      (12 percent and 13 percent, respectively); who had macrosomia, defined as a birth
      weight of 4000 g or more (7 percent and 4 percent); who had lung complications (8
      percent and 6 percent); who had hypoglycemia (9 percent and 6 percent); who were 
      admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (6 percent and 7 percent); or who had 
      fetal anomalies (2 percent and 2 percent). The cord-serum insulin concentrations 
      were similar in the two groups, and glyburide was not detected in the cord serum 
      of any infant in the glyburide group. CONCLUSIONS: In women with gestational
      diabetes, glyburide is a clinically effective alternative to insulin therapy.

TI  - Nateglinide.
PG  - 607-615; discussion 616-7
AB  - Nateglinide is a novel D-phenylalanine derivative that inhibits ATP-sensitive K+ 
      channels in pancreatic beta-cells in the presence of glucose and thereby
      stimulates the prandial release of insulin. Nateglinide reduces fasting and
      mealtime blood glucose levels in animals, healthy volunteers, and patients with
      type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus, and produces prompt prandial
      insulin responses with return to baseline insulin levels between meals. In
      randomised, double-blind 24-week studies in patients with type 2 diabetes, oral
      nateglinide 120 mg 3 times daily before meals improved glycaemic control
      significantly relative to placebo. Nateglinide 120 mg plus metformin 500 mg, both
      3 times daily, conferred greater glycaemic improvement than either drug given
      alone, and nateglinide 60 or 120 mg 3 times daily plus metformin 1 g twice daily 
      was superior to metformin plus placebo. Nateglinide 120 mg 3 times daily
      significantly reduced hyperglycaemia relative to placebo in a 16-week
      double-blind study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Combination therapy
      with troglitazone 600 mg daily produced significantly better glycaemic control
      than either drug given as monotherapy. Mild hypoglycaemia was the most frequently
      reported adverse event (1.3% of patients) after treatment with nateglinide 120 mg
      3 times daily in a 16-week clinical study. No clinically significant
      abnormalities in laboratory results, ECGs, vital signs or physical examination
      findings have been noted in patients taking the drug.

TI  - Therapy focused on lowering postprandial glucose, not fasting glucose, may be
      superior for lowering HbA1c. IOEZ Study Group.
PG  - 1236-41
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the overall efficacy of combination therapies focused on
      fasting or postprandial blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes not
      adequately controlled with oral sulfonylurea agents alone. RESEARCH DESIGN AND
      METHODS: A total of 135 patients were randomly assigned for 3 months to 1 of 3
      combination regimens with glyburide (G) that addressed postprandial blood glucose
      with insulin lispro (L+G), premeal blood glucose with metformin (M+G), or fasting
      blood glucose (FBG) with bedtime NPH insulin (NPH+G). RESULTS: At end point,
      HbA1c was significantly lower with all therapies (P = 0.001) and was
      significantly lower for L+G (7.68+/-0.88%) compared with either NPH+G
      (8.51+/-1.38%, P = 0.003) or M+G (8.31+/-1.31%, P = 0.025). FBG at end point was 
      significantly lower for NPH+G (8.49+/-2.36 mmol/l) compared with either L+G
      (10.57+/-1.97 mmol/l, P = 0.001) or M+G (9.69+/-2.89 mmol/l, P = 0.029). The mean
      2-h postprandial glucose after a test meal was significantly lower for L+G
      (10.87+/-2.88 mmol/l) versus NPH+G (12.21+/-3.12 mmol/, P = 0.052) or versus M+G 
      (12.72+/-3.26 mmol/l, P = 0.009). The overall rate of hypoglycemia (episodes per 
      30 days) was low and not statistically significant between groups (P = 0.156).
      CONCLUSIONS: Adding a second antihyperglycemic agent, regardless of its timing of
      action, lowers HbA1c and glucose values. However, when insulin lispro was used to
      focus on postprandial blood glucose, there was a greater impact on overall
      metabolic control. These data support the importance of lowering postprandial
      blood glucose to optimize overall glycemic control and thus improve long-term
      outcomes.

TI  - Oral hypoglycaemic agents in 118 diabetic pregnancies.
PG  - 507-11
AB  - AIMS: To assess maternal and neonatal complications in pregnancies of diabetic
      women treated with oral hypoglycaemic agents during pregnancy. METHODS: A cohort 
      study including all consecutively registered, orally treated pregnant diabetic
      patients set in a diabetic obstetrical service at a university hospital: 50 women
      treated with metformin, 68 women treated with sulphonylurea during pregnancy and 
      a reference group of 42 diabetic women treated with insulin during pregnancy.
      RESULTS: The prevalence of pre-eclampsia was significantly increased in the group
      of women treated with metformin compared to women treated with sulphonylurea or
      insulin (32 vs. 7 vs. 10%, P < 0.001). No difference in neonatal morbidity was
      observed between the orally treated and insulin-treated group; no cases of severe
      hypoglycaemia or jaundice were seen in the orally treated groups. However, in the
      group of women treated with metformin in the third trimester, the perinatal
      mortality was significantly increased compared to women not treated with
      metformin (11.6 vs. 1.3%, P < 0.02). CONCLUSION: Treatment with metformin during 
      pregnancy was associated with increased prevalence of pre-eclampsia and a high
      perinatal mortality.

TI  - A rational approach to drug therapy of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 95-113
AB  - Several new pharmacological agents have recently been developed to optimise the
      management of type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. The aim of this
      article is to briefly review the various therapeutic agents available for
      management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and to suggest a potential
      approach to drug selection. There are three general therapeutic modalities
      relevant to diabetes care. The first modality is lifestyle adjustments aimed at
      improving endogenous insulin sensitivity or insulin effect. This can be achieved 
      by increased physical activity and bodyweight reduction with diet and behavioural
      modification, and the use of pharmacological agents or surgery. This first
      modality is not discussed in depth in this article. The second modality involves 
      increasing insulin availability by the administration of exogenous insulin,
      insulin analogues, sulphonylureas and the new insulin secretagogue, repaglinide. 
      The most frequently encountered adverse effect of these agents is hypoglycaemia. 
      Bodyweight gain can also be a concern, especially in patients who are obese. The 
      association between hyperinsulinaemia and premature atherosclerosis is still a
      debatable question. The third modality consists of agents such as biguanides and 
      thiazolidinediones which enhance insulin sensitivity, or agents that decrease
      insulin requirements like the alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. Type 2 diabetes
      mellitus is a heterogeneous disease with multiple underlying pathophysiological
      processes. Therapy should be individualised based on the degree of
      hyperglycaemia, hyperinsulinaemia or insulin deficiency. In addition, several
      factors have to be considered when prescribing a specific therapeutic agent.
      These factors include efficacy, safety, affordability and ease of administration.

TI  - Effects of glibenclamide, a K(ATP) channel blocker, on warm-up phenomenon in type
      II diabetic patients with chronic stable angina pectoris.
PG  - 535-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Warm-up phenomenon, one of the clinical models of ischemic
      preconditioning, refers to an increased tolerance to myocardial ischemia during
      the second of two consecutive exercise tests. HYPOTHESIS: Blockers of K(ATP)
      channels, such as the sulfonylurea drugs, can induce loss of ischemic
      preconditioning. This study aimed to investigate the effects of glibenclamide, a 
      sulfonylurea with a high affinity for myocardial K(ATP) channels, on the results 
      of two consecutive exercise tests in diabetic patients with coronary artery
      disease. METHODS: Eighteen type II diabetic patients with chronic stable angina
      pectoris participated in this study. All patients underwent two consecutive
      treadmill exercise tests with a recovery period of 15 min in fasting state. On
      the day after these exercise tests, 10 mg oral glibenclamide was given to the
      same patients and 30 min later 200 ml of 30% glucose solution was given orally.
      Half an hour later, which is the time of peak plasma levels of glibenclamide, two
      exercise tests were repeated consecutively with a 15 min recovery period.
      RESULTS: There was no difference in blood glucose levels before and after
      exercise tests on each day (p > 0.05). Without glibenclamide, heart rate,
      rate-pressure product at 1.5 mm ST depression, and peak exercise increased
      significantly (p < 0.05). Time to 1.5 mm ST-segment depression and onset of pain,
      as well as duration of exercise also increased, but ST-segment depression and
      ST-recovery time significantly decreased (p < 0.05). In contrast, these values
      did not significantly change after glibenclamide (p>0.05), with a significant
      drug-test interaction (p < 0.05, at two-way ANOVA). CONCLUSIONS: Glibenclamide,
      an oral hypoglycemic agent with a K(ATP) channel-blocker activity, with a 10 mg
      oral dose, abolished the warm-up phenomenon which is a clinical finding of
      ischemic preconditioning on two consecutive exercise tests. Therefore,
      glibenclamide should be used carefully in patients with coronary heart disease
      and diabetes mellitus since this agent leads to a decrease in ischemic threshold 
      and exercise capacity.

TI  - Mealtime glucose regulation by nateglinide in type-2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 129-33
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Pharmacodynamic effects of nateglinide, a novel antidiabetic agent,
      were investigated in patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: Ten
      patients participated in this single-center, double-blind, crossover study.
      Plasma glucose and insulin levels were measured over 24 h following five 7-day
      treatment periods with nateglinide (30, 60, or 120 mg) or placebo given three
      times daily before breakfast, lunch, and dinner. A fifth treatment consisted of
      120 mg nateglinide four times daily, with the fourth dose given before an evening
      snack. RESULTS: Taken 10 min before meals, doses of 30-120 mg nateglinide caused 
      dose-dependent increases in plasma insulin levels that were significantly greater
      than with placebo. Higher doses were more effective and had a longer duration of 
      action than lower doses. Nateglinide was also significantly better than placebo
      in lowering plasma glucose levels; the 60-mg and 120-mg doses were similarly
      effective and superior to the 30-mg nateglinide treatment. Following the fourth
      120-mg dose, the glucose-lowering effects of treatment were maintained through
      the night. No serious adverse events occurred during the study. There were no
      events of hypoglycemia and no clinically meaningful changes in safety parameters.
      CONCLUSIONS: Nateglinide produced rapid, short-lived, dose-related increases in
      plasma insulin that significantly lowered mealtime glucose excursions compared
      with placebo with no incidence of hypoglycemia. The decrease in mealtime glucose 
      levels produced a significant improvement in overall 24-h glycemia.

TI  - Improved control of mealtime glucose excursions with coadministration of
      nateglinide and metformin.
PG  - 349-53
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Nateglinide, a new short-acting D-phenylalanine derivative for
      treating type 2 diabetes, reduces mealtime blood glucose excursions by
      physiologic regulation of insulin secretion. This study evaluated the
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions of nateglinide and metformin in 
      subjects with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 12 type 2 
      diabetic subjects with the following baseline characteristics were enrolled: age,
      56 +/- 13 years; BMI, 28.7 +/- 4.5 kg/m2; HbA1c, 8.4 +/- 1.3%; and fasting plasma
      glucose 13 +/- 2.8 mmol/l. All subjects had been previously treated with
      glyburide and were switched to metformin monotherapy for 3 weeks before study
      start. Subjects then randomly received, in combination with 500 mg metformin,
      either 120 mg nateglinide or placebo before meals for 1 day, followed by the
      alternate treatment 7 days later. After 1 week of washout from both drugs,
      subjects received 1 day of open-label nateglinide treatment. Plasma
      concentrations of glucose, insulin, nateglinide, and metformin were assessed
      frequently during inpatient periods. RESULTS: Postmeal plasma glucose levels were
      significantly lower in subjects treated with nateglinide plus metformin than in
      those treated with either drug alone (P < 0.001), especially after lunch and
      dinner. Coadministration of nateglinide and metformin did not affect the
      pharmacokinetics of either drug. All treatments were safe and well tolerated.
      CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy with nateglinide and metformin was more
      effective than either treatment alone and did not result in any pharmacokinetic
      interactions. Coadministration of nateglinide and metformin appears to be an
      excellent option for treating patients with type 2 diabetes not controlled with
      monotherapy.

TI  - Rapid and short-acting mealtime insulin secretion with nateglinide controls both 
      prandial and mean glycemia.
PG  - 202-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to assess the efficacy and safety of
      four fixed doses of nateglinide compared with placebo in the treatment of
      patients with type 2 diabetes with focus on the prandial state. RESEARCH DESIGN
      AND METHODS: This randomized double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter study
      was conducted in 289 patients who received either nateglinide at doses of 30 mg
      (n = 51), 60 mg (n = 58), 120 mg (n = 63), or 180 mg (n = 57) or placebo (n = 60)
      before three main meals for 12 weeks. Levels of HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose
      (FPG), fructosamine, and plasma lipids were measured at predetermined intervals, 
      and the effects of nateglinide on prandial glucose insulin, C-peptide, and
      triglyceride levels were measured after a liquid standard meal (Sustacal; Mead
      Johnson, Evansville, IN). Adverse events and hypoglycemic episodes were recorded.
      RESULTS: After a liquid meal challenge, nateglinide rapidly increased mealtime
      insulin levels within 30 min of drug intake and reduced mealtime glucose
      excursions without affecting triglyceride levels. At study end point, reduction
      of HbA1c levels was statistically significantly greater with nateglinide at doses
      of 60, 120, and 180 mg than placebo (-0.45, -0.62, and -0.64%, respectively;
      P<0.05). The mean level of FPG was significantly reduced versus placebo in the
      nateglinide 120-mg group only (-1.14 mmol/l P<0.01). Overall, nateglinide was
      well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that nateglinide improves
      mealtime and mean glycemic control in a dose-dependent manner by restoring early 
      insulin secretion phase. Nateglinide was well tolerated and is suitable for the
      treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Effects of oral hypoglycemic agents and diet on protein metabolism in type 2
      diabetes.
PG  - 1-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We tested whether oral hypoglycemic agents (OHA), gliclazide with or
      without metformin, during an isoenergetic (ISO) and then a low-energy diet (LED) 
      improve the altered kinetics of whole-body protein metabolism in type 2 diabetes.
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 13 type 2 diabetic patients (aged 51+/-2 
      years, weight 110+/-5 kg, BMI 41+/-1 kg/m2, fasting glucose [FSG] 11.5+/-0.9
      mmol/l) (means+/-SEM) and 10 obese control subjects (48+/-3 years, 98+/-6 kg,
      37+/-2 kg/m2, FSG 5.5+/-0.3 mmol/l) consumed an ISO, 1.5 g x kg(-1) x day(-1)
      protein for a body weight corresponding to a BMI of 25 (BMI25), a formula diet (7
      days for obese control subjects, 15 days for diabetic patients), and then a
      28-day LED with 50% of the energy of ISO but the same protein intake (101+/-2
      g/day). OHAs were given during ISO (days 8-15) and LED. On days 6-8 (and 12-14
      for diabetic subjects) of ISO and 26-28 of LED, the 60-h oral 15N-glycine method 
      was used to obtain nitrogen flux (Q), synthesis (S), and breakdown (B). Muscle
      protein catabolism was estimated from N(tau)-methylhistidine (3MH) excretion.
      RESULTS: During ISO with hyperglycemia, Q, and B adjusted for fat-free mass, sex,
      and age were higher and nitrogen balance and net endogenous protein synthesis
      (S-B) lower than in control subjects (P<0.05). OHA decreased FSG (9+/-1 mmol/l)
      and 3MH and increased plasma insulin-to-glucose ratio, nitrogen retention, and
      S-B to levels in control subjects. The change in S-B correlated with that in FSG 
      (r = -0.845, P = 0.001) and in fasting plasma C-peptide (r = 0.852, P = 0.0005). 
      With LED and OHA, weight decreased 6.3 kg, glycemia reached near-normal levels,
      and nitrogen equilibrium was maintained; Q decreased by 7%, S and B by 11%
      (P<0.05) to values found in control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: OHA during ISO
      corrected protein turnover in relation to glycemia and plasma C-peptide. The LED 
      maintained protein homeostasis in obese control subjects and, in diabetes
      patients with OHA, normalized protein metabolism. These findings have
      implications for diet and OHA prescription.

TI  - Increased prandial insulin secretion after administration of a single preprandial
      oral dose of repaglinide in patients with type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 518-23
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the dose-related pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of a
      single preprandial oral dose of repaglinide in patients with type 2 diabetes.
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 16 Caucasian men with type 2 diabetes
      participated in two placebo-controlled double-blind randomized cross-over
      studies. Patients were randomized to receive a single oral dose of repaglinide
      (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg in study 1 and 4.0 mg in study 2) or placebo (both studies)
      administered 15 min before the first of two sequential identical standard meals
      (breakfast and lunch) that were 4 h apart. During each of the study days, which
      were 1 week apart, blood samples were taken at frequent intervals over a period
      of approximately 8 h for measurement of plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and
      repaglinide concentrations. RESULTS: During the first meal period (0-240 min),
      administration of repaglinide reduced significantly the area under the curve
      (AUC) for glucose concentration and significantly increased the AUC for insulin
      levels, C-peptide levels, and the insulin secretion rate. These results, compared
      with those of administering placebo, were dose dependent and log linear. The
      effect of repaglinide administration on insulin secretion was most pronounced in 
      the early prandial period. Within 30 min, it caused a relative increase in
      insulin secretion of up to 150%. During the second meal period (240-480 min),
      there was no difference between repaglinide and placebo administration in the AUC
      for glucose concentration, C-peptide concentration, and the estimated insulin
      secretion rate. CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of repaglinide (0.5-4.0 mg) before
      breakfast improves insulin secretion and reduces prandial hyperglycemia
      dose-dependently Administration of repaglinide had no effect on insulin secretion
      with the second meal, which was consumed 4 h after breakfast.

TI  - Repaglinide acutely amplifies pulsatile insulin secretion by augmentation of
      burst mass with no effect on burst frequency.
PG  - 675-81
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Repaglinide is a new oral hypoglycemic agent that acts as a prandial
      glucose regulator proposed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes by stimulating
      insulin secretion. The aim of this study was to explore actions of repaglinide on
      the rapid pulsatile insulin release by high-frequency insulin sampling and
      analysis of insulin-concentration time series. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We
      examined 8 healthy lean male subjects in a single-dose double-blind
      placebo-controlled crossover design. After the subjects underwent an overnight
      fast, blood sampling was initiated and continued every minute for 120 min. After 
      40 min, a single dose (0.5 mg) of repaglinide or placebo was given. Serum
      insulin-concentration time series were assessed by deconvolution analyses and the
      regularity statistic by approximate entropy (ApEn). RESULTS: Average insulin
      concentration was increased after repaglinide administration (basal vs.
      stimulated period, P values are placebo vs. repaglinide) (25.1 +/- 3.6 vs. 33.5
      +/- 4.1 pmol/l, P < 0.001). Insulin secretory burst mass (15.8 +/- 2.2 vs. 19.6
      +/- 2.8 pmol x l(-1) x pulse(-1), P = 0.02) and amplitude (6.1 +/- 0.9 vs. 7.7
      +/- 1.2 pmol x l(-1) x min(-1), P = 0.008) were augmented after repaglinide
      administration. A concomitant trend toward an increase in basal insulin secretion
      was observed (2.5 +/- 0.3 vs. 3.2 +/- 0.4 pmol x l(-1) x min(-1), p = 0.06),
      while the interpulse interval was unaltered (6.8 +/- 1.0 vs. 5.4 +/- 0.4
      min/pulse, P = 0.38). ApEn increased significantly after repaglinide
      administration (0.623 +/- 0.045 vs. 0.670 +/- 0.034, P = 0.04), suggesting less
      orderly oscillatory patterns of insulin release. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, a
      single dose of repaglinide amplifies insulin secretory burst mass (and basal
      secretion) with no change in burst frequency. The possible importance of these
      mechanisms in the treatment of type 2 diabetes characterized by disrupted
      pulsatile insulin secretion remains to be clarified.

PG  - 1373-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost effectiveness of conventional versus intensive
      blood glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes. DESIGN: Incremental cost 
      effectiveness analysis alongside randomised controlled trial. SETTING: 23 UK
      hospital clinic based study centres. PARTICIPANTS: 3867 patients with newly
      diagnosed type 2 diabetes (mean age 53 years). INTERVENTIONS: Conventional
      (primarily diet) glucose control policy versus intensive control policy with a
      sulphonylurea or insulin. Main outcome measures: Incremental cost per event-free 
      year gained within the trial period. RESULTS: Intensive glucose control increased
      trial treatment costs by pound 695 (95% confidence interval pound 555 to pound
      836) per patient but reduced the cost of complications by pound 957 (pound 233 to
      pound 1681) compared with conventional management. If standard practice visit
      patterns were assumed rather than trial conditions, the incremental cost of
      intensive management was pound 478 (-pound 275 to pound 1232) per patient. The
      within trial event-free time gained in the intensive group was 0.60 (0.12 to
      1.10) years and the lifetime gain 1.14 (0.69 to 1.61) years. The incremental cost
      per event-free year gained was pound 1166 (costs and effects discounted at 6% a
      year) and pound 563 (costs discounted at 6% a year and effects not discounted).
      CONCLUSIONS: Intensive blood glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes
      significantly increased treatment costs but substantially reduced the cost of
      complications and increased the time free of complications.

TI  - Lack of interaction between tolcapone and tolbutamide in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 544-51
AB  - To assess the effect of tolcapone (an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 [CYP] 2C9 in
      vitro) on the pharmacokinetics and hypoglycemic effect of the CYP 2C9 substrate
      tolbutamide, 12 healthy male volunteers were randomized to receive a single dose 
      of tolbutamide 500 mg plus either placebo or tolcapone 200 mg after an overnight 
      fast and 30 minutes after the start of a 6.5-hour 5% glucose infusion (150 mL/h).
      The participants crossed over to receive the alternative regimen after a washout 
      period of at least 7 days. Tolcapone had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of
      tolbutamide or its metabolites and did not influence the effect of tolbutamide on
      plasma glucose concentrations. No serious adverse events or abnormal laboratory
      results or vital signs were reported. In conclusion, clinically relevant
      drug-drug interactions between tolcapone and tolbutamide when given together in
      clinical practice appear unlikely.

TI  - Effects of the new oral hypoglycaemic agent nateglinide on insulin secretion in
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 225-9
AB  - AIMS: The new non-sulphonylurea oral hypoglycaemic agent nateglinide has been
      shown to enhance insulin secretion in animals and in healthy human volunteers and
      thus offers a potential advance in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
      This study examined whether nateglinide can enhance insulin secretion, and
      particularly the first phase insulin response, in patients with Type 2 diabetes. 
      METHODS: A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, examining the effects of a
      single oral dose of 60 mg nateglinide, given 20 min prior to an intravenous
      glucose tolerance test (IGTT), on insulin secretion in 10 otherwise healthy
      Caucasian men with recently diagnosed Type 2 diabetes (duration since diagnosis
      0-44 months). RESULTS: Insulin secretion (both overall and first phase) was
      significantly increased by nateglinide (P < 0.001), as were C-peptide (P < 0.001)
      and proinsulin (P < 0.001) secretion. Overall glucose concentrations following
      glucose challenge were lower after nateglinide than after placebo (P = 0.05).
      CONCLUSIONS: Nateglinide significantly increases insulin secretion in Type 2
      diabetic patients, in particular restoring the first phase insulin response.
      Further study is necessary to determine the effects of chronic administration on 
      insulin secretion and blood glucose concentration.

TI  - Comparative efficacy and potency of long-term therapy with glipizide or glyburide
      in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 143-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Long-term studies on the comparative efficacy and relative potency of
      glipizide and glyburide are sparse and controversial. METHODS: In a randomized
      prospective trial, we compared the effectiveness and relative potency of
      glipizide and glyburide over a 15-month period in 18 patients with type 2
      diabetes mellitus (DM2) (9 on glyburide and 9 on glipizide) who were unresponsive
      to diet therapy. Glycemic control was assessed using 4 methods: 1) quarterly
      fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose after a
      standard breakfast; 2) insulin and glucose response to Sustacal (test meal)
      challenge every 3 to 6 months; 3) quarterly hemoglobin A1c; and 4) intravenous
      glucose tolerance testing every 6 months to measure first and second phase
      insulin secretion. Patient characteristics were similar in each treatment group. 
      RESULTS: Similar doses of glipizide (11 mg/day) or glyburide (10 mg/day) resulted
      in comparable reduction of FPG and hemoglobin A1c and increase in first phase
      insulin response to intravenous glucose tolerance testing. There was greater
      reduction in FPG and 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose with glipizide than with 
      glyburide in 6 months. Contrary to the Physicians' Desk Reference, but consistent
      with another short-term study, our long-term study demonstrated that glipizide
      and glyburide are equipotent at similar doses in controlling hyperglycemia in
      DM2. CONCLUSIONS: Glipizide and glyburide are effective in controlling
      hyperglycemia with similar doses in DM2. Glipizide exhibits greater reduction in 
      FPG and 2PPG at 6 months. Additional studies are needed to validate equipotency
      of these drugs.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of gliclazide in Caucasians and Australian 
      Aborigines with type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 223-30
AB  - AIMS: Gliclazide pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were assessed in 9
      Caucasians and 10 Australian Aborigines with uncomplicated type 2 diabetes.
      METHODS: Subjects were on a stable dose of 80 mg gliclazide twice daily, took 160
      mg on the morning of study and had a standard breakfast. No further gliclazide
      was given over the next 48 h. Regular blood samples were drawn for serum glucose,
      insulin and gliclazide assay. Gliclazide was measured using h.p.l.c.
      Noncompartmental analysis was used to describe primary data. A multicompartment
      model incorporating entero-hepatic recirculation was fitted to group mean serum
      gliclazide profiles. RESULTS: The Caucasians were older than the Aborigines (mean
      +/- s.d. age 53.4 +/- 12.2 vs 40.3 +/- 6.9 years, P < 0.05) but had similar
      diabetes duration, body mass index and glycated haemoglobin. Noncompartmental
      analysis revealed no between-group differences in gliclazide kinetics.
      Post-breakfast serum glucose and insulin responses were also similar apart from a
      longer time to maximum concentration (tmax) for glucose amongst the Aborigines
      (2.6 +/- 0.4 vs 2.2 +/- 0. 3 h in Caucasians; P = 0.024). Gliclazide tmax
      exhibited a skewed unimodal distribution and was not associated with gliclazide
      maximum concentration, or glucose or insulin responses. Most patients had a serum
      gliclazide profile suggestive of enterohepatic recirculation and/or biphasic
      absorption. Model-derived estimates of the extent of putative enterohepatic
      recirculation were 30% and 20% of dose in Caucasians and Aborigines,
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Gliclazide is equally effective in Caucasian and
      Aboriginal diabetic patients. The pharmacokinetics of oral gliclazide appear more
      complex than previously thought. Gliclazide pharmacodynamics are unrelated to
      rate and extent of absorption, consistent with a threshold concentration for
      hypoglycaemic effect.

TI  - Single-dose pharmacokinetics of repaglinide in subjects with chronic liver
      disease.
PG  - 142-52
AB  - Repaglinide is a novel insulin secretagogue developed in response to the need for
      a fast-acting, oral prandial glucose regulator for the treatment of type 2
      (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. Repaglinide is metabolized mainly in
      the liver; its pharmacokinetics may therefore be altered by hepatic dysfunction. 
      This open, parallel-group study compared the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of
      a single 4 mg dose of repaglinide in healthy subjects (n = 12) and patients with 
      chronic liver disease (CLD) (n = 12). Values for AUC and Cmax were significantly 
      higher in CLD patients compared with healthy subjects, and the MRT was prolonged 
      in CLD patients. Values for tmax did not differ between the groups, but t1/2 was 
      significantly prolonged in CLD patients compared with previously determined
      values in healthy subjects. AUC was inversely correlated with caffeine clearance 
      in CLD patients but not in healthy subjects. Blood glucose profiles were similar 
      in both groups. Adverse events (principally hypoglycemia) were similar in the two
      groups; none was serious. Repaglinide clearance is significantly reduced in
      patients with hepatic impairment; the agent should be used with caution in this
      group.

TI  - Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of intravenous glibenclamide in Caucasian
      and Chinese patients with type-2 diabetes.
PG  - 721-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We analysed the kinetics and effects of glibenclamide (Gb) on glucose,
      insulin and proinsulin secretion in two ethnic groups (10 in each) of type-2
      diabetic patients, one of Caucasian, the other of Chinese origin. BACKGROUND:
      Diabetes mellitus type 2 is a global disease affecting all ethnic groups. There
      are ethnic differences in both the prevalence and metabolic characteristics of
      the disease. Important interethnic pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic
      differences have been reported for several drugs. With few exceptions, detailed
      studies on sulphonylurea are lacking. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The patients were
      studied on two occasions when either no Gb (control) or 1.25 mg Gb was
      administered i.v., immediately before the administration of a 75-g oral glucose
      tolerance test. Concentrations of insulin and proinsulin were determined by means
      of radioimmunoassay without cross-reactivities. Gb concentration was determined
      using high-performance liquid chromatography. Pharmacodynamic results were
      calculated using net areas under the curves, with basal values set as zero. A P
      value less than 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: When glucose was
      administered orally without Gb, Chinese patients had higher plasma glucose
      increases at 10 min (7.6 mmol/l x min vs 2.6 mmol/l x min) and higher increases
      of plasma insulin levels than Caucasians at both 10 min (198 pmol/l x min vs 54
      pmol/l x min) and 30 min (2286 pmol/l x min vs 1198 pmol/l x min). When Gb was
      administered, the plasma glucose increases were reduced, and the increases of
      serum insulin and proinsulin levels were greater in both ethnic groups. Compared 
      with the basal values (-1 min), proinsulin/insulin ratios (RPI) were lowest at
      10-30 min, followed by an increase. Chinese patients had higher increases of
      serum insulin levels at 10 min (1109 pmol/l x min vs 550 pmol/l x min) and a
      lower RPI at 30 min (6. 0% vs 7.6%) and 240 min (15.0% vs 21.0%) relative to
      Caucasians. Serum Gb data were best fitted to a biexponential i.v. model. There
      were no interethnic differences in any of the pharmacokinetic parameters.
      CONCLUSION: In summary, following oral glucose administration without Gb, Chinese
      type-2 diabetic patients had higher plasma insulin levels but also higher plasma 
      glucose levels during the first 10 min, which might reflect reduced insulin
      sensitivity or more rapid glucose absorption. Gb augmented glucose-induced
      release of both insulin and proinsulin in both ethnic groups; the effect on
      insulin secretion was more pronounced. In conclusion, minor pharmacodynamic but
      no pharmacokinetic differences were found between the two groups. It seems
      appropriate to employ the same dosage principles when using Gb in Caucasians and 
      Chinese.

PG  - 49-57
AB  - In this 24-week multicenter, double-blind, randomized, fixed-dose trial, 361
      patients having type 2 diabetes received daily preprandial treatment with placebo
      (n = 75), repaglinide 1 mg (n = 140), or repaglinide 4 mg (n = 146). By a
      last-observation carried-forward calculation, repaglinide 1 mg or 4 mg treatment 
      decreased mean fasting plasma glucose (FPG) values (by -47 mg/dL or -49 mg/dL)
      while the placebo group had increased FPG values (by 19 mg/dL). For the
      repaglinide treatment groups at the end of the study, changes in HbA1c from
      baseline values ranged from 1.8 to 1.9 percentage points lower than the placebo
      group. There were no events of severe hypoglycemia. Nearly all hypoglycemic
      symptom episodes had blood glucose levels above 45 mg/dL. Repaglinide was well
      tolerated in a preprandial fixed-dose regimen of 1 mg or 4 mg, assigned without
      adjustment for clinical parameters.

TI  - Recent advances in the pharmacologic management of diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 745-53
AB  - The importance of glucose control in reducing the complications of diabetes
      mellitus has been clearly demonstrated. The emergency physician routinely is
      expected to treat a wide range of problems related to this disease, including
      making the initial diagnosis of type 2 and occasionally type 1 diabetes. Also
      common are patients with poorly controlled diabetes. The recent introduction of
      new classes of agents to lower blood glucose, especially in type 2 diabetes,
      should improve the control in this category of patient and reduce the
      complication rate. Some of these agents, such as troglitazone, have potentially
      fatal complications and require careful monitoring. Emergency physicians should
      be aware of the common complications of these drugs because patients can present 
      to the ED with them. Hypoglycemia, a common cause of 911 calls and emergency
      visits, is not a side effect of either metformin or acarbose. Insulin lispro has 
      improved postprandial glycemic control for type 1 and some insulin-requiring type
      2 diabetics. Hypoglycemia is less of a risk with insulin lispro, and quality of
      life is better with this rapidly acting insulin. Newer methods of insulin
      delivery, such as continuous subcutaneous infusion, have greatly improved glucose
      control, given greater freedom to patients, and reduced the risks of
      hypoglycemia.

TI  - Pharmacologic therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 281-303
AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder that results from
      defects in both insulin secretion and insulin action. An elevated rate of basal
      hepatic glucose production in the presence of hyperinsulinemia is the primary
      cause of fasting hyperglycemia; after a meal, impaired suppression of hepatic
      glucose production by insulin and decreased insulin-mediated glucose uptake by
      muscle contribute almost equally to postprandial hyperglycemia. In the United
      States, five classes of oral agents, each of which works through a different
      mechanism of action, are currently available to improve glycemic control in
      patients with type 2 diabetes. The recently completed United Kingdom Prospective 
      Diabetes Study (UKPDS) has shown that type 2 diabetes mellitus is a progressive
      disorder that can be treated initially with oral agent monotherapy but will
      eventually require the addition of other oral agents, and that in many patients, 
      insulin therapy will be needed to achieve targeted glycemic levels. In the UKPDS,
      improved glycemic control, irrespective of the agent used (sulfonylureas,
      metformin, or insulin), decreased the incidence of microvascular complications
      (retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy). This review examines the goals of
      antihyperglycemic therapy and reviews the mechanism of action, efficacy,
      nonglycemic benefits, cost, and safety profile of each of the five approved
      classes of oral agents. A rationale for the use of these oral agents as
      monotherapy, in combination with each other, and in combination with insulin is
      provided.

      diabetic patients treated with long-acting versus short-acting sulphonylureas.
PG  - 586-90
AB  - AIMS: A comparison of the frequency of severe hypoglycaemia leading to hospital
      admission in people with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) treated with long vs.
      short-acting sulphonylureas. METHODS: A community based study over a 12-year
      period in the population of the city of Basle, Switzerland. The number of
      diabetic patients treated with oral hypoglycaemic agents was established on the
      basis of tablet consumption and a defined daily dose, e.g. 7.5 mg for
      glibenclamide, and 50 mg for glibornuride. RESULTS: Twenty-eight Type 2 diabetic 
      patients were admitted for severe hypoglycaemia, with a median age of 73 years.
      There were no deaths. Sixteen of these admissions were patients treated with
      long-acting sulphonylureas and 12 were patients treated with short-acting forms. 
      Only 23.5% of the population with Type 2 DM in Basle were treated with
      long-acting sulphonylureas. With 30345 person-years of observation, the incidence
      of severe hypoglycaemia was 2.24 per 1000 person-years for long-acting
      sulphonylureas vs. 0.75 per 1000 person-year for short-acting forms, odds ratio
      3.01 (95% confidence interval 1.35-6.77). Decreased food intake (nine patients)
      was a major contributing factor. CONCLUSIONS: Severe hypoglycaemia leading to
      hospital admission is more common in elderly Type 2 diabetic patients treated
      with long-acting compared to short-acting sulphonylureas. Such long-acting
      sulphonylureas should be avoided.

TI  - A comparison of preconstituted, fixed combinations of low-dose glyburide plus
      metformin versus high-dose glyburide alone in the treatment of type 2 diabetic
      patients.
PG  - 61-5
AB  - In the present study we assessed and compared the effectiveness and safety of
      preconstituted, fixed, combinations of low-dose glyburide plus metformin with
      higher-dose glyburide monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes. This
      randomized, double-blind, cross-over study comprised 40 patients. After a 30-day 
      run-in period of dietary treatment, patients received combined glyburide (5, 7.5 
      or 10 mg/day) and metformin (800, 1,200 or 1,600 mg/day) as preconstitued, fixed 
      combinations, or glyburide alone (5, 10 or 15 mg/day). The dose was increased
      stepwise so as to have 1 (T1), 2 (T2) and 3 (T3) months of treatment for any
      given regimen (6 months in total). After 2 weeks of washout (T4), the groups were
      then crossed over (T5, T6, T7 periods). Body weight, fasting plasma glucose,
      HbA(1c), blood lactate, total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides 
      were measured at the beginning and end of T1 and T5, and end of T2, T3, T6 and
      T7; postprandial plasma glucose, fasting and postprandial plasma insulin and
      C-peptide were evaluated at the beginning of T1 and T5, and end of T3 and T7. At 
      these latter time points additional assessments included routine clinical
      chemistry measurements, ECG, and ophthalmoscopic examination. Statistical
      analysis was performed by the paired Student's t-test and analysis of variance
      for cross-over studies. Thirty-three patients completed the study. Fasting plasma
      glucose, postprandial plasma glucose and HbA(1c) levels improved significantly
      during combined treatment with glyburide at lower doses plus metformin. This
      effect was achieved without any major change of insulin and C-peptide
      concentrations. Circulating lactate concentrations increased during the regimen
      including metformin, but they remained well within the reference values for
      normal subjects. Plasma total cholesterol and triglycerides levels remained
      substantielly unchanged throughout the study, whereas HDL-cholesterol
      concentrations increased slightly, but significantly, with glyburide plus
      metformin therapy. Routine clinical chemistry measurements, ECG and
      ophthalmoscopic examinations did not change during the study. These results
      demonstrate that improved metabolic control can be achieved with preconstituted, 
      fixed combinations of low-dose glyburide plus metformin in patients with type 2
      diabetes, compared to higher doses of the sulphonylurea alone.

TI  - Quality of life in type 2 diabetic patients is affected by complications but not 
      by intensive policies to improve blood glucose or blood pressure control (UKPDS
      37). U.K. Prospective Diabetes Study Group.
PG  - 1125-36
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine in patients with type 2 diabetes the effects on quality
      of life (QOL) of therapies for improving blood glucose control and for improving 
      blood pressure (BP) control, diabetic complications, and hypoglycemic episodes.
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed two cross-sectional studies of patients
      enrolled in randomized controlled trials of 1) an intensive blood glucose control
      policy compared with a conventional blood glucose control policy, and 2) a tight 
      BP control policy compared with a less tight BP control policy. Also undertaken
      was a longitudinal study of patients in a randomized controlled trial of an
      intensive blood glucose control policy compared with a conventional blood glucose
      control policy. Subjects' QOL was assessed before or at the time of randomization
      and from 6 months to 6 years after randomization. Two cross-sectional samples of 
      type 2 diabetic patients were randomized to therapies for blood glucose control: 
      1) 2,431 patients, mean age 60, duration from randomization 8.0 years, completed 
      a "specific" questionnaire covering four aspects of QOL, and 2) 3,104 patients,
      mean age 62, duration from randomization 11 years, completed a "generic" QOL
      measure. Of these samples, 628 and 747 patients, respectively, were also
      randomized to therapies for BP control. A sample of 122 non-diabetic control
      subjects, average age 62, were also given the specific questionnaire. A
      longitudinal sample of 374 type 2 diabetic patients randomized to either
      intensive or conventional blood glucose policies, mean age at randomization 52,
      were given the specific questionnaire. Sample-sizes at 6 months and 1, 2, 3, 4,
      5, and 6 years after randomization were 322, 307, 280, 253, 225, 163, and 184,
      respectively. The specific questionnaire assessed specific domains of QOL,
      including mood disturbance (Profile of Mood State), cognitive mistakes (Cognitive
      Failures Questionnaire), symptoms, and work satisfaction; the generic
      questionnaire (EQ5D) assessed general health. Both questionnaires were
      self-administered. RESULTS: The cross-sectional studies showed that allocated
      therapies were neutral in effect, with neither improvement nor deterioration in
      QOL scores for mood, cognitive mistakes, symptoms, work satisfaction, or general 
      health. The longitudinal study also showed no difference in QOL scores for the
      specific domains assessed, other than showing marginally more symptoms in
      patients allocated to conventional than to intensive policy. In the
      cross-sectional studies, patients who had had a macrovascular complication in the
      last year had worse general health, as measured by the generic questionnaire,
      than those without complications, with scale scores median 60 and 78 respectively
      (P = 0.0006) and tariff scores median 0.73 and 0.83 respectively (P = 0.0012);
      more problems with mobility, 64 and 36%, respectively (P < 0.0001); and more
      problems with usual activities, 48 and 28% respectively (P = 0.0023). As measured
      by the specific questionnaire, they also showed reduced vigor (P = 0.0077).
      Patients who had had a microvascular complication in the last year reported more 
      tension (P = 0.0082) and total mood disturbance (P = 0.0054), as measured by the 
      specific questionnaire, than patients without complications. Patients treated
      with insulin who had had two or more hypoglycemic episodes during the previous
      year reported more tension (P = 0.0023), more overall mood disturbance (P =
      0.0009), and less work satisfaction (P = 0.0042), as measured by the specific
      questionnaire, than those with no hypoglycemic attacks, after adjusting for age, 
      duration from randomization, systolic BP, HbA1c, and sex in a multivariate
      polychotomous regression. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with type 2 diabetes,
      complications of the disease affected QOL, whereas therapeutic policies shown to 
      reduce the risk of complications had no effect on QOL. It cannot be discerned
      whether frequent hypoglycemic episodes affect QOL, or whether patients with
      certain p

TI  - A comparison of repaglinide and glibenclamide in the treatment of type 2 diabetic
      patients previously treated with sulphonylureas.
PG  - 165-71
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of repaglinide, a novel oral
      prandial glucose regulator, with that of glibenclamide, an oral hypoglycaemic
      agent, in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: This was a
      14-week, double-blind, parallel-group trail in which a total of 195 type 2
      diabetic patients treated with oral hypoglycaemic agents were randomized to
      receive either repaglinide, administered preprandially three times daily, or
      glibenclamide, given preprandially once or twice daily, as per manufacturer's
      recommendations. RESULTS: By the end of the study, the 2-h postprandial blood
      glucose values were lower in the repaglinide group than in the glibenclamide
      group, with the difference approaching statistical significance (repaglinide, 8.1
      (0.6) mol x l(-1) vs glibenclamide, 9.1 (0.6)mmol x l(-1); P = 0.07). There was
      no statistically significant difference in the mean blood glucose level at the
      end of the study between the two groups (repaglinide, 7.1 (0.5) mmol x l(-1) vs
      glibenclamide, 7.4 (0.5) mmol x l(-1); P = 0.42), and baseline HbA1c values had
      decreased to the same degree in both the repaglinide [7.8% (0.1%) to 7.5% 0.1%)] 
      and the glibenclamide groups [8.0 (0.1%) to 7.6 (0.1%)]. There are no significant
      differences between the repaglinide and glibenclamide treatment groups in the
      levels of fasting blood glucose, fructosamine, fasting C-peptide, insulin and
      proinsulin. Neither treatment group showed any clinically significant changes in 
      blood lipid profiles. Repaglinide and glibenclamide were both well tolerated. No 
      significant differences were observed between the two treatment groups with
      respect to adverse events, including hypoglycaemic episodes and weight change. No
      accumulation of repaglinide was apparent during the maintenance period.
      CONCLUSION: Repaglinide is as well tolerated as glibenclamide and is equally
      effective in the management of type 2 diabetes. Repaglinide may, however, offer
      an improvement in postprandial blood glucose control compared with glibenclamide,
      thereby helping to reduce the relative long-term risk of diabetic complications.

PG  - 2005-12
AB  - CONTEXT: Treatment with diet alone, insulin, sulfonylurea, or metformin is known 
      to improve glycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, but which
      treatment most frequently attains target fasting plasma glucose (FPG)
      concentration of less than 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL) or glycosylated hemoglobin A1c 
      (HbA1c) below 7% is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To assess how often each therapy can
      achieve the glycemic control target levels set by the American Diabetes
      Association. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial conducted between 1977 and 1997.
      Patients were recruited between 1977 and 1991 and were followed up every 3 months
      for 3, 6, and 9 years after enrollment. SETTING: Outpatient diabetes clinics in
      15 UK hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 4075 patients newly diagnosed as having
      type 2 diabetes ranged in age between 25 and 65 years and had a median
      (interquartile range) FPG concentration of 11.5 (9.0-14.4) mmol/L [207 (162-259) 
      mg/dL], HbA1c levels of 9.1% (7.5%-10.7%), and a mean (SD) body mass index of 29 
      (6) kg/m2. INTERVENTIONS: After 3 months on a low-fat, high-carbohydrate,
      high-fiber diet, patients were randomized to therapy with diet alone, insulin,
      sulfonylurea, or metformin. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Fasting plasma glucose and
      HbA1c levels, and the proportion of patients who achieved target levels below 7% 
      HbA1c or less than 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL) FPG at 3, 6, or 9 years following
      diagnosis. RESULTS: The proportion of patients who maintained target glycemic
      levels declined markedly over 9 years of follow-up. After 9 years of monotherapy 
      with diet, insulin, or sulfonylurea, 8%, 42%, and 24%, respectively, achieved FPG
      levels of less than 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL) and 9%, 28%, and 24% achieved HbA1c
      levels below 7%. In obese patients randomized to metformin, 18% attained FPG
      levels of less than 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL) and 13% attained HbA1c levels below
      7%. Patients less likely to achieve target levels were younger, more obese, or
      more hyperglycemic than other patients. CONCLUSIONS: Each therapeutic agent, as
      monotherapy, increased 2- to 3-fold the proportion of patients who attained HbA1c
      below 7% compared with diet alone. However, the progressive deterioration of
      diabetes control was such that after 3 years approximately 50% of patients could 
      attain this goal with monotherapy, and by 9 years this declined to approximately 
      25%. The majority of patients need multiple therapies to attain these glycemic
      target levels in the longer term.

TI  - Effect of repaglinide addition to metformin monotherapy on glycemic control in
      patients with type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 119-24
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of repaglinide in combination with metformin
      with monotherapy of each drug on glycemic control in patients with type 2
      diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 83 patients with type 2
      diabetes who had inadequate glycemic control (HbA1c > 7.1%) when receiving the
      antidiabetic agent metformin were enrolled in this multicenter, double-blind
      trial. Subjects were randomized to continue with their prestudy dose of metformin
      (n = 27), to continue with their prestudy dose of metformin with the addition of 
      repaglinide (n = 27), or to receive repaglinide alone (n = 29). For patients
      receiving repaglinide, the optimal dose was determined during a 4- to 8-week
      titration and continued for a 3-month maintenance period. RESULTS: In subjects
      receiving combined therapy, HbA1c was reduced by 1.4 +/- 0.2%, from 8.3 to 6.9%
      (P = 0.0016) and fasting plasma glucose by 2.2 mmol/l (P = 0.0003). No
      significant changes were observed in subjects treated with either repaglinide or 
      metformin monotherapy in HbA1c (0.4 and 0.3% decrease, respectively) or fasting
      plasma glucose (0.5 mmol/l increase and 0.3 mmol/l decrease respectively).
      Subjects receiving repaglinide either alone or in combination with metformin, had
      an increase in fasting levels of insulin between baseline and the end of the
      trial of 4.04 +/- 1.56 and 4.23 +/- 1.50 mU/l, respectively (P < 0.02).
      Gastrointestinal adverse events were common in the metformin group. An increase
      in body weight occurred in the repaglinide and combined therapy groups (2.4 +/-
      0.5 and 3.0 +/- 0.5 kg, respectively; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Combined metformin 
      and repaglinide therapy resulted in superior glycemic control compared with
      repaglinide or metformin monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes whose
      glycemia had not been well controlled on metformin alone. Repaglinide monotherapy
      was as effective as metformin monotherapy.

TI  - A double-blind randomized comparison of meal-related glycemic control by
      repaglinide and glyburide in well-controlled type 2 diabetic patients.
PG  - 789-94
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to compare diurnal blood glucose excursions
      and the effects of accidental dietary noncompliance in type 2 diabetic patients
      who are well-controlled on either repaglinide or glyburide treatment. RESEARCH
      DESIGN AND METHODS: This single-center double-blind randomized study comprised
      type 2 diabetic patients whose mean fasting blood glucose value after
      repaglinide/glyburide titration and stabilization was in the range of 90-140
      mg/dl. The study consisted of an initial screening day, a titration period of 3
      weeks, a 1-week stabilization period, a study period, and an end-of-study day.
      During the 3-day study period, half the patients of each group received two meals
      on the first day and three meals on the next 2 days, and in the other half, this 
      sequence was reversed. Repaglinide was administered preprandially with each meal,
      and glyburide was administered as recommended in current labeling, i.e., either
      one or two daily doses before breakfast and dinner, regardless of whether lunch
      had been omitted. The diurnal blood glucose excursions on a day in which three
      meals were eaten were compared between the two groups, and the minimum blood
      glucose concentration (BGmin) measurements were compared between lunch and dinner
      on days with three and two meals. RESULTS: Of the 83 randomized patients, 43
      entered into the 3-day study period and completed the trial. The results showed
      no significant differences between the repaglinide and glyburide groups in
      average blood glucose excursions from fasting blood glucose (P = 0.44). The
      influence on the mean BGmin of omitting a meal differed significantly between the
      repaglinide and glyburide groups (P = 0.014). In the latter group, BGmin
      decreased from 77 to 61 mg/dl as a result of omitting lunch, whereas in the
      repaglinide group, BGmin was unchanged for the two-meal day (78 mg/dl) and the
      three-meal day (76 mg/dl). All hypoglycemic events (n = 6) occurred in the
      glyburide group on the two-meal day, in connection with omitting lunch. No
      hypoglycemic events were recorded in the repaglinide group. CONCLUSIONS: These
      results suggest that treatment with repaglinide in well-controlled type 2
      diabetic patients who miss or delay a meal is superior to treatment with
      longer-acting sulfonylurea drugs (such as glyburide) with respect to the risk of 
      hypoglycemic episodes.

TI  - Relationship between fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin:
      potential for false-positive diagnoses of type 2 diabetes using new diagnostic
      criteria.
PG  - 1203-10
AB  - CONTEXT: New criteria for the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus have recently
      been introduced that lowered the diagnostic fasting plasma glucose (FPG)
      concentration from 7.8 to 7.0 mmol/L (140 to 126 mg/dL). OBJECTIVE: To determine 
      if individuals with diabetes diagnosed by the new FPG concentration criterion
      would have excessive glycosylation (elevated hemoglobin [HbA1c] levels).
      DEFINITIONS: We determined the distribution of HbA1c levels in individuals using 
      4 classifications: (1) normal by the new criterion (FPG concentration <6.1 mmol/L
      [110 mg/dL]); (2) impaired fasting glucose by the new criterion (FPG
      concentration of 6.1-6.9 mmol/L [110-125 mg/dL]); (3) diabetes diagnosed solely
      by the new FPG concentration criterion of 7.0 through 7.7 mmol/L (126-139 mg/dL);
      and (4) diabetes diagnosed by the previous FPG concentration criterion of 7.8
      mmol/L (140 mg/dL) or higher. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of 2 large data
      sets (NHANES III and Meta-Analysis Research Group [MRG] on the Diagnosis of
      Diabetes Using Glycated Hemoglobin) that contained individuals in whom FPG
      concentrations, 2-hour glucose concentrations using an oral glucose tolerance
      test, and an HbA1c level were simultaneously measured. We cross-tabulated FPG
      concentrations (<6.1 mmol/L [110 mg/dL], 6.1-6.9 mmol/L [110-125 mg/dL], 7.0-7.7 
      mmol/L [126-139 mg/dL], and > or =7.8 mmol/L [140 mg/dL]) and HbA1c levels
      separated into 3 intervals: normal, less than the upper limit of normal (ULN);
      slightly elevated, ULN to ULN plus 1%; and high, higher than ULN plus 1%.
      RESULTS: Among subjects with normal FPG concentrations, HbA1c levels in the
      NHANES III (and the MRG) data sets were normal in 97.3% (96.2%), slightly
      elevated in 2.7% (3.6%), and high in 0.1% (0.2%). Among individuals with impaired
      fasting glucose, HbA1c concentrations were normal in 86.7% (81.4%), slightly
      elevated in 13.1% (16.4%), and high in 0.2% (2.2%). Among diabetic patients
      diagnosed by the new FPG criterion only, HbA1c levels were normal in 60.9%
      (59.6%), slightly elevated in 35.8% (32.8%), and high in 3.4% (7.6%). In diabetic
      patients diagnosed by the former FPG criterion, HbA1c levels were normal in 18.6%
      (16.7%), slightly elevated in 32.5% (21.0%), and high in 48.9% (62.3%).
      CONCLUSIONS: About 60% of the new cohort of diabetic patients in both data sets
      have normal HbA1c levels. We believe that diabetes should not be diagnosed in
      those with FPG concentrations less than 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL) unless excessive
      glycosylation is evident. Individuals without excessive glycosylation but with
      moderate elevations of FPG concentrations (6.1-7.7 mmol/L [110-139 mg/dL]) should
      be diagnosed as having impaired fasting glucose and treated with an appropriate
      diet and exercise. This diagnostic labeling achieves the goal of early
      intervention without subjecting these persons to the potentially negative
      insurance, employment, social, and psychological consequences of a diagnosis of
      diabetes mellitus.

TI  - A 1-year multicenter randomized double-blind comparison of repaglinide and
      glyburide for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Dutch and German Repaglinide
      Study Group.
PG  - 463-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Repaglinide is a newly developed oral blood glucose-lowering agent
      that exerts its effect by stimulating insulin secretion. This multicenter study
      was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of this drug with glyburide in a 
      1-year randomized double-blind study of outpatients with type 2 diabetes.
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 424 subjects (154 women, 270 men)
      participated and had the following characteristics: age, 61 +/- 9 years; duration
      of diabetes. 8 years (range 0.5-35); BMI, 28.3 +/- 3.5 kg/m2; HbA1c, 7.1 +/-
      1.4%; and fasting plasma glucose, 10.8 +/- 3.1 mmol/l. The majority of the
      subjects (91%) were previously treated with sulfonylurea, alone or in combination
      with metformin. The patients were randomized to a 2:1 ratio of repaglinide (0.5-4
      mg t.i.d.) or glyburide (1.75-10.5 mg daily) treatment. The study protocol
      included a screening visit to assess patient eligibility; a titration period of
      6-8 weeks, during which the dosages of repaglinide and glyburide were optimized; 
      and a subsequent 12-month treatment period on fixed, optimal dosages. RESULTS:
      The trial was completed by 320 subjects, 211 (74%) in the repaglinide and 109
      (78%) in the glyburide group. HbA1c initially decreased in both groups and then
      increased during the second half-year of the maintenance period to a similar
      extent in the repaglinide and glyburide subjects (0.58 and 0.45% vs. at
      screening, respectively). In the small group of subjects who previously
      controlled their condition with diet only (n = 37), a sustained improvement of
      metabolic control could be observed with both drugs, which was slightly better
      with glyburide than with repaglinide (theta HbA1c -2.4 vs. -1.0%; P < 0.05). The 
      same trends were seen with fasting plasma glucose. There were no changes in serum
      lipids. Over the course of the study, 15% of the repaglinide-treated and 13% of
      glyburide-treated subjects withdrew due to adverse events, mostly hyperglycemia. 
      No differences in adverse events between both drugs were reported. There were no 
      differences in incidences of hypoglycemia. CONCLUSIONS: Repaglinide is a safe and
      efficacious oral blood glucose-lowering agent, with a potency similar to that of 
      glyburide. Its rapid onset of action and hepatic clearance allows meal-related
      administration, including in subjects with impaired kidney function.

TI  - Effects of K(ATP) channel blockade by glibenclamide on the warm-up phenomenon.
PG  - 196-202
AB  - AIMS: The increased tolerance to myocardial ischaemia observed during the second 
      of two sequential exercise tests, i.e. the warm-up phenomenon, has been proposed 
      as a clinical model of ischaemic preconditioning. As ATP-sensitive K+ channels
      appear to be a mediator of ischaemic preconditioning in both experimental and
      clinical studies, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of K(ATP)
      channels in the warm-up phenomenon. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-six patients with
      coronary artery disease were randomized to receive 10 mg oral glibenclamide, a
      selective ATP-sensitive K+ channel blocker, or placebo. Sixty minutes after
      glibenclamide or placebo administration, patients were given an infusion of 10%
      dextrose (8 ml x min(-1)) to correct glucose plasma levels or, respectively, an
      infusion of saline at the same infusion rate. Thirty minutes after the beginning 
      of the infusions, both patient groups underwent two consecutive treadmill
      exercise tests, with a recovery period of 15 min to re-establish baseline
      conditions. Before exercise tests, blood glucose levels were similar in placebo
      and glibenclamide groups (96 +/- 10 vs 105 +/- 22 mg x 100 ml(-1), P=ns). After
      placebo administration, rate-pressure product at 1.5 mm ST-segment depression
      significantly increased during the second exercise test compared to the first
      (220 +/- 41 vs 186 +/- 29 beats x min(-1) x mmHg x 10(2), P<0.01), but it did not
      change after glibenclamide (191 +/- 34 vs 187 +/- 42 beats x min(-1) x mmHg x
      10(2), P=ns), with a significant drug-test interaction (P=0.0091, at two-way
      ANOVA). CONCLUSIONS: Glibenclamide, at a dose previously shown to abolish
      ischaemic preconditioning during coronary angioplasty, prevents the increase of
      ischaemic threshold observed during the second of two sequential exercise tests. 
      These findings confirm that ischaemic preconditioning plays a key role in the
      warm-up phenomenon and that in this setting is, at least partially, mediated by
      activation of ATP-sensitive K+ channels.

TI  - Drug-induced hypoglycemic coma in 102 diabetic patients.
PG  - 281-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypoglycemic coma is a continuous threat for diabetic patients
      treated with insulin and/or oral hypoglycemic agents; it may be associated with
      substantial morbidity and mortality. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed our
      clinical experience with drug-induced hypoglycemic coma during a 7-year period.
      RESULTS: The study consisted of 102 patients and included 61 females and 41
      males. The median age was 72 years. Ninety-two patients suffered from type 2
      diabetes mellitus; 10 patients had type 1 diabetes mellitus. The median lowest
      blood glucose level was 1.77 mmol/L (32 mg/dL). Drug-induced hypoglycemic coma
      occurred in 99 patients out of the hospital, while 3 patients developed it during
      hospitalization. Drug-induced hypoglycemic coma occurred in patients undergoing
      treatment with insulin, glyburide, and combined therapy with insulin and
      glyburide, insulin and metformin, or glyburide and metformin. Ninety-three
      patients had at least 1 of the following risk factors: age older than 60 years,
      renal dysfunction, decreased intake of energy, and infection. Fourteen patients
      concomitantly received drugs that potentiated hypoglycemia. Forty patients
      responded to treatment within the first 12 hours, while 62 patients had
      protracted hypoglycemia of 12 to 72 hours' duration. Morbidity included physical 
      injuries in 7 patients, myocardial ischemia in 2 patients, and stroke in 1
      patient. Death occurred in 5 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Hypoglycemic coma is a
      serious and not an uncommon problem among elderly patients with diabetes mellitus
      and treated with insulin and/or oral hypoglycemic drugs. Risk factors contribute 
      substantially to the morbidity and mortality of patients with drug-induced
      hypoglycemic coma. Enhanced therapeutic monitoring may be warranted when
      hypoglycemic drugs are administered to an elderly patient with the above
      predisposing factors and potentiating drugs for hypoglycemia.

TI  - A randomized placebo-controlled trial of repaglinide in the treatment of type 2
      diabetes.
PG  - 1897-903
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to assess the efficacy and safety of
      repaglinide compared with placebo in the treatment of patients with type 2
      diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a phase II multicenter,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, dose-adjustment and maintenance
      trial. After screening and a 2-week washout period, 99 patients were randomized
      to receive either repaglinide (n = 66) or placebo (n = 33). Patients underwent 6 
      weeks of dose adjustment followed by 12 weeks of dose maintenance. Fasting and
      stimulated glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), plasma glucose, insulin, and
      C-peptide were measured at predetermined intervals. Adverse events and
      hypoglycemic episodes were recorded. RESULTS: From baseline to last visit, mean
      HbA1c decreased from 8.5 to 7.8% in patients treated with repaglinide and
      increased from 8.1 to 9.3% in patients receiving placebo, with a statistically
      significant difference of - 1.7% (P < 0.0001) between treatment groups at the
      last visit. Mean fasting plasma glucose and postprandial glucose increased in
      patients receiving placebo and decreased in patients treated with repaglinide,
      with statistically significant (P < 0.01) differences between groups at the last 
      visit. Concentrations of fasting and postprandial insulin and C-peptide were
      lower at the last visit compared with baseline for patients treated with placebo 
      and higher for patients treated with repaglinide, and the differences between
      groups were statistically significant (P < 0.05). Overall, repaglinide was well
      tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that repaglinide was safe and
      efficacious in lowering blood glucose concentrations. In addition to overall
      improvement in glycemic control noted with repaglinide in both
      sulfonylurea-treated patients and oral hypoglycemic agent-naive patients,
      repaglinide had a potent glucose-lowering effect in the postprandial period.

TI  - Intensive blood-glucose control with sulphonylureas or insulin compared with
      conventional treatment and risk of complications in patients with type 2 diabetes
      (UKPDS 33). UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) Group.
PG  - 837-53
AB  - BACKGROUND: Improved blood-glucose control decreases the progression of diabetic 
      microvascular disease, but the effect on macrovascular complications is unknown. 
      There is concern that sulphonylureas may increase cardiovascular mortality in
      patients with type 2 diabetes and that high insulin concentrations may enhance
      atheroma formation. We compared the effects of intensive blood-glucose control
      with either sulphonylurea or insulin and conventional treatment on the risk of
      microvascular and macrovascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes in
      a randomised controlled trial. METHODS: 3867 newly diagnosed patients with type 2
      diabetes, median age 54 years (IQR 48-60 years), who after 3 months' diet
      treatment had a mean of two fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentrations of
      6.1-15.0 mmol/L were randomly assigned intensive policy with a sulphonylurea
      (chlorpropamide, glibenclamide, or glipizide) or with insulin, or conventional
      policy with diet. The aim in the intensive group was FPG less than 6 mmol/L. In
      the conventional group, the aim was the best achievable FPG with diet alone;
      drugs were added only if there were hyperglycaemic symptoms or FPG greater than
      15 mmol/L. Three aggregate endpoints were used to assess differences between
      conventional and intensive treatment: any diabetes-related endpoint (sudden
      death, death from hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia, fatal or non-fatal myocardial 
      infarction, angina, heart failure, stroke, renal failure, amputation [of at least
      one digit], vitreous haemorrhage, retinopathy requiring photocoagulation,
      blindness in one eye, or cataract extraction); diabetes-related death (death from
      myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, renal disease,
      hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia, and sudden death); all-cause mortality. Single
      clinical endpoints and surrogate subclinical endpoints were also assessed. All
      analyses were by intention to treat and frequency of hypoglycaemia was also
      analysed by actual therapy. FINDINGS: Over 10 years, haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was 
      7.0% (6.2-8.2) in the intensive group compared with 7.9% (6.9-8.8) in the
      conventional group--an 11% reduction. There was no difference in HbA1c among
      agents in the intensive group. Compared with the conventional group, the risk in 
      the intensive group was 12% lower (95% CI 1-21, p=0.029) for any diabetes-related
      endpoint; 10% lower (-11 to 27, p=0.34) for any diabetes-related death; and 6%
      lower (-10 to 20, p=0.44) for all-cause mortality. Most of the risk reduction in 
      the any diabetes-related aggregate endpoint was due to a 25% risk reduction
      (7-40, p=0.0099) in microvascular endpoints, including the need for retinal
      photocoagulation. There was no difference for any of the three aggregate
      endpoints between the three intensive agents (chlorpropamide, glibenclamide, or
      insulin). Patients in the intensive group had more hypoglycaemic episodes than
      those in the conventional group on both types of analysis (both p<0.0001). The
      rates of major hypoglycaemic episodes per year were 0.7% with conventional
      treatment, 1.0% with chlorpropamide, 1.4% with glibenclamide, and 1.8% with
      insulin. Weight gain was significantly higher in the intensive group (mean 2.9
      kg) than in the conventional group (p<0.001), and patients assigned insulin had a
      greater gain in weight (4.0 kg) than those assigned chlorpropamide (2.6 kg) or
      glibenclamide (1.7 kg). INTERPRETATION: Intensive blood-glucose control by either
      sulphonylureas or insulin substantially decreases the risk of microvascular
      complications, but not macrovascular disease, in patients with type 2
      diabetes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)

TI  - A placebo-controlled, randomized study of glimepiride in patients with type 2
      diabetes mellitus for whom diet therapy is unsuccessful.
PG  - 636-41
AB  - This multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study of glimepiride, a new oral
      sulfonylurea, was conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes for whom dietary
      treatment was unsuccessful (fasting plasma glucose [FPG] = 151-300 mg/dL) during 
      a 1-week screening period. Patients were randomized to receive glimepiride (n =
      123) or placebo (n = 126) once daily for a 10-week dose-titration period, then
      maintained on an individually determined optimal dose (1-8 mg of glimepiride or
      placebo) for 12 weeks. Glimepiride lowered FPG by 46 mg/dL, hemoglobin A1C
      (HbA1C) by 1.4%, and 2-hour postprandial glucose by 72 mg/dL more than placebo.
      Glimepiride improved postprandial insulin and C-peptide responses without
      producing clinically meaningful increases in fasting insulin or C-peptide levels.
      Good glycemic control (HbA1C < or = 7.2%) was achieved by 69% of the patients
      taking glimepiride versus 32% of those taking placebo. The overall incidence of
      adverse events was similar in both groups. No clinically noteworthy abnormal
      laboratory values or hypoglycemia (blood glucose < 60 mg/dL) occurred.
      Glimepiride is safe and effective for treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes 
      for whom diet therapy is unsuccessful.

TI  - UKPDS 26: Sulphonylurea failure in non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients over
      six years. UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) Group.
PG  - 297-303
AB  - Patients with Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus (DM) on
      sulphonylurea therapy convert to insulin progressively as the sulphonylureas
      'fail'. The rate of failure and the features of those who fail have been poorly
      described. To assess secondary failure rates of sulphonylureas, we report on the 
      responses in 1305 patients with newly diagnosed Type 2 DM randomly allocated to
      therapy with either chlorpropamide or glibenclamide in the UK Prospective
      Diabetes Study (UKPDS). These patients were initially treated by diet for 3
      months and had a fasting plasma glucose > 6 mmol l(-1); mean age 53 (SD 9) years;
      BMI 26.8 (SD 5.0) kg m(-2); and median fasting plasma glucose 9.1 (7.6-12.5
      quartiles) mmol l(-1). If their fasting plasma glucose subsequently rose above
      15.0 mmol l(-1), or they developed hyperglycaemic symptoms, additional
      hypoglycaemic therapy was given: metformin, ultratard insulin, and soluble
      insulin as required. By 6 years, 44% had required additional therapy. Of those
      randomized to glibenclamide, 48% required additional therapy by 6 years, compared
      with 40% of those allocated to chlorpropamide (p < 0.01). Sixty-one per cent,
      39%, and 23%, respectively, of patients with fasting plasma glucose > or = 10.0
      mmol l(-1), > or = 7.8 mmol l(-1) to < 10.0 mmol l(-1) and < 7.8 mmol l(-1) at
      randomization required additional therapy (p < 0.001). In the initial 3 years,
      non-obese subjects (BMI < 30 kg m(-2)) were more likely to require additional
      therapy than obese patients (BMI > or = 30 kg m(-2)) (43% vs 53% at 6 years; p < 
      0.001). Modelled beta-cell function showed that those with lower function were
      more likely to fail (p < 0.0001). Thus sulphonylureas fail as a therapeutic agent
      at rates which are dependent both on the phenotype at presentation and perhaps on
      the agent used initially. Higher failure rates were found in those with higher
      glucose concentrations, those who were younger, those with lower beta-cell
      reserve and those randomized to glibenclamide compared with chlorpropamide.

TI  - Response to intensive therapy steps and to glipizide dose in combination with
      insulin in type 2 diabetes. VA feasibility study on glycemic control and
      complications (VA CSDM).
PG  - 574-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The feasibility study for the VA Cooperative Study on Glycemic Control
      and Complications in Type 2 Diabetes (VA CSDM) prospectively studied 153
      insulin-requiring type 2 diabetes patients, randomized between an intensively
      treated arm and a standard treatment arm during a mean follow-up of 27 months.
      The glycemic response to each of the progressive, sequential phases of insulin
      treatment was assessed, along with the incidence of hypoglycemic reactions and
      the relative efficacy of different doses of glipizide in combination with fixed
      doses of insulin. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Five medical centers participated;
      half of the patients were assigned to the intensive treatment arm aiming for
      normal HbA1c levels. Age of patients was 60 +/- 6 years, duration of diabetes 8
      +/- 3 years, and BMI 30.7 +/- 4 kg/m2. A four-step management technique was used,
      with patients moving to the next step if the operational goals were not met:
      Phase I, evening intermediate or long-acting insulin; phase II, added day-time
      glipizide; phase III, two injections of insulin alone; and phase IV, multiple
      daily insulin injections. Home glucose monitoring measurements were done twice
      daily and at 3:00 A.M. once a week. Hypoglycemic reactions and home glucose
      monitoring results were recorded and counted in each of the treatment phases.
      RESULTS: Baseline HbA1c was 9.3 +/- 1.8%, and fasting plus serum glucose was 11.4
      +/- 3.3 mmol/1. Fasting serum glucose fell to near normal in phase I, and
      remained so in the other treatment phases. An HbA1c separation of 2.1% between
      the arms was maintained during the course of the study, while the intensive arm
      kept HbA1c levels below 7.3% (P = 0.001). Most of the decrease in HbA1c occurred 
      with one injection of insulin alone (phase I, -1.4%) or adding day-time glipizide
      (phase II, -1.9% compared with baseline). HbA1c did not decrease further after
      substituting two injections of insulin alone, with twice the insulin dose.
      Multiple daily injections resulted in an additional HbA1c fall (-2.4% compared
      with baseline). However, two-thirds of the patients were still on one or two
      injections a day at the end of the study. Changes in home glucose monitoring
      levels paralleled those of the HbA1c, as did the increments in number of reported
      hypoglycemic reactions, virtually all either "mild" or "moderate" in character.
      For the combination of glipizide and insulin (phase II), the only significant
      effect was obtained with daily doses up to 10 mg a day; there were no significant
      additional benefits with up to fourfold higher daily doses, and HbA1c levels had 
      an upward trend with doses > 20 mg/day. CONCLUSIONS: A simple regime of a single 
      injection of insulin, alone or with glipizide, seemed sufficient to obtain
      clinically acceptable levels of HbA1c for most obese, insulin-requiring type 2
      diabetes patients. Further decrease of HbA1c demanded multiple daily injections
      at the expense of doubling the insulin dose and the rate of hypoglycemic events. 
      In combination therapy, doses of glipizide > 20 mg/day offered no additional
      benefit.

TI  - Glimepiride. A review of its use in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 563-84
AB  - Glimepiride is a sulphonylurea agent that stimulates insulin release from
      pancreatic beta-cells and may act via extrapancreatic mechanisms. It is
      administered once daily to patients with type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes 
      mellitus in whom glycaemia is not controlled by diet and exercise alone, and may 
      be combined with insulin in patients with secondary sulphonylurea failure. The
      greatest blood glucose lowering effects of glimepiride occur in the first 4 hours
      after the dose. Glimepiride has fewer and less severe effects on cardiovascular
      variables than glibenclamide (glyburide). Pharmacokinetics are mainly unaltered
      in elderly patients or those with renal or liver disease. Few drug interactions
      with glimepiride have been documented. In patients with type 2 diabetes,
      glimepiride has an effective dosage range of 0.5 to 8 mg/day, although there is
      little difference in efficacy between dosages of 4 and 8 mg/day. Glimepiride was 
      similar in efficacy to glibenclamide and glipizide in 1-year studies. However,
      glimepiride appears to reduce blood glucose more rapidly than glipizide over the 
      first few weeks of treatment. Glimepiride and gliclazide were compared in
      patients with good glycaemic control at baseline in a 14-week study that noted no
      differences between their effects. Glimepiride plus insulin was as effective as
      insulin plus placebo in helping patients with secondary sulphonylurea failure to 
      reach a fasting blood glucose target level of < or = 7.8 mmol/L, although lower
      insulin dosages and more rapid effects on glycaemia were seen with glimepiride.
      Although glimepiride monotherapy was generally well tolerated, hypoglycaemia
      occurred in 10 to 20% of patients treated for < or = 1 year and > or = 50% of
      patients receiving concomitant insulin for 6 months. Pooled clinical trial data
      suggest that glimepiride may have a lower incidence of hypoglycaemia than
      glibenclamide, particularly in the first month of treatment. Dosage is usually
      started at 1 mg/day, titrated to glycaemic control at 1- to 2-week intervals to a
      usual dosage range of 1 to 4 mg/day (maximum 6 mg/day in the UK or 8 mg/day in
      the US). CONCLUSIONS: Glimepiride is a conveniently administered alternative to
      other sulphonylureas in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus not well
      controlled by diet alone. Its possible tolerability advantages and use in
      combination with other oral antidiabetic drugs require further study. Glimepiride
      is also reported to reduce exogenous insulin requirements in patients with
      secondary sulphonylurea failure when administered in combination with insulin.

TI  - Modeling all-cause mortality: projections of the impact of smoking cessation
      based on the NHEFS. NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study.
PG  - 630-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A model that relates clinical risk factors to subsequent mortality
      was used to simulate the impact of smoking cessation. METHODS: Survivor functions
      derived from multivariate hazard regressions fitted to data from the first
      National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) Epidemiologic
      Followup Study, a longitudinal survey of a representative sample of US adults,
      were used to project deaths from all causes. RESULTS: Validation tests showed
      that the hazard regressions agreed with the risk relationships reported by
      others, that projected deaths for baseline risk factors closely matched observed 
      mortality, and that the projections attributed deaths to the appropriate levels
      of important risk factors. Projections of the impact of smoking cessation showed 
      that the number of cumulative deaths would be 15% lower after 5 years and 11%
      lower after 20 years. CONCLUSIONS: The model produced realistic projections of
      the effects of risk factor modification on subsequent mortality in adults,
      Comparison of the projections for smoking cessation with estimates of the risk
      attributable to smoking published by the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention suggests that cessation could capture most of the benefit possible
      from eliminating smoking.

TI  - UKPDS 28: a randomized trial of efficacy of early addition of metformin in
      sulfonylurea-treated type 2 diabetes. U.K. Prospective Diabetes Study Group.
PG  - 87-92
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy over 3 years of the addition of metformin to
      maximum sulfonylurea therapy in type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS:
      This multicenter randomized open-controlled trial was conducted in outpatient
      diabetes clinics in 15 U.K. hospitals. A total of 591 subjects who had already
      been randomly allocated to sulfonylurea therapy were taking maximum doses with
      suboptimal glycemic control, i.e., raised fasting plasma glucose (FPG)
      concentrations of 6-15 mmol/l but no significant hyperglycemic symptoms. The main
      outcome measures included FPG, glycated hemoglobin, protocol-defined marked
      hyperglycemia, body weight, blood pressure, fasting plasma lipids, compliance,
      and hypoglycemia and other side effects. RESULTS: After the addition of
      metformin, FPG concentrations decreased by mean (95% CI) -0.47 (-0.82 to -0.13)
      mmol/l over 3 years compared with an increase of 0.44 (0.07-0.81) mmol/l in
      subjects on sulfonylurea alone (P < 0.00001). Median FPG concentrations at 3
      years were 8.6 vs. 9.9 mmol/l, respectively (P < 0.00001), and HbA1c values were 
      7.5 and 8.1%, respectively (P = 0.006). Adjustment for baseline BMI or FPG
      concentration did not affect response to therapy. Only 7% of those allocated to
      sulfonylurea plus metformin developed protocol-defined marked hyperglycemia
      compared with 36% of those allocated to sulfonylurea alone (P < 0.0001). Fasting 
      plasma lipids, body weight, and blood pressure did not change significantly. The 
      incidence of hypoglycemic episodes did not differ between groups: 4% on
      sulfonylurea plus metformin and 2% on sulfonylurea alone (NS). CONCLUSIONS: Early
      addition of metformin improved glycemic control in patients with suboptimal
      glycemic control while taking maximum sulfonylurea therapy, irrespective of
      obesity or baseline FPG concentrations.

TI  - United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study 24: a 6-year, randomized, controlled
      trial comparing sulfonylurea, insulin, and metformin therapy in patients with
      newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes that could not be controlled with diet therapy.
      United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study Group.
PG  - 165-75
AB  - BACKGROUND: Uncertainty exists about the suitability of oral hypoglycemic drugs
      and insulin therapy for patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. OBJECTIVE:
      To assess and compare response to sulfonylurea, insulin, or metformin over 6
      years in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes in whom disease could and 
      could not be controlled with diet therapy alone. DESIGN: Multicenter, randomized,
      controlled trial. SETTING: Outpatient diabetes clinics of 15 hospitals in the
      United Kingdom. INTERVENTION: Sulfonylurea (chlorpropamide or glyburide),
      insulin, or metformin (if patients were obese). PATIENTS: 458 patients with newly
      diagnosed type 2 diabetes that could not be controlled with diet and had
      hyperglycemic symptoms or fasting plasma glucose levels greater than 15 mmol/L
      during the initial 3 months of diet therapy (primary diet failure group) and 1620
      patients in whom disease was controlled by diet therapy and who had fasting
      plasma glucose levels of 6 to 15 mmol/L and no hyperglycemic symptoms while
      receiving diet therapy alone. MEASUREMENTS: Fasting plasma levels of glucose and 
      insulin, hemoglobin A1c concentrations, body weight, and therapy required.
      RESULTS: Compared with the diet-controlled group, the primary diet failure group 
      was younger and less obese and had more retinopathy, lower fasting plasma insulin
      levels, and reduced beta-cell function. At 6 years, patients allocated to insulin
      had lower fasting plasma glucose levels than did patients allocated to oral
      agents, but hemoglobin A1c concentrations were similar. Forty-eight percent (95% 
      CI, 37% to 58%) of patients in the primary diet failure group maintained
      hemoglobin A1c concentrations less than 0.08. By 6 years, 51% of patients (CI,
      42% to 62%) allocated to ultralente insulin required additional short-acting
      insulin and 66% of patients (CI, 58% to 73%) allocated to sulfonylurea required
      additional therapy with metformin or insulin to control symptoms and maintain
      fasting plasma glucose levels less than 15 mmol/L. Patients allocated to insulin 
      gained more weight and had more hypoglycemic attacks than did patients allocated 
      to sulfonylurea. Obese patients allocated to metformin gained the least weight
      and had the fewest hypoglycemic attacks. For all therapies, control achieved at 6
      years was worse in the primary diet failure group than in the diet-controlled
      group. CONCLUSIONS: Because initial insulin therapy induced more hypoglycemic
      reactions and weight gain without necessarily providing better control, it may be
      reasonable to start with oral agents and change to insulin if goals for glycemic 
      levels are not achieved.

TI  - A prospective trial of risk factors for sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycemia in type
      2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 137-43
AB  - CONTEXT: Retrospective studies have identified oral sulfonylureas, age, and
      fasting as major risk factors for hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes. 
      Sulfonylureas may be withheld from elderly patients out of concern for
      hypoglycemia. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the hypoglycemic effects of maximum doses of
      once-daily second-generation sulfonylureas administered to fasting elderly
      patients. DESIGN: A prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial.
      SETTING: The University of New Mexico General Clinical Research Center. PATIENTS:
      Fifty-two sulfonylurea-treated subjects with type 2 diabetes with a mean (SD) age
      of 65.1 (5.7) years. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were randomly assigned to glyburide 
      or glipizide gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS). Each subject
      participated in three 23-hour fasting studies after the sequential administration
      of 1 week of placebo and 1 week of 10 mg and 1 week of 20 mg of the assigned
      sulfonylurea. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Occurrence of hypoglycemia (defined as
      plasma glucose level <3.33 mmol/L [60 mg/dL]) and hormonal parameters during the 
      final 9 hours of the 23-hour fast in patients who had taken sulfonylureas vs
      placebo. RESULTS: No hypoglycemia was observed during 156 fasting studies. Plasma
      glucose level was decreased (nadir, 4.9 mmol/L [88 mg/dL] for a 20-mg dose of
      glyburide vs 8.3 mmol/L [150 mg/dL] for placebo; nadir, 5.8 mmol/L [105 mg/dL]
      for a 20-mg dose of glipizide GITS vs 8.7 mmol/L [157 mg/dL] for placebo), and
      serum insulin was increased in the sulfonylurea studies compared with placebo
      (P<.001). Plasma glucose parameters did not differ between the 2 sulfonylureas,
      but C peptide concentrations were increased in the glyburide group compared with 
      glipizide GITS in the 20-mg study (P=.05). Concentrations of epinephrine were
      increased in the sulfonylurea studies compared with placebo (P<.001). Epinephrine
      secretion increased when glucose concentration fell below the mean (SD) level of 
      9.10 (2.66) mmol/L (164 [48] mg/dL) in the 10-mg study and 8.77 (2.83) mmol/L
      (158 [51] mg/ dL) in the 20-mg study. CONCLUSIONS: Fasting was well tolerated
      among these elderly patients with type 2 diabetes treated with sulfonylureas.
      Older age should not be considered a contraindication to sulfonylurea treatment
      for diabetes. Stimulation of epinephrine secretion at normal or elevated plasma
      glucose levels appears to be the primary mechanism of protection against
      hypoglycemia in this study.

TI  - The influence of bromfenac on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic responses 
      to glyburide in diabetic subjects.
PG  - 783-90
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of bromfenac sodium, a nonnarcotic
      analgesic drug under development, on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of
      glyburide in patients with type II diabetes. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, multiple-dose study with a two-period crossover design.
      PATIENTS: Eleven men and one woman (age 36-64 yrs) whose diabetes was responsive 
      to oral sulfonylurea therapy. INTERVENTIONS: Placebo or bromfenac 50 mg was given
      as a single oral dose 3 times/day for the first 3 days of the study. On days 4-6,
      patients received the alternative treatment. For at least 3 months before and
      during the study, patients took their usual single daily dose of glyburide 10 mg.
      MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Bromfenac concentrations were measured by
      high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection. Glyburide
      concentrations were measured by gas chromatography with nitrogen-phosphorus
      detection. Glycemia was measured repeatedly on day 3 of each treatment.
      Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed with noncompartmental techniques. No
      significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of glyburide or in the
      pharmacodynamic response of serum glucose levels were observed between placebo
      and bromfenac. Intersubject variability of concentrations was modest for
      glyburide and glucose, with a CV of 43% or less. CONCLUSION: Glyburide levels are
      not changed during concomitant administration of bromfenac.

TI  - Glucose tolerance and mortality, including a substudy of tolbutamide treatment.
PG  - 680-6
AB  - Mortality according to glucose tolerance was studied to determine the prognosis
      of impaired glucose tolerance. Among 2500 persons tested in a community screening
      programme in 1962-1965 and followed-up for mortality to the end of 1987,
      age-sex-adjusted mortality rates were 37.9 +/- 1.9, 53.6 +/- 4.2, and 70.1 +/-
      3.6 deaths per 1000 person-years (+/-SE) in those with normal glucose tolerance, 
      impaired glucose tolerance, and diabetes by World Health Organization criteria at
      baseline. Age-sex-adjusted mortality rates due to ischaemic heart disease were
      14.3 +/- 1.1, 16.3 +/- 2.4, and 25.8 +/- 2.0 deaths per 1000 person-years,
      respectively. Using criteria predating those of the World Health Organization 147
      men with abnormal glucose tolerance were entered into a randomized clinical trial
      in which 49 were treated with tolbutamide for approximately 10 years. Those
      treated had lower mortality rates from all causes (mortality rate ratio = 0.66,
      95% confidence interval = 0.39, 1.10) and from ischaemic heart disease (mortality
      rate ratio = 0.42, 95% confidence interval = 0.16, 1.12) than those not receiving
      tolbutamide. Thus mortality rates are increased in persons with impaired glucose 
      tolerance and diabetes, and the small clinical trial suggests that tolbutamide
      may be beneficial in men with abnormal glucose tolerance.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of oral glyburide in subjects with non-insulin-dependent
      diabetes mellitus and renal failure.
PG  - 907-11
AB  - To test the hypothesis that renal failure has no effect on the pharmacokinetics
      of glyburide, five subjects with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) 
      and end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis, and four NIDDM subjects with 
      normal renal function were studied. On days 0, 1, and 15, subjects consumed 33
      carbohydrate grams, and glucose, insulin, and C-peptide were measured for 4
      hours. On day 1, subjects received 3 mg glyburide and measured plasma
      concentrations for 48 hours. On day 3, multiple dosing on 3 mg glyburide daily
      began. On day 15, plasma concentrations were measured for 48 hours. The
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of glyburide, glucose, insulin, and
      C-peptide were determined as well as daily fasting blood glucose. Glucose area
      under the curve (AUC) and daily fasting glucose levels did not change in either
      controls or hemodialysis subjects. The mean serum glyburide blood levels and
      pharmacokinetics did not differ after initial or chronic glyburide administration
      in NIDDM subjects with end-stage renal disease treated with hemodialysis compared
      with controls. Glyburide half-life averaged 3.3 hours in control subjects and 5.0
      hours in hemodialysis subjects. Hemodialysis subjects had increased C-peptide and
      insulin AUC with chronic dosing. Renal failure does not affect the
      pharmacokinetics of 3.0 mg oral glyburide.

TI  - Short-term comparison of once- versus twice-daily administration of glimepiride
      in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 671-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the metabolic effects and frequency of adverse events
      with 6 mg of glimepiride, a new oral sulfonylurea, given both in once- and
      twice-daily dosages to patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
      (NIDDM). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This 15-week study involved 161 subjects
      with NIDDM. Subjects were randomized into two groups. For 4 weeks, group 1
      received glimepiride 3 mg twice daily, and group 2 received glimepiride 6 mg once
      daily. After a 3-week placebo-washout period, twice- and once-daily regimens were
      crossed over for a second 4-week treatment period. Subjects were hospitalized at 
      the end of each placebo or active-treatment phase. Their glucose concentrations
      were recorded at 20 time points over a 24-hour period, and their insulin and
      C-peptide concentrations were recorded at 16 time points over the same period.
      Parameters that were calculated included fasting, 24-hour, and postprandial
      concentrations of glucose, insulin, and C-peptide. RESULTS: One hundred six
      patients were randomized to receive treatment; 94 completed the entire study.
      Existing physiologic mechanisms of glucose control were apparently unimpaired by 
      glimepiride treatment. Insulin concentrations increased more during the
      postprandial glucose peaks than when subjects were fasting. Both twice- and
      once-daily regimens proved equally effective in reducing concentrations of
      fasting, postbreakfast, postlunch, and postdinner plasma glucose.
      Twenty-four-hour mean glucose concentrations showed a slightly greater decrease
      from baseline for the twice-daily regimen; the difference between the regimens
      was statistically significant but not clinically meaningful. The incidence of
      adverse events with glimepiride approximated that obtained with placebo, with
      both groups reporting only one adverse event, headache, in more than 5% of the
      subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Glimepiride is equally effective whether administered once
      or twice daily. Glimepiride seems to stimulate insulin production primarily after
      meals, when plasma glucose concentrations are highest, but controls blood glucose
      throughout the day.

TI  - Glipizide-GITS does not increase the hypoglycemic effect of mild exercise during 
      fasting in NIDDM.
PG  - 992-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study compared the effect of mild exercise while fasting on
      plasma glucose concentrations in subjects with NIDDM treated with
      extended-release glipizide and subjects not taking an oral hypoglycemic agent.
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-five moderately obese subjects with NIDDM
      were randomized to treatment with extended-release glipizide or placebo. After 9 
      weeks of treatment, they fasted overnight, took their study drug, omitted
      breakfast, and exercised on a treadmill for 90 min. Glucose, insulin, and
      C-peptide concentrations were measured before, during, and after exercise.
      RESULTS: On the fasting-exercise day, fasting glucose concentrations were lower
      (153 vs. 241 mg/dl, P < 0.01) and insulin and C-peptide concentrations higher in 
      the extended-release glipizide group. The decrement of glucose from the fasting
      baseline was modest and equivalent in the two groups: 17 vs. 21 mg/dl at the end 
      of exercise and 28 vs. 27 mg/dl after 2 h of recovery. No subject had
      hypoglycemic symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic use of extended-release glipizide
      does not enhance the hypoglycemic effect of fasting plus mild exercise for people
      with NIDDM. Routine lifestyle treatments for NIDDM may be continued during
      ongoing use of this agent.

      patients with NIDDM inadequately controlled by diet alone.
PG  - 687-91
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the therapeutic effects of the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor 
      miglitol (BAY m 1099), the sulfonylurea glibenclamide, and placebo on parameters 
      of metabolic control and safety in patients with NIDDM that is inadequately
      controlled by diet alone. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: After a 4-week placebo
      run-in period, 201 patients in 18 centers in 4 countries were randomized in a
      double-blind manner to miglitol (50 mg t.i.d., followed by 100 mg t.i.d.),
      glibenclamide (3.5 mg q.d/b.i.d.), or placebo for 24 weeks. Efficacy criteria
      were changes from baseline of HbA1c, fasting and postprandial blood glucose and
      insulin levels, body weight, and serum triglycerides. RESULTS: Efficacy was
      assessed in 119 patients who completed the full protocol, and the results were
      similar to those obtained in 186 patients who fulfilled the validity criteria for
      analysis. Compared with placebo, mean baseline-adjusted HbA1c decreased by 0.75% 
      (P = 0.0021) and 1.01% (P = 0.0001) in the miglitol and glibenclamide treatment
      groups, respectively. Blood glucose decreased slightly in the fasting state and
      considerably in the postprandial state in both treatment groups but not in the
      placebo group. Fasting insulin levels increased slightly (NS) in all treatment
      groups; however, postprandial insulin levels decreased with miglitol, while
      increasing markedly with glibenclamide (P = 0.0001 between all treatment groups).
      Gastrointestinal side effects (flatulence and diarrhea) occurred mostly in the
      miglitol-treated patients, while some glibenclamide-treated patients had symptoms
      suggestive of hypoglycemia. CONCLUSIONS: Miglitol monotherapy is effective and
      safe in NIDDM patients. Compared with glibenclamide, it reduced HbA1c less
      effectively and caused more gastrointestinal side effects. On the other hand,
      glibenclamide, unlike miglitol, tended to cause hypoglycemia, hyperinsulinemia,
      and weight gain, which are not desirable in patients with NIDDM.

TI  - Efficacy, safety, and dose-response characteristics of glipizide gastrointestinal
      therapeutic system on glycemic control and insulin secretion in NIDDM. Results of
      two multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials. The Glipizide
      Gastrointestinal Therapeutic System Study Group.
PG  - 597-606
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy, safety, and dose-response characteristics
      of an extended-release preparation of glipizide using the gastrointestinal
      therapeutic system (GITS) on plasma glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and
      insulin secretion to a liquid-mixed meal in NIDDM patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND
      METHODS: Two prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      multicenter clinical trials were performed in 22 sites and 347 patients with
      NIDDM (aged 59 +/- 0.6 years; BMI, 29 +/- 0.3 kg/m2; known diabetes duration, 8
      +/- 0.4 years) were studied. Each clinical trial had a duration of 16 weeks with 
      a 1-week washout, 3-week single-blind placebo phase, 4-week titration to a fixed 
      dose, and 8-week maintenance phase at the assigned dose. In the first trial,
      once-daily doses of 5, 20, 40, or 60 mg glipizide GITS were compared with placebo
      in 143 patients. In the second trial, doses of 5, 10, 15, or 20 mg of glipizide
      GITS were compared with placebo in 204 patients. HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose
      (FPG), insulin, C-peptide, and glipizide levels were determined at regular
      intervals throughout the study. Postprandial plasma glucose (PPG), insulin, and
      C-peptide also were determined at 1 and 2 h after a mixed meal (Sustacal).
      RESULTS: All doses of glipizide GITS in both trials produced significant
      reductions from placebo in FPG (range -57 to -74 mg/dl) and HbA1c (range -1.50 to
      -1.82%). Pharmacodynamic analysis indicated a significant relationship between
      plasma glipizide concentration and reduction in FPG and HbA1c over a dose range
      of 5-60 mg, with maximal efficacy achieved at a dose of 20 mg for FPG and at 5 mg
      for HbA1c. PPG levels were significantly lower, and both postprandial insulin and
      C-peptide levels significantly higher in patients treated with glipizide GITS
      compared with placebo. The percent reduction in FPG was comparable across
      patients with diverse demographic and clinical characteristics, including those
      with entry FPG > or = 250 mg/dl, resulting in greater absolute decreases in FPG
      and HbA1c in patients with the most severe hyperglycemia. Despite the forced
      titration to a randomly assigned dose, only 11 patients in both studies
      discontinued therapy because of hypoglycemia. Glipizide GITS did not alter lipids
      levels or produce weight gain. CONCLUSIONS: The once-daily glipizide GITS 1)
      lowered HbA1c, FPG, and PPG over a dose range of 5-60 mg, 2) was maximally
      effective at 5 mg (using HbA1c) or 20 mg (using FPG) based on pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic relationships, 3) maintained its effectiveness in poorly
      controlled patients (those with entry FPG > or = 250 mg/dl), 4) was safe and well
      tolerated in a wide variety of patients with NIDDM, and 5) did not produce weight
      gain or adversely affect lipids.

TI  - NIDDM: a rapid progressive disease. Results from a long-term, randomised,
      comparative study of insulin or sulphonylurea treatment.
PG  - 1629-33
AB  - The objective of the present study was to assess the relative efficacy of insulin
      or glibenclamide treatment for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM)
      over 42 months. We performed a randomised, controlled trial allocating patients
      treated with diet and oral antihyperglycaemic agents to treatment with
      glibenclamide or insulin to achieve HbAlc levels under 7.5%. We included 36
      subjects with established NIDDM of more than 2 years' duration. Mean HbAlc levels
      were significantly reduced in patients allocated to insulin treatment from 9.1
      +/- 1.4% before the start to 7.8 +/- 1.3% (p < 0.05) after 1 year, and did not
      change significantly thereafter throughout the study period. Mean HbAlc levels
      increased during the study in the patients allocated to glibenclamide treatment, 
      and 11 of 18 patients had to be switched to insulin treatment due to increasing
      hyperglycaemia (HbAlc > 10%). Mean body weight increased in the subjects
      allocated to insulin by 7.2 +/- 4.1 kg during the study period. In conclusion,
      insulin was more effective than glibenclamide treatment in obtaining control over
      hyperglycaemia in these patients, and once improved, glycaemic control did not
      deteriorate over 42 months in the insulin-treated group. Two thirds of the
      patients allocated to glibenclamide treatment had to be given insulin due to
      inadequate glycaemic control.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and safety of glimepiride at clinically effective doses in
      diabetic patients with renal impairment.
PG  - 1617-24
AB  - The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of glimepiride were investigated in a
      single- and a multiple-dose open study in patients with non-insulin-dependent
      diabetes mellitus and renal impairment and an initial creatinine clearance above 
      10 ml/ min. Patients were divided into three groups with creatinine clearance
      above 50 ml/min, 20-50 ml/min and under 20 ml/min. Fifteen fasting patients
      received a single dose of 3 mg glimepiride and serial blood and urine samples
      were taken over 24 h for pharmacokinetic and efficacy analyses. A further 16
      patients received glimepiride over a 3-month period, an initial dose of 1 mg
      glimepiride being adjusted within the range 1 to 8 mg to achieve good glucose
      control. Pharmacokinetic evaluation was done on day 1 and after 3 months. Mean
      relative total clearance and mean volume of distribution of both single (41.6 ml/
      min and 8.47 litres, respectively, when creatinine clearance was above 50 ml/min)
      and multiple doses of glimepiride increased in proportion to the degree of renal 
      impairment (to 91.1 ml/min and 14.98 litres, respectively, when creatinine
      clearance was below 20 ml/min, single dose), whereas the terminal halflife and
      mean time remained unchanged. Lower relative total clearance and renal clearance 
      of both glimepiride metabolites correlated significantly with lower creatinine
      clearance values. Of the 16 patients 12 required between 1 and 4 mg glimepiride
      to stabilize their fasting blood glucose. Glimepiride was well-tolerated and
      there were no drug-related adverse events. In conclusion glimepiride is safe,
      effective and has clearly-definable pharmacokinetics in diabetic patients with
      renal impairment. The increased plasma elimination of glimepiride with decreasing
      kidney function is explainable on the basis of altered protein binding with an
      increase in unbound drug.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of two daily doses of the new
      sulfonylurea, glimepiride (Amaryl), each as a once-daily dose or in two divided
      doses, in patients with NIDDM. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Of the previously
      treated NIDDM patients, 416 entered this multicenter randomized double-blind
      placebo-controlled fixed-dose study. After a 3-week placebo washout, patients
      received a 14-week course of placebo or glimepiride 8 mg q.d., 4 mg b.i.d., 16 mg
      q.d., or 8 mg b.i.d. RESULTS: Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and HbA1c values were 
      similar at baseline in all treatment groups. The placebo group's FPG value
      increased from 13.0 mmol/l at baseline to 14.5 mmol/l at the last evaluation
      endpoint (P < or = 0.001). In contrast, FPG values in the four glimepiride groups
      decreased from a range of 12.4-12.9 mmol/l at baseline to a range of 8.6-9.8
      mmol/l at endpoint (P < or = 0.001, within-group change from baseline; P < or =
      0.001, between-group change [vs. placebo] from baseline). Two-hour postprandial
      plasma glucose (PPG) findings were consistent with FPG findings. In the placebo
      group, the HbA1c value increased from 7.7% at baseline to 9.7% at endpoint (P <
      or = 0.001), whereas HbA1c values for the glimepiride groups were 7.9-8.1% at
      baseline and 7.4-7.6% at endpoint (P < or = 0.001, within-group change from
      baseline; P < or = 0.001, between-group change from baseline). There were no
      meaningful differences in glycemic variables between daily doses of 8 and 16 mg
      or between once- and twice-daily dosing. Adverse events and laboratory data
      demonstrate that glimepiride has a favorable safety profile. CONCLUSIONS:
      Glimepiride is an effective and well-tolerated oral glucose-lowering agent. The
      results of this study demonstrate maximum effectiveness can be achieved with 8 mg
      q.d. of glimepiride in NIDDM subjects.

AB  - The Diabetes Control and Complications Study has shown that improved blood
      glucose control would delay the progress of microvascular complications of
      diabetes. However, in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, the 
      major morbidity and mortality arises from premature cardiovascular disease. It is
      uncertain whether therapy aimed to improve diabetes control will prevent
      cardiovascular complications, and whether the available therapies, sulphonylurea,
      biguanides or insulin, may even have long-term deleterious side-effects. The UK
      Prospective Diabetes Study started in 1977 and is evaluating whether long-term
      therapy to improve glucose control would be advantageous in clinical practice.
      The study has demonstrated that it is difficult to maintain improved glucose
      control because of the progressive beta-cell dysfunction. The study is also
      evaluating whether improved control of hypertension would be advantageous. The
      progress of the study is summarized. The results are expected to be published in 
      1998.

TI  - The influence of multiple dosing and age on the pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of glipizide in patients with type II diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 760-8
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of
      glipizide after a single dose and 12 weeks of dosing in patients with type II
      diabetes mellitus, and evaluate the influence of aging. DESIGN: Comparison of
      single and multiple doses of glipizide. SETTING: University-affiliated outpatient
      internal medicine clinic and diabetes care unit. PATIENTS: Twenty patients (11
      men, 9 women, mean age 55.2 +/- 9.9 yrs) with type II diabetes mellitus who were 
      currently receiving oral hypoglycemic agents or were hyperglycemic with diet.
      INTERVENTIONS: A 24-hour pharmacokinetic evaluation of glipizide was assessed
      after a 5-mg dose at the start of therapy and after 12 weeks of therapy.
      Pharmacokinetic parameters were assessed using compartmental population analysis 
      techniques. Glipizide pharmacodynamic evaluation was assessed by serum glucose,
      insulin, and C-peptide responses during a 4-hour Sustacal tolerance test
      performed at baseline before instituting glipizide therapy, with the first 5-mg
      dose, and at week 12 of therapy. Glipizide dosages were titrated to a targeted
      goal of fasting plasma glucose of 7.8 mmol/L or less or to reach maximum daily
      doses of 40 mg. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: No significant differences in time
      to peak concentration, apparent volumes of distribution for the central and
      peripheral compartments, apparent oral clearance from the central compartment,
      distributional clearance between the central and peripheral compartments, or
      terminal elimination half-life were observed with a single dose and long-term
      dosing. The mean +/- SD terminal elimination half-lives were 9.67 +/- 5.6 and
      9.35 +/- 4.6 hours after a single dose and 12 weeks, respectively. Fasting plasma
      glucose concentrations decreased from 12.3 +/- 3.6 mmol/L before the first dose
      of glipizide to 9.2 +/- 1.7 mmol/L after 12 weeks of treatment. The values for
      area under the serum concentration-time curve from zero to 4 hours for glucose
      (AUC0-4.glucose) were significantly reduced at week 12 (baseline 49.8 +/- 15.6,
      week 12 37.8 +/- 9.8 mmol/L/hr). Glipizide provoked an increase in serum insulin 
      and C-peptide concentrations (AUC0-4.insulin: baseline 698 +/- 327, single dose
      954 +/- 461, long-term dosing 945 +/- 600 pmol/L/hr). No significant change in
      insulin response was observed between single and multiple doses. No age-related
      differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters or the pharmacodynamic responses of
      glipizide were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term dosing and aging have little
      effect on the pharmacokinetic profile of glipizide. In addition, glipizide
      stimulates insulin secretion to a similar extent following glucose challenge
      after a single dose and long-term administration.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of oral antihyperglycaemic agents in patients with renal
      insufficiency.
PG  - 111-9
AB  - This paper reviews the effects of renal insufficiency on the pharmacokinetics of 
      oral antidiabetic drugs. Of the 3 groups of drugs currently available for the
      treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), the sulphonylureas 
      and metformin are, in general, well-tolerated and generally safe. In patients
      with chronic renal insufficiency, however, care must be exercised in the use of
      many of these drugs, as accumulation, either of the active drug or of active
      metabolites, can lead to serious adverse effects such as hypoglycaemia or, with
      metformin, lactic acidosis. The sulphonylurea drugs, to a greater or lesser
      degree, are metabolised in the liver to a variety of active or inactive compounds
      which, in general, are excreted by the kidneys. In addition, varying amounts of
      parent compound may depend on renal elimination. As a result, sulphonylurea drugs
      such as tolazamide, acetohexamide, chlorpropamide and glibenclamide (glyburide)
      are more likely to cause significant hypoglycaemia, as the metabolism of these
      drugs, compared with other commonly prescribed sulphonylureas, can lead to the
      accumulation of either the parent drug or the active metabolite in the presence
      of renal insufficiency. Tolbutamide, glipizide, gliclazide and gliquidone are
      much less likely to cause hypoglycaemia as their metabolites are either inactive 
      or have minimal hypoglycaemic potency. Metformin is dependent on renal excretion 
      and is not significantly metabolised. As a result, caution is required when
      treating patients with renal insufficiency where metformin accumulation can
      occur, with the danger of lactic acidosis. Although the correlation between
      creatinine clearance (CLCR) and total oral clearance of drug is weaker than the
      correlation between CLCR and renal clearance (CLR) of metformin, it is clear that
      renal insufficiency is associated with most cases of metformin-induced lactic
      acidosis. For this reason, clinicians in general would regard a raised plasma
      creatinine as a contraindication to metformin treatment. Acarbose, an
      alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, and a relatively new agent for treating NIDDM, is
      likely to be safe in patients with impaired renal function, as the drug is not
      significantly absorbed from the gut, but data on this subject are lacking.

TI  - A dose-response study of glimepiride in patients with NIDDM who have previously
      received sulfonylurea agents. The Glimepiride Protocol #201 Study Group.
PG  - 849-56
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy, safety, and dose-response relationship of
      glimepiride in patients with NIDDM. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: After a 21-day
      placebo washout period, 304 patients were randomized to receive either placebo or
      glimepiride, 1, 4, or 8 mg once daily. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-h
      postprandial glucose (PPG), and HbA1c were measured at predetermined intervals
      during the washout period and the 14-week study. Adverse events were tabulated.
      RESULTS: At each patient visit, reduction from baseline FPG was greater in each
      glimepiride group than in the placebo group (P < 0.001). Changes from baseline to
      endpoint after 1, 4, and 8 mg glimepiride exceeded those after placebo (P <
      0.001) by 2.4, 3.9, and 4.1 mmol/l, respectively, for FPG; by 1.2, 1.8, and 1.9
      percentage points, respectively, for HbA1c; and by 3.5, 5.1, and 5.2 mmol/l,
      respectively, for 2-h PPG. Greater reductions in these parameters were observed
      with 8 and 4 mg than with 1 mg (P < 0.05), indicating a dose-response
      relationship. When patients with baseline HbA1c levels > or = 8% were assessed,
      more patients who received 8 mg glimepiride had HbA1c values < 8% at endpoint
      compared with patients receiving 4 mg. Glimepiride had a favorable safety
      profile. CONCLUSIONS: Glimepiride in 1-, 4-, or 8-mg doses was effective and well
      tolerated. Although the 4- and 8-mg once-daily doses were significantly more
      potent than the 1-mg dose, all three doses yielded clinical improvement. Because 
      the 8-mg dose controlled HbA1c values in a greater number of patients with high
      baseline HbA1c levels than did the 4-mg dose, this higher dose might be
      beneficial for patients who are difficult to treat.

TI  - Sulphonylurea treatment of NIDDM patients with cardiovascular disease: a mixed
      blessing?
PG  - 503-14
AB  - Non-insulin-dependent diabetic (NIDDM) patients show a high incidence of
      cardiovascular disease, with greater risk of recurrent myocardial infarction and 
      a less favourable clinical outcome than non-diabetic patients. The majority of
      NIDDM patients are treated with sulphonylurea (SU) derivatives. In the 1970's the
      University Group Diabetes Program concluded that tolbutamide treatment caused
      increased cardiovascular mortality; the study, which led to curtailment of oral
      antidiabetic treatment in the USA, was received with scepticism in Europe. Later 
      criticism of its methodology reduced the impact of the study; however, the
      question of the safety of SU in NIDDM patients with cardiovascular disease has
      been re-opened in the face of new experimental data. The heart and vascular
      tissues do have prerequisites for SU action, i.e. SU receptors and ATP-dependent 
      K+ (K+ATP) channels. These channels play an important role in the protection of
      the myocardium against ischaemia-reperfusion damage, and their closure by SU
      could lead to amplified ischaemic damage. Here we review evidence from animal and
      human studies for deleterious SU effects on ischaemia-induced myocardial damage, 
      either by direct action or through diminished cardioprotective preconditioning.
      Closure of K+ATP channels by SU can lead to reduction of post-infarct
      arrhythmias; the drug has also been claimed to improve various atherosclerosis
      risk factors. The evidence for these beneficial effects of SU is also reviewed.
      We look at the major difficulties that hamper transfer of information from
      experimental studies to clinical decision-making: a) The affinity of SU for heart
      K+ATP channels is orders of magnitude lower than for beta-cell channels; is it
      reasonable to expect in vivo cardiac effects with therapeutic 'pancreatic' SU
      doses? b) Most studies utilized high doses of acutely administered SU; are
      effects similar in the chronic steady-state of the SU-treated diabetic patient?
      c) Convincing SU effects have been demonstrated in acutely induced ischaemia by
      acutely administering the drug; do such effects persist in the clinical situation
      of gradually progressive ischaemia? d) Ischaemia and modification of K+ATP
      channel activity induce complex events, some with opposing effects; what is the
      net result of SU action, and do different SU derivatives lead to different
      outcomes? e) In the chronic (and hence clinically relevant) situation, how can
      direct (deleterious or beneficial) SU effects be separated from beneficial
      effects mediated by the metabolic action of the drug? Only large prospective
      clinical studies, making use of advanced technology for assessment of
      cardiovascular function, can answer these questions. Millions of NIDDM patients
      are treated with SU derivatives; many are in the age group where cardiovascular
      risks are extremely high. The question of whether SU derivatives are beneficial
      or deleterious for these patients must finally be settle unequivocally.

TI  - The effects of obesity on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of glipizide 
      in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 6-13
AB  - The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of glipizide were evaluated in 20
      patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). The group
      consisted of 12 obese subjects (seven women, five men; mean +/- SD age, 53.5 +/- 
      8.5 years; total body weight (TBW), 95.5 +/- 17.2 kg; percentage > IBW (ideal
      body weight), 57.8 +/- 31.7%); and eight nonobese subjects (two women, six men;
      age, 57.8 +/- 11.7 years; TBW, 80.8 +/- 9.9 kg; percentage > IBW, 15.6 +/-
      10.3%). After a 2-week antidiabetic drug-free period, patients were started on
      glipizide therapy for 12 weeks. Glipizide dosages were titrated to achieve
      specified therapeutic goals or a maximum daily dose of 40 mg. Glipizide
      pharmacokinetics were assessed by serum concentrations obtained during a 24-h
      pharmacokinetic evaluation performed after the first 5-mg dose (SD) and after 12 
      weeks of chronic therapy (CD). Glipizide pharmacodynamics were evaluated with
      serum glucose, insulin, and C-peptide responses to Sustacal tolerance test done
      at baseline, after SD, and after CD. No statistically significant differences in 
      the SD pharmacokinetic parameters (Tmax = 3.1 +/- 1.2 vs. 2.8 +/- 1.6 h; Cmax =
      332.5 +/- 92.5 vs. 420.8 +/- 142 g/L; area under the curve extrapolated to
      infinity (AUCI) = 2,598.3 +/- 1,148 vs. 3,138.9 +/- 1,847 g/h/L; oral
      clearance/bioavailability (CL/F), 2.3 +/- 1.0 vs. 2.0 +/- 1.0 L/h; volume of
      distribution/bioavailability (V/F), 19.5 +/- 4.4 vs. 17.2 +/- 4.3 L; t1/2 = 5.0
      +/- 2.3 vs. 5.2 +/- 2.0 h) were observed between the obese and nonobese groups,
      respectively. The pharmacokinetic parameters assessed under CD conditions were
      also closely matched in the two groups. No differences in glucose responses to
      Sustacal challenge at baseline, SD, and CD (AUC0-->4.glucose:baseline, 52.3 +/-
      18.0 vs. 44.9 +/- 9.8; SD, 50.4 +/- 20.9 vs. 36.1 +/- 11.0; CD, 37.8 +/- 10.7 vs.
      36.6 +/- 8.5 mM/h) were noted between the obese and nonobese groups,
      respectively. However, glucose concentrations increased more and decreased to a
      smaller extent after SD in the obese as compared to nonobese subjects. Mean
      fasting serum insulin and C-peptide concentrations were not statistically
      different between the two groups. However, obese subjects exhibited higher
      fasting insulin (114.0 +/- 69 vs. 68.8 +/- 52 pM) at week 12 evaluation and
      C-peptide concentrations (0.83 +/- 0.2 vs. 0.63 +/- 0.2 nM) after SD as compared 
      to the nonobese group. A smaller percentage increase in C peptide in response to 
      Sustacal challenge was observed in the obese compared to the nonobese subjects
      (baseline, 60 +/- 25 vs. 117 +/- 117; SD, 119 +/- 39 vs. 193 +/- 149; and CD, 97 
      +/- 56 vs. 163 +/- 67%). In summary, the influence of obesity on glipizide
      pharmacokinetics appeared to be of little clinical significance. The observed
      differences in pharmacodynamics require further evaluation.

      glyburide in healthy subjects.
PG  - 20-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of aspirin and ibuprofen on the
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of glyburide in healthy volunteers. DESIGN:
      Single-center, randomized, two-way, crossover design following an initial
      baseline evaluation phase. SETTING: Outpatient, university-based ambulatory care 
      facility. PATIENTS: Sixteen healthy nonsmoking men aged 20-34 years.
      INTERVENTION: Three phases consisting of six treatments. Phase 1 began with
      treatment A, a baseline oral glucose tolerance test (GTT), followed by treatment 
      B, glyburide 5 mg plus a GTT. The other two phases were administered in a
      crossover design. Phase 2 consisted of the administration of aspirin 975 mg qid
      for 4 days. On day 3 a GTT was administered (treatment C) and on day 4 glyburide 
      5 mg plus a GTT was administered (treatment E). Phase 3 consisted of the
      administration of ibuprofen 600 mg qid for 4 days with a GTT on day 3 (treatment 
      D) and glyburide 5 mg plus a GTT on day 4 (treatment F). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
      Serum glyburide concentrations after each treatment, as well as glucose and
      insulin, ibuprofen, and salicylate serum concentrations and glyburide free
      fractions. RESULTS: Aspirin administration resulted in an 85% increase in mean
      total glyburide oral clearance and a 29% increase in glyburide free fraction.
      Ibuprofen administration resulted in a slight increase in mean glyburide free
      fraction, but no significant changes in glyburide pharmacokinetic parameters were
      observed. Insulin concentrations were increased during the glyburide plus aspirin
      treatment. Conflicting results were observed in the glucose parameters.
      CONCLUSIONS: The potential for this glyburide-aspirin interaction resulting in a 
      transient hypoglycemia should be considered in diabetic patients receiving
      glyburide therapy.

TI  - United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study 17: a 9-year update of a randomized,
      controlled trial on the effect of improved metabolic control on complications in 
      non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 136-45
AB  - PURPOSE: To report the progress (after 9-year follow-up) of a study designed to
      determine whether improved glucose control in patients with newly diagnosed
      non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is effective in reducing the
      incidence of clinical complications. DATA SOURCE: A multicenter, randomized,
      controlled trial of different therapies for NIDDM. After initial diet therapy,
      4209 asymptomatic patients who remained hyperglycemic (fasting plasma glucose
      levels, 6.0 to 15.0 mmol/L) were assigned to either a conventional therapy
      policy, primarily with diet alone, or to an intensive therapy policy, aiming for 
      fasting plasma glucose levels of less than 6.0 mmol/L, with assignment to primary
      therapy with sulfonylurea or insulin (which increased insulin supply) or
      metformin (which enhanced insulin sensitivity). RESULTS: All three modes of
      pharmacologic therapy in the intensively treated group-sulfonylurea, insulin, and
      metformin-had similar efficacy in reducing the fasting plasma glucose and
      glycated hemoglobin levels. Over 9 years, patients assigned to intensive therapy 
      with sulfonylurea or insulin had lower fasting plasma glucose levels (median, 7.3
      and 9.0 mmol/L, respectively) than patients assigned to conventional therapy.
      Regardless of the assigned therapy, however, the fasting plasma glucose and
      hemoglobin A1c levels increased, and maintaining near-normal glycemia was, in
      general, not feasible. Even insulin therapy did not achieve the therapeutic goal 
      of near-normal glycemia because of the difficulty in treating marked
      hyperglycemia and the risk for hypoglycemic episodes. Nine years after the
      diagnosis of diabetes, 29% of the patients had had a diabetes-related clinical
      end point, 20% had had a macrovascular complication, and 9% had had a
      microvascular complication. CONCLUSIONS: A report will be published in 1998 after
      a median duration from randomization of 11 years (range, 6 to 20 years) with an
      81% power at a 1% level of significance of detecting whether the obtained
      improvement in glucose control causes a 15% decrease or increase in the incidence
      of major complications and whether any specific therapy is advantageous or
      disadvantageous.

TI  - A novel mechanism of glipizide sulfonylurea action: decreased metabolic clearance
      rate of insulin.
PG  - 273-8
AB  - To examine whether sulfonylureas inhibit the metabolic clearance rate (MCR) of
      insulin, 19 healthy young subjects participated in two experiments. In the first 
      protocol (n = 10), a 3-h oral glucose load was performed with and without 2 mg of
      glipizide given 30 min before glucose ingestion. The total insulin response was
      60% greater with than without glipizide (5.9 +/- 0.6 vs 3.7 +/- 0.5 microU/ml; P 
      < 0.001). However, the total C-peptide responses were virtually identical (4.7
      +/- 0.5 vs 4.8 +/- 0.4 nmol/l) in both studies. In the second protocol (n = 9),
      the MCR of insulin was measured during 4-h euglycemic insulin clamps performed
      with and without glipizide. In the study with glipizide, the subjects ingested 5 
      mg of glipizide at 120 min. The steady-state plasma insulin concentration during 
      the 4th h, i.e., 1-2 h after glipizide ingestion, was significantly higher than
      during the 2nd h, i.e., before glipizide ingestion (99 +/- 22 vs 78 +/- 17
      microU/ml; P < 0.01). In addition, glucose uptake during the 4th h was greater
      (8.0 +/- 1.6 vs 6.4 +/- 1.5 mg/kg.min) and the MCR of insulin was reduced (503
      +/- 126 vs 621 +/- 176 ml/m2.min; P < 0.01). We conclude that glipizide augments 
      plasma insulin levels both by enhancing its secretion and by decreasing the MCR
      of insulin.

TI  - U.K. prospective diabetes study 16. Overview of 6 years' therapy of type II
      diabetes: a progressive disease. U.K. Prospective Diabetes Study Group.
PG  - 1249-58
AB  - The objective of the U.K. Prospective Diabetes Study is to determine whether
      improved blood glucose control in type II diabetes will prevent the complications
      of diabetes and whether any specific therapy is advantageous or disadvantageous. 
      The study will report in 1998, when the median duration from randomization will
      be 11 years. This report is on the efficacy of therapy over 6 years of follow-up 
      and the overall incidence of diabetic complications. Subjects comprised 4,209
      newly diagnosed type II diabetic patients who after 3 months' diet were
      asymptomatic and had fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 6.0-15.0 mmol/l. The study
      consists of a randomized controlled trial with two main comparisons: 1) 3,867
      patients with 1,138 allocated to conventional therapy, primarily with diet, and
      2,729 allocated to intensive therapy with additional sulfonylurea or insulin,
      which increase insulin supply, aiming for FPG < 6 mmol/l; and 2) 753 obese
      patients with 411 allocated to conventional therapy and 342 allocated to
      intensive therapy with metformin, which enhances insulin sensitivity. In the
      first comparison, in 2,287 subjects studied for 6 years, intensive therapy with
      sulfonylurea and insulin similarly improved glucose control compared with
      conventional therapy, with median FPG at 1 year of 6.8 and 8.2 mmol/l,
      respectively (P < 0.0001). and median HbA1c of 6.1 and 6.8%, respectively (P <
      0.0001). During the next 5 years, the FPG increased progressively on all
      therapies (P < 0.0001) with medians at 6 years in the conventional and intensive 
      groups, FPG 9.5 and 7.8 mmol/l, and HbA1c 8.0 and 7.1%, respectively. The
      glycemic deterioration was associated with progressive loss of beta-cell
      function. In the second comparison, in 548 obese subjects studied for 6 years,
      metformin improved glucose control similarly to intensive therapy with
      sulfonylurea or insulin. Metformin did not increase body weight or increase the
      incidence of hypoglycemia to the same extent as therapy with sulfonylurea or
      insulin. A high incidence of clinical complications occurred by 6-year follow-up.
      Of all subjects, 18.0% had suffered one or more diabetes-related clinical
      endpoints, with 12.1% having a macrovascular and 5.7% a microvascular endpoint.
      Sulfonylurea, metformin, and insulin therapies were similarly effective in
      improving glucose control compared with a policy of diet therapy. The study is
      examining whether the continued improved glucose control, obtained by intensive
      therapy compared with conventional therapy (median over 6 years HbA1c 6.6%
      compared with 7.4%), will be clinically advantageous in maintaining health.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: It is not clear whether intensive pharmacological therapy can be
      effectively sustained in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). The
      relative risks and benefits of intensive insulin therapy in NIDDM are not well
      defined. Accordingly, we designed a feasibility study that compared standard
      therapy and intensive therapy in a group of NIDDM men who required insulin due to
      sustained hyperglycemia. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A prospective trial was
      conducted in five medical centers in 153 men of 60 +/- 6 years of age who had a
      known diagnosis of diabetes for 7.8 +/- 4 years. They were randomly assigned to a
      standard insulin treatment group (one morning injection per day) or to an
      intensive therapy group designed to attain near-normal glycemia and a clinically 
      significant separation of glycohemoglobin from the standard arm. A four-step plan
      was used in the intensive therapy group along with daily self-monitoring of
      glucose: 1) an evening insulin injection, 2) the same injection adding daytime
      glipizide, 3) two injections of insulin alone, and 4) multiple daily injections. 
      Patient accrual and adherence, glycohemoglobin (HbA1c), side effects, and
      measurements of endpoints for a prospective long-term trial were assessed.
      RESULTS: Accrual goals were met, mean follow-up time was 27 months (range 18-35
      months), and patients kept 98.6% of scheduled visits. After 6 months, the mean
      HbA1c in the intensive therapy group was at or below 7.3% and remained 2% lower
      than the standard group for the duration of the trial. Most of the decrease in
      the mean HbA1c in the intensive group was obtained by a single injection of
      evening intermediate insulin, alone or with daytime glipizide. By the end of the 
      trial, 64% of the patients had advanced to two or more injections of insulin a
      day, aiming for normal HbA1c. However, only a small additional fall in HbA1c was 
      attained. Severe hypoglycemia was rare (two events per 100 patients per year) and
      not significantly different between the groups, nor were changes in weight, blood
      pressure, or plasma lipids. There were 61 new cardiovascular events in 40
      patients and 10 deaths (6 due to cardiovascular causes). CONCLUSIONS: Intense
      stepped insulin therapy in NIDDM patients who have failed glycemic control on
      pharmacological therapy is effective in maintaining near-normal glycemic control 
      for > 2 years without excessive severe hypoglycemia, weight gain, hypertension,
      or dyslipidemia. Cardiovascular event rates are high at this stage of NIDDM. A
      long-term prospective trial is needed to assess the risk-benefit ratio of
      intensified treatment of hyperglycemia in NIDDM patients requiring insulin.

      doses.
PG  - 465-71
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of
      glipizide given as a single, oral, 20-mg dose, versus three different
      divided-dose regimens totaling 20 mg each. DESIGN: Randomized (in order of dosing
      regimens), open-label, crossover study. SETTING: University medical center
      clinical research center. PATIENTS: Six subjects with noninsulin-dependent
      diabetes mellitus. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were studied on four separate
      occasions separated by at least 3 days. The divided-dose regimens were designed
      to simulate delayed absorption of the drug over 2, 4, and 8 hours. Blood samples 
      for measuring glipizide, glucose, and C-peptide were obtained over 24 hours.
      MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Glipizide peak concentrations and time to peak
      differed significantly with the dosage schedule; when smaller doses were
      administered more often, peak concentrations were lower and more delayed. The
      mean values for area under the curve from time zero to infinity (range
      7240.7-10,001.8 micrograms.L-1.hr-1; 16,226-22,414 nmol.L-1.hr-1), clearance
      (0.44-0.64 ml.min-1.kg-1; 0.07-0.11 ml.sec-1.kg-1), post-distribution phase
      volume (0.17-0.25 L.kg-1), and half-life (4.2-5.4 hrs) were not significantly
      different among regimens. Neither morning fasting glucose nor maximum and minimum
      times and concentrations of glucose and C-peptide over 24 hours were
      statistically different among regimens. Similarly, no significant differences
      were found in area under the concentration-time curve for glucose and C-peptide
      measured over 2.5 hours after each meal and from time zero to 24 hours.
      CONCLUSIONS: The timing of a glipizide dose in relation to a meal and simulated
      delayed or prolonged absorption appear to have little influence on the drug's
      pharmacodynamic effects.

TI  - Multicenter, placebo-controlled trial comparing acarbose (BAY g 5421) with
      placebo, tolbutamide, and tolbutamide-plus-acarbose in non-insulin-dependent
      diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 443-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acarbose delays release of glucose from complex carbohydrates and
      disaccharides by inhibiting intestinal alpha-glucosidases, thereby attenuating
      postprandial increments in blood glucose and insulin. This multicenter,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study compared the efficacy and safety of diet
      alone, acarbose, tolbutamide, and acarbose-plus-tolbutamide in
      non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A
      total of 290 patients with NIDDM and fasting plasma glucose levels of at least
      140 mg/dL were randomized to receive treatment TID with acarbose 200 mg,
      tolbutamide 250 to 1,000 mg, a combination of both drugs, or placebo. A 6-week
      run-in period was followed by double-blind treatment for 24 weeks, then a 6-week 
      follow-up period. RESULTS: All active treatments were superior (P < 0.05) to
      placebo in reducing postprandial hyperglycemia and HbA1c levels. The ranking in
      order of efficacy was: acarbose-plus-tolbutamide, tolbutamide, acarbose, and
      placebo. The postprandial reductions in glucose were approximately 85 mg/dL for
      acarbose-plus-tolbutamide, 71 mg/dL for tolbutamide, 56 mg/dL for acarbose, and
      13 mg/dL for placebo. Tolbutamide was associated with increases in body weight
      and postprandial insulin levels when taken alone, but these were ameliorated when
      tolbutamide was taken in combination with acarbose. Acarbose alone or in
      combination with tolbutamide caused significantly more gastrointestinal adverse
      events (mainly flatulence and soft stools or diarrhea) than tolbutamide or
      placebo, but these were generally well tolerated. Clinically significant
      elevations in hepatic transaminase levels occurred in 3 patients in the acarbose 
      group and 2 in the acarbose-plus-tolbutamide group. Transaminase levels returned 
      to normal when therapy was discontinued. CONCLUSIONS: Acarbose was effective and 
      well tolerated in the treatment of NIDDM. Control of glycemia was significantly
      better with acarbose compared with diet alone. Acarbose-plus-tolbutamide was
      superior to tolbutamide alone.

PG  - 445-53
AB  - Insulin resistance that exists in patients with essential hypertension and in
      those with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) may be the common
      denominator for the impaired glucose homeostasis and elevated blood pressure (BP)
      levels in patients with NIDDM. Therefore, treatment that improves insulin action 
      may also improve BP levels. Consequently, a four-phase (glipizide v insulin)
      cross-over design study was conducted to determine a better effect of glipizide
      treatment on insulin sensitivity and the effect this has on BP in 19 NIDDM
      patients. Patients were subjected to 1 month of diet only (phase I) followed by 3
      months of glipizide treatment (phase II), then an additional 1 month of diet only
      (phase III), and finally 3 months of insulin treatment (phase IV). At the end of 
      phases I, II, and IV oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) were performed and
      plasma glucose, insulin, and C-peptide levels were analyzed. Fasting plasma
      glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, low
      density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides, glycated hemoglobin,
      fructosamine, and 2-h postprandial plasma glucose were also analyzed at each
      phase. Supine and sitting BP levels and body weights were determined biweekly
      during the study. With the exception of higher plasma insulin and C-peptide
      levels during the OGTT (area under the curve) in phase IV (insulin) v phase II
      (glipizide) (both P < .05), and higher fasting plasma insulin levels (P < .06),
      there were no consistently significant metabolic differences between phases IV
      and II.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Prolongation of near-normoglycemic remission in black NIDDM subjects with chronic
      low-dose sulfonylurea treatment.
PG  - 466-70
AB  - Microvascular and neuropathic complications of diabetes mellitus can be
      significantly decreased by long-term, near-normoglycemic regulation in patients
      with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Prevention or delay of onset of
      hyperglycemia in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) patients should 
      reduce morbidity and mortality from these complications. NIDDM can be nearly
      normoglycemic when diagnosed by screening before its symptomatic stage or when
      clinically hyperglycemic NIDDM goes into remission. One potential strategy to
      delay the onset of hyperglycemia in individuals at high risk is chronic low-dose 
      sulfonylurea therapy. Thirty black NIDDM subjects who recently had developed
      near-normoglycemia were followed with no treatment or were randomly assigned to a
      3-year, double-blind glipizide or placebo treatment. Baseline and follow-up
      parameters included fasting plasma glucose (FPG), HbA1c, plasma insulin, and
      glucose responses to an oral glucose tolerance test and insulin action, as
      determined by the euglycemic insulin clamp. Baseline FPG and HbA1c for all three 
      groups were 107 mg/dl and 4.7%, respectively. Relapse to hyperglycemia was
      defined as an FPG level > or = 140 mg/dl on several consecutive visits or an FPG 
      level > or = 140 mg/dl and symptoms of hyperglycemia. During the course of the
      treatment and follow-up, hyperglycemia occurred in 6 of 10 subjects in the no
      treatment group, 6 of 10 in the placebo group, and 2 of 10 in the glipizide
      treatment group. Prolongation of near-normoglycemia was significantly (P < 0.05) 
      increased by low-dose (2.5 mg/day) glipizide compared with placebo
      treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Low-dose oral glyburide reduces fasting blood glucose by decreasing hepatic
      glucose production in healthy volunteers without increasing carbohydrate
      oxidation.
PG  - 134-9
AB  - Glyburide is an effective hypoglycemic agent in patients with type II diabetes
      even after the loss of its ability to increase insulin secretion. The exact
      mechanism is unknown. In an attempt to describe the direct effect of glyburide on
      glucose metabolism, a very low dose of glyburide (20 micrograms/kg body weight)
      was given orally to 12 healthy volunteers in an attempt to increase blood
      concentrations of the drug without causing a marked increase in insulin
      secretion. Fasting hepatic glucose production (HGP), carbohydrate oxidation (CO),
      leucine appearance, leucine oxidation, and fat oxidation were determined between 
      hours 3 and 4 and hours 7 and 8. The changes seen in the glyburide-treated
      volunteers were compared with the changes seen in 5 non-treated, healthy
      volunteers during the same 8-hour period. Mean blood glucose decreased greater in
      the glyburide-treated volunteers (20 +/- 2% vs 5 +/- 2%, P < 0.01). Insulin and
      C-peptide concentrations after glyburide administration (hour 7 to 8) did not
      differ significantly from baseline (hour 3 to 4) values (insulin: 53 +/- 9 pmol/L
      vs 52 +/- 9 pmol/L; C-peptide: 0.34 +/- 0.06 ng/mL vs 0.39 +/- 0.07 ng/mL). This 
      low dose of glyburide resulted in a significantly greater decrease in HGP (16 +/-
      2%; P < 0.001) than seen with fasting alone (8 +/- 4%; P < 0.05).(ABSTRACT

PG  - 165-72
AB  - Bedtime insulin (BI)/daytime sulfonylurea (DSU) therapy was studied double-blind 
      in 30 non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus subjects in whom sulfonylurea (SU) 
      therapy had failed. Subjects were switched to glipizide for 2 months (phase I) to
      confirm failure (fasting plasma glucose [FPG] 12.0 +/- 0.4 mmol/l) and then
      randomly assigned into three groups: BI-DSU; BI-no DSU; and DSU-no BI. During
      phase II (3 months), the BI dose was fixed (20 U/1.73 m2, low-dose). In phase III
      (3 months), BI was titrated up (high-dose) to achieve good control or until
      hypoglycemic symptoms prevented further dose increases. In phase IV (6 months),
      25 of the 30 original subjects received open-labeled, high-dose BI-DSU. Low-dose 
      BI-DSU markedly reduced FPG (13.6 +/- 0.8 to 8.0 +/- 0.6 mmol/l, P < 0.001), mean
      24-h glucose (P < 0.001), HbA1c (8.9 +/- 0.7 to 7.6 +/- 0.3%, P = 0.07), and
      basal hepatic glucose production (HGP) (P < 0.005). A positive correlation (r =
      0.69, P < 0.05) between the declines in FPG and HGP was observed. Neither
      low-dose BI alone nor DSU alone reduced FPG, mean 24-h glucose, HbA1c, or basal
      HGP. High-dose (40 +/- 5 U/day) BI plus DSU further reduced the FPG (6.3 +/- 0.6 
      mmol/l), HbA1c (7.1 +/- 0.3%), mean 24-h plasma glucose, and basal HGP (all P <
      0.05 vs. phase II).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

      newly diagnosed non-insulin dependent diabetes followed for three years.
PG  - 83-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the relative efficacy of treatments for non-insulin
      dependent diabetes over three years from diagnosis. DESIGN: Multicentre,
      randomised, controlled trial allocating patients to treatment with diet alone or 
      additional chlorpropamide, glibenclamide, insulin, or metformin (if obese) to
      achieve fasting plasma glucose concentrations < or = 6 mmol/l. SETTING:
      Outpatient diabetic clinics in 15 British hospitals. SUBJECTS: 2520 subjects who,
      after a three month dietary run in period, had fasting plasma glucose
      concentrations of 6.1-14.9 mmol/l but no hyperglycaemic symptoms. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURES: Fasting plasma glucose, glycated haemoglobin, and fasting plasma
      insulin concentrations; body weight; compliance; and hypoglycaemia. RESULTS:
      Median fasting plasma glucose concentrations were significantly lower at three
      years in patients allocated to chlorpropamide, glibenclamide, or insulin rather
      than diet alone (7.0, 7.6, 7.4, and 9.0 mmol/l respectively; P < 0.001) with
      lower mean glycated haemoglobin values (6.8%, 6.9%, 7.0%, and 7.6%, respectively;
      P < 0.001). Mean body weight increased significantly with chlorpropamide,
      glibenclamide, and insulin but not diet (by 3.5, 4.8, 4.8, and 1.7 kg; P <
      0.001). A similar pattern was seen for mean fasting plasma insulin concentration 
      (by 0.9, 1.2, 2.4, and -0.1 mU/l; P < 0.001). In obese subjects metformin was as 
      effective as the other drugs with no change in mean body weight and significant
      reduction in mean fasting plasma insulin concentration (-2.5 mU/l; P < 0.001).
      More hypoglycaemic episodes occurred with sulphonylurea or insulin than with diet
      or metformin. CONCLUSION: The drugs had similar glucose lowering efficacy,
      although most patients remained hyperglycaemic. Long term follow up is required
      to determine the risk-benefit ratio of the glycaemic improvement, side effects,
      changes in body weight, and plasma insulin concentration.

TI  - Comparative efficacy of a once-daily controlled-release formulation of glipizide 
      and immediate-release glipizide in patients with NIDDM.
PG  - 1460-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of controlled-release glipizide
      (glipizide-GITS [gastrointestinal therapeutic system]) and immediate-release
      glipizide in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a multicenter, open-label, randomized, two-way
      crossover study, 132 patients with NIDDM received daily doses of 5, 20, or 40 mg 
      of either glipizide-GITS or immediate-release glipizide for 8 weeks followed by 8
      weeks of the alternate formulation. Plasma glucose, serum insulin, C-peptide, and
      plasma glipizide levels were measured at fasting and post-Sustacal challenge at
      the end of 1 and 8 weeks of each treatment phase. HbA1c was measured at the end
      of weeks 7 and 8 of each treatment phase. RESULTS: Both formulations of glipizide
      yielded similar mean HbA1c values. However, mean fasting plasma glucose (FPG)
      levels were significantly lower with glipizide-GITS treatment than with
      immediate-release glipizide at the end of week 1 (11.0 vs. 11.6 mmol/l; P < 0.01)
      and at the end of the 8-week treatment phase (10.9 vs. 11.7 mmol/l; P < 0.001).
      Fasting insulin and C-peptide levels were lower after 5 mg glipizide-GITS vs.
      immediate-release glipizide. Glucose responses to Sustacal were similar after
      both formulations of glipizide; however, serum insulin (P < 0.01) and C-peptide
      responses (P < 0.05) were lower with glipizide-GITS than with immediate-release
      glipizide treatment at the end of the 8-week treatment phase. Mean plasma
      glipizide concentrations were stable by the end of week 1, and the concentrations
      increased proportionately with dose. Once-daily Glipizide-GITS provided effective
      mean glipizide concentrations (> 50 ng/ml) 24 h after dosing, even at the lowest 
      (5 mg) dose level. Both formulations were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS:
      Glipizide-GITS was significantly more effective than immediate-release glipizide 
      in reducing FPG levels. Both formulations reduced postprandial plasma glucose
      levels equally; however, glipizide-GITS exerted its control in the presence of
      lower plasma glipizide concentrations in addition to significantly lower insulin 
      and C-peptide levels. This suggests that glipizide-GITS improves insulin
      sensitivity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of glyburide
      after single- and multiple-dose administration in patients with type II diabetes.
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty patients with type II diabetes between 40 and
      70 years of age participated in the study. A 24-h pharmacokinetic evaluation
      including a 4-h Sustacal tolerance test was conducted before instituting
      glyburide therapy (baseline), after the first 2.5-mg test dose of glyburide and
      at weeks 6 and 12 of chronic glyburide therapy. Glyburide doses were titrated
      with a target goal of achieving a fasting plasma glucose of < or = 7.8 mmol/l or 
      to reach maximum daily doses of 20 mg. RESULTS: A significant prolongation in the
      elimination half-life (t1/2: week 0, 4.0 +/- 1.9 h; week 6, 13.7 +/- 10.5 h; and 
      week 12, 12.1 +/- 8.2 h) and an increased volume of distribution of glyburide was
      observed during chronic dosing. These results strongly suggest possible drug
      accumulation. No differences in pharmacokinetic parameters were noted between
      evaluations at week 6 or week 12. Changes in pharmacodynamic response of glucose,
      insulin, and C-peptide to chronic glyburide therapy were observed. Glyburide
      therapy significantly reduced plasma glucose levels at weeks 6 and 12 (percent
      changes in AUC0-->4. glucose from baseline: week 0, -3 +/- 11%; week 6, -29 +/-
      13%; and week 12, -26 +/- 19%). Pancreatic insulin secretion was acutely enhanced
      and maintained during long-term therapy. Responsiveness to therapy as assessed by
      the ratio of AUC0-->4.glucose:AUC0-->4.C-peptide was significantly improved at
      all weeks compared with baseline. No pharmacodynamic response differences were
      observed between the week 6 and the week 12 evaluations. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      demonstrates that significant differences in glyburide pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics exist between single-dose and steady-state conditions. These
      differences support the need for careful dosage titration of glyburide to achieve
      a desired therapeutic response in patients with type II diabetes.

AB  - Suppression of nocturnal hepatic glucose production is key in the treatment of
      noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). In this article, the authors
      compare the effectiveness of dosing glyburide at bedtime versus in the morning on
      glycemic control in patients with NIDDM under suboptimal control. In a
      placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover trial, 32 patients with NIDDM with
      suboptimal control on chronic glyburide treatment fulfilling entry criteria were 
      randomized to receive one of two regimens: (1) glyburide at bedtime and placebo
      in morning or (2) placebo at bedtime and glyburide in the morning. After 6 months
      of a regimen, patients crossed over to the other treatment and completed an
      additional 6-month period. After baseline assessment, fasting blood sugar,
      history, physical exam, and compliance assessments were performed monthly. HbA1c 
      was measured bimonthly and Sustacal tolerance tests were performed at the end of 
      each 6-month treatment period. During the initial 6-month comparison fasting,
      blood sugar concentration decreased 5% in bedtime ingesters and rose 10% in the
      morning patients. These changes were not statistically significant. HbA1c
      decreased significantly in the morning group but remained unchanged in the
      bedtime group. At the end of 12 months, nighttime dosing resulted in better home 
      glucose monitoring values, fasting blood sugar results, and Sustacal tolerance
      profiles, but the differences were not statistically significant. No hypoglycemia
      was observed in the monitored data collected. Bedtime dosing of glyburide
      resulted in measurable improvement in fasting blood sugar and carbohydrate
      tolerance curves, but not to a degree justifying general recommendation of this
      technique in patients with NIDDM with secondary failure to oral agents.

AB  - The sulphonylureas and the biguanides are widely used as adjuncts to dietary
      measures in the treatment of non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus
      (NIDDM). Adverse effect profiles differ markedly between the sulphonylureas and
      biguanides, reflecting differences in chemical structure and mode of action.
      Sulphonylureas are generally well tolerated, although pharmacokinetic differences
      between these agents have important clinical implications. The main adverse
      effect associated with sulphonylureas is hypoglycaemia. This effect is a
      predictable consequence of the principal pharmacological effect of these drugs,
      i.e. sensitisation of the islet beta-cell to glucose, resulting in enhanced
      endogenous insulin secretion. Sulphonylurea-induced suppression of hepatic
      glucose production may cause profound and protracted hypoglycaemia, especially in
      elderly patients, in individuals with intercurrent illnesses and reduced caloric 
      intake, or when taken in combination with other compounds with hypoglycaemic
      potential, e.g. alcohol (ethanol). Sulphonylureas with a longer duration of
      action, notably chlorpropamide and glibenclamide (glyburide), are more liable to 
      induce serious hypoglycaemia, particularly when drug elimination is reduced by
      renal impairment. Other drugs such as salicylates may potentiate the actions of
      sulphonylureas, thereby increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia. Biguanide therapy
      is associated with alterations in lactate homeostasis which under certain
      clinical circumstances may result in fatal lactic acidosis. Phenformin is
      associated with a markedly greater risk of lactic acidosis than metformin.
      Phenformin has been withdrawn in many countries for this reason. All biguanides
      must be avoided in patients with renal impairment, hepatic dysfunction and
      cardiac failure--conditions where drug accumulation or disordered lactate
      metabolism may predispose to lactic acidosis. Phenformin should not be given to
      individuals who exhibit a severe, genetically conferred hepatic defect of
      hydroxylation which impedes metabolism of this drug. Less seriously, the
      biguanides are associated with a relatively high incidence of gastrointestinal
      adverse effects which limit compliance. Acarbose, a competitive inhibitor of
      intestinal alpha-glucosidases, has recently been introduced. In contrast to the
      sulphonylureas and biguanides, acarbose has not been associated with
      life-threatening adverse effects. This reflects the low systemic absorption of
      the drug and, predictably, its principal unwanted effects are gastrointestinal
      disturbances resulting from iatrogenic carbohydrate malabsorption.

PG  - 1100-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess and compare the therapeutic efficacy and safety of metformin
      (M) and sulfonylurea (glyburide, G), alone and in various combinations, in
      patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). RESEARCH DESIGN
      AND METHODS: Of 165 patients (fasting blood glucose [FBG] > or = 6.7 mmol/l)
      initially treated with diet alone, 144 (FBG still > or = 6.7 mmol/l) were
      randomized to double-blind, double-dummy controlled treatment with M, G, or
      primary combination therapy (MG). The dose was titrated, with FBG < 6.7 mmol/l as
      target, using, at most, six dose levels. The first three dose levels comprised
      increasing single-drug therapy (M or G) or primary combination at increasing but 
      low dosage (MGL), and the second three levels were composed of various high-dose 
      combinations, i.e., add-on therapy (M/G or G/M) and primary combination escalated
      to high dosage (MGH). Medication was maintained for 6 months after completed dose
      titration. RESULTS: The FBG target was achieved in 9% of patients after diet
      alone. Single-drug therapy was insufficient in 36% and MGL in 25% (NS) of the
      randomized patients. There was further improvement in glucose control by the
      high-dose combinations. Mean FBG +/- SE was reduced (P = 0.001) from 9.1 +/- 0.4 
      to 7.0 +/- 0.2 mmol/l in those maintained on single-drug treatment or low-dose
      primary combination. Those treated with different high-dose combinations had a
      large mean FBG reduction, from 13.3 +/- 0.8 to 7.8 +/- 0.6 mmol/l. HbA1c levels
      showed corresponding reductions, and glycemic levels rose after drug
      discontinuation. Fasting C-peptide rose during treatment with G and MGL but not
      with M, while fasting insulin was not significantly changed. Meal-stimulated
      C-peptide and insulin levels were unchanged by M but increased by G and, to a
      lesser extent, by MGL. There were no significant insulin or C-peptide differences
      between the different high-dose combinations (M/G, G/M, and MGH). Body weight did
      not change following treatment with M or combination but increased by 2.8 +/- 0.7
      kg following G alone. Blood pressure was unchanged. Overall effects on plasma
      lipids were small, with no significant differences between groups. Drug safety
      was satisfactory, even if the reporting of (usually modest) adverse events was
      high; the profile, but not the frequency, differed between groups. CONCLUSIONS:
      Dose-effect titrated treatment with either metformin or glyburide promotes equal 
      degrees of glycemic control. The former, but not the latter, is able to achieve
      this control without increasing body weight or hyperinsulinemia. Near-normal
      glycemia can be obtained by a combination of metformin and sulfonylurea, even in 
      advanced NIDDM.

PG  - 305-13
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the effect of insulin and sulfonylurea (SU) therapy on
      glycaemic control, insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk factors in type 2
      diabetic subjects. DESIGN: A prospective, parallel, randomized, controlled,
      long-term study. SETTING: Outpatient clinic in tertiary referral centre.
      SUBJECTS: Thirty-six type 2 diabetic subjects treated with diet and SU, aged
      44-69 years and a duration of diabetes of between 2 and 14 years. INTERVENTIONS: 
      Individually adjusted doses of insulin and glibenclamide. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 
      Glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin resistance (euglycaemic glucose clamp),
      levels of lipids, lipoproteins and blood pressure. RESULTS: Glycaemic control
      improved during insulin treatment, but deteriorated on SU; HbA1c levels differed 
      significantly between groups after 12 months of therapy (mean +/- SEM 7.9 +/- 0.3
      vs. 9.5 +/- 0.4%, P = 0.004). Body mass index increased significantly during
      insulin treatment (26.4 +/- 0.7 to 27.8 +/- 0.7 kg/m2, P = 0.0001) and 30% of
      this increase was a result of an increase in lean body mass. The total glucose
      disposal rate showed a small increase in the insulin group. Levels of
      triglycerides and apolipoprotein B were significantly reduced during insulin
      treatment (1.8 +/- 0.2 to 1.5 +/- 0.2 mmol L-1, P = 0.03 and 1.58 +/- 0.1 to 1.40
      +/- 0.08 g L-1, P = 0.003), and insulin prevented a reduction in the levels of
      high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-1 and an increase
      in Lp(a) lipoprotein observed in the SU group. Blood pressure levels did not
      change during therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Insulin therapy was superior to SU treatment 
      in achieving good metabolic control. Despite a modest improvement in
      cardiovascular risk factors in the insulin-treated group, no significant
      differences were observed between the groups after 1 year's treatment.

      mg M2 intravenously, and placebo intravenously, each in the fasting state.
      Standardized meals were given 0.5 and 5.5 h after each medication. Blood glucose 
      levels were measured by a glucose oxidase method, and serum insulin
      concentrations were analyzed by a specific immunoassay. RESULTS: Blood glucose
      levels during the first 5 h were significantly lowered not only by Gb but also by
      M1 and M2. The mean +/- SE blood glucose reductions (versus placebo) expressed as
      percent of area under the curve (AUC) (0-5 h) were 18.2 +/- 3.3% for M1, 12.5 +/-
      2.3% for M2, 19.9 +/- 2.1% for intravenous Gb, and 23.8 +/- 1.2% for Gb orally.
      Serum insulin levels were significantly increased by Gb as well as by M1 and M2. 
      and M2. CONCLUSIONS: The two main metabolites of glyburide (glibenclamide) have a
      hypoglycemic effect in humans, which is due to increased insulin secretion.

TI  - One year comparative trial of metformin and glipizide in type 2 diabetes
      mellitus.
PG  - 394-400
AB  - Forty-eight diabetic subjects with diet-failed Type 2 mellitus, aged 40-69 years,
      were randomised to metformin (24 patients) or glipizide (24 patients) therapy,
      and followed prospectively for 12 months. Most subjects were obese. Metformin
      gave better fasting plasma glucose control compared to glipizide at 24 (p <
      0.01), 36 (p < 0.05) and 52 weeks (p < 0.05) with a lower HbA1 concentration at
      52 weeks (p < 0.05). Metformin treated patients lost weight whereas glipizide
      treated subjects gained weight. The weight change between the treatment groups
      reached significance at 4 weeks (p < 0.05) and was highly significant (p < 0.001)
      at 8, 12, 24, 36 and 52 weeks. There were no significant changes in either
      fasting plasma lipid or blood lactate levels in either the metformin or glipizide
      treated groups. Both drugs caused a similar reduction in albumin excretion rates.
      In conclusion, metformin gave better glycaemic control than glipizide, with
      weight loss rather than weight gain in obese Type 2 patients.

      patients. The Essen Study.
PG  - 561-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the different therapeutic principles of alpha-glucosidase
      inhibitors and sulphonylureas as first-line treatment in non-insulin-dependent
      diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) patients with dietary failure. RESEARCH DESIGN AND
      METHODS: Ninety-six NIDDM patients (35-70 years of age, body mass index [BMI] <
      or = 35), insufficiently treated with diet alone (HbA1c 7-9%) were randomized
      into three groups and treated for 24 weeks with acarbose, glibenclamide, or
      placebo. Efficacy, based on fasting blood glucose (BG), BG 1 h after ingestion of
      standard breakfast (postprandial), serum insulin, postprandial insulin increase, 
      and HbA1c; and tolerability, based on subjective symptoms and laboratory values, 
      were investigated every 6 weeks. Efficacy evaluation was valid for 85 patients.
      RESULTS: The test drugs were dosed as follows: 100 mg acarbose (A) three times a 
      day, 1 placebo tablet three times a day, 3.5 mg glibenclamide tablets dosed 1-0-0
      or 1-0-1, mean dose 4.3 mg/day. Compared with the placebo, both drugs showed the 
      same mean efficacy on fasting BG (-1.4 mM with acarbose, -1.6 mM with
      glibenclamide), 1-h postprandial BG (-2.2 mM with acarbose, -1.9 mM with
      glibenclamide), and HbA1c (-1.1% with acarbose, -0.9% with glibenclamide); but
      they showed a marked difference in 1-h postprandial insulin values (-80.7 pM with
      acarbose, 96.7 pM with glibenclamide). The mean relative insulin increase (1-h
      postprandial) was 1.5 in the placebo group, 1.1 in the acarbose group, and 2.5 in
      the glibenclamide group. No changes in body weight could be observed. No adverse 
      events were seen under placebo. Acarbose led to mild or moderate intestinal
      symptoms in 38% of patients. Glibenclamide led to hypoglycemia, which could be
      solved by dose reduction, in 6% of patients. No dropouts occurred in any of the
      treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Acarbose and glibenclamide are effective drugs for
      the monotherapy of NIDDM patients when diet alone fails. Because postprandial
      insulin increase has been shown to be associated with increased risk for
      cardiovascular disease, acarbose, which lowers pp increase, may be superior to
      glibenclamide, which elevates postprandial insulin increase.

TI  - Sulfonylureas induce cholesterol accumulation in cultured human intimal cells and
      macrophages.
PG  - 159-63
AB  - Using primary cultures of human smooth muscle intimal cells and mouse peritoneal 
      macrophages it was demonstrated that oral hypoglycemic agents, sulfonylurea
      derivatives, at concentrations 10(-5)-10(-4) mol/l caused significant (by
      25%-60%) intracellular total cholesterol accumulation. This in vitro atherogenic 
      effect was confirmed in an ex vivo model. Sera from Type 2 diabetic patients,
      taken after sulfonylurea administration, acquired the ability to induce
      cholesterol accumulation in cultured cells. This enhanced atherogenic effect of
      patients' sera was observed for the next 2-4 h following the treatment and
      corresponded well to the pharmacokinetic characteristics of the tested drugs. The
      results suggest that sulfonylureas may exert a direct atherogenic action at the
      level of arterial cells, by increasing intracellular cholesterol content.

PG  - 1060-8
AB  - A postmarketing study involving 114 office practices provides the largest body of
      clinical experience to date in Canada with the second-generation sulfonylurea
      gliclazide in the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).
      This study focused on efficacy and safety in 411 NIDDM patients. Subjects
      included patients whose disease was not controlled by diet alone or by diet plus 
      an antidiabetic drug. The dose of gliclazide was 80 mg/day to 320 mg/day.
      Patients were treated for 3 months, with monthly evaluations. Fasting and 2-hour 
      blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels were measured before and after the
      study period, with all values showing a significant decrease (P = 0.01). Total
      cholesterol and triglyceride levels also decreased significantly during the study
      (P = 0.05). Adverse effects were recorded in 30 (7.3%) of patients and led to the
      withdrawal of 1.2% from the study. Hypoglycemia symptoms were less frequently
      encountered with gliclazide than with previous treatments (P = 0.001). Gliclazide
      was found to be safe and well tolerated in the majority of patients. The results 
      of this study appear to confirm the established efficacy of gliclazide in
      treating NIDDM.

TI  - Diabetes control in the elderly: a randomized, comparative study of glyburide
      versus glipizide in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 1031-40
AB  - This study sought to compare the efficacy and safety of glyburide and glipizide
      in elderly patients with well-controlled non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 
      (NIDDM). One hundred forty-five patients aged > or = 65 years with NIDDM that was
      controlled for at least 3 months with oral sulfonylurea therapy were enrolled.
      After a washout phase, 139 patients were randomized to receive glyburide, 1.25 or
      2.5 mg/day, or glipizide, 2.5 or 5 mg/day. During a 4- to 8-week titration phase,
      doses were adjusted according to prescribing guidelines. Patients who achieved
      glycemic control (fasting plasma glucose of < or = 8.9 mmol/L, or 160 mg/dl, on
      two consecutive occasions) entered a maintenance phase, for a total treatment
      period of 4 months. Hypoglycemia was defined as a fasting plasma glucose of < 3.3
      mmol/L (60 mg/dl) or a random plasma glucose of < 2.8 mmol/L (50 mg/dl), with
      associated signs and symptoms. Most patients in both the glyburide and glipizide 
      groups achieved satisfactory glycemic control; there were no significant
      differences between groups in fasting plasma glucose or hemoglobin A1c levels at 
      any time. Of note, the mean dose of glyburide (8.5 mg/day) was approximately half
      that of glipizide (15.4 mg/day) at the end of the maintenance period (P = 0.009).
      Both regimens were well tolerated and were associated with a similarly low
      incidence of hypoglycemia. It was concluded that both glyburide and glipizide are
      suitable for the treatment of NIDDM in properly selected elderly patients.

TI  - Continuous versus intermittent sulphonylurea therapy in non-insulin-dependent
      diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 249-53
AB  - Although it is 50 years since the discovery of the hypoglycaemic effects of
      sulphonylureas, the molecular basis of their effects are still not fully
      understood. It has been suggested that long term sulphonylurea therapy may
      desensitise the pancreatic beta-cells to further drug effects, and that
      intermittent sulphonylurea therapy may be the best approach to maintain their
      effectiveness. A randomised, double-blind study has been carried out to attempt
      to answer the question of whether intermittent sulphonylurea therapy is more
      effective then continuous administration. Responders to oral glibenclamide
      (glyburide) went on to receive continuous or intermittent treatment
      (glibenclamide for 2 weeks then placebo for 2 weeks) for 16 weeks. Glycaemic
      control was maintained in the continuous treatment group. However, glucose levels
      deteriorated in the intermittent treatment group, suggesting that there is no
      merit to intermittent sulphonylurea treatment. Other strategies to investigate
      include administration on an alternate-day basis or a shorter period off the drug
      (e.g. 1 week). The underlying question of optimal glycaemic control with
      sulphonylureas warrants a definitive answer.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of reformulated, micronized glyburide tablets in patients
      with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus: a multicenter, double-blind,
      randomized trial.
PG  - 788-96
AB  - The subjects were 206 patients (123 men, 83 women) with non-insulin-dependent
      diabetes mellitus, aged 33 to 80 years. For at least 4 weeks prior to the study
      each subject had been taking 5-mg tablets of original, nonmicronized glyburide
      (Micronase tablets) in doses of 5, 10, 15, or 20 mg daily. In a double-blind
      12-week study, the subjects were randomly assigned to continue receiving 5-mg
      tablets of original glyburide or to substitute 3-mg tablets of reformulated,
      micronized glyburide (Glynase PresTab tablets) for the original tablets.
      Glyburide tablets had been reformulated to improve their bioavailability.
      Baseline mean fasting serum glucose levels in the groups taking reformulated and 
      original glyburide were 169.3 and 168.3 mg/dl, respectively; at study end point, 
      their respective serum glucose levels were 186.0 and 177.0 mg/dl. The differences
      between groups were not significant; in both groups, however, end point glucose
      levels were significantly higher than baseline levels. Baseline hemoglobin A1C
      levels in the groups taking reformulated and original glyburide were both 7.6%;
      at study end point, hemoglobin A1C levels had improved slightly in each group to 
      7.4% and 7.5%, respectively. The differences between and within groups at end
      point were not significant. No between-group differences at baseline or at end
      point were found in mean levels of postprandial serum glucose, fasting C-peptide,
      or postprandial C-peptide. Medical events experienced by the subjects in the two 
      groups were similar in nature and number. Changes in other laboratory test
      results, vital signs, and weight were not clinically meaningful.(ABSTRACT
