TI  - Chronic daily headache prophylaxis with tizanidine: a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, multicenter outcome study.
PG  - 470-82
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of tizanidine hydrochloride versus placebo as
      adjunctive prophylactic therapy for chronic daily headache (chronic migraine,
      migrainous headache, or tension-type headache). BACKGROUND: Tizanidine is an
      alpha2-adrenergic agonist that inhibits the release of norepinephrine at both the
      spinal cord and brain, with antinociceptive effects that are independent of the
      endogenous opioid system. Previous open-label studies have suggested the drug may
      be effective for treatment of chronic daily headache. METHODS: Two hundred
      patients completed a 4-week, single-blind, placebo baseline period, with 134
      fulfilling selection criteria and then randomized to tizanidine or placebo.
      Ninety-two patients completed at least 8 weeks of treatment (tizanidine, n = 45; 
      placebo, n = 47), and 85 patients completed 12 weeks of treatment (tizanidine, n 
      = 44; placebo, n = 41). Most patients (77%) met the diagnostic criteria for
      migraine of the International Headache Society; 23% had either chronic migrainous
      headache or chronic tension-type headache. Tizanidine was slowly titrated over 4 
      weeks to 24 mg or the maximum dose tolerated (mean, 18 mg; SD, 6.4; median, 20.0;
      range, 2 to 24), divided equally over three dose intervals per day. Overall
      headache index ([headache days x average intensity x duration in hours]/28 days) 
      was the primary end point. RESULTS: Tizanidine was shown to be superior to
      placebo in reducing the overall headache index (P =.0025), as well as mean
      headache days per week (P =.0193), severe headache days per week (P =.0211),
      average headache intensity (P =.0108), peak headache intensity (P =.0020), and
      mean headache duration (P =.0127). The mean percentage improvement during the
      last 4 weeks of treatment with tizanidine versus placebo was 54% versus 19% for
      the headache index (P =.0144), 55% versus 21% for severe headache days (P
      =.0331), 35% versus 19% for headache duration (P =.0142), 35% versus 20% for peak
      headache intensity (P =.0106), 33% versus 20% for average headache intensity (P
      =.0281), and 30% versus 22% for total headache days (P =.0593). Patients
      receiving tizanidine also scored higher ratings of overall headache improvement
      on a visual analog scale (P =.0069). There was no statistically significant
      difference in outcome for patients with chronic migraine versus those with only
      migrainous or tension-type headache. Adverse effects reported by more than 10% of
      the patients included somnolence (47%), dizziness (24%), dry mouth (23%), and
      asthenia (19%). Dropouts due to adverse events did not differ significantly
      between tizanidine and placebo. CONCLUSIONS: The results support tizanidine as an
      effective prophylactic adjunct for chronic daily headache, including migraine,
      migrainous headache, and tension-type headache. These results also suggest the
      possible importance of an alpha2-adrenergic mechanism underlying the
      pathophysiology of this spectrum of headache disorders.

TI  - Abuse of combinations of carisoprodol and tramadol.
PG  - 512-4
AB  - Neither carisoprodol (Soma) nor tramadol (Ultram) is a controlled substance at
      the federal level. However, evidence indicates that these medications may have
      abuse potential, particularly in patients with a history of substance abuse. We
      report three cases in which a combination of carisoprodol and tramadol was used
      illicitly to obtain psychotropic effects. Carisoprodol or tramadol should be
      prescribed with caution for patients at risk for substance abuse, and extreme
      caution should be used when prescribing both drugs simultaneously for any
      patient.

TI  - Modified-release formulation of tizanidine in chronic tension-type headache.
PG  - 633-7
AB  - The efficacy of the modified-release formulation of tizanidine (Sirdalud) was
      compared with placebo in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study of 138 
      women and 47 men, aged 18 to 79 years, with a history of chronic tension-type
      headache (IHS categories 2.2 and 2.3). The treatment period was 6 weeks preceded 
      by a 2-week prerandomization period. The patients were randomly assigned to
      receive 6-mg Sirdalud, 12-mg Sirdalud MR, or placebo. The study medication was
      taken once per day, orally in the evening. Efficacy was measured by visual analog
      scale, the number of headache-free days, the daily duration of headache, and the 
      use of paracetamol. The primary end point was the severity of daily headache
      derived from visual analog scale scores covering the last 2 treatment weeks. One 
      hundred sixty patients (56 in the 6-mg group, 49 in the 12-mg group, and 55 in
      the placebo group) completed the study. The severity of the headache decreased
      similarly in the treatment groups and the placebo group. The visual analog scale 
      values decreased from the prerandomization values by 53% in the 6-mg group, 48%
      in the 12-mg group, and 52% in the placebo group. The modified-release
      formulation of tizanidine in doses up to 12 mg taken in the evening is not
      superior to placebo in the treatment of chronic tension-type headache. The
      placebo effect was unexpectedly strong in the present study, supporting the view 
      that psychophysiological mechanisms are of considerable importance in sustaining 
      chronic tension-type headache.

TI  - Effect of baclofen on gait in spastic MS patients.
PG  - 244-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To measure gait and postural stability by objective methods in
      spastic MS patients and to evaluate the effect of baclofen on gait and postural
      stability. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fourteen spastic MS patients were examined in a 
      placebo controlled double-blind, cross-over trial of oral baclofen treatment. The
      gait was measured on a computerized treadmill and postural stability was measured
      on a computer assisted force-plate. RESULTS: Only insignificant improvements in
      the clinical measurements during baclofen treatment were found. At baseline gait 
      was characterized by low speed, short steps and unsteadiness. Postural stability 
      was severely impaired. During baclofen treatment only vertical unsteadiness of
      gait diminished significantly. DISCUSSION: We conclude that patients primarily
      with spasticity, concomitant with hampering or painful spasms and co-contractions
      should be offered treatment with baclofen. Only some will experience improvement 
      of their gait disorders, when treated with baclofen.

TI  - A review of carisoprodol deaths in Jefferson County, Alabama.
PG  - 726-30
AB  - BACKGROUND: Carisoprodol is a skeletal muscle relaxant with the potential for
      abuse. A carisoprodol overdose is rarely considered fatal. Nevertheless, we
      encountered carisoprodol in several cases, prompting review of our experience.
      METHODS: We did a retrospective study of cases examined at the Jefferson County
      Coroner/Medical Examiner Office from January 1, 1986, to October 31, 1997,
      reviewing investigative reports and autopsy findings. RESULTS: Carisoprodol was
      present in 24 cases. Seventeen decedents died of acute drug intoxication.
      Carisoprodol was never the sole drug detected at autopsy, nor was it ever the
      sole cause of death. Propoxyphene was a co-intoxicant in 8 of the 24 cases.
      CONCLUSIONS: Carisoprodol causes respiratory depression. Since the mechanism of
      death was respiratory depression in 82% of the decedents who died of acute
      intoxication, we consider that carisoprodol was probably responsible, in part,
      for those deaths. The simultaneous use of propoxyphene and carisoprodol seems to 
      be especially dangerous.

TI  - A comparison of clonidine, cyproheptadine and baclofen in spastic spinal cord
      injured patients.
PG  - 150-6
AB  - In twenty-five SCI subjects, antispasticity effects of three putative
      antispasticity agents [clonidine (an alpha-2 noradrenergic agonist),
      cyproheptadine (a 5-HT2 antagonist) and baclofen (a GABA-B agonist)] were tested 
      in terms of changes in leg tone as graded by the Ashworth scale (AS), in terms of
      the vibratory inhibition of the H-reflex (VII) and in terms of the ability of the
      knee to swing passively in the pendulum test as quantified by video motion
      analysis. When compared to the no drug period, all three drug treatments showed
      an antispasticity effect on the AS, the VII and the amplitude of the first swing 
      and the relaxation index of the pendulum test, p. < 0001. Surprisingly,
      cyproheptadine and baclofen produced a greater reduction in the VII than
      clonidine, p. < 01. The amplitude of the first swing in the pendulum test
      correlated well with the AS, r = .88, and the antispasticity effects of the drugs
      produced improvements in both measures, a reduced AS and increased amplitude of
      knee swing in the pendulum test. Therefore, video motion analysis of the pendulum
      test is as valid a measure of spasticity as the Ashworth scale and is not limited
      by subjectivity of the examiner.

TI  - Long-term botulinum toxin treatment of focal hand dystonia.
PG  - 70-6
AB  - We treated focal hand dystonia in 53 patients with botulinum toxin injections for
      up to 6 years. Eighty-one percent of the patients improved with at least one
      injection session. Sixty-five percent of the injections produced transient
      weakness. We followed 37 of the patients for at least 2 years from the start of
      treatment, 24 of whom discontinued treatment because of inadequate response, loss
      of response, inaccessibility of a treatment provider, or the expense of the
      toxin. Women, who had a greater extent and longer duration of benefit than men,
      were more likely to continue treatment. The mean interval between injection
      sessions was 6 months. In most patients, we injected the toxin into the same
      combination of muscles at each session. The dose of toxin generally fluctuated
      within a range of 20 units. Side effects were mild and transient and unrelated to
      the long-term use of botulinum toxin. Botulinum toxin injection is safe and
      effective for the long-term management of focal hand dystonia.

TI  - Epilepsy, psychosis, and schizophrenia: clinical and neuropathologic
      correlations.
PG  - 34-42
AB  - This study examines the relationship between epilepsy and psychosis. It compares 
      clinical, EEG, and neuropathologic data from a group of subjects who had both
      epilepsy and psychosis with similar information from another group of patients
      who had epilepsy but no evidence of psychotic illness. We examined, blind to
      clinical diagnosis, gross and microscopic material from whole-brain specimens
      from 10 patients diagnosed with epilepsy plus schizophrenia-like psychosis, nine 
      subjects diagnosed with epilepsy plus "epileptic psychosis," and 36 individuals
      with epilepsy (21 from an epileptic colony and 15 from the community at large)
      who had no history of psychosis (n = 10 + 9 + 21 + 15 = 55). We abstracted case
      histories without knowledge of pathologic findings. Epileptic colony patients had
      an earlier age at onset of seizures, while epileptic colony and epileptic
      psychosis patients had more frequent seizures. Epileptic individuals in the
      community died at a younger age than did epileptic patients in long-stay hospital
      care. Psychotic epileptic patients had larger cerebral ventricles, excess
      periventricular gliosis, and more focal cerebral damage compared with epileptic
      patients who had no psychotic illness. Epileptic patients with schizophrenia-like
      psychosis were distinguished from all other groups by a significant excess of
      pinpoint perivascular white-matter softenings. We found that mesial temporal
      sclerosis and temporal lobe epilepsy occurred with equal frequency in the
      psychotic and nonpsychotic groups; generalized seizures occurred more frequently 
      in the psychotic epileptics and the epileptic colony epileptics than in the
      community epileptic controls.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the relative efficacy and tolerability of amitriptyline,
      cyclobenzaprine, and placebo in the treatment of fibromyalgia, and to identify
      predictors of response to amitriptyline and cyclobenzaprine. METHODS: Two hundred
      eight patients who fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology criteria for
      the classification of fibromyalgia were entered into a 6-month prospective,
      double-blind, multicenter trial and were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups:
      amitriptyline, cyclobenzaprine, or placebo. RESULTS: After 1 month, 21%, 12%, and
      0% of the amitriptyline, cyclobenzaprine, and placebo patients, respectively, had
      significant clinical improvement (amitriptyline versus placebo P = 0.002,
      cyclobenzaprine versus placebo P = 0.02, amitriptyline versus cyclobenzaprine P
      not significant). These percentages increased to 36%, 33%, and 19%, respectively,
      at the 6-month assessment (P not significant). The nature and frequency of side
      effects reported by patients treated with amitriptyline and those reported by
      patients treated with cyclobenzaprine were similar. A normal Minnesota
      Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) profile at baseline was predictive of
      clinical improvement at the 1-month evaluation (odds ratio 3.3, 95% confidence
      interval 1.2-9.0). However, neither the MMPI profile nor any of the demographic, 
      clinical, or functional parameters evaluated at baseline predicted long-term
      response. CONCLUSION: Our data confirm the short-term efficacy of amitriptyline
      and cyclobenzaprine in a small percentage of patients with fibromyalgia.
      Long-term efficacy could not be demonstrated because of a higher-than-expected
      placebo response. Predictors of response to these drugs could not be determined.
