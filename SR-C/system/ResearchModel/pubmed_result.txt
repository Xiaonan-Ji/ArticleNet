TI  - A calcium antagonist vs a non-calcium antagonist hypertension treatment strategy 
      for patients with coronary artery disease. The International
      Verapamil-Trandolapril Study (INVEST): a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 2805-16
AB  - CONTEXT: Despite evidence of efficacy of antihypertensive agents in treating
      hypertensive patients, safety and efficacy of antihypertensive agents for
      coronary artery disease (CAD) have been discerned only from subgroup analyses in 
      large trials. OBJECTIVE: To compare mortality and morbidity outcomes in patients 
      with hypertension and CAD treated with a calcium antagonist strategy (CAS) or a
      non-calcium antagonist strategy (NCAS). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:
      Randomized, open label, blinded end point study of 22 576 hypertensive CAD
      patients aged 50 years or older, which was conducted September 1997 to February
      2003 at 862 sites in 14 countries. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned
      to either CAS (verapamil sustained release) or NCAS (atenolol). Strategies
      specified dose and additional drug regimens. Trandolapril and/or
      hydrochlorothiazide was administered to achieve blood pressure goals according to
      guidelines from the sixth report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention,
      Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VI) of less than
      140 mm Hg (systolic) and less than 90 mm Hg (diastolic); and less than 130 mm Hg 
      (systolic) and less than 85 mm Hg (diastolic) if diabetes or renal impairment was
      present. Trandolapril was also recommended for patients with heart failure,
      diabetes, or renal impairment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary: first occurrence
      of death (all cause), nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke; other: 
      cardiovascular death, angina, adverse experiences, hospitalizations, and blood
      pressure control at 24 months. RESULTS: At 24 months, in the CAS group, 6391
      patients (81.5%) were taking verapamil sustained release; 4934 (62.9%) were
      taking trandolapril; and 3430 (43.7%) were taking hydrochlorothiazide. In the
      NCAS group, 6083 patients (77.5%) were taking atenolol; 4733 (60.3%) were taking 
      hydrochlorothiazide; and 4113 (52.4%) were taking trandolapril. After a follow-up
      of 61 835 patient-years (mean, 2.7 years per patient), 2269 patients had a
      primary outcome event with no statistically significant difference between
      treatment strategies (9.93% in CAS and 10.17% in NCAS; relative risk [RR], 0.98; 
      95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90-1.06). Two-year blood pressure control was
      similar between groups. The JNC VI blood pressure goals were achieved by 65.0%
      (systolic) and 88.5% (diastolic) of CAS and 64.0% (systolic) and 88.1%
      (diastolic) of NCAS patients. A total of 71.7% of CAS and 70.7% of NCAS patients 
      achieved a systolic blood pressure of less than 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood
      pressure of less than 90 mm Hg. CONCLUSION: The verapamil-trandolapril-based
      strategy was as clinically effective as the atenolol-hydrochlorothiazide-based
      strategy in hypertensive CAD patients.

TI  - Relation between use of antihypertensive medications and risk of breast carcinoma
      among women ages 65-79 years.
PG  - 1504-13
AB  - BACKGROUND: Limited data are available regarding the incidence of breast
      carcinoma among users of relatively recently introduced forms of antihypertensive
      therapy. Although it has been suggested that women who have taken calcium channel
      blockers (CCBs) have an increased risk and that women who have taken
      angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have a decreased risk,
      currently, no conclusions can be drawn. METHODS: A population-based case-control 
      study of women ages 65-79 years was conducted in western Washington State. The
      responses of 975 women who were diagnosed with invasive breast carcinoma during
      1997-1999 were compared with the responses of 1007 women in a control group.
      Associations between use of different types of antihypertensive medications and
      breast carcinoma incidence were evaluated using logistic regression. RESULTS:
      Overall, women who had ever used CCBs, beta-blockers, or ACE inhibitors did not
      have an altered risk of breast carcinoma relative to women who had never used
      antihypertensive medications. Although the use of immediate-release CCBs,
      thiazide diuretics, and potassium-sparing diuretics was associated with modestly 
      increased risks of breast carcinoma (odds ratio [OR], 1.5; 95% confidence
      interval [95% CI], 1.0-2.1; OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.8; and OR, 1.6; 95% CI,
      1.2-2.1, respectively), the absence of any trend in the size of excess risk with 
      increasing duration or with current versus former use of these agents argues for 
      a cautious interpretation. CONCLUSIONS: The use of particular types of
      antihypertensive medications, including immediate-release CCBs and certain
      diuretics, may increase the risk of breast carcinoma among older women.
      Additional studies are warranted to clarify these potential associations. Cancer

TI  - Principal results of the Controlled Onset Verapamil Investigation of
      Cardiovascular End Points (CONVINCE) trial.
PG  - 2073-82
AB  - CONTEXT: Hypertensive patients are often given a calcium antagonist to reduce
      cardiovascular disease risk, but the benefit compared with other drug classes is 
      controversial. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether initial therapy with
      controlled-onset extended-release (COER) verapamil is equivalent to a physician's
      choice of atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide in preventing cardiovascular disease.
      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Double-blind, randomized clinical trial
      conducted at 661 centers in 15 countries. A total of 16 602 participants
      diagnosed as having hypertension and who had 1 or more additional risk factors
      for cardiovascular disease were enrolled between September 1996 and December 1998
      and followed up until December 31, 2000. After a mean of 3 years of follow-up,
      the sponsor closed the study before unblinding the results. INTERVENTION:
      Initially, 8241 participants received 180 mg of COER verapamil and 8361 received 
      either 50 mg of atenolol or 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide. Other drugs (eg,
      diuretic, beta-blocker, or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) could be
      added in specified sequence if needed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: First occurrence of
      stroke, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular disease-related death. RESULTS: 
      Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were reduced by 13.6 mm Hg and 7.8 mm Hg
      for participants assigned to the COER verapamil group and by 13.5 and 7.1 mm Hg
      for partcipants assigned to the atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide group. There were
      364 primary cardiovascular disease-related events that occurred in the COER
      verapamil group vs 365 in atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide group (hazard ratio
      [HR], 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.88-1.18; P =.77). For fatal or
      nonfatal stroke, the HR was 1.15 (95% CI, 0.90-1.48); for fatal or nonfatal
      myocardial infarction, 0.82 (95% CI, 0.65-1.03); and for cardiovascular
      disease-related death, 1.09 (95% CI, 0.87-1.37). The HR was 1.05 (95% CI,
      0.95-1.16) for any prespecified cardiovascular disease-related event and 1.08
      (95% CI, 0.93-1.26) for all-cause mortality. Nonstroke hemorrhage was more common
      with participants in the COER-verapamil group (n = 118) compared with the
      atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide group (n = 79) (HR, 1.54 [95% CI, 1.16-2.04]; P
      =.003). More cardiovascular disease-related events occurred between 6 AM and noon
      in both the COER verapamil (99/277) and atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide (88/274) 
      groups; HR, 1.15 (95% CI, 0.86-1.53). CONCLUSIONS: The CONVINCE trial did not
      demonstrate equivalence of a COER verapamil-based antihypertensive regimen
      compared with a regimen beginning with a diuretic or beta-blocker. When
      considered in the context of other trials of calcium antagonists, these data
      indicate that the effectiveness of calcium-channel therapy in reducing
      cardiovascular disease is similar but not better than diuretic or beta-blocker
      treatment.

TI  - Outcomes with nifedipine GITS or Co-amilozide in hypertensive diabetics and
      nondiabetics in Intervention as a Goal in Hypertension (INSIGHT).
PG  - 431-6
AB  - To investigate the impact of treatment on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity,
      we assessed outcomes in patients with hypertension and diabetes who received
      co-amilozide or nifedipine in the International Nifedipine GITS Study:
      Intervention as a Goal in Hypertension. Participants had to be 55 to 80 years of 
      age, with hypertension (> or =150/95 or > or =160 mm Hg) and at least one
      additional cardiovascular risk factor. Patients received 30 mg nifedipine once
      daily or co-amilozide (25 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 2.5 mg amiloride) daily.
      Doses were doubled if target blood pressures (<140/90 mm Hg) were not achieved.
      Primary (composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, heart failure,
      and stroke) and secondary outcomes (composite of primary outcomes, including
      all-cause mortality and death from vascular and nonvascular causes) were assessed
      by means of intent-to-treat analyses. There was no significant difference in the 
      incidence of primary outcomes between nifedipine-treated and co-amilozide-treated
      patients with diabetes at baseline (n=1302) (8.3% versus 8.4%; relative risk,
      0.99, 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.42; P=1.00). A significant benefit for nifedipine-treated
      patients was seen for the composite secondary outcome (14.2% versus 18.7%;
      relative risk, 0.76, 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.97; P=0.03). Among patients without
      diabetes at baseline (n=5019), there was a significant difference in the
      incidence of new diabetes (nifedipine 4.3% versus co-amilozide 5.6%, P=0.023).
      Nifedipine GITS once daily is as effective as diuretic therapy in reducing
      cardiovascular complications in hypertensive diabetics. Nifedipine-treated
      patients were also less likely to have diabetes or have secondary events (a
      composite of all-cause mortality, death from a vascular cause, and death from a
      nonvascular cause) than co-amilozide recipients. Our results suggest that
      nifedipine could be considered as first-line therapy for hypertensive diabetics.

TI  - Verapamil is associated with an increased risk of cancer in the elderly: the
      Rotterdam study.
PG  - 98-105
AB  - The association between the use of calcium channel blockers (CCB) and cancer has 
      received ample attention, but is still controversial. In this study, we have
      tested the hypothesis that the observed association between CCB and cancer in
      earlier studies could be explained by residual confounding or by
      misclassification of exposure because of the use of cross-sectional data on drug 
      use. Data from the Rotterdam Study, a prospective population-based cohort study
      in the municipal area Ommoord, were used. The study population consisted of a
      cohort of 3204 participants aged 71 years or older who were followed from a
      baseline interview in the period 1991-1993 for the occurrence of incident cancer.
      Data on drug use were gathered at baseline and through the seven community
      pharmacies which served the Ommoord region during the study period between 1
      January 1991 and 1 January 1999. Incident cancer events were gathered from a
      nationwide registry of hospitalisation data and from a specialised cancer centre 
      in the Rotterdam region. We performed three analyses. First, we followed the
      method, and adjusted for the same risk factors, as in the earlier studies. In the
      second analysis, we included all risk factors that were univariately associated
      with cancer in the Rotterdam Study. In the third analysis, we included exposure
      to CCBs as time-varying co-variates, while adjusting for potential confounders.
      The relative risk (RR) of cancer associated with CCB was 1.4 (95% Confidence
      Interval (CI): 0.9-2.0) in the first analysis and lowered to 1.2 (95% CI:
      0.8-1.8) upon adjustment for the different co-variates in the second. In both
      analyses, however, verapamil was significantly associated with cancer with RRs of
      2.1 (95% CI: 1.1-4.0) and 2.0 (1.01-3.9), respectively, whereas no associations
      were found with the other CCB in this study, i.e. diltiazem and nifedipine. A
      significantly increased risk of cancer was found for intermediate daily doses of 
      verapamil and diltiazem. Intake of other antihypertensives such as beta-blocking 
      agents, diuretics and ACE-inhibitors was not associated with cancer. In the third
      analysis with exposure to CCB as time-varying co-variates, the risk increase was 
      non-significant for use of 2 years or less, 1.0 (95% CI: 0.7-1.5), and for use
      for a cumulative period of more than 2 years, 1.3 (95% CI: 0.8-2.0). However, in 
      all models the hazard ratio was statistically significantly increased for
      verapamil, but not for diltiazem and nifedipine. On the basis of these analyses, 
      we found no increase in cancer in users of diltiazem and nifedipine, nor in users
      of other antihypertensives. In line with earlier studies, however, we found an
      increased risk of cancer in users of verapamil. At variance with the conclusions 
      from several other studies, we think that it is too early to conclude that CCB
      are not associated with cancer.

TI  - Major outcomes in high-risk hypertensive patients randomized to
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or calcium channel blocker vs diuretic:
      The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial
      (ALLHAT).
PG  - 2981-97
AB  - CONTEXT: Antihypertensive therapy is well established to reduce
      hypertension-related morbidity and mortality, but the optimal first-step therapy 
      is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether treatment with a calcium channel
      blocker or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lowers the incidence of
      coronary heart disease (CHD) or other cardiovascular disease (CVD) events vs
      treatment with a diuretic. DESIGN: The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering
      Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), a randomized, double-blind,
      active-controlled clinical trial conducted from February 1994 through March 2002.
      SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 33 357 participants aged 55 years or older
      with hypertension and at least 1 other CHD risk factor from 623 North American
      centers. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned to receive
      chlorthalidone, 12.5 to 25 mg/d (n = 15 255); amlodipine, 2.5 to 10 mg/d (n =
      9048); or lisinopril, 10 to 40 mg/d (n = 9054) for planned follow-up of
      approximately 4 to 8 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was
      combined fatal CHD or nonfatal myocardial infarction, analyzed by
      intent-to-treat. Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, stroke, combined
      CHD (primary outcome, coronary revascularization, or angina with
      hospitalization), and combined CVD (combined CHD, stroke, treated angina without 
      hospitalization, heart failure [HF], and peripheral arterial disease). RESULTS:
      Mean follow-up was 4.9 years. The primary outcome occurred in 2956 participants, 
      with no difference between treatments. Compared with chlorthalidone (6-year rate,
      11.5%), the relative risks (RRs) were 0.98 (95% CI, 0.90-1.07) for amlodipine
      (6-year rate, 11.3%) and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.91-1.08) for lisinopril (6-year rate,
      11.4%). Likewise, all-cause mortality did not differ between groups. Five-year
      systolic blood pressures were significantly higher in the amlodipine (0.8 mm Hg, 
      P =.03) and lisinopril (2 mm Hg, P<.001) groups compared with chlorthalidone, and
      5-year diastolic blood pressure was significantly lower with amlodipine (0.8 mm
      Hg, P<.001). For amlodipine vs chlorthalidone, secondary outcomes were similar
      except for a higher 6-year rate of HF with amlodipine (10.2% vs 7.7%; RR, 1.38;
      95% CI, 1.25-1.52). For lisinopril vs chlorthalidone, lisinopril had higher
      6-year rates of combined CVD (33.3% vs 30.9%; RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.05-1.16);
      stroke (6.3% vs 5.6%; RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.02-1.30); and HF (8.7% vs 7.7%; RR,
      1.19; 95% CI, 1.07-1.31). CONCLUSION: Thiazide-type diuretics are superior in
      preventing 1 or more major forms of CVD and are less expensive. They should be
      preferred for first-step antihypertensive therapy.

TI  - Effect of blood pressure lowering and antihypertensive drug class on progression 
      of hypertensive kidney disease: results from the AASK trial.
PG  - 2421-31
AB  - CONTEXT: Hypertension is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the
      United States, with no known treatment to prevent progressive declines leading to
      ESRD. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of 2 levels of blood pressure (BP)
      control and 3 antihypertensive drug classes on glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
      decline in hypertension. DESIGN: Randomized 3 x 2 factorial trial with enrollment
      from February 1995 to September 1998. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1094
      African Americans aged 18 to 70 years with hypertensive renal disease (GFR, 20-65
      mL/min per 1.73 m(2)) were recruited from 21 clinical centers throughout the
      United States and followed up for 3 to 6.4 years. INTERVENTIONS: Participants
      were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 mean arterial pressure goals, 102 to 107 mm Hg
      (usual; n = 554) or 92 mm Hg or less (lower; n = 540), and to initial treatment
      with either a beta-blocker (metoprolol 50-200 mg/d; n = 441), an
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ramipril 2.5-10 mg/d; n = 436) or a
      dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, (amlodipine 5-10 mg/d; n = 217).
      Open-label agents were added to achieve the assigned BP goals. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURES: Rate of change in GFR (GFR slope); clinical composite outcome of
      reduction in GFR by 50% or more (or > or =25 mL/min per 1.73 m2) from baseline,
      ESRD, or death. Three primary treatment comparisons were specified: lower vs
      usual BP goal; ramipril vs metoprolol; and amlodipine vs metoprolol. RESULTS:
      Achieved BP averaged (SD) 128/78 (12/8) mm Hg in the lower BP group and 141/85
      (12/7) mm Hg in the usual BP group. The mean (SE) GFR slope from baseline through
      4 years did not differ significantly between the lower BP group (-2.21 [0.17]
      mL/min per 1.73 m2 per year) and the usual BP group (-1.95 [0.17] mL/min per 1.73
      m2 per year; P =.24), and the lower BP goal did not significantly reduce the rate
      of the clinical composite outcome (risk reduction for lower BP group = 2%; 95%
      confidence interval [CI], -22% to 21%; P =.85). None of the drug group
      comparisons showed consistent significant differences in the GFR slope. However, 
      compared with the metoprolol and amlodipine groups, the ramipril group manifested
      risk reductions in the clinical composite outcome of 22% (95% CI, 1%-38%; P =.04)
      and 38% (95% CI, 14%-56%; P =.004), respectively. There was no significant
      difference in the clinical composite outcome between the amlodipine and
      metoprolol groups. CONCLUSIONS: No additional benefit of slowing progression of
      hypertensive nephrosclerosis was observed with the lower BP goal.
      Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors appear to be more effective than
      beta-blockers or dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers in slowing GFR decline.

TI  - Relationship of antihypertensive treatment regimens and change in blood pressure 
      to risk for heart failure in hypertensive patients randomly assigned to doxazosin
      or chlorthalidone: further analyses from the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering 
      treatment to prevent Heart Attack Trial.
PG  - 313-20
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering treatment to prevent Heart
      Attack Trial reported that treatment initiated with doxazosin compared with
      chlorthalidone doubled the risk for heart failure in high-risk hypertensive
      patients (relative risk, 2.04 [95% CI, 1.79 to 2.32]). Patients assigned to
      doxazosin therapy had a mean in-trial systolic/diastolic blood pressure 3/0 mm Hg
      higher than that in patients assigned to chlorthalidone. Sixty-eight percent
      (6167 of 9061) of the former patients and 59% (9081 of 15 256) of the latter
      patients were given additional medications to achieve a target blood pressure of 
      less than 140/90 mm Hg. OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the influence of open-label
      antihypertensive drugs and subsequent blood pressure on relative risk for heart
      failure. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, active-controlled clinical trial.
      SETTING: 623 sites in the United States and Canada. PATIENTS: Hypertensive
      patients 55 years of age or older with at least one additional risk factor for
      cardiovascular disease. INTERVENTION: Chlorthalidone (12.5 to 25 mg/d) or
      doxazosin (2 to 8 mg/d) for a planned follow-up of 4 to 8 years. MEASUREMENTS:
      Data on blood pressure, medication, and incident heart failure (treated outside
      hospital, hospitalized, or fatal) from February 1994 through December 1999.
      RESULTS: After the treatment groups were categorized as having no exposure to
      open-label medications (monotherapy) or exposure to open-label therapy, the
      relative risk for heart failure with doxazosin versus chlorthalidone was 3.10
      (CI, 2.51 to 3.82) and 1.42 (CI, 1.20 to 1.69), respectively. After adjustment
      for follow-up systolic/diastolic blood pressure, the overall relative risk was
      2.00 (CI, 1.72 to 2.32). CONCLUSION: In high-risk patients with hypertension, the
      higher risk for heart failure while taking doxazosin compared with chlorthalidone
      is attenuated but not eliminated by adding other antihypertensive drugs. The
      small observed difference in systolic blood pressure does not explain this
      increased risk.

TI  - Randomized comparison of T-type versus L-type calcium-channel blockade on
      exercise duration in stable angina: results of the Posicor Reduction of Ischemia 
      During Exercise (PRIDE) trial.
PG  - 60-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mibefradil is a T-type calcium-channel antagonist and arterial
      vasodilator with negative chronotropic effects. It is not known if T-type
      calcium-channel blockade is superior to L-type calcium-channel blockade in
      patients with stable angina pectoris. METHODS: A multicenter, randomized,
      double-blind trial was conducted in patients with documented coronary disease and
      stable angina to compare a 360 mg dose of diltiazem CD with 100 mg dose of
      mibefradil. The primary end point was change in time to symptom-limited exercise 
      termination from baseline to 8 weeks. Secondary efficacy parameters included time
      to onset of persistent ST-segment depression, time to awareness of angina, and
      change in exercise duration from baseline to 2 and 4 weeks of treatment. RESULTS:
      A total of 121 patients were randomized to mibefradil and 113 to diltiazem CD. At
      8 weeks, the increase in exercise duration was 24.5 seconds greater in the
      mibefradil group (P =.017; 95% CI 4.4-44.7 seconds). At 8 weeks, time to
      development of > or =1 mm ST-segment depression was greater by 45.3 seconds (P
      =.0025; 95% CI 16.2-74.5) with mibefradil, but time to development of angina was 
      not significantly different. CONCLUSION: T-type calcium-channel antagonism with
      mibefradil improved treadmill exercise parameters compared with diltiazem in
      patients with chronic stable angina. Further investigation and development of
      antagonists of T-type calcium channels with fewer adverse drug interactions is
      warranted and may be promising in the management of ischemic heart disease.

TI  - The effects of calcium channel blockers on cardiovascular outcomes: a review of
      randomised controlled trials.
PG  - 71-8
AB  - The choice of antihypertensive treatment should be guided by evidence of a
      reduction in the risk of cardiovascular (CV) events and therefore improved
      long-term outcome. Using pre-determined criteria, ten randomised, controlled
      trials that assessed the effects of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) on CV events 
      in patients with hypertension were identified. Six of them enrolled a relatively 
      small number (< 1500) of hypertensive patients, whereas four of the studies were 
      much larger (> 4500 patients). The smaller studies produced mixed findings,
      especially those trials where CCBs were compared with diuretics; this may reflect
      methodological limitations and the impact of random error. The results from the
      four larger studies produced a consistent message: long-acting CCBs such as
      nifedipine, administered in a gastro-intestinal-transport-system (GITS)
      formulation, nitrendipine and diltiazem, reduce CV morbidity and mortality in
      hypertensive patients. In the one study that specifically enrolled high-risk
      hypertensive patients, nifedipine GITS was as effective as diuretic therapy in
      reducing CV events, and in all four larger studies sub-group analyses showed that
      the benefits of these CCBs extend to hypertensive patients with diabetes. The
      available evidence supports the use of these long-acting CCBs as a first-line
      treatment option in hypertensive patients.

TI  - Influence of age, sex and blood pressure on the principal endpoints of the Nordic
      Diltiazem (NORDIL) Study.
PG  - 1231-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the Nordic Diltiazem (NORDIL) Study was to compare
      patients with essential hypertension receiving calcium-antagonist-based treatment
      with diltiazem and similar patients receiving conventional
      diuretic/beta-blocker-based treatment, with respect to cardiovascular morbidity
      and mortality. OBJECTIVE: To assess the influence of age, sex, severity of
      hypertension and heart rate on treatment effects, in a sub-analysis. METHODS: The
      NORDIL study was prospective, randomized, open and endpoint-blinded. It enrolled,
      at health centres in Norway and Sweden, 10 881 patients aged 50-74 years who had 
      diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 100 mmHg or more. Systolic blood pressure (SBP)
      and DBP were decreased by 20.3/18.7 mmHg in the diltiazem group and by 23.3/18.7 
      mmHg in the diuretic/beta-blocker group - a significant difference in SBP (P <
      0.001). RESULTS: The incidence of the primary endpoint - a composite of
      cardiovascular death, cerebral stroke and myocardial infarction - was similar for
      the two treatments. Fatal and non-fatal stroke occurred in 159 patients in the
      diltiazem group and in 196 patients in the conventional treatment group [relative
      risk (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 0.99; P = 0.040], whereas
      there was a non-significant inverse tendency with respect to all myocardial
      infarction. There were significantly fewer cerebral strokes in patients receiving
      diltiazem in the subgroups with baseline SBP > 170 mmHg (n = 5420, RR 0.75, 95%
      CI 0.58 to 0.98; P = 0.032), DBP >/= 105 mmHg (n = 5881, RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.57 to 
      0.97; P = 0.030) and pulse pressure >/= 66 mmHg (n = 5461, RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.58
      to 0.99, P = 0.041), and more myocardial infarctions in those with heart rate
      less than 74 beats/min (n = 5303, RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.87; P = 0.040).
      However, the tendencies for fewer strokes and greater incidence of myocardial
      infarction were present across subgroups when results were analysed for age, sex,
      severity of hypertension and heart rate, and treatment-subgroup interaction
      analyses were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with a
      conventional diuretic/beta-blocker-based antihypertensive regimen, there were
      additional 25% reductions in stroke in the diltiazem-treated patients with blood 
      pressure or pulse pressure greater than the medians, and an increase in
      myocardial infarction in those with heart rate less than the median. Such
      findings may be attributable to chance, but the consistency of, in particular,
      the stroke findings may also suggest an ability of diltiazem, beyond conventional
      treatment, to prevent cerebral stroke in hypertensive patients with the greatest 
      cardiovascular risk.

TI  - Effect of verapamil in elderly patients with left ventricular diastolic
      dysfunction as a cause of congestive heart failure.
PG  - 57-62
AB  - Fifteen elderly patients with normal left ventricular (LV) systolic function and 
      New York Heart Association functional class II-III were studied. The effect of
      verapamil on LV diastolic function was assessed by congestive heart failure (CHF)
      score, treadmill exercise test, and Doppler echocardiography at baseline, and
      after each three-month treatment period (placebo or verapamil 120 mg once daily),
      separated by a one-week washout period before crossover. Blood pressure, heart
      rate, LV ejection fraction, LV mass, and cardiac output were unaltered by placebo
      or verapamil. Verapamil treatment significantly improved CHF score at 3 months
      (3.5 +/- 0.5, p<0.05) compared with baseline (5.6 +/- 0.5) or placebo (5.5 +/-
      0.5). The exercise time was similar at baseline (7.4 +/- 1.2 min) and after
      placebo (7.4 +/- 1.3 min) treatment but significantly (p<0.05) increased after
      verapamil (8.3 +/- 1.2 min) treatment. The ratio of mitral A wave
      duration/pulmonary venous atrial systolic reversal duration increased after
      verapamil (1.11 +/- 0.08) treatment compared with placebo (0.91 +/- 0.07, p<0.05)
      and baseline (0.89 +/- 0.08) which had similar durations. The isovolumic
      relaxation time was significantly (p<0.05) decreased from 84 +/- 12 ms at
      baseline and 86 +/- 13 ms with placebo to 73 +/- 9 ms with verapamil. The results
      of this study suggest that in elderly patients with Doppler evidence of diastolic
      dysfunction as the cause of CHF, three months treatment with verapamil can
      improve CHF, increase exercise tolerance and improve LV diastolic function.

TI  - Evidence-based evaluation of calcium channel blockers for hypertension: equality 
      of mortality and cardiovascular risk relative to conventional therapy.
PG  - 315-22
AB  - OBJECTIVES; We present a meta-analysis based on three recent, substantial,
      randomized outcome trials and several smaller trials that compared calcium
      channel blockers (CCBs) with conventional therapy (diuretics or beta-blockers) or
      with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. BACKGROUND: There is
      continuing uncertainty about the safety and efficacy of CCBs in the treatment of 
      hypertension. Previous meta-analyses conflict and suggest that CCBs increase
      myocardial infarction (MI) or protect from stroke. METHODS: Standard procedures
      for meta-analysis were used to analyze three major trials on 21,611 patients and 
      another three lesser studies to a total of 24,322 patients. RESULTS: Calcium
      channel blockers have a strikingly similar risk of total and cardiovascular
      mortality and of major cardiovascular events to conventional therapy. Calcium
      channel blockers give a lower risk of nonfatal stroke (-25%, p = 0.001) and a
      higher risk of total MI (18%, p = 0.013), chiefly nonfatal (18%). After
      performing the Bonferroni correction for multiplicity, these p values become
      0.004 and 0.052, respectively. When compared with ACE inhibitors in 1,318
      diabetic patients, CCBs had a substantially higher risk of nonfatal (relative
      risk [RR] = 2.259) and total MI (RR = 2.204, confidence interval 1.501 to 3.238; 
      p = 0.001 or 0.004 with Bonferroni correction). Total and cardiovascular
      mortality rates are similar. To confirm the hypothesis that ACE inhibitors are
      superior to CCBs in diabetic patients requires more trial data, especially with
      renal end points. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality (total and cardiovascular) and major
      cardiovascular events with CCBs were apparently similar to those events seen with
      conventional first-line therapy (diuretics or beta-blockers). Stroke reduction
      more than balanced increased MI. In diabetics, CCBs may be less safe than ACE
      inhibitors.

TI  - A double-blind, parallel-group study of amlodipine versus long-acting nitrate in 
      the management of elderly patients with stable angina.
PG  - 72-7
AB  - Ninety-seven elderly patients with stable angina were included in a 28-week,
      randomized, double-blind, parallel-group comparison of amlodipine 5-10 mg and
      isosorbide mononitrate 25-50 mg once daily. The total exercise time, as limited
      by angina, was recorded together with the median incidence per week of angina
      attacks and glyceryl trinitrate consumption. Safety was assessed by adverse event
      frequency, measurement of vital signs and laboratory parameters, and quality of
      life. At the final visit, the total exercise time was significantly greater
      relative to baseline with amlodipine than isosorbide mononitrate (final/baseline 
      difference: 112.2 vs. 32.2, p = 0.016). There were no statistically significant
      differences between the groups in relation to the incidence of adverse events.
      Once daily amlodipine provides significantly better control of stable angina than
      isosorbide mononitrate in this elderly population.

TI  - One-year study of felodipine or placebo for stage 1 isolated systolic
      hypertension.
PG  - 1118-23
AB  - Asubstantial number of older hypertensive patients have stage 1 isolated systolic
      hypertension (systolic blood pressure between 140 and 159 mm Hg and diastolic
      blood pressure <90 mm Hg), but there are currently no data showing that drug
      treatment is effective, safe, and/or beneficial. To compare the effects of active
      treatment compared with placebo on blood pressure, left ventricular hypertrophy, 
      and quality of life among older stage 1 isolated systolic hypertensive patients, 
      a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter clinical trial comparing 
      felodipine (2.5, 5, or 10 mg once daily) and matching placebo was performed in
      171 patients (49% male, average age 66+/-7 years, with 49% white and 30%
      Hispanic) with a baseline blood pressure of 149+/-7/83+/-6 mm Hg. During 52 weeks
      of treatment, patients randomized to active treatment achieved significantly
      lower blood pressures (137.0+/-11.7/80.2+/-7.6 mm Hg for extended-release
      felodipine versus 147.5+/-16.0/83.5+/-9.7 mm Hg for placebo, P<0.01 for each), a 
      reduced incidence of left ventricular hypertrophy (7% for extended release
      felodipine versus 24% for placebo, P<0.04), and improved quality of life (change 
      in Psychological General Well-Being index, 3.0+/-6.8 for extended-release
      felodipine versus -0.8+/-10.3 for placebo, P<0.01) versus baseline. There were no
      clinically significant differences between treatments in tolerability or adverse 
      effects. Stage 1 isolated systolic hypertension can be effectively and safely
      treated pharmacologically. Treatment reduced progression to the higher stages of 
      hypertension, reduced the incidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, and improved
      an overall measure of the quality of life. Larger and longer studies will be
      needed to document any long-term reduction in cardiovascular event rates
      associated with treating stage 1 systolic hypertension.

TI  - Efficacy, tolerability and influence on "quality of life" of nifedipine GITS
      versus amlodipine in elderly patients with mild-moderate hypertension.
PG  - 176-83
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The main purpose of this study was to compare efficacy, tolerability
      and influence on quality of life (QOL) of nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic
      system (NI) 30-60 mg once a day vs amlodipine (AM) 5-10 mg once a day in elderly 
      patients with mild-moderate hypertension. DESIGN: This was a randomized,
      double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter study. After a 2-week single-blind
      placebo run-in, patients were randomized to either NI 30 mg or AM 5 mg.
      Responders continued on the same dosage for 16 additional weeks, while
      non-responders were titrated to 60 mg NI or 10 mg AM. METHODS: Blood pressure was
      measured by mercury sphygmomanometer and efficacy equivalence of NI and AM tested
      by covariance analysis. Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was the primary efficacy
      parameter, its baseline value being taken as covariate while centers effect and
      treatment interaction were included as fixed effects in the analysis model. The
      secondary efficacy variables systolic blood pressure (SBP) and scores for QOL
      were analyzed according to the same model. RESULTS: At the end of the study,
      overall mean DBPs, calculated as least-square means (LSMEANS), in the "by
      protocol" population were 87.5 mmHg for NI and 86.7 for AM (difference 0.8 mmHg
      with 90% CI -1.2 to 2.8 mmHg). In the "by intention to treat" (ITT) population
      LSMEANS were 87.6 mmHg for NI and 86.4 mmHg for AM (difference 1.2 mmHg with 90% 
      CI -0.6 to 3.1 mmHg). SBP LSMEANS in the "by protocol" population were 147.7 mmHg
      for NI and 147.3 mmHg for AM (difference 0.3 mmHg, with 90% CI -3.7 to 4.3);
      corresponding values in the "by ITT" population were 148.0 mmHg for NI and 147.2 
      for AM (difference 0.8 mmHg, with 90% CI -2.8 to 4.6). Mean values for QOL
      parameters were not significantly different. A total of 173 episodes of adverse
      events were documented in 54 patients (26 NI and 28 AM), dropouts were 15 (20% of
      group) on NI and 21 (28%) on AM. CONCLUSIONS: NI 30-60 mg was shown to be as
      efficacious and safe as AM 5-10 mg in elderly patients with mild-moderate
      hypertension. QOL improved compared to baseline with no significant difference
      between the two drugs, thus confirming a positive class effect for calcium
      antagonists.

TI  - A random comparison of fosinopril and nifedipine GITS in patients with primary
      renal disease.
PG  - 1871-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate in a random comparison the capacity of an angiotensin
      converting enzyme inhibitor (fosinopril), and that of a long-acting
      dihydropiridine (nifedipine GITS) to modify the decay in renal function in
      patients with primary renal disease, exhibiting a progressive increase in serum
      creatinine during the previous 2 years. METHODS: A randomized, open-label,
      multicenter study with a minimum follow-up of 3 years. A total of 241 patients
      were included in the study. All of them were hypertensive and had a 25% or at
      least 0.5 mg/dl increase in the value of serum creatinine during the 24 months
      prior to entering the study. Initial doses of fosinopril and nifedipine GITS were
      10 and 30 mg respectively, and titration to 30 and 60 mg was performed if needed 
      to obtain the expected blood pressure goal (< 140/90 mmHg). Furosemide, atenolol,
      and doxazosin were added as second, third, and fourth drugs if necessary, for
      blood pressure control. The primary end-point of the study was the appearance of 
      double the serum creatinine values and/or the need to enter a dialysis programme.
      Secondary end-points were cardiovascular events, death, changes in 24 h
      proteinuria, and the evolution of serum creatinine. Data reflect the analysis
      performed by intention to treat. RESULTS: Mean age of the group was 54 +/- 14,
      and 59% were males. Primary glomerulonephritis (31%), nephrosclerosis (26%) and
      polycystic kidney disease (19%) were the three most frequent diagnostic findings.
      After 3 years of follow-up, 21% (27/127) of patients treated with fosinopril, and
      36% (40/112) of those receiving nifedipine GITS presented a primary end-point,
      (OR 0.47, 95% confidence intervals 0.26-0.84, P = 0.01). Renal survival was
      significantly better when fosinopril constituted the first step therapy (P =
      0.002). These results did not seem to be influenced by the type of primary renal 
      disease. Proteinuria decreased at the end of the study by a mean of 57% in the
      fosinopril group and increased by 7% in the group receiving dihydropiridine.
      Blood pressure control did not differ among groups for diastolic values. During
      follow-up, however, the patients receiving ACEi showed systolic blood pressure
      values 4-6 mmHg lower. CONCLUSION: In patients with chronic renal failure and
      hypertension due to primary renal disease, fosinopril significantly differed from
      nifedipine GITS by its capacity to slow the progressive decay in renal function. 
      The drugs also differed by their capacity to lower blood pressure. The better
      control, in particular of systolic blood pressure, in the fosinopril arm could
      have contributed in a relevant manner to the attainment of a better outcome when 
      the ACEi was employed.

TI  - Efficacy, tolerability, and impact on quality of life of long-term treatment with
      manidipine or amlodipine in patients with essential hypertension.
PG  - 642-50
AB  - This double-blind, multicenter trial compared antihypertensive efficacy,
      tolerability, and impact on quality of life of manidipine and amlodipine in
      patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Patients were randomly
      assigned to 48 weeks of once-daily manidipine, 10-20 mg, or amlodipine, 5-10 mg. 
      Patients who did not respond to treatment after 12 weeks were also given
      enalapril, 10-20 mg, for the study's duration. The main efficacy end point was
      equivalence in sitting systolic (SiSBP) and diastolic (SiDBP) blood pressure
      reduction between the two drugs after 8 weeks (per protocol analysis). An
      intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was performed in all patients with at least one
      efficacy determination during treatment. Quality of life was assessed by the
      "Subjective Symptoms Assessment Profile" (SSA-P) and "General Well-being
      Schedule" (GWBS), after 12 weeks of treatment. SiSBP reduction after 8 weeks was 
      equivalent for manidipine (15.2 mm Hg, n = 227) and amlodipine (17.0 mm Hg, n =
      219). The corresponding figure for SiDBP was 11.3 mm Hg for manidipine and 12.3
      mm Hg for amlodipine. In the larger ITT population SiDBP was similarly and
      significantly reduced by manidipine (from 102 +/- 5 to 88 +/- 9 mm Hg, n = 241)
      and amlodipine (from 101 +/- 5 to 87 +/- 8 mm Hg, n = 240). Similar results were 
      observed for SiSBP and standing SBP and DBP. Neither drug changed sitting or
      standing heart rate compared with baseline. SSA-P scores improved with manidipine
      but not amlodipine. GWBS total and partial scores increased more with manidipine 
      than with amlodipine. Safety profile favored manidipine, which was associated
      with significantly less ankle edema than was amlodipine. This study shows for the
      first time that long-term treatment with the long-acting calcium channel blocker 
      manidipine is as effective as treatment with amlodipine, has a better
      tolerability profile, and induces greater improvement in quality of life than
      amlodipine.

TI  - VERDICT: the Verapamil versus Digoxin Cardioversion Trial: A randomized study on 
      the role of calcium lowering for maintenance of sinus rhythm after cardioversion 
      of persistent atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 766-9
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Many relapses of atrial fibrillation (AF) occur, especially during 
      the first week(s) after electrical cardioversion (ECV). The aim of the present
      study was to compare in a randomized design the efficacy of verapamil
      (intracellular calcium lowering) versus digoxin (calcium increasing) for
      maintenance of sinus rhythm after ECV. METHODS AND RESULTS: Ninety-seven patients
      with persistent AF were randomized to verapamil (n = 49) or digoxin (n = 48) for 
      1 month before and 1 month after ECV. The first month after ECV, patients
      recorded heart rhythm using daily transtelephonic monitoring. No additional
      antiarrhythmic drugs were given. Of the 97 patients, 43 patients (20 verapamil)
      underwent ECV per protocol. Median previous AF duration was 18 and 26 days for
      verapamil and digoxin, respectively. There were no differences in atrial
      dimensions and underlying heart disease between the two groups. The success rate 
      of ECV was 75% versus 83% (P = NS). After 1 month, 47% versus 53% (P = NS) had
      recurrence of AF. Median time to recurrence was 5 days (range 0 to 26) versus 8
      days (range 2 to 28) (P = NS), respectively. CONCLUSION: Stand-alone
      intracellular calcium lowering by verapamil around ECV does not enhance
      cardioversion outcome.

TI  - Characteristics of 15,314 hypertensive patients at high coronary risk. The VALUE 
      trial. The Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-term Use Evaluation.
PG  - 83-91
AB  - Valsartan is an orally active, selective antagonist of the angiotensin II-1 (AT1)
      receptor developed for the treatment of hypertension. The Valsartan
      Antihypertensive Long-term Use Evaluation (VALUE) Trial of Cardiovascular Events 
      in Hypertension is a double-blind, randomized prospective, parallel group study
      designed to compare the effects of valsartan with those of the calcium-antagonist
      amlodipine on the reduction of cardiac morbidity and mortality. Patients with
      essential hypertension, aged 50 years and older, and at particularly high risk of
      coronary events were enrolled. 18,119 patients were screened and 15,314 patients 
      in 31 countries were randomized mainly between January 1998 and December 1999.
      These hypertensives had a mean blood pressure of 154.7/87.5 mmHg at the time of
      their randomization to blinded medication. The population comprises both genders 
      (men 57.6%), Caucasians (89.1%), mean age 67.2 years, mean body mass index 28.6
      kg/m2, coronary heart disease (45.8%), high cholesterol (33.0%), type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus (31.7%) and smokers (24.0%). More than 92% of the randomized
      participants had been treated for high blood pressure for at least 6 months when 
      screened for the study. The randomized population is now being treated (goal
      blood pressure < 140/90 mmHg) in adherence with the protocol until at least 1450 
      patients experience primary cardiac endpoint defined as clinically evident or
      aborted myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure or death caused 
      by coronary heart disease.

TI  - Effect of verapamil on prevention of atrial fibrillation in patients implanted
      with an implantable atrial defibrillator.
PG  - 503-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of verapamil in the prevention of atrial fibrillation (AF)
      in patients with recurrent AF is unknown. HYPOTHESIS: The aim of this study was
      to evaluate the effect of verapamil on the prevention of AF in patients implanted
      with an implantable atrial defibrillator (IAD). METHODS: The effects of verapamil
      (240 mg/day) on the total duration of AF, number of AF recurrences, and number of
      cardioversions were prospectively evaluated in a randomized, crossover fashion
      over an 8-week period in 11 patients (9 men, 2 women; mean age: 60 +/- 6 years)
      implanted with an IAD. RESULTS: Implantable atrial defibrillators successfully
      converted 13 of 14 (93%) spontaneous episodes of AF. There was no significant
      difference in the efficacy of cardioversion (86 vs. 100%, p = 0.8), the total
      duration of AF (173 +/- 198 vs. 270 +/- 241 h, p = 0.5), the number of AF
      episodes (8.5 +/- 9.0 vs. 9.3 +/- 10.2, p = 0.3), and the number of
      cardioversions (1.7 +/- 2.4 vs. 1.8 +/- 2.1 p = 0.7) with or without treatment
      with verapamil. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study suggest that
      treatment with verapamil has no significant effect on the prevention of AF in
      patients treated with an LAD.

TI  - Effect of ramipril vs amlodipine on renal outcomes in hypertensive
      nephrosclerosis: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 2719-28
AB  - CONTEXT: Incidence of end-stage renal disease due to hypertension has increased
      in recent decades, but the optimal strategy for treatment of hypertension to
      prevent renal failure is unknown, especially among African Americans. OBJECTIVE: 
      To compare the effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor
      (ramipril), a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (amlodipine), and a
      beta-blocker (metoprolol) on hypertensive renal disease progression. DESIGN,
      SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Interim analysis of a randomized, double-blind, 3 x 2 
      factorial trial conducted in 1094 African Americans aged 18 to 70 years with
      hypertensive renal disease (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] of 20-65 mL/min per 
      1.73 m(2)) enrolled between February 1995 and September 1998. This report
      compares the ramipril and amlodipine groups following discontinuation of the
      amlodipine intervention in September 2000. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were
      randomly assigned to receive amlodipine, 5 to 10 mg/d (n = 217), ramipril, 2.5 to
      10 mg/d (n = 436), or metoprolol, 50 to 200 mg/d (n = 441), with other agents
      added to achieve 1 of 2 blood pressure goals. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary 
      outcome measure was the rate of change in GFR; the main secondary outcome was a
      composite index of the clinical end points of reduction in GFR of more than 50%
      or 25 mL/min per 1.73 m(2), end-stage renal disease, or death. RESULTS: Among
      participants with a urinary protein to creatinine ratio of >0.22 (corresponding
      approximately to proteinuria of more than 300 mg/d), the ramipril group had a 36%
      (2.02 [SE, 0.74] mL/min per 1.73 m(2)/y) slower mean decline in GFR over 3 years 
      (P =.006) and a 48% reduced risk of the clinical end points vs the amlodipine
      group (95% confidence interval [CI], 20%-66%). In the entire cohort, there was no
      significant difference in mean GFR decline from baseline to 3 years between
      treatment groups (P =.38). However, compared with the amlodipine group, after
      adjustment for baseline covariates the ramipril group had a 38% reduced risk of
      clinical end points (95% CI, 13%-56%), a 36% slower mean decline in GFR after 3
      months (P =.002), and less proteinuria (P<.001). CONCLUSION: Ramipril, compared
      with amlodipine, retards renal disease progression in patients with hypertensive 
      renal disease and proteinuria and may offer benefit to patients without
      proteinuria.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the primary hypothesis that a newer antihypertensive treatment
      regimen (calcium channel blocker +/- an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor) 
      is more effective than an older regimen (beta-blocker +/- a diuretic) in the
      primary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD). To test a second primary
      hypothesis that a statin compared with placebo will further protect against CHD
      endpoints in hypertensive subjects with a total cholesterol < or = 6.5 mmol/l.
      DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, open, blinded endpoint trial with a
      double-blinded 2 x 2 factorial component. SETTING: Patients were recruited mainly
      from general practices. PATIENTS: Men and women aged 40-79 were eligible if their
      blood pressure was > or = 160 mmHg systolic or > or = 100 mmHg diastolic
      (untreated) or > or = 140 mmHg systolic or > or = 90 mmHg diastolic (treated) at 
      randomization. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received either amlodipine (5/ 10 mg) +/- 
      perindopril (4/8 mg) or atenolol (50/ 100 mg) +/- bendroflumethiazide (1.25/2.5
      mg) +K+ with further therapy as required to reach a blood pressure of < or = 140 
      mmHg systolic and 90 mmHg diastolic. Patients with a total cholesterol of < or = 
      6.5 mmol/l were further randomized to receive either atorvastatin 10 mg or
      placebo daily. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) and
      fatal coronary heart disease (CHD). RESULTS: 19 342 men and women were initially 
      randomized, of these 10297 were also randomized into the lipid-lowering limb. All
      patients had three or more additional cardiovascular risk factors. CONCLUSIONS:
      The study has 80% power (at the 5% level) to detect a relative difference of 20% 
      in CHD endpoints between the calcium channel blocker-based regimen and the
      beta-blocker-based regimen. The lipid-lowering limb of the study has 90% power at
      the 1% level to detect a relative difference of 30% in CHD endpoints between
      groups.

AB  - AIMS: Treatment of hypertension in patients with chronic renal failure has been
      shown to postpone the decline in renal function. Treatment with an ACE inhibitor 
      has been shown to be superior to conventional antihypertensive treatment, but it 
      is not known how an ACE inhibitor compares to treatment with a calcium channel
      blocker or to treatment with a combination of these drugs. The aim of the study
      was to evaluate the rate of decline in GFR in patients with chronic renal failure
      and hypertension treated with isradipine and spirapril as monotherapy and in
      combination. METHODS: Sixty patients with chronic renal failure and hypertension 
      were enrolled in the study. After enrollment, patients were followed
      prospectively for 6 months in the outpatient clinic on their usual
      antihypertensive medication, and then randomized to a double-blinded comparison
      of either spirapril 6 mg daily, isradipine 5 mg daily or spirapril 3 mg and
      isradipine 2.5 mg daily. After randomization, patients were followed for 21
      months or until the need for dialysis. Every 3 months before and 3.5 months after
      randomization the glomerular filtration rate was measured by 51Cr-EDTA clearance 
      and the effective renal plasma flow evaluated using the renal clearance of
      paraaminohippuric acid. RESULTS: Blood pressure and the decline in glomerular
      filtration rate did not differ between the groups before randomization. After
      randomization, the mean decline in the glomerular filtration rate was -0.32
      ml/(min x month x 1.73 m2) in the spirapril group, -0.58 ml/(min x month x 1.73
      m2) in the isradipine group and -0.14 ml/(min x month x 1.73 m2) in the
      combination group (p = 0.38). Twelve patients, 4 in each group, reached end-stage
      renal failure. No significant difference was found with respect to diastolic (p =
      0.10) or systolic blood pressure (p = 0.08) during the treatment period, but a
      trend towards a better blood pressure control in the combination group was
      present. During treatment, the rate of decline in renal plasma flow did not
      differ significantly between the groups (p = 0.09), neither did the changes in
      filtration fraction (FF) (p = 0.58) nor the mean FF (p = 0.22) during the
      treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated differences between the 3 treatment
      modalities in favor of combined therapy with respect to both the rate of decline 
      in GFR and blood pressure control, but the differences where insignificant. Thus,
      the treatments might differ, but we were unable to confirm this because of large 
      variation in GFR and small sample size.

TI  - The risk of limb deficiencies and other congenital abnormalities in children
      exposed in utero to calcium channel blockers.
PG  - 397-401
AB  - AIM: Calcium channel blockers given to pregnant rats have shown an increased
      prevalence of digital and limb defects and their safety in pregnant women has
      thus been questioned. We examined the risk of malformations following exposure in
      utero to calcium channel blockers. METHOD: We conducted a nationwide case-control
      study based on the Hungarian Case-Control Surveillance of Congenital
      Abnormalities and identified 22,865 cases with congenital abnormalities and
      31,151 population controls during the period 1980-1996. Data on drug exposure
      were obtained from official questionnaires and obligatory prenatal care logbooks.
      RESULTS: Among the cases, 586 mothers (2.6%) had been exposed to calcium channel 
      blockers during pregnancy compared with 907 controls (2.4%). The overall
      prevalence ratios for 17 congenital abnormalities varied between 1.1 and 1.4, and
      there was no significant increased risk of limb deficiencies or other congenital 
      abnormalities. CONCLUSION: Our data did not indicate an increased prevalence of
      congenital abnormalities in offspring exposed to calcium channel blockers in
      utero.

TI  - Amlodipine versus slow release metoprolol in the treatment of stable exertional
      angina pectoris (AMSA).
PG  - 475-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of amlodipine and slow release metoprolol on
      subjective symptoms and signs of ischaemia during bicycle ergometric exercise
      tests in patients with stable angina pectoris. DESIGN: A randomized double-blind 
      comparison of the two drugs in patients with documented coronary disease required
      to have at least three attacks of angina per week and to perform a
      symptom-limited exercise test with significant signs of ischaemia in the ECG.
      RESULTS: Out of 127 patients, 117 completed the study. Both amlodipine and
      metoprolol significantly increased total exercise time, total workload, time to
      onset of angina and time to 1 mm ST-depression with no significant differences
      between the drugs. Amlodipine was significantly more efficient than metoprolol in
      reducing ST-depression at maximum workload. Diary data revealed no differences in
      patients' self-rating of drug effects. CONCLUSIONS: Judged by suppression of
      subjective symptoms and performance on exercise tolerance tests amlodipine
      represents a useful alternative to metoprolol as monotherapy in stable angina
      pectoris.

TI  - Effects of ACE inhibitors, calcium antagonists, and other blood-pressure-lowering
      drugs: results of prospectively designed overviews of randomised trials. Blood
      Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists' Collaboration.
PG  - 1955-64
AB  - BACKGROUND: This programme of overviews of randomised trials was established to
      investigate the effects of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors,
      calcium antagonists, and other blood-pressure-lowering drugs on mortality and
      major cardiovascular morbidity in several populations of patients. We did
      separate overviews of trials comparing active treatment regimens with placebo,
      trials comparing more intensive and less intensive blood-pressure-lowering
      strategies, and trials comparing treatment regimens based on different drug
      classes. METHODS: The hypotheses to be investigated, the trials to be included,
      and the outcomes to be studied were all selected before the results of any
      participating trial were known. Individual participant data or group tabular data
      were provided by each trial and combined by standard statistical techniques.
      FINDINGS: The overview of placebo-controlled trials of ACE inhibitors (four
      trials, 12,124 patients mostly with coronary heart disease) revealed reductions
      in stroke (30% [95% CI 15-43]), coronary heart disease (20% [11-28]), and major
      cardiovascular events (21% [14-27]). The overview of placebo-controlled trials of
      calcium antagonists (two trials, 5520 patients mostly with hypertension) showed
      reductions in stroke (39% [15-56]) and major cardiovascular events (28% [13-41]).
      In the overview of trials comparing blood-pressure-lowering strategies of
      different intensity (three trials, 20,408 patients with hypertension), there were
      reduced risks of stroke (20% [2-35]), coronary heart disease (19% [2-33]), and
      major cardiovascular events (15% [4-24]) with more intensive therapy. In the
      overviews comparing different antihypertensive regimens (eight trials, 37,872
      patients with hypertension), several differences in cause-specific effects were
      seen between calcium-antagonist-based therapy and other regimens, but each was of
      borderline significance. INTERPRETATION: Strong evidence of benefits of ACE
      inhibitors and calcium antagonists is provided by the overviews of
      placebo-controlled trials. There is weaker evidence of differences between
      treatment regimens of differing intensities and of differences between treatment 
      regimens based on different drug classes. Data from continuing trials of
      blood-pressure-lowering drugs will substantially increase the evidence available 
      about any real differences that might exist between regimens.

TI  - Health outcomes associated with calcium antagonists compared with other
      first-line antihypertensive therapies: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled
      trials.
PG  - 1949-54
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several observational studies and individual randomised trials in
      hypertension have suggested that, compared with other drugs, calcium antagonists 
      may be associated with a higher risk of coronary events, despite similar
      blood-pressure control. The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare the effects 
      of calcium antagonists and other antihypertensive drugs on major cardiovascular
      events. METHODS: We undertook a meta-analysis of trials in hypertension that
      assessed cardiovascular events and included at least 100 patients, who were
      randomly assigned intermediate-acting or long-acting calcium antagonists or other
      antihypertensive drugs and who were followed up for at least 2 years. FINDINGS:
      The nine eligible trials included 27,743 participants. Calcium antagonists and
      other drugs achieved similar control of both systolic and diastolic blood
      pressure. Compared with patients assigned diuretics, beta-blockers,
      angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, or clonidine (n=15,044), those assigned
      calcium antagonists (n=12,699) had a significantly higher risk of acute
      myocardial infarction (odds ratio 1.26 [95% CI 1.11-1.43], p=0.0003), congestive 
      heart failure (1.25 [1.07-1.46], p=0.005), and major cardiovascular events (1.10 
      [1.02-1.18], p=0.018). The treatment differences were within the play of chance
      for the outcomes of stroke (0.90 [0.80-1.02], p=0.10) and all-cause mortality
      (1.03 [0.94-1.13], p=0.54). INTERPRETATION: In randomised controlled trials, the 
      large available database suggests that calcium antagonists are inferior to other 
      types of antihypertensive drugs as first-line agents in reducing the risks of
      several major complications of hypertension. On the basis of these data, the
      longer-acting calcium antagonists cannot be recommended as first-line therapy for
      hypertension.

TI  - Rhythm or rate control in atrial fibrillation--Pharmacological Intervention in
      Atrial Fibrillation (PIAF): a randomised trial.
PG  - 1789-94
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation is the most commonly encountered sustained
      cardiac arrhythmia. Restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm is believed by
      many physicians to be superior to rate control only. However, there are no
      prospective data that compare both therapeutic strategies. METHODS: The
      Pharmacological Intervention in Atrial Fibrillation (PIAF) trial was a randomised
      trial in 252 patients with atrial fibrillation of between 7 days and 360 days
      duration, which compared rate (group A, 125 patients) with rhythm control (group 
      B, 127 patients). In group A, diltiazem was used as first-line therapy and
      amiodarone was used in group B. The primary study endpoint was improvement in
      symptoms related to atrial fibrillation. FINDINGS: Over the entire observation
      period of 1 year, a similar proportion of patients reported improvement in
      symptoms in both groups (76 responders at 12 months in group A vs 70 responders
      in group B, p=0.317). Amiodarone administration resulted in pharmacological
      restoration of sinus rhythm in 23% of patients. Walking distance in a 6 min walk 
      test was better in group B compared with group A, but assessment of quality of
      life showed no differences between groups. The incidence of hospital admission
      was higher in group B (87 [69%] out of 127 vs 30 [24%] out of 125 in group A,
      p=0.001). Adverse drug effects more frequently led to a change in therapy in
      group B (31 [25%] patients compared with 17 [14%] in group A, p=0.036).
      INTERPRETATION: With respect to symptomatic improvement in patients with atrial
      fibrillation, the therapeutic strategies of rate versus rhythm control yielded
      similar clinical results overall. However, exercise tolerance is better with
      rhythm control, although hospital admission is more frequent. These data may
      serve as a basis to select therapy in individual patients.

TI  - Monotherapy with amlodipine or atenolol versus their combination in stable angina
      pectoris.
PG  - 763-70
AB  - BACKGROUND: The basic cause of angina pectoris is imbalance between the metabolic
      needs of the myocardium and the capacity of the coronary circulation to deliver
      sufficient oxygenated blood to satisfy these needs. HYPOTHESIS: The study was
      undertaken to evaluate whether the effect of combined amlodipine and atenolol
      therapy on patients with stable angina pectoris and with ST-depression during
      exercise testing and 48-h ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring is superior 
      to that of either agent given alone. METHODS: Patients with stable angina
      pectoris and ST depression during exercise and ambulatory monitoring were
      randomized to receive amlodipine (n = 116) or atenolol (n = 116), or both (n =
      119). All patients were also treated with short- and long-acting nitrates. The
      design was a double-blind, randomized, triple-arm parallel group study with 10
      weeks of administration of the test medication. RESULTS: In terms of time to
      onset of ST depression > 1 mm, time to onset of angina, total exercise time,
      maximum achieved workload, and peak intensity of angina, amlodipine and atenolol 
      alone were as effective as their combination. During ambulatory monitoring,
      atenolol was more effective than amlodipine regarding total time and number of
      ST-depression episodes, and as effective as the combined drugs. CONCLUSION: For
      individual patients with stable angina pectoris, combination of a beta blocker
      with a calcium antagonist is not necessarily more effective than either drug
      given alone.

TI  - Effect of amlodipine on the progression of atherosclerosis and the occurrence of 
      clinical events. PREVENT Investigators.
PG  - 1503-10
AB  - BACKGROUND: The results of angiographic studies have suggested that calcium
      channel-blocking agents may prevent new coronary lesion formation, the
      progression of minimal lesions, or both. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Prospective
      Randomized Evaluation of the Vascular Effects of Norvasc Trial (PREVENT) was a
      multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-masked clinical trial
      designed to test whether amlodipine would slow the progression of early coronary 
      atherosclerosis in 825 patients with angiographically documented coronary artery 
      disease. The primary outcome was the average 36-month angiographic change in mean
      minimal diameters of segments with a baseline diameter stenosis of 30%. A
      secondary hypothesis was whether amlodipine would reduce the rate of
      atherosclerosis in the carotid arteries as assessed with B-mode ultrasonography, 
      which measured intimal-medial thicknesses (IMT). The rates of clinical events
      were also monitored. The placebo and amlodipine groups had nearly identical
      average 36-month reductions in the minimal diameter: 0.084 versus 0.095 mm,
      respectively (P:=0.38). In contrast, amlodipine had a significant effect in
      slowing the 36-month progression of carotid artery atherosclerosis: the placebo
      group experienced a 0.033-mm increase in IMT, whereas there was a 0. 0126-mm
      decrease in the amlodipine group (P:=0.007). There was no treatment difference in
      the rates of all-cause mortality or major cardiovascular events, although
      amlodipine use was associated with fewer cases of unstable angina and coronary
      revascularization. CONCLUSIONS: Amlodipine has no demonstrable effect on
      angiographic progression of coronary atherosclerosis or the risk of major
      cardiovascular events but is associated with fewer hospitalizations for unstable 
      angina and revascularization.

TI  - Morbidity and mortality in patients randomised to double-blind treatment with a
      long-acting calcium-channel blocker or diuretic in the International Nifedipine
      GITS study: Intervention as a Goal in Hypertension Treatment (INSIGHT).
PG  - 366-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of antihypertensive drugs newer than diuretics and
      beta-blockers has not been established. We compared the effects of the
      calcium-channel blocker nifedipine once daily with the diuretic combination
      co-amilozide on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in high-risk patients with
      hypertension. METHODS: We did a prospective, randomised, double-blind trial in
      Europe and Israel in 6321 patients aged 55-80 years with hypertension (blood
      pressure > or = 150/95 mm Hg, or > or = 160 mm Hg systolic). Patients had at
      least one additional cardiovascular risk factor. We randomly assigned patients
      nifedipine 30 mg in a long-acting gastrointestinal-transport-system (GITS)
      formulation (n=3157), or co-amilozide (hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg [corrected] plus
      amiloride 2.5 mg; n=3164). Dose titration was by dose doubling, and addition of
      atenolol 25-50 mg or enalapril 5-10 mg. The primary outcome was cardiovascular
      death, myocardial infarction, heart failure, or stroke. Analysis was done by
      intention to treat. FINDINGS: Primary outcomes occurred in 200 (6.3%) patients in
      the nifedipine group and in 182 (5.8%) in the co-amilozide group (18.2 vs 16.5
      events per 1000 patient-years; relative risk 1.10 [95% CI 0.91-1.34], p=0.35).
      Overall mean blood pressure fell from 173/99 mm Hg (SD 14/8) to 138/82 mm Hg
      (12/7). There was an 8% excess of withdrawals from the nifedipine group because
      of peripheral oedema (725 vs 518, p<0.0001), but serious adverse events were more
      frequent in the co-amilozide group (880 vs 796, p=0.02). Deaths were mainly
      non-vascular (nifedipine 176 vs co-amilozide 172; p=0.81). 80% of the primary
      events occurred in patients receiving randomised treatment (157 nifedipine, 147
      co-amilozide, difference 0.33% [-0.7 to 1.4]). INTERPRETATION: Nifedipine once
      daily and co-amilozide were equally effective in preventing overall
      cardiovascular or cerebrovascular complications. The choice of drug can be
      decided by tolerability and blood-pressure response rather than long-term safety 
      or efficacy.

TI  - Randomised trial of effects of calcium antagonists compared with diuretics and
      beta-blockers on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertension: the
      Nordic Diltiazem (NORDIL) study.
PG  - 359-65
AB  - BACKGROUND: Calcium antagonists are a first-line treatment for hypertension. The 
      effectiveness of diltiazem, a non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, in reducing
      cardiovascular morbidity or mortality is unclear. We compared the effects of
      diltiazem with that of diuretics, beta-blockers, or both on cardiovascular
      morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients. METHODS: In a prospective,
      randomised, open, blinded endpoint study, we enrolled 10,881 patients, aged 50-74
      years, at health centres in Norway and Sweden, who had diastolic blood pressure
      of 100 mm Hg or more. We randomly assigned patients diltiazem, or diuretics,
      beta-blockers, or both. The combined primary endpoint was fatal and non-fatal
      stroke, myocardial infarction, and other cardiovascular death. Analysis was done 
      by intention to treat. FINDINGS: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were
      lowered effectively in the diltiazem and diuretic and beta-blocker groups
      (reduction 20.3/18.7 vs 23.3/18.7 mm Hg; difference in systolic reduction
      p<0.001). A primary endpoint occurred in 403 patients in the diltiazem group and 
      in 400 in the diuretic and beta-blocker group (16.6 vs 16.2 events per 1000
      patient-years; relative risk 1.00 [95% CI 0.87-1.15], p=0.97). Fatal and
      non-fatal stroke occurred in 159 patients in the diltiazem group and in 196 in
      the diuretic and beta-blocker group (6.4 vs 7.9 events per 1000 patient-years;
      0.80 [0.65-0.99], p=0.04) and fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction in 183
      and 157 patients (7.4 vs 6.3 events per 1000 patient-years; 1.16 [0.94-1.44],
      p=0.17). INTERPRETATION: Diltiazem was as effective as treatment based on
      diuretics, beta-blockers, or both in preventing the combined primary endpoint of 
      all stroke, myocardial infarction, and other cardiovascular death.

TI  - Plasma norepinephrine and atrial natriuretic peptide in heart failure: influence 
      of felodipine in the third Vasodilator Heart Failure Trial. V-HeFT III
      investigators.
PG  - 97-107
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reflex activation of the sympathetic nervous system by short-acting
      dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists has been reported to harm
      hypertensive patients. Different neurohormonal profiles and their response to
      treatment may influence the effectiveness of dihydropyridine vasodilator
      treatment of heart failure. METHODS: Four hundred fifty men with left ventricular
      (LV) systolic dysfunction were administered standard heart failure treatment and 
      felodipine extended release (ER) or placebo in the Vasodilator Heart Failure
      Trial III (V-HeFT III). Plasma norepinephrine (PNE) levels, atrial natriuretic
      peptide (ANP) levels, exercise capacity, LV ejection fraction (EF), cardiac
      dimensions and function, and arrhythmia frequency were measured. Hospital-free
      survival for baseline neurohormonal classes was assessed. RESULTS: Distributions 
      of ANP and PNE levels at baseline in patients with heart failure of ischemic and 
      nonischemic causes were virtually identical. ANP levels at baseline were
      inversely related to LVEF (r = -0.39; P = .0001), exercise duration (r = -0.19; P
      = .0001), and peak oxygen consumption (r = -0.27; P = .008) and directly related 
      to LV (r = 0.23; P = .0006) and right ventricular dilatation (r = 0.23; P =
      .0008). The increase in ANP levels between baseline and 3 months (P = .02) and 1 
      year (P = .03) was significantly less in the felodipine-ER group than in the
      placebo group, but PNE levels did not differ between treatment groups.
      Hospital-free survival was directly related to baseline ANP (P = .0002) and PNE
      levels (P = .004). All-cause mortality was related to baseline PNE levels (P =
      .02) but not baseline ANP levels. CONCLUSION: Levels of ANP and PNE hormones are 
      related to LV dysfunction, exercise performance, and hospital-free survival in
      heart failure and PNE levels are related to all-cause mortality. Treatment with
      felodipine ER did not adversely affect survival in any neurohormone subclass.

TI  - Progress report on the Nordic diltiazem study (NORDIL): an outcome study in
      hypertensive patients.
PG  - 296-9
AB  - NORDIL--the Nordic Diltiazem Study (NORDIL)--is a prospective, randomized, open
      blinded-endpoint (PROBE), multicenter, parallel-group morbidity/mortality outcome
      study in hypertensive patients designed to compare an intervention strategy based
      on the calcium antagonist diltiazem with a strategy based on conventional
      antihypertensive drug treatment (diuretics or beta-adrenergic blockers). Patient 
      recruitment was started in Norway and Sweden in September 1992, and ended on
      December 15, 1996, when 10.896 male and female patients, aged 50-74 years, with
      essential hypertension had been randomized. In this paper we describe the
      baseline data of the patient cohort and blood pressures achieved in the two
      treatment groups during the early part of the study. The patient cohort consists 
      of 5294 males and 5602 females with a mean age of 59.6 and 60.3 years,
      respectively. Concomitant disorders and risk factors in the cohort are: smoking
      22%, ischemic heart disease 3.0%, previous myocardial infarction (MI) 2.0%,
      previous stroke 1.5%, diabetes mellitus 7.0%, and renal impairment 0.3%. There
      were no differences between the treatment groups in these respects. The blood
      pressure treatment goal is a target diastolic blood pressure of < or =90 mmHg or 
      a 10% diastolic blood pressure reduction from the inclusion pressure. In the
      treatment group randomized to a diltiazem-based treatment strategy, blood
      pressure was 174/106 mmHg at baseline and 156/90 mmHg after 12 months of
      follow-up on active treatment. In the group randomized to a conventional
      treatment strategy, baseline blood pressure at randomization was 173/106 mmHg and
      153/90 mmHg after 12 months on active therapy. The NORDIL study will terminate on
      October 31, 1999 and the final results should be available by mid-2000.

TI  - Felodipine improves left ventricular emptying in patients with chronic heart
      failure: V-HeFT III echocardiographic substudy of multicenter reproducibility and
      detecting functional change.
PG  - 19-28
AB  - BACKGROUND: The echocardiographic substudy of the Vasodilator-Heart Failure Trial
      III (V-HeFT III) aimed to determine if felodipine treatment in patients with
      heart failure who were taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor had a
      favorable effect on left ventricular (LV) structure and function. Earlier V-HeFT 
      trials showed that hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate improved ejection fraction
      (EF) and survival, whereas enalapril achieved greater survival with smaller
      increases in EF. Would the combination of a potent vasodilator and enalapril
      produce greater improvements in function and survival? METHODS AND RESULTS:
      Doppler-echocardiographic data were collected from 260 males with heart failure
      who were randomized to felodipine or a placebo. Mean intrasubject differences
      between baseline, at 3 months, and at 12 months were compared. Intersite and
      intrareader reproducibilities were measured from duplicate recordings and
      readings. At 3 months, no changes in ultrasound variables from baseline occurred 
      in either group. At 12 months, felodipine patients achieved greater increases in 
      EF, shortening of LV end-systolic length, and increases in stroke volume index.
      Reproducibility coefficients of variation were 7.4% (EF), 6.0% (end-diastolic
      length), and 13.0% (stroke volume index). CONCLUSIONS: The echocardiographic
      substudy showed that felodipine, added to heart failure therapy, increased EF,
      shortened end-systolic length, and increased stroke volume index. The changes
      were small and confirmed that reproducibility from multiple laboratories can be
      coordinated into a useful research tool.

TI  - Bisoprolol and nifedipine retard in elderly hypertensive patients: effect on
      quality of life.
PG  - 205-12
AB  - Subjects over the age 60 with sustained sitting diastolic pressures of 95-115 mm 
      Hg were randomised to a regime based on bisoprolol (n = 368) or nifedipine retard
      (n = 379) for 24 weeks. The goal diastolic pressure was < or =90 mm Hg and to
      achieve this, double-blind medication could be doubled (5/10 mg bisoprolol, 40/80
      mg nifedipine retard) or hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg (unblinded) could be added to 
      the higher dose. In an intention-to-treat analysis, 309 subjects in both the
      bisoprolol and nifedipine retard treated group provided at least a baseline and a
      second quality of life assessment (82%). An excess of symptoms was observed in
      the nifedipine group for oedema of the legs, nocturia, constipation, racing heart
      and heart thumping. Fewer patients reported wheeze in the nifedipine group. For
      quality of life, there were no statistically significant differences between the 
      two groups after 8 weeks. However, when analysing the results of the last
      available assessment (usually at 24 weeks) there were significant (P < 0.05)
      improvements in tension/anxiety, anger/ hostility, vigour/activity, and
      confusion/bewilderment, assessed by the Profile of Mood States (POMS) in patients
      receiving bisoprolol in comparison to those receiving nifedipine retard. The
      Sickness Impact Profile and objective tests of cognitive function did not differ 
      statistically between the two groups. Quality of life was maintained at a good
      level on both treatments with advantages for bisoprolol in certain areas. Journal
      of Human Hypertension (2000) 14, 205-212.

TI  - Effects of amlodipine on exercise tolerance, quality of life, and left
      ventricular function in patients with heart failure from left ventricular
      systolic dysfunction.
PG  - 503-10
AB  - BACKGROUND: A preliminary study suggested that the long-acting late-generation
      calcium-channel blocker amlodipine has favorable effects on exercise tolerance
      and is safe to use in heart failure, in contrast to earlier generation agents.
      The goal of 2 multicenter studies was to assess the effect of adjunctive therapy 
      with amlodipine in addition to standard therapy on exercise capacity, quality of 
      life, left ventricular function, and safety parameters in patients with heart
      failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction. METHODS: Two large multicenter
      trials examining the effects of amlodipine on these parameters over a 12-week
      period of therapy were undertaken in patients with mild to moderate heart failure
      and left ventricular systolic dysfunction. A total of 437 patients with stable
      heart failure were studied in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      prospective design. RESULTS: Amlodipine at a dose of 10 mg/day in addition to
      standard therapy in such patients was associated with no significant difference
      in change in exercise tolerance on a Naughton protocol compared with placebo in
      each trial. Among all patients taking amlodipine, exercise time increased 53 +/- 
      9 (SE) seconds; exercise time for those taking placebo increased 66 +/- 9 seconds
      (P = not significant). There were no significant differences in changes of
      quality of life parameters between amlodipine- and placebo-treated patients, and 
      there were no significant differences in symptom scores or New York Heart
      Association classification between groups. Left ventricular function (measured as
      ejection fraction) improved 3. 4% +/- 0.5% in amlodipine-treated patients and
      1.5% +/- 0.5% in placebo-treated patients (P =.007). There was no statistically
      significant excess of important adverse events (episodes of worsening heart
      failure in 10% amlodipine-treated vs 6.3% of placebo-treated patients) or
      differences in need for changes in background medication between groups.
      CONCLUSIONS: The addition of 10 mg of amlodipine per day to standard therapy in
      patients with heart failure is associated with no significant improvement in
      exercise time compared with placebo therapy over a 12-week period, and there was 
      no increased incidence of adverse events. These data suggest that the addition of
      amlodipine to standard therapy in heart failure will not result in additional
      efficacy per se beyond standard therapy.

TI  - The evidence regarding the drugs used for ventricular rate control.
PG  - 47-59
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to determine what drugs are most efficacious for
      controlling the ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation. SEARCH
      STRATEGY: We conducted a systematic review of the literature published before May
      1998, beginning with searches of The Cochrane Collaboration's CENTRAL database
      and MEDLINE. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included English-language articles describing
      randomized controlled trials of drugs used for heart rate control in adults with 
      atrial fibrillation. DATA COLLECTION/ANALYSIS: Abstracts of trials were reviewed 
      independently by 2 members of the study team. We reviewed English-language
      abstracts of non-English-language publications to assess qualitative consistency 
      with our results. MAIN RESULTS: Forty-five articles evaluating 17 drugs met our
      criteria for review. In the 5 trials of verapamil and 5 of diltiazem, heart rate 
      was reduced significantly (P <.05), both at rest and with exercise, compared with
      placebo, with equivalent or improved exercise tolerance in 6 of 7 comparisons. In
      7 of 12 comparisons of a beta-blocker with placebo, the beta-blocker was
      efficacious for control of resting heart rate, with evidence that the effect is
      drug specific, as nadolol and atenolol proved to be most efficacious. All 9
      comparisons demonstrated good heart rate control with beta-blockers during
      exercise, although exercise tolerance was compromised in 3 of 9 comparisons. In 7
      of 8 trials, digoxin administered alone slowed the resting heart rate more than
      placebo, but it did not significantly slow the rate during exercise in 4 studies.
      The trials evaluating other drugs yielded insufficient evidence to support their 
      use, but those drugs may yet be promising. CONCLUSIONS: The calcium-channel
      blockers verapamil or diltiazem, or select beta-blockers are efficacious for
      heart rate control at rest and during exercise for patients with atrial
      fibrillation without a clinically important decrease in exercise tolerance.
      Digoxin is useful when rate control during exercise is less a concern.

TI  - Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and breast
      cancer.
PG  - 349-53
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has been
      linked to a decreased risk of developing cancer, and longer-term use of calcium
      channel blockers (CCBs) has been associated with an increased risk of developing 
      cancer in general and breast cancer in particular. METHODS: Using data from the
      General Practice Research Database, we conducted a large case-control analysis.
      Previous exposure to ACE inhibitors, CCBs, and beta-blockers was compared between
      3706 postmenopausal women who were diagnosed with incident breast cancer between 
      1992 and 1997 and 14155 matched-control women. RESULTS: Compared with nonusers of
      antihypertensive drugs, women who used ACE inhibitors (odds ratio [OR], 1.0; 95% 
      confidence interval [CI], 0.7-1.5), CCBs (OR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.7-1.2), or
      beta-blockers (OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.8-1.2) for 5 or more years were not at an
      increased or decreased risk of developing breast cancer (adjusted for smoking and
      body mass index [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of
      height in meters]). The risk of breast cancer did not differ between users of
      different ACE inhibitors or different CCBs (dihydropyridines, diltiazem
      hydrochloride, and verapamil hydrochloride) or between users of short-acting (OR,
      1.0; 95% CI, 0.7-1.4) or sustained-release (OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.8-1.3) nifedipine 
      preparations. CONCLUSION: The findings of this large case-control analysis do not
      support the hypothesis that longer-term use of ACE inhibitors or CCBs affects the
      risk of developing breast cancer.

      artery disease at academic medical centers in the United States and Canada.
      Prospective Randomized Evaluation of the Vascular Effects of Norvasc Trial
      (PREVENT) Investigators.
PG  - 343-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) has been well
      established for patients with preexisting coronary artery disease (CAD). However,
      limited information is available assessing the extent to which these medications 
      are prescribed in academic medical centers. METHODS: The use of LLT for patients 
      with CAD was prospectively evaluated in 825 men and women who were recruited from
      16 academic medical centers in the United States and Canada to participate in the
      Prospective Evaluation of the Vascular Events of Norvasc Trial (PREVENT). The
      assessment of LLT use during the 3-year trial was evaluated in patients receiving
      amlodipine therapy and placebo; levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
      (LDL-C) were used to assess the impact of LLT. RESULTS: Despite a baseline
      prevalence of LLT in 42% of men (38% in 1994), half of the patients had high
      levels of LDL-C (>3.36 mmol [>130 mg/dL]). During the subsequent 3 years, the
      prevalence of elevated LDL-C levels dropped in men (29%) but remained stagnant in
      women (48%). These changes were associated with increased LLT in men (55%) but
      not in women (35%) (P = .04). In 1994, the LDL-C target goal (<2.59 mmol/L [<100 
      mg/dL]) was attained in 17% of men and 6% of women (P = .006). At study
      completion in 1997, the LDL-C target goal was achieved in 31% of men and only 12%
      of women (P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the relatively low
      treatment rates of hyperlipidemia among patients with CAD overall and women in
      particular who were participating in a clinical trial at academic medical centers
      in the United States and Canada. Because LLT has been proven to reduce future
      cardiovascular events, these results suggest that more intensive efforts should
      be promoted in order to maximize CAD reduction.

TI  - Long-term effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and metabolic
      control in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients.
PG  - 590-600
AB  - Long-term effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and metabolic
      control in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients. BACKGROUND: In hypertensive
      type 2 diabetic patients, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
      inhibitors is associated with a lower incidence of cardiovascular events than
      those treated with calcium channel-blocking agents. However, the long-term renal 
      effects of ACE inhibitors in these patients remain inconclusive. In 1989, we
      commenced a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study to examine the
      anti-albuminuric effects of enalapril versus nifedipine (slow release) in 102
      hypertensive, type 2 diabetic patients. These patients have been followed up for 
      a mean trial duration of 5.5 +/- 2.2 years. We examined the determinants,
      including the effect of ACE inhibition on clinical outcomes in these patients.
      METHODS: After a six-week placebo-controlled, run-in period, 52 patients were
      randomized double-blind to receive nifedipine (slow release) and 50 patients to
      receive enalapril. After the one-year analysis, which confirmed the superior
      anti-albuminuric effects of enalapril (-54%) over nifedipine (+11%), all patients
      were continued on their previously assigned treatment with informed consent. They
      were subdivided into normoalbuminuric (N = 43), microalbuminuric (N = 34), and
      macroalbuminuric (N = 25) groups based on two of three 24-hour urinary albumin
      excretion (UAE) measurements during the run-in period. Renal function was shown
      by the 24-hour UAE, creatinine clearance (CCr), and the regression coefficient of
      the yearly plasma creatinine reciprocal (beta-1/Cr). Clinical endpoints were
      defined as death, cardiovascular events, and/or renal events (need for renal
      replacement therapy or doubling of baseline plasma creatinine). RESULTS: In the
      whole group, patients treated with enalapril were more likely to revert to being 
      normoalbuminuric (23.8 vs. 15.4%), and fewer of them developed macroalbuminuria
      (19.1 vs. 30.8%) compared with the nifedipine-treated patients (P < 0.05). In the
      microalbuminuric group, treatment with enalapril (N = 21) was associated with a
      13.0% (P < 0.01) reduction in 24-hour UAE compared with a 17.3% increase in the
      nifedipine group (N = 13). In the macroalbuminuric patients, enalapril treatment 
      (N = 11) was associated with stabilization compared with a decline in renal
      function in the nifedipine group, as shown by the beta-1/Cr (0.65 +/- 4.29 vs.
      -1.93 +/- 2.35 1/micromol x 10-3, P < 0.05) after adjustment for baseline values.
      Compared with the normoalbuminuric and microalbuminuric patients, those with
      macroalbuminuria had the lowest mean CCr (75.5 +/- 24.1 vs. 63.5 +/- 21.3 vs.
      41.9 +/- 18.5 mL/min, P < 0.001) and the highest frequency of clinical events
      (4.7 vs. 5.9 vs. 52%, P < 0. 001). On multivariate analysis, beta-1/Cr (R2 =
      0.195, P < 0.001) was independently associated with baseline HbA1c (beta =
      -0.285, P = 0.004), whereas clinical outcomes (R2 = 0.176, P < 0.001) were
      independently related to the mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (beta =
      2.426, P = 0.018), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (beta = -8.797, P =
      0.03), baseline UAE (beta = 0.002, P = 0.04), and mean CCr during treatment (beta
      = -0.211, P = 0.006). CONCLUSION: In this prospective cohort analysis involving
      102 hypertensive, type 2 diabetic patients with varying degrees of albuminuria
      followed up for a mean duration of five years, we observed the importance of good
      metabolic and blood pressure control on the progression of albuminuria and renal 
      function. Treatment with enalapril was associated with a greater reduction in
      albuminuria than with nifedipine in the entire patient group, and especially in
      those with microalbuminuria. In the macroalbuminuric patients, the rate of
      deterioration in renal function was also attenuated by treatment with enalapril.

TI  - Randomized double-blind comparison of a calcium antagonist and a diuretic in
      elderly hypertensives. National Intervention Cooperative Study in Elderly
      Hypertensives Study Group.
PG  - 1129-33
AB  - Although diuretics are recommended for the treatment of hypertension, decreased
      diuretic use and increased calcium antagonist use necessitate a comparison of the
      efficacy of these drugs in preventing cardiovascular events. Patients >/=60 years
      of age with systolic blood pressure of 160 to 220 mm Hg and diastolic blood
      pressure <115 mm Hg were enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned to 20 mg of
      sustained-release nicardipine hydrochloride twice daily or 2 mg of
      trichlormethiazide once daily by the double-dummy method and followed up for 5
      years. A total of 414 patients were analyzed: 204 in the nicardipine group and
      210 in the diuretic group. Blood pressure at entry was 172/94 mm Hg and 173/93 mm
      Hg, respectively, and decreased to 147/81 mm Hg and 147/79 mm Hg, respectively.
      Cardiovascular morbidity rates per 1000 persons per year were similar in the
      nicardipine and diuretic groups (27.8 and 26.8, respectively; P=0.923). The sex- 
      and age-adjusted risk ratio for the nicardipine group was 0.973 (95% confidence
      interval, 0.514 to 1.839, P=0.932). The calcium antagonist and diuretic groups
      had a similarly decreased rate of cardiovascular events.

TI  - Calcium channel blockers and mortality in elderly patients with myocardial
      infarction.
PG  - 2341-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although calcium channel blockers are a useful therapy in relieving
      angina, lowering blood pressure, and slowing conduction of atrial fibrillation,
      growing evidence has cast doubt on their safety in patients with coronary
      disease. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between calcium channel blocker
      therapy at hospital discharge and mortality in a population-based sample of
      elderly patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction. DESIGN:
      Retrospective cohort study using data from medical charts and administrative
      files. SETTING: All acute care hospitals in 46 states. PATIENTS: All Medicare
      patients with a principal diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction consecutively 
      discharged from the hospital alive during 8-month periods between 1994 and 1995
      (N = 141,041). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Mortality at 30 days and 1 year. RESULTS:
      Calcium channel blockers were widely prescribed at hospital discharge to elderly 
      patients with myocardial infarction between 1994 and 1995 (n = 51,921), the most 
      commonly prescribed being diltiazem (n = 21,175), nifedipine (n = 12,670),
      amlodipine (n = 11,683), and verapamil (n = 3639). After adjusting for illness
      severity and concomitant medication use, patients who were prescribed calcium
      channel blockers at hospital discharge did not have increased risk for 30-day or 
      1-year mortality, with the exception of the few (n = 116) treated with bepridil. 
      Bepridil differs from other calcium channel blockers because of its tendency to
      prolong repolarization, and its association with proarrhythmic effects in elderly
      patients. CONCLUSION: We did not identify a mortality risk in a large consecutive
      sample of elderly patients with myocardial infarction, which supports the need
      for additional prospective trials examining calcium channel blocker therapy for
      ischemic heart disease.

TI  - Cohort study on calcium channel blockers, other cardiovascular agents, and the
      prevalence of depression.
PG  - 230-3
AB  - AIMS: Some reports have suggested that calcium channel blockers may be associated
      with an increased incidence of depression or suicide. There is a paucity of
      evidence from large scale studies. The aim of this study was to assess rates of
      depression with calcium channel antagonists using data from prescription event
      monitoring studies. METHODS: Observational studies on large cohorts of patients
      using lisinopril, enalapril (ACE inhibitors), nicardipine (type 2 calcium channel
      blocker) and diltiazem (type 3 calcium channel blocker) were conducted, using
      prescription-event monitoring. Rates of depression in the different drugs and
      rate ratios (95% CI) were computed. RESULTS: The crude overall rates of
      depression during treatment were 1.89, 1.92 and 1.62 per 1000 patient months for 
      the ACE inhibitors, diltiazem and nicardipine, respectively. Using the ACE
      inhibitors as the reference group, the rate ratios for depression were 1.07 (0.
      82-1.40) and 0.86 (0.69-1.08) for diltiazem and nicardipine, respectively.
      CONCLUSIONS: This study does not support the hypothesis that calcium channel
      blockers are associated with depression, when considering patients treated in
      general practice in the UK.

TI  - Effects of long-acting versus short-acting calcium channel blockers among older
      survivors of acute myocardial infarction.
PG  - 512-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recent studies have highlighted the potentially harmful effects of
      short-acting calcium channel blockers, especially of the dihydropyridine type, in
      patients with coronary heart disease. Some have argued that long-acting calcium
      channel blockers are safer, but few outcome data exist. The objective of the
      study was to compare the occurrence of adverse outcomes among recipients of
      long-acting versus short-acting calcium channel blockers, with dihydropyridines
      and non-dihydropyridines compared separately. SETTING: The New Jersey Medicare
      population. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study using linked Medicare and drug
      claims data. PARTICIPANTS: Older survivors of acute myocardial infarction (MI)
      occurring in 1989 and 1990. Eligible subjects had survived at least 30 days after
      the MI, participated in Medicare and a drug benefits program, and were prescribed
      a single type of either a long-acting or a short-acting calcium channel blocker
      within 90 days after the MI. MEASUREMENTS: The two outcome measures were rates of
      all-cause mortality and cardiac rehospitalization. Using separate Cox regression 
      models for dihydropyridines (nifedipine, nicardipine) and non-dihydropyridines
      (diltiazem, verapamil), we examined these outcomes for recipients of long-acting 
      compared with short-acting calcium channel blockers. RESULTS: Of the 833 patients
      eligible for the study, 160 were prescribed long-acting and 673 short-acting
      calcium channel blockers. Clinical characteristics of long-acting and
      short-acting users were comparable. During 2 years of follow-up, 221 deaths and
      300 rehospitalizations occurred. Controlling for age, sex, race, and indicators
      of disease severity and comorbidity, the relative risk of dying for recipients of
      long-acting, compared with short-acting, dihydropyridines was .42 (95% confidence
      interval (CI), 0.21-0.86). For cardiac rehospitalization, the relative risk was
      0.57 (95% CI, 0.34-0.94). For the long-acting versus short-acting
      nondihydropyridines, the adjusted relative risk of dying was 1.43 (95% CI,
      0.88-2.32), and for cardiac rehospitalization, .65 (95% CI, 0.40-1.05).
      CONCLUSION: Use of long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers after
      acute MI was associated with substantially lower rates of cardiac
      rehospitalization and death compared with use of their short-acting counterparts.
      More data are needed to address the possibility that long-acting, compared with
      short-acting, non-dihydropyridines could decrease rehospitalization rates but
      increase mortality.

TI  - Physical Symptoms Distress Index: a sensitive tool to evaluate the impact of
      pharmacological agents on quality of life.
PG  - 693-700
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine whether the degree of stress associated with adverse
      physical side effects correlates with overall quality of life (QOL) and
      compliance rates. To determine if instruments used to assess QOL can detect
      differences between treatments that have no known central nervous system effects.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, parallel group study
      evaluated 180 to 480 mg of controlled onset, extended release (COER)-verapamil (n
      = 259) or 30 to 120 mg/d of nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS)
      (n = 269) in men and women between 21 and 80 years of age with stages 1 to 3
      hypertension. A battery of questions evaluating psychological well-being and a
      physical symptom distress index was administered after a 4-week placebo washout
      (baseline) and after 10 weeks of treatment or at dropout. RESULTS: Both
      treatments effectively lowered blood pressure, and there were no significant
      between-group differences in psychosocial QOL. A difference in the level of
      physical symptom distress was detected between treatments (P = .002; multivariate
      analysis of variance), with 7 significant univariate treatment effects, all
      favoring COER-verapamil, being noted-pedal edema, polyuria, rapid heart beat or
      palpitations, hives, muscle cramps, abdominal cramps, and headaches.
      Constipation-related distress increased significantly (P = .001) but to a similar
      extent with both treatments. The difference in symptom distress tended to predict
      compliance as there were more withdrawals in the nifedipine GITS group (n = 85)
      vs COER-verapamil group (n = 64) (P = .08). CONCLUSIONS: Patient-assessed
      physical symptom distress is a sensitive, simple technique to evaluate the effect
      of antihypertensive medications on QOL and tolerability, as shown by its ability 
      to detect the improvement associated with COER-verapamil. Depending on the agents
      involved, the Physical Symptom Distress Index may more closely predict dropout
      rates than the traditional psychosocial instruments, as suggested by the lower
      dropout rate in the COER-verapamil group. Thus, in studying treatment effects on 
      QOL, both the distress of physical symptoms and the impact of psychosocial
      factors should be evaluated.

TI  - Incidence of cancer in postmyocardial infarction patients treated with
      short-acting nifedipine and diltiazem. Secondary Prevention Group.
PG  - 1369-74
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent reports suggest a possible link between nifedipine (but not
      diltiazem) and an increased risk of cancer in patients being treated with calcium
      antagonists. METHODS: A total of 1054 postmyocardial infarction patients were
      divided randomly into those being treated with calcium antagonists (n = 566
      [nifedipine, 425 patients and diltiazem, 141 patients]) and controls (no calcium 
      antagonist; n = 488). The patients were followed for 26.3 months, and the
      incidences of cardiac events as well as cancer were compared among the 3 groups. 
      RESULTS: Thirteen patients (2.7%) in the control group developed cancer, whereas 
      15 patients in the nifedipine group (3.5%; odds ratio, 1.34; 95% confidence
      interval [95% CI], 0.63-2.85) and 3 patients in the diltiazem group (2.1%; odds
      ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.27-2.93) developed cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Diltiazem appears 
      to present no increased risk of cancer. The incidence of cancer was slightly
      higher in the patients receiving nifedipine than in those not being treated with 
      a calcium antagonist, which is consistent with earlier reports; however, this
      increase was not statistically significant.

TI  - Ventricular rate control in chronic atrial fibrillation during daily activity and
      programmed exercise: a crossover open-label study of five drug regimens.
PG  - 304-10
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We compared the effects of five pharmacologic regimens on the
      circadian rhythm and exercise-induced changes of ventricular rate (VR) in
      patients with chronic atrial fibrillation (CAF). BACKGROUND: Systematic
      comparison of standardized drug regimens on 24 h VR control in CAF have not been 
      reported. METHODS: In 12 patients (11 male, 69+/-6 yr) with CAF, the effects on
      VR by 5 standardized daily regimens: 1) 0.25 mg digoxin, 2) 240 mg diltiazem-CD, 
      3) 50 mg atenolol, 4) 0.25 mg digoxin + 240 mg diltiazem-CD, and 5) 0.25 mg
      digoxin + 50 mg atenolol; were studied after 2 week treatment assigned in random 
      order. The VR data were analyzed by ANOVA with repeated measures. The circadian
      phase differences were evaluated by cosinor analysis. RESULTS: The 24-h mean
      (+/-SD) values of VR (bpm) were - digoxin: 78.9 +/- 16.3, diltiazem: 80.0+/-15.5,
      atenolol: 75.9+/-11.7, digoxin + diltiazem: 67.3+/-14.1 and digoxin + atenolol:
      65.0+/-9.4. Circadian patterns were significant in each treatment group (p <
      0.001). The VR on digoxin + atenolol was significantly lower than that on digoxin
      (p < 0.0001), diltiazem (p < 0.0002) and atenolol (p < 0.001). The time of peak
      VR on Holter was significantly delayed with regimens 3 and 5 which included
      atenolol (p < 0.03). During exercise, digoxin and digoxin + atenolol treatments
      resulted in the highest and lowest mean VR respectively. The exercise Time-VR
      plots of all groups were nearly parallel (p = ns). The exercise duration was
      similar in all treatment groups (p = ns). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that 
      digoxin and diltiazem, as single agents at the doses tested, are least effective 
      for controlling ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation during daily activity.
      Digoxin + atenolol produced the most effective rate control reflecting a
      synergistic effect on the AV node. The data provides a basis for testing the
      effects of chronic suppression of diurnal fluctuations of VR on left atrial and
      ventricular function in CAF.

TI  - Safety of nifedipine in angina pectoris: a meta-analysis.
PG  - 24-31
AB  - -Our objective was to compare cardiovascular event rates in patients with stable 
      angina receiving nifedipine as monotherapy or combination therapy and in active
      drug controls. A MEDLARS search of published articles from 1966 to 1995 in
      English, French, German, Italian, or Spanish, supplemented by a manual search of 
      bibliographies, identified 60 randomized controlled trials that met protocol
      criteria. Blinded articles were extracted by 2 physicians. The pooled risks of
      death, withdrawal, and cardiovascular event were computed and expressed as odds
      ratios (ORs) for all nifedipine formulations and relative to same study control
      drug regimens. Thirty cardiovascular events were reported in 2635 nifedipine
      exposures (1.14%) and 19 events in 2655 other active drug exposures (0.72%).
      Unadjusted ORs for nifedipine versus controls were 1.40 (95% CI, 0.56 to 3.49)
      for major events (death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke,
      revascularization procedure), 1.75 (95% CI, 0.83 to 3.67) for increased angina,
      and 1.61 (95% CI, 0.91 to 2.87) for all events (major events plus increased
      angina). Episodes of increased angina were more frequent on immediate-release
      nifedipine (OR, 4.19 [95% CI, 1.41 to 12.49]) and on nifedipine monotherapy (OR, 
      2.61 [95% CI, 1.30 to 5.26]). The OR for immediate-release nifedipine was
      significantly higher than that for sustained-release/extended-release nifedipine 
      (P=0.001), and the OR for nifedipine monotherapy was higher than that for
      nifedipine combination therapy (P=0.03). Increased risks of cardiovascular events
      in patients with stable angina on nifedipine were due primarily to more episodes 
      of increased angina, confined to the immediate-release formulation and to
      nifedipine monotherapy.

TI  - Quality of life and calcium channel blockade with nifedipine GITS versus
      amlodipine in hypertensive patients in Spain. Gastrointestinal Therapeutic
      System.
PG  - 1839-47
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Compliance with hypertension treatment is affected by
      treatment-related factors (complexity, side effects), efficacy and
      compound-specific effects that impact on quality of life. This study examined the
      differences in quality of life produced by two once-daily calcium channel
      blockers using different delivery systems: nifedipine gastrointestinal
      therapeutic system (GITS) and amlodipine. DESIGN: This was a double-blind,
      double-dummy, randomized clinical trial comparing nifedipine GITS (30 mg) and
      amlodipine (5 mg) for 24 weeks following a placebo run-in. Clinical, laboratory
      evaluations and quality-of-life data were assessed at screening, baseline
      randomization and three times during active therapy. SETTING: The study was
      conducted in 13 medical clinics in Spain. PATIENTS: The sample comprised 430
      screened and 356 randomized patients with mild to moderate hypertension
      (diastolic blood pressure 95-114 mmHg). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in systolic
      and diastolic blood pressure and in health-related quality of life were the main 
      outcome measures. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between active
      treatment groups in the blood pressure changes (systolic blood pressure:
      nifedipine GITS -15.5 mmHg; amlodipine -15.7 mmHg). Spontaneous adverse events
      consistent with calcium channel blockage were not different. The nifedipine GITS 
      group improved in all quality-of-life measures except Sexual Symptom Distress and
      showed a significantly greater improvement than amlodipine in overall Quality of 
      Life (P< 0.05), General Perceived Health (P < 0.026) and its subscale Vitality (P
      < 0.019). The amlodipine group declined in overall Quality of Life, General
      Perceived Health, Vitality and Sleep Disturbance, and significantly in Sexual
      Symptom Distress (P < 0.045). However, this group improved in self-reported
      Cognitive Functioning (P=0.036), Mental Acuity (P < 0.005) and
      Detachment/disorientation (P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest
      compound-specific effects on quality of life that may be due to differences in
      the delivery system. Nifedipine GITS is short-acting (2 h half-life) and is
      delivered continuously over a 24 h period, while amlodipine has a half-life of 40
      h, which may produce more sustained low-level effects. While a more beneficial
      profile was observed for nifedipine, amlodipine demonstrated potential positive
      effects on cognitive functioning.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The management of permanent atrial fibrillation (PAF) consists
      primarily of long-term anticoagulation with either aspirin or warfarin to prevent
      systemic embolization, and modulation of ventricular rate (VR) to improve cardiac
      function by prolonging the ventricular diastolic filling time. HYPOTHESIS: The
      effects of slow-release formulations of gallopamil (100 mg b.i.d.), diltiazem
      (120 mg b.i.d.), or verapamil (120 mg b.i.d.) on VR were evaluated in 18 patients
      with PAF without organic heart disease. METHODS: In all patients, each treatment 
      was administered randomly, was compared with oral digoxin, and was assessed by
      24-h Holter monitoring during daily life and by a 6-min walking test. RESULTS:
      There were no significant differences in mean and minimum VR recorded during 24-h
      Holter monitoring among the four treatments. Peak heart rates recorded during the
      6-min walking test with digoxin treatment was 167 +/- 12 beats/min. This was
      significantly reduced by gallopamil (149 +/- 23 beats/min, p = 0.01), diltiazem
      (142 +/- 24 beats/min, p < 0.001), and verapamil (137 +/- 30 beats/min, p <
      0.001). There were no significant differences in peak VR during the walking test 
      among the three calcium antagonists. Pauses of > 3 s were observed in 3 of 18
      (17%) patients who received digoxin (max 3.4 s) and in 5 of 18 (28%) patients who
      received diltiazem (max 3.4 s); p = NS. Periods of bradycardia < 30 beats/min
      were observed in 5 of 18 (28%) patients during digoxin treatment, and in 3 of 18 
      (17%) patients during treatment with gallopamil, diltiazem, and verapamil; p =
      NS. CONCLUSION: Gallopamil, diltiazem, or verapamil are superior to digoxin in
      controlling VR during mild exercise in patients with PAF without organic heart
      disease. The reduction of peak VR is obtainable without further slowing of
      resting VR. However, gallopamil appears to be the least effective calcium blocker
      at controlling resting and exercise VR; thus, there are no advantages over the
      other calcium blockers in its use in the clinical setting.

TI  - Rationale and design of the International Verapamil SR/Trandolapril Study
      (INVEST): an Internet-based randomized trial in coronary artery disease patients 
      with hypertension.
PG  - 1228-37
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of the International Verapamil SR/Trandolapril 
      Study (INVEST) is to compare the risk for adverse outcomes (all-cause mortality, 
      nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI] or nonfatal stroke) in hypertensive patients 
      with coronary artery disease (CAD) treated with either a calcium antagonist-based
      or a noncalcium antagonist-based strategy. BACKGROUND: Treatment recommendations 
      for hypertension include initial therapy with a diuretic or beta-adrenergic
      blocking agent, for which reductions in morbidity and mortality are documented
      from randomized trials but are less than expected from epidemiologic data. For
      this reason, recent attention has focused on calcium antagonists or
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. While these agents reduce blood
      pressure, outcome data from large randomized trials are lacking, but some
      case-control data, dominated by short-acting dihydropyridines, suggest an
      increased risk of cardiovascular events. These studies had methodologic
      limitations and did not differentiate among calcium antagonist types and
      formulations. Several studies differentiating among calcium antagonist types and 
      an overview of published randomized trials show no increased risk with verapamil 
      and suggestion for benefit in CAD patients. METHODS: A total of 27,000 CAD
      patients with hypertension will be randomized at 1,500 primary care sites to
      receive either a calcium antagonist-based (verapamil) or
      beta-blocker/diuretic-based (atenolol/hydrochlorothiazide) antihypertensive care 
      strategy. The study uses a novel, electronic "paper-less" system for direct
      on-screen data entry, randomization and drug distribution from a mail pharmacy
      linked to the coordination center via the Internet. RESULTS: Contract
      negotiations with the United States and international sites are ongoing. Patients
      being enrolled are predominantly elderly (72% aged 60 years or older) men (54%), 
      with either an abnormal coronary angiogram or prior MI (71%). In addition to
      hypertension, CAD and elderly age, most patients (89%) have one or more
      associated conditions (diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking, cerebral or peripheral
      vascular disease, etc.) contributing to increased risk for adverse outcome. While
      26% have diabetes, most of these are noninsulin dependent. Using the protocol
      strategies, target blood pressures (according to JNC VI) have been reached in 58%
      at the fourth visit, and as expected most (89%) are requiring multiple
      antihypertensive drugs. CONCLUSION: The design and baseline characteristics of
      the initial patients recruited for a prospective, randomized, international,
      multicenter study comparing two therapeutic strategies to control hypertension in
      CAD patients are described.

TI  - Effect of amlodipine on mode of death among patients with advanced heart failure 
      in the PRAISE trial. Prospective Randomized Amlodipine Survival Evaluation.
PG  - 881-7
AB  - Investigations of calcium antagonists in patients with advanced heart failure
      have raised concern over an increased risk of worsening heart failure and heart
      failure deaths. We assessed the effect of amlodipine on cause-specific mortality 
      in such patients enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      trial. In total, 1,153 patients in New York Heart Association class IIIb or IV
      heart failure were randomized to receive amlodipine or placebo, along with
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, and digitalis. Over a median
      14.5 months of follow-up, 413 patients died. Cardiovascular deaths accounted for 
      89% of fatalities, 50% of which were sudden deaths and 45% of which were due to
      pump failure, with fewer attributed to myocardial infarction (3.3%) or other
      cardiovascular causes (1.6%). Amlodipine treatment resulted in a greater relative
      reduction in sudden deaths (21%) than in pump failure deaths (6.6%) overall. When
      patients were classified by etiology of heart failure (ischemic or nonischemic), 
      cause-specific mortality did not differ significantly between treatment groups in
      the ischemic stratum. In the nonischemic stratum, however, sudden deaths and pump
      failure deaths were reduced by 38% and 45%, respectively, with amlodipine. Thus, 
      when added to digitalis, diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors 
      in patients with advanced heart failure, amlodipine appears to have no effect on 
      cause-specific mortality in ischemic cardiomyopathy, but both pump failure and
      sudden deaths appear to be decreased in nonischemic heart failure patients
      treated with amlodipine.

      Cardiovascular Endpoints (CONVINCE) Trial.
PG  - 370-90
AB  - The Controlled ONset Verapamil INvestigation of Cardiovascular Endpoints
      (CONVINCE) Trial is a randomized, prospective, double-blind, parallel-group,
      two-arm, actively controlled, multicenter, international 5-year clinical trial
      involving 15,000 patients. CONVINCE will compare the incidence of fatal or
      nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), fatal or nonfatal stroke, or
      cardiovascular-disease-related death in two antihypertensive treatment regimens. 
      One treatment arm begins with controlled onset-extended release (COER)-verapamil,
      which has its major antihypertensive effect 6-12 hours after administration. The 
      other arm (standard of care (SOC)) begins with either hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 
      or atenolol, one of which is preselected by the investigator for an individual
      patient prior to randomization. Secondary objectives include comparisons of the
      regimens for each of the components of the primary endpoint (separately), death
      or hospitalization related to cardiovascular disease, efficacy in lowering blood 
      pressure to goal, primary events occurring between 6 am and noon, all-cause
      mortality, withdrawals from blinded therapy, cancer, and hospitalizations due to 
      bleeding. Patients may be enrolled if they are hypertensive and at least 55 years
      of age and have an established second risk factor for cardiovascular disease.
      Initial medications include COER-verapamil (180 mg/d), HCTZ (12.5 mg/d), or
      atenolol (50 mg/d). Initial doses are doubled if blood pressure (BP) does not
      reach goal (systolic BP < 140 mm and diastolic BP < 90 mm Hg). If BP is not
      controlled by the higher dose of the initial medication, HCTZ is added to
      COER-verapamil, or the SOC choice not initially selected is added in the SOC arm.
      An ACE-inhibitor is recommended (although nearly any open-label medication is
      allowed) as the third step for patients whose BP is not adequately controlled or 
      who have a contraindication to one of the two SOC medications. Patients take two 
      sets of tablets daily, one in the morning and one in the evening. Although most
      patients switch from an established antihypertensive medication to randomized
      treatment, untreated patients with stages I-III hypertension (SBP between 140 and
      190 or DBP between 90 and 110 mm Hg) are eligible. Outcomes are monitored by an
      independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board. Enrollment began during the third
      quarter of 1996, and follow-up is to be completed in the third quarter of 2002.

TI  - Amlodipine versus diltiazem as additional antianginal treatment to atenolol.
      Centralised European Studies in Angina Research (CESAR) Investigators.
PG  - 133-6
AB  - The antianginal efficacy and tolerability of amlodipine and diltiazem were
      compared in a double-blind randomized trial of 97 patients with angina resistant 
      to atenolol alone. Both amlodipine and diltiazem significantly reduced the
      frequency of angina attacks (p <0.001) and glyceryl trinitrate consumption (p
      <0.05 to p <0.01). During Holter monitoring, both treatments reduced the overall 
      frequency of ambulatory myocardial ischemia, although changes did not reach
      statistical significance. Exercise test parameters (total exercise time, time to 
      angina, time to ST depression, and maximum ST depression) tended to improve with 
      both treatments, but changes did not achieve statistical significance relative to
      baseline or to each other. Both drugs were generally well tolerated. Adverse
      events occurred in 15 patients in the amlodipine group (30%) and in 17 patients
      in the diltiazem group (36%), but patients taking diltiazem reported almost twice
      as many adverse events (30) patients taking amlodipine (18). Quality of life, as 
      assessed by total Nottingham Health Profile Scores, was not significantly
      different between treatments. The addition of either once-daily amlodipine or
      twice-daily sustained release diltiazem improved symptoms in patients with angina
      resistant to atenolol alone, but diltiazem was associated with more frequent and 
      more serious adverse events.

TI  - Value of the addition of amlodipine to atenolol in patients with angina pectoris 
      despite adequate beta blockade.
PG  - 128-32
AB  - Anginal patients who remain symptomatic despite optimally dosed beta blockade may
      also be given dihydropyridine calcium antagonists. This treatment regimen was
      examined in a double-blind parallel, randomized, controlled study in 147 patients
      with angina and positive bicycle exercise tests despite optimal beta blockade
      with atenolol (heart rate at rest <60 beats/min). Patients were randomized to
      atenolol and/or placebo (control), and atenolol and/or amlodipine. The main
      outcome measurement was exercise tolerance after 8 weeks compared with baseline. 
      After 8 weeks, no significant differences in time to 0.1-mV ST-segment
      depression, time to chest pain, and time to end of exercise were observed. The
      number of patients with chest pain during exercise decreased significantly in the
      amlodipine group (p = 0.04 vs controls). The subgroup of patients with an early
      (<6 minutes) onset of chest pain at baseline showed a significant increase in
      time to chest pain after amlodipine (p = 0.0001 vs controls). In the amlodipine
      group, ST depression and rate-pressure product at submaximum comparable workload 
      decreased to 0.4 mm (0.56) (p = 0.03 vs controls) and 1.223 (2.652) beats/ min x 
      mm Hg (p = 0.01 vs controls). The number of patients in each group with adverse
      events was not different. The addition of amlodipine to the treatment of patients
      with myocardial ischemia, despite optimal beta blockade, is well tolerated and
      may lead to improvement in symptomatic anginal patients, who have a rapid onset
      of exercise-induced ischemia.

TI  - Outcome results of the Fosinopril Versus Amlodipine Cardiovascular Events
      Randomized Trial (FACET) in patients with hypertension and NIDDM.
PG  - 597-603
AB  - OBJECTIVE: ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists may favorably affect serum
      lipids and glucose metabolism. The primary aim of the Fosinopril Versus
      Amlodipine Cardiovascular Events Randomized Trial (FACET) was to compare the
      effects of fosinopril and amlodipine on serum lipids and diabetes control in
      NIDDM patients with hypertension. Prospectively defined cardiovascular events
      were assessed as secondary outcomes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Inclusion
      criteria included a diagnosis of NIDDM and hypertension (systolic blood pressure 
      of > 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of > 90 mmHg). Exclusion criteria
      included a history of coronary heart disease or stroke, serum creatinine > 1.5
      mg/dl, albuminuria > 40 micrograms/min, and use of lipid-lowering drugs, aspirin,
      or antihypertensive agents other than beta-blockers or diuretics. A total of 380 
      hypertensive diabetics were randomly assigned to open-label fosinopril (20
      mg/day) or amlodipine (10 mg/day) and followed for up to 3.5 years. If blood
      pressure was not controlled, the other study drug was added. RESULTS: Both
      treatments were effective in lowering blood pressure. At the end of follow-up,
      between the two groups there was no significant difference in total serum
      cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, HbA1c, fasting serum glucose, or plasma insulin.
      The patients receiving fosinopril had a significantly lower risk of the combined 
      outcome of acute myocardial infarction, stroke, or hospitalized angina than those
      receiving amlodipine (14/189 vs. 27/191; hazards ratio = 0.49, 95% CI =
      0.26-0.95). CONCLUSIONS: Fosinopril and amlodipine had similar effects on
      biochemical measures, but the patients randomized to fosinopril had a
      significantly lower risk of major vascular events, compared with the patients
      randomized to amlodipine.

TI  - Calcium channel blockers and the risk of cancer.
PG  - 1000-4
AB  - CONTEXT: Recent epidemiologic studies have raised the concern that calcium
      channel blocker use may increase the risk of cancer overall and of several
      specific cancers. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether calcium channel blocker use
      increases the risk of cancer overall and of specific cancers. DESIGN:
      Case-control drug surveillance study based on data collected from 1983 to 1996.
      SETTING: Hospitals in Baltimore, Md, New York, NY, and Philadelphia, Pa.
      PATIENTS: A total of 9513 patients aged 40 to 69 years with incident cancer of
      various sites and 6492 controls aged 40 to 69 years admitted for nonmalignant
      conditions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incident cancer overall and 23 specific
      cancers. RESULTS: Calcium channel blocker use was unrelated to the risk of cancer
      overall (relative risk [RR], 1.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9-1.3). Use was
      not significantly associated with increased risks of individual cancers,
      including those previously implicated, except cancer of the kidney (RR, 1.8; 95% 
      CI, 1.1 -2.7). Recent use, use for 5 or more years, and use of individual calcium
      channel blocker drugs were also not associated with cancer incidence. Use of
      beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors was generally
      unrelated to cancer overall or individual cancers, but both were associated with 
      kidney cancer (RR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.3-2.5; and RR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2-3.0,
      respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that the use of calcium
      channel blockers is unrelated to an increase in the overall risk of cancer or of 
      individual cancers, except kidney cancer, which has been associated with
      hypertension or drugs to treat hypertension in previous studies.

TI  - Calcium channel blocking agents and risk of cancer in patients with coronary
      heart disease. Benzafibrate Infarction Prevention (BIP) Study Research Group.
PG  - 804-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This analysis sought to estimate the risk ratio for cancer incidence 
      and cancer-related mortality associated with the use of calcium channel blocking 
      agents (CCBs) in a large group of patients with chronic coronary heart disease
      (CHD). BACKGROUND: Recent publications contend that the use of short-acting CCBs 
      may double the risk of cancer incidence and possibly increase mortality in
      hypertensive patients. METHODS: Cancer incidence data were obtained for 11,575
      patients screened for the Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention (BIP) study, one-half
      of whom were treated at the time of screening with CCBs, over a mean follow-up
      period of 2.8 years. Cause-specific mortality was available through September
      1996 (mean follow-up 5.2 years). The statistical power of detecting an odds ratio
      > or = 1.5 (given the cancer incidence rate of 2.1 in the nonusers of CCBs) was
      0.91. The power declined to 0.77, 0.54 and 0.41, with declining odds ratios of
      1.4, 1.3 and 1.25, respectively. RESULTS: Of 246 incident cancer cases, 129
      occurred among the users (2.3%) and 117 among nonusers of CCBs (2.1%). After
      adjustment for age, gender and smoking, the odds ratio estimates for all cancers 
      combined was 1.07 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.83 to 1.37) for CCB users
      relative to nonusers. The adjusted risk ratio for all-cause mortality for age,
      gender and smoking and pertinent prognostic clinical characteristics was
      estimated at 0.94 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.04). The adjusted risk ratio for
      cancer-related mortality was 1.03 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.41). CONCLUSIONS: Patients
      with CHD treated with CCBs exhibited a similar risk of cancer incidence and total
      and cancer-related mortality compared with nonusers of CCBs. This analysis
      provides a certain assurance that CCB use in middle-aged and elderly patients
      with CHD is not associated with a meaningful difference in cancer incidence and
      related mortality.

TI  - The effect of nisoldipine as compared with enalapril on cardiovascular outcomes
      in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes and hypertension.
PG  - 645-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has recently been reported that the use of calcium-channel
      blockers for hypertension may be associated with an increased risk of
      cardiovascular complications. Because this issue remains controversial, we
      studied the incidence of such complications in patients with
      non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension who were randomly
      assigned to treatment with either the calcium-channel blocker nisoldipine or the 
      angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor enalapril as part of a larger study.
      METHODS: The Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes (ABCD) Trial is a
      prospective, randomized, blinded trial comparing the effects of moderate control 
      of blood pressure (target diastolic pressure, 80 to 89 mm Hg) with those of
      intensive control of blood pressure (diastolic pressure, 75 mm Hg) on the
      incidence and progression of complications of diabetes. The study also compared
      nisoldipine with enalapril as a first-line antihypertensive agent in terms of the
      prevention and progression of complications of diabetes. In the current study, we
      analyzed data on a secondary end point (the incidence of myocardial infarction)
      in the subgroup of patients in the ABCD Trial who had hypertension. RESULTS:
      Analysis of the 470 patients in the trial who had hypertension (base-line
      diastolic blood pressure, > or = 90 mm Hg) showed similar control of blood
      pressure, blood glucose and lipid concentrations, and smoking behavior in the
      nisoldipine group (237 patients) and the enalapril group (233 patients)
      throughout five years of follow-up. Using a multiple logistic-regression model
      with adjustment for cardiac risk factors, we found that nisoldipine was
      associated with a higher incidence of fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarctions
      (a total of 24) than enalapril (total, 4) (risk ratio, 9.5; 95 percent confidence
      interval, 2.7 to 33.8). CONCLUSIONS: In this population of patients with diabetes
      and hypertension, we found a significantly higher incidence of fatal and nonfatal
      myocardial infarction among those assigned to therapy with the calcium-channel
      blocker nisoldipine than among those assigned to receive enalapril. Since our
      findings are based on a secondary end point, they will require confirmation.

TI  - Risk of serious adverse events in hypertensive patients receiving isradipine: a
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 743-51
AB  - A meta-analysis was performed to compare the risk of serious adverse events
      associated with the use of all formulations of isradipine, when used as
      monotherapy in hypertension, to active drug or placebo controls. Eligible studies
      totalled 65 published and unpublished randomised controlled trials involving 9903
      subjects and 10,675 treatment exposures: 4492 to isradipine, 1473 to isradipine
      sustained release, 2768 to other active drugs, and 1942 to placebo. Mortality,
      cardiovascular outcomes, other serious incident illnesses, such as cancer, and
      withdrawals were sought. Seventy-five per cent of the isradipine exposures were
      to standard-release formulations and 25% were to sustained-release formulations. 
      Overall, isradipine therapy shows no difference in risk of major adverse events
      or withdrawals compared to other active controls or placebo (odds ratios [OR]
      0.9; 95% CI 0.7-1.46 and 0.5; 95% CI 0.2-1.3). These major adverse events
      included angina, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke and overall
      mortality. Isradipine sustained release could be compared only to placebo, based 
      on available data, and shows a lower risk of withdrawals (OR 0.5; 95% CI
      0.3-0.9), and a similar trend was observed for major adverse events, (OR 0.8; 95%
      CI 0.3-2.5). Published and unpublished randomised controlled trials were analysed
      in separate meta-analyses and later combined when this sensitivity analysis of
      risk showed no differences between the groups. In conclusion, we find no evidence
      for increased risk of serious adverse events in patients receiving isradipine as 
      monotherapy for hypertension.

TI  - Effect of the calcium antagonist felodipine as supplementary vasodilator therapy 
      in patients with chronic heart failure treated with enalapril: V-HeFT III.
      Vasodilator-Heart Failure Trial (V-HeFT) Study Group.
PG  - 856-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite therapy with diuretics, ACE inhibitors and digoxin morbidity 
      and mortality in heart failure remain high and might respond favorably to an
      additional vasodilator. METHODS AND RESULTS: Male patients (n=450) with chronic
      heart failure (cardiac dysfunction and impaired exercise performance) on optimal 
      current therapy (97% enalapril, 89% diuretics) were randomly assigned to
      double-blind treatment with felodipine extended release (5 mg BID) or placebo for
      3 to 39 months (average, 18 months). Felodipine significantly reduced blood
      pressure and, at 3 months, increased ejection fraction (2.1% versus -0.1% units
      in the placebo group, P=.001) and reduced plasma atrial natriuretic peptide
      levels (-2.9 versus 26.9 pg/mL in the placebo group, P=.01) but did not improve
      exercise tolerance, quality of life, or the need for hospitalization. During
      long-term follow-up, the favorable effects on ejection fraction and atrial
      peptide did not persist, but felodipine prevented worsening exercise tolerance
      and quality of life. In the felodipine and placebo groups, mortality (13.8%
      versus 12.8%, respectively) and hospitalization (43% versus 42%) rates were
      similar, and a higher incidence of peripheral edema was the only apparent side
      effect of felodipine therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Felodipine exerts a well-tolerated
      additional sustained vasodilator effect in patients with heart failure treated
      with enalapril, but the only possible long-term benefit was a trend for better
      exercise tolerance and less depression of quality of life in the second year of
      treatment. The drug appears to be safe but not clearly efficacious in patients
      with heart failure.

TI  - Safety of nifedipine in patients with hypertension: a meta-analysis.
PG  - 7-14
AB  - Our objective was to compare cardiovascular event rates in patients with mild or 
      moderate hypertension who received nifedipine with active drug controls. We
      performed a MEDLARS search using the MeSH heading "hypertension" and the text
      word "nifedipine" to identify all articles that were published between 1966 and
      August 1995 in English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish languages and that
      involved human subjects. The computerized search was supplemented by a manual
      search of article bibliographies. Review of 1880 citations revealed 98 randomized
      controlled clinical trials that met protocol criteria. Articles were extracted
      independently by two doctors who were blinded for author, institution, and
      treatment regimen, using a structured, pretested extraction form. Differences of 
      opinion were resolved by consensus. Fourteen events occurred in 5198 exposures
      (0.27%) to nifedipine and 24 events in 5402 exposures (0.44%) to other active
      drug controls. Unadjusted odds ratios for nifedipine versus controls were 0.49
      (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22-1.09) for definitive events (death, nonfatal 
      myocardial infarction or stroke, revascularization procedure) and 0.61 (95% CI,
      0.31-1.17) for all events (definitive plus increased angina). The odds ratio for 
      nifedipine monotherapy (sustained- or extended-release in 91% of exposures) was
      nonsignificantly higher for definitive and all events (odds ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 
      0.49-4.03 and odds ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.59-3.32, respectively). The odds ratio 
      for nifedipine in combination with another drug was significantly lower for
      definitive and all events (odds ratio, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.01-0.66 and odds ratio,
      0.15; 95% CI, 0.03-0.65, respectively). Differences in odds ratio for nifedipine 
      monotherapy and combined therapy were statistically significant (P=.02 for
      definitive events and P=.001 for all events). Results support the safety of
      sustained- and extended-release nifedipine in the treatment of mild or moderate
      hypertension when it is used in combination with other drugs.

TI  - Cancer risk in users of calcium channel blockers.
PG  - 1091-4
AB  - Ca2+ channel blockers may cause cancer by inhibiting apoptosis or reducing
      intracellular Ca2+ in certain tissues. Recent findings suggest that drug users
      are at increased risk for cancer in general and for colon cancer in particular.
      We conducted a study in one Danish county of 17911 patients who received at least
      one prescription of Ca2+ channel blockers between 1 January 1991 and 31 December 
      1993. The patients were identified from records in the National Health Insurance 
      Program, which refunds part of the price of such drugs. Cancer occurrence and
      rate were determined by use of the files of the Danish Cancer Registry and
      compared with county-specific incidence rates for various categories of cancer.
      During the follow-up period of up to 3 years, 412 cancers were observed among
      users of Ca2+ channel blockers, compared with 414 expected, to yield an age- and 
      sex-standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of 1.00 (95% confidence interval, 0.90 to 
      1.10). There was no indication of an excess risk in the subgroup of likely
      long-term users or users of specific drugs. The SIR of colon cancer, a site of a 
      priori interest, was 0.8 (95% confidence interval, 0.5 to 1.1) on the basis of 34
      cases. Although the results are reassuring, the lack of association could reflect
      the relatively short follow-up after registration in the prescription database.
      Continued monitoring of cancer risk is planned.

TI  - Relationships of quality-of-life measures to long-term lifestyle and drug
      treatment in the Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study.
PG  - 638-48
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare 5 antihypertensive drugs and placebo for changes in
      quality of life (QL). To assess the relationship of lifestyle factors and change 
      in lifestyle factors to QL in participants with stage I diastolic hypertension.
      METHODS: The Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study (TOMHS) was a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with minimum participant
      follow-up of 4 years. It was conducted at 4 hypertension screening and treatment 
      academic centers in the United States. The cohort consisted of 902 men and women 
      with hypertension, aged 45 to 69 years, with diastolic blood pressures less than 
      100 mm Hg. Informed consent was obtained from each participant after the nature
      of the procedures had been fully explained. Sustained nutritional-hygienic
      intervention was administered to all participants to reduce weight, to reduce
      dietary sodium and alcohol intake, and to increase physical activity.
      Participants were randomized to take (1) acebutolol (n = 132); (2) amlodipine
      maleate (n = 131); (3) chlorthalidone (n = 126); (4) doxazosin mesylate (n =
      134); (5) enalapril maleate (n = 135); or placebo (n = 234). Changes in 7 QL
      indexes were assessed based on a 35-item questionnaire: (1) general health; (2)
      energy or fatigue; (3) mental health; (4) general functioning; (5) satisfaction
      with physical abilities; (6) social functioning; and (7) social contacts.
      RESULTS: At baseline, higher QL was associated with older age, more physical
      activity, lower obesity level, male gender, non-African American race, and higher
      educational level. Improvements in QL were observed in all randomized groups,
      including the placebo group during follow-up; greater improvements were observed 
      in the acebutolol and chlorthalidone groups and were evident throughout
      follow-up. The amount of weight loss, increase in physical activity, and level of
      attained blood pressure control during follow-up were related to greater
      improvements in QL. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with stage I hypertension,
      antihypertensive treatment with any of 5 agents used in TOMHS does not impair QL.
      The diuretic chlorthali-done and the cardioselective beta-blocker acebutolol
      appear to improve QL the most. Success with lifestyle changes affecting weight
      loss and increase in physical activity relate to greater improvements in QL and
      show that these interventions, in addition to contributing to blood pressure
      control, have positive effects on the general well-being of the individual.

TI  - Cardiac event rates after acute myocardial infarction in patients treated with
      verapamil and trandolapril versus trandolapril alone. Danish Verapamil Infarction
      Trial (DAVIT) Study Group.
PG  - 738-41
AB  - Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors improve survival in patients with 
      congestive heart failure (CHF) after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), but
      mortality may be as high as 10% to 15% after 1 year. Verapamil prevents cardiac
      events after an AMI in patients without CHF. We hypothesized that in postinfarct 
      patients with CHF already prescribed diuretics and an ACE inhibitor, additional
      treatment with verapamil may reduce cardiac event rate. In this multicenter,
      double-blind study, patients with CHF receiving diuretic treatment were
      consecutively randomized to treatment with trandolapril 1 mg/day for 1 month and 
      2 mg/day the following 2 months (n = 49), or to trandolapril as mentioned plus
      verapamil 240 mg/day for 1 month and 360 mg/day for 2 months (n = 51). Trial
      medication started 3 to 10 days after AMI. All patients were followed for 3
      months. End points in the trandolapril/trandolapril-verapamil groups were death
      1/1, reinfarction 7/1, unstable angina 9/3, and readmission for CHF 6/2. The
      3-month first cardiac event rate was 35% in trandolapril-treated patients and 14%
      in trandolapril-verapamil-treated patients (hazard ratio 0.35, 95% confidence
      interval 0.15 to 0.85, p = 0.015). These data suggest that verapamil reduces
      cardiac event rates in post-AMI patients with CHF when added to an ACE inhibitor 
      and a diuretic.

TI  - Carvedilol versus verapamil in chronic stable angina: a multicentre trial.
PG  - 95-100
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In a multicentre, double-blind, parallel group study, the anti-anginal
      and the anti-ischaemic efficacy of 12 weeks of therapy with the vasodilating
      beta-adrenoceptor-blocker carvedilol 25 mg b.i.d. was compared with verapamil 120
      mg t.i.d. METHODS: During a 2-week placebo run-in period, patients were required 
      to have two treadmill exercise tests (modified Bruce Protocol) differing by not
      more than 15% with regard to total exercise time (TET). Of 313 patients enrolled,
      248 were randomized and 212 completed the study according to the protocol.
      RESULTS: The primary variable TET was analysed using the Cox Proportional Hazards
      Model to take into account censored values due to the patient stopping the
      exercise test for reasons other than angina. Forty-three per cent of patients
      allocated to carvedilol and 36% to verapamil did not stop with angina at the
      final visit. There was no difference in the TET between the groups, the risk
      ratio being 1.14 in favour of carvedilol (90% CI 0.85-1.52). TET increased from
      378 s at baseline to 436 s at the final visit in the carvedilol group and from
      386 to 438 s in the verapamil group. Results for time to angina and time to 1 mm 
      ST-segment depression were similar. Compared to verapamil, carvedilol
      significantly reduced HR, systolic BP and rate pressure product at peak exercise.
      Analysis of 48 h Holter monitor data showed a greater reduction of HR and PVCs
      with carvedilol. Lown grading improved in both groups. Adverse events were
      reported by 48% (3.2% serious adverse events) of patients taking carvedilol and
      58% (5.7% serious adverse events) taking verapamil. CONCLUSION: Carvedilol is at 
      least as effective as verapamil in the management of chronic stable angina and
      demonstrated a favourable adverse event profile.

TI  - Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in NIDDM (ABCD) Trial.
PG  - 1646-54
AB  - The ABCD (Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes) Trial is a large,
      prospective, randomized clinical trial of 950 patients with non-insulin-dependent
      diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) designed to compare the effects of intensive blood
      pressure control with moderate control on the prevention and progression of
      diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy, cardiovascular disease, and neuropathy in
      NIDDM. The secondary objective is to determine equivalency of the effects of a
      calcium channel blocker (nisoldipine) and an angiotensin-converting-enzyme
      inhibitor (enalapril) as a first-line antihypertensive agent in the prevention
      and/or progression of these diabetic vascular complications. The study consists
      of two study populations aged 40-74 years, 470 hypertensive patients (diastolic
      blood pressure of > or = 90.0 mmHg at time of randomization) and 480 normotensive
      patients (diastolic blood pressure of 80.0 mmHg at time of randomization). The
      study duration is 5 years and is scheduled to end in May of 1998. Patients are
      randomized to receive either intensive antihypertensive drug therapy or moderate 
      antihypertensive drug therapy. Patients are also randomized to nisoldipine or
      enalapril, with open-label medications added if further blood pressure control is
      necessary. The primary outcome measure is glomerular filtration rate as assessed 
      by 24-h creatinine clearance. Secondary outcome measures are urinary albumin
      excretion, left ventricular hypertrophy, retinopathy, and neuropathy.
      Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality will also be evaluated. Given the data
      showing the impact of hypertension on complications in NIDDM, the ABCD Trial is
      designed to determine if intensive antihypertensive therapy will be more
      efficacious than moderate antihypertensive therapy on the outcome of diabetic
      complications in NIDDM.

TI  - Effect of amlodipine on morbidity and mortality in severe chronic heart failure. 
      Prospective Randomized Amlodipine Survival Evaluation Study Group.
PG  - 1107-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that calcium-channel blockers increase
      morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic heart failure. We studied the
      effect of a new calcium-channel blocker, amlodipine, in patients with severe
      chronic heart failure. METHODS: We randomly assigned 1153 patients with severe
      chronic heart failure and ejection fractions of less than 30 percent to
      double-blind treatment with either placebo (582 patients) or amlodipine (571
      patients) for 6 to 33 months, while their usual therapy was continued. The
      randomization was stratified on the basis of whether patients had ischemic or
      nonischemic causes of heart failure. The primary end point of the study was death
      from any cause and hospitalization for major cardiovascular events. RESULTS:
      Primary end points were reached in 42 percent of the placebo group and 39 percent
      of the amlodipine group, representing a 9 percent reduction in the combined risk 
      of fatal and nonfatal events with amlodipine (95 percent confidence interval, 24 
      percent reduction to 10 percent increase; P=0.31). A total of 38 percent of the
      patients in the placebo group died, as compared with 33 percent of those in the
      amlodipine group, representing a 16 percent reduction in the risk of death with
      amlodipine (95 percent confidence interval, 31 percent reduction to 2 percent
      increase; P=0.07). Among patients with ischemic heart disease, there was no
      difference between the amlodipine and placebo groups in the occurrence of either 
      end point. In contrast, among patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy,
      amlodipine reduced the combined risk of fatal and nonfatal events by 31 percent
      (P=0.04) and decreased the risk of death by 46 percent (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS:
      Amlodipine did not increase cardiovascular morbidity or mortality in patients
      with severe heart failure. The possibility that amlodipine prolongs survival in
      patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy requires further study.

TI  - Comparison of the therapeutic effects of the beta-blocking agent bisoprolol and
      the calcium-blocking agent diltiazem in patients with heart failure due to
      dilated cardiomyopathy.
PG  - 767-73
AB  - Beta-blocking agents reduce mortality and improve symptoms in patients with
      dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). There have been reports that diltiazem, a
      calcium-blocking agent, is also effective in such patients. We prospectively
      compared the effects of the beta-blocking agent bisoprolol with those of the
      calcium-blocking agent diltiazem in 18 patients (11 males and 7 females, age 14
      to 68) with DCM. The 18 patients, (10 in New York Heart Association functional
      class III and 8 in class IV) were randomly assigned to 2 groups. Bisoprolol was
      administered as the first drug in 10 patients and diltiazem was administered in
      8. Cross-over to bisoprolol was also performed in 3 patients. At the end of the
      study, among the 13 patients who had been given bisoprolol, 9 showed a good
      response (efficacy rate: 69%). In contrast, only 3 of the 8 patients who received
      diltiazem showed a good response (efficacy rate: 37.5%). Among the patients in
      NYHA class III, all 7 (100%) who were treated with bisoprolol responded but only 
      2 of the 4 (50%) treated with diltiazem responded (p < 0.05). Among the patients 
      in class IV, 2 of 6 (33%) responded to bisoprolol and 1 of 4 (25%) responded to
      diltiazem (not significant). These results suggest that diltiazem, like
      bisoprolol, has a beneficial effect in patients with DCM, with a greater effect
      in class III patients. However, we conclude that diltiazem should usually be used
      as a second choice to improve heart failure in DCM, and as the first medication
      only in those with contraindications to beta-blocking agents.

TI  - Low dosages of felodipine ER once daily as monotherapy in elderly hypertensive
      patients: effect on ambulatory blood pressure and quality of life.
PG  - 613-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish the efficacy of 24-h ambulatory and casual blood pressure
      (BP) reduction, and the tolerability of once daily felodipine extended release
      (ER) 2.5 mg and felodipine ER 5 mg as monotherapy. DESIGN: Randomised,
      double-blind placebo controlled 6 weeks parallel study. SETTING: From 15 general 
      practices centres (with 19 GPs) in the region of the University of Maastricht,
      The Netherlands. SUBJECTS: A total of 129 subjects aged 50-80 years with primary 
      hypertension were screened; 27 men and 61 women with a casual diastolic BP of
      100-115 mm Hg and/or a systolic BP of less than 200 mm Hg entered the study. MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Casual and 24-h ambulatory BP and a subjective symptom
      assessment (SSA) questionnaire after 6 weeks of therapy. RESULTS: After
      correlation for placebo response the mean casual systolic/diastolic BP (SBP/DBP) 
      reduction was 10/5 mm Hg (NS) and 12/10 mm Hg (P < 0.05) for felodipine ER 2.5
      and 5 mg, respectively. By using 24-h ambulatory BP measurements these reduction 
      were 6/4 mm Hg (NS) and 13/8 mm Hg (P < 0.05), respectively. No significant
      difference for SBP and DBP was found during the night time between felodipine 2.5
      and placebo (-1/0). Felodipine ER 5 mg lowered the BP load significantly during
      both daytime and night time but felodipine ER 2.5 mg only for DBP during the
      daytime. There was a significant difference for the number of responders between 
      placebo (28%) vs felodipine ER 2.5 mg (55%) and ER 5.0 mg (59%). Both felodipine 
      dosages and placebo were comparable in (a low) number of adverse events and
      results of the SSA. CONCLUSIONS: During daytime felodipine ER 2.5 mg and 5 mg are
      effective in BP lowering in elderly hypertensive patients. However, only
      felodipine ER mg is effective in reducing BP during night time (22.00-7.00). Only
      felodipine ER 5 mg has a significant reducing effect on BP load during day and
      night time. Both felodipine ER 2.5 and ER 5.0 have a significant effect on the
      responder rate. It appeared from this study that compared to placebo, and in
      contrast with felodipine ER 5 mg, the ER form of felodipine 2.5 mg has no BP
      lowering effect during night time in elderly patients. To assess the effectivity 
      during night time of felodipine ER 2.5 mg in an individual patient it is
      recommendable to measure the BP at the end of the dose interval.

TI  - Antihypertensive therapy and quality of life. Influence of blood pressure
      reduction, adverse events, and prior antihypertensive therapy.
PG  - 854-9
AB  - Quality of life is an important attribute of antihypertensive therapy. Previous
      studies have not addressed the importance of a patient's prior pharmacotherapy on
      quality of life, which may serve as the basis of reference for a new therapy. Nor
      have previous studies compared commonly used quality of life instruments for
      consistency, or investigated whether improvement or worsening of quality of life 
      correlates with adverse events or blood pressure reduction. Two hundred eighteen 
      hypertensive patients with diastolic blood pressure (95 to 114 mm Hg) after a 4- 
      to 5-week placebo washout period were enrolled in a randomized double-blind,
      parallel group dose-escalation trial to compare the effects of amlodipine (2.5 to
      10 mg), bisoprolol (2.5 to 10 mg)/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 6.25, and enalapril 
      (5 to 20 mg) on blood pressure, adverse events, and quality of life. Three
      quality of life instruments (General Well-Being Index, Vital Signs Quality of
      Life, Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale) were administered during original
      therapy, after placebo washout, and after 12 weeks of optimally titrated clinical
      trial pharmacotherapy. Our results demonstrated that removal from prior therapy
      had no detectable influence on subsequent evaluation of quality of life. The
      three quality of life instruments were consistent with the changes observed with 
      the three therapies: a trend toward better quality of life with amlodipine and
      bisoprolol/HCTZ. Adverse events, but not systolic or diastolic blood pressure
      reduction correlated directly with changes in quality of life.

TI  - Calcium-channel blockade and incidence of cancer in aged populations.
PG  - 493-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Calcium-channel blockers can alter apoptosis, a mechanism for
      destruction of cancer cells. We examined whether the long-term use of
      calcium-channel blockers is associated with an increased risk of cancer. METHODS:
      Between 1988 and 1992 we carried out a prospective cohort study of 5052 people
      aged 71 years or more and who lived in three regions of Massachusetts, Iowa, and 
      Connecticut USA. Those taking calcium-channel blockers (n = 451) were compared
      with all other participants (n = 4601). The incidence of cancer was assessed by
      survey of hospital discharge diagnoses and causes of death. These outcomes were
      validated by the cancer registry in the one region where it was available.
      Demographic variables, disability, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, blood 
      pressure, body-mass index, use of other drugs, hospital admissions for other
      causes, and comorbidity were all assessed as possible confounding factors.
      FINDINGS: The hazard ratio for cancer associated with calcium-channel blockers
      (1549 person-years, 47 events) compared with those not taking calcium-channel
      blockers (17225 person-years, 373 events) was 1.72 (95% CI 1.27-2.34, p =
      0.0005), after adjustment for confounding factors. A significant dose-response
      gradient was found. Hazard ratios associated with verapamil, diltiazem, and
      nifedipine did not differ significantly from each other. The results remained
      unchanged in community-specific analyses. The association between calcium-channel
      blockers and cancer was found with most of the common cancers. INTERPRETATION:
      Calcium-channel blockers were associated with a general increased risk of cancer 
      in the study populations, which suggested a common mechanism. These observational
      findings should be confirmed by other studies.

TI  - Diltiazem improves cardiac function and exercise capacity in patients with
      idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Results of the Diltiazem in Dilated
      Cardiomyopathy Trial.
PG  - 346-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence is arising that calcium antagonists in idiopathic dilated
      cardiomyopathy (IDC) may have beneficial effects on virus-induced
      cardiopathology, alcohol toxicity, micro-circulatory disorders, and impaired
      calcium cycling, all possibly involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. Thus, 
      the effect of adjunct diltiazem (60 to 90 mg TID) on standard treatment was
      investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Diltiazem in Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DiDi)
      trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial of
      186 patients (92 receiving diltiazem, 94 receiving placebo) with IDC diagnosed by
      coronary angiography, catheterization of the left side of the heart, and a left
      ventricular ejection fraction of < 0.50 (mean, 0.34 +/- 0.11). The effect of
      adjunct diltiazem treatment on transplant listing-free survival, hemodynamics,
      exercise capacity, and subjective status was investigated. During the 24-month
      study period, 33 patients dropped out of the study; 153 patients finished the
      study protocol. Twenty-seven patients died or had a listing for heart
      transplantation: 16 in the placebo group and 11 in the diltiazem group. The
      transplant listing-free survival rate was 85% for diltiazem and 80% for placebo
      recipients (P = .444). After 24 months, only diltiazem significantly increased
      cardiac index at rest (P = .01) and under a workload (P = .02), systolic and
      diastolic pressures (P = .003 and P = .004), stroke volume index (P = .003), and 
      stroke work index (P = .000) and decreased both pulmonary artery pressure under
      workload (P = .007) and heart rate (P = .001). Diltiazem also increased exercise 
      capacity (P = .002) and subjective well-being (P = .01). Adverse reactions were
      minor and evenly distributed in both groups, except for an increase in the PQ
      interval in the diltiazem group. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with IDC, the adjunct
      therapy of diltiazem improves cardiac function, exercise capacity, and subjective
      status without deleterious effects on transplant listing-free survival.

TI  - Age and severe adverse drug reactions caused by nifedipine and verapamil. Gruppo 
      Italiano di Farmacovigilanza nell' Anziano (GIFA).
PG  - 921-8
AB  - The association of age with risk for severe adverse drug reactions (SADRs) was
      studied in 2371 and 862 hospitalized patients taking nifedipine and verapamil,
      respectively. Nifedipine caused hypotension (n = 22), tachycardia (n = 3), and
      acute renal failure (n = 1) (total SADR rate, 1.1%, 26/2371). Verapamil caused
      hypotension (n = 3), bradycardia (n = 9), and atrioventricular blocks (n = 2)
      (total SADR rate, 1.6%, 14/862). The mean age of patients with and without SADRs 
      was for nifedipine 77.1 +/- 1.7 and 71.8 +/- 0.8 years, respectively (p < 0.05), 
      and for verapamil 73.4 +/- 2.9 and 73.1 +/- 0.4 years, respectively. Sex, length 
      of stay, comorbidity, polypharmacy, intake of slow-release preparations, daily
      dosage, and new intake of calcium antagonists were examined as potential
      confounders of the age-SADR association. After adjusting for potential
      confounders, age was significantly and independently associated with SADRs caused
      by nifedipine, but not with SADRs caused by verapamil (OR = 1.69, 95% CI =
      1.05-2.72 and OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 0.63-1.68 for 10-year increase, respectively). 
      Although nifedipine and verapamil did not have significantly different rates of
      SADRs, an age-related gradient was found only for nifedipine.

TI  - Comparison of enalapril versus nifedipine to decrease left ventricular
      hypertrophy in systemic hypertension (the PRESERVE trial).
PG  - 61-5
AB  - The PRESERVE (Prospective Randomized Enalapril Study Evaluating Regression of
      Ventricular Enlargement) study is designed to provide a definitive test of the
      ability of enalapril to achieve greater left ventricular (LV) mass reduction than
      nifedipine GITs (gastrointestinal treatment system) by a degree that would be
      prognostically meaningful on a population basis (10 g/m2). To achieve this goal, 
      an ethnically diverse population of 480 men and women with essential hypertension
      and increased LV mass of screening echocardiography will be enrolled at clinical 
      centers on 4 continents and studied by echocardiography at baseline and after 6
      and 12 months' randomized therapy. Blinded readings of echocardiograms at a
      central laboratory will provide systematic information about treatment effects on
      LV structure, wall motion, and Doppler blood flow. The study power is at least
      90% to test the primary hypotheses that enalapril will induce greater
      normalization of LV mass and diastolic filling than nifedipine. After the 1-year 
      echocardiographic trial, the study population will be followed 3 more years to
      test the hypothesis that a reduction in LV mass, independent of blood pressure
      lowering, is associated with a reduction in the risk of morbid and fatal
      cardiovascular events.

TI  - Rationale and design of the third vasodilator-heart failure trial (V-HeFT III):
      felodipine as adjunctive therapy to enalapril and loop diuretics with or without 
      digoxin in chronic congestive heart failure. V-HeFT III investigators.
PG  - 1078-82
AB  - Therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and nonselective
      vasodilators (hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate) has become accepted treatment
      in patients with symptomatic, chronic congestive heart failure (CHF), and has
      been demonstrated in large clinical trials to ameliorate symptoms, improve
      exercise performance, and reduce cardiac mortality. Nevertheless, the management 
      of patients with CHF remains a therapeutic challenge. The second
      Vasodilator-Heart Failure Trial (V-HeFT II) showed that the average 2-year
      mortality with enalapril (18%) was significantly lower than that with
      hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate (25%) but, somewhat surprisingly, the
      nonspecific vasodilators produced significantly more improvement in exercise
      performance and left ventricular function. Such data suggest that improvement in 
      symptoms, hemodynamics, and survival may not be afforded by the use of a single
      class of vasodilator therapy, but might be optimized by the combined use of
      different agents. This report describes the rationale and design of V-HeFT III, a
      multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
      comparing the effects of chronic oral extended-release felodipine (felodipine ER)
      2.5 to 5 mg twice daily, when added to a stable regimen of enalapril and loop
      diuretics, with or without digoxin, on exercise performance, morbidity, and
      mortality in patients with New York Heart Association functional class II to III 
      CHF followed for a minimum of 12 weeks. Felodipine is a second-generation
      dihydropyridine calcium antagonist with a high degree of vascular selectivity
      which, in the doses used in this study, exerts its systemic arterial effect by
      decreasing peripheral vascular resistance without producing negative inotropic
      effects. The results of V-HeFT III may shed important light on the role of
      additive vasodilator therapy in the management of patients with CHF.

TI  - Does high salt intake cause hyperfiltration in patients with essential
      hypertension?
PG  - 157-61
AB  - In animal models of salt-dependent hypertension, hyperfiltration is associated
      with a faster decline in renal function and there is evidence that in
      hypertensive man, increased creatinine clearance is a marker of early
      hypertensive nephropathy. We have studied the influence of salt intake on the
      glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (Creatinine Clearance) in 14 patients with mild 
      hypertension. Each patient was studied in random order and according to a
      crossover design, at habitual salt intake, at high salt intake (ie habitual
      +50/100 mmol/day) and at low salt intake (habitual -50/100 mmol/day). Protein,
      calcium and potassium intake was fixed across the three study periods. The
      control group was formed by seven healthy subjects. High salt intake, caused a
      significant (P < 0.01) increase in 24 h mean arterial pressure (MAP) and the
      expected suppression in plasma renin activity (PRA) and in plasma aldosterone.
      Seven patients were classified as salt-sensitive. The GFR was significantly
      higher (P < 0.01) at high salt intake (125 +/- 10 ml/min) than at habitual (113
      +/- 7 ml/min) and at low salt intake (97 +/- 6 ml/min). On aggregate urinary salt
      excretion was significantly related with the GFR (P < 0.01 by correlation
      analysis for repeated observations) and the slope of this relationship predicted 
      that a 100 mmol/day increase in salt intake is associated with the 14.6 ml/min
      rise in the GFR. The relationship between GFR and 24 h urinary salt in salt
      sensitive patients did not differ from that in salt resistant patients. The GFR
      response to salt loading was largely independent of the renin-aldosterone system.
      No change in arterial pressure nor in GFR was observed in healthy subjects. At
      fixed protein intake, changes in salt intake in the physiological range are
      associated with important GFR variations in mild hypertensives. As long as
      hyperfiltration in mild hypertension is a predictor of renal function
      deterioration, high salt intake, independent of the effect of arterial pressure, 
      could be a factor that contributes to nephronic obsolescence in patients with
      essential hypertension.

TI  - Quality of life in normotensives compared to hypertensive men treated with
      isradipine or methyldopa as monotherapy or in combination with captopril: the
      LOMIR-MCT-IL study.
PG  - 117-22
AB  - Quality of life (QOL) measures were assessed in a multi-center, double-blind,
      case-controlled trial of 1 year's duration. A total of 368 hypertensive male
      patients were randomly assigned to monotherapies of either isradipine, methyldopa
      or placebo. If normotension was not achieved, captopril was added. QOL
      assessments in the hypertensives and in 155 normotensives included a
      self-structured scale to measure the subjective perception of QOL, the severity, 
      desirability and controllability of recent critical life events, semantic memory,
      physical dysfunction, sleep disorders, sexual difficulties, depression and
      work-related stress. The overall withdrawal rate during the trial was 19%, mainly
      due to lack of efficacy and adverse experiences. At baseline, and at the end of
      the trial, the normotensives as compared to hypertensive patients, had
      significantly better scores in most QOL measures. Patients treated with the
      combination of isradipine and captopril reported more favorable changes in the
      subjective measure of QOL (P < 0.03) and in semantic memory (P < 0.001) than
      patients treated with any of the monotherapies or with methyldopa in combination 
      with captopril. There were no statistically significant differences among
      treatments for changes of other indices of QOL. In most QOL measurements,
      normotensives rated better then hypertensives. Patients treated on long-term
      therapy with the combination of isradipine and captopril showed improvement in
      self-structured QOL measures and semantic memory, compared to patients treated
      either with methyldopa or placebo.

TI  - Acute hemodynamic and long-term clinical effects of isradipine in patients with
      coronary artery disease and chronic heart failure. A double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 37-43
AB  - To assess the acute hemodynamic and long-term clinical effects of isradipine, a
      calcium antagonist of the dihydropyridine class, we performed a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled parallel study in 19 patients with coronary artery disease
      (CAD) and stable chronic heart failure (CHF). Their mean age was 56 +/- 5 years, 
      and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 0.18 +/- 0.05. Patients were
      treated with diuretics and digoxin only. All were clinically stable and in sinus 
      rhythm. The acute hemodynamic study showed that (intravenous) isradipine
      increased cardiac index (+36%) and stroke volume index (+30%) (both P < 0.001),
      while systemic vascular resistance (-33%) and mean arterial pressure (-10%)
      decreased (both P < 0.005). Filling pressures and heart rate were not affected.
      Of the 19 patients, 17 completed the 12 week study; 2 patients on placebo (1
      death, 1 side-effects) but no patient on isradipine (5 mg 3 times daily) dropped 
      out. After 12 weeks, peak oxygen consumption (VO2), LVEF, echocardiographic
      indices, and other clinical parameters were unaffected by treatment. Repeat
      invasive hemodynamic measurements showed that the initial improvement by
      isradipine was not present anymore. In conclusion, despite a beneficial acute
      hemodynamic effect, isradipine has no favorable clinical influence during
      prolonged treatment in patients with mild to moderate CHF.

TI  - Long-term prevention of atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass surgery:
      comparison of quinidine, verapamil, and amiodarone in maintaining sinus rhythm.
PG  - 61-4
AB  - AIM OF STUDY: To evaluate the necessity and efficacy of quinidine fumarate,
      verapimil, or amiodarone prophylaxis for sinus rhythm maintenance in patients who
      experienced atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass surgery. METHODS:
      Between 1992 and 1995, this prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study
      examined 120 patients in whom atrial fibrillation occurred and was restored to
      sinus rhythm by pharmacological therapy or direct current cardioversion in the
      immediately postoperative period after coronary artery by-pass surgery. There
      were no significant differences in perioperative characteristics among the
      patients, who were randomly separated into four groups in the course of
      discharge. In group 1 (n = 30), patients did not receive antiarrhythmic drugs.
      Quinidine fumarate was given in group 2 (n = 30), verapimil in group 3 (n = 30), 
      and amiodarone in group 4 (n = 30). Patients were monitored six times over a
      90-day postoperative period by 24-hour Holter monitoring and routine examination.
      RESULTS: The recurrent atrial fibrillation usually developed within 15 days of
      discharge. Atrial fibrillation occurred in one patient (3.33%) in group 1, and
      two each (6.66%) in groups 2, 3, and 4. Atrial fibrillation was asymptomatic and 
      occurred with slow ventricular response in groups 3 and 4. Side effects occurred 
      in 5 patients (16.6%) given quinidine, 1 patient given amiodarone, but in no
      patient given verapimil. CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant differences in
      the maintenance of sinus rhythm among the four groups, so we suggest that
      long-term prevention of atrial fibrillation in patients with coronary artery
      bypass grafting was not necessary at the postdischarge period.

TI  - Effects of metoprolol vs verapamil in patients with stable angina pectoris. The
      Angina Prognosis Study in Stockholm (APSIS)
PG  - 76-81
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study long-term treatment effects of metoprolol or verapamil on
      combined cardiovascular end points and psychological variables in patients with
      stable angina pectoris. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, double-dummy trial.
      PATIENTS: The study included 809 patients under 70 years of age with stable
      angina pectoris. The mean age of the patients was 59 +/- 7 years and 31% were
      women. Exclusion criteria were myocardial infarction within the previous 3 years 
      and contraindications to beta-blockers and calcium antagonists. The patients were
      followed between 6 and 75 months (median 3.4 years and a total of 2887 patient
      years). INTERVENTION: The patients were treated with either metoprolol (Seloken
      ZOC 200 mg o.d.) or verapamil (Isoptin Retard 240 b.i.d.). Acetylsalicylic acid, 
      ACE inhibitors, lipid lowering drugs and long acting nitrates were allowed in the
      study. END POINTS: Death, non-fatal cardiovascular events including acute
      myocardial infarction, incapacitating or unstable angina, cerebrovascular or
      peripheral vascular events. Psychological variables reflecting quality of life
      i.e. psychosomatic symptoms, sleep disturbances and an evaluation of overall life
      satisfaction. RESULTS: Combined cardiovascular events did not differ and occurred
      in 30.8% and 29.3% of metoprolol and verapamil treated patients respectively.
      Total mortality in metoprolol and verapamil treated patients was 5.4 and 6.2%,
      respectively. Cardiovascular mortality was 4.7% in both groups. Non-fatal
      cardiovascular events occurred in 26.1 and 24.3% of metoprolol and
      verapamil-treated patients, respectively. Psychosomatic symptoms and sleep
      disturbances were significantly improved in both treatment groups. The magnitudes
      of change were small and did not differ between treatments. Life satisfaction did
      not change on either drug. Withdrawals due to side effects occurred in 11.1 and
      14.6% respectively. CONCLUSION: This long term study indicates that both drugs
      are well tolerated and that no difference was shown on the effect on mortality,
      cardiovascular end points and measures of quality of life.

PG  - 104-12
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the relationship between presence or absence of ischaemic
      events on Holter monitoring and occurrence of a hard or hard+soft endpoint.
      DESIGN: A randomized double-blind parallel group study of atenolol, nifedipine
      and their combination, with ambulatory monitoring off-treatment and after 6 weeks
      of randomized treatment and prospective follow-up of 2 years on average. SETTING:
      Europe. SUBJECTS: 682 men and women with a diagnosis of chronic stable angina and
      who were not being considered for surgery. MAIN OUTCOME: Hard endpoints were
      cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and unstable angina; soft endpoints
      were coronary artery bypass surgery, coronary angioplasty and treatment failure. 
      RESULTS: The study showed no evidence of an association between the presence,
      frequency or total duration of ischaemic events on Holter monitoring, either on
      or off treatment, and the main outcome measures. There was a non-significant
      trend to a lower rate of hard endpoints in the group receiving combination
      therapy. Compliance, as measured by withdrawal from trial medication, was clearly
      poorest in the nifedipine group with similar withdrawal rates in the atenolol and
      combination therapy groups. CONCLUSION: The recording of ischaemic events in 48 h
      Holter monitoring failed to predict hard or hard+soft endpoints in patients with 
      chronic stable angina.

TI  - Comparison of effects on peak oxygen consumption, quality of life, and
      neurohormones of felodipine and enalapril in patients with congestive heart
      failure.
PG  - 1253-8
AB  - Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition is currently the cornerstone of
      congestive heart failure (CHF) therapy, but these drugs are not tolerated in up
      to 20% of patients. For these patients, therapeutic alternatives with comparable 
      efficacy are needed. Felodipine, a vasoselective dihydropyridine calcium
      antagonist with a slow onset of action and a long plasma half-life, may be such
      an agent. Therefore, the efficacy and safety of felodipine were examined and
      compared with enalapril using a double-blind design. We studied 46 patients with 
      a left ventricular ejection fraction < 0.40, peak oxygen consumption < 20
      ml.min-1.kg-1, and symptoms of CHF despite therapy with diuretics and digoxin.
      After 16 weeks of therapy, there were no statistically significant differences in
      peak oxygen consumption (felodipine +1.6, enalapril +2.5 ml.min-1.kg-1) and
      exercise tolerance (felodipine +61 seconds, enalapril +64 seconds).
      Quality-of-life parameters were affected slightly better by felodipine than by
      enalapril. Plasma norepinephrine decreased by 143 pg.ml-1 with enalapril and by
      12 pg.ml-1 with felodipine (p < 0.20 between groups). Both drugs were generally
      well tolerated. These data suggest that felodipine and enalapril have comparable 
      effects on exercise parameters in patients with CHF. Neurohumoral activation was 
      not observed with either drug.

TI  - Comparative study of efficacy and safety of low-dose diltiazem or betaxolol in
      combination with digoxin to control ventricular rate in chronic atrial
      fibrillation: randomized crossover study.
PG  - 167-74
AB  - BACKGROUND: The combination therapy of low-dose diltiazem or bexatolol with
      digoxin can be a useful adjunct for achieving heart rate control with minimal
      side effects. But there has not been a study including patients with impaired
      left ventricular function and evaluating whether the beneficial effects of
      medication will be maintained during a follow-up period. OBJECTIVES: The purpose 
      of this study was three-fold: (1) to compare the efficacy of digoxin with
      low-dose diltiazem and digoxin with low-dose betaxolol on randomized crossover
      study; (2) to evaluate whether the beneficial effects of medication will be
      maintained after 7 months; (3) to evaluate the safety of the combination therapy 
      in patients with impaired left ventricular function. METHODS: We did a
      prospective randomized crossover study in 35 patients with chronic atrial
      fibrillation (AF) including 15 patients with left ventricular dysfunction. After 
      enrollment, each patient was evaluated for heart rate, blood pressure,
      rate-pressure products, maximal exercise tolerance at rest and during
      symptom-limited treadmill test before medication, at 4 weeks after medication of 
      digoxin (0.125-0.5 mg daily) with diltiazem (90 mg twice daily), and at 4 weeks
      after digoxin with betaxolol (20 mg once daily). We performed 24-h ambulatory
      electrocardiogram (ECG) in 15 patients at the end of each phase of treatment. We 
      repeated symptom-limited treadmill test like above method in 15 patients at 7
      months of medication. RESULTS: (1) Ventricular rates were significantly reduced
      in digoxin with low-dose betaxolol therapy at rest and during exercise (67 +/- 3,
      135 +/- 5 (mean +/- S.E.M.) beats/min, respectively) in comparison to digoxin
      with low-dose diltiazem therapy (80 +/- 7, 154 +/- 5) (P < 0.05). (2)
      Rate-pressure products were significantly less in digoxin with low-dose betaxolol
      at rest and during exercise (85 +/- 4, 213 +/- 12 x 10(2) mmHg/min) than in
      digoxin with low-dose diltiazem therapy (105 +/- 6, 269 +/- 12) (P < 0.05). (3)
      Exercise capacity was significantly improved in digoxin with low-dose betaxolol
      (9.3 +/- 0.5 METS) or digoxin with low-dose diltiazem (9.7 +/- 0.5) in comparison
      to control state (8.3 +/- 0.5) (P < 0.05). (4) At 7 months evaluation, there was 
      no significant difference between at 4 weeks and at 7 months. (5) Results on 24-h
      ambulatory ECG showed the same findings as on treadmill test. (6) Although side
      effects occurred more frequently in digoxin with low-dose betaxolol therapy, they
      were minimal and no patient had to withdraw medication. Worsening of left
      ventricular dysfunction was not observed. CONCLUSION: Our study suggested that
      (1) combination therapy of low-dose betaxolol with digoxin was more superior to
      low-dose diltiazem with digoxin in controlling ventricular rate and reducing
      rate-pressure products; (2) the effects controlling ventricular rate, reducing
      rate-pressure products and improving exercise capacity have been well maintained 
      even after 7 months of medication with each combination therapy.

TI  - Felodipine in addition to beta-adrenergic blockade for angina pectoris. a
      multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 1535-41
AB  - The additional efficacy, duration of action and tolerability of felodipine were
      evaluated in patients with stable angina pectoris and a positive stress test who 
      were already receiving therapy with a beta-adrenergic blocker. One hundred and
      twenty-eight patients were randomized to double-blind treatment with 5-10 mg
      felodipine once daily or matching placebo, and were evaluated by serial exercise 
      testing during 12 weeks of treatment. Felodipine at 4 h significantly increased
      exercise duration assessed after 4 weeks of treatment (increase 34 +/- 65 s vs 18
      +/- 71 s in placebo-treated patients; 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.11; P =
      0.01), and after 12 weeks of treatment (increase 39 +/- 103 s vs 3 +/- 72 s; 95% 
      confidence interval 1.01-1.16; P = 0.02). The time until onset of
      exercise-induced anginal pain and time until 1 mm ST depression assessed after 4 
      weeks of treatment also increased significantly with felodipine compared to
      placebo. No statistically significant changes in exercise test parameters
      evaluated 24 h after medication were observed. The addition of felodipine once
      daily demonstrated a sustained improvement in exercise duration in patients
      symptomatic despite treatment with a beta-blocker evaluated 4 h after drug
      intake. At 24 h post dose, no statistically significant effect was observed.
      Felodipine is well tolerated with a low incidence of side-effects and no adverse 
      effect on quality of life.

      field trial in general practice. The OCAPI Study Group. Optimiser le Choix d'un
      Anti-hypertenseur de Premiere Intention.
PG  - 1059-67
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the equivalence of four antihypertensive treatments in
      patients with mild-to- moderate hypertension, and to compare the effects of those
      drugs on the subjective quality of life and clinical safety. DESIGN, SETTING AND 
      PATIENTS: 653 patients aged > or = 18 years with untreated hypertension were
      randomly allocated to receive a combination of two diuretics (altizide and
      spironolactone), a beta-blocker (bisoprolol), a calcium antagonist (verapamil),
      or an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (enalapril). Follow-up lasted
      for 1 year. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A composite outcome of the following measures 
      was used to define success: attendance at the 12-month visit; at least nine
      supine DBP measurements during the study; and median supine DBP < 90 mmHg and a
      reduction of at least 10 mmHg compared with the baseline value. Failure was
      defined as one or more of those criteria not being fulfilled. Equivalence was
      concluded if the 95% confidence interval for the success rates differed between
      two groups by less than +/- 10%. Clinical safety and subjective quality of life
      were also assessed. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences in the
      change in DBP or systolic blood pressure were observed between the groups. The
      success rates were 43.9, 42.0, 32.5 and 43.9% in diuretic, beta-blocker, calcium 
      antagonist and ACE inhibitor groups, respectively. Equivalence between the
      treatments could not be concluded, although analysis with a larger equivalence
      interval showed that some comparisons indicated equivalence. Significant
      improvement in satisfaction was observed for certain items for subjective quality
      of life at 1 month in the calcium antagonist treatment group, and significant
      differences in the responses to the clinical safety questionnaire were observed
      after 1-month follow-up in calcium antagonist and beta-blocker groups.
      Differences were no longer significant after 9 months. CONCLUSIONS: These results
      do not provide evidence on the basis of efficacy of blood pressure lowering or
      ability to increase short-term (1-year) safety and quality of life favouring any 
      particular treatment among the studied drugs for newly diagnosed patients with
      mild-to-moderate hypertension.

TI  - Low-dose drug combination therapy: an alternative first-line approach to
      hypertension treatment.
PG  - 359-66
AB  - To investigate the concept that the initial treatment of hypertension with low
      doses of two antihypertensives that have different modes of action and additive
      effects may achieve control of blood pressure and minimize the dose-dependent
      adverse effects seen with conventional monotherapy, a randomized, double-blind
      parallel group dose-escalation study was conducted. After a 4 to 5 week placebo
      washout period, 218 men and women with diastolic blood pressure between 95 and
      114 mm Hg were randomly allocated to take: amlodipine (2.5 to 10 mg), enalapril
      (5 to 20 mg), and the low-dose combination of bisoprolol (2.5 to 10 mg) with 6.25
      mg of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). All drugs were administered once daily,
      titrated to optimal response, and taken for a total of 12 weeks. Blood pressure
      was measured 24 hours after dose. The response rates (either a diastolic blood
      pressure < or = 90 mm Hg or a decrease of diastolic pressure > or = 10 mm Hg)
      were 71% for bisoprolol-6.25 mg HCTZ, 69% for amlodipine, and 45% for enalapril. 
      The mean decreases in systolic/diastolic blood pressure from baseline were
      13.4/10.7, 12.8/10.2, and 7.3/6.6 mm Hg for bisoprolol-6.25 mg HCTZ, amlodipine, 
      and enalapril, respectively. The mean change with enalapril was less than the
      other drugs (p < 0.01), although the once-daily dosing of enalapril and the
      maximum dose of 20 mg might not have been optimal for this agent.(ABSTRACT

TI  - Placebo controlled trial of felodipine in patients with mild to moderate heart
      failure. UK Study Group.
PG  - 428-33
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of felodipine and placebo in patients with New 
      York Heart Association functional class II or III and stable congestive heart
      failure despite treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor,
      diuretic, or digoxin, or any combination of these three drugs. PATIENTS AND
      DESIGN: 252 patients were randomised in a double blind, parallel group study
      after a 2-4 week placebo run-in to oral treatment with either felodipine extended
      release formulation or placebo 2.5-10 mg twice daily given in addition to
      existing background medication for a further 12 weeks. METHODS: Patients aged
      18-75 years of either sex with chronic congestive heart failure due to ischaemic 
      heart disease, hypertensive heart disease, or dilated cardiomyopathy with or
      without secondary mitral insufficiency that was stable during the preceding two
      months were included in the study. Treadmill exercise tests according to the
      modified Naughton protocol were performed at baseline, and after six, 11, and 12 
      weeks of treatment. Signs and symptoms of heart failure were assessed at every
      visit. Physical examination was performed and left ventricular ejection fraction 
      measured at baseline and after 12 weeks. RESULTS: Mean (SD) baseline exercise
      test times increased from 434 (162) s and 480 (157) s for felodipine and placebo 
      groups respectively to 541 (217) s and 591 (218) s at 12 weeks or the last visit.
      The change in exercise from baseline to last visit was 107 (141) s for patients
      given felodipine and 112 (128) s for those given placebo (P > 0.20). There was
      also no difference between treatments with respect to the other efficacy
      variables. There were few deaths in the study (felodipine n = 3, placebo n = 2). 
      More patients who received felodipine were withdrawn from treatment (n = 29) than
      those who received placebo (n = 17). The most common adverse events of the 54 and
      28 cited as reasons for withdrawal in the felodipine and placebo groups
      respectively were increased need for non-study heart failure treatment (n = 10;
      8%)--that is, starting new medication or changes in the dosage of existing
      treatment for patients given felodipine, and nausea (n = 4; 3%) for those given
      placebo. Patients withdrawn from the study due to increased need for non-study
      heart failure treatment rapidly stabilised and recovered. CONCLUSION: Felodipine 
      has not been shown to be of benefit in patients with mild to moderate heart
      failure.

      antagonists studied by prescription-event monitoring.
PG  - 1-7
AB  - The incidence of vasodilation-related events (flushing, headache, dizziness and
      oedema) was determined in a total of 37,670 patients treated with diltiazem,
      nicardipine, isradipine or amlodipine and studied by Prescription-Event
      Monitoring between 1984 and 1991. Event rates are expressed as the percentage of 
      patients who experienced these events during the six months after the first
      prescription. The rates for all these events with the newer vasoselective
      dihydropyridines (nicardipine, isradipine and amlodipine) were higher than those 
      with diltiazem. Among the three dihydropyridines, there were large individual
      differences in the rates. With nicardipine, the frequency of each of the four
      vasodilation-related events were similar to one another (approximately 3%). With 
      isradipine, the rates were also similar to one another but all were approximately
      twice those measured in the nicardipine study (approximately 6%). These
      differences may have been due to confounding factors such as the publicity about 
      adverse drug reactions, the indication for use by individual patients or the
      doses actually being used at the time the event occurred. With amlodipine, in
      contrast, the rate for oedema was two to four times larger than the rates for
      flushing, headache or dizziness.

      multicentre study.
PG  - 23-30
AB  - The efficacy, tolerability and impact on quality of life of amlodipine and
      enalapril were compared in a multicentre, double-blind, general practice study in
      461 mild and moderate hypertensives over a 50-week active treatment period.
      Amlodipine (5-10 mg, once daily) and enalapril (10-40 mg, once daily) were found 
      to be similarly effective in lowering blood pressure while not adversely
      affecting quality-of-life parameters. However, 20% of the enalapril group
      compared with 11% of the amlodipine group required the addition of
      hydrochlorothiazide for blood pressure control (P < 0.01). Diastolic blood
      pressure was normalised or reduced by 10 mmHg in 204 (90%) patients on amlodipine
      and in 190 (85%) patients on enalapril. Side-effects were, in general, mild or of
      little clinical significance. The major side-effects recorded were class-typical 
      of ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists, namely cough (enalapril) and oedema
      (amlodipine), respectively. Tolerability was very good, with only 17 patients (8 
      amlodipine, 4%; 9 enalapril, 4%) being withdrawn from the study due to
      side-effects definitely related to treatment. Amlodipine monotherapy produced a
      slightly beneficial effect on blood lipid concentration, and both drugs reduced
      the calculated 10-year risk of coronary heart disease. It was concluded that the 
      calcium antagonist amlodipine compared favourably with the ACE inhibitor
      enalapril in terms of antihypertensive efficacy, tolerability and impact on
      quality of life.

TI  - Effects of antihypertensive medications on quality of life in elderly
      hypertensive women.
PG  - 329-39
AB  - The impact of antihypertensive medications on the quality of life of elderly
      hypertensive women has rarely been systematically evaluated in large clinical
      trials using drugs from the new generations of pharmaceutic preparations. We
      carried out a multicenter, randomized double-blind clinical trial with 309
      hypertensive women aged 60 to 80 years to assess effects of atenolol, enalapril, 
      and isradipine on measures of quality of life over a 22-week period. The patients
      had mild to moderate hypertension. Hydrochlorothiazide was added to treatment if 
      monotherapy was inadequate in lowering blood pressure. At the conclusion of the
      trial the three drug groups did not differ in degree of reduction of diastolic
      blood pressure or in supplementation with hydrochlorothiazide. Over the 22-week
      trial, linear trend analysis showed no differences between the treatment groups
      in change from baseline on quality of life measures of well-being, physical
      status, emotional status, cognitive functioning, and social role participation.
      Regarding each of 33 physical side effects over the 22 weeks, we found no general
      difference between atenolol, enalapril, and isradipine groups on measures of
      change in distress over symptoms except for enalapril patients who worsened in
      distress over cough (P = .001) and atenolol patients who worsened in distress
      over dry mouth (P = .014). Centering on three medications that are relatively new
      additions to the armamentarium for blood pressure control, the findings underline
      the increasing opportunities for the physician to select drugs that can control
      blood pressure while maintaining the quality of life of elderly hypertensive
      women.

TI  - Post-marketing surveillance of lisinopril in general practice in the UK.
PG  - 296-304
AB  - A total of 4676 patients and 1759 patients were treated with lisinopril and
      nifedipine respectively in a post-marketing surveillance study conducted in
      general practice in the UK. Patients were followed up for 12 months. Most of the 
      lisinopril patients had hypertension, but a small number (180) had heart failure.
      Most of the nifedipine patients had uncomplicated hypertension, but some (22.57%)
      had other cardiovascular disease with or without hypertension. Lisinopril and
      nifedipine were equally effective in reducing blood pressure. During the study,
      1.5% of hypertensive patients assigned to lisinopril died compared with 1.8% of
      patients assigned to nifedipine, and 15.1% of lisinopril patients compared with
      19.7% of patients in the nifedipine group withdrew because of adverse events.
      Cough, malaise and fatigue, nausea and vomiting were more frequent causes of
      withdrawal from lisinopril than nifedipine. Conversely, headaches, pallor and
      flushing, oedema and palpitations caused more frequent withdrawals from
      nifedipine. Anaemia was more often encountered on nifedipine treatment than on
      lisinopril. In hypertensive patients, the frequency of first-dose hypotension was
      similar on both treatments. Serious events occurred in 0.8% and 0.5% of patients 
      given lisinopril and nifedipine respectively. Lisinopril was well tolerated by
      heart failure patients: 16 patients (8.88%) died and an incidence of 4.44% of
      serious adverse events was reported, a pattern to be anticipated in such
      patients; dizziness, giddiness, dyspnoea, cough, nausea and vomiting were the
      most frequent causes of withdrawal; the incidence of first-dose hypotension was
      low (2.22%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
