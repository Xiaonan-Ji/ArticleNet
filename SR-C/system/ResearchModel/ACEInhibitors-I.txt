TI  - Accelerated decline and prognostic impact of renal function after myocardial
      infarction and the benefits of ACE inhibition: the CATS randomized trial.
PG  - 412-20
AB  - AIMS: Information regarding the cardiorenal axis in patients after a myocardial
      infarction (MI) is limited. We examined the change in renal function after a
      first MI, the protective effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition
      and the prognostic value of baseline renal function. METHODS AND RESULTS: The
      study population consisted of 298 patients with a first anterior wall MI who were
      randomized to the ACE inhibitor captopril or placebo after completion of
      streptokinase infusion. Renal function, by means of glomerular filtration rate
      (GFR), was calculated using the Cockroft-Gault equation (GFR(c)). In the placebo 
      group, renal function (GFR(c)) declined by 5.5 min(-1)within 1 year, vs only 0.5 
      ml min(-1)in the ACE inhibitor group (P<0.05). This beneficial effect of
      captopril was most pronounced in patients with the most compromised renal
      function at baseline. The incidence of chronic heart failure (CHF) within 1 year 
      increased significantly with decreasing GFR(c)(divided into tertiles: 24.0, 28.9,
      and 41.2%; P<0.01). The risk-ratio for GFR(c)<81 ml min(-1)vs >103 mL min(-1)was 
      1.86 (95% CI 1.11-3.13; P=0.019). CONCLUSIONS: Renal function markedly
      deteriorates after a first MI, but is significantly preserved by ACE inhibition. 
      Furthermore, an impaired baseline renal function adds to the prognostic risk of
      developing CHF in patients after a first anterior MI.

TI  - Enalapril reduces the incidence of diabetes in patients with chronic heart
      failure: insight from the Studies Of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD).
PG  - 1291-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus is a predictor of morbidity and mortality in
      patients with heart failure. The effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
      inhibitors on the prevention of diabetes in patients with left ventricular
      dysfunction is unknown. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the
      effect of the ACE inhibitor enalapril on the incidence of diabetes in the group
      of patients from the Montreal Heart Institute enrolled in the Studies of Left
      Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD). METHODS AND RESULTS: Clinical charts were
      evaluated for fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels by blinded reviewers. A
      diagnosis of diabetes was made when a FPG > or =126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) was found at
      2 visits (follow-up, 2.9+/-1.0 years). Of the 391 patients enrolled at the
      Montreal Heart Institute, 291 were not diabetic (FPG <126 mg/dL without a history
      of diabetes), 153 of these were on enalapril and 138 were on placebo. Baseline
      characteristics were similar in the 2 groups. Forty patients developed diabetes
      during follow-up, 9 (5.9%) in the enalapril group and 31 (22.4%) in the placebo
      group (P<0.0001). By multivariate analysis, enalapril remained the most powerful 
      predictor for risk reduction of developing diabetes (hazard ratio, 0.22; 95%
      confidence intervals, 0.10 to 0.46; P<0.0001). The effect of enalapril was
      striking in the subgroup of patients with impaired FPG (110 mg/dL [6.1 mmol/L] < 
      or =FPG <126 mg/dL) at baseline: 1 patient (3.3%) in the enalapril group versus
      12 (48.0%) in the placebo group developed diabetes (P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS:
      Enalapril significantly reduces the incidence of diabetes in patients with left
      ventricular dysfunction, especially those with impaired FPG.

TI  - Risks and benefits of early treatment of acute myocardial infarction with an
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor in patients with a history of arterial
      hypertension: analysis of the GISSI-3 database.
PG  - 1018-25
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many trials have proved the benefits of early systematic treatment
      with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with acute myocardial
      infarction (AMI). Pathophysiological studies, however, suggest potential harm in 
      excessive reduction of blood pressure (BP) in hypertensive patients with ischemic
      heart disease. METHODS: We analyzed data from the GISSI-3 (Gruppo Italiano per lo
      Studio della Sopravvivenza nell'Infarto miocardico) trial to assess the effects
      of early treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors during AMI in
      patients with a history of hypertension compared with normotensive patients. The 
      trial randomly assigned 19,394 patients to 6 weeks of lisinopril treatment or
      control, starting treatment within 24 hours of AMI onset. RESULTS: In the 10,661 
      normotensive patients, lisinopril significantly reduced lethal events, but in the
      7362 hypertensive patients, a higher rate of lethal events was reported the first
      day of treatment, and the benefits only appeared subsequently. These results may 
      be attributable to the subgroup of 1165 hypertensive patients with low baseline
      systolic BP (lower quintile, BP <120 mm Hg), in whom critical hypotension was
      more prone to develop after lisinopril treatment. In fact, these patients showed 
      a higher mortality rate as the result of an excess of cardiogenic shock during
      the first day of lisinopril treatment (odds ratio 3.07, 95% CI 1.39-6.77) and a
      persistent, unfavorable death trend after 6 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: These data
      suggest that caution should be exercised when using lisinopril in the acute phase
      of a myocardial infarction in patients with a history of hypertension but low
      systolic BP at presentation.

TI  - Comparison of perindopril versus captopril for treatment of acute myocardial
      infarction.
PG  - 150-4
AB  - Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce mortality in patients with 
      acute myocardial infarction (AMI), but these benefits might be limited by acute
      hemodynamic changes and difficulties in titrating to recommended doses. The
      objective of this study was to compare the hemodynamic changes and tolerability
      of perindopril with captopril after AMI. We randomized 212 patients to receive
      either captopril (n = 102) or perindopril (n = 110) within 72 hours of AMI.
      Captopril was given as an initial dose of 6.25 mg, and then 50 mg/day on day 1
      and 100 mg/day thereafter. The corresponding doses of perindopril were 2, 4, and 
      8 mg/day. Acute hemodynamic changes, the percentage of patients who reached
      target doses, and in-hospital and 6-month cardiovascular events were monitored.
      Baseline clinical characteristics of the 2 groups were identical, but patients
      randomized to perindopril were in a higher Killip class (1.4 +/- 0.6 vs 1.2 +/-
      0.5, p = 0.05). During the first 6 hours, treatment with perindopril resulted in 
      higher minimal systolic (97 +/- 15 vs 91 +/- 14 mm Hg, p <0.01) and diastolic
      blood pressure (BP) (57 +/- 11 vs 54 +/- 10 mm Hg, p <0.02), later occurrence of 
      minimal BP (3.6 +/- 0.2 vs 2.7 +/- 0.1 hour, p <0.001), and a lower incidence of 
      persistent hypotension with systolic BP < 90 mm Hg for > or =1 hour (5% vs 16%; p
      < 0.01) compared with captopril. At initial administration, target doses of
      perindopril and captopril were attained in 97% and 82% of the patients,
      respectively (p < 0.01). After 6 months, there were no differences between
      patients treated with perindopril and captopril in mortality rates (6% vs 13%, p 
      = 0.16) and need for revascularization (20% vs 21%, p = 0.9). Thus, in patients
      during AMI, perindopril treatment showed better short-term tolerance than
      treatment with captopril, with significantly less acute hemodynamic changes and
      fewer withdrawals.

TI  - Long-term mortality in patients with myocardial infarction: impact of early
      treatment with captopril for 4 weeks.
PG  - 115-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In an earlier interim report of the Chinese Cardiac Study (CCS-1)
      trial, 15,000 patients up to 36 hours after the onset of suspected acute
      myocardial infarction (AMI) were randomized to receive either oral captopril or
      matching placebo for one month. Results showed that captopril was associated with
      a non-significant reduction in 4-week mortality (681 [9.1%] captopril-allocated
      vs 730 [9.7%] placebo-allocated deaths; 2P = 0.19), but the long-term effects
      remained uncertain. The present study reports on the long-term effect of early
      captopril treatment on mortality and other major events in AMI patients of the
      earlier CCS-1 trial. METHODS: Long-term follow-up was carried out in those
      hospitals which had recruited more than 20 cases in the CCS-1 trial. 8000
      patients with MI were thus selected for long-term follow-up. Data on 6749
      patients (84.4%) were available. RESULTS: Patient characteristics were comparable
      between the treatment group (n = 3391) and the placebo group (n = 3358). Average 
      follow-up time was 23.4 +/- 16.9 months; average age was 63.6 +/- 10.6 years, and
      76.2% were male. At the end of the follow-up time, cardiac function of NYHA
      III-IV was 9.0% in the treatment group and 9.8% in the placebo group; the
      reinfarction rate was 5.6% vs. 6.0%; total cardiovascular events were 32.9% vs.
      34.3%. Total mortality was 11.9% (n = 404) vs 13.8% (n = 463), with a 13.8%
      reduction in the captopril group (P = 0.03). Cardiovascular mortality was 10.0%
      vs. 11.8% (P = 0.01), death due to heart failure was 4.1% vs. 5.5% (P = 0.01).
      From the above results, it is estimated that early treatment with captopril can
      save 19 lives per 1000 patients treated; patients with systolic blood pressure
      (SBP) > or = 100 mm Hg at entry would have a long-term mortality 12.4% in the
      treatment group vs. 13.8% in the placebo group (P = 0.04) and patients with a
      heart rate (HR) > or = 60/minute at entry would have a long term mortality 12.0% 
      in captopril groups vs. 14.5% in the placebo group (P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Early 
      treatment with captopril during AMI for 4 weeks can significantly reduce
      long-term total mortality.

TI  - Efficacy of different drug classes used to initiate antihypertensive treatment in
      black subjects: results of a randomized trial in Johannesburg, South Africa.
PG  - 965-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Thiazides are recommended to initiate antihypertensive drug treatment
      in black subjects. OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy of this recommendation in a
      South African black cohort. METHODS: Men and women (N = 409), aged 18 to 70
      years, with a mean ambulatory daytime diastolic blood pressure between 90 and 114
      mm Hg, were randomized to 13 months of open-label treatment starting with the
      nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (30 mg/d, n = 233),
      sustained-release verapamil hydrochloride (240 mg/d, n = 58), hydrochlorothiazide
      (12.5 mg/d, n = 58), or enalapril maleate (10 mg/d, n = 60). If the target of
      reducing daytime diastolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg was not attained, the
      first-line drugs were titrated up and after 2 months other medications were added
      to the regimen. RESULTS: While receiving monotherapy (2 months, n = 366), the
      patients' systolic and diastolic decreases in daytime blood pressure averaged
      22/14 mm Hg for nifedipine, 17/11 mm Hg for verapamil, 12/8 mm Hg for
      hydrochlorothiazide, and 5/3 mm Hg for enalapril. At 2 months the blood pressure 
      of more patients treated with nifedipine was controlled: 133 (63.3%, P</=.03) vs 
      20 (39.9%) receiving verapamil, 21 (40.4%) receiving hydrochlorothiazide, and 11 
      (20.8%) receiving enalapril. At 13 months (n = 257), more patients (P<.001)
      continued receiving monotherapy with nifedipine (94/154 [61.0%]) or verapamil
      (22/35 [62.9%]) than hydrochlorothiazide (10/39 [25.6%]) or enalapril (1/29
      [3.4%]). A sustained decrease of left ventricular mass (P<.001) with no
      between-group differences was achieved at 4 and 13 months. CONCLUSIONS: In
      contrast to current recommendations, calcium channel blockers are more effective 
      than thiazides as initial treatment in black subjects with hypertension. If
      treatment is started with thiazides or converting-enzyme inhibitors, combination 
      therapy is more likely to be required to control blood pressure and reduce left
      ventricular mass.

TI  - Clinical effects of early angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor treatment for
      acute myocardial infarction are similar in the presence and absence of aspirin:
      systematic overview of individual data from 96,712 randomized patients.
      Angiotensin-converting Enzyme Inhibitor Myocardial Infarction Collaborative
      Group.
PG  - 1801-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine whether the clinical effects of early
      angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (ACEi) treatment for acute
      myocardial infarction (MI) are influenced by the concomitant use of aspirin
      (ASA). BACKGROUND: Aspirin and ACEi both reduce mortality when given early after 
      MI. Aspirin inhibits the synthesis of vasodilating prostaglandins, and, in
      principle, this inhibition might antagonize some of the effects of ACEi. But it
      is uncertain whether, in practice, this influences the effects of ACEi on
      mortality and major morbidity after MI. METHODS: This overview sought individual 
      patient data from all trials involving more than 1,000 patients randomly
      allocated to receive ACEi or control starting in the acute phase of MI (0-36 h
      from onset) and continuing for four to six weeks. Data on concomitant ASA use
      were available for 96,712 of 98,496 patients in four eligible trials (and for
      none of 1,556 patients in the one other eligible trial). RESULTS: Overall 30-day 
      mortality was 7.1% among patients allocated to ACEi and 7.6% among those
      allocated to control, corresponding to a 7% (standard deviation [SD], 2%)
      proportional reduction (95% confidence interval 2% to 11%, p = 0.004).
      Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor was associated with similar proportional 
      reductions in 30-day mortality among the 86,484 patients who were taking ASA (6% 
      [SD, 3%] reduction) and among the 10,228 patients who were not (10% [SD, 5%]
      reduction: chi-squared test of heterogeneity between these reductions = 0.4; p = 
      0.5). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor produced definite increases in the 
      incidence of persistent hypotension (17.9% ACEi vs. 9.4% control) and of renal
      dysfunction (1.3% ACEi vs. 0.6% control), but there was no good evidence that
      these effects were different in the presence or absence of ASA (chi-squared for
      heterogeneity = 0.4 and 0.0, respectively; both not significant). Nor was there
      good evidence that the effects of ACEi on other clinical outcomes were changed by
      concomitant ASA use. CONCLUSIONS: Both ASA and ACEi are beneficial in acute MI.
      The present results support the early use of ACEi in acute MI, irrespective of
      whether or not ASA is being given.

TI  - Effects of the administration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor
      during the acute phase of myocardial infarction in patients with arterial
      hypertension. SMILE Study Investigators. Survival of Myocardial Infarction
      Long-term Evaluation.
PG  - 665-72
AB  - A positive history of arterial hypertension (HBP) is present in as many as 30% of
      patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and their clinical outcome could 
      be greatly improved by drugs enhancing blood pressure control and preserving
      ventricular function. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the importance
      of a history of HBP on the clinical efficacy of early treatment with the
      angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor zofenopril in patients with
      anterior AMI. We summarize the results of a post-hoc analysis of data from the
      Survival of Myocardial Infarction Long-term Evaluation (SMILE) study, which
      randomly evaluated the efficacy of zofenopril given within 24 h of symptom onset 
      to patients with anterior AMI not undergoing thrombolysis. Of 1441 patients who
      entered the study, 565 (39.2%) had a history of HBP. The mean follow-up time was 
      12 months and the main outcome measures were 6-week combined occurrence of death 
      and severe congestive heart failure (CHF) and 1-year mortality. After 6-week of
      treatment with zofenopril the relative risk of death or severe CHF was 0.60 (95% 
      confidence interval [CI]: 0.45-0.81; 2P < .05) in the hypertensive group and 0.89
      (0.74-1.08; 2P = .62) for normotensive patients, whereas the 1-year risk of death
      was 0.61 (95% CI: 0.23,0.89; 2P < .05) and 0.77 (95% CI: 0.52-1.17; 2P = .22),
      respectively. The 6-week prevalence of mild-to-moderate CHF was also
      significantly reduced by zofenopril in the hypertensive population (14.1% v 9.4%;
      2P < .05). The present data suggest that treatment with zofenopril started within
      24 h of the onset of anterior AMI could be highly beneficial in patients with a
      history of HBP.

TI  - Effect of ACE inhibitor trandolapril on life expectancy of patients with reduced 
      left-ventricular function after acute myocardial infarction. TRACE Study Group.
      Trandolapril Cardiac Evaluation.
PG  - 9-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: The survival benefit from the use of inhibitors of
      angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in patients with acute myocardial infarction 
      is usually presented in terms of risk ratios and lives saved per 1000 people
      treated. A more relevant way to present the extent of benefit would be in terms
      of an increase in life expectancy, but this approach has not previously been
      possible because of limited data on long-term outcome. We aimed to calculate the 
      effect of trandolapril on life expectancy with follow-up data from the
      Trandolapril Cardiac Evaluation (TRACE) Study. METHODS: The TRACE study
      previously showed a significant survival benefit with trandolapril in patients
      with reduced left-ventricular function after an acute myocardial infarction who
      were treated for at least 2 years. We ascertained the survival status of all
      patients in the TRACE study in June, 1998, at which time they had been followed
      up for a minimum of 6 years. We estimated life expectancy as median lifetime,
      which was the time for 50% of the patients to have died. Change in life
      expectancy is expressed as change in median lifetime. Analysis was by intention
      to treat. FINDINGS: The life expectancy of patients was 4.6 years for those given
      placebo versus 6.2 years for those on trandolapril. Thus, for patients on
      trandolapril, median lifetime was increased by 15.3 months or 27% (95% CI 7 to
      51). Analysis of follow-up after the end of the study indicated no decrease of
      this benefit during the course of double-blind treatment; continued use of
      trandolapril was recommended at study closure. INTERPRETATION: In patients with
      severely reduced left-ventricular function, long-term treatment with an ACE
      inhibitor during the critical period after myocardial infarction is associated
      with a substantial increase in life expectancy.

TI  - Effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor trandolapril on mortality
      and morbidity in diabetic patients with left ventricular dysfunction after acute 
      myocardial infarction. Trace Study Group.
PG  - 83-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the efficacy of long-term treatment with the
      angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor trandolapril in diabetic patients
      with left ventricular dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
      BACKGROUND: Patients with diabetes mellitus have a high mortality following AMI, 
      probably due to a high risk of congestive heart failure and reinfarction. Because
      ACE inhibition effectively reduces progression of heart failure, it could be
      particularly beneficial in diabetic patients after AMI. METHODS: The study is a
      retrospective analysis using data from the Trandolapril Cardiac Evaluation
      (TRACE) study, which was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 
      trandolapril in 1,749 patients with AMI and ejection fraction < or =35%. The mean
      follow-up time was 26 months. RESULTS: A history of diabetes was found in 237
      (14%) of the 1,749 patients. Treatment with trandolapril resulted in a relative
      risk (RR) of death from any cause for the diabetic group of 0.64 (95% confidence 
      interval 0.45 to 0.91) versus 0.82 (0.69 to 0.97) for the nondiabetic group. In
      the diabetic group, trandolapril reduced the risk of progression to severe heart 
      failure markedly (RR, 0.38 [0.21 to 0.67]), and no significant reduction of this 
      end point was found in the nondiabetic group. CONCLUSIONS: The ACE inhibition
      after myocardial infarction complicated by left ventricular dysfunction appears
      to be of considerable importance in patients with diabetes mellitus by saving
      lives and substantially reducing the risk of progression to severe heart failure.

PG  - 139-41
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of long-term angiotensin-converting enzyme
      (ACE) inhibitor treatment with captopril on cardiac function in acute myocardial 
      infarction (AMI). METHODS: One hundred and one patients with AMI who were
      admitted to hospital within 72 hours of the onset of symptoms with no cardiogenic
      shock were randomly allocated to captopril (n = 52; group I) and conventional
      treatment (n = 49; group II). Left ventricular (LV) systolic performance and
      diastolic transmitral flow velocity profiles were assessed by Doppler
      echocardiography at admission (1.2 +/- 1.1 days), before discharge (27 +/- 10
      days) and during follow-up (363 +/- 31 days). RESULTS: At one year follow-up, in 
      group I LV end-diastolic volume decreased, and ejection fraction increased due to
      a disproportionate decrease in end-systolic volume. The incidence of cardiac
      dilatation was reduced. LV early diastolic filling velocity (E) increased and
      late atrial filling velocity (A) decreased, resulting in an elevation of E/A
      ratio. However, the mean values of LV systolic and diastolic functional
      parameters were unchanged in group II. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term treatment with
      captopril exerts a beneficial effect on cardiac protection for patients with AMI.

TI  - Effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition on sudden cardiac death in
      patients following acute myocardial infarction. A meta-analysis of randomized
      clinical trials.
PG  - 598-604
AB  - Estimate the effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on the risk
      of sudden cardiac death (SCD) following myocardial infarction (MI). BACKGROUND:
      Trials in post-MI patients have shown that ACE inhibitor therapy reduces
      mortality. However, the effect on SCD as a mechanism has not been clarified.
      METHODS: Trials of ACE inhibitor therapy following MI reported between January,
      1978 and August, 1997 were identified. Studies were included if they met the
      following criteria: 1) randomized comparison of ACE inhibitor to placebo within
      14 days of MI; 2) study duration/blinded follow-up of > or =6 weeks; 3) the
      number of deaths and modes of death were reported or could be obtained from the
      investigators. RESULTS: We identified 374 candidate articles, of which 15 met the
      inclusion criteria. The 15 trials included 15,104 patients, 2,356 of whom died.
      Most (87%) fatalities were cardiovascular and 900 were SCDs. A significant
      reduction in SCD risk or a trend towards this was observed in all of the larger
      (N > 500) trials. Overall, ACE inhibitor therapy resulted in significant
      reductions in risk of death (random effects odds ratio [OR] = 0.83; 95%
      confidence interval [CI] 0.71-0.97), cardiovascular death (OR = 0.82; 95% CI
      0.69-0.97) and SCD (OR = 0.80; 95% CI 0.70-0.92). CONCLUSIONS: This analysis is
      consistent with prior reports showing that ACE inhibitors decrease the risk of
      death following a recent MI by reducing cardiovascular mortality. Moreover, this 
      analysis suggests that a reduction in SCD risk with ACE inhibitors is an
      important component of this survival benefit.

PG  - 672-80
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the efficacy and safety of fosinopril in the treatment
      of chronic heart failure (CHF), patients with mild to moderate CHF and left
      ventricular ejection fractions <40% were randomly assigned in a double-blind
      manner to receive fosinopril 5 to 20 mg every day (n = 122) or enalapril 5 to 20 
      mg every day (n = 132) for 1 year. RESULTS: The event-free survival time was
      longer (1.6 vs 1.0 months, P= .032) and the total rate of hospitalizations plus
      deaths was smaller with fosinopril than with enalapril (19.7% vs 25.0%, P= .028).
      There was consistently better symptom improvement with fosinopril (P< .05). The
      incidence of orthostatic hypotension was lower in the fosinopril group (1.6% vs
      7.6%, P< .05). CONCLUSIONS: Fosinopril 5 to 20 mg every day was more effective in
      improving symptoms and delaying events related to worsening of CHF and produced
      less orthostatic hypotension than enalapril 5 to 20 mg every day.

      myocardial infarction: a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo
      controlled clinical trial. Chinese Cardiac Study (CCS-1) Collaborative Group.
PG  - 834-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of captopril on mortality and morbidity after
      acute myocardial infarction (AMI). METHODS: A total of 14,962 patients entering
      650 hospitals from 30 provinces and autonomous regions of China up to 36 hours
      (mean 16.6 +/- 10.2 hours) after the onset of suspected acute myocardial
      infarction (MI) with no clear contraindications or indications to the study
      treatments (in particular, no persistent hypotension or hypovolemia due to
      long-term use of large dose of diuretics) were randomized to use either 4 weeks
      of oral captopril (6.25 mg initial dose, 12.5 mg 2 hours later, and then 12.5 mg 
      three times daily) or matching placebo. RESULTS: Captopril was associated with a 
      non-significant reduction in 4-week mortality (9.12% vs 9.74%; P = 0.20); but
      incidence of heart failure was significantly reduced among captopril group (17.0%
      vs 18.7%; P = 0.01). The combined end point (death + heart failure) was 1680
      (21.5%) in captopril group and 1733 (23.1%) in placebo group (P = 0.02). Anterior
      wall infarction of captopril treated group was found to have lower mortality
      (8.6% vs 10.2%, P = 0.02). Captopril treated group with a heart rate (HR) > or = 
      60/min at entry showed significantly lower mortality than placebo group (9.2% vs 
      10.7%; P = 0.01). There was a significant excess of hypotension, mostly after the
      start of treatment, but no evidence of any adverse effect on early mortality.
      CONCLUSIONS: The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (CEI) therapy started
      early in acute MI prevents about 6 deaths per 1000 treated, and about 15 deaths
      due to heart failure per 1000 in the 1st 4 weeks with greater benefits. In
      anterior myocardial infarction group it prevents 16 deaths per 1000 with nearly
      no benefit for the inferior infarction group. Due to the parasympathetic mimic
      effect, CEI should be used carefully in inferior infarction patients especially
      when HR is slow or heart block and hypotension are present.

TI  - Short- and long-term effects of early fosinopril administration in patients with 
      acute anterior myocardial infarction undergoing intravenous thrombolysis: results
      from the Fosinopril in Acute Myocardial Infarction Study. FAMIS Working Party.
PG  - 213-25
AB  - BACKGROUND: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are used in patients who
      have myocardial infarction with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. Few data are
      available in patients whose LV function is within the normal range. METHODS AND
      RESULTS: The Fosinopril in Acute Myocardial Infarction Study was a 2-year,
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of 285 patients
      with anterior acute myocardial infarction and was designed to investigate the
      effects of the early (<9 hours) administration of fosinopril and thrombolysis on 
      (1) changes in echocardiographically evaluated LV volumes at 3 months and (2)
      long-term occurrence of death and congestive heart failure. LV volumes were
      normal at baseline in more than 70% of patients and were comparable between
      groups both at baseline and after 3 months of treatment. Fosinopril-treated
      patients showed a 30% reduction in the 2-year combined prevalence of death or
      moderate-to-severe congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association class
      III-IV) despite having a worse clinical profile at baseline. The benefit of
      fosinopril was confirmed both in patients without congestive heart failure at
      admission and in those with ejection fraction >40% at baseline. Moreover, the
      incidence of significant ventricular arrhythmias was lower in the fosinopril
      group (0.8% vs 6.0%, p < 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The results of the Fosinopril in
      Acute Myocardial Infarction Study suggest that early treatment with fosinopril
      can benefit patients with acute myocardial infarction in addition to a prevention
      of LV remodeling.

TI  - Effect of the ACE inhibitor lisinopril on mortality in diabetic patients with
      acute myocardial infarction: data from the GISSI-3 study.
PG  - 4239-45
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mortality of diabetic patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) 
      remains high despite recent improvement in their management. There is a need to
      evaluate efficacy and safety of novel treatments of MI in this high-risk
      population. We evaluated whether treatment with an ACE inhibitor begun within 24 
      hours from the onset of symptoms is able to decrease mortality and morbidity of
      diabetic patients with acute MI. METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective analysis of
      the data of the GISSI-3 study in patients with and without a history of diabetes 
      was performed. Patients with suspected acute MI were randomized to treatment with
      lisinopril (2.5 to 5 up to 10 mg/d) with or without nitroglycerin (5 to 20 microg
      I.V. then 10 mg/d) begun within 24 hours and continued for 6 weeks. The main end 
      point was mortality at 6 weeks, and the secondary end point was a combined
      evaluation of mortality and severe left ventricular dysfunction. Information on
      diabetic status was available for 18,131 patients (approximately 94% of the total
      population enrolled), of whom 2790 patients had a history of diabetes. Treatment 
      with lisinopril was associated with a decreased 6-week mortality in diabetic
      patients (8.7% versus 12.4%; OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.86; 37+/-12 lives saved 
      per 1000 treated patients), an effect that was significantly (P<.025) higher than
      that observed in nondiabetic patients. The survival benefit in diabetics was
      mostly maintained at 6 months despite withdrawal from treatment at 6 weeks (12.9%
      versus 16.1%; OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.95). CONCLUSIONS: Early treatment with 
      the ACE inhibitor lisinopril in diabetic patients with acute MI is associated
      with a decreased 6-week mortality. This beneficial effect supports a widespread
      and early use of ACE inhibitors in diabetic patients with acute MI. The burden of
      mortality plus morbidity for ventricular dysfunction in diabetics remains
      clinically important and warrants further testing of novel therapeutic
      approaches.

TI  - Cardiovascular death and left ventricular remodeling two years after myocardial
      infarction: baseline predictors and impact of long-term use of captopril:
      information from the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) trial.
PG  - 3294-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: We quantified cardiovascular death and/or left ventricular (LV)
      dilatation in patients from the SAVE trial to determine whether dilatation
      continued beyond 1 year, whether ACE inhibitor therapy attenuated late LV
      dilatation, and whether any baseline descriptors predicted late dilatation.
      METHODS AND RESULTS: Two-dimensional echocardiograms were obtained in 512
      patients at 11+/-3 days and 1 and 2 years postinfarction to assess LV size,
      percentage of the LV that was akinetic/dyskinetic (%AD), and LV shape index. LV
      function was assessed by radionuclide ejection fraction. Two hundred sixty-three 
      patients (51.4%) sustained cardiovascular death and/or LV diastolic dilatation;
      279 (54.5%) had cardiovascular death and/or systolic dilatation. In 373 patients 
      with serial echocardiograms, LV end-diastolic and end-systolic sizes increased
      progressively from baseline to 2 years (both P<.01). More patients with LV
      dilatation had a decrease in ejection fraction: 24.8% versus 6.8% (P<.001)
      (diastole) and 25.7% versus 5.3% (P<.001) (systole). Captopril attenuated
      diastolic LV dilatation at 2 years (P=.048), but this effect was carried over
      from the first year of therapy because changes in LV size with captopril beyond 1
      year were similar to those with placebo. Predictors of cardiovascular death
      and/or dilatation were age (P=.023), prior infarction (P<.001), lower ejection
      fraction (P<.001), angina (P=.007), heart failure (P=.002), LV size (P<.001), and
      infarct size (%AD) (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular death and/or LV
      dilatation occurred in >50% of patients by 2 years. LV dilatation is progressive,
      associated with chamber distortion and deteriorating function that is unaffected 
      by captopril beyond 1 year.

TI  - Long-term anti-ischemic effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in
      patients after myocardial infarction. The Captopril and Thrombolysis Study (CATS)
      Investigators.
PG  - 400-5
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to test the hypothesis that
      angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition reduces myocardial ischemia and
      related events after myocardial infarction (MI). BACKGROUND: The oxygen
      demand/supply ratio of the myocardium is influenced by angiotensin II as a result
      of its arterial vasoconstrictive and inotropic effects and through its
      interaction with the sympathetic nervous system. METHODS: We studied 244 patients
      who had been included in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, post-MI,
      ACE inhibition intervention study (Captopril and Thrombolysis Study [CATS]). All 
      patients underwent exercise testing before and 3 and 12 months after hospital
      discharge. After 1-year double-blind treatment, all patients continued receiving 
      single-blind placebo for 1 month. RESULTS: Total exercise time increased in both 
      groups after 3 months (placebo: +86 +/- 13 s; captopril: +69 +/- 12 s, p = 0.8
      between groups) and increased further after 1 year (placebo: +13 +/- 11 s;
      captopril: +33 +/- 13 s, p = 0.7 between groups). There were also no differences 
      in mean ST segment depression. During the 12 months, significantly fewer
      ischemia-related events occurred in the captopril group (82 vs. 52, p = 0.015).
      This difference was found between 3 and 12 months but not during the first 3
      months. After withdrawal from double-blind medication, nine ischemic events were 
      reported in teh captopril group compared with one in the placebo group (p = 0.006
      between groups). CONCLUSIONS: The present data show that captopril may reduce the
      incidence of ischemia-related events after MI, which becomes apparent after 3
      months. However, no anti-ischemic effect was observed during exercise testing.
      After withdrawal from ACE inhibition, a high incidence of clinical events
      occurred, suggesting a rebound phenomenon.

      congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class II to III) and 
      left ventricular ejection fraction </=40% were randomly assigned to a treatment
      period of 4 weeks with 10 mg quinapril once daily or 12.5 mg captopril twice
      daily. At the end of this period, doses were titrated to 20 mg quinapril once
      daily or 25 mg captopril twice daily on the basis of physician judgment if there 
      were no major adverse reactions and if blood pressure was not below 110/70 mm Hg.
      Clinical symptoms of heart failure were significantly relieved by both drugs at
      the end of a 12-week treatment period. At the beginning of the study, 23 (35%) of
      the 65 patients taking quinapril and 27 (41%) of the 66 patients taking captopril
      were in NYHA functional class III, whereas, at the end of the trial, only 4 (6%) 
      of the patients in the quinapril group and 14 (22%; p < 0.05 versus quinapril)
      patients in the captopril group were classified as NYHA class III. Both drugs had
      a positive effect on echocardiographic parameters. There was a statistically
      significant increase in exercise duration in both treatment groups (quinapril,
      6.2 +/- 1.8 versus 7.8 +/- 1.9 minutes, p < 0.001; captopril, 5.9 +/- 1.9 versus 
      7.1 +/- 2.3 minutes, p < 0.001). One patient in the quinapril group died suddenly
      during the study and two patients in the captopril group dropped out of the study
      due to persistent dry cough. No patient in the quinapril group reported side
      effects. Three patients in the captopril group suffered from moderate dry cough, 
      one from taste-blindness, and another from unstable angina. The safety of the
      tested drugs was confirmed by laboratory tests. Quinapril was as effective as
      captopril in reducing signs and symptoms of heart failure and in improving the
      left ventricular function and the exercise capacity with few side effects.

TI  - Effect of ramipril on morbidity and mode of death among survivors of acute
      myocardial infarction with clinical evidence of heart failure. A report from the 
      AIRE Study Investigators.
PG  - 41-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: The importance of the effects of ACE inhibitors on sudden death,
      progressive heart failure and recurrent infarction to the reduction in overall
      mortality in heart failure and after myocardial infarction is disputed. METHODS: 
      The AIRE study randomized 2006 patients with clinical or radiological evidence of
      heart failure within 2-9 days of a myocardial infarction to receive ramipiril 5
      mg b.d. or matching placebo. Outcomes were assessed independently by members of
      an end-points committee blinded to treatment allocation. RESULTS: Fewer patients 
      developed severe resistant heart failure as their first validated end-point on
      rampril, despite the greater number of at-risk survivors, compared to placebo (n 
      = 143 vs 178; risk reduction 23%; CI 5 to 39%; P = 0.017). Ramipril did not alter
      the rate of reinfarction or stroke. Irrespective of treatment allocation 182
      (46%) patients developed resistant heart failure prior to death. A validated
      acute or remote myocardial reinfarction occurred in 76 (19%) patients prior to
      death and chest pain occurred in 90 (23%) patients around the time of death
      suggesting an ischaemic element to these deaths Eighty deaths occurred on the
      index admission, 167 during re-admission and 145 out-of-hospital. Sudden death
      accounted for 54% of all deaths and 93% of out-of-hospital deaths. Ramipril
      reduced the risk of sudden death by 30% (95% CI: 8-47%; P = 0.011). However,
      overall, 45% of those patients who died suddenly had severe or worsening heart
      failure prior to their death. Only 39% of sudden deaths were considered to be due
      to arrhythmias. Ramipril reduced the risk of death from circulatory failure by
      18%, but this did not reach statistical significance (95% CI; 41 to -14%; P =
      0.237). The magnitude of the effects on sudden death and death due to circulatory
      failure were not significantly different. However, 38% of the reduction in
      overall mortality was from the subgroup with sudden death who had developed prior
      severe resistant heart failure (placebo n = 35, ramipril n = 15), again
      emphasizing the marked benefit in preventing failure. Ramipril did not
      selectively alter the proportion of in- to out-of-hospital deaths. CONCLUSION:
      Ramipril reduces mortality and progression to resistant heart failure among
      patients with evidence of heart failure early after myocardial infarction.
      Retarding the progression of heart failure appears to be a major factor
      contributing to the reduction in mortality both by reducing circulatory failure
      and by reducing sudden death.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of early and long-term angiotensin-converting
      enzyme inhibitor treatment with captopril on clinical outcome in patients with
      acute myocardial infarction (AMI). METHODS: Eight hundred and twenty-two patients
      with AMI who were hospitalised within 72 hours of symptoms and had no cardiogenic
      shock were randomly allocated to captopril (n = 478, Group I) and conventional
      treatment (n = 344, Group II). Cardiac events including congestive heart failure,
      reinfarction, severe arrhythmias and cardiac death during hospitalization and
      follow-up period (average 20 months) were determined. RESULTS: The overall
      mortality rate during hospitalization was lower in group I than in group II (P = 
      0.0001), this was true for patients with anterior (P = 0.0003), inferior (P =
      0.0411) and anterior inferior AMI (P = 0.0232). During follow-up, despite similar
      occurrence rate of reinfarction and severe arrhythmias in the two groups, the
      mortality rate (P = 0.0324) and total cardiac event rate (P = 0.055) were lower
      in group I than in group II. CONCLUSIONS: After AMI, early and long-term
      treatment with captopril exerts a beneficial effect on the prognosis of patients.

      congestive heart failure in patients with anterior wall acute myocardial
      infarction. The SMILE Study Investigators. Survival of Myocardial Infarction
      Long-term Evaluation.
PG  - 317-22
AB  - Chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) is a common disease responsible for a high
      mortality and morbidity whose clinical course can be improved by
      angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibition. However, limited data are
      available on the effects of ACE inhibitors on the onset and progression of CHF in
      patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The present study was performed 
      as a substudy of the Survival of Myocardial Infarction Long-term Evaluation trial
      and involved 1,146 patients with anterior wall AMI not undergoing thrombolysis
      with the exclusion of patients with prior history or clinical signs of CHF on
      admission. Patients were randomly allocated to treatment with zofenopril (7.5 to 
      30 mg twice daily) or placebo for a cumulative period of 6 weeks. The prevalence 
      of CHF, either mild to moderate or severe, has been the main objective and has
      been evaluated 6 weeks and 1 year after AMI. The overall prevalence of CHF was
      not reduced by zofenopril after both 6 weeks and 12 months. Conversely the
      prevalence of severe CHF (1.6% vs 2.6%: risk reduction 55.5%; 95% confidence
      interval 9 to 63; p = 0.0325) and the combined occurrence of death or severe CHF 
      (4.8% vs 8.2%: risk reduction 59%; 95% confidence interval 11 to 71; p = 0.024)
      were reduced after 6 weeks of treatment with zofenopril. Moreover, the percentage
      of patients experiencing a deterioration to severe CHF after 1 year was
      significantly reduced with zofenopril (11.0% vs 24.3%; p = 0.001). In conclusion,
      the early administration of zofenopril to patients with AMI attenuates the
      progression of the clinical symptoms of CHF and its clinical consequences,
      suggesting that ACE inhibitors should be regarded as a suitable strategy for the 
      prevention and treatment of CHF in patients with AMI.

TI  - Which patient benefits from early angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition after 
      myocardial infarction? Results of one-year serial echocardiographic follow-up
      from the Captopril and Thrombolysis Study (CATS).
PG  - 114-21
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In this study we sought to investigate the effect of intervention
      with captopril within 6 h of the onset of myocardial infarction on left
      ventricular volume and clinical symptoms of heart failure in relation to infarct 
      size during a 1-year follow-up period. BACKGROUND: Remodeling of the heart starts
      in the early phase of myocardial infarction and is associated with an adverse
      prognosis. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition started in the subacute or
      late phase after myocardial infarction has been shown to improve prognosis.
      METHODS: In the Captopril and Thrombolysis Study, 298 patients with a first
      anterior myocardial infarction treated with intravenous streptokinase were
      randomized to receive either oral captopril (25 mg three times a day) or placebo.
      The left ventricular volume index was assessed by two-dimensional
      echocardiography within 24 h, on days 3, 10 and 90 and after 1 year. RESULTS: A
      small but significant increase in left ventricular volume indexes was observed
      after 12 months. Using a random coefficient model, no significant treatment
      effect on left ventricular volumes could be detected. In contrast, when survival 
      models were used, the occurrence of left ventricular dilation was significatnly
      lower in captopril-treated patients (p = 0.018). In addition, the incidence of
      heart failure was lower in the captopril group (p < 0.03). This effect appeared
      early and was most obvious in patients with a medium-sized infarct (p = 0.04) and
      was not present in large infarcts. CONCLUSIONS: Very early treatment with
      captopril after myocardial infarction significantly reduces the occurrence of
      early dilation and the progression to heart failure. These data underscore the
      importance of early treatment. Furthermore, patients with intermediate infarct
      size benefit the most from this treatment strategy.

      CONSENSUS II multiecho study group.
PG  - 71-7
AB  - Beta-blockers reduce infarct size and improve survival after acute myocardial
      infarction (MI). Post-MI angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition also improves
      survival and may attenuate left ventricular (LV) dilatation. We evaluated the
      effect of early enalapril treatment on LV volumes and ejection fraction (EF) in
      patients on concomitant beta-blockade after MI. Intravenous enalaprilat or
      placebo was administered <24 hours after MI and was continued orally for 6
      months. LV volumes were assessed by echocardiography 3 +/- 2 days, 1 and 6 months
      after MI. Change in LV diastolic volume during the first month was attenuated
      with enalapril (2.7 vs placebo 6.5 ml/m2 change; p < 0.05), and significantly
      lower LV diastolic and systolic volumes were observed with enalapril treatment
      compared with placebo at 1 month (enalapril 47.21 23.9 vs placebo 53.1/29.2
      ml/m2; p < 0.05) and at 6 months (enalapril 47.9/24.8 vs placebo 53.8/29.6 ml/m2;
      p < 0.05). EF was also significantly higher 1 month after MI in these patients
      (enalapril 50.4% vs placebo 46.4%; p < 0.05). Our date demonstrate that early
      enalapril treatment attenuates LV volume expansion and maintains lower LV volumes
      and higher EF in patients receiving concurrent beta-blockade after MI. A possible
      additive effect of combined therapy should be evaluated prospectively.

TI  - Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition after myocardial infarction: the
      Trandolapril Cardiac Evaluation Study.
PG  - 235-43
AB  - To study the importance of giving an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
      inhibitor to patients with reduced systolic function after an infarction, the
      Trandodolapril Cardiac Evaluation study was designed to include the majority of
      patients with echocardiographic signs of left ventricular dysfunction among
      consecutively screened patients with infarctions. A total of 2606 consecutive
      patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction corresponding to an ejection 
      fraction < or = 35% were identified. Of these patients, 1749 (67%) were randomly 
      assigned to receive oral trandolapril or placebo beginning on day 3 to 7 after
      the infarction. The follow-up period was 2 to 4 years. Trandolapril reduced
      all-cause mortality, with a relative risk reduction associated with trandolapril 
      treatment of 0.78 (p = 0.0013). Benefit was seen within 1 month of treatment.
      Trandolapril also reduced cardiovascular death (relative risk 0.75, p = 0.001),
      sudden death (relative risk 0.76, p = 0.03), and progression to severe/ resistant
      heart failure (relative risk 0.71, p = 0.003). Recurrent myocardial infarction
      (fatal or nonfatal) was not significantly reduced (relative risk 0.86, p = 0.29).
      More than 80% of patients in both treatment groups reached the target dose of 4
      mg trandolapril or placebo at the end of dose titration. Nearly half of the
      patients in both treatment groups discontinued taking study medication before
      death or trial closure. The need for open-label ACE inhibition was the reason for
      discontinuation for 48 and 75 patients in the trandolapril and placebo groups,
      respectively. In conclusion, long-term treatment with trandolapril in patients
      with reduced left ventricular function shortly after myocardial infarction
      significantly reduced mortality and morbidity. Most patients received the target 
      dose of 4 mg trandolapril daily. The benefit observed is likely to reflect the
      benefit in clinical practice because the majority of eligible patients were
      randomized and the difference in patients leaving the trial to receive open-label
      ACE inhibition was moderate.

AB  - In the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (LVD), enalapril or placebo was
      administered in a double-blind fashion to 6797 participants with ejection
      fraction < or = 0.35. During 40 months' average follow-up, 28.1% of participants 
      randomized to enalapril reported side effects compared with 16.0% in the placebo 
      group (p < 0.0001). Enalapril use was associated with a higher rate of symptoms
      related to hypotension (14.8% vs 7.1%, p < 0.0001), azotemia (3.8% vs 1.6%, p <
      0.0001), cough (5.0% vs 2.0%, p < 0.0001), fatigue (5.8% vs 3.5%, p < 0.0001),
      hyperkalemia (1.2% vs 0.4%, p = 0.0002), and angioedema (0.4% vs 0.1%, p < 0.05).
      Side effects resulted in discontinuation of blinded therapy in 15.2% of the
      enalapril group compared with 8.6% in the placebo group (p < 0.0001). Thus
      enalapril is well tolerated by patients with LVD; however, hypotension, azotemia,
      cough, fatigue, and other side effects result in discontinuation of therapy in a 
      significant minority of patients.

      trinitrate singly and together withdrawn six weeks after acute myocardial
      infarction: the GISSI-3 trial. Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza 
      nell'Infarto Miocardico.
PG  - 337-44
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This 6-month follow-up analysis sought to assess whether the early
      reduction of mortality obtained with a 6-week treatment course of lisinopril or
      glyceryl trinitrate, or both, in unselected patients with acute myocardial
      infarction outlasts therapy and is still present after 6 months. The primary
      outcome of the 6-month follow-up was the combined end point of mortality and
      severe left ventricular dysfunction. BACKGROUND: The assumption was that the
      early benefit on remodeling processes may be maintained over a longer period of
      time, even in the absence of treatment. METHODS: A total of 19,394 patients with 
      acute myocardial infarction were randomized within 24 h of onset of symptoms to a
      6-week treatment course of oral lisinopril or open control and, according to a 2 
      x 2 factorial design, to glyceryl trinitrate or open control. Randomized
      treatments were stopped after 6 weeks in the absence of specific indications, and
      the patients were followed up for 6 months. RESULTS: At 6 months, among patients 
      randomized to lisinopril, 18.1% died or developed severe ventricular dysfunction 
      versus 19.3% of those randomized to no lisinopril (2p = 0.03). No difference was 
      found between patients with and without glyceryl trinitrate therapy (18.4% vs.
      18.9%, 2p = 0.39). CONCLUSIONS: Although the systematic administration of
      glyceryl trinitrate started early and continued for 6 weeks after acute
      myocardial infarction does not yield evidence of benefit, early treatment with
      lisinopril appears to improve prognosis. This effect seems to carry over the
      first 6 months from randomization, even after treatment withdrawal.

TI  - A clinical trial of the angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor trandolapril in
      patients with left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction.
      Trandolapril Cardiac Evaluation (TRACE) Study Group.
PG  - 1670-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment with angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduces
      mortality among survivors of acute myocardial infarction, but whether to use ACE 
      inhibitors in all patients or only in selected patients is uncertain. METHODS: We
      screened 6676 consecutive patients with 7001 myocardial infarctions confirmed by 
      enzyme studies. A total of 2606 patients had echocardiographic evidence of left
      ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction, < or = 35 percent). On days 
      3 to 7 after infarction, 1749 patients were randomly assigned to receive oral
      trandolapril (876 patients) or placebo (873 patients). The duration of follow-up 
      was 24 to 50 months. RESULTS: During the study period, 304 patients (34.7
      percent) in the trandolapril group died, as compared with 369 (42.3 percent) in
      the placebo group (P = 0.001). The relative risk of death in the trandolapril
      group, as compared with the placebo group, was 0.78 (95 percent confidence
      interval, 0.67 to 0.91). Trandolapril also reduced the risk of death from
      cardiovascular causes (relative risk, 0.75; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.63 
      to 0.89; P = 0.001) and sudden death (relative risk, 0.76; 95 percent confidence 
      interval, 0.59 to 0.98; P = 0.03). Progression to severe heart failure was less
      frequent in the trandolapril group (relative risk, 0.71; 95 percent confidence
      interval, 0.56 to 0.89; P = 0.003). In contrast, the risk of recurrent myocardial
      infarction (fatal or nonfatal) was not significantly reduced (relative risk,
      0.86; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.66 to 1.13; P = 0.29). CONCLUSIONS:
      Long-term treatment with trandolapril in patients with reduced left ventricular
      function soon after myocardial infarction significantly reduced the risk of
      overall mortality, mortality from cardiovascular causes, sudden death, and the
      development of severe heart failure. That mortality was reduced in a randomized
      study enrolling 25 percent of consecutive patients screened should encourage the 
      selective use of ACE inhibition after myocardial infarction.

TI  - Clinical characteristics and mortality of patients screened for entry into the
      Trandolapril Cardiac Evaluation (TRACE) study.
PG  - 1-5
AB  - In mortality studies of patients after acute myocardial infarction (AMI),
      exclusion of patients during selection from the screened population may be
      important for evaluating the impact of trials, but data on patients excluded from
      studies are rarely presented. In the Trandolapril Cardiac Evaluation (TRACE)
      trial of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor trandolapril versus placebo 
      in patients with left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction shortly after AMI,
      medical history, infarct complication, and survival were accounted for in all
      patients screened for entry. A total of 7,001 consecutive enzyme-confirmed AMIs
      were screened for entry in 27 Danish coronary care units. The 1-year mortality of
      all screened AMI cases was 23% (95% confidence interval 22% to 24%). The target
      population of the TRACE trial were patients with LV systolic dysfunction
      (echocardiographically determined wall motion index < or = 1.2, n = 2,606 within 
      6 days of AMI. The 1-year mortality of this group was 34 +/- 2%. Patients with
      wall motion index > 1.2 (n = 3,920) had a 1-year mortality of 12 +/- 1%. were
      excluded. A total of 1,749 were included in the study. The excluded and included 
      groups had a 1-year mortality of 54 +/- 3% and 24 +/- 2%, respectively. The
      result of the TRACE study will be applicable to two thirds of the patients with
      LV systolic dysfunction; however, even with this high figure, care should be
      taken in extrapolating the result to the general population with reduced LV
      function after AMI since the group excluded from the study had a higher mortality
      than those who were included.

TI  - Overview of randomized trials of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on
      mortality and morbidity in patients with heart failure. Collaborative Group on
      ACE Inhibitor Trials.
PG  - 1450-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
      inhibitors on mortality and morbidity in patients with symptomatic congestive
      heart failure. DATA SOURCE AND STUDY SELECTION: Data were obtained for all
      completed, published or unpublished, randomized, placebo-controlled trials of ACE
      inhibitors that were at least 8 weeks in duration and had determined total
      mortality by intention to treat, regardless of sample size. Trials were
      identified based on literature review and correspondence with investigators and
      pharmaceutical firms. DATA EXTRACTION: Using standard tables, data were extracted
      by one author and confirmed where necessary by the other author or the principal 
      investigator of the trial. Unpublished data were obtained by direct
      correspondence with the principal investigator of each study or pharmaceutical
      firm. DATA SYNTHESIS: The data for each outcome were combined using the
      Yusuf-Peto adaptation of the Mantel-Haenszel method. Overall, there was a
      statistically significant reduction in total mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0.77;
      95% confidence interval [CI], 0.67 to 0.88; P < .001) and in the combined
      endpoint of mortality or hospitalization for congestive heart failure (OR, 0.65; 
      95% CI, 0.57 to 0.74; P < .001). Similar benefits were observed with several
      different ACE inhibitors, although the data were largely based on enalapril
      maleate, captopril, ramipril, quinapril hydrochloride, and lisinopril. Reductions
      for total mortality and the combined endpoint were similar for various subgroups 
      examined (age, sex, etiology, and New York Heart Association class). However,
      patients with the lowest ejection fraction appeared to have the greatest benefit.
      The greatest effect was seen during the first 3 months, but additional benefit
      was observed during further treatment. The reduction in mortality was primarily
      due to fewer deaths from progressive heart failure (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.58 to
      0.83); point estimates for effects on sudden or presumed arrhythmic deaths (OR,
      0.91; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.12) and fatal myocardial infarction (OR, 0.82; 95% CI,
      0.60 to 1.11) were less than 1 but were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Total
      mortality and hospitalization for congestive heart failure are significantly
      reduced by ACE inhibitors with consistent effects in a broad range of patients.

      chronic heart failure.
PG  - 287-92
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects on renal function of captopril and enalapril in
      elderly patients with chronic heart failure. DESIGN: A multi-centre double-blind 
      parallel-group comparison of the two angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
      inhibitors, captopril (12.5 mg bid) and enalapril (2.5 mg bid). SUBJECTS: 80
      elderly patients with chronic heart failure (41 in the captopril group, 39 in the
      enalapril group). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The blood pressure and pulse rate
      response to the first dose of ACE inhibitor was assessed in all patients.
      Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was measured radioisotopically by 99mTcDTPA or
      51CrEDTA clearance after three and six months of each treatment. Subgroups were
      assessed for effective renal plasma flow (33 patients), exercise tolerance (25
      patients) and by a symptom-oriented questionnaire (45 patients). RESULTS: No
      serious adverse effect on GFR was noticed. There was no significant difference
      between the two treatments in the mean baseline GFR or in changes from baseline
      at three and six months (captopril mean baseline GFR 49.6 ml min-1 1.76 m-2,
      enalapril 54.7 ml min-1 1.76 m-2; mean change (95% confidence interval) at three 
      months captopril 12 ml min-1 (+3.0, +21.0), enalapril -2 ml min-1 (-13.0; +9.0); 
      mean change at six months, captopril 3.7 ml min-1 (-6.7; +14.2), enalapril -6.0
      ml min-1 (-21.0; +9.4). Significantly more patients given captopril had an
      improvement in GFR during the study period (26/31 compared with 20/31
      enalapril-treated patients at three months, p = 0.0096, and 23/30 compared with
      15/27 at six months, p = 0.021). There were no significant changes in effective
      renal plasma flow. Three patients treated with enalapril developed symptomatic
      hypotension within three days of starting treatment. Quality of life
      questionnaires revealed more gastrointestinal symptoms in the enalapril group (p 
      = 0.039). CONCLUSIONS: Captopril seems marginally preferable to enalapril in the 
      treatment of chronic heart failure in elderly patients.

TI  - ISIS-4: a randomised factorial trial assessing early oral captopril, oral
      mononitrate, and intravenous magnesium sulphate in 58,050 patients with suspected
      acute myocardial infarction. ISIS-4 (Fourth International Study of Infarct
      Survival) Collaborative Group.
PG  - 669-85
AB  - 58,050 patients entering 1086 hospitals up to 24 h (median 8 h) after the onset
      of suspected acute myocardial infarction (MI) with no clear contraindications to 
      the study treatments (in particular, no cardiogenic shock or persistent severe
      hypotension) were randomised in a "2 x 2 x 2 factorial" study. The treatment
      comparisons were: (i) 1 month of oral captopril (6.25 mg initial dose titrated up
      to 50 mg twice daily) versus matching placebo; (ii) 1 month of oral
      controlled-release mononitrate (30 mg initial dose titrated up to 60 mg once
      daily) versus matching placebo; and (iii) 24 h of intravenous magnesium sulphate 
      (8 mmol initial bolus followed by 72 mmol) versus open control. There were no
      significant "interactions" between the effects of these three treatments, and the
      results for each are based on the randomised comparison of about 29,000 active
      versus 29,000 control allocated patients. Captopril There was a significant 7%
      (SD 3) proportional reduction in 5-week mortality (2088 [7.19%]
      captopril-allocated deaths vs 2231 [7.69%] placebo; 2p = 0.02), which corresponds
      to an absolute difference of 4.9 SD 2.2 fewer deaths per 1000 patients treated
      for 1 month. The absolute benefits appeared to be larger (perhaps about 10 fewer 
      deaths per 1000) in certain higher-risk groups, such as those presenting with a
      history of previous MI or with heart failure. The survival advantage appeared to 
      be maintained in the longer term (5.4 [SD 2.8] fewer deaths per 1000 at 12
      months). Captopril was associated with an increase of 52 (SD 2) patients per 1000
      in hypotension considered severe enough to require termination of study
      treatment, of 5 (SD 2) per 1000 in reported cardiogenic shock, and of 5 (SD 1)
      per 1000 in some degree of renal dysfunction. It produced no excess of deaths on 
      days 0-1, even among patients with low blood pressure at entry. Mononitrate There
      was no significant reduction in 5-week mortality, either overall (2129 [7.34%]
      mononitrate-allocated deaths vs 2190 [7.54%] placebo) or in any subgroup examined
      (including those receiving short-term non-study intravenous or oral nitrates at
      entry). Further follow-up did not indicate any later survival advantage. The only
      significant side-effect of the mononitrate regimen studied was an increase of 15 
      (SD 2) per 1000 in hypotension. Those allocated active treatment had somewhat
      fewer deaths on days 0-1, which is reassuring a bout the safety of using nitrates
      early in acute MI.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

TI  - The effect of the angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor zofenopril on mortality
      and morbidity after anterior myocardial infarction. The Survival of Myocardial
      Infarction Long-Term Evaluation (SMILE) Study Investigators.
PG  - 80-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Left ventricular dilatation and neuroendocrine activation are common 
      after acute anterior myocardial infarction. Long-term treatment with an
      angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor may improve outcome by attenuating 
      these processes. We investigated whether the ACE inhibitor zofenopril,
      administered for six weeks after anterior myocardial infarction, could improve
      both short-term and long-term outcome. METHODS: A total of 1556 patients were
      enrolled within 24 hours after the onset of symptoms of acute anterior myocardial
      infarction, and they were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to receive 
      either placebo (784 patients) or zofenopril (772 patients) for six weeks. At this
      time we assessed the incidence of death or severe congestive heart failure. The
      patients were reexamined after one year to assess survival. RESULTS: The
      incidence of death or severe congestive heart failure at six weeks was
      significantly reduced in the zofenopril group (55 patients, 7.1 percent), as
      compared with the placebo group (83 patients, 10.6 percent); the cumulative
      reduction in the risk of death or severe congestive heart failure was 34 percent 
      (95 percent confidence interval, 8 to 54 percent; P = 0.018). The reduction in
      risk was 46 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 11 to 71 percent; P = 0.018)
      for severe congestive heart failure and 25 percent (95 percent confidence
      interval, -11 to 60 percent; P = 0.19) for death. After one year of observation, 
      the mortality rate was significantly lower in the zofenopril group (10.0 percent)
      than in the placebo group (14.1 percent); the reduction in risk was 29 percent
      (95 percent confidence interval, 6 to 51 percent; P = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS:
      Treatment with zofenopril significantly improved both short-term and long-term
      outcome when this drug was started within 24 hours after the onset of acute
      anterior myocardial infarction and continued for six weeks.

TI  - Effects of captopril on ischemic events after myocardial infarction. Results of
      the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement trial. SAVE Investigators.
PG  - 1731-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) trial, recurrent
      myocardial infarction (MI) was the most important predictor of a poor outcome and
      conferred a sevenfold increase in risk of death. The purpose of this study was to
      determine the predictors of recurrent MI in study participants and to examine the
      influence of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril on this and
      other myocardial ischemic events. METHODS AND RESULTS: The 2231 patients had
      survived the acute phase of MI (3 to 16 days) and had a radionuclide ventricular 
      ejection fraction < or = 40%. Patients were randomly assigned to receive
      double-blind treatment with either placebo or captopril and were followed for an 
      average of 42 months. The influence of captopril on recurrent MI, cardiac
      revascularization procedures, and hospitalization with unstable angina was
      examined. The likelihood of recurrent MI was greater in patients with an MI or
      functional disability before the index infarction and higher systolic pressure
      (all P < .001) but was not influenced by baseline left ventricular ejection
      fraction. Therapy with captopril reduced the risk of development of recurrent MI 
      by 25% (95% confidence intervals, 5% to 40%; P = .015) and the risk of death
      after recurrent MI by 32% (95% confidence intervals, 4% to 51%; P = .029).
      Captopril-assigned patients were also less likely to require cardiac
      revascularization procedures (P = .010), but hospitalization for unstable angina 
      was unaltered. When all three of these major coronary ischemic events were
      considered together, captopril therapy reduced the risk (14% risk reduction; 95% 
      confidence intervals, 0% to 26%; P = .047). CONCLUSIONS: In post-MI patients with
      asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, long-term administration of captopril 
      reduced recurrence of MI and the need for cardiac revascularization but had no
      influence on the rate of hospitalization with a discharge diagnosis of unstable
      angina. The finding that the recurrence of MI was independent of left ventricular
      ejection fraction suggests that captopril could be useful in preventing recurrent
      MI in patients with more preserved left ventricular function. The need for
      cardiac revascularization was reduced in patients receiving long-term captopril
      therapy, suggesting either an anti-ischemic effect or the ability of the
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor to modify the atherosclerotic process in 
      survivors of MI.

TI  - Quality of life on enalapril after acute myocardial infarction.
PG  - 1135-9
AB  - Quality of life was assessed 4-6 months after an acute myocardial infarction in a
      randomized double-blind study of enalapril versus placebo. Quality of life was
      evaluated using the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), the Physical Symptoms
      Distress Index (PSDI), the Work Performance Scale (WPS) and the Life Satisfaction
      Index (LSI). The study comprised 36 women (aged 46-85 years, mean 68) and 96
      males (aged 39-81 years, mean 62). Quality of life did not differ significantly
      between patients treated with enalapril versus placebo. The scores were
      (enalapril vs placebo, mean +/- SE): average NHP 15.4 +/- 2.3 vs 17.1 +/- 2.3;
      PSDI 9.5 +/- 1.0 vs 10.8 +/- 0.9; WPS 19.8 +/- 2.0 vs 19.4 +/- 1.4; LSI 24.1 +/- 
      1.0 vs 22.5 +/- 1.4. Men reported a better quality of life than women on most
      assessments, and non-smokers and ex-smokers better than smokers. Patients with
      moderate or severe angina pectoris had a worse quality of life measured by PSDI
      and NHP than patients with minimal or no angina pectoris. Patients with
      congestive heart failure had a higher PSDI than those without (13.6 +/- 1.7 vs
      9.4 +/- 0.7, P < 0.05), while no significant differences were observed in the NHP
      scores. In conclusion, quality of life was similar in enalapril and
      placebo-treated patients after an acute myocardial infarction. However, it was
      reduced in patients with angina pectoris or heart failure and in those who
      continued smoking.

TI  - Acute intervention with captopril during thrombolysis in patients with first
      anterior myocardial infarction. Results from the Captopril and Thrombolysis Study
      (CATS).
PG  - 898-907
AB  - The study was designed to examine the safety and efficacy of acute interventional
      use of captopril on left ventricular volumes, ventricular arrhythmias and
      neurohormones during thrombolysis in patients with a first anterior myocardial
      infarction, within 6 h of onset of symptoms. Left ventricular dysfunction and
      prognosis after myocardial infarction can be improved by angiotensin converting
      enzyme inhibition started after the ischaemic phase. Experimental evidence
      suggests that intervention during thrombolysis may lead to even further benefit. 
      In a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial, 298 patients with a first
      anterior myocardial infarction, eligible for thrombolytic therapy were treated
      with captopril 6.25 mg or placebo, started immediately upon streptokinase
      infusion and titrated to 25 mg t.i.d.. The efficacy of captopril by an
      intention-to-treat-analysis to reduce left ventricular volumes, ventricular
      arrhythmias, neurohumoral activation and enzymatic infarct size was measured.
      During dose titration, mean blood pressure and heart rate were similar in both
      groups. However, hypotension after the first dose was reported in 18 patients on 
      placebo and 31 patients on captopril (P < 0.05). At discharge, 80% of patients
      were on study medication. Left ventricular volumes were significantly increased
      in both groups at 3 months, but they tended to be lower in the captopril group;
      however, the differences were not statistically significant. The incidence of
      accelerated idioventricular rhythm and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia in
      captopril patients was lower than in placebo patients (P < 0.05), parallelled by 
      transiently lower norepinephrine levels (P < 0.05) upon thrombolysis.(ABSTRACT

TI  - Comparison of enalapril versus captopril on left ventricular function and
      survival three months after acute myocardial infarction (the "PRACTICAL" study).
PG  - 1180-6
AB  - Left ventricular (LV) function and survival can be improved with captopril when
      initiated later than 24 hours after acute myocardial infarction. Animal studies
      suggest additional benefits may be obtained with earlier initiation of
      angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The effects on LV function of
      captopril and enalapril initiated within 24 hours of myocardial infarction were
      studied. Two hundred twenty-five patients with acute myocardial infarction were
      enrolled within 24 hours of the onset of chest pain. They were randomized to
      receive either captopril 25 mg three times daily, enalapril 5 mg three times
      daily, or placebo. LV ejection fraction (EF) and volumes were measured by
      radionuclide ventriculography at baseline during treatment and at 3 months after 
      a 3-day withdrawal from therapy. The ACE inhibitor group had a significant
      increase in EF (45 +/- 1 to 47 +/- 1%; p = 0.005) and significantly attenuated LV
      dilatation compared with results in the placebo group (175 +/- 6 to 189 +/- 7 ml 
      in the placebo group vs 168 +/- 4 to 172 +/- 4 ml in the ACE inhibitor group; p =
      0.051 for LV end-diastolic volume; and 99 +/- 6 to 108 +/- 7 ml in the placebo
      group vs 94 +/- 3 to 94 +/- 4 ml; p = 0.026 for LV end-systolic volume). The
      beneficial effects of ACE inhibitor therapy on LV function were observed
      irrespective of the degree of initial LV dysfunction and were comparable in both 
      the captopril and enalapril groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - GISSI-3: effects of lisinopril and transdermal glyceryl trinitrate singly and
      together on 6-week mortality and ventricular function after acute myocardial
      infarction. Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell'infarto
      Miocardico.
PG  - 1115-22
AB  - GISSI-3 is a multicentre randomised clinical trial to assess the efficacy of
      lisinopril, transdermal glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), and their combination in
      improving survival and ventricular function after acute myocardial infarction
      (AMI). Between June, 1991, and July, 1993, 19,394 patients were randomised from
      200 coronary care units in Italy. Eligible patients presented within 24 h of
      symptom onset and had no clear indications for or against the study treatments.
      In a factorial design patients were randomly assigned 6 weeks of oral lisinopril 
      (5 mg initial dose and then 10 mg daily) or open control as well as nitrates
      (intravenous for the first 24 h followed by transdermal GTN 10 mg daily) or open 
      control. Complete clinical data and 6-week follow-up were available for 18,895
      (97.4%) patients randomised. Two-dimensional echocardiographic data were
      available for 14,209 patients. Overall 6-week mortality was 6.7%. Lisinopril,
      started within 24 h from AMI symptoms, produced significant reductions in overall
      mortality (odds ratio 0.88 [95% CI 0.79-0.99]) and in the combined outcome
      measure of mortality and severe ventricular dysfunction (0.90 [0.84-0.98]). In
      the same trial the systematic administration of transdermal GTN did not show any 
      independent effect on the same outcome measures (0.94 [0.84-1.05] and 0.94
      [0.87-1.02]). Systematic combined administration of lisinopril and GTN also
      produced significant reductions in overall mortality (0.83 [0.70-0.97]) and in
      the combined endpoint (0.85 [0.76-0.94]). The favourable effect of lisinopril
      alone or with GTN was clear also in the predefined high-risk populations (elderly
      patients and women) for the combined endpoint. These findings were obtained in a 
      population intensively exposed to recommended treatments (thrombolysis 72%,
      beta-blockade 31%, and aspirin 84%); non-protocol treatment with
      angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and nitrates was allowed for specific
      clinical indications. No excess of unfavourable clinically relevant events in the
      treated groups was reported.

TI  - Randomized controlled trial of oral captopril, of oral isosorbide mononitrate and
      of intravenous magnesium sulphate started early in acute myocardial infarction:
      safety and haemodynamic effects. ISIS-4 (Fourth International Study of Infarct
      Survival) Pilot Study Investigators.
PG  - 608-19
AB  - The purpose of this randomized controlled study was to assess the haemodynamic
      effects, safety and tolerability in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) of one
      month of oral captopril, one month of oral isosorbide mononitrate and 24 h of
      intravenous magnesium. It was carried out in four United Kingdom and six Polish
      hospitals in consecutive phases: oral captopril vs oral mononitrate vs placebo
      were compared among 400 patients in a 'three-way' study; and then oral captopril 
      vs placebo and oral mononitrate vs placebo were compared among 474 patients in '2
      x 2' and '2 x 2 x 2' factorial studies (with 208 patients in the latter study
      also randomized between intravenous magnesium and open control). The factorial
      studies differed from the three-way study in that one group of patients was
      allocated both oral captopril and oral mononitrate, a higher maintenance dose of 
      captopril was used (following the same initial dose), and once daily
      controlled-release mononitrate was used. In the three-way study, the mean of the 
      lowest systolic blood pressures recorded during the first 4 h after randomization
      were (mmHg +/- standard error): 104 +/- 2 captopril vs 105 +/- 1 mononitrate vs
      112 +/- 2 placebo (P < 0.001 for captopril or for mononitrate vs placebo), and in
      the factorial studies were 105 +/- 1 captopril vs 110 +/- 1 placebo (P < 0.01)
      and 106 +/- 1 mononitrate vs 108 +/- 1 placebo (NS). There was an excess of
      hypotension recorded among patients allocated active treatment (captopril >
      mononitrate > placebo) and there was a small, but significant, excess of
      cardiogenic shock with captopril compared with control in the factorial study.
      However, in these studies, neither captopril nor mononitrate were associated with
      any overall increase in the incidence of hypotension considered severe enough to 
      lead to treatment being stopped. No other serious complications were observed,
      and compliance with study tablets at hospital discharge was not significantly
      different between the active and placebo groups. Patients allocated magnesium in 
      the 2 x 2 x 2 factorial study had a slightly lower mean systolic blood pressure
      just after the initial 15 min bolus injection (126 +/- 2 magnesium vs 134 +/- 3
      control; P < 0.05) but there were no significant differences during the
      subsequent 24 h maintenance infusion period. Apart from some facial flushing,
      magnesium did not appear to be associated with any complications.(ABSTRACT

TI  - The Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) study: rationale and perspective.
PG  - 430-5
AB  - Myocardial infarction increases the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events
      (e.g., heart failure or another myocardial infarction) among survivors as
      compared with the general population. Left ventricular dysfunction is among the
      major risk factors for such adverse events. Although reductions in cardiovascular
      risk have been achieved by use of aspirin, beta-blockers (and sometimes
      revascularization and/or serum lipid-lowering agents), the potential of
      angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to improve the outcome for
      survivors of myocardial infarction has only recently been examined. The concept
      that ACE inhibition might be of benefit for these patients originated from animal
      studies demonstrating that long-term ACE inhibition therapy attenuated
      left-ventricular enlargement. After clinical confirmation of this initial
      finding, the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) trial was designed to
      determine whether long-term ACE inhibition therapy would reduce morbidity and
      mortality among survivors of myocardial infarction. The SAVE study found the
      following risk reductions among captopril vs placebo recipients: death (all
      causes) 19% (95% confidence interval, 3 to 35%; p = 0.019); cardiovascular death 
      21% (95% confidence interval, 5 to 35%; p = 0.014); myocardial infarction 25%
      (95% confidence interval, 5 to 40%; p = 0.012). To the list of proved therapies
      that extend survival following myocardial infarction, the physician can now add
      ACE inhibition with captopril for patients with left ventricular dysfunction.
      Survivors of myocardial infarction are at heightened risk for subsequent adverse 
      cardiovascular events.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Experiences with ACE inhibitors early after acute myocardial infarction.
      Rationale and design of the German Multicenter Study on the Effects of Captopril 
      on Cardiopulmonary Exercise parameters post myocardial infarction (ECCE).
PG  - 424-9
AB  - Left ventricular damage by necrosis of myocardial tissue can lead to compromise
      of left ventricular function, to left ventricular volume increase and ultimately 
      to development of heart failure. This sequence in the pathophysiology has been
      shown to be blunted by ACE inhibitors. Volume increase, however, can also be
      helpful in restoring stroke volume and ameliorate elevation of filling pressures.
      Furthermore, very early institution of ACE inhibition has failed to improve
      short-term mortality after myocardial infarction in one large trial. The aim of
      the ECCE trial therefore is, to investigate the early effects of the ACE
      inhibitor captopril on compromise of exercise capacity, thought to be a first
      measurable sign of developing heart failure. The ECCE trial is a randomized,
      seven-center investigation, studying the effects of ACE inhibition on oxygen
      uptake in a double blind, placebo controlled design in a group of 204 patients.
      Sample size was calculated on the basis of a pilot trial. The study design and
      first not unblinded data of 104 patients are presented. The population consists
      of predominantly male patients with mostly first myocardial infarction. They were
      admitted to hospital within five hours of onset of chest pain. End-diastolic
      volumes were normal, but ejection fraction was moderately compromised. ACE
      inhibition was started after the first day, but within 72 hours of onset of chest
      pain. After four and after twelve weeks, oxygen uptake was considerably below
      expected values and one third of the patients had severe compromise of exercise
      capacity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
