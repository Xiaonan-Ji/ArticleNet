TI  - Evaluation of a monthly coverage maximum (drug-specific quantity limit) on the
      5-HT1 agonists (triptans) and dihydroergotamine nasal spray.
PG  - 335-45
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ensuring the appropriate use of migraine therapies is an important
      consideration for care providers, patients, employers, and managed care
      organizations (MCOs) because of the high cost of treatment for this fairly
      prevalent disabling disease. A review of utilization of serotonin 5-HT1 receptor 
      agonists (triptans) in an MCO determined that about 24% of the patients who
      received triptan therapy exceeded the manufacturers. recommendations regarding
      the maximum daily dose and safe treatment guidelines in a 30-day period. An
      initiative was designed to manage the coverage of migraine abortive therapies
      with the anticipated outcome of decreasing potential misuse or overuse of the
      medications. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this retrospective, observational study 
      was to determine the impact of a monthly drug-specific milligram coverage maximum
      (quantity limit) on serotonin 5-HT1 receptor agonists (triptans) and
      dihydroergotamine (DHE) nasal spray on the utilization and costs of migraine care
      in an MCO with approximately 600000 covered members. METHODS: A longitudinal,
      retrospective cohort analysis was conducted. All migraine-related services were
      analyzed, including outpatient medical visits, emergency department utilization, 
      inpatient hospitalizations, and outpatient prescription drug use. The analysis
      was conducted using medical and pharmacy administrative claims. Analysis of data 
      was performed for the period 12 months prior (October 1999 to September 2000) and
      18 months postimplementation of the monthly drug-specific milligram coverage
      maximum (October 2000 through March 2002). RESULTS: Imposition of a monthly
      coverage maximum for migraine-abortive therapies was associated with a 26.1%
      reduction in overall per- patient-per-month (PPPM) medical costs for migraine
      care, from US dollars 55.52 PPPM to US dollars 41.02 PPPM (P<0.01). Utilization
      of serotonin 5-HT1 receptor agonists and DHE nasal spray declined by 16.7%, from 
      0.18 prescriptions PPPM to 0.15 prescriptions PPPM (P=0.039), and direct drug
      costs declined by 28.8%, from US dollars 29.18 PPPM to US dollars 20.78 PPPM
      (P<0.001). Utilization and costs of outpatient and inpatient migraine-related
      medical services declined by 40% from US dollars 16.58 PPPM in the preperiod to
      US dollars 9.94 PPPM in the postperiod (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: A monthly
      drug-specific milligram coverage maximum was associated with significant
      reduction in drug costs and utilization of serotonin 5-HT1 receptor agonists
      (triptans) and DHE nasal spray. Utilization and costs of migraine-related medical
      services also declined after implementation of the coverage maximum for triptans 
      and DHE nasal spray. The monthly drug-specific milligram coverage maximum
      appeared to have been successful in managing utilization of triptans and DHE
      nasal spray, including reduction of overall costs of migraine-related medical
      services and direct drug costs.

TI  - Meta-analysis of oral triptan therapy for migraine: number needed to treat and
      relative cost to achieve relief within 2 hours.
PG  - 45-52
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of the 5-HT1B/1D agonists, or
      triptans, in the acute treatment of migraine. METHODS: To determine the
      cost-effectiveness of the triptans, a meta-analysis was conducted of the efficacy
      data from 27 oral triptan trials, using the endpoint of "pain-free" status within
      2 hours after initial dosing as the indicator of efficacy. Efficacy data were
      used to determine the number needed to treat (NNT) to achieve pain-free status in
      1 patient within 2 hours postdose and then applied the per-dose costs for each
      triptan to the NNT values. RESULTS: Rizatriptan 10 mg and almotriptan 12.5 mg
      were the most cost-effective of the triptans, costing $48.34 and $48.57 US
      dollars, respectively, to achieve pain-free status in 1 patient within 2 hours
      postdose. Frovatriptan 2.5 mg was the most costly, with a cost-effective ratio of
      $162.49 US dollars. All other triptans fell between these extremes: zolmitriptan 
      5 mg ($65.18 US dollars), sumatriptan 100 mg ($70.83 US dollars), sumatriptan 50 
      mg ($75.67 US dollars), zolmitriptan 2.5 mg ($78.74 US dollars), and naratriptan 
      2.5 mg ($141.43 US dollars), in decreasing order of cost-effectiveness.
      CONCLUSION: Using an NNT analysis, the least-costly drugs to achieve migraine
      cure within 2 hours are rizatriptan 10 mg and almotriptan 12.5 mg. From a
      population health perspective, the lower acquisition cost of almotriptan 12.5 mg 
      allows for effective treatment of more patients than rizatriptan 10 mg for no
      additional medication cost.

AB  - Despite the "black box" surrounding CVS, the authors' understanding of this
      clinical entity has advanced substantially in the last decade as a result of an
      international interdisciplinary clinical and research effort. Although CVS is now
      recognized as a unique clinical entity, patients still undergo innumerable
      hospitalizations and diagnostic tests. Although controlled therapeutic studies
      are lacking, reasonably effective empiric approaches have been developed by trial
      and error using anti-migraine, anti-emetic, and anti-epileptic regimens. The
      ongoing investigations of migraine mechanisms through NMR spectroscopy,
      mitochondrial DNA mutations and cellular energetics, corticotropin-releasing
      factor and gastric motility, and brainstem regulation of autonomic function may
      lead to breakthroughs in the understanding of and new therapies for CVS in the
      next decade.

TI  - Pain-free efficacy after treatment with sumatriptan in the mild pain phase of
      menstrually associated migraine.
PG  - 835-42
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the efficacy of sumatriptan 50-mg and 100-mg tablets in
      menstrually associated migraine when treatment is administered during the mild
      pain phase. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      single-attack study was conducted. Menstrually associated migraine was defined as
      any migraine beginning on or between day -2 and day 4, with day 1 = first day of 
      flow. Patients had at least a 1-year history of migraine as defined by
      International Headache Society criteria and reported regularly occurring
      menstrually associated migraines typically having a mild pain phase. Patients
      treated attacks within 1 hour of the onset of pain but only if the pain was mild 
      at onset and while the pain was still mild. RESULTS: In the 349 women with
      menstrually associated migraine, sumatriptan was significantly more effective
      than placebo: 61% and 51% of patients who used sumatriptan 100 mg and 50 mg,
      respectively, were pain-free 2 hours after treatment compared with 29% of
      patients who used placebo (P <.001 for both comparisons). At 2 hours, 51% and 45%
      of patients who used sumatriptan 100 mg and 50 mg were free of pain and
      associated symptoms (photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, vomiting) compared with
      25% of placebo patients (P <.001 for both comparisons). Adverse events were low
      for sumatriptan 100 and 50 mg, and both doses were generally well tolerated.
      CONCLUSION: Sumatriptan 50-mg and 100-mg tablets are generally well tolerated and
      effective in providing pain-free relief and relief of the associated symptoms of 
      menstrually associated migraine when administered in the mild pain phase.

      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies.
PG  - 1214-22
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of sumatriptan, 50-mg and
      100-mg tablets, compared with placebo for treatment of migraine at the first sign
      of pain. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two identical multicenter randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-attack studies were conducted from May
      through November 2000 in adults (aged 18-65 years). Patients treated migraine at 
      the first sign of pain, while pain was mild, but not more than 2 hours after
      onset with oral sumatriptan, 50 mg or 100 mg, or matching placebo. The primary
      end point was pain-free relief at 2 hours after treatment with 50 mg of
      sumatriptan compared with placebo. RESULTS: There were 354 patients in study 1
      and 337 patients in study 2. Significantly more patients treated with
      sumatriptan, 50 mg and 100 mg, were completely free from pain 2 and 4 hours after
      treatment vs patients treated with placebo (at 2 hours, 50% and 57% vs 29%; at 4 
      hours, 61% and 68% vs 30%; for both, P < .001). Also, significantly more patients
      treated with sumatriptan, 50 mg and 100 mg, were migraine-free (no pain or
      associated symptoms) vs those treated with placebo at 2 and 4 hours after
      treatment (at 2 hours, 43% and 49% vs 24%; at 4 hours, 54% and 63% vs 28%; for
      both, P < .001). The incidence of overall adverse events was low with the 50- and
      100-mg dose of sumatriptan (placebo, 7%; sumatriptan at 50 mg, 14%; sumatriptan
      at 100 mg, 16%). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of migraine at the first sign of pain
      with sumatriptan, 50-mg and 100-mg tablets, provides superior pain-free relief at
      2 and 4 hours after treatment compared with placebo. Results of these studies
      suggest that sumatriptan at 100 mg may be more efficacious than at 50 mg when
      used in the early treatment paradigm. Because these studies were not powered to
      detect statistical differences between active doses, studies to investigate this 
      finding are warranted.

TI  - Patients with migraine prefer zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablet to
      sumatriptan conventional oral tablet.
PG  - 573-6
AB  - The Zolmitriptan Evaluation versus Sumatriptan Trial (ZEST) assessed patient
      preference for 2.5 mg zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) or 50 mg
      sumatriptan conventional tablet in 218 patients with significant migraine
      disability. Significantly more patients preferred zolmitriptan ODT to sumatriptan
      conventional tablet (60.1% vs 39.9%; p = 0.0130). In terms of efficacy,
      significantly more patients considered zolmitriptan ODT to be an effective
      migraine treatment than sumatriptan conventional tablet (77% vs 63%; p = 0.0063).
      When asked about specific formulation attributes, significantly more patients
      selected zolmitriptan ODT as the least disruptive therapy (83.6% vs 16.4%), the
      easiest to take (85.5% vs 14.5%), the most convenient to take (86.1% vs 13.9%),
      and the one which enabled them to maintain an active lifestyle (65.5% vs 34.5%), 
      compared with the sumatriptan conventional tablet (all comparisons p < 0.001).
      Zolmitriptan ODT is a convenient and beneficial alternative to conventional
      tablets and is preferred to sumatriptan conventional tablets by migraineurs.

TI  - Central nervous system abnormalities in migraine.
PG  - 1709-15
AB  - Migraine is associated with structural and functional CNS changes, for example,
      ictal hyperalgesia and allodynia and interictal neural excitation. Structural
      abnormalities, most notably white matter changes, occur in greater prevalence in 
      migraineurs (16 - 40%). Several studies have examined the neuropsychological
      correlates of migraine and/or white matter abnormalities. These studies suggest
      mild, interictal dysfunction in migraineurs. More research is needed to correlate
      migraine severity, frequency and/or treatment with neuropsychological testing.
      Additional studies should: identify interictal cognitive changes; clarify the
      contribution to long-term cognitive changes from migraine genotype, sequelae of
      repeated pain episodes or their treatment and the consequences of co-morbid
      vascular disease; and include cognitive measures as secondary end points in
      clinical trials.

TI  - The effects of exercise and exercise-related changes in blood nitric oxide level 
      on migraine headache.
PG  - 624-30
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of moderate aerobic exercise on migraine
      headache, to assess exercise-related changes in blood nitric oxide (NO) levels,
      and to examine the impact of such changes on migraine attacks. DESIGN: Controlled
      clinical trial. SETTING: School of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation. SUBJECTS:
      Forty women with general migraine attending the Neurology Department of the
      Faculty of Medicine Faculty of Dokuz Eylul University. INTERVENTION: Patients
      were assigned alternately into two groups: exercise group undertaking 1 hour
      aerobic exercise three times weekly, and a control group. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 
      Patients were assessed before and after treatment using three clinical
      scales--visual analogue scale for headache, Pain Disability Index and Quality of 
      Life Scale--and chemiluminescence analysis for plasma nitric oxide. RESULTS:
      After the eight-week therapy period, patient complaints concerning the intensity,
      frequency and duration of pain had decreased significantly in both groups;
      however, visual analogue scale scoring showed better pain relief in the exercised
      group than in the controls (from 8.8 +/- 1.7 to 4.0 +/- 1.4 and from 8.5 +/- 0.8 
      to 7.0 +/- 0.9 respectively). Quality of life measures also revealed better
      migraine relief in the exercised women than in those who received medical
      treatment only. Blood NO rose significantly from pre- to post-therapy in the
      exercised group, but the change was not significant in the control group.
      CONCLUSION: The study showed that regular long-term aerobic exercise reduced
      migraine pain severity, frequency and duration possibly due to increased nitric
      oxide production.

TI  - Migraine treatment patterns and patient satisfaction with prior therapy: a
      substudy of a multicenter trial of rizatriptan effectiveness.
PG  - 2053-69
AB  - BACKGROUND: Migraine is a common, chronic, often disabling neurologic condition
      that is underdiagnosed and undertreated. OBJECTIVE: We undertook this
      questionnaire-based study as a substudy of a multicenter trial of rizatriptan
      effectiveness. Our goal was to assess the history of acute migraine medication
      use and the relationship between different migraine medication regimens and
      patient satisfaction with prior therapy. METHODS: This study was conducted at 85 
      neurology clinics throughout Spain from March Lo December 2001. It was planned
      prospectively as part of the screening visit for a multicenter trial of the
      effectiveness of rizatriptan therapy for migraine. Male and female patients >/=18
      years of age were eligible for the primary trial, and hence for this study, if
      they had a history of migraine attacks and did not have a contraindication for
      triptan use. At the screening visit for the primary trial, a questionnaire was
      used by clinicians to record past and current use, and duration and order of use,
      of analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), ergot derivatives, 
      and triptans; satisfaction with treatment was scored on a 5-point scale ranging
      from "very dissatisfied" to "very satisfied." RESULTS: Of 712 patients completing
      the questionnaire (mean [SD] age, 34 [10] years; range, 18-69 years), 75% were
      women and 94% experienced moderate or severe functional disability during
      migraine attacks. Analgesics were used by the majority of patients (81%) and for 
      the longest mean [SD] duration (8.8 [7.6] years) but were associated with the
      least satisfaction (10% of patients "very satisfied" or "somewhat satisfied").
      Triptans were used by the fewest patients (32%) and for the shortest mean
      duration (18 [1.6] years) but were associated with the highest rate of
      satisfaction (66%) compared with NSAIDs (27%) and ergot derivatives (31%).
      Regardless of duration or order of drug use, or sex or age of the patient, the
      likelihood of satisfaction with triptans was significantly greater (P < 0.001)
      than with nontriptan regimens, with an adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) of 16.8
      (11.4-24.9) versus analgesics, 5.1 (3.6-7.1) versus NSAIDs, and 4.1 (2.8-6.0)
      versus ergot derivatives. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that analgesics,
      NSAIDs, and ergot derivatives were used for long durations but provided low
      satisfaction among patients. Triptans were rarely used as a first treatment
      choice; however, patients reported the highest treatment satisfaction scores
      after triptan therapy compared with ergot derivatives, NSAIDs, or analgesics.

TI  - Tolerability and consistency of effect of zolmitriptan nasal spray in a long-term
      migraine treatment trial.
PG  - 839-51
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To primarily assess the tolerability of zolmitriptan (Zomig) nasal
      spray 5mg in the long-term treatment of migraine, as well as determine efficacy
      and consistency of effect over time (up to 1 year). METHODS: This randomised,
      double-blind-to-dose, parallel-group, multicentre study was designed as a
      two-phase, crossover trial with a total duration of 1 year. In the pre-crossover 
      phase, 1,093 patients aged 18-65 years with an established diagnosis of migraine 
      with or without aura received intranasal zolmitriptan 5, 2.5, 1 or 0.5mg for the 
      treatment of mild, moderate or severe migraine attacks. When a headache persisted
      or recurred, a second dose of zolmitriptan nasal spray (or other approved escape 
      medication) was permitted 2 hours post-administration but no later than 24 hours 
      after the first dose. In the post-crossover phase, once a placebo-controlled,
      dose-finding study had established 5mg as the dose with the optimal clinical
      utility, all patients were crossed over under blinded conditions to receive this 
      dose. As this was primarily a safety study, the primary endpoints for the study
      were the incidence and nature of all serious adverse events (at any time before
      or after administration) and nonserious adverse events (within 24 hours of
      administration), as well as the incidence of clinically significant abnormalities
      in either ECG or haematology and clinical chemistry parameters. Nose and throat
      examinations were performed before and after the study at 30 predetermined trial 
      centres. Other endpoint measures included headache response rate, pain-free
      assessments, reduction in headache intensity, time to resumption of normal
      activities and consistency of headache response. Efficacy rates were measured in 
      90-day intervals up to a period of 360 days. RESULTS: Zolmitriptan nasal spray
      5mg was well tolerated, with only 1.9% of patients withdrawing from the 12-month 
      long-term trial because of adverse events. Adverse events occurred in 22.1% of
      attacks treated with zolmitriptan nasal spray 5mg, and the majority were of short
      duration and mild or moderate intensity. Serious adverse events occurred in 0.2% 
      of attacks treated with zolmitriptan nasal spray 5mg. There was no evidence of
      increased incidence of adverse events with increasing duration of treatment.
      Nasopharyngeal adverse events were reported in 5.5% of attacks treated with
      zolmitriptan nasal spray 5mg. Again, events were generally transient and of mild 
      intensity. For the 1,093 patients who treated 13,806 attacks during the
      pre-crossover phase, headache response rates at 2 hours over all attacks were
      73.2%, 70.5%, 49.9% and 41.5% for zolmitriptan nasal spray 5, 2.5, 1 and 0.5mg,
      respectively. Pain-free rates at 2 hours over all attacks were 51.5%, 48.1%,
      24.7% and 21.8%, respectively. For the 783 patients receiving the 5mg dose in
      either the pre- or post-crossover phases, the 2-hour headache response rates were
      72.9%, 74.4%, 74.6% and 74.1% for the four 90-day periods between day 0 and day
      360. Normal activities were resumed within 2 hours in 60.4% of attacks. Long-term
      usage of zolmitriptan nasal spray 5mg was also associated with a consistently
      effective response, with 57.8% of patients experiencing a 2-hour headache
      response in over 75% of attacks. The majority of patients (70.3%) rated their
      overall satisfaction with zolmitriptan nasal spray 5mg as good or excellent.
      CONCLUSION: Zolmitriptan nasal spray 5mg provides good tolerability and efficacy 
      in long-term use in a clinical setting, with consistently high 2-hour headache
      and pain-free rates. This combination of benefits translates to high patient
      satisfaction with this formulation of zolmitriptan.

TI  - Establishing principles for migraine management in primary care.
PG  - 493-507
AB  - Published guidelines for the management of migraine in primary care were
      evaluated by an international advisory board of headache specialists, to
      establish evidence-based principles of migraine management that could be
      recommended for international use. Twelve principles of migraine management were 
      identified, covering screening, diagnosis, management and treatments: Almost all 
      headaches are benign/primary and can be managed by all practising clinicians. Use
      questions/a questionnaire to assess the impact on daily living and everyday
      activities, for diagnostic screening and to aid management decisions. Share
      migraine management between the clinician and the patient. Provide individualised
      care for migraine and encourage patients to manage their migraine. Follow up
      patients, preferably with migraine calendars or diaries. Regularly re-evaluate
      the success of therapy using specific outcome measures and monitor the use of
      acute and prophylactic medications regularly. Adapt migraine management to
      changes that occur in the illness and its presentation over the years. Provide
      acute medication to all migraine patients and recommend it is taken at the
      appropriate time, during the attack. Provide rescue medication/symptomatic
      treatment for when the initial therapy fails. Offer to prescribe prophylactic
      medications, as well as lifestyle changes, to patients who have four or more
      migraine attacks per month or who are resistant to acute medications. Consider
      concurrent co-morbidities in the choice of appropriate prophylactic medication.
      Work with the patient to achieve comfort with mutually agreed upon treatment and 
      ensure that it is practical for their lifestyle and headache presentation. Using 
      these principles, practising clinicians can screen and diagnose their headache
      patients effectively and manage their migraine patients over the long-term
      natural history of the migraine process. In this way, the majority of migraine
      patients can be well treated in primary care, ensuring a structured and
      individualised approach to headache management, and conserving valuable
      healthcare resources.

TI  - Assessment of meal induced gastric accommodation by a satiety drinking test in
      health and in severe functional dyspepsia.
PG  - 1271-7
AB  - AIMS: Impaired gastric accommodation is a major pathophysiological mechanism in
      functional dyspepsia. The aim of the present work was to assess a satiety
      drinking test in the evaluation of accommodation in health and dyspepsia.
      METHODS: Twenty five controls and 37 severely dyspeptic patients seen at a
      tertiary care centre completed a dyspepsia questionnaire, and gastric emptying
      and gastric barostat studies. The amount of liquid meal ingested at maximum
      satiety during a slow satiety drinking test was determined. In controls, we
      studied the influence of caloric density and of pharmacological agents that
      influence accommodation. RESULTS: In patients, satiety scores were higher and
      maximum satiety occurred at lower calories (542 (50) v 1508 (53) kcal; p<0.0001).
      Six patients had required nutritional support, but excluding these did not alter 
      the correlations. With increasing severity of early satiety, less calories were
      ingested at maximum satiety. In multivariate analysis, the amount of calories was
      significantly correlated to accommodation but not to gastric emptying or
      sensitivity. Sensitivity and specificity of the satiety test in predicting
      impaired accommodation reached 92% and 86%, respectively. At different caloric
      densities, ingested volume rather than caloric load determined maximum satiety.
      Pharmacological agents (sumatriptan, cisapride, erythromycin) affected the
      satiety test according to their effect on accommodation. CONCLUSION: A slow
      caloric drinking test can be used to evaluate accommodation and early satiety. It
      provides a non-invasive method of predicting impaired accommodation and
      quantifying pharmacological influences on accommodation.

TI  - Almotriptan versus rizatriptan in patients with migraine in Spain.
PG  - 734-41
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare patient-reported use of rizatriptan 10 mg with that of
      almotriptan 12.5 mg per migraine attack (24 hours) in a Spanish population.
      METHODS: One hundred twenty Spanish community pharmacies recruited patients with 
      migraine to whom they had dispensed almotriptan and rizatriptan. No other
      selection criteria were used. Patients kept diaries for baseline pain intensity, 
      the number of triptan tablets used, additional medication taken per attack, and
      their degree of satisfaction with the medication 2 hours after the initial dose. 
      Patients recorded details for a maximum of 3 attacks. Analysis of variance or the
      Student t test and chi-squared or Fisher exact tests were used for univariate
      comparisons. A generalized estimating equation method was used to correct for
      within-subject variability. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence
      intervals (CIs) were calculated. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-six patients (85%
      women) recorded data for 318 migraine attacks. Rizatriptan was used to treat 122 
      attacks, almotriptan was used to treat 110 attacks, and a nontriptan medication
      was used in the initial treatment of 86 attacks. Triptan use (adjusted mean, 95% 
      CI) per attack in this study was lower for rizatriptan (1.19 tablets; 95% CI,
      1.06 to 1.32) than for almotriptan (1.43 tablets; 95% CI, 1.30 to 1.56; P=.003). 
      The use of a triptan and additional medication per attack increased with baseline
      pain severity. Rizatriptan was used to treat more attacks with only one tablet
      (78%) than almotriptan (58%). Treatment of attacks with almotriptan was more than
      twice as likely to involve the use of more than one tablet per attack (24 hours) 
      than those treated with rizatriptan (adjusted OR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.37 to 4.30;
      P=.003). Patient satisfaction with treatment response at 2 hours was more than
      2-fold greater for rizatriptan (85%) than for almotriptan (68%) (adjusted OR,
      2.55; 95% CI, 1.11 to 5.87; P=.03). CONCLUSIONS: In this prescription-selected
      Spanish population, a significantly lower number of rizatriptan tablets were
      required to treat migraine attacks compared with almotriptan. Further, patients
      were more than twice as likely to use more than one tablet or additional
      medication (or both) for attacks treated with almotriptan than for those treated 
      with rizatriptan. Although these data suggest that rizatriptan may be a more
      effective treatment for migraine than almotriptan, further randomized studies are
      required to confirm this conclusion.

TI  - Sumatriptan plus metoclopramide in triptan-nonresponsive migraineurs.
PG  - 729-33
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the effectiveness of combination treatment using
      sumatriptan plus metoclopramide versus sumatriptan alone for the treatment of
      acute migraine. The patients who were treated had failed to respond to triptans
      in the past despite adequate doses on at least 2 separate trials of the same
      triptan or 2 trials involving different triptans. BACKGROUND: There is limited
      evidence that dopaminergic antagonists may benefit the migraineur by relieving
      migraine pain and associated symptoms. The exact mechanism of action in migraine 
      is unknown. The postulated action is the inhibition of dopaminergic overactivity.
      A dopaminergic antagonist, metoclopramide, may improve the efficacy of a
      5-HT1B/1D agonist, sumatriptan. METHODS: In this double-blind, randomized,
      crossover study, 16 adult migraineurs fulfilling International Headache Society
      (IHS) criteria for migraine with or without aura who had failed to receive
      adequate relief from triptans treated one migraine with each treatment:
      sumatriptan 50 mg plus metoclopramide 10 mg or sumatriptan 50 mg plus placebo to 
      match metoclopramide. Patients treated their migraines when they were moderate or
      severe in intensity and recorded pain severity and symptoms prior to treatment
      and 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes and 24 hours after treatment. RESULTS: Thirteen
      women and 3 men (mean age, 40 years) completed the study; ie, treated 2 migraines
      (a total of 32 migraines), one attack with each treatment. Meaningful relief was 
      attained in 10 (63%) of 16 migraines treated with the combination of sumatriptan 
      50 mg plus metoclopramide 10 mg compared with 5 (31%) of 16 migraines treated
      with sumatriptan 50 mg plus placebo. Headache response (moderate or severe to
      mild or no pain at 2 hours) was achieved in 7 (44%) of 16 migraines with the
      combination of sumatriptan 50 mg plus metoclopramide 10 mg compared with 5 (31%) 
      of 16 migraines treated with sumatriptan 50 mg plus placebo. There did not appear
      to be a difference between treatment groups with respect to associated symptoms. 
      The combination of sumatriptan 50 mg plus metoclopramide 10 mg was well
      tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Combining sumatriptan with metoclopramide provided relief
      in some migraineurs who failed to achieve adequate relief with a triptan alone.
      It remains unknown whether initiating therapy when pain was mild or using a
      higher dose of sumatriptan (ie, 100 mg) would have provided additional benefit.
      Further studies are indicated.

TI  - Management of menstrual migraine.
PG  - 207-13
AB  - BACKGROUND: Migraine is more prevalent in women than men. Hormonal changes can
      influence the occurrence of migraine, particularly related to the menstrual
      cycle. Menstrual migraine may require both acute and preventive treatment. REVIEW
      SUMMARY: Gender differences in migraine may be a result of variations in the
      central nervous system of men and women as well as the effects of estrogen.
      Migraine attacks occurring in the perimenstrual period respond well to acute
      treatment with triptans. Hormonal manipulation may reduce migraine occurrence,
      especially when related to hormonal fluctuations in the perimenstrual period.
      CONCLUSIONS: Effective migraine management requires an understanding of the
      unique epidemiologic and pathophysiological factors affecting women. An
      understanding of associated hormonal influences facilitates development of
      individualized treatment plans.

TI  - Coprescription of triptans with potentially interacting medications: a cohort
      study involving 240,268 patients.
PG  - 44-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little information exists about the actual prescription of triptans
      within large, geographically diverse populations, in terms of demographic
      characteristics and co-prescriptions with other medications with potential
      interactions. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the demographic characteristics
      associated with triptan use, and examine the rate of co-prescription of triptans 
      with specified pharmacologic agents with the potential for drug interactions.
      METHODS: This study examined the rate of co-prescription of triptans available in
      the US up to May 2001 (sumatriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, and zolmitriptan)
      with specified agents with potential for drug interactions. A cohort of 240,268
      patients receiving pharmacy benefits from Merck-Medco (N = 65 + M) was followed
      over a one-year period. This analysis included patients who received at least two
      triptan prescriptions during the study (6/00-5/01). Ninety-one percent of the
      cohort remained on the same triptan during the study period. 'Co-prescription'
      was defined as any fill for a medication that was contraindicated or could
      potentially adversely interact with a triptan, obtained between and during the
      first and last triptan fills throughout the study period. RESULTS: Mean patient
      age was 43 (SD +/- 11.6) and 82% were female. Twenty-one percent were
      co-prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, reflecting the
      considerable co-morbidity of migraine and depression. Patients taking triptans
      were almost never co-prescribed monoamine oxidase inhibitors (0.02%), and
      co-prescription of ergots was also low (1.45%). Less than one percent (0.45%)
      received cimetidine while taking zolmitriptan, while 2.7% of patients taking
      rizatriptan 10 mg also took propranolol. While agents unavailable in the U.S.
      were not evaluated in this cohort, six percent of patients were treated with
      potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors, which would not be expected to cause any problems with
      the triptans in the survey. However, such agents are specifically contraindicated
      for use with one triptan (eletriptan), recently launched in the EU, suggesting
      that continued vigilance will be necessary to avoid coprescription of medicines
      with the potential for producing adverse side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Triptan use
      mirrors migraine demographics. The frequency of co-prescription of triptans with 
      SSRIs is about 20%. Continued vigilance will be necessary to avoid
      co-prescription of medicines with the potential for producing adverse drug
      events.

TI  - Migraine prevalence and treatment patterns: the global Migraine and Zolmitriptan 
      Evaluation survey.
PG  - 19-26
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objectives of the Migraine And Zolmitriptan Evaluation (MAZE)
      survey were to assess the prevalence of migraine in the general population across
      5 different countries, to understand migraineurs' experience of migraine and its 
      management on a global level, and to assess patient perceptions and preferences
      of current and future treatment formulations. METHODS: A two-phase, international
      survey was performed in France, Germany, Italy, the UK, and the USA, and involved
      a total of 5553 adults. In Phase I, >/=1000 adults from the general population in
      each country were interviewed by telephone using a routine consumer survey. The
      proportion of subjects meeting International Headache Society (IHS) criteria for 
      migraine was assessed using an adapted Kiel headache questionnaire, whereas the
      impact of migraine on daily life was assessed using the Migraine Disability
      Assessment Scale (MIDAS) questionnaire. In Phase II, >/=100 clinically diagnosed 
      migraineurs per country were recruited through their general practitioners and
      migraine clinics. Semi-structured interviews based on written questionnaires
      assessed the impact of, and attitudes toward, migraine and its treatments.
      Respondents also completed the MIDAS questionnaire. Patients also sampled a
      demonstrator version of the new orange-flavored orally disintegrating tablet of
      zolmitriptan. RESULTS: Phase I: An estimated 5% to 12% of the population in the
      different countries were classified as suffering from migraine, with most attacks
      categorized as fairly severe to very severe. Between 23% and 42% of migraineurs
      reported>24 attacks in the previous 12 months. Approximately one-half of all
      migraineurs did not seek medical advice. Of those who did consult a physician,
      only 3% to 19% were prescribed triptans. In all countries, the most commonly used
      current treatment was simple analgesics (22% to 54%). Phase II: Current migraine 
      therapy was consistently effective in only 19% to 31% of patients, and only 21%
      to 50% of patients were satisfied with their current treatment. Many sufferers
      supplemented their prescription therapy with alternative management strategies,
      including herbal and homeopathic remedies, stress management, relaxation therapy,
      avoidance of trigger factors, and bed rest. Patients indicated that the most
      important attributes of migraine therapies are high efficacy and rapid pain
      relief. When asked to identify delivery options that they would like to see more 
      of in the future, most patients (73%) specified "a dissolve-in-the-mouth tablet."
      Ninety percent of patients who sampled the demonstrator version of the
      zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablet considered it to be "very easy" to use,
      and 99% stated it was suitable for use "anytime/anywhere." CONCLUSIONS: In the
      general population samples we surveyed, there was a 5% to 12% prevalence of
      migraine across 5 different countries. As reported from previous epidemiologic
      studies, we found that many migraineurs still do not consult a physician. Despite
      high levels of disability, as assessed by MIDAS scores and evidenced by the need 
      for bed rest during attacks, many migraineurs continue to treat their headaches
      with simple analgesics, which, if ineffective, leads to dissatisfaction with
      treatment. Patients desire a medication with high efficacy and a rapid onset of
      action, and an orally disintegrating tablet such as that used for the new
      zolmitriptan formulation, is a favored formulation and route of administration.

TI  - A cost-effectiveness analysis of eletriptan 40 and 80 mg versus sumatriptan 50
      and 100 mg in the acute treatment of migraine.
PG  - 438-47
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This article explores the application of cost-effectiveness analysis 
      in a comparison of eletriptan and sumatriptan in the acute treatment of migraine.
      METHODS: The study employs data from a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled clinical trial comparison of oral eletriptan (40 and 80 mg)
      and oral sumatriptan (50 and 100 mg). Analyses were undertaken using two
      composite measures of treatment outcome constructed to reflect the requirements
      of patients more comprehensively than the conventional efficacy indicator of
      headache response at 2 hours. On the cost side of the equation, reflecting the
      health-care system perspective of the analysis, drug costs for initial dosing,
      second dosing for nonresponse, and recurrence and rescue medication were taken
      into account. RESULTS: The analysis found that eletriptan treatment resulted in
      lower costs per successfully treated attack than those of sumatriptan under both 
      outcome criteria. CONCLUSION: Further refinement of outcomes measurement in
      migraine would be valuable and eletriptan has a potentially important role to
      play in the cost-effective management of the disorder.

TI  - The evolving management of migraine.
PG  - 341-5
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review recent advances in acute and preventive migraine
      treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: The number of migraine drugs continues to expand,
      allowing for more flexible and tolerable treatment plans. Two new triptans,
      frovatriptan and eletriptan, and a nasal formulation of zolmitriptan have been
      recently developed. Eletriptan is effective for acute migraine treatment and may 
      have some pharmacologic and clinical advantages. Frovatriptan has a longer
      half-life and lower headache recurrence rates compared with other triptans. It
      may be useful for patients who have prolonged attacks and high headache
      recurrence rate. Zolmitriptan nasal spray has a rapid onset of action and high
      efficacy. It should be considered when patients have rapid-onset attacks,
      especially when associated with severe nausea or vomiting. The butyrophenone
      neuroleptic droperidol is very effective in aborting acute migraine attacks.
      Central nervous system side effects are common, however, and the ECG should be
      monitored. Botulinum toxin type A shows promise as a safe, tolerable and
      effective drug for migraine prevention, with the unique advantages of almost no
      systemic adverse events and a long interval between treatments. The
      anticonvulsant topiramate is effective for migraine prevention. Cognitive side
      effects are of less concern with the lower doses needed for migraine. The
      angiotensin converting enzyme receptor blocker candesartan appears to be
      effective and highly tolerable in the prevention of migraine, but needs to be
      further evaluated. SUMMARY: New drugs expand the spectrum of migraine treatment
      both for the acute attack and for prevention.

TI  - Update on cluster headache.
PG  - 333-40
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Although cluster headache has traditionally been thought of as
      a vascular headache disorder, its periodicity suggests an involvement of central 
      areas such as the hypothalamus. This review covers the past 3 years, which have
      seen remarkable progress in understanding the pathophysiology of circadian
      headache syndromes and have brought exciting news. RECENT FINDINGS: As more
      cluster headache patients are seen by headache specialists, new forms of this
      well-defined primary headache syndrome are being identified. In addition, we
      discuss recent findings with regard to abnormalities in the secretion of
      hormones, genetic influences, neuroimaging of cluster headache attacks, and the
      use of newer substances as preventive therapy in cluster headache. SUMMARY: We
      have entered a new diagnostic and therapeutic era in primary headache disorders. 
      In recent reports, the use of deep brain stimulation of the hypothalamus has
      enabled intractable chronic cluster headache patients to be successfully operated
      upon. Further research in this field is urgently needed and the recent
      possibility of combining deep brain stimulation with positron emission tomography
      will certainly help to unravel the brain circuitry implicated in
      stimulation-produced analgesia. The time has come to use the evidence for a
      disorder of circadian rhythm in cluster headache to further the development of
      chronobiotics in the treatment of this disorder.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan nasal spray in adolescents.
PG  - 721-6
AB  - Sumatriptan is a potent and selective vascular 5-HT1 receptor agonist effective
      for the treatment of migraine. In adults, intranasal sumatriptan is well absorbed
      and tolerated. The authors evaluated the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of a
      single dose of 20 mg intranasal sumatriptan in healthy adolescent migraineurs
      ages 12 to 17 years, administered outside of migraine attack. Serum sumatriptan
      levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with
      electrochemical detection in serial samples collected over 8 hours. Physical
      exam, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, and electrocardiogram measurements 
      were monitored to assess safety and tolerability. A total of 16 subjects (10
      males and 6 females) had pharmacokinetic data that could be analyzed, 2 withdrew 
      from the study 30 and 60 minutes after dosing following the loss of venous access
      for blood sampling, and a bioanalysis failure resulted in loss of data from 3
      subjects. Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic parameters (geometric mean and 95%
      confidence interval) for the remaining 16 subjects were as follows: Cmax was 13.9
      (11.0, 17.6) ng/mL, AUC infinity was 57.3 (47.6, 69.0) ng/mL.h, and t1/2 was 2.0 
      (1.8, 2.3) hours. Population pharmacokinetic analysis for all subjects (n = 21)
      showed that clearance and volume of distribution increase slightly with age and
      body size, but the changes were minimal and would not warrant dose adjustment:
      CL/F was 316 L (coefficient of variance [CV] = 25%) and Vd/F was 1070 L (CV =
      46%). Sumatriptan was well tolerated with only minor adverse events reported,
      which all resolved spontaneously. The pharmacokinetic parameters in these
      adolescent subjects were similar to those previously reported in adults,
      suggesting that adolescents should be dosed similar to adults.

TI  - A review of the clinical efficacy and tolerability of almotriptan in acute
      migraine.
PG  - 1157-63
AB  - Almotriptan is a serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5HT)(1B/1D)-receptor agonist
      approved for the acute treatment of migraine. In 3500 acute migraine patients
      enrolled in short-term trials and 1500 patients in long-term open-label trials,
      almotriptan 12.5 mg was effective and well-tolerated. Almotriptan maintains a
      consistency of response across three attacks and patients continue to respond to 
      almotriptan for up to 1 year. Results from two comparative studies and a
      meta-analysis of 53 randomised, placebo-controlled studies of oral triptans in > 
      24,000 patients, confirm that almotriptan 12.5 mg demonstrates comparable
      efficacy with sumatriptan 50 and 100 mg. The incidence of treatment-related
      adverse events with almotriptan is comparable to that of placebo and
      significantly lower than that with sumatriptan. Drug-drug interaction studies
      indicate that almotriptan may be coadministered with other commonly prescribed
      drugs without dose modification. Almotriptan can be recommended as first-line
      treatment for acute migraine.

TI  - Speed of onset and efficacy of zolmitriptan nasal spray in the acute treatment of
      migraine: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study
      versus zolmitriptan tablet.
PG  - 653-67
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Zolmitriptan oral tablet is highly effective and well tolerated in the
      acute treatment of migraine with and without aura in adults. A nasal spray
      formulation has now been developed. The objective of this study was to compare
      the efficacy and tolerability of fixed doses of zolmitriptan administered via a
      nasal spray with placebo and zolmitriptan oral tablet in the acute treatment of
      migraine. PATIENTS AND STUDY DESIGN: This was a randomised, double-blind,
      double-dummy, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre, dose-ranging
      study. 1547 patients aged 18-65 years with an established diagnosis of migraine
      with or without aura (as defined by International Headache Society criteria) who 
      had at least a 1-year history of migraine and an age of onset <50 years were
      included. Patients were able to distinguish typical migraine from nonmigraine
      headaches and had experienced an average of one to six migraine headaches per
      month during the 2 months preceding the study. Patients were randomised to
      zolmitriptan (Zomig) The use of tradenames is for product identification purposes
      only and does not imply endorsement.) nasal spray (5.0, 2.5, 1.0 or 0.5 mg),
      zolmitriptan oral tablet (2.5mg) or placebo for the treatment of three moderate
      or severe migraine attacks. The primary outcome measure was headache response at 
      2 hours following treatment, defined as reduced intensity of migraine pain (using
      a scale of none, mild, moderate or severe) from severe or moderate at baseline to
      mild or no pain at 2 hours after treatment. Secondary outcome measures included
      early headache response at 15, 30 and 45 minutes and headache response at 1 and 4
      hours postdose, as well as pain-free rates at 15, 30 and 45 minutes and 1, 2 and 
      4 hours postdose. Laboratory assessments, vital signs, 12-lead ECGs and nose and 
      throat examinations were performed at screening and follow-up visits. Adverse
      events were recorded throughout the study using Coding Symbols for Thesaurus of
      Adverse Reaction Terms (COSTART) terminology. RESULTS: Each dose of zolmitriptan 
      nasal spray produced a greater 2-hour headache response rate than placebo (70.3%,
      58.6%, 54.8% and 41.5% for zolmitriptan nasal spray 5.0, 2.5, 1.0 and 0.5mg,
      compared with 30.6% for placebo [all p < 0.001 vs placebo]). The 2-hour headache 
      response rate for zolmitriptan nasal spray 5.0mg was significantly higher than
      that of the zolmitriptan 2.5mg oral tablet (61.3%; p < 0.05), while comparisons
      of nasal spray 0.5, 1.0 and 2.5mg with zolmitriptan 2.5mg oral tablet were not
      statistically significant. The nasal spray 5.0 and 2.5mg showed a rapid onset of 
      action, with a significant difference in headache response compared with placebo 
      from 15 minutes through 4 hours after administration and a significant difference
      between the nasal spray 5.0mg and 2.5mg oral tablet from 15 minutes through to 2 
      hours (the other nasal spray doses were not statistically significant compared
      with 2.5mg oral tablet). Zolmitriptan nasal spray resulted in pain-free rates
      that were dose dependent. While all doses from 1.0 mg upwards produced
      significant pain-free outcomes from 30 minutes versus placebo, only the 5.0mg
      dose produced pain-free rates significantly superior to both placebo and the
      2.5mg oral tablet. Zolmitriptan nasal spray was well tolerated, with the most
      common adverse events being unusual taste and paresthesia. The majority of
      adverse events were of short duration and mild or moderate intensity. Only ten
      patients were withdrawn from the trial because of adverse events. Serious adverse
      events were reported by nine patients after taking study medication, but none was
      considered to be causally related to study medication. Zolmitriptan was not
      associated with any clinically significant changes in laboratory test values or
      vital signs. CONCLUSION: All doses of zolmitriptan nasal spray produced
      significant 2-hour headache response rates compared with placebo. The 5.0 and
      2.5mg doses were also significantly more effective than placebo for the majority 
      of secondary efficacy measures. Zolmitriptan nasal spray 5.0mg provided a
      headache response statistically superior to both placebo and the 2.5mg tablet as 
      early as 15 minutes after administration, while demonstrating pain-free outcomes 
      significantly superior to placebo and the 2.5mg tablet as early as 30 minutes
      after administration. All doses of zolmitriptan nasal spray were well tolerated, 
      resulting in an optimal therapeutic index and clinical recommendation for the
      5.0mg dose.

TI  - A prospective double-blind study of nasal sumatriptan versus IV ketorolac in
      migraine.
PG  - 173-5
AB  - We conducted a study to compare the efficacy in migraine headache of nasal
      sumatriptan and intravenous ketorolac. The study was a prospective, double-blind 
      study done with a convenience sample of 29 patients presenting to the emergency
      department (ED) with acute migraine. Patients received either 20 mg of nasal
      sumatriptan or 30 mg of intravenous ketorolac. Patients scored the severity of
      their headache on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) of pain prior to medication,
      and again 1 hour after medication. Differences between initial and 1-hour scores 
      were analyzed. Before treatment, no difference existed between the groups in the 
      intensity of headache. One hour after medication, the sumatriptan group had a
      decrease in pain score of 22.937 mm and the ketorolac group a decrease of 71.462 
      mm on the VAS. The decrease in pain score with ketorolac was significantly
      greater than that with sumatriptan (P < 0.001). The study therefore showed that
      both sumatriptan and ketorolac effectively reduced the pain associated with acute
      migraine headache, but that intravenous ketorolac produced a greater reduction in
      pain than did nasal sumatriptan.

TI  - The triptan formulations: a critical evaluation.
PG  - 313-20
AB  - The migraine-specific triptans have revolutionized the treatment of migraine and 
      are usually the drugs of choice to treat a migraine attack in progress. Different
      triptans are available in different strengths and formulations including oral
      tablets, orally disintegrating tablets, nasal sprays and subcutaneous injections.
      In Europe, sumatriptan is also available as a suppository. Specific differences
      among the triptans exist as evidenced by different pharmacological profiles
      including T1/2, Tmax, Cmax, AUC, metabolism, drug-drug interaction profiles,
      amongst other parameters. How or whether these differences translate to clinical 
      efficacy and tolerability differences is not well differentiated. Clinical
      distinctions among these agents are subtle and proper choice of triptan requires 
      attention to the specific characteristics of each individual patient, knowledge
      of patient preference, accurate history of the efficacy of previous acute care
      medications as well as individual features of the drug being considered. Delivery
      systems may play an important role in the onset of action of triptans. The
      selection of an acute antimigraine drug for a patient depends upon the
      stratification of the patient's migraine attack by peak intensity, time to peak
      intensity, level of associated symptoms such as nausea and vomiting, time to
      associated symptoms, comorbid diseases, and concomitant treatments that might
      cause drug-drug interactions. The clinician has in his armamentarium an
      ever-expanding variety of medications, available in multiple formulations and
      dosages, with good safety and tolerability profiles. Continued clinical use will 
      yield familiarity with the various triptans, and it should become possible for
      the interested physician to match individual patient needs with the specific
      characteristics of a triptan to optimize therapeutic benefit.

TI  - Short latency trigemino-sternocleidomastoid response in patients with migraine.
PG  - 725-32
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the central trigeminal circuits in migraine patients.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Short latency responses can be recorded in
      sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscles after stimulation of the trigeminal nerve
      (trigemino-cervical reflex). This brainstem reflex was investigated in 20 healthy
      subjects, in 20 patients suffering from migraine with aura (MWA) and in 20
      patients suffering from migraine without aura (MWOA) during and between the
      attacks. RESULTS: The trigemino-cervical responses were bilaterally abnormal in
      17 patients with MWA and 15 patients with MWOA during the headache attacks, in 11
      patients with MWA and in 10 patients with MWOA during the interictal period. In
      the patients with normal trigemino-cervical responses during the pain-free phase 
      the triptan was significantly more effective at relieving headache. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our findings further support and emphasise the role of the trigeminal system in
      the pathogenesis of migraine. The bilateral location of the abnormalities
      suggests a centrally located dysfunction. Therefore, the trigemino-cervical
      reflex is sensitive in disclosing a disturbed brainstem activity and may be an
      index of neuronal activity in the human brainstem; moreover their assessment may 
      help as valuable prognostic tool for predicting the efficacy of triptans therapy.

TI  - Current and potential pharmacological treatments for obsessive-compulsive
      disorder.
PG  - 993-1001
AB  - In the past 20 years, several effective treatments have been developed for
      obsessive-compulsive disorder. Despite this, it is a disorder that is often
      inadequately treated by available therapies. Recent advances in neuroimaging and 
      neurophysiology have provided some clues to possible treatments that may be more 
      effective in treating this disorder. Serotonin agents remain the cornerstone of
      pharmacological treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder. The development of
      agents that target specific serotonin receptor subtypes may improve the
      effectiveness of drug treatment. Other possible future treatment approaches are
      also discussed.

TI  - Conscious expectation and unconscious conditioning in analgesic, motor, and
      hormonal placebo/nocebo responses.
PG  - 4315-23
AB  - The placebo and nocebo effect is believed to be mediated by both cognitive and
      conditioning mechanisms, although little is known about their role in different
      circumstances. In this study, we first analyzed the effects of opposing verbal
      suggestions on experimental ischemic arm pain in healthy volunteers and on motor 
      performance in Parkinsonian patients and found that verbally induced expectations
      of analgesia/hyperalgesia and motor improvement/worsening antagonized completely 
      the effects of a conditioning procedure. We also measured the effects of opposing
      verbal suggestions on hormonal secretion and found that verbally induced
      expectations of increase/decrease of growth hormone (GH) and cortisol did not
      have any effect on the secretion of these hormones. However, if a preconditioning
      was performed with sumatriptan, a 5-HT(1B/1D) agonist that stimulates GH and
      inhibits cortisol secretion, a significant increase of GH and decrease of
      cortisol plasma concentrations were found after placebo administration, although 
      opposite verbal suggestions were given. These findings indicate that verbally
      induced expectations have no effect on hormonal secretion, whereas they affect
      pain and motor performance. This suggests that placebo responses are mediated by 
      conditioning when unconscious physiological functions such as hormonal secretion 
      are involved, whereas they are mediated by expectation when conscious
      physiological processes such as pain and motor performance come into play, even
      though a conditioning procedure is performed.

TI  - Demographic and migraine characteristics of adolescents with migraine: Glaxo
      Wellcome clinical trials' database.
PG  - 451-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the demographics and migraine characteristics of patients 
      in the Glaxo Wellcome adolescent clinical trials' database. METHODS: Data from 8 
      sumatriptan (tablet and nasal spray) and naratriptan (tablet) trials (6 placebo
      controlled and 2 open label) were reviewed. Adolescents aged 12 to 17 years who
      had participated in migraine clinical trials and used at least 1 dose of study
      medication were summarized using descriptive statistics. Patient demographic
      (gender, age, race, height, and weight) and migraine (diagnosis, pain location
      and intensity, time and day of migraine onset and treatment, and associated
      symptoms) characteristics were examined. RESULTS: One thousand nine hundred
      thirty-two adolescents with migraine were identified; mean age was 14.1 years
      (standard deviation, 1.64; range, 11 to 18) and 54% of patients were female. More
      males were represented in the 12- to 14-year-old group (646 [73%] of 885) than in
      the 15- to 17-year-old group (234 [26%] of 885). Most patients reported migraine 
      without aura (67%, 1121 of 1672), unilateral migraine pain (58%, 458 of 787), and
      pulsating pain (74%, 582 of 790). Migraine was aggravated by physical activity in
      most of the adolescents (88%, 526 of 598). Most migraine attacks (73%, 1363 of
      1858) began between 6 am and 6 pm, and proportionately more attacks occurred
      Monday through Wednesday. Pretreatment vomiting was experienced by 5% (97 of
      1830) of patients, nausea by 53% (983 of 1849), and photophobia or phonophobia
      (or both) by 88% (1628 of 1858) of patients. The incidence of associated symptoms
      was directly related to pretreatment headache severity. CONCLUSIONS: In this
      large clinical trials' database, adolescents had migraine without aura
      characterized by unilateral and pulsating pain and aggravated by activity. The
      incidence of associated symptoms was directly related to pretreatment pain
      intensity. More migraines occurred Monday through Wednesday during typical school
      hours. These data may facilitate clinicians' efforts to tailor migraine therapy
      to the needs of this patient population.

      migraine. New triptans in several formulations will soon become available in the 
      United States. Although the similarities of these 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)
      1B/1D receptor agonists outweigh their differences, important differences in
      pharmacokinetics and clinical responses do exist. Subcutaneous sumatriptan has
      the most rapid onset of action and greatest efficacy but the most adverse
      effects. Intranasal sumatriptan also has rapid onset of action, but at 2 hours
      its efficacy is comparable to that of oral zolmitriptan. Of the oral triptans,
      rizatriptan seems to have the greatest early efficacy. Both rizatriptan and
      zolmitriptan are now available as rapidly dissolving wafers. Almotriptan, the
      newest of the triptans, has a response rate similar to that of oral sumatriptan
      and may produce fewer adverse effects. Naratriptan and frovatriptan, with their
      slow onset, high tolerability, and long half-lives, may have a role in aborting
      prolonged migraine attacks and in headache prevention. Eletriptan at higher doses
      (80 mg) has a response rate approaching that of rizatriptan but may be limited by
      potential side effects. The many triptans available offer the opportunity to
      individualize migraine treatment, depending on the patient's attack
      characteristics, tolerance, and preferences.

AB  - Although considerable advances have been made in the understanding and treatment 
      of migraine, uncertainty about the management of this disorder remains. Once a
      diagnosis is established, an effective treatment plan should be developed that
      includes education for the patient about migraine and reassurance that the
      headaches are not caused by structural pathology, stress, or psychopathology.
      Rapidly effective acute treatment, nonpharmacologic treatment such as behavioral 
      and lifestyle changes, preventive measures, and patient follow-up are other
      essential elements of migraine management.

TI  - Interaction between ketoconazole and almotriptan in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 423-7
AB  - The interaction between almotriptan, a 5-HT1B/1D agonist, and the potent CYP3A4
      inhibitor ketoconazole was examined in 16 healthy volunteers. Subjects received
      (A) 12.5 mg almotriptan orally on Day 2 of a 3-day regimen of 400 mg ketoconazole
      once daily and (B) 12.5 mg almotriptan in a crossover design. Plasma and urine
      concentrations of almotriptan were measured by HPLC. Treatment effects on
      almotriptan pharmacokinetics were assessed by analysis of variance. Ketoconazole 
      coadministration increased mean almotriptan AUC and Cmax from 312 to 490 ng h/mL 
      and 52.6 to 84.5 ng/mL, respectively. Mean oral clearance was decreased from 40.7
      to 26.2 L/h by ketoconazole, with an accompanying increase in the fraction of
      almotriptan excreted unchanged in the urine (40.6% to 53.3%) and a decrease in
      renal clearance (16.4 to 13.8 L/h). These effects were statistically significant.
      The effects of ketoconazole on almotriptan clearance were consistent with
      inhibition of the CYP3A4-mediated metabolism and a slight effect on the active
      tubular secretion of almotriptan.

TI  - Hypersensitivity reactions to non-beta-lactam antibiotics.
PG  - 221-8
AB  - As alternatives to beta lactam antibiotics continue to be developed, an
      increasing number of patients are experiencing hypersensitivity reactions to
      these agents. Unfortunately, unlike penicillin, there are no validated skin
      testing reagents to aid in confirming the presence of specific IgE antibodies to 
      these drugs. This review summarizes what is known about hypersensitivity
      reactions to non-beta lactam antibiotics, and includes practical approaches to
      readministering these drugs in selected situations. Sulfonamides, vancomycin,
      macrolides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, and anti-virals are included in the 
      discussion.

TI  - Backache, headache, and neurologic deficit after regional anesthesia.
PG  - 71-86
AB  - Back pain, chemical backache, PDPH, and neurologic deficit all may be reported
      after regional anesthesia for childbirth. Back pain is common during pregnancy,
      but epidural analgesia during labor does not increase the incidence of long-term 
      back pain. Chemical backache caused by 2-chloroprocaine is probably a result of
      hypocalcemic tetany of paraspinous muscles. The mechanism is presumed to be
      chelation of calcium by sodium bisulfite, an antioxidant present in
      nesacaine-MPF. PDPH after dural puncture is caused by leakage of CSF, which
      causes cerebral hypotension. Cerebral hypotension leads to traction on
      pain-sensitive intracranial structures and cerebral vasodilation. Initial therapy
      includes hydration, caffeine, and sumatriptan. EBP is the most effective
      treatment in severe PDPH. If the first EBP fails, a second blood patch can be
      performed. Neurologic deficits after regional anesthesia are rare. Meticulous
      technique and vigilance are the keystones in avoiding major neurologic
      complications of regional anesthesia. Rapid diagnosis and appropriate treatment
      are essential to optimize a successful outcome if complications do develop.

TI  - The triptan formulations : how to match patients and products.
PG  - 431-47
AB  - The 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonists (the 'triptans') are migraine-specific agents
      that have revolutionised the treatment of migraine. They are usually the drugs of
      choice to treat a migraine attack in progress. Different triptans are available
      in various strengths and formulations, including oral tablets, orally
      disintegrating tablets, nasal sprays and subcutaneous injections. In Europe,
      sumatriptan is also available as a suppository. Specific differences among the
      triptans exist, as evidenced by different pharmacological profiles including
      half-life, time to peak plasma concentrations, peak plasma concentrations, area
      under the concentration-time curve, metabolism and drug-drug interaction
      profiles. How or whether these differences translate to clinical efficacy and
      tolerability advantages for one agent over another is not well differentiated.
      However, delivery systems may play an important role in onset of action. Given
      that the clinical distinctions among these agents are subtle, identification of
      the most appropriate triptan for an individual patient requires consideration of 
      the specific characteristics of the patient and knowledge of patient preference, 
      an accurate history of the efficacy of previous acute-care medications and
      individual features of the drug being considered. The selection of an acute
      antimigraine drug also depends upon the stratification of the patient's migraine 
      attack by peak intensity, time to peak intensity, level of associated symptoms
      such as nausea and vomiting, time to associated symptoms, comorbid diseases and
      concomitant treatments that might cause drug-drug interactions. Individual
      patient response to the triptans seems to be idiosyncratic and possibly
      genetically determined. Therefore, a set of specific questions can be used to
      determine whether a currently used triptan is optimally effective, whether the
      dose needs to be increased or whether another triptan should be tried. The
      clinician has in his/her armamentarium an ever-expanding variety of triptans,
      available in multiple formulations and dosages, which have good safety and
      tolerability profiles. Continued clinical use will yield familiarity with the
      various triptans, and it should become possible for the interested physician to
      match individual patient needs with the specific characteristics of a triptan to 
      optimise therapeutic benefit. Use of the methods outlined in this review in
      choosing a triptan for an individual patient is probably more likely to lead to
      migraine relief than making an educated guess as to which triptan is most
      appropriate.

TI  - Quality, efficacy and safety of complementary medicines: fashions, facts and the 
      future. Part II: Efficacy and safety.
PG  - 331-40
AB  - This is the second of two papers which review issues concerning complementary
      medicines. The first reviewed the extent of use of complementary medicines, and
      issues related to the regulation and pharmaceutical quality of these products;
      the second considers evidence for the efficacy of several well-known
      complementary medicines, and discusses complementary-medicines pharmacovigilance.
      The term complementary medicines describes a range of pharmaceutical-type
      preparations, including herbal medicines, homoeopathic remedies, essential oils
      and dietary supplements, which mainly sit outside conventional medicine. The use 
      of complementary medicines is a popular healthcare approach in the UK, and there 
      are signs that the use of such products is continuing to increase. Patients and
      the public use complementary medicines for health maintenance, for the treatment 
      or prevention of minor ailments, and also for serious, chronic illnesses. There
      is a growing body of evidence from randomized controlled trials and systematic
      reviews to support the efficacy of certain herbal extracts and dietary
      supplements in particular conditions. However, many other preparations remain
      untested. Strictly speaking, evidence of efficacy (and safety) for herbal
      medicines should be considered to be extract specific. Pharmacovigilance for
      complementary medicines is in its infancy. Data are lacking in several areas
      relevant to safety. Standard pharmacovigilance tools have additional limitations 
      when applied to investigating safety concerns with complementary medicines.

TI  - Update on the role of drug therapy in non-ulcer dyspepsia.
PG  - 25-30
AB  - Non-ulcer dyspepsia is common and is often confused with other diagnoses. It
      remains a condition identified by exclusion, and continues to be a challenge to
      manage. Currently, only a limited number of pharmacological options are
      available. Antacids are no more effective than placebo in treating nonulcer
      dyspepsia. H2-receptor antagonists appear to be superior to placebo in efficacy, 
      but many of the studies suggesting this finding have had a suboptimal study
      design. Proton pump inhibitors have been shown to be superior to placebo,
      although questions remain as to whether the only subgroup that responds is
      comprised of patients with unrecognized gastroesophageal reflux disease. Studies 
      have found that prokinetic agents are superior to placebo, but currently only a
      very limited number of agents within this class can be prescribed in the United
      States. Sparse data support the role of metoclopramide and its side effects limit
      its use even further. The eradication of Helicobacter pylori has a small but
      positive therapeutic benefit in non-ulcer dyspepsia, and can be considered in
      those confirmed to be infected. Sucralfate is unlikely to be effective, and
      misoprostol is ineffective. Bismuth alone is probably not efficacious. Tricyclic 
      antidepressants may have a therapeutic role, but this is not firmly established
      and this class of medication should be reserved for resistant cases. Emerging
      therapies include drugs that relax the gastric fundus, such as buspirone or
      sumatriptan, and the new prokinetic tegaserod. Psychological therapies may play a
      role but studies of these therapies are limited. Therapy for non-ulcer dyspepsia 
      remains challenging and is usually empiric; it will remain so until the
      mechanisms that induce symptoms of dyspepsia are better understood.

TI  - A comparison of familial and sporadic migraine in a headache clinic population.
PG  - 193-7
AB  - We compared the clinical, psychological and pharmacological characteristics of
      patients with familial migraine and patients with sporadic migraine. Five hundred
      and thirty consecutive new patients attending our Headache Center over a two-year
      period were involved in the study. The patients were divided into two groups: A. 
      Familial migraine (famM)--at least one first-degree relative affected; B.
      Sporadic migraine (spoM)--no first-degree relative affected. Four hundred and
      twenty-four patients (80%) fulfilled the criteria for famM and 106 (20%) for
      spoM. The patients with famM showed a significantly (p<0.01) earlier age at onset
      of the disease. No significant difference in all the remaining features examined 
      was found. Our data suggest that famM and spoM represent a single disease entity.

TI  - Efficacy of sumatriptan nasal spray in recurrent migrainous headache: an open
      prospective study.
PG  - 395-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of sumatriptan 20 mg via nasal spray and
      100-mg tablets in treating migrainous headache in patients without a concomitant 
      migraine diagnosis. METHODS: We prospectively investigated the efficacy of
      sumatriptan 20 mg via nasal spray and 100-mg tablets in patients with a history
      of at least 5 moderate to severe headache attacks lasting 2 to 72 hours that
      consistently did not meet the International Headache Society (IHS) criteria for
      migraine or episodic tension-type headache. RESULTS: Nineteen headache attacks
      classifiable as migrainous disorder without aura (IHS 1.7) were evaluated in 13
      patients using 20-mg sumatriptan nasal spray within a 10-week period. A 2-point
      decrease in headache severity on a four-point scale was achieved in 74% (95%
      confidence interval [CI], 50% to 89%) of the attacks within 2 hours. The
      pain-free incidence (a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe to 
      none) was 37% (95% CI, 17% to 63%) after 2 hours. Ten patients completed the
      second part of the study, taking oral sumatriptan for 14 migrainous attacks: a
      2-point decrease in headache severity was achieved in 38% (95% CI, 13% to 71%) of
      the attacks within 2 hours and in 77% (95% CI, 48% to 92%) within 4 hours.
      CONCLUSION: This is the first prospective study to show that intranasal or oral
      sumatriptan may be effective in patients experiencing moderate to severe headache
      attacks which consistently do not fulfill the IHS criteria for migraine or
      episodic tension-type headache.

TI  - Post-dural puncture headaches in children. A literature review.
PG  - 117-21
AB  - Post-dural puncture headache (PDPH) is a well recognised complication of spinal
      and epidural anaesthesia. It can also occur after diagnostic or therapeutic
      lumbar puncture. Few cases have been reported in children. We reviewed the
      literature regarding definition, aetiology, incidence, risk factors, prevention
      and treatment, in order to provide some recommendations. Significant factors
      include age, gender, needle diameter, needle tip design, orientation of the tip
      during puncture, previous PDPH, history of migraine and repeated attempts to
      achieve puncture. There is no evidence for the use of increased fluids or bed
      rest to prevent PDPH. Once the diagnosis is made, conservative therapy is
      recommended for 48 h. Persistent PDPH can be treated in several ways; an epidural
      blood patch is one of the most effective methods. CONCLUSION: occurrence of
      post-dural puncture headache after lumbar puncture in children is rare. There are
      conflicting data about risk factors, prevention and treatment.

TI  - An open-label study to assess changes in efficacy and satisfaction with migraine 
      care when patients have access to multiple sumatriptan succinate formulations.
PG  - 235-46
AB  - BACKGROUND: Because a patient's migraines often differ in duration, intensity,
      and accompanying symptoms, as well as the conditions and circumstances at the
      time of the headache, the mode for treatment also may change. OBJECTIVE: The goal
      of this study was to determine whether migraine management is improved by
      providing 3 formulations of sumatriptan succinate to patients, together with
      education to assist them in selecting the most appropriate formulation for
      specific attacks. METHODS: This was an open-label study conducted in 3 family
      practice settings. Patients were recruited who had at least a 1-year history of
      migraine meeting International Headache Society criteria and experienced 2 to 6
      attacks per month within the previous 3 months. Patients received instructions on
      oral, intranasal, and subcutaneous (SC) sumatriptan and were provided with all 3 
      formulations to treat 6 headaches. Migraine features, formulation used, reason
      for selecting specific formulation, migraine symptom relief, and use of follow-up
      doses were recorded in diaries. At follow-up, patients completed a questionnaire 
      assessing satisfaction with access to multiple formulations. RESULTS: Of the 33
      enrolled patients (26 women, 7 men; mean age, 38.5 years [range, 23-54 years]),
      25 (75.8%) completed all visits. Of 149 headaches treated, 39 (26.2%) were mild
      at onset, 70 (47.0%) were moderate, and 40 (26.8%) were severe. Eighty (53.7%)
      headaches were treated with tablets, 35 (23.5%) with nasal spray, and 34 (22.8%) 
      with SC injection. Primary reasons for selecting specific formulations included
      "fewer side effects" for tablets, "convenience" for nasal spray, and "quick onset
      of action" for SC injection. Twenty-one (84.0%) patients reported being either
      very satisfied or satisfied with their ability to manage their headaches.
      Physicians reported that 18 of 24 (75.0%) patients had an improved attitude
      toward managing their headaches. All formulations were well tolerated. Eight
      (32.0%) patients reported adverse events, the 2 most common being chest pressure 
      and fatigue. CONCLUSION: The patients in this study reported greater satisfaction
      with migraine management when given access to multiple sumatriptan formulations
      and education regarding their appropriate use.

TI  - Transient minor improvement of high altitude headache by sumatriptan.
PG  - 387-93
AB  - High-altitude headache often fulfills the criteria of migraine. Therefore, we
      hypothesized that sumatriptan, a 5-HT1 receptor agonist specifically effective
      for treatment of migraine, would also alleviate high altitude headache. A
      randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind trial was performed on 29
      mountaineers with at least moderate headache on the day of arrival at 4559 m.
      Fourteen subjects received 100 mg sumatriptan orally and 15 subjects received
      placebo. Before treatment there were no significant differences between groups
      regarding rate of ascent, duration and severity of headache, and acute mountain
      sickness score. All 6 female subjects were randomly assigned to placebo. Absolute
      values and the reduction of headache scores 1, 3, and 12 h after the
      administration of sumatriptan did not differ between treatment groups, but
      headache scores tended to be lower with sumatriptan after 1 or 3 h when compared 
      with placebo. Considering only male mountaineers, there was a significant
      decrease of headache scores after 1 and 3 h. Because there was only a minor
      transient amelioration of high altitude headache with sumatriptan, we conclude
      that 5-HT1 receptors do not play a major role in the pathophysiology of high
      altitude headache.

TI  - Effect of autogenic training on drug consumption in patients with primary
      headache: an 8-month follow-up study.
PG  - 251-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of Schultz-type autogenic training on
      headache-related drug consumption and headache frequency in patients with
      migraine, tension-type, or mixed (migraine plus tension-type) headache over an
      8-month period. BACKGROUND: Behavioral treatments often are used alone or
      adjunctively for different types of headache. There are, however, only a few
      studies that have compared the efficacy and durability of the same treatment in
      different types of primary headache, and the effects of treatment on
      headache-related drug consumption rarely have been assessed even in these
      studies. METHODS: Twenty-five women with primary headache (11 with mixed
      headache, 8 with migraine, and 6 with tension-type headache) were evaluated via
      an open-label, self-controlled, 8-month, follow-up study design. After an initial
      4 months of observation, patients began learning Schultz-type autogenic training 
      as modified for patients with headache. They practiced autogenic training on a
      regular basis for 4 months. Based on data from headache diaries and daily
      medication records, headache frequencies and the amounts of analgesics,
      "migraine-specific" drugs (ergots and triptans), and anxiolytics taken by the
      patients were compared in the three subgroups over the 8-month period.
      Results.-From the first month of implementation of autogenic training, headache
      frequencies were significantly reduced in patients with tension-type and mixed
      headache. Significant reduction in frequency was achieved in patients with
      migraine only from the third month of autogenic training. Decreases in headache
      frequencies were accompanied by decreases in consumption of migraine drugs and
      analgesics resulting in significant correlations among these parameters.
      Reduction in consumption of anxiolytic drugs was more rapid and robust in
      patients with tension-type headache compared to patients with migraine, and this 
      outcome failed to show any correlation with change in headache frequency.
      CONCLUSION: Schultz-type autogenic training is an effective therapeutic approach 
      that may lead to a reduction in both headache frequency and the use of headache
      medication.

TI  - Real-world experiences in migraine therapy with rizatriptan.
PG  - 223-30
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of rizatriptan for acute migraine
      treatment and patient satisfaction with the drug in usual clinical practice
      settings. BACKGROUND: Although rizatriptan has been shown to effectively relieve 
      migraine symptoms in clinical trials, we wished to assess its utility in typical 
      patient care settings. Design.-Multicenter, open-label design involving the
      patients of practicing clinicians. METHODS: Adult migraineurs treated two
      migraine attacks with either rizatriptan 10-mg standard tablets or rizatriptan
      10-mg orally disintegrating tablets in a crossover manner. Participants had not
      taken rizatriptan previously and chose which formulation to take first. Patients 
      reported their treatment experiences via an interactive voice response system
      approximately 24 hours after treatment. Prior migraine treatment experiences were
      reported by patients on a baseline questionnaire completed at participating
      clinics. We used conditional logistic regression analysis adjusted for treatment 
      sequences to test the statistical significance of comparisons with results
      recorded on the baseline questionnaire. RESULTS: Of the 5388 patients enrolled,
      3953 (73%) completed at least one follow-up and 3183 (59%) completed two
      follow-up reports. Patients reported the following outcomes for attacks treated
      with the rizatriptan tablet and orally disintegrating tablet formulations,
      respectively, compared with their prior responses to oral usual care medications 
      (P <.05 in all comparisons with baseline data): onset of pain relief within 30
      minutes postdose: 18% and 23% versus 16%; no or mild headache 2 hours postdose:
      66% and 67% versus 37%; largely symptom-free within 2 hours postdose: 52% and 54%
      versus 35%; return to usual activities within 2 hours postdose: 50% and 51%
      versus 31%; and very or somewhat satisfied with treatment: 72% and 74% versus
      53%. CONCLUSIONS: In this "real-world" setting involving a patient population
      selected by clinicians, rizatriptan appeared to offer better treatment outcomes
      than those from prior treatments with other oral migraine medications.

TI  - Migraine preventive medication reduces resource utilization.
PG  - 171-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if long-term resource utilization is reduced by adding a 
      preventive medication to a migraine management regimen that already includes
      acute medication. BACKGROUND: In 2000, new evidence-based guidelines for the
      treatment of migraine were released by the US Headache Consortium and the
      American Academy of Neurology. Although these guidelines emphasize the role of
      preventive medication in achieving significant clinical improvement, little yet
      is known concerning the impact of such management on medical and pharmaceutical
      resources. Methods.-Resource utilization information in a large claims database
      was analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Adding a preventive medication to migraine
      management reduced the use of other migraine medications, as well as visits to
      physician offices and emergency departments. In addition, both acute and
      preventive medications were associated with lower utilization of computed
      tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans. CONCLUSION: Migraine preventive 
      drug therapy is effective in reducing resource consumption when added to therapy 
      consisting only of an acute medication.

TI  - Effect of the 5-HT1 agonist sumatriptan on oesophageal motor pattern in patients 
      with ineffective oesophageal motility.
PG  - 9-14
AB  - The 5-HT1 agonist sumatriptan (SUM) elicits an increase in amplitude of
      oesophageal motor waves and of lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) tone in healthy 
      subjects. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether such an effect occurs also
      in patients with ineffective oesophageal motility (IOM). 16 patients (nine males 
      and seven females, age range 34-55 years) with chest pain and mild to moderate
      dysphagia were studied; all had undergone previous cardiologic, radiologic and
      upper gastrointestinal endoscopic exams that were normal. An oesophageal
      manometry was performed using an electronic probe to record swallows,
      oesophageal, LOS and gastric motility. The patients whose motor pattern were
      compatible with IOM (>30% of motor waves with amplitude <30 mmHg and/or
      non-transmitted) received SUM or placebo 6 mg s.c., injected in the morning and
      in the afternoon in a random order. The data analysis was limited to 1 h before
      and 1 h after the drug injections. Ten out of the 16 patients showed an IOM motor
      pattern. The administration of SUM caused a significant increase in the number of
      swallows (SUM 99.5 +/- 15.4 vs 78.6 +/- 16.1 basal, P = 0.03) and of primary
      oesophageal motor waves (SUM 89.6 +/- 13.4 vs 67.2 +/- 12.9 basal, P = 0.04) with
      no significant changes in the percentage of swallows associated with propagation.
      Placebo was not associated with increase in the number of swallows (80.3 +/-
      14.6, P = 0.9) or of primary oesophageal motor waves (70.1 +/- 12.3, P = 0.7).
      The amplitude and the percentage of propagated oesophageal motor waves as well as
      the mean basal LOS tone were unaltered by SUM. There was no change in the
      symptoms reported after SUM. Although effective in healthy subjects, SUM 6 mg
      s.c. improves only the numbers but not the amplitude or propagation of
      oesophageal motility of patients with IOM. The 5-HT1 pathway and its acute
      stimulation seem to play only a minor role in the pathogenesis of such a disease.

TI  - Antidepressants: update on new agents and indications.
PG  - 547-54
AB  - A number of antidepressants have emerged in the U.S. market in the past two
      decades. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have become the drugs of choice 
      in the treatment of depression, and they are also effective in the treatment of
      obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, and social phobia. New indications
      for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors include post-traumatic stress
      disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder.
      Extended-release venlafaxine has recently been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder. Mirtazapine,
      which is unrelated to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, is unique in
      its action--stimulating the release of norepinephrine and serotonin. The choice
      of antidepressant drug depends on the agent's pharmacologic profile, secondary
      actions, and tolerability. Sexual dysfunction related to the use of
      antidepressants may be addressed by reducing the dosage, switching to another
      agent, or adding another drug to overcome the sexual side effects. Augmentation
      with lithium or triiodothyronine may be useful in patients who are partially or
      totally resistant to antidepressant treatment. Finally, tapering antidepressant
      medication may help to avoid discontinuation syndrome or antidepressant
      withdrawal.

TI  - Frovatriptan: a selective type 1B/1D serotonin receptor agonist for the treatment
      of migraine headache.
PG  - 615-29
AB  - Frovatriptan belongs to an innovative family of compounds aimed at breaking
      through the long-standing barrier of migraine headache understanding and
      treatment. While a typology of headaches has been recognized for some time, and a
      number of therapies have been introduced for reduction of headache pain and
      duration, the causes of migraine remain a subject of debate. Those prone to
      attacks continue to endure them and suffer the related symptoms such as nausea
      and disorientation. Frovatriptan, like all the triptans, acts by inducing
      vasoconstriction of the meningeal arteries. It has been shown in pharmacological 
      tests to act selectively as a potent agonist of serotonin 5-HT1B/1D receptors.
      Frovatriptan has been well tolerated in humans and efficacious in reducing
      headache pain and duration in clinical trials, which have also indicated that
      dose adjustments for age or gender are not necessary for the drug. Patients have 
      found the use of frovatriptan acceptable over the long-term, and overall a
      low-incidence of adverse effects has been reported. Though not a prophylactic,
      frovatriptan has demonstrated the potential to significantly improve the
      therapeutic approaches to the treatment of migraine.

TI  - Ergotamine and dihydroergotamine: history, pharmacology, and efficacy.
PG  - 144-66
AB  - Ergotamine and dihydroergotamine share structural similarities with the
      adrenergic, dopaminergic, and serotonergic neurotransmitters. As a result, they
      have wide-ranging effects on the physiologic processes that they mediate.
      Ergotamine and dihydroergotamine are highly potent at the 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D
      antimigraine receptors and, as a consequence, the plasma concentrations that are 
      necessary to produce the appropriate therapeutic and physiologic effects are very
      low. The broad spectrum of activity at other monoamine receptors is responsible
      for their side effect profile (dysphoria, nausea, emesis, unnecessary vascular
      effects). Both ergotamine and dihydroergotamine have sustained vasoconstrictor
      actions. In acute migraine treatment, their mechanisms of action involve
      constricting the pain-producing intracranial extracerebral blood vessels at the
      5-HT1B receptors and inhibiting the trigeminal neurotransmission at the
      peripheral and central 5-HT1D receptors. The scientific evidence for efficacy is 
      stronger for dihydroergotamine than for ergotamine. Their wide use is based on
      long-term experience.

TI  - Nasal drug delivery: new developments and strategies.
PG  - 1184-9
AB  - The use of the nasal route for the delivery of challenging drugs has created much
      interest in recent years in the pharmaceutical industry. Consequently, drug
      delivery companies are actively pursuing the development of novel nasal
      drug-delivery systems and the exploitation of these for administration of
      conventional generic drugs and peptides, both in-house and with partners in the
      pharmaceutical industry. This review sets out to discuss some new developments
      and strategies in nasal drug delivery. An exiting discovery that drugs can be
      transported directly from nose to brain via the olfactory pathway is discussed
      and examples of proof-of-concept in man are given.

TI  - Acupuncture versus placebo versus sumatriptan for early treatment of migraine
      attacks: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 181-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether acupuncture is superior to placebo and
      equivalent to sumatriptan for the early treatment of an acute migraine attack.
      DESIGN: Randomized, partly double-blind (sumatriptan versus placebo) trial.
      SETTING: Two hospitals in Germany (one specialized in traditional Chinese
      medicine and one in the treatment of headache). SUBJECTS: A total of 179
      migraineurs experiencing the first symptoms of a developing migraine attack.
      INTERVENTIONS: Traditional Chinese acupuncture, sumatriptan (6 mg subcutaneously)
      or placebo injection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Number of patients in whom a full
      migraine attack (defined as severe migraine headache) within 48 h was prevented. 
      In patients who developed a migraine attack in spite of early treatment,
      acupuncture and sumatriptan were applied a second time, whilst patients initially
      randomized to placebo received sumatriptan. RESULTS: A full migraine attack was
      prevented in 21 of 60 (35%) patients receiving acupuncture, 21 of 58 (36%)
      patients receiving sumatriptan and 11 of 61 (18%) patients receiving placebo
      (relative risk of having a full attack 0.79 (95% CI, 0.64-0.99) for acupuncture
      versus placebo, and 0.78 (95% CI, 0.62-0.98) for sumatriptan versus placebo).
      Response to the second intervention in patients who developed a full attack was
      better with sumatriptan (17/31 patients who received sumatriptan twice and 37/46 
      patients who had had placebo first) than with acupuncture (4/31). The number of
      patients reporting side-effects was 14 in the acupuncture group, 23 in the
      sumatriptan group and 10 in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: In this trial
      acupuncture and sumatriptan were more effective than a placebo injection in the
      early treatment of an acute migraine attack. When an attack could not be
      prevented, sumatriptan was more effective than acupuncture at relieving headache.

TI  - Measuring the impact of MS on walking ability: the 12-Item MS Walking Scale
      (MSWS-12).
PG  - 31-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a patient-based measure of walking ability in MS. METHODS: 
      Twelve items describing the impact of MS on walking (12-Item MS Walking Scale
      [MSWS-12]) were generated from 30 patient interviews, expert opinion, and
      literature review. Preliminary psychometric evaluation (data quality, scaling
      assumptions, acceptability, reliability, validity) was undertaken in the data
      generated by 602 people from the MS Society membership database. Further
      psychometric evaluation (including comprehensive validity assessment,
      responsiveness, and relative efficiency) was conducted in two hospital-based
      samples: people with primary progressive MS (PPMS; n = 78) and people with
      relapses admitted for IV steroid treatment (n = 54). RESULTS: In all samples,
      missing data were low (< or =3.8%), item test-retest reproducibility was high (> 
      or =0.78), scaling assumptions were satisfied, and reliability was high (> or
      =0.94). Correlations between the MSWS-12 and other scales were consistent with a 
      priori hypotheses. The MSWS-12 (relative efficiency = 1.0) was more responsive
      than the Functional Assessment of Multiple Sclerosis mobility scale (0.72), the
      36-Item Short Form Health Survey physical functioning scale (0.33), the Expanded 
      Disability Status Scale (0.03), the 25-ft Timed Walk Test (0.44), and Guy's
      Neurologic Disability Scale lower limb disability item (0.10). CONCLUSIONS: The
      MSWS-12 satisfies standard criteria as a reliable and valid patient-based measure
      of the impact of MS on walking. In these samples, the MSWS-12 was more responsive
      than other walking-based scales.

TI  - Prophylactic treatment of migraine with an angiotensin II receptor blocker: a
      randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 65-9
AB  - CONTEXT: There is a paucity of effective, well-tolerated drugs available for
      migraine prophylaxis. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether treatment with the
      angiotensin II receptor blocker candesartan is effective as a
      migraine-prophylactic drug. DESIGN AND SETTING: Randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled crossover study performed in a Norwegian neurological
      outpatient clinic from January 2001 to February 2002. PATIENTS: Sixty patients
      aged 18 to 65 years with 2 to 6 migraine attacks per month were recruited mainly 
      from newspaper advertisements. INTERVENTIONS: A placebo run-in period of 4 weeks 
      was followed by two 12-week treatment periods separated by 4 weeks of placebo
      washout. Thirty patients were randomly assigned to receive one 16-mg candesartan 
      cilexetil tablet daily in the first treatment period followed by 1 placebo tablet
      daily in the second period. The remaining 30 received placebo followed by
      candesartan. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary end point was number of days with
      headache; secondary end points included hours with headache, days with migraine, 
      hours with migraine, headache severity index, level of disability, doses of
      triptans, doses of analgesics, acceptability of treatment, days of sick leave,
      and quality-of-life variables on the Short Form 36 questionnaire. RESULTS: In a
      period of 12 weeks, the mean number of days with headache was 18.5 with placebo
      vs 13.6 with candesartan (P =.001) in the intention-to-treat analysis (n = 57).
      Some secondary end points also favored candesartan, including hours with headache
      (139 vs 95; P<.001), days with migraine (12.6 vs 9.0; P<.001), hours with
      migraine (92.2 vs 59.4; P<.001), headache severity index (293 vs 191; P<.001),
      level of disability (20.6 vs 14.1; P<.001) and days of sick leave (3.9 vs 1.4; P 
      =.01), although there were no significant differences in health-related quality
      of life. The number of candesartan responders (reduction of > or =50% compared
      with placebo) was 18 (31.6%) of 57 for days with headache and 23 (40.4%) of 57
      for days with migraine. Adverse events were similar in the 2 periods. CONCLUSION:
      In this study, the angiotensin II receptor blocker candesartan provided effective
      migraine prophylaxis, with a tolerability profile comparable with that of
      placebo.

TI  - The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan when administered with norethindrone 1
      mg/ethinyl estradiol 0.035 mg in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 1887-901
AB  - BACKGROUND: Because the majority of migraineurs are young women in their peak
      reproductive years, it is important to understand the possible effects on the
      pharmacokinetics of both medications when sumatriptan is coadministered with an
      oral contraceptive (OC). OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to
      assess the effect of multiple dosing of the OC norethindrone 1 mg/ethinyl
      estradiol 0.035 mg (NE/EE) on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in 
      healthy volunteers. Secondary objectives were to determine the effect of a single
      dose of sumatriptan on the multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of NE and EE, and to
      assess the safety and tolerability of the combination. METHODS: This was an
      open-label, 1-sequence, crossover study in healthy women who had been receiving
      NE/EE for at least 3 months. Subjects received 1 cycle of NE/EE, consisting of 21
      days of OC and 7 days of placebo. They also received a single dose of sumatriptan
      50 mg on the last day of the OC or placebo regimen. Blood samples for the
      determination of plasma sumatriptan concentrations were collected on days 21 and 
      28, and blood samples for the determination of plasma NE and EE concentrations
      were collected on days 20 and 21. Treatments were compared by analysis of
      variance. Equivalence between treatments was to be concluded if the 90% Cl for
      the ratio of reference to test means for log(e)-transformed parameters (area
      under the plasma concentration-time curve [AUCI and maximum measured plasma
      concentration [C(max)]) for each analyte fell within the interval 0.80 to 1.25.
      RESULTS: Twenty-six women (mean age, 29.8 years; age range, 18-44 years; weight
      range, 52-82 kg) participated in the study. The 90% CI for the ratio of reference
      to test means for the AUC extrapolated to infinity (AUC(infinity)) of sumatriptan
      was 1.11 to 1.22, and the 90% CIs for the AUC over the dosing interval at steady 
      state (AUC(tau)) of NE and EE were 0.96 to 1.00 and 0.91 to 0.97, respectively.
      The 90% CIs for the ratio of reference to test means for the C(max) of
      sumatriptan, NE, and EE were a respective 1.05 to 1.30, 0.76 to 0.88, and 0.88 to
      1.04. Study treatments were well tolerated. Adverse events were mild or moderate,
      and there were no clinically significant changes in vital signs or laboratory
      values. CONCLUSIONS: The extent of absorption (AUC) of sumatriptan, NE, and EE
      was similar after oral administration of sumatriptan and NE/EE, both alone and in
      combination. Thus, in the opinion of the study investigators, there were no
      clinically relevant changes in the AUC of any of the medications when sumatriptan
      and NE/EE were administered concomitantly compared with administration alone. The
      results of this study suggest that dose adjustment is not necessary when
      sumatriptan is administered concomitantly with NE/EE in healthy premenopausal
      women.

TI  - Management of the acute migraine headache.
PG  - 2123-30
AB  - As many as 30 million Americans have migraine headaches. The impact on patients
      and their families can be tremendous, and treatment of migraines can present
      diagnostic and therapeutic challenges for family physicians. Abortive treatment
      options include nonspecific and migraine-specific therapy. Nonspecific therapies 
      include analgesics (aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and opiates), 
      adjunctive therapies (antiemetics and sedatives), and other nonspecific
      medications (intranasal lidocaine or steroids). Migraine-specific abortive
      therapies include ergotamine and its derivatives, and triptans. Complementary and
      alternative therapies can also be used to abort the headache or enhance the
      efficacy of another therapeutic modality. Treatment choices for acute migraine
      should be based on headache severity, migraine frequency, associated symptoms,
      and comorbidities.

TI  - Comparison of therapeutic gain with therapeutic ratio for the assessment of
      selective 5HT(1B/1D) agonist efficacy in migraine.
PG  - 680-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Comparison of use of therapeutic gain (TG) and therapeutic ratio (TR) 
      for relative assessments of selective 5HT(1B/1D) agonist efficacy in the acute
      treatment of migraine. BACKGROUND: Comparison of selective 5HT(1B/1D) agonist
      efficacy in the acute treatment of migraine is complicated by the impracticality 
      of conducting high-quality head-to-head active comparator trials for all
      permutations of drug, dose, and route of administration; the clinical trials that
      are available are usually noncontemporaneous, and have fluctuating active and
      placebo response rates (ARR and PRR, respectively) for the necessarily subjective
      endpoints. The standard primary endpoint is conversion of headache score 2
      (moderate pain) or score 3 (severe pain) into score 0 (no pain) or score 1 (mild 
      pain) at a single timepoint (usually 2 or 4 hours postdose). Two principal
      methods have been used for comparison of ARR between studies: TG = ARR - PRR and 
      TR = ARR/PRR. Secondary endpoints can be treated in the same way, although the
      24-hour remedication rate is the only secondary endpoint that is subject to
      regulatory authority standardization. Does either TG or TR have an advantage over
      the other? METHODS: Efficacy data were collected from published sources and
      included pain score conversion at 2- and 4-hour, as well as 24-hour remedication 
      rates. TG and TR were calculated for each endpoint, as shown above. The ranges of
      these variables were found from all observed measures. Correlations between TG
      and TR were found using least squares methods. The 95% confidence intervals (CI) 
      for TG and TR were then found for all clinical trials, and for the whole range of
      observed PRR. RESULTS: Values for TR and TG generally were well correlated for
      pain score conversion at 2 hours postdose (n = 51 clinical trials). Deviations
      from this correlation were greatest for drugs that were evidently very
      efficacious. When standardized for the observed ranges of PRR and ARR, the 95% CI
      for TR were narrower than for TG. A subset of these studies also reported 4-hour 
      data (n = 23 clinical trials), but the correlation between TR and TG was again
      good, with narrower 95% CI for TR than TG. For the 24-hour remedication data (n =
      18 trials), PRR was less variable; TR and TG again correlated well, but there was
      little difference in their relative 95% CI. CONCLUSIONS: For comparison of drugs 
      in noncontemporaneous studies, when PRR fluctuates, relative ranges for TR are
      narrower than for TG. For assessing single clinical trial results (ie, point
      estimates of efficacy) TR will generally be relatively nearer to its mean than
      TG. For both these reasons, TR is a more robust statistic than TG.

TI  - Triptans for migraine management in adolescents.
PG  - 675-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review triptan efficacy and tolerability data for adolescent
      migraine sufferers to assist clinicians in selecting triptans for this age group.
      BACKGROUND: Migraine is a common cause of headache among adolescents. To date, no
      medications, including those with proven headache relief in adults, have been
      approved for treatment of migraine in adolescents. METHODS: Recent triptan
      clinical trials conducted in adolescent migraine sufferers 12 to 17 years of age 
      were reviewed and results were summarized. RESULTS: The success of individual
      triptan clinical trials conducted in adolescent appears related to time to
      treatment (1.9 to 6 hours), placebo response (25% to 57%), and day of the week
      (weekday versus weekend). Overall, triptan tolerability in adolescents is similar
      to that reported in adults. CONCLUSION: Study results suggest that the triptan
      class of antimigraine drugs may effectively alleviate migraine in adolescents.
      Future research should address placebo response and earlier treatment paradigms.

TI  - Sumatriptan nasal spray for migraine: a review of studies in patients aged 17
      years and younger.
PG  - 704-9
AB  - This review considers the epidemiology, clinical manifestations and functional
      consequences of migraine in children and adolescents and surveys the studies
      establishing the efficacy and tolerability of sumatriptan nasal spray in this
      patient population. Although therapeutic advances in paediatric and adolescent
      migraine have lagged behind those in adult migraine, the first systematic studies
      of migraine medications in young patients have brought about progress in the past
      five years. These studies show that therapeutic approaches suitable for adult
      patients are not always applicable to paediatric and adolescent patients. Because
      of the unique characteristics of paediatric and adolescent migraine, it has been 
      difficult to demonstrate in young patients the efficacy of oral sumatriptan and
      other triptan tablets, which are the medications of choice for adult migraine.
      With sumatriptan, this finding has proven to be a consequence of the form in
      which the drug was administered rather than the inherent properties of the drug. 
      The availability of sumatriptan nasal spray allows the benefits of
      migraine-specific therapy to be extended to children and adolescents. In both
      well-controlled, single-episode studies and long-term, multiple-episode studies, 
      sumatriptan nasal spray has been effective and well tolerated for the acute
      treatment of migraine in children and adolescents. Except for unpleasant taste,
      which is not significantly distressing to patients, sumatriptan nasal spray has a
      tolerability profile similar to thatof placebo in young patients.

TI  - Safety of sumatriptan in pregnancy: a review of the data so far.
PG  - 1-7
AB  - The high prevalence of migraine in women during their reproductive years means
      that new drug treatments for migraine, such as the serotonin 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor
      agonists (the 'triptans'), are likely to be widely used by women of childbearing 
      potential. Scrutiny of these agents in an effort to detect any signal of
      teratogenicity is thus important. A systematic review of the medical literature
      was conducted to identify information regarding the safety of sumatriptan during 
      pregnancy. This agent was chosen to be investigated because it has been available
      for the longest and is the most widely used of the triptan class. Information was
      obtained regarding the impact of migraine on pregnancy outcome, and data on
      sumatriptan use in pregnancy were obtained from animal studies, preclinical drug 
      trials, postmarketing surveillance efforts, prospective pregnancy registries,
      national birth registries and teratogen information services. Synthesis of
      information from these sources is sufficient to rule out a large increase in
      birth defects from sumatriptan use during pregnancy and is reassuring for cases
      where inadvertent exposure to sumatriptan during pregnancy has occurred. However,
      current information is not sufficient to rule out small increases in the risk for
      birth defects. For this reason, caution should be exercised in making a positive 
      recommendation for the use of sumatriptan during pregnancy.

TI  - Absolute bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, and urinary excretion of the novel
      antimigraine agent almotriptan in healthy male volunteers.
PG  - 1303-10
AB  - Absolute bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, and urinary excretion of almotriptan,
      a novel 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonist, were studied in 18 healthy males following 
      single intravenous (i.v.) (3 mg), subcutaneous (s.c.) (6 mg), and oral (25 mg)
      doses. Volunteers received each dose in a randomized sequence separated by a
      7-day washout. Blood and urine samples for pharmacokinetic evaluations were taken
      for up to 24 hours after dosing. The disposition kinetics of almotriptan after
      i.v. and s.c. administration showed biphasic decline described by a
      two-compartment model. The fastest disposition phase was well observed, although 
      estimates of the rate constant showed high variability. After s.c. administration
      of almotriptan, the bioavailability was 100% with a time to maximum plasma
      concentration (tmax) of 5 to 15 minutes, whereas after oral administration, the
      bioavailability was about 70% with a tmax of 1.5 to 3.0 hours. No significant
      differences were observed between administration routes in the elimination
      half-life (t(1/2), obtaining mean values ranging from 3.4 to 3.6 hours. The
      volume of distribution, total clearance, and t(1/2) indicated that almotriptan
      was extensively distributed and rapidly cleared from the body irrespective of
      dose or route of administration. The primary route of elimination was renal
      clearance (approximately 50%-60% of total body clearance). About 65% of the i.v. 
      and s.c. dose and 45% of the oral dose were excreted unchanged in urine in 24
      hours, with nearly 90% of this in the first 12 hours. Renal clearance was
      approximately 2- to 3-fold that of the glomerular filtration rate in man,
      suggesting that almotriptan is eliminated in part by renal tubular secretion.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of almotriptan malate for migraine.
PG  - 2184-93
AB  - The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, and
      dosage and administration of almotriptan are reviewed. Migraine is a common
      disorder with a serious impact on quality of life. Newer serotonin-receptor
      agonists have been developed with the aim of improving pharmacokinetic
      characteristics. Almotriptan, a selective agonist of serotonin receptors 1B and
      1D, carries FDA-approved labeling for use in the management of migraine with or
      without aura in adults. The efficacy and receptor affinity resemble those of
      sumatriptan, but almotriptan has a more favorable pharmacokinetic profile. It has
      a rapid onset of action, an oral bioavailability of 70-80%, and a longer
      half-life than sumatriptan. In clinical trials, almotriptan has been
      significantly more effective than placebo and as effective as sumatriptan.
      However, it has been associated with better tolerability and greater patient
      satisfaction. In clinical trials, the most commonly reported adverse effects were
      nausea, dry mouth, dizziness, somnolence, fatigue, vomiting, and paresthesia.
      Almotriptan is contraindicated in patients with known ischemic heart disease,
      coronary vasospasm, and other significant cardiovascular disorders. Almotriptan
      has a lower acquisition cost than other triptans and possibly lower overall
      health care costs because of a lower frequency of cardiovascular adverse effects.
      The recommended dose of almotriptan is one 6.25- or 12.5-mg tablet given at the
      onset of symptoms. Almotriptan is effective for the management of migraine and
      offers the potential for fewer adverse effects than other agents in its class.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of antiepileptic drugs in migraine prophylaxis.
PG  - 978-83
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the cost-effectiveness of antiepileptics in migraine
      prophylaxis. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using efficacy 
      data from three recent, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trials of
      antiepileptic drugs studied for migraine prevention and cost data. Two measures
      of cost-effectiveness were used: cost per headache prevented and the
      cost-equivalent number. RESULTS: In the double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      clinical trials evaluated, three antiepileptic drugs were shown to be effective
      in migraine prevention. All three antiepileptic drugs had high costs per migraine
      reduced. Gabapentin was the most costly at dollars 138.00 per migraine prevented,
      whereas the cost per migraine prevented with topiramate was US dollars 114.80 and
      with divalproex sodium was US dollars 48.00. For migraine prevention divalproex
      sodium became cost-effective with 10 migraines per month, whereas gabapentin and 
      topiramate required considerably more migraines per month to be cost-effective.
      CONCLUSIONS: Antiepileptic drugs have proven effectiveness in migraine
      prophylaxis. However, in patients responsive to their acute care medications, the
      antiepileptic drugs are only cost-effective for those patients with a high
      frequency of migraines and those with comorbid diseases. Future studies should be
      done with antiepileptic drugs in patients exhibiting a migraine frequency of 10
      or more headaches per month.

TI  - Impact of migraine symptoms on health care use and work loss in Canada in
      patients randomly assigned in a phase III clinical trial.
PG  - 158-64
AB  - BACKGROUND: Migraine is prevalent and associated with substantial direct and
      indirect costs that may vary across geographic and national boundaries. The
      effects of migraine, self-reported by Canadians, on health care resource use as
      well as paid and unpaid work loss were examined. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The
      Migraine Background Questionnaire (MBQ) was self-administered during the
      screening visit of a phase III clinical trial of rizatriptan (a potent, selective
      5-hydroxytryptamine(1B/1D)-receptor agonist or 'triptan'). Patients suffering
      from moderate to severe migraine in the previous six months were offered the
      opportunity to participate. Migraine frequency was determined and costs were
      estimated and assigned based on known direct costs of health care resource
      utilization, and indirect costs of paid and unpaid work and productivity loss.
      RESULTS: One hundred thirty-four patients completed the MBQ. In the previous
      year, 89% of those patients reported visiting a clinic, 23% reported visiting an 
      emergency room and 5% reported being hospitalized for migraine. Patients reported
      an average of 6.5 days absent from work, 44 days working with migraine headache
      and 10.4 reduced workday equivalents due to ineffectiveness at work with
      migraine. Based on data obtained from the Ontario, the average overall annual
      cost due to migraine was estimated to be 3,025 dollars/patient; most of this
      (87%) due to indirect costs. CONCLUSION: In Canada, patients with moderate to
      severe migraine, as identified in a phase III clinical trial, reported lost work 
      days and reduced effectiveness while at work, as well as increased health care
      resource utilization due to migraine. The associated cost was estimated to be
      substantial.

TI  - Tinted spectacles and visually sensitive migraine.
PG  - 711-9
AB  - A double-masked randomized controlled study with cross-over design compared the
      effectiveness of precision ophthalmic tints in the prevention of headache in
      migraine sufferers. Seventeen patients chose the colour of light that optimally
      reduced perceptual distortion of text and maximized clarity and comfort. They
      were later given glasses with spectral filters providing optimal colour under
      conventional white lighting ('optimal' tint) or glasses that provided a slightly 
      different colour ('control' tint). The tints were supplied in random order, each 
      for 6 weeks, separated by an interval of at least 2 weeks with no tints. Headache
      diaries showed that the frequency of headaches was marginally lower when the
      'optimal' tint was worn, compared with the 'control'. The trial extends to adults
      with migraine, the results of a previous double-masked study demonstrating, in
      children with reading difficulty, beneficial effects of precision tints in
      reducing symptom frequency. In the present study, however, the effects are
      suggestive rather than conclusive.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics, dose proportionality, and tolerability of single and repeat
      doses of a nasal spray formulation of zolmitriptan in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 1244-50
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics, dose
      proportionality, and tolerability of a range of single and multiple doses of a
      nasal spray formulation of zolmitriptan in a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, balanced, incomplete crossover study. Thirty healthy male or 
      female volunteers received two of five dose levels of zolmitriptan nasal spray: 0
      (placebo), 0.5, 1, 2.5, and 5 mg. At each level, treatment comprised a single
      dose on day 1 and two doses (separated by 2 h) on each of days 2, 3, and 4.
      Zolmitriptan was well tolerated, and symptoms were generally mild and of short
      duration. The most commonly reported adverse events were taste disturbance,
      paresthesia, hyperesthesia, headache, and nasal/throat discomfort. Volunteers
      generally reported fewer adverse events during the multiple-dose phase than after
      the single-dose phase. Zolmitriptan was detectable in plasma within 15 minutes,
      and t(max) was similar for each dose and after single and multiple dosing. Dose
      proportionality was shown for the C(max) and AUC of both zolmitriptan and its
      active metabolite, 183C91. Mean t1/2 for zolmitriptan and 183C91 was
      approximately 3 hours. It was concluded that the pharmacokinetics (C(max) and
      AUC) for both zolmitriptan and 183C91 was proportional to dose after both single 
      and multiple dosing. Nasal spray zolmitriptan was well tolerated; the frequency
      and nature of adverse events did not increase after multiple dosing.

TI  - Preliminary studies of the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of zolmitriptan
      nasal spray in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 1237-43
AB  - Two preliminary studies of the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of zolmitriptan 
      nasal spray were conducted, each involving 12 healthy volunteers. In study 1, an 
      initial double-blind, dose escalation phase (placebo or 2.5, 5.0, or 10 mg
      zolmitriptan intranasally) was followed by an open crossover phase in which all
      subjects received 10 mg zolmitriptan as a nasal spray, tablet, and oral solution.
      In study 2, subjects received, on three separate occasions, zolmitriptan 2.5 mg
      as an intranasal solution at pH 7.4, at pH 5.0, and as an oral tablet. In study
      1, plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan and its active metabolite, 183C91, were 
      broadly dose proportional. Plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan were detected
      earlier following nasal spray administration than after either tablet or oral
      solution. Similarly, in study 2, zolmitriptan was absorbed more rapidly following
      nasal spray administration with detectable plasma concentrations 5 minutes after 
      dosing. Plasma levels were maintained at a plateau between 1 and 6 hours
      postdose, then decreased with a half-life of approximately 3 hours. There was no 
      statistically significant difference for AUG or C(max) values between the two
      nasal spray solutions or between nasal spray and oral formulations. Other
      pharmacokinetic parameters for zolmitriptan were similar between the
      formulations. Plasma concentrations of 183C91 were higher for the first 2 hours
      after oral than after nasal spray administration. All formulations of
      zolmitriptan were well tolerated.

TI  - St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum): drug interactions and clinical outcomes.
PG  - 349-56
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this work is to identify the medicines which interact with the
      herbal remedy St John's wort (SJW), and the mechanisms responsible. METHODS: A
      systematic review of all the available evidence, including worldwide published
      literature and spontaneous case reports provided by healthcare professionals and 
      regulatory authorities within Europe has been undertaken. RESULTS: A number of
      clinically significant interactions have been identified with prescribed
      medicines including warfarin, phenprocoumon, cyclosporin, HIV protease
      inhibitors, theophylline, digoxin and oral contraceptives resulting in a decrease
      in concentration or effect of the medicines. These interactions are probably due 
      to the induction of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP1A2 and the
      transport protein P-glycoprotein by constituent(s) in SJW. The degree of
      induction is unpredictable due to factors such as the variable quality and
      quantity of constituent(s) in SJW preparations. In addition, possible
      pharmacodynamic interactions with selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors and
      serotonin (5-HT(1d)) receptor-agonists such as triptans used to treat migraine
      were identified. These interactions are associated with an increased risk of
      adverse reactions. CONCLUSIONS: In Sweden and the UK the potential risks to
      patients were judged to be significant and therefore information about the
      interactions was provided to health care professionals and patients. The product 
      information of the licensed medicines involved has been amended to reflect these 
      newly identified interactions and SJW preparations have been voluntarily labelled
      with appropriate warnings.

TI  - Decreased sensitivity of 5-HT1D receptors in chronic tension-type headache.
PG  - 709-14
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the sensitivity of 5-HT1D receptors in chronic tension-type 
      headache using sumatriptan as a pharmacological probe. BACKGROUND: Previous
      studies have suggested involvement of serotonergic systems in chronic
      tension-type headache (CTTH), but relevant experimental data are limited.
      Sumatriptan, a 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist, stimulates the release of growth
      hormone (GH) and inhibits the release of ACTH, cortisol, and prolactin. These
      effects may be used to explore the function of serotonergic systems in vivo.
      METHODS: We measured GH, ACTH, cortisol and prolactin (PRL) plasma concentrations
      in 15 patients with chronic tension-type headache and in 18 healthy controls
      after subcutaneous administration of sumatriptan (6 mg) or placebo. RESULTS:
      Placebo administration had no effect on hormone concentrations. GH and PRL
      secretion after sumatriptan administration was significantly (P<0.01 and <0.05)
      altered in CTTH patients in comparison with controls. CONCLUSION: Our results
      suggest that cerebral serotonergic functions mediated by 5-HT1D receptors are
      altered in CTTH.

TI  - Further evaluation of rizatriptan in menstrual migraine: retrospective analysis
      of long-term data.
PG  - 917-23
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the long-term efficacy of oral rizatriptan 10-mg wafers
      in the treatment of menstrual migraine attacks. METHODS: Data from an extension
      study where patients with migraine used rizatriptan 10 mg to treat moderate or
      severe migraine attacks occurring over periods of up to 6 months were included in
      a retrospective analysis. Patients used a diary card to record details of each
      migraine attack and onset of menstruation. Attacks in women were classified as
      menstrual or nonmenstrual according to 3 time windows relative to onset of
      menstruation (day 0): -3 to +3 days (7-day window), -2 to + 2 days (5-day
      window), and 0 to +1 days (2-day window). The analysis looked at the efficacy of 
      rizatriptan 10 mg by menstrual category of attack for each definition on three
      measures: pain relief at 2 hours (reduction of pain to mild or none), pain free
      at 2 hours, 24-hours sustained pain free (pain free at 2 hours with no headache
      recurrence and no use of additional medications from 2 to 24 hours). RESULTS:
      Ninety-five women used rizatriptan 10 mg to treat a total of 1,839 attacks. The
      percentage of menstrual attacks was 30% for the -3 to +3 days definition, 23% for
      the -2 to +2 days definition, and 11% for the 0 to +1 days definition.
      Rizatriptan 10 mg was equally effective in menstrual and nonmenstrual migraine
      attacks regardless of the definition used. For example, using the -3 to +3 days
      definition, 78% of menstrual migraine attacks were relieved at 2 hours after
      dosing compared with 78% of nonmenstrual attacks. Pain relief rates for the other
      definitions were as follows: -2 to +2 days, menstrual = 78%, nonmenstrual = 78%; 
      0 to +1 days, menstrual = 79%, and nonmenstrual = 78%. No differences between
      menstrual and nonmenstrual attacks were found for the 2-hour pain free and
      24-hour sustained pain free measures for any of the three definitions.
      CONCLUSIONS: Rizatriptan 10-mg wafers were equally effective in the treatment of 
      menstrual and nonmenstrual migraine attacks occurring over 6 months, regardless
      of the precise definition of menstrual association used and even when the outcome
      criteria were very stringent. These data provide further evidence that triptans
      are effective treatments for menstrual migraine.

TI  - Triptans versus analgesics.
PG  - 903-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To retrospectively assess patient preferences between triptans and
      analgesics in treating migraine headache. METHODS: The study assessed patient
      preferences for triptans versus commonly used migraine analgesic preparations.
      Over a 3-month period, 663 patients with migraine between the ages of 17 and 62
      years completed an office-based survey. RESULTS: Most patients preferred a
      treatment regimen that included either a triptan alone (52%) or a triptan with an
      analgesic medication within 1 hour (18%). Overall, 70% of patients who had been
      given triptans in the past chose to continue to use them, either alone or with an
      analgesic. Patients who preferred analgesics alone comprised 21% of the total.
      Nine percent preferred not to take either triptans or analgesic medications.
      Among the patients who preferred triptans, 62% stated that increased efficacy was
      the primary reason for their preference. Thirty percent cited both efficacy and
      decreased adverse events. The remaining 8% believed that decreased adverse events
      was the basis for their preference. CONCLUSIONS: Despite cost and other
      limitations of triptans, most patients prefer them over nontriptan medications.
      Enhanced efficacy was the main reason for choosing triptans over analgesics.

TI  - Sum of Pain Intensity Differences (SPID) in migraine trials. A comment based on
      four rizatriptan trials.
PG  - 664-6
AB  - Sum of Pain Intensity Difference (SPID) is an outcome measure that summarizes
      treatment response over a clinically relevant period. SPID is widely reported in 
      clinical trials of analgesics but has been little used in migraine trials. We
      compared SPID over 2 h with the standard migraine outcome measures of pain-free
      at 2 h and headache relief at 2 h using data from four published clinical trials 
      of rizatriptan in migraine patients. In assessing treatment response (rizatriptan
      and sumatriptan versus placebo, rizatriptan versus sumatriptan, within-treatment 
      dose effects), SPID usually yielded similar results to the more easily understood
      pain-free measure.

TI  - Triptans (serotonin, 5-HT1B/1D agonists) in migraine: detailed results and
      methods of a meta-analysis of 53 trials.
PG  - 633-58
AB  - The triptans, selective serotonin 5-HT1B/1D agonists, are very effective acute
      migraine drugs. Soon, seven different triptans will be clinically available at 13
      different oral doses, making evidence-based selection guidelines necessary.
      Triptan trials have similar designs, facilitating meta-analysis. We wished to
      provide an evidence-based foundation for using triptans in clinical practice, and
      to review the methodological issues surrounding triptan trials. We asked
      pharmaceutical companies and the principal investigators of company-independent
      trials for the 'raw patient data' of all double-blind, randomized, controlled,
      clinical trials with oral triptans in migraine. All data were cross-checked with 
      published or presented data. We calculated summary estimates across studies for
      important efficacy and tolerability parameters, and compared these with those
      from direct, head-to-head, comparator trials. Out of 76 eligible clinical trials,
      53 (12 not yet published) involving 24089 patients met the criteria for
      inclusion. Mean results (and 95% confidence intervals) for sumatriptan 100 mg,
      the first available and most widely prescribed oral triptan, are 59% (57-60) for 
      2 h headache response (improvement from moderate or severe to mild or no pain);
      29% (27-30) for 2 h pain free (improvement to no pain); 20% (18-21) for sustained
      pain free (pain free by 2 h and no headache recurrence or use of rescue
      medication 2-24 h post-dose), and 67% (63-70) for consistency (response in at
      least two out of three treated attacks); placebo-subtracted proportions for
      patients with at least one adverse event (AE) are 13% (8-18), for at least one
      central nervous system AE 6% (3-9), and for at least one chest AE 1.9% (1.0-2.7).
      Compared with these data: rizatriptan 10 mg shows better efficacy and
      consistency, and similar tolerability; eletriptan 80 mg shows better efficacy,
      similar consistency, but lower tolerability; almotriptan 12.5 mg shows similar
      efficacy at 2 h but better sustained pain-free response, consistency, and
      tolerability; sumatriptan 25 mg, naratriptan 2.5 mg and eletriptan 20 mg show
      lower efficacy and better tolerability; zolmitriptan 2.5 mg and 5 mg, eletriptan 
      40 mg, and rizatriptan 5 mg show very similar results. The results of the 22
      trials that directly compared triptans show the same overall pattern. We received
      no data on frovatriptan, but publicly available data suggest substantially lower 
      efficacy. The major methodological issues involve the choice of the primary
      endpoint, consistency over multiple attacks, how to evaluate headache recurrence,
      use of placebo-subtracted proportions to control for across-study differences,
      and the difference between tolerability and safety. In addition, there are a
      number of methodological issues specific for direct comparator trials, including 
      encapsulation and patient selection. At marketed doses, all oral triptans are
      effective and well tolerated. Differences among them are in general relatively
      small, but clinically relevant for individual patients. Rizatriptan 10 mg,
      eletriptan 80 mg and almotriptan 12.5 mg provide the highest likelihood of
      consistent success. Sumatriptan features the longest clinical experience and the 
      widest range of formulations. All triptans are contra-indicated in the presence
      of cardiovascular disease.

TI  - New drugs with novel therapeutic characteristics. Have they been subject to
      randomized controlled trials?
PG  - 1487-92
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine how many randomized controlled trials on the safety or
      efficacy of new drugs are published when these drugs are first marketed in
      Canada, and to determine the quality of the information in those trials. DESIGN: 
      A MEDLINE search was conducted on each drug identified as having novel
      therapeutic characteristics and first marketed between 1990 and 2000. MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of trials dealing with the safety or efficacy of each
      drug published at the time the drug was marketed. Number of patients taking the
      study drug, length of the trial, and type of control. RESULTS: The number of
      trials varied substantially. For some drugs, there were more than 20 studies; for
      others only a single study. Many trials were small and short-term, and used
      placebo controls. CONCLUSION: Too few trials or inadequate trials on the safety
      and efficacy of new drugs are published when these drugs are first marketed in
      Canada. The lack of published trials means that physicians do not know whether
      results are generalizable to their patients, how to position the drug in relation
      to other treatments, or whether the drugs have long-term safety and efficacy.

TI  - Statins as immunomodulators: comparison with interferon-beta 1b in MS.
PG  - 990-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent data suggest that statins may be potent immunomodulatory
      agents. In order to evaluate the potential role of statins as immunomodulators in
      MS, the authors studied their immunologic effects in vitro and compared them to
      interferon (IFN)beta-1b. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)
      obtained from untreated or IFN beta-1-treated patients with relapsing-remitting
      MS or from healthy donors (HD) and T cells were stimulated with concanavalin A,
      phytohemagglutinin, or antibody to CD3 in the presence of lovastatin,
      simvastatin, mevastatin, IFN beta-1b, or statins plus IFN beta-1b. The authors
      analyzed proliferative activity of T cells and B cells, cytokine production and
      release, activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), and surface expression of
      activation markers, adhesion molecules, and chemokine receptors on both T and B
      cells. RESULTS: All three statins inhibited proliferation of stimulated PBMC in a
      dose-dependent manner, with simvastatin being the most potent, followed by
      lovastatin and mevastatin. IFN beta-1b showed a similar effect; statins and IFN
      beta-1b together added their inhibitory potentials. Furthermore, statins reduced 
      the expression of activation-induced adhesion molecules on T cells, modified the 
      T helper 1/T helper 2 cytokine balance, reduced MMP-9, and downregulated
      chemokine receptors on both B and T cells. Besides strong anti-inflammatory
      properties, statins also exhibited some proinflammatory effects. CONCLUSIONS:
      Statins are effective immunomodulators in vitro that merit evaluation as
      treatment for MS.

TI  - Spotlight on rizatriptan in migraine.
PG  - 715-20
AB  - Rizatriptan is an orally active serotonin 5-HT(1) receptor agonist that potently 
      and selectively binds to 5-HT(1B/1D) subtypes. Earlier clinical trials
      demonstrated that rizatriptan 5 or 10mg is more effective than placebo at
      providing pain relief and a pain-free state, relieving associated symptoms of
      migraine, normalising functional ability and improving patient quality of life,
      and showed that rizatriptan provides faster freedom from pain and reduces nausea 
      to a greater extent than oral sumatriptan. More recently, rizatriptan 10mg was
      shown to be more effective than zolmitriptan 2.5mg or naratriptan 2.5mg at
      producing a pain-free state 2 hours postdose. Furthermore, compared with
      naratriptan, significantly more patients who received rizatriptan were pain free 
      or had pain relief from 1 hour onwards. The number of patients with normal
      functional ability at 2 hours was significantly higher after rizatriptan than
      after naratriptan or zolmitriptan. Rizatriptan was also generally more effective 
      than zolmitriptan or naratriptan at relieving migraine-associated symptoms.
      Rizatriptan is generally well tolerated, and adverse events are usually mild and 
      transient. The most common adverse events associated with rizatriptan in recent
      randomised trials were asthenia/fatigue, dizziness, somnolence and nausea. There 
      was a trend towards a lower incidence of adverse events with rizatriptan compared
      with zolmitriptan (31.2 vs 38.8%). However, rizatriptan was associated with a
      significantly higher incidence of adverse events than naratriptan (39 vs 29%).
      The incidence of chest pain was similar after the administration of rizatriptan, 
      zolmitriptan or naratriptan (2-4%). In conclusion, rizatriptan is an effective
      drug for the acute treatment of moderate or severe migraine. Oral rizatriptan 5
      and 10mg have shown greater efficacy than placebo in providing pain relief, an
      absence of pain, relief from associated symptoms, normal functional ability and
      an improvement in patient quality of life. Earlier results showed that
      rizatriptan provides faster freedom from pain and reduces nausea to a greater
      extent than oral sumatriptan. More recent studies have shown that rizatriptan
      10mg provides faster pain relief and a higher percentage of patients with an
      absence of pain and normal functional ability at 2 hours than naratriptan 2.5mg
      or zolmitriptan 2.5mg. The efficacy of rizatriptan is retained when used in the
      long term, and the drug is generally well tolerated. Although well designed
      studies comparing rizatriptan with almotriptan, eletriptan and frovatriptan would
      further define the position of rizatriptan, current data suggest that rizatriptan
      should be considered as a first-line treatment option in the management of
      migraine.

TI  - Prospective study designs in outcomes research: the case of migraine.
PG  - 715-25
AB  - Patient-reported outcomes (PROs), including resource utilisation, productivity
      and quality of life, are important outcomes in the field of migraine. Clinical
      trials have begun to incorporate PROs; however, not all research questions can be
      answered fully within the framework of a clinical trial design. Other prospective
      designs, including effectiveness trials, observational studies, and study hybrids
      may be used to answer many of the different research questions related to PROs.
      This paper reviews prospective study designs, their strengths and weaknesses, and
      examples of their application in migraine health-outcomes research. Guidance is
      provided for researchers in the selection of prospective research designs and the
      incorporation of PROs-research objectives.

TI  - Selegiline: a second look. Six years later: too risky in Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 108-11
AB  - (1) The reference treatment for Parkinson's disease is levodopa plus a peripheral
      dopadecarboxylase inhibitor (benserazide or carbidopa). (2) In 1996, selegiline, 
      a type B MAOI marketed in France since 1988, saw its indications extended to
      cover single-agent therapy of early-stage Parkinson's disease, and in combination
      with levodopa, before onset of complications of levodopa therapy. The initial
      clinical file failed to show that selegiline had any benefit in these
      indications. (3) Now, in 2002, new data from trials involving hundreds of
      untreated patients show that selegiline postpones the need for levodopa therapy
      for a few months but fails to substantially alter the progression of Parkinson's 
      disease. (4) A clinical trial and a retrospective epidemiological study of
      patients with advanced Parkinson's disease showed excess mortality on selegiline.
      (5) The side effects of selegiline are similar to those of other antiparkinsonian
      drugs and amphetamine. Notable side effects include cardiovascular problems
      (postural hypotension, atrial fibrillation and arterial hypertension). (6)
      Selegiline can cause a serotoninergic syndrome and arterial hypertension, so must
      not be combined with pethidine, tramadol, bupropion, sumatriptan, zolmitriptan or
      naratriptan. Concurrent treatment with serotonin reuptake inhibitor
      antidepressants should also be avoided. (7) Given the only moderate effects of
      selegiline in Parkinson's disease, and the possibility of a slight increase in
      mortality, there is no justification for prescribing this medication in patients 
      with Parkinson's disease. (8) Whatever the stage of Parkinson's disease, there is
      no justification for starting patients on selegiline. Patients who are already
      taking selegiline should only continue to take it if they feel a clear benefit
      and are free from risk factors for early mortality, especially cardiovascular
      disease.

TI  - Global trends in migraine care: results from the MAZE survey.
PG  - 13-8
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Many patients with migraine do not consult a physician, or do not
      achieve adequate relief after consulting a physician because of undertreatment.
      The objective of the Migraine and Zomig Evaluation study was to provide insights 
      into the management of migraine in the general population. METHODS: In phase I,
      5553 members of the general public in the UK, France, Germany, Italy, and the US 
      were interviewed by telephone and classified according to International Headache 
      Society criteria. The Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) questionnaire 
      was used to assess the impact of migraine on work, home and social lives. In
      phase II, 516 patients with clinically diagnosed migraine were interviewed to
      assess the impact of migraine on daily life, attitudes towards migraine,
      perceptions of current treatments and aspirations for future treatments. RESULTS:
      In phase I, the average prevalence of migraine over the five countries was 9%.
      Migraine posed a significant burden in terms of the impact on patients' daily
      lives, and attack severity and frequency. However, medical consultation rates
      were low; reasons for this included patients not recognising that they had
      migraine or having low expectations about treatment benefits. On average, only
      10% of patients who had consulted a physician had been prescribed a triptan. Only
      22% of participants in phase II thought that migraine did not markedly affect
      their lives. In each of the five countries, > or = 50% of patients required bed
      rest to manage migraine attacks, demonstrating the impact of migraine-related
      disability on patients' lives. Assessment of MIDAS scores confirmed the
      debilitating effect of migraine; > 50% of respondents had a MIDAS grade of III or
      IV, indicating moderate or severe disability. Less than one-third of patients
      reported that their current medication was consistently effective and only 36%
      were 'very satisfied' with their current therapy. High efficacy and rapid pain
      relief were rated as the most important attributes of migraine medications. When 
      asked which formulation they would like to see more of, most patients chose a
      tablet that dissolves in the mouth without the need to take liquids. CONCLUSIONS:
      These results show that migraine patients worldwide are still not receiving
      adequate treatment and there remains a significant unmet need in migraine care.
      The challenge for the future is to diagnose migraine early and offer patients
      effective migraine-specific therapies. Physicians particularly need to reach
      patients who do not realise they have migraine and those who have lapsed from
      care.

TI  - Clinical pharmacokinetics of intranasal sumatriptan.
PG  - 801-11
AB  - A substantial proportion of migraine patients have gastric stasis and suffer
      severe nausea and/or vomiting during their migraine attack. This may lead to
      erratic absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and make oral treatment
      unsatisfactory. For such patients, an intranasal formulation may be advantageous.
      Sumatriptan is a potent serotonin 5HT(1B/1D) agonist widely used in the treatment
      of migraine; the effectiveness of the intranasal formulation (20mg) has been well
      established in several clinical studies. This article reviews the
      pharmacokinetics of intranasal sumatriptan and includes comparisons with oral and
      subcutaneous administration. After intranasal administration, sumatriptan is
      directly and rapidly absorbed, with 60% of the maximum plasma concentration
      (C(max)) occurring at 30 minutes after administration of a single 20mg dose.
      Following intranasal administration, approximately 10% more sumatriptan is
      absorbed probably via the nasal mucosa when compared with oral administration.
      Mean C(max) after a 20mg intranasal dose is approximately 13.1 to 14.4 ng/mL,
      with median time to C(max) approximately 1 to 1.75 hours. When given as a single 
      dose, intranasal sumatriptan displays dose proportionality in its extent of
      absorption and C(max) over the dose range 5 to 10mg, but not between 5 and 20mg
      for C(max). The elimination phase half-life is approximately 2 hours, consistent 
      with administration by other routes. Sumatriptan is metabolised by monoamine
      oxidase (MAO; predominantly the A isozyme, MAO-A) to an inactive metabolite.
      Coadministration with a MAO-A inhibitor, moclobemide, leads to a significant
      increase in sumatriptan plasma concentrations and is contraindicated. Single-dose
      pharmacokinetics in paediatric and adolescent patients following intranasal
      sumatriptan were studied to determine the effect of changes in nasal morphology
      during growth, and of body size, on pharmacokinetic parameters. The
      pharmacokinetic profile observed in adults was maintained in the adolescent
      population; generally, factors such as age, bodyweight or height did not
      significantly affect the pharmacokinetics. In children below 12 years, C(max) is 
      comparable to that seen in adolescents and adults, but total exposure (area under
      the concentration-time curve from zero to infinity) was lower in children
      compared with older patients, especially in younger children treated with 5mg.
      Clinical experience suggests that intranasal sumatriptan has some advantages over
      the tablet (more rapid onset of effect and use in patients with gastrointestinal 
      complaints) or subcutaneous (noninvasive and fewer adverse events) formulations.

TI  - Non-invasive assessment of selective 5-HT(1B/1D)-receptor agonist-induced
      peripheral vascular effects in humans: comparison of different techniques.
PG  - 303-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the sensitivity of three non-invasive techniques for
      detecting serotonin (5-HT)(1B/1D)-receptor agonist-induced peripheral vascular
      effects in humans: the measurement of (1) systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP)
      blood pressures, (2) dorsal hand vein (DHV) diameter and (3) toe-arm systolic
      blood pressure gradient (DeltaSBP(toe-arm)). METHODS: A double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, three-way, cross-over study was performed in 12 healthy male 
      volunteers. According to a randomly assigned allocation schedule, subjects were
      administered sumatriptan 3 mg, sumatriptan 6 mg or placebo subcutaneously.
      Measurements were performed at baseline, every 5 min for 30 min and at 40 min and
      60 min after drug administration. SBP and DBP were recorded using a
      semi-automated oscillometric device. DHV diameter was measured using a linear
      variable differential transformer. DeltaSBP(toe-arm) was calculated after
      measuring toe and arm SBP with a strain-gauge technique. Sensitivity was
      evaluated with responsiveness statistics. RESULTS: Based on weighted mean and
      compared with placebo, sumatriptan 3 mg and 6 mg increased SBP by 3.3 mmHg (
      P=0.023) and 6.4 mmHg ( P<0.001) and DBP by 5.0 mmHg ( P=0.006) and 7.5 mmHg (
      P<0.001), respectively. Sumatriptan 3 mg and 6 mg decreased DHV diameter by 36% (
      P=0.015) and 40% ( P=0.005), respectively. DeltaSBP(toe-arm) did not change. Peak
      changes were observed within 10-15 min after drug administration. The rank order 
      of responsiveness was: BP > DHV diameter > DeltaSBP(toe-arm.) CONCLUSIONS:
      Clinically relevant doses of subcutaneous sumatriptan increased blood pressure
      and decreased DHV diameter without affecting DeltaSBP(toe-arm). The increase in
      blood pressure appeared to be dose dependent. Compared with DHV diameter and
      DeltaSBP(toe-arm), blood pressure measurement appeared to be the most sensitive
      technique for detecting selective 5-HT(1B/1D)-receptor agonist-induced peripheral
      vascular effects in humans.

TI  - Intravenous valproate sodium in the treatment of daily headache.
PG  - 519-22
AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment of chronic daily headache/transformed migraine is
      challenging, especially when it is complicated by overuse of analgesics,
      triptans, or both. One common approach involves the use of repetitive intravenous
      dihydroergotamine. We investigated the use of intravenous valproate sodium in the
      treatment of chronic daily headache/transformed migraine in patients who had
      contraindications to the use of or had failed treatment with dihydroergotamine.
      METHODS: We administered intravenous valproate sodium (Depacon) to patients with 
      chronic daily headache/transformed migraine (loading dose 15 mg/kg, followed by 5
      mg/kg every 8 hours). All analgesics and triptans were discontinued prior to
      treatment with divalproex sodium, and preventative medications for migraine were 
      begun or continued. All patients received instruction in behavioral modification 
      and the proper use of analgesics and triptans. RESULTS: Improvement in headache
      was reported by 80% of the patients treated, and valproate sodium was tolerated
      well by most. CONCLUSION: Intravenous valproate sodium may be of assistance in
      the initial management of patients with chronic daily headache/transformed
      migraine and analgesic/triptan overuse, especially when dihydroergotamine is
      ineffective or contraindicated.

TI  - The pharmacokinetics of the antimigraine compound zolmitriptan in Japanese and
      Caucasian subjects.
PG  - 247-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: Zolmitriptan is a 5HT(1B/1D) receptor agonist effective in the acute 
      treatment of migraine. Clinical trials in the USA and Europe have demonstrated
      the optimal oral therapeutic dose to be 2.5 mg. The 2.5-mg oral tablet has
      recently been licensed in Japan. OBJECTIVE: To compare the pharmacokinetics of
      zolmitriptan and its metabolites in Japanese and Caucasian subjects and evaluate 
      the effect of gender on these pharmacokinetics in Japanese volunteers. METHODS:
      In this open, parallel-group study, 30 Japanese and 30 Caucasian volunteers
      (20-45 years) received a single 2.5-mg zolmitriptan tablet in the fasting state. 
      Blood samples were taken up to 15 h post-dose to determine plasma concentrations 
      of zolmitriptan and its active metabolite, 183C91. Urinary excretion of
      zolmitriptan, 183C91 and the inactive N-oxide and indole acetic acid metabolites 
      were measured over 24 h. RESULTS: Japanese volunteers were, on average, smaller
      and lighter than Caucasian volunteers. Plasma-concentration profiles of
      zolmitriptan and 183C91 were similar in the two groups. Although geometric mean
      zolmitriptan and 183C91 area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and 
      maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) were slightly higher in Japanese subjects
      (up to 20%), these differences were not considered to be of clinical relevance as
      the 90% confidence interval for the ratio of AUCs fell within pre-specified
      limits (0.67 to 1.5). Mean zolmitriptan and 183C91 half-lives were around 2.5 h
      for both populations. Urinary excretion of the four analytes was similar in
      Japanese and Caucasians. Plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan were higher in
      Japanese females than males (AUC 40% and C(max) 29% higher), consistent with the 
      results previously obtained in Caucasians. CONCLUSION: Pharmacokinetic parameters
      of zolmitriptan were similar between Caucasian and Japanese volunteers.

TI  - Almotriptan is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for migraine pain:
      results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.
PG  - 453-61
AB  - Almotriptan is a novel and specific serotonin 5-HT1B/1D agonist for the acute
      treatment of migraine. This randomized, single-dose, double-blind, multicentre,
      study assessed the efficacy and safety of oral almotriptan (12.5 mg and 25 mg) in
      patients with migraine, and compared it with the standard treatment (sumatriptan 
      100 mg) and placebo. A total of 668 patients treated one migraine attack of
      moderate or severe intensity with study medication. The primary efficacy
      assessment was migraine pain relief, improvement from severe or moderate pain to 
      mild or no pain, at 2 h after treatment. Response rates, stratified for variation
      in baseline pain levels, for both almotriptan doses were equivalent to
      sumatriptan and significantly better than placebo. Other efficacy assessments
      confirmed the equivalence of the almotriptan groups with the sumatriptan group.
      Almotriptan 12.5 mg was as well tolerated as placebo (P=0.493) and significantly 
      better tolerated than sumatriptan (P<0.001), in terms of the overall incidence of
      adverse events. There was no statistically significant difference in the
      incidence of adverse events between almotriptan 25 mg and sumatriptan 100 mg
      (P=0.376). The results from this large clinical study indicate that the new,
      specific 5-HT1B/1D agonist, almotriptan, is an effective and well-tolerated
      treatment for migraine pain.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of eletriptan 20 mg, 40 mg and 80 mg in Japanese migraineurs.
PG  - 416-23
AB  - This prospective multicentre, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group,
      placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of a single dose of
      eletriptan 20 mg, 40 mg and 80 mg in Japanese migraineurs. A total of 402 adult
      Japanese migraineurs were diagnosed using International Headache Society (IHS)
      criteria. At 2 h after a single dose, the headache response rates of eletriptan
      20 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg and placebo were 64%, 67%, 76% and 51%, respectively, with
      all doses significantly superior to placebo (P<0.05). Eletriptan had a
      statistically significant dose response for headache relief and pain-free
      response at 2 h post-dose (P=0.0011 and P=0.0291, respectively). Most
      all-causality adverse events were mild and there were no deaths or
      discontinuations. Saliva samples were used to assess serum eletriptan levels 2 h 
      post-dose. Pharmacokinetic evaluations showed no clinically significant
      differences between Japanese and Western subjects. Eletriptan was shown to be
      efficacious, safe, and well tolerated in Japanese migraineurs.

TI  - Headache in primary care: how important is diagnosis to management?
PG  - 569-73
AB  - Headache is a common presentation in primary care. The classification of headache
      was overhauled by the International Headache Society (IHS) in 1988, and the past 
      decade has seen rapid growth in the understanding of headache disorders. The IHS 
      places particular importance on precise headache diagnosis. This paper discusses 
      the relevance of such an approach to primary care. A review of the literature
      revealed a dearth of evidence regarding headache management in primary care
      settings. The evidence from other settings is considered and gaps in the
      literature highlighted.

TI  - Mechanisms of action of the 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonists.
PG  - 1084-8
AB  - Recent studies of the pathophysiology of migraine provide evidence that the
      headache phase is associated with multiple physiologic actions. These actions
      include the release of vasoactive neuropeptides by the trigeminovascular system, 
      vasodilation of intracranial extracerebral vessels, and increased nociceptive
      neurotransmission within the central trigeminocervical complex. The 5-HT(1B/1D)
      receptor agonists, collectively known as triptans, are a major advance in the
      treatment of migraine. The beneficial effects of the triptans in patients with
      migraine are related to their multiple mechanisms of action at sites implicated
      in the pathophysiology of migraine. These mechanisms are mediated by 5-HT(1B/1D) 
      receptors and include vasoconstriction of painfully dilated cerebral blood
      vessels, inhibition of the release of vasoactive neuropeptides by trigeminal
      nerves, and inhibition of nociceptive neurotransmission. The high affinity of the
      triptans for 5-HT(1B/1D) receptors and their favorable pharmacologic properties
      contribute to the beneficial effects of these drugs, including rapid onset of
      action, effective relief of headache and associated symptoms, and low incidence
      of adverse effects.

TI  - The effect of rizatriptan, ergotamine, and their combination on human peripheral 
      arteries: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in normal subjects.
PG  - 38-44
AB  - AIMS: To compare the peripheral vasoconstrictor effects of ergotamine,
      rizatriptan, and their combination, in normal subjects. METHODS: This was a
      double-blind, four-way, crossover study. Sixteen young male volunteers, selected 
      as responders to the vasoconstrictor effect of 0.5 mg ergotamine i.v., were
      administered 10 mg oral rizatriptan, 0.25 mg i.v. ergotamine, 10 mg oral
      rizatriptan+0.25 mg i.v. ergotamine, and placebo. The vasoconstrictor effect on
      peripheral arteries was measured with strain gauge plethysmography up to 8 h
      after dosing. The 8 h assessment period was divided into two 4 h intervals to
      assess the immediate (0-4 h) vs sustained effect (4-8 h) of treatment. RESULTS:
      For the 0-4 h interval, the decreases in peripheral systolic blood pressure
      gradients were: placebo (-1 mmHg [95% CI: -3, 1])<rizatriptan (-5 mmHg [95% CI:
      -7, -3])<ergotamine (-15 mmHg [95% CI: -16, -13])=rizatriptan+ergotamine (-15
      mmHg [95% CI: -17, -13]). For the 4-8 h interval, the decreases were: placebo (-5
      mmHg [95% CI: -8, -3])=rizatriptan (-8 mmHg [95% CI: -11, -5])<ergotamine (-26
      mmHg [95% CI: -29, -24])=rizatriptan+ergotamine (-28 mmHg [95% CI: -31, -26]).
      CONCLUSIONS: In normal subjects, rizatriptan 10 mg orally had only a small
      transient vasoconstrictor effect on peripheral arteries compared with the
      sustained and more pronounced effect of 0.25 mg i.v. ergotamine. Furthermore,
      rizatriptan exerted no additional effect on ergotamine-induced constriction of
      peripheral arteries when the two drugs were given in combination.

TI  - Serotonergic modulating drugs for functional gastrointestinal diseases.
PG  - 11-20
AB  - After many years of basic research we have now begun to learn how to manipulate
      the serotonergic mechanisms within the gut. This has lead to a number of
      significant advances including 5HT3 antagonists for the treatment of functional
      diarrhoea, 5HT4 agonists for the treatment of constipation and 5HT1 agonists for 
      the treatment of impaired fundal relaxation. Initial enthusiasm has been somewhat
      dented by the withdrawal of alosetron because of ischaemic colitis, but it
      remains to be seen whether this adverse event will be seen with other 5HT3
      antagonists. Finally it should be recognized that, in a substantial proportion of
      patients attending clinics complaining of functional symptoms, anxiety is a major
      component. The drugs so far described are by and large devoid of CNS effects. It 
      remains possible therefore that a drug which combines both peripheral and central
      effects would likely to be beneficial.

TI  - Rizatriptan combined with rofecoxib vs. rizatriptan for the acute treatment of
      migraine: an open label pilot study.
PG  - 309-12
AB  - Rizatriptan is an effective and fast acting drug for the acute treatment of
      migraine. As with any other acute treatment for migraine, headache recurrence may
      occur in up to one-third of responders. Combination with non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) seems to reduce the incidence of headache
      recurrence in clinical practice. Rofecoxib is a member of a new class of NSAIDs, 
      which selectively inhibits the COX-2 enzyme and therefore is associated with a
      lower risk of gastrointestinal side-effects; the drug has a long plasma half-life
      (17 h). This open label study compared rizatriptan with rizatriptan plus
      rofecoxib in the acute treatment of migraine. Fifty-six triptan naive patients
      from a tertiary centre (37 women and 19 men, ages 16-55 years, mean 35 years)
      with International Headache Society migraine were randomized into two groups.
      They were instructed to treat three consecutive moderate or severe attacks with
      either 10 mg rizatriptan (group 1: 18 women and 10 men) or with 10 mg rizatriptan
      plus 25 mg rofecoxib (group 2: 19 women and 9 men). The presence of headache and 
      nausea at 1, 2 and 4 h, and of side-effects, use of rescue medication and
      recurrence were compared. Fifty-four patients completed the study. Group 1
      treated 76 attacks and group 2 treated 81 attacks. Absence of headache at 1 h was
      seen in 19 attacks (25%) in group 1 and in 34 attacks (42%) in group 2 (P=0.082);
      at 2 h absence of headache was seen in 60% of group 1 attacks and in 76% of group
      2 attacks (P=0.115). At 4 h, 75% of group 1 attacks and 88% of group 2 attacks
      were pain free (P=0.122). With regard to nausea, of those who had nausea at
      baseline, 31% and 49% of attacks in groups 1 and 2, respectively, were nausea
      free at 1 h (P=0.091), 75% and 79% at 2 h (P=0.736) and 82% and 91% (P=0.479) at 
      4 h. Recurrence, based on all attacks of those patients who achieved pain free at
      4 h, was observed in 53% of group 1 and 20% of group 2 attacks (P<0.001).
      Sustained pain-free rates (for the 4-h time point) were 45.6% of group 1 and
      78.9% of group 2 attacks. There were no significant differences with regard to
      rescue medication consumption after 4 h and side-effects in both groups. There
      was a non-significant trend for the combination group to have a higher response
      rate. The group treated with rizatriptan and rofecoxib had a lower recurrence
      rate than the group treated with rizatriptan. This study demonstrated that
      combining a fast acting triptan such as rizatriptan with rofecoxib reduced
      headache recurrence rates, was well tolerated and may be more effective than the 
      use of rizatriptan alone. Double-blind, placebo-controlled studies are necessary 
      to confirm these observations.

TI  - A pharmacokinetic interaction study between butorphanol and sumatriptan nasal
      sprays in healthy subjects: importance of the timing of butorphanol
      administration.
PG  - 282-7
AB  - Sumatriptan and butorphanol nasal sprays are commonly used agents for the
      management of migraine headaches. Under certain circumstances, these two agents
      may be administered closely in time. However, the possibility of a
      pharmacokinetic interaction and the safety of this regime have not been examined.
      In this crossover design study, 24 healthy subjects received the following four
      treatments, each separated by at least 7 days: 1 mg butorphanol (Stadol NS7); 20 
      mg sumatriptan (Imitrex Nasal Spray); or both formulations together with
      butorphanol administered either 1 or 30 min after sumatriptan. Serial plasma
      samples were collected for 24 h post-dose and analysed for butorphanol and/or
      sumatriptan by HPLC-MS/MS. Butorphanol plasma concentrations were reduced when it
      was administered 1 min (mean 28.6% decrease in AUC(0-infinity)), but not 30 min, 
      after sumatriptan. The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan were not substantially
      altered by butorphanol. The combination of nasally administered sumatriptan and
      butorphanol appeared safe. However, if butorphanol nasal spray is administered
      <30 min after sumatriptan nasal spray, the analgesic effect of butorphanol may be
      diminished due to reduced nasal absorption resulting from probable transient
      vasoconstriction of nasal blood vessels by sumatriptan.

TI  - CNS effects of sumatriptan and rizatriptan in healthy female volunteers.
PG  - 271-81
AB  - This study investigates the CNS effects of sumatriptan and rizatriptan, with
      temazepam as an active comparator, in healthy female volunteers. Sixteen
      volunteers completed a randomized, double-blind, crossover study and on four
      separate occasions received either 100 mg sumatriptan, 20 mg rizatriptan or 20 mg
      temazepam. The main parameters were eye movements, EEG, body sway, visual
      analogue scales and a cognitive test battery. Rizatriptan and sumatriptan
      decreased saccadic peak velocity by 18.3 (95% CI: 5.7, 30.8) and 15.0 (2.2, 27.9)
      degrees/sec, respectively, about half the decrease induced by temazepam (35.0
      (22.1, 47.8) degrees/sec). Body sway increased (30% for rizatriptan (16%, 45%)
      and 14% for sumatriptan (1%, 27%), respectively). Temazepam caused larger,
      similar effects. In contrast to temazepam, sumatriptan and rizatriptan decreased 
      reaction times of recognition tasks and increased EEG alpha power (significant
      for sumatriptan, 0.477 (0.02, 0.935). Therapeutic doses of sumatriptan and
      rizatriptan caused CNS effects indicative of mild sedation. For EEG and
      recognition reaction times the effects were opposite to temazepam, indicating
      central stimulation.

TI  - Rizatriptan: an update of its use in the management of migraine.
PG  - 1539-74
AB  - Rizatriptan is an orally active serotonin 5-HT(1) receptor agonist that potently 
      and selectively binds to 5-HT(1B/1D) subtypes. Earlier clinical trials
      demonstrated that rizatriptan 5 or 10mg is more effective than placebo at
      providing pain relief and a pain-free state, relieving associated symptoms of
      migraine, normalising functional ability and improving patient quality of life,
      and showed that rizatriptan provides faster freedom from pain and reduces nausea 
      to a greater extent than oral sumatriptan. More recently, rizatriptan 10mg was
      shown to be more effective than zolmitriptan 2.5mg or naratriptan 2.5mg at
      producing a pain-free state 2 hours postdose. Furthermore, compared with
      naratriptan, significantly more patients who received rizatriptan were pain free 
      or had pain relief from 1 hour onwards. The number of patients with normal
      functional ability at 2 hours was significantly higher after rizatriptan than
      after naratriptan or zolmitriptan. Rizatriptan was also generally more effective 
      than zolmitriptan or naratriptan at relieving migraine-associated symptoms.
      Rizatriptan is generally well tolerated and adverse events are usually mild and
      transient. The most common adverse events associated with rizatriptan in recent
      randomised trials were asthenia/fatigue, dizziness, somnolence and nausea. There 
      was a trend towards a lower incidence of adverse events with rizatriptan compared
      with zolmitriptan (31.2 vs 38.8%). However, rizatriptan was associated with a
      significantly higher incidence of adverse events than naratriptan (39 vs 29%).
      The incidence of chest pain was similar after the administration of rizatriptan, 
      zolmitriptan or naratriptan (2 to 4%). CONCLUSION: Rizatriptan is an effective
      drug for the acute treatment of moderate or severe migraine. Oral rizatriptan 5
      and 10mg have shown greater efficacy than placebo in providing pain relief, an
      absence of pain, relief from associated symptoms, normal functional ability and
      an improvement in patient quality of life. Earlier results showed that
      rizatriptan provides faster freedom from pain and reduces nausea to a greater
      extent than oral sumatriptan. More recent studies have shown that rizatriptan
      10mg provides faster pain relief and a higher percentage of patients with an
      absence of pain and normal functional ability at 2 hours than naratriptan 2.5mg
      or zolmitriptan 2.5mg. The efficacy of rizatriptan is retained when used in the
      long term and the drug is generally well tolerated. Although well designed
      studies comparing rizatriptan with almotriptan, eletriptan and frovatriptan would
      further define the position of rizatriptan, current data suggest rizatriptan
      should be considered as a first-line treatment option in the management of
      migraine.

TI  - Review of zolmitriptan and its clinical applications in migraine.
PG  - 993-1005
AB  - Preclinical studies have shown that zolmitriptan is a selective serotonin
      5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonist (triptan). Randomised, placebo-controlled,
      double-blind trials in patients with migraine have shown that zolmitriptan has
      good efficacy measured using 2 h response and pain-free rates.
      Migraine-associated symptoms, including nausea, photophobia and phonophobia, are 
      also improved with zolmitriptan. Oral zolmitriptan (2.5 and 5 mg) has an onset of
      action within 45 min and efficacy is sustained in most patients who respond at 2 
      h. The orally-disintegrating zolmitriptan tablet has the advantage that it may be
      taken immediately, without the need for additional fluids, any time a migraine
      headache occurs. Patients may benefit in terms of improved efficacy from the
      convenience of the disintegrating tablet, since there is evidence that taking
      triptan therapy as early as possible in an attack is advantageous. For similar
      reasons, as well as improved efficacy, a nasal spray formulation is in
      development. Zolmitriptan is effective in the treatment of migraine associated
      with menses and migraine with aura. There is no tachyphylaxis following repeated 
      doses for multiple attacks of migraine over a prolonged period of time. Compared 
      to placebo, the incidence of persistent migraine headache is reduced by
      zolmitriptan and recurrent migraine headache occurs less frequently. Zolmitriptan
      has also shown efficacy in the treatment of persistent and/or recurrent migraine 
      headache. Comparative clinical studies have shown overall that zolmitriptan has
      similar or superior efficacy to sumatriptan in the treatment of migraine.
      Specifically, zolmitriptan 2.5 mg was significantly more effective than
      sumatriptan 25 or 50 mg according to a number of end points, including headache
      response at 2 h. Oral zolmitriptan is also effective in the acute treatment of
      cluster headache. Zolmitriptan is generally well tolerated, with most adverse
      events being mild-to-moderate, transient and resolving without intervention or
      the need for treatment withdrawal. The consistent efficacy in treating all types 
      of migraine and the choice of available formulations make zolmitriptan acceptable
      to patients and a suitable first-line therapy for the treatment of migraine.

TI  - Signal generation in the New Zealand Intensive Medicines Monitoring Programme: a 
      combined clinical and statistical approach.
PG  - 433-9
AB  - The New Zealand Intensive Medicines Monitoring Programme (IMMP) undertakes
      prospective observational cohort studies on selected new drugs in the early
      postmarketing period using prescription-event monitoring (PEM) methodology with
      the purpose of identifying signals of previously unrecognised ADRs and
      establishing risk profiles for each drug. Events are reviewed by a physician and 
      a relationship is established between each event and the drug. The events are
      then sorted into reactions and incidents. The latter are used to assist signal
      detection and control for bias. Rates for reports, reactions and incidents are
      used to assess the adequacy of reporting, signal detection and identification of 
      confounders. Most signals are identified by clinical evaluation of the reports at
      a stage when statistical analyses are unlikely to have the power to detect them
      with confidence. The incident group is used for signal detection and controlling 
      for bias. A low reporting rate indicates that certain types of event are unlikely
      to be reported. A systematic review of the original case reports at the site of
      collection provides the best opportunity for early signal detection. More
      resources need to be invested in the training and support of clinical evaluators.
      Categorising events into reactions and incidents gives added value to the data.
      Rates of reporting should be quoted with the results of cohort studies to
      facilitate assessment of their power to detect new signals.

TI  - Efficacy of oral ketoprofen in acute migraine: a double-blind randomized clinical
      trial.
PG  - 1660-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Certain nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are effective in the
      acute treatment of migraine attacks. The authors report a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over trial of a dual-release formulation of 
      oral ketoprofen in the acute treatment of migraine attacks. METHODS: The authors 
      compared the efficacy of two doses of ketoprofen (75 or 150 mg) with that of
      placebo (primary analysis) and zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (secondary analysis) on one to
      four consecutive attacks in 235 intent-to-treat patients (out of 257 randomized
      patients) with migraine with or without aura. The principal efficacy outcome was 
      headache relief (reduction in headache severity from severe or moderate to mild
      or absent at 2 hours). RESULTS: Results are based on 838 attacks with a severe or
      moderate headache that were evaluable at 2 hours. Relief was reported for 62.6%
      of headaches treated with ketoprofen 75 mg, 61.6% with ketoprofen 150 mg, and
      66.8% with zolmitriptan. The difference between the three active treatments and
      placebo (27.8% relief) was highly significant, both tests of ketoprofen vs
      placebo being globally controlled at a 5% level for the type I error (primary
      analysis). Headaches at 2 hours disappeared more frequently for the active
      treatments than for placebo. The authors also demonstrated efficacy on most other
      secondary outcomes. The tolerance of ketoprofen was good (similar to that of
      placebo). CONCLUSIONS: Oral ketoprofen (75 mg or 150 mg) in a dual-release
      formulation is an effective and well-tolerated drug in the acute treatment of
      migraine attacks.

TI  - Spotlight on almotriptan in migraine.
PG  - 501-7
AB  - Almotriptan is a selective serotonin 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonist ('triptan').
      Its efficacy and tolerability have been assessed in a number of randomised,
      controlled trials in over 4800 adults with moderate or severe attacks of
      migraine. Oral almotriptan has a rapid onset of action (significant headache
      relief is observed 0.5 hours after administration of a 12.5mg dose) and efficacy 
      is sustained in most patients who respond by 2 hours. The drug is significantly
      more effective than placebo as measured by a number of parameters including
      2-hour headache response and pain-free response rates. Other symptoms of
      migraine, including nausea, photophobia and phonophobia, are also alleviated by
      almotriptan. The efficacy of oral almotriptan appears to be maintained over
      repeated doses for multiple attacks of migraine treated over a long period (up to
      1 year). High headache response rates were reported over all attacks without
      tachyphylaxis. For the relief of single attacks of migraine, oral almotriptan
      12.5mg had similar efficacy to oral sumatriptan 50mg. Patients given almotriptan 
      report less concern with adverse effects than patients given sumatriptan. The
      lower incidence of chest pain following treatment with almotriptan than with
      sumatriptan may lead to a reduction in direct costs, with fewer patients
      requiring management of chest pain. Almotriptan is well tolerated. Most adverse
      events were of mild or moderate intensity, transient and generally resolved
      without intervention or the need for treatment withdrawal. The most common
      adverse events associated with oral almotriptan 12.5mg treatment were dizziness, 
      paraesthesia, nausea, fatigue, headache, somnolence, skeletal pain, vomiting and 
      chest symptoms. The incidence of adverse events did not differ from placebo and
      decreased in the longer term. Almotriptan can be coadministered with drugs that
      share a common hepatic metabolic path; in addition, dosage reduction is required 
      only in the presence of severe renal or hepatic impairment. CONCLUSIONS:
      Almotriptan is an effective drug for the acute treatment of moderate or severe
      attacks of migraine in adults. An oral dose of almotriptan 12.5mg has shown
      greater efficacy than placebo; current data indicate that efficacy is similar to 
      that of oral sumatriptan 50mg, and is maintained in the long term (< or = 1
      year). Almotriptan has a good adverse event profile and a generally similar
      overall tolerability profile to sumatriptan; of note, almotriptan is associated
      with a significantly lower incidence of chest pain than sumatriptan. However,
      further clinical experience is required to clearly define the place of
      almotriptan among the other currently available triptans. Nevertheless, because
      triptans have an important place in various management regimens, and because the 
      nature of individual patient response to triptans is idiosyncratic, almotriptan
      is likely to become a useful treatment option in the management of adults with
      moderate or severe migraine headaches.

TI  - Sensitization: its role in primary headache.
PG  - 449-53
AB  - The pathophysiology of the two most common primary headaches, migraine and
      tension-type headache, is complex and not yet fully understood. Recent animal and
      human studies examining these headaches indicate that the nociceptive input to
      the central nervous system (CNS) may be increased due to activation or
      sensitization of peripheral sensory afferents. The barrage of nociceptive
      impulses may result in sensitization of second- and third-order neurons in the
      CNS. In this way, sensitization may play a role in initiation and maintenance of 
      migraine and tension-type headache. It is likely that the effects of established 
      medication for both disorders may be partly due to a reduction in sensitization. 
      Several interesting drugs that counteract sensitization are under development,
      and targeting this mode of action seems to be a promising way of improving the
      treatment for these prevalent disorders.

TI  - Pharmacological treatments for acute migraine: quantitative systematic review.
PG  - 247-57
AB  - We wanted to compare the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of
      pharmacological treatments for acute migraine through a systematic review of
      randomised controlled trials in patients with acute migraine pain of moderate to 
      severe intensity. Trials were identified from systematic searching of
      bibliographic databases. For eletriptan information from all trials was supplied 
      by Pfizer Inc. Outcomes sought were headache relief at 1 and 2h, patients pain
      free at 2h and sustained relief over 24h for treatments compared with placebo.
      Numbers-needed-to-treat (NNTs) were calculated, together with relative benefit.
      Information on adverse effects was also collected. Comparisons of relative
      efficacy used the same definition of headache, the same degree of pain at the
      start of treatment and the same definitions of outcomes, and always compared with
      placebo. Forty-eight publications reporting on 54 trials were included in the
      meta-analyses, with 79 placebo comparisons for the primary outcome of headache
      relief at 2h. Information on any outcome was available for nine oral medications,
      two intranasal medications and subcutaneous sumatriptan in 21,022 patients. For
      headache relief at 2h NNTs ranged from 2.0 for subcutaneous sumatriptan 6mg to
      5.4 for naratriptan 2.5mg. For patients pain free at 2h NNTs ranged from 2.1 for 
      subcutaneous sumatriptan 6mg to 8.6 for aspirin 900mg plus metoclopramide 10mg.
      For sustained relief over 24h NNTs ranged from 2.8 for eletriptan 80mg to 8.3 for
      rizatriptan 5mg. It was not possible to systematically review adverse effects
      data. Most interventions are effective. There is considerable information on
      relative efficacy for a number of outcomes.

TI  - Practical approaches to migraine management.
PG  - 385-403
AB  - Migraine is a recurrent clinical syndrome characterised by combinations of
      neurological, gastrointestinal and autonomic manifestations. The exact
      pathophysiological disturbances that occur with migraine have yet to be
      elucidated; however, cervico-trigemino-vascular dysfunctions appear to be the
      primary cause. Despite advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of
      migraine and new effective treatment options, migraine remains an
      under-diagnosed, under-treated and poorly treated health condition. Most patients
      will unsuccessfully attempt to treat their headaches with over-the-counter
      medications. Few well designed, placebo-controlled studies are available to guide
      physicians in medication selection. Recently published evidence-based guidelines 
      advocate migraine-specific drugs, such as serotonin 5-HT(1B/1D) agonists (the
      'triptans') and dihydroergotamine mesylate, for patients experiencing moderate to
      severe migraine attacks. Additional headache attack therapy options include other
      ergotamine derivatives, phenothiazines, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and
      opioids. Preventative medication therapy is indicated for patients experiencing
      frequent and/or refractory attacks.

TI  - The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan when administered with clarithromycin in
      healthy volunteers.
PG  - 583-94
AB  - BACKGROUND: Macrolide antibiotics such as clarithromycin are potent inhibitors of
      the cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4 isozyme and have the potential to attenuate the
      metabolism and increase blood concentrations of drugs metabolized by this
      pathway. In vitro studies have suggested that sumatriptan is metabolized
      primarily by the monoamine oxidase-A isozyme and not by CYP3A4. OBJECTIVE: This
      study sought to determine the effect of coadministration of clarithromycin dosed 
      to steady state on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of sumatriptan. A
      secondary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of combining these 
      agents. METHODS: This was an open-label, randomized, 2-way crossover study in
      healthy volunteers. During treatment period 1, subjects received either a single 
      oral dose of sumatriptan 50 mg (sumatriptan alone) or clarithromycin 500 mg
      orally every 12 hours on days 1 to 3 and a single oral dose of sumatriptan 50 mg 
      plus a single oral dose of clarithromycin 500 mg on the morning of day 4
      (combination treatment). During treatment period 2, they received the alternative
      regimen. Equivalence between sumatriptan alone and combination treatment was
      concluded if the 90% CI for the ratio of reference to test means of
      loge-transformed data for area under the plasma concentration-time curve
      extrapolated to infinity (AUC(infinity)) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) 
      fell within the interval from 0.8 to 1.25. RESULTS: In the 24 evaluable subjects 
      (12 men, 12 women) included in the pharmacokinetic analysis, mean sumatriptan
      AUC(infinity) and Cmax values after administration of combination treatment were 
      9% and 14% higher, respectively, than the corresponding values after
      administration of sumatriptan alone. The 90% CI for the ratio of reference to
      test means for AUC(infinity) was 1.03 to 1.15. The 90% CI for the ratio of
      reference to test means for Cmax was 1.03 to 1.26, above the traditional
      bioequivalence criterion. All other pharmacokinetic parameters tested, including 
      nonparametric analysis of the time to Cmax, met the criterion for equivalence
      between treatments. Both treatments were well tolerated in the 27 subjects (13
      men, 14 women) included in the safety analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The extent of
      absorption of sumatriptan was similar after oral administration alone and in
      combination with clarithromycin dosed to steady state. These data are consistent 
      with previous reports that sumatriptan is unaffected by coadministration with the
      potent CYP3A4 inhibitor clarithromycin, supporting concomitant administration of 
      these agents without the need for dose adjustment of sumatriptan in the acute
      treatment of migraine.

TI  - Use of rescue medication in trials of almotriptan versus placebo in the treatment
      of acute migraine.
PG  - 520-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Almotriptan malate is a recently marketed triptan for the treatment
      of acute migraine. Results from controlled clinical trials demonstrate efficacy
      superior to placebo and an adverse event rate comparable to that with placebo.
      OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to assess the effect of oral almotriptan on
      the use of rescue medication in the treatment of acute migraine attacks. METHODS:
      Three Phase II and III, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind studies of
      almotriptan used as the basis for regulatory approval of the drug were included
      in the analysis. Two studies (1 single dose, 1 multiple dose) assessed
      almotriptan 6.25 mg and 12.5 mg and a third compared almotriptan 12.5 mg and
      sumatriptan 100 mg. Primary results from all 3 trials were previously published. 
      Rescue medication was permitted if migraine pain had not decreased to mild
      severity or to no pain at 2 hours after study medication. The primary end point
      of this analysis was use of rescue medication. RESULTS: A total of 1777 patients 
      were included in the analysis. Mean patient age ranged from 39.4 to 44.0 years;
      approximately 87% were women, and >98% were white. Patients were well matched for
      demographic characteristics. Overall, use of rescue medication was significantly 
      lower with almotriptan 6.25 mg and 12.5 mg compared with placebo (P < or = 0.05
      for each group). No significant difference was noted between the almotriptan
      12.5-mg and sumatriptan 100-mg groups. In 2 of the studies, patients with
      moderate or severe baseline pain used significantly less rescue medication in the
      almotriptan groups compared with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Oral almotriptan 6.25 mg
      or 12.5 mg significantly reduced use of rescue medication compared with placebo
      among patients with acute migraine. Use of rescue medication was comparable with 
      almotriptan 12.5 mg and sumatriptan 100 mg.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety of the 5-HT(1B/1D) agonist
      eletriptan following intravenous and oral administration.
PG  - 528-39
AB  - Four separate studies were conducted to examine the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of eletriptan, a 5-HT(1B/1D)
      receptor agonist being developed for the treatment of migraines, after oral and
      intravenous administration. Fifty-five males received oral (1.5-30 mg or 30-120
      mg) or intravenous (1.67-50 microg/kg or 50-102 microg/kg) eletriptan in four
      double- and single-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending-dose crossover studies.
      The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration curve
      (AUC) appeared linear over all dose ranges, with an apparent terminal half-life
      of 4 to 5 hours. Clearance and volume of distribution remained constant with
      dose. The time to first occurrence of Cmax (tmax) for oral eletriptan was
      approximately 1 hour and was unaffected by dose. Comparison of AUC values
      suggested an absolute bioavailability of approximately 50%. A linear PK/PD model,
      fitted to the data, predicted small, transient elevations in diastolic blood
      pressure following eletriptan doses > or = 60 mg. These effects were considered
      unlikely to be clinically significant. Eletriptan was well tolerated, and
      treatment-related adverse events were mild to moderate and transient. These PK
      properties should result in eletriptan having a rapid onset and sustained
      duration of action in terms of migraine efficacy.

AB  - The pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of the 5-HT(1B/1D) agonist
      eletriptan were characterized in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
      dose escalation study. Healthy males received single oral doses of 10 to 120 mg. 
      Following screening and baseline measurements, plasma and saliva eletriptan
      concentrations were measured at intervals over 48 hours and 24 hours,
      respectively. Samples were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography 
      with ultraviolet detection. Both the maximum plasma concentration and the area
      under the plasma eletriptan concentration-time curve showed an essentially linear
      relationship to the administered dose. Eletriptan exhibited a median time to
      maximum plasma concentration of 1 to 1.25 hours and a mean elimination half-life 
      of 3.6 to 7.0 hours. Mean salivary-plasma ratios for pharmacokinetic parameters
      generally remained constant across the 30 to 90 mg dose range. Eletriptan was
      well tolerated, with mostly mild and transient adverse events. In conclusion,
      oral doses of eletriptan in the therapeutic range were rapidly absorbed and
      exhibited essentially linear plasma and saliva pharmacokinetics.

TI  - How does almotriptan compare with other triptans? A review of data from
      placebo-controlled clinical trials.
PG  - 99-113
AB  - Almotriptan, the new selective 5-HT1B/1D agonist, has a higher oral
      bioavailability than any other triptan, with more than two thirds of the
      administered dose absorbed within the first hour both inside and outside of a
      migraine attack. Gender or the presence of food in the stomach does not affect
      its pharmacokinetic profile, and the compound has no clinically relevant
      interactions with other drugs. Among the available triptans, response rates at 2 
      hours range from 50% to 80%, with 20% to 50% of patients pain-free. Almotriptan
      12.5 mg provides similar efficacy, with significant advantage over placebo at 30 
      minutes and a reliable consistency (75% in two of three attacks). Headache
      typically recurs in 25% to 45% of patients with most triptans. The recurrence
      rate with almotriptan 12.5 mg, 18% to 27%, is among the lowest reported. The
      tolerability of almotriptan 12.5 mg is close to that of placebo with a low
      incidence of central nervous system side effects and chest symptoms. In
      conclusion, almotriptan's consistent pharmacokinetics and good efficacy, in
      combination with excellent tolerability, make it an attractive choice in the
      acute treatment of migraine attacks.

TI  - Comparison of triptan tablet consumption per attack: a prospective study of
      migraineurs in Spain.
PG  - 93-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare patient self-reported tablet consumption of rizatriptan 10
      mg per attack (24 hours) with that of sumatriptan 50 mg, zolmitriptan 2.5 mg, and
      naratriptan 2.5 mg on an unselected, prescription-based, Spanish migraine
      population. METHODS: One hundred twenty community pharmacies recruited patients
      with migraine, who used their pharmacies, to fill a triptan prescription. In
      diaries, patients recorded baseline pain intensity and the number of triptan
      tablets and additional medication taken per attack. Patients treated a maximum of
      three attacks. Analysis of variance or the Student t test and chi-square or
      Fisher exact tests were used for univariate comparisons. Hochberg corrections
      were used for multiple-group comparisons. A generalized estimating equation
      method was used to correct for within-subject correlation. Adjusted odds ratios
      (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. RESULTS: Two hundred
      thirty-one patients (84% women) treated 589 evaluable migraine attacks
      (sumatriptan, n = 135; naratriptan, n = 90; zolmitriptan, n = 149; rizatriptan, n
      = 149). Triptan tablet consumption per attack (mean +/- SD) for rizatriptan (1.24
      +/- 0.56) was significantly lower than that of sumatriptan (1.75 +/- 1.2; P<
      .05), zolmitriptan (1.61 +/- 0.86; P < .05), or naratriptan (1.46 +/- 0.62; P=
      .05). The average number of triptan tablets taken and additional medication use
      increased according to baseline pain severity. More attacks were treated with one
      tablet of rizatriptan (81.2%) than with one tablet of sumatriptan (51.9%),
      zolmitriptan (55.7%), or naratriptan (60%). The probability of using more than
      one triptan tablet per attack (24 hours) was more than three times greater for
      sumatriptan (adjusted OR = 3.71; CI, 2.05 to 6.7; P = .001) and zolmitriptan
      (adjusted OR = 3.32; CI, 1.82 to 6.17; P = .001), and more than two times greater
      for naratriptan (adjusted OR = 2.66; CI, 1.36 to 5.21; P =.004) than for
      rizatriptan. CONCLUSIONS: Rizatriptan was associated with significantly lower
      triptan tablet use and additional medication use per attack than the other
      triptans. Additional randomized studies are needed to confirm the conclusions of 
      this study.

TI  - Evidence-based assessment of pregnancy outcome after sumatriptan exposure.
PG  - 8-15
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Assessment of best available evidence for tolerability of sumatriptan 
      after inadvertent exposure during pregnancy. BACKGROUND: Migraine's demography
      suggests that inadvertent exposure to acute therapies is likely during the
      earliest undiagnosed stages of pregnancy. The tolerability of such therapies
      under these conditions is not amenable to clinical trial for ethical reasons. In 
      the United States, sumatriptan is currently labeled pregnancy category C (ie, not
      recommended for use during pregnancy unless the potential benefit justifies the
      potential risk to the fetus). METHODS: Three types of adverse events were
      studied: spontaneous abortion, fetal abnormality, and obstetric complications.
      Traditional evidence-based criteria were used to assess a search-protocol product
      of four clinical studies and two case reports. RESULTS: The single positive
      finding ("preterm delivery" without low birth weight) was in the smallest study; 
      this study was retrospective and the finding was externally inconsistent with the
      other three larger studies, all of which were prospective. No study followed
      children for more than 4 years, which is the period needed to identify the
      maximum number of congenital anomalies. Rigorous teratological technique was
      generally not employed. Post hoc power calculations were used to provide
      parameters of the hazard detectable by these studies in aggregate. CONCLUSIONS:
      Pregnancy categories B and C both seem feasible for sumatriptan. Within the
      limits of the examined studies, there is no evidence for any specific effect of
      sumatriptan on pregnancy outcome. Patients inadvertently exposed to sumatriptan
      during an early stage of pregnancy should be reassured by these data.

TI  - New paradigms in the recognition and acute treatment of migraine.
PG  - 58-69
AB  - It would be ideal if clinical decisions regarding acute migraine treatment could 
      be made on the basis of three parameters: a critical appraisal of available
      scientific evidence, clinical experience (including knowledge of the individual
      patient and his/her attack characteristics), and, of course, patient preferences.
      Patients are likely to prefer agents that offer rapid relief, pain-free status
      within 2 hours, no recurrence or need for rescue medication, extended time to
      recurrence (if present), consistency of therapeutic effect over multiple attacks,
      oral administration. good tolerability, safety, and minimal drug interactions.
      Fortunately, a number of specific therapies now are available which place these
      objectives within the patient's reach. Ongoing barriers to optimal migraine care 
      include underrecognition, underconsultation, undertreatment, restrictions imposed
      by insurance companies, and exaggerated concerns regarding the safety of the
      triptans. Overcoming these barriers is likely to prove a more important
      contribution to patient care than endeavoring to establish the relative merits of
      one triptan over another. We have described in detail a number of strategies for 
      improving recognition and treatment of migraine. Many headache specialists now
      believe that recurrent episodes of disabling headache, with a stable pattern over
      years, should be viewed as migraine until proven otherwise. In the end, this may 
      represent the most useful paradigm in the primary care setting, where time is of 
      the essence. Studies to validate this approach are needed. Acute treatment
      intervention that is based on scientific evidence, clinical experience, and
      patients' needs and desires will provide better outcomes than those presently
      obtained. Preliminary evidence favors early intervention with oral triptans, and 
      randomized, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, ideally
      employing a crossover design, are required to confirm this. The US Consortium's
      evidence-based guidelines, the National Headache Foundation's standards of care, 
      and the Canadian guidelines have applied the standards of scientific inquiry to
      the field of headache management and "translation" of these guidelines into
      practical instruments for clinicians through vehicles such as the Primary Care
      Network's Patient-Centered Strategies for Effective Management of Migraine should
      raise the general standard of care for patients with migraine. Last, but far from
      least, initiatives undertaken by the World Health Organization (WHO) will add
      credibility to the many layfolk and professionals who have struggled to present
      headache as a disabling disorder worthy of scientific investigation and
      aggressive medical management. The WHO states: "These common complaints impose a 
      significant health burden ... Despite this, both the public and the majority of
      healthcare professionals tend to perceive headache as a minor or trivial
      complaint. As a result, the physical, emotional, social and economic burdens of
      headache are poorly acknowledged in comparison with those of other, less
      prevalent, neurologic disorders." Migraine is finally out of the closet.

TI  - Rizatriptan 5 mg for the acute treatment of migraine in adolescents: a
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 49-55
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the tolerability and efficacy of rizatriptan 5 mg in
      adolescent migraineurs. METHODS: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      study. Patients aged 12 to 17 years received rizatriptan 5 mg (n = 149) or
      placebo (n = 147) for a moderate or severe headache and for up to two
      recurrences. Headache severity, presence or absence of associated symptoms, and
      functional disability were assessed over a 4-hour postdose period, and any
      adverse events were recorded. The primary efficacy measure was pain-free status
      at 2 hours postdose. RESULTS: Rizatriptan 5 mg was well tolerated. The most
      commonly reported adverse events (all with incidence of 5% or less) among
      patients receiving rizatriptan were dry mouth, dizziness, asthenia/fatigue,
      nausea, and somnolence. The percentage of patients pain-free at 2 hours was 32%
      for rizatriptan 5 mg versus 28% for placebo (P=.474). The percentage of patients 
      with pain relief (reduction of predose pain intensity to mild or none) at 2 hours
      was 66% for rizatriptan versus 56% for placebo (P=.079). Placebo response rates
      were higher than those typically observed in previous studies of rizatriptan in
      adults. Compared with placebo, rizatriptan significantly improved functional
      disability at 1.5 and 2 hours, and nausea at 1 and 1.5 hours. Post hoc analysis
      showed a significant benefit of rizatriptan versus placebo in the percentage of
      patients who had pain relief when their migraine attacks were treated on weekends
      (65% versus 36%, P=.046) compared with weekdays (66% versus 61%, P=.365), and the
      weekend placebo response rate was similar to that seen in adults. CONCLUSIONS:
      Rizatriptan 5 mg was well tolerated and effective on some measures when used in
      adolescents for the treatment of a migraine attack.

TI  - Frovatriptan for the acute treatment of migraine: a dose-finding study.
PG  - 41-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the optimal dose and tolerability of frovatriptan in the 
      acute treatment of migraine. BACKGROUND: Frovatriptan has a distinctive
      pharmacological and pharmacokinetic profile compared with sumatriptan. A previous
      study has shown that frovatriptan doses of 2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg are equally 
      effective in relieving headache with no evidence of a dose-response relationship.
      The incidence of adverse events tended to increase with doses of 10 mg and above.
      METHODS: This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group multicenter trial. Patients (n=635) took a single oral dose of
      placebo or frovatriptan, 0.5, 1, 2.5, or 5 mg, at the onset of a moderate or
      severe migraine headache and recorded headache intensity, functional impairment, 
      and migraine-associated symptoms over 24 hours. RESULTS: Frovatriptan 2.5 mg
      produced clinically and statistically significant headache relief 2 hours
      post-dose, whereas the effect of lower doses was not significantly different from
      that of placebo at that time point. The 2.5-mg dose also produced significant
      symptom relief and improvement in functional impairment. All doses of
      frovatriptan were well tolerated, and the majority of adverse events were of mild
      or moderate severity. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that the 2.5-mg dose of
      frovatriptan offers optimal efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of acute
      migraine. Higher doses do not appear to confer greater efficacy and are
      associated with an increased incidence of adverse effects.

TI  - Within-patient early versus delayed treatment of migraine attacks with
      almotriptan: the sooner the better.
PG  - 28-31
AB  - BACKGROUND: Migraine sufferers typically have been instructed to delay triptan
      therapy until headache intensity is at least moderate. Recent data suggest that
      earlier use of triptans may be more beneficial. OBJECTIVE: To address the
      potential "within-patient" benefit of intervention with almotriptan 12.5 mg for
      migraine headache of mild intensity. METHODS: We performed a post hoc analysis of
      a subgroup of patients from a large, open-label, long-term clinical trial wherein
      762 migraineurs used almotriptan 12.5 mg for headache attacks of any severity.
      Specifically, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of treatment in those patients
      who had treated at least 3 "mild" attacks and 3 "moderate/severe" attacks,
      examining rates of pain-free status, use of rescue medication, early recurrence, 
      and adverse events for the first 3 mild and the first 3 moderate/severe attacks
      treated. RESULTS: There were 118 migraineurs and 708 attacks available for
      analysis. At 1 hour following treatment, pain-free status was achieved in 47% of 
      mild attacks versus 14% of moderate/severe attacks (P<.001); incidences at 2
      hours were 84% of mild attacks and 53% of moderate/severe attacks (P<.001). The
      chance of achieving pain-free status at 1 hour in at least 2 of 3 treated attacks
      was 45% for mild attacks and 9% for moderate/severe attacks; at 2 hours the
      percentages were 88% for mild attacks and 56% for moderate/severe attacks. Rescue
      medication was required in 8% of mild attacks and in 13% of moderate/severe
      attacks (P<.01). The incidence of early recurrence was 28% for mild attacks and
      33% for moderate/severe attacks (P<.01). There was no difference in the incidence
      of adverse events for mild versus moderate/severe attacks (6% versus 7%).
      CONCLUSION: These results support early intervention with oral triptan therapy.
      When used for mild intensity head pain, almotriptan 12.5 mg produced a
      significantly higher incidence of pain-free status at 1 and 2 hours and lower
      incidences of early headache recurrence or need for rescue medication.

TI  - Almotriptan increases sustained pain-free outcomes in acute migraine: results
      from three controlled clinical trials.
PG  - 21-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the effect of almotriptan on sustained pain-free outcome in
      patients with acute migraine. METHODS: Three randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trials of almotriptan for the treatment of acute migraine were
      examined. Two trials evaluated almotriptan 6.25 mg and 12.5 mg, and the third
      evaluated almotriptan 12.5 mg and sumatriptan 100 mg. Patients aged 18 to 65
      years were instructed to take 1 dose of study medication at the onset of a
      moderate-to-severe migraine headache. A second dose was allowed for relapse.
      Sustained pain-free was defined as a decrease in pain severity from moderate or
      severe at baseline to no pain at 2 hours postdose and without relapse or the use 
      of escape medication between 2 and 24 hours. RESULTS: A total of 1791 adult
      migraine sufferers were studied. The proportion of patients achieving a sustained
      pain-free state was significantly (P<.05) higher in the almotriptan 6.25-mg
      (21.7% to 22.5%) and 12.5-mg (24.6% to 27.6%) groups than in the placebo group
      (7.5% to 12.1%). The proportion of patients achieving a sustained pain-free state
      was comparable between almotriptan 12.5 mg (24.6%) and sumatriptan 100 mg (28.5%)
      and significantly (P<.05) greater than with placebo (12.1%). Among patients with 
      severe baseline pain, a sustained pain-free state was achieved in significantly
      more patients (P<.05) with almotriptan 12.5 mg (17.3% to 20.9%) than with placebo
      (3.1% to 3.2%). Among those with moderate baseline pain, a sustained pain-free
      state was achieved in significantly more patients (P<.01) with almotriptan 12.5
      mg (31.3% to 32.0%) than with placebo (10.2% to 16.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Almotriptan 
      12.5 mg is significantly better than placebo and comparable to sumatriptan 100 mg
      for achieving a sustained pain-free state.

TI  - Intraoral chilling versus oral sumatriptan for acute migraine.
PG  - 357-61
AB  - Migraine pathophysiology is associated with a dural inflammation. Recent evidence
      suggests that the primary inflammation occurs in a maxillary nerve segment,
      accessible intraorally. Local tenderness, related to symptom laterality, has been
      palpated consistently in asymptomatic migraine patients, and significant migraine
      relief has been obtained from chilling confined to this area. Thirty-five
      symptomatic episodic migraine patients were enrolled in this study, comparing 40 
      minutes of bilateral intraoral chilling, 50 mg of oral sumatriptan, and 40
      minutes of sham (tongue) chilling. Hollow metal tubes chilled by circulating ice 
      water were held in the maxillary molar periapical areas by the patient. Pain and 
      nausea were recorded at baseline and 1, 2, 4, and 24 hours after start of
      treatment, using a numeric symptom-relief scale. Significant mean headache relief
      was obtained by maxillary chilling and sumatriptan at all four time intervals,
      with poor relief obtained by placebo. Maxillary chilling was more effective than 
      sumatriptan at all four time intervals. Significant nausea relief was obtained by
      maxillary chilling and sumatriptan at posttreatment and 2 and 4 hours later. At
      24 hours, some headache and nausea recurrence was noted with sumatriptan. The
      repeated-measures analysis of variance indicated that both treatments, drug (P = 
      0.024) and maxillary chilling (P = 0.001), reduced the headache, as compared with
      the control group. Tenderness suggests local inflammation associated with
      vasodilatation and edema. Because chilling can resolve local edema, these
      findings raise the possibility that an intraoral inflammation may be a factor in 
      migraine etiology.

TI  - Acute migraine headache: possible sensitization of neurons in the spinal
      trigeminal nucleus?
PG  - 1234-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate trigeminal sensory processing in patients with migraine
      using a novel "nociception-specific" blink reflex. METHODS: Seventeen patients
      with unilateral migraine headache were studied within 6 hours of onset. Blink
      reflexes were elicited with a standard stimulating electrode (standard blink
      reflex) and concentric stimulating electrode (nociception-specific blink reflex) 
      during the acute migraine attack, after treatment with IV lysine acetylsalicylate
      (1,000 mg) or oral zolmitriptan (5 mg) and interictally. RESULTS: After standard 
      stimulation, no differences were detected for the R1 and R2 onset latencies and
      areas under the curve (AUC) between the different time points and the headache
      and nonheadache side. Nociception-specific stimulation revealed a shortening of
      R2 onset latencies (44.3 +/- 5.4 ms for headache side vs 48.9 +/- 5.8 ms for
      nonheadache side) during the acute migraine attack compared with the
      headache-free interval (49.8 +/- 5.3 vs 49.8 +/- 4.5 ms). The AUC of the R2
      increased on the headache side by 680% and on the nonheadache side by 230%
      compared with the headache-free interval. Drug treatment parallel to pain relief 
      increased the onset latencies (zolmitriptan: 48.0 +/- 8.2 ms for headache side vs
      52.3 +/- 7.6 ms for nonheadache side; lysine acetylsalicylate: 48.0 +/- 5.0 ms
      for headache side vs 51.2 +/- 5.6 ms for nonheadache side) and reduced the AUC of
      R2 (zolmitriptan by 45% and lysine acetylsalicylate by 48%). CONCLUSION: The data
      suggest temporary sensitization of central trigeminal neurons during acute
      migraine attacks.

TI  - Treatment of acute cluster headache with 20 mg sumatriptan nasal spray--an open
      pilot study.
PG  - 94-9
AB  - We investigated the efficacy and tolerability of 20 mg sumatriptan nasal spray in
      the acute treatment of cluster headache attacks in an open-label study. 10
      patients met the criteria of the International Headache Society (IHS) for
      episodic or chronic cluster headache and were enrolled in our study. The primary 
      efficacy measure was "pain free" 30 minutes after treatment. Secondary end-points
      included "headache response" (defined as headache improvement from "very severe",
      "severe" or moderate" pain to "mild" or "no" pain) 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes
      after treatment. We also assessed the participant's overall treatment
      satisfaction at the end of the study. Sumatriptan nasal spray was applied in 154 
      "moderate" to "very severe" cluster headache attacks. 30 minutes after nasal
      spray application, 50% of attacks were completely aborted and 58% of attacks
      responded to treatment. The overall efficacy of sumatriptan nasal spray was
      considered "excellent" in two, "good" in four, "reasonable" in two and "poor" in 
      two patients. Eight patients indicated their intention to treat further attacks
      with intranasal sumatriptan. Seven patients were interviewed after a follow-up
      period of six months. Four patients continued to treat all cluster headache
      attacks with the intranasal sumatriptan formula, two patients had switched to
      subcutaneous sumatriptan and one patient was in remission since the end of the
      study. We conclude that 20 mg sumatriptan nasal spray might be an alternative
      therapy for the treatment of cluster headache attacks, but double-blind studies
      are needed to further evaluate its efficacy.

TI  - Dipyridamole may be used safely in patients with ischaemic heart disease.
PG  - 121-7
AB  - It is thought that up to 50% of patients with cerebrovascular disease will have
      concurrent ischaemic heart disease. Dipyridamole co-formulated with aspirin has
      been shown to increase the relative reduction in risk of second stroke in
      patients with prior stroke/transient ischaemic attack beyond that obtaining with 
      aspirin alone. We have sought to resolve the question of whether dipyridamole
      treatment increases the risk of cardiac adverse events in patients with
      co-existing ischaemic heart disease. The published literature, periodic safety
      update reports, the randomised controlled trials of antiplatelet agents in stroke
      prevention and those including dipyridamole in cardiovascular indications, have
      been reviewed and analysed. The early reports of serious adverse cardiac effect
      attributable to dipyridamole occurred in patients with severe coronary artery
      disease using dipyridamole as a stress test adjunct to cardiac imaging. The
      randomised controlled trials databases show no evidence of mortality and only
      isolated cases of significant cardiac morbidity attributable to dipyridamole at
      recommended oral doses in patients with ischaemic heart disease. We conclude that
      patients with cerebrovascular and mild to moderate concomitant ischaemic heart
      disease may be treated safely with dipyridamole for the secondary prevention of
      stroke.

TI  - Gastric emptying in diabetes: clinical significance and treatment.
PG  - 177-94
AB  - The outcome of recent studies has led to redefinition of concepts relating to the
      prevalence, pathogenesis and clinical significance of disordered gastric emptying
      in patients with diabetes mellitus. The use of scintigraphic techniques has
      established that gastric emptying is abnormally slow in approx. 30-50% of
      outpatients with long-standing Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes, although the magnitude 
      of this delay is modest in many cases. Upper gastrointestinal symptoms occur
      frequently and affect quality of life adversely in patients with diabetes,
      although the relationship between symptoms and the rate of gastric emptying is
      weak. Acute changes in blood glucose concentration affect both gastric motor
      function and upper gastrointestinal symptoms. Gastric emptying is slower during
      hyperglycaemia when compared with euglycaemia and accelerated during
      hypoglycaemia. The blood glucose concentration may influence the response to
      prokinetic drugs. Conversely, the rate of gastric emptying is a major determinant
      of post-prandial glycaemic excursions in healthy subjects, as well as in Type 1
      and Type 2 patients. A number of therapies currently in development are designed 
      to improve post-prandial glycaemic control by modulating the rate of delivery of 
      nutrients to the small intestine.

      for treating depression and a variety of other disorders including anxiety,
      social phobia and premenstrual dysphoria (PMD). The other major success stories
      of 5-HT research are the discovery of 5-HT1B/D receptor agonists for treating
      migraine and 5-HT3 receptor antagonists for chemotherapy and radiation-induced
      emesis. The role of 5-HT in the mechanism of action of antipsychotic agents
      remains a topic of intense research, which promises better treatments for
      schizophrenia in the future. Compounds interacting with 5-HT1F, 5-HT2C, 5-HT6 and
      5-HT7 receptors are currently under investigation and may prove to have important
      therapeutic applications in the future.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness analysis of stratified versus stepped care strategies for
      acute treatment of migraine: The Disability in Strategies for Care (DISC) Study.
PG  - 91-100
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Disability in Strategies for Care (DISC) study was the first
      large randomised controlled trial to compare alternative treatment strategies in 
      the acute treatment of migraine. With 835 patients in its intention-to-treat
      efficacy analysis, DISC compared a stratified care strategy, where initial
      therapy was based on clinical need as determined by the Migraine Disability
      Assessment Scale (MIDAS) and two stepped care strategies (across attacks and
      within attacks), where first-line therapy with a simple combination analgesic was
      escalated, if response had been inadequate, to zolmitriptan, a migraine-specific 
      therapy. OBJECTIVE: To report on the cost effectiveness of these three strategies
      from a societal perspective. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A cost-effectiveness
      analysis was undertaken using data from the DISC study, and including both health
      service and productivity costs. Data were collected prospectively on drug usage
      (main therapy and rescue medication); resource use associated with adverse events
      was estimated by a clinician blinded to treatment strategy. Health service
      resource use was costed using UK unit costs (1999 to 2000 values). Data were
      collected using diary cards on the amount of time patients lost from work, and on
      reduced effectiveness at work, due to a migraine attack. This facilitated an
      estimate of the productivity costs associated with the treatment strategies. To
      assess cost effectiveness, the differences in costs between the strategies were
      related to the two primary outcome measures in the trial: headache response 2
      hours after initial therapy and disability-adjusted time during the first 4 hours
      after initial therapy. RESULTS: Although the mean health service cost was higher 
      in the stratified care group (mean over 6 attacks of pound 28.25 versus pound
      11.74 and pound 23.15 in the stepped care across attacks group and within attacks
      group, respectively), mean productivity costs over 6 attacks were lower in the
      stratified group (pound 112.22 versus pound 144.70 and pound 127.53). The total
      mean cost over six attacks was, therefore, lowest in the stratified care group
      (pound 138.95 compared with pound 157.19 in the stepped care across attacks group
      and pound 148.53 in the stepped care within attacks group), although these
      differences did not reach statistical significance. In terms of headache
      response, stratified care was statistically significantly more effective than
      both forms of stepped care. Using disability-adjusted time, stratified care was
      statistically significantly more effective than stepped care across attacks, but 
      not against stepped care within attacks. CONCLUSION: Given its lower mean costs
      and higher mean effectiveness, a stratified care strategy, which included
      zolmitriptan, was the dominant strategy and was unequivocally more cost effective
      from a societal perspective than either stepped care strategy. When the
      uncertainty around these means was considered, stratified care had the highest
      probability of being cost effective.

TI  - Assessing the efficacy of drugs for the acute treatment of migraine: issues in
      clinical trial design.
PG  - 181-96
AB  - Clinical trials of therapies for acute migraine attacks have evolved over the
      years from open-label, small observational studies to highly structured
      randomised, controlled trials. The International Headache Society Committee on
      Clinical Trials in Migraine developed a tool to guide in designing scientifically
      sound trials. The proof of effect is best achieved in a clinical trial with:
      clearly defined objectives;a well-characterised study population, identified
      using well-validated diagnostic tools;proper randomisation and blinding;inclusion
      of a placebo arm, with proper balancing of patients receiving placebo and those
      receiving active drug;adequate study power; and appropriate statistical methods. 
      Both parallel and crossover studies may be suitable in clinical trials of
      antimigraine agents, although the latter are a better choice in patient
      preference and bioequivalence studies. Although various efficacy measures are
      used to assess treatment effect, the 2-hour pain free rate (total resolution of
      pain within 2 hours after an initial moderate to severe headache) is preferred
      because it is clinically relevant and is relatively 'placebo-insensitive'.
      Various migraine surveys have indicated that a rapid onset of therapeutic effect 
      is a highly desirable attribute of an antimigraine drug. Therefore, accurate
      measurements of treatment effect before 2 hours are becoming increasingly
      emphasised. Consistency of effect across multiple attacks adds to the
      understanding of the therapeutic efficacy of a test drug. Finally, preference and
      satisfaction studies allow us to assess patients' global impression of a
      particular treatment, weighing the positive effects on pain and associated
      symptoms of migraine against potential adverse effects.

TI  - Diagnosis and treatment of migraine.
PG  - 255-61
AB  - Despite recent advances in understanding the pathophysiology and treatment of
      migraine, considerable uncertainty remains surrounding the diagnosis and
      treatment of this disorder. This uncertainty is reflected in studies that show
      both underdiagnosis and undertreatment of migraine. While the diagnosis can be
      assisted by criteria from the International Headache Society, other approaches
      may be useful in clinical practice. Treatment of migraine must be based on an
      individualized patient strategy that integrates education, patient participation,
      and effective use of pharmacological interventions. Many patients, despite
      self-treatment with simple analgesics, continue to suffer considerable disability
      associated with their migraines. Triptans, which are more effective at relieving 
      migraine symptoms and maintaining patient function than are nonspecific
      therapies, are used in only a minority of patients with migraine. Treatment goals
      of rapid, complete relief with no recurrence and minimal adverse effects can be
      achieved when effective therapy is matched to individual patient goals. For
      prophylaxis, anticonvulsant drugs emerging as effective options are being added
      to the armamentarium with traditional compounds such as tricyclic antidepressants
      and beta-blockers.

TI  - Review article: the complexity of drug development for irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 343-51
AB  - Drug development for functional gastrointestinal disorders is complex. These
      conditions involve central and peripheral physiological changes, together with
      psychological factors. Methodological problems have included a poor appreciation 
      of the physiological and psychological correlates of patients' symptoms, a lack
      of animal models of proven relevance, and safety issues. Government, patient
      pressure groups and the Internet can also influence a drug's success. Most recent
      interest has focused on the serotonin (5-HT) modifying drugs. Cisapride has been 
      withdrawn in some countries because of concerns related to QT prolongation and
      cardiac arrhythmias. The 5-HT3 antagonists, developed to modify visceral
      sensation, have caused constipation; alosetron, also withdrawn, caused ischaemic 
      colitis. The 5-HT4 agonists induce peristalsis; tegaserod and prucalopride, both 
      delayed in their development due to issues of safety and efficacy, benefit
      patients with 'constipation-predominant' irritable bowel syndrome or idiopathic
      constipation. 5-HT1 agonists improve impaired gastric accommodation and symptoms 
      in patients with functional dyspepsia. Antidepressants also affect serotonin
      metabolism. Previous examples of success in this area involved drugs targeted at 
      peripheral receptors mediating motor function or secretion. Modification of
      sensory function is a much more challenging objective. The experience with
      serotonin modifying drugs has been mixed, and some important lessons are there to
      be learnt.

TI  - Pharmacoeconomic evidence and considerations for triptan treatment of migraine.
PG  - 237-48
AB  - The 5-hydroxytriptamine (5-HT)(1B/1D) agonists (i.e., the triptans) are highly
      effective in migraine but their high cost relative to other treatments
      necessitates careful analysis of their cost-effectiveness. The majority of
      pharmacoeconomic evaluations, nearly all of which deal with sumatriptan, indicate
      that from the societal perspective triptans are dominant: health outcomes are
      improved while the overall cost of migraine is reduced. However, the results are 
      more ambiguous from the perspective of the health care payer: reductions in
      non-drug medical costs are unlikely to offset fully the high drug cost. Thus far,
      few analyses have explicitly included quality of life (QOL) in their analyses and
      pharmacoeconomic analyses comparing the different triptans are scant. More
      research is required in these areas.

TI  - Divalproex sodium in the treatment of migraine and cluster headaches.
PG  - 92-4
AB  - The discovery of a new class of effective migraine-abortive medications, the
      triptans, has sparked a new interest in the study of vascular headache. Over the 
      past few years, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved six new
      abortive pharmacologic therapies, with several others in various stages of
      clinical trials. Unfortunately, concurrent pharmacologic changes in headache
      prophylaxis have not kept pace with their abortive counterparts. However,
      divalproex sodium (Depakote), which is approved by the FDA as a migraine
      prophylactic agent, is the first in the anticonvulsant class of medication for
      migraine headache and has expanded the options in headache treatment. The
      objective of this retrospective multicenter study of 284 patients with migraine
      or cluster headaches was to examine the clinical efficacy and safety of
      divalproex sodium as prophylaxis in monotherapy and in polytherapy. Sixty-one
      percent of migraineurs and 73% of cluster patients noted a decrease in pain with 
      divalproex sodium and continued that therapy for more than 3 months. Reported
      negative side effects included weight gain, nausea, somnolence, tremor, alopecia,
      dysequilibrium, and rash. However, only 14% of subjects discontinued therapy due 
      to these side effects. Overall, divalproex sodium was found to be an effective
      and generally well-tolerated prophylactic treatment option as monotherapy or in
      polytherapy for migraine and cluster headache.

TI  - Cluster headache: evidence for a disorder of circadian rhythm and hypothalamic
      function.
PG  - 33-40
AB  - This article reviews the literature for evidence of a disorder of circadian
      rhythm and hypothalamic function in cluster headache. Cluster headache exhibits
      diurnal and seasonal rhythmicity. While cluster headache has traditionally been
      thought of as a vascular headache disorder, its periodicity suggests involvement 
      of the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, the biological clock. Normal 
      circadian function and seasonal changes occurring in the suprachiasmatic nucleus 
      and pineal gland are correlated to the clinical features and abnormalities of
      circadian rhythm seen in cluster headache. Abnormalities in the secretion of
      melatonin and cortisol in patients with cluster headache, neuroimaging of cluster
      headache attacks, and the use of melatonin as preventative therapy in cluster
      headache are discussed in this review. While the majority of studies exploring
      the relationship between circadian rhythms and cluster headache are not new, we
      have entered a new diagnostic and therapeutic era in primary headache disorders. 
      The time has come to use the evidence for a disorder of circadian rhythm in
      cluster headache to further development of chronobiotics in the treatment of this
      disorder.

TI  - Efficacy, tolerability and safety of oral eletriptan and ergotamine plus caffeine
      (Cafergot) in the acute treatment of migraine: a multicentre, randomised,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled comparison.
PG  - 99-107
AB  - The 5-HT(1B/1D/1F) agonist eletriptan, at an oral dose of 80 mg, has been shown
      to be more efficacious than sumatriptan 100 mg and placebo in the treatment of
      migraine attacks with or without aura. Another commonly prescribed oral treatment
      for migraine attacks is Cafergot (1 mg ergotamine tartrate with 100 mg caffeine
      per tablet). The efficacy, tolerability and safety of 40- and 80-mg doses of
      eletriptan and 2 tablets of Cafergot were compared in a double-blind, randomised,
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial involving 733 migraine patients.
      Patients recorded symptoms at baseline (before treatment) and 1, 2, 4 and 24 h
      after dosing. Headache intensity was assessed on a 4-point scale (3 = severe
      pain, 2 = moderate pain, 1 = mild pain, 0 = no pain). Significantly more
      eletriptan-treated patients (80 mg, 68%; 40 mg, 54%) than Cafergot-treated
      patients (33%; p < 0.001) reported headache response (improvement from
      moderate-to-severe to mild or no pain) at 2 h. Substantially more eletriptan
      recipients reported no pain (80 mg, 38%; 40 mg, 28%; Cafergot, 10%; placebo, 5%; 
      p < 0.001). Eletriptan headache response rates at 1 h were significantly higher
      (80 mg, 39%; 40 mg, 29%; Cafergot, 13%; placebo, 13%; p < 0.002 for each
      comparison). Both doses of eletriptan were significantly more effective than
      Cafergot in reducing nausea (p < 0.0001), photophobia (80 mg, p < 0.0001; 40 mg, 
      p < 0.002), phonophobia (80 mg, p < 0.0001; 40 mg, p < 0.003) and functional
      impairment (p < or = 0.001) at 2 h. Adverse events were generally mild or
      moderate and transient. This randomised trial shows that oral eletriptan is more 
      efficacious in the acute treatment of migraine than oral Cafergot and is well
      tolerated.

TI  - Zolmitriptan versus a combination of acetylsalicylic acid and metoclopramide in
      the acute oral treatment of migraine: a double-blind, randomised, three-attack
      study.
PG  - 88-98
AB  - This multicentre, randomised, double-blind study compared oral zolmitriptan 2.5
      mg with a combination of oral acetylsalicylic acid 900 mg and metoclopramide 10
      mg as acute anti-migraine therapy for 3 migraine attacks. In total, 666 patients 
      took at least one dose of study medication (326 took zolmitriptan and 340 took
      acetylsalicylic acid plus metoclopramide). The percentage of patients with a
      2-hour headache response after the first dose for all 3 attacks (the primary end 
      point) was 33.4% with zolmitriptan and 32.9% with acetylsalicylic acid plus
      metoclopramide [odds ratio 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77-1.47; p =
      0.7228]. For the majority of secondary end points, the two treatments
      demonstrated comparable efficacy. However, post hoc analysis showed that
      significantly more patients receiving zolmitriptan were free of pain 2 h after
      the first dose in all 3 attacks compared with patients receiving acetylsalicylic 
      acid plus metoclopramide (10.7 vs. 5.3%; odds ratio 2.19, 95% CI 1.23-4.03; p =
      0.0095). In addition, post hoc analysis showed that the overall 2-hour pain-free 
      response rate was consistently higher with zolmitriptan (34.6%) than with
      acetylsalicylic acid plus metoclopramide (27.9%) (odds ratio 1.40, 95% CI
      1.09-1.78; p = 0.007). Both treatments reduced migraine-associated nausea,
      vomiting, phonophobia and photophobia. There were no important inter-group
      differences with respect to the onset of meaningful migraine relief, the
      frequency of headache recurrence, the usage or efficacy of a second dose of
      medication or the use of escape medication. However, at the last attack, the
      proportion of patients who expressed overall satisfaction with the treatment was 
      significantly higher in the zolmitriptan group, i.e. 83.7%, versus 75.0% with
      acetylsalicylic acid plus metoclopramide (p = 0.0346). Both agents were well
      tolerated. Adverse events were reported by 40.8% (133/326) of
      zolmitriptan-treated patients and 29.1% (99/340) of those treated with
      acetylsalicylic acid plus metoclopramide. The incidence of withdrawals due to
      adverse events was very low with both zolmitriptan (0.9%) and the combination
      regimen (1.5%); the latter percentage included 1 patient who withdrew from the
      study due to phlebitis, which was classified as a serious adverse event. This
      study showed that zolmitriptan is effective and well tolerated for the acute
      treatment of moderate to severe migraine. Zolmitriptan was at least as effective 
      as acetylsalicylic acid plus metoclopramide in achieving a 2-hour headache
      response, but significantly more effective than the combination therapy for other
      end points, including the 2-hour pain-free response.

TI  - Sibutramine: new preparation. Slight weight loss; but also a slight rise in blood
      pressure ...
PG  - 140-5
AB  - (1) The reference treatment for achieving weight loss by obese patients is a
      combination of dietary measures, exercise and behavioural interventions. There is
      currently no drug treatment with demonstrated efficacy on the morbidity or
      mortality associated with excess body weight. (2) Sibutramine, a serotonin- and
      noradrenaline-reuptake inhibitor structurally related to the amphetamines has
      been granted marketing authorisation in France for the treatment of obesity and
      excess body weight in patients with associated risk factors. (3) The clinical
      file on sibutramine contains no trial focusing on morbidity or mortality end
      points. (4) According to comparative clinical trials, weight loss during a 6-12
      month course of sibutramine is, on average, between 3 and 9 kg greater than that 
      on placebo. Patients regain weight after sibutramine cessation. (5) Sibutramine
      has little or no benefit on blood sugar or lipid parameters. (6) The main known
      adverse effect of sibutramine is increased blood pressure. Sibutramine also has
      amphetamine-like side effects. (7) In practice, sibutramine currently has no
      place in the management of obesity.

TI  - Almotriptan: a review of its use in migraine.
PG  - 387-414
AB  - Almotriptan is a selective serotonin 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonist ('triptan').
      Its efficacy and tolerability have been assessed in a number of randomised,
      controlled trials in over 4800 adults with moderate or severe attacks of
      migraine. Oral almotriptan has a rapid onset of action (significant headache
      relief is observed 0.5 hours after administration of a 12.5mg dose) and efficacy 
      is sustained in most patients who respond by 2 hours. The drug is significantly
      more effective than placebo as measured by a number of parameters including
      2-hour headache response and pain-free response rates. Other symptoms of
      migraine, including nausea, photophobia and phonophobia, are also alleviated by
      almotriptan. The efficacy of oral almotriptan appears to be maintained over
      repeated doses for multiple attacks of migraine treated over a long period (up to
      1 year). High headache response rates were reported over all attacks without
      tachyphylaxis. For the relief of single attacks of migraine, oral almotriptan
      12.5mg had similar efficacy to oral sumatriptan 50mg. Patients given almotriptan 
      report less concern with adverse effects than patients given sumatriptan. The
      lower incidence of chest pain following treatment with almotriptan than with
      sumatriptan may lead to a reduction in direct costs, with fewer patients
      requiring management of chest pain. Almotriptan is well tolerated. Most adverse
      events were of mild or moderate intensity, transient, and generally resolved
      without intervention or the need for treatment withdrawal. The most common
      adverse events associated with oral almotriptan 12.5mg treatment were dizziness, 
      paraesthesia, nausea, fatigue, headache, somnolence, skeletal pain, vomiting and 
      chest symptoms. The incidence of adverse events did not differ from placebo and
      decreased in the longer term. Almotriptan can be coadministered with drugs that
      share a common hepatic metabolic path; in addition, dosage reduction is required 
      only in the presence of severe renal or hepatic impairment. CONCLUSIONS:
      Almotriptan is an effective drug for the acute treatment of moderate or severe
      attacks of migraine in adults. An oral dose of almotriptan 12.5mg has shown
      greater efficacy than placebo; current data indicate that efficacy is similar to 
      that of oral sumatriptan 50mg, and is maintained in the long term (<or=1 year).
      Almotriptan has a good adverse event profile and a generally similar overall
      tolerability profile to sumatriptan; of note, almotriptan is associated with a
      significantly lower incidence of chest pain than sumatriptan. However, further
      clinical experience is required to clearly define the place of almotriptan among 
      the other currently available triptans. Nevertheless, because triptans have an
      important place in various management regimens, and because the nature of
      individual patient response to triptans is idiosyncratic, almotriptan is likely
      to become a useful treatment option in the management of adults with moderate or 
      severe migraine headaches.

TI  - The proximal stomach and postprandial symptoms in functional dyspeptics.
PG  - 40-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: It remains unclear whether postprandial symptom profiles in patients 
      with visceral hypersensitivity and in those with impaired fundic accommodation
      differ. Therefore, we evaluated the postprandial symptoms in functional dyspepsia
      (FD) patients classified according to proximal stomach function. In addition, the
      effect of gastric relaxation induced by sumatriptan on postprandial symptoms was 
      studied in FD patients with impaired fundic accommodation. METHODS: Twenty-five
      healthy volunteers (HVs) and 44 FD patients filled out a disease-specific
      questionnaire (Nepean Dyspepsia Index) and underwent a gastric barostat study to 
      evaluate visceral sensitivity, meal-induced fundic relaxation, and postprandial
      symptoms. Postprandial symptoms evoked by a drink test or reported during the
      barostat study were compared between FD patients subdivided according to the
      underlying pathophysiological mechanism. Finally, the effect of sumatriptan on
      postprandial symptoms evoked by a drink test was investigated in HVs and in FD
      patients with impaired fundic accommodation. RESULTS: There was no clear
      relationship between any of the 15 Nepean Dyspepsia Index symptoms and proximal
      stomach function. Postprandial symptoms evoked during the barostat study or after
      the drink tests were significantly higher in FD patients than in HVs; however, no
      clear differences in symptom profile could be demonstrated between the different 
      subclasses of FD. Sumatriptan did not affect the maximal ingested volume or the
      postprandial symptoms in HVs or FD patients after a drink test. CONCLUSIONS: No
      clear relationship could be demonstrated between postprandial symptoms and
      proximal stomach function.

TI  - Sumatriptan challenge in bipolar patients with and without migraine: a
      neuroendocrine study of 5-HT1D receptor function.
PG  - 33-6
AB  - An association between bipolar disorder and migraine has been lately recognized
      and an abnormality of central serotonergic function is suggested as the
      underlying neurophysiological disturbance. To examine the role of serotonin in
      bipolar disorder and migraine, we used the neuroendocrine challenge paradigm, and
      we chose sumatriptan, a 5HT1D agonist, as the pharmacological probe. We studied
      nine bipolar patients with migraine, nine bipolar patients without it, seven
      migraine patients, and nine matched normal controls. A post-hoc analysis showed
      subsensitivity of serotonergic function, reflected in a blunted growth hormone
      response to sumatriptan challenge in bipolar patients who also suffered from
      migraine.

TI  - Gastroparesis: prevalence, clinical significance and treatment.
PG  - 805-13
AB  - The application of novel techniques to quantify gastric motor function and
      gastric emptying has yielded important insights into the prevalence, pathogenesis
      and clinical sequelae of gastroparesis. Both acute and chronic gastroparesis
      occur frequently; gastric emptying of solids is delayed in 30% to 50% of patients
      with diabetes mellitus, functional dyspepsia and gastroesophageal reflux disease.
      While many patients with gastroparesis experience upper gastrointestinal symptoms
      that adversely affect quality of life, the concept that symptoms are inevitably
      the direct outcome of delay in gastric emptying is now recognized to be overly
      simplistic. In contrast, the potential impact of gastroparesis on oral drug
      absorption and blood glucose control in patients with diabetes mellitus has
      probably been underestimated. While the use of prokinetic drugs (cisapride,
      domperidone, metoclopramide and erythromycin) forms the mainstay of therapy in
      symptomatic patients with gastroparesis, a number of novel pharmacological
      therapies are being evaluated, and preliminary studies using gastric pacing show 
      promise.

TI  - Emerging treatments for irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 9-21
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional GI disorder that is associated
      with abdominal discomfort and altered bowel habits. It accounts for up to 28% of 
      patients presenting to a gastroenterology practice and poses a significant
      personal, societal and economic burden internationally. The Manning, Rome I and
      Rome II criteria were developed to identify appropriate IBS patients for entry
      into IBS studies in a consistent manner. Refinements in the understanding of the 
      physiology of the enteric nervous system (ENS), which controls motility,
      secretion and sensation, provided the basis for our comprehension of the
      pathophysiology of IBS. Visceral hypersensitivity and neurotransmitter imbalance 
      currently receive the most attention as possible mechanisms of IBS. This article 
      outlines conventional treatments and reviews the data on emerging and
      experimental therapies for IBS. Emerging therapies for IBS using 5-HT mediation
      include 5-HT(3) antagonists, such as ondasetron, granisetron and alosetron, as
      well as 5-HT(4) agonists such as tegaserod and prucalopride. In addition to
      opioid agonists (e.g. fedotozine) several other drugs that act on other ENS
      receptors are being studied. In spite of significant progress in IBS research,
      these emerging therapies require more studies before they can be utilised as
      clinical treatments.

TI  - Eletriptan.
PG  - 1869-74
AB  - Eletriptan (Relpax, Pfizer) is one of a group of anti-migraine medications
      commonly referred to as 'triptans'. It is a potent serotonin agonist at the
      5-HT(1B/1D) receptor and is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine
      headaches. Eletriptan is administered orally. It is rapidly absorbed and has a
      bioavailability of 50% compared to 14% for sumatriptan. The relatively high
      lipophilicity of eletriptan compared to sumatriptan may explain its faster oral
      absorption and shorter time to onset of action. Results from comparative studies 
      between oral eletriptan and sumatriptan indicate that eletriptan 80 mg was
      superior to sumatriptan 100 mg in onset of action, headache response rate, pain
      free response rate and relief of associated migraine symptoms at the 1 or 2 h
      time intervals. Although there was a modest increase in adverse events with
      eletriptan 80 mg than with sumatriptan 100 mg, eletriptan received a high patient
      acceptability rating (84%).

TI  - Migraine and beyond: cardiovascular therapeutic potential for CGRP modulators.
PG  - 1131-8
AB  - CGRP is a potent vasodilator that has been shown to have a physiological and/or
      pathological role in neurogenic inflammation, headaches including migraine,
      thermal injury, circulatory shock, pregnancy and menopause, hypertension and
      heart failure and is known to be cardioprotective. CGRP is also a positive
      inotrope and increases heart rate. Clinical trials have shown beneficial effects 
      of the vasodilatory action of CGRP in hypertension, angina, heart failure,
      Raynaud's disease and venous stasis ulcers. However, the clinical potential of
      CGRP is limited as it has to be given by infusion and is quickly broken down.
      Oral long acting CGRP-mimetics may have potential in disorders in which CGRP has 
      been shown to be beneficial. CGRP-mimetics include capsaicin/vanilloid receptor
      agonists and gene transfer of an adenoviral vector that encodes prepro-CGRP. CGRP
      inhibitors have therapeutic potential in conditions in which excessive
      CGRP-mediated vasodilatation is present; neurogenic inflammation, migraine and
      other headaches, thermal injury, circulatory shock and flushing in menopause.
      CGRP inhibitors include capsaicin, antagonists at capsaicin/vanilloid receptors, 
      civamide, CGRP receptor antagonists and 5-HT1D-receptor agonists. Drugs that are 
      5-HT1D-receptor agonists, the 'triptans' are already commonly used in migraine
      and the first small molecule CGRP antagonist, BIBN4096BS, is under clinical
      investigation for the treatment of migraine.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of subcutaneous almotriptan for the treatment of acute 
      migraine: a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, dose-finding study.
PG  - 1867-75
AB  - BACKGROUND: The 5-hydroxytryptamine-receptor agonist almotriptan was found to be 
      well tolerated and efficacious when administered orally in clinical trials of
      migraine treatment. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to assess 
      the efficacy and tolerability of 3 different doses of subcutaneous almotriptan in
      the treatment of acute migraine attacks. METHODS: This was a Phase II
      multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group,
      dose-finding study conducted over 7 months at 13 practice-oriented centers and 1 
      larger research-focused center. Patients experiencing moderate to severe migraine
      with or without aura, as defined by International Headache Society criteria, were
      randomly assigned to receive a single subcutaneous dose of almotriptan 2, 6, or
      10 mg or placebo. The primary end point, pain relief at 2 hours, was
      self-assessed on a 4-point scale (severe, moderate, mild, or no pain). Patients
      indicating mild or no pain were considered responders. The analysis was performed
      on an intent-to-treat basis. RESULTS: A total of 123 patients were enrolled (23
      men, 100 women). Overall, almotriptan 6 and 10 mg were significantly more
      effective than placebo (P < 0.05, Fisher exact test). Response rates for the 6-
      and 10-mg doses were 96.5% and 90.3%, respectively, compared with 50.0% for
      placebo (P < 0.05, Fisher exact test). The proportion of patients with pain
      relief at 2 hours was not significantly different between almotriptan 2 mg and
      placebo. The response profile for the secondary end points was also better with
      almotriptan 6 and 10 mg than with placebo. Administration of almotriptan was well
      tolerated; the most frequently observed drug-associated adverse event was
      transient local irritation at the injection site. CONCLUSIONS: Almotriptan was
      well tolerated and significantly more effective than placebo in relieving
      moderate to severe migraine pain when administered as a single 6- or 10-mg
      subcutaneous dose.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and safety of oral eletriptan during different phases of the
      menstrual cycle in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 1339-44
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetics and safety of
      eletriptan in different phases of the menstrual cycle. Female volunteers (n = 16)
      with a regular menstrual cycle (28 +/- 4 days) received a single oral dose of 80 
      mg eletriptan during each of the four cycle phases: phase 1 (menses), days 1 to
      4; phase 2 (follicular), days 6 to 10; phase 3 (ovulatory), days 11 to 13; and
      phase 4 (luteal), days 21 to 24. Eletriptan plasma concentrations were determined
      from serial plasma samples taken during a 24-hourperiod after dosing. Blood
      pressure, pulse rate, and ECG measurements were performed at baseline, 1 and 24
      hours after dosing. No significant differences between phases were observed for
      maximum plasma concentration (cmax, range of means = 188-234 ng/ml), time to
      maximum concentration (tmax, range of means = 1.8-2.5 h), or systemic exposure
      (area under the curve [AUC], range of means = 1194-1514 ng x h/ml). Although
      there was a statistically significant difference in the terminal phase
      elimination rate constant (kel) between phases 1 and2 (0.175/h vs. 0.158/h, p =
      0.044), the corresponding difference in terminal phase half-life (t 1/2) (4.0 h
      vs. 4.4 h) was not considered to be clinicallyrelevant. No clinically relevant
      differences in blood pressure, pulse rate, or ECG were observed, and the
      incidence, nature, and severity of adverse events were similar in all phases. The
      different phases of the menstrual cycle had no clinically significant effect on
      the pharmacokinetics, safety, or tolerability of oral 80 mg eletriptan in healthy
      females.

TI  - Patient treatment preferences and the 5-HT1B/1D agonists.
PG  - 2545-53
AB  - Migraineurs have specific preferences with regard to migraine therapy. In
      surveys, they consistently cite several attributes they seek in a migraine
      medication: rapid pain relief, complete pain relief, ability to return to normal 
      functioning, relief of migraine-associated symptoms, reduction in headache
      recurrence, and minimal adverse effects. When prescribing medication for patients
      with migraine, physicians should respect patients' treatment preferences and
      select drugs that most closely meet patients' needs. As a class, the 5-HT(1B/1D) 
      agonists, or triptans, have many of these attributes, including effectively
      relieving pain and associated symptoms and allowing patients to return fairly
      quickly to their normal activities. However, differences have emerged in the
      ability of specific triptans to satisfy patient preferences. Physicians should
      consider these differences when prescribing triptans for their patients with
      migraine.

AB  - black triangle Frovatriptan, a new serotonin receptor agonist developed for the
      acute treatment of migraine, has high affinity for serotonin 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D
      receptor subtypes and is a potent stimulator of contraction in human basilar
      arteries. black triangle A long terminal elimination half-life (approximately 26 
      hours) is a distinctive pharmacokinetic feature of frovatriptan which appears to 
      be independent of dose, age, gender and renal function. black triangle A single
      oral dose of frovatriptan 2.5mg was effective in the acute treatment of migraine 
      providing meaningful relief within 2 hours to approximately twice as many
      recipients as placebo in clinical trials. black triangle Consistent relief of
      migraine symptoms was achieved in patients who treated a number of consecutive
      attacks with frovatriptan and the incidence of 24-hour migraine recurrence was
      reduced. black triangle Frovatriptan was well tolerated in clinical trials, with 
      the overall incidence of adverse events occurring with frovatriptan 2.5mg only
      slightly higher than that reported with placebo. Mild to moderate fatigue, nausea
      and paraesthesia were the most commonly reported drug-related adverse events.

TI  - Intranasal sumatriptan in post-ECT headache: results of an open-label trial.
PG  - 280-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: Significant headaches occur in up to 45% of patients receiving
      electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) as a result of treatment. Headaches may at times 
      be severe and affect patient compliance with this treatment modality. The
      5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonist sumatriptan has been reported to be effective for
      post-ECT headache in several case reports. The aim of the present open-label
      study was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of intranasal sumatriptan for
      post-ECT headache. METHOD: Patients undergoing ECT who experienced
      moderate-to-severe post-ECT headache were enrolled in the study. Patients were
      asked to rate their headache severity and describe headache characteristics using
      a standard headache diary. Headaches rated as severe or moderate were treated
      with 20 mg of intranasal sumatriptan. Additional headache ratings were recorded
      at 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2 hours after sumatriptan administration and compared
      with baseline values. RESULTS: Eight female patients (ages 34-45 years old)
      participated in the trial and experienced a total of 13 post-ECT headaches, which
      were treated with intranasal sumatriptan. Of the headaches treated, six (46.2%)
      were described as severe and seven (53.8%) were characterized as moderate in
      severity. Twelve (92.3%) of the treated headaches responded by the 2 hour
      posttreatment time point and 11 (84.6%) had responded within 1 hour. Comparisons 
      made at the 1- and 2-hour time point revealed a statistically significant
      improvement from baseline (p = 0.002). Of the 12 headaches that responded, 6
      (50%) were reported as no pain and 5 (38.5%) were reported as only mild pain at 1
      hour following treatment. At the 2-hour assessment, an additional headache, which
      had previously not responded, was rated at mild resulting in six (50%) headaches 
      with complete resolution of pain and six (50%) with a decrease in pain symptoms
      from moderate or severe to mild. Overall, sumatriptan treatment was well
      tolerated, and no significant adverse effects or changes in vital signs were
      recorded. In no case was a second dose of sumatriptan given. The most common
      complaint was the taste of the medication (n = 4), which was not treatment
      limiting. No patient withdrew from the study due to an adverse event. CONCLUSION:
      Intranasal sumatriptan spray may be an effective, well-tolerated, and prompt
      treatment for patients experiencing moderate-to-severe post-ECT headache.
      Preventing post-ECT headache may contribute to patient compliance with the ECT
      treatment modality. Additionally, the known pharmacologic effects of sumatriptan 
      and the generally positive results found in the present study suggest that
      ECT-induced headache is vascular in origin. Further placebo-controlled,
      double-blind studies are needed to confirm our open-label results.

TI  - Oral triptans (serotonin 5-HT(1B/1D) agonists) in acute migraine treatment: a
      meta-analysis of 53 trials.
PG  - 1668-75
AB  - BACKGROUND: The triptans, selective serotonin 5-HT(1B/1D) agonists, are very
      effective acute migraine drugs with a well- developed scientific rationale. Seven
      different triptans will soon be clinically available, making evidence-based
      selection guidelines necessary. Triptan trials have similar designs, facilitating
      meta-analysis; this will provide a foundation for using triptans in clinical
      practice. METHOD: We asked pharmaceutical companies and the principal
      investigators of company-independent trials for raw patient data of all
      double-blind, randomised, controlled, clinical trials of oral triptans in
      migraine. We calculated summary estimates across studies for important efficacy
      and tolerability parameters, and separately summarised direct comparator trials. 
      RESULTS: 53 clinical trials (12 unpublished) involving 24089 patients, met the
      criteria for inclusion. Mean results for 100 mg sumatriptan were 59% (95% CI
      57-60) for 2 h headache response (improvement from moderate or severe to mild or 
      no pain); 29% (27-30) for 2 h pain free (improvement to no pain); 20% (18-21) for
      sustained pain free (pain free by 2 h and no headache recurrence or use of rescue
      medication 2-24 h post dose); and 67% (63-70) for consistency (response in at
      least two of three treated attacks); placebo-subtracted proportions for patients 
      with at least one adverse event (AE) were 13% (8-18), for at least one central
      nervous system AE 6% (3-9), and for at least one chest AE 1.9% (1.0-2.7).
      Compared with these data, 10 mg rizatriptan showed better efficacy and
      consistency, and similar tolerability; 80 mg eletriptan showed better efficacy,
      similar consistency, but lower tolerability; 12.5 mg almotriptan showed similar
      efficacy at 2 h but better other results; 2.5 mg naratriptan and 20 mg eletriptan
      showed lower efficacy and (the first two) better tolerability; 2.5 mg and 5 mg
      zolmitriptan, 40 mg eletriptan, and 5 mg rizatriptan showed very similar results.
      The results of the 22 trials that directly compared triptans show the same
      overall pattern. We received no data on frovatriptan, but publicly available data
      suggest lower efficacy. INTERPRETATION: At marketed doses, all oral triptans were
      effective and well tolerated. 10 mg rizatriptan, 80 mg eletriptan, and 12.5 mg
      almotriptan provide the highest likelihood of consistent success.

AB  - Migraine and tension-type headaches have always plagued mankind. In spite of all 
      the research dollars spent trying to determine the etiologies of these headaches,
      the neurology community still has not established a known cause of migraine and

TI  - Dose finding, placebo-controlled study of oral almotriptan in the acute treatment
      of migraine.
PG  - 1811-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and tolerability of oral almotriptan, a
      selective serotonin receptor (5-HT1B/1D) agonist, when used at different doses in
      the treatment of acute migraine. METHODS: This was a placebo controlled,
      double-blind, parallel-group, dose-finding study. Patients satisfying
      International Headache Society criteria for acute migraine were randomized to a
      single dose of placebo or oral almotriptan 2, 6.25, 12.5, or 25 mg at the onset
      of moderate or severe pain. Patients graded pain intensity on a 4-point verbal
      scale from 0 (no pain) to 3 (severe pain) and recorded adverse events. The
      primary efficacy variable was headache response at 2 hours. Data were analyzed on
      an intent-to-treat basis. RESULTS: Nine hundred and three patients were
      randomized, and 742 were included in the evaluation of the efficacy and
      tolerability. Headache response at 2 hours was 32.5% with placebo, and 30%,
      56.3%, 58.5%, and 66.5% with almotriptan 2, 6.25, 12.5, and 25 mg doses (p < 0.05
      for 6.25, 12.5, and 25 mg vs placebo). A dose-dependent decrease in the incidence
      of migraine-associated symptoms and the need for escape medication was observed. 
      The incidence of adverse events with the almotriptan 2-mg, 6.25-mg, and 12.5-mg
      groups was comparable to that with the placebo group. CONCLUSION: Almotriptan
      12.5 mg demonstrated the most favorable ratio between efficacy and tolerability, 
      offering equivalent efficacy and better tolerability compared with the 25 mg
      dose. The minimum effective dose of almotriptan was 6.25 mg.

TI  - Development of CGRP antagonists for the treatment of migraine.
PG  - 1261-8
AB  - Migraine is one of the most common neurological disorders, involving periodical
      attacks of headache and nausea as well as a plethora of other symptoms. Although 
      considerable progress has been made, the pathophysiology of migraine is still not
      understood. However, several observations point to an involvement of calcitonin
      gene-related peptide (CGRP). Migraine headache involves the activation of the
      trigeminal system and dilatation of cranial vessels. CGRP is localized to neurons
      in the trigeminal ganglia and CGRP levels are increased during a migraine attack,
      presumably causing the vasodilation observed. Accordingly, it is conceivable that
      inhibition of CGRP-evoked dilatation of the cranial vessels may provide a novel
      treatment for migraine headache. The non-peptidic CGRP antagonist BIBN-4096BS
      (Boehringer Ingelheim) is presently under clinical investigation to assess the
      importance of CGRP in migraine headache and to answer the question of whether the
      concept of CGRP antagonists may offer advantages, e.g., higher efficacy, lower
      recurrence rate or improved side-effect profile, compared to the currently used
      antimigraine drugs.

TI  - Clinical features of withdrawal headache following overuse of triptans and other 
      headache drugs.
PG  - 1694-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Complete withdrawal from headache medication is the treatment of
      choice for medication-overuse headache. Discontinuation of the overused headache 
      medication, however, results in the development of withdrawal headache, often
      associated with nausea, vomiting, and sleep disturbances. METHOD: In a
      prospective study of 95 patients, the authors investigated the duration and
      severity of withdrawal headache after overuse of various headache drugs,
      including single and combination analgesics, ergots, and triptans. All patients
      underwent standard inpatient withdrawal therapy for 14 days. RESULTS: The
      duration of withdrawal headache was shorter in patients overusing triptans (4.1
      days) than in patients overusing ergots (6.7 days) or analgesics (9.5 days; p <
      0.002). The mean headache intensity on the first day of withdrawal did not differ
      between the groups (p = 0.821). By day 14, however, it was lower in patients
      overusing triptans (0.08) than in patients overusing ergots (0.4) or analgesics
      (0.9; p < 0.005). Rescue medication was requested less by patients undergoing
      triptan withdrawal (0.25 requests) than by patients undergoing ergot withdrawal
      (1.25) or analgesic withdrawal (1.85; p < 0.05). Similar to findings in the
      entire patient population, withdrawal headache was shorter and less severe in
      migraineurs overusing triptans than in those overusing ergots or analgesics.
      Because only patients with migraine, but no patient with tension-type headache,
      overused triptans, withdrawal headache was shorter in the group of patients with 
      migraine alone (6.7 days versus 9.6 days for patients with tension-type headache 
      and 8.5 days for patients with combination headache, p < 0.02). CONCLUSION: The
      duration and severity of withdrawal clearly depend on the type of overused
      headache drug only.

      comparison between ethnic groups.
PG  - 873-82
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate efficacy and tolerability of subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg
      versus placebo for acute migraine between ethnic groups. BACKGROUND: Patients in 
      previous sumatriptan studies have been predominantly Caucasian and the effects of
      sumatriptan between different ethnic groups are unknown. METHODS: This was a
      multicenter, 3-phase, 12-attack study. Phases I and III (inclinic) were
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover designs. Phase II
      (outpatient) was a single-blind design. Sumatriptan was compared to placebo
      across 2 groups (non-Caucasian and Caucasian) and individual ethnic subgroups
      (black, Hispanic, and others). Headache response, pain-free response, associated 
      symptoms, and clinical disability were assessed. Tolerability assessments
      included the incidence of adverse events, physical examinations, vital signs,
      electrocardiograms, and clinical laboratory data. RESULTS: Two hundred patients
      treated at least one migraine attack (150 non-Caucasians: 46 blacks, 68
      Hispanics, 36 others). Two hours postdose, significantly more inclinic
      sumatriptan-treated patients reported headache response (non-Caucasians, 81%
      versus 37% placebo; Caucasians, 87% versus 19% placebo; P<.001) and mild or no
      clinical disability, compared with placebo (non-Caucasians, 87% versus 50%
      placebo; Caucasians, 90% versus 38% placebo; P<.001). Blacks (80%), Hispanics
      (83%), and others (74%) reported similar patterns of headache response at 2
      hours. Similar results were reported during the outpatient phase. The incidence
      of adverse events following sumatriptan during the inclinic phase was similar
      between ethnic groups (non-Caucasian, 75%; Caucasian, 79%) and higher than
      placebo (non-Caucasian, 51%; Caucasian, 31%). Overall, adverse events in the
      outpatient phase of the study were lower than in the inclinic phase. CONCLUSION: 
      Sumatriptan injection is effective and well tolerated in non-Caucasians and
      Caucasians for the treatment of acute migraine attacks. Only minor differences in
      efficacy or tolerability were observed between blacks, Hispanics, and others.

TI  - Mixing sumatriptan: a prospective study of stratified care using multiple
      formulations.
PG  - 862-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the acceptability, utility, and tolerability of a system of 
      stratified care of acute migraine using multiple formulations of sumatriptan.
      BACKGROUND: Stratified care matches the treatment of a disease to its level of
      severity. Sumatriptan, with its multiple formulations, seems a logical option in 
      a stratified care approach. Little data exists on the use of multiple
      formulations in a single patient population. DESIGN AND METHODS: A prospective,
      open-label, outpatient study recruited patients from a single center during the
      period from January 1998 through June 1998. Entry criteria included International
      Headache Society migraine diagnostic codes 1.1 or 1.2 and an established response
      to sumatriptan tablets or nasal spray. Patients who enrolled were allowed to use 
      subcutaneous sumatriptan as either primary or rescue therapy for individual
      migraine attacks. RESULTS: Two hundred eighteen (80%) of 273 patients on tablets 
      and 40 (85%) of 47 patients on nasal spray enrolled. During a period of 6 months,
      61% of the patients on tablets and 85% of the patients using the nasal spray used
      at least one subcutaneous dose of sumatriptan. This system was efficacious and
      well tolerated. The majority of injections were used as rescue treatments
      following a failed oral or nasal dose. Two percent withdrew due to lack of
      efficacy, and 6% withdrew due to adverse events; however, 92% professed
      satisfaction with subcutaneous sumatriptan as an available tool for migraine
      management. CONCLUSION: A system of stratified care using multiple formulations
      of sumatriptan is efficacious, well tolerated, and preferable to a program
      involving a single form of the drug.

TI  - Treatment of migraine with targeted nutrition focused on improved assimilation
      and elimination.
PG  - 488-94
AB  - This study was undertaken to assess the impact of three months of targeted
      nutritional therapy for migraine on health-related quality of life. The study is 
      also intended to lend support to a theory that migraine is caused by an
      underlying dysfunction involving assimilation or elimination mechanisms. Forty
      people were selected from approximately 120 applications. Fourteen participants
      were selected from among those applicants within the authors' practices and 26
      from applicants solicited via the Internet. Participants were required to
      complete the Medical Outcomes Trust Migraine Specific Quality of Life (MSQ)
      Questionnaire. Eighty percent of the study participants experienced significant
      and sustained improvements in quality of life during the 90 days of the study.
      The study instrument is specifically designed to measure quality of life
      improvement and thus does not solicit responses relative to number of migraine
      attacks or duration of each migraine. However, it should be noted that
      improvement in quality of life is likely due to a reduction in the duration and
      frequency of migraine attacks.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit of sumatriptan in patients with migraine.
PG  - 1093-101
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit of initiating
      sumatriptan therapy in patients with acute migraine who were previously taking
      nontriptan drugs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is an economic analysis of a
      prospective, pretest-posttest, observational 6-month outcomes study of 178
      patients with a physician diagnosis of migraine who received their first
      prescription for sumatriptan between October 1994 and August 1996 and were
      members of a mixed-model managed care organization in western Pennsylvania.
      Migraine-related resource use data were obtained from the managed care
      organization's medical and pharmacy claims databases. The primary outcome measure
      for this economic analysis was the total disability time that patients
      experienced because of migraine. Patients reported time missed from work and
      usual nonwork activities because of migraine on self-administered questionnaires 
      at baseline and at 3 and 6 months after initiation of sumatriptan. RESULTS:
      Initiation of sumatriptan resulted in a decrease of 662 migraine-disability-days 
      for work and 1236 migraine-disability-days for nonwork activities during the 6
      months of the study (decrease from 27.8 to 17.2 days per person), totaling 1898
      migraine-disability-days averted with sumatriptan therapy. Migraine-related
      medical costs were lower after sumatriptan was initiated ($18,351 vs $26,192),
      whereas migraine-related pharmacy costs were lower with prior nontriptan drug
      therapy ($22,209 vs $74,861). The overall net cost savings after sumatriptan was 
      initiated in these patients was $222,332 ($1249 per patient) with a
      benefit-to-cost ratio of $5.67 gained for each health care dollar spent from a
      societal perspective. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $25 for each
      additional migraine-disability-day averted by using sumatriptan vs nontriptan
      drug therapy. Sensitivity analysis showed that changes in medical costs had
      little effect on the ratios and that sumatriptan remained cost-beneficial across 
      a wide range of patient wages. CONCLUSION: This study showed that initiation of
      sumatriptan in patients previously receiving nontriptan therapy was
      cost-effective and had an economic benefit for patients, employers, and society. 
      Sumatriptan also helped patients and physicians achieve goals recommended by the 
      US Headache Consortium by reducing patients' disability and thus improving their 
      ability to function at work and nonwork activities.

TI  - Different approaches to valuing the lost productivity of patients with migraine.
PG  - 917-25
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To calculate and compare the human capital approach (HCA) and friction
      cost approach (FCA) methods for estimating the cost of lost productivity of
      migraineurs after the initiation of sumatriptan from a US societal perspective.
      DESIGN: Secondary, retrospective analysis to a prospective observational study.
      SETTING: A mixed-model managed care organisation in western Pennsylvania, USA.
      PATIENTS: Patients with migraine using sumatriptan therapy. INTERVENTIONS:
      Patient-reported questionnaires collected at baseline, 3 and 6 months after
      initiation of sumatriptan therapy. OUTCOME MEASURES: The cost of lost
      productivity estimated with the HCA and FCA methods. RESULTS: Of the 178 patients
      who completed the study, 51% were full-time employees, 13% were part-time, 18%
      were not working and 17% changed work status. Twenty-four percent reported a
      clerical or administrative position. From the HCA, the estimated total cost of
      lost productivity for 6 months following the initiation of sumatriptan was
      $US117905 (1996 values). From the FCA, the six-month estimated total cost of lost
      productivity ranged from $US28329 to $US117905 (1996 values). CONCLUSIONS: This
      was the first study to retrospectively estimate lost productivity of patients
      with migraine using the FCA methodology. Our results demonstrate that depending
      on the assumptions and illustrations employed, the FCA can yield lost
      productivity estimates that vary greatly as a percentage of the HCA estimate.
      Prospective investigations are needed to better determine the components and the 
      nature of the lost productivity for chronic episodic diseases such as migraine
      headache.

TI  - Patient satisfaction with rizatriptan versus other triptans: direct head-to-head 
      comparisons.
PG  - 552-6
AB  - This study summarises the impact of treatment with rizatriptan 10 mg versus other
      5-HT 1B/1D receptor agonists (triptans) on patient satisfaction with medication. 
      Rizatriptan is a potent, selective 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist shown to be fast,
      effective and well tolerated in the acute treatment of migraine. We investigated 
      patients' overall satisfaction with treatment in studies in which direct
      comparisons with other triptans were made. Data from five double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trials in which rizatriptan 10 mg was compared with another
      triptan were included in the analysis. Rizatriptan 10 mg was compared with
      sumatriptan 100 mg in one parallel study (n = 916), sumatriptan 50 mg in two
      crossover studies (n = 1599), naratriptan 2.5 mg in one parallel study (n = 502),
      and zolmitriptan 2.5 mg in one parallel study (n = 701). Satisfaction was
      reported by patients on a seven-point scale ranging from 'completely satisfied,
      couldn't be better' to 'completely dissatisfied, couldn't be worse' at 2 hours
      after dosing. The percent of patients in the top two 'satisfied' categories
      (completely or very satisfied) were analysed. More patients on rizatriptan 10 mg 
      were completely or very satisfied compared with sumatriptan 100 mg (33% vs 26%, p
      < 0.05), sumatriptan 50 mg (40% vs 35%, p < 0.05), naratriptan 2.5 mg (33% vs
      19%, p < 0.01), and zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (38% vs 30%, p < 0.05). In all five
      studies more patients treated with rizatriptan 10 mg or other triptans were
      completely or very satisfied with treatment than patients receiving placebo (p < 
      0.001, except naratriptan vs placebo p = 0.004). The results, combined with the
      superior efficacy profile (fast, effective, well tolerated) of rizatriptan 10 mg,
      should enhance the treatment of migraine headache and lead to improved
      therapeutic intervention in clinical practice.

TI  - Selective seratonin 1F (5-HT(1F)) receptor agonist LY334370 for acute migraine: a
      randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 1230-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Triptans (5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonists) are effective drugs for
      acute migraine, but the side-effect of coronary vasoconstriction restricts their 
      use in patients who are at risk of coronary artery disease. We have studied the
      efficacy of LY334370, a selective serotonin 1F (5-HT(1F)) receptor agonist with
      preclinical efficacy and no vasoconstriction, for migraine relief. METHODS: We
      gave LY334370 (20, 60, or 200 mg) or placebo to 99 outpatients with moderate or
      severe migraine headaches in a double blind, parallel group study. We measured
      efficacy by sustained response, response at 2 h, pain free at 2 h, and sustained 
      pain free. FINDINGS: The proportions of patients with defined endpoints for
      placebo and LY334370 20, 60, and 200 mg, respectively, were: sustained response, 
      two of 26 (8%), three of 22 (14%), 11 of 30 (37%), and 11 of 21 (52%) (dose
      response p<0.001); response, five of 26 (19%), four of 22 (18%), 15 of 30 (50%), 
      and 15 of 21 (71%) (p<0.001); pain free, one of 26 (4%), none of 22, eight of 30 
      (27%), and eight of 21 (38%) (p=0.001); sustained pain free, one of 26 (4%), none
      of 22, seven of 30 (23%), and seven of 21 (33%) (p=0.002); recurrence rates, one 
      of five (20%), none of four, four of 15 (27%), and three of 15 (20%). More
      patients given LY334370 than placebo reported asthenia, somnolence, and
      dizziness. INTERPRETATION: Our findings show that LY334370 is effective in
      treatment of acute migraine through selective trigeminovascular neuronal
      inhibition.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of oral rizatriptan 10 mg with oral doses of
      sumatriptan, naratriptan, and zolmitriptan on stringent outcome measures.
      METHODS: Retrospective analysis of data from five randomized, placebo-controlled,
      double-masked clinical trials in which oral rizatriptan was directly compared
      with oral sumatriptan 100 mg (n = 772), 50 mg (n = 1116), 25 mg (n = 1183),
      naratriptan 2.5 mg (n = 413), and zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (n = 580) for the acute
      treatment of a moderate or severe migraine attack. OUTCOME MEASURES: Percentage
      of patients pain-free at 2 hours, symptom-free at 2 hours (no pain, nausea,
      photophobia, phonophobia, vomiting, or functional disability), 24-hour sustained 
      pain-free (no headache at 2 hours, no recurrence, and no additional antimigraine 
      medications for 24 hours). RESULTS: More patients taking rizatriptan 10 mg were
      pain-free at 2 hours than were patients taking sumatriptan 100 mg (40% vs 33%, p 
      = 0.019), sumatriptan 50 mg (40% vs 35%, p = 0.009), sumatriptan 25 mg (38% vs
      27%, p < 0.001), naratriptan 2.5 mg (45% vs 21%, p < 0.001), and zolmitriptan 2.5
      mg (43% vs 36%, p = 0.041). More patients taking rizatriptan 10 mg were
      symptom-free at 2 hours than were patients taking sumatriptan 100 mg (31% vs 22%,
      p = 0.002), sumatriptan 50 mg (33% vs 28%, p = 0.003), sumatriptan 25 mg (33% vs 
      24%, p < 0.001), naratriptan 2.5 mg (30% vs 11%, p < 0.001), and zolmitriptan 2.5
      mg (31% vs 24%, p = 0.042). More patients taking rizatriptan 10 mg had a 24-hour 
      sustained pain-free response than did patients taking sumatriptan 100 mg (27% vs 
      23%, p = 0.112), sumatriptan 50 mg (30% vs 26%, p = 0.015), sumatriptan 25 mg
      (27% vs 20%, p = 0.005), naratriptan 2.5 mg (29% vs 17%, p = 0.004), and
      zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (32% vs 24%, p = 0.013). CONCLUSION: Oral rizatriptan 10 mg
      was more effective than oral sumatriptan, naratriptan, and zolmitriptan on
      stringent outcome measures of pain-free response at 2 hours, symptom-free
      response at 2 hours, and 24-hour sustained pain-free response.

TI  - The cost effectiveness of stratified care in the management of migraine.
PG  - 819-29
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost effectivess of a stratified-care regimen for
      patients with migraine--in which patients are stratified by severity of illness, 
      and then prescribed differing treatments according to level of severity--compared
      with a conventional stepped-care approach. DESIGN AND METHODS: A decision
      analytic model was constructed to simulate a controlled clinical trial in which
      patients with migraine receiving primary medical care were randomly assigned to
      treatment under a stepped-care or a stratified-care regimen. A health service
      payer perspective was adopted and the time horizon was 1 year. Data inputs were: 
      (i) the frequency and disability of migraine, derived from population-based
      studies; (ii) disability level-specific treatment response rates for
      over-the-counter analgesics,aspirin/metoclopramide and zolmitriptan as the
      representative of high-end therapy obtained from an international consensus
      opinion enquiry; and (iii) unit costs of healthcare obtained from UK health
      service sources. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS: The estimated 1-year direct
      healthcare costs per primary care patient with migraine were pound sterling
      156.82 for stepped care and sterling pound 151.57 for stratified care. Estimates 
      of treatment response rates were 40 and 71% for stepped and stratified care,
      respectively. The cost per successfully treated attack was sterling pound 23.43
      for stepped care and sterling pound 12.60 for stratified care. Stratified care
      remained cost effective when tested in a wide range of one-way sensitivity
      analyses, and probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed the cost effectiveness of
      stratified care to be significant at the 3% level. Conditional confidence
      analysis showed that the level of confidence in the cost effectiveness of
      stratified care varied positively with the case mix, i.e. in populations where
      the proportion of moderate and severely disabled patients with migraine was
      greater than 25%, the cost effectiveness of stratified care remained
      statistically significant. CONCLUSION: A stratified-care treatment strategy
      (including zolmitriptan as the representative of high-end therapy) is a highly
      cost-effective method of managing migraine in the primary care setting compared
      with stepped care, delivering improved clinical outcomes at no additional cost.

TI  - Drug-resistant cluster headache responding to gabapentin: a pilot study.
PG  - 744-6
AB  - Prompted by the results of gabaergic drugs, such as valproate and topiramate, we 
      performed this pilot study to assess the effect of gabapentin in cluster
      headache. Eight patients suffering from episodic cluster headache and four
      suffering from chronic cluster headache were studied. All of them had failed to
      respond to traditional prophylactic drugs. The design of the study was an open
      trial. The main parameter for effectiveness was the number of daily attacks.
      Gabapentin was given at the daily dosage of 900 mg. All patients were pain free
      after a maximum of 8 days after starting therapy, with a bout duration thus
      reduced to 16-40% of the average previous bouts (only applies to episodic cluster
      patients). We hypothesize that the gabaergic action of gabapentin, perhaps
      combined with other mechanisms, such as calcium channel blockade, may be
      responsible for its remarkable effects on cluster headache.

TI  - Dexamethasone decreases migraine recurrence observed after treatment with a
      triptan combined with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug.
PG  - 708-11
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Triptans are effective drugs for the acute treatment
      of migraine. However, 30-40% of the patients commonly present recurrence before
      24 hours therefore requiring another dose. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
      (NSAID) such as tolfenamic acid and naproxen sodium combined with sumatriptan
      have demonstrated efficacy in reducing recurrence observed with the single use of
      this drug. Steroids also have been suggested to treat refractory migraine and
      status migranosus. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether patients
      presenting frequent recurrence with the combination triptan plus NSAID, would
      decrease it with the association of dexamethasone. METHOD: Twenty three patients,
      17 women and 6 men with migraine according to IHS criteria were prospectively
      studied. All patients presented frequent recurrence (> or= 60%, mean recurrence
      rate 74,8%) with the single use of sumatritpan 100 mg or zolmitriptan 2,5 mg or
      rizatriptan 10mg in at least 5 consecutive attacks, and didn't present a
      reduction of the recurrence rate superior than 20% with the combination of
      tolfenamic acid 200 mg or rofecoxib 25 mg in at least 5 other consecutive attacks
      (mean recurrence rate 60%). The patients had to treat 6 consecutive moderate or
      severe migraine attacks with their usual combination plus 4 mg of dexamathasone
      with a maximum of twice a week, and fill out a diary reporting headache
      parameters. RESULTS: Twenty patients, 16 women and 4 men completed the study. Of 
      those who completed the study, 11 took rizatriptan plus rofecoxib, 4 rizatriptan 
      plus tolfenamic acid, 3 zolmitriptan plus rofecoxib, 1 zolmitriptan plus
      tolfenamic acid and 1 patient took sumatriptan plus tolfenamic acid, having the
      20 patients taken as a third medication, a single tablet of 4 mg of
      dexamethasone. All patients took oral formulations and none presented vomiting
      after that. Among all 20 patients, one female and one male patient presented
      recurrence in 3 out of the 6 attacks (50%) while the remaining 18 patients
      revealed recurrence in 1 or 2 treated attacks (mean 23,4%) (p<0,001). CONCLUSION:
      We concluded that the judicious use of oral dexamethasone might be useful for a
      limited population of migraine patients still presenting recurrence with the
      combination of a triptan and a NSAID. Case-control studies and studies with a
      randomized double-blind design are necessary to confirm these observations.

TI  - Modeling and stimulation for clinical trial design involving a categorical
      response: a phase II case study with naratriptan.
PG  - 1210-9
AB  - PURPOSE: The overall aim of the present study was to investigate retrospectively 
      the feasibility and utility of model-based clinical trial simulation as applied
      to the clinical development of naratriptan with effect measured on a categorical 
      scale. METHODS: A PK-PD model for naratriptan was developed by using information 
      gathered from previous naratriptan and sumatriptan preclinical and clinical
      trials. The phase IIa naratriptan data were used to check the PK-PD model in its 
      ability to describe future data. A further PK-PD model was developed by using the
      phase IIa naratriptan data, and a phase IIb trial was designed by simulation with
      the use of Matlab. The design resulting from clinical trial simulation was
      compared with that derived by using D-optimal design. RESULTS: The PK-PD model
      showed reasonable agreement with the data observed in the phase IIa naratriptan
      clinical trial. Clinical trial simulation resulted in a design with four or five 
      arms at 0 mg, 2.5 and/or 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg, PD measurements to be taken at
      0, 2, and 4 or 6 h and at least 150 patients per arm. A sub-D-optimal design
      resulted in two dosing arms at 0 and 10 mg and PD measurements to be taken at 1
      and 2 h. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical trial simulation is a useful tool for the
      quantitative assessment of the influence of the controllable factors and is the
      only tool for the quantitative assessment of the uncontrollable factors on the
      power of a clinical trial.

TI  - Pregnancy outcome following gestational exposure to venlafaxine: a multicenter
      prospective controlled study.
PG  - 1728-30
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Because there are no studies available on the safety of venlafaxine
      during pregnancy, the authors' goal in this study was to determine whether
      venlafaxine increases the risk for major malformations. METHOD: Data on 150 women
      exposed to venlafaxine during pregnancy in seven pregnancy counseling centers
      were compared with data from studies of pregnant women who 1) received selective 
      serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants (SSRIs) (N=150) and 2) who received 
      nonteratogenic drugs (N=150). RESULTS: Among the 150 women who were exposed to
      venlafaxine during pregnancy, 125 had live births, 18 had spontaneous abortions, 
      and seven had therapeutic abortions; two of the babies had major malformations.
      There were no significant differences between these women and the two comparison 
      groups on any of the measures analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that
      the use of venlafaxine during pregnancy does not increase the rates of major
      malformations above the baseline rate of 1%-3%.

TI  - Effects of medication use on health state in postictal migraineurs.
PG  - 782-91
AB  - We investigated whether headache-free patients with migraine report a lower
      health state compared with healthy controls, and whether health state is
      differently affected during the postattack period after using sumatriptan versus 
      habitual nonvasoactive medication. Mood, health state, and personality
      questionnaires were administered once during an interictal period and twice
      within 30 hours after different migraine attacks treated with sumatriptan or
      habitual nonvasoactive medication. Twenty migraineurs without aura, 10
      migraineurs with aura, and 30 matched and headache-free controls participated in 
      this study. During an interictal period, patients with migraine reported more
      problems regarding social activities and pain compared with healthy controls.
      During the postictal period, mood (fatigue and emotional state) was negatively
      affected by an attack that was treated with habitual medication, whereas health
      state (physical pain, social activities, current pain) was similar to the
      migraine-free period. Sumatriptan treatment had beneficial effects on aspects of 
      health state and mood during the postictal period.

TI  - Effect of rizatriptan and other triptans on the nausea symptom of migraine: a
      post hoc analysis.
PG  - 754-63
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of oral rizatriptan, sumatriptan, naratriptan, 
      and zolmitriptan on the relief and emergence of nausea during a migraine attack. 
      METHODS: Data from five randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical
      trials in which oral rizatriptan 10 mg was directly compared with oral
      sumatriptan 100 mg (N = 772), 50 mg (N = 1168), 25 mg (N = 1180), naratriptan 2.5
      mg (N = 406), or zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (N = 571) for the acute treatment of a
      migraine attack were retrospectively analyzed. Migraine was diagnosed according
      to International Headache Society criteria. Presence or absence of nausea was
      recorded at baseline and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 hours after dosing. The end points
      analyzed were relief of nausea in those who had it at baseline and emergence of
      nausea in those who were free of it at baseline. Treatments were compared using
      odds ratios estimated from logistic regression models at 2 hours, and averaged
      odds ratios for the first 2 hours posttreatment. RESULTS: Approximately 60% of
      patients in each treatment group had nausea at baseline. In those patients with
      nausea at baseline, significantly more patients treated with rizatriptan 10 mg
      were free of nausea at 2 hours compared with sumatriptan 100 mg (66% versus 58%, 
      P =.043), sumatriptan 50 mg (68% versus 57%, P =.010), sumatriptan 25 mg (68%
      versus 59%, P =.017), and naratriptan 2.5 mg (59% versus 45%, P =.014). Averaging
      over the four posttreatment time points in the first 2 hours, significantly more 
      patients treated with rizatriptan 10 mg were free of nausea compared with
      sumatriptan 100 mg (P =.004), sumatriptan 50 mg (P =.001), and naratriptan 2.5 mg
      (P =.015). No significant differences in nausea relief were seen between
      rizatriptan 10 mg and zolmitriptan 2.5 mg, either at 2 hours (65% versus 61%, P
      =.210) or over the first 2 hours (P =.781). Rates of treatment-emergent nausea at
      2 hours ranged from 11% to 18% with placebo, from 5% to 13% with rizatriptan 10
      mg, and from 10% to 20% with other comparator triptans. CONCLUSIONS: Oral
      rizatriptan 10 mg was more effective than oral sumatriptan and naratriptan at
      eliminating nausea within 2 hours in patients who had it at baseline. Rates of
      emergent nausea in patients who were free of it at baseline were low, and no
      consistent differences were observed between active treatments.

      an orally disintegrating formulation of rizatriptan, a selective 5-HT1B/1D
      receptor agonist. This study was conducted to determine patient preference
      between rizatriptan ODT 10-mg and sumatriptan 50-mg tablet for the acute
      treatment of migraine. METHODS: This was a multicenter, randomized, open-label,
      two-period crossover study conducted in the United States with 524 enrolled
      patients. Patients treated a single moderate or severe headache in each treatment
      period. Patients treated one migraine with either rizatriptan ODT 10-mg or
      sumatriptan 50-mg tablet, then treated a second migraine with the alternate
      therapy. Patients completed diary assessments at baseline, and 30, 45, 60, 90,
      and 120 minutes postdose and rated headache severity on a 4-point scale (0 =
      none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe). At the final study visit following
      treatment of their second migraine, patients expressed preference for one of the 
      two study medications by completing an interviewer-administered Global Preference
      Question and then responded to a self-administered series of questions to capture
      their most important reason for preferring one study medication over the other.
      Safety measurements were recorded through standard adverse experience reporting. 
      RESULTS: Three hundred eighty-six patients treated two migraine attacks. For
      those patients who expressed a preference for either rizatriptan ODT or
      sumatriptan (n = 374), the percentage of patients who preferred rizatriptan ODT
      10-mg (57%, n = 213) was significantly greater than those who preferred
      sumatriptan 50-mg tablet (43%, n = 161) (P<.01). For those patients who treated
      two migraine attacks and had drug severity measures for both attacks (n = 384), a
      significantly greater percentage of patients reported pain relief after taking
      rizatriptan ODT than sumatriptan at the 45- and 60-minute time points (38% versus
      29% and 58% versus 49%, respectively) (P<.01). In addition, a significantly
      greater percentage of patients taking rizatriptan ODT reported a pain-free status
      at the 60- and 120-minute time points (23% versus 17% [P<.05] and 60% versus 52% 
      [P<.01], respectively). Both rizatriptan ODT and sumatriptan were well tolerated.
      CONCLUSIONS: A significantly greater proportion of patients preferred rizatriptan
      ODT 10-mg to sumatriptan 50-mg tablet for the acute treatment of migraine.
      Efficacy and safety data are consistent with the preference findings.

TI  - Donitriptan (Pierre Fabre).
PG  - 415-8
AB  - Pierre Fabre is developing donitriptan, a piperazide 5-HT1D agonist, as a
      potential treatment for migraine [175854]. In January 2001, donitriptan had
      completed phase I trials for migraine and was scheduled to enter phase II
      development [396027]. This compound has an increased potency and, importantly,
      markedly higher intrinsic activity in comparison to the well described tryptamine
      derivatives, naratriptan, zolmitriptan and sumatriptan [295769].

TI  - Lack of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interaction between rizatriptan and
      paroxetine.
PG  - 192-9
AB  - Rizatriptan is a potent, oral 5-HT(1B/1D) agonist with a rapid onset of action
      being investigated for the acute treatment of migraine. This study examined the
      clinical and pharmacolinetic interaction between rizatriptan and the selective
      serotonin reuptake inhibitor, paroxetine. In this two-period crossover study, 12 
      healthy young subjects (6 males and 6 females) received 1 mg rizatriptan
      following 14 days of treatment with placebo or paroxetine (20 mg once daily).
      Plasma was sampled for rizatriptan and N-monodesmethyl rizatriptan, a minor but
      active metabolite of rizatriptan. Safety evaluations included monitoring for
      adverse events, vital signs, and visual analog scale assessment of mood. Plasma
      levels of rizatriptan and N-monodesmethyl rizatriptan were not altered when
      rizatriptan was administered with paroxetine compared to the placebo. Clinically,
      coadministration of rizatriptan with paroxetine was well tolerated. Blood
      pressure, heart rate, and temperature changes during the observation period did
      not differ to a clinically significant degree when rizatriptan was administered
      with paroxetine compared to the placebo. No effects on mood occurred following
      treatment with the combination compared to rizatriptan alone. Adverse events
      following rizatriptan administration with paroxetine were similar to those
      reported when rizatriptan was given with the placebo.

TI  - Effectiveness of nasal sumatriptan in 5- to 12-year-old children.
PG  - 693-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the tolerability and effectiveness of nasal sumatriptan in
      the treatment of migraine in 5- to 12-year-old children. BACKGROUND: Although
      headaches are a common disorder and occur in up to 10.6% of children, many of the
      new migraine abortive agents have not been well evaluated in this population. It 
      has recently been reported that nasal sumatriptan is effective in the treatment
      of migraine in adolescents. In younger children, it is yet to be characterized.
      In addition, many children have significant amounts of vomiting with their
      migraines, limiting their use of oral medications. DESIGN AND METHODS: Children
      with headache were evaluated by a child neurologist, child psychologist, and
      pediatric nurse practitioner. Clinical and International Headache Society
      diagnoses were established for each child. Patients with headaches that were
      either unresponsive to oral medications or had significant vomiting were treated 
      with nasal sumatriptan. Initial administration and tolerability were performed in
      the Headache Center at Cincinnati's Children's Hospital Medical Center. Patients 
      or their parents were contacted to assess the overall effectiveness of nasal
      sumatriptan after home administration. RESULTS: Ten patients aged between 5 and
      12 years (mean, 9.9 years) received either a 5-mg (n = 2) or 20-mg (n = 8) dose
      of sumatriptan. All 10 patients had a clinical diagnosis of migraine; 7 met the
      International Headache Society criteria for migraine. The mean age of headache
      onset was 6.6 years. A total of 57 headaches were treated; 47 (82.5%) responded
      to sumatriptan. Of the patients who treated headaches, the mean number of
      headaches treated was 5.2, while the mean number of responsive headaches was 4.3.
      One patient had no response, 2 patients had a 50% response, and 6 patients had
      100% response to the nasal sumatriptan. Three patients reported persistent "bad
      taste." CONCLUSIONS: This report demonstrates that nasal sumatriptan may be
      effective in aborting migraine in young children (aged 5 to 12 years). It also
      suggests that there may be subgroups for which it works well. This information
      suggests that double-blind, placebo-controlled studies are necessary to determine
      the overall effectiveness of nasal sumatriptan in this age group.

TI  - Prevalence and burden of migraine in the United States: data from the American
      Migraine Study II.
PG  - 646-57
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence, sociodemographic profile, and the burden
      of migraine in the United States in 1999 and to compare results with the original
      American Migraine Study, a 1989 population-based study employing identical
      methods. METHODS: A validated, self-administered questionnaire was mailed to a
      sample of 20 000 households in the United States. Each household member with
      severe headache was asked to respond to questions about symptoms, frequency, and 
      severity of headaches and about headache-related disability. Diagnostic criteria 
      for migraine were based on those of the International Headache Society. This
      report is restricted to individuals 12 years and older. RESULTS: Of the 43 527
      age-eligible individuals, 29 727 responded to the questionnaire for a 68.3%
      response rate. The prevalence of migraine was 18.2% among females and 6.5% among 
      males. Approximately 23% of households contained at least one member suffering
      from migraine. Migraine prevalence was higher in whites than in blacks and was
      inversely related to household income. Prevalence increased from aged 12 years to
      about aged 40 years and declined thereafter in both sexes. Fifty-three percent of
      respondents reported that their severe headaches caused substantial impairment in
      activities or required bed rest. Approximately 31% missed at least 1 day of work 
      or school in the previous 3 months because of migraine; 51% reported that work or
      school productivity was reduced by at least 50%. CONCLUSIONS: Two
      methodologically identical national surveys in the United States conducted 10
      years apart show that the prevalence and distribution of migraine have remained
      stable over the last decade. Migraine-associated disability remains substantial
      and pervasive. The number of migraineurs has increased from 23.6 million in 1989 
      to 27.9 million in 1999 commensurate with the growth of the population. Migraine 
      is an important target for public health interventions because it is highly
      prevalent and disabling.

TI  - An open preference study with sumatriptan 50 mg and zolmitriptan 2.5 mg in 100
      migraine patients.
PG  - 680-4
AB  - Understanding factors influencing patients' preference will improve guidance to
      make rational choices in expanded symptomatic migraine treatment. The objective
      of this open-label, cross-over study was to explore patients' preferences for
      sumatriptan 50 mg vs. zolmitriptan 2.5 mg tablets, focusing on factors
      influencing this preference. One hundred consecutive migraine patients attending 
      our clinics were asked to treat three attacks with each medication and then fill 
      out a preference questionnaire. Ninety-four migraineurs completed the trial and
      42 (44%, 95% CI 34-58%) reported that they preferred zolmitriptan 2.5 mg over
      sumatriptan 50 mg tablets and 27 (29%, 20-38%) preferred sumatriptan 50 mg. The
      remaining 25 (27%, 18-36%) did not show any preference. For the initial treatment
      of the attacks, there were more patients needing just one tablet of zolmitriptan 
      2.5 mg compared with sumatriptan 50 mg (67 vs. 39%). The reasons for preference
      among those 69 patients who had shown preference for either of the two triptans
      were: a faster onset of action (speed of onset) (73%), a longer duration of the
      effects (39%), fewer adverse events (35%) and lower price (13%). Only one-quarter
      of the studied migraine population thought that sumatriptan 50 mg and
      zolmitriptan 2.5 mg were equivalent, which suggests that most migraine patients
      differentiate between triptans. A faster onset of action (speed of onset) was the
      most important reason for preference.

TI  - The efficacy and safety of sc alniditan vs. sc sumatriptan in the acute treatment
      of migraine: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 672-9
AB  - This double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre,
      multinational, phase-III trial was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of 
      a single subcutaneous injection of placebo, 2 doses of alniditan (1.4 mg and 1.8 
      mg) and 6 mg of sumatriptan in subjects with acute migraine. A total of 114
      investigators from 13 different countries screened 2021 subjects. In total 924
      patients were treated with placebo (157), alniditan 1.4 mg (309), alniditan 1.8
      mg (141) and sumatriptan 6 mg (317). The lower number of subjects in the
      alniditan 1.8 mg group is due to the termination of this trial arm after the
      incidence of a serious adverse event and a subsequent protocol amendment. The
      number of subjects who were pain free at 2 h (primary endpoint) was: 22 (14.1%)
      with placebo, 174 (56.3%) with alniditan 1.4 mg, 87 (61.7%) with alnditan 1.8 mg 
      and 209 (65.9%) with sumatriptan 6 mg. Alniditan 1.4 mg was significantly better 
      (P < 0.001) than placebo and sumatriptan was significantly better (P = 0.015)
      than alniditan 1.4 mg. The number of responders (reduction of headache severity
      from moderate or severe headache before treatment to mild or absent at 2 h), was 
      59 (37.8%) on placebo, 250 (80.9%) on alniditan 1.4 mg, 120 (85.1%) on alniditan 
      1.8 mg, and 276 (87.1%) on sumatriptan. Response was significantly higher (P <
      0.001) with alniditan 1.4 mg than with placebo, and significantly lower (P =
      0.036) with alniditan 1.4 mg than with sumatriptan. Recurrence rates were: 22
      (37.3%) with placebo, 87 (34.8%) with alniditan 1.4 mg, 35 (29.2%) with alniditan
      1.8 mg and 108 (39.1%) with sumatriptan. Adverse events occurred in 577/924
      (62.4%) subjects, i.e. in 62/157 (39.5%) with placebo, 214/309 (69.3%) with
      alniditan 1.4 mg, 91/141 (64.5%) with alniditan 1.8 mg and 210/317 (66.2%) with
      sumatriptan 6 mg. Sumatriptan was significantly better than alniditan 1.4 mg for 
      pain free at 2 h. The difference, however, was small and clinically not
      important. For alniditan, a dose-dependent adverse event relationship was seen.
      The safety profile of alniditan 1.4 mg was similar to that of sumatriptan.

TI  - When should triptans be taken during a migraine attack?
PG  - 583-7
AB  - The common strategy to treat a migraine attack as soon as it begins, made for
      classical acute antimigraine treatments such as ergotamine and analgesics, has
      not been transposed to the triptans. The recommendation to delay triptan intake
      until headache intensity is at least moderate is merely a habit generated by the 
      protocol used in triptan trials and a nonvalidated attempt to reduce costs. It is
      also favoured by the few studies suggesting that sumatriptan is less effective
      when given early in an attack, especially during the aura phase. Recent
      retrospective analyses of small numbers of 'protocol violators' in controlled
      trials of sumatriptan suggest that the drug is more efficient when taken while
      the headache is mild. Pain-free responses and therapeutic gains over aspirin
      (acetylsalicylic acid)-metoclopramide or ergotamine-caffeine combinations were
      increased under these conditions. The available circumstantial evidence is
      reviewed and discussed. Before any conclusion can be drawn and recommendation
      made, results are awaited from randomised controlled trials specifically
      addressing whether or not triptans are more efficient in mild headache.
      Meanwhile, there seems to be no medical reason to withhold treatment of a mild
      headache with a triptan as long as triptan intake does not exceed 1 or 2 doses
      per week. Most mild headaches in patients with migraine appear indeed to be mild 
      migraine attacks, even when the headache characteristics are those of
      tension-type headache.

TI  - Pediatric headache.
PG  - 1037-53
AB  - Headaches are frequent in children and adolescents and at times can be extremely 
      disabling. Disability scales, such as the MIDAS scale, have been useful in
      helping follow adult patients. Modifications of this scale have been helpful in
      following pediatric and adolescent patients. Greater attention has been paid to
      epidemiology and classification of headache in children. Studies are being done
      on serotonin 1B/1D agonist for treating acute migraine, and this agent has been
      found to be efficacious despite a high placebo response. It is anticipated that
      FDA approval of sumatriptan nasal spray in adolescents is forthcoming. Despite
      advancements, there is no wonder drug. There continues to be a need for studying 
      preventive therapies in a double-blind, placebo-controlled environment, and plans
      are under way for such studies. Many adult patients with chronic daily headaches 
      report that their headaches began in childhood and adolescence. A better
      understanding of diagnostic criteria, early diagnosis, and more effective
      treatment may be the key to influencing the prevalence of headaches in adults.
      Continued research is the only answer to the questions raised by the most recent 
      studies in this population.

TI  - Establishing a standard of speed for assessing the efficacy of the
      serotonin(1B/1D) agonists (triptans).
PG  - 1056-8
AB  - The current International Headache Society guidelines for migraine clinical
      trials recommend assessment of pain relief at 2 hours as a primary end point.
      Patients, however, express a clear preference for more rapid pain relief, with
      most patients defining rapid relief as occurring within 30 minutes after drug
      administration. Thus, consideration should be given to establishing clinical
      trial end points that more accurately reflect the preferences of patients with
      migraine. In this case, assessment of pain relief at 1 hour would be an
      appropriate primary end point. Using speed of relief as a criterion for migraine 
      drug selection also is appropriate. The migraine-specific serotonin(1B/1D)
      agonists, or triptans, are able to meet this faster relief end point and are
      preferred by patients.

TI  - Patterns of ergotamine and sumatriptan use in the Netherlands from 1991 to 1997.
PG  - 596-603
AB  - The objective of this study was to assess usage patterns of ergotamine and
      sumatriptan over a period of 6 years, primarily to evaluate the impact that
      sumatriptan has had on the prescription of ergotamine. This study used ergotamine
      and sumatriptan prescription data representing inhabitants of eight cities in the
      Netherlands and covering the period of 1991-1997. The yearly incidence of new
      users between 1991 and 1997 was estimated for both drugs as well as for the drug 
      of first choice to be prescribed to patients initiating specific abortive
      migraine treatment with either ergotamine or sumatriptan. Intra-individual
      ergotamine and sumatriptan usage patterns, characterized by single (incidental), 
      continuous (rate of retention) or switch use, were examined for five patient
      cohorts, each for a follow-up period of 1 year. During the year of sumatriptan
      introduction (1991-1992), the overall incidence of new use for both drugs was
      highest (5.4 per 1000 inhabitants). Hereafter, a substantial reduction of more
      than 50% was observed. From 1992 to 1996, the yearly incidence of ergotamine
      first-time use was significantly higher than that of sumatriptan and up to 1996
      ergotamine was more than twice as likely than sumatriptan to be prescribed to
      patients initiating specific abortive treatment. Hereafter, sumatriptan was as
      likely as ergotamine to be prescribed as the drug of first choice, which
      coincided with the full reimbursement of sumatriptan tablets. Overall,
      neurologists were more likely than general practitioners (GPs), to prescribe
      sumatriptan as the drug of first choice. Approximately half of the total study
      population were identified as single-time users. This phenomonen occurred more
      frequently in the ergotamine cohorts. The sumatriptan cohorts displayed a slight 
      yet significant stronger retention rate compared with the ergotamine cohorts. The
      overall impact of sumatriptan on ergotamine use in The Netherlands was marginal, 
      predominantly due to GP's adherence to migraine treatment guidelines and
      reimbursement policies concerning sumatriptan tablets. Overall, incidental use
      was relatively high and may reflect the reported difficulties in diagnosing
      migraine, lack of patient-doctor consultation, or that anticipated benefits of
      the drug were not achieved. Further study is required to clarify these issues.

TI  - Influence of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists on the pharmacokinetics of
      rizatriptan, a 5-HT1B/1D agonist: differential effects of propranolol, nadolol
      and metoprolol.
PG  - 69-76
AB  - AIMS: Patients with migraine may receive the 5-HT1B/1D agonist, rizatriptan (5 or
      10 mg), to control acute attacks. Patients with frequent attacks may also receive
      propranolol or other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists for migraine prophylaxis. The 
      present studies investigated the potential for pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic
      interaction between beta-adrenoceptor blockers and rizatriptan. METHODS: Four
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover investigations were
      performed in a total of 51 healthy subjects. A single 10 mg dose of rizatriptan
      was administered after 7 days' administration of propranolol (60 and 120 mg twice
      daily), nadolol (80 mg twice daily), metoprolol (100 mg twice daily) or placebo. 
      Rizatriptan pharmacokinetics were assessed. In vitro incubations of rizatriptan
      and sumatriptan with various beta-adrenoceptor blockers were performed in human
      S9 fraction. Production of the indole-acetic acid-MAO-A metabolite of each
      triptan was measured. RESULTS: Administration of rizatriptan during propranolol
      treatment (120 mg twice daily for 7.5 days) increased the AUC(0, infinity) for
      rizatriptan by approximately 67% and the Cmax by approximately 75%. A reduction
      in the dose of propranolol (60 mg twice daily) and/or the incorporation of a
      delay (1 or 2 h) between propranolol and rizatriptan administration did not
      produce a statistically significant change in the effect of propranolol on
      rizatriptan pharmacokinetics. Administration of rizatriptan together with nadolol
      (80 mg twice daily) or metoprolol (100 mg twice daily) for 7 days did not
      significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of rizatriptan. No untoward adverse
      experiences attributable to the pharmacokinetic interaction between propranolol
      and rizatriptan were observed, and no subjects developed serious clinical,
      laboratory, or other significant adverse experiences during coadministration of
      rizatriptan with any of the beta-adrenoceptor blockers. In vitro incubations
      showed that propranolol, but not other beta-adrenoceptor blockers significantly
      inhibited the production of the indole-acetic acid metabolite of rizatriptan and 
      sumatriptan. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that propranolol increases plasma
      concentrations of rizatriptan by inhibiting monoamine oxidase-A. When prescribing
      rizatriptan to migraine patients receiving propranolol for prophylaxis, the 5 mg 
      dose of rizatriptan is recommended. Administration with other beta-adrenoceptor
      blockers does not require consideration of a dose adjustment.

TI  - Headache in the emergency department.
PG  - 537-41
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To perform an observational study of the demographics, clinical
      factors, and therapeutic efficacy in patients presenting to the emergency
      department with a chief complaint of headache. BACKGROUND: Acute headache
      presentations to the emergency department are a therapeutic dilemma for
      physicians. METHODS: Patients presenting with nontraumatic headache to the
      emergency department of Hermann Hospital in Houston, Texas, during a 16-month
      period were prospectively ascertained by active and passive surveillance. The
      medical record was abstracted. Demographic and clinical information are presented
      with descriptive statistics. Relative benefit of individual therapies are
      compared with odds ratios (95% confidence intervals). RESULTS: Of the 38 730
      patients who were prospectively screened, 455 presented with a chief complaint of
      headache. Seventy-six percent were women, and the mean age was 37 years.
      Non-Hispanic whites were more likely diagnosed with migraine compared with
      Hispanics or African Americans (P<.001). Three percent had subarachnoid
      hemorrhage. Neurologist follow-up was ordered in 10%. The median time in the
      emergency department was 265 minutes. With the initial treatment, 44% resolved,
      47% improved, and 9% had no change; none worsened. In comparison with all other
      therapies used, there was a trend suggesting the superiority of antiemetics (odds
      ratio, 2.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.81 to 8.61). Acetaminophen was less
      helpful (odds ratio, 0.27; 95% confidence interval, 0.10 to 0.70). When comparing
      specific agents to therapies which could be used at home, antiemetics led to
      headache resolution most often (odds ratio, 3.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.40
      to 7.22); ketorolac showed a similar trend (odds ratio, 2.05; 95% confidence
      interval, 0.86 to 4.89). CONCLUSIONS: Headache in the emergency department is a
      phenomena of young women who spend a long time waiting and receive many tests. A 
      variety of therapies are used. Antiemetics may be especially useful for headache 
      resolution.

TI  - A comparison of visual analog scale and categorical ratings of headache pain in a
      randomized controlled clinical trial with migraine patients.
PG  - 185-90
AB  - A visual analog scale (VAS) method of assessing headache pain was compared with a
      standard categorical four-grade scale (4GS) in a randomized, placebo-controlled, 
      double-blind, clinical trial involving 792 treated migraine outpatients who
      received oral rizatriptan 5 mg, sumatriptan 50 mg, or placebo for a moderate or
      severe headache. The VAS and 4GS were equally useful in demonstrating that the
      active drugs were superior to placebo at reducing headache pain, and in showing
      that the active drugs were similarly effective. For both rizatriptan and
      sumatriptan, slightly larger effect sizes were observed with the 4GS compared
      with the VAS. In analyses using data combined across all treatment groups, VAS
      and 4GS scores were highly correlated. Use of the VAS imposed additional
      administrative burdens. These findings suggest that the 4GS may be the preferred 
      scale for assessing headache pain in clinical trials involving adult migraineurs.

TI  - Meta-analysis of rizatriptan efficacy in randomized controlled clinical trials.
PG  - 129-36
AB  - Data from seven randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase III clinical
      trials were analysed to further evaluate the efficacy of rizatriptan 10 mg (n =
      2068) in comparison with placebo (n = 1260) and rizatriptan 5 mg (n = 1486) for
      the acute treatment of a migraine attack. Migraine was diagnosed according to
      International Headache Society criteria. Headache severity, associated migraine
      symptoms and functional disability were measured immediately before dosing and at
      0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 h. Headache recurrence (return of moderate or severe headache
      after an initial response) was also recorded. In addition to conventional pain
      relief (reduction of moderate or severe headache to mild or none) and pain free
      measures, the analysis looked at the elimination of associated migraine symptoms 
      and disability in patients who had symptoms or disability at baseline.
      Maintenance of pain relief or pain-free status over 24 h was also analysed. At 2 
      h, rizatriptan 10 mg was significantly more effective than placebo for pain
      relief (71% vs. 38%, P < 0.001), and for elimination of pain, nausea,
      photophobia, phonophobia and functional disability. The benefit was maintained
      over 24 h; 37% of patients on rizatriptan 10 mg had sustained pain relief vs. 18%
      for placebo (P < 0.001). Rizatriptan 10 mg was also more effective than
      rizatriptan 5 mg, with a significant superiority at 2 h on all measures except
      for elimination of nausea. The benefit was maintained over 24 h; 38% of patients 
      on rizatriptan 10 mg had sustained pain relief vs. 32% for rizatriptan 5 mg (P = 
      0.001).

TI  - Intravenous metamizol (Dipyrone) in acute migraine treatment and in episodic
      tension-type headache--a placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 90-5
AB  - Acute headache is a very frequent symptom, responsible for significant demand at 
      primary care units and emergency rooms. In such sets in Brazil, metamizol is
      easily found but, on the other hand, neither ergotics nor triptans are available.
      The aim of this study is to compare intravenous metamizol with placebo in the
      acute treatment of migraine with aura, migraine without aura and episodic
      tension-type headache. Fifty-four migraine with aura patients, 95 migraine
      without aura patients and 30 tension-type headache patients were treated with
      metamizol. Ninety patients (30 migraine with aura, 30 migraine without aura and
      30 tension-type headache patients) received placebo. Pain intensity, nausea,
      aura, photo- and phonophobia were investigated at 30 min and 60 min after the
      administration of the drug. Significant improvement of pain after 30 min and 60
      min post-dosage was achieved from metamizol groups compared with placebo groups. 
      Significant improvement of all other symptoms was achieved after 60 min
      post-dosage. Side-effects were mild and with small incidence. Metamizol is an
      effective, safe and low price drug. It may be regarded as a good alternative drug
      for the treatment of common acute primary headaches.

TI  - Effect of MAO-A inhibition on the pharmacokinetics of almotriptan, an
      antimigraine agent in humans.
PG  - 437-41
AB  - AIMS: To assess the effect of a reversible MAO-A inhibitor, moclobemide, on the
      single-dose pharmacokinetics of almotriptan and assess the clinical consequences 
      of any interaction. METHODS: Twelve healthy volunteers received the following
      treatments in a randomized, open-label, two-way crossover design (with a 1 week
      washout between treatments): (A) one 150 mg moclobemide tablet every 12 h for 8
      days and one 12.5 mg almotriptan tablet on the morning of day 8; and (B) one 12.5
      mg almotriptan tablet on day 8. Plasma almotriptan was quantified by
      h.p.l.c.-MS-MS, while urinary concentrations were measured by h.p.l.c.-u.v. Vital
      signs, ECGs, and adverse events were evaluated after almotriptan administration. 
      Treatment effects on pharmacokinetics and vital signs were assessed by analysis
      of variance. RESULTS: Mean almotriptan AUC was higher (483 +/- 99.9 vs 352 +/-
      75.4 ng ml-1 h, P = 0.0001) and oral clearance was lower (26.6 +/- 4.00 vs 36.6
      +/- 5.89 l h-1, P = 0.0001) when almotriptan was administered with moclobemide.
      Mean half-life was longer (4.22 +/- 0.78 vs 3.41 +/- 0.45 h, P = 0.0002) after
      coadministration with moclobemide. Renal clearance of almotriptan was unaffected 
      by moclobemide. No serious adverse events occurred and no clinically significant 
      vital sign changes were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Moclobemide increased plasma
      concentrations of almotriptan on average by 37%, but the combined administration 
      of these two compounds was well tolerated. The degree of interaction was much
      less than that seen previously for sumatriptan or zolmitriptan given with
      moclobemide.

TI  - Oral almotriptan vs. oral sumatriptan in the abortive treatment of migraine: a
      double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, optimum-dose comparison.
PG  - 944-50
AB  - BACKGROUND: Almotriptan malate is a novel, selective serotonin(1B/D) agonist, or 
      triptan, developed for the abortive treatment of migraine. In double-blind,
      placebo-controlled studies, it has been shown to be effective, well tolerated,
      and safe. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of
      almotriptan with that of the "standard triptan," sumatriptan succinate. The power
      calculation of the study was based on 24-hour headache recurrence, an efficacy
      measure in the abortive treatment of migraine, and on the occurrence of adverse
      events. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Subjects, aged between18 and 65 years, with
      migraine with or without aura but otherwise healthy, were randomized to take
      orally either almotriptan malate, 12.5 mg, or sumatriptan succinate, 50 mg. The
      medications were provided in identical-looking capsules to ensure blinding and
      were taken for the treatment of moderate or severe headache. Efficacy was
      determined in terms of (1) headache relief-a decrease in pain intensity to mild
      or no pain; (2) headache freedom-a decrease to no pain; (3) use of rescue
      medications, allowed after 2 hours; and (4) headache recurrence-moderate or
      severe pain returning within 24 hours after headache relief at 2 hours. Adverse
      events were collected for 96 hours after treatment and for safety evaluation,
      vital signs, blood tests, and electrocardiograms were performed at the screening 
      and exit visits. RESULTS: Seventy-five investigators enrolled 1255 subjects of
      whom 1173 were treated (591 with almotriptan and 582 with sumatriptan). At 2
      hours, almotriptan treatment provided headache relief in 58.0% of the subjects
      and sumatriptan treatment in 57.3%; headache freedom was provided by the
      medications in 17.9% and 24.6%, respectively (P =.005). Rescue medications were
      taken by 36.7% of the subjects in the almotriptan-treated group and by 33.2% in
      the sumatriptan-treated group; headaches returned to moderate or severe intensity
      in 27.4% and 24.0%, respectively. Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in
      15.2% of the subjects in the almotriptan-treated group and in 19.4% in the
      sumatriptan-treated group (P =.06); treatment-related adverse events occurred in 
      9.1% and 15.5% of the subjects, respectively (P =.001), including chest pain,
      which occurred in 0.3% and 2.2%, respectively (P =.004). CONCLUSIONS: Almotriptan
      and sumatriptan are similarly effective in the abortive treatment of moderate or 
      severe migraine headache; they are also similarly well tolerated and safe.

TI  - Neuroendocrine effects of subcutaneous sumatriptan in patients with migraine.
PG  - 310-4
AB  - We evaluated the sensitivity of 5-HT1D receptors in patients with migraine using 
      sumatriptan as a pharmacological probe. The drug inhibits the release of ACTH,
      cortisol and prolactin and this effect may be used to explore the function of
      serotoninergic systems in vivo. We administered sumatriptan (6 mg sc) and placebo
      to 15 migraineurs, during the headache-free period, and to 10 healthy controls.
      Blood samples were collected -15, 0, 15, 30, 45, 60 and 90 min after injections. 
      Sumatriptan induced a significant (p<0.01) decrease of ACTH, cortisol and
      prolactin concentrations both in patients with migraine and in controls. The
      neuroendocrine response was not significantly different in the two groups. Our
      results suggest that 5-HT1D receptor sensitivity is not altered in migraine.

TI  - Prostaglandin analog mechanisms are not effective in refractory chronic cluster
      headache.
PG  - 618-20
AB  - Prostaglandin E analogs have been shown to be effective in the treatment of
      refractory trigeminal neuralgia in patients with multiple sclerosis.
      Prostaglandin E inhibits the functions of T lymphocytes which are involved in the
      pathophysiology of cluster headache. Therefore, a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, crossover study on the efficacy of misoprostol in chronic
      refractory cluster headache was performed. Eight patients were treated with 600
      micrograms misoprostol and with placebo for a 2-week period. No differences in
      attack frequency, intensity, global impression, and side effects could be
      detected, suggesting that prostaglandin E analogs are not effective in the
      treatment of chronic cluster headache.

TI  - Dihydroergotamine nasal spray in the treatment of acute migraine.
PG  - 614-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of dihydroergotamine (DHE) nasal
      spray in patients suffering from common or classical migraine. METHODS: In a
      double-blind parallel-group study, 52 outpatients with migraine were randomly
      allocated to DHE nasal spray or to placebo. Two puffs, one in each nostril, was
      taken as an initial dose (resulting in either 0.5 or 1 mg of DHE), followed by
      another puff (0.5 mg) after 30 and 60 minutes, if necessary, achieving a maximum 
      dose of 2 mg for patients of the DHE 1-mg group or of 1.5 mg for patients of the 
      0.5-mg group. Four consecutive attacks were thus treated. The efficacy analysis
      was done for observed cases. The main outcome measure was reduction of the
      severity of the attacks. RESULTS: No differences were observed in the migraine
      characteristics or the number of treatments of the patients from the different
      groups. Dihydroergotamine 1 mg tended to provide better relief than 0.5 mg,
      although the effect was not statistically significant. Patients taking DHE used
      less rescue medications, with a dose-dependent effect. Side effects were reported
      by four patients receiving DHE but not placebo. The tolerability of the drug was 
      assessed as good by 94% of the patients. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that 
      DHE nasal spray is well tolerated and has dose-dependent efficacy in migraine.

TI  - Comparison of preference for rizatriptan 10-mg wafer versus sumatriptan 50-mg
      tablet in migraine.
PG  - 275-83
AB  - Rizatriptan (MAXALT, a registered trademark of Merck & Co. Inc.) is a selective
      5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonist with rapid oral absorption and early onset of action
      in the acute treatment of migraine. This randomized, open-label, crossover
      outpatient study assessed the preference of 481 patients for rizatriptan 10-mg
      rapidly disintegrating tablets versus sumatriptan (IMIGRAN, a registered
      trademark of GlaxoWellcome PLC) 50-mg tablets in the treatment of a single
      migraine attack with each therapy. Almost twice as many patients preferred
      rizatriptan 10-mg rapidly disintegrating tablet to sumatriptan 50-mg tablet (64.3
      vs. 35.7%, p < or = 0.001). Faster relief of headache pain was the most important
      reason for the preference, cited by 46.9% of patients preferring rizatriptan and 
      43.4% of patients who preferred sumatriptan. Headache relief at 2 h was 75.9%
      with rizatriptan and 66.6% with sumatriptan (p < or = 0.001), with rizatriptan
      being superior to sumatriptan within 30 min of dosing. Fifty-five percent of
      patients were pain free 2 h after rizatriptan, compared with 42.1% treated with
      sumatriptan (p < or = 0.001), rizatriptan being superior within 1 h of treatment.
      Forty-one percent of patients taking rizatriptan were pain free at 2 h and had no
      recurrence or need for additional medication, compared to 32.3% of patients on
      sumatriptan. Rizatriptan was also superior to sumatriptan in terms of the
      proportions of patients with no nausea, phonophobia or photophobia, and patients 
      with normal function 2 h after treatment intake (p < 0.05). More patients were
      (completely, very or somewhat) satisfied 2 h after treatment with rizatriptan
      (73.3%) than 2 h after treatment with sumatriptan (59.0%) (p < or = 0.001).
      Additionally, 2 h after the dose, more patients found rizatriptan to be very
      convenient, convenient or somewhat convenient (87.2%) than they did sumatriptan
      (76.3%) (p < or = 0.001). Both active treatments were well tolerated. The most
      common side effects with rizatriptan and sumatriptan were nausea (6.6 and 6.9% of
      patients, respectively), dizziness (6.1 and 5.8%) and somnolence (7.4 and 6.7%).

TI  - Tolerability and efficacy of almotriptan in the long-term treatment of migraine.
PG  - 206-13
AB  - BACKGROUND: Almotriptan is a highly specific 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonist, which 
      acts selectively on blood vessels of the brain. Short-term studies have
      demonstrated that almotriptan provides rapid, effective and reliable relief of
      migraine attacks, while offering excellent tolerability. Purpose: To assess the
      long-term tolerability and efficacy of oral almotriptan 12.5 mg administered for 
      every migraine attack over a 1-year period. METHODS: A total of 762 patients
      treated 13,751 attacks (1-97 per patient); 61.5% of attacks were treated with one
      12.5-mg dose, while for 38.5% of attacks, patients took a second dose within 24
      h. RESULTS: Three hundred and ninety-one patients (51.3%) experienced a total of 
      1,617 adverse events (AEs). The majority (88.6%) of AEs were of mild-to-moderate 
      intensity, and only 28.8% of AEs were considered to be related to the study drug.
      Only 2 patients experienced serious AEs possibly related to almotriptan, syncope 
      and chest pain; both recovered without any sequelae. Patients reported at least 1
      AE in 11% of attacks treated. The incidence of AEs decreased during the study.
      Only 6 (0.8%) study withdrawals were due to AEs considered to be related to
      almotriptan. Tolerability was not compromised in patients taking 2 doses of
      almotriptan or in those using migraine prophylactics. Patient age or sex did not 
      influence the incidence of AEs. There was no evidence of tachyphylaxis in those
      patients completing the study. Pain relief at 2 h after the initial dose was
      achieved in 84.2% of moderate/severe attacks. Patients were pain free at 2 h
      after dose in 58.2% of all attacks. Older patients (> 40 years) tended to respond
      better than younger ones (< 40 years). Efficacy was not modified by use of
      migraine prophylactics or hormonal contraceptives. Efficacy measurements were
      consistent on treating repeated moderate/severe migraine attacks. CONCLUSION:
      This large, open study indicates that the new, specific 5-HT(1B/1D) agonist
      almotriptan, at a dose of 12.5 mg, is a well tolerated and effective treatment
      for migraine pain when used over a period of up to 1 year.

TI  - Treatment of migraine in Canada with naratriptan: a cost-effectiveness analysis.
PG  - 456-64
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of naratriptan for the treatment of
      migraine in Canada. BACKGROUND: The substantial disability brought on by
      migraine, coupled with the high prevalence of this disorder, leads to substantial
      costs. Naratriptan is a newly developed triptan shown to be effective in the
      treatment of migraine. METHODS: Monte Carlo modeling techniques were used to
      simulate the experience of Canadian migraineurs over the course of 1 year. Data
      from a multinational study comparing oral naratriptan 2.5 mg to customary
      therapies were used in the cost-effectiveness analysis. RESULTS: Naratriptan
      leads to an annual reduction in symptom duration of 225 hours compared to
      customary therapy not including other triptans. Reductions in lost productivity
      yield savings of Can $390 (1998 Canadian dollars) relative to customary therapy, 
      which exceed the increase in drug costs resulting in overall savings of Can $109 
      per year. CONCLUSIONS: The use of naratriptan in the treatment of migraine is an 
      economically attractive option, leading to savings in overall costs. Increases in
      drug costs seem acceptable in light of reductions in symptom duration.

TI  - Oral almotriptan in the treatment of migraine: safety and tolerability.
PG  - 449-55
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To summarize safety and tolerability data on orally administered
      almotriptan from premarketing clinical trials. BACKGROUND: Almotriptan is a new
      5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist similar to sumatriptan in mode of action and
      therapeutic efficacy. In addition, the safety and tolerability profile of
      almotriptan has been demonstrated in a number of controlled clinical trials.
      Sumatriptan is generally safe and well tolerated; however, in controlled clinical
      trials, it has been associated with chest symptoms (pressure, warmth, and other
      unpleasant sensations) with an incidence of 3% to 5%. DESIGN: Three phase 1
      dose-finding and pharmacokinetic studies in healthy men and women volunteers were
      reviewed to assess the safety and tolerability of oral almotriptan at single
      doses ranging from 2 to 200 mg. The objective of one study was to evaluate
      cardiovascular safety. Two phase 2 trials assessed the safety and tolerability of
      single doses of 2 to 150 mg in migraine (n=911). Two phase 3 trials assessed the 
      safety and tolerability of a single 12.5-mg oral dose after three attacks (n=910)
      and repeated doses of 12.5 mg for multiple attacks over the long term (n=747).
      All studies were conducted in Europe. Data from the United States is currently
      being analyzed and will be published at a later date. RESULTS: In phase 2 and 3
      trials comprising more than 2500 patients with migraine and 15 000 attacks,
      adverse events were infrequent and mild. The most common events-dizziness, nausea
      and vomiting, headache, fatigue, paresthesia, and drowsiness-were reported in
      fewer than 3% of patients. At the recommended therapeutic dose of 12.5 mg, the
      adverse events profile was not statistically different from placebo. The
      incidence of chest symptoms was 0.2% in the phase 3 trials. The long-term safety 
      and tolerability profile after treatment of more than 10 000 attacks was similar 
      to that following the single-dose studies. In all clinical trials, almotriptan
      demonstrated a very favorable adverse event profile, particularly with respect to
      nonischemic-related chest symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Almotriptan was safe and well
      tolerated in nearly all adult patients with migraine, with and without aura,
      enrolled in these studies. The incidence of chest symptoms in preclinical studies
      was substantially lower than that reported for sumatriptan in premarketing
      studies, indicating that almotriptan may be better tolerated than sumatriptan at 
      clinically anticipated doses. However, any potential difference in cardiovascular
      safety between almotriptan and sumatriptan cannot be determined or inferred from 
      this data. Cardiovascular risk profiles for all drugs within this class
      (triptans) should be considered similar. Only extensive postmarketing data, not
      currently available, can potentially change this recommendation.

TI  - New generation anti-epileptics for facial pain and headache.
PG  - 42-6
AB  - The prophylactic management of recurrent head and facial pains may be challenging
      because of lack of efficacy and/or bothersome adverse effects of available drug
      therapies. New generation antiepileptic drugs offer new perspectives in difficult
      cases. We will review the available published data and present our experience
      with lamotrigine in various head and facial pains such as migraine, cluster
      headache, neuropathic trigeminal pain, atypical facial pain, and chronic
      tension-type headache. Twenty-five patients were enrolled and followed for 18
      months. The dose was gradually increased in steps of 25 mg up to the effective
      dose (mean 250 mg/d). Lamotrigine was most effective in trigeminal neuralgia and 
      dysesthesia, but was of little utility in the other head or facial pains.

PG  - 341-5
AB  - The mild vasoconstrictor effects of modern antimigraine drugs, such as serotonin 
      (5-HT; 5-hydroxytryptamine)1B/D agonists, have led to a search for
      nonvasoconstrictor approaches to therapy. Such approaches have included substance
      P (neurokinin I) antagonists, endothelin antagonists and highly specific 5HT1D
      agonists. All of these substances are effective in animal models and have no
      significant vasoconstrictive effects. However, all of them failed to demonstrate 
      any antimigraine effects. Current clinical and experimental evidence therefore
      supports the view that isolated peripheral trigeminal nerve inhibition is
      insufficient to relieve acute migraine.

TI  - Headache and female hormones: what you need to know.
PG  - 323-33
AB  - The normal female lifecycle is associated with hormonal milestones, including
      menarche, pregnancy, contraceptive use, menopause, and the use of replacement sex
      hormones. Attacks of migraine without aura, but not with aura, are more likely to
      occur 2 days before onset and on the first 2 days of menses, but they are not
      more severe than those that occur outside the perimenstrual period. Oral
      sumatriptan and naratriptan are effective as short-term perimenstrual
      prophylaxis. Postdural headache can occur during the postpartum period. The
      International Headache Society Task Force assessed the efficacy of treatment of
      women who had migraine with combined oral contraceptives and hormone replacement 
      therapy, as well as the risk of ischemic stroke associated with their use. There 
      is no contraindication to the use of oral contraceptives in women with migraine
      in the absence of migraine aura or other risk factors. There is a potentially
      increased risk of ischemic stroke in women with migraine who are using combined
      oral contraceptives and have additional risk factors that cannot easily be
      controlled, including migraine with aura. There is no compelling evidence that
      postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy either decreases or increases stroke
      risk.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the triptan antimigraine agents: a
      comparative review.
PG  - 189-205
AB  - The current approach to antimigraine therapy comprises potent serotonin 5-HT1B/1D
      receptor agonists collectively termed triptans. Sumatriptan was the first of
      these compounds to be developed, and offered improved efficacy and tolerability
      over ergot-derived compounds. The development of sumatriptan was quickly followed
      by a number of 'second generation' triptan compounds, characterised by improved
      pharmacokinetic properties and/or tolerability profiles. Triptans are believed to
      effect migraine relief by binding to serotonin (5-hydroxy-tryptamine) receptors
      in the brain, where they act to induce vasoconstriction of extracerebral blood
      vessels and also reduce neurogenic inflammation. Although the pharmacological
      mechanism of the triptans is similar, their pharmacokinetic properties are
      distinct. For example, bioavailability of oral formulations ranges between 14%
      (sumatriptan) and 74% (naratriptan), and their elimination half-life ranges from 
      2 hours (sumatriptan and rizatriptan) to 25 hours (frovatriptan). Clearly, such
      diverse pharmacokinetic properties will influence the effectiveness of the
      compounds and favour the prescription of one over another in different patient
      populations. This article reviews the pharmacological properties of the triptans 
      (time to peak plasma concentration, half-life, bioavailability and receptor
      binding) and relates these properties to efficacy and time of onset. It also
      considers the effects of concomitant medication, food, age and disease on the
      pharmacokinetics of the compounds. In addition, the relative merits, such as
      headache recurrence, tolerability and route of administration, are discussed.
      Finally, the performance of the triptans is considered in the context of direct
      head-to-head comparative trials that have assessed the efficacy profile of the
      compounds.

TI  - Comparative study of a combination of isometheptene mucate, dichloralphenazone
      with acetaminophen and sumatriptan succinate in the treatment of migraine.
PG  - 391-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the safety and efficacy of isometheptene mucate,
      dichloralphenazone with acetaminophen to sumatriptan succinate for the treatment 
      of mild-to-moderate migraine, with or without aura, when taken at the first sign 
      of an attack. BACKGROUND: The Food and Drug Administration approved sumatriptan
      succinate and the combination of isometheptene mucate, dichloralphenazone with
      acetaminophen for the treatment of migraine. As part of the stratified treatment 
      of migraine, those patients whose headaches are mild or moderate may benefit from
      nontriptan medications. Additionally, early treatment of acute migraine before
      the headache has become moderate or severe may improve response to treatment.
      METHODS: This was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study
      to assess the safety and efficacy of the combination of isometheptene mucate,
      dichloralphenazone with acetaminophen and sumatriptan succinate in the early
      stages of a single migraine attack. Patients diagnosed with migraine, with or
      without aura, as defined by the International Headache Society diagnostic
      criteria were enrolled. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-seven patients were enrolled 
      in the study. Data for efficacy were available for 126 patients; safety data were
      available for 128 patients. No statistically significant difference between the
      two active agents in the patient's response to treatment was demonstrated.
      Headache recurrence was not significantly different over the 24-hour evaluation
      period for those patients responding in the first 4 hours. In those with headache
      recurrence, it was statistically significantly more severe in those patients
      treated with sumatriptan succinate. Improvement in functional disability was, in 
      general, better among those treated with isometheptene mucate, dichloralphenazone
      with acetaminophen. Global analysis of efficacy was similar in the two active
      groups. Patients treated with sumatriptan succinate were somewhat more likely to 
      have adverse effects than the isometheptene mucate, dichloralphenazone with
      acetaminophen group. CONCLUSIONS: Both isometheptene mucate, dichloralphenazone
      with acetaminophen and sumatriptan succinate are safe and effective when used
      early in the treatment of an acute migraine. Several parameters suggest that
      isometheptene mucate, dichloralphenazone with acetaminophen may have a slight
      advantage compared with sumatriptan succinate in the early treatment of
      mild-to-moderate migraine.

      open-label study.
PG  - 377-84
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine measures of cognitive function during acute migraine,
      before and after treatment with sumatriptan nasal spray, 20 mg. BACKGROUND:
      Migraineurs frequently report symptoms of cognitive impairment during migraine.
      The efficacy of sumatriptan for treatment of migraine-related cognitive
      impairment is undocumented. METHODS: This open-label, single-attack study of 28
      subjects used the Headache Care Center-Automated Neuropsychological Assessment
      Metrics, a computerized neuropsychological assessment battery, to measure
      cognitive function under three patient conditions: migraine-free, untreated
      migraine, and following sumatriptan (primary outcome). Headache response and
      pain-free response, percent effectiveness, and clinical disability were measured.
      RESULTS: Cognitive function (simple reaction time, sustained
      attention/concentration, working memory, visual-spatial processing) and
      alertness/fatigue were adversely affected during migraine compared with
      migraine-free performance (P<.05), and rapidly restored following sumatriptan
      nasal spray, 20 mg (P<.05). Headache and pain-free response were 86% and 68%,
      respectively, at 135 minutes postdose. Changes in migraine pain severity,
      clinical disability, and percent effectiveness following treatment with
      sumatriptan nasal spray, 20 mg, were significantly correlated with cognitive
      function measures across all subtests (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Sumatriptan nasal
      spray, 20 mg, restored migraine-related cognitive function and clinical
      disability.

TI  - Sumatriptan, 5-HT(1D) receptors and obsessive-compulsive disorder.
PG  - 169-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: After considering the effects of 5-HT receptor agonists with
      different binding profiles on the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder
      (OCD), Zohar and Kindler hypothesized that the 5-HT(1D) receptor was implicated
      in this disorder's pathophysiology. METHODS: We explored the 5-HT(1D) hypothesis 
      in a 5-day, random, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of oral sumatriptan
      100 mg/day in medication-free adults with OCD. We hypothesized that sumatriptan, 
      a 5-HT(1D) agonist, would diminish 5-HT release, thereby worsening OCD symptoms. 
      We further hypothesized that by beginning to desensitize 5-HT(1D) receptors,
      sumatriptan pretreatment would promote a faster response or an increased
      likelihood of response to subsequent treatment with a selective serotonin
      reuptake inhibitor. RESULTS: The five sumatriptan subjects' OCD symptom
      worsening, as measured by the Yale-Brown scale ( upward arrow 17.6% (S.D. 14.6)),
      was significant when compared to the slight symptom decrease in the five placebo 
      subjects ( downward arrow 5.2% (S.D. 4.9), P<0.015). The sumatriptan group did
      not exhibit a faster response or greater likelihood of response to a 90-day, open
      label trial of paroxetine. CONCLUSIONS: Longer term studies of the effects of
      5-HT(1D) agonists on OCD symptoms are indicated. Zolmitriptan, a potent 5-HT(1D) 
      receptor agonist with better penetration of the blood-brain barrier, may be a
      preferred challenge agent.

      a working population. The advent of new therapies has stimulated interest in this
      area, and evidence is now available that documents the substantial impact of
      migraine on workplace productivity and the likelihood of untreated migraine
      leading to unemployment or underemployment for the patient. This paper reviews
      current findings of both observational and interventional studies about the
      impact of migraine on productivity and employment. When considered in the light
      of migraine demographics, the high prevalence of migraine, and its low
      consultation and treatment rates, this evidence indicates that improved screening
      and treatment for this common condition could have a substantial impact on worker
      productivity and on patient well-being.

TI  - Lack of pharmacokinetic interaction between the antimigraine compound,
      almotriptan, and propranolol in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 61-5
AB  - This study was designed to assess the pharmacokinetics of almotriptan, a
      5-HT1B/1D agonist, when administered in the presence and absence of propranolol. 
      Healthy male (n = 10) and female (n = 2) volunteers received (i) 80 mg
      propranolol twice daily for 7 days and 12.5 mg almotriptan on day 7, and (ii)
      12.5 mg almotriptan on day 7, according to a two-way crossover design. Plasma and
      urinary almotriptan concentrations were measured by high performance liquid
      chromatography (HPLC) methods. Treatment effects on pharmacokinetic parameters
      were assessed by analysis of variance (ANOVA). Statistically significant
      differences between treatments in area under the curve (AUC), clearance, and
      half-life were observed (P < 0.03), but these differences were < 7%. Ninety
      percent confidence interval analysis of log-transformed pharmacokinetic
      parameters showed that the treatments were equivalent. Adverse events were mild
      to moderate in intensity, and no treatment effects on vital signs were observed. 
      The results show that propranolol has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of
      almotriptan. Concomitant administration of the two drugs is well tolerated.

TI  - Sumatriptan: economic evidence for its use in the treatment of migraine, the
      Canadian comparative economic analysis.
PG  - 12-9
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate economic and health effects of
      sumatriptan relative to customary therapy in Canada. The relationship between
      treatment and functionality was established based on analysis of existing data
      from a multinational study. A Monte Carlo model was developed to simulate 1 year 
      for each of customary therapy and six sumatriptan formulations. Costs are
      expressed in 1998 Canadian dollars. Sumatriptan is expected to reduce the time
      spent with migraine symptoms and resulting time lost. Under customary therapy,
      the annual cost of lost time is estimated at pound908 ($1973). With sumatriptan, 
      these costs ranged from pound406 ($882) with subcutaneous sumatriptan to pound577
      ($1254) with nasal sumatriptan 10 mg, saving pound331-502 ($719-1091) in the
      annual cost of time lost. All these benefits are expected to be obtained at an
      additional drug cost ranging from pound869 ($1889) for subcutaneous sumatriptan
      to pound278 ($605) for sumatriptan suppository. The cost of sumatriptan treatment
      is significantly offset by a substantial reduction of costs associated with time 
      lost due to migraine symptoms.

TI  - Efficacy, tolerability, and patient satisfaction with 50- and 100-mg sumatriptan 
      tablets in those initially dissatisfied with the efficacy of 50-mg sumatriptan
      tablets.
PG  - 260-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Both 50- and 100-mg sumatriptan tablets are effective and well
      tolerated in the acute treatment of migraine. However, given a choice between the
      2 doses, many patients in clinical practice and clinical studies prefer the
      100-mg dose. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to assess whether patients
      initially dissatisfied with the efficacy of 50-mg sumatriptan tablets would be
      satisfied with 100-mg sumatriptan tablets. METHODS: In phase 1 of the study,
      triptan-naive patients with migraine (International Headache Society diagnosis)
      received open-label treatment of 3 migraine attacks with 50-mg sumatriptan
      tablets. At the end of phase 1, those who were dissatisfied with the efficacy but
      satisfied with the tolerability of 50-mg sumatriptan tablets entered phase 2 and 
      were randomized in a double-blind, parallel-group fashion to receive either 50-
      or 100-mg sumatriptan tablets for the treatment of 3 attacks. Patients who were
      satisfied with the efficacy or dissatisfied with the tolerability of the 50-mg
      tablets in phase 1 were given the option of continuing open-label treatment with 
      50-mg sumatriptan tablets in phase 2. The primary end point was the percentage of
      patients satisfied with medication at the end of phase 2 double-blind treatment. 
      Patient satisfaction with specific medication attributes was assessed using the
      Patient Perception of Migraine Questionnaire. RESULTS: Seven hundred twenty-two
      patients were enrolled in phase 1 of the study (the intent-to-treat population), 
      609 of whom had evaluable satisfaction data at the end of open-label treatment.
      Three hundred twenty-six (54%) of these patients were satisfied with 50-mg
      sumatriptan tablets, whereas 283 (46%) were not satisfied. Among those who were
      dissatisfied, lack of efficacy was cited as the sole reason for dissatisfaction
      by 242 (86%). Two hundred thirty-one of those who were dissatisfied with efficacy
      only and wished to continue the study were randomized to double-blind treatment
      with either 50-mg sumatriptan tablets (n = 123; 82% female, 18% male; mean age,
      37.6 years) or 100-mg sumatriptan tablets (n = 108; 86% female, 14% male; mean
      age, 36.0 years). The remaining 310 patients elected to continue open-label
      treatment with 50-mg sumatriptan tablets. At the end of double-blind treatment,
      64 of 101 patients (63%) in the 100-mg group indicated that they were satisfied
      with treatment, compared with 55 of 113 (49%) in the 50-mg group (P = 0.031).
      Across the 3 attacks treated in the double-blind phase. headache relief 2 hours
      postdose was reported by 47% to 53% of patients in the 50-mg group and 45% to 60%
      of patients in the 100-mg group. The overall incidence of patients reporting > or
      =1 adverse event was 19% (23/123) in the 50-mg group and 22% (24/108) in the
      100-mg group. CONCLUSIONS: For most patients, 50 mg is the appropriate starting
      dose of sumatriptan tablets. In patients who experience inadequate relief with 50
      mg, increasing the dose to 100 mg is an appropriate therapeutic option.

TI  - Effect of encapsulation on absorption of sumatriptan tablets: data from healthy
      volunteers and patients during a migraine.
PG  - 242-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: Some comparative trials of selective serotonin 1B/ID-agonists in
      migraine have reported -15% lower efficacy for sumatriptan tablets than that
      reported in placebo-controlled trials. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to test
      the hypothesis that the encapsulation methods used to mask active drug may delay 
      absorption of sumatriptan from dosing to 2 hours after dosing (the traditional
      end point in clinical trials of migraine treatment), an effect that may be
      enhanced by migraine-associated gastric stasis. METHODS: Two randomized,
      open-label, 2-way crossover trials were conducted to evaluate the absorption and 
      bioequivalence of conventional 50-mg sumatriptan tablets and encapsulated 50-mg
      sumatriptan tablets in supine, fasted, healthy volunteers (Glaxo Wellcome
      protocol SUM40270) and supine patients experiencing a migraine (Glaxo Wellcome
      protocol SUM40268). Absorption was assessed by calculating the area under the
      plasma concentration-time curve from dosing to 2 hours after dosing (AUC2) and
      the times to first measurable plasma concentration, 10 ng/mL, 20 ng/mL, and
      maximum plasma concentration. Data for the AUC from time zero to infinity and
      maximum plasma concentration were used to assess standard bioequivalence, which
      is considered to occur when the 90% CIs for the geometric mean treatment ratios
      (test/reference) fall between 0.8 and 1.25. RESULTS: Study 1 included 26 healthy 
      subjects (73% men, 27% women; mean age, 39.1 years), and study 2 included 30
      patients with migraine (67% women, 33% men; mean age, 42.7 years). Sumatriptan
      absorption was delayed with the encapsulated tablet compared with the
      conventional tablet 0 to 2 hours after dosing, particularly during a migraine.
      AUC2 values with encapsulated sumatriptan compared with the conventional tablet
      were 21% lower in healthy volunteers (ratio of capsule/tablet, 0.79; 90% CI,
      0.588-1.050) and 27% lower in patients experiencing a migraine (ratio of
      capsule/tablet, 0.73; 90% CI, 0.519-1.023). Standard bioequivalence was
      demonstrated in both healthy volunteers and patients experiencing a migraine.
      CONCLUSIONS: Encapsulation delayed absorption of sumatriptan 0 to 2 hours after
      dosing, particularly during a migraine. This delay in absorption of the
      encapsulated form may account for the lower efficacy of sumatriptan in some
      comparative studies.

TI  - Preventive therapy in pediatric migraine.
PG  - 71-8
AB  - Preventive therapy for migraine headache includes identification of migraine
      precipitants, possible adjustments in lifestyle, appropriate management of acute 
      headache, and, when necessary, the use of pharmacologic agents. There are no
      well-controlled clinical trials with sufficient patient numbers to support the
      use of any agent in the prevention of migraine headache in children. Data on the 
      use of amitriptyline and divalproex sodium in open-label studies suggest that
      these agents may be efficacious. The mechanism of action for these agents is
      unknown but may be related to the 5-hydroxytyptamine-2 (5-HT2) receptor
      antagonism or regulation of ion channels. A review of the pertinent literature on
      migraine prophylaxis in children is presented. Dosing guidelines are presented
      based on the limited data available and clinical experience.

AB  - All papers on cluster headaches were reviewed according to preset criteria under 
      the following headings: classification, epidemiology, aetiology, pathophysiology,
      and clinical features. The management review used the Cochrane systematic review 
      guidelines and so is based on randomized controlled trials wherever possible. A
      meta-analysis was not done. Other treatments are discussed and their drawbacks
      are highlighted and guidelines proposed based on the evidence of this review.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of sumatriptan in the treatment of multiple migraine
      attacks.
PG  - 272-8
AB  - This cross-over, double blind, randomized, multicentre study evaluated the
      consistency of efficacy and safety of oral sumatriptan in 233 migraneurs. The
      patients received 50 mg oral sumatriptan or placebo for the treatment of 12
      migraine attacks. Within each group of 4 attacks, three were treated with
      sumatriptan and one with placebo, according to a randomization list. Over all the
      attacks, the efficacy rate was statistically significant for sumatriptan against 
      placebo at 2 or 4 hours (2 hours: sumatriptan 60%, PLO 38%, p < 0.001; 4 hours
      sumatriptan 79%, PLO 47%, p < 0.001). Oral sumatriptan was similarly effective at
      relieving the associated symptoms and at reducing clinical disability in most
      attacks. The incidence of adverse events did not differ between treatment groups.
      All the events recorded were mild to moderate as intensity and resolved
      spontaneously.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of rizatriptan versus standard care during long-term
      treatment for migraine. Rizatriptan Multicenter Study Groups.
PG  - 764-71
AB  - Rizatriptan is a novel, selective 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist with a rapid onset
      of action after oral dosing for the acute treatment of migraine. We conducted a
      long-term (up to 1 year), multicenter, randomized study in 1831 patients treating
      more than 46,000 attacks to compare the efficacy and tolerability of rizatriptan 
      5 mg and 10 mg to standard care medications routinely used for the acute
      treatment of migraine attacks. Both doses of rizatriptan were highly effective,
      without evidence of tachyphylaxis. Rizatriptan 10 mg was consistently superior (P
      < 0.05), both to the 5-mg dose and to standard care, in providing relief in 90%
      of attacks, with 50% pain-free by 2 hours after dosing. The most common
      dose-related adverse events were nausea, somnolence, and asthenia/fatigue. Based 
      on this large, multicenter, long-term trial, rizatriptan is an important new oral
      agent for the acute treatment of migraine.

PG  - 737-47
AB  - Rizatriptan is a selective 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist with rapid oral absorption 
      and early onset of action in the acute treatment of migraine. This double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled, crossover study compared rizatriptan 5 mg versus sumatriptan 
      25 mg, and rizatriptan 10 mg versus sumatriptan 50 mg. A total of 1329 patients
      were allocated to one of five groups for treatment of two attacks: rizatriptan 5 
      mg/sumatriptan 25 mg; sumatriptan 25 mg/rizatriptan 5 mg; rizatriptan 10
      mg/sumatriptan 50 mg; sumatriptan 50 mg/rizatriptan 10 mg; placebo/placebo. For
      each attack, patients rated headache severity, presence of associated symptoms,
      and functional disability prior to dosing and at intervals through 4 hours
      thereafter. Patients also rated their satisfaction with medication. Rizatriptan 5
      mg and 10 mg provided faster relief of headache pain and greater relief of
      migraine symptoms than the 25-mg and 50-mg doses of sumatriptan, respectively.
      The response to rizatriptan was better than sumatriptan on additional measures
      including functional disability and satisfaction with medication. All active
      treatments were highly effective compared to placebo and acted as early as 30
      minutes after dosing. All active treatments were well-tolerated and showed
      comparable safety profiles.

TI  - The multinational impact of migraine symptoms on healthcare utilisation and work 
      loss.
PG  - 197-206
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare self-reported healthcare resource utilisation, paid work
      loss, unpaid work loss and loss of effectiveness at work due to migraine in a
      clinic-based adult migraine population. METHODS: The Migraine Background
      Questionnaire (MBQ) was translated and pilot-tested for use in 25 countries. The 
      questionnaire was then self-administered by patients at a screening visit for 3
      phase III clinical trials of rizatriptan [a selective serotonin
      (5-hydroxytryptamine) 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist] in 23 US and 78 non-US sites.
      PARTICIPANTS: Persons 18 to 65 years of age with at least a 6-month history of
      moderate to severe migraines prior to the screening visit were surveyed. RESULTS:
      A total of 2670 persons (54.7% Europe, 16.5% Latin America, 23.1% North America, 
      5.5% other countries) completed the MBQ and had responses which could be
      analysed. On average, each patient reported 2.78 doctor visits, 0.53 emergency
      room visits and 0.06 hospitalisations related to migraine per year. Patients
      self-reported being only 46% effective while on the job with migraine symptoms.
      Extrapolation of patient self-reported work and productivity loss for the last 4 
      weeks to an annual basis suggested that clinic-based patients with migraine lose 
      19.5 workday equivalents (8.3 days due to absenteeism, 11.2 days due to reduced
      workday equivalents) due to migraine per year. In the US, the annual employer
      cost of this total migraine-related work loss is estimated to be $US3309 (2000
      values) per patient with migraine. The levels of self-reported healthcare
      resources utilised for migraine and work loss were generally consistent across
      geographic regions. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of migraine symptoms on healthcare
      resource utilisation and work loss was similar across most measures in Europe,
      Latin America, North America and other countries. Total migraine-related work
      loss due to absenteeism and reduced workday equivalents accounts for most of the 
      economic burden of migraine, regardless of country, in a clinic-based migraine
      population.

TI  - Headache and cardiovascular risk factors: positive association with hypertension.
PG  - 409-16
AB  - The study analyzes the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in 1343 patients
      with severe headache (399 men and 944 women), aged 15 to 64 years; analyses were 
      controlled for sex, age, and type and frequency of headache. Prevalence of
      various forms of headache was different between men and women. Age and days per
      year with headache were significantly different among various forms of headache. 
      For men and women with headache, age directly related to prevalence of
      hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity. Due to low prevalence, analyses 
      by age were not done for diabetes mellitus. For cigarette smoking, prevalence was
      not related to age in men, but was inversely related to age in women. With
      control for age, prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors was not significantly 
      different among patients with different forms of headache, except for cluster
      headache. Among men with cluster headache, prevalence was high for cigarette
      smoking, but low for hypercholesterolemia. With control for age, days per year
      with headache did not relate to prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors except 
      for cigarette smoking in men. Compared to data for a population sample used as
      control, patients with headache had higher prevalence of hypertension in both
      sexes, independent of age (odds ratio 1.51, 95% confidence interval 1.28 to
      1.80); the difference between patients with headache and the control population
      was lower with increasing age. The high prevalence of hypertension among patients
      with headache was not due to overweight. The data indicate that headache is
      significantly associated with hypertension, but not with other cardiovascular
      risk factors.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of rizatriptan 10 mg in migraine: experience with 70
      527 patient episodes.
PG  - 264-70
AB  - As patients who suffer from migraine need long-term treatment, the safety and
      consistent efficacy of such therapy is very important. Concurrent illness and
      additional medication can interfere with the treatment chosen for the attacks of 
      migraine. The objective of this open-label study was to investigate the efficacy 
      and tolerability of rizatriptan, in the treatment of up to three attacks of
      migraine, in the clinical setting. From October 1998 to July 1999, 6 174 doctors 
      enrolled 33 147 patients into the study (26 644 women, 650 men). The mean age was
      42.7 years. We were able to examine standardized migraine diaries relating to 25 
      501 patients and 70 537 migrainous episodes. Rizatriptan scored consistently high
      on efficacy and showed a consistently rapid onset. There was no evidence of
      tolerance to repeated use. An effect was reported within 1 hour of ingestion in
      79% of attacks treated. In 27.8% of attacks, remission of headache was complete
      at 1 hour. Two hours after ingestion, 74% of attacks had subsided completely.
      Repeated administration of rizatriptan was well tolerated, and few adverse
      effects were seen. The most common unwanted effects were dizziness, weakness,
      fatigue, and nausea. No cardiovascular disturbance was seen. In the clinical
      setting, rizatriptan, 10 mg, is an effective and well-tolerated agent for the
      treatment of migraine attacks. Particularly noteworthy is the rapid onset of
      effect, with swift disappearance of headache. Rizatriptan has a favorable side
      effect profile, and, provided contraindications are observed, severe adverse
      cardiovascular complications are extremely unlikely.

TI  - Differentiating the efficacy of 5-HT(1B/1D) agonists.
PG  - 257-63
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine, for a set of published clinical trials of serotonin
      (5-HT(1B/1D)) agonists as acute treatments for migraine, whether transformation
      of efficacy data into therapeutic gain (TG) or number needed to treat (NNT) is
      useful. BACKGROUND: Pivotal clinical trials of 5-HT(1B/1D) agonists in migraine
      use a primary end point of change in pain score from 3 or 2 to 1 or 0. Placebo
      response rates among such studies are variable. Meta-analytic comparisons of
      5-HT(1B/1D) agonists often employ TG and NNT as efficacy measures. METHODS: Data 
      from US product labeling or published sources were converted into TG (TG = active
      response rate [%] - placebo response rate [%]) and NNT (NNT = 1/TG). Pivotal
      clinical trial data were compared before and after transformation. RESULTS:
      Therapeutic gain ranged from 17.5% to 51%. The transformation of TG into NNT
      yielded no clinically significant difference in efficacy estimate for the range
      of 17.5% to 47% (N = 29 clinical trials). However, NNT and TG had a nonlinear
      relationship for some secondary end points. When the relationship between the
      standard primary and secondary end points was compared, the correlation of TG
      with clinical disability (Pearson coefficient R = 0.93) was stronger than for
      NNT. Placebo response rates correlated more strongly with NNT (R = 0.66) than
      active response rates (R = 0.42; N = 29 clinical trials), although both TG and
      NNT were sensitive to placebo response rate. CONCLUSIONS: Transforming efficacy
      rates into TG or NNT adds no new information to placebo-controlled trials. The
      variables, TG and NNT, should not be used to compare members of this class of
      drugs. Migraine therapies can only be compared using well-designed head-to-head
      studies and not by meta-analysis. Broader measures of efficacy should be used to 
      describe and compare 5-HT(1B/1D) efficacy.

TI  - Naratriptan as short-term prophylaxis of menstrually associated migraine: a
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 248-56
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of naratriptan 1-mg and 2.5-mg tablets twice
      daily compared with placebo as short-term prophylaxis of menstrually associated
      migraine. BACKGROUND: Approximately 60% of women with migraine report headaches
      associated with their menstrual cycles. Results from an open-label study suggest 
      that short-term administration of sumatriptan is useful in the prophylaxis of
      menstrually associated migraine. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, three-arm, 
      parallel-group, placebo-controlled study was conducted in women aged 18 years or 
      older with a history of migraine with or without aura, as defined by the
      International Headache Society, of at least 6 months. Two dose strengths of
      naratriptan (1 mg, 2.5 mg) or identical-appearing placebo tablets (1:1:1) were
      administered twice daily for 5 days starting 2 days prior to the expected onset
      of menses across four perimenstrual periods. End points included the number of
      menstrually associated migraines, total migraine days, peak headache severity,
      lost work/activity time, migraine-related quality of life, and incidence of
      adverse events. RESULTS: Overall, the intent-to-treat population comprised 206
      women (naratriptan 1 mg, n = 70; naratriptan 2.5 mg, n = 70, and placebo, n =
      66); 171 women treated four perimenstrual periods. Significantly more
      perimenstrual periods per subject treated with naratriptan, 1 mg, were
      headache-free compared with placebo (50% versus 25%, P =.003). Naratriptan, 1 mg,
      significantly reduced the number of menstrually associated migraines (2.0 versus 
      4.0, P <.05) and menstrually associated migraine days (4.2 versus 7.0, P <.01)
      compared with placebo. More patients treated with naratriptan, 1 mg, were
      headache-free across all treated perimenstrual periods compared with placebo (23%
      versus 8%). No difference in headache severity was observed in breakthrough
      headaches. The incidence and severity of adverse events was similar across
      treatment groups. Naratriptan, 2.5 mg, was not statistically superior to placebo 
      for any measure. CONCLUSIONS: Naratriptan, 1 mg, with tolerability similar to
      placebo, is an effective, short-term, prophylactic treatment for menstrually
      associated migraine.

TI  - A systematic review of the use of triptans in acute migraine.
PG  - 30-41
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A systematic review of the literature was undertaken, to consolidate
      evidence concerning the efficacy and safety of triptans currently available in
      Canada (sumatriptan, rizatriptan, naratriptan, zolmitriptan), and to provide
      guidelines for selection of a triptan. METHODS: Data from published, randomized, 
      placebo-controlled trials were pooled and a combined number needed to treat (NNT)
      and number needed to harm (NNH) was generated for each triptan. Direct
      comparative trials of triptans were also examined. RESULTS: The lowest NNT for
      headache response/pain-free at one/two hours is observed with subcutaneous
      sumatriptan. Among the oral formulations, the lowest NNT is observed with
      rizatriptan and the highest NNT with naratriptan. The lowest NNH is observed with
      subcutaneous sumatriptan. CONCLUSIONS: Triptans are relatively safe and effective
      medications for acute migraine attacks. However, differences among them are
      relatively small. Considerations in selecting a triptan include individual
      patient response/tolerance, characteristics of the attacks, relief of associated 
      symptoms, consistency of response, headache recurrence, delivery systems and
      patient preference.

TI  - Migraine pharmacotherapy with oral triptans: a rational approach to clinical
      management.
PG  - 391-404
AB  - The recent clinical development of a number of migraine specific 5-HT1B/1D
      agonist triptans with enhanced lipophilicity (TELs), relative to the first drug
      of this class sumatriptan, and with a range of different metabolic,
      pharmacokinetic and receptor affinity profiles, provides the potential for
      critically different clinical profiles. Eletriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan and 
      zolmitriptan display both increased stability to first pass metabolic
      inactivation by monoamine oxidase (MAO-A) and enhanced lipophilicity (4- to >
      120-fold more than sumatriptan), leading to increased oral bioavailability (2- to
      5-fold more than the 14% reported for oral sumatriptan). Central penetration and 
      increased receptor affinity and selectivity for the neuronal (5-HT1D) receptor
      also combine to allow for lower total oral dosing (i.e., unit doses of 15 mg or
      less compared with 50-300 mg doses of sumatriptan) and reduced peripheral
      exposure to the coronary vasoconstrictor (5-HT1B) receptor. The notable exception
      being eletriptan, where an active P-glycoprotein blood-brain barrier efflux
      system effectively negates these benefits and requires an 80 mg oral dose.
      Differences in the metabolic balance between hepatic P450 (especially CYP 1A2)
      and MAO-A inactivation lead to potential drug interactions for all TELs with the 
      oral contraceptive pill (OCP), fluvoxamine and the quinilone antibiotics (with
      increased triptan levels). An important but complex MAO-A interaction between a
      metabolite of propranolol and rizatriptan mandates dosage reduction (to 5 mg) for
      rizatriptan in the presence of propranolol treatment. There is also an absolute
      contraindication for the concurrent administration of the MAO-A inhibitor
      moclobemide and rizatriptan. All the new-marketed TELs have potential clinical
      benefits and were well-tolerated relative to sumatriptan. Both rizatriptan (10
      mg) and zolmitriptan (2.5 mg and 5 mg) demonstrate at least equivalent efficacy
      to sumatriptan 25, 50 and 100 mg, respectively, making them suitable first line
      agents for moderate or severe migraine headaches. Rizatriptan has the fastest
      onset of effect of the TELs. Naratriptan would appear to have lower recurrent
      headache rate than sumatriptan, rizatriptan or zolmitriptan. Therefore, for
      headaches of long duration and with a tendency to recur naratriptan may be the
      most appropriate treatment. Thus, knowledge of the metabolic, pharmacokinetic and
      clinical profiles of the TELs facilitates the selection of a triptan which allows
      optimisation of the clinical benefits for individual patients, minimising the
      risk of drug interactions and a minimally effective dose to reduce potential
      adverse events (AEs).

TI  - Hemodynamic and electrocardiographic effects of almotriptan in healthy
      volunteers.
PG  - 280-9
AB  - We studied the possible cardiovascular effects of single oral doses of 12.5, 25, 
      and 50 mg of almotriptan, a new triptan for treatment of migraine, in a
      randomized, double-blind, four-way crossover, placebo-controlled study in 24
      healthy volunteers aged 18 to 35 years. Doses were given at 1-week intervals.
      Cardiovascular effects were assessed by frequent recording of blood pressure and 
      heart rate, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) (recorded at 25 mm/s paper speed and 
      1 cm/mV and at 50 mm/s and 2 cm/mV), and continuous ECG monitoring for 12 h after
      each dose. ECG variables, PR, QRS, QT interval, and QT dispersion, were measured.
      QT intervals were adjusted for heart rate using Bazett's formula. None of the
      doses of almotriptan differed significantly from placebo with respect to PR, QRS,
      or QTc intervals, QTc dispersion, heart rate, or continuous ECG monitoring.
      Almotriptan 12.5 mg did not differ significantly from placebo with respect to
      systolic or diastolic blood pressure, but almotriptan 25 and 50 mg raised
      systolic blood pressure by a mean of 2.78 and 4.17 mm Hg, and diastolic blood
      pressure by 3.77 and 6.11 mm Hg, respectively, during 0 to 4 h after dosing. Thus
      none of the doses of almotriptan affected the ECG, and the 12.5-mg dose (the
      expected therapeutic dose) had no hemodynamic effects. Almotriptan in doses of 25
      and 50 mg caused a small, dose-related increase in systolic and diastolic blood
      pressure, as seen with other triptans.

TI  - Effectiveness of eletriptan in reducing time loss caused by migraine attacks.
PG  - 557-66
AB  - BACKGROUND: The growing literature on the economics of migraine and its treatment
      generally indicates that the direct healthcare costs of managing the disorder are
      relatively low compared with the personal and societal burdens resulting from the
      disruption to normal functioning caused by migraine attacks. OBJECTIVE: To
      investigate the effectiveness of eletriptan, a new selective serotonin
      (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT)5-HTIB/ID agonist, in reducing both the
      patient-focused burden of migraine and the amount of work time foregone during a 
      single attack. DESIGN: In a phase III, multinational, randomised clinical trial, 
      692 patients treated a migraine attack with eletriptan 40 mg or 80 mg, or
      placebo. Patients responded to a questionnaire seeking information concerning the
      amount of time lost from usual activities during the attack. Time loss
      assessments were made 24 hours after the last dose taken and recorded in a diary.
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS: Patients receiving either dose of the active
      compound were unable to perform their usual activities for a median period of 4
      hours compared with 9 hours experienced by those taking placebo. This difference 
      was highly statistically significant (p < 0.001). The time saving associated with
      eletriptan usage reflected the differences in efficacy findings in the clinical
      component of the study. CONCLUSION: In this placebo-controlled trial, eletriptan 
      produced a significant reduction in the loss of usual functioning time associated
      with a migraine attack. This gain clearly represents a substantial benefit to
      patients with migraine irrespective of how it might most appropriately be valued 
      in monetary terms. Further methodological progress in this area is warranted.

TI  - Pharmacology and efficacy of eletriptan for the treatment of migraine attacks.
PG  - 670-4
AB  - Sumatriptan, a 5-HT 1B/1D agonist, was introduced 10 years ago and was the most
      effective therapy for migraine attacks at that time. Eletriptan is a new 5-HT
      1B/1D agonist with high potency and selectivity at 5-HT 1B/1D receptors. It is
      effective in animal models in which the vascular and neurogenic mechanisms
      implicated in migraine were measured. Eletriptan is selective for the
      intracranial blood vessels over other extracranial vasculature, in particular
      coronary arteries. Eletriptan has a rapid and complete oral absorption and a good
      oral bioavailability in migraineurs. In comparative trials 20 mg, 40 mg and 80 mg
      eletriptan, 100 mg sumatritpan and placebo were compared for the treatment of
      migraine attacks. All three doses of eletriptan were statistically superior to
      placebo for headache response and headache-free patients. The 80 mg dose of
      eletriptan was also superior to sumatriptan 100 mg. Headache recurrence, defined 
      as return of moderate or severe headache within 24 hours of dosing and following 
      a headache response at two hours after initial dosing, occurred in 33% of the
      patients following 100 mg sumatriptan and in 28%, 34% and 32% after 20 mg, 40 mg 
      and 80 mg eletriptan. In another large trial, headache response rates were
      significantly higher for both doses of eletriptan (64% for 40 mg and 67% for 80
      mg) than for two doses of sumatriptan (50% for 50 mg and 53% for 100 mg).
      Eletriptan 40 mg or 80 mg was also superior to ergotamine plus caffeine
      (Cafergot). In summary, eletriptan is a highly effective and fast-acting drug for
      the treatment of acute migraine attacks.

TI  - Treatment satisfaction, functional status, and health-related quality of life of 
      migraine patients treated with almotriptan or sumatriptan.
PG  - 127-45
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcomes, such as treatment satisfaction, functional
      status, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) are essential components of
      migraine research. Almotriptan is a new selective serotonin 1B/1D agonist triptan
      migraine treatment. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this double-blind, multicenter,
      randomized, parallel-group study was to compare treatment satisfaction,
      functional status, and HRQOL of patients treated with oral almotriptan versus
      sumatriptan, the leading triptan on the market. METHODS: Migraine patients, aged 
      18 to 71 years, took equivalent oral doses of 12.5 mg almotriptan or 50 mg
      sumatriptan for the abortive treatment of a migraine headache. Treatment
      satisfaction differences between study groups were assessed using a 6-item
      measure to determine patients' satisfaction with pain relief and satisfaction
      with side effects 48 hours after drug administration. Functional status was
      assessed by analyzing the change in patients' ability to perform normal
      activities during the course of the migraine. HRQOL was compared between
      treatment groups at 24 hours using the Migraine Quality of Life Questionnaire.
      End points were assessed using entries from patients' 48-hour diaries. RESULTS: A
      total of 1173 patients were treated with almotriptan or sumatriptan. There were
      no significant differences between the 2 treatment groups in terms of
      satisfaction with pain relief; however, patients in the almotriptan group were
      significantly more satisfied (less bothered) with side effects than those
      receiving sumatriptan (P = 0.016). Functional status and HRQOL outcomes were not 
      significantly different between groups. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, migraine
      patients treated with almotriptan were significantly more satisfied with the
      side-effect profile of the drug than patients treated with sumatriptan. The
      results of this study may help inform practicing physicians and neurologists
      about the potential treatment satisfaction advantages of almotriptan.

TI  - Evaluation of the potential pharmacokinetic interaction between almotriptan and
      fluoxetine in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 217-23
AB  - This study was designed to assess the pharmacokinetics of almotriptan, a 5HT1B/1D
      agonist used to treat migraine attacks, when administered in the presence and
      absence of fluoxetine. Healthy male (n = 3) and female (n = 11) volunteers
      received (1) 60 mg fluoxetine daily for 8 days and 12.5 mg almotriptan on Day 8
      and (2) 12.5 mg almotriptan on Day 8, according to a two-way crossover design.
      Plasma and urinary almotriptan concentrations were measured by HPLC methods.
      Treatment effects on pharmacokinetic parameters were assessed by analysis of
      variance. Mean almotriptan Cmax was significantly higher following combination
      treatment with fluoxetine (52.5 +/- 11.9 ng/ml vs. 44.3 +/- 10.9 ng/ml, p =
      0.023). Mean AUC0-infinity was not significantly affected by fluoxetine
      coadministration (353 +/- 55.7 ng.h/ml vs. 333 +/- 33.6 ng.h/ml, p = 0.059).
      Confidence interval analysis (90%) of log-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters 
      showed that the confidence interval for AUC0-infinity was within the 80% to 125% 
      limit for equivalence, but Cmax was not (90% CI 106%-134% of the reference mean).
      Adverse events were mild to moderate in intensity, and no clinically significant 
      treatment effects on vital signs or ECGs were observed. The results show that
      fluoxetine has only a modest effect on almotriptan Cmax. Concomitant
      administration of the two drugs is well tolerated, and no adjustment of the
      almotriptan dose is warranted.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of naratriptan in adolescent subjects with a history of
      migraine.
PG  - 170-5
AB  - Naratriptan is a novel 5-HT1 agonist developed to treat acute migraine. The study
      objective was to characterize the pharmacokinetics of oral naratriptan in
      adolescent migraine patients outside a migraine attack. Subjects received a
      single 2.5 mg naratriptan tablet. Serial serum samples for naratriptan
      concentrations were collected over 24 hours. Blood pressure, pulse rate, and
      12-lead ECG were recorded at baseline and at regular intervals after dosing.
      Seven patients--3 males and 4 females, 12 to 16 years of age--received drug and
      completed the study. The geometric mean and 95% confidence interval maximum
      concentration (Cmax) was 8.0 ng/mL (5.9-10.7), elimination half-life (t1/2) was
      4.9 hours (4.5-5.4), area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) was 74.6
      ng.h/mL (56.6-98.2), and apparent total clearance (Cl/F) was 558.8 mL/min
      (424.3-735.9). The median time to maximal concentration (tmax) was 4 hours, with 
      a range of 1.5 to 4. Blood pressure, pulse rate, and ECG parameters did not
      change significantly from baseline. No serious adverse events or subject
      withdrawal after drug administration occurred. Oral naratriptan pharmacokinetic
      parameters in adolescents were similar to values reported in adults. Naratriptan 
      doses for adolescents older than 12 years of age would be expected to be similar 
      to adult doses.

TI  - Evidence-based migraine therapy: learning needs and knowledge assessment.
PG  - 5-9
AB  - One of the primary goals of continuing medical education (CME) is to enhance the 
      learners' performance, and a major goal of evidence-based medicine (EBM) is to
      improve knowledge of current best care. This paper overviews the use of a
      Learning Needs and Knowledge Assessment tool to highlight the potential learning 
      needs and knowledge of neurologists and to focus the issues, interest and
      interactions of neurologists in a workshop on EBM migraine therapy. Virtually all
      neurologists felt they used evidence-based medicine in their daily practice.
      Surprisingly, 50% of neurologists agreed that they were uncertain which triptan
      to use. The great majority of neurologists felt that the triptans were not all
      equally efficacious. Our survey identified significant knowledge gaps among
      neurologists regarding how to appraise the validity of evidence from a randomized
      clinical trial, and with regard to what are the most clinically useful measures
      of benefit in clinical trials.

TI  - Pharmacology of emesis and gastrointestinal motility: implications for migraine.
PG  - 43-9
AB  - This paper outlines the physiopharmacology of emesis and its gastrointestinal
      motor correlates in relation to the possible treatment strategies of a migraine
      attack. The gastrointestinal motor correlates of vomiting consist of a
      stereotyped motor response to diverse stimuli and basically include gastric
      relaxation and a series of events (intestinal motor inhibition and disruption of 
      slow wave activity) in preparation for the occurrence of a retrograde giant
      contraction that propagates orally and empties intestinal contents into the
      stomach. These motor correlates always accompany vomiting, but may also appear as
      an independent phenomenon. Antidopaminergic agents, such as metoclopramide and
      domperidone, have antiemetic/prokinetic properties, block the gastrointestinal
      motor correlates of vomiting and may speed up absorption of antimigraine agents. 
      The use of 5-HT4 receptor agonists may be an alternative strategy to achieve
      prokinesia during a migraine attack, although this issue still needs to be fully 
      addressed by controlled studies. Sumatriptan was found to induce gastric
      relaxation and delay gastric emptying, but the impact of these effects during a
      migraine attack remains to be determined.

TI  - NSAIDs: behind the mechanisms of action.
PG  - 202-7
AB  - Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are a heterogeneous group of
      compounds. These heterogeneous agents have a similar therapeutic action for the
      treatment of pain, fever and inflammation. The major mechanism of action of
      NSAIDs is the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX), the enzyme catalysing the
      synthesis of prostaglandins (PGs). Appropriate and effective treatment for
      migraine depends upon an accurate diagnosis. The goals of treatment are
      amelioration of the symptoms of an acute attack and prevention of further
      attacks.

TI  - Rational migraine management: optimising treatment with the triptans.
PG  - 182-91
AB  - In the last two years, a number of 5-HT1B/1D agonist triptans with enhanced
      lipophilicity (TELs) relative to the first drug of this class, sumatriptan, have 
      been approved for marketing in most countries of the world (naratriptan,
      rizatriptan and zolmitriptan). In addition, at least three others are in advanced
      stage of clinical development (almotriptan, eletriptan, and frovatriptan). This
      paper sets out to review the recent data with the aim of identifying: 1) What are
      the critical differences between the TELs and sumatriptan? 2) How do the
      currently licensed TELs compare? 3) Is it possible to provide a rational approach
      to migraine therapy based on objective differences in the clinical profile of
      these new drugs? Recent randomised controlled and comparator data were reviewed, 
      including the independent FDA assessment of rizatriptan. Critical differences for
      the new TELs (naratriptan, rizatriptan and zolmitriptan) which may lead to more
      rational migraine management: Both rizatriptan (10 mg) and zolmitriptan (2.5 mg
      and 5.0 mg) have demonstrated superior efficacy to sumatriptan 100 mg, and 25 and
      50 mg respectively. Therefore, for first line use either rizatriptan or
      zolmitriptan would be appropriate for moderate and severe headache. Rizatriptan
      has a more rapid onset of action than sumatriptan 100 mg. Both rizatriptan and
      zolmitriptan have a more rapid onset of action than naratriptan. Therefore, for a
      rapid onset of action either rizatriptan or zolmitriptan would be appropriate.
      Naratriptan would appear to have a lower recurrent headache rate than
      sumatriptan, rizatriptan or zolmitriptan. However, 24-hour efficacy rates for
      zolmitriptan 2.5 mg were significantly greater than for sumatriptan 25 mg and 50 
      mg and were not significantly different from naratriptan. Therefore, for
      headaches of long duration and with a tendency to recur (e.g. menstrual
      headaches) either naratriptan or zolmitriptan would be appropriate. Naratriptan
      has lower reported adverse event rates comparable with placebo. This would
      support the use of naratriptan 2.5 mg in patients who have demonstrated poor
      tolerance to the "triptan type" adverse events.

TI  - One-year tolerability and efficacy of sumatriptan nasal spray in adolescents with
      migraine: results of a multicenter, open-label study.
PG  - 1533-46
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the 1-year tolerability
      and efficacy of sumatriptan nasal spray (NS) at doses of 5, 10, and 20 mg for the
      treatment of acute migraine in adolescents. METHODS: This was a prospective,
      multicenter, open-label, 1-year, multiple-attack study. Adolescents (aged 12-17
      years) with a > or =6-month history of migraine with or without aura, 2 to 8
      moderate or severe migraines per month, and a typical migraine duration of > or
      =4 hours were eligible for participation. After initial treatment with
      sumatriptan 10 mg, the dose could be adjusted down to 5 mg or up to 20 mg at the 
      investigator's discretion to optimize tolerability or efficacy. Patients could
      treat an unlimited number of moderate or severe migraine attacks, provided there 
      was a 24-hour headache-free period between treated attacks and a 2-hour period
      between doses of sumatriptan NS. A second dose of sumatriptan NS was available
      for headache recurrence 2 to 24 hours after initial treatment; no more than 2
      doses could be used within a 24-hour period. Adverse events, vital signs,
      electrocardiographic and physical findings, and laboratory variables were
      assessed. Headache response (reduction of moderate/severe predose pain to mild/no
      pain) and pain-free response (reduction of moderate/severe predose pain to no
      pain) were reported by patients 2 hours after dosing. RESULTS: A total of 437
      patients treated > or =1 migraine; 3272 total attacks were treated, with 3675
      drug exposures (mean, 1.1 dose/attack). Patients had a mean age of 14.1 years,
      91% were white, and 53% were female. Seven patients used the 5-mg dose;
      meaningful conclusions concerning this dose could not be made. Drug-related
      adverse events were reported in 33% of attacks with the 10-mg dose and 31% with
      the 20-mg dose; most were related to taste disturbance. Adverse events did not
      increase with a second dose or over time. Four percent (16/437) of patients
      withdrew due to drug-related adverse events. One serious adverse event, a
      facial-nerve ischemic event (10-mg dose), was considered drug related. No
      drug-related changes in vital signs or electrocardiographic findings were
      observed. Headache response 2 hours after dosing was reported by 76% of patients 
      taking the 10-mg dose and 72% of those taking the 20-mg dose. Pain-free response 
      2 hours after dosing was reported by 43% and 40% of patients in the 10- and 20-mg
      groups, respectively. Conclusions: Based on these results, sumatriptan NS at
      doses of 10 and 20 mg was well tolerated and effective in the 1-year treatment of
      multiple migraine attacks in adolescents.

TI  - Long-term efficacy and safety of oral almotriptan: interim analysis of a 1-year
      open study.
PG  - 57-62
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term tolerability and safety of a single, oral
      12.5-mg dose of almotriptan and its efficacy in alleviating pain associated with 
      consecutive migraine episodes occurring during a 12-month period. BACKGROUND:
      While sumatriptan appears to be effective for treatment of migraine, the drug has
      several properties that limit its use. Almotriptan, a new selective 5-HT1B/1D
      agonist, may be better tolerated over the long term. METHODS: This 1-year study
      was conducted on 806 adults between the ages of 18 and 65 years suffering from
      migraine, either with or without aura. The patients met the criteria for study as
      outlined by the International Headache Society and were instructed on drug use.
      Oral almotriptan 12.5 mg was used to treat the attack of any pain severity and a 
      second dose was permitted in case of relapse of pain during the first 24 hours.
      Rescue medication was provided. Efficacy and tolerability were assessed by a
      combination of patient reporting and clinical visit evaluations. RESULTS:
      Overall, almotriptan was well tolerated. At 2 hours, 81% of attacks were
      relieved; 56% of the subjects were entirely free of pain. These efficacy data are
      similar for the first as well as the last attack studied. At analysis, 534
      patients had treated their migraines for at least 6 months. About half of all
      patients experienced at least one adverse event, with 87% of the events being
      mild or moderate in nature. The most frequent adverse events were back pain
      (7.23% of patients), bronchitis (5.76%), and influenzalike symptoms (5.62%).
      Seventy-one percent of the adverse events were not related to almotriptan use.
      CONCLUSIONS: Almotriptan at an oral dose of 12.5 mg is safe antimigraine
      treatment. The safety profile results are similar to those obtained in other
      controlled triptan clinical studies. Almotriptan is efficacious in
      moderate-to-severe migraine pain and can be used repeatedly in recurrent
      episodes. The long-term safety data will be reanalyzed when full data become
      available.

TI  - Work and productivity loss in the rizatriptan multiple attack study.
PG  - 830-4
AB  - The objective of this study was to measure the self-reported effect of acute
      migraine and its treatment on paid work and productivity loss. Patients
      self-administered a questionnaire in which the impact of a recent migraine on
      paid work and productivity activities was assessed. We included the questionnaire
      in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, out-patient study
      designed to examine the safety and efficacy of rizatriptan (5-HT1B/1D receptor
      agonist) 10 mg p.o. in patients treating four separate migraine attacks. A total 
      of 407 patients, aged 18-65 years, suffering from moderate to severe migrainous
      headaches was studied. Patients receiving rizatriptan compared with placebo
      reported 0.7 fewer hours (P < 0.01) of paid worked missed due to absenteeism, 0.4
      fewer hours (P < 0.05) of productive time lost on the job, and 1.1 fewer total
      hours (P < 0.01) of work loss per migraine attack. Rizatriptan compared with
      placebo significantly reduced migraine-related work loss associated with
      absenteeism and decreased effectiveness on the job.

TI  - Are triptans with enhanced lipophilicity used for the acute treatment of migraine
      associated with an increased consulting rate for depressive illness?
PG  - 732-7
AB  - 1997, sumatriptan-treated migraineurs had significantly higher depression PCRs
      (22.3%) compared with non-triptan users (19.3%), a difference of 6.4% (95%
      confidence interval (CI) 4.6-8.4%, P < 0.001). In the year (April 1997 to March
      1998) following the launch of the TELs, depression PCRs were significantly higher
      among patients using these compounds compared with sumatriptan-treated patients
      (5.1%, CI 1.8-12.0%, P < 0.05). However, after taking account of prior depression
      (odds ratio (OR) 6.45, 95% CI 3.63-11.43), TELs were not significantly associated
      with depression (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.03-2.13). Furthermore, rates of newly
      diagnosed depression after treatment were similar in the two triptan groups
      (sumatriptan 4.2%; TELs 3.9%). Although, the TELs are being prescribed to
      patients with higher pre-existing rates of depression, they are not associated
      with subsequently increased consulting for depressive illness compared with
      patients taking sumatriptan. This study highlights the potential to use GPRD to
      test targeted hypotheses exploring pharmacovigilance issues for patients using
      new medicines.

TI  - Tolerability of sumatriptan: clinical trials and post-marketing experience.
PG  - 687-95
AB  - Through December 1998, sumatriptan had been used to treat more than 236 million
      migraine attacks world-wide. In clinical trials alone, more than 88000 migraine
      patients had treated more than 300000 migraine attacks with sumatriptan, and 2000
      normal healthy volunteers had been exposed to the drug. This paper describes the 
      safety and tolerability profile of sumatriptan in three sections: adverse events 
      reported in clinical trials, special issues, and spontaneous post-marketing
      reports of adverse reactions. Data from the extensive clinical trials programme
      coupled with information from nearly 10 years of experience in clinical practice 
      demonstrate that sumatriptan is generally well-tolerated, with an acceptable
      benefit-risk ratio when used properly. Significant cardiovascular and
      cerebrovascular events are rare but have been observed. This fact highlights the 
      need for careful patient selection and vigilant adherence to the prescribing
      recommendations for sumatriptan. The wealth of clinical trials and post-marketing
      information for sumatriptan may be useful in guiding prescribing decisions for
      members of this class of drugs.

TI  - Triptans in migraine: a comparative review of pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and 
      efficacy.
PG  - 1259-87
AB  - Triptans are a new class of compounds developed for the treatment of migraine
      attacks. The first of the class, sumatriptan, and the newer triptans
      (zolmitriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, eletriptan, almotriptan and
      frovatriptan) display high agonist activity at mainly the serotonin 5-HT1B and
      5-HT1D receptor subtypes. As expected for a class of compounds developed for
      affinity at a specific receptor, there are minor pharmacodynamic differences
      between the triptans. Sumatriptan has a low oral bioavailability (14%) and all
      the newer triptans have an improved oral bioavailability and for one,
      risatriptan, the rate of absorption is faster. The half-lives of naratriptan,
      eletriptan and, in particular, frovatriptan (26 to 30h) are longer than that of
      sumatriptan (2h). These pharmacokinetic improvements of the newer triptans so far
      seem to have only resulted in minor differences in their efficacy in migraine.
      Double-blind, randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing the different triptans 
      and triptans with other medication should ideally be the basis for judging their 
      place in migraine therapy. In only 15 of the 83 reported RCTs were 2 triptans
      compared, and in 11 trials triptans were compared with other drugs. Therefore, in
      all placebo-controlled randomised clinical trials, the relative efficacy of the
      triptans was also judged by calculating the therapeutic gain (i.e. percentage
      response for active minus percentage response for placebo). The mean therapeutic 
      gain with subcutaneous sumatriptan 6mg (51%) was more than that for all other
      dosage forms of triptans (oral sumatriptan 100mg 32%; oral sumatriptan 50mg 29%: 
      intranasal sumatriptan 20mg 30%; rectal sumatriptan 25mg 31%; oral zolmitriptan
      2.5mg 32%; oral rizatriptan 10mg 37%; oral eletriptan 40mg 37%; oral almotriptan 
      12.5mg 26%). Compared with oral sumatriptan 100mg (32%), the mean therapeutic
      gain was higher with oral eletriptan 80mg (42%) but lower with oral naratriptan
      2.5mg (22%) or oral frovatriptan 2.5mg (16%). The few direct comparative
      randomised clinical trials with oral triptans reveal the same picture. Recurrence
      of headache within 24 hours after an initial successful response occurs in 30 to 
      40% of sumatriptan-treated patients. Apart from naratriptan, which has a tendency
      towards less recurrence, there appears to be no consistent difference in
      recurrence rates between the newer triptans and sumatriptan. Rizatriptan with its
      shorter time to maximum concentration (tmax) tended to produce a quicker onset of
      headache relief than sumatriptan and zolmitriptan. The place of triptans compared
      with non-triptan drugs in migraine therapy remains to be established and further 
      RCTs are required.

TI  - New avenues in treatment of paediatric migraine: a review of the literature.
PG  - 101-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Headaches are a common problem in paediatric practice. Recurrent
      headaches can be a significant source of stress for patient and parents, and
      disruptive regarding school obligations and parental work responsibilities. Most 
      treatment interventions are developed from research data extrapolated from adult 
      studies, with resultant concerns of safety and efficacy when utilizing these
      therapeutic conclusions in children. METHODS: This paper incorporates current
      treatment strategies in paediatric migraine utilizing a Medline search of English
      language studies from January 1988 to December 1999, with a literature search
      referencing the terms of paediatrics, migraines, headaches, therapy and
      treatment. Reference sections of the articles were reviewed for pertinent
      information prior to January 1988. Articles were evaluated systematically to
      formulate concise terms for diagnosis of paediatric migraine and applicability to
      clinical treatment studies. Particular emphasis was placed on newer options with 
      relevance in adult treatment such as triptans and anti-epileptic drugs, and their
      benefit in therapy of paediatric migraine. Non-pharmacological options were also 
      subjected to organized review to determine relevance in treatment of paediatric
      migraine. RESULTS: The review of the literature indicates that although migraine 
      in childhood and adolescence appears to be increasing in prevalence, few clinical
      studies are available, with most current treatment recommendations utilizing data
      from adult studies. CONCLUSION: Further headache treatment studies in the
      paediatric population are necessary in order to ascertain safety and efficacy of 
      pharmaco-therapeutics in these children. Also, much current interest in treatment
      in adults with recurrent headaches involves non-pharmacological areas-dietary
      modification and stress management. Application of these avenues especially
      warrants further clarification with regard to relevance in paediatric migraine
      treatment.

PG  - 33-40
AB  - The application of 384-well format solid phase extraction (SPE) for bioanalysis
      using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) is reported and a
      384-well SPE method for the 5-HT agonist sumatriptan in human plasma described.
      Plasma samples were extracted on a prototype low-density polyethylene 384-well
      SPE block using a packed bed of 5 mg Oasistrade mark HLB. Liquid handling was
      automated by a combination of a robotic sampler processor and a 96/384
      multi-channel dispensing station. Samples and SPE reagents were drawn through the
      SPE block by centrifugation. The extracts were analysed by LC/MS/MS with
      thermally and pneumatically assisted electrospray ionisation and selected
      reaction monitoring. The method is used to illustrate and discuss the feasibility
      and viability of sample preparation techniques in high-density microtitre plate
      format for routine bioanalysis.

TI  - Hypnic headache: another indomethacin-responsive headache syndrome?
PG  - 830-5
AB  - Hypnic headache syndrome is a benign, recurrent, late-onset headache disorder
      that occurs exclusively during sleep. Lithium has been reported to be an
      effective treatment, but the side effects of this medication are sometimes
      prohibitive, particularly in the elderly. Other drugs have been reported to be
      effective in this disorder, including caffeine, flunarizine, and verapamil.
      Recently, indomethacin has been reported to effectively suppress hypnic
      headaches. We report the response of seven patients with hypnic headache who were
      treated with indomethacin. Hypnic headache syndrome appears to represent yet
      another headache disorder in which there is sometimes an impressive response to
      indomethacin.

TI  - Treatment of mild headache in disabled migraine sufferers: results of the
      Spectrum Study.
PG  - 792-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of sumatriptan, 50-mg tablets, versus
      placebo for early intervention while head pain was mild in patients with
      disabling migraine. METHODS: A post hoc analysis was performed in a subgroup of
      patients from a large, randomized, placebo-controlled study of patients with
      disabling headache who treated while pain was mild. Pain-free response 2 and 4
      hours postdose, headache recurrence, and safety were examined. Significance tests
      were performed only for the first-treated attacks. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients
      with disabling headache treated 46 mild and 166 moderate or severe headaches. For
      the first-treated headaches while pain was mild, pain-free rates were
      significantly higher for sumatriptan than placebo 4 hours postdose (78% versus
      0%, P =.02), but not 2 hours postdose (52% versus 0%, P =.22). Across all
      headaches treated while pain was mild, pain-free responses were higher for
      sumatriptan than placebo 4 hours (85% versus 17%) and 2 hours (50% versus 0%)
      postdose compared with placebo. When the same patients treated headaches while
      pain was moderate or severe, pain-free rates were lower than that reported for
      treatment during mild pain. There was a trend toward lower headache recurrence in
      headaches treated while pain was mild compared with moderate or severe pain (13% 
      versus 18%). No drug-related adverse events were reported in the headaches
      treated while pain was mild. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with disabling migraine may
      benefit from early intervention with sumatriptan, 50 mg, while pain is mild.

      results of the Spectrum Study.
PG  - 783-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: Migraineurs experience a spectrum of headaches: migraine, migrainous,
      and episodic tension-type as defined by the International Headache Society (IHS).
      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of sumatriptan, 50-mg tablets, in
      treating the spectrum of headaches in IHS-diagnosed migraineurs. DESIGN/METHODS: 
      Migraineurs with severe disability (Headache Impact Questionnaire score 250 or
      greater) were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      crossover study. Patients treated up to 10 headaches with sumatriptan, 50 mg, or 
      placebo (4:1). Headache features, recorded prior to treatment, were used to
      classify each headache using IHS criteria. Headache response (moderate or severe 
      pain reduced to mild or no pain) and pain-free response were recorded at 2 and 4 
      hours postdose (primary endpoint). Because patients treated multiple attacks,
      statistical methods controlling for within-subject correlation were used.
      RESULTS: Two hundred forty-nine migraineurs treated 1576 moderate or severe
      headaches: migraine (n = 1110), migrainous (n = 103), and tension-type (n = 363).
      Sumatriptan was superior to placebo for headache response 4 hours postdose
      (primary endpoint) across all headache types (migraine, 66% versus 48%; P<.001;
      migrainous, 71% versus 39%; P<.01; tension-type, 78% versus 50%, P<.001).
      Sumatriptan was also superior to placebo for pain-free response 4 hours postdose 
      for migraine (41% versus 24%, P<.001) and tension-type headaches (56% versus 36%,
      P =.001). Sumatriptan provided superior pain-free response 2 hours postdose for
      migraine (18% versus 7%, P<.0001) and tension-type headache (28% versus 14%, P
      =.0005) compared with placebo. CONCLUSION: Sumatriptan, 50-mg tablets, are
      effective for the full spectrum of headaches experienced by patients with
      disabling migraine due to a sumatriptan-responsive mechanism.

AB  - Functional bowel disorders are collections of symptoms attributable to the mid or
      lower gastrointestinal tract. The two most common disorders, irritable bowel
      syndrome and functional dyspepsia, have common etiopathogenetic features, notably
      psychosocial disturbances, dysmotility and heightened sensitivity. The control
      mechanisms, pathophysiology, investigation and potential pharmacotherapies of
      these disorders are reviewed. Serotonergic and adrenergic agents are among the
      novel approaches that may have a significant impact on these disorders.

TI  - Validity of the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) score in comparison to a
      diary-based measure in a population sample of migraine sufferers.
PG  - 41-52
AB  - The Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) questionnaire is a brief,
      self-administered questionnaire designed to quantify headache-related disability 
      over a 3 month period. The MIDAS score has been shown to have moderately high
      test-retest reliability in headache sufferers and is correlated with clinical
      judgment regarding the need for medical care. The aim of the study was to examine
      the validity of the MIDAS score, and the five items comprising the score,
      compared to data from a 90 day daily diary used, in part, to record acute
      disability from headache. In a population-based sample, 144 clinically diagnosed 
      migraine headache sufferers were enrolled in a 90 day diary study and completed
      the MIDAS questionnaire at the end of the study. The daily diary was used to
      record detailed information on headache features as well as activity limitations 
      in work, household chores, and non-work activities (social, family and leisure
      activities). The MIDAS score was the sum of missed work or school days, missed
      household chores days, missed non-work activity days, and days at work or school 
      plus days of household chores where productivity was reduced by half or more in
      the last 3 months. Validity was assessed by comparing MIDAS items and the MIDAS
      score with equivalent measures derived from the diary. The MIDAS items for missed
      days of work or school (mean 0.96, median 0) and for missed days of household
      work (mean 3.64, median 2.0) were similar to the corresponding diary-based
      estimates of missed work or school (mean 1.23, median 0) and of missed household 
      work (mean 3.93, median 2.01). Values for missed days of non-work activities
      (MIDAS mean 2.6 and median 1 versus diary mean 2.22 and median 0.95) were also
      similar. Responses to MIDAS questions about number of days where productivity was
      reduced by half or more in work (mean 3.77, median 2.00) and in household work
      (mean 3.92, median 2.00) significantly overestimated the corresponding
      diary-based measures for work (mean 2.94, median 1.06) and household work (mean
      2.22, median 0.98). Nonetheless, the overall MIDAS score (mean 14.53, median 9.0)
      was not significantly different form the reference diary-based measure (mean
      13.5, median 8.4). The correlation between the MIDAS summary score and an
      equivalent diary score was 0.63. The group estimate of the MIDAS score was found 
      to be a valid estimate of a rigorous diary-based measure of disability. The mean 
      and median values for the MIDAS score in a population-based sample of migraine
      cases were similar to equivalent diary measures. The correlation between the two 
      measures was in the low moderate range, but expected given that two very
      different methods of data collection were compared.

TI  - Within-patient consistency of response of rizatriptan for treating migraine.
PG  - 1511-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the within-patient consistency of response for
      rizatriptan, a 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonist for the acute treatment of migraine. 
      METHODS: Post hoc analysis was performed on data from a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled clinical trial. Four hundred seventy-three patients with
      migraine diagnosed according to the criteria of the International Headache
      Society were randomly assigned to one of five sequence groups in which each
      patient was scheduled to treat four separate moderate or severe migraine attacks.
      Patients in four groups received 10 mg of rizatriptan for three of four attacks
      and placebo for the remaining attack; patients in the fifth group received 10 mg 
      of rizatriptan for all four attacks. Headache severity, functional disability,
      and associated migraine symptoms were measured immediately before dosing and at
      regular intervals up to 4 hours after the dose. The analysis was based on
      efficacy at 2 hours after dosing, the last time point before escape medications
      were allowed. The percentages of patients who responded in a specified number of 
      attacks after treatment with rizatriptan were calculated. The analysis was
      descriptive, and no formal statistical testing was performed. RESULTS: Of the
      evaluable patients who treated three migraine attacks with 10 mg of rizatriptan
      (with an additional interspersed placebo-treated attack in most patients), 216 of
      252 (86%) had pain relief (reduction of pain to mild or none), 122 of 252 (48%)
      were pain free, 211 of 250 (84%) had no nausea, 163 of 251 (65%) had no
      photophobia, 182 of 252 (72%) had no phonophobia, 136 of 249 (55%) had no
      functional disability, and 233 of 252 (92%) had no need for escape medications at
      2 hours after dosing in at least two of three attacks. CONCLUSION: The response
      to 10 mg of oral rizatriptan within individual patients was consistent over three
      attacks on a range of measures.

TI  - Stratified care vs step care strategies for migraine: the Disability in
      Strategies of Care (DISC) Study: A randomized trial.
PG  - 2599-605
AB  - CONTEXT: Various guidelines recommend different strategies for selecting and
      sequencing acute treatments for migraine. In step care, treatment is escalated
      after first-line medications fail. In stratified care, initial treatment is based
      on measurement of the severity of illness or other factors. These strategies for 
      migraine have not been rigorously evaluated. OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical
      benefits of 3 strategies: stratified care, step care within attacks, and step
      care across attacks, among patients with migraine. DESIGN AND SETTING:
      Randomized, controlled, parallel-group clinical trial conducted by the Disability
      in Strategies Study group from December 1997 to March 1999 in 88 clinical centers
      in 13 countries. PATIENTS: A total of 835 adult migraine patients with a Migraine
      Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) grade of II, III, or IV were analyzed as the 
      efficacy population; the safety analysis included 930 patients. INTERVENTIONS:
      Patients were randomly assigned to receive (1) stratified care (n = 279), in
      which patients with MIDAS grade II treated up to 6 attacks with aspirin, 800 to
      1000 mg, plus metoclopramide, 10 mg, and patients with MIDAS grade III and IV
      treated up to 6 attacks with zolmitriptan, 2.5 mg; (2) step care across attacks
      (n = 271), in which initial treatment was with aspirin, 800 to 1000 mg, plus
      metoclopramide, 10 mg. Patients not responding in at least 2 of the first 3
      attacks switched to zolmitriptan, 2.5 mg, to treat the remaining 3 attacks; and
      (3) step care within attacks (n = 285), in which initial treatment for all
      attacks was with aspirin, 800 to 1000 mg, plus metoclopramide, 20 mg. Patients
      not responding to treatment after 2 hours in each attack escalated treatment to
      zolmitriptan, 2.5 mg. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Headache response, achieved if pain 
      intensity was reduced from severe or moderate at baseline to mild or no pain at 2
      hours; and disability time per treated attack at 4 hours for all 6 attacks,
      compared among the 3 groups. RESULTS: Headache response at 2 hours was
      significantly greater across 6 attacks in the stratified care treatment group
      (52.7%) than in either the step care across attacks group (40.6%; P<.001) or the 
      step care within attacks group (36.4%; P<.001). Disability time (6 attacks) was
      significantly lower in the stratified care group (mean area under the curve
      [AUC], 185.0 mm. h) than in the step care across attacks group (mean AUC, 209.4
      mm. h; P<.001) or the step care within attacks group (mean AUC, 199.7 mm. h;
      P<.001). The incidence of adverse events was higher in the stratified care group 
      (321 events) vs both step care groups (159 events in across-attack group; 217 in 
      within-attack group), although most events were of mild-to-moderate intensity.
      CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that as a treatment strategy, stratified care
      provides significantly better clinical outcomes than step care strategies within 
      or across attacks as measured by headache response and disability time. JAMA.

TI  - Cost-benefit analysis of sumatriptan tablets versus usual therapy for treatment
      of migraine.
PG  - 1356-64
AB  - We performed a systematic assessment of the costs and benefits of sumatriptan and
      usual therapy for migraine from society's perspective. A decision tree was
      constructed with probability estimates based on data from an open-label clinical 
      trial assessing the economic and human impacts of sumatriptan and usual therapy
      on nursing personnel. Direct medical care costs including costs for drug,
      physician, and emergency room visits were considered. Benefits were estimated
      using the human capital approach based on the national average of weekly earnings
      and productivity loss estimated from a migraine clinical trial. The net benefits 
      of sumatriptan and usual therapy for the treatment of a single migraine attack
      were estimated to be $50 and $20, respectively. The annual incremental net
      benefit of sumatriptan over usual therapy was estimated to be $114-540/patient.
      The price difference was offset by benefits of sumatriptan in reducing use of
      health care resources and productivity loss.

TI  - Consistent efficacy and tolerability of almotriptan in the acute treatment of
      multiple migraine attacks: results of a large, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 588-96
AB  - In this double-blind study, the efficacy and tolerability of a single dose of
      almotriptan (6.25 or 12.5 mg) was compared with placebo in the treatment of three
      consecutive migraine attacks of moderate or severe intensity. Of 1013 randomized 
      patients, 722 evaluable patients completed the study. The total number of attacks
      relieved (severe or moderate pain reduced to mild or no pain) at 2 h post-dose
      was significantly higher (P < 0.001) after treatment with almotriptan 6.25 or
      12.5 mg compared with placebo (60% and 70% vs. 38%, respectively). Moreover, a
      consistent response was achieved across and within patients for almotriptan 6.25 
      or 12.5 mg compared with placebo (pain relief in at least two out of three
      attacks within 2 h for 64% and 75% vs. 36%, respectively) and less than one-third
      of the patients relapsed within 24 h. Almotriptan was well tolerated with no
      significant differences between the almotriptan and placebo treatment groups in
      the percentage of patients reporting adverse events. Overall, the 12.5-mg dose
      was associated with the most favourable efficacy/tolerability ratio and is,
      therefore, the recommended dose.

TI  - Rizatriptan wafer--sublingual vs. placebo at the onset of acute migraine.
PG  - 585-7
AB  - Rizatriptan wafer is a 5HT1B/1D agonist for use in the acute treatment of
      migraine. It is a freeze-fried formulation, approved for oral administration,
      which dissolves on the tongue and is swallowed with saliva. In this study the
      efficacy of sublingually administered rizatriptan 10-mg wafer was evaluated in a 
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, out-patient study involving 39
      migraineurs. Patients were instructed to treat a migraine at the onset of pain in
      order to evaluate time of onset of pain relief and pain relief at 1 h. The
      average time to onset of relief was 25 min for patients treated with rizatriptan 
      wafer and 27 min for patients treated with placebo. At 1 h, 50% of the patients
      receiving rizatriptan wafer and 50% of the patients receiving placebo experienced
      significant relief. Implications and potential reasons for a high placebo
      response are discussed.

AB  - Determinants of patient satisfaction with migraine treatment are not well
      understood. The objective of this study was to evaluate which treatment outcomes 
      influence patient satisfaction with treatment. Analyses were performed on data
      from 1506 migraineurs from two clinical trials of rizatriptan for treatment of
      migraine. Satisfaction with treatment was assessed 2 h after initial treatment
      and prior to use of rescue therapy. Over 90% of patients who were pain-free at 2 
      h were at least somewhat satisfied with treatment compared with <10% of patients 
      with moderate or severe pain. Only 60-70% of patients with mild pain at 2 h
      experienced some level of satisfaction with treatment. For patients with mild
      pain at 2 h, results showed subjects who reported severe pain at baseline,
      absence of associated symptoms at 2 h and pain relief within the first 90 min had
      at least a 76% probability of being at least somewhat satisfied. This probability
      decreased with the presence of associated symptoms, slower pain relief and
      moderate baseline pain intensity. Fast, complete pain relief is one important
      factor in determining short-term patient satisfaction with treatment.

TI  - Zolmitriptan provides effective migraine relief in adolescents.
PG  - 466-9
AB  - Data from a subgroup of adolescents (12-17 years) entered into a one-year
      open-label phase of a large international study were analysed to evaluate
      response rates and tolerability of zolmitriptan for the acute treatment of
      migraine. In the open-label phase of this study, the first two migraine attacks
      were treated with zolmitriptan 2.5 mg and subsequent attacks with zolmitriptan
      2.5 mg or 5 mg, at the patient's discretion, for up to 12 months. Two-hour
      headache and pain-free responses were evaluated and adverse events were recorded.
      Thirty-eight adolescents treated 276 migraine attacks of any intensity. The
      overall headache response at 2 hours was 80% (88% and 70% with zolmitriptan 2.5
      mg and 5 mg, respectively), and the pain-free response was 66% (76% and 52% for
      zolmitriptan 2.5 mg and 5 mg, respectively). Response rates were independent of
      whether or not migraine was associated with aura or menses. During prolonged use,
      patients learned to adjust the dose of zolmitriptan to effectively manage their
      migraine. Treatment was well tolerated. In conclusion, preliminary data indicate 
      that zolmitriptan is effective in the acute treatment of migraine in adolescents 
      and is well tolerated.

TI  - Sumatriptan overuse in episodic cluster headache: lack of adverse events, rebound
      syndromes, drug dependence and tachyphylaxis.
PG  - 167-70
AB  - This observational study was designed to examine the pattern of sumatriptan use
      in patients with cluster headache using more than the recommended daily dose of
      subcutaneously injected (s.c.) sumatriptan. Thirteen patients suffering from
      episodic cluster headache were asked to record the characteristics of their
      attacks and drug intake for 1 year. All reported a high daily frequency of
      attacks (more than 3 per day) and the related overuse of s.c. sumatriptan. The
      results show that the overall incidence of adverse events among patients
      receiving sumatriptan injections for the treatment of cluster headache is low.
      The extended administration of this drug in episodic cluster headache did not
      result in tolerance problems or tachyphylaxis. Only 4 patients experienced minor 
      adverse events and recovered more slowly than the others. They suffered from
      migraine without aura and cluster headache, and showed a family history of
      migraine. Even though they must be viewed with caution, due to the observational 
      nature of the study and the low number of patients included, these results
      suggest that the profile of sumatriptan may differ in cluster headache compared
      with migraine.

TI  - A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of sumatriptan nasal spray
      in the treatment of acute migraine in adolescents.
PG  - 989-97
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and tolerability of sumatriptan nasal spray
      (NS; 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg) with placebo for the treatment of acute migraine in 
      adolescents. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      single-attack study was conducted in 653 US adolescents (12-17 years of age).
      Patients with at least a 6-month history of migraine, who met International
      Headache Society criteria for migraine (with or without aura) were eligible for
      participation. Headache relief 2 hours postdose, complete relief, presence or
      absence of associated symptoms, headache recurrence, and use of rescue
      medications were recorded. The primary efficacy endpoint was headache relief 2
      hours postdose sumatriptan NS (20 mg) versus placebo. Safety and tolerability
      were assessed by examining adverse events, changes in electrocardiograms, vital
      signs, physical examinations, and clinical laboratory tests. RESULTS: Headache
      relief 1 hour postdose was significantly greater for patients using 10 mg (56%)
      and 20 mg (56%) of sumatriptan NS compared with placebo (41%). Headache relief 2 
      hours postdose was significantly greater for patients using 5 mg of sumatriptan
      NS (66%) compared with placebo (53%), and approached statistical significance for
      20 mg (63%) compared with placebo (53%). Complete relief 2 hours postdose was
      significantly greater for patients using 20 mg of sumatriptan NS compared with
      placebo (36% vs 25%, respectively). Each dose of sumatriptan (5 mg, 10 mg, and 20
      mg) was superior to placebo with respect to the cumulative percentages of
      patients first reporting headache relief within 2 hours of dosing (Kaplan-Meier).
      The sumatriptan 20-mg dose was superior to placebo with respect to the cumulative
      percentages of patients first reporting complete relief within 2 hours of dosing 
      (Kaplan-Meier). Photophobia and phonophobia were significantly reduced 2 hours
      postdose for sumatriptan NS (20 mg), compared with placebo (36% vs 48% and 25% vs
      44%, respectively). Taste disturbance was the most commonly reported adverse
      event (2%, 19%, 30%, and 26% for placebo, 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg, respectively). 
      No drug-related serious adverse events or clinically relevant changes in
      laboratory parameters, electrocardiograms, or vital signs were reported.
      CONCLUSIONS: Sumatriptan NS is effective and well-tolerated for the treatment of 
      acute migraine in adolescents, with the 20-mg dose providing the best overall
      efficacy and tolerability profiles.

TI  - Effect of early intervention with sumatriptan on migraine pain: retrospective
      analyses of data from three clinical trials.
PG  - 1035-48
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the efficacy of sumatriptan 50- and 100-mg tablets
      in the treatment of migraine attacks while the pain is mild rather than
      moderate/severe. BACKGROUND: Results from The Spectrum Study suggested that early
      treatment of migraine attacks with sumatriptan 50-mg tablets while the pain is
      mild might enhance pain-free response and reduce headache recurrence. METHODS:
      Retrospective analyses of headaches treated during mild pain were performed using
      data from 3 studies of sumatriptan tablets (protocols S2CM09, S2BT25, and
      S2BT26). Our primary interest was pain-free response 2 and 4 hours after dosing; 
      secondary interests were use of a second dose of medication, clinical disability 
      (as measured on a 4-point disability scale), migraine-associated symptoms,
      meaningful pain relief (patient defined), time to meaningful relief, sustained
      pain-free response, and proportion of attacks in which pain had worsened 2 and 4 
      hours after dosing, all of which were compared in headaches treated during mild
      versus moderate/severe pain. RESULTS: In S2CM09, 92 patients treated 118
      headaches during mild pain. Rates of pain-free response were higher 2 hours after
      dosing with sumatriptan 50 mg (51%) or 100 mg (67%; P < 0.05) compared with
      placebo (28%), and were higher with early treatment of mild pain compared with
      treatment of moderate/severe pain at 2 hours (sumatriptan 50 mg: mild pain, 51%; 
      moderate/severe pain, 31%; P < 0.05; sumatriptan 100 mg: mild pain, 67%;
      moderate/severe pain, 36%) and 4 hours (50 mg: 75% vs 56%; 100 mg: 90% vs 61%; P 
      < 0.05). Early intervention also resulted in less redosing than when
      moderate/severe pain was treated (50 mg: 21% vs 32%; 100 mg: 20% vs 29%). More
      attacks treated early with sumatriptan 50 or 100 mg were associated with normal
      function 4 hours after dosing compared with placebo (70% and 93% vs 46%,
      respectively). Sustained pain-free response rates 2 to 24 hours after early
      dosing with sumatriptan 50 or 100 mg were also higher (34% and 53%, respectively)
      compared with treatment of moderate/severe pain (19% and 24%, respectively).
      Early treatment with sumatriptan 100 mg produced significantly higher pain-free
      rates at 2 hours after dosing (P < 0.001) than did ergotamine plus caffeine
      (S2BT25: 69% vs 34%, respectively) or aspirin plus metoclopramide (S2BT26: 73% vs
      25%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Sumatriptan 50- and 100-mg tablets are effective
      whether pain is mild or moderate/severe. However, treatment with sumatriptan
      while pain is mild provides high pain-free response rates while reducing the need
      for redosing, benefits not seen with ergotamine plus caffeine or aspirin plus
      metoclopramide.

TI  - Zolmitriptan (a 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist with central action) does not increase
      symptoms in obsessive compulsive disorder.
PG  - 74-9
AB  - RATIONALE: Non-selective serotonin (5-HT) receptor agonists like
      meta-chlorophenylpiperazine and MK-212 have been used to explore the role of 5-HT
      in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). The results of these studies and the
      findings of autoradiography and neuroimaging studies, pointed to a possible role 
      of the 5-HT1B/1D receptor in the pathophysiology of OCD. Recently the selective
      5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist sumatriptan was used to further explore the role of
      the 5-HT1B/1D receptor in OCD. Equivocal results with respect to the increase of 
      obsessive compulsive symptoms in patients with OCD were reported. In one study a 
      significant increase in plasma growth hormone (GH) concentration was observed,
      although sumatriptan does not pass the blood-brain barrier. OBJECTIVES: In order 
      to further explore the role of the 5-HT1B/1D receptor in the pathophysiology of
      OCD, we performed this study, following the same design as Ho Pian et al.
      (Psychopharmacology 140:365-370). METHODS: In the present study we performed a
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design with zolmitriptan
      (5 mg per os), a selective 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist with better brain
      penetrating properties than sumatriptan. RESULTS: We could not detect any changes
      in obsessive compulsive symptoms, mood, or anxiety levels, although we found a
      (nonsignificant) increase in plasma GH levels. CONCLUSIONS: Based upon these
      findings, no evidence was found for a specific role of the 5-HT1B/1D receptor in 
      OCD. It should be noted, however, that challenge studies in OCD are difficult to 
      perform. Perhaps in the future better challenge paradigms will make it possible
      to further explore the role of specific receptor types in OCD.

TI  - Tolerability and efficacy of naratriptan tablets in the acute treatment of
      migraine attacks for 1 year. Naratriptan Long-Term Study Group.
PG  - 470-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: This open-label study was conducted to evaluate the
      tolerability and efficacy of the 5HT1 agonist naratriptan with repeated use in
      the acute treatment of migraine attacks for 1 year. Four hundred and seventeen
      (417) migraine patients treated 15,301 migraine attacks over the course of the
      study. RESULTS: The results show that 84% of attacks treated with a single 2.5 mg
      dose of naratriptan were not associated with the occurrence of an adverse event. 
      The percentage of attacks associated with an adverse event did not increase with 
      number of doses used to treat a given attack (1 vs. 2) or duration of use (0-6
      months vs. > 6-12 months). The only adverse events experienced in > 2% of attacks
      throughout the 1-year study were nausea (3% of attacks), hyposalivation (2% of
      attacks), and drowsiness/sleepiness (2% of attacks). Headache relief 4 h
      post-dose was reported in a median 70% of moderate or severe attacks and a median
      86% of mild attacks treated with naratriptan tablets 2.5 mg. The percentages of
      patients reporting headache relief did not diminish as a function of increased
      duration of treatment (0-6 months vs. > 6-12 months) or frequency of use (for >
      36 vs. < 36 attacks). The mean number of tablets taken per attack was 1.2. A
      second naratriptan 2.5 mg tablet was taken for headache recurrence in a mean 16% 
      (median 8%) of attacks. CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrate that
      naratriptan tablets 2.5 mg taken for acute migraine attacks over a 1-year period 
      are well-tolerated and effective.

TI  - Induction of nitrate tolerance is not a useful treatment in cluster headache.
PG  - 445-54
AB  - The aims of the present study were to investigate whether induction of nitrate
      tolerance is a useful treatment in cluster headache and to correlate any changes 
      in attack frequency of cluster headache and nitrate-induced headache to the
      vascular adaptation during continuous nitrate administration. The results were
      compared to results obtained from studies of nitrate tolerance in healthy
      subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 5-isosorbide-mononitrate (5-ISMN) 30 mg was
      administered orally three times daily for 4 weeks in nine sufferers of chronic
      cluster headache in a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled cross-over
      design. Blood velocity in the middle cerebral artery was measured with
      transcranial Doppler and the diameters of the temporal and radial arteries were
      measured with high frequency ultrasound. The haemodynamic data were compared to
      changes in the frequency of cluster headache attacks and interval headaches over 
      time. RESULTS: Tolerance was complete within 24 h in the middle cerebral arteries
      and after 7 days in the symptomatic temporal artery, while tolerance of the
      radial artery was not observed within this period. The time profiles of tolerance
      were almost identical to the time profiles observed in healthy subjects. A close 
      temporal association between the disappearance of nitrate-induced headache and
      tolerance of the temporal artery was observed but tolerance had no effect on
      cluster headache attack frequency. CONCLUSIONS: Induction of tolerance to
      nitrates cannot be used to treat cluster headache. If pain is related to arterial
      dilatation the results point to extracerebral rather than cerebral arteries as
      the site of nociception. However, other peripheral and central pain-modulating
      effects of nitric oxide, the time courses of which are unknown, should also be
      taken into consideration.

TI  - Effects of subcutaneous sumatriptan on plasma growth hormone concentrations in
      migraine patients.
PG  - 223-7
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the sensitivity of 5-HT1D receptors in
      migraine using sumatriptan as a pharmacological probe. The drug stimulates the
      release of growth hormone (GH) and this effect may be used to explore the
      function of cerebral serotonergic systems in vivo. We administered sumatriptan
      and placebo to 15 migraineurs and to 10 controls. Blood samples were collected
      -15, 0, 15, 30, 45, 60 and 90 min after injection. Placebo had no effect on
      hormone concentrations. Sumatriptan induced a significant (P<0.01) increase in GH
      concentrations both in migraine patients and healthy controls. The GH increase
      was not significantly different in the two groups. Our results suggest that
      cerebral serotonergic functions mediated by 5-HT1D receptors are not altered in
      migraine. Sumatriptan overuse could lead to adverse effects mediated by its
      neuroendocrine activity.

TI  - Serotonergic targets in the treatment of antidepressant induced sexual
      dysfunction: a pilot study of granisetron and sumatriptan.
PG  - 291-5
AB  - Antidepressant induced sexual dysfunction is a common adverse event that is
      particularly evident with serotonergic antidepressants. There is a paucity of
      clinical trial evidence on the treatment of this problem. While there is some
      evidence of involvement of the serotonin (5-HT2) receptor subtype in this
      phenomenon, other serotonergic receptor systems are not well studied. In this
      trial, 35 patients on maintenance therapy with a variety of serotonergic
      antidepressants, who reported antidepressant induced sexual dysfunction, were
      enrolled. Patients were given both granisetron 1 mg, and sumatriptan 100 mg, in a
      crossover design, to be used 1 h before intercourse. Sexual dysfunction was
      measured using the Feiger scale. There was a high dropout rate in the trial,
      reflecting both embarrassment with the pharmacological treatment of sexual
      dysfunction and difficulties with planning and timing the medication.
      Nevertheless, there was a significant effect of granisetron in this study, with
      scores decreasing from 23.7 (SD 2.52) to 16.0 (SD 6.42) on the Feiger scale (n = 
      14, P = 0.001, Wilcoxon sign rank test). Sumatriptan failed to show a significant
      change from baseline at the 0.01 level of significance. While the small sample
      size, high dropout rates and open label design are limitations to this study, it 
      suggests efficacy of the granisetron in antidepressant induced sexual dysfunction
      and the role of the 5-HT3 receptor in this phenomenon.

TI  - Migraine: pharmacotherapy in the emergency department.
PG  - 189-93
AB  - Migraine can be a disabling condition for the sufferer. For the small number of
      patients for whom home therapy fails and who seek treatment in an emergency
      department, several therapeutic options are available. I review the evidence
      regarding the effectiveness and safety of the following therapies: the
      phenothiazines, lignocaine (lidocaine), ketorolac, the ergot alkaloids,
      metoclopramide hydrochloride, the "triptans," haloperidol, pethidine (meperidine 
      hydrochloride), and magnesium sulfate. Based on available evidence, the most
      effective agents seem to be prochlorperazine, chlorpromazine and sumatriptan,
      each of which has achieved greater than 70% efficacy in several studies.

TI  - Comparison of naratriptan and sumatriptan in recurrence-prone migraine patients. 
      Naratriptan International Recurrence Study Group.
PG  - 981-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This randomized, double-blind, crossover study was undertaken to
      compare the incidence of headache recurrence after treatment with naratriptan or 
      sumatriptan in migraine patients with a history of frequent headache recurrence
      (recurrence in > or =50% of successfully treated attacks). BACKGROUND: Although
      the selective 5-hydroxytryptamine, (5-HT1) agonist sumatriptan is effective and
      well tolerated for acute treatment of migraine in most patients, headache
      recurrence within 24 hours of initial successful treatment with sumatriptan and
      other medications has been reported in approximately 35% of patients. The novel
      5-HT1 agonist naratriptan possesses pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic
      characteristics that may address the issue of headache recurrence. METHODS: Men
      and women aged 18 to 65 years with a > or =1-year history of migraine with or
      without aura were randomly assigned to treat 1 moderate or severe migraine attack
      in a nonclinical setting with one 2.5-mg naratriptan tablet and 1 attack with one
      100-mg sumatriptan tablet. A pain-free interval of > or =24 hours was required
      between attacks. At 4 hours, patients not using rescue medication and
      experiencing headache recurrence could take a second, identical dose of study
      medication to treat recurrence. No more than 2 tablets of study medication were
      permitted in any 24-hour period. RESULTS: A total of 253 patients treated > or =1
      migrane attack and were included in the safety analysis; the 225 patients who
      treated both attacks were included in the efficacy analysis. Of the 164
      naratriptan-treated and 181 sumatriptan-treated patients experiencing headache
      relief after > or =1 attack, headache recurrence 4 to 24 hours after treatment
      was reported by 74 naratriptan-treated patients (45%) and 101 sumatriptan-treated
      patients (57%; not statistically significant). (One naratriptan- and 3
      sumatriptan-treated patients who experienced headache relief did not record
      recurrence status and were not included in the denominator for the percentage
      calculation.) In a subset of patients experiencing headache relief after 2
      attacks, headache recurrence 4 to 24 hours after initial dosing was reported by
      55 naratriptan- and 77 sumatriptan-treated patients (41% and 57%, respectively; P
      = 0.005). The overall incidence of adverse events was 22% after treatment with
      naratriptan and 33% after treatment with sumatriptan. This incidence did not
      increase after use of a second dose of naratriptan (20%) or sumatriptan (31%).
      CONCLUSION: These data suggest that naratriptan is a long-acting and
      well-tolerated addition to currently available medications for the treatment of
      acute migraine.

      to a double-blind placebo-controlled design, included 15 CH patients, six with
      episodic CH (mean +/- SD age of 36.8+/-5.6 years), and nine with chronic CH
      (37.8+/-10.4 years). Patients had undergone a standard NTG test (0.9 mg
      sublingually), during which the intensity of pain was scored using a
      visuoanalogic scale (VAS, range 0-10). Nine patients (two with the episodic form,
      seven with the chronic form) experienced a typical, spontaneous-like attack on
      the usual side, occurring in all cases within 45 min. In these patients, the test
      was repeated with an interval of 2 days, and once pain intensity reached 5 on the
      VAS, a 10% solution of cocaine hydrochloride (1 ml, mean amount per application
      40-50 mg), or 10% lidocaine (1 ml), or saline was applied using a cotton swab in 
      the area corresponding to the sphenopalatine fossa, under anterior rhinoscopy.
      This was done in both the symptomatic and the non-symptomatic side, for 5 min.
      Treatments were always performed randomly, in separate sessions. All patients
      responded promptly to both anaesthetic agents, with complete cessation of induced
      pain occurring after 31.3+/-13.1 min for cocaine and 37.0+/-7.8 min for lidocaine
      (M+/-SD). In the case of saline application, pain severity increased thereafter, 
      and extinction of the provoked attacks occurred with a latency of 59.3+/-12.3 min
      (P<0.01 and P<0.01 vs. cocaine and lidocaine, respectively, Mann-Whitney U-test).
      While further suggesting that the sphenopalatine ganglion participates in the
      mechanisms of pain, these findings indicate that the local administration of the 
      anaesthetic agents cocaine and lidocaine is effective on NTG-induced CH attacks, 
      and may be used in the symptomatic treatment of this disorder.

TI  - A clinical comparison of sumatriptan nasal spray and dihydroergotamine nasal
      spray in the acute treatment of migraine.
PG  - 281-6
AB  - A multinational, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, crossover
      study (368 patients treating two attacks) was conducted to compare the efficacy
      and tolerability of sumatriptan nasal spray (20 mg) with dihydroergotamine (DHE) 
      nasal spray (1 mg plus optional 1 mg). At the primary efficacy time point of 60
      minutes after dosing, significantly more patients obtained headache relief
      (change from moderate or severe to none or mild) after treatment with sumatriptan
      than with DHE (53% sumatriptan, 41% DHE, p < 0.001). Significantly more patients 
      reported relief of nausea after sumatriptan than after DHE at 60 minutes (64%
      sumatriptan, 49% DHE, p = 0.006). A significant difference between the two
      treatments was first observed at 45 minutes with respect to both headache relief 
      (38% sumatriptan, 31% DHE, p = 0.037) and relief of nausea (55% sumatriptan, 40% 
      DHE, p = 0.014). There were no significant differences between the two treatments
      for other measures of efficacy. Both treatments were well tolerated, with only
      10% of patients in each group reporting one or more adverse events. The most
      frequently reported adverse event after sumatriptan was a bad or bitter taste,
      which was reported by 5% of patients. After DHE, 4% of patients reported symptoms
      of the nasal cavity/sinuses and 3% reported nausea and/or vomiting as adverse
      events. It is concluded that sumatriptan nasal spray is superior to DHE nasal
      spray in the relief of pain and nausea associated with acute migraine headache.

TI  - Effectiveness of sumatriptan in reducing productivity loss due to migraine:
      results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.
PG  - 782-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of sumatriptan on migraine-related workplace
      productivity loss. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial, adult migraineurs self-injected 6 mg of
      sumatriptan or matching placebo to treat a moderate or severe migraine within the
      first 4 hours of a minimum of an 8-hour work shift. Outcome measures included
      productivity loss and number of patients returning to normal work performance 2
      hours after injection and across the work shift, time to return to normal work
      performance, and time to headache relief. RESULTS: A total of 206 patients
      underwent screening, 140 (safety population) of whom returned for clinic
      treatment. Of these 140 patients, 119 received migraine treatment in the
      workplace (intent-to-treat population), 116 of whom comprised the study
      population. Of these 116 patients, 76 self-administered sumatriptan, and 40
      self-administered placebo. Sumatriptan treatment tended to reduce median
      productivity loss 2 hours after injection compared with placebo (25.2 vs 29.9
      minutes, respectively; P = .14). Significant reductions in productivity loss were
      obtained across the work shift after sumatriptan treatment compared with placebo 
      (36.8 vs 72.6 minutes, respectively; P = .001). Significantly more
      sumatriptan-treated patients vs placebo-treated patients experienced shorter
      return to normal work performance at 2 hours (53/76 [70%] vs 12/40 [30%],
      respectively) and across the work shift (64/76 [84%] vs 23/40 [58%],
      respectively; P < .001). Significantly more sumatriptan-treated patients
      experienced headache relief 1 hour after injection compared with placebo-treated 
      patients (48/76 [63%] vs 13/40 [33%], respectively; P = .004). CONCLUSION: Across
      an 8-hour work shift, sumatriptan was superior to placebo in reducing
      productivity loss due to migraine.

      measure.
PG  - 550-60
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the longitudinal performance of the migraine-specific
      quality of life (MSQOL) instrument. METHODS: Psychometric tests evaluated data
      obtained from 1383 migraineurs who completed the 20-item MSQOL questionnaire
      during a noncomparative, long-term, observational study of zolmitriptan (Zomig), 
      5 mg, for the acute treatment of migraine attacks of any intensity. RESULTS:
      There was a relationship between a history of a high frequency of migraine
      attacks and low baseline MSQOL scores, indicating a lower quality of life.
      Principal components analyses confirmed three domains and an overall score.
      Cronbach alpha coefficients for the overall score (.93) indicated high internal
      consistency. Responsiveness analysis over 180 days of treatment indicated a
      significantly greater improvement in MSQOL scores (P <.05) in treatment
      responders compared with nonresponders. The average effect size (0.25) and Guyatt
      responsiveness statistic (0.46) for the MSQOL instrument exceeded those for the
      eight domains of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form Health Survey (MOS SF-36) 
      (-0.05 to 0.14 and 0.01 to 0.12, respectively). Change from baseline for
      responders in MSQOL total score was 4.7 to 5.4 compared with 1.1 to 2.7 for
      nonresponders. CONCLUSIONS: Cumulative evidence for the MSQOL instrument meets
      established criteria for validity, consistency, and reproducibility and shows
      moderate responsiveness to treatment. This instrument fulfils the need for an
      MSQOL measure to be used as an adjuvant measure in the assessment of long-term
      outcomes of therapy.

TI  - Comparative tolerability of oral 5-HT1B/1D agonists.
PG  - 521-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the relative tolerability of 5-HT1B/1D agonists and to
      investigate the relationships (if any) among systemic exposure, lipophilicity,
      and clinical tolerability for 5-HT1B/1D agonists. METHODS: Post hoc correlations 
      were sought among the following variables: absolute dose (= administered dose x
      oral bioavailability), Cmax, LogDpH7.4 (LogD), frequencies of all, neurological
      and dizziness/somnolence/drowsiness adverse events, adjusted for corresponding
      placebo-associated frequencies. RESULTS: For effective doses of all drugs with
      available data, absolute dose-response relationships exist for adverse event
      frequencies. The overall rank order of the frequency of adverse events was as
      follows: naratriptan < sumatriptan = rizatriptan < zolmitriptan. With the
      exception of eletriptan, 5-HT1B/1D agonists exhibit correlations between absolute
      dose, Cmax (R = 0.97), and LogD (R = 0. 71). For neurological and
      dizziness/somnolence/drowsiness adverse event frequencies, the overall rank order
      was sumatriptan < naratriptan < rizatriptan < zolmitriptan. Neither LogD nor
      absolute dose size predicted adverse event frequencies. CONCLUSIONS: Triptans may
      be distinguished in terms of their tolerability. Effectiveness, absolute dose
      size, and lipophilicity are related for the 5-HT1B/1D agonists considered here,
      except eletriptan. Adverse event frequencies cannot be predicted from in vitro
      measures of lipophilicity, in vivo estimates of absolute bioavailability, dose
      size, or any combination of these variables. Since these drugs are all agonists
      at 5-HT1B/1D receptors in the low nanomolar range, but differ in their
      tolerability profiles, adverse effects are not likely to be mediated through
      5-HT1B/1D receptors. Drugs of this class must be studied individually and on a
      reasonably large scale in clinical development programs.

TI  - Naratriptan efficacy in migraineurs who respond poorly to oral sumatriptan.
PG  - 513-20
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine whether 347 patients would respond to a 50-mg oral dose 
      of sumatriptan, even though they considered themselves poor responders to this
      acute therapy for migraine, and to investigate whether oral naratriptan can be an
      effective acute therapy for migraine in the subset of patients who did not
      respond to sumatriptan under double-blind, well-controlled conditions.
      BACKGROUND: Although most migraineurs respond to sumatriptan, there remains a
      need for an effective alternative for those who do not respond. Naratriptan is a 
      more potent and more lipophilic member of this class of agent and could prove
      beneficial in such patients. This is the first well-controlled study to assess
      the value of another 5-HT1B/1D agonist in this difficult patient subset. METHODS:
      This study comprised two migraine attacks. The first (attack 1) was a
      single-blind assessment of the efficacy of sumatriptan (50 mg orally) in patients
      with a history of poor response to the drug. The second (attack 2) was a
      randomized, parallel group, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of naratriptan
      (2.5 mg orally) in nonresponders to oral sumatriptan. RESULTS: Attack 1: About
      two thirds of this selected migraine population did not respond to sumatriptan.
      Attack 2: Naratriptan was statistically superior to placebo for headache relief
      at 2 hours and 4 hours, as well as for most other features of migraine attacks.
      These data suggest an intrinsic efficacy of naratriptan in this patient subset
      and not a coincidental response. No unexpected tolerability issues arose.
      CONCLUSIONS: Naratriptan is an alternative therapy for migraineurs who respond
      poorly to oral sumatriptan. No response to one "triptan" does not necessarily
      predict no response to them all.

TI  - Pharmacological and behavioral treatment of pediatric migraine and tension-type
      headache.
PG  - 59-64
AB  - The problem concerning the treatment of pediatric headache has been the object of
      several recent reports. Some of the same medications used to treat adult headache
      problems are also utilized with children but usually at smaller dosages and in
      different combinations. The recent application of behavioral approaches, in
      particular biofeedback, for treatment of children's headaches has been an
      effective alternative to drugs without the problematic and dangerous side effects
      of pharmacological treatments. The purpose of this review is to give some
      indications about the most common pharmacological therapies for migraine and
      tension-type headache in children, and also to discuss the use of behavioral
      therapies, in particular biofeedback, as excellent alternatives to drugs.

TI  - Evaluation of migraineurs' preferences for naratriptan over conventional
      first-line agents.
PG  - 753-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess patient satisfaction with and preference for naratriptan
      hydrochloride therapy over previous "nontriptan" therapy for migraines. DESIGN
      AND SETTING: Open-label study conducted at 15 primary care clinics. PATIENTS: One
      hundred forty-three adults meeting International Headache Society diagnostic
      criteria for migraine who were not using triptans as first-line therapy for
      migraines were enrolled; 115 completed the study. INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME
      ASSESSMENTS: At baseline, satisfaction with current migraine therapy was
      assessed. Patients were provided with naratriptan hydrochloride, 2.5 mg, to treat
      3 migraines and diaries to record headache symptoms and response to treatment.
      After treating 3 migraines, satisfaction with naratriptan therapy and preference 
      for either previous or naratriptan therapy were assessed. RESULTS: Eighty-nine
      (62%) of 143 patients had previous exposure to triptans, with lack of prescribing
      (55%) as the primary reason for not continuing their use as first-line therapy.
      Medications used for first-line therapy included simple analgesics (59%),
      combination products (46%), and narcotics (13%). After treating 3 migraines with 
      naratriptan, satisfaction with migraine therapy increased from 47% to 75%.
      Sixty-three percent of patients preferred naratriptan therapy over their previous
      nontriptan therapy, 27% preferred their previous therapy, and 10% had no
      preference. The main reasons for preference for naratriptan therapy were
      "relieves pain effectively" (86%) and "restores ability to function/perform task"
      (81%). CONCLUSION: Naratriptan for first-line migraine therapy was preferred by
      most patients over previous nontriptan therapy.

TI  - Naproxen sodium decreases migraine recurrence when administered with sumatriptan.
PG  - 428-30
AB  - Forty to 78% of the patients using sumatriptan for the acute treatment of
      migraine may present recurrence at least occasionally. The concomitant use of a
      NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) has been recommended to decrease the 
      recurrence rate. Sixty seven patients that treated successfully 8 migraine
      attacks with 100 mg of sumatritpan PO and presented recurrence in at least 5
      attacks were studied prospectively. The patients received 100 mg of sumatriptan
      and 550 mg of naproxen sodium PO to treat 4 consecutive moderate or severe
      migraine attacks. The recurrence rate, once at least 62.5% (5 out of 8 attacks), 
      decreased to 14.2% (38 out of 268 attacks) with the combination of compounds
      (p<0.0001). We then studied two groups of 13 patients made randomicaly from the
      67 initially evaluated, that were given sumatriptan 100 mg plus naproxen sodium
      550 mg or placebo, in a double-blind design, to treat 3 other consecutive
      migraine attacks. Each group of patients treated 39 attacks. The recurrence among
      the patients taking sumatriptan plus placebo was 59% (23 out of 39 attacks) and
      the recurrence presented by the group taking sumatriptan plus naproxen was 25.5% 
      (10 out of 39 attacks) (p<0.0003). We concluded that the combination of
      sumatriptan plus naproxen sodium decreases significantly migraine recurrence
      presented by patients taking sumatriptan alone.

TI  - Rizatriptan in the treatment of menstrual migraine.
PG  - 237-42
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of oral rizatriptan 10 mg and 5 mg for
      treating menstrually associated migraine attacks. METHODS: Data from two large
      clinical trials with identical designs were included in a retrospective analysis.
      The studies were randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, incomplete block,
      two-period, crossover designs. Women with migraines were randomly assigned to one
      of five treatment sequences for the treatment of two migraine attacks. Only data 
      from the first attack in women with migraines who were treated with rizatriptan
      or placebo were included in the analysis. A menstrually associated attack was
      defined as one that occurred within 3 days before or after the onset of the last 
      menstrual period. RESULTS: In the subgroup of 335 women with menstrually
      associated migraine, rizatriptan was effective compared with placebo. At 2 hours 
      after dosing, 68% of 139 women taking rizatriptan 10 mg and 70% of 115 women
      taking rizatriptan 5 mg with a menstrually associated migraine had pain relief
      compared with 44% of 81 patients taking placebo (P <.05). In all women,
      rizatriptan was as effective in treating menstrual as well as nonmenstrual
      migraine: 68% of 139 patients taking rizatriptan 10 mg with a menstrually
      associated migraine had pain relief at 2 hours after dosing compared with 69% of 
      393 patients with nonmenstrually associated attacks (test of menstrual
      association = nonsignificant; the analysis had 80% power to detect a difference
      of six percentage points between groups). Similar results were found for
      rizatriptan 5 mg (menstrual = 70%, nonmenstrual = 66%; not statistically
      significant). CONCLUSION: Rizatriptan is effective in the treatment of
      menstrually associated migraine attacks.

TI  - Zolmitriptan reverses blink reflex changes induced during the migraine attack in 
      humans.
PG  - 57-60
AB  - The question about the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(1B-1D) receptors agonists, if
      the clinical efficacy in migraine attacks is linked with the action at the
      central level or at the peripheral one, is still unresolved. We evaluated the
      effects of zolmitriptan and sumatriptan on blink reflex in thirty migraine
      without aura patients during the attacks in order to assess the central action on
      the trigeminal system. Both drugs were effective in reducing headache severity
      compared to placebo. In the migraine attack an increased area of the R3 component
      on the pain side was observed; it was suppressed by zolmitriptan, which confirmed
      its action on the central trigeminal circuits, though the clinical relevance of
      this effect could be questioned.

TI  - Effect of naratriptan on myocardial blood flow and coronary vasodilator reserve
      in migraineurs.
PG  - 95-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Migraine drugs can produce adverse cardiac effects. The authors have 
      demonstrated previously that ergotamine can lead to a significant reduction of
      hyperemic myocardial blood flow, but little is known about the effect of the
      newer serotonin analogues. Coronary artery constriction caused by serotonin or
      its analogues is mediated mainly by 5HT2 receptors. The selective 5HT1B/1D
      agonist naratriptan has no significant activity at 5HT2 receptors; however, like 
      all 5HT1B/1D agonists developed for the acute treatment of migraine, naratriptan 
      could potentially constrict coronary arteries by activation of 5HT1B receptors.
      METHODS: The effects on myocardial blood flow of subcutaneous naratriptan 1.5 mg 
      compared with placebo were assessed under resting and hyperemic conditions with
      PET using oxygen-15 labeled water during two separate visits. This study was a
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 34 migraine
      subjects with no evidence of ischemic heart disease, studied outside a migraine
      attack. RESULTS: Naratriptan did not differ significantly from placebo in its
      effects on resting myocardial blood flow, but did evoke a small, significant fall
      in hyperemic myocardial blood flow (-13% versus placebo) and an increase in
      hyperemic coronary resistance (+19% versus placebo) without any signs or symptoms
      suggestive of myocardial ischemia. Naratriptan did not significantly affect the
      coronary vasodilator reserve (hyperemic/resting blood flow) compared with
      placebo. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that at therapeutic doses, naratriptan
      exerts only a minor effect on myocardial blood flow, coronary vasodilator
      reserve, or coronary resistance among subjects with no evidence of ischemic heart
      disease. These results should not be extrapolated to patients with coronary
      artery disease, in whom all 5HT1 agonists for migraine are contraindicated.

TI  - Autoantibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase in patients with therapy-resistant 
      epilepsy.
PG  - 46-50
AB  - BACKGROUND: Autoantibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD-A) are present in 
      type 1 diabetes and stiff man syndrome (SMS), and have also been reported in
      cerebellar ataxia. Epilepsy was present in 4 of 19 patients with SMS and GAD-A,
      implying that epilepsy sometimes is associated with anti-GAD autoimmunity.
      METHODS: The authors investigated the prevalence of GAD-A in patients with
      therapy-resistant localization-related epilepsy (n = 51) and generalized epilepsy
      (n = 49) by a radiobinding assay. The positive samples were confirmed by
      immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting of recombinant human GAD65. RESULTS:
      GAD-A were found in eight patients with localization-related epilepsy, whereas
      none of the patients with generalized epilepsy, other neurologic disorders (n =
      38), or the control subjects (n = 48) had GAD-A. Two patients had high levels of 
      GAD-A, similar to SMS, whereas six patients had significantly lower titers,
      characteristic of type 1 diabetes. The two patients with high levels of GAD-A had
      GAD-A both in serum and CSF by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. Both of
      them had longstanding therapy-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy but did not have
      diabetes. One had a history of autoimmune disease, whereas the other had
      serologic evidence of multiple autoantibodies without any clinical signs of
      autoimmune disease. CONCLUSIONS: GAD autoimmunity may be associated with
      refractory localization-related epilepsy.

TI  - Rizatriptan in the treatment of migraine.
PG  - 1823-36; discussion 1821
AB  - Rizatriptan is a selective 5-hydroxytriptamine1B/1D receptor agonist that was
      launched in 1998 for the acute treatment of migraine in adults. Based on data
      from 6 large clinical trials in patients > or =18 years of age in whom migraine
      was diagnosed according to International Headache Society criteria, the marketed 
      10-mg and 5-mg oral doses of rizatriptan are effective in relieving headache pain
      and associated migraine symptoms. The 10-mg dose is more effective than the 5-mg 
      dose. At 2 hours after dosing, up to 77% of patients taking rizatriptan 10 mg had
      pain relief compared with 37% of those taking placebo, up to 44% were completely 
      pain free compared with 7% of those taking placebo, and up to 77% were free of
      nausea compared with 58% of those taking placebo (P < 0.05 for all 3
      comparisons). Both doses of rizatriptan are generally well tolerated. In
      placebo-controlled studies involving treatment of a single migraine attack, the
      most common side effects (incidence > or =2%) occurred in <10% of patients,
      typically were transitory (2 to 3 hours), and were mild or moderate. Rizatriptan 
      is an effective and well-tolerated acute treatment for migraine.

TI  - Sleep disordered breathing in patients with cluster headache.
PG  - 2302-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study subjects with active or inactive cluster headache (CH) for
      occult sleep disordered breathing (SDB). BACKGROUND: CH frequently occurs during 
      sleep. The authors previously found that symptoms of SDB predicted reported
      occurrence of CH in the first half of the night, which suggested that CH could be
      triggered in some cases by unrecognized SDB. METHODS: The authors performed
      polysomnography in 25 adults (22 men) with CH. Subjects were not selected for any
      sleep-related complaint. In addition to standard measures, studies included
      monitoring of end-tidal carbon dioxide (n = 22), and esophageal pressure (n =
      20). RESULTS: The rate of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep was >5 in 20
      subjects (80%; 95% CI, 64% to 96%), minimum oxygen saturation was <90% in 10
      subjects, maximum negative esophageal pressure ranged from -13 to -65 cm H2O, and
      maximum end-tidal carbon dioxide was > or =50 mm Hg in eight subjects. The eight 
      subjects with active (versus inactive) CH at the time of study had higher maximum
      end-tidal carbon dioxide levels (50 +/- 3 versus 44 +/- 5 mm Hg; p = 0.0007).
      More severe oxygen desaturation was associated with reports that CH typically
      occurred in the first half of the nocturnal sleep period (p = 0.008).
      CONCLUSIONS: SDB occurred in the majority of patients with CH. Evaluation of a
      patient with CH should include consideration that SDB may be present.

TI  - The pharmacology of headache.
PG  - 509-25
AB  - Headache is a common problem which besets most of us at some time or the other.
      The pharmacology of headache is complex in an overall sense but can be understood
      in terms of the anatomy and physiology of the pain-producing structures. Migraine
      can be used as a template to understand the activation of nociceptive systems in 
      the head and thus their neurotransmitter mediation and modulation. In recent
      years, the role of serotonin (5-HT) in headache pharmacology has been unravelled 
      in the context of both understanding its role in the nociceptive systems related 
      to headache and by exploiting its 5-HT1 receptor subtypes in headache
      therapeutics. The pharmacology of the head pain systems, as they are known and as
      they might evolve, are explored in the context of both, the anatomy and
      physiology of trigeminovascular nociception and in the context of clinical
      questions, such as those of efficacy, headache recurrence and adverse events.

TI  - Treatment of nonresponders to oral sumatriptan with zolmitriptan and rizatriptan:
      a comparative open trial.
PG  - 464-5
AB  - In order to study the effect of zolmitriptan and rizatriptan in oral sumatriptan 
      nonresponders (defined as lack of response in three or more of five attacks), 56 
      patients were studied in an open trial in a crossover fashion. Both zolmitriptan,
      5 mg, and rizatriptan, 10 mg, were effective in the majority of sumatriptan
      nonresponders. The response to rizatriptan, 10 mg, appeared to be better than to 
      zolmitriptan, 5 mg. Approximately 19% of sumatriptan nonresponders remained
      nonresponders to both zolmitriptan and rizatriptan.

PG  - 371-2
AB  - After taking both conventional oral rizatriptan tablets and oral disintegrating
      rizatriptan tablets in the treatment of migraine with or without aura, patients
      were permitted to select their formulation preference. All adult patients who had
      requested continuation of rizatriptan during a 6-month period were included in
      the study. Of the 367 patients studied, 188 selected the oral disintegrating
      tablet, while 179 preferred the conventional tablet. Although individual patients
      had strong preferences for one preparation over the other, no group preference
      was found.

TI  - Zolmitriptan: new product. Similar to sumatriptan.
PG  - 41-3
AB  - (1) Zolmitriptan is an antimigraine drug similar to sumatriptan. (2) The clinical
      file mainly comprises placebo-controlled dose-finding studies recommending an
      optimal oral dose of 2.5 mg. (3) Zolmitriptan has been compared with sumatriptan 
      in a trial that showed no difference in efficacy. In particular, the recurrence
      rate of headache after initial relief was not lower on zolmitriptan than on
      sumatriptan. (4) The safety profile of zolmitriptan is similar to that of
      sumatriptan. The contraindications relating to a history of cardiovascular
      disease must be respected because of the vasoconstrictive effect of the drug. (5)
      Zolmitriptan has the same drug interactions as sumatriptan. Moreover,
      zolmitriptan should not be used during migraine attacks by patients on
      propranolol.

TI  - Low dose zolmitriptan as a 5-HT neuroendocrine challenge agent in humans.
PG  - 607-18
AB  - The 5-HT1B/D agonist sumatriptan has been used in a number of studies as a
      neuroendocrine challenge agent. Whether its neuroendocrine effects are centrally 
      mediated is unclear, however, since sumatriptan shows minimal penetration of the 
      central nervous system. Zolmitriptan shows a greater penetration into the central
      nervous system than sumatriptan, and has recently been shown to be an effective
      challenge agent. In order to determine the neuroendocrine, temperature and side
      effects of a 2.5 mg oral dose of zolmitriptan, 17 healthy volunteers underwent a 
      placebo controlled, repeated measures, double blind neuroendocrine challenge.
      Zolmitriptan or placebo were administered, and cortisol, growth hormone,
      prolactin, blood pressure and temperature, were measured over four hours after
      the dose of zolmitriptan. Zolmitriptan at this dose was well tolerated by all
      subjects, with minimal side effects and only minor effects on blood pressure.
      There was a significant increase in serum growth hormone after zolmitriptan
      compared to placebo, however there were no significant effects on cortisol,
      prolactin or oral temperature. The neuroendocrine effects of 2.5 mg of orally
      administered zolmitriptan are similar to previously reported effects of
      sumatriptan, with minimal side effects.

TI  - Are the triptans for migraine therapy worth the cost?
PG  - 111-5
AB  - The triptans represent a major advance in migraine therapy but their cost per
      dose greatly exceeds that of many older treatments. There is evidence that for a 
      significant proportion of migraine patients these new drugs can show a positive
      cost benefit and also improve quality of life. Cost benefit would be expected to 
      be greatest in patients with more severe migraine attacks.

TI  - Effects of the anti-migraine drug sumatriptan on muscle energy metabolism:
      relationship to side-effects.
PG  - 39-44
AB  - Sumatriptan succinate (Imitrex) is a 5-HT (5-hydroxytryptamine) agonist used for 
      relief of migraine symptoms. Some individuals experience short-lived
      side-effects, including heaviness of the limbs, chest heaviness and muscle aches 
      and pains. The effects of this drug on skeletal muscle energy metabolism were
      studied during short submaximal isometric exercises. We studied ATP flux from
      anaerobic glycolysis (An Gly), the creatine kinase reaction (CK) and oxidative
      phosphorylation (Ox Phos) using 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P 
      MRS) kinetic data collected during exercise. It was found that side-effects
      induced acutely by injection of 6 mg sumatriptan succinate s.c. were associated
      with reduced oxygen storage in peripheral skeletal muscle 5-20 min after
      injection as demonstrated by a transient reduction in mitochondrial function at
      end-exercise. These results suggest that mild vasoconstriction in peripheral
      skeletal muscle is associated with the action of sumatriptan and is likely to be 
      the source of the side-effects experienced by some users. Migraine with aura
      patients were more susceptible to this effect than migraine without aura
      patients.

TI  - Sumatriptan reduces exercise capacity in healthy males: a peripheral effect of
      5-hydroxytryptamine agonism?
PG  - 643-8
AB  - 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin) has been implicated in the perception of
      exercise-induced fatigue. Sumatriptan is a selective 5-HT(1B/D) receptor agonist 
      which does not cross the blood-brain barrier. The aim of the present study was to
      determine the effect of sumatriptan on exercise capacity. Ten healthy male
      subjects (mean age 28.4+/-10.8 years) performed a maximal treadmill exercise test
      according to the Bruce protocol with expired gas analysis on two occasions.
      Either 6 mg of sumatriptan or placebo was administered subcutaneously in a
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design. Exercise time
      was greater after placebo compared with sumatriptan [914 and 879 s respectively; 
      95% confidence interval (CI) of difference 12.1 s, 59.1 s; P = 0.008]. There was 
      no significant effect on peak oxygen consumption (placebo, 50.6+/-6.3
      ml.min(-1).kg(-1); sumatriptan, 51.7+/-7.6 ml.min(-1).kg(-1)). Sumatriptan
      administration resulted in decreases in both heart rate (sumatriptan, 188+/-14
      beats/min, placebo, 196+/-12 beats/min; 95% CI of difference 12.6, 2.6; P =
      0.008) and respiratory exchange ratio (sumatriptan, 1.23+/-0.06; placebo,
      1.26+/-0.07; 95% CI of difference 0.05, 0.01; P = 0.01) at peak exercise. There
      were no significant differences in blood pressure, heart rate or submaximal
      oxygen consumption between sumatriptan and placebo treatments at any stage of
      exercise. Thus sumatriptan reduces maximal exercise capacity in normal males. The
      failure to demonstrate any haemodynamic or cardiorespiratory effect suggests that
      sumatriptan enhances perception of fatigue by a peripheral mechanism affecting
      5-HT modulation.

TI  - Increased growth hormone response to sumatriptan challenge in adult autistic
      disorders.
PG  - 173-7
AB  - Serotonergic (5-HT) abnormalities have been documented in autism. To assess
      sensitivity of the 5-HT1d receptor, growth hormone response to the 5-HT1d
      receptor agonist sumatriptan was studied in adult autistic patients and matched
      normal controls. In this study, 11 adult patients with autism or Asperger's
      disorder were compared with nine matched controls. All subjects were randomized
      to single dose sumatriptan (6 mg SQ) and placebo challenges, separated by a
      1-week interval, and growth hormone was measured before and during the
      challenges. The results showed a highly significant diagnosisxdrugxtime
      interaction on repeated measure analysis covaried for baseline. This suggests
      that autistic patients had significantly greater growth hormone response to
      sumatriptan than normal controls, independent of placebo effects. Therefore,
      abnormalities in 5-HT regulation in autism may be related to increased
      sensitivity of the 5-HT1d inhibitory receptor in autism.

TI  - Oral zolmitriptan is effective in the acute treatment of cluster headache.
PG  - 1832-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of oral zolmitriptan 5 mg
      and 10 mg and placebo in cluster headache. METHODS: A multicenter, double-blind, 
      randomized, three-period, crossover, outpatient study. Adult patients received
      placebo and zolmitriptan 5 mg and 10 mg orally for the acute treatment of
      episodic or chronic cluster headache. Headache intensity was rated by a
      five-point scale: none, mild, moderate, severe, or very severe. Patients only
      treated moderate to very severe headaches. The primary efficacy measure was
      headache response (two-point or greater reduction from baseline in the cluster
      headache rating scale) at 30 minutes. Secondary efficacy measures included
      proportion of patients with initial headache relief within 15 and 30 minutes,
      mild or no pain at 30 minutes, meaningful headache relief, and use of escape
      medication. RESULTS: A total of 124 patients took at least one dose of study
      medication, with 73% having episodic and 27% chronic cluster headache. For the
      primary endpoint, there was a treatment-by-cluster-headache-type interaction (p =
      0.0453). Therefore, results are presented separately for chronic and episodic
      cluster headache. In patients with episodic cluster headache, the difference
      between zolmitriptan 10 mg and placebo at 30 minutes reached significance (47%
      versus 29%; p = 0.02). Mild or no pain at 30 minutes was reported by 60%, 57%,
      and 42% patients treated with zolmitriptan 10 mg, zolmitriptan 5 mg, and placebo 
      (both p </= 0.01 versus placebo). For all other secondary endpoints, zolmitriptan
      10 mg was significantly superior to placebo in episodic cluster headache
      patients, whereas zolmitriptan 5 mg was significantly superior to placebo for
      three of the four secondary endpoints. In patients with chronic cluster headache,
      response rates following zolmitriptan 5 mg or 10 mg were not significantly
      different from placebo at any endpoint. Zolmitriptan 5 mg and 10 mg were well
      tolerated. CONCLUSION: Oral zolmitriptan is efficacious in episodic cluster
      headache.

TI  - Placebo effect in the acute treatment of migraine: subcutaneous placebos are
      better than oral placebos.
PG  - 183-8
AB  - We carried out a meta-analysis of 22 trials to determine the comparative placebo 
      effect of (a) subcutaneous vs. oral and (b) in-hospital vs. at-home
      administration in the treatment of migraine. The headache relief rates were
      combined from the placebo arms of these randomised clinical trials assessing the 
      value of sumatriptan in acute treatment of migraine. The main outcome measure was
      the proportion of patients reclassified from severe or moderate headache severity
      to no or mild headache severity 2 h after the beginning of treatment. In the oral
      regimen 222 of 865 patients (25.7%) reported no or mild headache severity after 2
      h, compared to 279 of 862 patients (32.4%) of those receiving subcutaneous
      placebo (6.7% difference; 95% CI 2.4-11.0%). Adjusting for treatment setting and 
      severity of headache at baseline did not change the observed difference. After
      placebo treatment at home 285 of 1,054 patients (27.0%) reported no or mild
      headache severity after 2 h, compared to 216 of 673 patients (32.1%) among those 
      receiving placebo in hospital (5.1 % difference; 95% CI 0.6-9.5%). When adjusted 
      for route of administration and severity of headache at baseline, the difference 
      in relief rates between home and hospital setting disappeared. These findings
      indicate that subcutaneous administration enhances the placebo effect of acute
      treatment of migraine. Future trials of antimigraine drugs assessing the relative
      efficacy of various routes of administration should use a double-dummy technique.
      The interpreting of placebo-controlled trial results must therefore consider that
      the effect in the drug arm of the trial depends in part on the route of
      administration.

TI  - Sumatriptan in patients with postdural puncture headache.
PG  - 316-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of sumatriptan in the management of patients
      presenting for an epidural blood patch for the management of postdural puncture
      headache. BACKGROUND: Postdural puncture headache can be quite severe, requiring 
      invasive therapy (ie, epidural blood patch). Sumatriptan has been used
      successfully in patients with postdural puncture headache, however, its use has
      not been investigated in a controlled fashion. METHODS: Ten patients with
      postdural puncture headache presenting for an epidural blood patch were given
      either saline or sumatriptan subcutaneously. The severity of the headache was
      evaluated at baseline and 1 hour following injection. If the headache remained
      severe, an epidural blood patch was performed. RESULTS: Only one patient in each 
      group received relief from the injection. CONCLUSIONS: We do not recommend
      sumatriptan in patients who have exhausted conservative management of postdural
      puncture headache.

PG  - 1382-5
AB  - The authors performed a double-blind, double-dummy study to compare the efficacy 
      of verapamil with placebo in the prophylaxis of episodic cluster headache. After 
      5 days' run-in, 15 patients received verapamil (120 mg tid) and 15 received
      placebo (tid) for 14 days. The authors found a significant reduction in attack
      frequency and abortive agents consumption in the verapamil group. Side effects
      were mild. These findings provide objective evidence for the effectiveness of
      verapamil in episodic cluster headache prophylaxis.

TI  - Influence of sumatriptan on gastric fundus tone and on the perception of gastric 
      distension in man.
PG  - 468-73
AB  - BACKGROUND: In animals, activation of 5-HT(1) like receptors causes a relaxation 
      of the gastric fundus through the activation of intrinsic inhibitory neurones.
      AIMS: To investigate the effect of sumatriptan, an agonist at enteric neuronal
      5-HT(1) receptors, on fasting fundus tone and sensitivity to gastric distension
      in man. METHODS: A gastric barostat was used to study the effect of placebo and
      sumatriptan, 6 mg subcutaneously, on basal fundic tone in healthy subjects. In
      addition, stepwise isobaric and isovolumetric gastric distensions were performed 
      and perception was measured before and after the administration of placebo and
      sumatriptan. RESULTS: Placebo had no significant effects on gastric tone and on
      perception. Sumatriptan induced an immediate relaxation of the gastric fundus,
      reflected by an intragastric volume increase of 209 (39) ml (p<0.0005). After
      sumatriptan, intragastric pressures at the thresholds for perception or
      discomfort were not significantly altered. However, the intragastric volumes and 
      the corresponding calculated wall tensions at perception and discomfort
      thresholds were significantly increased. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of the
      5-HT(1) receptor agonist sumatriptan induces a relaxation of the gastric fundus
      in man, allowing larger intragastric volumes before thresholds for perception or 
      discomfort are reached. The effects of sumatriptan on the gastric fundus may have
      therapeutic potential in the treatment of patients with functional dyspepsia.

TI  - A double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of the effect of oral doses of
      rizatriptan 10 mg on oral contraceptive pharmacokinetics in healthy female
      volunteers.
PG  - 309-15
AB  - Rizatriptan (MAXALT), a potent, oral 5-HT1B/1D agonist with a rapid onset of
      action, is available now for the acute treatment of migraine. This study examined
      the pharmacokinetic and clinical interaction between rizatriptan 10 mg and the
      components (ethinyl estradiol [EE] 35 micrograms and norethindrone [NET] 1.0 mg) 
      of a well-established oral contraceptive combination product, ORTHO-NOVUM 1/35.
      Levels of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), a protein increased by EE to which
      NET binds, were also examined. In this two-period crossover study, 20 healthy
      young female subjects received a coadministration of 8 days of rizatriptan
      treatment (6 days of single-dose 10 mg rizatriptan and 2 days of multiple-dose
      rizatriptan, 10 mg q 4 hours for three doses, giving a total daily dose of 30 mg 
      on Days 7 and 8) or matching placebo along with their daily dose (one tablet) of 
      ORTHO-NOVUM 1/35 within their oral contraceptive cycle. Plasma was sampled for
      EE, NET, and SHBG concentrations. Safety evaluations included routine laboratory 
      safety studies, physical examinations, and monitoring for ECG, vital signs, and
      adverse events. There were no statistically significant differences in any of the
      pharmacokinetic parameters of EE or NET between the rizatriptan and placebo
      treatment periods, thus indicating that rizatriptan had no meaningful effect on
      the disposition of either the EE or the NET component of ORTHO-NOVUM 1/35. The
      SHBG concentration did not change throughout the entire study. Clinically,
      coadministration of rizatriptan with ORTHO-NOVUM 1/35 was well tolerated. Blood
      pressure, heart rate, and temperature showed no consistent trend or clinically
      important changes. Adverse events following coadministration of rizatriptan with 
      ORTHO-NOVUM 1/35 were similar to those reported when placebo was given with
      ORTHO-NOVUM 1/35. The findings of this study indicate that there is little
      potential for dosages as high as 30 mg/day, the maximum recommended dosing
      schedule, of rizatriptan to alter the plasma concentrations of oral
      contraceptives.

TI  - A dose-defining study of sumatriptan suppositories in the acute treatment of
      migraine.
PG  - 593-8
AB  - In this dose-ranging, randomised, multinational, multicentre, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, parallel group study, 431 patients treated a single migraine 
      attack with study medication: sumatriptan suppository 6 mg, 12.5 mg, 25 mg, 50
      mg, 100 mg, or placebo. Patients were treated in the clinic with a single dose in
      suppository form. All doses of sumatriptan, except 6 mg, were significantly
      better than placebo (p < 0.004) and achieved similar rates of headache relief
      within two hours of dosing. The highest response rate was in the 25 mg group
      (72%) compared with placebo (37%) (p < 0.001). Fewer patients required rescue
      medication in the active groups (1% 100 mg to 13% 6 mg) compared with placebo
      (17%), and more patients were able to work and function normally two hours after 
      dosing (41%, 100 mg; 20%, placebo). The overall incidence of adverse events was
      similar in the placebo, 6 mg and 12.5 mg groups (14-17%) but higher in the 25 mg,
      50 mg and 100 mg groups (25%, 32% and 29% respectively). Analysis of plasma
      sumatriptan levels indicated rapid rectal absorption for all doses (median tmax =
      1.0 hr). It is concluded that sumatriptan, in doses above 6 mg, is an effective
      and well tolerated treatment for acute migraine. From this study doses of 12.5 mg
      and 25 mg sumatriptan were identified as having the best efficacy/safety profile 
      and were evaluated further.

      Group.
PG  - 25-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dosing recommendations for oral sumatriptan as acute treatment for
      migraine have ranged from 25 mg to 100 mg. Patient dose preferences have not been
      studied in a setting mimicking clinical practice. METHODS: In an open-label study
      evaluating patient acceptance and the relative efficacy and safety of 25 mg, 50
      mg, and 100 mg doses of oral sumatriptan over a period of six months, 338
      patients treated three migraine attacks with 50 mg sumatriptan and then were
      allowed to double or halve the dose. After treating another three attacks, they
      were again allowed to adjust the dose by one level. RESULTS: After migraine
      attack 3, 37% of patients chose to continue with the 50 mg dose, 50% increased
      the dose to 100 mg, and 12% decreased it to 25 mg. After attack 6, 8%, 33%, and
      58% of patients chose the 25 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg doses, respectively; only 3%
      of those taking the 100 mg dose chose to reduce it. Overall, the mean percentages
      of attacks per patient in which headache relief had been obtained 4 h after
      dosing were 71%, 71%, and 80% for the 25 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg doses,
      respectively. Patients who decreased the dose to 25 mg after attack 3 experienced
      decreases both in adverse events and percentage of attacks with headache relief, 
      whereas in those who increased the dose to 100 mg, likelihood of headache relief 
      increased but the incidence of adverse events did not. CONCLUSIONS: More patients
      chose the 50 mg or 100 mg dose than the 25 mg dose. All three doses had similar
      efficacy and tolerability.

TI  - Patient preference for oral sumatriptan 25 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg in the acute
      treatment of migraine: a double-blind, randomized, crossover study. Sumatriptan
      Tablets S2CM11 Study Group.
PG  - 16-24
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dosing recommendations for oral sumatriptan have ranged from 25 mg to
      100 mg. Patient dose preferences are clinically relevant (perhaps moreso than
      traditional efficacy endpoints) and deserve study. METHODS: A multinational
      randomized double-blind crossover study was conducted over 18 weeks to assess
      patient dose preference, efficacy, and tolerability for oral sumatriptan (25 mg, 
      50 mg, and 100 mg) in the acute treatment of migraine; 257 patients treated three
      attacks, using a different dose for each. RESULTS: The 100 mg dose was preferred 
      by 35% of patients, 31% the 50 mg dose, and 25% the 25 mg dose. Efficacy and
      speed of action were the two main reasons given for preferring the higher doses. 
      Compared with the 25 mg dose, the 100 mg and 50 mg doses were significantly more 
      likely to provide headache relief at 2, 3, and 4 h after dosing and complete
      headache resolution at 3 and 4 h after dosing (P < 0.027). Recurrence rates were 
      similar for the three doses, ranging from 33% to 38%, though the median time to
      recurrence increased with dose, from 8.5 to 11.8 h. The 25 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg 
      doses were all well tolerated, with adverse event incidences of 19%, 21%, and
      30%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Patients preferred the 50 mg and 100 mg doses of 
      oral sumatriptan to the 25 mg dose, and the higher doses were more effective
      against migraine; however, the 25 mg and 50 mg doses were better tolerated than
      the 100 mg dose. Though the 50 mg dose probably has the best
      effectiveness-to-tolerability ratio, some patients clearly prefer a higher dose.

      of 50 mg sumatriptan tablets in the acute treatment of migraine. Sumatriptan
      Tablets S2CM07 Study Group.
PG  - 7-15
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oral sumatriptan 50 mg has been found to have good efficacy and
      tolerability in the acute treatment of migraine but has been less well studied
      than the 100 mg dose. METHODS: This was a double-blind, parallel-group study
      (Glaxo Wellcome protocol number S2CM07) comparing the efficacy and safety of
      sumatriptan 50 mg tablets with placebo in the acute treatment of migraine.
      Patients treated three migraine attacks with study medication; a second, optional
      dose was available for treating recurrent headache. Of the 560 patients
      randomized, 485 treated at least one attack, 411 at least two attacks, and 362
      three attacks. The primary efficacy measure was the proportion of patients who
      had obtained complete or almost complete headache relief at 4 h after dosing.
      RESULTS: For all attacks, a significantly greater proportion of patients
      experienced headache relief at 4 h with sumatriptan 50 mg tablets than with
      placebo (59% to 62% versus 32% to 42%; P = 0.005). The same was true at 3 h
      across all attacks, and at 2 h for attacks 1 and 2 (49% versus 23% and 45% versus
      29%, respectively). Although sumatriptan and placebo were associated with similar
      incidences of recurrence, sumatriptan was associated with a longer time to
      recurrence. The incidence of adverse events with sumatriptan was similar to that 
      with placebo, and there was no increase in adverse events associated with use of 
      a second dose to treat recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Sumatriptan 50 mg tablets are
      well tolerated and efficacious in relieving migraine headache.

      migraine.
PG  - 2-6
AB  - Oral sumatriptan, which is a well tolerated, effective acute treatment for
      migraine, and is selectively available in different countries in 100 mg, 50 mg,
      and 25 mg tablets. The first large dose-ranging study compared the 100 mg dose to
      higher doses (200 mg and 300 mg) and found it to be just as efficacious and
      better tolerated. The first studies comparing the 100 mg dose to lower doses (25 
      mg and 50 mg) found them all to be similar in effectiveness and tolerability.
      However, a larger definitive study found that the 100 mg and 50 mg doses offered 
      better efficacy than the 25 mg dose, whereas the 25 mg and 50 mg doses were
      better tolerated than the 100 mg dose. Thus the 50 mg dose appears to offer the
      best ratio of efficacy to tolerability. Many patients, though, prefer or require 
      the 100 mg dose and tolerate it well. Allowed to select dosing themselves,
      patients tend to migrate to the 100 mg dose.

PG  - 363-8; discussion 368-70
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the long-term effectiveness and safety of percutaneous
      retrogasserian glycerol rhizolysis (PRGR) in the treatment of medically
      refractive chronic cluster headache (CH). The current mainstay of surgical
      intervention for these patients is percutaneous radiofrequency retrogasserian
      rhizotomy (PRFR). However, when performed for V1 distribution pathology, PRFR can
      lead to corneal anesthesia, which places the patient at risk for future visual
      loss. It also increases the risk of facial dysesthesia. METHODS: In a
      prospective, consecutive series, 18 patients with intractable CH were followed
      for a mean of 5.2 years (range, 40-78 mo) after they had undergone PRGR,
      performed using a standard technique. The significance of this technique as an
      alternative to PRFR is that it should result in a lower rate of both corneal and 
      facial anesthesia and provide an acceptable degree of pain relief. RESULTS:
      Fifteen patients (83%) obtained immediate pain relief after one or two
      injections; the majority of them experienced relief after the first injection. CH
      recurred in seven patients (39%) over the course of the study. Two of these
      patients received a second injection, and both met with equal success. Two other 
      patients underwent PRFR. Excluding those who underwent PRFR, the overall daily
      headache frequency decreased from 3.5 +/- 0.3 attacks per day preoperatively to
      0.6 +/- 0.2 attacks per day at last follow-up. The severity of these headaches,
      as assessed by verbal pain scales, also decreased from 10 preoperatively to 4.4
      +/- 1.4 at follow-up. None of the patients, including those who required a second
      procedure, experienced corneal anesthesia or facial dysesthesia. CONCLUSION: This
      study provides the first long-term evaluation of PRGR for the treatment of
      medically refractive chronic CH and lends support to both the safety and
      long-term efficacy of this procedure. Further investigations are needed to
      compare directly the relative efficacy and safety of PRGR and PRFR.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of sumatriptan 50 mg in patients not responding to standard
      care, in the treatment of mild to moderate migraine. The Sumatriptan 50 mg
      Italian Study Group.
PG  - 57-64
AB  - The tolerability and efficacy of oral sumatriptan 50 mg for the treatment of mild
      to moderate migraine attacks were assessed in a double-blind, multicenter
      placebo-controlled study on a group of patients who had not responded
      sufficiently to analgesic preparations. Three-hundred-and-twenty-eight migraine
      sufferers treated a first migraine attack with a nontriptan standard care
      medication: a mixture containing phenazone, butalbital and caffeine (optalidon)
      or indomethacin plus prochlorperazine plus caffeine (difmetre) or paracetamol 100
      mg (tachipirine), depending on their habits. Of these patients, 32.6% reported
      headache relief with this treatment and were not included in phase II of the
      study. The 219 patients not reporting relief during the first phase of the study 
      entered the second phase and were randomized to sumatriptan 50 mg or to placebo; 
      167 of these patients treated a second attack according to the protocol and were 
      evaluated for efficacy. Of the patients with migraine taking sumatriptan, 58%
      reported headache relief compared with 35% of placebo-treated patients (p =
      0.008). The reduction of nausea and vomiting was significantly better in the
      sumatriptan group. No differences were detected for the recurrence rate, while
      rescue medication was used more by the placebo group. The safety profile of
      sumatriptan 50 mg was confirmed. This study demonstrates the usefulness of this
      dose of oral sumatriptan against the pain and the accompanying symptoms of mild
      and moderate migraine.

TI  - Influence of a 5HT1 receptor agonist on gastric accommodation and initial
      transpyloric flow in healthy subjects.
PG  - 95-101
AB  - Sumatriptan, a 5HT1 receptor agonist, inhibits antral motor activity, delays
      gastric emptying and relaxes the gastric fundus. The aim of this study was to
      characterize the effect of sumatriptan on transpyloric flow and gastric
      accommodation during and immediately after ingestion of a liquid meal using
      duplex sonography. Ten healthy subjects were investigated twice on separate days.
      In random order either sumatriptan 6 mg (Imigran 0.5 mL) or a placebo were given 
      s.c. 15 min before ingesting 500 mL of a meat soup. The subjects were examined
      during the 3-min period before ingestion of the liquid meal, the 3-min spent
      drinking the meal and 10 min postprandially. Sumatriptan caused a significant
      widening of both the gastric antrum (P=0.02) and the proximal stomach (P=0.01) 10
      min postprandially as compared with placebo. It caused no significant differences
      in time to initial gastric emptying (P=0.2), but significantly delayed
      commencement of peristaltic-related transpyloric flow (P=0.04). Sumatriptan had
      no significant effect on mean abdominal symptom scores, but after sumatriptan
      there was a significant negative correlation between width of postprandial antral
      area and postprandial nausea and between width of postprandial antral area and
      postprandial bloating. We therefore conclude that sumatriptan causes a
      postprandial dilatation of both the distal and the proximal stomach with no
      change in dyspeptic symptoms nor in length of time to first gastric emptying.
      Time to commencement of peristaltic-related emptying is delayed.

TI  - The relationship between repetitive behaviors and growth hormone response to
      sumatriptan challenge in adult autistic disorder.
PG  - 163-7
AB  - Autism is heterogeneous with respect to clinical symptoms and etiology. To sort
      out this heterogeneity in autism, we investigated whether specific
      neurobiological markers vary in parallel to core symptomatology. Specifically, we
      assessed growth hormone response to the 5-HT 1d agonist, sumatriptan, and linked 
      this measure of serotonergic function to the severity of repetitive behaviors in 
      adult autistic patients. Eleven adult patients with autism or Asperger's disorder
      were randomized to single dose sumatriptan (6 mg SQ) and placebo challenges,
      separated by a one-week interval. In adult autistic disorders, severity of
      repetitive behaviors at baseline, as measured by YBOCS-compulsion score,
      significantly positively correlated with both peak delta growth hormone response 
      and area under the curve growth hormone response to sumatriptan. Thus, the
      severity of a specific behavioral dimension in autism (repetitive behaviors)
      parallels the sensitivity of the 5-HT 1d receptor, as manifest by sumatriptan
      elicited GH response.

TI  - Lack of pharmacokinetic interaction between sumatriptan and naproxen.
PG  - 99-104
AB  - Sumatriptan is a 5HT1D agonist used in the treatment of migraine. Nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs, beta-blockers, and calcium channel-blocking antagonists 
      are used in the prophylaxis of migraine. Hence, there is a need to investigate
      the interaction of these prophylactic drugs with sumatriptan. The interaction of 
      sumatriptan with propranolol, flunarizine, pizotifen, and butorphanol were
      reported earlier. Naproxen is shown to be effective in prophylactic treatment of 
      migraine. In this study, the authors have investigated the circadian rhythm
      effect of naproxen on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan at 1000 and 2200 hours.
      Twelve healthy volunteers were treated with 100 mg sumatriptan succinate either
      alone or along with 500 mg naproxen orally at either 1000 or 2200 hours in a
      randomized Latin square design with a washout period of 10 days. Serum samples
      were collected at predetermined time intervals and analyzed for unchanged
      sumatriptan by high-performance liquid chromatography. The pharmacokinetic
      parameters were calculated by using model-independent methods. Naproxen had no
      statistically significant (p > 0.05) effect on any pharmacokinetic parameters of 
      sumatriptan both at 1000 and 2200 hours treatment. The results of this study
      suggest that no alteration in the sumatriptan dosage will be necessary for
      migraine patients taking naproxen prophylactic therapy.

TI  - Rizatriptan, a novel 5-HT1B/1D agonist for migraine: single- and multiple-dose
      tolerability and pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects.
PG  - 74-83
AB  - Rizatriptan is a novel 5-HT1D/1B agonist for relief of migraine headache. The
      pharmacokinetics, metabolite profiles, and tolerability of rizatriptan were
      examined in a multiple-dose study in healthy subjects. Rizatriptan (N = 24) (or
      placebo, N = 12) was administered as a single 10 mg dose, followed 48 hours later
      by administration of one 10 mg dose every 2 hours for three doses on 4
      consecutive days, corresponding to the maximum daily dose for a migraine attack. 
      The AUC of rizatriptan and its active N-monodesmethyl metabolite after three 10
      mg doses was approximately threefold greater than the plasma concentrations
      following a single 10 mg dose. Metabolite profiles were similar after single and 
      multiple doses. Adverse events during rizatriptan were mild and transient;
      similar events occurred during placebo, with a somewhat reduced incidence.
      Diastolic blood pressure tended to increase compared with placebo (approximately 
      5 mmHg), particularly on the first multiple-dose day (p < .01 vs. placebo). In
      conclusion, rizatriptan is well tolerated by healthy subjects during
      multiple-dose administration, with no unexpected accumulation of drug in plasma.

TI  - Single photon emission computed tomography of the brain with Tc-99m HMPAO during 
      sumatriptan challenge in obsessive-compulsive disorder: investigating the
      functional role of the serotonin auto-receptor.
PG  - 1079-99
AB  - 1. Symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) may be acutely exacerbated by 
      administration of certain serotonin agonists Exacerbation of OCD symptoms by
      sumatriptan, a 5HT1D agonist (Zohar, 1993), is consistent with pre-clinical data 
      suggesting that the serotonin auto-receptor plays an important role in this
      disorder (El Mansari et al, 1995). 2. In order to investigate the functional role
      of the serotonin auto-receptor in OCD, the authors undertook single photon
      emission computed tomography in OCD patients after administration of sumatriptan 
      and placebo. The authors hypothesized that, as in the case of
      m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) challenge (Hollander et al, 1995), exacerbation
      of OCD symptoms would be accompanied by increased cortical metabolism and thus
      blood flow, and more specifically by increased activity in the
      orbitofrontal-striatal circuit. They also expected, that as in the case of mCPP
      challenge (Hollander et al, 1993), exacerbation of OCD symptoms would be
      associated with a relatively poor response to subsequent treatment with serotonin
      specific reuptake inhibitors. 3. Sumatriptan (100 mg orally) and placebo were
      administered on separate days to 14 patients who met DSM-IV diagnostic criteria
      for OCD, using a randomized double-blind design. After 90 minutes, patients were 
      injected with Tc-99m HMPAO and underwent single photon emission computed
      tomography (SPECT) of the brain. Activity in regions of interest was calculated, 
      and compared using repeated measures analysis of variance. Patients were
      subsequently treated with a serotonin specific reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). 4.
      Behavioral response to sumatriptan was heterogenous, with 4 patients showing
      acute exacerbation, and 4 patients demonstrating a decrease in symptoms. On
      sumatriptan challenge, there was a significant association between symptom
      exacerbation and decreased activity in frontal areas. There was an association
      between decreased activity in an inferior frontal area with worse response to
      treatment, and also patients with symptom exacerbation after sumatriptan had
      poorer response to SSRI treatment. 5. Heterogeneity of behavioral response to
      sumatriptan in OCD is consistent with previous studies demonstrating conflicting 
      and heterogenous behavioral responses to serotonergic challenges (Hollander et
      al, 1992), and with underlying heterogeneity in the neurobiology of this
      disorder. 6. It may be hypothesized that increased frontal activity in some
      patients with OCD is itself a compensatory mechanism. In patients with such
      compensatory hyperactivity, administration of a serotonin auto-receptor agonist
      results in decreased frontal activity and exacerbation of OCD symptoms. These
      patients may also be less likely to respond to treatment with a SSRI. 7. Further 
      work combining pharmacological challenge paradigms and functional imaging
      techniques in OCD may be helpful in elucidating the neurobiology of this complex 
      disorder.

TI  - Sumatriptan nasal spray in the acute treatment of migraine: a review of clinical 
      studies.
PG  - 769-78
AB  - Sumatriptan nasal spray is a single-dose device that delivers 5 mg, 10 mg, or 20 
      mg of sumatriptan (dosage availability dependent upon country) in a 0.1 ml
      aqueous solution to one nostril. The efficacy and tolerability of sumatriptan
      nasal spray have been assessed in a number of studies. It has been demonstrated
      that administering sumatriptan as a divided dose in both nostrils confers no
      advantage over administration in a single nostril. It appears from these studies 
      that sumatriptan nasal spray is rapidly effective (with an onset of efficacy as
      early as 15 min postdose). The 20 mg dose is superior to the lower doses (5 mg,
      10 mg) in terms of both time to onset of efficacy and the extent of migraine
      symptom relief. Sumatriptan nasal spray is consistently effective in the
      treatment of multiple migraine attacks (with 67% of patients treated with the 20 
      mg dose responding in at least two of three treated attacks) and with long-term
      use for up to 1 year. Apart from a bitter taste, the adverse event profile of
      sumatriptan nasal spray is comparable to that of placebo.

TI  - Effect of sumatriptan, a 5HT1 agonist, on the frequency of transient lower
      esophageal sphincter relaxations and gastroesophageal reflux in healthy subjects.
PG  - 3158-64
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Meals increase the rate of transient lower esophageal sphincter (LES) 
      relaxations, in part by gastric distension. The 5HT1 agonist sumatriptan reduces 
      fasting fundic tone, prolongs the meal-induced fundic relaxation, and delays
      gastric emptying. We therefore hypothesized that sumatriptan might have a
      significant effect on the rate of postprandial transient LES relaxations and
      gastroesophageal reflux. We aimed to study the effect of sumatriptan on
      postprandial transient LES relaxations and reflux in healthy subjects. METHODS:
      Esophageal manometry and pH monitoring were performed in 13 healthy volunteers
      for 30 min before and 90 min after a semiliquid meal (790 kcal). Sumatriptan 6 mg
      subcutaneous (s.c.) or s.c. placebo were administered on separate days 30 min
      after the meal. RESULTS: Sumatriptan significantly increased postprandial LES
      pressure from 11.0 +/- 1.2 mm Hg to 17.6 +/- 1.2 mm Hg (p < 0.05). However,
      reflux events were not diminished. In the contrary, reflux was more frequent
      after sumatriptan than after placebo (3 [1.5-4.5]/30 min vs 2 [0-3]/30 min, p <
      0.05). Transient LES relaxations were more frequent after sumatriptan,
      particularly in the second 30-min period after drug administration (3 [2.5-5]/30 
      min vs 2 [1.5-2]/30 min, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Sumatriptan prevents the natural
      decay in rate of transient LES relaxations that occurs after a meal and favors
      the occurrence of gastroesophageal reflux despite increasing LES pressure. The
      sustained postprandial high rate of transient LES relaxations after sumatriptan
      may be a consequence of a prolonged fundus relaxation and retention of meal in
      the proximal stomach.

TI  - Rizatriptan: a review of its efficacy in the management of migraine.
PG  - 699-723
AB  - Rizatriptan is an orally active serotonin 5-HT1 receptor agonist selective for
      the 5-HT(1B/1D) subtypes. The efficacy of oral rizatriptan (5 or 10 mg) has been 
      demonstrated in large (n = 309 to 1746) well designed comparative trials with
      placebo and oral sumatriptan. Two hours postdose, rizatriptan 5 or 10 mg was more
      effective than placebo at producing pain relief or a pain free status, relieving 
      migraine-associated symptoms and normalising functional ability. In general,
      rizatriptan 10 mg appeared to be more effective than rizatriptan 5 mg. However,
      recurrence rates with rizatriptan 5 and 10 mg appeared to be similar to those
      with placebo. Patients were significantly more likely to achieve pain relief
      within 2 hours after receiving rizatriptan 5 mg than sumatriptan 25 mg and after 
      rizatriptan 10 mg than sumatriptan 50 mg. This was also observed with rizatriptan
      10 mg compared with sumatriptan 100 mg according to an age-adjusted and a
      prespecified per-protocol analysis. In general, rizatriptan was better than
      sumatriptan at relieving migraine-associated symptoms, particularly nausea, and
      in normalising functional ability depending on which doses were compared. The
      incidence of headache recurrence, time to onset of recurrence and the need for
      escape medication in nonresponders appeared to be similar between rizatriptan and
      sumatriptan. Over the 24 hours after the dose, rizatriptan 10 mg improved the
      quality of life of patients with migraine compared with placebo. Rizatriptan 10
      mg also significantly improved work function compared with placebo and with
      sumatriptan 50 mg. Rizatriptan appears to be well tolerated with most adverse
      events being mild and transient. The most commonly experienced events included
      general digestive complaints, general neurological complaints, dizziness,
      somnolence, asthenia/fatigue and pain and pressure sensations. In clinical
      trials, the overall incidence of adverse events with rizatriptan 5 or 10 mg was
      similar to that with sumatriptan 25 or 50 mg but lower than that with sumatriptan
      100 mg. Chest pain was reported by 1 to 3% of rizatriptan recipients and by 3 to 
      6% of patients receiving sumatriptan (25, 50 or 100 mg); clinically significant
      effects on ECG parameters, heart rate or blood pressure were not observed with
      rizatriptan. Conclusions: Rizatriptan produces pain relief and a pain free
      status, relieves associated symptoms of migraine, normalises functional ability
      and improves patient quality of life. Rizatriptan 10 mg appears to be more
      effective than rizatriptan 5 mg. In comparison with oral sumatriptan, rizatriptan
      may provide better relief from pain and nausea, with some evidence of a faster
      onset of action. Thus, rizatriptan 5 or 10 mg is likely to establish a place as
      an effective and well tolerated agent for the management of acute migraine.

TI  - Open-labeled long-term study of the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of
      subcutaneous sumatriptan in acute migraine treatment.
PG  - 676-83; discussion 626
AB  - In a multicenter study, a long-term analysis was made of the efficacy, safety,
      and tolerability of subcutaneous (s.c.) sumatriptan in the acute treatment of
      migraine attacks over a period of up to 18 months. A total of 2263 patients took 
      part in the study, all able to perform their own acute treatment of migraine
      attacks at home by s.c. administration of 6 mg of sumatriptan. A headache diary
      was used by each patient to record the various migraine parameters before the
      injection and 1 h and 2 h after it. A total of 43,691 attacks were treated and
      analyzed during the study period from October 1991 to June 1993. Therapy was
      successful in 89.5% of attacks. Freedom from headache was achieved in 71.0% of
      cases. In 22.7% of the attacks a second injection was administered on recurrence 
      of the headache; 82.9% of the patients achieved an intraindividual therapy
      success rate ranging from over 80% to 100%. In the course of treatment there was 
      no change in either the therapy success rate or in the frequency of attacks. Some
      4.9% of the patients withdrew from the study because of insufficient efficacy or 
      adverse events. A total of 44.5% of patients reported adverse events, and these
      were rated serious in the case of 1.7%. S.c. administration of sumatriptan for
      acute migraine therapy is an effective treatment method, with reliable action,
      that can be used with good tolerability provided the contraindications are taken 
      into account.

TI  - Migraine polypharmacy and the tolerability of sumatriptan: a large-scale,
      prospective study.
PG  - 668-75
AB  - Polypharmacy (the prescription of more than one therapy for a single patient) and
      subcutaneous (s.c.) sumatriptan tolerability were prospectively studied in 12,339
      migraineurs, each followed for up to 1 year. Inclusion/exclusion criteria were
      minimal and mirrored United States Imitrex labeling. Drug usage and compliance
      monitoring were automatically interfaced with prescription refill. Concomitant
      drugs were used by 79% of patients, with analgesics, antidepressants, and
      sedatives used most commonly. No adverse interactions between sumatriptan and
      neurological drugs were found, possibly reflecting relative inability of the
      former to cross the blood-brain barrier. No difference in cardiovascular adverse 
      events was associated with oral contraceptive use, which was more common than
      expected. No other drug class influenced adverse event probability, although
      sample sizes for these comparisons was sometimes <400 patients. This study
      confirms the prevalence of polypharmacy in migraine, identifies the drugs used,
      and concludes that, on a population basis, the tolerability of s.c. sumatriptan, 
      when used according to labeled instructions, is unaffected by these concomitant
      drugs.

TI  - Changes in systolic time intervals-a non-invasive marker for the haemodynamic
      effects of sumatriptan.
PG  - 331-5
AB  - AIMS: This study assessed the use of systolic time intervals (STI) as a potential
      non-invasive marker of the haemodynamic effects of sumatriptan, a 5HT1 receptor
      agonist. METHODS: Twenty-six patients undergoing diagnostic cardiac
      catheterization participated. STIs were derived from haemodynamic pressure
      tracings at baseline, following placebo injection and following either
      subcutaneous (n=18) or intravenous injection (n=8) of sumatriptan. RESULTS:
      Sumatriptan (i.v. or s.c.) was associated with significant increases in mean
      arterial pressure (95% C.I. 9,14mmHg, P=0.0001), total electromechanical systole 
      (95% C.I.8,36ms, P<0.0001), pre-ejection period (95%C.I. 8,21ms, P=0.0001) and
      left ventricular ejection time (95% C.I. 2,12ms, P=0.004). Conclusion STI
      responses were consistent with sumatriptan-induced changes in afterload. In
      summary, the measurement of STIs is a potential non-invasive method of
      investigating the influence of serotonergic compounds on the cardiovascular
      system.

TI  - Vasoneuronal coupling in migraineurs after subcutaneous sumatriptan: a TCD study.
PG  - 50-5
AB  - According to the trigeminovascular model of pain in migraine, sterile neurogenic 
      inflammation of dural vessels stimulates nociceptive fibres of the trigeminal
      nerve. Sumatriptan, a 5-HT1 receptor agonist, blocks this reaction and mediates
      vasoconstriction of meningeal arteries. However, it is uncertain, whether
      sumatriptan also has a vasoconstrictive effect on cerebral arteries, which may
      influence vasoneuronal coupling and induce secondary cerebral blood flow changes.
      We studied changes of cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) and the pulsatility
      index (PI) in the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) after stimulus activation
      before, 10 min and 30 min after subcutaneous application of 6 mg sumatriptan, in 
      order to assess potential vasoactive effects on cerebral circulation. CBFV was
      recorded from both PCAs simultaneously in 27 migraineurs (twenty women, seven
      men, mean age 29 years), and arterial blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and
      respiration rate (RR) were monitored. Although the mean diastolic blood pressure 
      rose significantly from 75 mm Hg to 81 mm Hg (P<0.05) and systolic blood pressure
      and respiration rates remained constant, average CBFV values remained constant.
      Similarly, the relative increase of CBFV by visual stimulation, which is clearly 
      higher compared to controls in other studies (55.0% before, 52.6% after 10 min,
      and 52.4% after 30 min), and absolute mean values for CBFV and PI did not change 
      after visual stimulation. These results provide evidence against the hypothesis
      that sumatriptan produces vasoconstriction in the intracranial human arterial
      circulation as a potential risk of cerebral ischemia.

TI  - Zolmitriptan: a review of its use in migraine.
PG  - 347-74
AB  - Zolmitriptan is a selective serotonin 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist ('triptan'). Its
      efficacy and tolerability have been assessed in a number of randomised,
      placebo-controlled, double-blind trials in large numbers of adults with moderate 
      to severe migraine attacks. Oral zolmitriptan 2.5 and 5mg has a rapid onset of
      action (significant headache relief is observed at 45 minutes) and efficacy is
      sustained in most patients who respond at 2 hours. The drug is significantly more
      effective than placebo as measured by a number of parameters including 2-hour
      headache response rates and pain-free response rates. Other symptoms of migraine,
      including nausea, photophobia and phonophobia are also alleviated with
      zolmitriptan. Zolmitriptan is effective in the treatment of migraine associated
      with menses and migraine with aura. There is some evidence to support the use of 
      zolmitriptan in patients with migraine who have had a poor response to previous
      therapy. The efficacy of zolmitriptan appears to be maintained, with no
      tachyphylaxis, following repeated administration for multiple attacks of migraine
      over a prolonged period of time, with high headache response rates reported over 
      all attacks. In comparison with placebo, the incidence of persistent migraine
      headache is reduced by zolmitriptan and recurrent migraine headache occurs less
      frequently with the active treatment. Zolmitriptan has also demonstrated efficacy
      in the treatment of persistent and/or recurrent migraine headache. For relief of 
      migraine headache, zolmitriptan 5mg had similar efficacy to sumatriptan 100mg for
      a single attack, but generally was more effective than sumatriptan 25 and 50mg
      for multiple attacks, in single trials. The incidence of recurrent headache with 
      zolmitriptan was similar to that with sumatriptan. Zolmitriptan is generally well
      tolerated with most adverse events being mild to moderate, transient and
      resolving without intervention or the need for treatment withdrawal. The most
      common adverse events with zolmitriptan therapy are asthenia, heaviness other
      than that of the chest or neck, dry mouth, nausea, dizziness, somnolence,
      paraesthesia, warm sensation, tightness, vasodilation and chest pain. CONCLUSION:
      Zolmitriptan is effective across a wide range of migraine subtypes, maintains
      efficacy when used in the long term and is generally well tolerated. Further
      clinical experience is necessary to define the position of zolmitriptan among
      other currently or soon to be available selective 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonists.
      However, on the basis of available data, zolmitriptan should emerge as a useful
      treatment option in the management of patients with moderate to severe migraine.

TI  - Symptomatic pharmacotherapy of migraine.
PG  - 1118-30
AB  - This review summarizes data on the effectiveness of various symptomatic migraine 
      pharmacotherapies and makes recommendations for treatment. A wide variety of
      agents are available for the symptomatic treatment of migraine headache,
      including over-the-counter analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
      (NSAIDs), combination products, opiates, ergot alkaloids, corticosteroids,
      dopamine antagonists, and triptans. In the stepped-care approach, simple
      analgesics and NSAIDs are the recommended first step for the treatment of
      mild-to-moderate migraine headaches. Patients who do not respond to first-step
      treatments may be given ergots, combination products, dopamine antagonists, or
      triptans as the second step. Corticosteroids or opiates may be used as rescue
      treatment in patients who do not respond to second-step treatment. A stratified
      approach to care individualizes treatment based on the severity of the headache
      and other patient-specific factors. In a stratified approach, dihydroergotamine
      or triptans may be the first-step treatment for patients who present with a
      history of severe migraines that have responded poorly to previous treatments.
      Sumatriptan was the first triptan approved for the symptomatic treatment of
      migraine headache; newer triptans include zolmitriptan, naratriptan, and
      rizatriptan. Since sumatriptan is rapidly absorbed by the subcutaneous route, its
      time to onset of effect is shortest. Among triptan drugs that are administered
      orally, the relative time to onset may be shorter with rizatriptan than
      sumatriptan. Naratriptan has a longer time to onset but is associated with a
      lower rate of migraine recurrence than other triptans. graine headache, ergot
      alkaloids, triptans,

TI  - Zolmitriptan-induced growth hormone release in humans: mediation by 5-HT1D
      receptors?
PG  - 223-6
AB  - RATIONALE: Effective neuroendocrine probes of 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptor function
      may facilitate investigation of the role of these receptor subtypes in the
      pathophysiology of depression and the mode of action of antidepressant
      medication. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the neuroendocrine profile of the 5-HT1B/1D
      receptor agonist, zolmitriptan, in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Twelve subjects
      entered a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design study of
      zolmitriptan (5 mg orally). Blood samples were taken at 15-min intervals for
      assay of prolactin and growth hormone. A further six healthy men were recruited
      to an equivalent study to examine the effect of ketanserin (a 5-HT receptor
      antagonist with some preference for 5-HT1D over 5-HT1B receptors) on the growth
      hormone response to zolmitriptan. RESULTS: Zolmitriptan significantly increased
      plasma growth hormone but had no effect on plasma prolactin or oral temperature. 
      The increase in growth hormone produced by zolmitriptan was significantly
      attenuated by ketanserin. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that the ability of triptans
      such as zolmitriptan, sumatriptan and rizatriptan to increase plasma growth
      hormone is mediated by their common agonist activity at postsynaptic 5-HT1D
      receptors.

TI  - Migraine: a comprehensive review of new treatment options.
PG  - 957-73
AB  - Headaches are among the most common complaints reported to health care
      professionals and are classified by the International Headache Society as
      migraine, tension-type, or cluster, with additional subtypes. Classification and 
      etiology of headache should be determined after thorough review of the patient's 
      history. Once diagnosed, migraine can be treated by preventive or abortive
      measures. Recent developments add new options, including availability of drugs
      for intranasal administration (sumatriptan, dihydroergotamine) and 5-HT1B/1D
      agonists (rizatriptan, zolmitriptan, naratriptan, eletriptan). Although
      placebo-controlled trials are available, few comparative clinical trials of these
      agents have been conducted; however, important pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic,
      and clinical differences exist among the drugs.

      subcutaneous sumatriptan and parenteral placebo in the acute treatment of
      migraine. A double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, multicenter, parallel group
      study. The ASASUMAMIG Study Group.
PG  - 581-8; discussion 542
AB  - Two-hundred-and-seventy-eight patients with acute migraine attacks with or
      without aura were treated in 17 centers with 1.8 g lysine acetylsalicylate i.v.
      (Aspisol; = 1 g acetylsalicylic acid), 6 mg sumatriptan s.c. or placebo using a
      double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, multicenter parallel group study design. 
      Two-hundred-and-seventy-five of them fulfilled the criteria for efficacy
      analysis, corresponding to 119 patients treated with lysine acetylsalicylate
      (L-ASA), 114 with sumatriptan and 42 with placebo injections. Both treatments
      were highly effective compared to placebo (p < 0.0001) in decreasing headache
      from severe or moderate to mild or none (verbal rating scale, VRS, placebo =
      23.8%). Sumatriptan showed a significantly (p = 0.001) better response (91.2%)
      compared to L-ASA (response 73.9%). Of the patients in the L-ASA-group, 43.7%
      were pain-free after 2 h; 76.3% after sumatriptan and 14.3% after placebo. It
      took patients on average 12.6 (L-ASA), 8.2 (sumatriptan), and 19.4 h (placebo) to
      be able to work again. There was no significant difference between treatment
      groups in recurrence of headache in responders within 24 h (18.2% L-ASA, 23.1%
      sumatriptan, 20% placebo). Accompanying symptoms (nausea, vomiting; photophobia, 
      phonophobia, and visual disturbances) improved with both verum treatments to a
      similar extent. L-ASA was significantly better tolerated than sumatriptan
      (adverse events L-ASA 7.6%, sumatriptan 37.8%). In conclusion, subcutaneous
      sumatriptan and lysine acetylsalicylate i.v. are effective treatments for
      patients suffering from migraine attacks. Sumatriptan is more effective, but
      resulted in more adverse events.

TI  - Sumatriptan and ergotamine overuse and drug-induced headache: a
      clinicoepidemiologic study.
PG  - 201-6
AB  - Drug-induced headache, particularly ergotamine-induced headache, is a common
      problem in migraine treatment. Some case reports suggest that even the new
      serotonergic antimigraine drugs such as sumatriptan can lead to overuse and
      subsequent drug-induced headache. We performed a controlled study to identify the
      rate of sumatriptan overuse and sumatriptan-induced headache and compared it to
      the rate of ergotamine overuse and ergotamine-induced headache. Two thousand
      sixty-five consecutive heachache patients, all experienced in intake of
      sumatriptan (n = 631) or ergotamine (n = 620), were enrolled over a three-year
      study period. The rates of overuse and drug-induced headache and the clinical
      features of the subgroups were compared. Risk factors for sumatriptan overuse
      were identified. The rates of ergotamine and sumatriptan overuse were 14.2% and
      3.5%, respectively (p < 0.001). Drug-induced headache could be found more
      frequently in cases of ergotamine overuse than in cases of sumatriptan overuse
      (68% versus 32%; p < 0.01). Development of sumatriptan overuse was most common in
      patients with previous drug-induced headache (68%), combined headache as the
      primary headache type (45%), and subcutaneous application of sumatriptan (45%).
      We conclude that sumatriptan intake can lead to overuse and subsequent
      drug-induced headache. The risk for overuse and drug-induced headache is
      significantly lower than in patients with ergotamine intake. This might be caused
      in part by the relatively short period of sumatriptan availability on the market.
      The new generation of serotonin-1B/D-receptor agonists in the treatment of
      headache should have a potential for overuse similar to that of traditional
      headache drugs.

PG  - 85-95
AB  - The efficacy of 5-hydroxytryptamine 1B/1D (5-HT 1B/1D) agonists is related to
      their inhibitory effects on neurogenic inflammation, mediated through
      serotoninergic control mechanisms. Recently, a series of oral second generation
      5-HT 1B/1D agonists (eletriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan and zolmitriptan) have 
      been developed and are reviewed in this paper. Their in vitro and in vivo
      pharmacological properties, clinical efficacy, drug interactions, and adverse
      effects are evaluated and compared to the gold standard in the treatment of acute
      migraine, sumatriptan.

TI  - The effects of moclobemide on the pharmacokinetics of the 5-HT1B/1D agonist
      rizatriptan in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 190-6
AB  - AIMS: The new 5-HT1B/1D agonist rizatriptan (MK-0462) has recently been
      registered for the treatment of migraine. Its primary route of metabolism is via 
      monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A). Antidepressants such as the MAO-A inhibitor
      moclobemide may be used in patients with chronic headache syndromes. Hence, this 
      study aimed to investigate the interactions between rizatriptan and moclobemide. 
      METHODS: In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, two-period cross-over
      study 12 healthy, young volunteers (six males, six females) were treated with
      moclobemide (150 mg twice daily) or placebo for 4 days. On the fourth day, a
      single dose of rizatriptan (10 mg) was administered, and subsequently blood and
      urine samples were collected for assay of rizatripan and N-monodesmethyl
      rizatriptan. Plasma concentrates of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG), a marker of
      MAO-A inhibition, were also assessed. Supine and standing blood pressure were
      measured regularly. RESULTS: Both treatments were well tolerated. During
      moclobemide, the increase in supine diastolic blood pressure following
      rizatriptan administration was augmented. Inhibition of MAO by moclobemide was
      inferred from a persistent decrease in DHPG level (43% on average). When
      rizatriptan was coadministered with moclobemide, the area under the plasma drug
      concentration-time profiles for rizatriptan and its N-monodesmethyl metabolite
      increased 2.2-fold (90% CI, 1.93-2.47) and 5.3-fold (90% CI, 4.81-5.91),
      respectively, when compared with placebo. Peak plasma drug concentrations for
      rizatriptan and its n-monodesmethyl metabolite increased 1.4-fold (90% CI,
      1.11-1.80) and 2.6-fold (90% CI, 2.23-3.14), respectively, and half-lives of both
      were prolonged. CONCLUSIONS: Moclobemide inhibited the metabolism of rizatriptan 
      and its active N-monodesmethyl metabolite through inhibition of MAO-A. Thus,
      moclobemide may considerably potentiate rizatriptan action. Concurrent
      administration of moclobemide and rizatriptan is not recommended.

TI  - Effects of subcutaneous naratriptan on systemic and pulmonary haemodynamics and
      coronary artery diameter in humans.
PG  - 89-94
AB  - Naratriptan, an effective antimigraine agent, is a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine 
      (5-HT1 )-receptor agonist with a pharmacologic profile similar to that of
      sumatriptan. The object of this study was to assess the haemodynamic effects of
      naratriptan in a clinical model previously applied to sumatriptan. Cardiac
      haemodynamics and coronary artery diameter were measured at baseline and after
      subcutaneous injections of placebo and naratriptan (1.5 mg, s.c.) in 10 patients 
      undergoing diagnostic cardiac catheterisation. No statistically significant
      change in mean coronary artery diameter was observed after naratriptan [95%
      confidence interval (CI), -0.27-0.11 mm: p = 0.37]. Naratriptan injection was
      associated with statistically significant increases in systolic arterial pressure
      (95% CI, 7.6-22.0 mm Hg; p = 0.0015), total systemic vascular resistance (95% CI,
      74-253 dyn/s/cc; p = 0.003), pulmonary artery systolic pressure (95% CI, 2.0-6.9 
      mm Hg; p = 0.003), pulmonary vascular resistance (95% CI, 3-34 dyn/s/cc; p =
      0.025), and pulmonary artery wedge pressure (95% CI, 1.9-2.4 mm Hg; p = 0.009).
      Naratriptan, a selective 5-HT1-receptor agonist, caused a vasopressor response in
      the systemic and pulmonary arterial circulations but was not associated with
      coronary artery vasoconstriction.

TI  - Naratriptan: an alternative for migraine.
PG  - 704-11
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To critically evaluate the literature regarding naratriptan's clinical
      pharmacology, efficacy, safety, and indications. DATA SOURCE: A MEDLINE search
      was conducted for the period from January 1990 to June 1998. Key words used
      included naratriptan, triptan, serotonin agonists, migraine, and migraine
      therapy. In addition, pertinent references cited in articles obtained from
      MEDLINE and product information for triptans were reviewed. STUDY SELECTION AND
      DATA EXTRACTION: All original and review articles and abstracts pertaining to
      naratriptan were reviewed, as were product information extracts. Clinical trials 
      of naratriptan were critically reviewed and compared with pertinent clinical
      trials of other oral triptans. DATA SYNTHESIS: The treatment of migraine has been
      dramatically improved with the use of sumatriptan, other triptans, and
      serotonin-receptor subtype 1B and 1D agonists. Drawbacks to these medications,
      however, have included poorly tolerated adverse effects and the recurrence of the
      migraine. Naratriptan has been recently approved for acute oral migraine therapy.
      In two Phase III trials of naratriptan compared with placebo, relief at four
      hours was obtained in 60% and 68% of patients using the 2.5-mg dose, with
      recurrence of headache in 24 hours in 27% and 28% of patients. The data on
      migraine recurrence were similar to those of other oral triptans; the efficacy of
      naratriptan at two hours was not specifically analyzed. Adverse effects of
      naratriptan were similar to placebo, and its tolerability seemed superior
      compared with studies of other oral triptans. CONCLUSIONS: Naratriptan is a
      promising new oral therapy for acute migraine; it may successfully treat patients
      who poorly tolerate other triptan therapies or have longer duration migraine
      headaches.

TI  - Treatment of migraine headaches.
PG  - 702-8
AB  - Migraine headaches are common and costly. Patients with migraine frequently seek 
      medical attention from primary care physicians. Although effective therapy is
      available, migraine is underdiagnosed and undertreated. The 3 main forms of
      management are avoidance of migraine triggers, treatment of the acute attack with
      medications, and regular use of preventive medications. Although changes in
      lifestyle can help to prevent some migraine attacks, the mainstay of treatment is
      the use of medications taken early during the attack. A wide variety of
      single-ingredient and combination over-the-counter and prescription medications
      are now available. Especially effective are the new selective serotonin
      (5-hydroxytryptamine1 receptor) agonists such as sumatriptan. For patients who
      have frequent and severe migraine headaches despite the use of acute treatment,
      preventive medications, including beta-adrenergic blockers, calcium channel
      blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, and one anticonvulsant, should be
      considered. The vast majority of patients with migraine can be helped.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of rizatriptan wafer for the acute treatment of migraine.
      Rizatriptan Wafer Protocol 049 Study Group.
PG  - 525-30
AB  - Rizatriptan is a potent, highly selective 5HT1B/1D agonist with rapid onset of
      action for acute treatment of migraine. Rizatriptan wafer is a novel,
      freeze-dried dosage formulation of rizatriptan which rapidly disintegrates on the
      tongue, is swallowed with saliva, and may be taken without liquids. The efficacy 
      and tolerability of rizatriptan wafer were examined in a placebo-controlled,
      double-blind, outpatient study in 555 migraineurs. The primary efficacy endpoint 
      was pain relief at 2 h. From 30 min onwards, significantly more patients
      experienced pain relief and became pain-free after rizatriptan 10-mg wafer
      compared to placebo. At 2 h, the percentage of patients with pain relief was
      significantly higher after rizatriptan 10-mg wafer (74%), 5-mg wafer (59%)
      compared with placebo (28%). Rizatriptan 10-mg wafer was superior to rizatriptan 
      5-mg wafer on pain relief at 1.5 and 2 h (p < 0.05). Significantly more patients 
      were pain-free at 2 h after rizatriptan 10-mg wafer (42%), 5-mg wafer (35%)
      compared with placebo (10%). Both doses of rizatriptan wafer were well tolerated.
      Rizatriptan wafer is a convenient, highly effective new formulation for acute
      treatment of migraine.

TI  - Validation of a migraine work and productivity loss questionnaire for use in
      migraine studies.
PG  - 497-502
AB  - Migraine symptoms and therapy side effects cause significant functional
      disability that can result in work and productivity losses. Effective,
      well-tolerated migraine therapy with rapid onset of relief could decrease work
      and productivity losses. The Migraine Work and Productivity Loss Questionnaire
      (MWPLQ) evaluates the impact of migraine and migraine therapy on paid work. Data 
      from a randomized, open-label extension study were collected over 3 months.
      Migraineurs were randomized to either rizatriptan (5HT1B/1D receptor agonist) or 
      their usual migraine therapy. Data were analyzed from 164 patients who
      experienced at least one work-related migraine. Internal consistency (Cronbach's 
      alpha) for the work difficulty domains ranged from 0.80 to 0.95. Work loss and
      work difficulty were moderately correlated (r = 0.39-0.58) with migraine severity
      and functional ability. Differences were found favoring rizatriptan for
      absenteeism (1.3 vs 2.4 h), effectiveness at work (62% vs 49%), and difficulty
      with work-related tasks (p < 0.01). The MWPLQ demonstrated favorable measurement 
      characteristics in this study and could be an important research tool for future 
      evaluations of migraine-related work disability.

TI  - Diclofenac-potassium in migraine: a review.
PG  - 991-1003
AB  - The NSAID diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis and an
      established antipyretic and analgesic agent. Diclofenac-potassium was developed
      as an immediate-release tablet with the aim of providing rapid onset of action
      after oral administration. This formulation has been investigated in the acute
      treatment of migraine. Data from available placebo-controlled clinical trials
      indicate that diclofenac-potassium 50 or 100mg as an immediate-release tablet is 
      more effective than placebo and as effective as oral sumatriptan 100mg and
      ergotamine plus caffeine at reducing pain intensity in patients with migraine 2
      hours after initial administration. Duration of pain relief is similar for the 3 
      drugs but onset appears to be faster with diclofenac-potassium than with oral
      sumatriptan or ergotamine plus caffeine. Diclofenac-potassium appears to have
      favourable effects on some accompanying symptoms such as nausea and vomiting. The
      frequency of these symptoms was significantly lower with diclofenac-potassium
      than with sumatriptan in 1 study, although only a few patients had vomiting at
      baseline. Effects on phonophobia or photophobia did not differ between
      diclofenac-potassium, sumatriptan and ergotamine plus caffeine. The need for
      rescue medication is consistently less with diclofenac-potassium than with
      placebo. Data are inconsistent or scarce regarding the effects of
      diclofenac-potassium versus placebo on other measures such as headache recurrence
      and working ability. Diclofenac-potassium was generally well tolerated in
      clinical trials in patients with migraine. Adverse events reported most
      frequently (abdominal pain, tiredness and fatigue and nausea) were typically mild
      to moderate. CONCLUSION: Diclofenac-potassium provides rapid pain relief (within 
      60 to 90 minutes), is well tolerated and reduces the frequency of some of the
      accompanying symptoms in patients with migraine. Available trials indicate that
      diclofenac-potassium provides similar pain relief to sumatriptan and is at least 
      as effective as ergotamine plus caffeine, but appears to have a greater effect on
      nausea and vomiting than sumatriptan and a faster onset of action than both
      drugs. Comparisons with other NSAIDs are lacking. Diclofenac-potassium is likely 
      to find a role as a useful first-line option in the acute treatment of migraine.

TI  - Altered oesophageal motility following the administration of the 5-HT1 agonist,
      sumatriptan.
PG  - 927-36
AB  - BACKGROUND: The 5-HT1 agonist sumatriptan, used in the treatment of migraine, can
      cause chest pain. AIM: To investigate the effect of a therapeutic dose of
      sumatriptan (6 mg s.c.) on oesophageal motility. METHODS: In 16 normal healthy
      subjects aged 19-32 years (9 males), the manometric response of the lower
      oesophageal sphincter (sleeve sensor), oesophageal body (four sites), stomach and
      pharynx (to register swallows) to 5 mL water swallows was assessed before and
      after a subcutaneous injection of either sumatriptan (6 mg) or saline control.
      Symptoms and ECGs were also monitored. RESULTS: Sumatriptan 6 mg s.c. altered
      oesophageal motility in all subjects. This was reflected by a significant
      increase in the amplitude of oesophageal body contractions (change from pre- to 1
      h post-injection: sumatriptan 9.9 (2.8, 17.1) mmHg vs. placebo -0.8 (-4.2, 2.6)
      mmHg, difference 10.8 (4.4, 17.1) mmHg; P=0.003) and a transient increase in
      lower oesophageal sphincter pressure (change from pre- to 5 min post-injection:
      sumatriptan 10.9 (5.2, 16.6) mmHg vs. placebo 5.1 (1.8, 8.4) mmHg, difference 5.8
      (-0.7, 12.3) mmHg; P=0.08). Sumatriptan had no effect on the velocity of
      propagation of oesophageal contractions (change from pre- to 1 h post-injection: 
      sumatriptan -0.1 (-0.3, 0.1) cm/s vs. placebo -0.1 (-0.3, 0.0) cm/s, difference
      0.1 (-0.1, 0.2) cm/s; P = 0.40). One subject experienced chest symptoms following
      sumatriptan and, although motility was altered, this did not reach pathological
      levels. No ECG abnormalities were observed. CONCLUSION: Sumatriptan (6 mg s.c.)
      significantly alters oesophageal motor function without affecting the ECG. It is 
      therefore possible that sumatriptan-induced chest symptoms may have an
      oesophageal origin. The evaluation of similar therapeutic agents for migraine on 
      oesophageal function may be justified.

TI  - Acute treatment of migraine attacks: efficacy and safety of a nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drug, diclofenac-potassium, in comparison to oral sumatriptan
      and placebo. The Diclofenac-K/Sumatriptan Migraine Study Group.
PG  - 232-40
AB  - BACKGROUND: Migraine attacks are often treated with simple analgesics or with
      ergotamine-containing preparations alone or in combination with anti-emetics.
      Although also sometimes used to treat migraine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs (NSAIDs) have not been systematically evaluated in controlled clinical
      trials, particularly in comparison with the newer drug sumatriptan. Sumatriptan
      is a specific migraine treatment which has recently become among the most widely 
      prescribed acute migraine therapies. However, while effective, it has low oral
      bioavailability and some problematic adverse effects. Diclofenac-potassium is a
      potent NSAID available as a fast-acting oral tablet, which has been shown to be
      safe and effective in several other acute pain indications. In the clinical trial
      reported here, the efficacy and safety of diclofenac-potassium in the acute
      treatment of migraine attacks has been tested in comparison with oral sumatriptan
      and placebo. METHODS: Single oral doses of 50 mg and 100 mg diclofenac-potassium 
      were compared to a single oral dose of 100 mg sumatriptan and placebo in a
      double-blind randomized crossover trial in 156 adult patients suffering from
      migraine attacks, with or without aura, selected according to the International
      Headache Society diagnostic criteria. The primary efficacy criterion was migraine
      headache pain recorded on a visual analog scale at 2 h after dosing. Secondary
      endpoints included pain at other time points up to 8 h and the presence of
      accompanying symptoms (nausea, vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia). FINDINGS:
      Diclofenac-potassium was more effective than placebo in reducing migraine
      headache pain at 2 h after dosing, which was the primary endpoint. Secondary
      analyses showed that diclofenac-potassium provided significant pain relief from
      60 min after dosing and for all remaining endpoints in the 8-h observation
      period. Both 50 and 100 mg doses of diclofenac-potassium were similarly
      effective. A similar effect was shown with sumatriptan; however, significant
      superiority to placebo was seen only from the 90-min time point.
      Diclofenac-potassium was generally superior to placebo or sumatriptan in reducing
      accompanying symptoms, particularly nausea. Diclofenac-potassium seemed to be as 
      well tolerated as placebo, with fewer adverse events reported than after
      sumatriptan treatment and with more patients assessing the overall tolerability
      of diclofenac-potassium better than that of sumatriptan. INTERPRETATION: Compared
      with placebo and the reference therapy sumatriptan, diclofenac-potassium is an
      effective, fast-acting, and well-tolerated acute oral therapy for migraine
      attacks, with advantages over oral sumatriptan in terms of onset of analgesic
      effect, reduction of accompanying symptoms, and tolerability profile. It may
      therefore be useful as an alternative oral therapy for migraine attacks.

      injection for acute treatment of migraine.
PG  - 223-31; discussion 200
AB  - To investigate prospectively serious adverse events associated with sumatriptan
      injection, we studied 12,339 typical migraineurs for up to 12 months each. This
      study imitated the ordinary clinical use of sumatriptan injection except that:
      (a) a short, written informed consent was required, (b) there was a centralized, 
      automated dispensing service that audited each patient's product use, (c)
      patients were sometimes reviewed by telephone, and (d) drug supply and medical
      consultation were without charge. All adverse events were recorded regardless of 
      etiology. There were 25 fatalities during the study, none being attributable to
      sumatriptan injection. Of six strokes in the study, two occurred soon after
      treatment of a migraine attack with sumatriptan injection; whether these were
      migraine-related or drug-related is discussed. None of the three myocardial
      infarctions was due to sumatriptan injection use. We conclude that sumatriptan
      injection is well tolerated when used in accordance with labeling.

      pragmatic, randomized trial.
PG  - 3-18
AB  - This paper presents the protocol for a randomized trial of acupuncture for
      migraine and headache. TRIAL OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of a policy of
      'use acupuncture' on headache, health status, days off sick and resource use
      compared to a policy of 'avoid acupuncture.' SUBJECTS: Four hundred patients with
      migraine or headache will be recruited from GP practices. INCLUSION CRITERIA:
      Eighteen to 65 years old, contractable by telephone, onset at least 1 year prior 
      at age less than 50, two headaches per month in the previous 6 months, adequate
      data completion and headache severity during pre-randomization baseline.
      EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Pregnancy or malignancy, cluster headache, serious
      pathological aetiology, cranial neuralgia, acupuncture treatment in the past
      year. DESIGN: Following a 4-week baseline, patients will be allocated to
      acupuncture or control by minimized randomization. Up to 12 acupuncture
      treatments will be provided by advanced members of the Acupuncture Association of
      Chartered Physiotherapists. The type of acupuncture given will be recorded. STUDY
      MEASURES: Outcome will be assessed by headache diary, medication diary and SF36
      at 3 months and 1 year. Resource use and days off sick will be assessed by
      quarterly questionnaire. Adverse events will be monitored by self-report. The
      primary outcome measure will be the change in mean daily headache score between
      baseline and the 1 year follow-up. An economic evaluation will also be
      undertaken.

TI  - Focus on primary care diagnosis and management of headache in women.
PG  - 395-402
AB  - Women experience unique changes in headache pattern related to changes in their
      reproductive cycles. Changes predictably occur in association with menarche,
      menstrual cycling, the use of oral contraceptives, pregnancy, and menopause.
      These predictable headache changes are linked to changing levels of sex hormones.
      This article describes important relationships between estradiol and
      neurotransmitters involved in the pathogenesis of headache, such as serotonin.
      Treatment of headache in women includes the use of acute care and preventive
      treatments. The effectiveness of both medication and nonmedication treatments is 
      reviewed. Also, unique aspects of treating headache with menstruation, pregnancy,
      and menopause are described.

OAB - PIP: This document presents the primary care diagnosis and management of headache
      in women. The varying patterns of chronic headache among females during their
      reproductive years are related to the changing hormonal levels. Migraine occurs
      in 25% and tension-type of headache occurs in 88% of women. These changes occur
      during menarche, menstrual cycling, oral contraceptive use, pregnancy and
      menopause as a result of the changes in sex steroid levels. The physiological
      relationship between estradiol and other neurotransmitters that causes headache
      is described. Diagnosis of headache includes physical and neurologic
      examinations. Treatment of headache depends on the woman's reproductive stage.
      Acute-care headache treatments include analgesics, opioids, ergotamines, and the 
      triptans for 2-3 days a week. Chronic or tension-type headaches require
      preventive therapy, which includes the daily use of antidepressants,
      beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and antiepilepsy medications. Menstrual 
      migraine medication includes serotonin and prostaglandin active agents during
      chronic headaches and beta-blockers, antidepressants, calcium channel blockers or
      valproic acid. Nonpharmacologic treatment of headache is preferred for pregnant
      women.

TI  - Intracranial vessels in trigeminal transmitted pain: A PET study.
PG  - 453-60
AB  - The underlying principle in interpreting data from positron emission tomography
      (PET) is that increases and decreases of synaptic activity in the brain are
      accompanied by equivalent changes in regional blood flow. However, given the
      relatively low spatial resolution of PET, regional indices of neural activity can
      be influenced by signals from nonneural elements in the intracranial space. We
      have used PET to study the functional neuroanatomy of headache syndromes, such as
      cluster headache and experimental headache, by observing activation in brain that
      is due to synaptic activity. In these studies we noted a bilateral activation in 
      midline structures over several planes that, based on its anatomy, is likely to
      arise from bilateral large intracranial arteries in the region of the cavernous
      sinus. We have observed this activity in two different group studies and in 11 of
      17 single-subject studies. The most likely explanation for this "activation" is
      the increased volume of space occupied by dilated large vessels containing H215O.
      We further defined the anatomy of the PET findings using magnetic resonance
      angiography, which showed bilateral vasodilatation of the internal carotid artery
      and the basilar artery in nitroglycerin-induced cluster headache attacks. While
      the fact that vascular structures can contaminate PET-based blood flow studies
      may be well known to methodological experts, the issue is less well recognized
      outside the immediate field.

TI  - Systematic review and guide to selection of selective serotonin reuptake
      inhibitors.
PG  - 507-33
AB  - A meta-analysis of 20 short term comparative studies of 5 selective serotonin
      reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine and
      sertraline) has shown no difference in efficacy between individual compounds but 
      a slower onset of action of fluoxetine. There were suggestions that fluoxetine
      caused more agitation, weight loss and dermatological reactions than the other
      SSRIs. More patients discontinued fluvoxamine and fewer patients stopped
      sertraline because of adverse effects than their comparator SSRIs. The most
      common adverse reactions to the SSRIs were gastrointestinal (especially nausea)
      and neuropsychiatric (particularly headache and tremor). Data from the Committee 
      on Safety of Medicines showed more reports of suspected reactions (including
      discontinuation reactions) to paroxetine, and of gastrointestinal reactions to
      fluvoxamine and paroxetine, than the other SSRIs during their first 2 years of
      marketing. Prescription-event monitoring revealed a higher incidence of adverse
      events related to fluvoxamine than its comparators. There were higher incidences 
      of gastrointestinal symptoms, malaise, sedation and tremor during treatment with 
      fluvoxamine and of sedation, tremor, sweating, sexual dysfunction and
      discontinuation reactions with paroxetine. Fluoxetine was not associated with a
      higher incidence of suicidal, aggressive and related events than the other SSRIs.
      Patients have survived large overdoses of each of the compounds, but concern has 
      been expressed over 6 fatalities following overdoses of citalopram. Drug
      interactions mediated by cytochrome P450 enzymes are theoretically less likely to
      occur during treatment with citalopram and sertraline, but there is a sparsity of
      clinical data to support this. Methodological difficulties and price changes do
      not allow choice for recommendations on the choice of SSRI based on
      pharmacoeconomic data. Taking into account the strengths and weaknesses of the
      methods used to compare drugs, guidelines to the selection of individual SSRIs in
      clinical practice are proposed. Citalopram should be avoided in patients likely
      to take overdoses. Fluoxetine may not be the drug of first choice for patients in
      whom a rapid antidepressant effect is important or for those who are agitated,
      but it may have advantages over other SSRIs in patients who are poorly compliant 
      with treatment and those who have previously had troublesome discontinuation
      symptoms. Fluvoxamine, and possibly paroxetine, should not be used as first
      choice in patients especially prone to SSRI-related adverse reactions, while
      paroxetine should be avoided if previous discontinuation of treatment was
      troublesome. When in doubt about the risks of drug interactions, citalopram or
      sertraline should be considered given the lower theoretical risk of interactions.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and tolerability of oral rizatriptan in healthy male and female 
      volunteers.
PG  - 373-8
AB  - AIMS: The pharmacokinetics and dose proportionality of rizatriptan single oral
      doses from 2.5 to 15 mg administered as solutions to healthy volunteers were
      studied. METHODS: In a randomized, crossover study with four periods, twenty-four
      healthy volunteers (12 males and 12 females) took single oral doses of 2.5, 5,
      10, and 15 mg rizatriptan in Periods 1-4. In a fifth period, subjects received 4 
      mg intravenous (i.v.) rizatriptan as a reference. Plasma and urine rizatriptan
      concentrations were determined at several timepoints/intervals for 12 and 24 h,
      respectively. RESULTS: The arithmetic mean AUC values following single oral doses
      of 2.5, 5, 10, and 15-mg rizatriptan were 16, 33, 72, and 127 ng ml-1 h,
      respectively, in males; and 19, 42, 97, and 161 ng ml-1 h, respectively, in
      females. The overall bioavailability (F ) of rizatriptan was approximately 40% in
      males. Following the 4 mg reference i.v. dose, the apparent plasma clearance (CL)
      and renal clearance (CLr ) were 1042 and 225 ml min-1, respectively, in males;
      and 821 and 174 ml min-1, respectively, in females. CONCLUSIONS: The disposition 
      kinetics of oral rizatriptan were linear for doses of 2. 5-10 mg in males, and
      for doses of 2.5-5 mg in females. However, the degree of nonlinearity for higher 
      doses was minor for both genders. The plasma concentrations of rizatriptan were
      slightly greater in women compared to men but the difference was not considered
      to be clinically meaningful. Also, the clearance of rizatriptan appeared to be
      mainly nonrenal.

TI  - Migraine headaches: nutritional, botanical and other alternative approaches.
PG  - 86-95
AB  - Migraine headaches are an increasingly common health problem with a wide range of
      potential etiological factors. Stress, food allergies, neuroendocrine imbalances 
      and nutritional deficiencies all may contribute to migraine attacks. Many
      nutritional and botanical therapies aim to reduce migraine incidence by
      decreasing platelet aggregation and preventing the release of vasoactive
      neurotransmitters, and avoiding triggering foods. This article reviews much of
      the research on nutritional, botanical, dietary, and other alternative approaches
      to the treatment and prevention of migraines.

PG  - 1507-10
AB  - Sumatriptan is a highly effective treatment for migraine in adults but its
      efficacy in children has not been determined. Fourteen children with migraine
      (6.4 to 9.8 years of age; seven girls, six with aura) participated in a
      randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study to evaluate the
      efficacy of sumatriptan nasal spray. After sumatriptan, 12 of 14 (versus 6 of 14 
      after placebo) reported a decrease in pain intensity (p = 0.031); complete
      headache relief was obtained in 9 of 14 after sumatriptan versus 2 of 14 after
      placebo (p = 0.016). Migraine-associated symptoms were also significantly reduced
      by sumatriptan.

TI  - Changes in resource use and outcomes for patients with migraine treated with
      sumatriptan: a managed care perspective.
PG  - 857-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: Migraine headaches result in significant patient suffering and high
      costs to managed care organizations and employers. Studies that evaluate patient 
      outcomes and the financial consequences of migraine treatment are important from 
      a clinical and an economic perspective. METHODS: This prospective, observational 
      study assessed the outcomes of migraineurs in a mixed model staff/ independent
      practice association managed care organization for patients previously diagnosed 
      as having migraine who received their first prescription for sumatriptan. Data
      collected included medical as well as pharmacy claims and patient surveys to
      measure changes in satisfaction, health-related quality of life, workplace
      productivity, and nonworkplace activity after sumatriptan therapy was initiated. 
      RESULTS: A total of 178 patients completed the study. Results showed significant 
      decreases in the mean number of migraine-related physician office visits,
      emergency department visits, and medical procedures in the 6 months after
      sumatriptan therapy compared with the 6 months before sumatriptan was used
      (P<.05). Four of the health-related quality-of-life dimensions and the physical
      component summary score measured by the SF-36 (which is a valid, reliable general
      health status instrument) showed significant improvements at 6 months compared
      with patients' scores before use of sumatriptan (P<.05). Health-related quality
      of life measured by the disease-specific instrument MSQ (Migraine-Specific
      Quality of Life Questionnaire-Version 1.0, 1992 Glaxo Wellcome Inc, Research
      Triangle Park, NC) showed significant improvement at 3 and at 6 months compared
      with baseline scores (P<.05). There were also improvements in patient
      satisfaction and significant reductions in time lost from workplace productivity 
      and nonworkplace activity. CONCLUSION: In the 6 months after sumatriptan therapy 
      was initiated, health care resource use and time lost from workplace productivity
      and nonworkplace activity were reduced, while health-related quality of life and 
      patient satisfaction scores improved for the managed care migraineurs enrolled in

TI  - Effects of zolmitriptan (Zomig) on central serotonergic neurotransmission as
      assessed by active oddball auditory event-related potentials in volunteers
      without migraine.
PG  - 100-6; discussion 73
AB  - In this randomized, double-blind, three-period crossover trial, 24 healthy
      volunteers without migraine received zolmitriptan 5 mg, dexfenfluramine 15 mg or 
      placebo orally. At 2, 6, and 24 h postdose, auditory stimuli of 1000 Hz
      (nontarget tone) and 2000 Hz (target tone) were randomly and binaurally presented
      in an active oddball paradigm (4:1 ratio). Cortical auditory evoked responses
      were recorded for 500 msec poststimulus. Plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan
      and a 17-lead quantitative EEG were assessed at the same timepoints. Relative to 
      placebo, zolmitriptan reduced the maximum absolute amplitude, amplitude
      difference (from nontarget tone noise) and area under the curve of the cortical
      auditory target tone event-related potential (P300 ERP). The most dramatic effect
      of zolmitriptan was to diminish the point estimate of noise during the 200-400
      msec poststimulus epoch. The effect of zolmitriptan appeared concentration
      dependent. The latency of the P300 ERP was unaffected by zolmitriptan and there
      was no clinically significant effect on the EEG. Modification by zolmitriptan of 
      the cortical electrical activity evoked by auditory stimuli confirms a central
      action of this drug in humans, which appears to affect cortical information
      processing without global alteration of the quantitative EEG.

TI  - A double-blind, randomized, crossover assessment of blood pressure following
      administration of avitriptan, sumatriptan, or placebo to patients with mild to
      moderate hypertension.
PG  - 95-9
AB  - We examined the effects of avitriptan, a 5-hydroxytryptamine 1-like (5HT1)
      receptor agonist for the treatment of migraine, in patients with medicated,
      controlled, mild to moderate hypertension relative to placebo and sumatriptan.
      The study was randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, and 4-way crossover
      in design. Twenty patients (12M, 8F) participated. As required by protocol, all
      were stable on medications for mild to moderate hypertension, with a supine
      diastolic blood pressure of < 95 mmHg. Qualified subjects were randomized to
      receive oral administration of either 75 or 150 mg of avitriptan, 100 mg
      sumatriptan or placebo during the four treatment visits. Supine blood pressure
      and pulse rates were recorded up to 24 h after drug administration. Avitriptan
      150 mg significantly increased peak diastolic and systolic blood pressure, and
      mean arterial pressure compared to placebo and sumatriptan 100 mg (p < 0.05).
      Only those hypertensive patients receiving medication for hypertension should
      receive anti-migraine medications, such as avitriptan, which are 5HT1-like
      receptor agonists.

TI  - Sumatriptan nasal spray: a dose-ranging study in the acute treatment of migraine.
PG  - 43-9
AB  - This multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group
      dose-ranging study compared the efficacy and tolerability of four doses of
      sumatriptan nasal spray (2.5, 5, 10 and 20 mg) with a placebo, in the acute
      treatment of a single migraine attack. In total, 544 patients received the study 
      medication as a single spray in one nostril, to treat a single migraine attack in
      the clinic. Efficacy assessments included the measurement of headache severity,
      clinical disability, and the presence/absence of associated symptoms. The
      incidence of headache recurrence was also assessed. The three highest doses of
      sumatriptan (5 mg 49%, 10 mg 46%, 20 mg 64%) were significantly better than the
      placebo (25%) at providing headache relief (moderate or severe headache improving
      to mild or none) 120 min after treatment (P </= 0. 01). Also, the 20 mg dose was 
      significantly superior to both the 10 and 5 mg doses at this time point (P <
      0.05). The proportion of patients who were headache-free 120 min after treatment,
      was also higher following 20 mg (42%) rather than following any other sumatriptan
      dose (14-24%, P < 0.005 20 vs 10 mg) or placebo (11%). Headache recurrence in
      patients who had responded to initial treatment was reported by 30-41% of
      patients who received sumatriptan, compared with 33% of patients in the placebo
      group. Sumatriptan nasal spray was well tolerated, the incidence of adverse
      events with each dose of sumatriptan being similar to the placebo (20-27 and 23%,
      respectively). Apart from bad/bitter taste, the events were comparable with those
      reported following sumatriptan treatment by other routes of administration.

TI  - The haemodynamic effect of the 5HT1 agonist BMS-180048: a class effect of
      triptans?
PG  - 189-94
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the effects of an intravenous infusion of BMS-180048, a
      novel 5HT1-like agonist, on the systemic, pulmonary and coronary circulations in 
      patients undergoing diagnostic cardiac catheterisation. METHODS: Ten patients
      (mean age 55 years (range 41-65)) were studied during diagnostic cardiac
      catheterisation. The haemodynamic response to an intravenous (i.v.) infusion for 
      30 min of BMS-180048 (0.56 mg kg(-1) h(-1) for 10 min and 0.39 mg kg(-1) h(-1)
      for 20 min) was assessed via a 7F Swan Ganz catheter and thermodilution cardiac
      output system. Quantitative coronary angiography was performed at 10 min
      intervals. RESULTS: BMS-180048 caused a significant increase in systemic arterial
      systolic blood pressure (rise of 32.5 mmHg, 95% CI 24,44.5) P=0.009), pulmonary
      artery systolic (12.2 mmHg, 95% CI 6.8,18.5; P=0.009) and diastolic pressures
      (8.5 mmHg, 95% CI 5.0,13.8; P=0.009), right atrial pressure (4 mmHg, 95% CI
      1.5,5.2; P=0.013) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (9.5 mmHg 95% CI
      5.2,14.0; P=0.09). There was no significant change in cardiac output (0.1 l
      min(-1), 95% CI -0.17,0.57, P>0.05). Mean coronary artery diameter in the
      proximal coronary segments decreased by 0.73 mm (95% CI -1.22,-0.15; P=0.03) at
      35 min. The corresponding reduction in middle segments was 0.26 mm (95% CI
      -0.395,-0.08; P=0.02). There was a non-significant trend to constriction in the
      most distal segments of 0.28 mm (95% CI -0.68,0.015); P=0.06). One patient
      experienced chest pain with ECG changes suggestive of ischaemia. CONCLUSIONS:
      BMS-180048 displayed a cardiovascular profile similar to that previously reported
      for sumatriptan. These changes appear to reflect a class effect of these agents.

TI  - Sumatriptan is effective in the treatment of menstrual migraine: a review of
      prospective studies and retrospective analyses.
PG  - 16-9
AB  - Menstrual migraine may be debilitating, long-lasting, and refractory to
      treatment. Because the efficacy and tolerability of abortive and prophylactic
      treatment options for menstrual migraine have generally not been evaluated in
      controlled clinical trials, treatment choices are often made on the basis of
      personal experience and anecdotal reports. This article reviews evidence from
      retrospective analyses and prospective studies showing that sumatriptan injection
      and tablets are effective and well tolerated in menstrual migraine. (1)
      Sumatriptan injection 6 mg was as effective in the treatment of menstrual
      migraine attacks as it was for nonmenstrual attacks in a retrospective analysis
      of data from two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group
      trials (n = 1104). In the menstrual migraine group, 80% of women treated with
      sumatriptan injection 6 mg compared with 19% of placebo-treated patients reported
      headache relief 1 h postdose (p < 0.001). (2) Sumatriptan injection 6 mg was
      effective in the acute treatment of menstrual migraine attacks in a prospective, 
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, two-attack study (n = 226).
      Across the two attacks, 70-71% of patients treating menstrual migraine attacks
      with sumatriptan injection 6 mg compared with 22-24% of placebo-treated patients 
      reported headache relief 1 h postdose (p < 0.001). (3) Sumatriptan tablets 100 mg
      were effective in the acute treatment of menstrual migraine attacks in a
      prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in women diagnosed
      with menstrual migraine (n = 115). For menstrual migraine attacks, headache
      relief 4 h postdose was reported by 67% of sumatriptan-treated patients compared 
      with 33% of placebo-treated patients. Sumatriptan injection and tablets were
      generally well tolerated in these studies, in which adverse events were
      characteristic of those typically observed in sumatriptan acute migraine clinical
      trials. These data demonstrate that sumatriptan injection and tablets are
      effective and well tolerated in the treatment of menstrual migraine.

TI  - Migraine: a "woman's disease?".
PG  - 79-99
AB  - Migraine, a chronic disorder characterized by episodes of headache, has a
      profound effect on the well-being and general functioning of its victims, not
      only during the acute attacks, but also in terms of impairment of school
      achievement, work performance, and family/social relationships. Despite
      staggering social and economic costs, it remains under-diagnosed and
      under-treated worldwide. Migraine has been labeled a "woman's disease" because it
      is three times more common in women than men, the attacks tend to be more severe 
      and disabling among women and, in some women, they seem to be modulated by such
      hormonal "milestones" as menarche, menstruation, pregnancy and menopause. After a
      brief review of the diagnosis of migraine, this article will examine the nuances 
      responsible for that label and their implications for treatment.

TI  - The pharmacodynamics of sumatriptan in nitroglycerin-induced headache.
PG  - 17-29
AB  - Migraine is a common disorder that causes significant morbidity in those
      afflicted. Many novel antimigraine compounds are in clinical development, yet
      full characterization of each one's pharmacodynamic behavior is a formidable task
      due to the difficulty in studying a migraineur during an attack. Nitroglycerin
      (NTG) administration commonly causes a headache with some features similar to
      those of a migraine. As such, NTG has been used as a model of vascular headaches,
      including migraine. The pharmacodynamic effects of nitroglycerin and sumatriptan 
      on middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity (MCAv) and headache scores were
      studied in 10 healthy male volunteers. An intravenous infusion of NTG titrated to
      0.5 mcg/kg/min over 30 minutes resulted in a median reduction from baseline in
      MCAv of 27% (range: 16.4%-37.3%). Nine of the subjects developed a headache with 
      a median verbal score of 3.5 of 10 (range: 0-5). Subjects received sumatriptan
      either 2 mg intravenously or 6 mg subcutaneously, which abated clinical headache 
      in 9 of the 10 subjects (p = 0.030). A median sumatriptan-induced increase in
      MCAv of 21% (p = 0.054) suggested a constricting effect on the NTG-induced
      dilated MCA. A two-compartment pharmacokinetic/indirect-effects pharmacodynamic
      model was fit to the sumatriptan concentration and MCAv data using iterative
      two-stage analysis. This model was unbiased and fit the concentration (r2 = 0.98)
      and the MCAv (r2 = 0.79) data well. These results suggest that NTG-induced
      headache and the development of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models could
      serve as a useful method for exploring the mechanisms of abortive migraine drugs.

TI  - Medication-induced headache: overview and systematic review of therapeutic
      approaches.
PG  - 61-72
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review medication-induced headache (MIH) through a systematic
      evaluation of the literature regarding the pharmacologic management of this
      condition. METHODOLOGY: To identify and evaluate all pharmacologic interventions 
      for MIH, we conducted a qualitative systematic review of the English-language
      literature from 1966 to June 1998 using MEDLINE. The following search terms were 
      used: chronic daily headache, transformed migraine, analgesic withdrawal
      headache, analgesic rebound headache, drug-associated headache,
      medication-induced headache, detoxification, and dihydroergotamine. In addition, 
      a review of the references from relevant literature was also conducted to collect
      reports not identified in the MEDLINE search. RESULTS: Numerous therapies for
      acute management of MIH have been evaluated, although no rigorously conducted
      clinical trials were identified. Therapies evaluated include abrupt withdrawal of
      analgesics, initiation of dihydroergotamine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory
      agents, methylergonovine, dihydroergotamine, sumatriptan, amitriptyline,
      dexamethasone, piracetam, prothipendyl, and valproate. Epidemiology, diagnosis,
      clinical features, pathophysiology, and long-term prognosis of therapy are
      discussed and therapeutic guidelines are offered. CONCLUSIONS: MIH is an
      underrecognized and difficult condition affecting headache-prone patients. The
      published literature concerning treatment of patients with MIH is scant and of
      poor quality, making it difficult for clinicians to decide on appropriate
      therapy. Recognition and treatment of MIH may lead to a long-term improvement in 
      headache relief for many patients. It appears that complete withdrawal of the
      medications being overused is required for favorable long-term results.

TI  - Radiofrequency cervical zygapophyseal joint neurotomy for cervicogenic headache: 
      a prospective study of 15 patients.
PG  - 297-303
AB  - The present study assessed the clinical efficacy of radiofrequency cervical
      zygapophyseal joint neurotomy in patients with cervicogenic headache. Fifteen
      consecutive patients with cervicogenic headache were treated and then assessed
      one week prior to treatment and, at short-term (8 weeks), intermediate (mean 8.8 
      months) and long-term (mean 16.8 months) follow-ups. The following were taken as 
      outcome parameters: Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), 7-point Verbal Rating Scale
      (VRS), number of headache days per week and analgesic intake per week. The
      results of this study showed that radiofrequency neurotomy of the cervical
      zygapophyseal joints significantly reduced headache severity in 12 (80%)
      patients, both at short-term and long-term follow-up assessed by 7-point VRS.
      Mean VAS decrease was 31.4 mm (p < 0.001) and 53.5 mm (p < 0.0001) respectively
      in this period. The average mean number of headache days per week decreased from 
      5.8 days to 2.8 days (p = 0.001) and the average analgesic intake per week showed
      a reduction from a mean of 17.5 tablets to a mean of 3.4 tablets (p = 0.003). A
      definitive conclusion about the clinical efficacy of this treatment can only be
      drawn from a randomized controlled trial.

TI  - Subcutaneous sumatriptan compared with usual acute treatments for migraine:
      clinical and pharmacoeconomic evaluation.
PG  - 332-41
AB  - Cost-effectiveness and cost per successful treatment has been evaluated in 186
      outpatients randomised to treat moderate to severe migraine attacks either with
      subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg (n = 97) or with their current therapy (n = 89)
      during an open, multicentre study of 3 months. Within 2 hours, headache severity 
      decreased to none/mild in 86% of all attacks in the sumatriptan group (STG)
      compared to 25% in the customary group (CTG). Migraine was alleviated earlier in 
      the STG than in the CTG (median 3.78 vs. 13.39 hours, p < 0.0001). The direct and
      total cost of treatment was 133 and 2012 BF, respectively, in the CTG and 1400
      and 2522 BF, respectively, in the STG. Measuring the effectiveness of earlier
      pain relief with sumatriptan, the incremental cost-effective ratios for direct
      and total cost were 132 and 53 BF per hour of relieved pain, respectively. For
      this price, significantly more sumatriptan patients improved their quality of
      life by more than 20% (61.6 vs. 20.6% patients, p < 0.001) and less sumatriptan
      patient consulted a medical professional (11.3 vs. 29.2% patients, p < 0.01),
      used less medication for adverse events (6.2 vs. 22.5%, p < 0.001) and suffered
      less from associated migraine symptoms. The median number of hours of diminished 
      work-efficiency (3 vs. 7 hours, p < 0.01) or of suspension of non-professional
      activity (10 vs. 24 hours, p < 0.001) was also significantly lower in the STG.
      The total cost per successfully treated patient was lower in the STG. Sumatriptan
      is more effective, provides a better quality of life, reduces health care
      resource utilisation, and improves work productivity as compared to the CTG,
      thereby resulting in a favourable cost-effectiveness ratio.

TI  - Lack of an effect of zolmitriptan (Zomig, 311C90) on psychometric task
      performance: results of a placebo-controlled study in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 398-404
AB  - The novel selective 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1B/1D agonist, zolmitriptan (Zomig,
      formerly known as 311C90), has shown good efficacy in the acute oral treatment of
      migraine. Zolmitriptan acts both centrally and peripherally, therefore it is
      important to assess central nervous system effects. At single doses of 25-50 mg
      (up to 8 times the likely therapeutic dose), zolmitriptan can cause sedation;
      therefore, a study was designed to examine the dose-response. A double-blind,
      randomized, placebo-controlled, six-limb crossover study in 13 healthy volunteers
      compared the effects of single oral doses of zolmitriptan (5, 10, 15 or 20 mg)
      and lorazepam (2 mg) on various psychometric tests. Zolmitriptan doses less than 
      20 mg had no statistically significant effects on choice reaction time, the
      Stroop test, visual analog scale (VAS) assessments of physical sedation,
      tranquilization and other types of feelings, the logical reasoning test or the
      adaptive tracking test. There was a mild transient increase in the subjective
      assessment on VAS of mental sedation which was dose related and occurred mainly
      with the highest zolmitriptan dose and were not reflected in objective measures
      of drug effects. In contrast, lorazepam (used as a positive control) was
      associated with statistically significant impairment in all tests (except
      tranquilization) for up to 10 h after dosing. The results demonstrate that
      therapeutic doses of zolmitriptan are unlikely to cause clinically significant
      impairment in psychometric performance.

TI  - Comparative efficacy and safety of calcium carbasalate plus metoclopramide versus
      ergotamine tartrate plus caffeine in the treatment of acute migraine attacks.
PG  - 37-43
AB  - This randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, multicenter, parallel-group study
      aimed at comparing the efficacy and safety of calcium carbasalate (equivalent to 
      900 mg aspirin) plus metoclopramide 10 mg (CM) with ergotamine tartrate 1 mg plus
      caffeine 100 mg (EC) administered in the treatment of 2 acute migraine attacks. A
      total of 296 patients fulfilling the International Headache Society diagnostic
      criteria for migraine were enrolled. In total, one or two migraine attacks were
      treated in 268 and 235 patients, respectively. The primary endpoint for the first
      treated attack was headache relief, with intensity decreasing from moderate or
      severe to mild or absent 2 h after drug intake. Usual secondary efficacy
      endpoints were assessed. A superiority of CM over EC was observed for both
      treated attacks for the main endpoint: success in 54 versus 36%, p = 0.003 for
      the first attack and 60 versus 44%, p = 0.02 for the second attack. CM was also
      significantly superior to EC during the first attack for complete headache relief
      (20 vs. 8%, p = 0.006), nausea (42 vs. 63%, p = 0. 007) and willingness to take
      the drug again (90 vs. 80%, p = 0.043). The global efficacy evaluation, rated by 
      the investigators, was significantly more favorable to CM for both attacks (p =
      0.001 for the first attack and p = 0.02 for the second). The patients' evaluation
      was significant for the first attack (p = 0.002). The global incidence of adverse
      events was 45% higher with EC, though not significant (32 vs. 22%, p = 0.075).
      They were most often unspecific and mild to moderate in intensity.
      Gastrointestinal side effects were significantly less frequent with CM than EC (7
      vs. 21%, p = 0.001). Thus, CM is more effective and has a better gastrointestinal
      safety than EC in the acute treatment of migraine attacks.

TI  - Exercise testing in patients with chest pain to sumatriptan.
PG  - 245-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In order to assess whether chest pain attributed to sumatriptan is
      associated with abnormalities on cardiac exercise testing, we performed a
      case-control study. SUBJECTS: Cases were selected as consumers of sumatriptan who
      reported sumatriptan associated chest pain. A reference group was selected
      randomly from consumers of sumatriptan with the same GP as the case, who reported
      no chest pain after use of sumatriptan. If possible, controls were matched for
      age (within 5-year groups) and gender. OUTCOMES: In a total of 74 cases and 55
      controls symptom-limited exercise tests were performed. Besides a small
      difference in age, there were no differences in basic characteristics between
      cases and controls. Three cases had ST-depression on ECG during exercise.
      However, none of the variables measured during exercise testing differed
      significantly between cases and controls. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of abnormal
      exercise tests in patients with sumatriptan-induced chest pain is low, and not
      statistically different from patients without chest pain after intake of
      sumatriptan. Routine performance of exercise testing in patients with
      sumatriptan-associated chest pain is not recommended.

TI  - Sumatriptan (5-HT1D receptor agonist) does not exacerbate symptoms in obsessive
      compulsive disorder.
PG  - 365-70
AB  - The non-selective serotonin (5-HT) receptor agonist meta-chlorophenylpiperazine
      (mCPP) has been reported to elicit symptoms in patients with obsessive compulsive
      disorder (OCD). MK-212, another non-selective 5-HT receptor agonist, does not
      seem to induce obsessive compulsive symptoms in OCD patients. The major
      pharmacological difference between mCPP and MK-212 is their affinity for the
      5-HT(ID) receptor. The aim of this study was to explore the role of the 5-HT(ID) 
      receptor in the pathophysiology of OCD, by using a challenge paradigm with the
      selective 5-HT(ID) receptor agonist sumatriptan (Imigran). A randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover challenge with sumatriptan (100 mg PO)
      was performed in 15 OCD patients. Neither the obsessive compulsive symptoms nor
      mood or anxiety symptoms changed significantly following sumatriptan
      administration as compared to placebo. Sumatriptan did induce a significant
      increase in plasma growth hormone (GH) levels. In the present study, no
      indication were found for the role of the 5-HT(ID) receptor in the
      pathophysiology of OCD. It should be noted, however, that sumatriptan does not
      readily pass the blood-brain barrier. Selective 5-HT(ID) receptors with better
      brain penetrating properties may shed more light on the role of this 5-HT
      receptor subtype in OCD.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and tolerability of intravenous rizatriptan in healthy females.
PG  - 577-81
AB  - The pharmacokinetics and tolerability of intravenous (i.v.) rizatriptan
      (MK-0462), a novel 5-HT1D/1B receptor agonist for the acute oral treatment of
      migraine, were examined in an open, single-dose, four-period, randomized
      crossover study in healthy females. Results of this study indicated that i.v.
      rizatriptan (0.5-5 mg) was well tolerated. The disposition kinetics of
      rizatriptan were linear for i.v. doses up to and including 2.5 mg. Relative to
      the 0.5 mg dose, geometric mean dose-adjusted AUC ratios were 1.04, 1.09, and
      1.18 for 1, 2.5, and 5 mg doses, respectively. Apparent plasma clearance (Cl)
      ranged between 859 and 941 mL min(-1) from 0.5 to 2.5 mg, but dropped to slightly
      below 800 mL min(-1) for the 5 mg dose. Therefore, the elimination of rizatriptan
      appears somewhat dose dependent at the high end of this dose range. Mean plasma
      half-life (t1/2) was 1.5-2.2 h across all doses while mean residence time in the 
      body (MRT) and steady state volume of distribution (Vss) of rizatriptan remained 
      relatively invariant across doses. Urinary excretion of rizatriptan (Ue) ranged
      from 14.5 to 34.6% of dose.

TI  - Involvement of two different pathways in the motor effects of erythromycin on the
      gastric antrum in humans.
PG  - 395-400
AB  - BACKGROUND: During the interdigestive state in humans, erythromycin 40 mg induces
      a premature activity front that starts in the stomach, while erythromycin 200 mg 
      induces a prolonged period of enhanced antral contractile activity. AIMS: To
      study the involvement of a cholinergic pathway in the motor effects of
      erythromycin using the muscarinic antagonist atropine and the neural 5-HT1
      receptor agonist sumatriptan. METHODS: In 30 healthy volunteers, fasted
      antroduodenojejunal motor activity was studied by stationary manometry. Placebo
      (n = 10), atropine (15 micrograms/kg intravenous bolus plus 15 micrograms/kg/h
      over 30 minutes; n = 10), or sumatriptan (6 mg subcutaneously; n = 10) was
      administered, followed by infusion of erythromycin 40 mg or 200 mg. RESULTS:
      After placebo, erythromycin 40 mg induced a premature activity front with gastric
      onset after 19.1 (1.7) minutes in all volunteers. After atropine, erythromycin 40
      mg failed to induce a premature activity front during a 60 minute period in all
      volunteers (p < 0.001), while sumatriptan prevented the induction of a premature 
      activity front during a 60 minute period in all but one volunteer (p < 0.005).
      The number of antral contractions and their mean amplitude in the 60 minutes
      after erythromycin 200 mg did not differ significantly after atropine or
      sumatriptan versus placebo. CONCLUSIONS: The antral motor effects of erythromycin
      in humans are mediated via different pathways. The induction of a premature
      activity front is mediated through activation of an intrinsic cholinergic
      pathway, while the induction of enhanced antral contractile activity may be
      mediated via a pathway potentially involving activation of a muscular receptor.

TI  - The absolute bioavailability and effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of
      zolmitriptan in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 433-9
AB  - AIMS: Zolmitriptan (Zomig (formerly 311C90)) is a novel 5-HT1B/1D receptor
      agonist developed for the acute oral treatment of migraine. A highly sensitive
      LCMS-MS assay has been developed which allows quantification of plasma
      concentrations of zolmitriptan and its active metabolite, 183C91, after
      therapeutic doses. Two studies using this assay method were conducted to
      investigate the pharmacokinetics, including absolute bioavailability, of 2.5 and 
      5 mg oral doses of zolmitriptan in men and women, the dose-proportionality of
      2.5, 5 and 10 mg doses and the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of a 5 mg
      oral dose. METHODS: Two randomized, balanced, open-label, 4-period crossover
      studies were conducted in a total of 32 healthy volunteers. The first study
      determined the absolute bioavailability of 2.5 and 5 mg doses of zolmitriptan and
      compared the pharmacokinetics in men and women. The second study examined the
      dose-proportionality in pharmacokinetics after fasting doses of 2.5, 5 and 10 mg,
      and the effect of food on a 5 mg dose. Blood pressure, heart rate, ECG, clinical 
      chemistry, haematology and adverse events were also monitored. RESULTS: The mean 
      (s.d.) absolute oral bioavailability was 0.41 (0.14 and 0.40) 0.09 after 2.5 mg
      and 0.48+/-0.14 and 0.36+/-0.07 after 5 mg in women and men, respectively.
      Without adjustment for bodyweight, plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan, but not
      183C91, were higher in women than men. Mean (+/-s.d.) AUC was 32.7+/-10.1 and
      60.2+/-26.8 ng ml(-1) h after 5 mg in men and women, respectively (95% CI for
      ratio 0.43-0.77). After 2.5 mg mean (+/-s.d.) AUC was 18.4+/-5.4 and 23.1+/-9.9
      ng ml(-1) h in men and women, respectively (95% CI for ratio 0.61-1.09). However,
      these differences were of no clinical significance. Cmax and AUC of oral
      zolmitriptan were dose-proportional and there was a 13 and 16% fall in mean
      zolmitriptan Cmax and AUC, respectively, when administered after food. Adverse
      effects were minor, predominantly mild and transient, and there were no
      clinically significant effects on ECG, blood pressure, or laboratory parameters. 
      CONCLUSIONS: At therapeutic doses zolmitriptan has good oral bioavailability in
      healthy volunteers and has dose-proportional pharmacokinetics that are not
      affected by food to any clinically relevant extent.

TI  - Safety trial with the 5HT1B/1D agonist avitriptan (BMS-180048) in patients with
      migraine who have experienced pressure, tightness, and/or pain in the chest,
      neck, and/or throat following sumatriptan.
PG  - 546-51
AB  - We investigate whether symptoms of pressure, tightness, and/or pain in the chest,
      neck, and/or throat after administration of the 5HT1B/1D agonist avitriptan were 
      associated with objective impairment of the myocardial function on 12-lead
      electrocardiogram (ECG), continuous ECG (Holter) monitoring, and
      echocardiography. Migraine sufferers who in two-thirds of all attacks treated
      with sumatriptan had experienced chest/throat/neck symptoms were chosen for
      study. Baseline measures included vital signs, a 12-lead ECG and an
      echocardiogram. Patients (n = 51) who had no clinically significant abnormality
      at baseline received a high dose (150 mg) of avitriptan orally outside of a
      migraine attack. If pressure, tightness, and/or pain in the chest, neck, and/or
      throat occurred, an ECG was obtained, and a repeat echocardiogram was done while 
      the symptoms were present in order to monitor for impairment of myocardial
      function. If symptoms of these types did not occur within 60 min after
      administration of the study drug, a second echocardiogram was obtained.
      Forty-five patients (88%) reported at least one adverse event and 23 (45%)
      experienced pressure, tightness, and/or pain in the chest, neck, and/or throat
      after administration of avitriptan. No clinically significant myocardial
      abnormalities were observed in any patients, even in those who had experienced
      the targeted symptoms. No other serious adverse event occurred. We concluded that
      the typical 5HT1B/1D agonist-induced chest/throat/neck symptoms are most unlikely
      to be of cardiovascular origin.

TI  - Comparative clinical pharmacokinetics of single doses of sumatriptan following
      subcutaneous, oral, rectal and intranasal administration.
PG  - 99-104
AB  - Sumatriptan, a 5-HT1 receptor agonist active for the acute treatment of migraine,
      is currently available as subcutaneous injection and oral tablets. Rectal or
      intranasal formulations may offer advantages over those marketed. This study
      compared the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan via all four routes. Usual
      absorption parameters were described and the rate of absorption was assessed
      using deconvolution technics. There were no statistical differences between the
      non-parenteral routes for tmax or Cmax/AUCinfinity. However, Cmax and AUCtmax
      were statistically greater with the suppository than with the tablet, but there
      was no difference between intranasal and oral routes. The highest rate of
      absorption occurred earlier with the intranasal than with the oral route.
      Relative to the subcutaneous route, the bioavailability for the suppository was
      greater than for intranasal spray and oral tablet. The amount of sumatriptan
      excreted in the urine unchanged was similar for all routes. Sumatriptan in this
      study was well tolerated.

TI  - Sumatriptan nasal spray (20 mg/dose) in the acute treatment of cluster headache.
PG  - 487-9
AB  - Subcutaneous injection of sumatriptan is an effective treatment for attacks of
      cluster headache with a short onset of action. This open, randomized study
      evaluates whether sumatriptan nasal spray at its highest commercially available
      dose (20 mg/dose) is equally effective. In 26 patients, four consecutive attacks 
      were treated alternately with nasal spray and subcutaneous injection. Treatment
      was given within 5 min of onset of pain, and the time interval for the start and 
      completeness of pain relief, provided these occurred within 15 min of
      administration, were recorded by the patient. After completion of the study, the 
      patients were also asked to indicate which treatment they preferred, based on
      efficacy, side effects, and handling of the preparation. Forty-nine of the 52
      treatments with injection resulted in complete relief of pain within 15 min, with
      a mean of 9.6 min. The remaining three attacks were reduced by a mean of 86.7% at
      15 min. Only 7 of the 52 treatments with nasal spray in the nostril ipsilateral
      to pain resulted in complete relief within this time period, with a mean of 13.0 
      min. In 18 of these treatments pain was reduced by a mean of 42.2% at 15 min,
      whereas no effect on pain was obtained at this time in the remaining 27
      treatments. The effect was almost identical when the nasal spray was administered
      in the nostril on the non-painful side. As an overall judgement, only 2 of the 26
      patients preferred nasal spray to injection. We conclude that sumatriptan nasal
      spray 20 mg/dose is less effective than subcutaneous injection in relieving pain 
      in the great majority of cluster headache sufferers.

TI  - Effect of operationalized computer diagnosis on the therapeutic results of
      sumatriptan in general practice.
PG  - 481-6
AB  - A multicenter test was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the
      selective serotonin agonist sumatriptan in patients with the computerized
      headache diagnosis of migraine. A computer program was used for diagnostic
      evaluation of patients attending a general practice because of headache. The
      results of the analysis were taken as a direct decision on therapy. If the
      patients satisfied the criteria for migraine, they were given subcutaneous
      sumatriptan for treating three migraine attacks. The patients were able to use
      the study medication under outpatient conditions. The therapeutic efficacy of the
      medicine was recorded in a headache diary. A total of 91 patients were included
      in the study at 22 practices in Germany. An average of four patients per practice
      were recruited. In the first migraine attack treated, headache improvement was
      experienced by 77.7% of the patients treated. In the second and third attacks an 
      improvement was experienced by 93.5% and 89.8%, respectively. The results show
      that by optimizing diagnostic reliability with the aid of the computer program a 
      high response rate can be achieved under practice conditions using the selective 
      serotonin agonist sumatriptan. Since the computer program described permits a
      specific diagnosis, it improves the prospects of effective headache therapy in
      the individual patient. Thus treatment based on this approach can reduce inputs
      of time and money in migraine therapy.

TI  - Effect of subcutaneous naratriptan on forearm blood flow.
PG  - 476-80
AB  - This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, four-way crossover study was
      conducted on an in-clinic basis to assess forearm perfusion after subcutaneous
      (s.c.) naratriptan and placebo by reserve volume (hyperemic/baseline) and basal
      forearm blood flow (FBF) measured by strain gauge plethysmography. Nineteen male 
      and female volunteer migraine subjects (International Headache Society criteria) 
      received s.c. naratriptan 1 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, and placebo on four separate study
      days outside a migraine attack. FBF was recorded at baseline, at 7-min intervals 
      post-dose up to 1 h (basal) and once after sublingual glyceryl trinitrate
      administered at 1 h (hyperemic). Vital signs and electrocardiograms were recorded
      at baseline and 15, 30, 45, and 60 min post-dose. There were no statistically
      significant differences in reserve volume (hyperemic/baseline) between any dose
      of s.c. naratriptan and placebo. The naratriptan to placebo ratio was 102% (95%
      CI: 87-120%; p = 0.789) for 1 mg; 97% (95% CI: 83-114%, p = 0.737) for 5 mg; and 
      92% (95% CI: 79-108%; p = 0.325) for 10 mg. There were no statistically
      significant differences in basal FBF for any dose compared to placebo. The
      naratriptan to placebo ratio was 95% (95% CI: 87-104%; p = 0.263) for 1 mg; 94%
      (95% CI: 86-102%; p = 0.142) for 5 mg; and 94% (95% CI: 86-103%; p = 0.157) for
      10 mg. The percentage of patients reporting adverse events was 53% with placebo, 
      53% with s.c. naratriptan 1 mg, 89% with 5 mg and 89% with 10 mg. In conclusion, 
      these results suggest that s.c. naratriptan doses similar to and above the oral
      therapeutic dose equivalent (single oral dose 2.5 mg) have no significant effect 
      on peripheral blood flow as measured by FBF. S.c. naratriptan doses 1 mg, 5 mg,
      and 10 mg were well tolerated.

TI  - Effects of the antimigraine compound zolmitriptan ('Zomig') on psychomotor
      performance alone and in combination with diazepam in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 468-75
AB  - Zolmitriptan (Zomig) is a 5HT1B/1D agonist which has the ability to cross the
      intact blood-brain barrier to access central as well as peripheral receptors.
      Because of the potential for central nervous system side effects, this
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6-period crossover study evaluated 
      the effects of 2.5 and 5 mg doses of zolmitriptan on psychomotor performance and 
      investigated any pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic interaction with diazepam.
      Twelve healthy volunteers received the following "treatments" as single doses:
      zolmitriptan 2.5 mg, zolmitriptan 5 mg, diazepam 10 mg, zolmitriptan 2.5 mg +
      diazepam 10 mg, zolmitriptan 5 mg + diazepam 10 mg and placebo. Pre-dose and at
      1, 4, 8, and 24 h post-dose, the following validated battery of psychomotor tests
      was performed: Bond-Lader visual analogue scales (calmness, contentedness, and
      alertness factors), critical flicker fusion test, choice reaction time
      (recognition, motor, and total reaction times), finger-tapping test, number
      cancellation test and digit symbol substitution test. Plasma concentrations of
      zolmitriptan, its active metabolite, and diazepam and its active metabolites were
      measured at the same timepoints. Zolmitriptan 2.5 and 5 mg had no effect on
      psychomotor function when given alone. In contrast, diazepam 10 mg had profound
      effects, consistent with its sedative properties, but there was no synergism on
      concomitant administration of either dose of zolmitriptan. Plasma concentrations 
      of zolmitriptan, diazepam, and their respective active metabolites were similar
      when the two drugs were given alone or in combination.

TI  - Serotonergic synergism: the risks and benefits of combining the selective

PG  - 341-7
AB  - It has become common clinical practice to combine the selective serotonin
      reuptake inhibitors with other serotonergic agents for augmentation or adjunctive
      purposes. The empirical basis for using these combinations remains limited, but
      is growing. Also growing is a literature that suggests that even the most
      apparently benign combinations of serotonergic drugs carry at least some risk of 
      serious pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic drug interactions, such as a serotonin
      syndrome.

TI  - A placebo-controlled crossover study of rizatriptan in the treatment of multiple 
      migraine attacks. Rizatriptan Multiple Attack Study Group.
PG  - 773-81
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the safety and efficacy of rizatriptan 10 mg PO in the
      treatment of multiple migraine attacks. BACKGROUND: Rizatriptan is a potent and
      rapidly absorbed 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist. Efficacy and general safety have
      been examined in controlled trials treating single migraine attacks. In the
      current placebo-controlled study, we report constancy of safety and efficacy of
      rizatriptan for patients treating four discrete migraine attacks. METHODS:
      Patients with moderate or severe migraine (n = 473) were randomized to one of
      five sequence groups, in which each patient was to treat four migraine attacks.
      Patients in four groups received rizatriptan 10 mg for three of four attacks and 
      placebo for the remaining attack. Patients in the fifth group received
      rizatriptan 10 mg for four attacks. Headache severity, functional disability, and
      migraine symptoms were measured immediately before dosing and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 
      3, and 4 hours postdose. RESULTS: After the first attack, response rates were 77%
      for rizatriptan and 37% for placebo (p < 0.001). Similar efficacy of rizatriptan,
      ranging from a 75 to 80% response, was observed in each of the subsequent attacks
      with no evidence of tolerance to therapeutic effects. Most patients (93%)
      responded to rizatriptan 10 mg during the first or second attack. Adverse
      experiences were generally mild and transient, the most common being dizziness
      and somnolence. Incidence of adverse experiences per attack decreased after the
      first attack. CONCLUSIONS: Rizatriptan 10 mg PO is efficacious and generally well
      tolerated in acute migraine. Its efficacy is maintained throughout the treatment 
      of multiple, discrete migraine attacks.

TI  - Differences in perceived and presented adverse drug reactions in general
      practice.
PG  - 795-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postmarketing surveillance (PMS) studies are frequently based on data
      from general practitioners (GPs). Patients, however, do not always report to
      their GP suspected adverse drug reactions. SETTING: A postmarketing cohort study 
      on adverse reactions to sumatriptan, performed with assistance of drug dispensing
      GPs in The Netherlands. METHODS: Questionnaires were sent to all drug-dispensing 
      GPs in The Netherlands, as well as to their patients on sumatriptan. To avoid
      bias, no specific adverse reactions were mentioned in the questionnaires.
      RESULTS: Of the GPs, 589 (86%) responded; of the patients, 1202 (70%) responded. 
      The most frequently reported suspected adverse reactions to sumatriptan reported 
      by the GPs were dizziness (1.7%), nausea or vomiting (1.5%), drowsiness or
      sedation (1.4%), and chest pain (1.3%). The most frequently reported suspected
      adverse reactions by the patients were paraesthesia (11.7%), dizziness (8.1%),
      feeling of heaviness (8.0%), and chest pain (7.9%). Neither the GPs nor the
      patients reported serious adverse reactions. CONCLUSIONS: First, patients
      experience significantly more suspected adverse reactions than are registered by 
      their GP. In view of this higher frequency of reporting of suspected adverse
      reactions, postmarketing studies with data from GPs only, may underestimate the
      cumulative incidence of adverse reactions. Second, we conclude that it is
      possible to obtain useful additional information about adverse drug reactions
      from patients by sending them questionnaires via their GP.

TI  - Effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan.
PG  - 694-701
AB  - Zolmitriptan, an oral 5HT1D agonist for the acute treatment of migraine, is
      cleared from the systemic circulation mainly by hepatic metabolism. Consequently,
      changes in hepatic function may result in changes in the pharmacokinetics of
      zolmitriptan. This open, parallel-group study was conducted to compare the
      pharmacokinetics and tolerability of a single 10-mg dose of zolmitriptan in
      healthy subjects and patients with hepatic impairment. A total of 37 participants
      entered and completed the study, including 10 healthy volunteers, 11 patients
      with moderate hepatic impairment, 10 patients with severe hepatic impairment
      without ascites, and 6 patients with severe hepatic impairment with ascites. The 
      metabolism of zolmitriptan was reduced in patients with severe hepatic impairment
      compared with healthy subjects, resulting in higher peak plasma concentrations
      (47%), increased exposure (226%), and prolonged half-life (157%). The changes
      were similar in the presence and absence of ascites. Smaller changes were
      observed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Plasma concentrations of
      the three major metabolites of zolmitriptan were reduced in the patients with
      hepatic impairment. Patients with moderate hepatic impairment require no dosage
      adjustment, but the recommended daily intake of zolmitriptan may need to be
      reduced in patients with severe hepatic impairment.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of zolmitriptan in patients with mild to
      moderate hypertension: a double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 685-93
AB  - Zolmitriptan is a potent selective 5HT1B/1D receptor agonist for acute migraine
      therapy. Zolmitriptan has vasoconstrictor activity in cerebral vessels and may
      cause slight elevations of blood pressure in subjects without hypertension.
      Therefore, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of zolmitriptan (5, 10, and 
      20 mg) were evaluated in 16 patients with mild to moderate hypertension
      (controlled by hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg once daily) and 17 healthy age- and
      sex-matched control subjects in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind,
      four-period crossover study. The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its
      metabolites were dose proportional. Although area under the concentration-time
      curve (AUC0-infinity) and maximum concentration (Cmax) were slightly higher in
      patients with hypertension at all doses, this was only statistically significant 
      for AUC at the 20-mg dose. Differences between subjects with and without
      hypertension were not clinically significant. Zolmitriptan produced a small
      increase in blood pressure, but this was similar in subjects with and without
      hypertension and was of no clinical significance. Zolmitriptan was well tolerated
      in both groups. Zolmitriptan plasma concentrations were higher in women than in
      men, with higher values of AUC and Cmax and lower total clearance in women. These
      results indicate that zolmitriptan can be administered for treatment of migraine 
      in patients with controlled hypertension without dose adjustment.

AB  - We prospectively compared pregnancy outcome after exposure to sumatriptan with

      differences in the rates of live births, spontaneous abortions, therapeutic
      abortions, or major birth defects among the three groups. This first prospective

TI  - Consistency of response to sumatriptan nasal spray across patient subgroups and
      migraine types.
PG  - 273-7
AB  - With an onset of headache relief as early as 15 min postdose compared with
      placebo, sumatriptan nasal spray is an important treatment option for patients
      who seek rapid headache relief and/or a convenient dosing form, whose
      migraine-associated nausea and vomiting render the use of an oral medication
      impractical, and those who prefer not to use an injectable form of migraine
      medication. Although the efficacy and tolerability of sumatriptan nasal spray are
      documented, the consistency of response to sumatriptan nasal spray across patient
      subgroups and migraine subtypes of importance to the prescribing clinician have
      not been described. To provide this information, data from four randomized,
      double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multicenter studies (Glaxo
      Wellcome protocol numbers S2B-340, S2B-341, S2B-342, and S2B-T50), conducted
      between January 1993 and December 1994, were pooled and retrospectively analyzed 
      to determine whether the efficacy and tolerability of sumatriptan nasal spray
      vary with gender, ethnic origin, age, weight, migraine type, concomitant or prior
      medication use, or pretreatment headache duration.
      Two-thousand-three-hundred-and-ninety-five (2395) patients treated a moderate or 
      severe migraine with study medication in the four studies. The results
      demonstrate that sumatriptan nasal spray 20 mg and 10 mg were effective and well 
      tolerated in the acute treatment of migraine consistently across a variety of
      patient and migraine subgroups. No clinically significant differences in headache
      relief or adverse event rates were observed for any of the subgroups examined.
      Approximately two-thirds of patients treated with sumatriptan nasal spray 20 mg
      compared with approximately one-third of placebo-treated patients reported
      headache relief 2 h postdose regardless of patient or migraine subgroup. The
      relationship between active treatment and placebo with respect to the overall
      incidence of adverse events also did not differ between patient or migraine
      subgroups. There is no evidence based on this analysis that sumatriptan nasal
      spray dosage should be adjusted in any of the subgroups examined.

TI  - Dosing of oral sumatriptan: a review of our first 104 patients.
PG  - 349-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: The introduction of oral sumatriptan in the United States at doses of
      25 and 50 mg, compared with 100-mg tablets worldwide, has created the need to
      develop a protocol for appropriate dosing. METHODS: We evaluated the first 104
      patients in our practice to treat two migraine attacks with oral sumatriptan. For
      their first treatment with oral sumatriptan, patients were evaluated on their
      response to 25-mg tablets and the total number of tablets taken. For their second
      treatment, patients were evaluated on their response to sumatriptan, number of
      25-mg tablets taken, and dosage prescribed for future migraines. RESULTS: [table 
      see text] After the second treatment, 41 patients (40%) continued therapy with
      25-mg tablets, 54 (53%) were prescribed 50-mg tablets, 2 patients (2%) were
      prescribed two 50-mg tablets, and 5 patients (5%) were prescribed injectable
      sumatriptan. Seventy patients had previously used injectable sumatriptan, while
      34 had not previously used sumatriptan. There were no significant differences in 
      their response to oral sumatriptan. CONCLUSION: Oral sumatriptan was effective in
      clinical practice at doses of 25 and 50 mg. The majority of patients required
      more than one 25-mg tablet for a migraine attack, reflecting both inadequacy of
      dosing for some migraines and recurrence of headache, yet 40% of patients
      continued on treatment with 25-mg tablets. There were no significant differences 
      in response to therapy in patients being switched from injectable to oral
      sumatriptan compared with those initiating therapy with oral sumatriptan. Both
      tablet strengths of oral sumatriptan are useful in clinical practice.

TI  - Sumatriptan. An updated review of its use in migraine.
PG  - 889-922
AB  - Sumatriptan is a selective agonist at serotonin 5-HT1-like receptors, including
      5-HT1B/1D subtypes. It is an effective treatment for acute migraine attacks and
      the injectable form has also shown efficacy in the treatment of cluster
      headaches. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, sumatriptan, administered
      subcutaneously, orally, intranasally or rectally was significantly more effective
      than placebo in relieving migraine headache and in producing resolution or
      reduction of other symptoms associated with migraine, including nausea,
      photophobia and phonophobia. Improvements in clinical disability were also
      significantly greater after sumatriptan than after placebo. Headache recurred in 
      21 to 57% of patients who received oral or subcutaneous sumatriptan, but most
      patients responded to a second dose of the drug. Results of comparative trials
      showed that subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg was significantly more effective than
      either patients' usual antimigraine treatments or intranasal dihydroergotamine
      mesylate 1 mg in relieving migraine headache. Subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg and
      subcutaneous dihydroergotamine mesylate 1 mg provided similarly effective
      migraine relief, but the headache recurrence rate was significantly higher after 
      sumatriptan than after this formulation of dihydroergotamine mesylate. Response
      rates achieved after oral sumatriptan were similar to those reported after
      treatment with oral naratriptan, rizatriptan or lysine acetylsalicylate plus
      metoclopramide. Treatment of acute migraine attacks with oral or subcutaneous
      sumatriptan leads to less loss of workplace productivity than other antimigraine 
      therapies. Several pharmacoeconomic analyses showed that gains in workplace
      productivity in sumatriptan recipients ranged from 12.1 to 89.8 hours per patient
      per year. Significant improvements from baseline in overall health-related
      quality-of-life scores were also experienced by sumatriptan recipients.
      Sumatriptan is generally well tolerated. Nausea, vomiting, malaise and fatigue
      are the most common adverse events with oral sumatriptan. Injection site
      reactions occur in 10 to 40% of patients receiving the drug subcutaneously. A
      bitter taste at the back of the mouth occurs frequently after intranasal
      administration. Serious adverse events occur in about 0.14% of patients with
      migraine treated with sumatriptan. As the drug is associated with the rare
      development of cardiovascular effects, it is contraindicated in patients with a
      history of cardiovascular disease. CONCLUSIONS: Despite its relatively high
      acquisition cost, reductions in lost workplace productivity experienced by
      patients treated with sumatriptan may result in savings in the overall cost of
      migraine to society. Thus, sumatriptan is a useful first- or second-line
      treatment option for patients with moderate or severe migraine.

TI  - Episodic cluster headache in a community: clinical features and treatment.
PG  - 141-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical features and treatment given to episodic cluster
      headache patients in the Calgary region. PATIENTS: Fifty-one (51) patients who
      responded to a media campaign, had previously been diagnosed by their family
      physicians, and who met International Headache Society (IHS) criteria for
      episodic cluster headache, formed the population for this study. METHODS: The
      media campaign consisted of newspaper advertisements and radio publicity
      including physician interviews and talk shows. Patients were required to complete
      by 200-item questionnaire detailing clinical features and treatment of their
      cluster headache syndrome. Each patient was also interviewed by our research
      nurse for clarification and proper completion of questionnaire. RESULTS:
      Fifty-one percent (51%) of our patients had short headache attacks lasting one
      hour or less. Almost one-half (45%) had three or four attacks per 24 hour period.
      Eighty-six percent (86%) had been referred to a neurologist. Sixty-nine percent
      (69%) had never used oxygen, but of those who had, one-half were still using it. 
      Sumatriptan by injection had been tried by 26% of patients and of these, 93%
      considered it effective. Subcutaneous dihydroergotamine had been tried by 8%. For
      prophylaxis, 41% had tried methysergide, 31% prednisone, and 4% verapamil. Many
      patients had been prescribed migraine prophylactic drugs which are ineffective
      for cluster headache, and some had also undergone dental procedures or nasal and 
      sinus surgeries. CONCLUSIONS: Many cluster headache patients had not, to their
      knowledge, been prescribed or used the best symptomatic and prophylactic
      treatments for cluster headache. This should be addressed through educational
      programs and through making up-to-date information on the treatment of cluster
      headache readily available to physicians and patients.

TI  - Nitric oxide synthase inhibition: a new principle in the treatment of migraine
      attacks.
PG  - 27-32
AB  - Glyceryl trinitrate, an exogenous nitric oxide (NO) donor, and histamine, which
      causes NO formation in vascular endothelium, have been shown to trigger migraine 
      attacks. However, it remains uncertain whether NO is involved in the subsequent
      phase of migraine attacks. To answer this question we studied the effect of
      L-NGmethylarginine hydrochloride (546C88), a NO-synthase inhibitor, on
      spontaneous migraine attacks. In a double-blind study design, 18 patients with
      migraine without aura randomly received 546C88 (6 mg/kg) or placebo (5% dextrose)
      i.v. given over 15 min for a single migraine attack (546C88:placebo, 15:3).
      Furthermore, 11 placebo-treated patients from previous double-blind trials with
      almost identical design were added to the placebo group in the statistical
      evaluation. Two hours after the infusion, 10 of 15 L-NGmethylarginine
      hydrochloride-treated patients experienced headache relief compared to 2 of 14
      placebo-treated patients (p = 0.01). Symptoms such as phono- and photophobia were
      also significantly improved. A similar trend for nausea was not significant. We
      conclude that NO may be involved in the pain mechanisms throughout the course of 
      spontaneous migraine attacks.

TI  - Multiple-attack efficacy and tolerability of sumatriptan nasal spray in the
      treatment of migraine.
PG  - 234-40
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sumatriptan hemisulfate nasal spray may provide a useful therapeutic
      option for patients with migraine who find injectable medications inconvenient or
      uncomfortable and for patients whose migraine-associated nausea and vomiting
      preclude the use of oral medication. This study was the first US trial to
      evaluate the effects of sumatriptan nasal spray administered for multiple
      migraine attacks. DESIGN/INTERVENTIONS: Sumatriptan nasal spray (5, 10, or 20 mg)
      was administered via a 1-shot nasal applicator into either nostril for up to 3
      migraine attacks occurring over 6 months in a randomized, double-blind,
      parallel-group, placebo-controlled study. SETTING: Fifty-six outpatient clinical 
      centers in the United States. PATIENTS: A total of 1086 men and women diagnosed
      with migraine with or without aura per International Headache Society criteria.
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Percentage of patients with headache relief (moderate or
      severe predose pain reduced to mild or none); percentage of patients with no or
      mild (vs moderate or severe) clinical disability; percentage of patients with
      nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia; adverse events; clinical
      laboratory test results. RESULTS: Across attacks, headache relief in the 20-,
      10-, and 5-mg drug and placebo groups was experienced 120 minutes postdose by
      60%, 54%, 44%, and 32% of patients, respectively (P<.05 for each sumatriptan
      nasal spray group vs placebo, for the 10-mg vs 5-mg drug group, and for the 20-mg
      vs 5-mg drug group). Two thirds of the 20-mg patients treating 3 attacks
      experienced relief at 2 hours postdose for at least 2 of 3 attacks. Clinical
      disability scores at 120 minutes in the 20-, 10-, and 5-mg drug and placebo
      groups reflected no or mild impairment in 70%, 67%, 57%, and 50% of patients,
      respectively (P<.05 for the 10- or 20-mg drug group vs placebo group, and for the
      20-mg vs 5- mg drug group). Similar efficacy rates were observed for nausea,
      photophobia, and phonophobia. For all parameters, individual-attack efficacy
      rates did not differ from across-attack rates. The incidence of adverse events
      was not dose related. The most frequently reported adverse event in the active
      treatment groups was taste disturbance (bad, bitter, or unpleasant). CONCLUSIONS:
      Sumatriptan hemisulfate nasal spray (5, 10, or 20 mg) is effective and well
      tolerated in the treatment of multiple migraine attacks. The 20-mg dose was
      associated with the highest efficacy rates across the greatest number of
      parameters.

TI  - Melatonin-responsive headache in delayed sleep phase syndrome: preliminary
      observations.
PG  - 303-7
AB  - The occurrence of headache and its change after treatment with melatonin 5 mg
      were studied in 30 patients with delayed sleep phase syndrome. The medication was
      taken 5 hours before the endogenous nocturnal plasma melatonin concentration had 
      reached 10 pg/mL. Three women (aged 14, 14, and 23 years) suffered from chronic
      tension-type headache. Their headache disappeared within 2 weeks after the start 
      of treatment with melatonin. One 54-year-old man suffered from disabling migraine
      attacks without aura, twice a week. After starting melatonin treatment, only
      three migraine attacks were reported in 12 months. Ever since his 40s, a
      60-year-old man complained of cluster headache episodes lasting about 2 months,
      twice a year. In the year since starting melatonin treatment, only one 5-day
      cluster episode occurred. Nocturnal melatonin secretion in the patients with
      delayed sleep phase syndrome and headache did not differ significantly from that 
      in the patients with the sleep disorder but without headache. Melatonin may be
      helpful in patients with headache who are suffering from delayed sleep phase
      syndrome. Its effectiveness may be due to modification of vascular and
      nociceptive systems or to its chronobiological action which adjusts the patient's
      biological clock to his/her life-style.

TI  - Rizatriptan (MAXALT) for the acute treatment of migraine and migraine recurrence.
      A placebo-controlled, outpatient study. Rizatriptan 022 Study Group.
PG  - 281-7
AB  - Rizatriptan is a novel 5-HT1B/1D agonist which is rapidly absorbed after oral
      administration. The efficacy and tolerability of oral rizatriptan (5 mg and 10
      mg) were examined in this multicenter, double-blind, outpatient study of 1473
      migraineurs which featured randomized, placebo-controlled treatment of migraine
      recurrences. On experiencing moderate or severe migraine headaches, patients
      rated headache severity prior to dosing and at 30-minute intervals for 2 hours
      after dosing. Onset of effect was seen as early as 30 minutes after dosing with
      rizatriptan 10 mg. At 2 hours postdose, the percentage of patients with pain
      relief was significantly higher after rizatriptan 5 mg (62%) or 10 mg (71%)
      compared with placebo (35%). Complete relief was also significantly higher after 
      rizatriptan 5 mg (33%) and 10 mg (42%) compared with placebo (10%). In patients
      experiencing headache recurrence after initial benefit, further relief was
      obtained in 71% with rizatriptan 5 mg (placebo 54%) and in 82% with rizatriptan
      10 mg (placebo 44%). Complete relief of recurrent headache was obtained in 36%
      with rizatriptan 5 mg, 49% with rizatriptan 10 mg, and 15% with placebo (P <
      0.05). The most common drug-related adverse experiences were dizziness,
      somnolence, asthenia/fatigue, and nausea (the incidences of which were low and
      dose related). There was no increase in the incidence of adverse experiences
      after use of up to three doses of rizatriptan within 24 hours. We conclude that
      both doses of rizatriptan are effective and well tolerated in the acute treatment
      of migraine and migraine recurrence, with the 10-mg dose preferred as it is more 
      effective with a faster onset of action.

TI  - Practicability and acceptance of subcutaneous self-administration of the
      selective serotonin agonist sumatriptan.
PG  - 267-9
AB  - To cater to the special situation of much reduced oral bioavailability which
      occurs in severe migraine attacks with pronounced nausea and vomiting,
      sumatriptan can also be used in a subcutaneous form that can be
      self-administered. The aim of this study was to analyze the practicability and
      acceptance of a method of self-administration ("Glaxo-Pen") for treatment of
      severe migraine attacks by subcutaneous injection of sumatriptan. The Glaxo-Pen
      was compared with the conventional autoinjector for subcutaneous administration
      of sumatriptan. The multicenter study was conducted under practical conditions by
      150 office-based physicians in Germany. Patients who commonly suffered from
      severe migraine attacks were given a careful explanation of how to use the device
      ("Glaxo-Pen") for self-administration of subcutaneous sumatriptan and were able
      to practice using it under guidance. They were given a Glaxo-Pen with two
      sumatriptan refills to take with them for treating their own migraine attacks.
      The patients used a headache diary to document administration outside the
      practice session. A total of 376 patients were included in the study. The major
      findings were that 80% of the patients rated the Glaxo-Pen "very easy" or "easy" 
      to use, and only 6.4% rated it "difficult" or "very difficult." Compared with the
      conventional autoinjector, the Glaxo-Pen was rated "much better" or "better" by
      77.9% of patients. Only 8.5% considered the Glaxo-Pen "worse" or "much worse"
      than the conventional autoinjector. The figures show that the great majority of
      patients found it easy to use sumatriptan for treating severe migraine attacks by
      self-administration under practical conditions. Thus, especially for patients who
      suffer from severe nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea during migraine attacks, this
      method of delivery is an easily used means of arresting migraine attacks.

TI  - Sumatriptan injection reduces productivity loss during a migraine attack: results
      of a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 1013-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of sumatriptan succinate injection compared
      with placebo on productivity loss during a migraine attack in the workplace.
      DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical
      trial. SETTING: Fifteen clinical centers in the United States. PATIENTS: One
      hundred thirty-five patients 18 years and older diagnosed as having migraine
      according to International Headache Society criteria. INTERVENTIONS: Patients
      self-administered sumatriptan injection (6 mg) or matching placebo to treat a
      moderate or severe migraine occurring within the first 4 hours of a minimum
      8-hour work shift. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mean productivity loss 2 hours after
      dosing and across the work shift; percentages of patients returning to normal
      work performance within 2 hours after dosing and across the work shift;
      percentages of patients experiencing headache relief (reduction of moderate or
      severe predose pain to mild or no pain) 1 and 2 hours after dosing. RESULTS: Mean
      productivity loss was significantly (P< or =.002) lower in the sumatriptan group 
      compared with the placebo group both during the 2-hour postdose period
      (sumatriptan, 39 minutes; placebo, 54 minutes) and across the work shift
      (sumatriptan, 86 minutes; placebo, 168 minutes). Significantly (P<.001) greater
      percentages of patients in the sumatriptan group compared with the placebo group 
      returned to normal work performance by 2 hours after dosing (sumatriptan, 52%;
      placebo, 9%) and across the work shift (sumatriptan, 66%; placebo, 18%).
      Significantly (P< or =.001) greater percentages of patients in the sumatriptan
      group compared with the placebo group experienced headache relief 1 hour after
      dosing (sumatriptan, 69%; placebo, 18%) and 2 hours after dosing (sumatriptan,
      79%; placebo, 32%). CONCLUSION: Sumatriptan reduced migraine-associated
      productivity loss during a minimum 8-hour work shift by approximately 50%
      compared with placebo and alleviated headache in more than three fourths of
      patients.

TI  - MSQ: Migraine-Specific Quality-of-Life Questionnaire. Further investigation of
      the factor structure.
PG  - 707-17
AB  - MSQ, the 16-item Migraine-Specific Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (Version 1.0),
      was developed by Glaxo Wellcome Inc. to assess the effect of migraine and its
      treatment on patients' health-related quality of life (HR-QOL). The MSQ was
      hypothesised to measure 3 meaningful dimensions: (i) Role Function-Restrictive;
      (ii) Role Function-Preventive; and (iii) Emotional Function. The objective of
      this research was to further investigate the number of dimensions as well as the 
      items contained in each dimension through principal components factor analysis of
      clinical trial data. Secondary objectives were to determine whether the factor
      structure changed in post-treatment visits compared with screening visits, to
      make recommendations for coding the MSQ when the patient did not have a migraine 
      in the previous 4 weeks, and to modify the MSQ if so indicated by this research. 
      Results supported the existence of 3 distinct factors which agreed strongly with 
      the hypothesised dimensions. The analysis of post-treatment data suggested that
      the underlying factor structure of the MSQ varies as a result of treatment. Based
      on evaluations of the 'did not have a migraine' response, it was concluded that
      it be dropped from the MSQ. All these changes have been incorporated into MSQ
      (Version 2.0) which is being evaluated in studies to determine if its
      psychometric properties are different than the properties of the previous
      version.

TI  - Tolfenamic acid rapid release versus sumatriptan in the acute treatment of
      migraine: comparable effect in a double-blind, randomized, controlled,
      parallel-group study.
PG  - 201-7
AB  - The efficacy and safety of tolfenamic acid and oral sumatriptan in the acute
      treatment of migraine was studied at five neurological centers in Finland. One
      hundred forty-one patients experiencing 289 migraine attacks, fulfilling the
      diagnostic criteria for migraine with or without aura as defined by the
      International Headache Society, were randomized. For first attacks, 77% of
      patients receiving tolfenamic acid experienced a reduction of the initial severe 
      or moderate headache to mild or no headache after 2 hours, as compared to 79% in 
      the sumatriptan group and 29% in the placebo group. No significant difference was
      found between active treatments (P = 0.85, 95% CI [-22%, 18%]), however, both
      active treatments were significantly better than placebo; P = 0.001, 95% CI (26%,
      69%) for tolfenamic acid and P = 0.001, 95% CI (28%, 71%) for sumatriptan. For
      second attacks, results were similar with 70% of patients receiving tolfenamic
      acid experiencing relief, as compared to 64% in the sumatriptan group and 39% in 
      the placebo group. No significant differences were observed in accompanying
      symptoms. Both drugs were well tolerated with the frequency of adverse events;
      30% for tolfenamic acid and 41% for sumatriptan, a nonsignificant difference. In 
      this study, tolfenamic acid and oral sumatriptan are comparably effective in the 
      acute treatment of migraine. When comparably effective, factors like individual
      effect, tolerance, and cost of treatment should be considered when prescribing
      migraine medication.

TI  - Chronic paroxysmal hemicrania and hemicrania continua: lack of efficacy of
      sumatriptan.
PG  - 197-200
AB  - Attacks of chronic paroxysmal hemicrania are prevented by the continuous
      administration of indomethacin. Sumatriptan, an agonist of 5-HT1-like receptors, 
      has proven effective in the treatment of cluster headache attacks. There are
      clear clinical similarities between chronic paroxysmal hemicrania and cluster
      headache. A natural consequence of these considerations would be to establish
      whether chronic paroxysmal hemicrania also responds similarly to sumatriptan.
      Since hemicrania continua is another unilateral headache responsive to
      indomethacin, it would be meaningful to also include hemicrania continua in such 
      a study. Sumatriptan, 6 mg subcutaneous, was tried in an open fashion in 7
      patients (6 women and 1 man) with chronic paroxysmal hemicrania and 7 patients (5
      women and 2 men) with hemicrania continua. In chronic paroxysmal hemicrania, the 
      mean interval between the last three attacks prior to sumatriptan treatment (40
      +/- 23 minutes) was not statistically different from the mean interval between
      the three attacks subsequent to sumatriptan treatment of an attack (32 +/- 20
      minutes). In none of the patients did the mean duration of the "test attack"
      decrease as compared to the attacks antedating the test attack (25 +/- 11 minutes
      and 19 +/- 9 minutes, respectively) (P = 0.027, Wilcoxon). In 2 patients with
      chronic paroxysmal hemicrania, placebo (saline) administration did not lead to
      any change in the interval between attacks. There was a mild, but statistically
      significant reduction in visual analog scale values for headache intensity in
      hemicrania continua (P = 0.04, Wilcoxon). There was no clear, i.e., clinically
      meaningful, reduction in visual analog scale values in any particular patient
      with hemicrania continua. Taken together, these results seem to show that
      sumatriptan is of no benefit in chronic paroxysmal hemicrania, but may have a
      partial efficacy in hemicrania continua. However, the latter effect is clinically
      unimportant. This minor difference in regard to the clinical effect may,
      nevertheless, be of some interest pathogenetically, indicating minor differences 
      between the two headaches. The lack of sumatriptan effect in chronic paroxysmal
      hemicrania clearly and markedly strengthens the nonalignment concept in regard to
      chronic paroxysmal hemicrania and cluster headache.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of sumatriptan tablets (25 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg) in the
      acute treatment of migraine: defining the optimum doses of oral sumatriptan.
PG  - 184-90
AB  - That sumatriptan tablets are effective and well tolerated in the acute treatment 
      of migraine has been established, but the relationship between dose and efficacy 
      has not been adequately defined to date in clinical trials. This multinational
      double-blind trial (N = 1003) in which patients treated up to three migraine
      attacks with sumatriptan 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, or placebo, with a second
      independently randomized dose for headache recurrence, evaluated the efficacy and
      tolerability of three doses of sumatriptan. The results demonstrate that all
      doses of sumatriptan were superior (P < 0.05) to placebo in reducing moderate or 
      severe predose headache to mild or no headache 4 hours postdose for each of the
      three treated attacks; sumatriptan 50 mg and 100 mg were each superior (P < 0.05)
      to sumatriptan 25 mg 4 hours postdose for two of three attacks. Sumatriptan (all 
      doses) was similarly effective at relieving nausea and photophobia or phonophobia
      or both and at reducing clinical disability. Headache recurrence was experienced 
      by similar proportions of patients across treatment groups (35% to 48% after
      placebo; 26% to 39% after sumatriptan). Relief of recurrent headache 2 hours
      after the second dose of study medication occurred in greater percentages of
      patients using any dose of sumatriptan compared with patients using placebo to
      treat recurrence. The incidence of adverse events with 25-mg and 50-mg
      sumatriptan tablets was similar to the incidence with placebo and lower than the 
      incidence with 100-mg sumatriptan tablets. These data provide the first
      demonstration from a large well-controlled clinical trial that both the 50- and
      100-mg doses are more effective than the 25-mg dose and that the 50-mg dose is
      associated with a lower incidence of adverse events than the 100-mg dose.

      the acute treatment of migraine. An international study. The International 311C90
      Long-term Study Group.
PG  - 173-83
AB  - This international open-label study evaluated the tolerability and efficacy of
      zolmitriptan (Zomig, 311C90), a selective 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist, in the
      long-term treatment of multiple migraine attacks. Patients who had previously
      participated in placebo-controlled zolmitriptan studies were recruited. A total
      of 2058 patients treated 31,579 migraine attacks (average 15 per patient), for up
      to 1 year. Twenty-six percent of attacks treated with a single zolmitriptan 5-mg 
      dose were associated with at least one adverse event (24% treated with two
      doses). The most frequent adverse events included asthenia (14% of patients),
      nausea (12%), somnolence (10%), dizziness (11%), and paresthesia (11%). The rank 
      order of the most common adverse events was not influenced by sex, age, or number
      of zolmitriptan doses taken and was similar between attacks 1 and 45. The
      majority of adverse events (59%) occurred within 2 hours of dosing, were of
      either mild (59%) or moderate (35%) intensity, of 4 hours' duration or less
      (67%), and required no further action (94%). Following an initial 5-mg dose of
      zolmitriptan, the 2-hour headache response rate (reduction in headache pain from 
      moderate or severe before treatment to mild or no pain at 2 hours posttreatment) 
      was 81% in patients treating moderate and severe attacks (19,639 of 24,161).
      Patients were pain-free at 2 hours in 55% of all attacks (16,510 of 29,808). The 
      efficacy of zolmitriptan was not influenced by age, sex, weight, use of
      prophylactic antimigraine medication, or association of attacks with
      menstruation. Analysis of the overall population and a subgroup who treated 30 or
      more migraine attacks showed that zolmitriptan was consistently effective across 
      attacks. Overall, 67% of patients who treated five or more attacks reported
      zolmitriptan to be effective in 80% to 100% of attacks. Zolmitriptan produced
      meaningful migraine relief and improvement in normal activity impairment in 73%
      and 78% of moderate and severe attacks, respectively. Patients treated recurrence
      of moderate or severe headache with a second zolmitriptan dose in 32% of attacks 
      which responded to the first dose within 2 hours. Where required, a second
      zolmitriptan 5-mg dose for treatment of recurrence produced a headache response
      rate of 90% at 2 hours postdose. Thus, zolmitriptan 5 mg (plus an optional second
      5-mg dose for treatment of recurrence) is well tolerated and effective in the
      acute treatment of multiple migraine attacks over periods up to 1 year.

TI  - Sumatriptan suppositories for the acute treatment of migraine. S2B351 Study
      Group.
PG  - 31-5
AB  - A randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial was
      undertaken to assess the efficacy and tolerability of the sumatriptan suppository
      in 184 patients with acute migraine. Patients used a sumatriptan suppository
      (12.5 mg or 25 mg) or placebo at home for the treatment of a moderate or severe
      migraine attack and those who experienced headache recurrence within 24 hours of 
      dosing had the option to repeat the dose. By 2 hours post-dose, 68% of patients
      in the sumatriptan 25 mg group and 47% of patients in the sumatriptan 12.5 mg
      group compared with 25% of placebo patients achieved headache relief. Relief
      rates 2 hours post-dose for nausea, vomiting, photophobia and phonophobia were
      similar to those reported 2 hours post-dose for headache. Post hoc review of the 
      recurrence data showed that administration of a second suppository was effective 
      in alleviating recurrent headache in over 80% of the sumatriptan-treated patients
      experiencing recurrence. No serious or unusual adverse events were reported, and 
      the pattern and incidence of adverse events did not vary as a function of dose.
      These data demonstrate that the sumatriptan suppository is a well-tolerated,
      effective treatment for the acute treatment of migraine pain and its associated
      symptoms.

TI  - Trigeminal neuralgia with lacrimation or SUNCT syndrome?
PG  - 85-90
AB  - An intimate relationship between trigeminal neuralgia (TN) and short-lasting
      unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing 
      (SUNCT) syndrome, based on similar clinical signs and symptoms and on cases
      demonstrating possible "transformation" from one entity to the other, has been
      widely accepted. We evaluated the presence of lacrimation in 22 consecutive cases
      that had been diagnosed as TN. Ipsilateral lacrimation was reported by 6 such
      cases (5M, 1F). These cases responded to antineuralgic therapy with concomitant
      resolution of lacrimation and were clinically very similar to TN. The
      differential diagnosis and the possibility of lacrimation in TN are discussed.

TI  - Experimental cranial pain elicited by capsaicin: a PET study.
PG  - 61-6
AB  - Using a positron emission tomography (PET) study it was shown recently that in
      migraine without aura certain areas in the brain stem were activated during the
      headache state, but not in the headache free interval. It was suggested that this
      brain stem activation is inherent to the migraine attack itself and represents
      the so called 'migraine generator'. To test this hypothesis we performed an
      experimental pain study in seven healthy volunteers, using the same positioning
      in the PET scanner as in the migraine patients. A small amount of capsaicin was
      administered subcutaneously in the right forehead to evoke a burning painful
      sensation in the first division of the trigeminal nerve. Increases of regional
      cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were found bilaterally in the insula, in the anterior 
      cingulate cortex, the cavernous sinus and the cerebellum. Using the same
      stereotactic space limits as in the above mentioned migraine study no brain stem 
      activation was found in the acute pain state compared to the pain free state. The
      increase of activation in the region of the cavernous sinus however, suggests
      that this structure is more likely to be involved in trigeminal transmitted pain 
      as such, rather than in a specific type of headache as was suggested for cluster 
      headache.

TI  - Actions of the 5-hydroxytryptamine 1 receptor agonist sumatriptan on
      interdigestive gastrointestinal motility in man.
PG  - 36-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pharmacological studies of the enteric nervous system have shown the 
      presence of several subtypes of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) receptor, which might
      be involved in control of the migrating motor complex. AIMS: To study the effect 
      of sumatriptan, an agonist of enteric neuronal 5HT1p receptors, on interdigestive
      motility in man. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In 12 healthy subjects, interdigestive
      motility was recorded manometrically in the upper gastrointestinal tract. In
      seven subjects blood samples were drawn every 15 minutes for radioimmunoassay of 
      motilin and somatostatin. After two phase 3s of the migrating motor complex, 6 mg
      of sumatriptan was administered subcutaneously. Recording continued until two
      more phase 3s had occurred. RESULTS: Sumatriptan induced a premature phase 3 in
      the jejunum after a median of 10 (8) minutes. The duration of the migrating motor
      complex cycle was shortened at the expense of phase 2. After sumatriptan, plasma 
      somatostatin concentrations were reduced and gastric phase 3s were suppressed,
      although median motilin concentrations and the occurrence of plasma motilin peaks
      were not affected. Phase 3s of the migrating motor complex preceding sumatriptan 
      were associated with motilin peaks, while phase 3s after sumatriptan were not.
      Furthermore, pretreatment with sumatriptan prevented the induction of a gastric
      phase 3 by the motilin agonist erythromycin. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of the
      5HT1P receptor agonist sumatriptan induces a premature intestinal phase 3,
      suppresses gastric phase 3s, prevents induction of a gastric phase 3 by
      erythromycin, and reduces plasma somatostatin concentrations.

TI  - Monitoring of acute migraine attacks: placebo response and safety data.
PG  - 35-8
AB  - In the course of evaluating the safety and efficacy of an investigational
      compound for acute migraine headaches, a large number of patients received
      placebo at a single site, offering the opportunity to characterize subjective and
      clinical physiologic responses of migraine patients to placebo in a controlled
      environment. In a single-site, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 67
      patients reported to the clinic while suffering a moderate to severe acute
      migraine headache and received oral placebo. For 6 hours after treatment, a
      continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed, and headache severity, adverse 
      events, and vital signs were recorded. Patients returned and repeated the
      procedure when free from pain. A headache was considered to be improved if its
      severity dropped to "mild" or "none." Twenty-five patients (37%; 95% CI: 26% to
      50%) experienced headache improvement within 2 hours of receiving placebo, and 32
      patients (48%: 36% to 60%) improved within 4 hours. There were no clinically
      important ECG changes during the migraine visit, and there were no clinically
      relevant differences in vital signs between the migraine and pain-free visits.
      Thus, a substantial placebo response occurs in migraine headache. Hemodynamic and
      ECG parameters are unchanged between migraine and pain-free states.

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND MATERIAL: In the Hospital Clinico Quirurgico Hermanos
      Almeijeiras a randomized double blind clinical trial was carried out involving 52
      patients who presented with painful migraine crises with or without prodromes. A 
      group of 27 patients were given 6 mg of sumatriptan subcutaneously. Another group
      of 25 patients were given 1 mg of dihydroergotamine intramuscularly. It was seen 
      that both drugs relieved the migrainous pain. However, sumatriptan did so in a
      greater percentage of patients. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: There was earlier, and
      also more complete, relief of pain in those patients receiving sumatriptan. With 
      regard to side-effects of sumatriptan were pain at the back of the site of
      injection, sensation of pressure at the back of the neck, facial flushing and
      asthenia.

TI  - Sumatriptan contraindications and the serotonin syndrome.
PG  - 33-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk for serotonin syndrome associated with the
      concomitant use of sumatriptan and the currently contraindicated therapies, that 
      is, the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), serotonin selective-reuptake
      inhibitors (SSRIs), and lithium. METHODOLOGY: A comprehensive search for reports 
      of serotonin syndrome associated with sumatriptan use was conducted by using
      tertiary drug interaction literature, MEDLINE, EmBASE, Biological Abstracts,
      Current Contents, Reactions, ClinAlert, and the International Pharmaceutical
      Abstracts. In addition, related reports from the proprietary manufacturers, the
      Health Protection Branch of Health Canada, and the World Health Organization
      Collaborative Centre for International Drug Monitoring were also solicited.
      RESULTS: The concurrent use of sumatriptan with an SSRI or lithium has been
      reported to cause symptoms suggestive of serotonin syndrome in 16 and 2 cases,
      respectively. There were no reports involving MAOIs. In general, the reports
      indicated a mild-to-moderate, self-limited course with some features consistent
      with the serotonin syndrome. We found published reports of sumatriptan use
      without adverse events involving 148 patients receiving SSRIs, 31 patients taking
      MAOIs, and a small number using lithium. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical evidence
      supporting the strict contraindication of MAOIs, SSRIs and lithium was not
      identified. The balance of documented clinical experience pertaining to the use
      of sumatriptan concurrently with SSRIs or lithium suggests that most patients
      tolerate this combination without incident. Because there is little reliable
      experience with sumatriptan in combination with MAOIs, we suggest that
      sumatriptan should continue to be avoided in patients taking these agents until
      further data demonstrating safety become available.

TI  - The interaction between propranolol and the novel antimigraine agent zolmitriptan
      (311C90).
PG  - 595-9
AB  - AIMS: Zolmitriptan (Zomig, formerly known as 311C90), a selective 5HT1B/1D
      agonist is under development as an acute oral treatment for migraine. Despite the
      use of prophylactic medication, such as propranolol, breakthrough attacks often
      occur in patients. Consequently we investigated the effects of propranolol on the
      pharmacokinetics of, and cardiovascular responses to, zolmitriptan. METHODS: A
      double-blind, randomized, crossover study of the effects of pre-treatment with
      propranolol 160 mg daily for 7 days or placebo on the pharmacokinetics and
      effects on blood pressure of a single 10 mg dose of zolmitriptan in 12 healthy
      volunteers. RESULTS: Propranolol increased mean zolmitriptan Cmax and AUC by 56% 
      and 37% respectively; mean t1/2 was prolonged from 3.1 to 4.0 h. Mean Cmax and
      AUC of the pharmacologically active N-desmethyl metabolite were reduced by 24%
      and 11% respectively and the metabolite:parent AUC ratio (AUCm/AUCp) fell from
      0.46 to 0.26. Mean Cmax and AUC for the inactive indole acetic acid metabolite
      were both reduced by 13% and AUCm/AUCp from 1.04 to 0.59. A small pressor effect 
      of short duration was observed following zolmitriptan with mean peak rises of 13 
      and 11 mmHg in systolic and diastolic pressures respectively; propranolol had no 
      effect on the pressor response. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that propranolol
      inhibits biotransformation of zolmitriptan but with no change in the small
      pressor response to zolmitriptan. It is therefore unlikely that the
      pharmacokinetic changes will lead to clinically important changes in
      pharmacological effects and dosage adjustment of zolmitriptan is not required in 
      patients taking propranolol for migraine prophylaxis.

AB  - A validated migraine-specific questionnaire (24-h Migraine Quality of Life
      Questionnaire: 24-h MQoLQ) was used to assess the impact of migraine and migraine
      therapy on health-related quality of life during an acute migraine attack. Male
      and female migraineurs aged 18-55 years were randomized to placebo (n=41),
      rizatriptan 2.5 mg (n=47), 5 mg (n=74), or 10 mg (n=85) in a triple-blind,
      placebo-controlled clinical trial. Rizatriptan 5 mg and 10 mg were significantly 
      more efficacious than placebo on pain relief and functional disability. After
      accounting for multiple comparisons to placebo, rizatriptan 10 mg showed
      significantly better responses compared to placebo on three of five domains of
      24-h MQoLQ (social functioning, migraine symptoms, and feelings/concerns). The
      O'Brien's Rank Sum Test statistic showed a statistically significant overall
      difference on the 24-h MQoLQ between the 10 mg rizatriptan and placebo groups
      (p=0.005) and for the overall dose trend (p< or =0.001).

TI  - Intensity dependence of the cortical auditory evoked potentials as a surrogate
      marker of central nervous system serotonin transmission in man: demonstration of 
      a central effect for the 5HT1B/1D agonist zolmitriptan (311C90, Zomig).
PG  - 849-54; discussion 799
AB  - As shown in animal studies, 5HT1B/D agonists can inhibit activity in the
      trigeminal nucleus caudalis, which may be advantageous for their antimigraine
      effect. To demonstrate a possible central nervous system (CNS) action of these
      compounds in man we studied their effect on the intensity dependence of the
      cortical auditory evoked potentials (IDAPs), thought to be inversely related to
      central serotonergic transmission. An amplitude/stimulus intensity function (ASF)
      slope was computed in healthy volunteers and migraine patients between attacks
      before and 2 h after oral 311C90 (zolmitriptan "Zomig") 10 mg (n=14), 311C90 5 mg
      (n=7), sumatriptan 100 mg (n=14), dexfenfluramine 15 mg (n=4), lorazepam 1.25 mg 
      (n=4) and placebo (n=14). 311C90 10 mg and, to a lesser degree, 5 mg
      significantly increased the mean ASF slope (p=0.007 and 0.05 vs placebo). There
      was a significant positive correlation between plasma levels of 311C90 and ASF
      slope changes. Sumatriptan and lorazepam had little effect, but dexfenfluramine
      produced a significant ASF slope decrease. 311C90 is able to modify a CNS
      activity that is modulated by serotonin, i.e. the IDAP. This effect is probably
      the consequence of its superior lipophilicity compared to sumatriptan and of
      activation of prejunctional 5HT1B/D autoreceptors, which lowers central serotonin
      release and thus the preactivation level of sensory cortices.

      Results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Naratriptan 
      S2WA3001 Study Group.
PG  - 640-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of naratriptan, a novel
      5-HT1 agonist, in the acute treatment of migraine. DESIGN/METHODS: Six hundred
      thirteen migraineurs, diagnosed according to International Headache Society
      criteria, treated a single migraine attack with naratriptan tablets (2.5 mg, 1
      mg, 0.25 mg, or 0.1 mg) or placebo in a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group study conducted at 54 United States centers.
      At dosing and at predetermined intervals beginning 30 minutes postdose, patients 
      recorded migraine pain severity, clinical disability, and presence of associated 
      migraine symptoms. Safety measures included adverse events, physical
      examinations, vital signs, ECGs, and clinical laboratory tests. RESULTS: Headache
      relief (moderate or severe pain at dosing reduced to mild or no pain) 4 hours
      postdose was reported in 60% of patients receiving naratriptan 2.5 mg compared
      with 50%, 35%, 32%, and 34% of patients receiving naratriptan 1 mg, 0.25 mg, 0.1 
      mg, and placebo, respectively (P < 0.05 naratriptan 2.5 mg and 1 mg versus
      placebo, 1 mg versus 0.1 mg, and 2.5 mg versus 0.1 mg and 0.25 mg). Clinical
      disability 4 hours postdose was reported as mild or none for 70% of patients
      receiving naratriptan 2.5 mg compared with 63%, 47%, 48%, and 48% of patients
      receiving naratriptan 1 mg, 0.25 mg, 0.1 mg, or placebo, respectively (P < 0.05
      naratriptan 2.5 mg and 1 mg versus placebo, 1 mg versus 0.1 mg, and 2.5 mg versus
      0.1 mg and 0.25 mg). Four-hour efficacy for absence of nausea, photophobia, and
      phonophobia was similar to efficacy for headache relief at each dose. The adverse
      event profile of each dose of naratriptan was similar to that of placebo. No
      clinically relevant change in any safety measure was reported. CONCLUSIONS:
      Naratriptan is effective and well tolerated for the acute treatment of migraine. 
      The 2.5-mg dose appears to offer the optimum ratio of efficacy to tolerability.

PG  - 1485-90
AB  - The efficacy and tolerability of naratriptan tablets (2.5 mg, 1 mg, and 0.25 mg) 
      compared with placebo in the acute treatment of migraine were evaluated in a
      randomized, double-blind, four-period crossover study. Five hundred eighty-six
      assessable patients received naratriptan 2.5 mg, 595 received 1 mg, 591 received 
      0.25 mg, 602 received placebo. Headache relief (moderate or severe pain reduced
      to mild or none) 4 hours postdose was reported in 68% of patients after treatment
      with naratriptan 2.5 mg compared with 57% after 1 mg, 39% after 0.25 mg, and 33% 
      after placebo (p < 0.001 naratriptan 2.5 mg and 1 mg versus placebo and 1 mg and 
      2.5 mg versus 0.25 mg). Headache relief was maintained 8, 12, and 24 hours
      postdose with no use of rescue medication or a second dose of study medication by
      significantly (p < 0.001) greater percentages of patients after treatment with
      naratriptan 2.5 mg or 1 mg compared with naratriptan 0.25 mg or placebo.
      Naratriptan was also more effective than placebo in reducing clinical disability 
      and the incidences of nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia. The overall incidence
      of adverse events and the incidences of specific adverse events did not differ in
      the naratriptan groups compared with placebo. No clinically relevant changes in
      ECG, blood pressure, or laboratory findings were reported. These data demonstrate
      that naratriptan is effective and well tolerated for the acute treatment of
      migraine. The 2.5-mg dose was associated with superior efficacy, whereas its
      adverse event profile was similar to that of placebo.

      study.
PG  - 559-60
AB  - Transdermal clonidine has recently been reported to be efficacious in the
      prophylaxis of cluster headache. A 2-week course of transdermal clonidine (5 mg
      the first week, 7.5 mg the second week) preceded by a 5-day run-in period, was
      administered to 16 patients with episodic cluster headache in an active cluster
      period. In 5 patients, the painful attacks disappeared after the seventh day of
      treatment. For the group as a whole, no significant variations in headache
      frequency, pain intensity, or attack duration were observed between the run-in
      period and the first and second weeks of treatment (ANOVA). Further studies are
      necessary to clarify the effectiveness of transdermal clonidine in the
      prophylaxis of episodic cluster headache.

TI  - Sumatriptan nasal spray for the acute treatment of migraine. Results of two
      clinical studies.
PG  - 1225-30
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sumatriptan nasal spray may be particularly useful for patients whose
      nausea and vomiting preclude them from using oral migraine medication or for
      patients who prefer not to use an injectable migraine medication. The objective
      of this study was to evaluate in two clinical studies the efficacy and
      tolerability of the intranasal form of sumatriptan in the acute treatment of a
      single migraine attack. International Headache Society-diagnosed adult
      migraineurs in two randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter studies 
      (n = 409 and 436) used sumatriptan nasal spray 20 mg, 10 mg, or placebo (2:1:1)
      for the acute treatment of a single migraine attack at home. Predose and at
      predetermined postdose intervals, patients recorded headache severity (none,
      mild, moderate, severe); time to meaningful relief; clinical disability (none,
      mildly impaired, severely impaired, bed rest required); presence/absence of
      nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia; and the occurrence of adverse events. Two
      hours postdose in the two studies, moderate or severe baseline pain was reduced
      to mild or none in 62 to 63% of patients treated with sumatriptan 20 mg, 43 to
      54% of patients treated with sumatriptan 10 mg, and 29 to 35% of placebo-treated 
      patients (p < 0.05 20 mg versus placebo for both studies and 10 mg versus placebo
      for study 1). Onset of relief relative to placebo began as early as 15 minutes
      postdose (sumatriptan 20 mg, study 2). Clinical disability at 2 hours postdose
      was reported as mildly impaired or normal in 72 to 74% of patients treated with
      sumatriptan 20 mg, 56 to 68% of patients treated with sumatriptan 10 mg, and 47
      to 58% of placebo-treated patients (p < 0.05 20 mg versus placebo for both
      studies). Similar efficacy rates were observed for nausea, photophobia, and
      phonophobia. The most common adverse event in the active treatment groups was
      disturbance of taste (bad, bitter, or unpleasant taste). Aside from this event,
      the pattern and incidence of adverse events did not differ among treatment
      groups. From these results we determined that sumatriptan nasal spray is a
      rapidly effective, well-tolerated migraine treatment. The 20-mg dose was
      effective in treating the entire migraine symptom complex, and the 10-mg dose was
      less consistently effective.

TI  - Clinical efficacy and tolerability of 2.5 mg zolmitriptan for the acute treatment
      of migraine. The 042 Clinical Trial Study Group.
PG  - 1219-25
AB  - Previous studies demonstrated that zolmitriptan at doses of 1 to 25 mg was highly
      effective in treating acute migraine attacks. The 2.5-mg dose had a favorable
      therapeutic effect with high efficacy and good tolerability. The objective of
      this study was to further evaluate the efficacy of a single 2.5-mg dose of
      zolmitriptan (Zomig, formerly known as 311C90) for acute treatment of a single
      moderate or severe migraine attack. The study was a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled clinical trial. Female and male patients, 12 to 65 years old, 
      with migraine (with or without aura) for > or = 1 year, one to six migraines per 
      month, and age at onset < 50 years were included; 327 patients were screened and 
      randomized to receive either zolmitriptan (n = 219) or placebo (n = 108).
      Patients treated a single moderate or severe migraine headache with 2.5 mg
      zolmitriptan or placebo and recorded clinical efficacy and adverse events on a
      diary form. Headache response at 2 hours was 62% for zolmitriptan compared with
      36% for placebo (p < 0.001); at 4 hours, headache response was 70% with
      zolmitriptan and 37% with placebo (p < 0.001). Headache recurrence in patients
      treated with 2.5 mg zolmitriptan was 22% (versus placebo 30%). The headache
      response at 4 hours, pain-free rate, and response rate of nonheadache symptoms
      favored zolmitriptan over placebo. No serious adverse events were associated with
      zolmitriptan treatment. A 2.5-mg dose of zolmitriptan is clinically effective and
      well tolerated for the acute treatment of migraine.

TI  - Optimizing the dose of zolmitriptan (Zomig, 311C90) for the acute treatment of
      migraine. A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose range-finding
      study. The 017 Clinical Trial Study Group.
PG  - 1210-8
AB  - This study investigated the efficacy of zolmitriptan (Zomig, formerly 311C90) in 
      acute migraine therapy. Patients with a history of migraine were randomized in a 
      double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled, dose range-finding study of oral
      zolmitriptan 1, 2.5, 5, or 10 mg versus placebo for the treatment of a severe or 
      moderate migraine headache. Patients with persistent or recurrent headache 4 to
      24 hours after the initial dose, who did not take escape medication, were
      eligible to receive a second blinded dose of either zolmitriptan or placebo. Of
      1,144 patients treated, 999 evaluable patients completed the study. The headache 
      response rates with zolmitriptan doses > or = 2.5 mg were 44 to 51% at 1 hour, 65
      to 67% at 2 hours, and 75 to 78% at 4 hours (all significantly superior to
      placebo). Also, zolmitriptan effectively relieved migraine-associated symptoms
      such as nausea, photophobia and phonophobia, and reduced activity impairment.
      Rates of headache recurrence, headache persistence, and use of escape medication 
      were lower with zolmitriptan doses > or = 2.5 mg than with placebo. In patients
      with persistent or recurrent headache, a second zolmitriptan dose effectively
      treated both headache and nonheadache symptoms. Zolmitriptan was well tolerated, 
      with a lower incidence of adverse events being reported with doses < or = 2.5 mg 
      than with those > or = 5 mg. Zolmitriptan is a well tolerated and effective acute
      migraine therapy providing rapid relief of migraine headache within 1 hour. A
      clear dose-response relationship between efficacy and tolerability suggests that 
      2.5 mg is the optimal initial dose for the acute treatment of a migraine attack.

AB  - Zolmitriptan (Zomig, formerly 311C90) is a novel, oral antimigraine drug that is 
      consistently effective and well tolerated in the acute treatment of migraine
      headache and its associated symptoms. The purpose of this article is to review
      data available from pharmacological and clinical trials with zolmitriptan and to 
      summarize the clinically relevant features that distinguish this agent. We will
      review the attributes desirable in a migraine drug and use this as a template for
      assessing zolmitriptan. Zolmitriptan provides a new oral treatment option for
      physicians which should help improve patient outcomes.

      peripherally acting 5HT1B/1D agonist. International clinical experience based on 
      > 3000 subjects treated with zolmitriptan.
PG  - 41-52
AB  - Zolmitriptan (Zomig, formerly 311C90) at doses of 0.5-50 mg was administered to
      316 unique volunteers in clinical pharmacology studies and 2,750 unique patients 
      in eight clinical studies of acute migraine treatment. Overall, subjects received
      almost 50,000 doses; 97% of exposures were at doses > or = 2.5 mg. In the
      clinical pharmacology studies, the overall incidence of subject exposures
      experiencing at least one adverse event was 52% with zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (28%
      with placebo). In placebo-controlled studies, the overall incidence of patients
      with at least one adverse event was dose-dependent for zolmitriptan over the 1-15
      mg dose range, e.g. 42% and 46% with 1 and 2.5 mg, respectively and 58% with 5 mg
      (29% with placebo). Only four serious adverse events attributable to zolmitriptan
      were reported. In a long-term study, during which 2,058 outpatients treated a
      total of 31,579 migraine attacks with either one or two zolmitriptan 5 mg doses
      over a period of up to 1 year, the number of attacks associated with at least one
      adverse event was similar after one (26%) and two (24%) doses. The majority (59%)
      of the adverse events reported in this study (59%) occurred within 2 h of dosing,
      were predominantly mild (59%) or moderate (35%) in intensity, of < or = 4 h
      duration (58%), required no further action (94%). In placebo-controlled studies, 
      the percentage of patients who reported severe adverse events was similar with
      zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (4%) and placebo (5%). The most frequently reported adverse
      events with zolmitriptan in the placebo-controlled clinical studies were
      asthenia, heaviness (other than chest or neck), dry mouth, nausea, dizziness,
      somnolence, paresthesia and warm sensations. The type and severity of the adverse
      events was not influenced by gender (although the frequency of reported adverse
      events was higher in females, as was the case in the placebo group), age,
      presence of aura prior to the attack, association of migraine with menstruation, 
      concurrent medication, or by the addition of a second zolmitriptan dose.
      Zolmitriptan showed a similar tolerability profile in the long-term study, in
      which a low withdrawal rate due to adverse events of 8% was observed.
      Zolmitriptan was not associated with an increased frequency of central nervous
      system-related adverse events in a comparative study of sumatriptan, despite
      pre-clinical and neurophysiological evidence of a dual peripheral and central
      action of zolmitriptan. Moreover, zolmitriptan doses of 5-20 mg produced no
      statistically significant effects on objective assessments of psychometric
      function. Zolmitriptan had no clinically significant effects on blood pressure
      (even in patients with controlled mild to moderate hypertension or impaired renal
      function), ECGs (e.g. there was no evidence of ischemic events) or clinical
      chemistry, hematological or urinalysis measurements. In summary, zolmitriptan is 
      well tolerated, particularly at the recommended dose of 2.5 mg. Zolmitriptan has 
      a well-defined dose-response with 2.5 mg proving highly effective and optimizing 
      the benefit/risk ratio of treatment. Thus, zolmitriptan is well suited as an
      acute oral treatment for migraine in the outpatient setting.

      agonist: an overview of efficacy.
PG  - 28-40
AB  - The efficacy of zolmitriptan (Zomig, 311C90), a 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT)1B/1D
      receptor agonist, in the acute oral treatment of migraine was evaluated in an
      extensive clinical trial program. Four randomized, placebo-controlled studies
      (total 2480 patients) were performed; data from two of these trials established
      that a 2.5 mg dose was on the shoulder of the dose-response curve (2-h headache
      response rate 64%), showing similar efficacy to the 5 mg dose (67%). In this
      program, the efficacy of zolmitriptan was not influenced by the pretreatment
      headache duration; the presence of aura preceding the headache, migraine
      associated with menses or migraine upon awakening; or by concomitant use of oral 
      contraceptives or antidepressants. In addition, zolmitriptan 5 mg proved
      consistently effective in the treatment of multiple migraine attacks for up to 1 
      year. Zolmitriptan reduced the incidence of nausea, photophobia and phonophobia, 
      reduced impairment of normal activity and demonstrated positive effects on
      patients' quality of life. Thus, zolmitriptan is a highly effective acute oral
      antimigraine therapy, with 2.5 mg providing the optimal balance between efficacy 
      and tolerability.

TI  - Pre-clinical pharmacology of zolmitriptan (Zomig; formerly 311C90), a centrally
      and peripherally acting 5HT1B/1D agonist for migraine.
PG  - 4-14
AB  - Zolmitriptan (Zomig; formerly 311C90) is a novel 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT)1B/1D
      receptor agonist with proven efficacy in the acute treatment of migraine with or 
      without preceding aura. The drug differs from presently available members of this
      drug class in that it combines 5HT1B/1D receptor partial agonist activity with
      robust oral pharmacokinetics and an ability to inhibit trigeminovascular
      activation centrally as well as peripherally in preclinical studies. Consistent
      with its selectivity for 5HT1B/1D receptors, zolmitriptan produces constriction
      of various isolated blood vessels, most notably cranial arteries. In
      anaesthetized animals, these vascular effects manifest as a selective
      constriction of cranial arterio-venous anastomoses resulting in a redistribution 
      of carotid arterial blood flow. This effect is produced without significant
      effects on heart rate, blood pressure or blood flow to the brain, heart or lungs.
      Zolmitriptan also inhibits trigeminal-evoked increases in cerebral blood flow in 
      anaesthetized cats and blocks trigeminal-evoked plasma protein extravasation in
      the dura of guinea-pigs. These actions are consistent with a pre-junctional
      inhibition of neuropeptide release from perivascular afferents of the trigeminal 
      nerve, as confirmed by independent studies showing that zolmitriptan blocks
      elevations of calcitonin-gene-related peptide in jugular venous blood during
      electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion. In all of these effects,
      zolmitriptan is three to four times more potent than sumatriptan, but produces
      the same maximum response. Zolmitriptan crosses the intact blood-brain barrier to
      inhibit trigeminovascular activation in the brainstem. This was shown initially
      by the ability of the drug to block a brainstem reflex provoking vasoactive
      intestinal peptide release from the VIIth cranial (facial) nerve during
      trigeminal stimulation. Subsequent ex vivo autoradiography confirmed that
      intravenously injected [3H]zolmitriptan labels a discrete population of cells in 
      the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) and nucleus tractus solitarius. Direct
      evidence for a central neuromodulatory effect of zolmitriptan was provided by
      electrophysiological experiments which clearly demonstrated that the drug
      inhibits the excitability of cells in the TNC after systemic administration. This
      novel pre-clinical profile not only distinguishes zolmitriptan from sumatriptan, 
      but raises intriguing questions about the clinical relevance of a dual action.
      Studies to date show that zolmitriptan indeed modulates cranial sensory
      processing in humans, yet central side-effects are no different from sumatriptan.
      This property may account for the remarkable consistency in clinical efficacy
      observed in clinical trials.

TI  - Characteristics and determinants of sumatriptan-associated chest pain.
PG  - 1387-92
AB  - BACKGROUND: Serious cardiac adverse reactions, including myocardial infarction,
      have been attributed to the antimigraine drug sumatriptan succinate. Chest pain
      is considered to be a relatively common adverse reaction to sumatriptan. DESIGN: 
      Postmarketing study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was a part of a national
      cohort study on adverse reactions to sumatriptan, which was performed with the
      assistance of drug-dispensing general practitioners in the Netherlands. After
      data were collected on observed adverse reactions, the patients received a second
      questionnaire, with specific questions regarding the adverse event, and questions
      regarding medical history, other health complaints, and smoking habits.
      Furthermore, they had a physical examination and a blood cholesterol measurement.
      RESULTS: A total of 137 patients with chest pain associated with intake of
      sumatriptan were identified and compared with 229 consumers of sumatriptan
      without this adverse reaction. After multivariate analysis, young age,
      hypertension, general complaints of abdominal pain, and a family history of
      myocardial infarction were associated with an increased risk of chest pain
      attributed to sumatriptan. Hypertension in particular was a risk factor for
      sumatriptan-induced chest pain in men (relative risk, 8.0; 95% confidence
      interval, 1.8-40) compared with hypertension as a risk factor in women (relative 
      risk, 1.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.9-3.1). CONCLUSIONS: Young age,
      hypertension, general complaints of abdominal pain, and a family history of
      myocardial infarction are associated with an increased risk of chest pain
      attributed to sumatriptan. Sex is an effective modifier of risk factors of
      sumatriptan-induced chest pain. In particular, hypertension is a strong risk
      factor in men.

TI  - Double-blind placebo-controlled trial of lithium in episodic cluster headache.
PG  - 673-5
AB  - Lithium is widely used in the prophylaxis of episodic cluster headache without
      formal evidence of efficacy. Placebo-controlled clinical trials are not easy in
      conditions characterized by frequent severe pain. In this study, it was assumed
      that lithium would work quickly if at all, and placebo response would be zero.
      Strict diagnostic criteria excluded uncertain or atypical cases. Patients were
      male in so-far untreated episodes expected to last for at least 3 weeks more. In 
      a double-blind, placebo-controlled comparison of matched parallel groups,
      treatment was either slow-release lithium carbonate, 800 mg/day, or placebo.
      After 7 days, compliance was estimated by tablet count, blood was taken for
      lithium assay, efficacy was assessed (attacks stopped or substantially improved) 
      and adverse reactions were recorded. The study was stopped after planned
      sequential analysis of the 27th patient (13 on lithium, 14 on placebo). Estimated
      compliance was usually but not always good. Plasma lithium levels were mostly in 
      the range 0.5-0.6 mmol/l on lithium, zero on placebo. Cessation of attacks within
      1 week occurred in two patients in each group, substantial improvement in 6/14
      (43%) on placebo, 8/13 (62%; NS) on lithium. Only minor adverse events were
      reported. Lithium treatment was therefore associated with a useful subjective
      improvement rate but the assumptions made at outset had proved wrong. The trial
      was stopped because superiority over placebo could not be demonstrated. There
      were lessons for future trials.

TI  - Double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding study of rizatriptan (MK-462) in
      the acute treatment of migraine.
PG  - 647-51
AB  - Rizatriptan (MK-462) is a potent 5HTID receptor agonist. This multicenter,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, outpatient study investigated the clinical
      efficacy, safety, and tolerability of rizatriptan (2.5, 5, and 10 mg) as a
      function of dose for acute migraine. Patients with moderate or severe migraine (n
      = 417) were treated with placebo (n = 67), rizatriptan 2.5 mg (n = 75), 5 mg (n =
      130), or rizatriptan 10 mg (n = 145). Headache severity, functional disability,
      and migraine symptoms were measured immediately before dosing (0) and at 0.5, 1, 
      1.5, 2, 3, and 4 h post-dose. Patients were permitted to take a second dose of
      test drug at 2 h if their headache pain was moderate or severe (i.e., placebo
      initially-->rizatriptan 10 mg as optional second dose; rizatriptan 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 
      or 10 mg initially-->placebo as optional second dose). An upward dose-response
      relationship was observed among placebo, rizatriptan 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg in
      the primary efficacy measure of proportion of patients reporting pain relief,
      i.e., a change in headache severity to "no pain or mild pain" at 2 h post-dose.
      The relationship was evident even at the first recorded timepoint, 30 min, and
      was statistically significant at 1.5 h and beyond. At the primary timepoint of 2 
      h after the initial dose, the proportion of patients reporting pain relief was
      47.6% for rizatriptan 10 mg; 45.4% for rizatriptan 5 mg; 21.3% for rizatriptan
      2.5 mg; and 17.9% for placebo. Seventy percent of patients on rizatriptan 10 mg
      reported pain relief at 4 h. Patients who took rizatriptan 5 mg and 10 mg were
      significantly less functionally disabled than those who took placebo at 1.5 and 2
      h post-dose. Rizatriptan 10 mg was consistently more effective than 5 mg,
      although the differences were not statistically significant. The most frequent
      clinical adverse events were dizziness, somnolence, and asthenia/fatigue. No
      patients were discontinued for any adverse experiences and there were no serious 
      adverse experiences.

TI  - Peripheral vascular effects and pharmacokinetics of the antimigraine compound,
      zolmitriptan, in combination with oral ergotamine in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 639-46
AB  - Members of the new class of antimigraine compounds, 5HT1B/1D agonists, as well as
      ergotamine, may cause vasoconstriction through stimulation of 5HT receptors on
      peripheral vessels. The cardiovascular effects of 20 mg oral zolmitriptan (Zomig,
      formerly 311C90), 2 mg oral ergotamine and the combination were assessed in a
      randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study in 12 healthy
      subjects. Pharmacodynamic measures included oscillometric blood pressure,
      systolic blood pressure at the toe and arm using a strain gauge technique, stroke
      volume and cardiac output using bioimpedance cardiography, high-resolution
      ultrasound to measure brachial arterial diameter and a novel Doppler method to
      measure blood flow velocity. Both drugs produced small degrees of peripheral
      vasoconstriction, including increases in diastolic blood pressure and blood flow 
      velocity and decreases in arterial diameter and toe-arm systolic pressure
      gradient. These effects were generally additive with the combination but of no
      clinical importance. There were no significant changes in cardiac output, stroke 
      volume heart rate or ECG. Zolmitriptan, at eight times the likely therapeutic
      dose, was generally well tolerated both alone and in combination with ergotamine.
      Ergotamine had no clinically important effects on zolmitriptan pharmacokinetics.

PG  - 258-63
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess serotonergic function in patients with
      major depression or mania using sumatriptan, a novel 5-HT1D receptor agonist, as 
      a pharmacological probe in a neuroendocrine challenge paradigm. We studied 18
      drug free patients (10 with acute unipolar major depression and 8 with acute
      mania) who met DSM-IV criteria, and healthy controls. Subjects presented for
      testing after an overnight fast. After obtaining a blood sample for baseline
      growth hormone (GH) levels, sumatriptan (6 mg) was given subcutaneously, and
      further blood samples were collected at half hour intervals for 2 hours. The
      results showed that GH responses to sumatriptan were blunted in depressed
      patients but not in manics, compared to healthy controls. There were no
      differences in basal GH levels between the 3 groups. The results of this study
      provide further support for the role of serotonergic system in pathophysiology of
      major depression, but not in mania.

TI  - The thigh may not be suitable as an injection site for patients self-injecting
      sumatriptan.
PG  - 559-61
AB  - The objective of our study was to evaluate the differences between injection
      sites in the midthigh and the upper lateral quadrant of the gluteal area
      regarding the effect, depth of subcutaneous tissue, side effects, and patient
      preference in patients with cluster headache who self-inject 6 mg (0.5 ml) of
      sumatriptan. Our open, prospective clinical study was performed at the outpatient
      department of a Swedish university clinic. There were 19 male and one female
      subjects, 34 to 68 years old, suffering from cluster headache. We measured the
      subcutaneous tissue depth by ultrasound. Subjects performed four self-injections 
      of sumatriptan, two in the thigh and two in the gluteal area. We evaluated the
      subcutaneous tissue depth from the skin surface to the muscle fascia, the effect 
      on headache, side effects, and patient preference regarding the injection site.
      Subcutaneous tissue depth laterally in the thigh was 2 to 12 mm (median, 4 mm)
      and in the gluteal area was 34 to 68 mm (median, 45 mm). The needle of the
      self-injector protrudes 5 to 6 mm. Forty thigh and 39 gluteal injections were
      recorded. The effect on headache was equal. Following injection in thigh the
      patients experienced more bleeding (p < 0.001, chi 2); local pain (p < 0.05, chi 
      2); and a feeling of oppression in the head, neck, and chest area (p < 0.05, chi 
      2); compared with injections in the gluteal area. Fifteen patients preferred the 
      gluteal area as the injection site after the study, two patients had no
      preference, and three preferred the thigh. When using the self-injector in the
      lateral aspect of the thigh, intramuscular injection is liable to occur
      frequently in male patients. This may explain the differences in local and
      general side effects observed in this study. The upper lateral quadrant of the
      gluteal area is a more suitable injection site for male, and some female,
      patients when using the sumatriptan self-injector.

TI  - Oral and subcutaneous sumatriptan in the acute treatment of migraine: an open
      randomized cross-over study.
PG  - 591-5
AB  - In an open, randomized cross-over study in 124 patients, we compared the
      efficacy, safety and patient preference of oral and subcutaneous sumatriptan in
      the acute treatment of migraine. Patients were treated for 3 attacks or 3 months 
      and then crossed over. Primary clinical efficacy was defined as a reduction in
      headache severity on a four-point self-rating scale from severe (3) or moderate
      (2) to mild (1) or none (0), or mild (1) to none (0). Efficacy was evaluated 2 h 
      after the administration of subcutaneous and 4 h after the administration of oral
      sumatriptan. Subcutaneous sumatriptan was significantly more effective than oral 
      sumatriptan in relieving headache (over all three attacks 78% vs 61%
      improvement), improving clinical disability (55% vs 41% improvement) and
      relieving nausea (69% vs 53%), vomiting (72% vs 32%) and phono- or photophobia
      (67% vs 49%). Median time to recurrence was shorter after subcutaneous (12.5 h)
      than after oral sumatriptan (18 h); the number of patients experiencing a
      recurrence was similar. Patients reported more adverse events after subcutaneous 
      sumatriptan (1.32 per attack) than after the oral form (0.85 per attack), but all
      adverse events were mild to moderate in intensity and of short duration. Patient 
      opinion was more often positive after subcutaneous sumatriptan. These results may
      be useful in counselling patients to choose between the available marketed
      formulations of sumatriptan.

TI  - Responsiveness of non-IHS migraine and tension-type headache to sumatriptan.
PG  - 588-90
AB  - In a long-term efficacy and safety study, 424 patients were treated with
      sumatriptan (6 mg sc) for 1,904 migraine attacks. The patients were diagnosed
      with migraine based on IHS criteria but individual migraine attacks treated in
      the study were physician diagnosed; not necessarily required to meet IHS
      criteria. A re-analysis of the treatment response to open label sumatriptan (6 mg
      sc) indicated that 43 patients had treated at least one migraine that fulfilled
      IHS criteria for tension-type headache. Analysis of this population revealed they
      treated 232 headaches. Of these headaches, 114 were classified per IHS criteria
      as migraine; 76 as tension-type; and 42 as non-IHS migraine (not classifiable as 
      IHS migraine or IHS tension-type headache). Of the 114 migraines, a positive
      response to sumatriptan occurred in 109 (96%) cases; of the 76 tension-types, 73 
      responded to sumatriptan (97%); of the 42 non-IHS migraine, 40 (95%) responded to
      sumatriptan. An equivalent response to sumatriptan among three diagnostic groups 
      of headache supports the concept of a common biologic mechanism involving 5HT1
      receptors that spans a range of clinical presentations.

TI  - Sumatriptan in the acute treatment of migraine without aura: efficacy of 50-mg
      dose.
PG  - 421-3
AB  - We conducted an open study on the efficacy of 50 mg of sumatriptan as an acute
      treatment for migraine without aura. We recruited 200 consecutive patients, with 
      an established history of migraine without aura, presenting at a headache center.
      The patients were instructed to take half a 100-mg sumatriptan tablet for their
      next migraine attack, and to record details of their headache in a diary. The
      primary outcome of the study was headache relief from one migraine attack.
      Attacks were moderately intense (46%), moderate to severe (7%), or severe (47%). 
      Total or partial benefit at 2 hours from the 50-mg dose was reported by 140 of
      200 patients (70%). Thirty-six patients received no benefit from half a tablet,
      and 24 did not take sumatriptan, preferring their habitual medication. Side
      effects were few, mild, and short lasting. We conclude that the 50-mg oral dose
      is generally effective for migraine without aura attacks of both moderate and
      severe intensity and recommend this dose for all such patients. If, however,
      sumatriptan is ineffective at that dose it can be increased to a maximum of 100
      mg.

TI  - Serum beta-endorphin increase after intravenous histamine treatment of chronic
      daily headache.
PG  - 321-4
AB  - Histamine is able to induce spontaneous-like headache attacks in migraine and
      cluster headache subjects. Therefore, it has been considered as a possible agent 
      in the pathogenesis of headache. Histamine desensitization is used for the
      treatment of cluster and other chronic headaches like migrains with
      interparoxysmal headache. However, it is unknown whether desensitization plays a 
      role in headache improvement. Since a disfunction of the opioid system has been
      considered responsible for idiopathic headache and since low beta-endorphin
      levels have been demonstrated in some idiopathic headaches, particularly in
      migraine with interparoxysmal headache, we planned this study to verify if
      histamine therapy is able to modify serum beta-endorphin concentrations. For this
      purpose, we studied 24 healthy control subjects and 36 patients suffering from
      migraine with interparoxysmal headache refractory to conventional therapies.
      Patients showed baseline serum beta-endorphin levels significantly lower than
      healthy control subjects and treatment with histamine for 15 days increased their
      beta-endorphin concentrations. We believe that histamine treatment can activate
      the opioid endogenous system. However, the therapeutic effect of histamine
      remains to be verified by evaluating the correlation between beta-endorphin
      levels and headache improvement.

TI  - Intravenous chlorpromazine versus intramuscular sumatriptan for acute migraine.
PG  - 209-11
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish whether there is any difference in the efficacy of a
      chlorpromazine regimen and a sumatriptan regimen for the management of the pain
      of acute severe migraine. SETTING: Two urban teaching hospital emergency
      departments. METHODS: Prospective, randomised, unblinded, crossover trial. All
      patients received intravenous metoclopramide 10 mg and 1000 ml of normal saline
      over 1 h; 20 were then randomised to receive intramuscular sumatriptan 6 mg and
      23 to receive intravenous chlorpromazine, 12.5 mg increments to a maximum of 37.5
      mg. Response to treatment was measured using visual analogue pain scales.
      RESULTS: No difference in efficacy between the sumatriptan regimen and the
      chlorpromazine regimen was found. Adverse effects were mild and equally
      distributed between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: The chlorpromazine and sumatriptan
      regimens studied are both very effective for the relief of the headache of severe
      migraine.

TI  - Effects of sumatriptan on growth hormone releasing hormone-stimulated growth
      hormone secretion in acromegaly.
PG  - 264-8
AB  - Sumatriptan (SU), a specific 5-HT1D receptor agonist, was recently shown to be
      able to increase growth hormone (GH) levels in normals, but not in acromegalics, 
      while no effect was seen on prolactine (PRL). SU is also able to produce an
      increase in GH response to growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) in prepubertal
      children. In this study we investigated whether SU administration influences
      GHRH-induced GH secretion in 8 acromegalics, and 6 age-matched normal volunteers,
      as a control group. We evaluated the effects of SU (6 mg s.c.) or placebo (PL)
      administration on GHRH (1 microgram/kg bw i.v.)-induced GH and PRL secretion.
      After SU priming the GH response to GHRH did not changed in acromegalics, but
      significantly decreased in controls, in comparison with that observed after PL
      plus GHRH. In acromegalics, no difference in GH peak was seen after SU plus GHRH 
      and PL plus GHRH, nor was any difference seen in AUC between tests. In controls, 
      no difference was seen in GH peaks, while SU priming significantly (P < 0.03)
      decreased the AUC 90-120 min of GH after GHRH administration. In acromegalics, SU
      did not change the slight GHRH-induced increase in PRL levels. Our study
      documents that 5-HT1 D receptors do not interfere with GHRH-stimulated GH
      secretion in acromegalic subjects. In normals, SU is able to decrease GH response
      to GHRH, thus confirming that 5-HT1D receptors are able to modulate GH secretion 
      in normals.

TI  - Safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in healthy subjects
      following ascending single intranasal doses and multiple intranasal doses.
PG  - 541-50
AB  - The delivery of sumatriptan doses intranasally could add greater flexibility in
      the treatment of migraine than is possible with the currently available
      subcutaneous and oral sumatriptan preparations. Two independent double-blind,
      randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the
      safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of intranasally administered
      sumatriptan following ascending single doses (three different dose levels) and
      multiple doses. In the four-way, crossover, ascending-dose study, 20 healthy
      female subjects were randomized to receive on separate occasions single
      intranasal spray doses of 5, 10, or 20 mg sumatriptan (as the hemisulphate salt) 
      or placebo into one nostril. Adverse events were mild and consisted mainly of
      bitter taste at the back of the throat and events typical of sumatriptan
      administered by other routes (headache, lightheadedness and tingling). Area under
      the plasma sumatriptan concentration versus time curve (AUC infinity) and peak
      plasma concentration (Cmax) increased with the dose. Dose proportionality was
      demonstrated between 5 and 10 mg but not across the dose range 5-20 mg. Time to
      maximum plasma concentration (tmax) was variable due to multiple peaking. The
      elimination half-life (t1/2), approximately 2 h, was unaffected by the magnitude 
      of dose. In the two-period, multiple-dose, crossover study, 12 healthy adult male
      and female subjects were randomized to receive either sumatriptan hemisulphate 20
      mg or placebo, administered intranasally as a spray three times a day for 4 days.
      The two dosing periods were separated by 3 to 14 days. Multiple doses of
      sumatriptan were well tolerated, with no serious adverse events occurring or
      withdrawals due to adverse events. All patients reported a mild to moderate
      drug-related disturbance of taste. Nasal examinations remained normal, and
      olfactory function was unaffected. The AUC over the first 8 h following dosing
      (AUC8) and fraction of the dose excreted in the urine (fe; 6.2% vs 3.6%) were
      similar on Days 1 and 4. Day 4 values were significantly higher (p < or = 0.05)
      for Cmax (16.9 ng/ml vs 13.1 ng/ml), renal clearance (Clr; 19.0 l/h vs 14.2 l/h),
      and t1/2 (2.18 h vs 1.93 h), and shorter for tmax (0.88 h vs 1.75 h). Some
      accumulation (22%) occurred over the 4 days of dosing. Serum concentrations of
      the pharmacologically inactive indole acetic acid metabolite of sumatriptan were 
      fourfold to fivefold higher than corresponding sumatriptan concentrations.
      Overall, these studies show that the sumatriptan intranasal spray formulation is 
      well tolerated, allows rapid absorption of sumatriptan, and results in only a
      clinically insignificant degree of sumatriptan accumulation upon repeated dosing.

TI  - Safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan suppositories following
      single and multiple doses in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 532-40
AB  - A suppository formulation of the 5HT1 agonist sumatriptan could prove an
      important therapeutic option in migraine patients who dislike or poorly tolerate 
      injectable therapy and where oral tablet administration is unsuitable because of 
      severe migraine-related vomiting. Two independent double-blind, randomized
      clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan suppositories following ascending single doses
      (four different dose levels) and multiple doses. In the four-period, crossover,
      single-dose study, 24 healthy male subjects were randomized to receive a
      suppository containing 12.5, 25, 50, or 100 mg on separate occasions 3-14 days
      apart. The suppositories were generally well tolerated; transient asthenia,
      drowsiness, and headache were the most frequently reported adverse events, and
      these were not dose-related. Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of sumatriptan
      were proportional to dose from 25 to 100 mg; area under the plasma
      concentration-time curve (AUC infinity) values were proportional to dose except
      at the highest doses, when they were greater than those predicted from lower
      doses. For all doses, the tmax of sumatriptan occurred within 2.5 h, and the t1/2
      was approximately 2 h. In the two-period, placebo-controlled, crossover,
      repeat-dose study, 12 healthy adult male subjects were randomized to receive
      either a 50-mg sumatriptan suppository or placebo suppository, administered
      rectally twice a day, for 11 doses (5 1/2 days). Adverse events were no more
      frequent with sumatriptan than with placebo, and stool guaiac, rectal
      examinations, and physical examinations remained normal. No significant
      differences were noted between Day 1 and Day 6 values in the AUC, Cmax, time of
      peak serum concentration (tmax), elimination half-life (t 1/2), fraction of the
      dose excreted in the urine (fe), or renal clearance (Clr) of sumatriptan or its
      pharmacologically inactive indole acetic acid metabolite. Serum metabolite
      concentrations were two to three-fold higher than corresponding sumatriptan
      concentrations. No clinically significant accumulation of sumatriptan or its
      metabolite occurred. Overall, these studies show that sumatriptan administration 
      via a suppository formulation is well tolerated, allows rapid absorption of
      sumatriptan, results in sumatriptan Cmax values that are proportional to dose
      from 25 to 100 mg, and is not associated with accumulation of sumatriptan or its 
      metabolite.

AB  - Twenty-seven episodic female cluster headache patients were compared to 27
      age-matched female migraine patients with regard to occurrence of symptoms and
      diseases other than headache, and also with regard to tobacco consumption. Some
      symptoms and diseases were found to occur significantly or almost significantly
      more often in the cluster headache patients than in the migraine patients;
      Chronic fatigue (p < 0.01), vertigo (p < 0.05), arthralgia (p < 0.05), back pain 
      (p = 0.05), spontaneous ecchymoses (p = 0.05) and constipation and/or periodic
      diarrhea (p = 0.09). There were significantly fewer persons who had never smoked 
      in the cluster headache group than in the migraine group (p < 0.01). The extent
      of smoking was significantly greater in the cluster headache group than in the
      migraine group, both as to the number of cigarettes smoked per day (p < 0.001)
      and as to smoking years (p < 0.001).

TI  - The absolute bioavailability and metabolic disposition of the novel antimigraine 
      compound zolmitriptan (311C90).
PG  - 579-87
AB  - AIMS: Two open studies in healthy volunteers were conducted to determine the
      absolute bioavailability and metabolic disposition of zolmitriptan (311C90), a
      novel 5HT1D agonist for the acute treatment of migraine. METHODS: After an
      initial test i.v. infusion, bioavailability was assessed by comparison of AUC
      after an i.v. infusion (3.5 mg) and an oral tablet (10 mg), in six men and six
      women using a randomised, crossover design. Disposition was studied by
      administration of a 25 mg capsule, labelled with 100 microCi [14C]-zolmitriptan, 
      to five men and one woman on a single occasion. RESULTS: Zolmitriptan was well
      tolerated by both i.v. and oral routes. Adverse events were mostly mild,
      consistent with earlier studies and characteristic of this class of drug. Reports
      were similar in nature and number after both oral and i.v. dosing. Mean +/- s.d. 
      oral bioavailability was 0.49 +/- 0.24 (0.38 +/- 0.16 in men and 0.60 +/- 0.28 in
      women). After oral dosing, Cmax and AUC values in women were approximately double
      those in men. Relative to zolmitriptan concentrations, metabolite concentrations 
      were higher after oral dosing than after i.v., and higher in men compared with
      women. Half-life was significantly longer after oral dosing (mean 22%, 95% CI
      6-35%). Mean +/- s.d. values for CL, V2 and t1/2,z after i.v. dosing (all
      subjects) were 8.7 +/- 1.7 ml min-1 kg-1, 122 +/- 321 and 2.30 +/- 0.59 h
      respectively. Following administration of 25 mg [14C]-zolmitriptan, 91.5% of the 
      dose was recovered in 7 days, 64.4 +/- 6.5% in urine and 27.1 +/- 6.0% in faeces.
      Less than 10% was recovered unchanged in urine, with 31.1 +/- 6.4% recovered as
      the inactive indole acetic acid metabolite. Most of the faecal material was
      unchanged zolmitriptan, representing unabsorbed drug. Plasma concentrations of
      [14C] were slightly higher than those of the summed concentrations of known
      analytes zolmitriptan, the active N-desmethyl metabolite (183C91), the inactive
      N-oxide (1652W92) and indole acetic acid (2161W92) metabolites, which accounted
      for 86% of total plasma radioactivity. No other significant metabolites were
      detected in plasma. Some minor additional metabolites were detected in urine,
      none of which contributed more than 5% of the dose. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest
      that zolmitriptan undergoes first-pass metabolism and this is more extensive in
      men than in women. Zolmitriptan has suitable bioavailability for an acute oral
      migraine treatment and there are no significant unidentified metabolites in man.

PG  - 384-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
      (SSRIs) in the management of chronic pain. METHODS: Randomized, controlled trials
      of SSRIs in the management of chronic pain were identified by searching MEDLINE
      from 1966 to 1997 and by contacting the manufacturers of SSRIs available in the
      United States. MAIN RESULTS: Nineteen studies were identified, including 10 on
      the treatment of headache, 3 on diabetic neuropathy, 3 on fibromyalgia, and 3 on 
      mixed-chronic pain. SSRIs were consistently helpful for mixed-chronic pain.
      Results were conflicting for migraine headache, tension headache, diabetic
      neuropathy, and fibromyalgia. CONCLUSIONS: SSRIs appear to be beneficial for
      mixed-chronic pain. It is unclear, from the available evidence, whether SSRIs are
      beneficial for migraine headaches, tension headaches, diabetic neuropathy, or
      fibromyalgia. For those patients it may be reasonable to reserve SSRIs for those 
      who fall to respond to other medications or who are intolerant of their side
      effects.

TI  - A study of the effects of sumatriptan on myocardial perfusion in healthy female
      migraineurs using 13NH3 positron emission tomography.
PG  - 1542-50
AB  - Sumatriptan, a 5-HT1D receptor agonist, is believed to alleviate migraine attacks
      by extracerebral vasoconstriction. Chest pain associated with myocardial ischemia
      may occur after sumatriptan administration. We investigated the effect of a
      single 6-mg subcutaneous dose of sumatriptan on myocardial perfusion (MP) as
      measured by 13NH3 positron emission tomography (PET) in a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial at the Clinical PET Centre,
      Guy's and St. Thomas' Hospitals, London. Nineteen volunteer female migraineurs,
      age range 33 to 62 years, at low risk for ischemic heart disease were included.
      All bad undergone previous treatment with oral or intravenous sumatriptan.
      Patients were recruited by advertisement and referral from local neurology
      specialists. Each volunteer underwent two scanning sessions. On each occasion, a 
      baseline dynamic 13NH3 PET scan was acquired followed by a 13NH3 PET scan 10
      minutes after subcutaneous injection of placebo or 6 mg of sumatriptan. Regional 
      MP was measured in five myocardial regions using the Patlak system of image
      analysis. The mean % change from baseline (+/-SD) in global MP after placebo was 
      +9.5% +/- 18.0 and after sumatriptan was +6.6% +/- 18.8 (repeated measures ANOVA 
      for treatment effect p = 0.56). There were no significant differences in MP
      changes from baseline observed in any of the five myocardial regions (treatment p
      = 0.32 to 0.84). These data suggest that in healthy female migraineurs, a single 
      6-mg subcutaneous dose of sumatriptan does not cause a significant change in
      regional or global myocardial perfusion.

TI  - Hyperbaric oxygen in chronic cluster headaches: influence on serotonergic
      pathways.
PG  - 117-22
AB  - A controlled study was done with the aim of assessing the efficacy of hyperbaric 
      oxygen (HBO2) in cluster headache and of studying the possible influence of this 
      therapeutic approach on serotonergic pathways. Fourteen patients, aged between 26
      and 56 yr, suffering from the chronic form of cluster headache were treated with 
      HBO2 (n = 10) or environmental air (placebo) ( n = 4) during the 15 sessions of
      exposure (lasting 30 min each) in the hyperbaric chamber. The influence of this
      procedure on serotonergic pathways of pain was monitored by means of study of
      serotonin binding to mononuclear cells before and after the treatment for both
      subgroups. All of the treated 14 chronic cluster headache patients completed the 
      study. In the subgroup treated with the placebo, no particular modifications on
      the number of attacks and of analgesic consumption as well as no change in the
      specific binding curve of serotonin to mononuclear cells were observed, whereas
      in the subgroup treated with HBO2 the clinical effectiveness and the appearance
      of plateau in the binding curves indicated that the oxygen therapy could act
      through serotonergic pathways.

TI  - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-induced serotonin syndrome: review.
PG  - 208-21
AB  - The selective pharmacology of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
      results in a lower potential for pharmacodynamic drug interactions relative to
      other antidepressants such as the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and monoamine 
      oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). However, the SSRIs have been implicated in the
      development of the serotonin syndrome--a potentially life-threatening
      complication of treatment with psychotropic drugs. The syndrome is produced most 
      often by the concurrent use of two or more drugs that enhance central nervous
      system serotonin activity and often goes unrecognized because of the varied and
      nonspecific nature of its clinical features. The serotonin syndrome is
      characterized by alterations in cognition (disorientation, confusion), behavior
      (agitation, restlessness), autonomic nervous system function (fever, shivering,
      diaphoresis, diarrhea), and neuromuscular (ataxia, hyperreflexia, myoclonus)
      activity. The difference between this syndrome and the occurrence of adverse
      effects caused by serotonin reuptake inhibitors alone is the clustering of the
      signs and symptoms, their severity, and their duration. There are important
      pharmacokinetic interactions between SSRIs and other serotonergic drugs due
      principally to their effects on the cytochrome P450(CYP) isoenzymes, the
      potential for which varies widely amongst the SSRI group, which may increase the 
      likelihood of a pharmacodynamic interaction. The exceptionally long washout
      period required after fluoxetine discontinuation may cause additional problems
      and/or inconvenience. Patients with serotonin syndrome usually respond to
      discontinuation of drug therapy and supportive care alone, but they may also
      require treatment with antiserotonergic agent such as cyproheptadine,
      methysergide, and/or propranolol. To reduce the occurrence, morbidity, and
      mortality of the serotonin syndrome, it must be both prevented by prudent
      pharmacotherapy and given prompt recognition when it is present.

TI  - Inhibition of the blink reflex R2 component after supraorbital and index finger
      stimulations is reduced in cluster headache: an indication for both segmental and
      suprasegmental dysfunction?
PG  - 81-8
AB  - Peripheral as well as central mechanisms are thought to play a role in cluster
      headache pathogenesis. We have studied recovery curves of the R2 component of the
      blink reflex after conditioning by supraorbital or index finger stimuli in 10
      episodic cluster headache (CH) patients during a cluster period and in 10 healthy
      controls. There was no significant change of R2 threshold, latency or area in CH 
      patients. After paired supraorbital stimuli, R2 recovered more rapidly in
      patients on the symptomatic side. After index stimulations, R2 recovery was more 
      rapid on both symptomatic and non-symptomatic sides in patients compared to
      controls. Naloxone (0.4 mg) i.v. in two subjects partially reversed the R2
      suppression induced by index finger stimuli. The unilateral decrease of R2
      inhibition after a segmental supraorbital stimulus most likely reflects
      sensitisation in the spinal trigeminal nucleus. Whether the latter is due to
      irritation of the ophthalmic nerve within the cavernous sinus region, which is
      thought to be pivotal in CH pathogenesis, remains to be proven. In addition, we
      propose that the bilateral deficit of R2 inhibition after an extrasegmental
      exteroceptive stimulus might reflect hypoactivity of reticular nuclei, possibly
      because of reduced central opioid activity.

TI  - Atypical facial pain: a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover pilot study of 
      subcutaneous sumatriptan.
PG  - 83-8
AB  - A double-blind placebo-controlled crossover pilot study involving 19 patients was
      undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of subcutaneous sumatriptan, a selective
      5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-like receptor agonist, in the treatment of atypical
      facial pain (AFP). A reduction in total pain was found 120 min post injection in 
      the sumatriptan group. Most patients, however, described the medication as
      ineffective overall, despite significant pain score reduction. The temporary
      improvement of pain scores with the active drug was thought to be too small to be
      of any clinical benefit, but suggests that vascular or neurogenic mechanisms may 
      be involved in the aetiology of AFP. Sumatriptan is not an appropriate
      therapeutic option for patients with AFP, but could prove a valuable drug in
      experimental clinical pharmacology.

TI  - Sumatriptan. A pharmacoeconomic review of its use in migraine.
PG  - 473-90
AB  - Migraine is a common illness characterised by severe, often throbbing and/or
      unilateral headache, which may be accompanied by sensitivity to light or noise. A
      minority of migraine attacks are preceded by transient visual or sensory
      disturbances. Migraine is associated with reductions in health-related quality of
      life both during and between attacks. Despite methodological limitations in
      cost-of-illness studies, it is clear that the cost of migraine to society is
      substantial. Indirect costs (primarily workplace productivity losses) make up 75 
      to 90% of total costs. Direct costs, such as the cost of drug treatment,
      physician consultation, hospitalisation and emergency room treatment, make up
      most of the remainder. Sumatriptan is an effective and well tolerated agent in
      the treatment of migraine. Its main advantage over other agents used in the acute
      management of migraine appears to be its rapid onset of action. Sumatriptan
      reduces headache severity within 2 hours of oral administration in 50 to 67% of
      patients and within 1 hour of subcutaneous administration in 70 to 80% of
      patients. Headache recurs in approximately 40% of patients who initially respond 
      to oral or subcutaneous sumatriptan; however, a second dose of the drug is
      effective against the symptoms of recurrence in a majority of patients. Some
      patients experience relief of non-headache migraine symptoms, including nausea,
      vomiting, photophobia and phonophobia. Adverse events reported after sumatriptan 
      are generally mild and transient. Data from studies of patients who used their
      usual therapies and sumatriptan in nonblinded, sequential phases indicate that
      both workplace and nonworkplace productivity losses were reduced during
      sumatriptan therapy. A cost-benefit analysis applied to some of these workplace
      productivity data indicated that, including direct costs and productivity
      savings, sumatriptan was associated with a net reduction in total cost of
      migraine. In retrospective cost analyses, sumatriptan was associated with
      increased prescription costs: the effect of the drug on other direct treatment
      costs was less clear. A retrospective pharmacoeconomic model suggested that the
      cost-effectiveness of subcutaneous sumatriptan versus subcutaneous
      dihydroergotamine depended on which outcome measure was of greatest interest. For
      measures of rapid relief of migraine, sumatriptan was superior, but the cost of
      achieving rapid relief was substantial. Sumatriptan improved global
      quality-of-life scores compared with patients' usual therapy in a randomised
      crossover trial and appeared to do the same when the drugs were administered in
      nonblinded, sequential phases in trials which used general and migraine-specific 
      quality-of-life instruments. Thus, sumatriptan is associated with a fast onset of
      action and improvements in health-related quality of life in patients with
      migraine. However, the cost of achieving rapid relief of migraine symptoms may be
      substantial. Compared with patients' usual treatments, sumatriptan appeared to
      reduce workplace and non-workplace productivity losses. However, few economic
      data from well controlled prospective comparisons of sumatriptan with other
      available agents are available to quantify the effect of sumatriptan on the
      overall cost of migraine.

TI  - Use of sumatriptan in Denmark in 1994-5: an epidemiological analysis of
      nationwide prescription data.
PG  - 429-33
AB  - AIMS: We describe the use of medication with symptomatic relief of migraine as
      specific indication by analysing prescription data from the entire Danish
      population in 1994 and 1995. METHODS: The data for sumatriptan were analysed at
      the level of the individual user. We used aggregated data for ergotamine drugs.
      RESULTS: Sumatriptan constituted 46% of the total amount of defined daily doses
      (DDD) sold and 94% of the total pharmacy retail price expenses in the drug-group 
      studied. In total, 43389 users of sumatriptan were identified who presented
      340148 prescriptions, corresponding to 2.2 million DDD of sumatriptan. The
      quarterly consumption increased by 50% during the study period. Tablets accounted
      for 92% of consumption. The 1 year period prevalence of use of sumatriptan among 
      persons 16 years and older was 7.8 per 1000 in 1995 with a female to male
      prevalence ratio of 3.8:1. Use was most common in the age interval 35-54 years.
      Regional differences in use, which were not large, were positively correlated to 
      the degree of urbanization. The incidence of use of sumatriptan was estimated at 
      3.6 per 1000 person-years. The intensity of use of sumatriptan varied greatly
      with 1.1% of patients (n = 507) using 60 DDD or more within 30 days at some time 
      during the observation period. Long-term high use of tablets was common in this
      group. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that sumatriptan had a considerable impact on the
      treatment of migraine with prescription drugs in Denmark. The underlying reasons 
      for high use of the drug in a smaller fraction of the patients deserve further
      study.

TI  - Preventive treatment of migraine: an overview.
PG  - 67-72
AB  - The pharmacologic treatment of migraine may be acute (abortive, symptomatic) or
      preventive (prophylactic). Most migraine preventive medications were designed to 
      treat other disorders (e.g., propranolol for hypertension, valproate for
      epilepsy, etc.). Preventive medication is usually given daily for months or
      years; however, treatment can be episodic, subacute, or chronic. The medications 
      can be divided into two major categories: (i) Alternatives of high efficacy,
      which include beta-blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, and divalproex, and of
      lower efficacy, which include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, calcium
      channel antagonists, and non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and (ii)
      second-line choices of high efficacy, which include methysergide and monoamine
      oxidase inhibitors. The choice of preventive treatment depends on the individual 
      drug's efficacy and side effects, the patient's wants, needs, and response to
      prior treatment, and the presence of any comorbid or coexistent disease.

TI  - Sumatriptan for migraine attacks in children: a randomized placebo-controlled
      study. Do children with migraine respond to oral sumatriptan differently from
      adults?
PG  - 1100-3
AB  - Oral sumatriptan is an effective acute treatment for migraine in adults, but its 
      efficacy in children is still undetermined. Twenty-three children, aged 8.3 to
      16.4 years, took both sumatriptan and placebo in a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, crossover trial. The primary endpoint was a > or = 50%
      decrease in pain intensity on a 100-mm visual analogue scale at 2 hours. Other
      endpoints of efficacy were pain intensity difference (PID), showing pain relief
      at each time point; summed pain intensity differences (SPIDs), estimating overall
      pain relief; and preference. Two hours after sumatriptan, 7 of 23 reached the
      primary endpoint, and after placebo, 5 of 23 (difference 9%, 95% CI for
      difference, -21 to 38%; p = ns). Within 2 hours, the headache disappeared
      completely in 5 of 23 children after sumatriptan and in 2 of 23 children after
      placebo (p = ns). Median PIDs were slightly better for sumatriptan between 0.5
      and 4 hours (p = ns). Median SPIDs increased almost identically up to 2 hours.
      Thereafter, median SPIDs for placebo remained practically constant, whereas for
      sumatriptan, the improvement continued. At 4 hours, the median SPID for
      sumatriptan was 2.4 times as high as for placebo. However, the maximum
      differences between median SPIDs at 4 hours (38.5, 95% CI, -75.8 to 57.5;
      Wilcoxon signed rank test, p = 0.4) or at any other point were not statistically 
      significant. Of the 23 children, 13 preferred sumatriptan and 2 placebo (sign
      test, p = 0.004). The failure of this and previous controlled studies suggests
      that the response of children to sumatriptan may be different from adults.

TI  - The impact of drug therapy on quality of life in headache and migraine.
PG  - 334-42
AB  - Although headache is among the most common and costly disorders in primary care, 
      our understanding of its direct impact on the quality of life of affected
      individuals is incomplete. While studies evaluating the role of headache on
      health-related quality of life and healthcare economics are starting to appear in
      the medical literature, the effect of pharmacotherapy in improving quality of
      life is only beginning to be studied. At present, studies evaluating
      health-related quality of life in patients with migraine who are undergoing
      treatment are limited to 3 agents: sumatriptan, flurbiprofen and diclofenac.
      Several studies have consistently indicated that these drugs benefit patients by 
      improving key dimensions of health-related quality of life or patients' sense of 
      well-being to a significant extent. Given the magnitude of functional and
      emotional impairment associated with chronic headache disorders, assessing
      patients' perceptions of their quality of life makes a useful contribution to the
      evaluation of therapeutic interventions and should supplement traditional
      clinical endpoints in determining the effectiveness of new drugs.

      of zolmitriptan. METHODS: Twelve subjects participated in a randomized, balanced,
      crossover comparison. Plasma and urine concentrations of zolmitriptan and its
      metabolites, pulse rate and blood pressure were measured at intervals after drug.
      Ten volunteers completed the study. RESULTS: Zolmitriptan was well tolerated
      after single and multiple doses throughout the study. There was no evidence of
      significant changes in the pharmacokinetic parameters of zomitriptan or its
      metabolites after the last dose compared to the first, except for an expected
      rise in peak concentrations and a small, apparent increase in the amount of drug 
      excreted in urine and hence in CLR. After the last 10 mg dose, mean dosing
      interval zolmitriptan AUC was 80.3 ng ml-1 h compared with 86.5 ng ml-1 h after
      the single 10 mg dose (95% CI for ratio 0.76-1.13). There was no evidence of
      changes in the pharmacokinetic parameters of zolmitriptan and its metabolites
      after 10 mg compared with 5 mg, except a small increase in zolmitriptan CLR.
      There were no statistically significant increases in peak systolic or diastolic
      blood pressure after the last doses of zolmitriptan compared to placebo or in
      peak blood pressure after the last dose compared to the first. There were no
      significant differences between blood pressure immediately before the first and
      last doses of each multiple dose regimen. Peak erect systolic blood pressure
      after the last 10 mg dose (137 mmHg) was significantly lower than that after
      placebo (147 mmHg, 95% CI for difference -18, -2) and that after the last 5 mg
      dose (148 mmHg, 95% CI -19, -3). CONCLUSIONS: Repeated doses of 5 or 10 mg
      zolmitriptan are well tolerated despite higher plasma concentrations than
      expected from single doses.

TI  - Common noncompartmental pharmacokinetic variables: are they normally or
      log-normally distributed?
PG  - 171-8
AB  - We investigated the hypothesis that distributions of continuous pharmacokinetic
      variables are positively skewed in nature and that logarithmic transformation of 
      these variables restores normality. The distributions of common continuous
      noncompartmental pharmacokinetic variables were investigated for four different
      Glaxo Wellcome compounds, administered by three different routes of
      administration: ranitidine (po), sumatriptan (sc), ondansetron (iv), and bismuth,
      from ranitidine bismuth citrate (po). The distributions of all the investigated
      noncompartmental pharmacokinetic variables were adequately described by a
      log-normal distribution, whereas statistically significant departures from
      normality occurred in the majority of cases. Thus, unless there is strong and
      consistent evidence for a departure from log-normality, the parametric
      statistical analysis of common noncompartmental pharmacokinetic variables should 
      be carried out after a priori log transformation.

TI  - Responsiveness of the trigeminovascular system to nitroglycerine in cluster
      headache patients.
PG  - 283-8
AB  - Nitroglycerine is known to induce a headache attack in cluster headache patients,
      which is indistinguishable from a spontaneous attack. It has recently been
      suggested that a release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) from
      peripheral terminals of trigeminal nociceptive neurons, which supply cephalic
      blood vessels, underlies symptoms of cluster headache. The aim of this study was 
      to investigate whether the provocative action of nitroglycerine in cluster
      headache is due, at least in part, to activation of the trigeminovascular system.
      Nineteen subjects suffering from episodic cluster headache participated in the
      study. Eleven of them were in an active period, whilst the others were in
      remission at the time of the study. CGRP-like immunoreactivity (CGRP-LI) was
      measured in blood samples from the extracerebral circulation before and after the
      sublingual administration of nitroglycerine. Baseline CGRP-LI plasma levels were 
      higher (P < 0.05) in the patients who were in an active period. Only in these
      patients did nitroglycerine induce an attack, which was preceded by a latent
      period with a mean duration of 27 +/- 3 min. When compared with the baseline, a
      significant (P < 0.01) increase in plasma CGRP-LI was detected at the peak of the
      provoked attack; no such increase was detected during the latent period, or at
      the onset of the attack. The results of this study suggests that the provocative 
      action of nitroglycerine in cluster headache is due, at least in part, to
      activation of the trigeminovascular system. This mechanism seems to be slow and
      unrelated to the well-known rapidly occurring vasodilator effects of the drug.
      Finally, activation of the trigeminovascular system only occurs in those patients
      already in an active cluster headache period who also have high basal CGRP-LI
      plasma levels. This suggests that a hyperactivity of trigeminal nociceptive
      fibres could make the trigeminovascular system of these patients sensitive to the
      triggering action of nitroglycerine.

TI  - Deriving dichotomous outcome measures from continuous data in randomised
      controlled trials of analgesics: use of pain intensity and visual analogue
      scales.
PG  - 311-5
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine whether mean data from categorical pain
      intensity and visual analogue scales for both pain intensity and relief could be 
      used reliably to derive dichotomous outcome measures for meta-analysis.
      Individual patient data from randomised controlled trials of single-dose
      analgesics in acute postoperative pain were used. The methods used were as
      follows: data from 132 treatments with over 4700 patients were used to calculate 
      mean %maxSPID (categorical pain intensity), %maxVAS-SPID (visual analogue pain
      intensity) and %maxVAS-TOTPAR (visual analogue pain relief); these were used to
      derive relationships with the number of patients who achieved at least 50% pain
      relief (%maxTOTPAR). Good agreement was obtained between the actual number of
      patients with > 50%maxTOTPAR and the number calculated for all three measures.
      For SPID, verification included independent data sets. For calculations involving
      each measure, summing the positive and negative differences between actual and
      calculated numbers of patients with > 50%maxTOTPAR gave an average difference of 
      less than 0.25 patients per treatment arm. Reports of randomised trials of
      analgesics frequently describe results of studies in the form of mean derived
      indices, rather than using discontinuous events, such as number of proportion of 
      patients obtaining at least 50% pain relief. Because mean data inadequately
      describe information with a non-normal distribution, combining such mean data in 
      systematic reviews may compromise the results. Showing that dichotomous data can 
      reliably be derived from mean SPID, VAS-SPID and VAS-TOTPAR as well as TOTPAR
      data in previously published acute pain studies makes much more information
      accessible for meta-analysis.

AB  - This article discusses the use of serotonin1D agonists in the treatment of acute 
      migraine. Specifically, the author reviews the efficacy and safety of this class 
      of drugs with sumatriptan as the main focus. Agents under clinical trial are also
      discussed. Recurrence of migraine, long-term usage, and side effects of
      serotonin1D agonists are included in the review. The article also discusses
      alternative medications, such as intranasal lidocraine, intravenous
      chlorpromazine, and intravenous prochlorperazine, for acute treatment of
      migraine. The limited role of narcotics and sedatives is also mentioned.

TI  - A within-patient comparison of subcutaneous and oral sumatriptan in the acute
      treatment of migraine in general practice.
PG  - 31-6
AB  - This study compared, for the first time in the United Kingdom, the efficacy and
      safety of oral 100 mg and subcutaneous 6 mg sumatriptan within a patient for the 
      acute treatment of migraine. The patient's preference for the two formulations of
      sumatriptan were also recorded. The study was a multicentre, randomized, open,
      crossover design with an optional open parallel group extension. Individual
      attacks were treated with one formulation only. Over 70% of patients who treated 
      attack 1 in both treatment periods of the crossover phase reported headache
      relief with each formulation at 4 h. Only 3% of patients failed to respond to at 
      least one of the formulations at this time point. At the end of the crossover
      phase patient preference for the injection more than doubled from the
      pretreatment level in those patients who were previously naive to sumatriptan.
      During the optional phase of the study, 38% of patients chose to treat some
      attacks with oral and some with subcutaneous sumatriptan. The main reason for
      choosing injection was speed of relief, whilst convenience was the major reason
      for the use of the tablet.

TI  - Clinical study of epidural analgesia with clonidine and sumatriptan in
      posthysterectomy.
PG  - 172-6
AB  - A clinical study was conducted to compare the analgesic effect of clonidine with 
      those of sumatriptan and their mixture and their effects on hemodynamics. 40
      patients undergoing elective total hysterectomy were randomly divided into 4
      groups in terms of the epidurally administered drugs with 10 patients in each
      group (group C1: clonidine 150 micrograms, group C2: clonidine 75 micrograms,
      group S: sumatriptan 6 mg and group S + C: clonidine 75 micrograms + sumatriptan 
      3 mg). MAP, HR, SpO2, VT VAS, VRS and ePDT were measured in the initial 4 h. The 
      demographic data and the doses of intraoperative local anesthetics among the 4
      groups were not statistically different. It was found that no significant
      difference in the pre- and postadministration values of HR, SpO2 and VT. A
      obvious reduction of MAP appeared in the groups of C1 and C2, but in the other
      groups the hemodynamical parameters were stable. The groups of C1, C2 and S + C
      showed significant increase in VAS and VRS, along with increase of ePDT when
      compared with the pre-drug level. There was no obvious alteration in group S
      after the drug administration. It was concluded that (1) single use of
      sumatriptan is ineffective in the dose given in this study; (2) small dose (150
      micrograms and 75 micrograms) of clonidine has epidurally analgesic effects; (3) 
      combined use of sumatriptan and clonidine is an acceptable way in epidural
      analgesia, in terms of its analgesic effect and hemodynamic changes.

TI  - The novel anti-migraine compound zolmitriptan (Zomig 311C90) has no clinically
      significant interactions with paracetamol or metoclopramide.
PG  - 229-34
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study investigated potential pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic
      interactions between the novel anti-migraine compound zolmitriptan (Zomig,
      formerly 311C90) and paracetamol and/or metoclopramide. METHODS: In an
      open-label, randomised, crossover study, 15 healthy volunteers received single
      oral doses of 10 mg zolmitriptan alone, 1 g paracetamol alone, 10 mg zolmitriptan
      + 1 g paracetamol, 10 mg zolmitriptan + 10 mg metoclopramide or 10 mg
      zolmitriptan + 1 g paracetamol + 10 mg metoclopramide on five separate occasions.
      RESULTS: Metoclopramide had no significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of
      zolmitriptan or the active zolmitriptan metabolite 183C91, nor did it affect
      interactions between zolmitriptan and paracetamol. Paracetamol marginally
      increased the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) (11%) and the area under the
      curve (AUC) (11%) and reduced the renal clearance of zolmitriptan (9%); similar
      small effects were seen on 183C91. The AUC, Cmax and half-life of paracetamol
      were reduced by concomitant zolmitriptan (by 11%, 31% and 8%, respectively),
      whilst the mean residence time showed a small increase (+0.7 h). There was a
      trend towards a transient increase in blood pressure following all regimens
      containing zolmitriptan; this effect was small, was consistent between all
      zolmitriptan regimens as well as with previous studies, and was considered to be 
      clinically insignificant. Zolmitriptan was well tolerated after all treatment
      regimens. CONCLUSION: Concomitant administration of zolmitriptan and paracetamol 
      resulted in a slight increase in bioavailability of zolmitriptan and a reduced
      rate and extent of paracetamol absorption. These findings are considered to be of
      no clinical significance and there is no reason to avoid concomitant
      administration of paracetamol and/or metoclopramide with zolmitriptan.

PG  - 313-23
AB  - Cluster headache is characterized by regular periodicity, high frequency during a
      cluster period, relative brevity, and extreme intensity. Lancinations, as in
      trigeminal neuralgia, are rare. An important behavioral difference between
      migraine and cluster headache is that the patient is usually hyperactive during a
      cluster headache, whereas the migraineur retreats to a dark, quiet room. Cluster 
      headache is more common in middle-aged men; migraine is more common in young
      women. Intermediate or overlap syndromes occur. Many of the same prophylactic and
      abortive treatments are effective in both, although in cluster headache there is 
      a premium on rapid action.

TI  - The way to serotonergic use and abuse in migraine.
PG  - 79-84
AB  - 5-HT is currently indicated to play a role in migraine (M). Previously evidenced 
      5-HT supersensitivity which characterizes M is insufficient to compensate for a
      possible deficit in 5-HT bioavailability. Inducing a further up-regulation of
      5-HT receptor can yield improvement of M syndrome. Chronic treatments of
      methysergide and propranolol, drugs exerting antagonist action at 5-HT receptors,
      induced a significant amelioration in 256M sufferers. On the contrary, chronic
      treatments of ergotamine and sumatriptan, both provided with a 5-HT1 agonist
      activity, induced a worsening of M in 134 M sufferers. The M worsening was
      paralleled by an increase in consumption of analgesic drugs. Discussion concerns 
      the effects of the chronically given 5-HT agonists and antagonists as well as the
      possible receptor mechanism underlying "craving for serotonin" in severe M. The
      increase of 5-HT supersensitivity evidenced at the end of M attacks is also
      discussed and its role in determining the interruption of the attack is here
      suggested.

TI  - Drug-induced chest pain and myocardial infarction. Reports to a national centre
      and review of the literature.
PG  - 105-10
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To analyse reports of drug-induced myocardial infarction and chest
      pain sent to a national reporting centre. To review which drugs were suspected of
      exhibiting these adverse events and what mechanisms were involved. METHODS:
      During the 20-year period 1975 through 1994, a total of 19,141 reports on adverse
      reactions to drugs were received by the Netherlands Centre for Monitoring of
      Adverse Reactions to Drugs. Of these 19,141 reports, 220 (1.1%) were concerned
      with drug-induced chest pain or myocardial infarction. After excluding reports in
      which the causal relationship was unlikely, poorly documented reports and reports
      on cases of overdosage, 183 reports (84%) were analysed. RESULTS: There were 130 
      reports (71%) of drug-induced chest pain and 53 reports (29%) of drug-induced
      myocardial infarction. A total of 104 reports concerned females (57%). The most
      frequently reported suspected drugs were the antimigraine drug sumatriptan (33
      reports, 4 concerning myocardial infarction), the calcium antagonist nifedipin (9
      reports, 2 of myocardial infarction) and nicotine [9 reports (8 patches, 1
      chewing gum), 5 concerning myocardial infarction]. There were 18 reports of a
      fatal outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Several drugs can produce chest pain or myocardial
      ischaemia. It is important to recognise drugs as a potential cause, especially in
      patients with normal coronary arteries.

TI  - Studies to assess if pizotifen prophylaxis improves migraine beyond the benefit
      offered by acute sumatriptan therapy alone.
PG  - 31-8
AB  - Two multi-centre studies-one double-blind, placebo-controlled (study 1) and one
      open (study 2)-were set up to assess if pizotifen prophylaxis improved migraine
      beyond the benefit offered by acute sumatriptan therapy alone. Eighty-eight
      patients completed the blinded study and 63 patients completed the open study.
      Both studies were of crossover design with patients undertaking a 4 week run-in
      period prior to a 12-week treatment period. Following a 4-week washout period
      patients commenced a second 12-week treatment period on the alternative treatment
      regimen. All breakthrough attacks were treated with 100 mg oral sumatriptan with 
      an optional 2 doses available to treat any recurrence within 24 h of taking dose 
      1. Pizotifen was built up to a final daily dose of 1.5 mg over a 2-week period
      and patients remained on this dose for a further 10 weeks. Patients in the
      blinded study were given matching placebo tablets for one of the two treatment
      periods. The efficacy of sumatriptan was not affected by pizotifen. The median of
      the monthly attack rate experienced by patients was slightly lower whilst
      patients were on pizotifen and sumatriptan than while on placebo prophylaxis and 
      sumatriptan or sumatriptan alone; study 1, 3.5 vs 3.9 attacks per month (p =
      0.008); study 2, 2.9 vs. 3.2 attacks per month (p = 0.23). Also, while on
      pizotifen and sumatriptan more patients had a greater proportion of their time in
      the study migraine-free. From the results of these studies it does not appear
      that pizotifen reduces migraine severity; regardless of the treatment regimen the
      initial headache severity of most attacks was moderate. Weight gains experienced 
      by patients while on pizotifen and sumatriptan were greater than the weight gains
      experienced while on placebo prophylaxis and sumatriptan or sumatriptan alone
      (period 1); study 1, 2.6 vs. 1.0 kg (p = 0.002); study 2, 1.6 vs. -0.8 kg (p <
      0.0001). The combination of pizotifen and sumatriptan did not result in any
      additional adverse events other than those usually seen with each medication
      alone. In these studies, where the average number of migraine attacks was around 
      4 per month, the benefits conferred by pizotifen were at the expense of the
      adverse events associated with the drug, particularly weight gain. Therefore the 
      clinical benefit of treatment with pizotifen for patients who have less than 4
      attacks per month should be carefully reviewed as acute treatment with
      sumatriptan may be the most appropriate treatment. Pizotifen may be better
      reserved for those patients who have 4 of more attacks per month.

TI  - Comparison of the vasoconstrictor properties of the 5-HT1D-receptor agonists
      rizatriptan (MK-462) and sumatriptan in human isolated coronary artery: outcome
      of two independent studies using different experimental protocols.
PG  - 3-9
AB  - Rizatriptan (MK-462) is a novel 5-HT1D-receptor agonist and is effective in the
      treatment of migraine headache. As angiographic studies have shown that the
      prototypic 5-HT1D/1B-receptor agonist sumatriptan can cause coronary artery
      constriction in patients with mild coronary artery disease, we have compared the 
      contractile effects of rizatriptan on human isolated coronary artery with those
      of sumatriptan and 5-HT. Two different experimental protocols were used. In Study
      1 (to avoid agonist desensitisation and interaction effects), arterial segments
      were exposed to a single agonist (either 5-HT, sumatriptan or rizatriptan) and in
      Study 2 each arterial segment was exposed to all three agonists with randomised
      first exposure to sumatriptan or rizatriptan. In both these studies the maximum
      contractions evoked by sumatriptan and rizatriptan were found to be smaller than 
      those evoked by 5-HT, and the maximum contraction evoked by rizatriptan was
      significantly smaller than that for sumatriptan.

      surrogate indicators of Parkinson's disease in the United States.
PG  - 105-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare two surrogate indicators of population disease burden for
      Parkinson's disease: utilization of Sinemet and Parkinson's disease mortality.
      DESIGN: National Center for Health Statistics data were used to tabulate
      Parkinson's disease mortality in the United States by state for 1987-1989.
      Sinemet sales data by state were obtained from Merck & Co., Inc. for 1988. Least 
      squares regression analyses were used to assess the relationship between Sinemet 
      utilization and Parkinson's disease mortality. SETTING: United States. RESULTS:
      Regression analyses showed extraordinarily strong associations between
      state-level Parkinson's disease mortality and Sinemet utilization
      (underlying-cause model r2 = 0.969, p = 0.0001; multiple-cause model r2 = 0.980, 
      p = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Sinemet utilization very closely parallels Parkinson's 
      disease mortality, suggesting that Sinemet utilization and Parkinson's disease
      mortality are both useful indices of the population burden of Parkinson's disease
      for large-scale epidemiological studies.

TI  - Initial human experience with MK-462 (rizatriptan): a novel 5-HT1D agonist.
PG  - 49-54
AB  - AIMS: We evaluated the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral MK-462 in
      comparison with oral sumatriptan in healthy male volunteers. METHODS: Sixteen
      healthy male volunteers were studied in a rising, single dose, alternating panel 
      design with eight subjects per panel. Matching placebo was administered to two of
      eight study subjects at each dose level of MK-462 in a randomized, double-blind
      fashion. RESULTS: MK-462 was rapidly absorbed with a median tmax of 1.3 h (range 
      1-3 h) vs a tmax for sumatriptan of 2.5 h (range 1-4 h, P < 0.001).
      Administration of either MK-462 or sumatriptan produced maximal mean elevations
      of 5-10 mmHg in systolic and diastolic blood pressures without effect on heart
      rate; the changes occurred sooner following MK-462, consistent with more rapid
      absorption. Both MK-462 and sumatriptan provoked mild increases in serum growth
      hormone without any effect on serum prolactin concentrations. The most commonly
      reported symptom following MK-462 was drowsiness. CONCLUSIONS: These results
      indicate that the novel 5-HT1D agonist, MK-462, is rapidly absorbed following
      oral administration and warrants further investigation of its utility in the
      treatment of acute migraine.

      subjects using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design. Sumatriptan
      significantly elevated plasma growth hormone but did not alter plasma prolactin. 
      Sumatriptan also significantly lowered total food intake in a buffet meal,
      particularly decreasing the intake of fat. Our results indicate that 5-HT1B/ID
      receptors may be involved in the regulation of food intake in humans. In
      addition, while activation of 5-HT1B/ID receptors stimulates growth hormone
      release in both men and women, sumatriptan lowers plasma prolactin only in men,
      suggesting sex differences in the 5-HT regulation of prolactin release.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of sumatriptan in a managed care population.
PG  - 117-22
AB  - We conducted an open-labeled study to determine whether sumatriptan is more
      cost-effective than other therapies used to treat migraine headache. We contacted
      by phone 220 sumatriptan users enrolled in QualMed, a health maintenance
      organization (HMO) in Spokane, Washington. Of these, 203 met the inclusion
      criteria and 164 (81%) completed our telephone survey. The main outcome measures 
      were healthcare costs to the HMO and number of days free of migraine-related
      disability before and after sumatriptan treatment. Before sumatriptan treatment, 
      89% of patients reported severe migraine, compared with 63% after sumatriptan
      treatment. The number of monthly migraine disability days decreased from 6.5 days
      per month before sumatriptan to 3.9 days per month after sumatriptan. Healthcare 
      utilization rates (ie, number of hospitalizations, emergency department visits)
      and costs were lower after the patients began taking sumatriptan. The number of
      different over-the-counter medicines and prescription medications (other than
      sumatriptan) taken for migraine disabilities decreased. Although total drug
      expenditures per month increased, the total migraine healthcare expenditure was
      41% lower after sumatriptan was initiated. The cost-effectiveness ratio was 47%
      more favorable after patients started taking sumatriptan. Overall, patients
      reported fewer migraine-related disabilities, had lower migraine severity scores,
      and used fewer healthcare resources when taking sumatriptan. These changes
      resulted in a better cost-effectiveness ratio for migraine treatment.

AB  - This report describes the patient satisfaction results from a prospective,
      sequential, multinational study. The study was conducted to concurrently evaluate
      the effects of sumatriptan, compared with customary therapy, on clinical
      parameters, health-related quality of life, productivity and patient satisfaction
      in adult patients with moderate to severe migraine. Patients treated migraine
      attacks for 12 weeks with their customary therapy, followed by 24 weeks'
      treatment with subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg. A questionnaire was conducted at
      the end of each study phase, or retrospectively at the end of the study, to
      assess patient satisfaction with customary therapy and sumatriptan. Sumatriptan
      was considered by most patients (67 to 85%) to be dependable and fast-acting, and
      to have a long duration of effect, allowing a quick return to normal activities. 
      By comparison, 15 to 32% of patients considered that their customary therapy
      possessed the same attributes. However, customary therapy was considered to be
      easy/very easy to use by 82% of patients compared with 62% for subcutaneous
      sumatriptan. 89% of patients indicated that they would use sumatriptan again in
      the future. This study demonstrates that treatment of migraine attacks with
      subcutaneous sumatriptan for 24 weeks is associated with greater patient
      satisfaction as regards specific drug attributes than customary therapy.

AB  - This report presents the workplace productivity and non-workplace activity
      results of a multinational study of the effects of subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg 
      in the acute treatment of migraine compared with patient's customary therapy.
      Patients diagnosed with migraine treated their symptoms for 24 weeks with
      subcutaneous sumatriptan after a 12-week period of treating symptoms with their
      customary (non-sumatriptan) therapy. Patients used diary cards to record
      information concerning the effects of migraine on workplace productivity and
      non-workplace activity time. The average workplace productivity time lost was
      23.4 hours per patient during 12 weeks of customary therapy, compared with 7.2
      and 5.8 hours per patient during the first and second 12-week periods of
      sumatriptan therapy, respectively. An average of 9.3 hours of non-workplace
      activity time was lost per patient during the customary therapy phase, compared
      with 3.2 and 2.8 hours during the first and second 12-week periods of sumatriptan
      therapy, respectively. Treatment of migraine with subcutaneous sumatriptan
      compared with customary therapy was associated with an average gain per patient
      of approximately 16 hours of workplace productivity time and 6 hours of
      non-workplace activity time, over a 3-month period.

AB  - The aim of this prospective sequential multinational (5 countries) study was to
      concurrently evaluate the effects of subcutaneous sumatriptan on clinical
      parameters, health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) measures, workplace
      productivity and patient satisfaction. This report presents the HRQOL results.
      582 patients (aged 18 to 65 years) with moderate to severe migraine received
      their customary antimigraine therapy for 12 weeks and then subcutaneous
      sumatriptan for 24 weeks. The Short Form-36 Health Survey and the
      Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire were completed at a screening
      visit (base-line), at the end of the 12-week customary therapy phase, and at 12
      and 24 weeks of the sumatriptan phase. Scores for most of the Short Form-36
      dimensions improved significantly (p < 0.05) after 12 and 24 weeks of sumatriptan
      therapy compared with 12 weeks of customary therapy, in each country. Similarly, 
      scores on all Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire dimensions were
      significantly (p < 0.05; paired t-test) improved after 12 weeks (in all
      countries) and 24 weeks (in 4 of 5 countries) of sumatriptan therapy compared
      with 12 weeks of customary therapy. This study demonstrates that, in 5 countries,
      treatment of migraine attacks with subcutaneous sumatriptan compared with
      customary therapy was associated with improvements in HRQOL, as measured by both 
      general health status and disease-specific instruments.

AB  - This report describes the design, methods and clinical results of a prospective
      sequential multinational (5 countries) study conducted to evaluate the effects of
      subcutaneous sumatriptan on health-related quality of life, workplace
      productivity, clinical parameters and patient satisfaction. Adult patients with
      moderate to severe migraine initially received customary therapy for migraine
      episodes for 12 weeks, followed by 24 weeks' treatment with self-administered
      subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg. Demographic, baseline, health-related quality of
      life and patient satisfaction rating data were collected during visits to the
      clinic. Data relating to migraine symptoms, migraine therapy, work productivity
      and non-work activity time were collected on diary cards filled out by the
      patients. 749 patients were recruited to the study and 637 received at least 1
      dose of sumatriptan. Overall, 75.5% of migraines were successfully treated within
      2 hours with sumatriptan compared with 31.9% with customary therapy; 36% of
      patients reported complete relief at 2 hours with sumatriptan treatment compared 
      with 1% of patients receiving customary therapy. 69% of patients successfully
      treated 70% of their migraines with sumatriptan within 2 hours, compared with 12%
      of patients with customary therapy. No serious adverse events were reported; 50% 
      of patients reported an adverse event during the 12-week customary therapy phase 
      and 89% of patients during the 24-week sumatriptan phase. These clinical results,
      which are consistent with those reported in randomised blinded studies of
      subcutaneous sumatriptan, suggest that relief of migraine symptoms occurs more
      often, and in less time, in patients receiving subcutaneous sumatriptan rather
      than customary therapy as their primary medication.

TI  - Sumatriptan and lost productivity time: a time series analysis of diary data.
PG  - 1263-75
AB  - Two previously conducted clinical studies assessed lost nonworkplace activity
      time and lost workplace productivity time due to migraine symptoms in subjects
      using sumatriptan for 6 months to treat their migraines after a 12- to 18-week
      period of using their usual therapy without sumatriptan. Although statistically
      significant differences in lost nonworkplace activity time and lost workplace
      productivity time between the usual therapy and sumatriptan treatment periods
      were detected using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, this test could not determine 
      whether differences were attributable to inherent trends in the data. This
      current study employed time series analysis, which detects and controls for
      preexisting trends in data, to further explore the possibility that the observed 
      reductions in lost time in the two clinical studies were related to management of
      the subjects with sumatriptan. The intercepts and slopes of the computed linear
      models suggest that the initiation of sumatriptan therapy produced savings of 0.8
      hours of nonworkplace activity time and 0.5 hours of workplace productivity time 
      per patient per week. These savings were sustained throughout the sumatriptan
      treatment period. Preexisting trends in the data were not detected in the models.
      Thus the productivity gains are not associated with either time effects or the
      statistical phenomenon of regression to the mean, but variables that are extreme 
      in initial measurements will tend to be closer to the center of the distribution 
      in subsequent measurements. This strengthens the hypothesis that management of
      migraine with sumatriptan is associated with reductions in lost productivity
      time.

TI  - Alniditan in the acute treatment of migraine attacks: a subcutaneous dose-finding
      study. Subcutaneous Alniditan Study Group.
PG  - 497-502
AB  - Alniditan is a new 5HT1D receptor agonist, belonging to a different chemical
      class from sumatriptan and other indole derivatives used or being developed for
      the treatment of acute migraine. In a multinational double-blind randomized
      parallel-groups dose-finding trial, alniditan was given subcutaneously in
      hospital to patients with migraine headache of moderate or severe intensity at
      doses of 0.8 mg (n = 44), 1.0 mg (n = 42), 1.2 mg (n = 46) and 1.4 mg (n = 39).
      Efficacy, tolerability and safety of each dose were compared with those of
      placebo (n = 41). At 2 h after injection, headache was absent or mild in 83% and 
      82% of patients receiving alniditan 1.2 and 1.4 mg respectively compared with 39%
      for placebo (p < or = 0.002). Complete relief from headache was achieved in 72%
      (1.4 mg). Time to onset of relief decreased with increasing alniditan dose, and
      there was a dose-dependent reduction in headache recurrence rate: 25% of patients
      receiving 1.4 mg had responded by 15 min and headache recurred within 24 h in
      only 16% of the patients who initially responded to alniditan 1.4 mg,
      significantly less than for placebo (p = 0.018). Alniditan was superior to
      placebo in reducing the associated symptoms of nausea, phonophobia and
      photophobia, and in increasing patients' functional ability. The use of rescue
      medication was reduced when compared with placebo, and up to 87% of patients said
      that they would use the drug again if available. No clinically relevant
      cardiovascular effects were seen, nor consistent changes in clinical laboratory
      findings. Adverse effects, mainly head pressure, paraesthesia, and hot flushes,
      were reported by 34% of placebo-treated patients and up to 70% of patients
      receiving alniditan, but all doses were very well tolerated and no clear
      relationship with dose was established. Comparison with published findings
      suggests that alniditan 1.4 mg sc may have advantages over sumatriptan 6 mg sc in
      providing complete relief from acute migraine headache, and may be associated
      with fewer headache recurrences within 24 h. Both of these suggestions warrant
      further and larger trials of alniditan in acute migraine.

TI  - Melatonin versus placebo in the prophylaxis of cluster headache: a double-blind
      pilot study with parallel groups.
PG  - 494-6
AB  - A fall in nocturnal plasma melatonin occurs in patients with cluster headache,
      suggesting that melatonin may play a role in the promotion of attacks. During a
      cluster period, we administered melatonin to 20 cluster headache patients (2
      primary chronic, 18 episodic) in a double-blind placebo-controlled study of oral 
      melatonin 10 mg (n = 10) or placebo (n = 10) for 14 days taken in a single
      evening dose. Headache frequency was significantly reduced (ANOVA, p < 0.03) and 
      there were strong trends towards reduced analgesic consumption (ANOVA, p < 0.06) 
      in the treatment group. Five of the 10 treated patients were responders whose
      attack frequency declined 3-5 days after treatment, and they experienced no
      further attacks until melatonin was discontinued. The chronic cluster patients
      did not respond. No patient in the placebo group responded. There were no side
      effects in either group. Although the response rate is low, melatonin may be
      suitable for cluster headache prophylaxis in some patients, particularly those
      who cannot tolerate other drugs.

AB  - When caring for patients with disorders of the central nervous system such as
      migraine headaches, epilepsy, or MS, clinicians are faced with increasingly
      complex pharmacotherapeutic options. Pharmacotherapeutic strategies directed
      toward prevention, reversal, or cure of these diseases are hampered by an

      brain, basic science research combined with difficult but necessary clinical
      trials may answer some seemingly overwhelming questions for these devastating
      illnesses.

TI  - Rizatriptan vs sumatriptan in the acute treatment of migraine. A
      placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study. Dutch/US Rizatriptan Study Group.
PG  - 1132-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rizatriptan (MK-462) is a new 5-hydroxytryptamine1D (serotonin1D;
      5-HT1D) receptor agonist for the acute treatment of migraine that has improved
      pharmacokinetic properties compared with sumatriptan succinate. OBJECTIVE: To
      assess the efficacy and tolerability of 10-, 20-, and 40-mg doses of oral
      rizatriptan vs a 100-mg dose of oral sumatriptan succinate and placebo for the
      acute treatment of migraine. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, parallel-group,
      placebo-controlled, outpatient trial. SETTING: Ten US and 4 Dutch investigator
      centers. PATIENTS: Patients who had migraine with or without aura (N = 449). MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURE: The proportion of patients whose conditions improved from severe
      or moderate headache immediately before dosing to mild or no headache at 2 hours 
      after drug administration (ie, headache relief). RESULTS: The proportion of
      patients with headache relief was 18% for placebo; 46% for sumatriptan; and 52%
      for 10-mg, 56% for 20-mg, and 67% for 40-mg rizatriptan. All differences with
      placebo were statistically significant (P < .001), and 40-mg rizatriptan was
      superior to sumatriptan (P = .01). The proportion of patients who became free of 
      pain at 2 hours was 3% for the placebo-treated group; 22% for the
      sumatriptan-treated group; and 26%, 35%, and 47% for the group of patients who
      took the 10-, 20-, and 40-mg doses of rizatriptan, respectively (all differences 
      with placebo, P < .005; 40-mg rizatripan vs sumatriptan, P = .001). The
      recurrence of headache within 24 hours was found to be equal across all treatment
      groups-approximately 40%. Adverse events (most commonly short-lasting mild or
      moderate dizziness and drowsiness) occurred more frequently after a 40-mg dose of
      rizatriptan was given than after the other treatments. CONCLUSIONS: The
      antimigraine effect of 10- and 20-mg rizatriptan was superior to placebo, and
      comparable with that of 100-mg sumatriptan succinate; the efficacy of 40-mg
      rizatriptan was superior to that of both placebo and 100-mg sumatriptan
      succinate, although it was associated with a high frequency of adverse events.

TI  - Prescribing practices for the management of headache in Newfoundland and
      Labrador.
PG  - 542-6
AB  - To assess the impact of sumatriptan in clinical practice, we undertook a
      retrospective analysis of the government of Newfoundland and Labrador's
      prescription drug program data base for 35 consecutive patients prescribed
      sumatriptan. The number of doses of all drugs prescribed ranged from 121 to
      18,874 on from 4 to 357 prescriptions per patient over 1 to 19 months. The mean
      number of doses of analgesic drugs prescribed before sumatriptan therapy was 56
      per month and after initiation of sumatriptan was 46 per month. The prescribing
      of multiple analgesics was common; 79% received three or more different
      analgesics. Twenty-two (63%) patients were prescribed medications indicated for
      the prophylaxis of migraine concomitantly with drugs indicated for symptomatic
      treatment. Twenty-four (69%) patients were prescribed medication capable of
      inducing migraine. We conclude that sumatriptan did not have a major impact on
      the outcomes of these patients judged by their use of analgesics. The simplest
      explanation is that many of the patients were suffering from analgesic-induced
      headache rather than migraine. In addition, we conclude that there were
      deficiencies in prescribing practices including numbers, quantities, and choice
      of analgesics; the use of analgesics concomitantly with drugs indicated for
      migraine prophylaxis; and the use of drugs capable of inducing migraine. Further 
      research is required to validate these findings.

TI  - Treatment of migraine with BMS180048: response at 2 hours. North American
      BMS180048 Study Group.
PG  - 523-30
AB  - BMS180048 is a 5HT agonist that was well-tolerated in early phase II trials. This
      study utilized a double-blind, parallel-group dose ranging format, comparing
      BMS180048 in doses of 25, 50, or 75 mg to placebo in effectiveness of treatment
      of a single migraine headache. To assess tolerability of BMS180048, patients
      received a test dose of the medication they would receive for a headache in the
      clinic under observation. If no significant side effects occurred, patients were 
      allowed to treat a headache. Headaches were moderate or severe in intensity
      before treatment, and response at 2 hours was tabulated. Reduction to mild or no 
      headache was the criteria for successful response. Response rates at 2 hours were
      as follows: placebo--19 of 53 subjects (35.8%); 25 mg--21 of 53 subjects (40.3%);
      50 mg--34 of 53 subjects (64.2%); 75 mg--35 of 55 subjects (63.6%) The
      improvement for subjects treated with 50 or 75 mg of BMS180048 when compared to
      placebo was highly significant (P < .01). Nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia
      improved 35% to 50% for BMS180048-treated subjects and 20% to 24% in the placebo 
      group. The improvement in these symptoms in comparison to placebo was
      statistically significant only for nausea in those treated with 75 mg of
      BMS180048 (P = .02). Side effects were mild for the most part, and no serious
      adverse events occurred. The study suggests BMS180048 is effective in acute
      symptomatic therapy of migraine.

      A human model for development of migraine drugs.
PG  - 412-8
AB  - Experimental "vascular" headache in humans may be used in characterizing new
      migraine drugs. The effects of sumatriptan on nitroglycerin-(NTG)-induced
      headache and arterial responses were therefore studied. Following a double-blind 
      randomized crossover design, 10 healthy volunteers received sumatriptan 6 mg s.c.
      or placebo succeeded by 20 min NTG (0.12 microgram/kg/min) infusion. Headache was
      rated on a 10 points scale. Temporal and radial artery diameters and velocity in 
      the middle cerebral artery (MCA) were measured with ultrasound. Sumatriptan
      reduced the NTG-induced headache, median score 1.5 versus 4 after placebo (p <
      0.01) and decreased temporal and radial artery diameters 75 +/- 3 and 86 +/- 3%
      of baseline respectively (p < 0.05). Blood velocity in the MCA was unaffected.
      The NTG model may prove to be a valuable tool in the development of future
      migraine drugs. The results suggest that NTG headache in non-migraineurs may
      share mechanisms with migraine headache.

TI  - A double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, study to evaluate the efficacy of 
      subcutaneous sumatriptan in the treatment of atypical facial pain.
PG  - 301-9
AB  - A double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study was undertaken to assess the
      efficacy and tolerability of sumatriptan in patients with atypical facial pain.
      Patients were aged 18-65 years and had at least a 6 months history of atypical
      facial pain. A total of 19 patients were recruited and assessed for pain scores
      (total, sensory and affective) by using a short form McGill pain questionnaire
      preinjection and and at 60 and 120 minutes after subcutaneous injection of
      sumatriptan (6 mg) or placebo. Safety and tolerability was assessed by recording 
      adverse events during and after the injection. One patient received only one
      treatment since her pain symptoms resolved after the first treatment. Rest of the
      patients returned to the clinic 3-6 weeks later and received alternate treatment 
      for atypical facial pain in the same fashion as on the first occasion. Treatment 
      of patients with sumatriptan produced significant relief in sensory, affective
      and total pain at 120 minutes postinjection (P < .05). Sumatriptan failed to
      produce a significant reduction in sensory and total pain scores at 60 minutes
      following treatment, however the result was statistically significant for the
      affective pain score (P < .05). No death or other serious adverse events were
      reported. No patient was withdrawn from the study due to an adverse event.
      However, all the patients treated with sumatriptan experienced one or more
      adverse events. The most common reported adverse symptoms during the sumatriptan 
      treatment period were injection site reactions, headache, feeling of heaviness,
      warm or hot sensation and disorders of mouth or tongue. However, most of these
      side effects were mild and transient. In conclusion, this study points towards
      some beneficial effect of a single subcutaneous injection of sumatriptan in the
      treatment of atypical facial pain. However, this data is not sufficient to
      suggest the clinical utility of subcutaneous sumatriptan (6 mg) for the
      management of atypical facial pain. Further studies are necessary to test the
      effects of prolonged subcutaneous and oral multiple dose administration of
      sumatriptan for the treatment of atypical facial pain.

TI  - High-dose versus low-dose valproic acid as a prophylactic medication.
PG  - 514-5
AB  - Valproic acid has been shown to be effective in migraine prophylaxis. Its method 
      of action is believed to be the inhibition of gamma-aminobutyric acid
      transaminase. The therapeutic dose needed to prevent migraine headaches has been 
      examined in several studies, yet the optimum dose has not been found. In this
      case report, valproic acid was given to a 24-year-old woman with chronic
      headaches at 1000 mg per day. Her headaches resolved for 2 months. She tapered
      herself off of the medication, and her headaches returned. She was restarted at
      500 mg per day of valproic acid and again, her headaches resolved. She preferred 
      being on the lower dose which she found as effective as the higher dose. Her case
      makes two interesting points. The first is that lower dosages of valproic acid
      may be as effective as higher ones in headache prophylaxis. The second is that
      more studies looking at dose ranges are needed to correlate effectiveness with
      daily requirements.

TI  - Ketorolac vs chlorpromazine in the treatment of acute migraine without aura. A
      prospective, randomized, double-blind trial.
PG  - 1725-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many treatments for acute migraine exist. Chlorpromazine is effective
      but has serious side effects. Ketorolac has only rare side effects. OBJECTIVE: To
      compare intramuscular ketorolac troinethamine with intravenous chlorpromazine
      hydrochloride in treating acute migraine. METHODS: We performed a prospective,
      randomized, double-blind trial comparing the clinical effectiveness of 60 mg of
      intramuscular ketorolac tromethamine with 25 mg of intravenous chlorpromazine
      hydrochloride in patients with acute migraine headache seen in the emergency
      department. Pain intensity, quantitated using the Wong-Baker Faces Rating Scale, 
      was measured every 30 minutes for 2 hours in the emergency department. Patients
      returned pain scores at 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours by mail. RESULTS: Fifteen
      patients were entered into each treatment arm. No differences were seen between
      the mean pain scores or the mean change in pain scores. The ketorolac group mean 
      (+/- SEM) pain score decreased from 4.07 +/- 0.18 to 0.73 +/- 0.3 in 2 hours. The
      chlorpromazine group pain score decreased from 4.47 +/- 0.17 to 0.87 +/- 0.4. Two
      of the 3 nonresponders responded to the alternate group's treatment. No side
      effects were seen. CONCLUSIONS: Using 60 mg of intramuscular ketorolac
      tromethamine is as effective as 25 mg of intravenous chlorpromazine hydrochloride
      in the treatment of acute migraine headache. Patients who do not respond to one
      of these medications may respond to the other.

TI  - Oral sumatriptan in the acute treatment of migraine and migraine recurrence in
      general practice.
PG  - 613-22
AB  - We investigated the efficacy, safety and tolerability compared with placebo of a 
      second dose of oral sumatriptan 100 mg in 1349 general practice patients who had 
      already treated a moderate or severe migraine headache with 100 mg sumatriptan 4 
      h earlier. Headache was relieved by the first sumatriptan dose in about 70% of
      patients, but the second dose did not produce significantly more relief than
      placebo, either in non-responders or in the group as a whole, nor did it reduce
      other symptoms (photophobia, nausea, vomiting, etc.) at 8 h, or influence the
      incidence of headache recurrence. The drug was well-tolerated, and a further
      single dose was effective in treating recurrence after initial relief. A single
      100 mg dose of sumatriptan is an effective acute treatment for migraine. A second
      dose should be reserved for treating headache recurrence.

TI  - A comparison of subcutaneous sumatriptan and dihydroergotamine nasal spray in the
      acute treatment of migraine.
PG  - 361-5
AB  - We compared the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous (SC) sumatriptan (6 mg) with 
      that of dihydroergotamine (DHE) nasal spray (1 mg plus optional 1 mg) in the
      acute treatment of migraine. Two hundred sixty-six adult migraineurs
      (International Headache Society criteria) completed a multicenter, double-blind, 
      double-dummy, cross-over study. Patients took SC sumatriptan for one attack and
      DHE nasal spray for the other in random order. Data from both treatment periods
      show that at all time points from 15 minutes, SC sumatriptan was significantly
      better than DHE nasal spray at providing both headache relief (moderate/severe
      headache improving to mild/none) and resolution of headache. Similarly, SC
      sumatriptan was superior to DHE nasal spray for the other efficacy end points
      assessed in the study. Patients reported that both treatments were well
      tolerated. Adverse events were reported by 43% of patients taking SC sumatriptan 
      and 22% of patients taking DHE nasal spray. These were usually mild and
      transient. We conclude that subcutaneous sumatriptan has a faster onset of action
      than DHE nasal spray and provides greater relief of acute migraine symptoms.

AB  - The efficacy and tolerability of subcutaneous (SC) sumatriptan administered with 
      the IMITREX (sumatriptan succinate) STATdose System, which circumvents the need
      for patients or health care professionals to handle a syringe, were evaluated in 
      two randomized, double-masked, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multicenter
      studies. In the clinic, 158 adults with migraine diagnosed according to
      International Headache Society criteria received SC sumatriptan (6 mg) or placebo
      delivered with the IMITREX STATdose System for treatment of a migraine attack. By
      120 minutes after SC dosing, 73% and 79% of sumatriptan-treated patients,
      compared with 28% and 37% of placebo-treated patients in studies 1 and 2,
      respectively, experienced headache relief (a statistically significant
      difference). Clinical disability scores 120 minutes after dosing showed that 75% 
      and 85% of sumatriptan-treated patients, compared with 30% and 42% of
      placebo-treated patients, were normal or only mildly impaired (a statistically
      significant difference). Similar efficacy rates were observed for nausea,
      phonophobia, and photophobia. No serious or unusual adverse events occurred, and 
      no clinically relevant abnormalities in laboratory test values were reported.
      Based on these results, we concluded that SC sumatriptan (6 mg) administered
      using the IMITREX STATdose System is effective for the treatment of migraine. The
      efficacy and tolerability profiles of SC sumatriptan administered with this
      device are similar to those reported for SC sumatriptan administered with a
      conventional syringe.

PG  - 831-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To discuss the pathogenesis, incidence, and clinical presentation of
      postdural puncture headaches (PDPHs) and to provide a comprehensive evaluation on
      the pharmacologic management of PDPH. DATA SOURCE: A MEDLINE search was used to
      identify pertinent literature published in English including review articles,
      case reports, letters, and abstracts. Information was also extracted from
      textbooks for background purposes. STUDY SELECTION: All clinical studies, case
      reports, abstracts, and letters were included because of the limited amount of
      literature available on the pharmacologic therapy for PDPH. Related research
      articles and review articles were also used to provide background information on 
      PDPH. DATA EXTRACTION: Methodology and results from clinical trials and abstracts
      were described and evaluated. Case reports and letters were summarized and
      critically reviewed for the feasibility of the different treatment modalities.
      Information on the pathophysiology, incidence and severity, and clinical
      presentation of PDPH was extracted from related research articles, review
      articles, and textbooks. DATA SYNTHESIS: The epidural blood patch (EBP) is one of
      the most effective treatments for PDPH. Pharmacologic management of PDPH offers a
      less invasive treatment modality than the EBP. Numerous drug therapies have been 
      presented in the literature, though few merit clinical application. Caffeine
      therapy, both oral and parenteral, is the most commonly used pharmacologic
      treatment modality. Theophylline and sumatriptan are potentially promising agents
      for the treatment of PDPH. Epidural administration of fluids and drugs is also
      effective in the treatment of PDPH. Epidural adrenocorticotropic hormone and
      epidural morphine also demonstrate some potential in the treatment of PDPH.
      Individual patient characteristics (i.e., HIV, sepsis) need to be considered when
      deciding on a treatment. More reports, especially clinical studies, are necessary
      before a definitive statement can be made regarding any one treatment. In the
      meantime, therapy will be guided by clinical judgement based on the literature
      reviewed in this article. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous and oral caffeine are
      effective and noninvasive treatments for PDPH. Epidural NaCl 0.9% or dextran are 
      alternatives when the EBP is unsuccessful or contraindicated. Several methods of 
      pharmacologic management have been cited in the literature, but all require
      further evaluation.

TI  - Alternatives in drug treatment of chronic paroxysmal hemicrania.
PG  - 429-32
AB  - Indomethacin is the drug of first choice in chronic paroxysmal hemicrania with
      clear relief of pain as a diagnostic criterion. In a few cases, indomethacin is
      not tolerated because of side effects. Therefore, the efficacy of carbamazepine, 
      verapamil, sumatriptan, acetylsalicylic acid, and oxygen as drugs in the
      prophylactic or acute treatment of chronic paroxysmal hemicrania was studied in a
      prospective open trial with 10 patients suffering from chronic paroxysmal
      hemicrania. The trial results, in accordance with a review of the literature,
      suggest that acetylsalicylic acid (and probably naproxen and diclofenac) and
      verapamil are the most effective drugs of second choice in chronic paroxysmal
      hemicrania. The efficacy of sumatriptan in this condition needs still to be
      clarified, although there is evidence for partial efficacy. Carbamazepine and
      oxygen did not show any significant influence on chronic paroxysmal hemicrania.

TI  - Subcutaneous sumatriptan in the clinical setting: the first 50 consecutive
      patients with acute migraine in a pediatric neurology office practice.
PG  - 419-22
AB  - An open prospective study was undertaken to assess the efficacy and safety of
      subcutaneous sumatriptan in 50 consecutive children ages 6 to 18 years with
      severe migraine. There were 28 females and 22 males. The dose of sumatriptan was 
      0.06 mg/kg. Parameters included overall efficacy, time to relief, recurrence
      rate, adverse events, and objective global rating. Overall efficacy, defined by
      headache reduction from severe or moderate to mild or none, was 78%. Twenty-six
      percent responded within 30 minutes, 46% responded in 60 minutes, and 6%
      responded between 1 to 2 hours. Twenty-two percent had no response or a
      suboptimal response. Recurrence rate was only 6%. There was a difference in
      efficacy between male and female, as 91% of the males responded, while only 68%
      of the females responded. The males had more migraine alone while the females had
      migraine often with a coexistent tension-type headache. Eighty percent of all the
      patients had some adverse event which was usually mild and transient; however,
      one patient developed a transitory confusional state which resolved in 2 hours.
      Eighty-four percent reported a global rating of good to excellent, while 16%
      rated the treatment only fair to poor. These findings suggest that subcutaneous
      sumatriptan can be both effective and safe in childhood migraine, especially in
      dealing with migraine alone.

TI  - Comparing dihydroergotamine mesylate and sumatriptan in the management of acute
      migraine. A retrospective cost-efficacy analysis.
PG  - 59-71
AB  - The annual cost of managing migraine totals billions of US dollars. This
      retrospective economic analysis of a clinical trial comparing subcutaneous
      dihydroergotamine mesylate (DHE) with subcutaneous sumatriptan in the treatment
      of acute migraine is appropriate because, although each product has been shown to
      be efficacious, the acquisition cost of sumatriptan is over 3 times that of DHE. 
      Total costs in each treatment group were calculated and applied independently to 
      11 clinical trial efficacy measures. Three of the efficacy measures showed no
      statistically significant difference between treatment arms, leading to a
      decision to use the less expensive DHE. In 4 of the efficacy measures. DHE was
      the obvious choice because it is more efficacious and less expensive. For the
      final 4 efficacy measures, where sumatriptan is more efficacious and more
      expensive, incremental cost-efficacy ratios were calculated to determine the
      additional expenditure required to achieve outcomes associated with quick relief.
      Depending on the efficacy variable chosen and the assumptions used in the model, 
      the incremental cost-efficacy ratios ranged from $US4000 to $US6700 per year
      (1993 dollars) for each additional patient who is successfully treated with
      sumatriptan compared with DHE. Therefore, in a population of 100 migraineurs, an 
      additional 13 to 22 patients would achieve these short term benefits of
      sumatriptan, although it would cost an additional $US88 395 annually, given the
      assumptions made. Because each product has unique advantages, we conclude that
      the more cost-efficacious product is dependent on the outcome of interest and the
      amount that the patient or provider is willing to pay to achieve that outcome.

AB  - Most current randomised controlled trials concern the acute treatment of
      migraine. Sumatriptan, a serotonin receptor agonist, was evaluated in 8
      randomised controlled trials. Using a novel cartridge self-injector system
      subcutaneous sumatriptan was found superior to placebo, and oral sumatriptan in
      doses from 25 mg to 100 mg was found superior to placebo with no difference among
      doses. An oral dose of 100 mg sumatriptan was not superior to a combination of
      lysine acetylsalicylate plus metoclopramide, and 100 mg sumatriptan given 4 hrs
      after subcutaneous sumatriptan could not prevent recurrence of headache. Nasal
      dihydroergotamine was found to have some efficacy in acute migraine treatment,
      whereas nasal butorphanol, although effective in repeated doses, was hampered by 
      many side effects. The prophylactic effect of valproate was confirmed in one
      randomised controlled trial.

TI  - 311C90 (Zolmitriptan), a novel centrally and peripheral acting oral
      5-hydroxytryptamine-1D agonist: a comparison of its absorption during a migraine 
      attack and in a migraine-free period.
PG  - 270-5
AB  - The oral absorption of a 10-mg oral dose of the novel 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT1D)
      agonist, 311C90, was compared during a moderate or severe migraine headache and
      in a migraine-free period in an open, two-period study. The safety and efficacy
      of 311C90 in acute migraine were also assessed. Twenty patients attended the
      clinics during a moderate or severe migraine attack and 18 patients returned for 
      a second dose in a migraine-free period. 311C90 was less rapidly absorbed during 
      a migraine attack compared to the migraine-free period, consistent with gastric
      stasis during a migraine attach. The median area under the curve (AUC) was 15.7
      ng/mlh lower during a migraine (median AUC: 18.4 ng/ml.h, range: 0-60.8 ng/ml.h) 
      compared to the migraine-free period (median AUC: 33.4 ng/ml.h, range 9.4-79.5
      ng/ml.h) (95% confidence interval: 6.9, 25.3) and the time to reach maximum
      plasma concentration was delayed (n = 18). Eleven out of 20 patients experienced 
      a significant improvement in migraine headache intensity at 2 h post-dose. Plasma
      311C90 concentrations were generally higher in those patients who responded to
      treatment with 311C90 in the plasma, but there was one patient with no
      quantifiable 311C90 in the plasma whose headache improved. Minor adverse
      experiences were reported in 11 out of 20 patients during a migraine attack and
      in 11 out of 18 patients outside an attack. They occurred shortly following drug 
      administration and were of short duration, but their occurrence did not appear to
      be related to plasma 311C90 concentration. There were no clinically significant
      changes in blood pressure or 12-lead ECG during the assessment period.

      multi-center, placebo-controlled and double-blind randomized study.
PG  - 257-63
AB  - In order to evaluate the prophylactic effect of oral magnesium, 81 patients aged 
      18-65 years with migraine according to the International Headache Society (IHS)
      criteria (mean attack frequency 3.6 per month) were examined. After a prospective
      baseline period of 4 weeks they received oral 600 mg (24 mmol) magnesium
      (trimagnesium dicitrate) daily for 12 weeks or placebo. In weeks 9-12 the attack 
      frequency was reduced by 41.6% in the magnesium group and by 15.8% in the placebo
      group compared to the baseline (p < 0.05). The number of days with migraine and
      the drug consumption for symptomatic treatment per patient also decreased
      significantly in the magnesium group. Duration and intensity of the attacks and
      the drug consumption per attack also tended to decrease compared to placebo but
      failed to be significant. Adverse events were diarrhea (18.6%) and gastric
      irritation (4.7%). High-dose oral magnesium appears to be effective in migraine
      prophylaxis.

      placebo and implications for the pathophysiology of migraine.
PG  - 60-5
AB  - Whether the primary mechanisms of migraine are vascular or neurogenic is, as yet,
      unresolved. In humans it is still unclear whether sumatriptan acts via
      constriction of dilated arteries or through other mechanisms. Doppler sonography 
      is a non-invasive method for measuring blood flow velocities (BFV), an indirect
      marker of vessel diameter. This double-blind crossover placebo-controlled trial
      investigated changes in BFV in extra- and intracranial arteries in 132 migraine
      attacks (66 patients) before and after treatment with either 6 mg sumatriptan
      s.c. or placebo. Significant increases in BFV were observed only in the middle
      cerebral artery (MCA) and the basilar artery (BA) after administration of
      sumatriptan. However, the majority of the patients showed no change in BFV
      following sumatriptan. No difference in BFV could be detected between headache
      and non-headache side or between migraine and headache free periods. Despite a
      slight increase in BFV in intracerebral arteries, this study does not support the
      concept that vasoconstriction is sumatriptan's principal mechanism in pain
      relief.

TI  - Management of depression in patients with coexisting medical illness.
PG  - 2125-33
AB  - Depressive illness is common in the general population, with a prevalence of 5
      percent. However, 10 to 15 percent of any general medical population has
      clinically significant depression; in patients with selected chronic illnesses,
      prevalence rates between 25 to 50 percent are noted. In patients with coexisting 
      medical illness, the diagnosis of depression requires differentiating symptoms of
      the medical illness from symptoms of the comorbid depression. The Diagnostic and 
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) can be helpful in this endeavor. 
      An understanding of the effect of particular medications on neurotransmitters is 
      required and can guide the clinician in selecting therapeutic agents that have a 
      low incidence of side effects and toxicity.

TI  - Different effects of the serotonergic agonists buspirone and sumatriptan on the
      posterior pituitary hormonal responses to hypoglycemia in humans.
PG  - 187-92
AB  - The responses of serum oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin (AVP) to the serotonergic
      HT1A agonist buspirone (15 mg p.o.) or the HTD1 agonist sumatriptan (6 mg
      injected subcutaneously) were evaluated in 7 normal men either in basal
      conditions or during an insulin (0.15 iu/kg as an i.v. bolus) tolerance test
      (ITT). Neither buspirone nor sumatriptan administration modified the basal
      secretion of AVP and OT. Stimulation of 5HT-1D receptors with sumatriptan was
      unable to change neither AVP nor OT response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia. On 
      the other hand, the pretreatment with the 5HT1A agonist buspirone significantly
      enhanced the OT response during hypoglycemia, without modifying the AVP rise. The
      results of this study suggest that serotonergic 5HT1A receptors may interact with
      hypoglycemia in the stimulation of OT, but not AVP secretion.

TI  - Paroxetine treatment and the prolactin response to sumatriptan.
PG  - 377-9
AB  - We studied the effect of the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI),
      paroxetine (20 mg daily for 16 days) on the neuroendocrine, cardiovascular,
      thermic and subjective responses to the 5-HT1D receptor agonist, sumatriptan (6
      mg, SC). Compared to placebo injection, sumatriptan lowered plasma prolactin and 
      oral temperature and increased diastolic blood pressure. While paroxetine
      increased baseline prolactin concentration, it had no effect on any of the
      responses to sumatriptan. In addition, paroxetine did not alter concentrations of
      sumatriptan in plasma. No adverse reactions resulted from the combination of
      sumatriptan and paroxetine. Our findings suggest that combined treatment with
      sumatriptan and paroxetine in the doses used in this study is not necessarily
      contra-indicated. In addition, short-term SSRI treatment may not desensitise
      5-HT1D autoreceptors in humans.

TI  - Comparison of the effects of clonidine on tyramine- and methoxamine-evoked
      mydriasis in man.
PG  - 269-75
AB  - 1. It has been reported previously that clonidine can potentiate tyramine-evoked 
      mydriasis on the pain-free side of cluster headache patients. We examined whether
      a single oral dose of clonidine (200 micrograms) can also potentiate
      tyramine-evoked mydriasis in healthy subjects, using mydriasis to methoxamine, a 
      directly acting sympathomimetic amine, as a control. 2. Eight healthy male
      volunteers participated in four weekly sessions. In the first two sessions
      (Experiment 1) the effect of clonidine or placebo on the mydriasis to tyramine
      hydrochloride eyedrops (75 mM; 2 x 10 microliters), and in the last two sessions 
      (Experiment 2) the effect of clonidine or placebo on the mydriasis to methoxamine
      hydrochloride eyedrops (20 mM; 2 x 10 microliters) was examined. In both
      experiments subjects were allocated to drugs and sessions according to a
      double-blind balanced design. In both experiments, pupil diameter of both the
      treated and the untreated eyes was recorded in standard ambient light and in the 
      dark, before, and 2 h after clonidine/placebo, via binocular infrared television 
      pupillometry. Salivation (dental roll technique), systolic and diastolic blood
      pressure (sitting), heart rate, and self-ratings of mood and feelings (visual
      analogue scales), were also measured before, and 2 h after the ingestion of
      clonidine or placebo. 3. Both tyramine and methoxamine produced a significant
      mydriasis, which was more prominent in the light condition (change in resting
      pupil size; mm +/- s.e.mean: tyramine/light 1.05 +/- 0.28; tyramine/dark: 0.73
      +/- 0.15; methoxamine/light: 1.65 +/- 0.28; methoxamine/dark: 0.85 +/- 0.15).
      Clonidine produced a significant miosis in the untreated eye which was more
      prominent in the light condition (change in resting pupil size; mm +/- s.e.mean: 
      Experiment 1, light: -1.34 +/- 0.19; Experiment 1, dark: -0.46 +/- 0.1;
      Experiment 2, light -0.97 +/- 0.18; Experiment 2, dark: -0.29 +/- 0.17).
      Clonidine had no significant effect on either tyramine- or methoxamine-evoked
      mydriasis. 4. In agreement with previous reports, clonidine significantly reduced
      salivation (g, mean +/- s.e.mean; Experiment 1: -0.84 +/- 0.22; Experiment 2:
      -0.55 +/- 0.11), systolic blood pressure (mm Hg; Experiment 1: -17.5 +/- 3.76;
      Experiment 2: -23.38 +/- 4.67), diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg; Experiment 2:
      -12.38 +/- 2.05), alertness (mm; Experiment 2: -24.19 +/- 5.40), and anxiety (mm;
      Experiment 1: -13.82 +/- 4.60), indicating the presence of pharmacodynamically
      effective tissue levels of the drug. 5. These results show that a single oral
      dose (200 micrograms) of clonidine causes significant miosis in human subjects,
      and fails to potentiate tyramine-evoked mydriasis. This indicates that the pupil 
      on the asymptomatic side of cluster headache patients is affected differently
      from the pupils of healthy volunteers by tyramine and/or clonidine.

TI  - Effect of hyperbaric oxygen on the immunoreactivity to substance P in the nasal
      mucosa of cluster headache patients.
PG  - 221-3
AB  - Exposure to hyperbaric oxygen has been shown to be effective in cluster headache,
      but the mechanism of the action is still not clear. Primary nociceptive neurons, 
      containing neuropeptides such as substance P and particularly those innervating
      the nasal mucosa, could be involved in the pathogenesis of cluster headache. The 
      present study evaluated the effect of an exposure to hyperbaric oxygen on the
      content of substance P in the nasal mucosa of patients affected by cluster
      headache. The results were compared with those observed in another group of
      cluster headache patients who underwent a placebo procedure. The samples of nasal
      mucosa were analyzed by immunocytochemical methods. A qualitative analysis of the
      slides was carried out by an operator under "blinded conditions". A marked
      decrease in the content of immunoreactivity for substance P was found in the
      patients exposed to hyperbaric oxygen. The decrease was statistically significant
      when compared with the findings of the placebo procedure. The results of the
      present study indicate that an influence on the content of peripheral
      neuropeptides could be involved in the mechanism of action of the beneficial
      effect of hyperbaric oxygen in cluster headache.

TI  - Pilot study of MK-462 in migraine.
PG  - 113-6
AB  - MK-462 is a potent, selective 5HT1D receptor agonist which may be useful in
      treating acute migraine. We conducted a double-blind placebo-controlled inpatient
      study to assess the preliminary efficacy and safety of oral doses of MK-462 20 mg
      (n = 8) and 40 mg (n = 36) vs placebo (n = 21), administered to 65 male and
      post-menopausal female migraine patients aged 22-51 with moderate or severe
      migraine headache. Headache severity and functional disability were measured at
      0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 h post-dose. The 20 mg dose was well tolerated and 4/8
      patients obtained relief in headache severity at the 2 h time point. The 40 mg
      dose was well tolerated and was significantly (p < 0.05) superior to placebo at
      the 1.5 and 2 h time points (with 27/36 or 75% obtaining relief at 2 h compared
      to 7/21 or 33% for placebo). Adverse events occurred in 50% of patients on 20 mg 
      MK-462, 72% of those on 40 mg MK-462, and in 52% of placebo-treated subjects. The
      most common adverse events associated with MK-462 were drowsiness (20 mg 12%; 40 
      mg 44%; placebo 24%), dry mouth (40 mg 36%; placebo 19%), and
      lightheadedness/dizziness (40 mg 17%; placebo 10%). Based on these preliminary
      results, MK-462 appears worthy of continued study for the treatment of acute
      migraine.

TI  - Impact of sumatriptan on workplace productivity, nonwork activities, and
      health-related quality of life among hospital employees with migraine.
PG  - 137-43
AB  - This prospective, open-label study evaluated the effects of subcutaneous
      sumatriptan versus usual therapy on workplace productivity, activity time outside
      of work, and health-related quality of life in 43 men or women who were hospital 
      employees diagnosed with migraine according to international Headache Society
      criteria. Patients treated migraines with their usual therapy for 12 to 18 weeks 
      followed by subcutaneous sumatriptan for 6 months. Health-related quality of life
      measurements obtained at baseline, after usual therapy, and after sumatriptan
      therapy included the Short Form-36 Health Survey and the Migraine-Specific
      Quality of Life Questionnaire. Patient daily diaries were used to capture data on
      migraine symptoms and on Lost Workplace Productivity and Non-workplace Activity
      Time. Traditional clinical efficacy measures were obtained to support the
      pharmacoeconomic data. Clinical data showed that the percentage of treated
      migraine days per patient on which the patient experienced relief (moderate or
      severe pain reduced to mild or none) was 75% with sumatriptan and 25% with usual 
      therapy. The mean time to meaningful relief was 1.1 hours during the sumatriptan 
      phase and 4.2 hours during the usual therapy phase. Lost Workplace Productivity
      and Nonworkplace Activity Time was 35% lower with sumatriptan therapy (1.5 hours)
      compared with usual therapy (2.3 hours). Time missed from work due to symptoms,
      time worked with symptoms, and time normal activities were carried on with
      symptoms were each lower during sumatriptan therapy compared with usual therapy. 
      Scores on each of the three Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire
      dimensions and on the Role-Emotional dimension of the Short Form-36 were
      significantly more favorable after sumatriptan than after usual therapy (P <
      0.05). These data demonstrate that treatment of migraines with sumatriptan for 6 
      months following usual therapy for 12 to 18 weeks was associated with improvement
      in clinical efficacy, reduction in lost workplace productivity and nonworkplace
      activity time, and enhancement of key dimensions of health-related quality of
      life among employees of a large university hospital.

TI  - Subcutaneous sumatriptan for the treatment of migraine: humanistic, economic, and
      clinical consequences.
PG  - 171-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study examined the humanistic, economic, and clinical
      consequences of using subcutaneous sumatriptan for 6 months for the acute
      treatment of migraine in 126 patients enrolled in a group-model health
      maintenance organization. METHODS: Patients received open-label sumatriptan (6
      mg) for the treatment of migraines that occurred during a 6-month period. For
      each migraine, patients recorded migraine pain severity (none, mild, moderate, or
      severe) before treatment and 2 hours posttreatment and the time until onset of
      patient-defined meaningful relief. Patients also completed both the Short Form-36
      Health Survey and Migraine-specific Quality of Life (QOL) Questionnaire at
      screening (to cover the period prior to initiation of treatment) and after 3 and 
      6 months of treatment. Patients' medical records were reviewed to obtain
      information on the frequency of migraine-related pharmacy use, general outpatient
      services, and urgent care services during the treatment period and the 12 months 
      prior to initiation of treatment. RESULTS: By 2 hours after the dose, 71% of
      patients had moderate or severe pain reduced to mild or none, and 86% of patients
      achieved meaningful relief. At 3 months and 6 months, sumatriptan was associated 
      with improvements relative to pre-sumatriptan baselines in Short Form-36 Health
      Survey and Migraine-specific QOL Questionnaire scores (P < .002). Sumatriptan was
      also associated with significant reductions in the average number of
      migraine-related general outpatient and urgent care services (P < .001).
      CONCLUSIONS: The use of sumatriptan for 6 months was associated with improvements
      in health-related quality of life, reductions in health care resource use, and a 
      high percentage of treatment successes.

TI  - Clinical presentation and treatment of migraine.
PG  - 229-45; discussion 228
AB  - The pathogenesis of migraine is not completely understood but may involve
      vasodilation of cerebral blood vessels and/or the release of vasoactive
      neuropeptides (ie, norepinephrine) from the perivascular axons in the dura mater 
      after activation of the trigeminovascular system. Many environmental factors and 
      physiologic influences may provoke a migraine or increase its severity. The
      typical migraine headache without aura is unilateral, pulsating, of
      moderate-to-severe intensity, and aggravated by physical activity. Migraine
      prevention is best achieved by avoidance of known migraine triggers or enhancers 
      and by reducing the amount of lifestyle stressors. Pharmacotherapeutic options in
      the treatment of migraine are discussed herein.

TI  - The tolerability and pharmacokinetics of the novel antimigraine compound 311C90
      in healthy male volunteers.
PG  - 141-7
AB  - 1. 311C90 is a novel and selective agonist at 5-HT1D receptors, with central and 
      peripheral actions, currently in development for the acute oral treatment of
      migraine. 2. The pharmacokinetic and tolerability profiles of single oral doses
      from 1-50 mg 311C90 were investigated in 12 healthy male volunteers in a
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating study. 3. 311C90 was well
      tolerated with most adverse experiences of mild and transient nature. 4.
      Absorption was rapid with dose-independent kinetics. Median tmax was 2-4 h
      although 50-85% of eventual Cmax was attained within 1 h. The t1/2 was 2.5-3 h
      with a high apparent plasma clearance (CL/F > 2000 ml min-1) and apparent volume 
      of distribution (Vz/F) of 400-500 l. 5. Three metabolites were detected in plasma
      and urine, one of which, the N-desmethyl metabolite, has 5-HT1D agonist activity.
      6. 311C90 showed no clinically significant effects on blood pressure, heart rate,
      ECG or laboratory variables at any dose and demonstrated a tolerability and
      pharmacokinetic profile compatible with an acute oral migraine treatment.

TI  - Assessing the quality of reports of randomized clinical trials: is blinding
      necessary?
PG  - 1-12
AB  - It has been suggested that the quality of clinical trials should be assessed by
      blinded raters to limit the risk of introducing bias into meta-analyses and
      systematic reviews, and into the peer-review process. There is very little
      evidence in the literature to substantiate this. This study describes the
      development of an instrument to assess the quality of reports of randomized
      clinical trials (RCTs) in pain research and its use to determine the effect of
      rater blinding on the assessments of quality. A multidisciplinary panel of six
      judges produced an initial version of the instrument. Fourteen raters from three 
      different backgrounds assessed the quality of 36 research reports in pain
      research, selected from three different samples. Seven were allocated randomly to
      perform the assessments under blind conditions. The final version of the
      instrument included three items. These items were scored consistently by all the 
      raters regardless of background and could discriminate between reports from the
      different samples. Blind assessments produced significantly lower and more
      consistent scores than open assessments. The implications of this finding for
      systematic reviews, meta-analytic research and the peer-review process are
      discussed.

TI  - A double-blind study of subcutaneous dihydroergotamine vs subcutaneous
      sumatriptan in the treatment of acute migraine.
PG  - 180-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and tolerability of subcutaneous
      dihydroergotamine mesylate (DHE-45) vs subcutaneous sumatriptan succinate
      (Imitrex) for the treatment of acute migraine with or without aura. DESIGN:
      Double-blind, randomized trial with parallel treatment arms. SETTING: Clinics and
      private neurology practices. SUBJECTS: Patients of either sex, with migraine with
      or without aura, between the ages of 18 and 65 years. INTERVENTIONS: Patients
      with moderate or severe head pain were randomized to receive either 1 mg of
      subcutaneous dihydroergotamine mesylate or 6 mg of subcutaneous sumatriptan
      succinate. Patients rated head pain, functional ability, nausea, and vomiting at 
      baseline and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 24 hours after the injection. Presence or
      absence of headache at 3 hours was calculated from collected data. If pain
      persisted after 2 hours, a second injection of the same study medication was
      allowed, and self-ratings were repeated 30 and 60 minutes later. Follow-up data
      were collected at 24 hours. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Relief of head pain and
      recurrence of successfully treated headache. RESULTS: There were 295 evaluable
      patients. At 2 hours, 73.1% of the patients treated with dihydroergotamine and
      85.3% of those treated with sumatriptan had relief (P = .002). There was no
      statistical difference in headache relief between the groups at 3 or 4 hours.
      Headache relief was achieved by 85.5% of those treated with dihydroergotamine and
      by 83.3% of those treated with sumatriptan by 4 hours. By 24 hours 89.7% of
      dihydroergotamine-treated patients and 76.7% of sumatriptan-treated patients had 
      relief (P = .004). Headache recurred within 24 hours after treatment in 45% of
      the sumatriptan-treated patients and in 17.7% of the dihydroergotamine-treated
      patients (P < or = .001). CONCLUSIONS: Both sumatriptan and dihydroergotamine
      were effective in aborting migraine headaches. Headache recurrence was two and a 
      half time as likely with sumatriptan as with dihydroergotamine.

TI  - 311C90, a new central and peripherally acting 5-HT1D receptor agonist in the
      acute oral treatment of migraine: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-range 
      finding study.
PG  - 522-6
AB  - 311C90 is a novel, centrally and peripherally, acting 5-hydroxytryptamine1D
      receptor agonist. We investigated the efficacy and safety of 1, 5, and 25 mg of
      oral 311C90 in the acute treatment of migraine in a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial involving 84 patients. The
      proportion of patients in whom the headache improved within 2 hours from moderate
      or severe to mild or no pain (primary efficacy measure) was 15% for
      placebo-treated patients and 27% (1 mg), 62% (5 mg), and 81% (25 mg) for patients
      treated with 311C90. Treatment differences compared with placebo were 12% (95% CI
      - 12, 37; p = 0.460) for 1 mg 311C90, 47% (CI 21, 73; p < 0.005) for 5 mg 311C90,
      and 66% (CI 43,89; p < 0.001) for 25 mg 311C90. Photophobia and nausea also
      showed improvement after 311C90. Adverse events were generally mild and transient
      in all treatment groups. There were no clinically significant changes in ECG
      recordings, blood pressure, or laboratory tests. Oral 311C90 (5 and 25 mg) is
      highly effective and well tolerated in the acute treatment of migraine. The
      response rates and treatment differences compared with placebo in this study
      suggest possible superiority over existing antimigraine therapies. This needs to 
      be confirmed in formal comparative trials.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and food interaction of MK-462 in healthy males.
PG  - 17-24
AB  - A study was conducted to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of
      single intravenous (IV) doses of 5-90 micrograms kg-1 of MK-462, and the effect
      of food on the pharmacokinetics of MK-462 administered orally to healthy males.
      Results of this study indicate that IV doses of MK-462 from 5 to 90 micrograms
      kg-1 are well tolerated. The disposition kinetics of MK-462 were linear for IV
      doses up to and including 60 micrograms kg-1. The values of the plasma clearance 
      (CL), steady-state volume of distribution (Vss), plasma terminal half-life
      (t1/2), and mean residence time in the body (MRT) of MK-462 averaged 1376 mL
      min-1, 140 L, 1.8 h, and 1.7 h, respectively, and remained essentially constant
      over the dosage range of 10-60 micrograms kg-1 of IV MK-462. However, as the dose
      increased from 60 to 90 micrograms kg-1, the mean value of the apparent CL
      decreased from 1376 to 807 mL min-1. Thus, elimination of MK-462 was dose
      dependent in this dosage range. Based on the disposition decomposition analysis
      (DDA), it was shown that the Vss value of MK-462 remained essentially constant
      over the dosage range of 10-90 micrograms kg-1 of IV MK-462. The following values
      of two dose-independent parameters were also calculated by using DDA:
      distribution clearance (CLd) = 2028 mL min-1, and mean transit time in the
      peripheral tissues (MTTT) = 0.74 h. The mean values of AUC, Cmax, tmax, and
      apparent t1/2 of MK-462 in 12 subjects each receiving a 40 mg tablet of MK-462
      without breakfast were 330 ng.h mL-1, 77 ng mL-1, 1.6 h, and 1.8 h, respectively.
      Although administration of a standard breakfast prior to dosing increased the AUC
      value (by approximately 20%) of MK-462 and delayed its absorption, there were no 
      significant effects of the meal on the values of Cmax and apparent t1/2 of
      MK-462.

TI  - Can oral 311C90, a novel 5-HT1D agonist, prevent migraine headache when taken
      during an aura?
PG  - 28-31
AB  - The purpose of this pilot study was to determine whether 20 mg oral 311C90 can
      prevent the development of migraine headache when taken during the aura phase of 
      a migraine attack. The study also aimed to provide an initial safety profile for 
      311C90 when taken during the aura. Forty patients (31 females, 9 males) were
      entered into this outpatient, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-period
      crossover trial. They all almost invariably experienced a migraine headache after
      the aura phase. Patients treated two migraine attacks during the aura phase in a 
      random order, one with 311C90 20 mg and the other with placebo. Efficacy
      assessments were recorded on standard diary cards completed by each patient. A
      primary response was defined as the complete absence of headache pain in the 24
      hour period following administration of the first dose of study medication.
      Safety assessments included ECGs, laboratory tests and the recording of adverse
      experiences. Twenty patients completed the study by treating 2 attacks, 16 of
      these were fully adherent to the study protocol. Three of the 16 patients
      responded to 311C90 whereas all patients developed a migraine headache after
      taking placebo. Two patients who did not respond to 311C90 described the
      developing headache as being "non-migraine'. Adverse experiences reported were
      similar to those experienced by patients in previous studies when 311C90 was
      taken during a migraine headache. There were no reports of 311C90-related adverse
      effects on the aura. These preliminary results suggest that oral 311C90 may be of
      value in preventing a migraine headache and is safe when taken during the aura
      phase. This intriguing possibility therefore warrants further investigation
      possibly utilising formulations that would deliver meaningful plasma levels of
      drug more rapidly.

TI  - The clinical effectiveness of 311C90 in the acute treatment of migraine.
PG  - 4-7
AB  - Efficacy with currently marketed antimigraine compounds is less than optimal.
      311C90 is a novel and selective 5-HT1D receptor agonist in development for the
      acute treatment of migraine. It shows evidence of both central and peripheral
      activity within the trigemino-vascular system and it is rapidly absorbed
      following oral administration. In clinical studies in migraine patients, a
      headache response at 2 hours has been observed in 65-81% of patients at doses
      above 1 mg. Favourable response rates are reported as early as 1 hour post-dose
      and efficacy rates continue to improve up to 4 hours. Headache recurrence is
      reported by 25-35% of patients and 311C90 is also effective in relieving the
      non-headache symptoms of migraine.

TI  - The clinical potential of endothelin receptor antagonists in cardiovascular
      medicine.
PG  - 12-27
AB  - The endothelin family of peptides are extremely potent endogenous vasoconstrictor
      and pressor agents. Of the 3 isoforms, endothelin-1 is the major isoform produced
      by the vascular endothelium and is, therefore, likely to be of most importance
      for regulation of vascular function. Two endothelin receptor subtypes have so far
      been cloned in mammalian species; ET A, and ET B. Both receptor subtypes are
      found on smooth muscle cells and mediate the vasoconstrictor and pressor actions 
      of endothelin. The ET B receptor is also found on vascular endothelial cells and 
      mediates endothelin-dependent vasodilatation through release of nitric oxide and 
      prostacyclin. Since their discovery in 1988, the endothelins have been the
      subject of intense research on their physiological function and potential
      pathophysiological role in cardiovascular disease. There is now good evidence
      that endothelin regulates vascular tone and blood pressure, and studies to
      support the development of endothelin receptor antagonists in conditions
      associated with chronic vasoconstriction, such as hypertension and heart failure,
      as well as in vasospastic disorders, such as subarachnoid haemorrhage and
      Raynaud's disease. There are now a number of selective ET A and combined ET A/B
      receptor antagonists available for preclinical studies. However, it is still not 
      clear which of these will prove to be of most therapeutic value. Some of these
      agents are currently being assessed in early phase clinical trials. Endothelin
      receptor antagonists represent a novel therapeutic approach to a fundamental and 
      newly discovered endogenous vasoconstrictor mechanism. The results of the current
      clinical trials are awaited with considerable interest.

TI  - Improvements in health-related quality of life with sumatriptan treatment for
      migraine.
PG  - 36-42
AB  - BACKGROUND: The debilitating effects of migraine might be reduced in patients
      using an effective migraine medication. The serotonin (5HT1) receptor agonist
      sumatriptan has been shown in clinical trials to alleviate headache and
      associated symptoms in the majority of patients treated. METHODS: Three hundred
      forty-four (344) patients with migraine were allowed to treat an unlimited number
      of migraine attacks for up to 24 months with subcutaneous sumatriptan (6 mg).
      Open-label oral sumatriptan (100 mg) could be used between 1 hour and 24 hours
      after the initial injection for treatment of recurrent or persistent headache. On
      four occasions during the treatment period, patients completed the Medical
      Outcomes Study Short Form-36 Health Survey, a general health status instrument;
      the Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire, a disease-specific
      instrument; and a series of questions designed to measure the impact of migraine 
      on productivity and disability. RESULTS: Treatment with sumatriptan was
      associated with significant (P < .05) improvements relative to baseline in three 
      of the Short Form-36 Health Survey quality-of-life dimensions (Bodily Pain,
      General Health Perceptions, and Social Functioning) and three of the
      Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire dimensions (Role
      Function-Restrictive, Role Function-Preventive, and Emotional Function).
      Significant (P < .05) improvements in patient-rated productivity and reductions
      in patient-rated disability also occurred during the trial. CONCLUSIONS: Patients
      using sumatriptan to treat migraines for up to 24 months experienced improvements
      in disability and productivity as well as in health-related quality of life as
      measured either by a general health status instrument or a disease-specific
      instrument.

TI  - Response measures in the acute treatment of migraine.
PG  - 519-22, discussion 450-1
AB  - Pain ratings from 268 migraine patients have been used to compare the visual
      analogue scale (VAS) and a four-point verbal rating scale. All patients completed
      pain ratings on both scales at the beginning of a migraine attack and 4 h after
      starting treatment with sumatriptan or placebo. The VAS scores showed large
      variability within each category on the verbal rating scale. A common way of
      analysing pain in migraine studies is to classify patient response as a success
      or failure based on the score on the four-point verbal rating scale. In this
      study, the statistical power of analysing response either as "success or failure"
      or by means of the VAS score has been investigated by stochastic simulation. The 
      simulations showed that the two response measures resulted in approximately equal
      power.

PG  - 911-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous sumatriptan with
      placebo in the treatment of menstrual migraine. METHODS: A double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, parallel group study was conducted to assess the efficacy and
      safety of subcutaneous sumatriptan in the treatment of menstrual migraine over
      two attacks. A total of 179 subjects received sumatriptan or placebo to treat at 
      least one menstrual migraine attack. RESULTS: The efficacy results were
      consistent for attacks one and two. Two hours after treatment in attacks one and 
      two, 53 (73%) and 51 (81%) of the sumatriptan-treated subjects, respectively,
      reported headache relief (reduction of a severe or moderately severe headache to 
      a mild or no headache), compared with 27 (31%) and 18 (29%) of the
      placebo-treated subjects (P < .001). Within 24 hours of treatment in attack one, 
      28 (53%) and 14 (52%) of the initial responders to sumatriptan and placebo,
      respectively, experienced headache recurrence. The incidence and nature of
      adverse events in this study were similar to that seen in previous studies.
      CONCLUSIONS: Subcutaneous sumatriptan is an effective and well-tolerated acute
      treatment for menstrual migraine.

PG  - 721-8
AB  - This italian multicentre, double blind, parallel groups study compared the
      efficacy, safety and tolerability of oral sumatriptan, given as new film-coated
      tablet, with placebo in the acute treatment of migraine. 88 Patients received
      placebo and 162 patients received sumatriptan 100 mg (plus an optional dose 2 h
      later if the headache persisted plus a further optional dose for recurrence
      within 24 h). Sumatriptan was significantly more effective than placebo at
      releiving headache at 2 h (51% versus 31%, P = 0.003) and 4 h (71% versus 35%, P 
      < 0.001). Fewer sumatriptan-treated patients required a second dose compared with
      placebo-treated patients (49% versus 74%, P < 0.001). Sumatriptan was more
      effective than placebo at relieving nausea, vomiting and photophobia/phonophobia.
      Few patients were evaluable for treatment of headache recurrence, and statistical
      analysis was not possible. More sumatriptan-treated patients than placebo-treated
      patients reported adverse events (29% versus 16%) but the difference was not
      statistically significant. More of these events were mild to moderate in
      severity, of short duration and resolved without treatment. Sumatriptan had no
      clinically significant effect on blood pressure, heart rate, electrocardiogram or
      laboratory test results. It is concluded that oral sumatriptan 100 mg, given as a
      film-coated, tablet, provides an effective and well-tolerated acute treatment for
      migraine.

TI  - Preemptive oral treatment with sumatriptan during a cluster period.
PG  - 607-13
AB  - This multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      study in 169 patients investigated the effect of a 7-day period of preemptive
      treatment with oral sumatriptan (100 mg tid) on the frequency and severity of
      cluster headache attacks occurring during an established cluster headache period.
      Safety and tolerability were also assessed. Cluster headache patients who were
      not taking prophylactic medication and had experienced seven or more attacks in
      the preceding observation week, treated a cluster headache attack at home with
      subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg using an autoinjector device. Patients were then
      randomized to take sumatriptan 100 mg or placebo at 8-hourly intervals for a
      7-day period. Cluster headaches occurring during this period could be treated 5
      minutes after onset with rescue medication (100% oxygen or simple analgesics).
      Diary cards were used to record details of the cluster headache pattern during
      the observation and study treatment weeks. Preemptive oral treatment with
      sumatriptan 100 mg tid for 7 days did not produce a significant reduction in the 
      number or severity of cluster headache attacks occurring during an established
      cluster headache period. Oral treatment with sumatriptan 100 mg tid over a 7-day 
      period was not associated with an increased or altered adverse event profile from
      that previously reported.

PG  - 601-6
AB  - An open, multicenter study investigated the long-term efficacy, tolerability, and
      acceptability to patients of subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg, administered using a 
      novel cartridge system self-injector, for the acute treatment of migraine. Eighty
      patients treated all migraine attacks for 6 months at home with a subcutaneous
      injection of sumatriptan 6 mg. A second injection could be taken after 1 to 24
      hours if relief was inadequate, or if the headache recurred, and rescue
      medication could be taken 1 hour after the second injection. The primary end
      point was the percentage of attacks in which headache improved from severe or
      moderate before treatment to mild or absent at 1 hour after the first injection. 
      A total of 1566 attacks were treated by the 80 patients and 69 patients completed
      6 months of treatment. Headache relief was reported 1 hour after the first
      injection in a mean of 78% of attacks (83% in the first 3 months and 76% in the
      second 3 months). A second injection was required in a mean of 40% of attacks,
      and headache was mild or absent 1 hour after the second injection in a mean of
      77% of attacks. Rescue medication was required after the second injection in a
      mean of 14% of attacks. At the end of the study, 87% of patients said that they
      would take the medication again, and at each clinic visit over 80% said that they
      found the injector easy to use. Adverse events were similar to those reported
      previously with sumatriptan and were mostly mild to moderate in intensity,
      short-lived, and resolved spontaneously. Subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg is an
      effective, well tolerated, and well accepted, long-term, acute treatment for
      migraine when self-injected by patients using the novel self-injector.

PG  - 923-6
AB  - Aspirin is commonly used to treat migraine attacks, although sumatriptan, a much 
      more expensive treatment, is also effective. We compared a combination of lysine 
      acetylsalicylate (equivalent to 900 mg aspirin) and 10 mg metoclopramide
      (LAS+MTC) with oral sumatriptan (100 mg) and placebo in 421 patients with
      migraine. LAS+MTC was as effective as sumatriptan with a decrease of headache
      from severe or moderate to mild or none of 57% and 53%, respectively, for the
      first migraine attack treated. Both treatments were better than placebo (success 
      rate 24%, p < 0.0001). LAS+MTC was significantly more effective in the treatment 
      of nausea than sumatriptan (p < 0.0001) and was better tolerated (adverse events 
      in 18% and 28%, respectively, p < 0.05). LAS+MTC is as effective as sumatriptan
      in the treatment of migraine attacks. It is also much cheaper.

TI  - Treatment of cluster headache: clinical trials, design and results.
PG  - 33-6
AB  - The spontaneous capricious course of cluster headache may give rise to some
      problems when treatment is being evaluated. This is one of several explanations
      for there being so few well-designed, randomized, double-blind clinical trials in
      cluster headache. The standard treatment of acute attacks of cluster headache is 
      inhalation of 100% oxygen. In the prophylaxis of episodic cluster headache,
      ergotamine, verapamil, lithium, serotonin, inhibitors and steroids are used. In
      chronic cluster, lithium is the drug of choice, but verapamil may also be tried. 
      Recently, hyperbaric oxygen has been shown to immediately abort acute attacks,
      and it seems that it may also be useful in the prophylactic treatment. The
      introduction of the novel 5HT1 agonist sumatriptan as a symptomatic relief of
      cluster attacks represents further significant progress. Two randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trials have shown sumatriptan 6 mg
      sc to be a rapid, effective and well-tolerated acute treatment for cluster
      headache attacks. Within 15 min of treatment, 74% of attacks on sumatriptan
      responded compared to 26% of placebo-treated attacks. Functional disability was
      also significantly improved. Increasing the dose to 12 mg did not offer
      significantly greater relief compared to sumatriptan 6 mg, but was associated
      with an increased incidence of adverse events. Interim analysis of 3 months of
      data from a recent multinational open trial comprising, 138 patients having
      treated 6353 attacks with subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg revealed a headache
      relief in 96% of attacks treated. There was no evidence of an increased incidence
      of adverse events with frequent use of sumatriptan. No tachyphylaxis was seen
      over the 3 months, suggesting that sumatriptan is effective and well tolerated
      also in long-term acute treatment for cluster headache.

TI  - How does sumatriptan perform in clinical practice?
PG  - 21-8
AB  - The patient's opinion on sumatriptan treatment has been obtained from 351
      migraineurs (299F and 52M) by means of a telephone survey. The results are based 
      on the patient's cumulative experience of more than 20,000 subcutaneous
      injections and more than 2,000 tablet doses. The average period during which
      subcutaneous sumatriptan (12 mg/ml, 0.5 ml) was used was 19.1 +/- 0.4 months and 
      84% of the patients had used more than 10 injections. The average number of
      migraine attacks per month was 3.0 +/- 0.1, injections per attack 1.7 +/- 0.1,
      and number of tablets (100 mg) per attack 1.8 +/- 0.2. Attack duration was
      decreased from on average 38.4 +/- 2.1 h to 2.3 +/- 0.5 h by subcutaneous
      sumatriptan and to 3.4 +/- 1.0 by orally administered sumatriptan. The average
      degree of efficiency at work with migraine was 76.3 +/- 1.9% on sumatriptan
      compared with 26.6% on other treatment options; 85% said that sumatriptan was
      much better than previous conventional therapies tested. During their experience 
      with sumatriptan, 89% of the migraineurs reported altogether 1,058 adverse events
      (average 3.6 +/- 01, range 1 to 12) in connection with subcutaneous sumatriptan
      treatment. The three most frequent were drowsiness/sedation (49%), chest symptoms
      (40%) and injection site symptoms (37%). Among the table users, 87% reported
      altogether 122 adverse events (average 2.6 +/- 0.3, range 1 to 11). Seventy-eight
      percent of the responders responded to subcutaneous sumatriptan sometimes (22%
      always, 15% every second attack, 40% seldom) experienced a recurrence of their
      headache within 24 h. The average number of recurrences was 1.7 +/- 0.1 and the
      average time to recurrence 13.0 +/- 0.6 h (range 1.5-24 h). It is concluded that 
      the selected group of migraineurs found sumatriptan to be very effective in
      reducing the symptoms of their migraine attacks, but also to cause several
      adverse events, in many cases, with short-lasting effect.

TI  - Analgesics and NSAIDs in the treatment of the acute migraine attack.
PG  - 14-20
AB  - In the treatment of migraine attacks, an antiemetic in combination with an
      analgesic or ergot alkaloid is widely recommended. Medication should be
      introduced as early as possible, but only when there is no doubt that the
      headache is due to migraine. The antiemetic provides relief from the nausea and
      vomiting and also enhances the resorption of analgesics or ergot preparations.
      Domperidone 20 mg orally and 20 mg metoclopramide as suppository or 10-20 mg
      orally are mostly used as antiemetics. Analgesics such as 1000 mg acetylsalicylic
      acid as effervescent tablets, or 1000 mg paracetamol as effervescent tablets or
      suppositories should be given 15-20 min later. If this treatment fails, NSAIDs
      can be tried. In some studies naproxen in doses between 500 and 1000 mg and
      ibuprofen in doses between 400 and 800 mg have been shown to be effective, as
      well as NSAIDs like diclofenac, mefenamic acid, ketoprofen, tolfenamic acid and
      pirprofen. NSAIDs have been found to be superior to placebo and to standard
      reference drugs in the majority of the reviewed double-blind trials.
      Nevertheless, these effects are marginal in some studies or even without clinical
      relevance. Accordingly, there is still a need for further comparative studies.

PG  - 423-9
AB  - A novel self-injector for the administration of subcutaneous sumatriptan in the
      treatment of migraine attacks was tested in 138 patients recruited by family
      physicians in Denmark: 108 patients completed the initial double-blind, crossover
      part of the study. Sumatriptan 6 mg s.c. was significantly better than placebo at
      30, 60, 90 and 120 min after injection in relieving moderate or severe headache
      to mild or none as well as relieving any headache to none. At 60 min after
      injection, the treatment response rate was 61% for sumatriptan and 6% for
      placebo. During the following open-phase trial of four attacks treated with
      sumatriptan, treatment response rates were 68-74%. During the total of 538
      attacks treated, 12 attempts at using the self-injector failed. In the
      double-blind and open phases, 81% and 90% of patients respectively found the
      device easy or very easy to use. Adverse effects were benign and short-lasting,
      but led seven patients to discontinue the study. In conclusion, subcutaneous
      sumatriptan administered with a novel self-injector is an effective treatment for
      migraine compared to placebo in patients treated by their family physician.

PG  - 414-22; discussion 336
AB  - Health-related quality of life (HQL) assessment in the clinical setting have
      distinguished subjective perceptions (e.g., well-being), signs/symptoms of the
      disease and functional capacity as three major components. The impact of
      short-term treatment for migraine attacks on these variables was evaluated in an 
      open prospective 6-month study at the Gothenburg Migraine Clinic. Socio-economic 
      factors, subjective symptoms, and general well-being/quality of life were
      evaluated by self-administered questionnaires in 99 patients with migraine with
      or without aura in accordance with the classification of the International
      Headache Society. Short-term treatment comprising conventional therapy or
      subcutaneous sumatriptan reduced number of days per month with migraine and
      absenteeism from work, migraine-associated symptoms, but did not significantly
      improve general well-being between attacks. Future assessment of the patients'
      HQL in accordance with this approach would enable us to consider all the
      advantages and disadvantages of current therapies of particular interest in the
      field of migraine.

TI  - Migraine and cluster headache--their management with sumatriptan: a critical
      review of the current clinical experience.
PG  - 337-57
AB  - Sumatriptan is a potent and selective agonist at the vascular 5HT1 receptor which
      mediates constriction of certain large cranial blood vessels and/or inhibits the 
      release of vasoactive neuropeptides from perivascular trigeminal axons in the
      dura mater following activation of the trigeminovascular system. The mode of
      action of this drug in migraine and cluster headache is discussed. On the basis
      of a detailed review of all published trials and available data from
      post-marketing studies, the efficacy, safety, tolerability and the place of oral 
      and subcutaneous sumatriptan in the treatment of both conditions are assessed. A 
      number of double-blind clinical trials have demonstrated that sumatriptan 100 mg 
      administered orally is clearly superior to placebo in the acute treatment of
      migraine headache and achieves significantly greater response rates than
      ergotamine or aspirin. In other studies, 70 to 80% of patients receiving
      sumatriptan 6 mg sc experienced relief of migraine headaches by 1 or 2 h after
      administration, and patients consistently required less rescue medication for
      unresolved symptoms. Sumatriptan was also effective in relieving associated
      migraine symptoms like nausea and vomiting. Sumatriptan was equally effective
      regardless of migraine type or duration of migraine symptoms. Overall,
      approximately 40% of patients who initially responded to oral or subcutaneous
      sumatriptan experienced recurrence of their headache usually within 24 h,
      effectively treated by a further dose of this drug. In 75% of patients with
      cluster headache treated with sumatriptan 6 mg sc, relief was achieved within 15 
      min. Based on pooled study data, sumatriptan is generally well tolerated and most
      adverse events are transient. Adverse events following oral administration
      include nausea, vomiting, malaise, fatigue and dizziness. With the subcutaneous
      injection, injection site reactions occur in approximately 30%. Chest syumptoms
      are reported in 3 to 5% but have been associated with myocardial ischaemia only
      in rare isolated cases. The recommended dosage of sumatriptan at the onset of
      migraine symptoms is 100 mg orally or 6 mg subcutaneously. The recommended dosage
      for cluster headache is 6 mg sumatriptan sc. Sumatriptan must not be given
      together with vasoconstrictive substances, e.g., ergotamines, or with migraine
      prophylactics with similar properties, e.g., methysergide. Sumatriptan should not
      be given during the migraine aura. It is contraindicated in patients with
      ischaemic heart disease, previous myocardial infarction, Prinzmetal (variant)
      angina and uncontrolled hypertension.

TI  - Is myofascial pain of the temporal muscles relieved by oral sumatriptan? A
      cross-over pilot study.
PG  - 241-4
AB  - There is evidence that serotonin may be implicated in the pathophysiology of
      myofascial pain (MFP). Because of this, we used oral sumatriptan (Imitrex,
      Glaxo), a peripherally acting agonist of 5-HT1D receptors, in a double-blind,
      randomized, placebo-controlled double crossover pilot study of 7 patients with
      episodic MFP of the temporalis muscles. The results showed that there was a
      significant reduction in pain intensity and increase in pain relief over time
      with both the active medication and the placebo, but no significant difference
      between treatments. All but 1 patient reported that they are not interested in
      retaking the same medication. These data suggest that oral sumatriptan may not be
      the drug of choice in the control of episodic MFP.

TI  - Oral sumatriptan in preventing headache recurrence after treatment of migraine
      attacks with subcutaneous sumatriptan.
PG  - 1505-9
AB  - Headache recurrence (HR) may occur within 24 hours in approximately 40% of
      migraine attacks initially treated successfully with 6 mg subcutaneous (SC)
      sumatriptan. This may be due to the short plasma half-life of sumatriptan. We
      studied whether an additional dose of 100 mg oral sumatriptan 4 hours after
      treatment of a migraine attack with 6 mg SC sumatriptan could prevent HR.
      Patients (n = 667) treated up to three migraine attacks in a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter clinical trial. For
      each attack, they initially took open-label 6 mg SC sumatriptan by autoinjector. 
      Four hours later all patients took either 100 mg oral sumatriptan or matched
      placebo. Patients could take an additional optional oral dose of 100 mg
      sumatriptan to treat HR. The primary efficacy end point was the number of
      successfully treated patients without HR within 24 hours after the initial SC
      injection for the first study attack. Two hundred twenty-five patients were not
      assessable for HR, mainly because of protocol violations. Of 442 assessable
      patients, 82/212 in the sumatriptan-treated group (39%) and 89/230 in the
      placebo-treated group (39%) reported HR in attack 1. Median times to recurrence
      were 15.6 hours after sumatriptan and 10.3 hours after placebo (p = 0.006). One
      hundred mg oral sumatriptan taken 4 hours after 6 mg SC sumatriptan does not
      prevent HR but significantly delays time to recurrence.

TI  - Patient preferences for migraine therapy: subcutaneous sumatriptan compared with 
      other medications.
PG  - 147-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to identify, from the patient's perspective,
      the important attributes of a migraine therapy and to assess the performance of
      subcutaneous sumatriptan, aspirin, acetaminophen, and patients' usual therapies
      with respect to these attributes. METHODS: Six hundred forty-eight patients who
      had received subcutaneous sumatriptan (one or two doses, 6 mg per dose, for a
      single migraine episode) or placebo in a clinical trial completed questionnaires.
      RESULTS: According to patients, the four most important attributes of a migraine 
      therapy are "how well it works," "how safe it is," "how fast it works," and "side
      effects." The least important attribute is "cost of drug." Subcutaneous
      sumatriptan received significantly more favorable scores than did aspirin,
      acetaminophen, or patients' usual therapies with respect to the attributes of how
      well it works, how fast it works, and number of doses needed to relieve pain.
      Subcutaneous sumatriptan was also rated more favorably than either aspirin or
      patients' usual therapies with respect to side effects. Acetaminophen and aspirin
      were rated significantly more favorably than subcutaneous sumatriptan on the
      attributes "easy to take" and "easy to buy." Asked which drug they would use
      again for migraine, more patients selected subcutaneous sumatriptan than any
      other single medication. More patients also ranked subcutaneous sumatriptan as
      the best overall performer compared with other migraine medications taken in the 
      last 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that according to patients'
      preferences, subcutaneous sumatriptan possesses many of the attributes of an
      ideal migraine therapy.

PG  - 479-82
AB  - An open prospective study of the efficacy and tolerability of oral sumatriptan in
      the treatment of acute migraine attacks at the Kenyatta National Hospital,
      Nairobi, Kenya, is presented. Thirty two patients were initially recruited and 24
      completed the trial giving a drop-out rate of 25%. The age range was 17 to 55
      years with a mean of 35 years. Sumatriptan was found to be effective in 22 (92%) 
      out of 24 patients. Side effects occurred in 38% (9/24) patients. These were mild
      and transient and included nausea, vomiting, numbness of limbs, fever and a
      feeling of heat in the head. It is concluded that oral sumatriptan is an
      effective drug in the treatment of acute migraine headaches. It has few side
      effects and is well tolerated by majority of patients.

PG  - 1475-9
AB  - In primates, histamine activates cerebral endothelial H1-receptors leading to
      formation of nitric oxide (NO). Twenty migraine patients received pretreatment
      with placebo or the histamine-H1-receptor antagonist, mepyramine, in a
      randomized, double blind fashion, followed in both groups by i.v. histamine (0.5 
      microgram kg-1 min-1 for 20 min). Headache characteristics were subsequently
      observed for 12 h. In patients given placebo histamine caused immediate headache 
      during the infusion followed by a delayed migraine attack fulfilling IHS criteria
      for migraine without aura. The temporal profile of induced headache was exactly
      the same as after glyceryl trinitrate. Mepyramine pretreatment abolished both
      immediate headache and delayed migraine attacks. Our results suggest that a
      migraine attack can be caused by NO formation in the endothelium of cerebral
      arteries.

TI  - Brain stem activation in spontaneous human migraine attacks.
PG  - 658-60
AB  - Evidence from animal experiments shows that the brain stem is involved in the
      pathophysiology of migraine. To investigate human migraine, we used positron
      emission tomography to examine the changes in regional cerebral blood flow as an 
      index of neuronal activity in the human brain during spontaneous migraine
      attacks. During the attacks, increased blood flow was found in the cerebral
      hemispheres in cingulate, auditory and visual association cortices and in the
      brain stem. However, only the brain stem activation persisted after the injection
      of sumatriptan had induced complete relief from headache and phono- and
      photophobia. These findings support the idea that the pathogenesis of migraine is
      related to an imbalance in activity between brain stem nuclei regulating
      antinociception and vascular control.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Serotoninergic receptors are involved in the regulation of PRL and GH 
      secretion. We studied the effects of sumatriptan, a new 5-HT1D receptor agonist, 
      on PRL and GH secretion in active acromegaly. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: After their
      informed consent, all subjects were submitted to sumatriptan or placebo
      administration in single blind and in a random order. The time interval between
      the tests was of 7 days. ENVIRONMENT: We examined all patients in the morning,
      after 12 hours of fasting. All subjects were in recumbent position during the
      tests. Pulse rate and blood pressure were monitored during the test. SUBJECTS:
      Eight acromegalics (42-65 years) and 10 age-matched (33-63 years) normal
      subjects. PROTOCOL: Blood samples were taken after needle insertion kept patent
      by slow saline solution infusion. PRL and GH secretion were evaluated after
      sumatriptan (6 mg sc) and placebo. Blood samples were taken before (45, 15 and 0 
      minutes) and every 15 minutes for 2 hours after sumatriptan or placebo
      administration. RESULTS: No significant changes in PRL secretion were observed
      after sumatriptan in both groups of subjects. A significant increase in GH levels
      after sumatriptan was observed in controls but not in acromegalics. An
      age-related negative trend in GH response to sumatriptan was observed in
      controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that 5-HT1D receptors are not involved
      in PRL and GH secretion in middle-aged acromegalics.

TI  - Validation of a new quality of life questionnaire for acute migraine headache.
PG  - 330-7
AB  - A brief migraine-specific quality of life questionnaire was developed to assess
      the quality of life decrement associated with an acute migraine attack in the
      24-hour period following headache onset. The migraine quality of life
      questionnaire has 15 questions across five domains (work functioning, social
      functioning, energy, concerns, and symptoms). A prospective, observational study 
      was conducted to evaluate the characteristics of internal consistency, construct 
      and discriminant validity, and responsiveness of the migraine quality of life
      questionnaire. One hundred thirty-eight subjects with migraine were recruited.
      One hundred seven subjects completed a baseline and a 24-hour postmigraine
      quality of life questionnaire, along with a migraine diary for recording headache
      severity, activity limitation, associated symptoms, duration of headache, and use
      of migraine medication. All five migraine quality of life questionnaire domains
      showed good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha, 0.74-0.95). The strongest
      correlations were seen between activity limitation and associated symptoms and
      the migraine quality of life questionnaire work, social, and energy domains.
      Significant differences in mean questionnaire scores between subjects were found 
      with frequency of medication use, global change in symptoms, headache duration,
      and severity. All five domains showed significant responses within subjects from 
      a migraine-free period to an acute migraine period (P < 0.0001). In summary, the 
      migraine quality of life questionnaire showed good internal consistency,
      construct and discriminant validity, and responsiveness to acute migraine
      attacks.

PG  - 230-6
AB  - In the first three months of a 24-month open study to assess the safety and
      efficacy of subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg in the long-term acute treatment of
      cluster headache, 138 patients treated a maximum of two attacks daily each with a
      single 6 mg injection. A total of 6353 attacks were treated. Adverse events,
      reported in 28% of sumatriptan-treated attacks, were qualitatively similar to
      those seen in migraine long-term trials. Their incidence did not increase with
      frequent use of sumatriptan. There were no clinically significant treatment
      effects on vital signs, ECG recordings or laboratory parameters. Headache relief 
      (a reduction from very severe, severe or moderate pain to mild or no pain) at 15 
      min was obtained for a median of 96% of attacks treated. There was no indication 
      of tachyphylaxis, decrease in the speed of response, or increased frequency of
      attacks with long-term treatment. This study demonstrated that, in long-term use,
      subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg is a well-tolerated and effective acute treatment
      for cluster headache.

PG  - 2320-3
AB  - Two hundred and thirty migraineurs diagnosed by their general practitioners in
      accordance with their usual practice were included. The patients treated two
      migraine attacks at home by subcutaneous injection of sumatriptan or placebo and 
      the alternative medication for the second attack (cross-over). When sumatriptan
      was compared to placebo, significantly more of the 209 evaluable patients
      reported headache relief at one hour (56% v 8%, p < 0.001) and two hours (62% v
      15%, p < 0.001) after the first injection. Resolution of nausea, photophobia and 
      phonophobia was significantly more common in patients on sumatriptan than on
      placebo (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). The adverse events were usually
      transient and of mild or moderate severity, although, three patients withdrew due
      to adverse events. Ninety-five percent of patients evaluated by a neurological
      research fellow met the International Headache Society's criteria for migraine.
      In general practice, sumatriptan taken subcutaneously using an autoinjector at
      home was an effective and well tolerated acute treatment for migraine.

PG  - 464-9
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of SC sumatriptan injection versus
      placebo in the treatment of acute migraine in ED patients and that of open-label 
      100 mg sumatriptan PO tablets for recurrent migraine. DESIGN: Randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial. SETTING: Twelve EDs in the 
      United States. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients presenting to the ED from September
      1992 through April 1993 with a diagnosis of migraine as determined by
      International Headache Society criteria. Patients were randomized to receive 6 mg
      sumatriptan SC or placebo. Patients were monitored for improvement in headache
      severity using a four-point scale and for time to meaningful relief using a
      stopwatch. The time to discharge from the ED was recorded. An open-label 100 mg
      sumatriptan PO tablet was given to all patients on discharge from the ED for use 
      at home if the headache recurred within 24 hours. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-six
      patients were enrolled. Seventy-five percent of patients treated with sumatriptan
      achieved meaningful relief compared with 35% treated with placebo (P < .001). The
      median time to meaningful relief was 34 minutes in the group that received
      sumatriptan. Seventy percent of patients in the sumatriptan group versus 35% in
      the placebo group reported mild or no pain at discharge (P < .001).
      Migraine-associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were
      significantly reduced in the sumatriptan group (P < .005). The median time to
      discharge from the ED was shorter for the sumatriptan group than for the placebo 
      group (60 versus 96 minutes, respectively; P = .001). At baseline, 15% of
      patients in the sumatriptan group and 19% of patients in the placebo group
      reported mild or no clinical disability. At the time of discharge, patients with 
      mild or no disability increased to 75% in the sumatriptan group compared with 44%
      in the placebo group (P = .001). Fifty-seven of 92 patients (62%) with mild or no
      pain at discharge took open-label oral sumatriptan for headache recurrence, and
      37 (65%) experienced meaningful relief within 2 hours. Median time to meaningful 
      relief after oral sumatriptan was 65 minutes. CONCLUSION: Sumatriptan (6 mg SC)
      is effective in treating acute migraine in the ED. Oral sumatriptan (100 mg) is
      effective in treating headache recurrence within 24 hours.

TI  - Lack of pharmacokinetic interaction between butorphanol tartrate nasal spray and 
      sumatriptan succinate.
PG  - 432-7
AB  - The pharmacokinetics of butorphanol tartrate given in a nasal spray with and
      without the co-administration of sumatriptan succinate were studied in 24 healthy
      men and women. In this crossover design study, all subjects received 2
      treatments: a single 1-mg dose of butorphanol nasal spray and a 1-mg dose of
      butorphanol nasal spray plus a single 6-mg subcutaneous (SC) dose of sumatriptan.
      There was a two-week washout period between sessions. Serial blood samples were
      collected and plasma samples analyzed using validated radioimmunoassay and
      high-performance liquid chromatography/electrochemical procedures to determine
      the concentrations of unchanged butorphanol and sumatriptan, respectively. There 
      were no statistically significant differences for butorphanol between the 2
      treatments on any of the following pharmacokinetic parameters: Cmax, tmax, AUC,
      t1/2, CL/f, and Vz/f. Similarly, the pharmacokinetic parameters obtained for
      sumatriptan (given with butorphanol nasal spray) were comparable with the
      literature values obtained for a single 6-mg SC dose of sumatriptan. These data
      show a lack of pharmacokinetic interaction between butorphanol nasal spray and
      sumatriptan. Butorphanol nasal spray and sumatriptan were well tolerated. The
      adverse experience profiles of butorphanol nasal spray were comparable between
      the treatments, with and without sumatriptan. It can be concluded that regimens
      of butorphanol nasal spray and sumatriptan need not be changed for either
      pharmacokinetic or safety considerations when the two compounds are
      co-administered in treating acute migraine attacks.

TI  - The effects of oral sumatriptan, a 5-HT1 receptor agonist, on circulating ACTH
      and cortisol concentrations in man.
PG  - 389-95
AB  - 1. The effects of oral sumatriptan (50, 100 and 200 mg), a 5-HT1 receptor
      agonist, and placebo, on circulating adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and
      cortisol concentrations were determined over 24 h after dosing, in 26 healthy
      male subjects. ACTH was measured by immunoradiometric assay and cortisol by
      radioimmunoassay. 2. After sumatriptan all subjects displayed a normal diurnal
      rhythm for circulating ACTH and cortisol compared with placebo. 3. There was a
      reduction in the trough circulating ACTH concentration over 0-4 h which was 18%
      with 100 mg (P = 0.002), and 25% with 200 mg (P < 0.001). The 5 h, post-prandial,
      peak ACTH concentration was reduced by 21% with 100 mg (P = 0.018) and by 20%
      with 200 mg (P = 0.024). The weighted mean ACTH over 24 h was reduced by 8% with 
      100 mg (P = 0.029) and by 8% with 200 mg (P = 0.018). The nadir concentration of 
      ACTH over the 24 h and the ACTH concentration 24 h after sumatriptan were not,
      however, significantly reduced. All results are compared with placebo. 4. There
      was a reduction in the trough circulating cortisol concentration over 0-4 h which
      was 15% with 50 mg (P = 0.015), 14% with 100 mg (P = 0.022) and 24% with 200 mg
      (P < 0.001). The 5 h, post-prandial, peak cortisol concentration was reduced by
      16% with 100 mg (P = 0.012) and by 15% with 200 mg (P = 0.017).(ABSTRACT

TI  - SUNCT syndrome: trials of drugs and anesthetic blockades.
PG  - 138-42
AB  - Nine patients with the SUNCT syndrome (Spanish and Norwegian patients) have, over
      many years, been given several drugs effective in the cluster headache syndrome, 
      trigeminal neuralgia, and other headaches, as well as drugs not previously used
      in headache. Various cranial nerves were also anesthetized in an endeavor to
      ameliorate the suffering of those patients. Although a partial effect was
      obtained with carbamazepine and corticosteroids in some patients, none of the
      drugs or anesthetic blockades had consistent, lasting, complete effect on
      headache paroxysms in SUNCT. The essentially negative outcome of this study aids 
      in further characterizing SUNCT as a separate disorder, and, above all, in
      distinguishing it from trigeminal neuralgia and the cluster headache syndrome.

TI  - High efficacy and low frequency of headache recurrence after oral sumatriptan.
      The Oral Sumatriptan Italian Study Group.
PG  - 96-105
AB  - This multicentre, double-blind study compared (100 mg) sumatriptan administered
      orally with placebo in treating an acute attack of migraine; 238 patients were
      studied over a 48-h period. Four hours after treatment, 92 of the 142 evaluable
      sumatriptan patients (65%) showed significant reductions (P < 0.001) in headache 
      severity, clinical disability and accompanying symptoms compared with 32 of the
      80 evaluable placebo-treated patients (40%). The duration of attack prior to
      taking medication and the history of persistent migraine do not influence the
      observed difference between the two treatment regimens (sumatriptan and placebo),
      which remained statistically significant (P < 0.001) in both cases. The incidence
      of headache recurrence in patients who experienced relief 4 h after initial
      treatment was low, occurring in 16 (17%) and 4 (13%) of the sumatriptan- and
      placebo-treated patients, respectively. Only patients with a history of migraine 
      attacks lasting longer than 24 h suffered headache recurrences, and these
      recurrences were not consistent with the International Headache Society
      definition of migraine. Treatment with sumatriptan was well tolerated.

TI  - Cerebral blood flow during migraine attacks without aura and effect of
      sumatriptan.
PG  - 135-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) during migraine attacks
      without aura and after treatment with sumatriptan. DESIGN AND INTERVENTION: We
      performed three technetium Tc99m hexemethyl-propyleneamineoxime single photon
      emission computed tomography scanning procedures in patients with migraine who
      participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial (1)
      outside an attack, (2) during an attack, and (3) after treatment of the attack
      with 6 mg of subcutaneous sumatriptan. SETTING: University hospital. PATIENTS: We
      studied 20 patients with migraine without aura, 15 of whom were evaluated under
      all three conditions and five of whom were evaluated under only two conditions.
      OUTCOME MEASURES: The single photon emission computed tomographic images were
      evaluated semiquantitatively with regard to (1) the degree of asymmetry of the
      rCBF between the headache side and the nonheadache side and (2) the ratio of the 
      rCBF in regions of interest to the rCBF in two reference areas (cerebellum or
      frontal cortex). RESULTS: We found no significant rCBF asymmetries outside or
      during the attack or after treatment with sumatriptan, and there were no
      significant changes of the rCBF ratios during the attack (compared with outside
      the attack) or after treatment of the attack (compared with during the attack).
      CONCLUSION: Migraine attacks without aura and treatment of the attacks with 6 mg 
      of subcutaneous sumatriptan are not associated with detectable focal changes of
      the rCBF.

TI  - Intranasal lidocaine for cluster headache.
PG  - 83-4
AB  - Thirty male patients with cluster headache were given 4% lidocaine solution to
      use intranasally as an abortive therapy. Four sprays of lidocaine were used
      ipsilateral to the pain, and two more were used, if necessary. Twenty-seven
      percent of the men reported moderate relief, 27% obtained mild relief, and 46%
      stated that they had no relief from the lidocaine, Side effects were minimal. In 
      this study, intranasal lidocaine was only a marginally helpful therapy for
      cluster headache. However, because of the ease of administration and lack of side
      effects, lidocaine may remain worthwhile as an adjunctive medication.

TI  - Increase in plasma calcitonin gene-related peptide from the extracerebral
      circulation during nitroglycerin-induced cluster headache attack.
PG  - 119-23
AB  - In this study, changes in plasma levels of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)
      and substance P (SP) during a spontaneous-like cluster headache attack provoked
      by nitroglycerin were evaluated. Peptide variations after spontaneous or
      sumatriptan-induced remission were also assessed. Blood was collected from the
      external jugular vein homolateral to the pain side of 30 male cluster headache
      patients; 18 men were in an active and 12 in a remission one. Plasma levels of
      CGRP and SP were determined using sensitive radioimmunoassays for each peptide.
      CGRP-like immunoreactivity (CGRP-LI) was found to be augmented in patients in an 
      active period and became elevated further at the peak of the provoked attack. A
      complete reversal occurred both after spontaneous and sumatriptan-induced
      remission. On the contrary, nitroglycerin neither provoked a cluster headache
      attack nor altered CGRP-LI in the patients in a remission period. The augmented
      levels of CGRP-LI measured before and after nitroglycerin administration, when
      the provoked attack reached the maximum intensity, suggest an activation of the
      trigeminovascular system during the active period of cluster headache. Moreover, 
      the clinical and biochemical actions showed by sumatriptan stress the involvement
      of serotonin in cluster headache mechanisms.

PG  - 195-200
AB  - The present study was undertaken in order to assess the influence of aging on the
      serotonergic control of GH secretion in humans. For this purpose, 6 mg
      5-HT1D-serotonergic receptor agonist sumatriptan (or placebo during control
      tests) was injected subcutaneously in a group of 9 young (26-40 yr old) and a
      group of 9 elderly male subjects (64-80 yr old). Sumatriptan-induced plasma GH
      rise was recorded during the next 2 hours. Plasma ACTH levels were also measured.
      The administration of the placebo was without effects in all subjects.
      Sumatriptan induced a striking increase in plasma GH levels in the younger group,
      whereas it slightly increased GH secretion in the older group (f = 9.59, p <
      0.02). Plasma ACTH levels showed a similar physiological decline in all subjects 
      during tests, regardless of sumatriptan treatment. These data show impaired
      serotonergic stimulatory regulation of GH secretion in elderly subjects.

TI  - Comparison of subcutaneous sumatriptan with usual acute treatments for migraine. 
      French Sumatriptan Study Group.
PG  - 264-9
AB  - 246 migraine patients (International Headache Society definition, 1-6 severe
      attacks per month) were randomised into a multicentre, cross-over study comparing
      subcutaneous (s.c.) sumatriptan 6 mg administered by an auto-injector (Glaxo
      device) with usual acute migraine treatments. Patients were treated for 2 months 
      or up to 12 attacks, and then crossed over to the alternative treatment for the
      same duration. Usual treatments were: analgesics (including combinations), 49%;
      ergotamine, 24%; NSAIDs 19%; DHE, 7%. Rescue medication was allowed 2 h after the
      first dose. Headache was assessed on a 4-point self-rating scale (0: none, 1:
      mild, 2: moderate, 3: severe). Other migraine symptoms were assessed as present
      or absent. Quality of life was assessed before the study and at the end of each
      treatment period. Two hundred and seventeen patients were eligible for the
      cross-over analysis. At 2 h post-dosing, an average of 78% of attacks per patient
      were successfully relieved (grade 3 or 2 to 1 or 0) by s.c. sumatriptan, compared
      with 34% for the usual treatments (p < 0.001) and 63% of attacks per patient were
      completely relieved (grade 0) by s.c. sumatriptan compared with 15% for the usual
      treatments (p < 0.001). Sumatriptan-treated patients used rescue medication for
      19% of their attacks, compared to 59% for comparator drugs (p = 0.001). Results
      for patient preference were: s.c. sumatriptan, 85%; usual treatments, 10%; no
      preference, 5% (p < 0.001). Sumatriptan was significantly superior to comparator 
      drugs for all other efficacy end-points (p < 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

TI  - Single dose pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 543-8
AB  - Sumatriptan is classified as a vascular 5HT1 receptor agonist and is effective in
      the acute treatment of migraine and cluster headache. Sumatriptan is available as
      an injection for subcutaneous administration and as a tablet for oral
      administration. The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan differ depending on the route
      of administration. The mean subcutaneous bioavailability is 96% compared to 14%
      for the oral tablet. The lower bioavailability following oral administration is
      due mainly to presystemic metabolism. The inter-subject variability in plasma
      sumatriptan concentrations is greater following oral administration and a faster 
      rate of absorption of drug into the systemic circulation is achieved following
      subcutaneous dosing. The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan are linear up to a
      subcutaneous dose of 16 mg. Following oral dosing up to 400 mg, the
      pharmacokinetics are also linear, with the exception of rate of absorption, as
      indicated by a dose dependent increase in time to peak concentration. Sumatriptan
      is a highly cleared compound that is eliminated from the body primarily by
      metabolism to the pharmacologically inactive indoleacetic acid analogue. Both
      sumatriptan and its metabolite are excreted in the urine. Although the renal
      clearance of sumatriptan is only 20% of the total clearance, it exceeds the
      glomerular filtration rate, indicating that sumatriptan undergoes active renal
      tubular secretion. Sumatriptan has a large apparent volume of distribution (170
      l) and an elimination half-life of 2 h. Oral doses of sumatriptan were
      administered as a solution of dispersible tablets and subcutaneous dosing was by 
      injection into the arm. In clinical practice, sumatriptan is administered as a
      film coated tablet or by subcutaneous injection into the thigh.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic considerations in gastrointestinal motor disorders.
PG  - 41-66
AB  - Although it has been recognised that alterations in gastrointestinal motility,
      whether induced by physiological or pathological processes, have significant
      effects on the pharmacokinetics of orally administered drugs, this subject has
      received inappropriately little attention. Studies relating to this topic have
      focused on healthy volunteers and animals and have largely been confined to the
      effects of single drug doses. There is limited information about the effects of
      disease on pharmacokinetics under steady-state conditions. Changes in
      gastrointestinal motility may affect the pharmacokinetics of orally administered 
      drugs by altering the rate of delivery, bioavailability or mucosal absorption of 
      the drug. In general the rate of absorption and time taken to achieve maximal
      plasma concentrations for well absorbed drugs may be modified by changes in
      gastrointestinal motility, but overall bioavailability is not usually affected.
      In these cases the therapeutic and clinical effects of the alteration in
      pharmacokinetics will, therefore, depend on which parameters are important for
      the action of the drug. For poorly absorbed drugs both the rate of absorption and
      bioavailability are likely to be altered by changes in gastrointestinal motility.
      However, the complex effects of food and disease, as well as the properties and
      formulation of any drug (solubility, ease of dispersion, delayed release
      formulation) often make the prediction of the magnitude, or even the direction,
      of any effect difficult to predict. Drugs with direct effects on gastrointestinal
      motility may influence their own patterns of absorption. In patients with
      gastrointestinal motility disorders, drugs administered in a controlled release
      formulation, or those with poor bioavailability, are most likely to have a poorly
      predictable therapeutic effect. Care should be taken to ensure that the
      formulation of the drug, its timing of administration in relation to meals and
      the use of coadministered drugs optimise, or at least ensure consistent
      absorption.

TI  - Assessment of peripheral vascular effects of antimigraine drugs in humans.
PG  - 288-91
AB  - The vascular beds of the forearm and finger can be used to study the peripheral
      effects of antimigraine drugs under normal and pathologic circumstances. We have 
      investigated the novel antimigraine drug sumatriptan, a selective agonist for
      5HT1 receptors. Its antimigraine effect may be attributed, at least in part, to
      constriction of cranial arteriovenous anastomoses (AVAs). In assessing the
      peripheral vascular effects of sumatriptan we used a forearm and finger blood
      flow model. Forearm blood flow (FBF) is mainly determined by resistance vessels, 
      whereas finger blood flow (FiBF) mainly involves skin vessels, which contain many
      AVAs. Changes in FBF and FiBF can be assessed using venous occlusion
      plethysmography. Changes in AVA flow are determined by measuring the patency of
      the vascular beds of the forearm and hand to well-defined radiolabelled
      microspheres, which are injected into the brachial artery. We report the effects 
      of sumatriptan on FBF, FiBF and AVA flow when administered into the brachial
      artery of healthy volunteers, and discuss the peripheral vascular effects of
      therapeutic doses of sumatriptan when given subcutaneously in migraine patients
      during and between attacks.

TI  - Experimental headache in humans.
PG  - 281-7
AB  - The need for valid human experimental models of headache is obvious. Several
      compounds have been proposed as headache-inducing agents, but only the
      nitroglycerin (NTG) model has been validated. In healthy subjects, intravenous
      infusions of the nitric oxide (NO) donor NTG induce a dose-dependent headache and
      dilatation of the temporal, radial and middle cerebral artery. NTG-induced
      headache, although less intense, resembles migraine in pain characteristics, but 
      the accompanying symptoms are rarely present. Cephalic large arteries are dilated
      during migraine headache as well as during NTG headache. N-acetylcysteine
      enhances the formation of NO and potentiates NTG-induced headache, whereas
      mepyramine, a H1-antagonist capable of blocking histamine-induced headache, has
      no effect. Thus, the headache is dependent on NO or other steps in the NO
      cascade. The model is useful for pharmacological interventions and sumatriptan
      reduced the NTG-induced headache. The NTG model may be a valuable tool in the
      development of future migraine drugs.

TI  - Clinical experiences from Sweden on the use of subcutaneously administered
      sumatriptan in migraine and cluster headache.
PG  - 1256-61
AB  - This article reviews, from the practitioner's point of view, more than 1 year of 
      clinical experience of the use of subcutaneously administered sumatriptan
      succinate in the short-term treatment of migraine and cluster headache with
      regard to advantages and disadvantages of the drug. In accordance with the
      results of clinical trials, subcutaneous sumatriptan, also in the practitioner's 
      hands, was found to relieve migraine headaches and all other symptoms associated 
      with migraine in most patients and within a reasonable period. Adverse events,
      however, are common and were perceived by about 70% of the patients. The most
      common adverse events were pressure/stiffness in the neck and throat (32%),
      general tiredness (22%), pressure/tightness over the chest (21%), injection site 
      reactions (16%), and tingling sensations in the head and arms (14%). Headache
      recurrence within 24 hours is a clinical problem not only for the patient but
      also for the prescribing physician. About every second (53%) migraineur using
      subcutaneous sumatriptan reports headache recurrence. Headache recurrence appears
      to be effectively treated by a second injection. Pending valid information about 
      effects, adverse events, headache recurrence, and how to handle the autoinjector,
      the compliance and tolerability of subcutaneous sumatriptan appear to be most
      satisfactory among eligible patients with migraine.

TI  - [Sumatriptan in the treatment of migraine in general practice].
PG  - 3430-2
AB  - Approximately 5% of the adult Norwegian population suffer from migraine.
      Sumatriptan is a new anti-migraine drug which has been shown in clinical studies 
      to be efficacious in up to 80% of attacks treated. These early clinical studies
      have all been carried out at specialist centres and the present study was planned
      to see if migraine patients treated by general practitioners would also benefit
      from this new therapy. This placebo controlled, randomized, double blind study
      was carried out by 50 general practitioners and two neurologists, and included
      294 patients. A total of 1,485 migraine attacks were treated. The results show
      that Sumatriptan is equally efficacious and well tolerated when used to treat
      patients in general practice as at specialist clinics. Sumatriptan was
      efficacious in relieving pain and other migraine symptoms in 76% of the migraine 
      attacks treated, while placebo had the desired effect in 29% of attacks.

PG  - 923-7
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of i.v. and PR prochlorperazine for
      treatment of acute benign vascular or tension headache. DESIGN: Prospective,
      randomized, double-blind trial. SETTING: University emergency department with
      50,000 annual census. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-five adult patients enrolled on 46
      visits. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received 10 mg prochlorperazine i.v. and placebo 
      suppository or 25 mg prochlorperazine PR and placebo injection. Pain assessment
      was made using a 10-cm visual-analog scale; scores were analyzed using
      Wilcoxon/Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum tests (alpha of .01). RESULTS: Mean 60-minute
      pain scores for i.v. and PR groups were 0.6 and 3.5, respectively (P = .0002).
      Two patients (8.7%) in the i.v. group and six patients (26.1%) in the PR group
      required rescue analgesia (P = .12). CONCLUSION: i.v. prochlorperazine appears to
      provide more effective relief than PR prochlorperazine for benign vascular or
      tension headaches.

AB  - Pain is the most common presenting complaint heard in Emergency Medicine, yet it 
      is poorly controlled. Evaluation of this pain should be with use of objective
      pain scales completed by the patient, not relying on physician impression.
      Treatment modalities available in the Emergency Department, a review of
      medications and their dosing as well as specifics to pediatric pain management
      are presented. The final section reviews situation or diagnosis specific pain
      control: headaches, renal colic, polytrauma victims, abdominal pain, soft tissue 
      injury and acute arthritis. These recommendations are based on a Canadian
      Association of Emergency Physicians (CAEP) consensus conference held in April
      1993. The literature was reviewed extensively and used as the basis for the
      consensus workshops and discussion. At the writing of the consensus paper,
      however, no specific ideas were borrowed from any one article. The appended
      bibliography is suggested reading, selected from the larger literature review.
      There are to date few controlled multi centre trials in overall pain management
      that would allow guidelines to be produced.

TI  - Sumatriptan clinical pharmacokinetics.
PG  - 337-44
AB  - Sumatriptan is a novel serotonin 1 (5-hydroxytryptamine 1; 5-HT1)-like agonist
      which has been shown to be effective in the treatment of acute migraine.
      Single-dose pharmacokinetic studies reflect the way that sumatriptan will be used
      in routine practice, but relatively few studies have been published.
      Bioavailability is high (96%) following subcutaneous injection, but low (14%)
      following oral administration because of first-pass metabolism. Absorption is
      rapid after subcutaneous injection, with peak concentration reached in 10
      minutes. After oral administration, multiple peak concentrations are observed,
      but a concentration that is 75% of the final peak concentration is usually
      reached within 45 minutes. Less than 20% of the drug is protein bound. The volume
      of distribution is greater than total body water at 170L. Total plasma clearance 
      is rapid, with an elimination half-life of around 2 hours. There is one major
      metabolite (an indole acetic acid analogue) which is excreted in the urine as the
      free acid and its ester glucuronide conjugate. The pharmacokinetic profile of
      sumatriptan is not significantly affected by an acute migraine attack (absorption
      phase), old age or gender. Pharmacokinetic studies in individuals with hepatic
      and renal disease have not been published; however, care should be taken when
      sumatriptan is administered to patients with liver disease until such information
      is available. No significant interaction was found between sumatriptan and
      propranolol, flunarizine, pizotifen or alcohol (ethanol).

TI  - Treatment of juvenile migraine with subcutaneous sumatriptan.
PG  - 581-2
AB  - An open, prospective study was undertaken to assess the efficacy and safety of
      subcutaneous sumatriptan in 17 children, ages 6 to 16 years, with severe,
      recurrent migraine. A 6-mg dose was used in 15 patients and relieved headache
      within 1 hour in six and by 2 hours in five others. Two smaller children received
      a 3-mg dose and both were headache-free within 2 hours. Most also reported marked
      improvement in associated symptoms such as nausea and photophobia. Four subjects 
      had no clinical improvement after a 6-mg dose. Side effects, such as neck
      pressure, were brief and mild. These findings suggest that subcutaneous
      sumatriptan can be both effective and safe as an abortive agent in juvenile
      migraine, but the appropriate dose in smaller children will need further
      investigation.

TI  - Sumatriptan in acute migraine using a novel cartridge system self-injector.
      United Kingdom Study Group.
PG  - 559-63
AB  - This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter
      study assessed the efficacy, acceptability, safety, and tolerability of
      subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg administered using a novel cartridge system
      self-injector for the acute treatment of migraine. Eighty-six patients treated
      one migraine attack at home with sumatriptan or placebo. A second identical
      injection was available after 1 hour for inadequate relief or if the headache
      recurred. Rescue medication was available 1 hour later. The primary end point was
      headache relief (improvement in headache from moderate or severe to mild or no
      pain) within 60 minutes of the first injection. Secondary end points included the
      acceptability of the self-injector, requirement for and efficacy of a second
      dose, relief of nonheadache symptoms, use of rescue medication, and adverse
      events. Significantly more patients taking sumatriptan than placebo reported
      headache relief 1 hour after the first injection (88% vs 11%, P < 0.001). The
      device was well accepted by patients; about 90% found it easy to use and wanted
      to take further medication using it. Significantly fewer patients taking
      sumatriptan than placebo required a second injection (33% vs 92%, P < 0.001) or
      rescue medication after the second injection (35% vs 67% P < 0.05). Significantly
      more patients taking sumatriptan than placebo reported headache relief after the 
      second injection (83% vs 32%, P < 0.01), and resolution of nonheadache migraine
      symptoms (54% vs 23%, P < 0.01). Sumatriptan was generally well tolerated.
      Subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg self-administered using the novel self-injector is 
      an effective, well accepted, and well tolerated acute treatment of migraine.

TI  - A literature review comparing the economic, clinical, and humanistic attributes
      of dihydroergotamine and sumatriptan.
PG  - 1037-51; discussion 1036
AB  - The value of different pharmaceuticals in treating migraine is frequently based
      on clinical efficacy only. This article assumes a broader perspective and
      compares the clinical, economic, and humanistic attributes of two antimigraine
      medications, dihydroergotamine (DHE) and sumatriptan, based on a literature
      review. DHE is an established product with over 40 years of use in the treatment 
      of migraine. Sumatriptan is a new product with a higher acquisition cost than
      DHE. Because sumatriptan costs more than DHE, the question must be asked. "Does
      sumatriptan provide advantages that offset this price differential?" This
      question reflects the growing concern among payers and patients over the cost and
      effectiveness of therapies. However, it is not easily answered. Direct
      comparative data are not available, and data sources are different for the two
      products. Moreover, the products are currently marketed in different dosage
      forms--intramuscular for DHE and subcutaneous for sumatriptan. The literature
      reviewed indicates that the clinical attributes of the two products are similar, 
      with each having slightly different advantages and disadvantages. However, the
      DHE literature is generally limited to uncontrolled studies, whereas the
      sumatriptan literature reports the results of rigorously designed, randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials. Published data on the products'
      economic and humanistic attributes are limited. We concluded that the literature 
      does provide important, albeit limited, data on the economic, clinical, and
      humanistic attributes of DHE and sumatriptan that permit restricted comparisons. 
      The limitations of the data highlight the need for comparative studies of these
      products' multidimensional attributes both in controlled clinical trials and
      under actual practice conditions.

TI  - Is chest pain after sumatriptan oesophageal in origin?
PG  - 985-6
AB  - 3-5% of patients taking the 5HT1D agonist sumatriptan for migraine have chest
      discomfort, suggesting a cardiac origin. We have investigated an alternative
      explanation of an oesophageal cause in 24 volunteers after the subcutaneous
      administration of a supratherapeutic dose of sumatriptan (16 mg) or placebo in a 
      randomised, double-blind crossover study. Sumatriptan did not alter the
      electrocardiogram but increased the amplitude (p < 0.001) and duration (p <
      0.001) of oesophageal contractions without affecting velocity of propagation.
      Clinically abnormal motility was also increased (p = 0.001), and was more common 
      in the 5 subjects with chest pain after sumatriptan. The effect of sumatriptan on
      oesophageal function provides an alternative explanation for the chest symptoms.

TI  - Oral sumatriptan: effect of a second dose, and incidence and treatment of
      headache recurrences.
PG  - 330-8
AB  - Oral sumatriptan in a dose of 100 mg aborts about 60% of migraine attacks within 
      2 h, but the headache may recur within 24 h. We investigated: (i) the incidence
      of headache recurrence after oral sumatriptan (ii) whether a second tablet of
      sumatriptan at 2 h increases initial efficacy and/or (iii) prevents headache
      recurrence and (iv) whether a further tablet of sumatriptan treats headache
      recurrence. In a randomized parallel-group clinical trial, 1246 patients treated 
      one to three migraine attacks (with or without aura), with 100 mg oral
      sumatriptan. Two hours later they all took a double-blind randomized second table
      of sumatriptan (group I) or placebo (group II). Patients who initially improved, 
      but then experienced headache recurrence took a further double-blind randomized
      tablet of sumatriptan or placebo. Proportions of patients who improved from
      moderate/severe headache to mild/none were similar in groups I and III at 2 h (55
      vs 56%) and 4 h (80 vs 77%). Incidences of headache recurrence
      (moderate/severe-any grade of headache) and median times to headache recurrence
      were also similar: 22-32% at 16 h in group I and 25-33% at 16.5 h in group II.
      Sumatriptan was superior to placebo in treating headache recurrence: 74 vs 49% (p
      = 0.017) in group I and 70 vs 30% (p = 0.0001) in group II. Thus, one-fourth of
      patients experience headache recurrence at about 16 h after successful treatment 
      of a migraine attack with 100 mg oral sumatriptan. A second tablet of sumatriptan
      at 2 h does not increase initial efficacy and neither prevents nor delays
      headache recurrence.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

      sparse. While noradrenaline and NPY cause vasoconstriction, VIP, SP and CGRP are 
      potent vasodilators. Stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion in cat and man
      elicits release of SP and CGRP. Subjects with spontaneous attacks of migraine
      show release of CGRP in parallel with headache. Cluster headache patients have
      release of CGRP and VIP during bouts. Treatment with sumatriptan aborts headache 
      in migraine and cluster headache as well as the concomitant peptide release.

TI  - Oral sumatriptan in the treatment of recurrent headache.
PG  - 766-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sumatriptan is effective for the treatment of acute migraine.
      However, headache may recur in about 30% of patients within 24 hours of
      successful treatment. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of oral sumatriptan,
      100 mg, in the treatment of headache recurring within 24 hours of achieving
      headache resolution with subcutaneous sumatriptan, 6 mg. STUDY DESIGN:
      Subcutaneous sumatriptan was administered for up to 12 migraine attacks in a
      randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study. Patients whose headache was
      completely resolved 90 minutes after subcutaneous dosing received either oral
      sumatriptan or placebo at the onset of recurrent headache. Patients whose
      headache was not completely resolved were offered rescue medication, including
      sumatriptan. Patients rated headache severity for 24 hours. SETTING: Fifteen US
      outpatient clinics. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Percentage of patients with relief of
      recurrent headache and adverse events. RESULTS: Approximately 90% of patients
      achieved relief of headache (severe or moderate headache reduced to mild or no
      headache) by 90 minutes after unblinded subcutaneous administration of
      sumatriptan. Efficacy rates were at least 80% regardless of whether the headache 
      fulfilled the International Headache Society criteria for migraine. About 64% of 
      patients achieved complete relief. Oral sumatriptan, 100 mg, relieved moderate or
      severe recurrent headache within 4 hours in up to 81% of patients. Oral
      sumatriptan administered as rescue medication to patients not headache-free did
      not relieve persistent headache. The incidence, pattern, and severity of adverse 
      events after combined subcutaneous and oral administration of sumatriptan were
      similar to those after subcutaneous administration alone. CONCLUSIONS: Oral
      sumatriptan was consistently effective in the treatment of headache recurrence.

AB  - This double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group study assessed
      whether subcutaneous sumatriptan administered during the migraine aura would
      prolong or modify the aura and prevent or delay development of the headache. One 
      hundred seventy-one patients (88 receiving 6 mg sumatriptan, 83 receiving
      placebo) treated a single attack of migraine with typical aura at home, by
      self-injection. The median duration of aura following the first injection was 25 
      minutes for the sumatriptan group and 30 minutes for the placebo group (NS). The 
      aura symptom profile was similar for the two treatment groups. The proportion of 
      patients who developed a moderate or severe headache within 6 hours after dose
      administration was similar in the two groups--68% among those receiving
      sumatriptan and 75% among those receiving placebo (NS). Sumatriptan given during 
      the aura did not prolong or alter the nature of the migraine aura and did not
      prevent or significantly delay headache development.

TI  - Combined oral lysine acetylsalicylate and metoclopramide in the acute treatment
      of migraine: a multicentre double-blind placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 297-300
AB  - This multicentre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel study
      was designed to evaluate the efficacy of combined oral lysine acetylsalicylate
      and metoclopramide (LAS-MCP) in the acute treatment of migraine attacks. A total 
      of 266 patients, 18-65 years old, with two to six attacks of migraine with or
      without aura (IHS criteria) per month were included. The patients had to treat
      two migraine attacks with LAS-MCP (1620 mg lysine acetylsalicylate--the
      equivalent of 900 mg aspirin--combined with 10 mg metoclopramide) or placebo. The
      main outcome measure was headache relief (reduction in headache severity from
      grade 3 or 2--severe or moderate--to grade 1 or 0--mild or none) 2 h after
      treatment. LAS-MCP was superior to placebo for headache relief (56% vs 28%) and
      for the following secondary outcome measures: complete headache relief (18% vs
      7%; p < 0.001), nausea (28% vs 44%; p < 0.001), vomiting (3% vs 11%; p = 0.001), 
      use of rescue medication (47% vs 68%; p < 0.001), global efficacy judged as good 
      or excellent (32% vs 14%; p < 0.001). The tolerability was considered as good in 
      94% of treated attacks in both groups. Combined oral lysine acetylsalicylate and 
      metoclopramide is an effective and well-tolerated acute treatment of migraine
      attacks.

PG  - 291-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the therapeutic response to sumatriptan in the acute
      migraine attack, MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two hundred and thirty migraineurs
      diagnosed by their general practitioners in accordance with their usual practice 
      were included in the study. The patients treated two migraine attacks at home by 
      subcutaneous injection of sumatriptan or placebo for the first attack and the
      alternative medication, i.e. placebo or sumatriptan, for the second attack
      (crossover). Following treatment, a neurology resident interviewed and examined
      the patients. RESULTS: When sumatriptan was compared to placebo, significantly
      more of the 209 evaluable patients reported headache relief at 1 h (56% vs 8%, p 
      < 0.001) and 2 h (62% vs 15%, p < 0.001) after the first injection. Resolution of
      nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia was significantly more common in patients on
      sumatriptan than in those on placebo (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). The adverse
      events were usually transient and of mild or moderate severity; however, three
      patients withdrew due to adverse events. Ninety-five percent of patients
      evaluated by a neurology resident met the IHS criteria for migraine. CONCLUSION: 
      In general practice, sumatriptan taken subcutaneously using an autoinjector at
      home was an effective and well tolerated acute treatment for migraine.

      intranasal sumatriptan for the acute treatment of migraine. Study medication was 
      taken as a single dose through one nostril in the first study, and as a divided
      dose through two nostrils in the second study. Totals of 245 and 210 patients
      with a history of migraine were recruited into the one- and two-nostril studies, 
      respectively. In both studies, headache severity had significantly improved at
      120 min after doses of 10-40 mg sumatriptan compared to placebo (P < 0.05) and
      the greatest efficacy rates were obtained with 20 mg sumatriptan. With 20 mg
      sumatriptan 78% and 74% of patients experienced headache relief in one- and
      two-nostril studies respectively. Sumatriptan was generally well tolerated, the
      most frequently reported event being taste disturbance. The results of the two
      studies are similar and indicate that administering sumatriptan as a divided dose
      via two nostrils confers no significant advantage over single-nostril
      administration.

PG  - 225-35
AB  - The efficacy and safety of single doses of 6 mg sumatriptan, self-administered
      subcutaneously by patients using an auto-injector, for the acute treatment of up 
      to three successive attacks of migraine was investigated in a multicentre, open, 
      uncontrolled study in which 178 patients were enrolled. At attack 1, there was an
      improvement in headache (from severe or moderate to mild or no headache) in 74%
      of patients at 1 h, and in 82% at 2 h. The incidence of symptoms associated with 
      migraine was decreased after sumatriptan injection. Nausea, vomiting and
      photo/phonophobia were reported by 72, 54, and 85% of patients, respectively,
      before the injection to treat attack 1, but by only 22, 12 and 27%, respectively,
      2 h after the injection. Migraine recurred within 24 h in 27% of patients, but in
      89% of patients was effectively treated with a further dose of 6 mg sumatriptan. 
      Results for attacks 2 and 3 were similar. About 40% of patients experienced at
      least one adverse event; most of these were mild or moderate in intensity and
      were transient. It is concluded that 6 mg sumatriptan, self-administered using an
      auto-injector, is an effective and well tolerated treatment for migraine.
      Sumatriptan was as effective at attack 3 as at attack 1, and there was no
      evidence of a change in the incidence or the nature of adverse events with
      successive uses of the drug.

TI  - Joint 1994 Wolff Award Presentation. Peripheral and central trigeminovascular
      activation in cat is blocked by the serotonin (5HT)-1D receptor agonist 311C90.
PG  - 394-9
AB  - Migraine headache involves the activation of trigeminal afferents that are
      predominantly found in the first or ophthalmic division of the nerve. The
      headache is often pounding and the connections of the trigeminal nerve, the
      trigeminovascular system, have therefore been implicated in the pathophysiology
      of migraine and studied extensively. Considerable attention has been given to the
      peripheral ramifications of the system as a possible locus of action for
      anti-migraine drugs while little attention has been focused upon possible central
      sites of action. It has been shown that certain peptides can act as markers for
      the trigeminal system, in particular calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and 
      that CGRP is elevated in migraine. We have employed an animal model for
      activation of the trigeminovascular system to evaluate a new antimigraine
      compound, 311C90, that may have central and as well as peripheral trigeminal
      actions. Cats were anesthetized by halothane induction and alpha-chloralose
      maintenance (60 mg/kg, intraperitoneal), intubated, paralyzed and ventilated.
      Biparietal craniotomies were carried out to measure cerebral blood flow using
      laser Doppler flowmetry (CBFLDF). The external jugular vein was cannulated and
      blood drawn, centrifuged and frozen until processing. Stimulation of the
      trigeminal ganglion resulted in a mean maximum increase in CBFLDF of 39 +/- 5% at
      20/s. The 5HT1 agonist 311C90 was administered intravenously in two doses (30 and
      100 micrograms/kg) to cover the range of doses likely to be effective clinically.
      At each dose the CBFLDF effect of trigeminal ganglion stimulation was
      inhibited.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Treatment of the migraine attack.
PG  - 258-63
AB  - Migraine is an episodic headache disorder that occurs with or without aura and is
      often accompanied by other symptoms. Treatment must address these associated
      symptoms as well as the headache, and it can involve either acute or preventive
      therapy alone or a combination of both. Acute therapy treats the individual
      attack; preventive therapy aims to reduce the frequency and severity of attacks. 
      Drug choice requires careful consideration and depends on the character of the
      migraine attack. Acute drug therapy using sumatriptan, MK-462, 311C90,
      dihydroergotamine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, butorphanol,
      metoclopramide, and domperidone is discussed. Prophylactic drug therapy using
      valproate and fluoxetine is also discussed.

PG  - 157-203
AB  - It is evident that in the last decade or so, a vast amount of new information has
      become available concerning the various 5-HT receptor types and their
      characteristics. This derives from two main research approaches, operational
      pharmacology, using selective ligands (both agonists and antagonists), and, more 
      recently, molecular biology. Although the scientific community continues to
      deliberate about the hierarchy of criteria for neurotransmitter receptor
      characterisation, there seems good agreement between the two approaches regarding
      5-HT receptor classification. In addition, the information regarding transduction
      mechanisms and second messengers is also entirely consistent. Thus, on the basis 
      of these essential criteria for receptor characterisation and classification,
      there are at least three main groups or classes of 5-HT receptor: 5-HT1, 5-HT2,
      and 5-HT3. Each group is not only operationally but also structurally distinct,
      with each receptor group having its own distinct transducing system. The more
      recently identified 5-HT4 receptor almost undoubtedly represents a fourth 5-HT
      receptor class on the basis of operational and transductional data, but this will
      only be definitively shown when the cDNA for the receptor has been cloned and the
      amino acid sequence of the protein is known. Although those 5-HT receptors that
      have been fully characterised and classified to date (and, hence, named with
      confidence) would seem to mediate the majority of the actions of 5-HT throughout 
      the mammalian body, not all receptors for 5-HT are fully encompassed within our
      scheme of classification. These apparent anomalies must be recognised and need
      further study. They may or may not represent new groups of 5-HT receptor or
      subtypes of already known groups of 5-HT receptor. Even though the cDNAs for the 
      5-ht1E, 5-ht1F, 5-ht5, 5-ht6, and 5-ht7 receptors have been cloned and their
      amino acid sequence defined, more data are necessary concerning their operational
      and transductional characteristics before one can be confident of the suitability
      of their appellations. Therefore, it is important to rationalise in concert all
      of the available data from studies involving both operational approaches of the
      classical pharmacological type and those from molecular and cellular
      biology.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

AB  - Corticosteroids are commonly used in the abortive therapy of status migrainosus. 
      However, this practice is based more on clinical experience than on published
      data. At my office, over a period of two years, 108 patients (156 migraine
      episodes) were treated with intravenous dexamethasone. Most of these patients had
      prolonged migraines that had resisted other forms of abortive therapy. The first 
      22 patients (32 migraine episodes) were given 10 mg of dexamethasone over 5
      minutes, the next 39 patients (55 migraine episodes) were given 20 mg over 10
      minutes, and the last 47 patients (69 migraine episodes) were given 3.5 mg of
      prochlorperazine over 5 minutes followed by 20 mg of dexamethasone over 10
      minutes. Adverse effects were minor and patients with episodic migraines
      responded more favorably than those with intractable migraines. In the episodic
      migraine groups, response rates ranged from 80-89%, relapse rates from 29-35%,
      and remission rates from 57-83%. After the intravenous injections, repetitive
      oral abortive therapy was often required to treat relapses and secure remission. 
      Adding 3.5 mg of prochlorperazine to 20 mg of intravenous dexamethasone
      significantly shortened the response time.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Compare adult migraineurs' health related quality of life to adults in
      the general U.S. population reporting no chronic conditions, and to samples of
      patients with other chronic conditions. METHODS: Subjects (n = 845) were surveyed
      2-6 months after participation in a placebo-controlled clinical trial and asked
      to complete a questionnaire including the SF-36 Health Survey, a migraine
      severity measurement scale and demographics. Results were adjusted for severity
      of illness and comorbidities. Scores were compared with responses to the same
      survey by the U.S. sample and by patients with other chronic conditions. RESULTS:
      Response rate was 67%. After adjustment for comorbid conditions, SF-36 scale
      scores were significantly (P 0.001) lower in migraineurs, relative to age and
      sex-adjusted norms for the U.S. sample with no chronic conditions. Some health
      dimensions were more affected by migraine than other chronic conditions, while
      other dimensions were less affected by migraine. Measures of bodily pain, role
      disability due to physical health and social functioning discriminated best
      between migraineurs, the U.S. sample, and patients with other chronic conditions.
      Patients reporting moderate, severe and very severe migraines scored
      significantly (P < or = 0.001) lower on five of the eight SF-36 scales than the
      U.S. sample. CONCLUSIONS: Migraine has a unique, significant quality of life
      burden.

TI  - Human in vivo evidence for trigeminovascular activation in cluster headache.
      Neuropeptide changes and effects of acute attacks therapies.
PG  - 427-34
AB  - Cluster headache is a rare very severe disorder that is clinically well
      characterized with a relatively poorly understood pathophysiology. In this study 
      patients with episodic cluster headache fulfilling the criteria of the
      International Headache Society were examined during an acute spontaneous attack
      of headache to determine the local cranial release of neuropeptides. Blood was
      sampled from the external jugular vein ipsilateral to the pain before and after
      treatment of the attack. Samples were assayed for calcitonin gene-related peptide
      (CGRP), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), substance P and neuropeptide Y. 
      Attacks were treated with either oxygen inhalation, sumatriptan or an opiate.
      Thirteen patients were studied of whom 10 were male and three female. All had
      well-established typical attacks of cluster headache when blood was sampled.
      During the attacks external jugular vein blood levels of CGRP and VIP were raised
      while there was no change in neuropeptide Y or substance P. Calcitonin
      gene-related peptide levels rose to 110 +/- 7 pmol/l (normal: < 40) while VIP
      levels rose to 20 +/- 3 pmol/l (normal: < 7). Treatment with both oxygen and
      subcutaneous sumatriptan reduced the CGRP level to normal, while opiate
      administration did not alter the peptide levels. These data demonstrate for the
      first time in vivo human evidence for activation of the trigeminovascular system 
      and the cranial parasympathetic nervous system in an acute attack of cluster
      headache. Furthermore, it is shown that both oxygen and sumatriptan abort the
      attacks and terminate activity in the trigeminovascular system.

      healthcare setting.
PG  - 659-64
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare healthcare use and associated costs in patients with
      migraine and patients without migraine headache. DESIGN: Retrospective review of 
      a managed care organization's medical and pharmacy claims databases for claims
      filed between January 1, 1989 and June 30, 1990. PATIENTS: Patients between 18
      and 64 years old with a 12-month minimum enrollment in the health plan, including
      enrollment for the prescription drug benefit. Migraine group (n = 1336) inclusion
      required a medical claim with the diagnosis of migraine headache and a pharmacy
      claim for a medication potentially used for migraine treatment. Comparison group 
      (n = 1336) inclusion required at least one medical claim with no diagnosis of
      migraine; a pharmacy claim was not required. Comparison group patients were
      matched to migraine group patients by age, gender, enrollment status, and
      subscriber or dependent enrollment status. OUTCOME MEASURES: Total health
      services use, diagnosis-specific use of services, diagnostic procedures
      performed, comorbid conditions, medication use, and associated costs were
      tallied. RESULTS: Migraineurs generated nearly twice as many medical claims as
      comparison group patients, and nearly 2.5 times as many pharmacy claims. Number
      of claims generated and numbers of patients who generated claims within each of
      19 diagnostic categories indicated greater comorbidity in the migraine group.
      Migraineurs used emergency services more than did patients in the comparison
      group. Total medical and pharmacy claims costs were $3.4 million for the migraine
      group and $2.1 million for the comparison group. The average amount paid per
      member-month of enrollment was significantly greater in the migraine group than
      in the comparison group. Comorbid conditions were responsible for a significant
      portion of costs in the migraine group. The migraine group incurred $83,537 for
      diagnostic procedures compared with $13,140 incurred by the comparison group.
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients with migraine had greater morbidity in general and incurred
      64 percent greater costs in healthcare resource use compared with patients
      without migraine.

TI  - Exteroceptive suppression of temporalis muscle activity during migraine attack
      and migraine interval before and after treatment with sumatriptan.
PG  - 143-8
AB  - We compared the early (ES1) and late (ES2) exteroceptive suppression (ES) periods
      of temporalis muscle activity in 18 migraine patients during both the migraine
      interval and migraine attack and investigated the effect of sumatriptan and
      placebo on ES parameters. The measurements were performed in a balanced sequence 
      at four different times on each patient, twice during the migraine interval and
      once in each of two migraine attacks. First ES1 and ES2 were measured (stimulus
      intensity 20 mA, stimulus duration 0.2 ms, stimulation frequency 2 Hz, averaging 
      of 10 responses), then the medication was given on a double-blind basis with an
      autoinjector using either 6 mg sumatriptan or a placebo solution. Thirty minutes 
      after application the measurements were repeated. No significant differences were
      found in early and late exteroceptive suppression latencies and durations between
      baseline measurements. Treatment did not affect the latencies of ES1 and ES2.
      While sumatriptan caused a significant increase in ES1 duration (p < or = 0.05)
      both during the migraine interval and during the migraine attack, placebo showed 
      no significant effect on ES1 duration. Treatment with sumatriptan during the
      migraine attack was accompanied by a significant increase in the duration of ES2 
      (p < or = 0.05), but no significant changes in the durations of the late
      suppression periods were observed under any other conditions. The results do not 
      support the assumption that under the experimental conditions chosen migraine
      attacks are accompanied by a paroxysmal change in the brain-stem mechanisms
      involved in the modulation of the ES parameters.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Sumatriptan. A reappraisal of its pharmacology and therapeutic efficacy in the
      acute treatment of migraine and cluster headache.
PG  - 622-51
AB  - Sumatriptan is a potent and selective agonist at a vascular serotonin1
      (5-hydroxytryptamine1; 5-HT1) receptor subtype (similar to 5-HT1D) and is used in
      acute treatment of migraine and cluster headache. Following administration of
      sumatriptan 100mg orally, relief of migraine headache (at 2 hours) was achieved
      in 50 to 67% of patients compared with 10 to 31% with placebo in controlled
      clinical trials. In a comparative study, oral administration of sumatriptan 100mg
      consistently achieved significantly greater response rates than a fixed
      combination of ergotamine 2mg plus caffeine 200mg during 3 consecutive migraine
      attacks (66 vs 48% for first attack). Oral sumatriptan 100mg was also more
      effective than aspirin 900mg plus metoclopramide 10mg orally in a similar study. 
      In the majority of controlled clinical trials, headache relief (at 1 hour after
      administration) was achieved in 70 to 80% of patients with migraine receiving
      sumatriptan 6mg subcutaneously compared with 18 to 26% of placebo recipients.
      Approximately 40% of patients who initially responded to oral or subcutaneous
      sumatriptan experienced recurrence of their headache, usually within 24 hours,
      but the majority of these patients responded well to a further dose of
      sumatriptan. Patients with cluster headache were treated for acute attacks with
      sumatriptan 6mg subcutaneously or placebo in 2 crossover trials. Headache relief 
      was achieved within 15 minutes in 74 and 75% of patients receiving sumatriptan in
      these studies compared with 26 and 35%, respectively, with placebo. Patients
      receiving sumatriptan 12mg had a similar response rate as those receiving 6mg,
      but the higher dose was associated with an increased incidence of adverse events.
      Based on extensive safety data pooled from controlled clinical trials,
      sumatriptan is generally well tolerated and most adverse events are transient.
      The most frequently reported adverse events following oral administration include
      nausea, vomiting, malaise, fatigue and dizziness. Injection site reactions (minor
      pain and redness of brief duration) occur in approximately 40% of patients
      receiving subcutaneous sumatriptan, although the incidence appears to be markedly
      reduced when patients self-administer the drug with an auto-injector. Chest
      symptoms (mainly tightness and pressure) occur in 3 to 5% of sumatriptan
      recipients, but have not been associated with myocardial ischaemia except in a
      few isolated cases. Sumatriptan is contraindicated in patients with ischaemic
      heart disease, angina pectoris including Prinzmetal (variant) angina, previous
      myocardial infarction and uncontrolled hypertension, but is not contraindicated
      in patients with migraine and asthma. Data from long term studies in acute
      treatment of migraine and cluster headache suggest that sumatriptan remains
      effective and well tolerated over several months.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400

TI  - Self-treatment of acute migraine with subcutaneous sumatriptan using an
      auto-injector device: comparison with customary treatment in an open,
      longitudinal study.
PG  - 55-63
AB  - In a multicenter open longitudinal clinical trial where 479 patients suffering
      from migraine with or without aura were recruited, patients treated at home one
      to three migraine attacks with their customary treatment, and subsequently, over 
      a 3-month period, one to three migraine attacks with 6 mg sumatriptan sc using an
      autoinjector. The headache response to customary treatment was 19% at 1 h and
      30.5% at 2 h, and was not significantly different when only attacks treated
      "adequately" according to accepted treatment recommendations were considered: 16%
      at 1 h and 35% at 2 h. In contrast, 69% and 82% of patients treated with 6 mg
      sumatriptan sc had mild headache or no headache at 1 and 2 h respectively,
      regardless of migraine type or duration of symptoms prior to treatment. Other
      migraine symptoms (nausea, vomiting, photo- and phonophobia) were effectively
      treated with sumatriptan. Recurrence of migraine was observed in 31% of patients 
      and was well controlled by a second injection of sumatriptan. It is concluded
      that 6 mg sumatriptan sc, self-administered using an autoinjector, is well
      tolerated and more effective than most currently used acute treatments for
      migraine in a population of severely affected patients consulting a neurologist.

TI  - Subcutaneous sumatriptan in a clinical setting: the first 100 consecutive
      patients with acute migraine in a tertiary care center.
PG  - 67-72
AB  - The first 100 consecutive patients at our center receiving subcutaneous
      sumatriptan (6 mg) were evaluated over a total of 455 migraine attacks.
      Parameters included overall efficacy, average time to relief, recurrence rate,
      average time to recurrence, adverse events, comparison to previous abortive
      agents, and subjective global ratings. Overall efficacy (defined as headache
      severity reduction from severe or moderate to mild or none) was 84%. Average time
      to relief was 40 minutes. Nine percent failed to respond at all. Recurrence rate 
      was 46.5% with 36% of patients having no recurrence. Fourteen percent of patients
      reported 100% recurrence (minimum 3 attacks; average 5.4 attacks). Time to
      recurrence varied widely, but averaged 9.1 hours. Eighty-one percent rated the
      drug better or much better than previous abortive medications in terms of
      sumatriptan's ability to abort the attack. Seventy-seven percent reported some
      adverse event (generally mild and transient) with 23% reporting no adverse
      events. Sixty-nine percent reported a global rating of Good to Excellent and 31% 
      rated Poor or Fair. The rate of recurrence and average time to recurrence were
      the most significant factors affecting the global ratings. These parameters were 
      further evaluated with respect to a variety of subgroups: 1) migraine alone 2)
      migraine with co-existent tension-type headache 3) drug-induced headache
      (analgesic rebound headache) 4) posttraumatic headache 5) preventive versus no
      preventive medication 6) presence or absence of adverse events 7) presence or
      absence of recurrence and 8) average duration of migraine with no medication.

TI  - The neuroendocrine effects of sumatriptan, a specific ligand for 5-HT1-like
      receptors.
PG  - 211-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A relationship between the serotoninergic and the opiatergic system in
      the pathogenesis of head pain is supported by several data. This study was
      carried out to investigate the neuroendocrine effects of sumatriptan, a specific 
      serotonin agonist used in the treatment of migraine, on
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (PHA) hormones. DESIGN: Two consecutive
      studies were performed. In study A, eight subjects received a subcutaneous (s.c.)
      injection of sumatriptan (6 mg). In study B, a further six subjects were
      randomized to receive either sumatriptan or placebo. SUBJECTS: Healthy volunteers
      recruited within the staff (eight males and six females) were studied.
      MEASUREMENT: In study A, plasma cortisol and PRL were measured by direct RIA and 
      beta-endorphin after extraction and chromatography. Samples were collected from
      60 minutes before to 120 minutes after the administration of the drug, at
      15-minute intervals. According to the data of the first study, in study B, in
      addition to cortisol and beta-endorphin, ACTH was also measured. RESULTS:
      Significant increases in the mean beta-endorphin and cortisol concentrations were
      found in every subject receiving sumatriptan, while no significant changes were
      observed in prolactin plasma levels. Study B confirmed the activation of the
      pituitary-adrenal axis, additionally demonstrating the release of ACTH, and
      indicated that placebo has no effects. CONCLUSION: Acute s.c. stimulation with
      sumatriptan activates the pituitary-adrenal axis.

TI  - The effects of sumatriptan on pituitary secretion in man.
PG  - 235-9
AB  - Sumatriptan, a new antimigraine drug with high affinity and selectivity for
      certain 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT1D) receptor subtypes, was administered to 12
      normal subjects, in order to investigate the effects of 5-HT receptor activation 
      on anterior pituitary secretion. Sumatriptan increased plasma growth hormone (GH)
      levels from 2.5 +/- 0.5 mIU/l in basal conditions to 17.3 +/- 2.6 mIU/l 30 min
      after administration of the drug. After pre-treatment with cyproheptadine, an
      anti-serotoninergic drug known to inhibit GH secretion, the mean integrated
      sumatriptan-induced GH response decreased from 14.8 +/- 3.9 muI/l*hr to 3.7 +/-
      1.7 mIU/l*hr. Sumatriptan administration did not have any effect on the secretion
      of the other anterior pituitary hormones. It is concluded that sumatriptan
      selectively increases GH secretion in man, but the exact nature of the receptors 
      involved is not yet known.

TI  - Function of the peripheral serotoninergic pathways in migraine: a proposal for an
      experimental model.
PG  - 11-5; discussion 4
AB  - We propose a model for assessing the function of 5HT receptors in migraine by
      evaluating their expression on monocytes by means of double-labeling
      fluorocytometry (CD14-positive cells FITC-labeled). This model demonstrates that 
      during headache induced in migraine without aura sufferers given isosorbide
      dinitrate followed by sumatriptan treatment 5HT expression on monocytes
      progressively increases. This increase may be due to the activation of 5HT
      turnover and to the increased availability of 5HT displaced by sumatriptan from
      cerebrovascular receptors during head pain.

PG  - 138-44
AB  - This multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group study compared the efficacy,
      safety and tolerability of oral sumatriptan, given as a new film-coated tablet,
      with placebo in the acute treatment of migraine. Patients were randomised
      unequally (1:2) to receive placebo or sumatriptan. Eighty-eight patients received
      placebo (plus an optional dose 2 h later if the headache persisted plus a further
      optional dose for recurrence within 24 h) and 162 patients received sumatriptan
      100 mg (plus an optional 100 mg dose at 2 h and an optional 100 mg dose within 24
      h). Sumatriptan was significantly more effective than placebo at relieving
      headache (defined as reduction in severity from severe or moderate pain to mild
      or no pain) at 2 h (51% versus 31%, P = 0.003) and 4 h (71% versus 35%, P <
      0.001). Fewer sumatriptan-treated patients required a second dose compared with
      placebo-treated patients (49% versus 74%, P < 0.001). More sumatriptan-treated
      patients were completely pain free compared with placebo-treated patients at both
      2 h (24% versus 12%) and 4 h (48% versus 18). Patients receiving sumatriptan
      reported earlier onset of headache relief than patients receiving placebo.
      Headache relief in sumatriptan-treated patients was similar, irrespective of the 
      type of migraine (with or without aura) or the time of treatment < or = 4 h or > 
      4 h after onset of migraine). Sumatriptan was more effective than placebo at
      relieving nausea, vomiting and photophobia/phonophobia. Few patients were
      evaluable for treatment of headache recurrence, and statistical analysis was not 
      possible.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Neuroendocrine effects of sumatriptan.
PG  - 561-4
AB  - The neuroendocrine effects of the 5-HT receptor agonist, sumatriptan (6 mg
      subcutaneously), were studied in 11 healthy male subjects using a
      placebo-controlled, cross-over design. Compared to placebo, sumatriptan
      significantly lowered levels of plasma prolactin but increased those of plasma
      growth hormone. There was no effect on plasma cortisol concentrations. The
      neuroendocrine effects of sumatriptan differ from those of previously described
      5-HT-receptor agonists, and may be a consequence of selective activation of
      5-HT1D or 5-HT1B receptors. However, the present data cannot exclude the
      possibility that the neuroendocrine changes reflect nonspecific stress responses 
      or changes in pituitary blood flow.

PG  - 35-9
AB  - Cluster headache is a rare form of severe idiopathic headache characterized by
      unilateral short-lasting episodes of excruciating pain in association with
      autonomic disturbances. Subcutaneous sumatriptan has been investigated as an
      acute treatment for cluster headache in two randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, crossover trials. About 75% of patients given subcutaneous
      sumatriptan 6 mg reported headache relief within 15 min, in comparison with
      26-35% given placebo (p < 0.001 in both studies). The need for rescue medication 
      (100% oxygen by inhalation) at 15 min was significantly lower after sumatriptan
      treatment as were the severity of functional disability and incidence of
      non-headache symptoms. Results of a long-term study indicate that the
      tolerability and efficacy of sumatriptan 6 mg is maintained in long-term use, and
      that there is no evidence of tachyphylaxis.

TI  - The clinical profile of sumatriptan: efficacy in migraine.
PG  - 26-34
AB  - The efficacy of the 5-HT1 receptor agonist sumatriptan in the acute treatment of 
      migraine has been investigated in an extensive programme of controlled clinical
      trials. Sumatriptan provided rapid relief from migraine headache with onset of
      relief occurring within 10 min of a 6 mg subcutaneous injection and within 30 min
      of a 100 mg oral dose. Maximum benefit was observed by 2 h after the injection
      and 4 h after the oral dose. Sumatriptan also significantly decreased the
      incidence of associated migraine symptoms (nausea, photophobia, phonophobia) and 
      the need for rescue medication. Sumatriptan was an effective treatment for
      migraine with and without aura and when used at any time during the attack. Oral 
      sumatriptan 100 mg provided significantly greater pain relief and had a more
      rapid onset of action than two commonly used acute treatments for migraine.
      Efficacy is maintained in long-term use, with no evidence of tachyphylaxis or
      dependence. Sumatriptan, whether given subcutaneously or orally, is an effective 
      long-term acute treatment for migraine.

PG  - 70-9
AB  - Technologic change has proceeded at a rapid pace during the past twenty years,
      and advances that are even more remarkable are in sight over the next decade.
      These changes will be driven largely by advances in molecular and cell biology,
      imaging techniques, and tissue engineering. Therapies directed toward causes
      rather than consequences of disease could conceivably produce inexpensive cures
      and thus slow the rise in medical costs. A more likely scenario envisions a
      continued rise in costs as advances in technology produce many expensive
      interventions that extend life but are not curative.

TI  - Upregulated expression of peripheral serotonergic receptors in migraine and
      cluster headache by sumatriptan.
PG  - 165-75
AB  - The double-label flow cytometric analysis of peripheral serotonergic pathways of 
      migraine and cluster headache on a monocyte model has been used to evaluate the
      activity of drugs with a selective activity on central vascular 5-HT1D receptors,
      such as sumatriptan, ergotamine and ondansetron. The results indicated that
      sumatriptan and ergotamine progressively increase the peripheral expression of
      5-HT (5-hydroxytryptamine, serotonin). The increase obtained in migraine after
      ergotamine is more evident than that obtained in cases of cluster headache.
      Ondansetron produced a moderate increase in serotonergic expression only in
      cluster headache. The events that occur at intracranic neural and vascular level 
      may cause the described changes of 5-HT expression on the monocyte model as an
      indirect, reflective, peripheral registration of central serotonergic variations 
      during headache attack as well as during the drug-sustained recovery phase.

TI  - Sumatriptan does not affect vasopressin secretion in humans.
PG  - 555-8
AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of a new serotoninergic drug,
      sumatriptan, on arginine vasopressin secretion in humans. Plasma vasopressin
      concentrations were determined in eight healthy volunteers, before and after
      administration of 6 mg of sumatriptan, or placebo. No changes in hormone levels
      were found after sumatriptan or placebo administration. The results suggest that 
      in humans serotoninergic mechanisms, which modulate vasopressin secretion, do not
      involve the serotonin receptor activated by sumatriptan.

TI  - Amplifying effect of sumatriptan on noradrenaline venoconstriction in migraine
      patients.
PG  - 383-8
AB  - The venoconstrictive activity of sumatriptan and its interaction with
      noradrenaline (NA)- and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) venoconstriction was studied in
      vivo in the hand vein of migraineurs. Sumatriptan, injected at increasing doses
      into the vein, caused local venoconstriction after a 500 microgram dose,
      comparable to that induced by 0.5-1 micrograms of 5HT. This venoconstriction was 
      completely inhibited by low doses of ketanserin (5 micrograms). Subcutaneous
      sumatriptan (6 mg) provoked a minor increase in vein tone, lasting less than 30
      min. Non-venoconstrictive doses of sumatriptan (10-100 micrograms), injected in
      the hand vein, produced an amplification of NA-venoconstriction but not of
      5HT-induced venoconstriction. A similar increased effect was displayed by
      subcutaneous sumatriptan (6 mg) for at least 1 h. Sumatriptan appears to cause
      peripheral venoconstriction only at high doses locally applied (in the hand
      vein), by acting on 5HT2 receptors. Clinical subcutaneous doses (6 mg) do not
      show significant venoconstrictive effects. The amplifying effect on NA
      venoconstriction, also caused by 5HT, ergotamine and dihydroergotamine in human
      cranial arteries, may be important in explaining the therapeutic action of
      sumatriptan in migraine attacks.

TI  - Comparison of contingent negative variation between migraine interval and

PG  - 570-2
AB  - We compared in a placebo controlled, double blind, crossover within-subject
      design, the amplitude and area integral of contingent negative variation (CNV)
      using a 2 second interstimulus interval in migraine patients between attack and
      interval before and after treatment. The study was conducted on 14 female
      subjects suffering from migraine without aura. The measurements were performed in
      a balanced sequence at four different times on each patient, twice during the
      migraine interval and once in each of two migraine attacks. The CNV in the
      patients was measured first (baseline), then medication was administered on a
      double-blind basis with an autoinjector, using either 6 mg sumatriptan or a
      placebo solution. Thirty minutes after administration the CNV parameters were
      measured again and the changes between pre- and post-treatment were taken as
      dependent variables. CNV amplitude baseline readings did not differ significantly
      between the four conditions. Neither administration of placebo nor sumatriptan
      led to a significant change in CNV parameters independent of whether significant 
      clinical improvement of migraine headache occurred or not. According to our
      findings CNV-mechanisms between attack and interval are not subject to short-term
      changes, even though a small, not significant tendency towards a decrease in CNV 
      amplitude during migraine attacks appears to exist. Therefore, it can be assumed 
      that changes in the systems which are depicted by CNV readings are not involved
      in initiating and terminating acute migraine attacks.

PG  - 432-5
AB  - The efficacy of sumatriptan, a 5-HT1 receptor agonist, in patients with migraine 
      attacks occurring despite prophylactic treatment with oral dihydroergotamine, was
      assessed in a double-blind placebo-controlled study involving 76 patients.
      Thirty-seven patients were treated with a subcutaneous injection of 6 mg
      sumatriptan self-administered with an auto-injector and 39 with placebo given by 
      the same route. Patients having inadequate relief were allowed to use a second
      injection of test medication 1 hour later and rescue treatment between 2 hours
      and 24 hours after the first dose. Headache relief was achieved within 2 hours
      after sumatriptan in 26 patients (70%) compared to 8 patients (21%) in the
      placebo group (P < 0.0001). Of these patients, 19 (51%) and 3 (8%) were,
      respectively, pain free at this time. A second injection of sumatriptan was used 
      by 8 (22%) patients compared to 30 (77%) patients in the placebo group (P <
      0.0001), whereas rescue medication was used respectively by 13 (35%) and 22 (58%)
      patients (P < 0.024). The adverse event profile of sumatriptan was not affected
      by the concomitant use of dihydroergotamine and side-effects were all minor and
      transient. Patient satisfaction was significantly higher in the sumatriptan group
      (75%) compared to patient satisfaction with placebo (16%). These results show
      that the high efficacy rate of subcutaneous sumatriptan and its safety profile
      remain unchanged in migraine patients receiving oral dihydroergotamine as
      prophylaxis.

AB  - Sumatriptan is a selective agonist of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors, recommended 
      for the acute treatment of migraine. The 5-HT1 receptor subtype is found in the
      cranial vasculature of many species including humans, and causes vasoconstriction
      of these vessels. Sumatriptan as a highly potent 5-HT1 agonist selectively
      constricts large intracranial blood vessels and also blocks neurogenic
      inflammation. Those treating patients with severe or inconveniently timed attacks
      will find sumatriptan the drug of choice.
