TI  - Reduced perception of urgency in treatment of overactive bladder with
      extended-release tolterodine.
PG  - 605-11
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of once-daily, extended-release tolterodine on 
      urinary urgency in patients with overactive bladder. METHODS: Patients with
      urinary frequency (eight or more micturitions per 24 hours) and urge incontinence
      (five or more episodes per week) were randomized to oral treatment with
      tolterodine extended release 4 mg once daily (n=398) or placebo (n=374) for 12
      weeks. Efficacy was assessed by use of patient perception evaluations. RESULTS:
      The results presented are a secondary analysis of this double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study. Of patients treated with tolterodine extended release, 
      44% reported improved urgency symptoms (compared with 32% for placebo), and 62%
      reported improved bladder symptoms (placebo, 48%) (both P<.001 compared with
      placebo). The odds of reducing urgency and improving bladder symptoms were 1.68
      and 1.78 times greater, respectively, for patients in the tolterodine extended
      release group than for patients receiving placebo. In response to urgency, there 
      was a more than six-fold increase in the proportion of patients able to finish a 
      task before voiding in the tolterodine extended release group. The proportion of 
      patients unable to hold urine upon experiencing urgency was also decreased by 58%
      with tolterodine, compared with 32% with placebo (P<.001). The proportion of
      patients reporting "much benefit" from treatment was greater for tolterodine
      extended release than for placebo (43% versus 24%; P<.001). The only adverse
      events with an incidence of greater than 5% were dry mouth, headache, and
      constipation, with only dry mouth markedly more frequent with tolterodine than
      with placebo. CONCLUSION: Tolterodine extended release has demonstrable efficacy 
      in reducing the severity of urinary urgency and is associated with improvements
      in overactive bladder symptoms that are meaningful to patients.

TI  - Controlled, double-blind, multicentre clinical trial to investigate long-term
      tolerability and efficacy of trospium chloride in patients with detrusor
      instability.
PG  - 392-9
AB  - Our objectives were to ascertain the tolerability and efficacy of trospium
      chloride in doses of 20 mg twice daily for long-term therapy (52 weeks) in
      patients with urge syndrome. The trial comprised a total of 358 patients with
      urge syndrome or urge incontinence. After randomisation in the ratio of 3:1,
      participants were treated continuously for 52 weeks with either trospium chloride
      (20 mg twice daily) or oxybutynin (5 mg twice daily). At intervals of 4-8 weeks, 
      patients were physically examined with measurements of blood pressure and pulse
      rate, were questioned about any adverse events, checked for compliance and
      underwent relevant laboratory tests. As an additional safety measure, an ECG was 
      made at 26 and 52 weeks. Urodynamic measurements were performed at the beginning,
      and at 26 and 52 weeks to determine the maximal cystometric bladder capacity.
      Among others things, the frequencies of micturition, incontinence and number of
      urgency events were recorded in patient diary protocols in weeks 0, 2, 26 and 52.
      The evaluation of vital parameters, laboratory results and ECGs did not show any 
      relevant changes attributable to the action of the anticholinergics. Analysis of 
      the micturition diary clearly indicated a reduction of the micturition frequency,
      incontinence frequency, and a reduction of the number of urgencies in both
      treatment groups. Mean maximum cystometric bladder capacity increased during
      treatment with trospium chloride by 92 ml after 26 weeks and 115 ml after 52
      weeks (P=0.001). Further comparison with oxybutynin did not reveal any
      statistically significant differences in urodynamic variables between the drugs. 
      Adverse events occurred in 64.8% of the patients treated with trospium chloride
      and 76.7% of those treated with oxybutynin. The main symptom encountered in both 
      treatment group was dryness of the mouth. For patients on trospium chloride, the 
      estimated risk of an unexpected adverse event was 0.027 per patient per week for 
      all adverse events and 0.009 for dryness of the mouth, resulting in a
      considerably lower risk during treatment given with trospium chloride than with
      oxybutynin (0.045 and 0.021, respectively). An overall assessment for each of the
      drugs reveals a comparable efficacy level and a better benefit-risk ratio for
      trospium chloride than for oxybutynin due to better tolerability.

TI  - Does gender or age affect the efficacy and safety of tolterodine?
PG  - 1027-31
AB  - PURPOSE: We compared the importance of patient age and gender relative to the
      intensity of baseline symptoms of overactive bladder in the therapeutic response 
      to the muscarinic receptor antagonist tolterodine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data
      from an open label, observational study of 2,250 patients with overactive bladder
      treated for 12 weeks with tolterodine were analyzed for alterations in frequency,
      urgency and urge incontinence, and for global efficacy and tolerability using
      logistic regression analysis, stratifying for gender, age, baseline symptom
      intensity and tolterodine dose. RESULTS: Gender or tolterodine dose were not
      consistently associated with altered treatment efficacy. Greater age was
      associated with a slight but statistically significant decrease in treatment
      efficacy. Patients with great baseline symptom intensity had greater treatment
      associated improvement but a lesser chance to become symptom-free. Even with a
      large number of patients no statistically significant gender or age associated
      alterations in the tolerability of tolterodine treatment were detected.
      CONCLUSIONS: The extent of the therapeutic response to tolterodine is largely
      determined by the extent of baseline symptoms. While gender does not affect the
      efficacy or tolerability of tolterodine in a clinically relevant manner, advanced
      age is associated with a slight decrease in efficacy but not in tolerability.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial of tolterodine and oxybutynin on tolerability and
      clinical efficacy for treating Chinese women with an overactive bladder.
PG  - 375-80
AB  - Objective To compare the tolerability and clinical efficacy of tolterodine and
      oxybutynin in the treatment of Hong Kong Chinese women with an overactive
      bladder. Patients and methods A randomized controlled trial was conducted at two 
      urogynaecology centres in Hong Kong. In all, 106 women with urodynamically
      confirmed detrusor instability were recruited. Baseline severity assessments
      included a visual analogue scale (VAS), urinary diary and urinary pad-test. The
      women were randomized to receive either oral tolterodine 2 mg or oxybutynin 5 mg 
      twice daily for 10 weeks. Treatment responses were assessed at 4 and 10 weeks
      using the VAS and urinary diary. Treatment tolerability was assessed at baseline,
      4 and 10 weeks using the Xerostomia Questionnaire. A urinary pad-test was
      repeated at 10 weeks. Results The perceived change from baseline VAS was better
      in the tolterodine than the oxybutynin group after 10 weeks of treatment
      (per-protocol analysis, P = 0.043). The two drugs were effective in reducing the 
      symptoms of frequency (P < 0.001). Tolterodine was significantly better than
      oxybutynin in reducing urinary leakage (urinary pad-test; median change - 5.00 g 
      vs 0 g, P = 0.019). Both drugs caused a significant worsening of dry mouth
      (overall dryness, P < 0.005; discomfort, P < 0.005; sleep, P = 0.021; speaking, P
      = 0.045; swallowing, P = 0.004; and liquid consumption, P = 0.017). Conclusions
      Both oxybutynin and tolterodine were effective in ameliorating the severity of
      the symptoms of detrusor instability. Tolterodine was better than oxybutynin in
      both subjective and objective outcome measures, but both drugs caused similar
      worsening of dry mouth that may limit the tolerability of these medications.

TI  - Long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy of extended-release tolterodine in
      the treatment of overactive bladder.
PG  - 588-95
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of the present study was to examine the long-term
      safety, tolerability and efficacy of tolterodine extended-release (ER) in
      patients who had completed 12 weeks' treatment in a randomised, double-blind
      study comparing tolterodine ER 4 mg once daily (qd), tolterodine
      immediate-release (IR) 2mg twice daily and placebo. METHODS: Of the 1377 patients
      completing the 12-week study, a total of 1077 (78%) chose to continue with 12
      months' open-label treatment with tolterodine ER 4 mg once daily, irrespective of
      their previous treatment. Safety was assessed after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months'
      treatment in the study. Efficacy was evaluated from micturition diary variables
      and patients' perception of bladder condition and urgency following 3 and 12
      months' treatment. RESULTS: 71% of patients completed the 12-month study.
      Tolterodine ER was safe and well tolerated. Adverse events of the general
      (14.5%), autonomic (13.2%), gastrointestinal (11.4%), respiratory (9.8%) and
      urinary (9.1%) systems were the most frequently reported. Dry mouth was the most 
      common event, occurring in 12.9% of patients, and was generally mild in severity.
      Other adverse events occurred in less than 5% of patients. There was no increase 
      in the frequency of adverse events with long-term relative to short-term
      treatment. The efficacy of tolterodine was maintained over the 12-month treatment
      period; relative to baseline there were reductions in the number of incontinence 
      episodes per week (median change -83%) and micturitions per 24 hours (median
      change -21%) and an increase in volume voided (median change +25%) after 12
      months' treatment. An improvement in patient perception of their bladder
      condition was found in 75% of patients completing the study, and 51% had an
      improvement in patient perception of urgency. CONCLUSIONS: Tolterodine ER 4mg qd 
      displayed a favourable safety, tolerability and efficacy profile during 12
      months' treatment of patients with overactive bladder.

TI  - Tolterodine: as effective but better tolerated than oxybutynin in Asian patients 
      with symptoms of overactive bladder.
PG  - 247-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: This double-blind, multicenter study compared the efficacy and
      tolerability of tolterodine (Pharmacia, Los Angeles, USA) with that of oxybutynin
      (Alza, Palo Alto, USA) in Asian patients with overactive bladder. METHODS:
      Two-hundred-and-twenty-eight adults with overactive bladder symptoms were
      randomized to receive tolterodine 2 mg twice daily (bid) (n = 112) or oxybutynin 
      5 mg bid (n = 116). After 8 weeks' treatment, changes in micturition diary
      variables, patients' perception of treatment benefit, and tolerability endpoints 
      were determined. RESULTS: The mean (+/- SD) number of micturitions/24 h decreased
      by 2.6 +/- 2.9 (-21%) with tolterodine and 1.8 +/- 4.2 (-15%) with oxybutynin
      (both P = 0.0001 vs baseline). The mean number of incontinence episodes/24 h
      decreased by 2.2 +/- 2.3 (-85%) in the tolterodine group and by 1.4 +/- 1.8
      (-58%) in the oxybutynin group (both P = 0.0001 vs baseline). Patient perception 
      of treatment benefit was over 70% in each treatment group. Adverse events were
      significantly lower in the tolterodine group compared with oxybutynin-treated
      patients (55% vs 82%; P = 0.001). Dry mouth was reported by significantly fewer
      patients on tolterodine, compared with oxybutynin (35% vs 63%; P = 0.001) and
      withdrawals due to adverse events were lower in the tolterodine group than with
      those treated with oxybutynin (10% vs 16%). There were no safety concerns.
      CONCLUSIONS: Tolterodine 2 mg bid is equally or more effective than oxybutynin 5 
      mg bid in the treatment of Asian patients with overactive bladder, and shows
      significantly better tolerability. This may enhance compliance during long-term
      treatment.

TI  - Urinary antispasmodic use and the risks of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden
      death in older patients.
PG  - 117-24
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The introduction of new medications to treat overactive bladder has
      resulted in a significant increase in the number of individuals with this
      condition who use medications for symptoms. Formal epidemiological studies of the
      safety of these medications in typical patient populations are lacking,
      particularly studies of serious events. We sought to determine whether the use of
      urinary antispasmodics increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmias or sudden
      death. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Retrospective analysis of
      data of participants in community, hospital or nursing home setting.
      PARTICIPANTS: Fourteen thousand six hundred thirty-eight subjects with a
      diagnosis of urinary incontinence made between January 1, 1991, and June 30,
      1995; all were aged 65 and older and enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid or the
      Pharmacy Assistance for the Aged and Disabled programs of New Jersey.
      MEASUREMENTS: Filled prescriptions for oxybutynin (Ditropan), flavoxate
      (Urispas), hyoscyamine (Cystospas), and hyoscyamine sulfate (Cystospas-M) were
      used to define days of exposure to these drugs. We also identified all use of
      nonsedating antihistamines and cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors, and their
      concurrent use, to serve as a positive control exposure. Two outcomes were then
      defined: a new diagnosis of ventricular arrhythmia combined with initiation of an
      antiarrhythmic medication and sudden death. Other covariates, including clinical,
      demographic, medication use, and healthcare utilization variables, were also
      assessed. Adjusted risk ratios of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death were
      derived from multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: There was no
      significant association between periods of use of urinary antispasmodics and the 
      development of ventricular arrhythmias (adjusted risk ratio (RR) = 1.23, 95
      confidence interval (CI) = 0.87-1.75) or sudden death (adjusted RR = 0.70, 95% CI
      = 0.28-1.74). A significantly increased risk of ventricular arrhythmia was
      observed for the positive control regimen, concurrent use of nonsedating
      antihistamines and cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (adjusted RR = 5.47; 95% CI =
      1.34-22.26), but not for use of either drug group alone. Concurrent use of
      nonsedating antihistamines and cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors was also associated
      with a significant increase in the risk of sudden death (adjusted RR = 21.50, 95%
      CI = 5.23-88.37). Other variables significantly associated with ventricular
      arrhythmia included ischemic heart disease and congestive heart failure, whereas 
      nursing home use before the index date was associated with a decreased likelihood
      of receiving a diagnosis of and treatment for ventricular arrhythmia. Other
      variables significantly associated with sudden death included male gender, black 
      race, and congestive heart failure. CONCLUSIONS: Antimuscarinic urinary
      antispasmodics available before 1996 were not associated with an increased risk
      of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death. Additional study will be required to
      confirm these results, exclude the possibility of unmeasured confounders
      contributing to any lack of an observed relationship, and extend these findings
      to newer agents such as tolterodine.

TI  - Urodynamic changes associated with behavioral and drug treatment of urge
      incontinence in older women.
PG  - 808-16
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe changes in bladder function and voiding frequency
      associated with behavioral and drug treatment for urge incontinence and to
      examine whether these variables mediate the positive effects of treatment on the 
      frequency of incontinence. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blinded,
      placebo-controlled, clinical trial. Eligible patients were stratified according
      to type of incontinence (urge only vs mixed urge and stress) and severity of
      incontinence (frequency of accidents as documented in bladder diary). SETTING:
      University-based outpatient geriatric medicine clinic. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred 
      five ambulatory, nondemented, community-dwelling women; mean age 67.0 (range
      55-91); 98% white, 2% African American. INTERVENTION: Four sessions (over 8
      weeks) of biofeedback-assisted behavioral training, drug treatment with
      individually-titrated oxybutynin chloride, or a placebo control condition.
      MEASUREMENTS: Two-channel cystometry was performed to determine threshold volumes
      for first desire to void (FDV), strong desire to void (SDV), bladder capacity,
      and the volume at which detrusor instability (DI) or leakage occurred, before
      randomization and after completion of treatment. Two-week bladder diaries were
      used before and after treatment to document episodes of incontinence and voiding 
      frequency. RESULTS: Bladder capacity increased by 68.9 mL in the oxybutynin group
      (P <.001) and 17.3 mL in the behavior group and decreased 6.0 mL in the control
      group. SDV increased 69.9 mL in the oxybutynin group (P <.001), 40.5 in the
      behavior group (P <.05), and 7.8 mL in the control group. FDV increased by 44.4
      mL in the oxybutynin group (P <.001), 18.8 mL in the behavior group, and 8.9 mL
      in the control group. One of seven patients who presented with DI (12.0%)
      resolved in the behavior group, seven of eight (87.5%) resolved in the oxybutynin
      group, and seven of 12 (58.3%) resolved in the control group. These differences
      were not statistically significant. Voiding frequency was significantly reduced
      after treatment in both the behavior and the oxybutynin group. Behavioral
      training resulted in a mean 82.3% reduction in frequency of accidents, oxybutynin
      (final doses 2.5 mg daily to 5 mg three times a day) resulted in a mean 78.3%
      reduction, and the control condition resulted in a mean 51.5% reduction (P
      =.002). Although oxybutynin and behavioral treatment were both effective, and
      oxybutynin increased SDV and bladder capacity, the structural equation modeling
      did not demonstrate that the clinical improvement was mediated through the
      effects of these treatments on urodynamic or voiding frequency measures.
      CONCLUSIONS: Studies using more-complex urodynamics and studies with larger
      sample sizes are needed to better characterize changes in bladder function and
      explore other urodynamic changes that may accompany treatment. In addition, other
      factors, both physiological and behavioral, need to be explored as mechanisms by 
      which conservative therapies improve urge incontinence.

TI  - Efficacy, safety, and tolerability of extended-release once-daily tolterodine
      treatment for overactive bladder in older versus younger patients.
PG  - 799-807
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of a new,
      once-daily extended-release (ER) formulation of tolterodine in treating
      overactive bladder in older (> or =65) and younger (<65) patients. DESIGN: A
      12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. SETTING: An
      international study conducted at 167 medical centers. PARTICIPANTS: One thousand 
      fifteen patients (43.1% aged > or =65) with urge incontinence and urinary
      frequency. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized to treatment with tolterodine
      ER 4 mg once daily (qd) (n = 507) or placebo (n = 508) for 12 weeks.
      MEASUREMENTS: Efficacy, measured with micturition charts (incontinence episodes, 
      micturitions, volume voided per micturition) and subjective patient assessments, 
      safety, and tolerability endpoints were evaluated, relative to placebo, according
      to two age cohorts: younger than 65 and 65 and older. RESULTS: Mean age in the
      older and younger patient cohorts was 74 (range 65-93) and 51 (range 20-64),
      respectively. Compared with placebo, significant improvements in micturition
      chart variables with tolterodine ER showed no age-related differences.
      Irrespective of age, significantly more tolterodine ER recipients than placebo
      recipients reported an improvement in urgency symptoms. After 12 weeks of
      treatment with tolterodine ER, a fivefold increase in the percentage of patients 
      able to finish tasks before voiding in response to urgency was noted in both age 
      groups (<65: from 6.5-32.8%, > or =65: from 5.1-26.2%). Tolterodine ER
      recipients, irrespective of age, also had significant improvements in their
      bladder condition than did placebo recipients. Overall, a greater percentage of
      patients, irrespective of age, perceived any benefit with tolterodine ER than
      with placebo (P <.001). Dry mouth (of any severity) was the most common adverse
      event in both the tolterodine ER and placebo treatment arms, irrespective of age 
      (<65: ER 22.7%, placebo 8.1%; > or =65: ER 24.3%, placebo 7.2%). Few patients
      (<2%) experienced severe dry mouth. No central nervous system, visual, cardiac
      (per electrocardiogram), or laboratory safety concerns were noted. Withdrawal
      rates due to adverse events on tolterodine ER 4 mg qd were comparable in the two 
      age cohorts (<65: 5.5%; > or =65: 5.1%; P =.87). CONCLUSIONS: The new, once-daily
      ER formulation of tolterodine is efficacious, safe, and well tolerated in the
      treatment of patients with symptoms of overactive bladder, irrespective of age.

TI  - A multicenter, prospective, open-label study of tolterodine extended-release 4 mg
      for overactive bladder: the speed of onset of therapeutic assessment trial
      (STAT).
PG  - 616-28
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimuscarinic agents are the primary treatment for overactive
      bladder (OAB), but there is a lack of information regarding when maximum symptom 
      relief and maximum perceived patient benefit occur. OBJECTIVE: This study
      assessed the speed of onset of therapeutic benefit with tolterodine
      extended-release (ER) 4 mg. METHODS: This 12-week, multicenter, prospective,
      open-label study enrolled patients with OAB who either had received no previous
      pharmacologic treatment for OAB (drug naive) or were receiving such treatment at 
      enrollment (previously treated). Efficacy was assessed at 1, 4, and 12 weeks
      using a micturition diary and measures of patients' and physicians' perceptions
      of improvement. Safety was assessed in terms of adverse events and study
      withdrawals. RESULTS: The intent-to-treat population included 1138 patients (302 
      men, 836 women; 88.4% white; age range, 18-91 years), 735 drug naive and 403
      receiving treatment for OAB at enrollment. After 1 week, tolterodine ER 4 mg had 
      produced a significant improvement in all efficacy variables in both groups of
      patients (P < 0.01); 72% of the maximum effect on urge incontinence was observed 
      in both groups; and 84.7% of drug-naive patients and 83.6% of previously treated 
      patients perceived a benefit from treatment. After 4 weeks, drug-naive and
      previously treated patients reported a respective 93% and 100% of the maximum
      effect on episodes of urge incontinence. Tolterodine was well tolerated, with dry
      mouth (mostly mild) the most commonly reported adverse event (15.5% in each
      group). The 330 (81.9%) patients who had reported unacceptable efficacy and the
      87 (21.6%) patients who had reported unacceptable tolerability of previous OAB
      treatment responded favorably to tolterodine ER 4 mg. CONCLUSIONS: Tolterodine ER
      4 mg was effective and well tolerated in both drug-naive and previously treated
      patients with OAB. More than 80% of patients reported benefit from treatment
      after 1 week, but maximum symptom relief was achieved with longer treatment.

TI  - Safety profile of tolterodine as used in general practice in England: results of 
      prescription-event monitoring.
PG  - 703-13
AB  - BACKGROUND: Unstable bladder symptoms are a common problem in general practice.
      Drug therapy with anticholinergic drugs is frequently used in the management of
      this condition. However such drugs are associated with a high incidence of
      anticholinergic adverse effects. Tolterodine is a competitive anticholinergic
      agent, selective for the bladder as opposed to the salivary glands. OBJECTIVE: To
      monitor the safety of tolterodine as used in general practice patients in England
      for the treatment of urinary frequency, urgency and incontinence. DESIGN:
      Prospective observational cohort study. Patients and participants: 14,526
      patients [mean age 62.7 (SD 16.4) years; 68.6% female]. METHODS: Patients
      prescribed tolterodine in general practice, soon after the release of the drug in
      the UK, were followed up for a minimum of 6 months using the technique of
      prescription-event monitoring (PEM). RESULTS: The most common adverse events
      reported were dry mouth, headache, malaise, constipation, dyspepsia, nausea and
      vomiting and pain in abdomen. We identified some uncommon events as possible
      adverse drug reactions--notably hallucinations, tachycardia and palpitations. The
      prevalence of these events was compared with that in patient cohorts for other
      drugs on the PEM database. The age- and sex-adjusted relative risk of
      hallucinations on tolterodine compared with 10 drugs of other therapeutic
      classes, and with terodiline, another drug indicated for bladder instability, was
      4.85 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.72 to 8.66] and 1.25 (95% CI 0.62 to 2.53), 
      respectively. There was no significant difference for tachycardia/palpitation in 
      this comparison. CONCLUSIONS: Tolterodine is well tolerated in general practice
      at the recommended daily dose. Hallucinations, tachycardia and palpitations are
      infrequently associated with the drug.

      Ireland. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and seventy-seven older patients (age > or =65
      years) with symptoms of urinary urgency, increased frequency of micturition (> or
      =8 micturitions/24 hours), and/or urge incontinence (> or =1 episode/24 hours).
      INTERVENTION: Tolterodine 1 mg or 2 mg twice daily (bid), or placebo, for 4
      weeks. MEASUREMENTS: Safety and tolerability were evaluated through spontaneously
      reported adverse events, electrocardiogram, and blood pressure measurements.
      Efficacy was assessed using micturition diary variables: mean change from
      baseline in frequency of micturition and number of incontinence episodes/24
      hours. RESULTS: The mean age of the patient population was 75 years. Overall, >
      or =87% of patients completed the study. Neither dosage of tolterodine was
      associated with serious drug-related adverse events during the study. No cardiac 
      arrythmogenic events were noted. Dry mouth (mild to moderate intensity) was the
      most common adverse event in both the placebo and tolterodine treatment groups.
      Three percent of patients in the tolterodine 2 mg bid group discontinued
      treatment because of dry mouth, compared with 2% of placebo-treated patients.
      Compared with placebo, statistically significant decreases in micturition
      frequency were apparent in both tolterodine treatment groups. Furthermore,
      patients treated with tolterodine 2 mg bid had statistically significant
      decreases in urge incontinence episodes/24 hours and increases in volume voided
      per micturition compared with placebo. CONCLUSION: Tolterodine (taken for 4
      weeks) is safe and shows efficacy, particularly at a dosage of 2 mg bid, in the
      treatment of older patients with urinary symptoms attributable to overactive
      bladder.

TI  - A crossover randomized trial of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and
      oxybutynin in patients with detrusor instability.
PG  - 146-9
AB  - PURPOSE: Management of idiopathic detrusor instability is difficult in most
      patients mainly due to the lack of a complete understanding of the
      pathophysiology. Oxybutynin and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation have 
      been used but to our knowledge no direct comparisons have been made. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: Patients with frequency, urgency, urge incontinence and proved
      detrusor instability were studied with urodynamics, quality of life instruments, 
      and frequency and volume charts. Patients were randomized to transcutaneous
      electrical nerve stimulation or oxybutynin. After 6 weeks of treatment, they were
      reassessed and after a washout of 2 weeks, they were started on the second arm of
      treatment and reassessed 6 weeks later. RESULTS: A total of 13 male and 30 female
      patients were studied. Functional capacity had increased and number of voids
      daily had decreased significantly compared with before treatment in both arms (p 
      <0.005). There were significant improvements in symptom specific quality of life 
      measures but no changes were found on the global Short Form 36 (SF-36) quality of
      life questionnaire. The volume to first desire to void and first unstable
      contraction had increased significantly with oxybutynin but not with
      transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. Of 23 patients 7 were stabilized
      with treatment, including 2 with oxybutynin only, 2 with either nerve stimulation
      or oxybutynin and the remaining 3 with only nerve stimulation. Total bladder
      capacity did not change significantly with either treatment but patients noticed 
      side effects more commonly with oxybutynin. CONCLUSIONS: Both treatments clearly 
      improved subjective parameters. However, only oxybutynin showed significant
      improvements in objective urodynamic parameters. Transcutaneous electrical nerve 
      stimulation can be used in patients who cannot take oxybutynin. Further studies
      are needed to show the long-term efficacy and cost analyses of nerve stimulation.

TI  - Treatment of overactive bladder: long-term tolerability and efficacy of
      tolterodine.
PG  - 141-7
AB  - Previously available antimuscarinic therapies for overactive bladder are poorly
      tolerated due to a high incidence of adverse events, notably dry mouth.
      Tolterodine is a bladder-selective, antimuscarinic agent for the treatment of
      frequency, urgency, and urge incontinence that characterize overactive bladder.
      In a 9-month open-label study, the safety, tolerability, and clinical efficacy of
      tolterodine 2 mg twice daily was evaluated in 854 patients with overactive
      bladder symptoms who had completed one of four 12 week randomized, controlled
      trials of tolterodine. Safety and tolerability were assessed in terms of adverse 
      events and clinical/laboratory variables. Efficacy was assessed using micturition
      diaries and patient perception of their bladder condition. In all, 70% of
      patients remained on treatment for 9 months. Dry mouth was the most frequently
      reported adverse event, occurring in 28% of patients (intensity: 19% mild, 7%
      moderate, 2% severe). A total of 9% of patients withdrew due to adverse events.
      Dosage reduction occurred in 13% of patients. Significant improvements (P <
      0.0001) in micturitions per 24 h (-22%), urge incontinence episodes per 24 h
      (-76%) and volume voided per micturition (+22%) were observed after 9 months of
      treatment, with 65% of patients reporting an improvement in perception of their
      bladder problems. The incidence of adverse events and improvements in micturition
      diary variables during open-label treatment were comparable with those observed
      during a 12 week randomized treatment. It was concluded that tolterodine is well 
      tolerated and maintains its clinical efficacy during 9 months of treatment. The
      high proportion of patients remaining on treatment indicates that tolterodine is 
      an effective long-term treatment for overactive bladder.

TI  - Tolterodine: superior tolerability than and comparable efficacy to oxybutynin in 
      individuals 50 years old or older with overactive bladder: a randomized
      controlled trial.
PG  - 1452-6
AB  - PURPOSE: We compared the tolerability and clinical efficacy of tolterodine with
      those of oxybutynin in patients with an overactive bladder using an upward
      oxybutynin dose titration strategy analogous to that used in routine clinical
      practice in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In
      a randomized double-blind trial 378 male and female patients 50 years old or
      older with symptoms of overactive bladder (a urinary frequency of 8 or more voids
      per 24 hours with urgency and/or urge incontinence, that is 1 or more urge
      incontinence episodes per 24 hours) received 10 weeks of treatment with 2 mg.
      tolterodine twice daily/or an initial dose of 2.5 mg. oxybutynin twice daily,
      increasing to 5 mg. twice daily after 2 weeks of treatment. The main outcome
      measures were changes in voiding diary variables combined with detailed
      tolerability-safety assessments. RESULTS: Patients treated with tolterodine had
      significantly fewer adverse events (69% versus 81%, p = 0.01), notably dry mouth 
      (37% versus 61%, p <0.0001), as well as a lower incidence of dose reduction (6%
      versus 25%, p <0.0001) than those in the oxybutynin group. Each agent had
      comparable efficacy for improving urinary symptoms. Tolterodine and oxybutynin
      caused a significant decrease (p = 0.0001) in the mean number of voids per 24
      hours (-1.7 or -15% and -1.7 or -15%, respectively), urge incontinence episodes
      per 24 hours (-1.3 or -54% and -1.8 or -62%, respectively) and mean voided volume
      per void (33 ml. or 22% and 34 ml. or 23%) after 10 weeks of treatment.
      CONCLUSIONS: Tolterodine is as effective as oxybutynin for improving the symptoms
      of overactive bladder but it has superior tolerability. The combination of these 
      qualities makes tolterodine the preferred pharmacological therapy for the
      long-term treatment of this condition.

TI  - Prospective randomized controlled trial of extended-release oxybutynin chloride
      and tolterodine tartrate in the treatment of overactive bladder: results of the
      OBJECT Study.
PG  - 358-63
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and tolerability of extended-release
      oxybutynin chloride and tolterodine tartrate at 12 weeks in participants with
      overactive bladder. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The OBJECT (Overactive Bladder: Judging
      Effective Control and Treatment) study was a prospective, randomized,
      double-blind, parallel-group study conducted between March and October 2000 at 37
      US study sites. Participants who had between 7 and 50 episodes of urge
      incontinence per week and 10 or more voids in 24 hours received extended-release 
      oxybutynin, 10 mg/d, or tolterodine, 2 mg twice daily. The outcome measures were 
      the number of episodes of urge incontinence, total incontinence, and micturition 
      frequency at 12 weeks adjusted for baseline. RESULTS: A total of 315 women and 63
      men were randomized and treated, and 332 participants (276 women, 56 men)
      completed the study. At the end of the study, extended-release oxybutynin was
      significantly more effective than tolterodine in each of the main outcome
      measures: weekly urge incontinence (P=.03), total incontinence (P=.02), and
      micturition frequency episodes (P=.02) adjusted for baseline. Both drugs improved
      symptoms of overactive bladder significantly from baseline to the end of the
      study as assessed by the 3 main outcome measures (P<.001). Dry mouth, the most
      common adverse event, was reported by 28.1% and 33.2% of participants taking
      extended-release oxybutynin and tolterodine, respectively (P=.32). Rates of
      central nervous system and other adverse events were low and similar in both
      groups. CONCLUSIONS: Extended-release oxybutynin was more effective than
      tolterodine as measured by end-of-study urge incontinence, total incontinence,
      and micturition frequency episodes. Both groups had similar rates of dry mouth
      and other adverse events.

TI  - Tolterodine once-daily: superior efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of
      the overactive bladder.
PG  - 414-21
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a new extended-release
      (ER), once-daily, capsule formulation of tolterodine, relative to placebo and the
      existing immediate-release (IR), twice-daily, tablet formulation, for treatment
      of the overactive bladder. METHODS: This was a double-blind, multicenter,
      randomized, placebo-controlled trial. One thousand five hundred twenty-nine
      patients (81% women) with urinary frequency (eight or more micturitions every 24 
      hours) and urge incontinence (five or more episodes per week) were randomized to 
      oral therapy with tolterodine ER 4 mg once daily (n = 507), tolterodine IR 2 mg
      twice daily (n = 514), or placebo (n = 508) for 12 weeks. Efficacy was assessed
      at the end of the treatment period on the basis of the micturition diary
      variables. Tolerability and safety were assessed by evaluating the adverse
      events, electrocardiogram parameters, laboratory values, and treatment
      withdrawals. RESULTS: Tolterodine ER 4 mg once daily (P = 0.0001) and tolterodine
      IR 2 mg twice daily (P = 0.0005) both significantly reduced the mean number of
      urge incontinence episodes per week compared with placebo. The median reduction
      in these episodes as a percentage of the baseline values was 71% for tolterodine 
      ER, 60% for tolterodine IR, and 33% for placebo. The ER formulation was 18% more 
      effective than the IR formulation (P <0.05). Treatment with both formulations of 
      tolterodine was also associated with statistically significant improvements in
      all other micturition diary variables compared with placebo. For both
      formulations, the mean decreases in micturition frequency (P <0.0079) and pad
      usage (P <0.0145) were significant, and the mean volume voided per micturition
      increased (P = 0.0001). The rate of dry mouth (of any severity) was 23% for
      tolterodine ER, 30% for tolterodine IR, and 8% for placebo. The overall dry mouth
      rate for patients taking tolterodine ER was 23% lower than for tolterodine IR (P 
      <0.02), and the rate of severe dry mouth in the ER group was only 1.8%. The rates
      of withdrawal were comparable for the two active groups and the placebo group. No
      safety concerns were noted. CONCLUSIONS: Tolterodine ER 4 mg once daily is
      effective and well tolerated in the treatment of overactive bladder with no
      safety concerns. Tolterodine ER demonstrated an improved efficacy for reducing
      urge incontinence episodes and a lower frequency of dry mouth compared with the
      existing IR twice-daily formulation.

TI  - Neonatal outcome of infants born at 23 weeks' gestation.
PG  - 49-52
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the neonatal outcome in accurately dated 23-week
      deliveries. METHODS: We reviewed the records of consecutive births between 23 0/7
      and 23 6/7 weeks at Brigham & Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, from
      January 1995 to December 1999. Women were excluded if they presented for elective
      termination or had known fetal death or poor dating criteria. Neonatal records
      were abstracted for mortality and short-term morbidity, including the respiratory
      distress syndrome (RDS), intraventricular hemorrhage, chronic lung disease,
      necrotizing enterocolitis, periventricular leukomalacia, and retinopathy of
      prematurity. Survival was defined as discharge from neonatal intensive care.
      RESULTS: Thirty-three singleton pregnancies met criteria for inclusion, 11 of
      whom survived to discharge (survival rate 0.33; 95% CI 0.18, 0.52). More advanced
      gestational age was associated with increased likelihood of survival: 0 of 12 at 
      23 0/7 to 23 2/7 weeks, 4 of 10 at 23 3/7 to 23 4/7 weeks, and 7 of 11 at 23 5/7 
      to 23 6/7 weeks (P =.02). All 11 survivors developed RDS and chronic lung
      disease. One of 11 survivors had necrotizing enterocolitis, and 2 of 11 had
      severe retinopathy of prematurity. One survivor had periventricular leukomalacia 
      on head ultrasonography, compared with 7 of the nonsurvivors who had head
      ultrasonography (P =.03). One survivor developed severe intraventricular
      hemorrhage (grade 3 or 4) compared with 8 of the 12 at-risk nonsurvivors who had 
      head ultrasonography (P =.01). CONCLUSION: About one third of infants delivered
      at 23 weeks' gestation survived to be discharged from neonatal intensive care.
      More advanced gestational age was associated with increased likelihood of
      survival. No neonates survived free of substantial morbidity.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial comparing the efficacy of controlled-release
      oxybutynin tablets (10 mg once daily) with conventional oxybutynin tablets (5 mg 
      twice daily) in patients whose symptoms were stabilized on 5 mg twice daily of
      oxybutynin.
PG  - 793-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of a controlled-release (CR) formulation of
      oxybutynin with that of conventional oxybutynin in patients with detrusor
      instability or detrusor hyper-reflexia whose symptoms were stabilized on
      conventional oral oxybutynin tablets. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study comprised a
      randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial involving 130 patients drawn from 
      15 centres in the UK. The study was of 6 weeks' duration, i.e. 2 weeks of
      screening whilst taking conventional oxybutynin tablets (5 mg twice daily)
      followed by 4 weeks of double-blind treatment with either CR oxybutynin tablets
      (10 mg once daily) or conventional oxybutynin tablets (5 mg twice daily). Outcome
      measures were changes in 24-h frequency and 24-h incontinence episodes recorded
      throughout the study on diary charts. Adverse events were recorded by patients in
      their diary charts and serum concentrations of oxybutynin and its active
      metabolite, N-desethyloxybutynin, were measured at baseline and at completion of 
      the study to detect possible drug accumulation. RESULTS: The treatments did not
      differ significantly in any of the outcome measures. The primary efficacy
      criterion was the daytime continence at completion of the study; 53% and 58% of
      patients were continent on CR and conventional oxybutynin treatments,
      respectively (the 95% confidence interval of the difference in the proportion
      being - 22% to 13%; P = 0.62). The total number of side-effects experienced by
      those patients receiving treatment with the CR formulation was 57% of that for
      patients receiving treatment with conventional oxybutynin. Individual
      side-effects showed a similar distribution within treatment groups. There was no 
      evidence of the accumulation of oxybutynin or N-desethyloxybutynin during the
      multiple dosing of CR or conventional oxybutynin tablets. CONCLUSION: The CR and 
      conventional formulations of oxybutynin did not differ in their efficacy, and the
      CR formulation was associated with fewer side-effects. In addition, CR oxybutynin
      appeared to maintain therapeutic blood levels over the 24 h dosing interval with 
      no accumulation of oxybutynin or its active metabolite. Once-daily dosing with a 
      CR tablet is seen as convenient for the patient and is expected to result in
      improved compliance in patients already stabilized on conventional oxybutynin
      treatment.

TI  - Dry mouth with conventional and controlled-release oxybutynin in urinary
      incontinence. The Ditropan XL Study Group.
PG  - 718-21
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of controlled-release oxybutynin
      with conventional, immediate-release oxybutynin and determine rates of dry mouth.
      METHODS: Patients (n = 226) who were known to be responsive to anticholinergic
      therapy and who had seven or more urge incontinence episodes per week were
      randomized to receive controlled-release oxybutynin or immediate-release
      oxybutynin. After an initial placebo run-in period, dosing in each began at 5 mg 
      per day and increased weekly by 5 mg per day to a maximum of 20 mg per day or
      when a balance between improvement of incontinence symptoms and tolerability of
      side effects was achieved. Rates of urge incontinence and dry mouth were
      compared. Post hoc Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to describe
      elimination of incontinence episodes by dose and to analyze dry mouth risk by
      dose. RESULTS: Reductions in urge urinary incontinence episodes from baseline to 
      the end of treatment were 18.6 to 2.9 per week (83% mean decrease) and 19.8 to
      4.4 per week (76% mean decrease) in the controlled- and immediate-release
      oxybutynin groups (P =.36), respectively. At equal doses, comparable proportions 
      of patients in both groups reported the absence of urge incontinence (P =.85).
      The incidence of dry mouth increased with dose in both groups, but there was no
      difference in dry mouth rates between the groups: 47.7% and 59.1% for the
      controlled- and immediate-release oxybutynin (P =.09), respectively. However,
      Kaplan-Meier analysis to examine first report of dry mouth at a given dose
      revealed that a significantly lower proportion of patients taking
      controlled-release oxybutynin had moderate to severe dry mouth (P =.007) or any
      dry mouth (P =.003) compared with those taking immediate-release oxybutynin.
      CONCLUSION: At the same daily dose, controlled- and immediate-release oxybutynin 
      demonstrated comparable efficacy in reduction of urge incontinence episodes. The 
      incidence of dry mouth was dose dependent but equal in both groups; first report 
      of moderate to severe dry mouth was significantly lower in the controlled-release
      group.

TI  - Immediate-release oxybutynin versus tolterodine in detrusor overactivity: a
      population analysis.
PG  - 470-5
AB  - We evaluated adherence to treatment with immediate-release (IR) oxybutynin (515
      patients) and tolterodine (505 patients) for detrusor overactivity through
      retrospective analysis of a pharmacy claims database. Outcomes included
      percentage of patients continuing therapy for 6 months, medication possession
      ratios, and time to discontinuation of therapy. The proportion of patients
      continuing therapy for 6 months was statistically superior for tolterodine (32%) 
      compared with IR oxybutynin (22%, p<0.001). Medication possession ratios were
      also superior for patients in the tolterodine group (medians 0.83 and 0.64,
      ranges 0.11-1.15 and 0.07-1.13, respectively, p<0.001). Oxybutynin was
      discontinued significantly earlier (mean 45 days) than tolterodine (mean 59 days,
      p<0.001) and was switched to another therapy more commonly than tolterodine (19% 
      and 14%, respectively). Tolterodine was favored over oxybutynin for several
      measurements of patient adherence. However, less than one-third of patients
      continued therapy with either agent for 6 months. The clinical relevance of these
      differences is unknown.

TI  - Efficacy of trospium chloride in patients with detrusor instability: a
      placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, multicentre clinical trial.
PG  - 659-64
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of trospium chloride (TCl, 20 mg
      twice daily) in the treatment of detrusor instability, compared with placebo.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, 208 patients were allocated at random to either TCl
      or placebo in a double-blind clinical study; the patients were treated for 3
      weeks. Urodynamic values were measured at the beginning and end of the treatment 
      period. Adverse events were recorded on patient diary cards. A confirmatory
      adaptive procedure with one planned interim analysis was used to evaluate
      efficacy. RESULTS: Trospium chloride produced significant improvements in maximum
      cystometric bladder capacity (median treatment effect 22.0 mL, mean 37.3 mL,
      one-sided P = 0. 0054) and urinary volume at first unstable contraction (median
      treatment effect 45.0 mL, mean 63.6 mL, one-sided P = 0.0015). The patients'
      assessment of efficacy showed significantly greater clinical improvement in the
      TCl group than in the placebo group (two-sided P = 0.0047). Furthermore, TCl was 
      well tolerated, with similar frequencies of adverse events reported in both
      groups (68% in the TCl and 62% in the placebo group). CONCLUSION: Trospium
      chloride (20 mg twice daily) is an effective and safe option for the treatment of
      detrusor instability.

TI  - Pregnancy outcomes in healthy nulliparas who developed hypertension. Calcium for 
      Preeclampsia Prevention Study Group.
PG  - 24-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine maternal and perinatal outcomes in nulliparas with
      pregnancy-associated hypertension or preeclampsia. METHODS: We conducted (and
      reported elsewhere) a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial calcium
      supplementation of 4589 healthy nulliparas assigned at 13-21 weeks' gestation.
      This well-defined and characterized data set provided an opportunity to detail
      more precisely adverse maternal, fetal, and newborn outcomes in women who
      developed hypertension among a prospective series of healthy nulliparas. RESULTS:
      Of 4302 women observed to or beyond 20 weeks' gestation, 1073 (24.9%) developed
      mild or severe pregnancy-associated hypertension or preeclampsia. One hundred
      sixteen women of the 1073 with hypertension (10.8%) and 336 of the 3229 without
      hypertension (10.4%) were delivered before 37 weeks' gestation. Fetal and
      neonatal mortality were similar in those groups; however, selected maternal and
      newborn morbidities were significantly greater in women with hypertension.
      Significantly increased maternal morbidities included increased cesarean
      deliveries, abruptio placentae, and acute renal dysfunction; and significantly
      increased perinatal morbidities included respiratory distress syndrome,
      ventilatory support, and fetal growth restriction. Adverse outcomes were highest 
      in women with severe pregnancy-associated hypertension or preeclampsia.
      CONCLUSION: Hypertension, especially severe hypertension, was associated with an 
      appreciable increase in important maternal and perinatal morbidity but not
      perinatal mortality.

TI  - Ketoconazole inhibits the metabolism of tolterodine in subjects with deficient
      CYP2D6 activity.
PG  - 564-72
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the pharmacokinetics and safety of tolterodine and
      tolterodine metabolites after single-and multiple-dose administration in the
      absence and presence of ketoconazole, an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, 
      in healthy volunteers with deficient CYP2D6 activity, i.e. poor metabolisers of
      debrisoquine. METHODS: Eight healthy volunteers received single oral doses (2 mg)
      of tolterodine l-tartrate. Following a wash-out period of about 3 months, six of 
      the subjects participated in a multiple-dose (1 mg twice daily) phase of the
      study. Ketoconazole 200 mg was given once daily for 4-4.5 days during both the
      single and multiple dose tolterodine administration phases. Blood samples were
      drawn and the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine and its metabolites were
      determined. RESULTS: A decrease (P<0.01) in apparent oral clearance of
      tolterodine, from 10- 12 l h-1 to 4.3-4.7 l h-1, was obtained during concomitant 
      administration of ketoconazole, yielding at least a two-fold increase in the area
      under the serum concentration-time curve after single as well as after multiple
      doses following single dose administration of tolterodine. The mean (+/-s.d.)
      terminal half-life increased by 50% from 9.7+/-2.7 h to 15+/-5.4 h in the
      presence of ketoconazole. CONCLUSIONS: CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in the
      elimination of tolterodine in individuals with deficient CYP2D6 activity (poor
      metabolisers), since oral clearance of tolterodine decreased by 60% during
      ketoconazole coadministration. This inhibition resulted in 2.1-fold increase in
      AUC.

TI  - Fluoxetine inhibits the metabolism of tolterodine-pharmacokinetic implications
      and proposed clinical relevance.
PG  - 553-63
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the change in disposition of tolterodine during
      coadministration of the potent cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) inhibitor fluoxetine.
      METHODS: Thirteen patients received tolterodine l-tartrate 2 mg twice daily for
      2.5 days, followed by fluoxetine 20 mg once daily for 3 weeks and then
      concomitant administration for an additional 2.5 days. They were characterized as
      extensive metabolizers (EM1 with one functional CYP2D6 gene, EM2 with two
      functional genes) or poor metabolizers (PM). RESULTS: Nine patients, three EM2
      and four EM1 and two PM, completed the trial. Following tolterodine
      administration, the area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) of
      tolterodine was 4.4-times and 30-times higher among EM1 and PM, respectively,
      compared with EM2. The AUC of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite (5-HM) was not
      quantifiable in PM. Fluoxetine significantly decreased (P<0.002) the oral
      clearance of tolterodine by 93% in EM2 and by 80% in EM1. The AUC of 5-HM
      increased in EM2 and decreased in EM1. However, the exposure to the active moiety
      (unbound tolterodine +5-HM) was not significantly increased in the two
      phenotypes. The subdivision of the EM group showed a 2.1-fold increase in active 
      moiety in EM2 but the exposure was still similar to EM1 compared with before the 
      interaction. CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests a difference in the pharmacokinetics
      of tolterodine and its 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite depending on the number of
      functional CYP2D6 genes. Fluoxetine significantly inhibited the hydroxylation of 
      tolterodine. Despite the effect on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine in
      extensive metabolizers, the clinical effect is expected to be within normal
      variation.

      patients with overactive bladder.
PG  - 283-9
AB  - This study compared the clinical efficacy (determined from micturition diaries)
      and safety of 12 weeks' treatment with either tolterodine 2 mg twice daily,
      oxybutynin 5 mg three times daily or placebo in patients with an overactive
      bladder. A total of 277 patients were randomized and treated at 25 centers. Both 
      tolterodine and oxybutynin significantly increased volume voided/micturition
      compared to placebo. Both treatment groups evoked greater decreases in
      micturitions per 24 hours and incontinence episodes per 24 hours compared to
      placebo; however, only tolterodine was significantly better than placebo in
      reducing micturition frequency. Tolterodine and oxybutynin were equivalent in
      their effectiveness. Tolterodine was significantly better tolerated than
      oxybutynin when adverse events (particularly frequency and intensity of dry
      mouth), dose reduction and patient withdrawals were considered. Oxybutynin is an 
      effective drug whose frequent adverse effects limit its clinical usefulness.
      Tolterodine has equivalent efficacy to oxybutynin, but with less severe adverse
      effects. This will allow patients to receive more effective treatment for their
      condition, with better compliance.

TI  - A placebo-controlled, multicentre study comparing the tolerability and efficacy
      of propiverine and oxybutynin in patients with urgency and urge incontinence.
PG  - 646-51
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the tolerability and efficacy of propiverine and oxybutynin 
      in patients with urgency and urge incontinence in a randomized, double-blind
      placebo-controlled clinical trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, 366 patients
      (149 on propiverine, 145 oxybutynin and 72 placebo, ratio 2:2:1) with urgency and
      urge incontinence were recruited in 32 study centres. Propiverine (group 1, 15 mg
      three times daily), oxybutynin (group 2, 5 mg twice daily) or placebo (group 3)
      were administered for 4 weeks, using the double-dummy technique. The dosages were
      selected specifically to compare the tolerability profile of propiverine with the
      commonly used therapeutic dosage of oxybutynin. Tolerability was assessed by
      directly questioning the patients about adverse events at four visits (V-1 before
      and V0 after a 1-week 'washout' period, V1 after 1 week and V4 after 4 weeks of
      treatment) during a 5-week surveillance period, and by tolerability ratings of
      the physicians. Efficacy was assessed using urodynamics at V0 and V4, evaluating 
      the cystometric bladder capacity at maximal and first desire to void, and
      postvoid residual urine, according to the criteria of the International
      Continence Society. Additionally, a voiding protocol, overall assessment of
      clinical symptomatology and efficacy ratings by the physicians were documented.
      RESULTS: A remarkably high percentage of adverse events was reported in the
      washout period (VO: 13%, 16% and 18% in groups 1-3, respectively). At V4, the
      clinically most relevant symptom (dry mouth) occurred in 53% of patients in group
      1, in 67% of group 2 and in 28% of group 3. Furthermore, dry mouth was less
      severe in group 1 than group 2. In contrast to groups 2 and 3, only patients in
      group 1 showed increasing tolerability during the treatment (from V1 to V4).
      These tolerability results were further supported by the overall tolerability
      assessment ('very good' or 'good' tolerability in 67% of group 1, in 59% of group
      2 and in 83% of group 3). The urodynamic assessment of efficacy (comparing V0 and
      V4) showed a statistically significant increase in the mean (sd) maximal
      cystometric bladder capacity in group 1, being 222 (77) mL at V0 and 311 (125) mL
      at V4, an increase of 89 (108) mL, and in group 2, at 226 (75) mL and 322 (123)
      mL, an increase of 96 (106) mL, compared with group 3, at 211 (77) mL and 263
      (93) mL, an increase of only 52 (92) mL. The cystometric bladder capacity at
      first desire to void also increased in group 1 (93 to 160 mL) and group 2 (89 to 
      160 mL), whereas in group 3 there were only minor changes (93 to 120 mL). Changes
      in the residual urine volume within and between the treatment groups were minimal
      and clinically irrelevant. The overall assessment of efficacy showed significant 
      differences between the drugs when compared with placebo. CONCLUSION: Propiverine
      is a safe and effective drug in the treatment of urgency and urge incontinence;
      it is as effective as oxybutynin, but the incidence of dry mouth and its severity
      is less with propiverine than with oxybutynin. The availability of alternative
      pharmacotherapeutics such as propiverine should reduce the therapeutic failure
      rate and improves the success rate in the treatment of patients suffering from
      urgency and urge incontinence.

TI  - Evaluation of a new once-daily formulation of oxbutynin for the treatment of
      urinary urge incontinence. Ditropan XL Study Group.
PG  - 420-3
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate in a 1 6-center, single-treatment study once-daily
      controlled-release oxybutynin (Ditropan XL) for urinary urge incontinence.
      METHODS: Two hundred fifty-six participants with urge incontinence or mixed
      incontinence with a significant urge component were treated. After baseline
      measurements, participants converting from conventional oxybutynin started
      Ditropan XL at their previous oxybutynin dose; others started at 5 mg/day. Doses 
      were adjusted until participants reached a maintenance dose that produced
      continence or the best balance between continence and side effects. This dose was
      continued for 12 weeks. Effectiveness was assessed by urinary diaries. RESULTS:
      Effectiveness was achieved across all doses studied (5 to 30 mg/day), with 70.8% 
      of participants using maintenance doses of 5 to 15 mg/day. Mean urge incontinence
      episodes per week decreased from 18.8 at baseline to 3.9 in maintenance week 1,
      2.7 in week 4, and 2.8 at the end of the study. For those participants who
      reported urge incontinence episodes at baseline but were free of urge
      incontinence at maintenance week 1, 31% remained free of urge incontinence at
      every subsequent assessment. Participants who converted from other medications
      showed symptomatic improvement after conversion. At some time during the study,
      58.6% of participants reported dry mouth, with 23.0% of participants rating it
      moderate or severe. Only 1.6% of participants discontinued the medication because
      of dry mouth. CONCLUSIONS: Ditropan XL treatment reduced the number of
      incontinence episodes. Maximum benefit was demonstrated by maintenance week 4 and
      was sustained through 12 weeks of maintenance therapy.

TI  - Once daily controlled versus immediate release oxybutynin chloride for urge
      urinary incontinence. OROS Oxybutynin Study Group.
PG  - 1809-12
AB  - PURPOSE: We compared the efficacy and safety of once daily controlled and
      immediate release oxybutynin for incontinence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This
      multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active control, parallel study was
      designed to evaluate urge urinary incontinence episodes using a 7-day diary.
      RESULTS: A total of 97 women and 8 men 34 to 76 years old with urge incontinence 
      or mixed incontinence with a clinically significant urge component were enrolled 
      in the study. The number of weekly urge incontinence episodes decreased from 27.4
      to 4.8 after controlled and from 23.4 to 3.1 after immediate release oxybutynin
      (p = 0.56), and total incontinence episodes decreased from 29.3 to 6 and from
      26.3 to 3.8, respectively (p = 0.6). Weekly urge incontinence episodes from
      baseline to end of study also decreased to 84% after controlled and 88% after
      immediate release oxybutynin (p = 0.7). Continence was achieved in 41% of the
      controlled and 40% of the immediate release group (p = 0.9). Dry mouth of any
      severity was reported by 68 and 87% of the controlled and immediate release
      groups, respectively (p = 0.04), and moderate or severe dry mouth occurred in 25 
      and 46%, respectively (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Participants taking a single daily
      does of controlled release oxybutynin had similar reductions in urge incontinence
      and total incontinence episodes compared to those taking oxybutynin 1 to 4 times 
      daily. A lower incidence of dry mouth was reported for controlled release
      oxybutynin.

TI  - Clinical efficacy and safety of tolterodine compared to placebo in detrusor
      overactivity.
PG  - 1551-5
AB  - PURPOSE: We evaluated the efficacy, patient acceptability and side effect profile
      of tolterodine, a new antimuscarinic agent for treating bladder overactivity.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: In our randomized, placebo controlled, parallel group
      study 123, 129 and 64 patients 18 years old or older with proved detrusor
      overactivity (idiopathic detrusor instability or detrusor hyperreflexia) were
      randomized to receive 1 or 2 mg. tolterodine, or placebo, respectively, twice
      daily for 12 weeks. Main outcome measures were number of voids per 24 hours,
      urine volume per void and episodes of urge incontinence per 24 hours on a
      frequency-volume chart with detailed recording of side effects. RESULTS: After 12
      weeks of treatment mean number of voids per 24 hours plus or minus standard
      deviation decreased from 11.2 +/- 3.1 to 9.0 +/- 2.6 with the 2 mg. dosage (p =
      0.0045 versus placebo). At this dose mean urine volume per void increased from
      155 +/- 52 to 190 +/- 70 ml. (p <0.0001 versus placebo), while mean number of
      incontinence episodes per 24 hours decreased from 3.6 +/- 4.0 to 1.8 +/- 3.1 (p =
      0.19 versus placebo). Similar efficacy was observed in patients receiving the 1
      mg. dose. Severe dry mouth was reported by only 2, 1 and 2% of patients given the
      1 and 2 mg. dose, and placebo, respectively. There was no clinical or
      electrocardiographic evidence of significant cardiac adverse events. CONCLUSIONS:
      Tolterodine administration resulted in a significant decrease in the frequency of
      voiding and improved voided volume but it was seldom associated with troublesome 
      or severe side effects.

TI  - Tolterodine, a new antimuscarinic agent: as effective but better tolerated than
      oxybutynin in patients with an overactive bladder.
PG  - 801-10
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and tolerability of tolterodine with that of
      oxybutynin in patients with an overactive bladder. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multinational
      phase-III study was conducted in urology and gynaecology clinics in the UK,
      Republic of Ireland and Sweden. The study enrolled 293 patients with
      urodynamically confirmed bladder overactivity, increased frequency of micturition
      (> or = micturitions/24 h) and symptoms of urgency and/or urge incontinence (> or
      = 1 episode/24 h). Patients received either tolterodine (2 mg twice daily) or
      oxybutynin (5 mg three times daily) or placebo. Doses could be reduced, to
      prevent withdrawal, to 1 mg or 2.5 mg, respectively. The main outcome measures
      were the mean change from baseline in frequency of micturition/24 h, the number
      of incontinent episodes/24 h and volume voided per micturition. RESULTS: After 12
      weeks' treatment, the mean frequency of micturition decreased by 21% and 19.5% in
      those receiving tolterodine (n = 118) and oxybutynin (n = 118), respectively, and
      by 10.5% in those on placebo (n = 57). Among those with urge incontinence at
      baseline (75% of patients), the mean number of incontinent episodes decreased by 
      47%, 71% and 19%, respectively, in those receiving tolterodine, oxybutynin and
      placebo. The effect of tolterodine and oxybutynin on these two micturition
      variables was statistically equivalent. There was also a comparable increase in
      mean volume voided per micturition in the tolterodine (27%) and oxybutynin groups
      (31%), compared with 7% in the placebo group. Dry mouth was the most common
      adverse event and was reported with greater frequency and intensity among
      patients receiving oxybutynin than among those receiving either tolterodine or
      placebo. In the oxybutynin group, more patients also withdrew because of adverse 
      events and a greater proportion required dose reduction as a result of adverse
      events. Despite dose reduction, the frequency of adverse events and the intensity
      of dry mouth remained higher among those receiving oxybutynin (2.5 mg three times
      daily) than in patients who remained on tolterodine 2 mg twice daily. CONCLUSION:
      Tolterodine 2 mg twice daily is effective and well tolerated in the treatment of 
      bladder overactivity. Tolterodine was better tolerated than oxybutynin,
      particularly with respect to the frequency and intensity of dry mouth, but had
      comparable clinical efficacy. The superior tolerability of tolterodine therefore 
      allows more patients to remain on effective therapy than the current most
      commonly prescribed agent for the treatment of the overactive bladder.

TI  - The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin is unaffected by gender and contraceptive
      steroids.
PG  - 351-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: The effect of gender and concomitant use of contraceptive 
      steroids on the absorption and metabolism of oxybutynin was investigated in 49
      healthy volunteers, 24 females and 25 males. Serum concentrations of oxybutynin
      and its active metabolite, N-desethyloxybutynin, were measured for up to 48 h
      after ingestion of a single dose of 10 mg oxybutynin. RESULTS: Intake of oral
      contraceptive steroids had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetic
      parameters of oxybutynin or its metabolite. Both in males and females, the mean
      area under the curve (AUC0-t) of N-desethyloxybutynin was about 13 times higher
      and the peak concentration (Cmax) 15 to 19 times higher than the AUC0-t and Cmax 
      of the parent oxybutynin, with no significant differences between males and
      females. CONCLUSIONS: The pharmacokinetics of orally administered oxybutynin
      shows a considerable interindividual variability, but is unaffected by gender and
      use of contraceptive steroids.

OAB - PIP: This is a study of the effect of gender and concomitant use of contraceptive
      steroids on the absorption and metabolism of oxybutynin, a commonly used
      anticholinergic agent. 49 healthy volunteers--25 males and 24 females (13 using
      contraceptive steroids)--were given a single dose of 10 mg oxybutynin, which was 
      ingested under standardized conditions. The serum concentrations of oxybutynin
      and its active metabolite, N-desethyloxybutynin, were then measured for up to 48 
      hours after ingestion. Results showed that concomitant use of contraceptive
      steroids had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of
      oxybutynin or its metabolite. Neither was there any significant difference in its
      concentration between the male and female participants. Therefore, the
      pharmacokinetics of orally administered oxybutynin are unaffected by either
      gender or contraceptive steroids.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of tolterodine in patients with detrusor instability: a
      dose-ranging study.
PG  - 42-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and safety of tolterodine, a new
      antimuscarinic agent, and define the optimum dosage in patients with symptoms of 
      detrusor instability (urgency, increased frequency of micturition and/or urge
      incontinence). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      multicentre study was carried out; after a 1-week run-in period to establish
      baseline values, 81 patients were randomized to receive placebo or tolterodine
      0.5, 1, 2 or 4 mg twice daily for 2 weeks. Micturition (diary) variables,
      urodynamics and subjective urinary symptoms were assessed after 2 weeks'
      treatment. RESULTS: A per-protocol analysis of efficacy in 64 patients showed
      dose-related improvements in recorded micturition and urodynamic variables, e.g. 
      at a dosage of 2 mg twice daily, the frequency of micturition, episodes of
      incontinence and pad use were reduced by 20%, 46% and 29%, respectively, while
      the volume at first contraction increased by 89 mL. The 4 mg dosage was
      associated with a large increase in residual urinary volume and an increased
      incidence of dry mouth. The incidence of adverse events (mainly mild or moderate 
      antimuscarinic effects) was comparable with placebo at tolterodine dosages of <
      or = 2 mg. No serious adverse events were observed and tolterodine had no
      clinically significant impact on electrocardiographic or laboratory findings.
      CONCLUSION: The results indicate that tolterodine offers an effective treatment
      for the symptoms of detrusor instability. The optimum dosage appears to be 1-2 mg
      twice daily.

TI  - Identification of medications that cause cognitive impairment in older people:
      the case of oxybutynin chloride.
PG  - 8-13
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cognitive effects of acute challenges with the
      antispasmodic agent oxybutynin hydrochloride in normal older volunteers and to
      compare these effects with those attributable to diphenhydramine, another
      commonly used medication with anticholinergic (muscarinic-blocking) activity.
      DESIGN: A double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study. SETTING: Laboratory 
      evaluations of community subjects. PARTICIPANTS: A convenience sample of 12
      volunteers, average age 69.17 years. INTERVENTION: Baseline assessment was
      followed by randomized administration of a placebo, oxybutynin hydrochloride (5
      and 10 mg), and diphenhydramine hydrochloride (50 mg) in test sessions separated 
      by 1 week. MEASUREMENTS: Evaluation of cognitive performance with a 1-hour
      battery of pencil and paper, interviewer-administered, and computer-administered 
      tests beginning 90 minutes after drug (or placebo) administration. RESULTS:
      Random regression analyses demonstrated that oxybutynin caused significant
      cognitive decrements on seven of 15 cognitive measures, and diphenhydramine
      caused decrements on five measures. The most sensitive measures for detecting the
      effects of oxybutynin hydrochloride were the Buschke Selective Reminding Test and
      Reaction Time. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that oxybutynin can cause 
      cognitive impairment and suggest that physicians prescribing it should monitor
      their patients to facilitate the early recognition of those who experience
      drug-related cognitive deficits. More generally, the findings demonstrate that
      systematic research with normal volunteers can identify cognitive toxicity not
      recognized during the process of drug development or postmarketing surveillance.

PG  - 144-51
AB  - Tolterodine is a new competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist developed for the
      treatment of the unstable bladder. A total of 242 patients were enrolled in a
      multicenter, multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study
      conducted over a period of 4 weeks in patients with detrusor overactivity and
      symptoms of frequency, urgency, and urge incontinence. The objective of the study
      was to compare the efficacy and safety of tolterodine given at 1 or 2 mg b.i.d.
      versus placebo. At week 4 a statistically significant increase in the volume at
      first contraction (p = 0.030) and maximal cystometric capacity (p = 0.034) was
      only in the tolterodine 2 mg b.i.d. group. Tolterodine was safe and generally
      well tolerated. The incidence of dry mouth, as the most commonly reported adverse
      event, was only 9% and of mild to moderate intensity.

TI  - Oxybutynin with bladder retraining for detrusor instability in elderly people: a 
      randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 287-91
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of oxybutynin plus bladder
      training in the treatment of detrusor instability in frail elderly patients
      living independently in the community. It was a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled parallel-group trial of oxybutynin in 57 elderly patients
      (mean age 82.2, SD 6.06), with frequency and incontinence due to detrusor
      instability. After a 2-week run-in period patients received a bladder training
      and drug or placebo for the next 6 weeks. Outcome measures were changes in
      frequency and incontinence, recorded throughout on diary charts, and subjective
      evaluation of symptoms ('better'/'not better', and using a four-point scale
      'cure' to 'no change'). Oxybutynin was superior to placebo in reducing daytime
      frequency [95% confidence interval (CI) of difference in change in frequencies
      totalled over 14 days was -27.0, -6.0; p = 0.003] and in producing subjective
      benefit (at day 29 only), when 24/28 (86%) patients on oxybutynin described
      benefit compared with 16/29 (55%) on placebo (p = 0.02). There was no difference 
      between the groups in reduction of incontinent episodes. The median dose of
      oxybutynin titrated for therapeutic effect was 5 mg/day, and for placebo 10
      mg/day (CI of difference 0.001, 5.001; p = 0.05). Side-effects reported were of
      similar frequency (50%) in the two groups. We conclude that oxybutynin with
      bladder training is superior to bladder training alone in reducing frequency due 
      to detrusor instability in very elderly people living at home.

TI  - Does oxybutynin add to the effectiveness of prompted voiding for urinary
      incontinence among nursing home residents? A placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 610-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if oxybutynin, a bladder relaxant medication, adds to the
      effectiveness of prompted voiding (PV) in the management of urinary incontinence 
      among nursing home residents. DESIGN: Randomized, placebo-controlled,
      double-blinded, dose-adjusted, crossover trial of oxybutynin added along with PV.
      SETTING: Seven nursing homes in Los Angeles County, California. PARTICIPANTS:
      Seventy-five nursing home residents with predominantly urge incontinence, whose
      incontinence did not respond well to a trial of PV. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The
      frequency of incontinence, measured as the percentage of hourly (7 AM to 7 PM)
      physical checks over a 3-day period at which the resident was found wet. RESULTS:
      Sixty-three (84%) of the residents completed the study. Among those completing
      the trial, the percent of checks wet went from 26.5% to 23.7% on placebo to 20.2%
      on active drug. These changes were statistically significant but not clinically
      meaningful. A clinically significant decrease in the frequency of incontinence,
      which we defined as a relative reduction in the percent of checks wet of > 33%,
      occurred in 20 subjects (32%) while on active drug and in 12 subjects (19%) while
      on placebo (P = .48 by chi-square). Twenty-five subjects (40%) met our
      "continence criteria" of an average of one or less wet per day while on active
      drug, and 11 subjects (18%) achieved this goal on placebo (P = .005 by
      chi-square). CONCLUSION: Oxybutynin does not add to the clinical effectiveness of
      PV in the majority of nursing home residents with urge type urinary incontinence.
      Selected residents may, however, become more responsive to PV while on
      oxybutynin. Our data are consistent with other studies of bladder relaxant
      medications in functionally impaired populations. New drugs and/or other
      interventions are needed for the large number of incontinent nursing home
      residents who do not respond well to PV.

TI  - Trospium chloride versus oxybutynin: a randomized, double-blind, multicentre
      trial in the treatment of detrusor hyper-reflexia.
PG  - 452-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare trospium chloride (TCl), a quaternary ammonium derivative
      with atropine-like effects and predominantly antispasmodic activity, with
      oxybutynin (Oxy) in terms of efficacy and adverse effects. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      In a randomized, double-blind, multicentre trial, 95 patients with spinal cord
      injuries and detrusor hyper-reflexia were studied. Treatment consisted of three
      doses per day over a 2 week period, with either Oxy (5 mg three times daily) or
      with TCl (20 mg twice daily) with an additional placebo at midday. The results
      were evaluated with regard to changes in objective (urodynamic) data and
      subjective symptoms as well as the incidence/severity of adverse effects.
      RESULTS: With both drugs there was a significant increase in maximum bladder
      capacity, a significant decrease in maximum voiding detrusor pressure and a
      significant increase in compliance and residual urine; there were no
      statistically significant differences between the treatment groups. The
      percentage of patients who reported severe dryness of the mouth was considerably 
      lower (4%) in those receiving TCl 2 x 20 mg/day than in those receiving Oxy (23%)
      3 x 5 mg/day. Withdrawal from treatment was also less frequent in those receiving
      TCl (6%) than in those receiving Oxy (16%). CONCLUSION: Trospium chloride and
      oxybutynin, judged in terms of objective urodynamic parameters, are of
      substantially equal value as parasympathetic antagonists. However, assessment of 
      tolerance in terms of adverse drug effects showed that TCl had certain
      advantages.

TI  - [The medical treatment of overactive bladder].
PG  - 369-76
AB  - Overactive bladder, very frequent in neurological disorders, leads to very
      distressing symptoms such as urgency, frequency and incontinence which may
      dramatically impair the patient's quality of life. The medical approach is
      essentially pharmacological but the management of the nociceptive factors must
      not be neglected. In the mild urinary dysfunctions, bladder training can be
      advised. The pharmacological treatment aims at reducing the parasympathetic
      activity or at deafferenting the bladder. The antimuscarinic agents are an
      essential part of the treatment. Oxybutynin is the most widely used medication
      but recent agents like tolterodin have a better tolerability. Other drugs can
      also be used such as desmopressin, flavoxate. New molecules are under experiment 
      (darifenacin). In case of troublesome side-effects or resistance to oral
      medications, local treatments are considered. Intravesical oxybutynin has been
      tried but has a short-lived efficacy. Intravesical instillation of capsaicine or 
      resiniferatoxin blocks C-fibres afferents and leads to clinical and urodynamic
      improvement. Recently, injections of botulinum-A toxin in the detrusor have been 
      advocated aiming at blocking the transmission of parasympathetic impulse. The
      first studies report encouraging results. All these local treatments resulting in
      bladder paresis are recommended for patients performing self-catheterization.
      Should these treatments fail, other therapeutic approaches are considered such as
      intrathecal treatment, neuromodulation, before deciding on neurosurgical or
      urosurgical procedures.

TI  - Effectiveness of anticholinergic drugs compared with placebo in the treatment of 
      overactive bladder: systematic review.
PG  - 841-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of anticholinergic drugs for the
      treatment of overactive bladder syndrome. DESIGN: Systematic review of randomised
      controlled trials. DATA SOURCES: Published papers and abstracts. STUDY SELECTION:
      Randomised controlled trials with anticholinergic drug treatment in one arm and
      placebo in another. DATA EXTRACTION: Primary outcomes of interest were patient
      perceived cure or improvement in symptoms, differences in number of incontinent
      episodes and number of voids in 24 hours, and side effects. Secondary outcomes of
      interest were urodynamic measures of bladder function (volume at first
      contraction, maximum cystometric capacity, and residual volume) and adverse
      events. DATA SYNTHESIS: 32 trials were included, totalling 6800 participants.
      Most trials were described as double blind but were variable in other aspects of 
      quality. At the end of treatment, cure or improvement (relative risk 1.41, 95%
      confidence interval 1.29 to 1.54), differences in incontinent episodes in 24
      hours (estimated mean difference 0.6, 0.4 to 0.8), number of voids in 24 hours
      (0.6, 0.4 to 0.8), maximum cystometric capacity (54 ml, 43 ml to 66 ml), and
      volume at first contraction (52 ml, 37 ml to 67 ml), were significantly in favour
      of anticholinergics (P<0.0001 for all). Anticholinergics were associated with
      significantly higher residual volumes (4 ml, 1 ml to 7 ml; P=0.02) and an
      increased rate of dry mouth (relative risk 2.56, 2.24 to 2.92; P<0.0001).
      Sensitivity analysis, although affected by small numbers of studies, showed
      little likelihood of an effect of age, sex, diagnosis, or choice of drug.
      CONCLUSIONS: Although statistically significant, the differences between
      anticholinergic drugs and placebo were small, apart from the increased rate of
      dry mouth in patients receiving active treatment. For many of the outcomes
      studied, the observed difference between anticholinergics and placebo may be of
      questionable clinical significance. None of these studies provided data on long
      term outcome.

TI  - The natural history of the overactive bladder and detrusor overactivity. A review
      of the evidence regarding the long-term outcome of the overactive bladder.
PG  - 843-8
AB  - PURPOSE: The overactive bladder is a widespread medical condition with
      significant impact on quality of life. We review the existing evidence about the 
      prevalence, impact and long-term followup of the overactive bladder. We also
      summarize the new International Continence Society terminology associated with
      the overactive bladder. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A MEDLINE search of all available 
      literature regarding the epidemiology and long-term followup or outcome of the
      overactive bladder was performed. All articles and relevant resources cited in
      those articles were reviewed. RESULTS: The new International Continence Society
      terminology and definitions will allow greater consistency in future research.
      Two large, recently published surveys of the prevalence of overactive bladder
      give new insight into the widespread nature of the problem and its significant
      impact on quality of life. There is little good quality evidence currently
      available on the long-term outcome of overactive bladder. CONCLUSIONS: There is
      little published evidence regarding the natural history of overactive bladder.
      While recent studies have improved understanding the prevalence of the condition,
      we still know little about long-term outcome. The few published studies suggest
      that it is a chronic condition that persists urodynamically and symptomatically.

TI  - Drug therapy of urinary urge incontinence: a systematic review.
PG  - 1003-16
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the efficacy of drug therapy for urinary urge incontinence
      by examining the published literature. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: In October
      1999, we searched the medical databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Controlled 
      Trials Register to identify prospective randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled clinical trials in the English literature evaluating drug
      therapy (except hormonal therapy) of urinary urge incontinence. Trials were
      categorized by type of drug and outcome variables. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND
      RESULTS: Forty-seven trials were identified. Twenty-four, 12, and 11 trials
      evaluated anticholinergic drugs, drugs with anticholinergic and calcium
      antagonistic properties, and alternative regimens, respectively. Data regarding
      treatment effects of anticholinergic drugs are consistent with a high therapeutic
      efficacy and characteristic side effects. Therapeutic efficacy and side effect
      patterns of terodiline, an agent with anticholinergic and calcium antagonistic
      properties, were comparable to those of anticholinergic agents. Terodiline,
      however, has been withdrawn from the market because of its association with
      cardiac arrhythmia. Of the investigated alternative drug regimens, the
      papaverine-like smooth muscle relaxant flavoxate was reported to be ineffective. 
      Studies investigating the dopamine agonist bromocryptine, the alpha-adrenoceptor 
      blocker prazosin, or the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor agonist baclofen showed
      subjective and/or objective improvement of symptoms without reaching statistical 
      significance, whereas the tricyclic antidepressant doxepin, the neurotoxin
      capsaicin, and the prostaglandin synthase inhibitor flurbiprofen led to
      statistically significant subjective and/or objective improvement of symptoms. No
      data for subjective and/or objective improvement of symptoms could be extracted
      from the studies using the anticholinergic and calcium antagonistic agent
      propiverine and the calcium antagonist thiphenamil. CONCLUSION: Published trials 
      support anticholinergic drugs as efficacious therapy for urinary urge
      incontinence, with predictable side effects. At present, these agents represent
      the pharmacological treatment of choice for this condition. The potential value
      of selected alternative drugs is underscored by the available data.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of transdermal oxybutynin in patients with urge and mixed
      urinary incontinence.
PG  - 580-6
AB  - PURPOSE: We evaluated the efficacy and safety of an oxybutynin transdermal
      delivery system (TDS) in a general population of patients with overactive bladder
      and urge or mixed urinary incontinence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following symptom 
      stabilization or treatment withdrawal 520 adult patients were randomized to 12
      weeks of double-blind daily treatment with 1.3, 2.6 or 3.9 mg. oxybutynin TDS or 
      placebo administered twice weekly, followed by a 12-week open-label, dose
      titration period to assess efficacy and safety further. Evaluations included
      patient urinary diaries, incontinence specific quality of life and safety.
      RESULTS: A dose of 3.9 mg. daily oxybutynin TDS significantly reduced the number 
      of weekly incontinence episodes (median change -19.0 versus -14.5, p = 0.0165),
      reduced average daily urinary frequency (mean change -2.3 versus -1.7, p =
      0.0457), increased average voided volume (median change 24 versus 6 ml., p =
      0.0063) and significantly improved quality of life (Incontinence Impact
      Questionnaire total score, p = 0.0327) compared with placebo. Average voided
      volume increased in the daily 2.6 mg. group (19 ml., p = 0.0157) but there were
      no other significant differences between 1.3 and 2.6 mg. oxybutynin TDS and
      placebo. The most common adverse event was application site pruritus (oxybutynin 
      TDS 10.8% to 16.8%, placebo 6.1%). Dry mouth incidence was similar in both groups
      (7.0% versus 8.3%, p not significant). In the open-label period a sustained
      reduction of nearly 3 incontinence episodes per day was reported for all groups. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Doses of 2.6 and 3.9 mg. oxybutynin TDS daily improve overactive
      bladder symptoms and quality of life, and are well tolerated. Transdermal
      oxybutynin is an innovative new treatment for overactive bladder.

TI  - Tolterodine-associated acute mixed liver injury.
PG  - 817-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report a patient with an acute mixed liver injury associated with
      tolterodine therapy. CASE SUMMARY: An 81-year-old white woman with urge
      incontinence experienced malaise, fever, and gastrointestinal disturbances 18
      days after starting tolterodine 2 mg twice daily. The patient's concurrent
      medications included flunitrazepam, diclofenac, and dorzolamide/timolol eye
      drops. Laboratory examination was consistent with the presentation of an acute
      mixed liver injury with increased transaminase enzymes, alkaline phosphatase,
      gamma-glutamyltransferase, and bilirubin. Additionally, she had mild leukocytosis
      with eosinophilia. After tolterodine was discontinued, the abnormal liver and
      hematologic parameters returned to normal within 4 weeks. DISCUSSION:
      Tolterodine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist, has predominantly anticholinergic 
      effects. To our knowledge, this is the first case published describing
      tolterodine-associated acute mixed liver injury. However, some of the patient's
      additional symptoms can also be considered part of a drug-induced
      hypersensitivity syndrome. This is usually defined by the triad of fever,
      cutaneous reaction, and involvement of internal organs, mainly affecting the
      liver. The close temporal relationship between the start of tolterodine therapy
      and the first symptoms and the reversibility after dechallenge led us to conclude
      that the adverse reaction was possibly related to tolterodine exposure.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our case illustrates that tolterodine may rarely be associated with 
      liver injury. This may have been an organ manifestation of tolterodine-induced
      hypersensitivity syndrome.

TI  - Oxybutynin chloride: alterations in drug delivery and improved therapeutic index.
PG  - 443-54
AB  - Oxybutynin chloride (Ditropan, Alza) is widely regarded as the most efficient
      antimuscarinic agent for the treatment of bladder detrusor dysfunction resulting 
      in urinary urgency, frequency and urge incontinence. Oxybutynin metabolism occurs
      primarily in the proximal gastrointestinal tract and the hepatic circulation and 
      is mediated by the cytochrome P450 3A4 isozyme. The major degradation products
      are desethyloxybutynin, which possesses pharmacological activity, and
      phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is metabolically inert. A major limitation
      to long-term compliance with immediate-release oxybutynin remains the necessity
      for twice- or thrice-daily dosing regimens to provide sustained pharmacological
      efficacy. Side effects induced by cytochrome P450 metabolism of oxybutynin into
      the primary metabolite desethyloxybutynin within the gut wall substantially
      affect the tolerability of the compound within the individual. The oral osmotic
      delivery system provides unique advantages for drug delivery and substantially
      alters the tolerability profile of the oxybutynin chloride compound. This
      extended-release formulation consists of a two component core encapsulated by a
      semi-permeable membrane. The osmotic gradient between the surrounding environment
      and the inner core of the delivery system remains constant and water absorption
      within the capsule is controlled by the semipermeable membrane causing a
      controlled release of drug, which is sustained over 24 h. Herein are reviewed the
      various pre- and post-approval trials which have documented the overall
      therapeutic index of the oral osmotic oxybutynin (Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceuticals). 
      Subsequent post-market surveillance issues are reviewed as are new developments
      in oxybutynin delivery.

TI  - The effect of tolterodine on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a
      combination oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel.
PG  - 1876-88
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tolterodine is an antimuscarinic agent for the treatment of
      overactive bladder, a chronic condition that is particularly common in women.
      Given the prevalence pattern of overactive bladder and the widespread use of oral
      contraception, circumstances are likely to arise in which physicians may wish to 
      prescribe tolterodine for patients already taking oral contraceptives. Based on a
      search of MEDLINE from 1990 to 2001, there have been no studies of whether
      concomitant use of these agents entails a risk of drug-drug interaction or
      conception. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the effects of tolterodine on the 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a low-dose combination oral
      contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol 30 microg/levonorgestrel 150 microg). METHODS:
      This was an open-label, randomized, 2-period crossover study in healthy women.
      Oral contraception was given for 21 days either alone or in combination with oral
      tolterodine 2 mg BID (on days 1-14) over two 28-day contraceptive cycles.
      Pharmacokinetic assessments were performed on day 14 based on plasma levels of
      ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel up to 24 hours after dosing and serum
      tolterodine levels at 1 to 3 hours after dosing. The potential for
      pharmacodynamic interaction was assessed in terms of the risk of failure of
      suppression of ovulation based on serum levels of estradiol and progesterone
      measured throughout each cycle. RESULTS: Twenty-four healthy women (age, 23-41
      years [mean, 30 years]; height, 155-178 cm [mean, 167 cm]; body weight, 51-75 kg 
      [mean, 64 kg]) participated in the study. There was no evidence of a
      pharmacokinetic interaction between tolterodine and the steroid hormones in the
      oral contraceptive used, nor did the oral contraceptive show any relevant
      pharmacokinetic interaction with tolterodine. Serum levels of estradiol and
      progesterone indicated suppression of ovulation in both treatment periods.
      CONCLUSION: In this selected population. coadministration of tolterodine did not 
      affect the contraceptive efficacy of a low-dose combination oral contraceptive
      containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel.

TI  - Effect of OROS controlled-release delivery on the pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of oxybutynin chloride.
PG  - 409-17
AB  - Aims : Dry mouth is a common side-effect seen with immediate-release oxybutynin
      (IR-Oxy). Ditropan XL [(Oxy-XL), a controlled-release formulation of oxybutynin
      chloride, is a once-daily oral dosage form that incorporates the OROS technology.
      Dry mouth as the pharmacodynamic measure was compared between Oxy-XL and IR-Oxy
      administration. The steady state stereospecific pharmacokinetics were also
      established for the two formulations and the kinetic-dynamic relationship of
      oxybutynin was examined. METHODS: This was a randomized, repeated-dose,
      double-blind, two-treatment, two-period, crossover study. After a baseline
      assessment day, volunteers were randomly assigned to one of two treatment
      sequences and received 4 days of each treatment with a washout period of 7 days
      between treatments. The treatments were: 1) Oxy-XL 10 mg in the morning and
      placebo 8 h later, and 2) IR-Oxy 5 mg in the morning and again 8 h later.
      Volunteers assessed dry mouth severity subjectively using a 100 mm visual
      analogue scale, VAS (Baseline, treatment days 1 and 4) and objectively by
      collecting saliva (Baseline and treatment day 4) before dosing and every hour
      after the morning dose for approximately 16 h. Several blood samples were
      collected during each treatment, with frequent sampling on day 4 to analyse for
      plasma R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin concentrations.
      RESULTS: Relatively constant plasma concentrations of oxybutynin and its
      metabolite were seen over 24 h following Oxy-XL administration with the degree of
      fluctuation being much lower (P = 0.001; 66% to 81% reduction for the various
      analytes) than IR-Oxy. Compared with IR-Oxy, Oxy-XL yielded higher (131% and 158%
      for the R- and S-isomer, respectively) oxybutynin and lower (62% and 78% for the 
      R- and S-isomer, respectively) desethyloxybutynin bioavailability, suggesting
      reduced first-pass metabolism. Saliva output (area under the effect curve) was
      significantly higher [P = 0.001; 37% (95% confidence interval: 24, 51%)] with
      Oxy-XL than with IR-Oxy and, accordingly, dry mouth severity (VAS) integrated
      over the day was significantly lower with Oxy-XL. The decrease in saliva output
      and the consequent increase in dry mouth severity correlated with the metabolite 
      R-desethyloxybutynin concentration, and no apparent relationship was observed
      with the R-oxybutynin concentration. This suggests that the metabolite may
      contribute to the dry mouth. Therefore, the reduction in metabolite exposure with
      Oxy-XL may be a possible explanation for the observed decrease in dry mouth
      severity with OXY-XL compared with IR-Oxy. CONCLUSIONS: Oxy-XL maintains
      relatively constant plasma drug and metabolite concentrations and minimizes
      first-pass metabolism of oxybutynin. The metabolite appears to contribute to dry 
      mouth associated with oxybutynin, and following Oxy-XL metabolite exposure is
      reduced compared with IR-Oxy. Consequently less dry mouth was observed with
      Oxy-XL as compared with IR-Oxy.

TI  - A short-term, multicenter, randomized double-blind dose titration study of the
      efficacy and anticholinergic side effects of transdermal compared to immediate
      release oral oxybutynin treatment of patients with urge urinary incontinence.
PG  - 140-5
AB  - PURPOSE: We compared the short-term efficacy, safety and tolerability of
      transdermal versus oral oxybutynin in adults with urge urinary incontinence.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Volunteers with detrusor instability currently responding 
      to oral immediate release oxybutynin were enrolled in our study. Those patients
      presenting with recurrence of incontinent symptoms after a 2-week washout
      underwent confirmatory cystometrogram with subsequent randomization to
      transdermal or oral treatment. Matching active and placebo medications included
      matrix patches applied twice weekly and capsules taken 2 or 3 times daily. Dose
      titration was based on anticholinergic symptoms. Outcome measures included
      comparison of baseline to 6 week changes in incontinence episodes on a 3 day
      urinary diary, a visual analog scale for efficacy and anticholinergic symptoms
      reported on a questionnaire. Safety monitoring included adverse events and skin
      tolerability of the transdermal system. RESULTS: A total of 76 patients were
      enrolled and 74 completed at least 4 weeks of treatment. Mean age in the
      transdermal and oral groups was 64 and 63 years, and 87% and 97% were female,
      respectively. Daily incontinent episodes decreased in the transdermal and oral
      groups (7.3 to 2.4 [66%] and 7.4 to 2.6 [72%], respectively, p = 0.39). The
      visual analog scale reduction in urinary leakage improved from washout in both
      groups (p <0.0001) with no difference between them (p = 0.9). Dry mouth occurred 
      in significantly fewer patients in the transdermal (38%) compared with those in
      the oral group (94%, p <0.001). Of the patients in the transdermal group 67%
      noticed a reduction in dry mouth severity compared with previous oral treatment, 
      and 90% had none or mild skin erythema. CONCLUSIONS: Transdermal delivery of
      oxybutynin resulted in comparable efficacy and a significantly improved
      anticholinergic side effect profile compared with oral administration in adults
      with urge urinary incontinence.

TI  - A comparison of the effects on saliva output of oxybutynin chloride and
      tolterodine tartrate.
PG  - 753-60
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oxybutynin chloride and tolterodine tartrate are anticholinergic
      agents used to suppress involuntary bladder contractions in urinary incontinence.
      They act by inhibiting binding of acetylcholine to the muscarinic receptors in
      the detrusor muscle of the bladder. The same types of muscarinic receptors are
      found in the salivary glands; thus anticholinergic agents may decrease saliva
      production and cause dry mouth, a commonly cited reason for discontinuation of
      therapy. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to compare saliva
      output, which is an objective measure of dry mouth, in subjects taking immediate-
      or extended-release oxybutynin, tolterodine, or placebo. METHODS: This was a
      single-site, single-dose, randomized, double-blind, 4-treatment, 4-period
      crossover study. Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment sequences
      that included extended-release oxybutynin 10 mg, tolterodine 2 mg,
      immediate-release oxybutynin 5 mg, and placebo. Saliva output was measured
      objectively before dosing with each treatment and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10,
      and 12 hours after dosing. RESULTS: Thirty-six healthy adult volunteers (22 women
      and 14 men) participated in the study. They ranged in age from 19 to 42 years
      (mean, 27 years). Thirty-one were white, 3 Asian, and 2 black. There were no
      significant differences in predose saliva output between the 4 study groups. With
      placebo, saliva output increased throughout the day. Saliva output was maintained
      at predose levels throughout the day with extended-release oxybutynin. Two hours 
      after dosing with tolterodine and immediate-release oxybutynin, saliva output
      decreased nearly 0.5 g in specimens collected over 2 minutes. All 3 active
      treatments were associated with lower saliva output compared with placebo.
      Extended-release oxybutynin and tolterodine were similar with respect to area
      under the saliva concentration-time curve but were associated with significantly 
      greater saliva output than was immediate-release oxybutynin (P < 0.01). There
      were no serious adverse events (AEs) in this study. AEs were similar between
      treatments, although the incidence of headache was higher in the active-treatment
      groups than with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Objective assessment of saliva output in
      healthy adult volunteers indicated that extended-release oxybutynin and
      tolterodine had less impact on saliva output than did conventional
      immediate-release oxybutynin, suggesting that they may yield lower levels of dry 
      mouth.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the multiple dose pharmacokinetics of a new extended
      release (ER) capsule formulation of tolterodine, compared with the existing
      immediate release (IR) tablet, in healthy volunteers. DESIGN: Nonblind,
      randomised, 2-way crossover trial. PARTICIPANTS: 19 healthy volunteers (7
      females, 12 males), mean age 33 years (range 18 to 55 years). Prior to the study,
      all volunteers were classified as either extensive or poor metabolisers by
      cytochrome P450 2D6 genotyping. METHODS: Volunteers received tolterodine ER 4mg
      once daily or tolterodine IR 2mg twice daily for 6 days (all doses given as the
      L-tartrate salt). A washout period of 7 days separated the 2 treatments. Serum
      concentrations of tolterodine, its active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite (5-HM) and
      the active moiety (extensive metabolisers: sum of unbound tolterodine + 5-HM;
      poor metabolisers: unbound tolterodine) were measured for up to 48 hours
      post-dose on day 6 (steady state). Tolerability was also determined. RESULTS: 17 
      volunteers (13 extensive metabolisers, 4 poor metabolisers) completed the study
      and were evaluable for both treatment periods. The 90% confidence interval for
      the geometric mean ratio of area under the serum concentration-time curve to 24
      hours (AUC24) of the active moiety, for all volunteers combined, indicated
      equivalence for the 2 formulations. Pooled analysis also demonstrated that the
      peak serum concentration (Cmax) of the active moiety following administration of 
      tolterodine ER was around 75% of that observed for the IR tablet, whereas the
      trough concentration was around 1.5-fold higher. Overall, the pharmacokinetics of
      tolterodine (irrespective of genotype) and 5-HM (extensive metabolisers only)
      were consistent with sustained drug release over 24 hours. Tolterodine ER was
      well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: The new once daily ER formulation of tolterodine 4mg
      shows pharmacokinetic equivalence (AUC24) to the existing IR tablet given at a
      dose of 2mg twice daily. Findings of lower Cmax for tolterodine ER may explain
      the significantly lower rate of dry mouth subsequently observed in patients with 
      overactive bladder.

TI  - Oxybutynin does not affect cyclosporin blood levels.
PG  - 155-6
AB  - Cyclosporin is an important immunosuppressive medication used to prevent organ
      rejection. Drug interactions that alter its blood levels can cause serious
      problems with toxicity or transplant rejection. Current evidence indicates that
      both cyclosporin and oxybutynin, which is used to treat bladder dysfunction, are 
      metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A enzyme system, raising the possibility of
      an adverse interaction between these medications. However, a study of two
      children receiving cyclosporin with and without oxybutynin revealed no
      significant changes in trough blood cyclosporin concentrations.

TI  - Food does not influence the pharmacokinetics of a new extended release
      formulation of tolterodine for once daily treatment of patients with overactive
      bladder.
PG  - 135-43
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether food intake influences the pharmacokinetics of a 
      new, once daily, extended release (ER) capsule formulation of tolterodine in
      healthy volunteers, and to compare its bioavailability with that of the existing 
      immediate release (IR) tablet. DESIGN: Open, randomised, 3-way crossover trial.
      PARTICIPANTS: 17 healthy volunteers (3 females, 14 males) aged between 19 and 50 
      years. With the exception of 1 male volunteer, all participants were classified
      as extensive metabolisers by cytochrome P450 2D6 genotyping. METHODS: Volunteers 
      received single oral doses of tolterodine L-tartrate ER 8 mg (2 x 4 mg capsules) 
      on an empty stomach or with a standardised high-fat breakfast. Reference therapy 
      comprised tolterodine L-tartrate IR 4 mg (2 x 2 mg tablets), administered in the 
      fasting state. Serum concentrations of tolterodine, its active 5-hydroxymethyl
      metabolite (5-HM) and the active moiety (sum of unbound tolterodine + 5-HM) were 
      measured for up to 72 hours post-dose. Safety endpoints were also determined.
      RESULTS: No effect of food on the bioavailability of tolterodine ER capsules was 
      apparent and there was no sign of dose-dumping with meals. The geometric mean
      fed:fasting ratio of area under the serum concentration-time curve to infinity
      (AUCinfinity) of the active moiety, for all volunteers combined, was 0.95 (90%
      confidence interval 0.88 to 1.03). Equivalence with respect to AUCinfinity
      (dose-corrected) was also found for the ER capsule compared with the IR tablet,
      although uncorrected maximum serum concentrations were around 50% lower despite
      the fact that the capsule dose was twice as high. Seven volunteers reported
      adverse events, predominantly headache. No volunteer reported dry mouth. Overall,
      there were no safety concerns. CONCLUSIONS: The new ER formulation of tolterodine
      shows no pharmacokinetic interaction with food. On the basis of these results,
      patients with overactive bladder may, therefore, be advised to take the drug

TI  - Food increases the bioavailability of tolterodine but not effective exposure.
PG  - 298-304
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of food on the
      pharmacokinetics of tolterodine, its active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite (5-HM),
      and exposure to the active moiety (sum of unbound tolterodine + 5-HM) in healthy 
      volunteers. Serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HM were measured for up to 
      12 hours after a single oral dose (2 mg) of tolterodine L-tartrate, administered 
      either on an empty stomach or with a standardized medium-fat breakfast. All 23
      subjects completing the study were classified as extensive metabolizers
      (phenotyped with debrisoquine). Pharmacokinetic data on tolterodine and the
      active moiety were evaluable for 22 subjects; all completing subjects were
      evaluable for 5-HM pharmacokinetics. Based on Cmax and AUC(infinity) ratios,
      relative bioavailability of tolterodine in the presence of food was 1.49 (90%
      confidence interval [CI], 1.35-1.71) and 1.53 (1.35-1.72), respectively. The
      pharmacokinetics of 5-HM and the active moiety were unaffected by food, as were
      the rates of drug absorption and terminal half-lives of tolterodine and 5-HM.
      Given that bioequivalence was observed for the active moiety underfed and fasting
      conditions, the authors concluded that coadministration of tolterodine with food 
      is not expected to have any clinically relevant effects.

TI  - Lack of effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of an extended-release oxybutynin 
      formulation.
PG  - 187-92
AB  - The effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of 15 mg oxybutynin XL was evaluated
      in a single-dose, randomized, crossover, open-label study in healthy volunteers. 
      A validated, stereospecific, high-performance liquid chromatography assay was
      used to simultaneously determine the plasma concentrations of R- and S-oxybutynin
      and active metabolite R- and S-desethyloxybutynin. The mean AUC and Cmax values
      for each of the four analytes in the fed treatment were within +/- 20% of the
      fasting treatment values. The 90% confidence intervals for the treatment ratios
      (fed/fasted) for log-transformed Cmax and AUCinf values for the drug isomers and 
      AUCinf values for the metabolite isomers were all within the 80% to 125% range.
      Only the ranges for the Cmax values for R- and S-desethyloxybutynin were slightly
      wider but were well within the 70% to 143% criteria recommended for Cmax when
      comparing effect of food. Lack of effect of food on oxybutynin XL is consistent
      with the previous observation that the osmotically controlled formulations are
      nearly insensitive to the gastrointestinal environment, including food.
      Oxybutynin XL was well tolerated, and the safety results were comparable whether 
      administered alone or with food. In conclusion, oxybutynin XL administration does
      not require any caution to be exercised regarding food.

TI  - Treatment of elderly women with urge incontinence in middle tennessee: a single
      institution practice-based study.
PG  - 457-60
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Urinary urge incontinence (UUI) is a major factor in
      reducing quality of life in elderly women. The treatment of UUI in the elderly
      population is complicated by comorbidities, polypharmacy, cost, and side effects.
      The purpose of this study was to examine our practice pattern in Middle Tennessee
      for the treatment of elderly women with UUI. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed
      the medical records of all women over age 65 seen at our institution between
      January 1, 1998 and September 1, 1999 with an initial complaint of pure UUI.
      Diagnosis was based on history and physical examination by a single urologist
      (JJF). Initial treatment in all patients was medication as well as timed and
      double voids. Medication chosen was based on cost factors, co-morbidities,
      current medications, and outcome from previous treatment. RESULTS: Of 53 women
      ranging in age from 65-87 years of age (avg. 74.7) included in this study, 6/53
      (11.3%) had a previous CVA, and 2/53 (3.7%) had grade I-II cystoceles. Initial
      pharmacologic treatment included anticholinergic medication in 47 patients
      (88.6%), and either imipramine or topical estrogen alone in the remaining 11.4%. 
      Of the anticholinergics, hyoscyamine time capsules were used in 29, tolterodine
      in 7, standard oxybutynin in 5, oxybutynin XL in 1, and a combination with
      imipramine in 5. Thirty-four of the 53 total patients (64.1%) discontinued their 
      medications because of no improvement 14 (41.1%), dry mouth 9 (26.4%), other side
      effects 9 (26.4%), cost 1, and other reasons in the remaining 2 patients. Only 17
      patients (32%) stated they were doing well on their initial medications; 11 of
      those (64.7%) were taking hyoscyamine time capsules. Upon subjective failure,
      22/36 patients (61.1%) had their medications changed, while 14/36 (38.8%) pursued
      behavioral therapy without additional medications. Urodynamic studies were done
      in 12 patients who failed empiric medical treatment (22.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Only
      32% of elderly women treated medically for UUI were satisfied and continued
      therapy in this patient population. One-fourth of elderly women failed empiric
      medical management of UUI due to lack of efficacy, and one-third due to
      intolerable side effects. In this practice, hyoscyamine was continued more often 
      than any other anticholinergic because of reasonable cost, efficacy, and side
      effect profile.

TI  - Tolterodine-warfarin drug interaction.
PG  - 1173-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report two cases of warfarin therapy in which the addition of
      tolterodine resulted in prolonged international normalized ratios (INRs). CASE
      SUMMARY: Two patients, each receiving warfarin for stroke prophylaxis in
      association with chronic atrial fibrillation, developed adverse effects after the
      initiation of tolterodine for urinary disorders. Other medications for concurrent
      medical diagnoses had remained unchanged. One patient had an episode of
      prostatitis, which was treated with levofloxacin immediately prior to tolterodine
      initiation. The warfarin dosage had remained constant for many weeks in both
      patients prior to and during the tolterodine trials. In each patient, the
      initiation of tolterodine was associated with a significant increase in the
      patient's INR measured 10-14 days later. Thus, tolterodine was ineffective in
      both patients and was discontinued one to two days before the elevated INRs were 
      determined during routine clinic visits. INRs determined approximately two weeks 
      after tolterodine was discontinued were similar to those obtained during the
      period before the use of the drug; the warfarin dosage remained unchanged.
      Rechallenge with tolterodine was not attempted in either patient. DISCUSSION:
      Several aspects of the reported cases support the validity of a proposed drug
      interaction when tolterodine is initiated in a patient stabilized on warfarin
      therapy. The temporal association of the course of tolterodine with an elevated
      INR, the return to the previous warfarin dose-INR response relationship after
      tolterodine discontinuation, and the absence of other causes for the elevated INR
      were factors found in both patients. Possible mechanisms to explain the suggested
      drug interaction are explored. CONCLUSIONS: Until further data are available,
      clinicians should be vigilant for a possible drug interaction when tolterodine
      therapy is initiated in a patient maintained on warfarin therapy.

TI  - Tolterodine for overactive bladder: time to onset of action, preferred dosage,
      and 9-month follow-up.
PG  - 67-70
AB  - This is a prospective study of 28 patients who had urinary frequency (>8
      times/day) and either urgency or urge incontinence (>1 time/day). After a 2-week 
      run-in period (visit 1), the patients were started on tolterodine 1 mg twice a
      day (bid) (visit 2). They were followed at 4 and 8 weeks (visits 3 and 4). The
      patients were contacted by telephone 1 week after visit 2. Tolterodine was
      increased to 2 mg bid if the patient had incomplete improvement at either the
      initial phone call or during visit 3. Evaluation criteria were daily micturition 
      charts including urinary frequency, nocturia, leakage episodes, average urine
      volume per day, and average voided volume. Tolterodine was well tolerated without
      side effects in 20 (80%) of 28 patients. Eight patients (20%) dropped out after
      enrollment because of side effects in 3, no improvement in 2, and missing visits 
      (>1) in 3. Drug dosage in the 20 patients who tolerated tolterodine was 1 mg bid 
      in 3 and 2 mg bid in 17 (85%). According to micturition charts, urinary
      frequency, nocturia, and leakage episodes decreased significantly after
      tolterodine treatment, whereas average urine volume per day and average voided
      volume did not change significantly. There were no electrocardiographic or
      biochemical abnormalities due to tolterodine treatment. Mean follow-up was 9.4
      months. All 20 patients who tolerated tolterodine continue to take the medication
      without significant side effects. We conclude that tolterodine is well tolerated 
      and effective for overactive bladders. Two milligrams bid is the dosage preferred
      by the majority of patients and the onset of action is seen within 1 week of
      treatment. Long-term compliance and efficacy are excellent, with no dropout in >9
      months of follow-up.

TI  - Importance of pharmacological and physicochemical properties for tolerance of
      antimuscarinic drugs in the treatment of detrusor instability and detrusor
      hyperreflexia--chances for improvement of therapy.
PG  - 209-18
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimuscarinic side-effects are relatively frequent problems in oral 
      pharmacotherapy of detrusor instability and neurogenic dysfunction of the urinary
      bladder. Results of recent clinical trials demonstrate differences in tolerance
      between antimuscarinic drugs. It is the purpose of this paper to relate the
      available clinical data to the pharmacological and physicochemical properties of 
      the different antimuscarinic drugs, in order to discuss the reasons for this
      enhanced tolerance and to make possible modes for improvement of antimuscarinic
      therapy plainly visible. METHODS: Therefore, we reviewed the available literature
      using among others the computerized library systems Medline (National Library of 
      Medicine, Bethesda, Maryland, USA) and Embase (Excerpta Medica, Amsterdam, the
      Netherlands). Differences in tolerance of oral antimuscarinic drugs may result
      from muscarine-receptor selectivity, organ selectivity, and pharmacokinetic as
      well as physicochemical properties. While the roles of m-receptor and organ
      selectivity need more detailed clarification, influences of differences in
      bioavailability and physicochemical properties on the tolerance of antimuscarinic
      drugs are more sufficiently investigated. RESULTS: Generally, tolerance as well
      as efficacy of antimuscarinic drugs seem to be a complex result of a combination 
      of various pharmacological properties distinguishing the individual substances.
      The enhancement of tolerance of propiverine hydrochloride, tolterodine tartrate
      and trospium chloride compared to oxybutynin chloride seems to be reached by
      different modes, from which the molecular structure -- propiverine and
      tolterodine are tertiary amines, trospium chloride possesses a quarternary
      ammonium structure -- may be of great importance. First investigations with
      alternative transdermal and intravesical application routes show interesting
      possibilities for further improvement of antimuscarinic therapy in urological
      indications. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, from pharmacological and clinical data it
      becomes obvious that there are significant differences between antimuscarinic
      drugs, which are of clinical relevance and include possible starting points for
      the development of new drugs and application forms.

TI  - Urge incontinence. Quality of life and patients' valuation of symptom reduction.
PG  - 531-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have demonstrated the effect of incontinence, and
      urge incontinence in particular, on patients' quality of life. This study
      assessed the effects of urge incontinence on quality of life and measured the
      value of a reduction in symptoms. DESIGN: A self-administered questionnaire was
      mailed to 591 patients with urge or mixed incontinence. 495 (83.8%) surveys were 
      returned with complete quality of life and symptom data. Of the total sample, 411
      patients received the willingness-to-pay (WTP) survey, from which 257 (62.53%)
      returns were judged complete and reliable. Information was collected about the
      number of micturitions and urinary leakages. Health-related quality of life
      (HR-QOL) was measured using the Short Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey.
      Socioeconomic characteristics were also recorded. Value was assessed with a
      binary WTP question. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS: Quality of life among the
      sample population was significantly lower in 5 of 8 dimensions compared with the 
      general US population, and was significantly related to the severity of the
      symptoms in 6 of 8 dimensions. The median (mean) willingness to pay was $US27.24 
      ($US87.74) per month for a 25% reduction in micturitions and leakages, and
      $US75.92 ($US244.54) per month for a 50% reduction in micturitions and leakages. 
      As expected, the willingness to pay was significantly related to the size of the 
      reduction in micturitions and leakages, and household income. CONCLUSIONS:
      Patients with incontinence perceive substantial benefits from a reduction in the 
      number of micturitions and leakages.

TI  - Tolterodine does not affect the human in vivo metabolism of the probe drugs
      caffeine, debrisoquine and omeprazole.
PG  - 145-50
AB  - AIM: To investigate the in vivo effect of treatment with tolterodine on
      debrisoquine 4-hydroxylation (an index of CYP2D6 activity), omeprazole
      5-hydroxylation (CYP2C19), omeprazole sulphoxidation (CYP3A4) and caffeine
      N3-demethylation (CYP1A2). METHODS: Twelve healthy male volunteers (eight
      extensive metabolisers [EMs] and four poor metabolisers [PMs] with respect to
      CYP2D6) received 4 mg tolterodine L-tartrate orally twice daily for 6 days. All
      subjects were EMs with respect to CYP2C19. The subjects received single oral
      doses of debrisoquine (10 mg), omeprazole (20 mg) and caffeine (100 mg) for
      determination of the appropriate metabolic ratios (MR). The drugs were given on
      separate consecutive days, before, during and after the co-administration of
      tolterodine. RESULTS: Mean serum tolterodine concentrations were 5-10 times
      higher in PMs than in EMs. Serum concentrations of the active 5-hydroxymethyl
      metabolite of tolterodine, 5-HM, were not quantifiable in PMs. The mean MR of
      debrisoquine (95% confidence interval) during tolterodine treatment was 0.50
      (0.25-0.99) and did not differ statistically from the values before [0.49
      (0.20-1.2)] and after tolterodine administration [0.46 (0.14-1.6)] in EMs. The
      mean MR of omeprazole hydroxylation and sulphoxidation or caffeine metabolism
      were not changed in the presence of tolterodine in either EMs or PMs.
      Debrisoquine and caffeine had no significant effect on the AUC(1,3 h) of either
      tolterodine or 5-HM, but during omeprazole administration small decreases
      (13-19%) in these parameters were seen. CONCLUSIONS: Tolterodine, administered at
      twice the expected therapeutic dosage, did not change the disposition of the
      probe drugs debrisoquine, omeprazole and caffeine and thus had no detectable
      effect on the activities of CYPs 2D6, 2C19, 3A4 and 1A2. Alteration of the
      metabolism of substrates of these enzymes by tolterodine is unlikely to occur.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of an oral once-a-day controlled-release oxybutynin formulation 
      compared with immediate-release oxybutynin.
PG  - 289-96
AB  - Oxybutynin is used for the treatment of urge urinary incontinence. In this
      randomized, open-label, two-way crossover, multiple-dose study, the
      pharmacokinetics of a once-daily, controlled-release formulation, OROS oxybutynin
      chloride, was compared with that of immediate-release (IR) oxybutynin (Ditropan).
      Thirteen healthy female volunteers received three 5 mg OROS oxybutynin chloride
      tablets once daily for 4 days or IR oxybutynin 5 mg administered every 8 hours
      for 4 days. On day 1, with OROS oxybutynin chloride, mean plasma concentrations
      rose slowly over approximately 6 hours following dosing (mean Cmax 4.2 ng/mL) and
      remained fairly constant over the 24-hour dosing interval, whereas with IR
      oxybutynin, mean plasma concentrations rose rapidly within the first hour after
      dosing (mean Cmax 12.0 ng/mL), then declined. The mean oxybutynin degree of
      fluctuation was much lower for OROS oxybutynin chloride (78%) than for IR
      oxybutynin (371%). For both formulations, the plasma concentration-time profiles 
      for the metabolite N-desethyloxybutynin paralleled those of oxybutynin but at
      higher concentrations. Steady-state oxybutynin concentrations were achieved by
      day 3 for both formulations. Mean area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)
      values for both oxybutynin and its metabolite were similar between day 1 and day 
      4 for each treatment, suggesting time-invariant pharmacokinetics. With OROS
      oxybutynin chloride, mean relative bioavailability was higher (153%) for
      oxybutynin and lower (69%) for N-desethyloxybutynin compared with IR oxybutynin. 
      This increased bioavailability may be due to reduced first-pass metabolism;
      within 3 to 5 hours after dosing, OROS systems are thought to reach the colon,
      where cytochrome P450-mediated oxidation (oxybutynin's primary metabolic pathway)
      may be less extensive than in the small intestine. Fewer subjects reported any
      adverse event with OROS oxybutynin chloride than with IR oxybutynin (including
      dry mouth, oxybutynin's most frequently reported anticholinergic adverse effect).

TI  - Comparative tolerability of drug therapies used to treat incontinence and
      enuresis.
PG  - 123-39
AB  - Drug therapy for incontinence and enuresis has met with varying degrees of
      success. Currently, there is no medication available that specifically targets
      the lower urinary tract without having untoward effects elsewhere in the body.
      Patients with urge incontinence are the most difficult group to treat. The agents
      most commonly used to treat urge incontinence, i.e. anticholinergics,
      musculotropics and tricyclic antidepressants, are limited in their effectiveness 
      and have anticholinergic adverse effects. Other medications with theoretical
      treatment potential such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and calcium
      antagonists require more in depth clinical study before widespread use is
      appropriate. Although estrogen is well tolerated, its role in the treatment of
      incontinence in postmenopausal women may be limited. Medical treatment for stress
      incontinence is most successful in patients with a mild condition. Drugs with
      alpha-adrenergic activity alone or in combination with estrogen in postmenopausal
      women, are fairly effective and demonstrate few adverse effects at doses used to 
      treat stress incontinence. Enuresis pharmacotherapy consists mainly of
      desmopressin and tricyclic antidepressants. Adverse effects are minimal with the 
      doses commonly used. While the majority of patients improve with therapy, a
      significant portion relapse after treatment is terminated. Tolerability of a
      particular therapy depends on the effectiveness and adverse effects of the agent,
      the severity of incontinence and the general health of the patient. In general,
      patients are willing to accept a greater degree of inconvenience if a drug
      produces the desired effect. However, individualisation of therapy should be used
      to maximise compliance and outcome. Blinded, dose-titration studies are needed to
      better determine doses for optimum tolerability. Research into drugs specifically
      targeting the lower urinary tract may lead to more effective and well tolerated
      therapy for incontinence and enuresis.

TI  - Medically recognized urinary incontinence and risks of hospitalization, nursing
      home admission and mortality.
PG  - 367-74
AB  - OBJECTIVES: this study examined the association between medically recognized
      urinary incontinence and risk of several disease conditions, hospitalization,
      nursing home admission and mortality. DESIGN: review and abstraction of medical
      records and computerized data bases from 5986 members, aged 65 years and older,
      of a large health maintenance organization in northern California. RESULTS: there
      was an increased risk of newly recognized urinary incontinence following a
      diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, dementia, stroke, depression and congestive
      heart failure in both men and women, after adjustment for age and cohort. The
      risk of hospitalization was 30% higher in women following the diagnosis of
      incontinence [relative risk (RR) = 1.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.2-1.5]
      and 50% higher in men (RR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.3-1.6) after adjustment for age,
      cohort and co-morbid conditions. The adjusted risk of admission to a nursing
      facility was 2.0 times greater for incontinent women (95% CI = 1.7-2.4) and 3.2
      times greater for incontinent men (95% CI = 2.7-3.8). In contrast, the adjusted
      risk of mortality was only slightly greater for women (RR = 1.1; 95% CI =
      0.99-1.3) and men (RR= 1.2; 95% CI= 1.1-1.4). CONCLUSIONS: urinary incontinence
      increases the risk of hospitalization and substantially increases the risk of
      admission to a nursing home, independently of age, gender and the presence of
      other disease conditions, but has little effect on total mortality.

TI  - The use of salivary stimulant pastilles to improve compliance in women taking
      oxybutynin hydrochloride for detrusor instability: a pilot study.
PG  - 414-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of salivary stimulant pastilles in improving
      tolerance of and compliance with oxybutynin chloride for detrusor instability.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty women with detrusor instability were treated with
      oxybutynin in either a fixed or variable dose. After 3 weeks, patients were given
      salivary stimulant pastilles (Salivix, Thames Laboratories, Clwyd, UK) to chew as
      often as required. Symptom diaries were used to record episodes of dry mouth
      (xerostomia) together with a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) score of the
      severity of xerostomia. RESULTS: The frequency of xerostomia was unchanged but
      there was a significant decrease in median severity from 71 to 39 on the VAS (P <
      0.05, Mann-Whitney U-test). Nine patients on the variable-dose regimen tolerated 
      a higher dose of oxybutynin when taking the pastilles (P < 0.01, Wilcoxon's
      matched-pairs test). CONCLUSION: Salivary stimulant pastilles appear to be a
      useful adjuvant therapy for patients receiving oxybutynin chloride for detrusor
      instability, allowing higher doses of oxybutynin to be tolerated.

TI  - Effect of time interval between food and drug ingestion on the absorption of
      oxybutynin from a controlled-release tablet.
PG  - 31-4
AB  - The effect of time interval between food and drug ingestion on the
      bioavailability of oxybutynin was investigated in a randomized, three-phase
      cross-over study in 31 healthy volunteers. The serum concentrations of oxybutynin
      and the metabolite, N-desethyloxybutynin were measured up to 48 hr after
      ingestion of a controlled-release 10 mg oxybutynin tablet either in fasting
      state, 2 hr after breakfast or 1 hr before. The Cmax of both oxybutynin (P <
      0.0001) and N-desethyloxybutynin (P < 0.0001) and the AUC0-1 of
      N-desethyloxybutynin (P < 0.05) were significantly larger when oxybutynin was
      ingested 2 hr after breakfast, than during the fasting, but the AUC0-1 of
      oxybutynin remained unchanged. Breakfast ingested 1 hr after oxybutynin did not
      affect the pharmacokinetic parameters of oxybutynin or N-desethyloxybutynin. The 
      saliva secretion rate decreased slightly more (P < 0.05), when oxybutynin was
      administered 2 hr after breakfast than during fasting. The effect of food
      ingestion on the serum concentrations of oxybutynin and N-desethyloxybutynin is
      expected to have minor clinical significance only. However, ingestion of the
      controlled-release tablet 1 hr before meal increases the likelihood of obtaining 
      constant drug levels with lower peak concentrations during the dosage interval,
      and thus ingestion of the controlled-release tablet 0.5-1 hr before food may well
      improve tolerability and compliance in patients who suffer from adverse
      reactions.

TI  - Itraconazole moderately increases serum concentrations of oxybutynin but does not
      affect those of the active metabolite.
PG  - 403-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Oxybutynin has low oral bioavailability due to an extensive
      presystemic metabolism. It has been suggested that the biotransformation of
      oxybutynin is dependent on CYP3A. Because itraconazole, a widely used mycotic, is
      a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, we wanted to study a possible interaction between
      oxybutynin and itraconazole. METHODS: In this double-blind, randomized, two-phase
      cross-over study, ten healthy volunteers received either 200 mg itraconazole or
      placebo for 4 days. On day 4, each volunteer ingested a single dose of 5 mg
      oxybutynin. Serum concentrations of oxybutynin, its active metabolite
      N-desethyloxybutynin, and itraconazole were monitored over 24 h. RESULTS:
      Itraconazole significantly increased both the area under the serum drug
      concentration-time curve (AUC0-t) and the peak concentration of oxybutynin
      twofold. The AUC0-t and the peak concentration of N-desethyloxybutynin were not
      significantly affected by itraconazole. Itraconazole did not change the peak time
      or the elimination half-life of either oxybutynin or N-desethyloxybutynin. The
      occurrence of adverse events after oxybutynin administration was not increased by
      itraconazole. CONCLUSIONS: Itraconazole moderately increases serum concentrations
      of oxybutynin, probably by inhibiting the CYP3A-mediated metabolism. However, the
      concentrations of N-desethyloxybutynin were practically unchanged. Since about
      90% of the antimuscarinic activity of oxybutynin is attributable to
      N-desethyloxybutynin, any interaction of oxybutynin with CYP3A4 inhibiting drugs 
      has only minor clinical significance.

PG  - 221-3
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The effect of food on the bioavailability of oxybutynin was assessed
      in a randomised cross-over study in 23 healthy volunteers. A single oral 10 mg
      dose of a controlled release oxybutynin tablet was administered after a high fat 
      breakfast and to fasting subjects. The AUC, Cmax, tmax, t1/2 and MRT of
      oxybutynin and its active metabolite N-desethyloxybutynin were determined.
      RESULTS: Breakfast did not change the AUC of oxybutynin but increased the AUC of 
      N-desethyloxybutynin by about 20%. The Cmax of oxybutynin and
      N-desethyloxybutynin were two-fold higher when the drug was administered after
      breakfast compared to the fasting state. CONCLUSION: Breakfast significantly
      reduced the MRT of oxybutynin and N-desethyloxybutynin.

      hypertrophy: a double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter investigation.
PG  - 205-8
AB  - To investigate the effect of flavoxate (Urispadol) treatment on patients with
      symptomatic benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), with the main weight on the
      irritative symptoms, a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group,
      placebo-controlled and multicenter investigation was carried out. Seventy
      patients entered the study, 37 were allocated to flavoxate treatment on a daily
      dose of 1,200 mg (400 mg t.i.d.) for 12 weeks, and 33 patients were allocated to 
      placebo treatment. In spite of a sufficient power, the study did not discriminate
      the two treatment groups in a statistically significant way (p > 0.05), when
      considering the main endpoints: the irritative symptom score and the global
      patient evaluation. Conservative treatment of micturition disorders accompanying 
      BPH with flavoxate in doses of 1,200 mg/day cannot be recommended for clinical
      use.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics, metabolism, and saliva output during transdermal and
      extended-release oral oxybutynin administration in healthy subjects.
PG  - 696-702
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the pharmacokinetics and adverse effect dynamics of 2
      modified-release oxybutynin treatments. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Between October 15 
      and November 6, 2001, 13 healthy subjects (7 men and 6 women) participated in a
      randomized, 2-way crossover study of transdermal (Oxytrol, 3.9 mg/d) and
      extended-release oral (Ditropan XL, 10 mg) oxybutynin. Multiple blood and saliva 
      samples were collected. Pharmacokinetic parameters and total salivary output were
      assessed. Statistical analyses included 95% confidence intervals, paired t test, 
      analysis of variance, and linear regression. RESULTS: Steady-state plasma
      concentrations were achieved after the first transdermal application and after
      the second extended-release oral dose. Mean +/- SD 24-hour oxybutynin areas under
      the concentration-time curve were comparable during transdermal and oral
      extended-release treatments, 10.8 +/- 24 vs 9.2 +/- 33 ng x h(-1) x mL(-1),
      respectively. However, the ratio of area under the curve
      (N-desethyloxybutynin/oxybutynin) after transdermal administration (1.2 +/- 03)
      was significantly lower (P < .001) than after extended-release oral
      administration (4.1 +/- 0.9). Mean plasma concentrations were less variable
      during transdermal compared with extended-release oral administration. Mean +/-
      SD saliva output was greater during transdermal than extended-release oral
      treatment (15.7 +/- 93 vs 12.2 +/- 6.8 g, respectively; P = .02). Lower
      N-desethyloxybutynin during transdermal application was associated with greater
      saliva output (r = -059, P = .04). No clinically important treatment-related
      adverse effects were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Transdermal oxybutynin administration
      results in greater systemic availability and minimizes metabolism to
      N-desethyloxybutynin compared with extended-release oral administration. Lower
      N-desethyloxybutynin plasma concentration and greater saliva output during
      transdermal treatment correspond to the reported low incidence of dry mouth in
      patients with overactive bladder.

      the extended-release formulations of oxybutynin and tolterodine for overactive
      bladder: results of the OPERA trial.
PG  - 687-95
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and tolerability of extended-release
      formulations of oxybutynin chloride and tolterodine tartrate in women with
      overactive bladder. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The OPERA (Overactive bladder:
      Performance of Extended Release Agents) trial was a randomized, double-blind,
      active-control study performed at 71 US study centers from November 21, 2000, to 
      October 18,2001. Extended-release formulations of oxybutynin at 10 mg/d or
      tolterodine at 4 mg/d were given for 12 weeks to women with 21 to 60 urge urinary
      incontinence (UUI) episodes per week and an average of 10 or more voids per 24
      hours. Episodes of UUI (primary end point), total (urge and nonurge)
      incontinence, and micturition were recorded in 24-hour urinary diaries at
      baseline and at weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 and compared. Adverse events were also
      evaluated. RESULTS: Improvements in weekly UUI episodes were similar for the 790 
      women who received extended-release formulations of oxybutynin (n = 391) or
      tolterodine (n = 399). Oxybutynin was significantly more effective than
      tolterodine in reducing micturition frequency (P = .003), and 23.0% of women
      taking oxybutynin reported no episodes of urinary incontinence compared with
      16.8% of women taking tolterodine (P = .03). Dry mouth, usually mild, was more
      common with oxybutynin (P = .02). Adverse events were generally mild and occurred
      at low rates, with both groups having similar discontinuation of treatment due to
      adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Reductions in weekly UUI and total incontinence
      episodes were similar with extended-release formulations of oxybutynin and
      tolterodine. In the oxybutynin group, micturition frequency was significantly
      lower, and the percentage of women reporting no urinary incontinence episodes was
      significantly higher compared with the tolterodine group. Dry mouth was more
      common with oxybutynin, but tolerability was otherwise comparable, including
      adverse events involving the central nervous system.

TI  - Tolterodine is equally effective in patients with mixed incontinence and those
      with urge incontinence alone.
PG  - 418-21
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy of tolterodine, an antimuscarinic agent with a
      bladder-selective profile, in patients with mixed incontinence (MI, stress and
      urge) compared with patients with urge incontinence (UI) alone. PATIENTS AND
      METHODS: The study included 239 patients with MI (urge predominating) and 755
      with urge incontinence alone from a single-blind, multicentre trial of 1380
      patients (80% female) with an overactive bladder. Those completing the trial were
      analysed 'per-protocol'. After a 7-day washout and a 3-day run-in to collect
      baseline information, patients were treated with tolterodine twice daily for 16
      weeks. The two groups were compared for incontinence episodes/24 h, voiding
      frequency, nocturia episodes and pad usage after 16 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: 
      After 16 weeks the median changes from baseline for all voiding variables were
      statistically significant for the MI and the UI groups (P < 0.001), with no
      apparent significant between-group differences. The median percentage reduction
      in incontinence episodes from baseline was 67% for the MI and 75% for the UI
      groups (P = 0.39). 'Dry' rates for the MI and UI groups at the end of the study
      were 39% (66/171) and 44% (243/552), respectively, whilst 24% of patients in each
      group (MI 40/170; UI 130/551) achieved a voiding pattern of < 8 voids/24 h.
      'Cure' rates for nocturia and the reduction in the number of patients not using
      pads used were also similar between the groups. CONCLUSION: Tolterodine is as
      effective in reducing leakage and other symptoms of an overactive bladder in
      patients with MI as it is in patients with UI alone.

TI  - Comparative efficacy and safety of transdermal oxybutynin and oral tolterodine
      versus placebo in previously treated patients with urge and mixed urinary
      incontinence.
PG  - 237-42
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy and safety of an oxybutynin transdermal
      delivery system (OXY-TDS) and oral, long-acting tolterodine (TOL-LA) with placebo
      in previously treated patients with urge or mixed urinary incontinence. METHODS: 
      After withdrawal of their current antimuscarinic therapy, 361 adult patients were
      randomized to 12 weeks of double-blind, double-dummy treatment with twice weekly 
      OXY-TDS 3.9 mg/day, daily TOL-LA 4 mg, or placebo. Evaluations included change
      from baseline in patient urinary diary symptoms, incontinence-specific quality of
      life, and safety. RESULTS: OXY-TDS 3.9 mg/day and TOL-LA 4 mg/day significantly
      reduced the number of daily incontinence episodes (median change -3 OXY-TDS and
      -3 TOL-LA versus -2 placebo; P <0.05), increased the average void volume (median 
      change 24 and 29 mL versus 5.5 mL, P <0.01), and improved quality of life
      (incontinence impact questionnaire [IIQ] total score, P <0.05; Urogenital
      Distress Inventory Irritative Symptom subscale, P <0.05) compared with placebo.
      The most common adverse event for OXY-TDS was localized application site pruritus
      (14% versus 4% placebo) accompanied by a low incidence of systemic side effects
      (eg, dry mouth 4.1%). Anticholinergic adverse events occurred with greatest
      frequency during TOL-LA treatment (dry mouth 7.3% versus 1.7% placebo, P <0.05). 
      CONCLUSIONS: OXY-TDS and TOL-LA are effective and comparable treatments for
      patients with urge and mixed incontinence. OXY-TDS improves systemic safety with 
      regard to anticholinergic side effects. Local skin irritation occurs in some
      OXY-TDS patients.

TI  - Recent developments in the management of detrusor overactivity.
PG  - 285-91
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Detrusor overactivity is a relatively common yet embarrassing 
      symptom complex with significant impact on quality of life. The mainstay of
      current pharmacological treatment involves use of muscarinic receptor
      antagonists, but their therapeutic efficacy is limited by their troublesome side 
      effects resulting in the non-continuance of treatment in a significant number of 
      patients. Therefore, the development of new drugs can proceed by targeting
      alternative pathways affecting detrusor overactivity. In this article, the
      pharmacological basis for the current therapeutic alternatives for managing
      detrusor overactivity and possible future developments are discussed. RECENT
      FINDINGS: It is clear that far from being a passive container for urine, the
      urothelium is a crucial part of the bladder. Its functions are complex, dynamic
      and important, and only now becoming understood. The release of ATP from
      urothelium in response to distension and its action on P2X receptors resulting in
      activating both motor and sensory neurons is being increasingly recognised. In
      the normal bladder, muscarinic receptor stimulation produces the main part of
      detrusor contraction. However, in functionally abnormal bladders, a
      non-cholinergic activation via the purinergic receptors may occur. The central
      nervous mechanisms controlling the micturition reflex have also recently
      attracted attention. SUMMARY: Recent research has suggested that several
      transmitters may modulate voiding. However, few drugs with clinical benefits have
      been developed so far. Present treatments for overactive bladders have
      significant non-compliance rates. Hopefully, future research will lead to drugs
      with greater therapeutic benefits and better tolerance.

TI  - Effectiveness of vaginally administered oxybutynin on rabbit bladder function.
PG  - 1273-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate the effectiveness of vaginally delivered oxybutynin on
      bladder function. Oxybutynin has been used for treatment of urge urinary
      incontinence for more than 20 years. METHODS: Thirty female New Zealand White
      rabbits were used for this experiment. Each rabbit was anesthetized, and the
      carotid artery was cannulated for blood pressure monitoring. The bladder dome was
      catheterized for both monitoring of bladder pressure and cystometry. After
      initial cystometry, acetylcholine (ACh) was injected into the vesical artery at
      15-minute intervals for 4 hours. Cystometry was performed at the 2-hour mark and 
      at the end of each experiment (4 hours). After the third ACh administration,
      vaginal or oral oxybutynin was given and the effect on the response to ACh, blood
      pressure, and cystometry was observed. RESULTS: The high dose of oxybutynin
      completely inhibited the response to ACh and significantly inhibited the
      micturition reflex. A 45% inhibition of micturition pressure occurred at the
      intermediate dose. Little effect on compliance after the low dose and a
      significant increase in compliance after the mid-dose occurred. Both the low and 
      intermediate doses of oxybutynin reduced the response to ACh to approximately 50%
      of control. No blood pressure effects of vaginal oxybutynin were noted for any
      concentration. Oral oxybutynin showed very similar effects to that of the
      intermediate vaginal dose. CONCLUSIONS: Vaginally delivered oxybutynin was
      effective in decreasing bladder compliance and inhibiting intra-arterial
      ACh-stimulated bladder contractions with little or no effect on the vascular
      effect of ACh.

      Questionnaire in patients with overactive bladder.
PG  - 427-42
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Overactive bladder (OAB) has substantial impact on health-related
      quality of life (HRQoL). The purpose of this research was to evaluate the
      psychometric properties of the King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ). METHODS: The
      KHQ (n = 1284) was administered at baseline and 12 weeks post-treatment in a
      multinational, double-blind, randomized clinical trial of tolterodine for
      treatment of OAB. Country-specific psychometric analyses of HRQoL instruments
      were performed. Countries demonstrating marginal psychometric properties on the
      KHQ were pooled with same-language countries, re-evaluated, and aggregate
      analysis performed on the pooled data. RESULTS: Internal consistency of the KHQ
      was high, item characteristics were good, most assumptions of summed scales were 
      met, and it is externally valid and consistent. Few problems with the KHQ were
      noted although the performance of the personal relationships domain was
      complicated by the 'not applicable' response category. CONCLUSIONS: Psychometric 
      testing supports the reliability and validity of the KHQ as an OAB-specific
      measure of HRQoL.

TI  - Polypharmacy and the elderly.
PG  - 166-9
AB  - Polypharmacy is the concurrent use of several different medications used by the
      same individual, which in some cases can lead to drug-drug interactions. Elderly 
      patients often are faced with polypharmacy when they have multiple disease
      processes. Declining organ function, as part of the normal aging process, adds to
      the problem of adverse drug effects in this population. To minimize polypharmacy,
      prescribers aim to treat multiple disease conditions with a single agent if
      possible. Pharmacists can often help in drug selection, if given a set of
      criteria. This article is intended to help infusion professionals provide safe
      medication treatment by understanding how aging organ systems and medications
      affect the elderly.

TI  - Urinary incontinence. Non-surgical management by family physicians.
PG  - 602-10
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review current evidence on conservative management of urinary
      incontinence (UI) by family physicians. QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: Articles were sought
      through MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CINAHL,
      PsycLit, ERIC, two consensus meetings, and review of abstracts presented at
      urology meetings. References of these articles were searched for relevant trials.
      Strong evidence supports bladder training, pelvic floor exercises, and some
      medications, but only fair evidence supports fluid adjustment, caffeine
      reduction, and stopping smoking. Weight loss and exercise are supported by expert
      opinion only. Consensus opinion is that, whenever possible, conservative
      management should be considered first. MAIN MESSAGE: Good evidence shows that
      initial management by primary care physicians is effective. After basic
      assessment and tests, strategies such as bladder retraining, pelvic floor
      exercises, and lifestyle modifications, augmented by appropriate medications, can
      be successful. If initial strategies are unsuccessful, patients can be referred. 
      CONCLUSION: More than a million Canadians suffer from UI. In almost all cases,
      family physicians are the first health professionals contacted by patients. Basic
      assessment and conservative management can go far to ameliorate the problem.

TI  - Combination treatment with an alpha-blocker plus an anticholinergic for bladder
      outlet obstruction: a prospective, randomized, controlled study.
PG  - 2253-6
AB  - PURPOSE: We evaluate the effect of tolterodine combined with tamsulosin on
      quality of life in patients with bladder outlet obstruction and concomitant
      detrusor instability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 50 consecutive
      patients with urodynamically proven mild or moderate bladder outlet obstruction
      and concomitant detrusor instability. All patients were initially treated with
      0.4 mg. tamsulosin orally once a day. A week later the patients were randomly
      allocated into group 1-25 who continued treatment with tamsulosin only and, group
      2-25 who also received 2 mg. tolterodine orally twice daily. Reevaluation with a 
      quality of life questionnaire and urodynamic study was performed after 3 months. 
      RESULTS: Two patients from group 2 stopped tolterodine while 1 patient from each 
      group stopped tamsulosin because of hypotension. Analysis revealed statistically 
      significant improvement in quality of life scores only in group 2 patients (mean 
      score 525.0 and 628.4 before and after treatment, respectively, 2-sided t test p 
      = 0.0003). A significant difference was noted in both groups after treatment for 
      maximum flow rate and volume at first contraction. Additionally, in group 2, a
      statistically significant difference was observed for maximum detrusor pressure
      and maximum unstable contraction pressure after treatment. CONCLUSIONS:
      Combination treatment with an alpha-blocker (tamsulosin) plus an anticholinergic 
      (tolterodine) improves quality of life in patients with bladder outlet
      obstruction and concomitant detrusor instability. Interestingly, no acute urinary
      retention was observed and tolterodine did not affect the quality of urine flow
      or residual urine volume. The proposed combination appears to be an effective and
      relatively safe treatment option in patients with bladder outlet obstruction and 
      detrusor instability.

TI  - Tolterodine and memory: dry but forgetful.
PG  - 771-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anticholinergic drugs are known to produce or enhance cognitive
      deficits. Tolterodine tartrate is marketed as a bladder-selective anticholinergic
      drug that is reported to be free of significant cognitive adverse effects.
      OBJECTIVE: To describe a 46-year-old woman who had memory loss and abnormal
      memory test results that improved when she discontinued tolterodine therapy.
      RESULTS: While taking tolterodine, the patient's score on the delayed free recall
      portion of the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised was at the first percentile. 
      One month after discontinuing tolterodine therapy, this test was administered a
      second time using an alternative form and she showed marked improvement scoring
      above the 75th percentile. CONCLUSIONS: Tolterodine therapy caused cognitive
      dysfunction in our patient. It is possible that cognitive dysfunction is a common
      result of tolterodine treatment, but in the absence of testing, remains
      undiagnosed. Alternatively, our patient may have had aberrant metabolism of this 
      drug or an increased sensitivity as a result of incipient Alzheimer disease.

TI  - Inappropriate medication use among hospitalized older adults in Italy: results
      from the Italian Group of Pharmacoepidemiology in the Elderly.
PG  - 157-62
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of inappropriate medication use among
      hospitalized older adults and to identify predictors of this use. METHODS: A
      total of 5734 patients (mean age 79 years) admitted to geriatric and internal
      medicine wards participating in the study in 1995 and 1997 were included in this 
      analysis. Inappropriate medication use was defined on the basis of the criteria
      published by Beers in 1997. Only medications used during hospital stay were
      considered for the present study. RESULTS: During hospital stay, 837 (14.6%)
      patients received one or more medications classified as inappropriate based on
      Beers criteria. Ticlopidine ( n=346; 6.0% of the study sample) was the most
      frequently used medication among those in Beers' list, followed by digoxin (
      n=174; 3.0%) and amytriptyline ( n=113; 2.0%). The multivariate analysis showed
      that age [75-84 years vs 65-74 years, odds ratio (OR) 0.85, 95% confidence
      interval (CI) 0.71-1.00; >or=85 years vs 65-74 years, OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.46-0.73],
      cognitive impairment (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.64-0.94), Charlson co-morbidity index
      (>or=2 vs 0-1, OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.02-1.40) and overall number of medications used 
      during hospital stay (5-8 medications vs <5 medications, OR 2.20, 95% CI
      1.72-2.82; >or=9 medications vs <5 medications, OR 3.68, 95% CI 2.86-4.73) were
      significantly associated with use of inappropriate medications. CONCLUSIONS:
      Inappropriate medication use was common among hospitalized older adults. The most
      important determinant of risk of receiving an inappropriate medication was the
      number of drugs being taken. Older age and cognitive impairment were associated
      with a reduced likelihood of using an inappropriate medication.

TI  - Successful hypospadias repair with ventral based vascular dartos pedicle for
      urethral coverage.
PG  - 1825-7; discussion 1827
AB  - PURPOSE: We describe an easy technique to reliably harvest a vascularized dartos 
      pedicle for urethral coverage at the time of urethroplasty in hypospadias
      surgery. The complication of urethrocutaneous fistula in hypospadias surgery as a
      result of using this technique is also evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A
      retrospective review (July 1999 to September 2002) identified 180 pediatric
      patients who had undergone primary hypospadias surgery by a single surgeon. A
      modified technique of harvesting a vascularized dartos pedicle was incorporated
      in 111 hypospadias repairs. A ventral based vascularized dartos pedicle of tissue
      was used to cover a modified urethroplasty as described by Snodgrass. RESULTS:
      The intraoperative meatal position before urethroplasty was subcoronal in 95
      cases, penile/midshaft in 11 and penoscrotal in 5. The majority of patients (90
      of 111) were younger than 12 months at surgery. Ages ranged from 5 months to 16
      years (mean 21.1 months). Of the 111 patients reconstruction using the ventral
      based vascularized dartos pedicle to cover the urethroplasty was successful in
      109 (98.2%), and at followup they have an acceptable cosmetic result with no
      evidence of urethrocutaneous fistula. In 1 patient with distal hypospadias a
      urethrocutaneous fistula developed, which was recognized 20 months
      postoperatively. Another patient with penoscrotal hypospadias had a proximal
      fistula at 6 months. There were no recognized intraoperative urethral injuries or
      complications. Followup ranged from 3 to 38 months (mean 19.1). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      ventral based vascularized dartos pedicle urethral coverage procedure is an easy 
      and reliable technique to harvest adequate vascularized tissue to cover a
      hypospadias urethroplasty. In this small single surgeon series, this technique
      appears to have contributed to a low rate of urethrocutaneous fistulas after
      hypospadias repair.

TI  - Simplified bladder training augments the effectiveness of tolterodine in patients
      with an overactive bladder.
PG  - 54-60
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy of tolterodine plus simplified bladder
      training (BT) with tolterodine alone in patients with an overactive bladder.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a multicentre, single-blind study at 51 Scandinavian
      centres, 505 patients aged >or= 18 years with symptoms of urinary frequency (>or=
      8 micturitions/24 h) and urgency, with or without urge incontinence, were
      randomized to oral treatment with either tolterodine 2 mg twice daily plus
      simplified BT or tolterodine alone. Changes in voiding diary variables were
      evaluated after 2, 12 and 24 weeks of treatment. The patients' perceptions of
      their bladder symptoms and tolerability (adverse events) were also determined.
      RESULTS: In all, 501 patients (75% women) were evaluable on an intention-to-treat
      basis (244 on tolterodine + BT and 257 on tolterodine alone). Tolterodine
      significantly reduced the voiding frequency and increased the volume voided per
      void at all sample times; these effects were significantly increased by adding
      BT. At the end of the study the median percentage reduction in voiding frequency 
      was greater with tolterodine + BT than with tolterodine alone (33% vs 25%, P <
      0.001), while the median percentage increase in volume voided per void was 31%
      with tolterodine + BT and 20% with tolterodine alone (P < 0.001). There was a
      median of 81% fewer incontinence episodes than at baseline with tolterodine
      alone, which was not significantly different from that with tolterodine + BT (-
      87%). The two groups had comparable median percentage reductions in urgency
      episodes. Some 76% of patients on tolterodine + BT reported an improvement in
      their bladder symptoms relative to baseline, compared with 71% on tolterodine
      alone. Tolterodine was well tolerated; the most common adverse event was mild dry
      mouth. CONCLUSION: Tolterodine 2 mg twice daily is an effective and well
      tolerated treatment for an overactive bladder, the effectiveness of which can be 
      augmented by a simplified BT regimen.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and metabolism of transdermal oxybutynin: in vitro and in vivo
      performance of a novel delivery system.
PG  - 103-9
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this work was to characterize in vitro/in vivo delivery
      and pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin (OXY) and its active metabolite.
      N-desethyloxybutynin (DEO), by a novel matrix transdermal system (TDS). METHODS: 
      Two in vivo, randomized, three-way crossover trials examined single/multiple OXY 
      TDS doses. Abdomen, buttock, and hip application sites were compared and dose
      proportionality was evaluated. Model independent pharmacokinetics, elimination
      rate constants, and metabolite/drug ratios were derived from both plasma OXY and 
      DEO concentrations. RESULTS: Single/multiple applications of the OXY TDS to the
      abdomen yielded mean Cmax OXY concentrations of 3.4 +/- 1.1/6.6 +/- 2.4 ng/mL and
      median tmax of 36/10 h, with steady state achieved during the second application.
      Plasma OXY and DEO concentrations decreased gradually after Cmax until system
      removal. Buttock and hip applications resulted in bioequivalent OXY absorption.
      AUC ratios of DEO/OXY were 1.5 +/- 0.4 (single dose) and 1.3 +/- 0.3 (multiple
      dose). Mean in vitro OXY skin absorption (186 microg/h) was comparable to the
      estimated in vivo delivery (163 microg/h) over 96 h. CONCLUSIONS: Sustained
      delivery over 4 days and multiple sites allow a convenient, well-tolerated,
      twice-weekly OXY TDS dosing. A low incidence of anticholinergic side effects is
      expected during clinical use because of the avoidance of presystemic metabolism
      and low DEO plasma concentrations. The consistent delivery, absorption, and
      pharmacokinetics should result in an effective treatment of patients with
      overactive bladder.

TI  - A new once-daily formulation of tolterodine provides superior efficacy and is
      well tolerated in women with overactive bladder.
PG  - 50-4; discussion 54-5
AB  - This study evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of new extended-release (ER)
      tolterodine for the treatment of overactive bladder in women. In this
      subpopulation analysis of a double-blind multicenter trial, 1235 female patients 
      were randomized to oral therapy with tolterodine ER 4 mg once daily (n=417),
      tolterodine IR 2 mg twice daily (n=408) or placebo (n=410) for 12 weeks. Both
      formulations reduced the mean number of urge incontinence episodes per week (both
      P=0.001 vs placebo); tolterodine ER was more effective than tolterodine IR
      (P=0.036). Both formulations significantly improved all other micturition chart
      variables compared to placebo. Dry mouth was the most common adverse event. There
      were no safety concerns. Toltrodine ER 4 mg once daily is effective and well
      tolerated in the treatment of women with overactive bladder, and reduces urge
      incontinence episodes more than the existing IR twice-daily formulation.

TI  - Which stop test is best? Measuring detrusor contractility in older females.
PG  - 1023-7
AB  - PURPOSE: Impaired detrusor contractility has an important role in geriatric
      voiding dysfunction but there are many competing methods of measurement. We
      compared the performance of 3 methods of measuring detrusor contraction strength 
      to identify the best one. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed
      urodynamics data on 84 females 53 years old or older. All had urge incontinence
      and were enrolled in a placebo controlled oxybutynin trial. Stop tests (voluntary
      interruption, mechanical interruption and continuous mechanical occlusion of
      flow) were performed on each subject. RESULTS: At baseline the voluntary stop
      test measured lower mean isovolumetric detrusor pressure +/- SD than the
      mechanical and continuous methods (31.2 +/- 16.0 versus 47.2 +/- 26.5 and 48.7
      +/- 24.4 cm. water, respectively). The latter 2 values also correlated highly (r 
      = 0.87). Followup data on 76 women confirmed these results. Based on baseline and
      followup values in the 20 women who received placebo the continuous occlusion
      test showed highest test-retest reliability (r = 0.9, p <0.01), followed by the
      mechanical (r = 0.69, p = 0.01) and voluntary (r = 0.67, p <0.01) stop tests.
      Treatment with oxybutynin decreased isovolumetric detrusor pressure in all 3 stop
      tests by up to 6 cm. water. However, the decrease was statistically significant
      only for the continuous occlusion test. CONCLUSIONS: To assess detrusor
      contraction strength in elderly females with urge incontinence the mechanical
      stop and continuous occlusion tests are acceptable but the continuous occlusion
      test has better reliability and better detects slight drug induced changes.
      Voluntary stop tests greatly underestimate detrusor isovolumetric pressure and
      should no longer be used.

TI  - Effect of tolterodine on the anticoagulant actions and pharmacokinetics of
      single-dose warfarin in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 890-5
AB  - This randomized, double-blind, crossover study investigated the potential effects
      of tolterodine
      ((R)-N,N-diisopropyl-3-(2-hydroxy-5-methyl-phenyl)-3-phenylpropanamine, CAS
      124937-51-5), an antimuscarinic agent for the treatment of the overactive
      bladder, on the anticoagulant actions and pharmacokinetics of single-dose
      warfarin (CAS 81-81-2) in 20 healthy male volunteers. In terms of study design,
      volunteers randomly received oral tolterodine L-tartrate (2 mg twice daily) or
      matching placebo for 7 days, with a single oral dose of warfarin (25 mg)
      administered on day 4 of each treatment period. R-(+)- and S-(-)-warfarin
      pharmacokinetics were estimated from plasma levels measured up to 96 h post-dose,
      in conjunction with assessment of prothrombin time and factor VII activity.
      Pharmacokinetics of tolterodine and its active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite
      ((R)-N,N-diisopropyl-3-(2-hydroxy-5-hydroxymethyl-phenyl)-3-phenylpropanamine;
      5-HM), in the presence and absence of warfarin, were also determined. Relative to
      placebo, tolterodine had no discernible effect on the anticoagulant actions of
      warfarin. Point estimates of the tolterodine: placebo ratios for prothrombin time
      and factor VII activity were 1.00 (90% confidence interval [CI]: 0.91-1.10) and
      0.91 (90% CI: 0.83-0.99), respectively, consistent with equivalence. No
      clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of R-(+)- and
      S-(-)-warfarin were noted. Serum concentration-time profiles and the
      pharmacokinetics of tolterodine and 5-HM were similar in the presence and absence
      of warfarin. There were no safety concerns. These findings indicate that
      co-administration of tolterodine and warfarin is safe and well tolerated, with no
      clinically significant pharmacodynamic or kinetic interaction in healthy
      volunteers.

TI  - ["New wonder pill!"--what do Norwegian newspapers write].
PG  - 1671-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: The news media are an important source of information on new medical 
      treatments. There is, however growing concern that some of the coverage may be
      inaccurate and overly enthusiastic, thereby misleading the general population.
      METHODS: Eight major Norwegian newspapers were screened for articles on the
      benefits and risks of all the 60 new medications introduced on the Norwegian
      market from July 1998 through March 2000. We found a total of 492 articles
      describing 18 new medications over the period January 1998 through June 2000.
      RESULTS: Of the 357 stories that mentioned benefits, 79% did not report this in
      any greater detail, 51% gave the medication a positive coverage, while 19% used
      overly enthusiastic terms like "wonder pill". 39% of the 492 stories pointed to
      potentially harmful effects of the medication while 27% mentioned costs. 174
      stories cited at least one expert describing the effects of the medication, but
      only four of these stories disclosed financial ties between the expert and the
      manufacturer of the specific drug. Press releases from drug companies were cited 
      twice as often as papers in medical journals. INTERPRETATION: The Norwegian news 
      media usually given new medications an overly enthusiastic coverage, while there 
      is incomplete information about the benefits, risks and costs of the drugs as
      well as about the financial ties between medical experts and the pharmaceutical
      industry.

TI  - Urinary incontinence in nursing homes for older people.
PG  - 12-8
AB  - At least 50% of nursing home residents in Britain and North America suffer from
      urinary incontinence. It is associated with resident and staff morbidity. The
      assessment and management of such residents will depend on the capacity of the
      care staff and the capability of the resident. The minimum data set and resident 
      assessment protocol may have a role in the assessment of incontinent residents.
      Behavioural strategies are more likely to be beneficial than drug treatment.

TI  - Urinary incontinence in the geriatric population.
PG  - 54-61
AB  - BACKGROUND: Urinary incontinence is a widespread, yet potentially treatable,
      problem in the geriatric population. METHODS: We reviewed the geriatric and
      urologic literature to provide an update on the definition, diagnosis, and
      treatment of geriatric urinary incontinence. RESULTS: Urinary incontinence
      affects 15-30% of elderly individuals in the community and 50% of those living in
      nursing homes. Both age and gender affect bladder function, and incontinence
      affects females and males in a ratio of 2:1. Incontinence can be classified as
      urge, stress, overflow, functional, or mixed. There are many reversible causes of
      incontinence, and a thorough history and physical examination, including a
      complete voiding history and a tailored neuro-urologic examination, are required 
      for accurate diagnosis. Treatment options include behavioral modification,
      medical therapy with anticholinergics or hormone replacement, and surgical
      intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Urinary incontinence, due to many causes, is a
      widespread problem among the elderly. Yet many of these causes are reversible
      with appropriate treatment, often by the primary care provider. Some patients may
      require urologic referral for sophisticated urodynamic studies and possible
      surgical intervention, in select cases.

TI  - Influences on GPs' decision to prescribe new drugs-the importance of who says
      what.
PG  - 61-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to understand the range of factors that
      influence GPs' uptake of new drugs METHODS: A total of 107 GPs selected
      purposively from high, medium and low new drug prescribing practices in two
      health authorities in the north west of England were interviewed using the
      critical incident technique with semi-structured interviews. Interview topics
      included reasons for prescribing new drugs launched between January 1998 and May 
      1999; reasons for prescribing the new drug rather than alternatives; and sources 
      of information used for each prescribed drug. RESULTS: Important biomedical
      influences were the failure of current therapy and adverse effect profile. More
      influential than these, however, was the pharmaceutical representative. Hospital 
      consultants and observation of hospital prescribing was cited next most
      frequently. Patient request for a drug, and patient convenience and acceptability
      were also likely to influence new drug uptake. Written information was of limited
      importance except for local guidelines. GPs were largely reactive and
      opportunistic recipients of new drug information, rarely reporting an active
      information search. The decision to initiate a new drug is heavily influenced by 
      'who says what', in particular the pharmaceutical industry, hospital consultants 
      and patients. The decision to 'adopt' a new drug is clinched by subsequent
      personal clinical experience. CONCLUSIONS: Prescribing of new drugs is not simply
      related to biomedical evaluation and critical appraisal but, more importantly, to
      the mode of exposure to pharmacological information and social influences on
      decision making. Viewed within this broad context, prescribing variation becomes 
      more understandable. Findings have implications for the implementation of
      evidence-based medicine, which requires a multifaceted approach.

TI  - Are urodynamic tests useful tools for the initial conservative management of
      non-neurogenic urinary incontinence? A review of the literature.
PG  - 63-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To summarise the evidence for the role of urodynamic tests in the
      diagnosis and classification of urinary incontinence. METHODS: Reference lists in
      relevant papers were reviewed and MEDLINE searches conducted. RESULTS: The mean
      sensitivity (specificity) of clinical history versus urodynamic tests was 0.82
      (0.57) for stress incontinence, 0.69 (0.60) for urge incontinence/overactive
      bladder, and 0.51 (0.66) for patients with mixed incontinence. The proportion of 
      women with a clinical diagnosis of urinary incontinence but with normal findings 
      from urodynamic tests ranged from 3 to 8%. Overall sensitivity of urodynamic
      tests was about 85-90% in the diagnosis of urodynamic stress incontinence, but
      generally lower following diagnosis of urge and mixed incontinence. No
      relationship emerged between urodynamic test results and response to medical
      treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This literature review shows that the sensitivity of
      clinical history versus urodynamic tests was 0.82, 0.69 and 0.51 respectively for
      stress, urge and mixed urinary incontinence. It also suggests that urodynamic
      diagnosis does not predict response to treatment. These data add to the ongoing
      'urodynamics or no urodynamics' debate in the evaluation of urinary incontinence 
      and show that urodynamic testing may not be helpful for patients receiving
      initial non-invasive therapy. These data are in line with the conclusions of the 
      1st and 2nd International Consultations on incontinence.

TI  - Muscarinic receptor subtypes and management of the overactive bladder.
PG  - 82-8; discussion 88-9
AB  - Anticholinergic agents are the most widely used therapy for urge incontinence
      despite exerting adverse effects, such as constipation, tachycardia, and dry
      mouth, that limit their use. These adverse effects result from a lack of
      selectivity for the bladder over other organs. Although M2-muscarinic receptors
      are the predominant cholinoreceptor present in urinary bladder, the smaller
      population of M3-receptors appears to be the most functionally important and
      mediates direct contraction of the detrusor muscle. M2-receptors modulate
      detrusor contraction by several mechanisms and may contribute more to contraction
      of the bladder in pathologic states, such as bladder denervation or spinal cord
      injury. Prejunctional inhibitory M2-receptors or M4-receptors and prejunctional
      facilitatory M1-muscarinic receptors in the bladder have also been reported, but 
      their relevance to the clinical effectiveness of muscarinic antagonists is
      unknown. In clinical studies, tolterodine, a nonselective muscarinic antagonist, 
      has been reported to be equally effective to oxybutynin but to induce less dry
      mouth. Controlled-release and intravesical, intravaginal, and rectal
      administrations of oxybutynin have all been reported to cause fewer adverse
      effects. Conversely, darifenacin, a new M3-selective antagonist, has been
      reported to have selectivity for the bladder over the salivary gland in vivo.
      Whether M3-selective or nonselective muscarinic antagonists will be the most
      clinically effective for the overactive bladder-preserving the best balance
      between efficacy and tolerability-has yet to be established, and comparative
      clinical trials between compounds, such as darifenacin (M3 selective) and
      tolterodine (nonselective) will be required.

TI  - Significance of low compliance bladder in cauda equina injury.
PG  - 650-5
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Prospective investigation using serial urodynamic studies.
      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate type of neurogenic bladder and to observe changes of
      autonomous detrusor contraction (ADC) after the normalization of the compliance
      and capacity of the bladder in cauda equina injury. SETTING: Spinal Cord Injury
      Unit, Yonsei Rehabilitation Hospital, Seoul, Korea. METHODS: Urodynamic studies
      were performed in 50 patients with complete cauda equina injury from trauma with 
      an infusion ratio of 30 ml/min. Findings of urodynamic studies and clinical
      features of patients with low compliance were compared with those of the normal
      compliant patients. Fourteen patients with low compliance received oral
      administration of oxybutynin and propiverine and intravesical instillation of
      oxybutynin to increase the compliance and capacity of the bladder, and follow-up 
      urodynamic studies to monitor the change were undertaken. RESULTS: Bladder
      compliance was decreased in 14 (28%) patients and normal in 36 (72%) patients.
      There was a significantly long time interval between the onset of injury and the 
      initiation of rehabilitative treatment in the neurogenic bladder group with low
      compliance when compared to those of the normal compliance group (P < 0.05).
      Clean intermittent catheterization was used as the voiding method, significantly 
      less than the normal compliance group (P < 0.05). ADC was observed in six out of 
      fourteen patients with low compliance neurogenic bladder, but none in the normal 
      compliance group. Upon the completion of conservative treatment, ADC disappeared 
      in four patients whose compliance and capacity of the bladder were normalized on 
      follow-up urodynamic studies. CONCLUSION: ADC was only observed in the low
      compliant bladder and as ADC disappeared when compliance and capacity of the
      bladder was normalized; low compliance appeared to be the main cause of ADC. In
      addition, this study supports that the maintenance of compliance of the bladder
      may be the most important factor in the management of neurogenic bladder.

TI  - Augmentation ureterocystoplasty in bladder exstrophy: 5-year follow-up in two
      cases.
PG  - 631-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report two cases of bladder exstrophy managed successfully by
      augmentation ureterocystoplasty (UCP) together with bladder neck surgery and
      continent diversion. PATIENTS: Two boys, age 5 and 1 years respectively, had
      augmentation UCP. The left refluxing megaureter was used in the first case
      together with bladder neck reconstruction. In the second patient, bilateral
      obstructed magaureters were used in tandem together with bladder neck division.
      Both patients had appendicovesicostomy according to Mitrofanoff. RESULTS: In
      follow-up for over 5 years, both patients are continent with improved upper
      urinary tracts and normal or stable renal function. They are managed by clean
      intermittent catheterization (CIC) via the continent stoma with bladder
      capacities of 220 cc and 150 cc, respectively. Cystogram showed no vesicoureteric
      reflux (VUR). The procedures were considered to be successful although one
      patient was on oxybutinin because urodynamics showed high intravesical pressures.
      CONCLUSIONS: Augmentation UCP should be considered in patients with bladder
      exstrophy when a suitable megaureter is available. This may be combined with
      simultaneous bladder neck reconstruction together with a continent diversion.

TI  - Urinary incontinence in girls.
PG  - 661-75, x
AB  - Girls with incontinence may have minor irritative conditions or undiagnosed
      anatomic abnormalities that may require surgery. These abnormalities can be
      identified during a comprehensive history and physical examination that focuses
      on voiding signs and symptoms. Urinary tract infection and constipation if
      present should be identified. Most girls with daytime wetting will respond to
      conservative therapy using timed voiding, dietary changes, and anticholinergic
      medication. Uroflowmetry with a postvoid residual urine measurement can identify 
      girls who may benefit from biofeedback to treat pelvic floor dysfunction. Formal 
      urodynamics and spinal magnetic resonance imaging should be done in girls
      refractory to treatment. Instruments and tools to quantify dysfunctional voiding 
      symptoms are being developed. Because most dysfunctional voiding will be treated 
      clinically, these validated tools will be useful in documenting severity of
      symptoms and clinical outcomes.

      increase in bladder capacity can eventually be obtained by RCT plus oxybutynin;
      and whether the increase in capacity is the primary key to success. METHODS:
      Sixty-eight children with refractory monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis were
      included. They all had a maximal cystometric capacity less than the age-expected 
      value. RCT was done by water loading and retention to the point of urgency once
      daily. During training, changes in bladder capacity were evaluated by voiding
      charts. If after 4 weeks of RCT, less than a 10% increase in bladder capacity was
      noted, oral oxybutynin was added. RESULTS: The incidence of DOA was 66%. After 4 
      weeks of RCT, the bladder capacity increased in 20.6%. Combining RCT with
      oxybutynin led in the end to normalization of the bladder capacity in 79.4%.
      Older age and high-pressure DOA negatively influenced the ability to increase the
      bladder capacity. Fifteen children became completely dry, mainly by converting
      enuresis to nocturia. CONCLUSIONS: Unsuccessful RCT is often caused by DOA,
      especially if a bladder capacity rise of at least 10% cannot be achieved within 4
      weeks. If oxybutynin is added to the treatment, normalization of bladder capacity
      can be obtained in most. This increased bladder capacity cures enuresis only in a
      minority by sharpening their arousal and provoking nocturia.

TI  - Female stress and urge incontinence in family practice: insight into the lower
      urinary tract.
PG  - 694-700
AB  - As many as 25% of all women are affected by urinary incontinence, but only a few 
      are treated. This frequent, often medically unrecognised, condition occurs in
      women of all ages. The continence mechanism is based on bladder detrusor control,
      intact anatomical structures in and around the urethra, correct positioning of
      the bladder neck and a comprehensive innervation of the lower urinary tract. Age 
      and childbearing are established risk factors for the development of urinary
      incontinence, but other factors are currently suggested. The evaluation of
      urinary incontinence should include history, gynaecological examination, urine
      test, frequency-volume diary and a pad-weighing test. Female urinary incontinence
      can be treated in general practice by simple means, e.g. pelvic floor muscle
      training, bladder training, electrostimulation, drug therapy, or a combination of
      these approaches. This review updates the knowledge of the continence mechanism
      and summarises the epidemiology, risk factors, assessment and treatment of
      urinary incontinence in general practice.

PG  - 318-21
AB  - The author presents 14 children after meningomyelocoele repair with faecal and
      urinary incontinence, aged from 6 to 17 years who have undergone the MACE
      procedure. MACE with synchronous Mitrofanoff continent stoma creation was
      performed in one child with severe stenosis of the urethra. MACE with
      simultaneous bladder augmentation was used in 10 patients. 5 of them underwent
      colocystoplasty, 3 had ileocystoplasty and 2 ureterocystoplasty. Of these 10
      children, three have additionally undergone the Mitrofanoff procedure. Patients' 
      follow-up ranged from six months to two years. Three children had trouble with
      the MACE stoma because of its stenosis. One of them required revision of the
      stoma. All patients became clean and dry, and this operation improved not only
      their quality of life, but also their independence.

TI  - Presumed rapid eye movement behavior disorder in Machado-Joseph disease
      (spinocerebellar ataxia type 3).
PG  - 1350-3
AB  - Rapid eye movement behavior disorder (RBD) is a recently recognized sleep
      disorder in which patients are occasionally not paralyzed during the dream
      portions of sleep. When not idiopathic, this state has been associated primarily 
      with parkinsonian conditions but also with a small number of medications and
      other neurodegenerative disorders. Dopamine deficiency may play a role in some
      patients. This report describes the occurrence of a syndrome that appears to be
      RBD in 6 of 7 patients followed with Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3
      (Machado-Joseph disease). Polysomnography was normal in 1 patient. Two of these
      patients had had single photon emission computed tomographic imaging of the
      dopamine transporter 1 year previously.

TI  - Advances in drug delivery: improved bioavailability and drug effect.
PG  - 439-44
AB  - Alterations in drug delivery produce substantial changes in the bioavailability
      of anticholinergic agents. These bioavailability differences change the efficacy 
      and tolerability of this drug class, which consistently enhances patient
      compliance and overall drug effect. In order for drug delivery to alter
      successfully the bioavailability of a specific agent, the metabolism of that
      agent and the effect of the degradatory pathway on drug-parent compound levels
      need to be established. This will enable researchers to design improved or
      altered delivery pathways to maximize the benefits of these agents. Intestinal
      metabolism is known to affect certain agents, specifically oxybutynin chloride.
      Therefore, delivery techniques have been designed that either substantially lower
      or totally bypass intestinal (presystemic) metabolism. These alternate paths
      include extended-release oral, cutaneous, intravesical, and intravaginal routes. 
      In addition, improvements in drug delivery have also been found to influence
      positively efficacy and tolerability profiles associated with tolterodine
      tartrate, another anticholinergic agent. A long-acting oral formulation has been 
      shown to increase drug efficacy while decreasing tolerability concerns and side
      effects such as xerostomia. These salubrious effects are, in part, due to the
      more stable serum-drug concentrations that are imparted by this long-acting
      formulation.

TI  - Conservative management in neurogenic bladder dysfunction.
PG  - 473-7
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: A few decades ago, urinary diversion, usually with an ileal
      conduit, was the ultimate outcome for most children with spina bifida. The
      revolutionary institution of clean intermittent catheterization has changed the
      algorithm totally. Furthermore many new drugs have been developed during the past
      decade and have decreased the need for surgery dramatically. In this article, we 
      will focus on the most recent data on new modalities of therapy to help avoid
      urinary diversion or bladder augmentation. RECENT FINDINGS: In addition to clean 
      intermittent catheterization and oxybutynin treatment, a new generation of
      anticholinergic medications, such as tolterodine, has been developed. For
      patients who drop out because of the side-effects of oral administration, new
      methods of administration are now available, including extended release and
      intravesical instillation. For those unresponsive, botulinum-A toxin and
      resiniferatoxin are two relatively new drugs in the field, administered as
      intravesical injection and instillation, respectively. Intravesical or
      transdermal electrical stimulation, sacral nerve stimulation and biofeedback
      therapy are under development, but as currently administered, are not yet
      completely successful. SUMMARY: Although life-saving in many respects, bladder
      augmentation introduces life-long risks of its own. Our goal in describing
      'conservative' management is to prevent this step. Many alternatives to surgery
      are available now and more effective strategies are under development.

TI  - Giggle incontinence in children: a manifestation of detrusor instability.
PG  - 2184-7; discussion 2187
AB  - PURPOSE: To our knowledge the prevalence and cause of giggle incontinence in
      children is not known. We hypothesized that laughter may induce unstable detrusor
      contractions in children susceptible to detrusor instability. We evaluated the
      prevalence of diurnal voiding symptoms of urinary urgency, urge incontinence,
      pelvic withholding maneuvers and hesitancy in patients with giggle incontinence, 
      the prevalence of giggle incontinence in patients with diurnal voiding symptoms, 
      the prevalence of the 2 conditions in first degree relatives of patients with
      giggle incontinence, the influence of treatment for detrusor instability on the
      frequency of giggle incontinence and the prevalence of diurnal voiding symptoms
      in control children with giggle incontinence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Of 1,421
      children 5 to 15 years old referred to the pediatric nephrology department for
      various problems 109 were diagnosed with giggle incontinence and 460 had diurnal 
      voiding symptoms. A total of 627 children visiting the pediatrician office whose 
      parents completed a survey questionnaire served as controls. RESULTS: Diurnal
      voiding symptoms were noted in 95% of the patients with giggle incontinence,
      while giggle incontinence was noted in 23% of those with diurnal voiding
      symptoms. Of the patients with giggle incontinence a positive family history for 
      that entity and diurnal voiding symptoms was noted in 13% and 28%, respectively. 
      Giggle incontinence improved in all patients after treatment for detrusor
      instability and it resolved completely in 89%. Giggle incontinence recurred with 
      a relapse of diurnal voiding symptoms in 28 cases and improved with improved
      diurnal voiding symptoms during modification of therapy. Diurnal voiding symptoms
      were present in 43% of the 157 controls with giggle incontinence. CONCLUSIONS:
      Giggle incontinence results from detrusor instability induced by laughter and it 
      improves with effective treatment of detrusor instability.

TI  - Current and future pharmacological treatment for overactive bladder.
PG  - 1897-913
AB  - PURPOSE: Urinary incontinence and overactive bladder are important and common
      conditions that have received little general medical attention. We reviewed the
      magnitude and impact of these conditions, and discuss pharmacotherapy as well as 
      new drugs under investigation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The main emphasis of this
      review is pharmacological therapy for the bladder. We discuss currently available
      agents, drugs under development and pharmacological targets that would be
      suitable targets for treating overactive bladder. Drugs such as duloxetine that
      target not bladder smooth muscle, but rather central nervous system control of
      the micturition reflex are undergoing clinical trials. We also discuss
      intravesical therapy and alternative drug delivery methods, such as intravesical 
      capsaicin and botulinum toxin, with special emphasis on approaches to modulate
      bladder afferent nerve function for preventing overactive bladder. RESULTS: There
      are many advantages to advanced drug delivery systems, including long-term
      therapeutic efficacy, decreased side effects and improved patient compliance.
      Future speculation such as gene therapy holds great promise for overactive
      bladder because it is possible to access all genitourinary organs via endoscopy
      and other minimally invasive techniques that are ideally suited for gene therapy.
      CONCLUSIONS: Traditional anticholinergic therapies are limited in their
      effectiveness. There is great hope for future research regarding voiding
      dysfunction and urinary incontinence through a focus on afferent nerve
      intervention for preventing overactive bladder.

TI  - Individualized drug use assessment in the elderly.
PG  - 1239-48
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To quantify how seniors' ability to take oral prescription drugs
      safely may correlate with age, sex, socioeconomic status, education, cognitive
      impairment, depression, and drug self-management. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study
      SETTING: Three retirement communities and an adult day care center. PATIENTS:
      Fifty-seven elderly individuals (mean age 79.49 +/- 7.26 yrs; mean education
      11.33 +/- 3.8 yrs; 72% women). INTERVENTION: After completing a comprehensive
      medical history, and with drug vials and pillboxes available for consultation,
      each subject described how he or she was taking prescribed oral drugs.
      MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The MedTake test evaluated dosage, indication,
      food or water coingestion, and regimen. For each agent, the test was scored as
      percentage of correct actions, equally weighted, and compared with label
      directions or self-expressed physician changes. A composite MedTake test score
      (0-100%) summarized a subject's overall ability to take their drug(s) safely A
      follow-up qualitative assessment by a single pharmacist assigned each agent to
      one of four potential risk categories: correct use, partial correct use without
      potential clinical significance, partial correct use with potential clinical
      significance, or incorrect use with high potential of clinical significance. Most
      subjects (80%) managed their own drug therapy; 70% used reminder systems
      (calendar, pillbox). The number of medical conditions and prescription drugs was 
      6.11 +/- 4.2 and 5.88 +/- 3.44, respectively. Of 325 agents, correct dosage was
      reported for 94% (306), correct indication for 95% (309), correct coingestion
      with food or water for 97% (314), and correct regimen for 89% (288). The
      composite MedTake test score was 88.5 +/- 21.3%. The multivariate model, with
      that score as the dependent variable, adjusted for age and sex, used Mini-Mental 
      State Examination (p = 0.002) and Medicaid assistance within 10 years (p = 0.021)
      as significant factors. The most frequent problem was underdosing of
      cardiovascular drugs. CONCLUSION: Seniors' ability to take oral prescription
      drugs safely was affected by cognitive function and socioeconomic status.
      Although the MedTake test helped identify some problems with therapy adherence, a
      pharmacist's follow-up evaluation of comprehensive medical and drug histories
      identified additional potentially clinically significant problems in 20% of
      subjects.

TI  - Three screening batteries to detect cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 382-9
AB  - To compare the sensitivities for detecting cognitive impairment in patients with 
      multiple sclerosis (MS) and administration times of three brief batteries of
      neuropsychological tests, 64 patients with MS completed the Neuropsychological
      Screening Battery for Multiple Sclerosis (NPSBMS), the Screening Examination for 
      Cognitive Impairment (SEFCI), and the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of
      Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). Failure on a particular test was defined as a 
      score below the 5th percentile for healthy controls, and the number of patients
      who failed at least one or two tests (out of four) was determined for each
      battery. Both the SEFCI and the NPSBMS identified significantly more patients
      with impairment than the RBANS, which was no more sensitive than the Mini-Mental 
      State Exam (MMSE). Results were similar at both the one- and two-failed-tests
      criteria, but there were no significant differences between the SEFCI and the
      NPSBMS at either failure criterion. Mean administration time was 22.6 min for the
      SEFCI compared to 31.7 min for the NPSBMS (p < 0.001). Eleven (17%) of the
      patients refused to attempt the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT), one 
      component of the NPSBMS. For screening patents on a single occasion, the SEFCI is
      preferred because its administration time is shorter than the NPSBMS.

TI  - Office assessment of patient outcome of pharmacologic therapy for urge
      incontinence.
PG  - 334-8
AB  - Thirty adult women with urge urinary incontinence were included in this study.
      After completing the basic evaluation, including a self-administered incontinence
      questionnaire, patients were treated with a bladder relaxant preparation for 6-8 
      weeks. At follow-up the incontinence questionnaire and a global assessment of
      outcome scale were administered. Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney and
      Kruskal-Wallis tests, with a subsequent Tukey's test. After 6-8 weeks of therapy,
      63% of patients reported that they were greatly or moderately improved, with a
      significant mean decrease in their total urge score of 51%. Subjects slightly
      improved (12%) and unimproved/worse (20%) had no significant change in their mean
      urge score. Most patients with great or moderate improvement continued with their
      initial drug treatment. Successful pharmacotherapy for urinary urge incontinence 
      may be assessed by a simple global scale which correlated well with response to
      the MESA questionnaire. Moderate and greatly improved patients correlated with a 
      50% mean decrease in urge score and continued their initial drug therapy.

TI  - The subtypes of muscarinic receptors for neurogenic bladder contraction in rats.
PG  - 245-53
AB  - We evaluated in vivo functional selectivity profiles for muscarinic M(2) and M(3)
      subtypes of four muscarinic antagonists: Compound A (a novel muscarinic receptor 
      antagonist with M(2)-sparing antagonistic activity), darifenacin, (a muscarinic
      M(3) receptor antagonist); methoctramine (a muscarinic M(2) receptor antagonist) 
      and tolterodine (a nonselective muscarinic receptor antagonist), and compared the
      inhibition potency on distention-induced bladder contraction in rats. In an in
      vivo functional study, Compound A (0.03-10 mg/kg, i.v.) showed antimuscarinic
      activity with high selectivity for M(3) (salivation) over M(2) (bradycardia)
      (>100-fold). Darifenacin (0.01-0.3 mg/kg, i.v.) showed only slight selectivity
      for M(3) over M(2) (3.7-fold). Methoctramine (0.003-1 mg/kg, i.v.) showed the
      reverse selectivity profile (0.077-fold). Tolterodine (0.003-0.3 mg/kg, i.v.)
      showed less selectivity (1.2-fold). Compound A at M(3) inhibitory doses (0.1 and 
      0.3 mg/kg, i.v.) showed inhibition in a distention-induced neurogenic bladder
      contraction model, and its maximal inhibitory effects were about 60% at an even
      higher dose (3 mg/kg). Methoctramine at M(2) inhibitory doses (0.03 and 0.1
      mg/kg, i.v.) did not significantly affect distention-induced bladder contraction.
      When tolterodine and darifenacin caused inhibition of distention-induced bladder 
      contraction, its maximal inhibitory effects were similar to that of Compound A.
      Therefore, these findings suggest that Compound A would be an excellent
      pharmacological tool to give a better understanding of which subtypes of
      muscarinic receptors act in bladder function so far, and muscarinic M(3), but not
      M(2), receptors mainly mediate the cholinergic component of distention-induced
      bladder contraction.

TI  - Pharmacologic treatment for detrusor overactivity.
PG  - 365-72
AB  - Recent pharmacologic treatment for detrusor overactivity has resulted in more
      favorable side effect profiles, not only because of the use of different drug
      delivery systems for older drugs but perhaps also due to the improved bladder
      selectivity of newer antimuscarinic agents. These developments translate into
      higher patient compliance and better long-term results with the newer agents over
      generic immediate-release oxybutynin for the treatment of the overactive bladder.

TI  - A benefit-risk assessment of extended-release oxybutynin.
PG  - 867-76
AB  - Oxybutynin is a muscarinic receptor antagonist, which has been available for a
      number of years in its original immediate-release (IR) formulation. While
      oxybutynin IR has proven effective for the treatment of overactive bladder, its
      extended use can be limited by adverse effects, particularly dry mouth. An
      extended-release (ER) formulation of oxybutynin based on the OROS system has
      recently become available, which allows once daily administration. In direct
      comparison to oxybutynin IR, oxybutynin ER has an increased oral bioavailability 
      for the parent compound oxybutynin which is accompanied by a reduced
      bioavailability for the active metabolite N-desethyl-oxybutynin. The latter has
      been implicated in mediating a major part of the adverse effects of oxybutynin
      treatment. Two double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised studies in patients
      with overactive bladder have demonstrated that oxybutynin ER has a similar
      efficacy as oxybutynin IR but with improved tolerability. This is in line with
      clinical pharmacological studies demonstrating a smaller impairment of saliva
      production with oxybutynin ER than with oxybutynin IR. Thus, the ER formulation
      of oxybutynin maintains the therapeutic benefits and concomitantly improves
      tolerability.

TI  - Urinary tract infections in adult general practice patients.
PG  - 752-61
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are symptomatic infections of the urinary tract, 
      mainly caused by the bacterium Escherichia coli. One in two women suffers from a 
      UTI at least once in her life. The young and sexually active are particulaly
      affected, but it is also seen in elderly, postmenopausal women. The likelihood of
      recurrence is high. Diagnosis is made with regard to typical complaints and the
      presence of leucocytes and nitrites in the urine. A culture is unnecessary in
      most cases. Uncomplicated UTI should be distinguished from complicated UTI, which
      has a risk of severe illness. The treatment of choice--short-term therapy with
      trimethoprim or nitrofurantoin--is successful in over 80% of the cases.
      Co-trimoxazol fluoroquinolones or cephalsporins are not considered first-choice
      drugs. There are indications that general practitioners' (GPs') management of UTI
      is not always optimal, specifically concerning diagnostic tests, the application 
      of second-choice antibiotics, and the length of prescribed treatment courses.
      Many points relevant to GPs requirefurther research, such as epidemiology and
      resistance of urinary pathogens in the community and natural history of UTI, as
      well as optimal management in elderly or complicated patients and men.

TI  - Pharmacologic options for the management of multiple sclerosis symptoms.
PG  - 223-31
AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease with a wide-ranging impact on physical
      functioning. Although pharmacotherapy plays an indispensable role in the
      management of MS symptoms, optimal disease management requires a
      multidisciplinary approach that combines medication, rehabilitation, and patient 
      education. Successful control of symptoms is critical to quality of life for MS
      patients. Immunomodulating drugs provide a means of controlling the underlying
      disease process, but they are not a cure. This places responsibility on health
      care providers to control a patient's MS-related symptoms to limit disability and
      delay impairment in the activities of daily living. Owing to the importance of
      symptom control, comprehensive patient evaluations should be performed at regular
      intervals to determine the extent of neurological damage and disease progression 
      and to address changing patient needs. The goal of interventions should be not
      only to treat the primary and secondary symptoms of MS but also to provide access
      to the psychosocial support that will help MS patients and their families
      continue to cope as disease status changes.

TI  - Characterization of a new muscarinic receptor antagonist PNU-171990 in guinea
      pig, cat and human smooth muscle.
PG  - 171-5
AB  - The present study was done to characterize a new compound, PNU-171990,
      2-diisopropyl aminoethyl 1-phenylcyclopentane carboxylate hydrochloride, with
      functional smooth muscle selectivity at least as high as tolterodine. In vitro
      homogenates of guinea pig cerebral cortex, parotid gland, heart, urinary bladder,
      and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing human muscarinic m(1)-m(5)
      receptors PNU-171990 did not show selectivity for any subtype (pK(i), 7.72-8.64).
      PNU-171990 caused a parallel shift in the concentration-response curve for
      carbachol-induced contraction of smooth muscle from guinea pig bladder (pK(B),
      7.65), guinea pig ileum (pK(B), 8.48), and human ileum (pK(B), 7.10). In vivo
      PNU-171990 inhibited urinary bladder contraction with a significantly lower
      ID(50) than on the salivary secretion (206 and 706 nmol/kg, respectively,
      P<0.05). In conclusion, PNU-171990 is a competitive and potent muscarinic
      receptor antagonist in vitro with a numerically better selectivity ratio for the 
      bladder contraction over salivation in vivo than tolterodine.

TI  - The potential of pill splitting to achieve cost savings.
PG  - 706-12
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To present a methodology for identifying specific medications for
      which pill splitting is clinically appropriate and cost saving, to present data
      from a commercial managed care population on current pill-splitting practices,
      and to estimate additional cost savings from extended use of this strategy. STUDY
      DESIGN: Retrospective pharmacy claims analysis. METHODS: Pharmacy claims data
      from a commercial managed care health plan covering 19,000 lives and national
      drug data were used to compile a list of frequently prescribed medications.
      Excluding medications in which packaging, formulation, and potential adverse
      pharmacologic outcomes prohibited splitting, we performed a cost analysis of
      medications amenable to splitting. RESULTS: Eleven medications amenable to pill
      splitting were identified based on potential cost savings and clinical
      appropriateness: clonazepam, doxazosin, atorvastatin, pravastatin, citalopram,
      sertraline, paroxetine, lisinopril, nefazadone, olanzapine, and sildenafil. For
      these medications, pill splitting is currently infrequent, accounting for annual 
      savings of $6200 (or $0.03 per member per month), just 2% of the potential
      $259,500 (or $1.14 per member per month) that more comprehensive pill-splitting
      practices could save annually. CONCLUSIONS: Pill splitting can be a cost-saving
      practice when implemented judiciously using drug- and patient-specific criteria
      aimed at clinical safety, although this strategy is used infrequently.

TI  - Inappropriate drug prescribing in home-dwelling, elderly patients: a
      population-based survey.
PG  - 1707-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 1997, a US expert panel developed explicit criteria on potentially
      inappropriate drugs for the general elderly population. OBJECTIVE: To investigate
      the proportion of inappropriate medications among home-dwelling, elderly patients
      in Helsinki, Finland, between November 1, 1998, and March 31, 1999. METHODS: A
      cross-sectional mail survey was sent to a random sample of 3921 elderly urban
      residents aged 75, 80, 85, 90, and 95 years. Of these, 3219 were home dwellers.
      MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Prevalence of potentially inappropriate drugs and
      prevalence of drugs considered inappropriate related to 15 common medical
      conditions according to recommendations given by the expert panel in 1997.
      RESULTS: The response rate was 78%. Of the respondents, 12.5%, 1.3%, and 0.2%
      were taking at least 1, 2, or 3 inappropriate drugs, respectively. The most
      prevalent inappropriate drugs were dipyridamole (3.6%), long-acting
      benzodiazepines (2.6%), amitriptyline hydrochloride (1.6%), ergot mesyloids
      (1.6%), muscle relaxants (1.2%), and meprobamate (1.1%). Use of medications
      considered inappropriate with certain medical conditions was higher: 27.2% of
      patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were taking beta-blockers and
      19.3% used sedatives. Of diabetic individuals taking oral hypoglycemics or
      insulin, 32.5% were taking a concomitant beta-blocker. Of those with a peripheral
      vascular disease, 37.9% were taking beta-blockers. However, two thirds of all
      these patient groups had concomitant coronary heart disease. CONCLUSIONS:
      Compared with previous surveys, the use of inappropriate medications in our
      home-dwelling, elderly population is conspicuously low. In contrast, use of
      certain drugs considered inappropriate with different medical conditions was
      relatively high. However, the inappropriateness of the latter treatments may be
      questioned in individual patients.

TI  - Medical therapy for the overactive bladder in the elderly.
PG  - 241-6
AB  - The overactive bladder is the commonest underlying bladder disorder causing
      urinary incontinence in elderly people. Management of the condition relies upon a
      holistic assessment of the problem, lifestyle adjustment, behavioural management 
      and drug therapy. The majority of currently available drugs rely on their
      anti-muscarinic properties for efficacy. Both behavioural techniques and drug
      therapy are effective in treatment of the elderly and each modality has a
      particular role to play in successful treatment and maintenance of this
      condition.

TI  - The minor population of M3-receptors mediate contraction of human detrusor muscle
      in vitro.
PG  - 243-8
AB  - 1 The objective was to determine the role of muscarinic receptor subtypes in
      mediating contraction of the human detrusor smooth muscle in vitro. 2 Contractile
      responses of human detrusor muscle strips to carbachol were obtained in the
      absence and presence of a range of muscarinic antagonists (pirenzepine,
      methoctramine, 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methyl piperidine methiodide (4-DAMP),
      tropicamide, oxybutynin and tolterodine). Affinity estimates (pKB values) were
      calculated for the antagonists and correlated with values at the cloned
      muscarinic receptor subtypes quoted in the literature. 3 Pirenzepine,
      methoctramine and tropicamide drugs that have high affinities at M1, M2 and
      M4-receptors, respectively, all had low affinities on the human detrusor (pKB
      values of 6.8, 6.9 and 6.5, respectively), whilst the M3-selective antagonist
      4-DAMP had a high affinity (9.5). Schild plots for all four antagonists had
      slopes of unity indicating an action at a single receptor. Oxybutynin and
      tolterodine also acted as competitive antagonists with affinity estimates of 7.6 
      and 8.1, respectively. 4 When the antagonist affinities obtained on the bladder
      were plotted against the values published for these antagonists at the cloned
      muscarinic receptor subtypes, the best correlations were obtained for the m3- and
      m5-muscarinic receptor subtypes. 5 These data suggest that direct contractile
      responses of the human detrusor muscle to muscarinic receptor stimulation in
      vitro are mediated solely via the M3-muscarinic receptor subtype with no
      contribution from the major M2-receptor population.

TI  - Current pharmacotherapeutic strategies for overactive bladder.
PG  - 827-33
AB  - Overactive bladder (OAB) is a chronic, distressing condition characterised by
      symptoms of urgency (sudden overwhelming urge to urinate) and frequency
      (urinating more than eight times daily), with or without urge urinary
      incontinence (sudden involuntary loss of urine). It affects millions of people of
      all ages and both sexes world wide, with greater prevalence in women and the
      elderly. The treatment of OAB is aimed at reducing debilitating symptoms, which
      have a significant effect on all aspects of an individual's quality of life,
      including social, domestic, psychological, occupational, physical and sexual
      functioning. Anticholinergic agents are currently recommended as first-line
      therapy for OAB. Their use results in significant clinical improvement in
      patients, although a lack of selectivity for receptors in the bladder may lead to
      troublesome side effects, including dry mouth, blurred vision, somnolence,
      dizziness and constipation. Recent research efforts have focused on developing
      drugs with a reduced propensity for causing these problems. Of the available
      anticholinergic agents, oxybutynin and tolterodine are the most widely used to
      treat OAB. Studies directly comparing tolterodine immediate-release (IR) with
      oxybutynin IR have shown that the two agents have similar efficacy. However,
      tolterodine IR is significantly better tolerated, particularly with respect to
      the incidence and severity of dry mouth. An extended-release formulation of
      tolterodine (4 mg capsules) has recently been developed to allow for once-daily
      dosing. In addition to greater convenience, tolterodine extended-release has
      shown enhanced efficacy and tolerability compared with tolterodine IR.

TI  - Treatment interventions for Parkinson's disease: an evidence based assessment.
PG  - 1589-98
AB  - We did a systematic review, with a uniform method of assessment of efficacy and
      safety, to assess the different interventions available for the management of
      Parkinson's disease (drugs, surgical interventions, and physical treatments) with
      respect to the following indications: prevention of disease progression,
      symptomatic treatment of motor features (parkinsonism), symptomatic control of
      motor complications, prevention of motor complications, and symptomatic treatment
      of non-motor features. Our aim was not to define practice guidelines, but rather 
      to improve clinicians' knowledge of the presently available published clinical
      evidence, based mainly on randomised controlled trials. We hope that our review
      will help doctors to incorporate this background into their own decision-making
      strategy to make appropriate choices with respect to the treatment of individual 
      patients with Parkinson's disease.

TI  - Sexual and urological dysfunction in multiple sclerosis: better understanding and
      improved therapies.
PG  - 271-8
AB  - The fundamental strategy in treating multiple sclerosis patients with unstable
      bladders involves a combination of suppressing urgency and ensuring effective
      urinary drainage. Anti-cholinergics remain the first-line treatment, but
      alternative therapies are undergoing clinical trials. With a range of new
      pro-erectile oral medications available, interest has grown in treatment of
      multiple sclerosis-related erectile failure. Female sexual dysfunction is also
      now gaining some attention, with new classification criteria and methods for
      assessing and treating these patients.

TI  - Overactive bladder patients and role of the pharmacist.
PG  - 469-76; quiz 477-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To summarize the prevalence, quality of life (QOL) implications, cost
      of illness, and pharmacotherapy of overactive bladder (OAB), and to describe the 
      pharmacist's role in the management of patients with OAB. DATA SOURCES: Articles 
      published between 1990 and 2001 identified through a MEDLINE search using the
      terms overactive bladder, unstable bladder, urinary incontinence, prevalence,
      cost of illness, quality of life, drug therapy, pharmacist, and pharmacy in
      various combinations. STUDY SELECTION: All studies providing information on OAB
      or urinary incontinence were retrieved. DATA EXTRACTION: By the authors. DATA
      SYNTHESIS: Published prevalence and cost studies focus primarily on urinary
      incontinence, which is only one possible symptom of OAB. Reported prevalence
      rates of urge and mixed incontinence in the United States range from 3% to 8% and
      5% to 37%, respectively, and the highest prevalence has been found in geriatric
      and psychogeriatric populations. Associated costs are substantial. Total costs of
      OAB in the United States were estimated to be $12.6 billion in 2000. Patients
      with OAB score lower than the general population in QOL assessments. All aspects 
      of QOL can be compromised by OAB, as physical, social, occupational, domestic,
      and sexual activities are often limited in OAB patients. The pharmacist is
      instrumental in improving an individual's QOL through ensuring safe and effective
      treatment for OAB. Oxybutynin and tolterodine (Detrol-Pharmacia) have been the
      mainstays of pharmacotherapy for OAB, but frequent adverse effects (including dry
      mouth) often prevent patients from adhering to treatment. Tolterodine, now
      available in a new long-acting formulation, has been proven safe and efficacious 
      in the treatment of OAB, with fewer adverse effects and better tolerability than 
      existing agents. CONCLUSION: Pharmacists can play an active role in helping
      identify and recommending interventions for OAB that can ultimately improve an
      individual's QOL.

TI  - Use of anticholinergic medications by older adults with dementia.
PG  - 836-42
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the prevalence of anticholinergic use in older adults with
      probable dementia with that of a matched comparison group of older adults who
      were unlikely to have dementia and to examine the extent to which patients taking
      donepezil concomitantly use anticholinergic medications. DESIGN: Retrospective
      study. SETTING: Community-based older adults receiving medications through a
      pharmacy benefit management company. PARTICIPANTS: Eight hundred thirty-six
      patients aged 65 and older. Patients taking donepezil (n = 418) constituted the
      treatment group. Patients not taking donepezil (n = 418) constituted the
      comparison group. Each treatment group member was matched with a comparison group
      member on the basis of age, sex, and number of drugs taken for chronic
      conditions. MEASUREMENTS: The prevalence of anticholinergic use was compared in
      the treatment and comparison groups over a 3- to 12-month follow-up period using 
      pharmacy claims data. The proportion of follow-up period days that treatment
      group members concomitantly used donepezil and anticholinergics was also
      examined. RESULTS: Older adults with probable dementia were more likely to use
      anticholinergics than matched comparison group patients (33.0% vs 23.4%; P
      =.001). Of treatment group members receiving anticholinergics, 26.1% used
      multiple anticholinergic medications. Treatment group members who received
      anticholinergics used those drugs concomitantly with donepezil on a mean of 28.4%
      of follow-up period days. CONCLUSIONS: Community-based, commercially insured,
      older adults with probable dementia are more likely to take anticholinergics than
      matched controls. Patients taking donepezil frequently use an anticholinergic
      medication concomitantly. This study suggests that prescribing for older adults
      with dementia could be improved, especially if cognitive enhancing agents are
      being considered.

TI  - A long-term follow-up of autoaugmentation in myelodysplastic children.
PG  - 928-31
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term results of patients who underwent bladder
      autoaugmentation (BA) in whom BA was used to treat a neuropathic bladder
      secondary to myelomeningocele, and who presented with a high-pressure/poorly
      compliant bladder. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eleven patients (eight girls and three
      boys, mean age 12.8 years, mean follow-up 6.6 years) were selected who had
      undergone BA between June 1991 and June 1994. At surgery, the patients had a
      poorly compliant bladder with a mean leak point volume (LPV) of 94 mL and a mean 
      leak point pressure (LPP) of 58 cmH2O. None of the patients had vesico-ureteric
      reflux (VUR) at BA; five with grade III or IV VUR had undergone endoscopic
      correction in a day-surgery procedure using a suburethral collagen injection 1-3 
      weeks before BA. The patients were evaluated using clinical, urodynamic,
      radiological and endoscopic assessments. The LPV, LPP and safe bladder capacity
      (SBC, the cystometric volume at an intravesical pressure of 40 cmH2O) were
      recorded. RESULTS: At 1 year after surgery the mean LPV was 297 mL; none of the
      patients had VUR. The most recent mean LPV was 198 mL and the SBC 167 mL. The
      mean LPP remained stable at 60 cmH2O. At the last follow-up four patients had
      recurrent uni- or bilateral grade III-V VUR. At endoscopy the 'augmented' bladder
      portion had a smooth surface, compared with the grossly trabeculated lower half. 
      From this finding all patients on clean intermittent catheterization were treated
      with oral oxybutynin. Some patients reported slightly less abdominal pain at
      maximum bladder volume; four needed pads to treat intermittent incontinence. On
      voiding cysto-urethrography, one patient had an hourglass-shaped bladder. Five
      patients recently underwent ileocystoplasty because of recurrent urinary tract
      infection, high-grade VUR and incontinence. CONCLUSION: These results do not
      justify the routine use of BA in hypertonic/poorly compliant bladders secondary
      to myelomeningocele. The mean follow-up of 6.6 years showed that this procedure
      failed in seven of 11 patients. Further studies might be able to identify
      subgroups in which this approach may be more appropriate.

TI  - Tolterodine: selectivity for the urinary bladder over the eye (as measured by
      visual accommodation) in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 75-81
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Tolterodine exhibits a favourable selectivity for the urinary bladder 
      over salivary glands in vivo, in the anaesthetised cat, whereas oxybutynin shows 
      the opposite selectivity profile in this model. This study further evaluated the 
      selectivity profiles of tolterodine and oxybutynin by comparing the effects on
      bladder function and visual accommodation in the same individuals. METHODS: In a 
      double-blind, randomised, four-way crossover study, 16 healthy volunteers
      received single oral doses of tolterodine 5 mg and oxybutynin 2.5, 5 and 7.5 mg. 
      Voiding parameters were assessed for 12 hours post-dose, along with visual
      accommodation (near point of vision) at regular intervals. RESULTS: A
      dose-dependent increase in maximum bladder capacity was observed for oxybutynin
      [2.5 mg (+35%), 5 mg (+45%) and 7.5 mg (%)]. The effect of tolterodine 5 mg on
      bladder capacity was approximately twice (+93%) that seen after oxybutynin 5 mg
      and the onset of the effect was more rapid with tolterodine. Effects on visual
      accommodation were also dose-dependent for oxybutynin (maximum changes in near
      point of vision were 13%, 20% and 29%, respectively). The maximum change observed
      after tolterodine 5 mg was the same as after oxybutynin 5 mg (i.e. 20%).
      CONCLUSIONS: Tolterodine seems to exhibit selectivity for the bladder over the
      eye. Therefore, these results suggest that the normal dosage of tolterodine (2 mg
      twice daily) may have less effect on visual accommodation than the equivalent
      dosage of oxybutynin (5 mg three times daily) in patients with an overactive
      bladder.

TI  - Once-daily, extended-release formulations of antimuscarinic agents in the
      treatment of overactive bladder: a review.
PG  - 6-14
AB  - Overactive bladder (OAB) is a chronic condition that often requires long-term
      treatment to maintain control of symptoms. A range of therapeutic options are
      available; however, antimuscarinic agents form the mainstay of treatment. Of
      these agents, tolterodine and oxybutynin are the most widely used. It is well
      documented that the immediate-release (IR) formulations of these agents have
      equivalent efficacy in relieving OAB symptoms. However, tolterodine demonstrates 
      a more favorable tolerability profile, particularly in terms of the frequency and
      severity of dry mouth. Due to the development of novel drug delivery systems,
      extended-release (ER) formulations of both oxybutynin and tolterodine are now
      available, permitting once-daily dosing. The convenience of once-daily dosing of 
      antimuscarinic agents would be expected to improve patient compliance and further
      relieve the symptoms of OAB. Clinical studies with the ER formulations of
      tolterodine and oxybutynin demonstrate potential clinical advantages over their
      respective IR forms in terms of either efficacy or tolerability or both, although
      the therapeutic index of tolterodine ER appears to show a greater advantage over 
      its IR counterpart compared with oxybutynin ER and its IR form. Importantly, the 
      two ER agents have not been compared directly in a head-to-head clinical study.
      Overall, available clinical data suggest that the newly developed ER formulation 
      of tolterodine represents a significant therapeutic advancement in the treatment 
      of OAB.

TI  - Assessment and conservative management of the neuropathic bladder.
PG  - 108-19
AB  - The etiologies and forms of congenital neuropathic bladder are described:
      contractile (25%), acontractile (15%), and intermediate (60%). The terminology
      relating to neuropathic bladder is defined and the principles of bladder
      management are highlighted: (1) must achieve a bladder that can fill at low
      pressure, (2) must achieve a bladder that can store urine at low pressure, (3)
      must achieve sphincter resistance that is sufficient to allow urine storage, and 
      (4) must put in place a mechanism of achieving complete voluntary bladder
      emptying. The approach to investigation is set out in a logical sequence, and the
      methods of achieving the goals highlighted above are described. All of this is
      put in the context of managing the handicapped patient as a whole. It also is
      stressed that the aim is not just to achieve continence but perhaps even more
      importantly to protect renal function.

TI  - Efficacy of desmopressin in treatment of refractory nocturia in patients older
      than 65 years.
PG  - 485-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of desmopressin treatment in patients 65
      years old and older with nocturia and to determine whether baseline urodynamic
      characteristics influenced the outcome of treatment. METHODS: Patients with
      nocturia three or more times a night and nocturnal polyuria refractory to
      medication were treated with oral desmopressin 0.1 mg at bedtime for 4 weeks.
      Data from urodynamic studies and a voiding diary, nocturnal urine volume, urine
      specific gravity, serum sodium and potassium level, and quality of life index
      were measured at baseline, 4 weeks, and 4 weeks after discontinuation of
      treatment. RESULTS: A total of 30 patients (25 men and 5 women) were enrolled in 
      the study. The mean age was 75.4 +/- 6.6 years. Five patients (16.7%) reported
      side effects, including hyponatremia in one. Twenty patients (66.7%) reported a
      good response with both reduced nocturnal frequency (5.2 +/- 1.16 times versus
      2.24 +/- 1.12 times a night, P = 0.000) and urine volume (955.6 +/- 255.9 mL
      versus 522.8 +/- 210.5 mL, P <0.0001). Two patients (6.7%) had improved nocturnal
      frequency, and 3 patients (10%) reported no effect at all. After discontinuing
      the medication for 4 weeks, 13 patients (52%) had improved symptoms compared with
      baseline and 6 (24%) remained at their post-treatment frequency of nocturia.
      Urodynamic studies revealed that 15 patients had detrusor instability and 17 had 
      a cystometric capacity of 250 mL or less. No significant difference was found in 
      the success rate relative to the urodynamic results. CONCLUSIONS: Desmopressin is
      safe and effective in the treatment of severe nocturia in patients 65 years old
      and older.

TI  - Preliminary study of the safety and efficacy of extended-release oxybutynin in
      children.
PG  - 428-32
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To test the safety and efficacy of extended-release oxybutynin in
      children with bladder dysfunction. The efficacy of oxybutynin in children has
      been limited by side effects. A new extended-release formulation of oxybutynin
      has some benefits versus traditional oxybutynin but has never been evaluated in
      children. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on 25 children who had
      been treated with extended-release oxybutynin. Fourteen had neurogenic bladder
      dysfunction and 11 had urinary frequency and urgency and urge incontinence but no
      neurologic abnormalities. Patients and families were asked to semiquantitatively 
      (0 to 10 grading with 10 = severe) assess the effects of the medication on
      efficacy, as well as side effects and compliance with medication schedules.
      RESULTS: All 25 patients had improvement in incontinence and/or voiding
      dysfunction on extended-release oxybutynin. Twelve (48%) experienced no side
      effects. Of the 13 who did, 10 complained of dry mouth (grade 4.6 plus minus
      0.5), 4 had constipation (grade 5.8 plus minus 1.8), 4 had heat intolerance
      (grade 5.1 plus minus 0.9), and 3 had drowsiness (grade 5.3 plus minus 2.4). Of
      patients previously treated with oxybutynin, the extended-release oxybutynin was 
      equally or more efficacious and had the same or fewer side effects, especially
      less dry mouth. Families reported much better patient compliance with the
      medication regimen using extended-release oxybutynin compared with oxybutynin.
      Patient and family satisfaction was very high, and 21 of 25 have continued using 
      the medication. CONCLUSIONS: Extended-release oxybutynin is safe and efficacious 
      in children. In this preliminary evaluation, it had benefits over traditional,
      immediate-release oxybutynin.

TI  - Efficacy of botulinum-a toxin in children with detrusor hyperreflexia due to
      myelomeningocele: preliminary results.
PG  - 325-7; discussion 327-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The established treatment of children with neurogenic bladder
      consists of the use of anticholinergic drugs, such as oxybutynin and tolterodine,
      and clean intermittent catheterization four or five times a day. If
      anticholinergic drugs and clean intermittent catheterization fail, surgery is
      often necessary. With the intent of avoiding surgery, we investigated the effect 
      of botulinum-A toxin for treating detrusor hyperreflexia in this group of
      patients. METHODS: The subjects were 17 children (average age 10.8 years) who had
      detrusor hyperreflexia and were using clean intermittent catheterization four or 
      five times a day. Urodynamic studies were followed by injection of 85 to 300 U of
      botulinum-A toxin into 30 to 40 sites in the detrusor muscle. Urodynamic
      follow-up was done 2 to 4 weeks after injection. RESULTS: The mean reflex volume 
      increased by 112.1%, from 95.00 plus minus 34.54 mL (range 47 to 147) to 201.45
      plus minus 68.57 mL (range 77 to 310) (P <0.005). The maximal bladder capacity
      increased by 56.5%, from 137.53 plus minus 59.96 mL (range 59 to 242) to 215.25
      plus minus 96.36 mL (range 60 to 380) (P <0.005). The maximal detrusor pressure
      decreased by 32.6%, from 58.94 plus minus 32.32 cm H(2)O (range 19 to 149) to
      39.75 plus minus 26.12 cm H(2)O (range 7 to 100) (P <0.005). Detrusor compliance 
      increased by 121.6%, from 20.39 plus minus 26.5 mL/cm H(2)O (range 4.5 to 40) to 
      45.18 plus minus 45.4 mL/cm H(2)O (range 5.3 to 100) (P <0.01). CONCLUSIONS:
      Botulinum-A toxin injection into the hyperreflexive detrusor muscle seems to be
      very effective and might be a therapeutic alternative to anticholinergic drugs.

TI  - Evidence for the efficacy and safety of tolterodine in the treatment of
      overactive bladder.
PG  - 1685-701
AB  - Overactive bladder (OAB) is a chronic and prevalent condition, the symptoms of
      which (urinary frequency and urgency, with or without urge incontinence) can
      exert a profound negative effect on a person's daily life activities. Tolterodine
      (Detrol in North America and Detrusitol in the rest of the world, Pharmacia), a
      competitive muscarinic antagonist, is the first agent of this class to be
      specifically developed for the treatment of OAB. This agent displays in vivo
      functional selectivity for the bladder over other tissues that contain muscarinic
      receptors (e.g., salivary glands, eye), which translates into good efficacy and
      tolerability in patients with OAB (including the elderly). Comparative,
      randomised, double-blind studies show that tolterodine (administered as
      immediate-release [IR] tablets 2 mg b.i.d.) is as effective as oxybutynin (5 mg
      t.i.d.) in improving all of the troublesome symptoms of OAB but with a
      significantly lower incidence and severity of dry mouth. The advent of a new
      extended-release (ER) capsule formulation of tolterodine (4 mg) for convenient
      once-daily treatment builds upon these findings, with significantly improved
      efficacy for reducing urge incontinence episodes and a lower frequency of dry
      mouth relative to the existing IR tablet (2 mg b.i.d.). Tolterodine can therefore
      be considered a valuable, well-tolerated treatment option for patients with OAB, 
      providing improvements in symptoms that are both clinically meaningful to
      patients and sustained during long-term treatment.

TI  - [Continence problems after radical prostatectomy: medical treatment].
PG  - 157-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that a benefit can be obtained from both urine storage
      and urethral resistance after retropubic radical prostatectomy through the
      induction of artificial erections. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From January 1993 to
      December 2000 we have submitted 127 patients to radical retropubic prostatectomy.
      According to preoperative bladder behaviour, 59 patients (46.5%) presented
      voiding disorders, 10 (7.9%) filling disorders, 4 (3.1%) mixed disorders, whereas
      54 (42.5%) were asymptomatic. The urethral catheter was removed between the 10th 
      and the 12th postoperative day. Fourteen patients entered a programme of early
      sexual rehabilitation with intracavernous injection of prostaglandin E1 (ICI)
      within 7 days from catheter removal. RESULTS: After catheter removal the recovery
      of urinary continence occurred within 2.2 +/- 2.3 days. At dismissal from the
      hospital, 8 patients (6.2%) were almost totally incontinent; 2 (1.5%) were still 
      incontinent after a 6-month period; 73 (57.4%) were dismissed with clinical signs
      of detrusor instability hence treated with anticholinergic drugs such oxybutynin 
      or tolterodine; 3 (2.3%) resulted obstructed after surgery because of stenosis of
      the anastomosis. Almost all the patients submitted to early sexual rehabilitation
      referred an improvement of their incontinence after the first injection. The
      patients who did not begin an early sexual rehabilitation generally recovered
      from incontinence in a longer time. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary observations
      showed that artificial erection PGE1-induced is effective in improving or
      accelerating post radical prostatectomy incontinence recovery. The results apply 
      also to patients with pre-operatory detrusor instability.

TI  - Cost-Effectiveness of tolterodine for patients with urge incontinence who
      discontinue initial therapy with oxybutynin: a Canadian perspective.
PG  - 2038-49
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tolterodine is a novel muscarinic receptor antagonist for the
      treatment of overactive bladder. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to
      examine the cost-effectiveness of tolterodine for patients with urge incontinence
      (UI) who discontinue initial therapy with oxybutynin in a Canadian setting.
      METHODS: We compared 2 treatment strategies for the management of adult patients 
      with UI: (1) generic oxybutynin with no further treatment for patients who
      discontinue and (2) generic oxybutynin with switch to tolterodine (2 mg BID) for 
      patients who discontinue. We developed a 1-year Markov model (4-week cycle
      length) with transitions between disease states of normal, mild, moderate, and
      severe. Transition probabilities over 12 weeks were obtained from randomized
      trial data, and drug discontinuation rates were obtained from Quebec prescription
      claims data. Outcome measures were time in "normal" health state and
      quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) using EuroQol-5D utility scores from a survey
      of Swedish patients with overactive bladder. Costs to the health care payer and
      patient out-of-pocket costs (in Canadian dollars) were included. RESULTS: For
      patients who discontinue oxybutynin, the use of tolterodine is associated with
      approximately 6 months per year in a normal health or mild disease state,
      compared with approximately 3 months for those who do not receive further drug
      therapy after discontinuation. Tolterodine use resulted in an annual additional
      cost per patient of Can $163. The incremental cost per QALY was Can $9,982 and
      appeared to be robust to alternative model parameter assumptions. CONCLUSION: Use
      of tolterodine in patients with UI who discontinue initial therapy with generic
      oxybutynin lies within currently accepted benchmarks for cost-effectiveness.

TI  - Use of potentially inappropriate drugs in nursing homes.
PG  - 88-96
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To examine patterns and determine predictors of inappropriate
      drug use in nursing homes. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: One thousand
      four hundred ninety-two nursing homes in five states. PATIENTS: A total of 44,562
      residents admitted to nursing homes over 1 year. METHODS: Frequency of
      discontinuation and initiation of potentially inappropriate drugs over the first 
      90 days after admission to a nursing home was calculated. Data were collected
      using the minimum data set. RESULTS: On admission, 33% of residents were
      receiving at least one potentially inappropriate drug. After 90 days, the drug
      was discontinued in 16% of these residents. Of those not receiving a potentially 
      inappropriate drug on admission, one was begun in 18%. Demographic factors and
      number of drugs taken by patients were associated with the use of potentially
      inappropriate drugs. CONCLUSIONS; Use of potentially inappropriate drugs was
      prevalent on admission and at 90 days after admission. Discontinuation was
      highest among patients with conditions for which potentially safer therapeutic
      alternatives existed.

TI  - Tolterodine: an overview.
PG  - 312-8
AB  - Tolterodine has emerged as a new anticholinergic drug to treat detrusor
      instability in recent years. This substance and its major metabolite DD01 exhibit
      a favourable effect-to-side-effect ratio for the bladder. Several clinical
      studies demonstrated the drug's efficacy in reducing the symptoms of an
      overactive bladder (urgency, urge incontinence and high micturition frequency)
      and in increasing functional bladder volume. With a clinical effectiveness
      comparable to oxybutynin, the side effect-profile measures up favourably to
      oxybutynin. Consequently, though some limitations need to be addressed,
      tolterodine can be regarded as the drug of first choice to treat overactive
      bladders in a variety of patient groups: the young (and otherwise healthy), the
      elderly, as well as in patients with renal and hepatic insufficiency. A new
      extended release formula of tolterodine has been launched that may improve
      patients' compliance.

TI  - Which muscarinic receptor is important in the bladder?
PG  - 299-306
AB  - Antimuscarinic agents are the most widely used therapy for urge incontinence, but
      have side effects such as constipation, tachycardia and dry mouth, resulting from
      a lack of selectivity for the bladder. M2 receptors are the predominant
      cholinoceptors present in urinary bladder, but mainly the minor population of M3 
      receptors mediate its contraction. M2 receptors modulate detrusor contraction by 
      several mechanisms, and may contribute more to contraction of the bladder in
      pathological states such as bladder denervation or spinal cord injury.
      Prejunctional inhibitory M2 or M4 receptors and prejunctional facilitatory
      muscarinic Ml receptors in the bladder have all been reported. In clinical
      studies, tolterodine, a non-selective muscarinic antagonist, has been reported to
      be as effective as oxybutynin but inducing less dry mouth. Thus, although it is
      not certain which antimuscarinic drugs have the better efficacy and tolerability,
      the non-selective antimuscarinic drugs seem to be better than M3-selective
      antagonists in their clinical efficacies. However, controlled release, or
      intravesical, intravaginal, or rectal administrations of oxybutynin have been
      reported to cause fewer side effects. Darifenacin, a new M3 selective antagonist,
      has been reported to have selectivity for the bladder over the salivary gland in 
      vivo. To verify which antimuscarinic drugs selective for the muscarinic subtypes 
      have the best efficacy and tolerability, comparative clinical trials between M3
      selective antagonists and non-selective compounds, such as olterodine, are
      required in the future.

TI  - Urethral catheterization in hypospadias surgery: Should the device enter the
      bladder or be made a urethral stent?
PG  - 1829-31
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although bladder catheterization causes contractions, accidental
      removal and urinary retention are risks of stents in hypospadias repair. METHODS:
      An 8F feeding tube was used as a stent in 22 patients (group I). In the other 22 
      patients (group II), the same size catheter was passed into the bladder, and
      oxybutynin chloride was administered. The elapsed time to first voiding, pain,
      and straining was observed in group I and the groups were compared regarding time
      of catheter removal, accidental removal of catheter/stent, hospital stay, and
      complications. RESULTS: All stented patients strained at first voiding. Nineteen 
      showed pain, and only 5 voided in the first 8 hours. The catheterized group had
      no such problems. Time of catheter/stent removal and hospital stay were similar. 
      Three stents were dislodged in patients with significant straining. Meatal
      stricture was noticed in 5 and 3 patients and fistula in 5 and 2 patients of
      group I and II, respectively. Complications were significant in patients whose
      stents were removed accidentally. CONCLUSIONS: Stenting led to significant
      patient irritability with voiding problems. The authors believe that this caused 
      displacement and accidental removal of the stent and eventually resulted in
      meatal stenosis and fistula. The findings show that bladder catheterization
      prevents these complications. J Pediatr Surg 36:1829-1831.

TI  - The impact of non-compliance on the cost-effectiveness of pharmaceuticals: a
      review of the literature.
PG  - 601-15
AB  - Non-compliance with drug therapies not only limits their effectiveness, but in
      some instances, is associated with grave clinical sequelae and substantial
      economic burden. It is important, therefore, to consider non-compliance in
      economic evaluations. A review of pharmacoeconomic evaluations, which have
      applied sensitivity analysis to non-compliance rates, was undertaken to evaluate 
      the impact of non-compliance on the cost-effectiveness of different drug
      therapies. Although 22 evaluations satisfied the inclusion criteria, additional
      information was obtained from the authors of most studies, as the published
      details were inadequate. The majority of evaluations assumed altered
      effectiveness owing to reduced compliance in the absence of supportive clinical
      evidence. Because of the disparity in the nature of the outcomes, the measures of
      non-compliance and the time horizon of the studies evaluated, it was not possible
      to compare the magnitude of the impact of non-compliance among different
      drug-disease combinations. However, it was evident that non-compliance always
      results in a reduction in efficacy, but its impact on costs varied substantially.
      The importance of incorporating measures of compliance is highlighted, as failing
      to account for 'real world' compliance rates in pharmacoeconomic evaluations may 
      lead to selection of sub-optimal treatment strategies.

TI  - Motor imagery in Parkinson's disease: a PET study.
PG  - 849-57
AB  - We used positron emission tomography (PET) with 15O-labelled water to record
      patterns of cerebral activation in six patients with Parkinson's disease (PD),
      studied when clinically "off" and after turning "on" as a result of dopaminergic 
      stimulation. They were asked to imagine a finger opposition movement performed
      with their right hand, externally paced at a rate of 1 Hz. Trials alternating
      between motor imagery and rest were measured. A pilot study of three age-matched 
      controls was also performed. We chose the task as a robust method of activating
      the supplementary motor area (SMA), defects of which have been reported in PD.
      The PD patients showed normal degrees of activation of the SMA (proper) when both
      "off" and "on." Significant activation with imagining movement also occurred in
      the ipsilateral inferior parietal cortex (both "off" and when "on") and
      ipsilateral premotor cortex (when "off" only). The patients showed significantly 
      greater activation of the rostral anterior cingulate and significantly less
      activation of the left lingual gyrus and precuneus when performing the task "on" 
      compared with their performance when "off." PD patients when imagining movement
      and "off" showed less activation of several sites including the right
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) when compared to the controls performing
      the same task. No significant differences from controls were present when the
      patients imagined when "on." Our results are consistent with other studies
      showing deficits of pre-SMA function in PD with preserved function of the SMA
      proper. In addition to the areas of reduced activation (anterior cingulate,
      DLPFC), there were also sites of activation (ipsilateral premotor and inferior
      parietal cortex) previously reported as locations of compensatory overactivity
      for PD patients performing similar tasks. Both failure of activation and
      compensatory changes are likely to contribute to the motor deficit in PD.

TI  - Prescription-event monitoring and reporting of adverse drug reactions.
PG  - 1872-3
AB  - Newly marketed drugs in the UK are marked with a black triangle, indicating that 
      doctors should report all adverse drug reactions associated with them to the
      Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM). However, under-reporting of adverse
      reactions is frequent. Our aim was to establish what types of adverse reactions
      are under-reported to the CSM by family doctors who work in England. We used
      prescription-event monitoring data obtained for 15 newly marketed drugs. Only 9% 
      (376) of 4211 events found on prescription-event monitoring were reported to the 
      CSM. However, 53% (27) of 51 events classified as serious adverse drug reactions 
      were reported. Overall, serious events were five times more likely to be reported
      to the CSM than non-serious events. Our results should not be extrapolated to
      calculate incidence rates of adverse drug reactions in the community from
      spontaneous reports.

TI  - Identification of muscarinic receptor subtypes of cultured smooth muscle cells
      and tissue of human bladder body.
PG  - 557-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: Muscarinic receptor subtypes of cultured smooth muscle cells from the
      human bladder body were investigated by the receptor binding assay method. The
      result was compared with that obtained from the human bladder body tissue to
      confirm whether the receptor subtypes of the cells are not changed after several 
      passages of cell culture. METHODS: Inhibitory effects of various muscarinic
      antagonists on the binding of [3H]-N-methylscopolamine ([3H]-NMS) to membrane
      preparations obtained from cultured smooth muscle cells from the fourth
      subculture of the human bladder body were compared with those prepared from the
      human bladder body tissue and cells expressing human muscarinic receptor
      subtypes. RESULTS: Binding-inhibition constants (pKi) for atropine, pirenzepine, 
      methoctramine, 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide (4-DAMP),
      oxybutynin and propiverine obtained from membrane preparations of cultured smooth
      muscle cells were 8.91, 6.35, 8.24, 8.53, 7.29 and 5.61, respectively. pKi values
      of these muscarinic receptor antagonists against the membrane preparation of
      human bladder body tissue were 9.08, 6.66, 8.05, 8.79, 7.53 and 6.04,
      respectively. pKi values of cultured smooth muscle cells and tissue from human
      bladder body were correlated closely with those of insect cells expressing the
      cloned human M2 receptor subtype. CONCLUSION: The binding affinities for various 
      muscarinic receptor antagonists of cultured human smooth muscle cells were
      maintained through the fourth subculture and it was suggested that the M2
      receptor subtype is predominantly expressed in cultured smooth muscle cells of
      human bladder body as well as in tissue of the human bladder body.

TI  - Potentially inappropriate medication use in the community-dwelling elderly:
      findings from the 1996 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey.
PG  - 2823-9
AB  - CONTEXT: Inappropriate medication use is a major patient safety concern,
      especially for the elderly population. Using explicit criteria, prior studies
      have found that 23.5% and 17.5% of the US community-dwelling elderly population
      used at least 1 of 20 potentially inappropriate medications in 1987 and 1992,
      respectively. OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of potentially
      inappropriate medication use in community-dwelling elderly persons in 1996, to
      assess trends over 10 years, categorize inappropriate medication use according to
      explicit criteria, and to examine risk factors for inappropriate medication use. 
      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Respondents aged 65 years or older (n = 2455) 
      to the 1996 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, a nationally representative survey 
      of the US noninstitutionalized population were included. A 7-member expert panel 
      was convened to categorize inappropriate medications. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE:
      Prevalence of use of 33 potentially inappropriate medications. RESULTS: In 1996, 
      21.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 19.5%-23.1%) of community-dwelling elderly
      patients in the United States received at least 1 of 33 potentially inappropriate
      medications. Using the expert panel's classifications, about 2.6% of elderly
      patients (95% CI, 2.0%-3.2%) used at least 1 of the 11 medications that should
      always be avoided by elderly patients; 9.1% (95% CI, 7.9%-10.3%) used at least 1 
      of the 8 that would rarely be appropriate; and 13.3% (95% CI, 11.7%-14.9%) used
      at least 1 of the 14 medications that have some indications but are often
      misused. Use of some inappropriate medications declined between 1987 and 1996.
      Persons with poor health and more prescriptions had a significantly higher risk
      of inappropriate medication use. CONCLUSIONS: Overall inappropriate medication
      use in elderly patients remains a serious problem. Despite challenges in using
      explicit criteria for assessing inappropriate medications for elderly patients,
      such criteria can be applied to population-based surveys to identify
      opportunities to improve quality of care and patient safety. Enhancements of
      existing data sources to include dosage, duration, and indication may augment
      national improvement and monitoring efforts.

TI  - Role of urethrocystoscopy in the evaluation of refractory idiopathic detrusor
      instability.
PG  - 544-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the role of diagnostic urethrocystoscopy in the evaluation 
      of women with idiopathic detrusor instability (DI) refractory to conventional
      pharmacologic management. METHODS: One hundred consecutive women (mean age 62.1
      +/- 15.1 years) with idiopathic DI refractory to conventional pharmacologic
      management were prospectively enrolled. All patients underwent a meticulous
      evaluation, including a detailed history, urogynecologic questionnaire,
      micturition diary and pad test, urinalysis and culture, physical examination, and
      urodynamic studies. Refractory DI was defined as the lack of clinical improvement
      after at least 6 months of conventional drug therapy. These patients underwent
      additional evaluation with diagnostic urethrocystoscopy. RESULTS: All patients
      had a normal urinalysis and negative cytologic findings. Diagnostic
      urethrocystoscopy revealed isolated bladder tuberculosis in one and transitional 
      cell carcinoma in another. Seven other patients had bladder diverticula (only one
      of which was also diagnosed by sonographic examination) and 22 had
      mild-to-moderate bladder trabeculations. CONCLUSIONS: The absence of other
      alarming signs (ie, recurrent urinary tract infection, hematuria, significant
      residual urinary volume, positive cytologic findings, or suspicious sonographic
      findings) cannot confirm the lack of significant lower urinary tract
      abnormalities among patients with refractory DI. Diagnostic urethrocystoscopy, a 
      simple and safe office procedure, facilitates timely diagnosis and appropriate
      treatment for these patients.

TI  - Glatiramer acetate induces a Th2-biased response and crossreactivity with myelin 
      basic protein in patients with MS.
PG  - 209-19
AB  - Glatiromer acetate (GA) is an approved treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS). The
      proposed mechanism of action is the induction of GA-specific T cells
      characterized by protective anti-inflammatory Th2 response. We tested this
      hypothesis in 11 MS patients treated with GA from 1-19 months. Interferon-gamma
      and IL-5 (markers of Th1 and Th2 responses respectively) were assayed by ELISA in
      GA-specific T-cell lines (TCL) supernatants. Th1/Th2 bias was defined based on
      the ratio of IFN-gamma/IL-5 secretion. Fifty-eight pre-treatment and 75
      on-treatment GA-specific TCL were generated. On-treatment mean IL-5 levels in
      GA-TCL increased significantly, whereas those for IFN-gamma were markedly
      reduced. Consequently, the ratio of IFN-gamma IL-5 also shifted in favor of a Th2
      response. The percentage of GA-TCL classified as Th1 was decreased, whereas those
      classified as Th2 increased on-treatment as compared to pre-treatment. Some
      GA-specific TCL, (approximately 25%) generated during treatment secreted
      predominantly IL-5 in response to MBP and the immunodominant MBP peptide 83-99,
      indicating that these crossreactive antigens can act as partial agonists for
      GA-reactive TCL. These results strongly suggest that the mechanism of action of
      GA in MS involves the induction of crossreactive GA-specific T cells with a
      predominant Th2 cytokine profile.

TI  - Changing concepts concerning the management of vesicoureteral reflux.
PG  - 1439-43
AB  - PURPOSE: Conservative estimates indicate that up to 54% of patients who present
      with vesicoureteral reflux have dysfunction voiding. Children with voiding
      dysfunction and vesicoureteral reflux historically have a high breakthrough
      infection rate of 34% to 43%. Breakthrough infection represents significant
      morbidity and it is the most common indication for surgical intervention for
      vesicoureteral reflux. Voiding dysfunction is present in 79% of patients who
      proceed to reflux surgery. We evaluated the impact of pelvic floor muscle
      retraining combined with a medical program in patients with voiding dysfunction
      and vesicoureteral reflux. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Children with a history
      consistent with voiding dysfunction and vesicoureteral reflux were screened by
      uroflowmetry/electromyography, bladder scan for post-void residual urine, renal
      ultrasound and voiding cystourethrography. Confirmed cases of voiding dysfunction
      and vesicoureteral reflux were prospectively enrolled in this study. Children
      participated in an interactive, computer assisted, pelvic floor muscle retraining
      program that involved a conservative medical regimen and pelvic floor muscle
      retraining. All patients received prophylactic antibiotics. We evaluated the rate
      of breakthrough urinary tract infection, reflux outcome and surgical
      intervention. A literature review with the key words vesicoureteral reflux,
      voiding dysfunction and urinary tract infection was performed to identify
      historical control cases for comparison. RESULTS: Study enrollment criteria were 
      fulfilled by 49 girls and 4 boys 4 to 13 years old (average age 8.8),
      representing 72 units with low grades I to II (48) and high grades III to V (24) 
      reflux. Mean followup was 24 months. Initial uroflowmetry/electromyography and
      bladder scan revealed a staccato flow pattern and normal post-void residual urine
      in 11% of cases, staccato flow pattern and elevated post-void residual urine in
      10%, flattened flow pattern and normal post-void residual urine in 28%, and
      flattened flow pattern and elevated post-void residual urine in 51%. Breakthrough
      infection developed in 5 patients (10%), including 1 in whom reflux had resolved 
      and 1 with grade I reflux who underwent observation. The parents of 2 patients
      elected to complete biofeedback without surgical intervention and these patients 
      did not have a repeat infection. Reimplantation was performed in 1 case (2%).
      There was resolution in 18 low and 7 high grade refluxing units, including 2
      older patients with a long history of high grade bilateral disease. Average time 
      to resolution was 7.8 months. We noted elevated post-void residual urine in 88%
      of the patients with high grade reflux. Average age at resolution was 9.2 years. 
      During a 24-month period one of us (P. H. M.) noted a greater than 90% decrease
      in surgical intervention. CONCLUSIONS: A combined conservative medical and
      computer game assisted pelvic floor muscle retraining program appears to have
      decreased the incidence of breakthrough urinary tract infections and facilitated 
      reflux resolution in children with voiding dysfunction and vesicoureteral reflux.
      Patients with high grade reflux and voiding dysfunction commonly present with
      elevated post-void residual urine, contraindicating the indiscriminate
      administration of anticholinergics. Decreasing the rate of urinary tract
      infections may have a dramatic impact on the need for surgical intervention and
      enable the reflux resolution rate to approximate that in patients without voiding
      dysfunction. Prospective controlled trials are needed to determine whether pelvic
      floor muscle retraining combined with a conservative medical regimen alters the
      natural history of vesicoureteral reflux in patients with voiding dysfunction.

TI  - Automatic orienting of visuospatial attention in Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 1240-9
AB  - The basal ganglia are involved in not only motor behavior, but also other more
      cognitive processes, such as attention. We tested Parkinson's disease (PD)
      patients in a task that measures reflexive orienting of spatial attention. Seven 
      patients with idiopathic PD and eight control subjects performed a covert
      orienting task where spatial attention was directed by means of exogenous cues
      (luminance increments) with no predictive validity for target position. The
      subjects' task was to make a speeded saccade to a visual target, which appeared a
      variable time after onset of the cue either in the cued or an uncued spatial
      position. There was no overall difference between PD patients and control
      subjects in terms of the initial facilitation following reflexive cues, and later
      inhibition of return (IOR). However, PD patients differed from control subjects
      in two important respects. First, they were significantly faster than were
      control subjects on this reflexive visual-orienting task. Second, disease
      severity correlated with attentional performance; more advanced patients showed
      less initial facilitation but greater IOR. Thus PD patients show better
      performance on a reflexive saccade task and, for more advanced patients, greater 
      IOR than control subjects. These findings are consistent with the possibility
      that reflexive attentional processes in PD patients may be more active.

TI  - Managing incontinence due to detrusor instability.
PG  - 59-64
AB  - Urinary incontinence affects around 3.5 million people of all ages in the UK. For
      many, incontinence severely restricts their routine activities and damages their 
      quality of life and self-esteem. In about one-third of women sufferers, and
      around a half of all men with incontinence, the cause is detrusor instability.
      This condition is characterised by involuntary bladder contractions or pressure
      rises during bladder filling, which result in a strong or uncontrollable urge to 
      pass urine and, often, incontinence. Here, we consider a primary care-based
      approach to managing urinary incontinence in adults, concentrating on the medical
      management of detrusor instability.

TI  - Combined pharmacotherapy for nocturnal enuresis.
PG  - 662-4
AB  - Nocturnal enuresis is a common childhood disorder. Tricyclic antidepressants and 
      anticholinergic agents have been the well accepted pharmacological treatment for 
      this disorder and are efficacious in 40-70% and 10-50% of cases, respectively.
      The present study was performed to evaluate the effect of a combined treatment of
      tricyclic antidepressant and an anticholinergic agent. Twenty-two children aged
      6-12 years with primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis who did not prefer to 
      use a conditioning alarm were given a combined treatment of these drugs. After a 
      control period of 1 month, each patient was treated for 6 months and then
      observed for 3 months. A 30-mg dose of amitriptyline or imipramine was given with
      either 2-4 mg oxybutinin or 10-20 mg propiverine. Efficacy was determined
      relative to the number of wet nights per week compared with the control period,
      with more than a 50% decrease in wet nights per week taken to indicate efficacy. 
      The mean wet nights per week decreased from 6.1 to 1.7 (P<0.01), and efficacy was
      established in 20 patients (90.9%). Relapses occurred in 60.0% of patients during
      the follow-up period. No significant side effects were observed. The efficacy of 
      the combined therapy in monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis appears to be greater 
      than that reported for either drug alone, and therefore can be a choice of
      treatment in order to motivate children with nocturnal enuresis.

TI  - Encephalocraniocutaneous lipomatosis associated with iris coloboma,
      chorioretinitis and spinal cord involvement: a case report.
PG  - 355-8
AB  - A 9-year-old boy with a history of lipoma excision and laminectomy at the Th10-11
      levels, resulting in incomplete paraparesis and neurogenic bladder, was admitted 
      for a comprehensive rehabilitation programme. Physical examination revealed an
      ipsilateral focal dermal hypoplastic defect within an area of alopecia and a
      subcutaneous lipomatous tissue on the left temporo-parietal region of the scalp. 
      Iris coloboma and chorioretinitis were diagnosed on the left eye. He also had
      mild mental retardation and triparesis. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain
      and the spine demonstrated hyperintense masses which were consistent with lipoma.
      Although in the literature three cases of encephalocraniocutaneous lipomatosis
      (ECCL) concomitant with spinal cord involvement have been reported, to our
      knowledge iris coloboma and chorioretinitis in ECCL have not been reported
      previously. In conclusion, we would like to stress that aside from known
      ophthalmological malformations, iris coloboma and chorioretinitis may also be
      observed in ECCL and that all patients who have been diagnosed as having ECCL
      should be examined for spinal cord involvement.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of the R- and S-enantiomers of oxybutynin and
      N-desethyloxybutynin following oral and transdermal administration of the
      racemate in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 1029-34
AB  - PURPOSE: To characterize the enantiomers of oxybutynin (OXY) and
      N-desethyloxybutynin (DEO) following transdermal and oral administration.
      METHODS: OXY was administered either as a single transdermal system over a 96 h
      wear period or as a single 5 mg immediate-release tablet to 18 healthy male and
      female subjects in a randomized, open-label, two-way crossover design. Blood
      samples were collected for 108 h after application of the transdermal system and 
      for 6 h after oral administration. Plasma concentrations of the R- and
      S-enantiomers of OXY and DEO were assayed by LC-MS/MS. Enantiomer in vitro skin
      flux was evaluated using human cadaver skin. RESULTS: In vitro skin flux studies 
      demonstrated equal absorption of R and S- OXY. Plasma concentrations and
      pharmacokinetic parameters of the R-enantiomers of OXY and DEO were slightly
      lower than the S-enantiomers following transdermal OXY. The relative AUC values
      were S-OXY>S-DEO>R-OXY>R-DEO. The AUC ratios of DEO/ OXY were less than 1 for
      both the R- and S- enantiomers. Following oral dosing, plasma DEO concentrations 
      greatly exceeded OXY resulting in relative AUC values of R-DEO>S-DEO>S-OXY>R-OXY.
      The mean AUC ratios of S- and R-DEO/OXY were 3.25 and 8.93, respectively.
      CONCLUSIONS: Stereoselective metabolism of OXY was evident following both
      transdermal and oral administration of OXY. The reduced pre-systemic metabolism
      of transdermally administered OXY compared to oral administration resulted in not
      only significantly lower DEO plasma concentrations, but also a different
      metabolite pattern. The differences between R-OXY and R-DEO following the two
      routes of administration support the potential for comparable clinical efficacy
      and reduced anticholinergic side-effects with transdermal treatment.

TI  - Failure of tolterodine to treat clozapine-induced nocturnal enuresis.
PG  - 867-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report the use and subsequent failure of the bladder-selective
      agent tolterodine, to treat clozapine-induced nocturnal enuresis in an adolescent
      patient with psychotic illness. CASE SUMMARY: A 16-year-old Hispanic girl was
      admitted to the state psychiatric hospital with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder
      with psychotic features. Clozapine therapy was initiated, and after three months 
      of treatment the patient began experiencing episodes of nocturnal enuresis. The
      bladder-selective agent tolterodine was tried and subsequently failed to resolve 
      the enuresis episodes. Desmopressin was initiated, which resulted in amelioration
      of symptoms. DISCUSSION: This is the first published report of using tolterodine 
      to treat clozapine-induced nocturnal enuresis. Several methods to decrease
      clozapine-induced urinary incontinence have been used and typically include the
      addition of agents with high anticholinergic properties. Tolterodine is a
      bladder-selective anticholinergic agent indicated for the treatment of urinary
      urge incontinence and may be employed as a treatment for antipsychotic-induced
      incontinence. CONCLUSIONS: Nocturnal enuresis is an adverse effect that
      infrequently occurs with use of clozapine therapy. Although tolterodine was
      ineffective in our patient to treat clozapine-induced nocturnal enuresis, further
      trials are required to appropriately evaluate the effectiveness of tolterodine to
      treat this adverse drug reaction.

TI  - Twelve-month treatment of overactive bladder: efficacy and tolerability of
      tolterodine.
PG  - 551-60
AB  - CONTEXT: Tolterodine is a bladder-selective antimuscarinic agent designed for the
      treatment of overactive bladder. Traditional antimuscarinic therapies are poorly 
      tolerated due to a high incidence of anticholinergic adverse events and
      consequently few patients remain on long term therapy. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the
      long term efficacy and tolerability of tolterodine in patients with symptoms of
      overactive bladder. DESIGN: Twelve-month open-label extension of 4 randomised,
      placebo-controlled, double-blind, multinational, multicentre trials of 4 weeks'
      duration. PATIENTS: 714 patients (aged 18 to 92 years) with symptoms of
      overactive bladder who completed the double-blind portion of the studies.
      INTERVENTION: Tolterodine 2 mg twice daily for up to 12 months. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURES: Micturition diary variables: number of micturitions per 24 hours,
      number of urge incontinence episodes per 24 hours, mean urine volume voided per
      micturition. Safety variables: adverse events, study discontinuation rate.
      RESULTS: A total of 441 patients (62%) completed 12 months' open-label treatment 
      with tolterodine, which significantly reduced the number of micturitions per 24
      hours [mean change -2.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.7 to -2.2, median change
      -20%, p < 0.0001] and number of urge incontinence episodes per 24 hours (mean
      change -1.3, 95% CI -1.6 to -1.0, median change -74%, p < 0.0001), while the mean
      volume voided per micturition was significantly increased (+33 ml, 95% CI +28 to 
      +38, median change +18%; p < 0.0001). 41% of patients reported dry mouth (27%
      mild, 10% moderate, 3% severe). Dosage reduction to 1 mg twice daily was required
      in 23% of patients. 15% of patients withdrew from the study due to adverse
      events, with 5% having associated dry mouth. CONCLUSIONS: The high percentage of 
      patients completing 12 months' treatment indicates that tolterodine is an
      effective and well tolerated agent for long term treatment of overactive bladder.

      receptor ligands presently used as therapeutics. The extensive development of
      muscarinic M(1) receptor agonists for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction has 
      culminated in a series of unsuccessful drug candidates, which reflects a lack of 
      understanding of the disease and the role played by muscarinic cholinergic
      transmission. Paradoxically, the most successful antagonist approved for use in
      urinary incontinence is the nonselective muscarinic receptor antagonist
      tolterodine. This deficit in subtype-selective ligands could be circumvented by
      the development of transgenic mice, each lacking functional M(1), M(2), M(3),
      M(4) or M(5) receptors. In this article, the current status of muscarinic
      receptor research is critically assessed.

TI  - Effects of tolterodine, trospium chloride, and oxybutynin on the central nervous 
      system.
PG  - 636-44
AB  - Antimuscarinic compounds are increasingly used to treat the symptoms of
      overactive bladder; however, their use is often restricted by peripheral adverse 
      effects (AEs). On the other hand, data regarding their influence on the central
      nervous system (CNS) are limited. This randomized, single-blind, parallel-group
      quantitative-topographical EEG (qEEG) study of clinical phase I investigates the 
      potential CNS adverse effects of the three antimuscarinic drugs--tolterodine,
      oxybutynin, and trospium chloride--in comparison to placebo. Overall, 4 x 16
      (total 64) young, healthy male volunteers were included in the study. The
      subjects were given either placebo or the clinically recommended daily doses of
      the drugs dispensed in three doses on a single day (tolterodine 2 mg bid and once
      placebo, total 4 mg/d; oxybutynin 5 mg tid, total 15 mg/d; and trospium chloride 
      15 mg tid, total 45 mg/d). The qEEG was recorded prior to and up to 4 hours after
      each intake of the trial medication (a total of 10 qEEG sessions) under three
      different conditions: at rest with eyes open, eyes closed, and under mental
      demand. The drug tolerability was subjectively evaluated by the volunteer and the
      investigator. In comparison to placebo (10% confidence interval), tolterodine and
      trospium chloride did not induce changes of the qEEG power in five of the six
      frequency bands (i.e., delta, alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1, and beta 2). Isolated
      power decreases were only observed in the theta frequency band. In contrast,
      oxybutynin caused significant power reductions in four frequency bands (theta,
      alpha 1, alpha 2, and beta 1; p < 0.01). The subjectively evaluated drug
      tolerability was comparable between all treatment groups, although differences in
      the AE occurrence existed, with the AE frequency being higher in the oxybutynin
      group. The results of this study support the findings that oxybutynin as a
      tertiary amine crosses the blood-brain barrier, causing significant qEEG activity
      changes and more pronounced central adverse effects. Although tolterodine is also
      a tertiary amine, it shows limited effects on qEEG activity (i.e., slight theta
      power reductions), comparable to the effects of trospium chloride, a quarternary 
      amine, which barely crosses the blood-brain barrier. The minimal qEEG changes
      observed with tolterodine and trospium chloride reflect most probably a rebound
      message from the peripheral target organs. Prescription of oxybutynin thus
      implicates a higher risk of CNS side effects.

TI  - Clinical experiences with tolterodine.
PG  - 2549-56
AB  - Tolterodine is the first muscarinic receptor antagonist that has been
      specifically developed for the treatment of overactive bladder. The objectives in
      the discovery program were to design a potent muscarinic receptor antagonist that
      is equipotent to oxybutynin in the bladder, but less potent in salivary glands,
      with the aim of improving tolerability (less dry mouth) in patients with
      overactive bladder. Tolterodine is non-selective with respect to the muscarinic
      M1-M5 receptor subtypes, but has a greater effect on the bladder than on salivary
      glands in vivo, in both animals and humans. Clinical results show that the
      efficacy and safety of tolterodine in overactive bladder is equal to that of
      oxybutynin, but that tolterodine is significantly better tolerated by the
      patients.

TI  - A semiparametric deconvolution model to establish in vivo-in vitro correlation
      applied to OROS oxybutynin.
PG  - 702-12
AB  - In vitro-in vivo correlation (IVIVC) models may be used to predict in vivo drug
      concentration-time profiles given in vitro release characteristics of a drug.
      This prediction is accomplished by incorporating in vitro release characteristics
      as an input function (A(vitro)) to a pharmacokinetics model. This simple approach
      often results in biased predictions of observed in vivo drug concentrations, and 
      it can result in rejecting IVIVC. To solve this problem we propose a population
      IVIVC model that incorporates the in vitro information and allows one to quantify
      possibly changed in vivo release characteristic. The model assumes linear
      kinetics and describes the in vivo release as a sum of A(vitro) and a
      nonparametric function (A(d), a spline) representing the difference in release
      due to in vivo conditions. The function A(vitro) and its variability enter the
      model as a prior distribution. The function A(d) is estimated together with its
      intersubject variability. The number of parameters associated with A(d) defines
      the model: no parameters indicates perfect IVIVC, a large number of parameters
      indicates poor IVIVC. The number of parameters is determined using statistical
      model selection criteria. We demonstrate the approach to solve the IVIVC problem 
      of an oral extended release oxybutynin form (OROS), administered in three
      pharmacokinetic studies. These studies present a particular challenging case;
      that is, the relative bioavailability for the OROS administration is >100%
      compared with that of the immediate-release form. The result of our modeling
      shows that the apparent lack of IVIVC can be overcome: in vivo concentration can 
      be predicted (within or across data sets) based on in vitro release rate together
      with a simple form of systematic deviation from the in vitro release.

PG  - 674-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the incidence of side-effects of oral and intravesical
      oxybutynin chloride in children with meningomyelocele (MMC) and a neurogenic
      bladder. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study comprised 225 children with a neurogenic
      bladder from MMC who were evaluated with urodynamic testing and voiding
      cysto-urethrography to identify those at high risk of upper tract damage. In all,
      101 children (mean age 4.2 years, range 0.25-10) had unco-ordinated
      detrusor-sphincter function and low compliance; they were treated with either
      oral or intravesical oxybutynin and clean intermittent catheterization. RESULTS: 
      Of the 101 patients, 67 were treated with oral oxybutynin; in 11 the treatment
      was discontinued because of the side-effects. The other 34 patients used both
      clean intermittent catheterization and intravesical oxybutynin. In this group
      there were side-effects in six patients, including drowsiness, hallucinations and
      cognitive changes. CONCLUSIONS: Oral and intravesical oxybutynin is effective for
      managing neurogenic bladder dysfunction, but intravesical administration is safer
      and better tolerated than oral oxybutynin in the treatment of children with MMC. 
      However, adverse effects such as cognitive impairment can also occur in children 
      treated with intravesical oxybutynin and these patients must be closely monitored
      because these effects may differ from those with oral administration.

TI  - Tolterodine: a review of its use in the treatment of overactive bladder.
PG  - 277-304
AB  - Tolterodine is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist that shows in vivo
      selectivity for the bladder over the salivary glands compared with oxybutinin.
      Results of randomised double-blind placebo-controlled studies indicate that
      tolterodine 4 mg/day (administered as immediate-release tablets 2mg twice daily
      or extended-release capsules 4mg daily) is superior to placebo in improving
      micturition diary variables in patients with overactive bladder. Moreover,
      tolterodine 2mg twice daily is as effective as oxybutynin 5mg 3 times daily.
      Maximum treatment effects with both drugs occurred after 5 to 8 weeks of
      treatment and improvements were maintained during long term treatment for up to
      24 months. In a pooled analysis of four 12-week studies, equivalent and
      significant reductions in micturition frequency (-2.3 and -2.0 vs -1.4, p <
      0.001) and the incidence of urge incontinence episodes (-1.6 and -1.8 vs -1.1, p 
      < 0.05) were reported for tolterodine 2mg twice daily and oxybutynin 5mg 3 times 
      daily compared with placebo. Functional bladder capacity was also significantly
      increased. Improvements in patient perceptions of their urgency symptoms and of
      problems caused by their bladder condition were significantly greater during
      treatment with tolterodine than with placebo. Tolterodine was generally well
      tolerated in clinical trials of up to 24 months' duration. Dry mouth was the most
      frequent adverse event. The incidence (40 vs 78%, p < 0.001) and intensity of
      this event was lower with tolterodine 2mg twice daily than oxybutynin 5mg 3 times
      daily. Additionally, a 23% lower incidence of dry mouth was reported with once
      daily extended-release tolterodine capsules than with twice daily
      immediate-release tablets (p < 0.02). The incidence of adverse CNS events with
      tolterodine was low and similar to that of placebo. Tolterodine was well
      tolerated in elderly patients and no serious tolerability concerns were
      identified. CONCLUSION: Tolterodine is the first antimuscarinic agent to
      specifically developed for the treatment of overactive bladder. The functional
      selectivity of tolterodine for the bladder translates into good efficacy and
      tolerability in patients, including the elderly, with overactive bladder.
      Tolterodine is as effective as oxybutynin in improving micturition diary
      variables but is associated with a significantly lower incidence and intensity of
      dry mouth. This favourable tolerability profile, together with sustained clinical
      efficacy during long term treatment, places tolterodine as valuable treatment for
      the symptoms of overactive bladder.

TI  - Economics of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in older people.
PG  - 213-23
AB  - Urinary incontinence is an area of clinical and social importance to older people
      and providers of care. This article provides an update on the 'symptom' of
      urinary incontinence and reviews the concept of lower urinary tract symptoms
      (LUTS). The challenges facing health services researchers working in this field
      are also discussed in terms of trying to quantify the size and extent of the
      underlying problem. Economic issues and work undertaken to evaluate the cost of
      LUTS are appraised and the common nonsurgical treatments for LUTS are described
      together with associated conditions and their cost implications. The cost to
      individuals and society of LUTS is generally underestimated and the importance of
      reducing its severity (if cure is not achievable) makes clinical and economic
      sense.

TI  - The overactive bladder in children: a potential future indication for
      tolterodine.
PG  - 569-74
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of tolterodine 
      in children with an overactive bladder. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-three
      children (20 boys and 13 girls, aged 5-10 years) with an overactive bladder and
      symptoms of urgency, frequency and/or urge incontinence were enrolled in an open,
      dose-escalation study. Patients were treated with oral tolterodine 0.5 mg (n =
      11), 1 mg (n = 10) or 2 mg (n = 12) twice daily for 14 days. The primary safety
      endpoint was the change in residual urinary volume, as determined by
      ultrasonography. In addition, voiding diary variables (frequency and incontinence
      episodes) and pharmacokinetics were evaluated. Other safety endpoints included
      laboratory variables, electrocardiogram recordings and reported adverse events.
      RESULTS: There were no safety concerns in terms of the change in residual urinary
      volume for any of the three dosage groups; values were comparable with baseline
      after 2 weeks of treatment for all three dosages. Adverse events were reported by
      20 patients (six on 0.5 mg, five on 1 mg, and nine on 2 mg). Most adverse events 
      were not considered to be drug-related; of the 13 possibly related events, 10
      occurred in those taking 2 mg. Headache was the most commonly reported adverse
      event. No serious adverse events were reported and there were no general safety
      concerns. There was an improvement in voiding diary variables in all treatment
      groups after 2 weeks of treatment, although the efficacy was greatest in those
      taking 1 mg and 2 mg. Pharmacokinetic findings were consistent with dose
      linearity over the range 0.5-2 mg. CONCLUSION: The results support the use of 1
      mg twice daily as the optimal dose of tolterodine for treating children aged 5-10
      years with an overactive bladder.

TI  - Use of tolterodine in children with dysfunctional voiding: an initial report.
PG  - 926-8
AB  - PURPOSE: Tolterodine was recently approved for the treatment of incontinence and 
      overactive bladder in adults, and has fewer side effects than oxybutynin. We
      evaluated the safety and efficacy of tolterodine in children with dysfunctional
      voiding. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed our experience with
      30 pediatric patients treated with tolterodine for a primary diagnosis of
      dysfunctional voiding. Patients were treated with adult doses of tolterodine and 
      behavioral modifications. Standard definitions determined by the International
      Children's Continence Society were adapted to designate final treatment outcomes 
      on medication as cured-greater than 90% reduction in wetting episodes,
      improved-greater than 50% reduction or failed-less than 50% reduction. RESULTS:
      The children were 4 to 17 years old (mean age 8.7) and were treated with
      tolterodine for an average of 5.2 months. The final dose was 1 mg. twice daily in
      1, 2 mg. twice daily in 27 and 4 mg. twice daily in 2 patients. Wetting episodes 
      were cured in 10 (33%), improved in 12 (40%), and failed to show improvement in 8
      (27%) cases. Four patients (13.3%) reported side effects and only 1 discontinued 
      the medication due to diarrhea. There were no reports of hyperpyrexia, flushing
      or intolerance to sunshine and outdoor temperature. CONCLUSIONS: Our results
      demonstrate that tolterodine at adult doses without titration can be used safely 
      to decrease wetting episodes in children with dysfunctional voiding. Controlled
      clinical trials should be completed to evaluate further efficacy and safety in
      children.

TI  - Intravesical electromotive administration of oxybutynin in patients with detrusor
      hyperreflexia unresponsive to standard anticholinergic regimens.
PG  - 491-8
AB  - PURPOSE: About 15% to 20% of patients with detrusor hyperreflexia do not benefit 
      from oral oxybutynin regimens, frequently because of unpleasant side effects.
      Several reports indicate that intravesical oxybutynin is effective in many of
      these patients but there are some who still fail to respond. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: A select group of 10 adults with detrusor hyperreflexia unresponsive to 
      standard oral and intravesical oxybutynin regimens were treated at weekly
      intervals with 5 mg. oxybutynin orally, or 5 mg. oxybutynin in 100 ml.
      intravesically for 60 minutes of passive diffusion and for 30 minutes with 5 mA. 
      electrical current. Each treatment (plus oral placebo and 2 intravesical
      controls) was associated with an 8-hour, full urodynamic monitoring session, and 
      periodic blood and bladder content sampling. RESULTS: There was no significant
      objective improvement with oral or intravesical passive diffusion oxybutynin.
      Conversely there was significant improvement in 5 of 6 objective urodynamic
      measurements with intravesical electromotive oxybutynin. Plasma profiles were a
      single peak and decay following oral oxybutynin and 2 distinct peaks with
      intravesical passive diffusion and electromotive oxybutynin. Area under the curve
      for intravesical passive diffusion were 709 ng. per 8 hours versus oral 1,485 (p 
      <0.05) versus intravesical electromotive 2,781 (p <0.001). Bladder content
      samples confirmed oxybutynin absorption. Oral oxybutynin caused anticholinergic
      side effects in 7 of 10 patients. There were no side effects with intravesical
      passive diffusion or electromotive administrations. CONCLUSIONS: Accelerated
      intravesical administration results in greater bioavailability and increased
      objective benefits without side effects in previously unresponsive patients
      compared with oral and intravesical passive diffusion oxybutynin administration.

TI  - Pharmacological actions of AH-9700 on micturition reflex in anesthetized rats.
PG  - 171-9
AB  - In radioligand binding assays, AH-9700
      (1-[2-(3,4-dihydro-6,7-dimethyl-2-naphthalenyl)ethyl]pyrrolidine fumarate) had
      high affinity for sigma receptors and moderate affinity for muscarinic receptors.
      The affinity of AH-9700 for sigma(1) receptors was significantly reduced in the
      presence of 5'-guanylyl-imidodiphosphate (GppNHp). In isolated bladder strips of 
      rats, AH-9700 inhibited carbachol-induced contractions. In anesthetized rats,
      i.v. administration of AH-9700 and typical sigma receptor ligands,
      (+)-pentazocine and 1,3-di-o-tolylguanidine (DTG), but not oxybutynin,
      dose-dependently inhibited rhythmic isovolumetric reflex bladder contractions.
      AH-9700 and oxybutynin suppressed the amplitude of rhythmic bladder contractions.
      On the other hand, at doses lower than used i.v., the i.c.v. administration of
      AH-9700 or the sigma receptor ligands inhibited rhythmic bladder contractions
      without suppressing the amplitude. This inhibitory effect of AH-9700 was markedly
      reduced by pretreatment with i.c.v. pertussis toxin. These results suggest that
      AH-9700 exerts a marked anti-micturition reflex effect through central sigma
      receptors possibly related to pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi/o-proteins and a
      moderate spasmolytic effect based on its peripheral anti-muscarinic activity.

TI  - Practice patterns in the treatment of female urinary incontinence: a postal and
      internet survey.
PG  - 45-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To survey American urologists to assess practice patterns in treating
      female incontinence. Advances in the treatment of female incontinence have
      changed the way urologists practice. METHODS: Postal and e-mail surveys were sent
      to 2502 members of the American Urological Association. RESULTS: From the postal 
      group (n = 1000), 419 (42%) responses were obtained; from the e-mail group (n =
      1502), 160 (11%) responses were obtained. For types I, II, and III stress urinary
      incontinence (SUI), 239 (44%) of 546, 388 (68%) of 570, and 512 (94%) of 547
      urologists, respectively, recommended a sling procedure. For type I SUI, 75 (53%)
      of the 143 respondents in practice for less than 10 years recommended a sling
      procedure. The sling was recommended by 62 (35%) of the 176 respondents in
      practice for longer than 20 years (P <0.001). Most urologists (75%, 358 of 480)
      referred patients with significant vaginal prolapse to a gynecologist; however,
      urologists in full-time academic practice were more likely to offer surgical
      treatment (56%, 29 of 52). Most urologists recommended medical treatment for urge
      incontinence (94%, 461 of 491), and the medications most commonly selected were
      tolterodine (41%, 202 of 491), oxybutynin (26%, 129 of 491), and extended-release
      oxybutynin (25%, 125 of 491). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, a sling procedure was the
      most commonly recommended surgical procedure for all types of SUI. Most
      urologists referred patients with significant vaginal prolapse to a gynecologist.
      For type I SUI, older urologists were more likely than younger urologists to
      perform needle bladder neck suspension.

TI  - Bladder-sphincter biofeedback as treatment of detrusor instability in women who
      failed to respond to oxybutynin.
PG  - 590-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was designed to determine the efficacy of
      bladder-sphincter-biofeedback as a secondary treatment for those women with
      detrusor instability who failed to respond to oxybutynin chloride. METHODS: In a 
      prospective non-randomized trial, 31 of 70 women with detrusor instability were
      assigned to either the study bladder-sphincter-biofeedback training group (n =
      16) or to the control pelvic floor exercise group (n = 15) after they had failed 
      to respond to oxybutynin chloride. RESULTS: Thirty (43%) of the 70 women were
      cured by oxybutynin chloride, and 9 (13%) withdrew due to various side effects. A
      comparison of cure rates between biofeedback training and pelvic floor exercise
      groups demonstrated that there were significant differences in objective changes:
      detrusor pressure (68.75% vs. 0%, p < 0.001), compliance (75.0% vs. 6.67%, p <
      0.001), and resting maximal urethral closure pressure (43.75% vs. 6.67%, p <
      0.037). Neither the cure rate nor improvement rate of subjective changes
      (urgency, and frequency and episodes of urge incontinence), significantly
      differed. CONCLUSION: Oxybutynin chloride was not well tolerated while
      bladder-sphincter-biofeedback was well accepted. As a secondary treatment, it
      appears better than pelvic floor exercise alone and may be the choice of
      non-surgical treatment in those women who failed to respond to oxybutynin
      chloride for detrusor instability.

TI  - Pharmacological agents for the treatment of urinary incontinence due to
      overactive bladder.
PG  - 65-83
AB  - Although the exact aetiology of overactive bladder is unknown to date,
      pharmacological therapy has been targeted to both the central and peripheral
      nervous systems. Potential CNS targets include GABA, opioid, serotonin (5-HT),
      dopamine and glutaminergic receptors as well as the alpha-adrenoceptors.
      Potential PNS targets include muscarinic receptors, calcium and potassium
      channels and alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors. Since acetylcholine is the
      primary excitatory neurotransmitter involved in bladder (detrusor) contraction
      and emptying, anticholinergic agents are the primary compounds used clinically to
      decrease involuntary detrusor contractions. Anticholinergic therapy has a
      stabilising effect on the bladder (detrusor muscle); increases bladder capacity; 
      decreases frequency of involuntary detrusor contractions; and delays the initial 
      urge to void, but does not affect warning time. However, the clinical utility of 
      antimuscarinic therapy is limited by the lack of receptor selectivity, resulting 
      in the classic anticholinergic side effects of dry mouth, blurred vision,
      constipation and potentially, CNS effects such as somnolence and impaired
      cognitive function. These unwanted side effects often result in premature
      discontinuation of therapy and poor compliance. Previous attempts to develop
      uroselective alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonists have not been successful and
      although research continues, the hope that this class of agents would be viable
      alternatives to the anticholinergics remains to be proven in the clinical
      setting. The recent demise of several potassium channel openers does not augur
      well for the future of this class of agent. The reasons for the discontinuation
      of trials with these agents have not been fully elucidated, but one must assume
      that they were not uroselective and the cardiovascular side effects rendered them
      less than useful clinically. The serotonin re-uptake inhibitors appear to be
      promising novel therapeutic agents aimed at controlling bladder over-activity
      through specific CNS pathways. The sensory side of the micturition reflex is a
      potential therapeutic target. Agents to desensitise afferent nerve endings
      involved in C-fibre afferent reflexes include capsaicin and resiniferatoxin.
      Their clinical applicability is currently being evaluated. Finally, the recent
      findings related to the role of the P2X3 receptor in the sensory aspects of
      bladder filling have created new interest in the future development of agents
      that will improve the management of this prevalent and debilitating condition.

TI  - Advancements in pharmacologic management of the overactive bladder.
PG  - 41-9
AB  - Continued developments in the understanding of lower urinary tract function have 
      led to improvements in the pharmacologic manipulation of bladder dysfunction.
      Drug delivery changes have produced drugs that provide better efficacy and
      tolerability, thus improving patient compliance. Improvements in drug delivery
      systems have altered drug bioavailability and pharmacokinetics. Active current
      investigation in new agents and delivery systems for intravesical delivery has
      yielded intriguing early results that may substantially add to the armamentarium 
      for the management of the overactive bladder (urgency, frequency, urge
      incontinence). New developments in the understanding of the neuropharmacology of 
      the bladder, peripheral pelvic nerves, and sacral cord may provide agents with
      entirely new drug effects, either as primary agents or agents to be used in
      combination with currently available drugs. We herein review newer agents and
      drug delivery systems.

TI  - Comparison of the effects of novel antimuscarinic drugs on human detrusor smooth 
      muscle.
PG  - 719-25
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of tolterodine, vamicamide and temiverine,
      novel antimuscarinic drugs developed for the treatment of frequency and urinary
      incontinence, on human detrusor smooth muscle. Materials and methods Specimens of
      human urinary bladder were obtained from 20 patients who underwent total
      cystectomy for malignant bladder tumour. Using an organ-bath technique, the
      effects of various drugs on the contractions induced by carbachol, KCl, CaCl2 and
      electrical field stimulation in the detrusor strips were investigated. RESULTS:
      Carbachol (0.001-10000 micromol/L) caused concentration-dependent contractions in
      human detrusor smooth muscles. Tolterodine (0.01-10 micromol/L), vamicamide
      (0.01-10 micromol/L), temiverine (0.01-1 micromol/L) and atropine (0.001-1
      micromol/L) caused parallel shifts to the right of the concentration-response
      curves to carbachol. All slopes for the regression line of Schild plots were
      close to unity, and the rank order of pA2 values was atropine = tolterodine >
      vamicamide > temiverine. Tolterodine, vamicamide and atropine did not inhibit the
      maximum contractile responses to carbachol, while temiverine (10 micromol/L)
      significantly inhibited the maximum contractions. Tolterodine (0.001-1
      micromol/L) and vamicamide (0.01-10 micromol/L) did not inhibit the KCl- (80
      mmol/L) and CaCl2-induced (5 mmol/L) contractions, while temiverine (0.01-10
      micromol/L) significantly inhibited the contractions. Electrical field
      stimulation (2-60 Hz) caused frequency-dependent contractions in human detrusor
      smooth muscles, which were significantly inhibited by various drugs. In the
      presence of 1 micromol/L atropine, tolterodine and vamicamide did not inhibit the
      contractions induced by electrical field stimulation at all frequencies, while
      temiverine (10 micromol/L) significantly inhibited the contractions. CONCLUSION: 
      Tolterodine and vamicamide inhibited contractions of human detrusor smooth
      muscles only through their antimuscarinic action, while temiverine had both
      antimuscarinic and calcium-antagonist actions. Furthermore, these novel drugs
      have different efficacies and potencies for inhibiting human detrusor smooth
      muscle.

TI  - Combination therapy of imipramine with oxybutynin in children with enuresis
      nocturna.
PG  - 135-9
AB  - PURPOSE: The treatment approach for enuresis is controversial due to the lack of 
      consensus as to the exact causes of nocturnal enuresis. Despite various treatment
      modalities, pharmacotherapy still appears to be the common choice. The aim of
      this prospective study was the evaluation of the efficacy of combination therapy 
      (imipramine and oxybutynin) in patients with enuresis nocturna. PATIENTS AND
      METHODS: This prospective study was done with 77 monosymptomatic nocturnal
      enuretics between July 1996 and December 1998. RESULTS: Even though there is no
      statistically significant difference between combination therapy (imipramine plus
      oxybutynin) and monotherapy, clinical data showed that combination therapy is
      more effective. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that combination of imipramine with
      oxybutynin is a safe and new choice in the treatment of nocturnal enuresis.

TI  - Possible site of action of TAK-637, a tachykinin NK(1) receptor antagonist, on
      the micturition reflex in guinea pigs.
PG  - 235-40
AB  - TAK-637((aR,9R)-7-[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzyl]-8,9,10,
      11-tetrahydro-9-methyl-5-(4-methylphenyl)-7H-[1,4]diazocino[2,1-g]
      [1,7]naphthyridine-6,13-dione) is a novel tachykinin NK(1) receptor antagonist
      that has been shown to inhibit the micturition reflex in guinea pigs. The aim of 
      this study was to clarify its mechanism of action in guinea pigs. TAK-637
      inhibited the spinal vesico-vesical reflex induced by electrical stimulation of
      the proximal cut end of the pelvic nerve in spinal animals, but not bladder
      contractions induced by electrical stimulation of the distal cut end of the
      nerve. Furthermore, TAK-637 had no effect on carbachol- or electrical field
      stimulation-induced contractions of isolated bladder muscle strips in an organ
      bath, whereas drugs used for abnormally frequent micturition inhibited both
      contractions. These results suggest that TAK-637 inhibits the micturition reflex 
      by acting, at least in part, on the spinal cord, and its mechanism of action
      clearly differs from those of antimuscarinics or spasmolytics.

TI  - Porcine microsomal vitamin D(3) 25-hydroxylase (CYP2D25). Catalytic properties,
      tissue distribution, and comparison with human CYP2D6.
PG  - 34650-5
AB  - The metabolic activation of the prohormone vitamin D(3) requires a
      25-hydroxylation that has been reported to be catalyzed by both mitochondrial
      CYP27A and a microsomal vitamin D(3) 25-hydroxylase in the liver. CYP27A has been
      extensively studied, but its role as a physiologically important vitamin D(3)
      25-hydroxylase has been questioned. The present paper reports that the microsomal
      vitamin D(3) 25-hydroxylase, purified from pig liver, converted vitamin D(3) into
      25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) in substrate concentrations which are within the
      physiological range (apparent K(m) = 0.1 microm). The enzyme 25-hydroxylated
      vitamin D(3), 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D(3) and vitamin D(2) and also converted
      tolterodine, a substrate for human CYP2D6, into its 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite.
      Tolterodine inhibited the microsomal 25-hydroxylation, whereas quinidine, an
      inhibitor of CYP2D6, did not markedly inhibit the reaction. The primary structure
      of the microsomal vitamin D(3) 25-hydroxylase, designated CYP2D25, shows 77%
      identity with that of human CYP2D6. Northern blot and reverse
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction experiments revealed that CYP2D25 mRNA is
      expressed in higher levels in liver than in kidney and in small amounts in
      adrenals, brain, heart, intestine, lung, muscle, spleen, and thymus. Experiments 
      with human liver microsomes and recombinantly expressed CYP2D6 strongly indicate 
      that the microsomal 25-hydroxylation of vitamin D(3) in human liver is catalyzed 
      by an enzyme different from CYP2D6.

TI  - Urinary incontinence: does it increase risk for falls and fractures? Study of
      Osteoporotic Fractures Research Group.
PG  - 721-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if urge urinary incontinence is associated with risk of
      falls and non-spine fractures in older women. METHODS: Type and frequency of
      incontinent episodes were assessed by 6,049 community-dwelling women using a
      self-completed questionnaire. Postcards were subsequently mailed every 4 months
      to inquire about falls and fractures. Incident fractures were confirmed by
      radiographic report. Logistic and proportional hazard models were used to assess 
      the independent association of urge urinary incontinence and risk of falling or
      fracture. RESULTS: The mean age of the women was 78.5 (+/- 4.6) years. During an 
      average follow-up of 3 years, 55% of women reported falling, and 8.5% reported
      fractures. One-quarter of the women (1,493) reported weekly or more frequent urge
      incontinence, 19% (1,137) reported weekly or more frequent stress incontinence,
      and 708 (12%) reported both types of incontinence. In multivariate models, weekly
      or more frequent urge incontinence was associated independently with risk of
      falling (odds ratio = 1.26; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.14-1.40) and with
      non-spine nontraumatic fracture (relative hazard 1.34; 95% CI, 1.06-1.69; P =
      .02). Stress incontinence was not associated independently with falls or
      fracture. CONCLUSIONS: Weekly or more frequent urge incontinence was associated
      independently with an increased risk of falls and non-spine, nontraumatic
      fractures in older women. Urinary frequency, nocturia, and rushing to the
      bathroom to avoid urge incontinent episodes most likely increase the risk of
      falling, which then results in fractures. Early diagnosis and appropriate
      treatment of urge incontinence may decrease the risk of fracture.

TI  - Propiverine-induced Parkinsonism: a case report and a
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study in mice.
PG  - 565-71
AB  - PURPOSE: We present a case report of propiverine-induced Parkinsonism. We
      previously reported the induction of catalepsy by amiodarone, aprindine and
      procaine, which possess a diethylaminomethyl moiety and demonstrated selective
      blockade of dopamine D2 receptors by these drugs in mice. We hypothesized that
      drugs possessing a diethylaminomethyl structure may generally induce Parkinsonism
      and/or catalepsy. METHODS: Thus, we performed a study to examine whether
      oxybutynin, pentoxyverine and etafenone, as well as propiverine, induce catalepsy
      in mice. RESULTS: The intensity of drug-induced catalepsy was in the order:
      haloperidol > etafenone > pentoxyverine > propiverine > oxybutynin. In vivo
      occupancy of dopamine D1, D2 and mACh receptors in the striatum was also
      examined. The in vitro binding affinities to the D1, D2 and mACh receptors in the
      striatum synaptic membrane were within the ranges of 2.4-140 microM, 380-4,200
      nM, and 1.2-2,800 nM, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the idea
      that any drug possessing a diethylaminomethyl moiety may contribute to the
      induction of catalepsy, possibly by occupying dopamine receptors.

TI  - Selective prescribing of spasmolytics.
PG  - 716-20
AB  - BACKGROUND: Daily clinical practice often differs largely from the clinical trial
      setting, so extrapolation of outcomes from trial data, such as safety,
      effectiveness, and economic outcomes, can be deceptive. Prescribers may intend to
      treat a selected group of patients with new drugs; this practice could result in 
      significant bias in assessing outcomes of these agents during their use in daily 
      clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate what type of patient received
      tolterodine compared with the spasmolytic drugs previously marketed (oxybutynin, 
      flavoxate, emepronium). DESIGN: An observational, follow-up study. SETTING:
      Eighteen collaborating community pharmacies. PATIENTS: Aged > or = 18 years,
      noninstitutionalized; initial therapy with tolterodine, oxybutynin, flavoxate, or
      emepronium. RESULTS: Tolterodine was often used as a second-line and even as a
      third-line treatment, and was prescribed to a "polluted" population in terms of
      concomitant psychotropic medication. Tolterodine users were 7.5 times more likely
      to have received another spasmolytic drug (RR 7.5, 95% CI 4.8 to 11.9). In
      addition, these patients more frequently used antiparkinsonian drugs (RR 4.1, 95%
      CI 1.6 to 10.4) as well as antipsychotic drugs (RR 2.9, 95% CI 1.4 to 6.2). There
      was a small difference in concomitant use of antidepressants and benzodiazepines 
      between patients receiving tolterodine versus those taking other spasmolytic
      drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Tolterodine is prescribed for a population differing from
      that receiving previously marketed spasmolytic drugs. Selective prescribing
      should recognized when evaluating new drugs in daily clinical practice. Policy
      makers, such as pharmacy and therapeutics committees, should consider this aspect
      in their formulary decisions since selective prescribing can lead to unjustified 
      conclusions about a drug's therapeutic effects (e.g., efficacy, safety,
      cost-effectiveness).

TI  - Responses of isolated normal human detrusor muscle to various spasmolytic drugs
      commonly used in the treatment of the overactive bladder.
PG  - 456-60
AB  - The spasmolytic activity of flavoxate (CAS 15301-69-6) and the anticholinergic
      agents oxybutynin (CAS 5633-20-5), tolterodine (CAS 124937-51-5) and trospium
      chloride (CAS 10405-02-4), all of which are commonly utilized in the treatment of
      urinary incontinence, on muscarinic tension and electrically evoked contractions 
      of isolated human detrusor smooth muscle strips was studied using the organ bath 
      technique. Within the concentration ranges tested (trospium chloride
      10(-11)-10(-6) mol/l, flavoxate and oxybutynin 10(-9)-10(-5) mol/l, tolterodine
      10(-10)-10(-5) mol/l), each drug caused a concentration-dependent relaxation of
      the tension elicited by muscarinic stimulation and dose-dependently attenuated
      the contractions induced by electrical field stimulation (EFS). The effects of
      trospium chloride and tolterodine on carbachol-induced muscarinic tension were
      more pronounced than those of oxybutynin, while trospium chloride and oxybutynin 
      were most effective in inhibiting the contractions induced by EFS. Flavoxate was 
      significantly less effective than all other drugs tested. Regardless the
      individual drug concentrations needed for maximal efficacy, the potency of
      oxybutynin and flavoxate to reverse muscarinic tension and attenuate EFS-evoked
      contractions was almost comparable while tolterodine and trospium chloride were
      more effective in relaxing the muscarinic tension of the detrusor strip
      preparations than causing inhibition of EFS-induced contractions. Our results
      again underline the ratio for the use of nortropane analogues (trospium chloride)
      and phenylpropylamine cresols (tolterodine) in the treatment of frequency,
      urgency and urge incontinence secondary to an overactive bladder.

TI  - Urinary incontinence.
PG  - 646-55
AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the more prevalent conditions associated with aging is urinary
      incontinence (UI), which may affect up to 55% of women and 34% of men older than 
      65 years. As a result of increasing longevity in developed nations, the
      proportion of UI-susceptible individuals continues to grow, presenting clinical
      and economic challenges to healthcare providers. OBJECTIVE: To assist the
      clinician in making informed decisions regarding UI, provide information on the
      wider ramifications of the disease, and provide a comprehensive overview of the
      condition. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (1966-December 1998) was searched for relevant
      publications using the following search terms: UI, UI in the elderly, treatment
      of UI, oxybutynin, flavoxate, vasopressin, quality of life in UI, and economic
      impact of UI. DATA SYNTHESIS: Key articles relating to the etiology, diagnosis,
      classification, economic burden, quality of life, and treatment of UI were
      retrieved, and this information formed the basis of the review. CONCLUSIONS:
      Although UI can be controlled relatively well with existing therapies, only about
      50% of affected patients may actually seek care. There are a variety of
      therapeutic options available for the treatment of UI, although pharmacologic
      intervention is presently a relatively minor component of overall care; this
      suggests that effective drug therapy might play a more significant role in the
      future. The economic burden associated with the care of the incontinent patient
      is substantial, and in the US the direct medical cost of the disease was
      estimated at $25.5 billion in 1995. The disease also has a large impact on the
      individual UI patient, negatively affecting many parameters normally associated
      with a tolerable health-related quality of life.

TI  - Sildenafil effects on sexual and cardiovascular responses in women with spinal
      cord injury.
PG  - 812-5
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Sexual dysfunction is common in women with spinal cord injuries
      (SCIs) and other neurologic conditions. Sildenafil has previously been shown to
      be safe and effective in the treatment of erectile dysfunction due to SCI. This
      study is the first to evaluate the sexual and cardiovascular effects of
      sildenafil in women with SCIs in a controlled, laboratory setting. METHODS:
      Nineteen premenopausal women with SCIs were randomly assigned to receive either
      sildenafil (50 mg) or placebo in a double-blind, crossover design study.
      Physiologic and subjective measures of sexual response, heart rate, and blood
      pressure were recorded during baseline and sexual stimulation conditions. Adverse
      events were also recorded. RESULTS: Significant increases in subjective arousal
      (SA) were observed with both drug (P <0.01) and sexual stimulation conditions (P 
      <0.001), and a borderline significant (P <0.07) effect of drug administration on 
      vaginal pulse amplitude (VPA) was noted. Maximal responses occurred when
      sildenafil was combined with visual and manual sexual stimulation. Cardiovascular
      data showed modest increases in heart rate (+/-5 bpm) and mild decreases in blood
      pressure (+/-4 mm Hg) across all stimulation conditions, consistent with the
      peripheral vasodilatory mechanism of the drug. Sildenafil was well tolerated with
      no evidence of significant adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that
      sildenafil may partially reverse the sexual dysfunction commonly associated with 
      SCI in women. Consistent with previous findings in men, the sexual effects of the
      drug were most evident under conditions of optimal stimulation. Mild, clinically 
      insignificant cardiovascular effects were also noted. Further large-scale studies
      of sildenafil's effects in women with neurogenic sexual dysfunction are strongly 
      indicated.

TI  - Treatment of prostatitis.
PG  - 3015-22, 3025-6
AB  - The term prostatitis is applied to a series of disorders, ranging from acute
      bacterial infection to chronic pain syndromes, in which the prostate gland is
      inflamed. Patients present with a variety of symptoms, including urinary
      obstruction, fever, myalgias, decreased libido or impotence, painful ejaculation 
      and low-back and perineal pain. Physical examination often fails to clarify the
      cause of the pain. Cultures and microscopic examination of urine and prostatic
      secretions before and after prostatic massage may help differentiate prostatitis 
      caused by infection from prostatitis with other causes. Because the rate of
      occult infection is high, a therapeutic trial of antibiotics is often in order
      even when patients do not appear to have bacterial prostatitis. If the patient
      responds to therapy, antibiotics are continued for at least three to four weeks, 
      although some men require treatment for several months. A patient who does not
      respond might be evaluated for chronic nonbacterial prostatitis, in which
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, alpha-blocking agents, anticholinergic
      agents or other therapies may provide symptomatic relief.

TI  - Efficacy and cardiac safety of propiverine in elderly patients - a double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled clinical study.
PG  - 702-8
AB  - The study investigated the efficacy and cardiac safety of propiverine in the
      elderly, because the induction of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia has
      been reported for some drugs prescribed in the therapy of urinary incontinence.
      Ninety-eight patients (21 male, 77 female; 67.7+/-6.3 years of age) suffering
      from urgency, urge incontinence or mixed urge-stress incontinence were included
      in the double-blind, multicentre, placebo-controlled, randomized study. After a
      2-week placebo run-in period, the patients received propiverine (15 mg t.i.d.) or
      placebo (t.i.d.) for 4 weeks. Before (V1, V2) and during the treatment period
      (V3, V4), standard ECGs and 24-hour long-term ECGs were recorded. Propiverine
      caused a significant reduction of the micturition frequency (V2: 8.7+/-4.2, V4:
      6.5+/-3.2 ml; p< or =0.01), reflected in a significant increase in the average
      micturition volume (V2: 163.5+/-65.9, V4: 216.3+/-101.5 ml; p< or =0.01) and a
      significant decrease in episodes of incontinence (-54%; p = 0.048). These
      findings were confirmed by the overall assessment at V4, in which approximately
      90% of patients under propiverine either had no urge incontinence or urge
      symptoms, or showed improvement. Resting and ambulatory electrocardiograms
      indicated no significant changes. Neither the frequency-corrected Q-T interval
      nor other cardiac parameters were relevantly altered. The frequency of cardiac
      events (Lown classes IVa/b) was random, revealing no difference between placebo
      and propiverine. The incidence of adverse events was very low (2% dryness of the 
      mouth under propiverine) and confirmed by the findings from the quality of life
      questionnaires. A favourable benefit-risk ratio without the induction of any
      cardiac arrhythmia in the treatment of elderly patients suffering from urgency,
      urge incontinence or combined urge-stress incontinence is therefore proven for
      propiverine.

TI  - [Assessment of effectiveness of and tolerance to oxybutynin in the treatment of
      unstable bladder in women].
PG  - 174-81
AB  - Unstable bladder is a frequent syndrome in women and is due in the most part
      because of detrusor involuntary contractions, mainly due to detrusor denervation,
      which produces voiding hypersensitivity and loss of cortical inhibition control, 
      clinical manifestations are: frequency, nicturia, urgency and urge incontinence. 
      Historically the most effective treatment has been muscular relaxing agents and
      anticholinergic agents. We present a prospective, double blind, cross, placebo
      control study to evaluate efficacy and tolerance of oxybutynin in women with
      unstable bladder. We included 44 adult women with unstable bladder, 22 unitially 
      received oxybutynin 5 mg t.i.d. and 22 placebo 5 mg t.i.d. aleatory in both
      groups through 6 weeks, later wash-out period was performed and those women in
      which initially received oxybutynin were administered placebo and those women in 
      which initially received placebo, were administered oxybutynin, for another six
      weeks. Five patients which initiated the study with oxybutynin abandoned the
      study, 2 of them for intolerance and 3 for unknown causes. Two women in which
      initially received placebo abandoned follow-up too. A total of 74 subjects (37
      for each branch of study) had an age average of 51.7. Symptoms scoring decreased 
      from 13 to 11 and 6 points with placebo and oxybutynin respectively (p = 0.001). 
      The analog visual scale of symptoms decreased from 77% to 62.5% and 40% with
      placebo and oxybutynin respectively (p = 0.003). The overall rate of improvement 
      evaluated through symptoms scoring was from 27% with placebo and 72.9% with
      oxybutynin (p = 0.000) and evaluated through analog visual scale of symptoms was 
      from 40% with placebo and 78.3% with oxybutynin (p = 0.002). The vesical volume
      at first voiding sensation increased from 129 ml to 134 ml and 187 ml with
      placebo and oxybutynin respectively (p = 0.021) and the maximum cystometric
      capacity increased from 231 ml to 236 ml and 301 ml with placebo and oxybutynin
      respectively. The most frequent adverse effect in both groups was mouth dryness
      and it presented in 7 (19%) and 34 (91%) patients with placebo and oxybutynin
      respectively (p = 0.000). Only 5 of 44 patients (11.3%) with oxybutynin and 2 of 
      44 patients (4.4%) with placebo abandoned follow up (p = 0.14). We concluded that
      oxybutynin improve significantly the unstable bladder symptoms in women, possibly
      by increasing functional bladder capacity and decreasing voiding sensitivity,
      with good tolerance of mouth dryness in the majority of patients.

TI  - Interstitial cystitis: bladder training with intravesical oxybutynin.
PG  - 1818-22
AB  - PURPOSE: We assess the efficacy of intravesical administration of oxybutynin
      chloride in patients with interstitial cystitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study
      included 36 women with a mean age of 45 years with a diagnosis of interstitial
      cystitis. Patients were treated with gradual intravesical instillation of saline 
      oxybutynin solution (oxybutynin group) or gradual filling of simple saline
      (control group). Evaluation parameters consisted of symptom problem index, voids 
      per day, volume per void, functional bladder capacity, volume at first sensation,
      cystometric bladder capacity and cystometric volume at first sensation. RESULTS: 
      Statistically significant improvement of all evaluated parameters was found in
      both groups. When comparing the outcomes statistically significant improvement of
      parameters favored the oxybutynin group. CONCLUSIONS: Bladder training alone
      produces a satisfactory result by gradually expanding the bladder, and an
      additional statistically significant improvement is evident with intravesical
      oxybutynin.

TI  - Combined behavioral and drug therapy for urge incontinence in older women.
PG  - 370-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of combining
      behavioral treatment and drug treatment for urge incontinence in
      community-dwelling older women. DESIGN: Modified crossover design (extension of a
      randomized clinical trial). Eligible subjects were stratified according to type
      and severity of incontinence and randomized to behavioral treatment, drug
      treatment, or a control condition (placebo). Subjects not totally continent or
      not satisfied after 8 weeks of a single treatment were offered the opportunity to
      cross over into combined therapy. SETTING: A university-based outpatient
      geriatric medicine clinic. PARTICIPANTS: Subjects in the clinical trial were 197 
      ambulatory, nondemented, community-dwelling women (age 55 years or older) with
      persistent urge urinary incontinence. Thirty-five subjects participated in
      combined treatment. INTERVENTION: One group of subjects received four sessions
      (over 8 weeks) of biofeedback-assisted behavioral training followed by 8 weeks of
      behavioral training combined with drug therapy (oxybutynin chloride individually 
      titrated from 2.5 mg to 15 mg daily). The second group received drug therapy
      first, followed by 8 weeks of drug therapy combined with behavioral training.
      MEASUREMENTS: Bladder diaries completed by subjects before and after each
      treatment phase were used to calculate change in the frequency of incontinent
      episodes. RESULTS: Eight subjects (12.7%) crossed from behavioral treatment alone
      to combined behavioral and drug therapy. Additional benefit was seen in
      improvement from a mean 57.5% reduction of incontinence with single therapy to a 
      mean 88.5% reduction of incontinence with combined therapy (P = .034).
      Twenty-seven subjects (41.5%) crossed from drug therapy alone to combined drug
      and behavioral treatment. They also showed additional improvement, from a mean
      72.7% reduction of incontinence with single therapy to a mean 84.3% reduction of 
      incontinence with combined therapy (P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that
      combining drug and behavioral therapy in a stepped program can produce added
      benefit for patients with urge incontinence.

TI  - Muscarinic receptor antagonists in the treatment of overactive bladder.
PG  - 33-46; discussion 50
AB  - A wealth of clinical evidence supports the view that muscarinic receptor
      antagonists are effective in the treatment of overactive bladder. However,
      treatment-limiting adverse effects such as dry mouth, constipation, and blurred
      vision have restricted the usefulness of previously available agents, such as
      oxybutynin. A real need therefore existed for effective and well-tolerated agents
      for the long-term management of the troublesome symptoms of overactive bladder.
      This review outlines the various approaches that have been used in attempts to
      overcome the tolerability problems of oxybutynin. It also describes how advances 
      in our understanding of muscarinic receptors and bladder function has led to the 
      potential development of either tissue- or subtype-selective antimuscarinic
      agents with improved tolerability. Drugs that have been developed in this way
      include tolterodine and darifenacin, each of which shows some bladder selectivity
      in animal models. Unlike darifenacin, however, the bladder selectivity of
      tolterodine has been confirmed by numerous clinical studies. Tolterodine's
      improved tolerability compared with oxybutynin, along with its equivalent
      therapeutic efficacy at recommended dosages, permits patients to experience the
      beneficial effects of long-term treatment. Tolterodine therefore represents a
      real alternative for the long-term management of overactive bladder. The results 
      of ongoing clinical studies with darifenacin are awaited before it can be
      concluded that selective antagonism of M(3) receptors leads to improved
      tolerability over existing agents in the treatment of overactive bladder.
      Similarly, the potential improvements in tolerability associated with different
      dosage formulations of oxybutynin, and the clinical utility of S-oxybutynin, are 
      yet to be conclusively demonstrated.

TI  - Nonpharmacologic treatments for overactive bladder-pelvic floor exercises.
PG  - 7-11; discussion 14-6
AB  - The theory behind the use of physical therapies (electrical stimulation or pelvic
      floor muscle [PFM] training with or without biofeedback) for overactive bladder
      is to (1) inhibit detrusor muscle contraction by voluntary contraction of the
      PFMs at the same time as the urge to void; and (2) prevent sudden falls in
      urethral pressure by a change in PFM morphology, position, and neuromuscular
      function. Few trials have evaluated the effect of PFM training on symptoms of
      overactive bladder. Most studies are flawed because they include several
      diagnoses and treatment modalities in the same intervention. Because of the lack 
      of evidence, no firm conclusion can be drawn on the effect of PFM exercise on
      overactive bladder. There are some initially promising results, but there is
      still a need for high-quality, randomized controlled trials on the effect of PFM 
      training on the inhibition of detrusor contraction in human beings. The efficacy 
      of PFM training in combination with other treatments, such as pharmacotherapy,
      also requires investigation.

      muscarinic receptors on the detrusor muscle of the bladder, preventing
      acetylcholinergic activation and relaxing the muscle. Mean peak plasma
      concentrations are lower with extended-release oxybutynin 15mg once daily than
      with conventional immediate-release oxybutynin 5mg taken 3 times daily. Relative 
      bioavailabilities of parent drug and metabolite N-desethoxybutynin are 153 and
      69%, respectively, for extended-release oxybutynin when compared with
      immediate-release oxybutynin. In short (< or =6 weeks) randomised, double-blind
      clinical trials of patients with detrusor instability, extended-release
      oxybutynin 5 to 30mg once daily significantly reduced the mean weekly number of
      urge incontinence episodes by 84 to 90%. Extended-release oxybutynin had similar 
      efficacy to immediate-release oxybutynin. Adverse events reported by patients
      taking extended-release oxybutynin were dose-related anticholinergic effects,
      most frequently dry mouth, somnolence, constipation, blurred vision and
      dizziness. A large noncomparative study demonstrated that approximately two
      thirds of the patients prescribed extended-release oxybutynin for detrusor
      instability were still taking the medication 6 months later.

TI  - Intravesical neuromodulatory drugs: capsaicin and resiniferatoxin to treat the
      overactive bladder.
PG  - 97-103
AB  - Current pharmacologic treatment of the overactive bladder relies on
      anticholinergic drugs. However, these drugs often have troublesome side effects
      and frequently are given in doses insufficient to restore continence in patients 
      with detrusor instability. We present the background and basic and clinical
      research dealing with intravesical instillation of capsaicin and resinfferatoxin 
      as treatments for the overactive bladder. Capsaicin is the main pungent
      ingredient in "hot" peppers of the genus Capsicum. It is a specific neurotoxin
      that desensitizes C-fiber afferent neurons, which may be responsible for the
      signals that trigger detrusor overactivity. Studies with capsaicin over the past 
      8 years have demonstrated clinical efficacy with minimal long-term complications.
      Most of these studies have also shown that the acute pain and irritation
      associated with capsaicin are a major deterrent to widespread use.
      Resiniferatoxin (RTX), an ultrapotent analog of capsaicin that appears to have
      similar efficacy but with much less acute side effects may be more useful.
      Intravesical instillation of capsaicin or resiniferatoxin is a promising
      treatment for the overactive bladder.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of tolterodine in children with detrusor hyperreflexia.
PG  - 414-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the urodynamic effects and tolerability of the new
      antimuscarinic drug tolterodine in children with detrusor hyperreflexia. METHODS:
      Twenty-two children (12 boys and 10 girls; age range 3 months to 15 years, mean
      age 5.7 years) with detrusor hyperreflexia resulting in maximum detrusor
      pressures exceeding 40 cm H(2)O during filling cystotonometry were enrolled to
      receive tolterodine tartrate (a total of 0.1 mg/kg orally daily, divided into two
      doses) either as a first-line therapy (n = 12, group 1) or replacing oxybutynin
      chloride therapy (n = 10, group 2). Within 3 months, all patients underwent
      urodynamic re-evaluation during ongoing tolterodine treatment. RESULTS: In group 
      1, the mean maximum bladder capacity increased from 120.2 to 173.0 mL (+44%), the
      mean detrusor compliance increased from 8.7 to 13.5 mL/cm H(2)O (+55%), and the
      mean maximum detrusor pressures decreased from 70.1 to 37.9 cm H(2)O (-46%); the 
      differences were significant (P < 0.001). In group 2, no differences in the
      urodynamic effects of oxybutynin versus tolterodine were noted. Only 1 patient
      experienced a transient and moderately adverse effect with tolterodine.
      CONCLUSIONS: Although based on a limited number of subjects, these data indicate 
      that in pediatric patients with detrusor hyperreflexia, tolterodine may be better
      tolerated than and equally effective as the standard drug oxybutynin chloride.

TI  - Combined intravesical and oral oxybutynin chloride in adult patients with spinal 
      cord injury.
PG  - 358-62
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Detrusor hyperreflexia with elevated storage pressures presents a
      major risk factor for renal damage in patients with neurogenic lower urinary
      tract dysfunction. If standard anticholinergic treatment is unsuccessful,
      surgical treatment must be considered. We evaluated the effects of intravesical
      oxybutynin treatment on detrusor hyperreflexia in patients in whom standard oral 
      treatment had failed. METHODS: Twenty-five patients (mean age 36. 7 years) with
      storage pressures greater than 40 cm H(2)O despite standard anticholinergic
      treatment received intravesical (15 mg three times daily) and oral oxybutynin
      chloride treatment. The follow-up evaluations included urodynamic testing, renal 
      ultrasound, urine examination (urinalysis and urine culture), and evaluation of
      side effects. RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 6 months. Intravesical treatment
      led to an increase in bladder storage volume from 349 to 420 mL. The mean maximum
      storage pressure was significantly reduced from 54 to 26.5 cm H(2)O. Detrusor
      storage pressures returned to values less than 40 cm H(2)O in 21 of 25 patients. 
      Dysreflexia was treated successfully in 3 of 5 patients. No patient developed
      renal damage. No severe side effects or drug-related discontinuation of treatment
      were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Intravesical oxybutynin therapy seems to be a safe
      and effective treatment option for detrusor hyperreflexia in adults and avoids
      surgical treatment in most patients. Long-term observations concerning side
      effects, acceptance, and efficacy are needed.

TI  - Oxybutynin for detrusor instability with adjuvant salivary stimulant pastilles to
      improve compliance: results of a multicentre, randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 416-20
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that compliance with oxybutynin would be
      improved if the severity of dry mouth could be reduced, thus leading to improved 
      urinary symptom response and improved outcome, in a randomized, controlled trial 
      of oxybutynin with or without salivary stimulant pastilles in patients with
      detrusor instability. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-seven women with detrusor
      instability were randomized to a variable dose regimen of oxybutynin with (37) or
      without (30) salivary stimulant pastilles for 8 weeks. Patients were asked to
      complete a baseline voiding diary. In weeks 1 and 2, patients were encouraged to 
      adjust the dose of oxybutynin themselves to achieve optimum symptomatic control. 
      A second diary was completed in the sixth week and patients were reviewed at 8
      weeks. The outcome measures were the compliance rate, follow-up attendance rate, 
      maximum dose of medication, changes in voiding and incontinence episodes, and
      changes in severity of urgency and of dry mouth symptoms between the first and
      sixth week. RESULTS: Of the 67 women, 32 (47%) completed the study; the
      proportion completing was the same in both groups. Four patients had stopped the 
      medication and there was no difference in the distribution of maximum dosage
      achieved between the groups. Both groups reported a reduced severity of urgency
      symptoms and increased severity of dry mouth. There were no differences in
      reported symptom change between the groups during the study. CONCLUSIONS: The
      combination of oxybutynin and salivary stimulant pastilles does not improve
      compliance or symptom relief compared with oxybutynin alone; it does not allow a 
      greater dose of oxybutynin to be tolerated.

TI  - A risk-benefit assessment of the newer oral antifungal agents used to treat
      onychomycosis.
PG  - 33-52
AB  - The newer antifungal agents itraconazole, terbinafine and fluconazole have become
      available to treat onychomycosis over the last 10 years. During this time period 
      these agents have superseded griseofulvin as the agent of choice for
      onychomycosis. Unlike griseofulvin, the new agents have a broad spectrum of
      action that includes dermatophytes, Candida species and nondermatophyte moulds.
      Each of the 3 oral antifungal agents, terbinafine, itraconazole and fluconazole, 
      is effective against dermatophytes with relatively fewer data being available for
      the treatment of Candida species and nondermatophyte moulds. Itraconazole is
      effective against Candida onychomycosis. Terbinafine may be more effective
      against C. parapsilosis compared with C. albicans; furthermore with Candida
      species a higher dose of terbinafine or a longer duration of therapy may be
      required compared with the regimen for dermatophytes. The least amount of
      experience in treating onychomycosis is with fluconazole. Griseofulvin is not
      effective against Candida species or the nondermatophyte moulds. The main use of 
      griseo-fulvin currently is to treat tinea capitis. Ketoconazole may be used by
      some to treat tinea versicolor with the dosage regimens being short and requiring
      the use of only a few doses. The preferred regimens for the 3 oral antimycotic
      agents are as follows: itraconazole - pulse therapy with the drug being
      administered for 1 week with 3 weeks off treatment between successive pulses;
      terbinafine - continuous once daily therapy; and fluconazole - once weekly
      treatment. The regimen for the treatment of dermatophyte onychomycosis is:
      itraconazole - 200mg twice daily for I week per month x 3 pulses; terbinafine -
      250 mg/day for 12 weeks; or, fluconazole - 150 mg/wk until the abnormal-appearing
      nail plate has grown out, typically over a period of 9 to 18 months. For the 3
      oral antifungal agents the more common adverse reactions pertain to the following
      systems, gastrointestinal (for example, nausea, gastrointestinal distress,
      diarrhoea, abdominal pain), cutaneous eruption, and CNS (for example, headache
      and malaise). Each of the new antifungal agents is more cost-effective than
      griseofulvin for the treatment of onychomycosis and is associated with high
      compliance, in part because of the shorter duration of therapy. The newer
      antifungal agents are generally well tolerated with drug interactions that are
      usually predictable.

      data base (ICDB) study experience. The Interstitial Cystitis Data Base Study
      Group.
PG  - 940-5
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the frequency and types of treatments reported at
      baseline in women who entered the Interstitial Cystitis Data Base (ICDB) cohort
      study. METHODS: From 1993 to 1997, 581 women were enrolled and followed in the
      ICDB. All treatments reported at study entry, including those prescribed for
      interstitial cystitis (IC) and concomitant medications, were reviewed. The number
      and types of treatments were evaluated with respect to baseline factors such as
      prior diagnosis of IC and symptom severity. RESULTS: One hundred five (18%) women
      were receiving no therapy at baseline. Single-mode therapy was reported by 195
      (34%) women, and a combination of two treatments was reported by 119 (21%) women.
      Three or more treatments were reported in 162 (28%) women. A total of 183
      different types of therapies were recorded. The five most commonly used therapies
      for IC symptoms were cystoscopy and hydrodistention, amitriptyline,
      phenazopyridine, special diet, and intravesical heparin. Because most patients
      entered the ICDB before the approval of oral pentosan polysulfate sodium (PPS),
      only 6% of women reported oral PPS use at baseline. There were statistically
      significant associations between the number and types of treatments and clinical 
      center, a prior diagnosis of IC, and symptom severity. CONCLUSIONS: The diversity
      of IC therapies underscores the lack of understanding about the treatment of this
      syndrome. Further research in IC is essential to develop and to evaluate rational
      therapies and treatment algorithms. These algorithms should be "evidence based"
      and should be revised as the underlying etiology and pathophysiology of IC is
      delineated.

TI  - Inhibitory effects of trospium chloride on cytochrome P450 enzymes in human liver
      microsomes.
PG  - 299-304
AB  - Trospium chloride, an atropine derivative used for the treatment of urge
      incontinence, was tested for inhibitory effects on human cytochrome P450 enzymes.
      Metabolic activities were determined in liver microsomes from two donors using
      the following selective substrates: dextromethorphan (CYP2D6), denitronifedipine 
      (CYP3A4), caffeine (CYP1A2), chlorzoxazone (CYP2E1), S-(+)-mephenytoin (CYP2C19),
      S-(-)-warfarin (CYP2C9) and coumarin (CYP2A6). Incubations with each substrate
      were carried out without a possible inhibitor and in the presence of trospium
      chloride at varying concentrations (37-3000 microM) at 37 degrees in 0.1 M KH2PO4
      buffer containing up to 3% DMSO. Metabolite concentrations were determined by
      high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in all cases except CYP2A6 where
      direct fluorescence spectroscopy was used. First, trospium chloride IC50 values
      were determined for each substrate at respective K(M) concentrations. Trospium
      chloride did not show relevant inhibitory effects on the metabolism of most
      substrates (IC50 values considerably higher than 1 mM). The only clear inhibition
      was seen for the CYP2D6-dependent high-affinity O-demethylation of
      dextromethorphan, where IC50 values of 27 microM and 44 microM were observed.
      Therefore, additional dextromethorphan concentrations (0.4-2000 microM) were
      tested. Trospium chloride was a competitive inhibitor of the reaction with Ki
      values of 20 and 51 microM, respectively. Thus, trospium chloride has negligible 
      inhibitory effects on CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2E1, CYP2C19, CYP2C9 and CYP2A6 activity
      but is a reasonably potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro. Compared to therapeutic 
      trospium chloride peak plasma concentrations below 50 nM, the 1000-times higher
      competitive inhibition constant Ki however suggests that inhibition of CYP2D6 by 
      trospium chloride is without any clinical relevance.

TI  - Preparation and evaluation of tablets rapidly disintegrating in saliva containing
      bitter-taste-masked granules by the compression method.
PG  - 1451-4
AB  - The aim of this study was to prepare, using taste-masked granules, tablets which 
      can rapidly disintegrate in saliva (rapidly disintegrating tablet), of drugs with
      bitter taste (pirenzepine HCl or oxybutynin HCl). The taste-masked granules were 
      prepared using aminoalkyl methacrylate copolymers (Eudragit E-100) by the
      extrusion method. None of the drugs dissolved from the granules (% of dissolved, 
      < 5%) even at 480 min at pH 6.8 in the dissolution test. However, the drugs
      dissolved rapidly in the medium at pH 1.2 in the dissolution test. Rapidly
      disintegrating tablets were prepared using the prepared taste-masked granules,
      and a mixture of excipients consisting of crystalline cellulose (Avicel PH-102)
      and low-substituted hydroxypropylcellulose (L-HPC, LH-11). The granules and
      excipients were mixed well (mixing ratio by weight, crystalline cellulose: L-HPC 
      = 8:2) with 1% magnesium stearate, and subsequently compressed at 500-1500 kgf in
      a single-punch tableting machine. The prepared tablets (compressed at 500 kgf)
      containing the taste-masked granules have sufficient strength (the crushing
      strength: oxybutynin tablet, 3.5 kg; pirenzepine tablet, 2.2 kg), and a rapid
      disintegration time (within 20 s) was observed in the saliva of healthy
      volunteers. None of the volunteers felt any bitter taste after the disintegration
      of the tablet which contained the taste-masked granules. We confirmed that the
      rapidly disintegrating tablets can be prepared using these taste-masked granules 
      and excipients which are commonly used in tablet preparation.

TI  - Desmopressin resistant enuresis: pathogenetic and therapeutic considerations.
PG  - 2136-40
AB  - PURPOSE: We tested the role of the bladder in the pathogenesis of desmopressin
      resistant enuresis by evaluating the influence of urine production on the timing 
      of the enuretic event and the response to anticholinergic medication. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: We gave 33 children with monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis
      resistant to the standard 0.4 mg. oral dose of desmopressin 0.4 and 0.8 mg.
      desmopressin and placebo tablets for 5 nights each in a double-blind crossover
      fashion. The time of enuresis or nocturia was documented. All 9 children who had 
      at least 1 dry treatment period during the randomized portion of the study then
      received open label treatment with 0.8 mg. desmopressin. Nonresponders to this
      regimen and the remainder of the children were offered anticholinergic treatment.
      RESULTS: Average time between bedtime and voiding was 5.0, 5.6 and 5.0 hours
      during the nights with placebo, and 0.4 and 0.8 mg. desmopressin, respectively (p
      = 0.12). Of the 9 children subsequently treated with 0.8 mg. desmopressin 5
      became completely dry. Of the remaining 28 children given anticholinergic
      treatment 20 responded. CONCLUSIONS: Antidiuresis does not delay the enuretic
      event in children with desmopressin resistant enuresis. This finding and the
      favorable response to anticholinergic medication favor the hypothesis that these 
      children have nocturnal bladder instability. A subgroup of enuretic children
      responds to high but not normal doses of desmopressin.

TI  - Use of polydimethylsiloxane for endoscopic treatment of neurogenic urinary
      incontinence in children.
PG  - 2133-5
AB  - PURPOSE: We report on the injection of polydimethylsiloxane for endoscopic
      treatment of urinary incontinence in children with neurogenic bladder and
      determine the optimal criteria for patient selection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We
      have treated 17 boys and 16 girls since 1995. The etiology of incontinence was
      spina bifida in 24 cases. Previous surgery was performed in 18 patients,
      including bladder neck reconstruction in 15 and bladder augmentation in 9. Mean
      patient age at injection was 13 years (range 7 to 17). We administered 1, 2 and 3
      injections in 21, 11 and 1 patients, respectively. Mean volume at each injection 
      was 3.2 cc. Mean interval between injections was 6 months (range 3 to 15). In all
      cases injection was done transurethrally. RESULTS: Followup ranged from 6 to 41
      months (median 16). A total of 11 patients (33.3%) are dry (continence for
      greater than 4 hours and no urinary pad use during the day) and 8 (24.2%) are
      improved (continence for 2 to 3 hours and minimal pad use). Results are poor in
      14 cases. Overall previous bladder neck surgery or preoperative detrusor
      hyperactivity did not influence results. Good results were mainly associated with
      female gender (47.4% of girls versus 10.5% of boys achieved cure). CONCLUSIONS:
      Injection of polydimethylsiloxane at the bladder neck resulted in continence in
      33% of neurogenic bladder cases. Better results occurred in girls and injection
      did not compromise other surgical procedures. Polydimethylsiloxane seems more
      suitable than bovine collagen due to potential problems with biological product
      use.

TI  - Oxybutynin disrupts learning and memory in the rat passive avoidance response.
PG  - 393-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: oxybutynin, a drug for pollakisuria and urinary incontinence, has a
      potent antimuscarinic activity. This study was aimed to determine whether this
      drug disrupts learning and memory in rats, because antimuscarinic activity in the
      central nervous system is considered to cause amnesia in humans. METHODS: male
      Wistar rats were given oxybutynin or scopolamine as a reference drug, and
      subjected to the acquisition trial of step-through passive avoidance response
      (PAR). Twenty-four hours later the retention test for each rat was performed and 
      the latency time in the PAR was measured. RESULTS: oral administration of
      oxybutynin at 30 mg/kg or higher and intraperitonial injection of scoplamine at
      0.5 mg/kg caused a significant decrease in the latency time in the retention
      test. CONCLUSIONS: oxubutynin caused a decrease in the retention time of the PAR 
      in a manner similar to scopolamine, indicating that oxybutynin may cause
      disruption of learning and memory.

TI  - Tolterodine use for symptoms of overactive bladder.
PG  - 1073-82
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and
      safety of tolterodine for the treatment of overactive bladder. DATA SOURCES:
      Published articles and abstracts were identified from a MEDLINE search (January
      1980-October 1998) using the terms tolterodine, PNU-200583E, urge incontinence,
      overactive bladder, detrusor instability, detrusor overactivity, and
      antimuscarinic. Pertinent articles written in English were considered for review.
      Additional articles were identified from the bibliographies of retrieved
      articles. Data from the Food and Drug Administration-approved product labeling
      and the manufacturer were also used in the absence of published data. STUDY
      SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Clinical studies of tolterodine involving human
      subjects were evaluated. DATA SYNTHESIS: Tolterodine is a competitive muscarinic 
      receptor antagonist with relative functional selectivity for bladder muscarinic
      receptors. It is metabolized in the liver by CYP2D6 to an active metabolite (DD
      01), which is partially responsible for its pharmacologic activity. Those who are
      genetically devoid of CYP2D6 will have higher concentrations of the parent
      compound and virtually undetectable concentrations of DD 01; however, the
      clinical efficacy does not appear to be altered. In dosages of 2 mg twice daily, 
      tolterodine has shown consistent reductions in the number of micturitions per 24 
      hours and less consistently decreased incontinence episodes in patients with
      detrusor overactivity. The functional selectivity of tolterodine for bladder
      muscarinic receptors results in fewer systemic adverse effects, such as dry
      mouth, than occur with comparable nonselective antimuscarinic agents.
      CONCLUSIONS: Clinical studies have shown that the effectiveness of tolterodine
      for symptoms of overactive bladder is similar to that of oxybutynin. The adverse 
      effect profiles of tolterodine and oxybutynin are similar; however, comparative
      clinical trials have shown significantly fewer patients taking tolterodine
      require dosage reductions or discontinue therapy due to antimuscarinic adverse
      effects such as dry mouth. Although more costly than oxybutynin, tolterodine
      represents a modest improvement over oxybutynin with respect to adverse effect
      profile, which may allow more patients with incontinence to tolerate therapeutic 
      doses. Further research is necessary to determine whether tolterodine has
      clinical advantages over similar agents in patients with other muscarinic adverse
      effects, such as constipation or cognitive impairment.

TI  - Advantages and risks of ileovesicostomy for the management of neuropathic
      bladder.
PG  - 636-40
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and complications of ileovesicostomy in
      patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction. METHODS: Fifteen consecutive
      neurologically impaired patients (8 from multiple sclerosis, 4 from spinal cord
      injury, 3 from other causes) with complications of previous bladder management
      underwent ileovesicostomy. There were 10 women and 5 men. All patients were
      either poor candidates for or refused continent urinary diversion or bladder
      augmentation cystoplasty. RESULTS: At a mean follow-up of 23.2 months, 14 of 15
      patients had low-pressure urine drainage through their ileovesicostomy. Four
      women with documented preoperative detrusor hyperreflexia had postoperative
      intermittent mild urge incontinence per native urethra. They did not require any 
      further treatment, except for oral anticholinergic drugs (oxybutynin and
      tolterodine). Because of persistent severe urge incontinence, 1 woman required
      conversion of her ileovesicostomy to an ileal conduit with concurrent cystectomy.
      The ileovesicostomy of another myelodysplastic man who had four failed artificial
      urinary sphincters in the past was also converted to an ileal conduit because of 
      persistent urethroperineal fistula despite perineal urethral closure. Renal
      function was preserved in all patients. Long-term complications were stomal
      stenosis in 2 patients, bladder and kidney stone formation in 5, and symptomatic 
      urinary tract infections in 3. CONCLUSIONS: Ileovesicostomy can be safely
      performed in neurologically impaired women and men. Severe preoperative detrusor 
      hyperreflexia with urge incontinence appears to be a risk factor for persistent
      urge incontinence postoperatively in women. Continued routine urologic
      surveillance for infection and stones is mandatory. Ileovesicostomy is a
      versatile procedure for neurologically impaired patients, because it can be
      converted to a conventional ileal conduit if necessary. In addition, in cases of 
      neural recovery, the ileal "chimney" can be excised and the patient's original
      lower urinary tract would be preserved.

TI  - [Oxybutinin-desmopressin association in the treatment of primary nocturnal
      enuresis with diurnal urination disorders].
PG  - 149-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since most of the children observed in our Centre present enuresis
      with voiding disturbance, we carried out a study where these patients were
      treated with the DDAVP + Oxybutinin association. METHODS: We have treated 89
      children with enuresis and voiding disturbances (urge incontinence, voiding
      urgency, urinated > 7 times a day), administering a drugs combination of
      desmopressin (20 micrograms/daily) and oxybutinin (0.3-0.6 mg/kg/bid or tid) for 
      a variable period, depending on response to the treatment. RESULTS: The results
      demonstrate the efficacy of this association: we have observed a reduction in
      average bed wetting nights from 23.4 nights/month to 6.4 wet nights after 1
      month, to 3.8 ad 2.9 respectively after 3 and 6 months from the beginning.
      Moreover we obtained a recovery of all daily voiding disturbances after 3 months.
      Fifty percent of children were cured after 4 months of therapy and finally 93.2% 
      recovered at 6 months. On the other hand, 2 children were no-responders to the
      therapy even after 9 months of combined drugs administration. CONCLUSIONS: Based 
      on these results we can affirm that children with nocturnal enuresis and voiding 
      disturbance can be treated with this combined therapy. Actually, the reduction of
      urinary output and thus lower bladder filling, due to the desmopressin, decreases
      the onset of uninhibited bladder contractions and enhances oxybutinin activity.

TI  - Neurogenic bladder dysfunction.
PG  - 303-7
AB  - Urodynamics are still essential for diagnosis and prognosis of neurogenic lower
      urinary tract-dysfunction and can not be replaced by other means of investigation
      so far, neither by a thorough clinical investigation nor by sophisticated means
      like magnetic resonance imaging. The findings with clinical investigations are
      specific, but not sensitive enough, and the spinal cord lesions may sometimes be 
      beyond the resolution of magnetic resonance-scanning. Pharmacotherapy is still
      the corner stone in the management of detrusor hyperreflexia. Further studies
      with tolterodine, oxybutynin, trospiumchloride and propiverine have increased our
      knowledge about these substances. Capsaicin was proved to be the effective
      substance and not the alcoholic solution, which serves as a carrier. Intrathecal 
      clonidine may represent a new conservative reversible alternative treatment for
      detrusor hyperreflexia. Experiments with detrusor strips from end-stage
      MMC-patients may explain the relative resistance of the low compliant bladder to 
      the common anticholinergic/spasmolytic therapy. The differential indication for
      bladder augmentation, either using segments of the gastrointestinal-tract or
      performing a partial detrusor myectomy is ongoing, favourable results are
      reported for both techniques. Sacral posterior root rhizotomy is able to abolish 
      detrusor hyperreflexia and therefore recommended for tetra- and paraplegics,
      however autonomic dysreflexia, if present, can not be totally abolished. Collagen
      injections for neuropathic sphincter incompetence can not be recommended as
      demonstrated in children with congenital neuropathy, a new design of an
      artificial sphincter must stand the test of time.

      urgency.
PG  - 12-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Anticholinergic drug is widely accepted as an effective medication for
      frequency, urgency and urge incontinence related to detrusor overactivity (motor 
      urgency). In order to elucidate whether anticholinergic drug is also effective
      for these symptoms related to bladder hypersensitivity (sensory urgency),
      clinical efficacy of oxybutynin on sensory urgency was compared with that on
      motor urgency. METHOD: Twenty-four patients with sensory urgency, and 53 patients
      with motor urgency were treated with oxybutynin (6 mg/day) for 4 weeks and
      subjective and objective efficacies were evaluated. Subjective parameters were
      quantified with urge score (grade 0-3) and daily numbers of voiding and
      incontinence. Objective efficacies were evaluated with pre-/ postcomparison of
      cystometric parameters. RESULTS: Excellent or good overall efficacy was obtained 
      in 62.5% (15/24) of the sensory urgency group and 60.4% (32/53) of the motor
      urgency group. There was no statistical difference between these two groups.
      Objective cystometric parameters, bladder volume at first sensation and maximum
      cystometric capacity, statistically improved after the treatment in both groups. 
      CONCLUSION: The results suggest that oxybutynin works as well on sensory urgency 
      as it does on motor urgency.

TI  - Treatment of urge incontinence in Veterans Affairs medical centers.
PG  - 867-77
AB  - Urinary incontinence has far-reaching medical, psychological, social, and
      economic effects. The objectives of this descriptive study were to examine
      utilization patterns and discontinuation rates of various pharmacologic agents
      used to treat symptoms of overactive bladder, primarily urge incontinence (UI),
      and to estimate the prevalence of urinary incontinence in the study population.
      Patient-level data regarding specific drugs used to treat UI and the use of
      diapers or pads over a 9-month period from October 1995 to May 1996 were
      retrospectively extracted from the medication databases of 9 Department of
      Veterans Affairs medical centers. A total of 2233 male patients were included in 
      the analyses. Most patients were receiving oxybutynin chloride (39.8%),
      dicyclomine hydrochloride (16.0%), or imipramine hydrochloride (13.9%), and the
      remaining 30.3% were using flavoxate hydrochloride, propantheline bromide,
      hyoscyamine sulfate, and adult diapers or pads. Overall, 72.1% of patients had
      been prescribed daily dosages within the recommended dosing ranges for these
      medications. The majority (91.3%) of patients had not switched to another UI
      medication during the study period. Based on a chronic disease index, 47.6% of
      patients had 2 or fewer chronic diseases. Using pooled prevalence estimates, the 
      estimated percentage of patients who had ever experienced UI in this population
      ranged from 7.4% to 20.8%; however, a considerably smaller percentage were taking
      medications for the treatment of UI. The results of this study suggest that
      oxybutynin, dicyclomine, and imipramine are the agents most commonly used to
      treat urinary incontinence within Veterans Affairs medical centers. The majority 
      of patients who received a prescription for one of these drugs did not routinely 
      refill the medication over the course of the study. There are many reasons for
      patients not to refill a prescription (eg, ineffectiveness, side effects,
      complications, obtaining the drug from another source), but the present study did
      not address the causes.

TI  - Pharmacological management of incontinence.
PG  - 89-95
AB  - Many patients with incontinence do not need surgery - for these patients symptoms
      can often be considerably improved by conservative measures, including drugs.
      Several different pharmacological actions are potentially useful depending on the
      underlying cause of the incontinence: a) Detrusor instability (DI) responds to
      drugs reducing bladder contractility: Anticholinergic agents, e.g. oxybutynin and
      tolterodine, act at postganglionic parasympathetic cholinergic receptor sites on 
      the detrusor muscle, reducing the strength of the detrusor contraction. Tricyclic
      antidepressants, e.g. imipramine, have anticholinergic effects, block presynaptic
      uptake of amine neurotransmitters and directly inhibit detrusor muscle.
      Alpha-adrenergic antagonists may have a role to play by dual actions on bladder
      overactivity (due to altered receptor function) and by reducing outlet
      resistance. b) Genuine stress incontinence (GSI) may be treated using
      alpha-adrenergic agonists, e.g. phenylpropanolamine, to increase outlet
      resistance by stimulating smooth muscle of the urethra and bladder neck. c) In
      nocturnal enuresis reduction of nocturnal urine output with the anti-diuretic
      hormone (ADH) analogue DDAVP (1-deamino, 8-arginine vasopressin) is beneficial.
      d) Bladder emptying may be facilitated in patients with retention and 'overflow' 
      incontinence by alpha-adrenergic antagonists, which reduce outlet resistance, and
      perhaps by parasympathomimetics, e.g. bethanecol. e) In postmenopausal women,
      systemic oestrogen replacement reduces filling symptoms including urge
      incontinence. Evidence for oestrogen replacement alone in GSI is lacking, but
      combination with alpha-agonists is beneficial in milder GSI. For the future,
      tolterodine and other new anticholinergics offer the hope of treatment for DI
      with fewer of the side effects that limit the use of established drugs. Better
      understanding of the pathophysiology of DI may provide new targets for drug
      therapy, such as hyperpolarisation of detrusor muscle membrane. Alpha-agonists
      may find a greater role in the future, as may ADH analogues for noctural
      symptoms.

TI  - Comparative pharmacology of recombinant human M3 and M5 muscarinic receptors
      expressed in CHO-K1 cells.
PG  - 590-6
AB  - 1. Affinity estimates were obtained for several muscarinic antagonists against
      carbachol-stimulated [3H]-inositol phosphates accumulation in Chinese hamster
      ovary (CHO-KI) cells stably expressing either human muscarinic M3 or M5 receptor 
      subtypes. The rationale for these studies was to generate a functional antagonist
      affinity profile for the M5 receptor subtype and compare this with that of the M3
      receptor, in order to identify compounds which discriminate between these two
      subtypes. 2. The rank order of antagonist apparent affinities (pK(B)) at the
      muscarinic M5 receptor was atropine (8.7) > or =tolterodine (8.6) =
      4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine (4-DAMP, 8.6)> darifenacin (7.7) > or
      =zamifenacin (7.6)>oxybutynin (6.6)= para-fluorohexahydrosiladifenidol
      (p-F-HHSiD, 6.6)>pirenzepine (6.4) > or = methoctramine (6.3)=himbacine
      (6.3)>AQ-RA 741 (6.1). 3. Antagonist apparent affinities for both receptor
      subtypes compare well with published binding affinity estimates. No antagonist
      displayed greater selectivity for the muscarinic M5 subtype over the M3 subtype, 
      but himbacine, AQ-RA 741, p-F-HHSiD, darifenacin and oxybutynin displayed between
      9- and 60 fold greater selectivity for the muscarinic M3 over the M5 subtype. 4. 
      This study highlights the similarity in pharmacological profiles of M3 and M5
      receptor subtypes and identifies five antagonists that may represent useful tools
      for discriminating between these two subtypes. Collectively, these data show that
      in the absence of a high affinity M5 selective antagonist, affinity data for a
      large range of antagonists is critical to define operationally the M5 receptor
      subtype.

TI  - An extended-release formulation of oxybutynin chloride for the treatment of
      overactive urinary bladder.
PG  - 634-42
AB  - Detrusor instability, or urinary incontinence, is common in elderly patients,
      particularly elderly women. The clinical symptoms of overactive, or unstable,
      urinary bladder include urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency. Mixed 
      urinary incontinence, which comprises urge urinary incontinence and stress
      incontinence, is manifested by increased intraabdominal pressure on coughing or
      sneezing. The detrusor muscle of the bladder is under the control of the
      parasympathetic, or muscarinic, nervous system. The drug of choice in this
      condition is oxybutynin chloride, which has the ability to block acetylcholine
      released from parasympathetic nerves in the urinary bladder, preventing
      contractions of the muscle and exerting a direct spasmolytic effect on the
      bladder. A new extended-release oral tablet formulation, OROS oxybutynin, uses
      osmotic pressure to deliver the drug at a controlled rate over approximately 24
      hours. It resembles a conventional tablet but has a two-part core consisting of a
      drug layer and below it, a "push" layer containing osmotically active components,
      the whole surrounded by a semipermeable membrane with a laser-drilled opening in 
      the drug side. Water in the gastrointestinal tract enters the tablet and mixes
      with the drug to form a suspension. The "push" layer expands and pushes the
      suspended drug out of the orifice and into the gastrointestinal tract for
      eventual absorption. Pharmacokinetic studies have indicated a slow rise in mean
      plasma concentration of the isomer R-oxybutynin for 4 to 6 hours after a single
      dose of OROS oxybutynin, followed by maintenance of steady concentrations for up 
      to 24 hours, minimizing the fluctuations between peak and trough associated with 
      TID dosing of 5-mg immediate-release oxybutynin tablets. Efficacy and safety
      studies comparing the extended-release with the immediate-release formulation of 
      oxybutynin demonstrated equivalent efficacy in patients with overactive urinary
      bladder. The adverse-event profile of oxybutynin is similar to that of a typical 
      anticholinergic agent such as atropine--dry mouth, constipation, somnolence,
      blurred vision, headache, and gastrointestinal pain--although in 2 clinical
      studies, the incidence of dry mouth was less with the extended-release
      formulation. Once-daily dosing with OROS oxybutynin appears to be well tolerated 
      and effective, as well as convenient, for the treatment of overactive bladder,
      particularly for elderly patients using multiple medications.

TI  - Inhibition of airway hyperreactivity by oxybutynin chloride in subjects with
      cervical spinal cord injury.
PG  - 279-83
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To further investigate mechanisms of airway hyperreactivity among
      subjects with chronic cervical spinal cord injury (SCI), we assessed airway
      responsiveness to aerosolized methacholine and histamine in subjects receiving
      chronic oxybutynin chloride therapy, and compared the findings with those not
      receiving the agent. METHODS: Twenty-five male subjects with cervical SCI
      participated in this study; 12 were maintained on oral oxybutynin chloride and 13
      served as age-matched controls. Six of the 12 subjects receiving oxybutynin were 
      challenged with aerosolized methacholine, and six with histamine; seven of the 13
      control subjects were challenged with aerosolized methacholine and the remaining 
      six with histamine. RESULTS: All 13 control subjects and all six
      oxybutynin/histamine subjects exhibited a significant bronchoconstrictor response
      (PC20 < 8 mg/ml), whereas mean PC20 values for the oxybutynin/methacholine group 
      were > or =25 mg/ml. CONCLUSION: Our finding that the bronchoconstrictor effects 
      of methacholine were blocked by oxybutynin chloride while those of histamine were
      not suggests that oxybutynin acts primarily through anticholinergic pathways
      rather than by causing generalized airway smooth muscle relaxation.

TI  - Tolterodine in the treatment of overactive bladder: analysis of the pooled phase 
      II efficacy and safety data.
PG  - 990-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To summarize the efficacy and safety of tolterodine from the pooled
      data of four multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      dose-ranging, parallel-group Phase II studies in patients with urodynamically
      proved overactive bladder (detrusor instability or detrusor hyperreflexia) and to
      analyze the concentration-effect relation. METHODS: After a 1-week run-in period 
      to establish baseline values, 319 patients were randomized to receive placebo or 
      tolterodine 0.5, 1, 2, or 4 mg twice daily. Micturition diary and urodynamic
      variables and subjective urinary symptoms were assessed after 2 weeks of
      treatment. Patients were classified as "extensive" or "poor" metabolizers of
      tolterodine on the basis of serum levels of tolterodine. RESULTS: A per-protocol 
      analysis of efficacy in 262 patients showed dose-related improvements in
      micturition diary and urodynamic variables. A dosage of 4 mg twice daily was,
      however, associated with an increase in residual urinary volume. The incidence of
      adverse events (mainly mild or moderate antimuscarinic effects) was comparable
      between placebo and tolterodine dosages of 2 mg twice daily. No serious
      drug-related adverse events were observed, and tolterodine had no clinically
      significant impact on electrocardiographic or laboratory findings. Changes in
      urodynamic variables were found to be related to the sum of unbound serum
      concentrations of tolterodine and its major active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. In
      poor and extensive metabolizers of tolterodine, exposure to the sum of these
      active moieties was similar, and the efficacy and safety profiles were
      comparable. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this pooled data analysis indicate that
      tolterodine offers an effective treatment for patients with urinary symptoms
      attributable to overactive bladder. The optimal dosage is 1 to 2 mg twice daily, 
      irrespective of metabolic phenotype.

TI  - Tolterodine, a new antimuscarinic drug for treatment of bladder overactivity.
PG  - 267-80
AB  - Tolterodine is a nonsubtype selective antimuscarinic agent recently approved as
      therapy in patients with overactive bladder with symptoms of urinary frequency,
      urgency, or urge incontinence. It acts by muscarinic receptor blockade in the
      bladder wall and detrusor muscle. Despite short terminal disposition half-lives
      of 2-3 and 3-4 hours for tolterodine and its active 5-hydroxy metabolite,
      respectively, twice/day dosing is effective due to the drug's prolonged
      pharmacodynamic effects. Dosage adjustment is recommended in the presence of
      hepatic impairment and during concurrent therapy with drugs that inhibit
      cytochrome P450 2D6 and 3A4 isozymes. Tolterodine significantly reduces
      clinically relevant end points such as number of micturitions and number of
      incontinence episodes/day. In general, it is superior to placebo and equivalent
      to oxybutynin in this regard. As might be expected from its pharmacologic
      profile, the principal adverse effects of the drug are anticholinergic. In
      clinical trials, tolterodine was tolerated significantly better than oxybutynin. 
      Its relative merits as a first- or second-line agent for patients intolerant of
      oxybutynin are unclear. Until pharmacoeconomic analyses are conducted that
      clearly justify use of this more expensive agent, tolterodine is perhaps best
      reserved for patients who are intolerant of or fail oxybutynin therapy.

TI  - Serum protein binding of tolterodine and its major metabolites in humans and
      several animal species.
PG  - 91-9
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine in vitro protein binding of tolterodine
      and its 5-hydroxymethyl (5-HM) and N-dealkylated metabolites in serum from humans
      and several animal species at concentrations similar to those obtained in
      clinical and preclinical studies. Binding of tolterodine and the two metabolites 
      to human serum albumin and alpha1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) was also assessed, as
      was binding of tolterodine to red blood cells. Ex vivo protein binding of
      tolterodine and 5-HM was determined in serum samples from healthy volunteers
      treated with oral tolterodine 4 mg twice daily for 8 days. Tolterodine exhibited 
      high protein binding in human serum; the unbound fraction (f(u)) was 3.7%. The
      unbound fraction of tolterodine in cat and dog serum (1.5 and 2.1%, respectively)
      was lower compared with human serum; f(u) was higher in the other species
      investigated (rat, 22%; mouse, 16-17%; rabbit, 39%). The unbound fraction of 5-HM
      was much higher in serum from humans (36%) and all animal species investigated
      (mouse, 72%; rabbit, 68%; cat, 32%; dog, 45%). Binding of N-dealkylated
      tolterodine to proteins in human serum was intermediate (f(u) 14%). AAG was the
      major binding protein for tolterodine and 5-HM, and the degree of binding
      increased with increasing concentration of the protein. The association constant 
      of 5-HM for AAG was lower than that of tolterodine (1.3 x 10(5) M(-1) versus 2.1 
      x 10(6) M(-1)). The blood:plasma tolterodine concentration ratio was 0.6 in both 
      humans and dog; thus, a minor fraction of tolterodine was present in red blood
      cells compared with plasma (0.18 and 0.36, respectively). In the mouse,
      tolterodine was equally present in blood and plasma. In ex vivo samples, f(u)
      values for tolterodine (pH adjusted) varied between 1.6 and 4.9% (mean 2.8%),
      which could be explained by differences in AAG concentrations. There was good
      correlation between observed f(u) values for tolterodine and those predicted on
      the basis of AAG levels. Similar findings were observed for 5-HM.

PG  - 223-30
AB  - Tolterodine,
      (R)-N,N-diisopropyl-3-(2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl)-3-phenylpropanamine+ ++, is an
      antimuscarinic drug developed for the treatment of overactive bladder with
      symptoms of frequency, urgency and urge incontinence. We investigated the effects
      of tolterodine and its major active metabolite, DD 01 (PNU-200577),
      (R)-N,N-diisopropyl-3-(2-hydroxy-5-hydroxymethylphenyl)-3-phenylpropa namine, on 
      the contractions induced by carbachol, KCl, CaCl2 and electrical field
      stimulation in human isolated urinary bladder smooth muscles, using the muscle
      bath technique. Specimens of human urinary bladder were obtained from 20 patients
      who underwent total cystectomy due to malignant bladder tumor. The detrusor
      preparations were taken from the intact part of the dome region of the bladder.
      Carbachol (10(-9)-10(-2) M) caused concentration-dependent contraction of human
      detrusor smooth muscles. Tolterodine (10(-9)-10(-6) M), DD 01 (10(-9)-10(-6) M), 
      oxybutynin (10(-8)-10(-6) M), propiverine (10(-8)-10(-6) M), atropine
      (10(-9)-10(-6) M), pirenzepine (10(-8)-10(-5) M), methoctramine (10(-8)-10(-5) M)
      and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine (4-DAMP) (10(-9)-10(-6) M) caused
      typical shifts to the right of the concentration-response curves for carbachol,
      except for higher concentrations (10(-5) M) of oxybutynin and propiverine, which 
      caused a decrease of about 30% of the maximum contractile responses to carbachol.
      All the slopes of the regression lines of Schild plots were close to unity, and
      the rank order of pA2 values was: atropine = DD 01 = tolterodine = 4-DAMP =
      oxybutynin > propiverine = pirenzepine > methoctramine. Tolterodine
      (10(-9)-10(-6) M) and DD 01 (10(-9)-10(-6) M) did not inhibit the KCl-induced (80
      mM) and CaCl2-induced (5 mM) contractions, while oxybutynin (10(-8)-10(-5) M) and
      propiverine (10(-8)-10(-5) M) significantly inhibited the contractions.
      Electrical field stimulation (2-60 Hz) caused frequency-dependent contraction of 
      human detrusor smooth muscles, which were significantly inhibited by various
      drugs. In the presence of 10(-6) M atropine, tolterodine and DD 01 did not
      inhibit the residual contractions induced by electrical field stimulation at any 
      of the frequencies, while oxybutynin (10(-5) M) and propiverine (10(-5) M)
      significantly inhibited the atropine-resistant part of the contractions. The
      results suggest that the inhibitory effects of tolterodine and DD 01 are mediated
      only by their antimuscarinic action, which is equal to that of oxybutynin and
      significantly greater than that of propiverine, and that tolterodine and DD 01
      have neither Ca2+ channel antagonist action nor inhibitory effect on the
      atropine-resistant part of the contractions in human detrusor smooth muscles.
      These findings support the usefulness of tolterodine as a therapeutic drug for
      overactive bladder with symptoms of frequency, urgency and urge incontinence.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide information regarding the most important properties of the 
      new therapeutic agents marketed in 1998. DATA SOURCES: Published studies, drug
      information reference sources, and product labeling. DATA SYNTHESIS: In 1998, 44 
      new therapeutic agents were marketed. The indications and information on dosage
      and administration for each new agent are reviewed, as are the most important
      pharmacokinetic properties, adverse events, drug interactions, and other
      precautions. Practical considerations for the use of the new agents are also
      discussed. Where possible, the properties of the new drugs are compared with
      those of older drugs marketed for the same indications. CONCLUSION: A number of
      the new therapeutic agents marketed in 1998 have important advantages over older 
      medications. An understanding of the properties of these agents is important for 
      the pharmacist to effectively counsel patients about their use and to serve as a 
      valuable source of information for other health professionals regarding these
      drugs.

TI  - A review of the quality-of-life aspects of urinary urge incontinence.
PG  - 11-23
AB  - Urinary incontinence (UI) is prevalent and costly, occurring in 15 to 30% of the 
      US population over the age of 60 years. Among people aged 15 to 64 years, UI
      occurs in 1.5 to 5% of men and 10 to 25% of women. Severe incontinence occurs in 
      6% of the general US population, and it is estimated that $US10 billion per year 
      is spent in direct costs alone on care for these patients. This review presents a
      description of the various types of UI and describes the prevalence and costs of 
      the condition. In addition, 3 approaches to assessing the impact of UI on quality
      of life are discussed, namely generic measures, disease-specific measures and
      qualitative approaches. We also review papers on UI and sexual functioning, UI in
      men, and some aspects of treatment. The review was conducted in the process of
      developing a new disease-specific measure for urinary urge incontinence (UUI). In
      general, the literature suggests that UUI has a greater impact than stress
      incontinence on quality of life, and that UI affects social and psychological
      functioning more than physical functioning. Only in a minority of individuals is 
      the impact of UI disabling; however, most individuals with UI show significant
      reduction in their social functioning. Several studies suggest that the impact of
      UI is not solely a function of its severity, but also depends on individual
      coping abilities. Some studies also indicate that the social problems associated 
      with UI grow with time, but it is not clear if that is a function of increasing
      severity of the condition, or the particular adaptations required for coping with
      this problem. An important distinction appears to be the ability of individuals
      to avoid public notice of their condition because of uncontrolled accidents. In
      summary, there is a need for a new measure of the quality-of-life impact of UUI
      that is based on the literature and on in-depth interviews with patients.

TI  - Clinical efficacy and tolerability of extended-release tolterodine and
      immediate-release oxybutynin in Japanese and Korean patients with an overactive
      bladder: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 741-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare extended-release (ER) tolterodine and immediate-release
      (IR) oxybutynin with placebo in Japanese and Korean patients with an overactive
      bladder (OAB). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Men and women aged >or= 20 years with
      symptoms of urinary urgency, urinary frequency (>or= 8 micturitions/24 h), urge
      incontinence (>or= 5 episodes/week) and symptoms of OAB for >or= 6 months were
      randomized to double-blind treatment with tolterodine ER 4 mg once daily,
      oxybutynin IR 3 mg three times daily or placebo for 12 weeks. Efficacy
      assessments included changes from baseline in numbers of incontinence episodes
      per week, voids/24 h and mean volume voided/void. Patient perceptions of bladder 
      condition, urgency and treatment benefit were also assessed. RESULTS: In all, 608
      patients were randomized to treatment with tolterodine (240), oxybutynin (246) or
      placebo (122). More patients prematurely withdrew on oxybutynin (23%) than with
      tolterodine (10.4%) or placebo (16.4%). After 12 weeks of treatment, the median
      number of incontinence episodes/week was reduced significantly more in the
      tolterodine (79%; P= 0.0027) and oxybutynin groups (76.5%; P= 0.0168) than on
      placebo (46.4%). There were also significantly greater improvements in the number
      of voids/24 h and volume voided/void with tolterodine and oxybutynin than with
      placebo. More patients in the tolterodine and oxybutynin than in the placebo
      groups reported improvements in perceived bladder condition, ability to hold
      urine and treatment benefit. Patients treated with oxybutynin reported more
      adverse events than those treated with tolterodine or placebo. Dry mouth was
      significantly more common with oxybutynin than with tolterodine (53.7% vs. 33.5%;
      P < 0.001), and occurred in 9.8% of placebo patients. CONCLUSION: Tolterodine ER 
      has similar efficacy but is better tolerated than oxybutynin IR in Japanese and
      Korean patients with OAB.

TI  - Evaluation and management of urinary incontinence in elderly women.
PG  - 491-5
AB  - Urinary incontinence is a common problem among older women, with a great impact
      on their quality of life, self-esteem and ability to live independently. Although
      often neglected by both patients and health-care providers, a variety of
      behavioral, pharmacologic and surgical interventions are now available to resolve
      or improve the symptoms of most older women who are incontinent. Since many of
      the factors which contribute to continence in late life lie outside of the
      bladder, the assessment of urinary incontinence in older women must extend beyond
      the genitourinary tract, assessing domains such as mobility, fluid balance and
      cognition. The primary care physician in uniquely placed in being able to
      diagnose this problem, to initiate treatment in many patients and to refer those 
      requiring additional specialized expertise.

TI  - Sexuality and disease.
PG  - 563-73
AB  - Disease is commonly associated with sexual dysfunction in both men and women. In 
      many cases, effective treatments are available that can improve libido, erectile 
      dysfunction, and vaginal dryness. Sexual problems in older persons with disease
      often lead to anxiety, marital discord, and withdrawal. It is the responsibility 
      of all health care professionals to inquire about sexuality in all patients, no
      matter what the patient's age, and to be aware that frailty [79-81] is not, in
      itself, a barrier to sexuality. Health professionals need to give education,
      support, and counseling on sexuality for patients with disease.

TI  - [Non-coordinated micturition syndrome mimicking posterior urethral valves in a
      male neonate].
PG  - 134-8
AB  - High-grade of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) has been reported in association with
      prenatal diagnosis of abnormal bladder function in a male neonate with
      postpatally no anatomical urethral obstruction and bladder dysfunction. This
      study was designed to describe clinical presentation of this entity in male
      neonates, the urodynamic pattern, prognosis in terms of renal function and
      therapeutic management since birth, in our experience with four cases. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: We reviewed the records of 4 male neonates diagnosed at birth of
      bilateral high-grade VUR (grade > or = 4) with prenatally diagnosed
      hydronephrosis; thus 8 refluxing renal units (RRU) were studied. All cases had
      renal failure at birth. In all cases dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renography
      was performed. All RRU had reflux nephropathy; 5 RRU had moderate impairment of
      renal function (20-40%). In 3 RUU was demonstrated by a severe decrease in renal 
      function (10-20% in 2 RUU, and less than 10% in 1 RUU). Micturating
      cystouretrography (MCUG) excluded the presence of posterior urethral valves;
      however, in all cases a tightened bladder neck ("bladder neck impression") was
      present. Endoscopy was performed in one baby excluding posterior urethral valves.
      Follow up ranged from 2 to 5 years (mean 3.5). RESULTS: In all 4 cases underwent 
      transient urinary diversion during their first month of life. Urodynamic study
      revealed a high-risk bladder with low compliance, a reduced functional bladder
      capacity and a high residual urine volume in all cases. All the patients was
      placed on antibiotic prophylaxis and oral oxybutinin chloride. Three patients
      underwent bilateral Cohen ureteral reimplantation. The other boy underwent left
      nephrectomy, right Politano ureteral reimplantation and ureterocystoplasty. In
      the 7 RRU postoperative MCUG revealed cessation of reflux. Currently therapy
      includes antibiotic prophylaxis in 4, oral oxybutinin in 4 and intermittent
      catheterisation in 2 patients. 3 patients have normal renal function. The other
      boy underwent re-diversion because of renal failure. CONCLUSIONS: Fetal severe
      bilateral reflux nephropathy is a clinical entity almost exclusively in male
      neonate mimicking hyper-pressure syndrome due to urethral obstruction, in terms
      of evolution (to chronification and renal failure) and treatment (that requires
      primordial management of bladder dysfunction). Absence of anatomical urethral
      obstruction and urodynamic pattern suggest functional obstruction of bladder
      neck-periurethral sphincter complex in fetal life as a cause for this syndrome.
      For this reason we consider it as a clinical presentation of fetal
      non-coordinated voiding in male or "posterior urethral valves like syndrome".

TI  - Trospium chloride for the treatment of detrusor instability in children.
PG  - 1978-81
AB  - PURPOSE: We assessed the efficacy and most appropriate dosage of trospium
      chloride (TCl) for managing bladder instability in children as compared with a
      placebo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 58 patients with bladder instability
      were allocated at random to 1 of 5 groups-10, 15, 20 or 25 mg TCl, or placebo
      administered daily in a multicenter, randomized, single-blind clinical study.
      Patients were treated for 21 days, and current symptoms, voiding diary and
      urodynamic values were collected at the beginning and end of the treatment
      period. All adverse events were recorded at the last visit. RESULTS: Of 50
      patients treated with TCl 41 (82%) had a positive therapeutic result (excellent, 
      good or fair) versus only 3 of 8 patients with improvement in the placebo group
      (37.5%, p = 0.006). In all responding patients clinical symptoms either resolved 
      or decreased markedly, and in 37 (74%) this improvement was accompanied by
      urodynamic improvement. In these 37 children the average number of uninhibited
      contractions decreased by 54.3% (p <0.0001) and the volume at first contraction
      increased by 71.4% (p = 0.001). There were no statistically significant
      differences with regard to therapeutic efficacy between TCl dosages. Fourteen
      patients (9 with TCl, 5 with placebo) showed no clinical improvement, although
      some had improved urodynamic parameters. Furthermore, TCl was well tolerated with
      few patients (10%) experiencing adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: Trospium chloride
      (10 to 25 mg total daily dosage, split into 2 doses) is an effective option for
      the management of detrusor instability in children.

TI  - Does treatment with clean intermittent catheterization in boys with posterior
      urethral valves affect bladder and renal function?
PG  - 1681-5; discussion 1685
AB  - PURPOSE: In boys with resected posterior urethral valves (PUV) deterioration of
      renal function is seen during childhood and adolescence, which may partly be
      caused by bladder dysfunction. We present data on renal and bladder function
      initially and at followup of boys with PUV in whom the bladder dysfunction has
      been treated since infancy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 35 boys
      with PUV. Bladder regimen, including early toilet training from the age of 1.5
      years and detrusor relaxant drugs for the treatment of incontinence from ages 4
      to 6 years, was introduced to all patients. A total of 19 boys were started on
      clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) at a median age of 8 months due to
      pronounced bladder dysfunction with poor emptying, unsafe pressure levels, high
      grade reflux and renal impairment. RESULTS: No serious complications of CIC have 
      been seen during followup. Of the 19 boys 2 stopped performing CIC due to
      noncompliance of the parents at 1 and 3 years, respectively. Initial renal
      function, measured as median glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in percent of
      expected for age, was 60% in the CIC group and 90% in the nonCIC group. At
      followup at a median age of 8 years the CIC group (n = 14, 3 transplanted boys
      excluded) had an increase in median differential GFR (difference between followup
      and initial GFR) of 7% (p <0.01), which was similar increase to that of the
      nonCIC group. In the 2 boys who stopped performing CIC renal function
      deteriorated with a median differential GFR of -24%. In the CIC group detrusor
      instability decreased. Poor compliance was seen in 6 of the 19 boys initially and
      only one remained poorly compliant. In 1 of the boys who stopped performing
      catheterization a low compliant bladder developed. In all of the other cases
      bladder capacity increased more than expected for age. CONCLUSIONS: The results
      suggest that treatment of bladder dysfunction in boys with PUV can counteract the
      deterioration in renal function seen during childhood but the number of patients 
      in our study is limited.

TI  - Update on overactive bladder: pharmacologic approaches on the horizon.
PG  - 385-90
AB  - Limitations exist with regard to the array of available agents for the
      pharmacologic therapy of overactive bladder, including issues of efficacy and
      tolerability. It is clear that the ideal agent for this condition has not been
      identified. However, several new pharmacologic treatments, including some with
      novel approaches to drug delivery, have emerged in clinical development over the 
      past few years. These agents include a variety of anticholinergics and others. In
      initial studies, some of the agents appear to compare favorably with existing
      therapies. Whether these promising results will hold up when subjected to
      large-scale, well-controlled clinical trials is unclear.

TI  - Oxybutynin for diagnosis of infravesical obstruction in boys with urinary
      incontinence.
PG  - 127-30; discussion 130-1
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether good suppression of symptoms during
      anticholinergic therapy in boys with urinary urge incontinence is correlated with
      anatomic infravesical obstruction. METHODS: In a prospective study, 65 boys with 
      urge incontinence were treated temporarily with anticholinergics. The effect of
      therapy was assessed, and a full video-urodynamic evaluation was performed. When 
      obstruction could not be excluded urodynamically, urethrocystoscopy was done to
      assess the level and severity of obstruction, followed by endoscopic treatment.
      The effect of oxybutynin on incontinence was compared with the presence or
      absence of obstruction. RESULTS: In 49 of 65 boys aged 4 to 14 years with daytime
      urge incontinence, infravesical obstruction was found. Of the 49 boys, 38 (76%)
      had a good response to anticholinergic therapy. Of the 16 boys without
      infravesical obstruction, 12 (75%) did not improve with anticholinergic therapy. 
      When anticholinergic therapy was used as a diagnostic test for infravesical
      obstruction, we found a positive predictive value and negative predictive value
      of 90% (95% confidence interval 74% to 96%) and 52% (95% confidence interval 31% 
      to 73%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of anticholinergic therapy on urge
      incontinence can be used as a diagnostic test to differentiate between anatomic
      infravesical obstruction and other causes of incontinence in boys.

TI  - Treatment of daytime urinary incontinence in children: a systematic review of
      randomized controlled trials.
PG  - 196-200; discussion 200
AB  - PURPOSE: We sought to determine the benefits and harms of interventions for
      children with daytime urinary incontinence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Trials of any 
      interventions for children with primary daytime incontinence (the urge syndrome
      and/or dysfunctional voiding) were identified from the Cochrane Controlled Trials
      Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, reference lists of articles, abstracts from conference
      proceedings and contact with known experts in the field. Once identified, trial
      quality was assessed, data were extracted and results were expressed in terms of 
      relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for individual trials, and
      summary estimates were obtained using a random effects model. All steps were done
      by 2 independent reviewers. RESULTS: Randomized trials of terodiline (2 studies),
      daytime alarms (1), imipramine (1) and biofeedback/oxybutynin (1) involving 383
      children were reviewed. No intervention was demonstrated to be effective. In the 
      latter trial, which was the only one to evaluate a currently used intervention,
      after 9 months of treatment there was no difference in the proportions of
      children with unimproved daytime wetting with oxybutynin (RR 0.74, CI 0.26 to
      2.13) and biofeedback (0.92, 0.59 to 1.43) compared with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: No
      intervention tested in a trial to date has been proved to be of benefit to
      children with daytime urinary incontinence.

TI  - Posterior urethral injuries and the Mitrofanoff principle in children.
PG  - 402-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report our experience of children with trauma causing posterior
      urethral injury who at some stage underwent a Mitrofanoff intervention, as
      post-traumatic urethral injuries can demand long-term treatment which (regardless
      of the surgical intervention) requires a period of dilatation of the
      reconstructed urethra. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1992 to 2001, 14 patients with 
      urethral injuries underwent a Mitrofanoff procedure. Thirteen had been run over
      by a motor vehicle and had severe hip injuries, and one had a direct
      non-penetrating perineal impact lesion (13 boys and one girl, aged 2-13 years at 
      the time of the accident). In all cases the Mitrofanoff procedure involved
      interposing the appendix between the bladder and the umbilicus. Only one of the
      children (because of extremely high bladder filling pressures) also underwent an 
      augmentation cystoplasty and closure of the bladder neck because there were bony 
      fragments in the urethra. RESULTS: The Mitrofanoff technique was considered
      useful in most cases. All patients during a given period used the Mitrofanoff
      conduit to empty their bladder every 3 h; 10 of the 14 are currently voiding
      urethrally, with an adequate flow, and four are not, but emptying the bladder
      periodically via the appendicovesicostomy. The only girl in the group has a major
      hip deformity and is unlikely to undergo urethroplasty; two patients are
      expecting definitive treatment and the other, although having a patent urethra,
      has no urinary flow. He is currently 19 years old and has no erections.
      CONCLUSIONS: The treatment of posterior urethral injuries represents a challenge 
      to surgical teams. Although primary suturing of the separated urethral ends is
      accepted as the best treatment, the construction of a temporary continent urinary

TI  - The use of tolterodine in children after oxybutynin failure.
PG  - 398-401
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and efficacy of tolterodine tartrate prescribed
      to children who previously failed to tolerate oxybutynin chloride. PATIENTS AND
      METHODS: We reviewed 34 children, followed for>1 year, who were prospectively
      crossed-over from oxybutynin to tolterodine because of side-effects. The initial 
      diagnosis was dysfunctional voiding in 31 patients. All patients were placed on a
      behavioural modification protocol. When their symptoms did not improve after 6
      months, treatment with an anticholinergic agent was considered. Urodynamic
      studies were conducted in 20 patients, confirming uninhibited contractions in 19.
      The remaining 14 patients were empirically started on antimuscarinic or
      anticholinergic agents. The 34 patients were treated with oxybutynin for a median
      (range) of 6 (2-84) months. When significant side-effects were reported, they
      were crossed over to tolterodine. The efficacy of tolterodine was assessed as
      defined by the International Children's Continence Society, with tolerability
      assessed and side-effects documented using a questionnaire. RESULTS: The mean age
      at the first dose of tolterodine was 8.9 years; the dose was 1 mg twice daily for
      12 patients and 2 mg twice daily for 22. The median treatment with tolterodine
      was 11.5 months, with 20 (59%) patients reporting no side-effects; six described 
      the same but tolerable side-effects as with oxybutynin. Eight patients
      discontinued tolterodine because of side-effects after a median (range) of 5
      (1-11) months. The efficacy of tolterodine was comparable with that of
      oxybutynin, as reported by the questionnaire and voiding diaries. The reduction
      in wetting episodes at 1 year was> 90% in 23 (68%), more than half in five and
      less than half (or failure) in six patients. CONCLUSION: Tolterodine is tolerated
      well in children. In this subgroup of patients who could not tolerate oxybutynin,
      77% were able to continue tolterodine treatment with no significant side-effects.

TI  - Therapeutic efficacy of extended release oxybutynin chloride, and immediate
      release and long acting tolterodine tartrate in children with diurnal urinary
      incontinence.
PG  - 317-9
AB  - PURPOSE: We compare the tolerability and efficacy of extended release oxybutynin 
      chloride, and immediate release and long acting tolterodine tartrate in children 
      with nonneurogenic diurnal urinary incontinence and symptoms of overactive
      bladder. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Children with a history of diurnal urinary
      incontinence were arbitrarily assigned to extended release oxybutynin, immediate 
      release tolterodine or long acting tolterodine. The dose was titrated until
      effective (onset of complete diurnal urinary continence), maximal recommended
      dosage was achieved or bothersome anticholinergic side effects developed. An
      independent observer recorded the dose used, anticholinergic side effects and
      efficacy of therapy (incidence of urinary frequency, urgency, posturing and
      urinary incontinence). RESULTS: The study included 86 girls and 46 boys. There
      were no statistically significant differences among the 3 treatment groups
      regarding the presence of peripheral or central nervous system anticholinergic
      side effects. Extended release oxybutynin and long acting tolterodine were
      significantly more effective at reducing daytime urinary incontinence than
      immediate release tolterodine (p <0.01 and 0 <0.05, respectively). Extended
      release oxybutynin was significantly more effective then long acting tolterodine 
      for complete resolution of diurnal incontinence (p <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Extended 
      release oxybutynin and long acting tolterodine are more effective than immediate 
      release tolterodine in decreasing diurnal urinary incontinence. Extended release 
      oxybutynin chloride is more effective than either immediate or long acting
      tolterodine for control of daytime urinary incontinence and urinary frequency.

      symptomatology.
PG  - 91-5
AB  - A drug utilization observation study collected data on a total of 1800 patients
      given flavoxate (Spasuret 200) over 2 weeks for urge incontinence. Efficacy and
      tolerance parameters were determined. A subgroup of 618 patients without urinary 
      tract infections or benign prostatic hyperplasia were treated with flavoxate
      only. The subgroup (n = 618) showed a reduction of dysuria (37%), nocturia (53%),
      and both daytime (61%) and nighttime urge (69%). Bladder volume at first urge
      sensation increased by 55.1+/-58.8 ml (36%), which was comparable to data from
      the entire group (1800 patients). In 89.2% of all patients the residual urine
      volume was stable or decreased. Undesirable side effects occurred in 1.8% of
      cases. Both groups showed better results with flavoxate four times daily (800
      mg), compared to three times daily (600 mg). Flavoxate is effective and well
      tolerated and causes no additional problems due to residual urine or side
      effects.

TI  - Column switching in capillary liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for 
      the quantitation of pg/ml concentrations of the free basic drug tolterodine and
      its active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite in microliter volumes of plasma.
PG  - 209-18
AB  - A capillary column switching system was developed for the determination of low,
      unbound concentrations of the basic drug tolterodine and its active
      5-hydroxymethyl (5-HM) metabolite in human plasma. Free concentrations of
      tolterodine and 5-HM at pM and nM (pg/ml and ng/ml) levels were obtained by
      ultrafiltration of 40-400 microliters plasma at 37 degrees C. The free fraction
      (%) was independent of the plasma concentrations of the analytes. Detection of
      the analytes was performed by sheathless electrospray tandem mass spectrometry in
      the multiple-reaction monitoring mode. The selectivity of the mass spectrometric 
      detection and the additional clean-up on the pre-column allowed direct injection 
      of the ultrafiltrated plasma samples. Tolterodine and 5-HM were pre-concentrated 
      on a reversed-phase capillary pre-column (1 cm x 200 microns) and subsequently
      backflushed onto the separation column (25 cm x 200 microns). The stability of
      the chromatographic system was good; a large number of ultrafiltrated plasma
      samples could be injected and the relative standard deviation of the retention
      times was typically < or = 1% (within-day). The accuracy was between 86 and 105% 
      and the precision was between 1 and 7% without the use of an internal standard.
      Linear calibration curves were obtained between 100 pM and 100 nM.

TI  - Behavioral vs drug treatment for urge urinary incontinence in older women: a
      randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 1995-2000
AB  - CONTEXT: Urinary incontinence is a common condition caused by many factors with
      several treatment options. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of
      biofeedback-assisted behavioral treatment with drug treatment and a placebo
      control condition for the treatment of urge and mixed urinary incontinence in
      older community-dwelling women. DESIGN: Randomized placebo-controlled trial
      conducted from 1989 to 1995. SETTING: University-based outpatient geriatric
      medicine clinic. PATIENTS: A volunteer sample of 197 women aged 55 to 92 years
      with urge urinary incontinence or mixed incontinence with urge as the predominant
      pattern. Subjects had to have urodynamic evidence of bladder dysfunction, be
      ambulatory, and not have dementia. INTERVENTION: Subjects were randomized to 4
      sessions (8 weeks) of biofeedback-assisted behavioral treatment, drug treatment
      (with oxybutynin chloride, possible range of doses, 2.5 mg daily to 5.0 mg 3
      times daily), or a placebo control condition. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Reduction in
      the frequency of incontinent episodes as determined by bladder diaries, and
      patients' perceptions of improvement and their comfort and satisfaction with
      treatment. RESULTS: For all 3 treatment groups, reduction of incontinence was
      most pronounced early in treatment and progressed more gradually thereafter.
      Behavioral treatment, which yielded a mean 80.7% reduction of incontinence
      episodes, was significantly more effective than drug treatment (mean 68.5%
      reduction; P=.04) and both were more effective than the placebo control condition
      (mean 39.4% reduction; P<.001 and P=.009, respectively). Patient-perceived
      improvement was greatest for behavioral treatment (74.1% "much better" vs 50.9%
      and 26.9% for drug treatment and placebo, respectively). Only 14.0% of patients
      receiving behavioral treatment wanted to change to another treatment vs 75.5% in 
      each of the other groups. CONCLUSION: Behavioral treatment is a safe and
      effective conservative intervention that should be made more readily available to
      patients as a first-line treatment for urge and mixed incontinence.

TI  - Effects of two anticholinergic drugs, trospium chloride and biperiden, on
      motility and evoked potentials of the oesophagus.
PG  - 979-84
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anticholinergic drugs are known to impair the motor function of the
      oesophagus but their effects on the oesophageal afferent pathways are unknown.
      AIM: To determine the effects of a peripherally-acting (trospium chloride) and a 
      centrally-acting (biperiden) anticholinergic drug on the motility and the evoked 
      potentials of the oesophagus. METHODS: Nine healthy volunteers were randomized to
      receive 1.2 mg trospium chloride (TC), 5 mg biperiden (BIP) or saline i.v.
      Primary peristalsis was elicited by swallowing a 5 mL water bolus and secondary
      peristalsis by insufflation of 20 mL air, 10 times each. Oesophageal potentials
      were evoked by electrical stimulation in the distal and proximal oesophagus (30
      stimulations at 0.4 Hz, two runs). RESULTS: Both anticholinergic drugs reduced by
      a similiar amount the contraction amplitudes (TC 17 mmHg, BIP 25 mmHg, saline 67 
      mmHg; P < 0.01) and the rate of secondary contractions (TC 60%, BIP 70%, saline
      95%; P < 0.01). In contrast, only biperiden prolonged the latencies of the evoked
      potentials (N1 peak, distal oesophagus: BIP 191 ms, TC 102 ms, saline 101 ms; P <
      0.01; P1 peak: BIP 322 ms, TC 161 ms, saline 144 ms; P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Both
      anticholinergic drugs depress oesophageal motility, but only the centrally-acting
      anticholinergic drug biperiden modifies the oesophageal evoked potentials,
      suggesting a central cholinergic transmission of the oesophageal afferent
      pathways.

TI  - P300 delay and attenuation in schizophrenia: reversal by neuroleptic medication.
PG  - 466-74
AB  - BACKGROUND: P300 amplitude reduction in schizophrenia has been found by many
      investigators, but P300 latency generally has been reported to be normal;
      however, conflicting findings are present in the literature, and interpretation
      has been confounded by medication effects and methodological differences.
      METHODS: This study used a standard auditory oddball paradigm to compare the
      latency, amplitude, and topographic distribution of P300s in neuroleptic-free
      schizophrenic patients with those of healthy controls. The patients then were
      treated for 6 weeks with either remoxipride or haloperidol, and their P300s were 
      reassessed. RESULTS: P300s were attenuated and delayed among neuroleptic-free
      patients. There was no evidence of peak lateralization or amplitude asymmetry
      over temporal areas. Subsequent neuroleptic medication normalized P300 latencies 
      and increased P300 amplitudes, but the latter remained below normal limits over
      all except frontal areas. There were no correlations between P300 latency or
      amplitude and clinical symptomatology either before or after treatment.
      CONCLUSIONS: The finding of a P300 delay in neuroleptic-free schizophrenics that 
      is normalized by neuroleptic medication has not been reported previously.
      Neuroleptic effects on P300 amplitude and latency appear to be independent of
      effects on clinical symptoms, and cannot be attributed to anticholinergic
      activity.

AB  - Seizures occurred in two patients with probable Alzheimer's disease who were
      receiving long-term treatment with metrifonate, an irreversible
      acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. In both patients seizures were associated with
      discontinuation of short-term agents with high antimuscarinic properties. Hence, 
      abrupt discontinuation of antimuscarinics or anticholinergics with high
      antimuscarinic properties in patients receiving long-term acetylcholinesterase
      inhibition therapy may be associated with a reduction of seizure threshold. With 
      increasing administration of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for patients with
      Alzheimer's disease, practitioners should be aware of the potential for drug-drug
      interactions and other complications. In general, it is good medical practice to 
      avoid concomitant administration with centrally acting anticholinergic agents.

AB  - The spasmolytic activity of flavoxate (CAS 15301-69-6), anticholinergic agents
      oxybutynin (CAS 5633-20-5), and trospium chloride (CAS 10405-02-4), drugs
      commonly utilized in the therapy of hyperactive bladder, and phosphodiesterase
      (PDE) inhibitors papaverine (CAS 58-74-2) and vinpocetine (CAS 42971-09-5) on
      muscarinic contractions of detrusor smooth muscle strips isolated from human and 
      porcine urinary bladder was studied in vitro using the organ bath technique.
      Trospium chloride was most effective in relaxing contractions elicited by
      muscarinic stimulation, while flavoxate was significantly less effective than all
      other drugs tested. The relaxing potency of oxybutynin was greater than those of 
      PDE-inhibitors papaverine and vinpocetine but 3,000 fold less significant than
      those of trospium chloride. The effects of the individual drugs on muscarinic
      tension of both human and porcine detrusor muscle strips were nearly equal. The
      present results suggest that the pig might be an appropriate animal model for the
      study of effects of spasmolytic substances on the contractility of urinary
      bladder smooth muscle in vitro.

TI  - Follow-up of long-time treatment with intravesical oxybutynin for neurogenic
      bladder in children.
PG  - 148-53
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Anticholinergic treatment for the hyperreflexic neurogenic bladder in 
      childhood is an established method, together with clean intermittent
      catheterization (CIC), to promote continence and protect the upper urinary tract 
      from deterioration. Recently, the use of oxybutynin, a compound with
      anticholinergic, smooth muscle relaxant and local anesthetic effects, has become 
      widely used with both oral and intravesical administration. METHOD: In this study
      we report 39 children with myelodysplasia, neurogenic bladder disturbance with
      detrusor hyperreflexia and/or high bladder pressure treated with CIC to which
      intravesical oxybutynin 0.1 mg/kg twice daily was added and administered as a
      sterile pharmacy-produced solution. The follow-up period was 0.66-5 years (mean
      2.25). RESULTS: Continence was clearly promoted and urodynamic parameters
      improved whereas an increased occurrence of asymptomatic bacteriuria and lower
      urinary tract infections was noted. Compliance was good, adverse reactions rare, 
      and in some cases vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) resolved. Also infants and very
      young children were treated without complications. CONCLUSIONS: Intravesical
      oxybutynin is effective to diminish bladder pathophysiology and promote
      continence in this patient group and is also well tolerated. Attention should be 
      paid to the occurrence of urinary tract infections and VUR may resolve.

TI  - Comparison of the in vitro and in vivo profiles of tolterodine with those of
      subtype-selective muscarinic receptor antagonists.
PG  - 285-92
AB  - Tolterodine [(R)-N,N-diisopropyl-3-(2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl)-3-phenylpropanamine
      ] is a new potent and competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist developed for
      the treatment of urinary urge incontinence and other symptoms of overactive
      bladder. In vivo, tolterodine exhibits functional selectivity for the urinary
      bladder over salivary glands, a profile that cannot be explained in terms of
      selectivity for a single muscarinic receptor subtype. The aim of this study was
      to compare the in vitro and in vivo antimuscarinic profiles of tolterodine with
      those of muscarinic receptor antagonists with distinct receptor
      subtype-selectivity profiles: darifenacin
      [(S)-2-[1-[2-(2,3-dihydrobenzofuran-5-yl)ethyl]-3-pyrrolidinyl]-2,2-d
      iphenylacetamide; selective for muscarinic M3 receptors]; UH-AH 37
      (6-chloro-5,10-dihydro-5-[(1-methyl-4-piperidinyl)acetyl]-11H-dibenzo-[b
      ,e][1,4]diazepine-11-one; low affinity for muscarinic M2 receptors); and AQ-RA
      741 (11-([4-[4-(diethylamino)butyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl)-5,11-dihydro-6H-py
      rido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one; high affinity for muscarinic M2 receptors).
      The in vitro profiles of these compounds were in agreement with previous reports;
      darifenacin and UH-AH 37 demonstrated selectivity for muscarinic M3/m3 over M2/m2
      receptors, while the converse was observed for AQ-RA 741. In vivo, AQ-RA 741 was 
      more potent (1.4-2.7-fold) in inhibiting urinary bladder contraction than
      salivation in the anaesthetised cat (i.e., a profile similar to that of
      tolterodine [2.5-3.3-fold]), while darifenacin and UH-AH 37 showed the reverse
      selectivity profile (0.6-0.8 and 0.4-0.5-fold, respectively). The results confirm
      that it is possible to separate the antimuscarinic effects on urinary bladder and
      salivary glands in vivo. The data on UH-AH 37 and darifenacin support the view
      that a selectivity for muscarinic M3/m3 over M2/m2 receptors may result in a more
      pronounced effect on salivation than on bladder contraction. The data on AQ-RA
      741 may indicate that muscarinic M2/m2 receptors may have a role in bladder
      contraction.

PG  - 354-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the best treatment for children with recurrent infection 
      of the lower urinary tract and without anatomical abnormalities. METHODS: A
      clinical study was conducted on 150 children (30 boys and 120 girls), aged 4 to
      36 months (mean 16), with recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI) and no
      radiological evidence of anatomical abnormalities. They were divided into three
      groups: group I was treated with a single nightly prophylactic dose of an
      antibiotic; group II received a single nightly dose of oxybutinin, or divided in 
      2-4 doses; group III received a single nightly prophylactic dose of an antibiotic
      and oxybutinin as in group II. RESULTS: There were more episodes of UTI in group 
      I (44/50), more hospitalizations and problems of malnutrition, and a longer
      period of treatment was required. In group II, 14/50 children had episodes of
      UTI, their nutritional status improved and there were less hospitalizations. In
      group III, 3/50 children had episodes of UTI; they were the best responders and
      required a shorter duration of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic therapy
      requires a longer period of treatment. The use of oxybutinin is an alternative
      modality in the treatment of these children. Combination therapy with a single
      nightly dose of an antibiotic and anticholinergic (oxybutinin) appears to be the 
      best therapeutic modality for children with recurrent UTI and no anatomical
      abnormality.

      relaxation of the bladder detrusor muscle. A placebo controlled, randomized
      clinical test].
PG  - 486-91
AB  - Therapy of detrusor hyperactivity with anticholinergic agents often is followed
      by adverse drug reactions. Intravesical application may be an interesting
      alternative. A randomised, single-blind, placebo-controlled, mono-centre clinical
      trial was carried out in 84 patients with urgency or urge incontinence. Due to
      intravesical administration of oxybutynin (CAS 5633-20-5) (n = 21) and trospium
      chloride (CAS 10405-02-4) (n = 21), respectively, a significant increase in
      maximum bladder capacity and decrease of detrusor pressure accompanied by an
      increase of residual urine were found in comparison to placebo in urodynamical
      investigations. Improvement of uninhibited bladder contractions occurred leading 
      to higher filling volume. Under verapamil (CAS 152-11-4) (n = 21) no marked
      changes in the efficacy variables were found compared with placebo. All patients 
      completed the study and were assessed with regard to efficacy and safety. No
      adverse events or marked changes in the vital signs were reported. The immediate 
      onset of effect and the lack of adverse drug reactions suggest that treatment
      with topical oxybutynin or trospium chloride is an effective alternative in
      patients with intolerable side effects when orally treated. In addition,
      intravesical administration may be indicated in patients with bladder spasms due 
      to indwelling catheter or in order to increase bladder capacity before
      percutaneous cystostomy.

TI  - Pharmacologic actions of temiverine (p-INN) and its active metabolite, RCC-36, on
      isolated human urinary bladder muscle.
PG  - 268-75
AB  - BACKGROUND: Temiverine (p-INN) is a newly synthesized drug that is expected to
      have anticholinergic action. We investigated the pharmacologic actions of
      temiverine and its active metabolite, RCC-36, on isolated human bladder. METHODS:
      Effects of temiverine and RCC-36 on the detrusor contractions induced by
      acetylcholine, potassium chloride (KCl), calcium chloride (CaCl2), and electric
      field stimulation were evaluated using the muscle-bath technique, and compared
      with the effects of atropine and oxybutynin. RESULTS: Atropine (10(-9) to 10(-6) 
      mol/L), oxybutynin (10(-8) to 10(-5) mol/L), temiverine (10(-8) to 10(-5) mol/L),
      and RCC-36 (10(-8) to 3 x 10(-6) mol/L) caused a parallel shift to the right of
      the concentration-response curves to acetylcholine stimulation. The rank order of
      pA2 value was atropine > oxybutynin = RCC-36 > temiverine. Atropine did not
      suppress the maximum contractile response to acetylcholine, but the other drugs
      significantly suppressed this at the higher concentrations. Each drug caused a
      concentration-dependent inhibition of KCl (80 mmol/L)-, and CaCl2 (5
      mmol/L)-induced contractile responses. Rank order of maximum inhibition was
      RCC-36 = temiverine > oxybutynin > atropine. Each drug caused a
      concentration-dependent inhibition of electric field-induced contraction with or 
      without 10(-6) mol/L atropine pretreatment. Maximum inhibitions of temiverine and
      RCC-36 were significantly greater than that of oxybutynin. CONCLUSION: Atropine, 
      oxybutynin, temiverine, and RCC-36 have different efficacies and potencies of
      anticholinergic and calcium antagonistic activity on isolated human detrusor
      muscles. Furthermore, temiverine and RCC-36 have significant inhibitory actions
      toward the atropine-resistant part of contractions, which may be related to the
      calcium antagonistic actions of these compounds.

TI  - Tolterodine.
PG  - 813-20; discussion 821-2
AB  - Tolterodine is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist which has recently
      been launched for the treatment of overactive bladder. Tolterodine shows
      functional selectivity for the bladder over the salivary glands in vivo, which is
      not attributable to muscarinic receptor subtype selectivity. It is as potent as
      oxybutynin in inhibiting bladder contraction, but is much less potent in
      inhibiting salivation, suggesting that it may have less propensity to cause dry
      mouth in clinical use. In patients with overactive bladder, toleterodine
      significantly reduces the frequency of micturition and number of incontinence
      episodes, while increasing the average volume voided. The onset of
      pharmacological action of tolterodine is < 1 hour and therapeutic efficacy is
      maintained during long term treatment. In comparative trials, tolterodine and
      oxybutynin are equivalent in terms of efficacy. However, tolterodine is
      significantly better tolerated than oxybutynin, particularly with respect to the 
      incidence and severity of dry mouth. No clinically relevant ECG changes have been
      noted with tolterodine.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To clarify the effects of systematic treatment based on overnight
      simultaneous monitoring by electroencephalography (EEG) and cystometry (CM) on
      each type of enuresis. METHODS: For enuresis type I, the change in the awakening 
      response during the conditioning treatment with a therapeutic machine was
      observed. For enuresis type IIa, the effect of imipramine on the EEG was
      observed. For enuresis type IIb, the effect of oxybutynin hydrochloride on the
      cystometrogram (CMG) was observed. RESULTS: Values, in which the awakening score 
      on the second night was subtracted from the score on the last night, were
      significantly higher in the effective cases than in the unchanged cases. Out of
      the 3 patients in whom imipramine was effective, an awakening response on the EEG
      was observed in 2. Neither of the 2 unchanged cases showed an awakening response.
      Out of 4 patients in whom oxybutynin hydrochloride was effective, uninhibited
      contractions (UIC) on the CMG disappeared in 3. UIC stopped in neither of the 2
      unchanged cases. CONCLUSIONS: Improvement of the awakening response plays an
      important role in the effectiveness of conditioning treatment with our
      therapeutic machine. The generation of awakening response is thought to be the
      most important result of imipramine directly concerned with its clinical effect
      on enuresis type IIa. The main result with oxybutynin hydrochloride in enuresis
      type IIb is thought to be related to its antispasmodic effect.

PG  - 124-30
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To know the incidence of adverse reactions from Oxybutynin Chloride,
      with special reference to salivary hyposecretion and to evaluate the
      effectiveness of the different alternatives employed to solve it. MATERIAL AND
      METHOD: 144 adult patients with signs and symptoms of voiding urgency and
      detrusor-hyperactivity incontinence, who were treated with Oxybutynin 5 to 15
      mg/day. Hyposecretion of several exocrine glands was evaluated using a
      questionnaire that included subjective and objective parameters. For managing
      purposes, patients were divided into 3 groups: 1) General measures; 2) Therapy
      with sialagogues; and 3) Replacement therapy with artificial saliva. RESULTS: 42%
      patients treated with Oxybutynin developed mild-to-moderate hyposialism. 26% had 
      severe hyposialism, always related to high dose Oxybutynin. 6% skin dryness, 3%
      eye dryness and 2% dryness in all the above glands (dry syndrome). Regarding
      treatment, most patients with mild-to-moderate hyposialism were managed with
      simple general measures. In severe hyposialism, both sialagogues (Eledoisine) and
      artificial saliva (Bucalsone) were resolutive in over 90% cases. CONCLUSIONS:
      Oxybutynin is an effective drug to stop detrusor hyperactivity, but it has a high
      rate of anticholinergic adverse reactions. There is a number of effective
      therapeutic options available to alleviate these effects, which allow the patient
      to continue with the treatment.

TI  - Economic costs of urinary incontinence in 1995.
PG  - 355-61
AB  - Urinary incontinence imposes a significant financial burden on individuals, their
      families, and healthcare organizations. For individuals 65 years of age and older
      these costs are substantial, increasing from $8.2 billion (1984 dollars) to $16.4
      billion (1993 dollars). Both of these cost-of-illness estimates, however, relied 
      on data and factors that have changed over time. This study updates these cost
      estimates. The 1995 societal cost of incontinence for individuals aged 65 years
      and older was $26.3 billion, or $3565 per individual with urinary incontinence.
      Limitations, implications, and directions for future research are also discussed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the urodynamic (UD),
      radiological (VCUG) and clinical outcome in patients with detrusor instability
      (DI) and vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR). PATIENTS AND METHODS: UD and VCUG findings
      in 24 patients between 4 and 18 years of age (mean 7.6 years) with a simultaneous
      diagnosis of VUR and DI were reviewed. All presented with recurrent urinary tract
      infections (UTI). Twenty were female of whom 8 also had enuresis and daytime
      symptoms. Ten had bilateral VUR, making a total of 34 units. Mean follow-up was
      40 months (range 18-97 months) and at least 2 UD studies were done. Treatment
      consisted of oxybutinin chloride (OC) and chemoprophylaxis. RESULTS: Treatment
      lasted an average of 31 months with an average dose of 11 mg/day. There was a
      statistically significant improvement in UTI rate, enuresis score and UD
      parameters [CysCap, volume at 1st contraction, maximum contraction and compliance
      (comp)]. Thirteen patients achieved stable bladders and 9 had some UD improvement
      (3 with low compliance and 2 with less severe DI), leaving 2 with unchanged DI.
      Reflux disappeared in 20 units and was downgraded in 6. VUR improvement coincided
      with the cases of UD improvement. Persistence of DI was always associated with
      persistent VUR. CONCLUSIONS: Oxybutinin treatment can be long, but UD and VUR
      improvement run parallel in most cases. The rare discrepant cases point towards a
      multifactorial ethology in this condition.

TI  - Pharmacologic options for the overactive bladder.
PG  - 43-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To review the current pharmacologic options for treatment of the
      overactive bladder and to describe potential therapies on the horizon. METHODS:
      The literature on the clinical efficacy and safety of the currently available
      agents is described. RESULTS: According to the guidelines issued by the Agency
      for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR), anticholinergic agents should be the
      first-line pharmacologic therapy for patients with detrusor instability.
      Oxybutynin is the anticholinergic of choice for this indication, whereas
      propantheline is the second-line therapy. Although calcium antagonists have been 
      investigated, the one such drug introduced for the treatment of overactive
      bladder (terodiline) was withdrawn from the market because of a risk of cardiac
      arrhythmia. Studies of potassium channel openers have found either a lack of
      clinical efficacy or an unacceptable level of side effects. Alpha-adrenergic
      antagonists may be useful for decreasing bladder overactivity in patients who
      have autonomous bladders as the result of conditions such as spinal cord injury. 
      Tricyclic antidepressants (particularly imipramine) may be effective in
      decreasing bladder contractility, although the AHCPR guidelines caution that
      these drugs should be reserved for use in carefully evaluated patients. Future
      developments in the treatment of detrusor overactivity are likely to occur in 3
      categories: drugs that affect peripheral excitatory mechanisms, drugs that
      inhibit afferent mechanisms, and drugs that affect more central actions at either
      the ganglionic, spinal cord, or supraspinal level. CONCLUSIONS: Although
      pharmacologic management of the overactive bladder has progressed little in the
      past 10 years, the future may hold the promise of more effective therapies.

TI  - [An update on clinical and therapeutic aspects of nocturnal enuresis].
PG  - 385-90
AB  - Justification of early treatment of nocturnal enuresis is founded in the negative
      psychological impact on the child. In fact nocturnal enuresis delays early
      autonomy and socialisation by decreasing in self-esteem and self-confidence.
      Nocturnal enuresis classification is the preliminary step to correct therapy.
      Enuresis must be classified as primary (never acquired nocturnal control) or
      secondary (at least 6 months of dry nights). A child is also classified as having
      monosymptomatic enuresis if she/he experienced only night wetting and symptomatic
      enuresis if she/he experienced night wetting associated with diurnal voiding
      symptoms (urinated > or = 7 times a day, urgency, damp pants, squatting, holding 
      the perineum, sitting on one heel). Monosymptomatic patients must be treated with
      desmopressin nasal spray at the daily dose of 20 micrograms at bed time. If the
      reduction of at least the 50% of the basal number of the wet nights is not
      achieved, the dosage must be increased until 40 micrograms. For patients affected
      by rhinitis or asthma, desmopressin is now available in tablets. In symptomatic
      patients desmopressin therapy must be associated to oxybutinin (5 mg x 2).
      Therapy interruption must be gradual with desmopressin reduction of 10 micrograms
      every 30 days. In symptomatic patients oxybutinin must be introduced only at bed 
      time. The efficacy of the drugs depends on the therapy length. The highest
      percentage of success is obtained if the treatment is protracted for at least six
      months. Antidepressants are also used for nocturnal enuresis especially
      imipramine. The dosage varies between 0.5-1.5 mg/ kg/daily. As plasmatic levels
      are achieved only in 30% of treated patients, a 3-5 fold increase in suggested.
      Nevertheless these levels result in near toxic threshold concentration. Sporadic 
      treatment purposes include amytriptiline, diclofenac sodicum, viloxsazine and
      methilphenidate if giggle incontinence is present. Non responders may be treated 
      with alarm. If after 16 weeks of treatment no success is obtained alarm use must 
      be interrupted.

TI  - Clinical efficacy and safety of tolterodine in the treatment of overactive
      bladder: a pooled analysis.
PG  - 90-6; discussion 97-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of tolterodine in
      four randomized, double-blind, parallel, multicenter, 12-week studies of patients
      with overactive bladder. METHODS: Two of the four studies compared tolterodine (2
      mg twice daily) to oxybutynin (5 mg three times daily) and placebo, one study
      compared tolterodine (2 mg twice daily) to oxybutynin (5 mg three times daily),
      and one study compared two dosages of tolterodine (1 and 2 mg twice daily) to
      placebo. Efficacy was determined from micturition diaries and patient perception 
      of their bladder condition. Safety and tolerability were assessed from adverse
      events and laboratory measures. RESULTS: A total of 1,120 patients were
      randomized and treated at 134 centers. For the primary efficacy variable, the
      number of micturitions/24 hours, pooled results showed a significant decrease
      from baseline for the 1 mg tolterodine (P < 0.001), 2 mg tolterodine (P < 0.001),
      and 5 mg oxybutynin (P < 0.01) groups, compared to placebo. Both tolterodine
      doses and oxybutynin significantly decreased incontinence episodes/24 hours and
      significantly increased volume voided/micturition, compared to placebo.
      Tolterodine at a dose of 2 mg twice daily and 5 mg oxybutynin twice daily were
      significantly more effective in improving patient perception of bladder condition
      than placebo. Tolterodine at a dose of 2 mg and 5 mg oxybutynin were equivalent
      in their effectiveness. Tolterodine at doses of 1 mg and 2 mg were tolerated
      significantly better than oxybutynin when adverse events, dry mouth (both
      frequency and intensity), dose reductions, and patient withdrawals were
      considered. CONCLUSIONS: Although oxybutynin is highly effective, its clinical
      utility is limited by systemic side effects that lead to frequent discontinuation
      of treatment or dose reductions. Patients receiving tolterodine should not
      experience these limitations and instead will get safe and long-term effective
      treatment for their condition.

TI  - Serum tryptase levels in adverse drug reactions.
PG  - 1102-5
AB  - We evaluated the usefulness of individual tryptase levels and variations after
      adverse drug reactions in 64 patients. Our aim was to find a tool for the
      diagnosis of drug allergy. Thirty-seven subjects were confirmed to have drug
      allergy, 12 had nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) reactions, five had
      negative controlled drug challenges (NAAR), and 10 had symptoms after placebo
      intake (PLA). Serum tryptase levels greatly increased after anaphylactic shocks
      (2242%) and anaphylaxis (710.5%). Patients with allergic urticaria and those with
      idiosyncratic responses to acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) exhibited a small increase 
      in serum tryptase (49.5% and 38.2%, respectively). In the other two groups (NAAR 
      and PLA), no variation in this serum protease was observed. The time of
      appearance of the serum tryptase peak differed considerably among patients with
      similar clinical reactions (from 30 min to 6 h) and was independent of the latent
      period, severity of symptoms, or the amount of tryptase released. We conclude
      that serum tryptase determinations are helpful in the diagnosis of anaphylactic
      shock and anaphylaxis, but serial measurements may be needed to confirm mast-cell
      participation in milder reactions.

TI  - The role of oxybutynin in spinal cord injured patients with indwelling catheters.
PG  - 2083-6
AB  - PURPOSE: The long-term benefits of oral oxybutynin in spinal cord injured
      patients with indwelling catheters is unknown. We reviewed our experience with
      this population of men and present the results of our analysis. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: A total of 109 male spinal cord injured patients at the Houston Veterans
      Affairs Medical Center have been treated with chronic indwelling catheters (80
      transurethral and 29 suprapubic). Thirty-eight patients (35%) were identified as 
      using oxybutynin on a regular basis. These patients were compared to those not
      using oxybutynin with regard to urodynamic parameters and upper tract
      deterioration. Specifically examined were bladder compliance, bladder leak point 
      pressure, vesicoureteral reflux, hydronephrosis, urolithiasis, febrile urinary
      tract infections and serum creatinine greater than 2 mg./dl. RESULTS: The mean
      duration of indwelling catheter use was 11.9 years (12.4 without oxybutynin and
      10.9 on oral oxybutynin). Of the 31 patients with normal compliance (greater than
      20 ml./cm. water), 24 (77%) were using oxybutynin (p = 0.001). Bladder leak point
      pressures were abnormal (greater than 35 cm. water) in 5 of 32 patients (16%) on 
      oxybutynin versus 34 of 60 (57%) without it (p <0.001). Hydronephrosis was
      present in 15 of 66 patients (23%) without oxybutynin versus 1 of 36 (3%) with
      oxybutynin (p = 0.009). Febrile urinary tract infections occurred in 4 of 35
      patients (11%) versus 17 of 62 patients (27%) with or without oxybutynin,
      respectively (p = 0.077). No significant differences were found between the 2
      groups with regard to reflux, renal scars, stones or elevated serum creatinine.
      CONCLUSIONS: It appears that regular use of oxybutynin may be beneficial in
      spinal cord injured patients who require chronic indwelling catheters for bladder
      management. Our analysis reveals that patients who take oxybutynin regularly have
      better bladder compliance, lower bladder leak point pressures and less
      hydronephrosis. Until a prospective, randomized trial reveals contradicting
      outcomes, empiric use of oxybutynin in all spinal cord injured patients requiring
      chronic indwelling catheters seems justified.

TI  - Explicit criteria for determining potentially inappropriate medication use by the
      elderly. An update.
PG  - 1531-6
AB  - This study updates and expands explicit criteria defining potentially
      inappropriate medication use by the elderly. Additional goals were to address
      whether adverse outcomes were likely to be clinically severe and to incorporate
      clinical information on diagnoses when available. These criteria are meant to
      serve epidemiological studies, drug utilization review systems, health care
      providers, and educational efforts. Consensus from a panel of 6 nationally
      recognized experts on the appropriate use of medication in the elderly was
      sought. The expert panel agreed on the validity of 28 criteria describing the
      potentially inappropriate use of medication by general populations of the elderly
      as well as 35 criteria defining potentially inappropriate medication use in older
      persons known to have any of 15 common medical conditions. Updated, expanded, and
      more generally applicable criteria are now available to help identify
      inappropriate use of medications in elderly populations. These criteria define
      medications that should generally be avoided in the ambulatory elderly, doses or 
      frequencies of administrations that should generally not be exceeded, and
      medications that should be avoided in older persons known to have any of several 
      common conditions.

TI  - [Medical treatment of bladder instability. Our experience].
PG  - 633-42
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the factors that influence response to treatment of
      vesical instability. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted to assess the
      efficacy of drug therapy with oxybutinin and imipramine in 89 patients with
      urodynamically demonstrated detrusor hyperreactivity. Control evaluations were
      performed at 2, 5 and 8 months. Evaluation of the results took into account the
      etiology, pressure and volume at which the wave of instability appeared. RESULTS:
      The results were evaluated according to patient subjective criteria. We observed 
      a positive response (cure and improvement) to treatment with oxybutinin alone or 
      oxybutinin+imipramine in 66.25% of the cases; side effects were observed in 44%. 
      There was a 20% improvement in the positive response rate when the wave intensity
      was greater than 55 cm H2O and the bladder volume at which this occurred was
      greater than 150 ml. No patient treated with second line drug therapy (flavoxate,
      nifedipine and trospium chloride) cured. CONCLUSIONS: The etiology of vesical
      instability did not influence response to therapy. Waves with a greater intensity
      and those that appeared at higher volumes responded better to treatment. Nearly
      half of the patients with side effects required a reduction of the dosage or
      withdrawal of the drug. Our results and those reported elsewhere indicate that
      non-responders to treatment with oxybutinin alone or in combination with
      imipramine are unlikely to improve with currently available drug therapy.

TI  - Electromotive administration of oxybutynin into the human bladder wall.
PG  - 228-33
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare concentrations of oxybutynin in the human bladder wall after 
      either passive delivery (PD) or electromotive administration (EMDA). MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: Tissue sections of human bladder were inserted into a diffusion cell
      with urothelium exposed to the donor compartment containing oxybutynin (4.5 mg.
      in 100 ml. NaCl 0.45%) and an anode. Twelve paired experiments, "current 5 mA/no 
      current", were conducted over 15 minutes. Oxybutynin tissue contents were
      measured and tissue viability, morphology and oxybutynin stability were assessed.
      RESULTS: Mean oxybutynin tissue concentrations were 3.84 micrograms./gm. in
      samples exposed to EMDA and 0.87 microgram./gm. in samples exposed to PD (p =
      0.0006). The mean coefficients of variation were 57.85% in EMDA experiments and
      89.78% in PD experiments. Tissues were viable and undamaged histologically and no
      oxybutynin structural modification was observed. CONCLUSIONS: EMDA enhances
      oxybutynin administration into viable bladder wall and reduces the variability in
      drug delivery rate.

TI  - Oxybutynin in the treatment of early detrusor instability after transurethral
      resection of the prostate.
PG  - 915-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the symptomatic and urodynamic effects of oxybutynin in
      the control of irritative micturitional symptoms during the first week after
      transurethral resection of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). PATIENTS AND
      METHODS: Fifty-three patients (median age 67 years, interquartile range 62-72)
      were included prospectively in a double-blind placebo-controlled study.
      Pre-operatively, uroflowmetry and cystometrography (CMG) were performed, and the 
      post-void residual volume (PVR) measured; symptoms were rated according to the
      Boyarski score. CMG was repeated on the first post-operative day and medication
      was started on the third day. Before withdrawing the catheter on the fifth day.
      CMG was repeated. Three days later, symptoms were evaluated according to the
      Boyarski score and uroflowmetry and the estimate of PVR reassessed. RESULTS: In
      comparison with placebo, oxybutynin significantly decreased frequency, urgency
      and detrusor pressure at first sensation of filling. However, oxybutynin did not 
      lower the rate of pre-operative detrusor instability and exerted no effect on the
      maximal capacity of the bladder and corresponding detrusor pressure. Dryness of
      mouth was reported in 13% and 65% of patients receiving placebo and oxybutynin,
      respectively. CONCLUSION: Oxybutynin alleviates early irritative symptoms after
      transurethral resection of BPH, without consistently modifying bladder
      urodynamics.

TI  - Tolterodine--a new bladder-selective antimuscarinic agent.
PG  - 195-207
AB  - Tolterodine is a new muscarinic receptor antagonist intended for the treatment of
      urinary urge incontinence and other symptoms related to an overactive bladder.
      The aim of the present study was to compare the antimuscarinic properties of
      tolterodine with those of oxybutynin, in vitro and in vivo. Tolterodine
      effectively inhibited carbachol-induced contractions of isolated strips of
      urinary bladder from guinea pigs (K(B) 3.0 nM; pA2 8.6; Schild slope 0.97) and
      humans (K(B) 4.0 nM; pA2 8.4; Schild slope 1.04) in a concentration-dependent,
      competitive manner. The affinity of tolterodine was similar to that derived for
      oxybutynin (K(B) 4.4 nM; pA2 8.5; Schild slope 0.89) in the guinea-pig bladder.
      Tolterodine (21-2103 nmol/kg (0.01-1 mg/kg); intravenous infusion) was
      significantly more potent in inhibiting acetylcholine-induced urinary bladder
      contraction than electrically-induced salivation in the anaesthetised cat. In
      contrast, oxybutynin displayed the opposite tissue selectivity. Radioligand
      binding data showed that tolterodine bound with high affinity to muscarinic
      receptors in urinary bladder (K(i) 2.7 nM), heart (K(i) 1.6 nM), cerebral cortex 
      (K(i) 0.75 nM) and parotid gland (K(i) 4.8 nM) from guinea pigs and in urinary
      bladder from humans (K(i) 3.3 nM). Tolterodine and oxybutynin were equipotent,
      except in the parotid gland, where oxybutynin bound with 8-times higher affinity 
      (K(i) 0.62 nM). Binding data on human muscarinic m1-m5 receptors expressed in
      Chinese hamster ovary cells showed that oxybutynin, in contrast to tolterodine,
      exhibits selectivity (10-fold) for muscarinic m3 over m2 receptors. The K(B)
      value determined for oxybutynin (4.4 nM) in functional studies on guinea-pig
      bladder correlated better with the binding affinity at muscarinic M2/m2 receptors
      (K(i) 2.8 and 6.7 nM) than at muscarinic M3/m3 receptors (K(i) 0.62 and 0.67 nM).
      The tissue selectivity demonstrated for tolterodine in vivo cannot be attributed 
      to selectivity for a single muscarinic receptor subtype. However, the combined in
      vitro and in vivo data on tolterodine and oxybutynin may indicate either that
      muscarinic M3/m3 receptors in glands are more sensitive to blockade than those in
      bladder smooth muscle, or that muscarinic M2/m2 receptors contribute to bladder
      contraction.

TI  - Comparison of oxybutynin and its active metabolite, N-desethyl-oxybutynin, in the
      human detrusor and parotid gland.
PG  - 1093-7
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare in vitro the antimuscarinic effect of oxybutynin and its
      active metabolite, N-desethyl-oxybutynin, on human detrusor, and their binding
      characteristics in detrusor and parotid gland. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Antimuscarinic effect in the detrusor was assessed as the ability of the drugs to
      inhibit carbachol-induced contractions and contractions induced by electrical
      nerve stimulation. In addition, the drugs' ability to displace 3H-QNB from
      muscarinic receptors was investigated. RESULTS: Both oxybutynin and
      N-desethyl-oxybutynin caused a rightward shift of the concentration-response
      curve for carbachol without depression of the maximum, indicating a competitive
      antagonism. The pA2 values were 7.8 for oxybutynin and 7.6 for
      N-desethyl-oxybutynin. Contractions induced by electrical nerve stimulation were 
      depressed by 87% by oxybutynin (10 microM) and by 91% by N-desethyl-oxybutynin
      (10 microM). In radioligand receptor binding studies on the detrusor, oxybutynin 
      and N-desethyl-oxybutynin had uniform displacement curves and the same pKi value,
      8.2. The affinity for N-desethyl-oxybutynin in the parotid gland was
      significantly higher, the pKi value being 8.7. The corresponding figure for
      oxybutynin was 8.5. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that oxybutynin and
      N-desethyl-oxybutynin have a similar antimuscarinic effect in the human detrusor,
      and the same binding characteristics in detrusor and parotid gland, respectively.

TI  - [Role of alfuzosin in the treatment of functional voiding disorders in women].
PG  - 43-5
AB  - Voiding dysfunction of the lower urinary tract represent a diagnostic and
      therapeutic challenge being the symptoms and urodynamic finding not strictly
      related. 34 women with urgency-frequency symptoms and post voiding residual urine
      were treated with alfuzosin 2.5 mg. twice daily alone or associated to
      oxibutinine 25 mg twice daily in patients with destrusor instability. After 30
      days from therapy 69% presented a post void residual urine less than 40 ml, while
      76% presented a flw max more than 15 ml/sec. At follow up 12 months the results
      remained unchanged. Alfuzosin alone or in association with oxibutinin can lower
      the urinary resistance to flow without modifying the maximum urethral pressure
      (MUP).

TI  - The role of ureter in the creation of Mitrofanoff channels in children.
PG  - 635-7
AB  - PURPOSE: Since 1980 numerous variations of the Mitrofanoff principle have been
      described. We report on 22 children in whom a ureteral Mitrofanoff channel was
      created. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1986 and 1995 a ureteral Mitrofanoff
      channel was constructed as a catheterizable conduit in 22 children 2 to 15 years 
      old (average age 6.5) with various abnormalities of the lower urinary tract,
      mainly exstrophy and neurogenic bladder. Indications included unavailability or
      unsuitability of the appendix, preference for appendix as a catheterizable
      colonic stoma for antegrade washouts or concomitant removal of a nonfunctioning
      kidney, leaving the ureter available for use. Surgical technique was based on the
      principles of appendicovesicostomy and in 9 cases the ureteral Mitrofanoff
      channel was reimplanted. RESULTS: Followup ranged from 1 to 72 months (average
      30.5). Complications included stenosis of the conduit that caused difficult
      catheterization in 3 patients, necessitating dilation or minor revision in 2 and 
      complete replacement by appendix in 1. Urinary leakage from the Mitrofanoff
      channel in 5 patients was treated with polydimethylsiloxane injection or
      oxybutinin. In 1 patient the channel was reimplanted, since the catheter struck
      the bladder neck during catheterization and caused severe pain. CONCLUSIONS:
      Results of the ureteral Mitrofanoff channel seem somewhat less satisfactory than 
      those of appendicovesicostomy but they remain acceptable and even comparable,
      strongly supporting its use in certain circumstances.

TI  - Tolterodine--a new bladder selective muscarinic receptor antagonist: preclinical 
      pharmacological and clinical data.
PG  - 1129-36
AB  - Tolterodine is a new, potent and competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist in
      clinical development for the treatment of urge incontinence and other symptoms of
      unstable bladder. Tolterodine has a high affinity and specificity for muscarinic 
      receptors in vitro and it exhibits a selectivity for the urinary bladder over
      salivary glands in vivo. A major active metabolite, (PNU-200577) the
      5-hydroxymethyl derivative of tolterodine, has a similar pharmacological profile.
      Based on pharmacological and pharmacokinetic data, it has been concluded that
      this metabolite contributes significantly to the therapeutic effect of
      tolterodine. The bladder selectivity demonstrated by tolterodine and PNU-200577
      in vivo cannot be attributed to selectivity for a single muscarinic receptor
      subtype. Moreover, this favourable tissue-selectivity seems to occur also in
      humans. Tolterodine is well tolerated and it exerts a marked effect on bladder
      function in healthy volunteers. Phase II data indicate that tolterodine is an
      efficacious and safe treatment for patients with idiopathic detrusor instability 
      or detrusor hyperreflexia. An optimal efficacy/side-effect profile is obtained
      with tolterodine, at a dosage of 1 or 2 mg twice daily, which seems to have less 
      propensity to cause dry mouth than the currently available antimuscarinic drugs.

AB  - Recent public health policies emphasize managing urinary incontinence
      nonoperatively, rather than proceeding directly to surgery. Advantages of this
      approach include decreased cost and risk. Additionally, incontinence treatment
      becomes accessible to many more women, by expanding care to nonspecialists. This 
      article reviews data published in the past 18-24 months pertaining to
      conservative management of incontinence. Specific modalities reviewed include
      pelvic floor muscle exercises, electrical stimulation, medication, vaginal
      devices, and bladder training.

TI  - Long-term bladder dysfunction in boys with posterior urethral valves.
PG  - 222-4
AB  - We report a series of 60 children operated on for posterior urethral valve (PUV) 
      before the age of 5 years and followed up for 10 years. This work aims to study
      the vesico-sphincteric sequelae of this malformation. 38 patients showed early
      urinary incontinence post-operatively. Of them, 20 were re-evaluated 10 years
      later by pelvic ultrasonography, pressure flow studies combined with EMG and
      assessment of renal function. 8 patients refused to undergo these investigations 
      and 10 were lost to follow-up. Of the 28 evaluable patients, 22 are currently
      continent and a complete urodynamic study was performed for the 6 (10%)
      incontinent patients. Of them, 3 showed uninhibited detrusor contractions. The
      vesical compliance was frequently within the normal limits. No case of
      detrusor-sphincteric dyssynergy or urethral hypotony was found. 2 were
      successfully treated by oxybutinin and biofeedback reeducation, 2 were partially 
      improved but their prostates are still in growth and the possibility of
      implanting an artificial sphincter was discussed in the remaining 2. The
      urodynamic evaluation of those patients in the long-term is encouraging.

TI  - Intravesical oxybutynin for spinal cord injury patients.
PG  - 284-7
AB  - The treatment of choice for the failure to restore neurogenic bladder
      dysfunction, managed with clean intermittent catheterization program with
      incontinence, is anticholinergic medication. The goal is to increase bladder
      capacity, and decrease intravesical pressure in order to maintain continence
      between catheterizations. The most commonly used anticholinergic medication in
      the United States is Oxybutynin. Previous clinical studies have shown that 61% of
      the patients on oral Oxybutynin report adverse systemic side effects and are
      noncompliant in taking it. In 48% of the patients, possibly due to their
      noncompliance, oral Oxybutynin Hydrochloride is ineffective. In this study, 13
      spinal cord injured patients with a failure to restore bladder dysfunction were
      treated with intravesical Oxybutynin. Nine patients improved on the regimen while
      one patient underwent surgical bladder augmentation. Postoperatively, this
      patient continued to be incontinent between catheterizations. Reinstitution of
      intravesical Oxybutynin stabilized the patient's bladder with clean intermittent 
      catheterization without further intervention. After 3 months post instillation in
      the urodynamic studies, the mean bladder capacity increased, the mean volume at
      first contraction increased and the leak point pressure decreased. The decrease
      in leak point pressure was statistically significant. Leak point pressure is one 
      of the most important parameters we monitor to preserve upper urinary tract
      function. We recommend the trial of intravesical Oxybutynin for patients who fit 
      the criteria of the protocol prior to surgical bladder augmentation.

TI  - Efficacy of oxybutynin, pseudoephedrine and indomethacin in the treatment of
      primary nocturnal enuresis.
PG  - 155-9
AB  - The efficacy of oxybutynin, pseudoephedrine and indomethacin treatment was
      investigated in 29 patients with primary nocturnal enuresis. Patients were
      randomly assigned to either oxybutynin (1st group, n = 9), pseudoephedrine (2nd
      group, n = 11) or indomethacin (3rd group, n = 9) treatments. Oxybutynin and
      indomethacin did not cause a statistically significant difference in the number
      of dry nights (p > 0.05), but patients treated with pseudoephedrine had a
      significant increase in the number of dry nights (p < 0.05). Five patients in the
      oxybutynin and one patient in the indomethacin group experienced side effects.
      None of the patients in the pseudoephedrine group had any complaints with the
      drug. We therefore conclude that pseudoephedrine can be an alternative in the
      treatment of primary nocturnal enuresis.

TI  - Post-prostatectomy incontinence: urodynamic findings and treatment outcomes.
PG  - 1256-9
AB  - PURPOSE: We examined urodynamic findings and treatment outcomes in a large
      population of men with post-prostatectomy incontinence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 
      total of 215 men was referred for evaluation and treatment of significant
      post-prostatectomy incontinence. Urodynamic evaluation consisted of provocation
      multichannel medium fill cystometry with vigorous attempts to demonstrate
      incontinence. Treatment was directed by the results of the urodynamic study. A
      pad scoring system was used to gauge the severity of incontinence before and
      after treatment. RESULTS: Based on the results of urodynamic studies 40% of the
      men had genuine stress incontinence alone and approximately 60% had a major
      component of bladder dysfunction contributing to incontinence. Treatment results 
      of 135 men demonstrated a significant decrease in pad score (p<0.001) for those
      treated with anticholinergics, those undergoing artificial sphincter insertion
      and those treated pharmacologically before sphincter placement. CONCLUSIONS: In
      our large series most men with prostatectomy incontinence did not have genuine
      stress incontinence alone. Thus, urodynamic studies are critical, not only to
      define cause of incontinence but to direct effective therapy.

TI  - Ten years experience with chronic prostatitis in Africans.
PG  - 176-8
AB  - This is a prospective study of seventy three patients with chronic prostatitis
      over a ten year period (1984-1994. The study was carried out at various hospitals
      in Lagos Nigeria and Nairobi Kenya. The mean age was 39.3 years. Chronic
      bacterial prostatitis was diagnosed in 15 patients (20.5%) of which 11 patients
      (73.3%) had Escherichia coli as the causative pathogen. Four of these patients
      (36.4%) were symptom and culture free after 12 weeks therapy with
      trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole. Four of the other seven patients not responding to 
      trimethoprim (57.1%) became symptom and culture free after four weeks therapy
      with ciproflaxacin. Non bacterial prostatitis including prostatodynia was
      diagnosed in 58 patients (79.5%). Only 15 of these patients (25.8%) reported some
      subjective relief of symptoms on emperic therapy with doxycycline with complete
      relapse on discontinuation of therapy. Further therapy with non steroidal
      anti-inflammatory ibuprofen and anticholinergic oxybutinin chloride proved
      effective in alleviating symptoms in 40 patients (68.96%), but all relapsed on
      discontinuation of therapy emphasizing the ineffective and unsatisfactory nature 
      of the present emperic treatment regimens as the cause of non bacterial
      prostatitis remains unknown.

TI  - Comparison of the effects of various anticholinergic drugs on human isolated
      urinary bladder.
PG  - 76-89
AB  - We investigated the effects of various anticholinergic drugs (atropine,
      oxybutynin, terodiline and propiverine) on the contractions induced by
      acetylcholine, KCl, CaCl2, and electrical field stimulation, in human isolated
      urinary bladder smooth muscles using the muscle bath technique. Urinary bladders 
      were obtained from 20 patients who underwent total cystectomy due to malignant
      bladder tumor. The detrusor preparations were taken from the intact part of the
      dome of the bladder. Acetylcholine caused a concentration-dependent contraction
      in human detrusor preparations. Atropine (10(-9)-10(-6) M), oxybutynin
      (10(-8)-10(-5) M), terodiline (10(-7)-10(-5) M) and propiverine (10(-7)-10(-5) M)
      caused parallel shifts to the right of the concentration-response curves to
      acetylcholine. The rank order of pA2 values was: atropine > oxybutynin >
      terodiline = propiverine. Atropine did not suppress the maximum contraction to
      acetylcholine, while the other drugs significantly suppressed the maximum
      contractions at the higher concentrations. Each drug caused a
      concentration-dependent inhibition of the KCl (80 mM)- and CaCl2 (5 mM)-induced
      contractions; the maximum inhibitions of terodiline and propiverine were
      significantly greater than those of oxybutynin and atropine. Each drug caused a
      concentration-dependent inhibition of the contraction induced by electrical field
      stimulation; the maximum inhibitions of terodiline and propiverine were
      significantly greater than those of oxybutynin and atropine. The results suggest 
      that the drugs have both anticholinergic and calcium antagonistic effects.
      Furthermore, it also appears that part of the human bladder contraction, which
      was significantly inhibited by terodiline and propiverine, is an
      atropine-resistant component.

TI  - Augmentation duracystoplasty in neurogenic bladder dysfunction.
PG  - 172-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Augmentation cystoplasty is the treatment of choice for patients with
      neurogenic bladder dysfunction in cases that are unresponsive to other medical
      treatment. Although intestinal segments as bladder substitutes are preferred over
      the other alternatives at present, they are not ideal bladder replacements due to
      several potential hazards. The purpose of this study was to determine whether or 
      not augmentation duracystoplasty can be an alternative to augmentation
      enterocystoplasties. METHODS: Ten patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction
      unresponsive to conservative measures, underwent augmentation duracystoplasty by 
      using the modified Bramble-Clam technique. The follow-up period was T-28 months. 
      RESULTS: At present, seven of 10 patients are completely continent for with clean
      intermittent catheterization. The remaining three patients required oral
      oxybutinin therapy, postoperatively, to achieve continence although lower dosages
      than those required in the preoperative period. We did not observe any serious
      pre- or postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these preliminary
      findings we think that duracystoplasty can be considered as a treatment
      alternative for hyperreflexic and/or low compliant neurogenic bladders.

TI  - The Kropp-onlay procedure (Pippi Salle procedure): a simplification of the
      technique of urethral lengthening. Preliminary results in eight patients.
PG  - 656-62
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To lengthen the urethra to increase bladder outlet resistance in
      adolescent girls with a neurogenic bladder. PATIENTS AND METHODS: During a 2-year
      period (1992-94), eight girls (mean age 13.5 years, range 9-19) underwent a
      Kropp-onlay urethral lengthening associated, for six of them, with a bladder
      augmentation. Seven of the eight patients patients were spina bifida and confined
      to a wheelchair. One patient had had a previous transverse myelitis. A
      Benchekroun hydraulic value (in three cases) and a Malone procedure (in two
      cases) were performed at the same stage. The technique of Kropp-onlay urethral
      lengthening, which creates a flap value mechanism which leaks when the bladder is
      too full, is described and illustrated. RESULTS: Seven of eight patients were dry
      during the day and four were occasionally damp during the second part of the
      night. One could not be dry for more than 2 h during the day but had a very
      hyperactive detrusor. She developed two bladder stones which required an open
      vesicotomy. One developed a urethral fistula requiring a second Kropp-onlay
      procedure and became dry afterwards. Two patients, who did not undergo a bladder 
      augmentation, needed oxybutinin therapy to obtain a satisfactory result.
      Post-operative urodynamic measurements are discussed. CONCLUSION: The Knopp-onlay
      urethral lengthening is easier to perform than the original Kropp procedure. The 
      preliminary results are similar to those of alternative techniques (e.g. urethral
      suspension) but long-term reliability of this technique remains unknown.

TI  - [Topical administration of oxybutynin hydrochloride in women with urge
      incontinence. Results of a prospective randomized double-blind study].
PG  - 240-3
AB  - Detrusor instability is the second most common cause of femal urinary
      incontinence. Oxybutynin chloride anticholinergic action with direct
      muscle-relaxant properties. 39 women with persistent-urgeincontinence
      participated in a pilot study of intravesical oxybutynin application. Patients
      received either 20 mg oxybutynin or placebo as 40 ml sterile sodium chloride
      solution administered intravesically over a period of 10 days. Urodynamic
      assessment as well as micturition protocols were performed before and after
      treatment. The intravesical oxybutynin-application was significantly better than 
      the placebo application concerning reduction of pollakisuria and nycturia.
      Oxybutynin also increased bladder capacity more than in the placebo-treated group
      (p < 0.01) and provided an improvement of bladder compliance (p < 0.05). No local
      or systemic side effects were observed which would have immediately terminated
      the oxybutynin treatment.

TI  - Nocturnal enuresis.
PG  - 427-34
AB  - Nocturnal enuresis is common. Although its aetiology remains unclear recent
      evidence increasingly supports the lack of a normal nocturnal increase in ADH
      leading to nocturnal polyuria exceeding functional bladder capacity. Sleep
      patterns are probably normal although an arousal disorder might be a factor.
      Treatment should follow careful evaluation to determine if one is dealing with
      'uncomplicated' or 'complicated' enuresis. Complicated enuresis requires further 
      investigation. 'Uncomplicated enuresis' always requires reassurance and patient
      and parent education. Resource centres such as ERIC can provide information and
      advice. Active treatment should be tailored to the patients age, motivation and
      parental wishes. Behavioural modification techniques yield the highest long-term 
      cure rate but require the most commitment and are rarely successful before the
      age of 7-8 years. Pharmacotherapy has been revolutionized by DDAVP which gives a 
      response rate of up to 70% relatively free from side-effects but at the price of 
      a high relapse rate after medication. Imipramine is less expensive than DDAVP but
      may be fatal in overdose. Anticholinergics should be reserved for those patients 
      with significant diurnal symptoms or those who fail first-line pharmacotherapy.
      Overall patients and parents should be reassured by the high spontaneous cure
      rate.

TI  - Hypoglycemia following inadvertent and factitious sulfonylurea overdosages.
PG  - 563-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To recognize unreported sulfonylurea overdosages in hypoglycemic
      patients. CASES: We describe three patients with hypoglycemia due to inadvertent 
      (in two patients) and factitious (in one patient) sulfonylurea overdosages. We
      review the world literature and summarize 43 previously published cases of
      inadvertently administered and 23 previously published cases of factitiously
      self-administered sulfonylurea overdosages with hypoglycemia. RESULTS: An
      inadvertently administered fulsonylurea overdosage usually occurred when a
      sulfonylurea was accidentally substituted for an intended medication with a
      similar generic or trade name. Features of the patients with a factitiously
      self-administered sulfonylurea overdosage included: 1) a history of the patient
      or patient's spouse having a medical job or sulfonylurea-treated diabetes
      mellitus; 2) an unusual affect or psychiatric history; 3) an abrupt onset of
      severe symptoms without previous milder symptoms; and 4) an absent hypoglycemic
      or hyperinsulinemic response to provocative testing. These features are not
      typical for an insulinoma. CONCLUSIONS: When a hypoglycemic patient denies
      antidiabetic medication use, we recommend sequentially performing: 1) a thorough 
      pill inspection; 2) an interview for recently altered pill appearances; 3) a
      measurement of serum insulin and C-peptide levels during hypoglycemia; and 4) a
      blood or urine sulfonylurea screen. Discovery of an unreported sulfonylurea
      overdosage can eliminate the need to search for an insulinoma and prevent further
      overdosages from occurring.

TI  - Incontinence in the nursing home.
PG  - 438-49
AB  - Urinary and fecal incontinence are prevalent, disruptive, and expensive health
      problems in the nursing home population. Nursing home residents who are
      incontinent of urine should have a basic diagnostic assessment, including a
      focused history and bladder record, a targeted physical examination, a
      urinalysis, and a determination of postvoid residual urine volume done by
      catheterization or ultrasonography. Potentially reversible conditions, such as
      fecal impaction and drug side effects, should be identified and treated. Selected
      residents should have further urodynamic evaluation or other diagnostic tests.
      Prompted voiding, a simple, noninvasive behavioral intervention, is effective in 
      managing daytime urinary incontinence in one quarter to one third of incontinent 
      nursing home residents. If it is to be effective over a long period of time, this
      intervention must be targeted to those residents most likely to respond. Selected
      nursing home residents will benefit from other behavioral interventions, drug
      therapy, or surgery. Because of the morbidity associated with it, long-term
      catheterization should only be used for specific indications. Like urinary
      incontinence, fecal incontinence may be caused by potentially reversible
      conditions. After such conditions have been excluded, fecal incontinence can
      generally be managed effectively by avoiding fecal impaction and by using a
      systematic bowel-training protocol.

TI  - Oxybutynin. A review of its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties, and
      its therapeutic use in detrusor instability.
PG  - 243-62
AB  - Oxybutynin possesses anticholinergic and spasmolytic properties, which together
      form the basis for its use as a therapeutic option in patients with overactive
      detrusor function--either idiopathic detrusor instability (DI) or detrusor
      hyperreflexia. Of the symptoms of detrusor overactivity, urge incontinence is
      often the most distressing to the patient. Urge incontinence and other subjective
      parameters (urinary frequency, urgency) improve in tandem with objective
      (cystometric) measures (maximum detrusor pressure during filling, volume at first
      desire to void, maximum bladder capacity) in ambulatory, including elderly,
      patients treated with oxybutynin. However, on the basis of results of limited
      investigations, the drug appears ineffective in elderly institutionalised
      individuals. Relative to other anticholinergic drugs, oxybutynin appears at least
      as effective as propantheline and similar in efficacy to propiverine in small
      trials, although these results are not definitive. Further investigation of
      intravesical oxybutynin may lead to this route becoming an option in patients
      with pre-existing catheters. Adverse effects--dry mouth, constipation, blurred
      vision--related to the anticholinergic activity of oxybutynin occur frequently
      and can be sufficiently troublesome to necessitate treatment discontinuation in
      up to 25% of patients, depending on the dosage. Increases in residual urine
      volume suggesting urinary retention (undesirable in patients with idiopathic DI),
      also can develop in some oxybutynin recipients. In summary, oxybutynin is one of 
      the few drugs proven to be beneficial in some patients with overactive detrusor
      function. Despite the occurrence of unwanted anticholinergic effects in many
      patients, and apparent lack of efficacy in the elderly institutionalised
      population, oxybutynin should be considered for the drug of first choice in
      patients with detrusor overactivity, including the elderly ambulatory population,
      when pharmacological therapy is indicated.

      hyperreflexia. Preliminary results.
PG  - 340-4
AB  - Topical oxybutynine (Oxy) has been used successfully in neurogenic bladder
      patients who remained wet on oral anticholinergics or could not tolerate oral
      medication. However, little is known about the pharmacokinetics of intravesical
      Oxy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the resorption rate of intravesically 
      given Oxy in the bladder in comparison with oral intake, and to find out which
      pharmacological properties of the drug are responsible for its effect when given 
      intravesically. Our results indicate that peak plasma levels of intravesical Oxy 
      appear later, are lower and stay longer compared to oral intake. Cystometries
      before, 20 min and 2 h after intravesical application of Oxy indicate that the
      main effect of intravesical Oxy on the detrusor is systemic due to its
      resorption. Our findings confirm the clinical experience that intravesical Oxy is
      well tolerated, very efficacious and better than oral medication.

TI  - Analysis of whole-blood cyclosporin G by liquid chromatography in renal
      transplant recipients.
PG  - 238-42
AB  - Cyclosporin G (CsG) is less nephrotoxic than Cyclosporin A (CsA) and is
      undergoing clinical trials for use as an immunosuppressive agent after renal
      transplantation. In this study, CsG was measured by a rapid high-performance
      liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique in blood samples (n = 107) received from
      renal transplant recipients. The HPLC assay proved to be analytically suitable in
      that it was sensitive, linear, and precise and had high recovery (102%). However,
      interference was observed from some potentially co-administered drugs such as
      calcitriol, ferrous sulfate, hydrazaline, and minoxidil. The HPLC assay for CsG
      correlated well with a FPIA (Abbott TDx), FPIA = 0.964 (HPLC) + 33.59, r =
      0.9819, Sy/x = 36.66 for patients receiving a low dose of CsG (5 mg/kg/day) and a
      high dose (10 mg/kg/day). Furthermore, the HPLC technique was capable of
      measuring predictable CsG concentrations when the drug was tapered to lower doses
      at various stages of the 16 week clinical trial. The HPLC for CsG has the further
      advantage that the same system and mobile phase can be used to measure CsA while 
      using CsC as the interval standard.

TI  - The value of the vaginal pack test in large cystoceles.
PG  - 931-4
AB  - To detect possible stress urinary incontinence associated with but masked by
      large cystoceles protruding through the vaginal orifice, a vaginal pack test was 
      done in conjunction with video fluoro-urodynamic studies. Sixteen female patients
      with large cystoceles did not demonstrate stress urinary incontinence on clinical
      examination and were included in this study. Additionally, 10 healthy female
      volunteers underwent the same test to study the effect of a vaginal pack on
      urethral dynamics. The vaginal pack revealed the presence of stress urinary
      incontinence in 11 patients (69%): 3 (19%) with type II (vesicourethral
      hypermobility) and 8 (50%) with type III (internal sphincteric deficiency). After
      insertion of the vaginal pack, urodynamic studies showed that the closing
      proximal urethral pressure in patients with stress urinary incontinence was
      significantly lower than in continent patients (p < 0.05). No significant change 
      in urethral pressures was noted in volunteer subjects after vaginal pack
      insertion. Fluoroscopy showed kinking of the posterior urethra and enlargement of
      the most dependent portion of the cystocele, that is the lower half of the
      hourglass image. Our study suggests that the mechanisms of continence in these
      patients are multifactorial, including urethral kinking, urethral compression and
      pressure dissipation. The vaginal pack test is easy to perform, increases
      visualization of the vesicourethral unit when used with fluoroscopy, and can aid 
      in the selection of patients who would benefit from anti-incontinence surgery
      and/or cystocele repair.

TI  - Cladribine in treatment of chronic progressive multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 9-13
AB  - Chronic progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) is a severely disabling demyelinating
      disease in which autoimmune processes seem to have a major role. The nucleoside
      drug cladribine is a potent lympholytic agent with few side-effects. We have
      studied its efficacy and safety in a randomised double-blind trial. 51 patients
      (48 entered as matched pairs) received four monthly courses of 0.7 mg/kg
      cladribine or placebo (saline) given through a surgically implanted central line.
      Neurologists with no knowledge of which medication the patient was receiving
      examined the patients monthly and noted two rating scale scores (Kurtzke and
      Scripps). Cerebrospinal fluid and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      examinations were done at 6 and 12 months. Average neurological scores,
      demyelinated volumes on MRI, and concentrations of oligoclonal bands in
      cerebrospinal fluid were stable or improved in the patients receiving cladrabine 
      but continued to deteriorate in patients on placebo. Mean paired (placebo minus
      matched cladribine) differences at 12 months relative to baseline were 1.0 (SE
      0.4) for the Kurtzke scores, -13.9 (2.3) for the Scripps scores, 4.57 (1.17) mL
      for demyelinated volumes, and 7.3 (3.3) arbitrary units for concentrations of
      oligoclonal bands. Cladribine was generally well tolerated and clinically
      significant toxicity occurred in only 1 patient, in whom severe marrow
      suppression developed with complete recovery after several months. 1 patient died
      of newly acquired hepatitis B, an event unlikely to be related to cladribine. We 
      conclude that the immunosuppressive drug cladribine influences favourably the
      course of chronic progressive MS.

      factor-alpha from salivary glands and saliva.
PG  - 963-70
AB  - Whole saliva collected from rat, mouse, and human sources was found to contain
      high concentrations of transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF alpha) when analyzed
      by RIA. The concentrations of TGF alpha in unstimulated human saliva (age, 30-45 
      yr; n = 10; 1.5 +/- 3.1 nM) was reduced with age (age, 55-70 yr; n = 10; 0.4 +/- 
      0.1 nM), but increased in oral pathologies manifested in xerostomia (age, 57-70; 
      n = 6; 0.8 +/- 0.2 nM) and Paget's disease (age, 58-76; n = 8; 2.0 +/- 0.6 nM).
      Immunohistochemical localization of TGF alpha in the salivary glands of rats and 
      mice revealed specific immunostaining of the granular ductal cells of the parotid
      and submandibular glands. Reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain
      reaction amplification of total RNA from the parotid and submandibular glands of 
      rats and mice demonstrated the presence of TGF alpha mRNA, suggesting endogenous 
      synthesis by the salivary glands. Thus, salivary glands appear to be an exocrine 
      source for a second member of the epidermal growth factor-like growth factor
      family in the oral cavity.

TI  - Effect of the quaternary ammonium compound trospium chloride on 24 hour jejunal
      motility in healthy subjects.
PG  - 27-33
AB  - This study aimed to record 24 hour jejunal motility in healthy ambulant subjects 
      and to analyse changes in motility caused by the oral administration of an
      anticholinergic agent, the quaternary ammonium compound, trospium chloride. In a 
      placebo-controlled, double blind crossover trial, 24 hour jejunal motility was
      recorded in 12 healthy volunteers, aged 25 (21-30) years, using a digital data
      logger connected to two strain-gauge transducers mounted 20 cm apart in a
      flexible nasojejunal catheter. A computer program was developed to determine
      contraction parameters. Trospium chloride (15 mg orally thrice daily) prolonged
      the duration of irregular contractile activity after meals (p < 0.02) and reduced
      its contraction frequency and amplitude (p < 0.001). In the fasting state, the
      cycle length of the migrating motor complex was prolonged (p < 0.01) by an
      extended phase I (p < 0.025). Phase III was shortened (p < 0.005) and showed a
      slower aboral migration velocity (p < 0.005). Clustered contractions were less
      frequent during postprandial and fasting periods (p < 0.01). Runs of clustered
      contractions were completely absent with trospium chloride. Digital manometry was
      useful for long term recordings of jejunal motility and enabled the motor effects
      of an anticholinergic agent to be characterised in ambulant subjects.

AB  - Kegel exercises were used to treat urinary incontinence in 79 children. An
      average of less than 2 hours of professional time was required. Incontinence was 
      eliminated in 60% of the patients; children who had both day and night wetting
      tended to show simultaneous improvements in both problems. Research is needed to 
      test the hypothesis that Kegel exercises eliminate involuntary contractions of

TI  - [The tethered cord syndrome : a review of causes].
PG  - 12-8
AB  - We present eighteen cases with Tethered cord syndrome (TCS). They were eleven
      adults and eight children. There were eight cases with surgical interventions
      performed in other centers during the newborn period for different types of
      spinal disraphisms. Clinical onset was insidious in 88% of the cases, and in 12% 
      of the cases was acute, due to a precipitating factor. The main clinical findings
      were neurological skeletal , urological and cutaneous alterations in variable
      frequencies. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was the best diagnostic test.
      Urodynamic studies in patients with urological alterations were abnormal and they
      helped to establish additional pharmacological treatment. After surgery 88% of
      the patients had an improvement or an arrest in the progression of the symptoms. 
      Patients with shorter duration of the symptoms (less than 2 years) had a better
      prognosis.

TI  - Influences of trospium chloride and oxybutynin on quantitative EEG in healthy
      volunteers.
PG  - 337-43
AB  - Trospium chloride and oxybutynin are two antimuscarinergic agents used in the
      treatment of unstable bladder, urge incontinence, combined stress urge
      incontinence and detrusor hyperreflexia. The possibility that these two drugs
      produce changes in central nervous electrical activity was examined in an open,
      prospective, phase I study involving 12 volunteers. Quantitative evaluation of
      the multichannel electroencephalogram obtained from young healthy volunteers
      showed statistically significant decreases in alpha and beta 1 activity after
      oxybutynin, but not after intravenous or oral administration of trospium
      chloride. The biological activity of both drugs was ascertained by continuous
      simultaneous recording of the heart rate. A decrease in heart rate was detected
      after oral administration of oxybutynin, and an increase was seen after i.v.
      administration of trospium chloride. The results suggest that trospium chloride
      is less likely to produce central nervous adverse effects than to oxybutynin.

TI  - Intravesical oxybutinin chloride in children with intermittent catheterization:
      sonographic findings.
PG  - 348-50
AB  - The sonographic findings in the bladder are presented in four children with
      myelomeningocele and neurogenic dysfunction of the bladder, who were treated with
      intermittent self-catheterization and intravesical oxybutinin chloride. All were 
      referred for routine sonography of the urinary tract. Each had infused a crushed 
      tablet of oxybutinin chloride intravesically 30-120 min before the examination.
      In two children, brightly echogenic, non-shadowing particles were suspended in
      the bladder urine. In one of these, the particles swirled giving the impression
      of a "snowstorm"; in the other, most of the particles gradually settled forming
      an irregular clump on the bladder base. In the remaining two children, the urine 
      appeared diffusely hazy with innumerable tiny particles giving the impression of 
      a fine mist filling the bladder. The sonographic appearance of the urine in the
      bladder after intravesical instillation of crushed tablets can be dramatic and
      can simulate pus, blood, fungus, or other debris in the bladder lumen. In the
      absence of clinical symptoms or hematuria, a history of recent infusion of
      medication into the bladder should be sought.

TI  - Vasopressin deficiency in primary nocturnal enuresis. Results of a controlled
      prospective study.
PG  - 366-70
AB  - The lack of circadian rhythmicity of plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) in primary
      nocturnal enuresis (PNE) in some children is known. The original test protocol is
      time-consuming and needs excellent compliance by children and parents. The goals 
      of the presented study are the introduction of a simple screening test and the
      evaluation of the response of treatment using intranasal synthetic vasopressin.
      Fifty-five children (aged 8.2 +/- 3.1 years) with PNE and 15 children (aged 7.9
      +/- 2.4 years) of a control group were investigated. Using a standardized
      protocol, AVP levels were measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) under controlled
      water intake 3 times per day over a period of 72 h. Fourteen of 55 tested
      children (25.5%) with PNE had a significant decrease in nocturnal AVP when
      compared to the control group. We measured also an increased nocturnal urine
      volume and a lower urine osmolality in this enuretic group. Eight of 14 patients 
      (57.1%) with plasma AVP deficiency (AVPD) also had bladder instability. Nine of
      14 patients (64.3%) with AVPD with or without concomitant bladder instability
      were totally dry during desmopressin treatment, but only 2 (14.3%) remained dry
      after discontinuation of treatment. Our data suggest that nocturnal urine
      osmolality measurement may reflect AVPD and predict a positive treatment outcome.
